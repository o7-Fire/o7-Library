The Tale of a.q.u.a.r.i.u.m (792540918867165224)
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:14:10 realized I made my
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:14:16 boat to thin
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:14:20 but I can't widen it
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:14:24 since the fold is in the way
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:34:12 does anyone know
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:34:16 if a copy paste tool
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:34:20 will be in pc2?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:34:50 why?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:35:04 ?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:35:30 having a copy paste tool would be very convenient
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:35:42 since I always build my ships symmetrical
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:35:46 I could build one side
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:35:49 copy it
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:35:53 flip it
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:35:57 and bam
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:36:03 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:36:09 it's efficient
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:36:19 saves alot of time
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:36:20 cope
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:36:29 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:37:25 Think of all the time saved
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:37:29 If I just could
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:37:32 Copy it tho
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:37:36 That’s more time
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:37:43 I could spend building another thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:37:48 Also
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:38:04 Will a tool where u can move a select part of your build be added?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:39:00 Is that the game
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:39:06 That I am talking about tho
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:39:08 ?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:40:10 It’s not lazy
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:40:21 It’s just more efficient
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:41:07 If one has the choice between the stairs and the elevator, the elevator being slower and the stairs being quicker
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:41:13 Is taking the stairs, lazy?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:41:17 no.
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:42:02 Why does everyone build fighter jets
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:42:21 Everyone builds fighter jets
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:42:23 Like
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:42:27 Build a train
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:42:30 Or idk
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:42:35 Something that’s not a jet
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:42:56 Yeah and there’s perfectly good *train* tracks in the game to
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:43:15 And *water* wheels
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:43:29 For example
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:43:39 The history channel might be called the history channel
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:43:56 But all they speak about is aliens
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:43:57 And
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:44:12 Men with tiny moustaches who failed art school
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:45:25 Yeah and there’s lot’s of other bad things in the game I can complain about to
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:45:46 Such as the plot size
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:45:48 The small map
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:45:52 The block limits
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:46:30 And the amount of space it takes to make a turret that can go up down left and right
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:46:55 So
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:47:05 When is plane crazy 2 going to begin existing
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:48:53 As long as they make the map bigger, plots bigger, give us a few more blocks to work with (such as 1x0.9 wedges) I am gonna be happy
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:50:09 Just turn graphics down
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:51:01 A
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 01:51:19 Also having a selection option for the move tool would be amazing
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 22:47:04 plane crazy bug
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 22:47:05 where
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 22:47:08 I press launch
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 22:47:11 for the build
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 22:47:12 and
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 22:47:17 I don't get teleport
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 23:13:37 In the popular Roblox game known as "Plane crazy" I am experiencing a bug where to when I click the button to launch my seafaring vessel, the vessel itself gets teleported but I, do not.
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 23:14:14 Better?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 23:22:01 Sir, when the "bug" has been resolved I shall look into "stop speaking smart".
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 23:23:31 In conclusion, when shall we expect to see this issue to be resolved?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 23:25:57 I have been experiencing this issue for quite a relatively long period of time, and I must say that it has been interfering with my levels of enjoyment for the popular game known as "Plane crazy".

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 23:50:10 :c
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 23:51:44 Sir, in contrast to what you suspect might be the cause of the issue at hand, I assure you that my connection is not at fault in this matter.
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 23:53:30 Sir, in contrast to what you suspect might be the cause of the issue at hand, I assure you that my connection is not at fault in this matter!

bug-reports 2021-11-25 23:57:57 Though as much as I would like to provide examples to assure you of my honesty, it sees I do not possess image permissions. (Edit: This has since changed.)
bug-reports 2021-11-26 00:00:03 In place of getting teleported as one would expect to have occurred, the vessel is all that was teleported, and even though it did get teleported, it appears that it is floating in the air above the depths of the ocean.
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 00:02:04 May I be permitted to inquire into the fact of whether the fire works inflict damage upon others?
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 00:11:32 They do inflict damage upon others then?
bug-reports 2021-11-26 00:12:47 Sir, Contrary what you suspect may be the solution, I assure you that your solution will not work.
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 00:13:45 Then may I inquire to the reason that I was able to fire them during non-pvp mode?
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 00:16:55 we should get more of them
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 00:17:03 they would be amazing to use for turret making
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 00:18:11 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 00:50:11 May I be permitted to inquire into the fact of whether the water jets inflict damage upon other's creations?
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 00:56:56 May I be permitted to inquire into the fact of whether construction of 3 block by 3 block by 3 block turret could be enabled to rotate? Or is it simply to small to do so?

plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:43:14 Zeppelins are the best thing you can build in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:43:21 Prove me wrong
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:43:28 How
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:43:52 Zeppelins can stay in 1 place in the air
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:43:57 Planes are always moving
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:44:01 zeppelins can
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:44:05 Have bigger guns
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:44:08 And more armour
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:44:16 Yea
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:44:22 And if it doesn’t
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:44:25 It’s not a plane
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:44:26 Cope

plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:49:20 Man
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:49:23 I just want
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:49:27 Someone to disagree with me
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:49:32 So I can tell them why
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:49:35 They are
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:49:40 Oh thanks
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:49:49 Why do you hate zeppelins
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:49:54 Zeppelins are great
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:50:05 They can have more armour then planes
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:50:47 No
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:50:50 -me
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:51:06 Because
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:51:20 B e c a u s e
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:51:26 The more shots I can take
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:51:33 The more time I have to fire back/dodge
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:54:31 Ok well am just going to
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:54:40 List all of the cool things about zeppelins and leave
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:54:52 Bigger guns
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:54:56 Thicker armour
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:55:07 More bomb capacity
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:55:17 Debatable
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:55:38 Inch?
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:55:51 What does inch mean
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:56:50 If 99% of the world =
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:56:55 The USA
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:56:59 Then yea I suppose
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:58:03 Me when only 3 countries use inches
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:58:20 USA, Liberia and Myanmar
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:58:55 That’s simple
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:59:00 Without the armour
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:59:08 You would clearly do a lot more then rip the ship in half
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:59:10 Smh
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 02:59:43 Why wasn’t he moving?
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:00:13 If you see a plane doing that stuff towards you
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:00:18 You don’t just
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:00:20 Sit there
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:00:24 You move!
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:00:28 What I do
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:00:35 Is I use gravity sliders
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:00:38 To sink my ship
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:00:41 Below the after line
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:00:48 So the bombs do less damage
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:00:49 Ez
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:01:14 They are bigger
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:01:20 So most planes don’t use them
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:01:23 But if they DID
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:01:28 That’s easy
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:01:38 Just raise my ship out of the water
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:05:35 It ain’t cheating
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:05:51 It’s just an advantage that I have over others due to the fact I had robux
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:05:57 Smh
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:06:48 Seriously though sinking my ship so bombers miss works quite well
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:06:51 Since the over shoot
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 03:07:04 And miss 😎
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 22:31:22 plane crazy 2 release soon??
creations-chat 2021-12-03 03:42:36 <@!693956114403819610> the heli is generic, is why people downvote
creations-chat 2021-12-03 03:45:34 Simple, it’s a generic build, building an attack helicopter isn’t anything rare or new or exciting, same with jet fighters.
creations-chat 2021-12-03 03:52:31 Well it’s the problem for me, I don’t care really about the looks about them since literally everyone makes one, they are the room temperature water of plane crazy.
creations-chat 2021-12-03 03:54:51 ok
creations-chat 2021-12-03 03:58:51 And made the lid black
creations-chat 2021-12-03 04:00:54 A zeppelin, a big one
creations-chat 2021-12-03 04:19:51 Folding a ship makes it considerably weaker, and since he probably will use it in pvp mode, it was a good choice to not fold it
creations-chat 2021-12-04 03:28:08 Colour
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 03:28:37 Building zeppelin balloons
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 03:28:40 Kinda sucks
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 19:39:34 plane crazy 2 sometime before 2022 please
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 19:40:15 *are you serious*
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 19:40:26 ok good
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 19:41:21 you guys make it so hard to believe you
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 19:43:02 so
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 19:43:06 plane crazy 2 isn't
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 19:43:10 coming out this year
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 19:44:05 we haven't gotten any dev updates in almost exactly a monthhh
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 19:44:27 oh
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 19:44:28 ok
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 19:44:38 wiat
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 19:44:43 I sense sarcasm
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 19:45:24 this feels
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 19:45:26 like a trap
creations-chat 2021-12-05 03:05:00 <@!849557593046777886> did you seriously make a shredder, and post it in creations?
creations-chat 2021-12-05 04:19:07 cringe
creations-chat 2021-12-05 18:49:06 how
creations-chat 2021-12-05 18:51:21 thank
creations-chat 2021-12-05 18:56:57 I already said what it was
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:00:44 tnt blocks are torpedoes, and what the hell does rotund mean
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:04:02 they are not fat, they are as small as they can be and the barrels don't need to be any longer, 4 block long barrels is all one needs
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:06:17 no, it's functional and sleek and the turrets are either 3x4, 7x7 or 5x5 so 4 block long barrels are relatively long
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:08:24 it is sleek, prove me wrong or cry about it.
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:10:27 A, yeah most ships are flat on the back, B yeah most ships don't frickin use squiggles for sides because that's stupid and it's not a box if you actually looked at it/knew what a box was, this build took me days and it 9.7k blocks and it is my best build.
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:12:40 A it's a ww1 heavy cruiser,  it was meant to be a destroyer at first but changed my mind about half way through so I didn't change that, and it has an interior anyway so no it's not just filled with blocks.
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:14:48 it's not meant to be a real ship though and again, it was originally meant to be a flat back because it was originally a destroyer.
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:16:53 that would make the build back heavy and I don't wanna change it anymore then I already did, I wanna move on to my next build, if you guys think it's bad then I think you just have your expectations set to high.
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:20:22 screw yall
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:22:33 anyway, my boat is good and you guys can go cry about how it makes you wanna die apparently

plane-crazy 2021-12-05 21:05:26 trying to build this
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 21:05:34 but I can't seem to get the rounding at the front correct
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 21:06:40 what
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 21:07:21 it's to small
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 21:54:28 wow you are so helpful
creations-chat 2021-12-06 00:15:17 no -me
it's not based on any ship, as I SAID so I can make it look however I want
creations-chat 2021-12-06 00:17:22 this is what my build looks like so far
creations-chat 2021-12-06 00:21:39 it's meant to be this https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zeppelin-war/images/1/1d/Assault_Blimp.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/851?cb=20200923014642
creations-chat 2021-12-06 00:23:41 zeppelin wars.
I don't know how I am going to round the front.
I wont put the dehli police logo on it.
creations-chat 2021-12-06 00:25:44 two pontoons wont work
creations-chat 2021-12-06 00:36:20 dude, like 7 people already told me it's bad, leave me a l o n e
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:41:57 anyone know
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:42:05 how I could do the rounding here:
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:42:06 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zeppelin-war/images/1/1d/Assault_Blimp.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/851?cb=20200923014642
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:42:13 at the front
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:42:45 close as I could possibly get then
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:42:46 ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:49:41 b29's are smaller
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:49:48 so they can use half balls
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:51:30 also all the other zeppelin tutorials make their cabin really small
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:51:36 so they just use wedges
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:53:41 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zeppelin-war/images/1/1d/Assault_Blimp.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/851?cb=20200923014642
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:53:45 does anyone know
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:53:48 how I would make the front
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:53:51 in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:54:17 yea
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:54:30 doesn't matter rn
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:54:34 how would I do it
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:54:43 how
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:54:44 then
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:55:23 idk what you mean
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:57:04 you overestimate the amount of availible space here
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:58:10 ehh
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 00:58:14 I could try it
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 01:00:12 what is the light green wedge
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 01:00:50 k thanks
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 01:09:44 it worked perfectly
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 01:17:37 what could I do to fill in these gaps
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 01:21:30 how fill gaps
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 01:21:30 
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 01:23:57 it is
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 01:24:06 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zeppelin-war/images/1/1d/Assault_Blimp.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/851?cb=20200923014642
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 01:24:08 it's this
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 01:31:56 my build
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 01:31:59 is symmetrical
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 01:32:03 my the center of mass
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 01:32:07 is not in the middle
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 01:32:12 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 01:38:36 just the yellow
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 01:38:43 my build has no BLUE THING
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 01:39:06 ik
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 01:39:15 my build has none
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 01:40:31 
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:20:31 is this good curving for a zeppelin balloon
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:21:21 it's only a 25 blocks wide zeppelin tho
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:22:40 but I do see
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:22:54 true I do need to widen it aswell
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:23:05 but it's only
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:23:10 17 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:23:13 and it needs to be
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:23:15 a few more
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:23:18 atleast 25
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:23:45 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zeppelin-war/images/1/1d/Assault_Blimp.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/851?cb=20200923014642
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:23:48 it's meant to be this
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:28:03 I don't want to fold it
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:28:04 at all
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:28:14 but I only have 10 blocks left in the rear
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:28:20 of space
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:28:45 and I only have 10.5 blocks left in the front
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:28:56 Now I think I can fit the balloon
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:28:59 in that space
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:29:03 but I am not aware
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:29:16 furries < weebs I think
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:29:58 the only anime I ever watched was pokemon go
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:30:04 😎
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:30:36 furries are still bad though
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:30:57 more like
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:31:00 the majority
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:31:04 of people's opinions
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:31:07 but ok
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:31:26 n o
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:31:35 yea
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:31:38 that means they're bad
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:31:59 many things
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:32:03 bad
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:32:03 are objectively
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:32:07 such as furries
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:32:10 and other things
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:33:18 prove it
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:33:19 easy
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:33:21 prove it
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:33:31 halloween costumes that just happen to be a dog don't count
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:33:33 as furries
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:34:12 that's
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:34:14 not what I meant
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 21:34:16 I meant
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 00:48:38 I can’t get the curving for a blimp balloon to work
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:00:20 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zeppelin-war/images/1/1d/Assault_Blimp.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/851?cb=20200923014642

plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:00:26 have any idea
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:00:33 how to do the curving on this balloon
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:03:35 rotation lock?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:04:42 k
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:05:05 can someone try and answer my question tho
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:05:16 this
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:05:24 how
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:06:22 this looks like it'll take up way to much space
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:06:24 I need to fit
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:06:27 helium
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:06:30 in this balloon
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:08:14 no
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:08:34 I gotta custom angle the majority of this balloon
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:08:37 right?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:08:45 then no
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:08:47 it wont fit
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:09:01 how
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:09:11 so lemme get this straight
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:09:19 1 tower
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:09:22 custom angles
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:09:26 the entire balloon
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:09:33 huge balloon
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:09:39 how
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:10:01 I've never done it before
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:10:22 because the tutorial I am looking at
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:10:25 got it
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:10:27 looking
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:10:29 as if it wont fit
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:10:52 uhhh
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:10:54 sure...
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:10:58 totally..
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:11:21 n o
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:12:17 it's not giant
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:12:20 you are over estimating
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:12:22 the amount
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:12:24 of availible space
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:12:48 it's 25 blocks wide 9referring to the under carriage)
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:12:55 and 30.5 long
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:12:58 it's not massive
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:13:08 a
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:16:21 I am speaking of the ballon
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:16:29 yea
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:16:33 and that's not even round enough
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:16:38 and it's to BIG
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:17:29 It's a
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:17:31 at MOST
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:17:37 50 block long
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:17:47 balloon
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:22:42 No
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:22:47 It looks big from the photo
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:23:02 But the carriage is only 30.5 blocks long
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:23:09 And it’s only 25 looks wide
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:23:51 If 30.5 blocks long is big then what’s small
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:24:13 No that’s tiny
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:24:54 Honestly If I didn’t have to build the balloon I wouldn’t
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:25:05 But it won’t float or turn without it
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:25:26 No
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:25:41 Yea
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:25:51 That’s what I plan on filling the balloon with
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:25:52 Duh
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:26:52 Yea so you were wrong
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:26:54 Smh
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:27:19 Zeppy wars
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:28:05 What
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:28:09 Who said I got mad
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:28:11 It’s a blimp
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:28:18 It’s a blimp because in the game
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:28:20 It’s called
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:28:23 Assault blimp
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:28:30 Yea
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:28:33 The balloon
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:28:35 Is part
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:28:37 Of the blimp
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 20:00:31 H
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 04:36:30 If plane crazy 2 isn’t out by December 31st
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 04:36:40 am gonna be disappointed
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 04:37:01 Or atleast a paid beta
creations-chat 2021-12-17 00:36:05 everyone in <#384025409945337856> when they see a build that isn't absolutely perfect in every single way: 👎
you guys set your standards to high
creations-chat 2021-12-17 00:38:14 decent and good builds get <:Downvote:490311668556103700> aswell, not just bad ones, it seems that if a build isn't great then it's just gonna get 50 downvotes smh
creations-chat 2021-12-17 00:41:13 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/920989036556980295 like this is quite good and yet it got 39 downvote
creations-chat 2021-12-17 00:45:43 it is a great replica of the real thing, you can't judge it off of that, you are meant to judge it off accuracy
creations-chat 2021-12-23 14:30:19 Idk I thought it looked nice
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 19:57:50 Idk why people like building tanks
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 19:58:12 They don’t have fire power or survivability of a submarine or a ship
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 19:58:20 But don’t have the mobility of a plane or a helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:00:03 Oh and zeppelins are literally the best possible thing to make
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:00:40 Depends
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:00:50 No, it depends
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:01:06 Zeppelins are best
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:01:21 They have the mobility of a plane
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:01:28 And the fire power of a ship
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:01:35 Along with the survivability of one
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:01:50 Indeed they are
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:02:24 I suppose but
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:02:29 It would be able to take more hits
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:02:34 Then the planes attacking it
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:03:01 Doesn’t matter if u use rockets and are decent
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:03:13 I’ve taken out fighters in my cruiser
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:03:49 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:03:53 I have a zeppelin myself
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:03:58 It can kill shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:04:06 And still be able to do a controlled landing
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:04:17 Oh my zeppy?
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:04:31 I don’t got a complete image I just got the under carriage
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:04:36 If that’s good
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:04:46 I don’t wanna have to join the game rn

plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:07:59 This is when it wasn’t done
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:08:04 With the balloon attached
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:08:12 This is it without the balloon
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:10:39 This is when it wasn’t done
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:10:45 The balloon wasn’t finished yet
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:11:16 If you insist
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:11:26 But I stand by the zeppelin is best
plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:12:02 I could make this zeppelin so much better if I wasn’t recreating it from another source

plane-crazy 2021-12-24 20:55:27 yes.
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:45:22 Idk how to make a block tnt block torpedo that is 1 block wide and doesn’t use pistons
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:45:43 And only uses 1 tnt block
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:46:09 ^
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:46:29 All my torpedoes are 2 blocks wide with 4 tnt blocks
events-chat 2022-01-09 04:02:50 If the size restrictions are 20x20x50 then what side is the 50
events-chat 2022-01-09 04:04:16 Which is it!?
events-chat 2022-01-09 04:06:11 Y
events-chat 2022-01-09 04:51:58 I mean it looks more like you went looks then you did for practicality
events-chat 2022-01-09 05:57:11 am going more fora
events-chat 2022-01-09 05:57:29 tankier approach
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:00:38 ur
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:00:56 not good
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:16:02 Only propellers
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:16:20 And water wheels I think
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:16:39 Though I find water wheels are to small to work effectively
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:18:23 Yea, to small
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:18:40 There should be a 5x5 water wheel
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:19:17 Who seriously builds ship that is 3 blocks tall
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:20:07 the ones
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:20:24 on the steam ships
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:20:48 y e s
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:21:45 Not doing that, they just need a 5x5 water wheel
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:22:19 Coming when I’m 83
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:22:37 Plane crazy 2 taking very long time
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:32:12 is there any way I could use 7 cutters instead of 6
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:32:54 d a m n
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:33:22 yes, 6, and I always make the front of my ship out of cutters so I can ram others
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:34:31 
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:35:27 gonna make this
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:35:56 it's a frigate
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:36:28 it;s gonna be only 6 blocks tall at the front and 4 at the back
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:37:21 n o
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:38:07 idk I think small boats are over rated in this when I look at the restrictions
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:38:24 bigger boats seem ideal
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:39:25 I mean, there's no lava spitters allowed, only, 6 cutters,
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:39:50 any boat that dies to 1 rocket isn't good
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:40:07 do you have bullet deflectors?
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:40:38 o k
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:44:01 why aren't we allowed to use the whole plot
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:44:18 length, why 50 instead of 52
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:44:38 yea but what difference does 2 blocks make!?
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:45:22 I just wanna be able to use the whole length
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:47:15 who do I message for exceptions?
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:47:46 I use individual blocks because cool
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:48:04 I want the length except so i can add a 3 block long flag at the end
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:48:35 because I can and I don't see the harm of it since it provides no unfair protection
events-chat 2022-01-11 22:19:37 Why is there like
events-chat 2022-01-11 22:19:55 3 submissions that clearly violate the restrictions posted in <#917397949938548736>
events-chat 2022-01-12 00:01:23 idk what I am gonna build
events-chat 2022-01-12 00:01:46 I started on 2 boats, gave up on 2 boats and now just have 2 unfinished boats and no idea what to build
events-chat 2022-01-12 04:07:46 I'm almost done my boat
events-chat 2022-01-12 04:08:18 I don't plan on getting caught with no propellors
events-chat 2022-01-12 04:08:37 if I lose it's gonna be because I get killed or my seat gets destroyed
events-chat 2022-01-12 13:37:40 I think the “big Chungus” boat will win
events-chat 2022-01-12 13:38:16 Yea
events-chat 2022-01-12 13:39:53 Doesn’t really matter since it be fast
events-chat 2022-01-12 13:41:07 Faster then my mom apparently, which is very fast
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:22:54 Why everyone making lame small low to the water fast boats
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:23:13 That’s lameeeeee
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:23:45 That’s kinda stupid aswell
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:24:17 Nope
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:25:12 The point of having big ships is to fit as many guns as possible with as much protection as possible, making a 3 fold ship would give you protection but it wouldn’t provide more guns as we already have such a limited amount of weapons to use that rally they could all fit on a torpedo boat
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:25:47 If there was no limit on rockets or guns I would understand making a big ship
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:26:07 But 6 gun and 4 rocket can fit on again, torpedo boat
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:26:34 Well now u do smh
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:27:10 I did detect it
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:27:34 How
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:28:45 I got a 6 block tall 7 block wide 3 block thick on each side 20 block long boat
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:29:15 The height includes the cabin, the hull is only 4 blocks
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:31:02 Your boat can also be blown up in 1 rocket I assume though
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:33:10 If it’s beam construction then it’s long?
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:34:13 Building with beam lame, build if block so when you get hit with rocket block explode off!!!
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:34:45 My boat only goes 25 speed
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:35:21 Though
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:35:38 I will be increasing my boat’s speed
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:35:55 To like, 75.
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:36:12 It’s a small arena idk why you guys want such speedy boats
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:36:45 Why is nobody making an aircraft carrier is the real question
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:37:14 Because then I can shoot the big thing
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:37:31 Just make a really thick hull, easy
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:37:49 10 blocks thick 😎
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:38:15 I have a boat that is 8 blocks thick on each side and it doesn’t sink so I think the aircraft carrier would be good
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:39:58 It usually kills small boats before it dies
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:44:06 I use rudder turning because cool and yes
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:48:33 I don’t like the idea of having 1 or 2 propellers because If 1 shot hits it then I lose, so I got 8
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:48:51 8 propellers
events-chat 2022-01-12 15:55:57 how many propellors is enough
events-chat 2022-01-12 15:56:46 no..
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:00:12 but I still only go 31 speed is the problem, so is more needed?
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:03:08 that would require taking off blocks
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:09:34 rbk
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:09:58 is there a limit to how many propellors I ccan have
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:10:39 also my turn radius is a bit big for the arena
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:11:12 how would I get it to turn quicker
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:11:51 I use rudders
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:14:44 also when you make sea mines
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:15:03 do the mines have to be attached to the boat and then let go? or can they spawn in the water?
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:27:12 well that's easy though
events-chat 2022-01-12 18:27:26 h o w
events-chat 2022-01-12 19:26:55 I suppose  will try
events-chat 2022-01-13 00:43:09 Oh god you’re dead
events-chat 2022-01-13 00:43:26 Gonna be so many small boats firing at you
events-chat 2022-01-13 00:44:05 Not smart, what if that 1 turret gets hit with a rocket?
events-chat 2022-01-13 00:44:29 I plan on having 2, 3 gun turrets
events-chat 2022-01-13 00:47:48 If you say so
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:16:32 oh
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:16:55 you aswell, suffer from "I use mincrosoft capture to record things because it's what my PC came with" syndrome
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:18:51 I was responding to this man
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:20:02 this man made a master piece as we can see
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:26:39 if you consider that boat target practice you are gonna enjoy my boat
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:26:56 except mine is faster
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:27:14 mine goes 50
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:27:46 no I could easily make my boat alot faster it's just I don't want to
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:28:07 I had my boat at 73 speed, I just lowered it
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:28:24 to fast for such a small arena
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:30:11 my boat is more then 1 block above the water because I am cool
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:30:28 it is 4 blocks above the water at its highest point
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:31:58 I had mine at 73
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:32:14 but I decided it was to fast for the small arena so I lowered it
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:32:43 lemme go on the game and check
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:36:09 9 blocks wide, 9.5 blocks tall, 29 blocks long.
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:37:23 I had a bigger boat
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:37:53 but I thought that, if the only weapons that are allowed is 4 rockets and 6 guns then why have such a fat boat?
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:39:18 here is one of my unfinished original builds for the event:
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:41:06 same

the-dump 2022-11-13 02:22:23 When plane crazy 2 coming out
the-dump 2022-11-15 03:33:27 You are making the very common and understandable mistake of mixing up the very similar being gay and being British
the-dump 2022-11-23 21:46:11 We don’t need or want an infinite ocean so he’s wasting his own time making that really
the-dump 2022-11-23 21:46:43 Also
the-dump 2022-11-23 21:46:46 So what
the-dump 2022-11-23 21:47:08 He still isn’t updating the community
the-dump 2022-11-23 21:47:11 At all
the-dump 2022-11-23 21:47:26 He’s giving deadlines and then when they pass and still no game he says nothing about it
the-dump 2022-11-23 21:49:21 Nuh uh
the-dump 2022-11-23 21:49:32 Not nearly enough block choice in plane crazy rn
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 00:49:51 Can’t wait for plane crazy 2, releasing February 30th
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 19:01:06 Pc2 release date is official 🥳
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 19:01:14 The day after the sun burns out
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:42:20 I think this man is wrong.
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:42:45 How
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:42:51 Do you work at a car company
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:43:08 So
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:43:15 So
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:44:16 Okay then you realize that modern trucks have bigger beds then ur 1998 Chevy
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:44:44 Prove it
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:45:16 My dad does
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:45:18 Always has
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:45:24 Has owned many
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:45:27 Many many trucks
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:45:41 Not naming every single one nuh uh
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:46:56 Keep in mind this man drives it every day for his work, for multiple hours a day
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:47:07 Over the span of about 16 years this is
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:47:31 Yea but my dad wouldn’t use a 1998
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:47:35 It’s not big enough
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:48:09 And only 2 seats
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:48:13 It’d never work
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:48:38 Yes u do
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:48:48 What if u can’t get something wet
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:49:08 Or what if it’s to breakable
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:49:13 Or what if there isn’t any space
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:49:47 A 1998 Chevy Silverado is to small for his use at all
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:49:58 Welll then ur wrong
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:50:02 Contractor
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:50:35 This man? Wrong
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:51:16 My dad owns his contracting company and does work u would usually contract out because it saves money
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:51:53 Yes
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:52:08 No
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:52:10 It isn’t
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:52:17 No it isn’t
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:52:30 How else is he gonna take all the wood he carries
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:52:38 He takes so much wood he hooks up a trailer
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:52:43 He’ll have doors and windows
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:52:47 In the back of his truck
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:52:55 His entire back seat
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:53:00 Is usually tools and stuff
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:53:25 So yes one needs a truck
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:53:38 It isn’t a joke
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:54:11 For the amount he does u do
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:54:16 But why
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:54:18 Would u get
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:54:21 A 20 foot
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:54:23 Trailer
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:54:28 When u can get a truck?!
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:55:23 Ur not gonna be able to park anywhere with that on the back
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:55:37 Yea so put a marker on them oh my goddd
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:56:23 Because ur trailer is overly small
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:56:30 Bed*
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:56:40 1998 Chevy truck bed having person
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:57:42 Obviously not
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:57:57 You can’t take that in a truck
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:58:12 20 foot long board when does one need that
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:59:02 Then take smaller boards
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:59:11 You don’t need a 20 foot long board
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:59:25 There’s no use for it
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:00:35 Then why did u say 20 foot long bed
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:00:58 U said cargo bed
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:01:19 Mmmm
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:01:20 Truck
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:01:33 “Truck with a 20 foot cargo bed”
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:02:48 What do u need a 20 foot trailer
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:02:54 That’s a
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:03:03 Transport truck
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:03:06 Thing
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:05:18 Okay I don’t think anyone cares about ur opinion at this point ur pretty much just gate keeping with trucks
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:06:12 Ur not
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:06:15 Ur really not
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:06:36 People can own whatever they want
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:06:59 Man pulling the age card
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:07:09 This man? Truck gate keeping
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:07:40 You ARE
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:08:08 Modern trucks don’t suck
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:08:13 I have
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:08:16 Bigger beds
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:08:32 Prove it
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:08:57 Prove they can’t support as much as ur precious 20 year old Chevy
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:10:45 Yes I do
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:10:53 I’m doing it aren’t I
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:11:32 My dad has moved ATV’s with his truck before and it’s a ford and there have been 0 problems
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:12:26 BECAUSE I DON’T OWN A TRUCK
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:12:33 I’M NOT 18
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:12:55 That’s illegal
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:13:38 It says u need to be atleast 16 in Iowa to drive a car
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:14:34 So
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:14:38 All this more experience
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:14:39 Is
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:14:44 1 years worth of driving
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:15:46 Untrue
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:15:54 I’ve driven a truck before
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:16:04 In an abandoned parking lot
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:16:11 10/10 counts
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:16:27 It’s something though so it’s not none
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:17:11 Or is it
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:19:09 You literally have a single year of driving experience
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:19:23 Not even a full liscense
the-dump 2022-12-20 01:42:56 Yea I’ve operated ATV’s and snowmobiles for years
the-dump 2022-12-20 01:43:28 Of course I can’t I already told you I can’t drive but that is irrelevant
the-dump 2022-12-20 01:53:28 So everyone who can’t drive manual is inexperienced and cannot ever talk about vehicles
the-dump 2022-12-20 01:55:05 Doesn’t mean if you don’t know it you cannot ever talk about vehicles
the-dump 2022-12-20 01:55:16 You don’t need a liscense either to talk about vehicles
the-dump 2022-12-20 01:55:21 You can know about something
the-dump 2022-12-20 01:55:27 Without being able to do it
the-dump 2022-12-20 01:56:28 I think it’s only you
the-dump 2022-12-20 01:58:32 I am willing to bet they wouldn’t
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:05:17 Sounds like something a furry in disguise would say
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:08:05 Certified furry detector
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:08:08 Yes I am
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:08:11 Much experience
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:08:23 Projecting
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:08:27 Entirely projecting
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:08:40 So he admits it
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:08:42 He’s a furry
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:09:13 Joe Biden is a furry
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:09:18 So if ur joe Biden
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:09:23 Can’t
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:09:28 Won’t
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:09:33 I’d go to jail
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:09:42 And then my days of furry detecting would be over
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:09:59 Nuh uh
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:10:05 My job is not to kill any furries
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:10:07 It’s to simply
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:10:08 Detect
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:10:10 Them
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:10:17 Like a sonar operator
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:10:30 No that’s emo
the-dump 2022-12-23 18:08:26 https://tenor.com/view/speech-bubble-png-speech-bubble-gif-26086226
the-dump 2022-12-23 19:43:17 I don’t believe this statistic
the-dump 2022-12-23 20:01:41 Or is it
the-dump 2022-12-23 20:30:26 Prove it then
the-dump 2022-12-23 20:30:54 Prove that atleast 51% of the server members here are furries
the-dump 2022-12-23 20:32:13 Prove that atleast 19466 people in this server are furries
the-dump 2022-12-23 21:04:28 More then half this server is not furries
the-dump 2022-12-23 21:04:50 That would mean more then half of it is
the-dump 2022-12-23 21:04:56 That is what most means
the-dump 2022-12-23 21:05:04 Most = the majority
the-dump 2022-12-23 21:05:19 Majority = more then half
the-dump 2022-12-23 21:05:30 And we’ve established it isn’t more then half
the-dump 2022-12-23 22:33:21 Is illegal
the-dump 2022-12-24 19:37:28 He left faster then a Romanian takes a wallet
the-dump 2022-12-24 20:26:19 aquarium
the-dump 2022-12-24 23:18:43 Never leaving to give you up

the-dump 2023-03-02 00:33:50 I got 0 bingos
the-dump 2023-03-02 00:40:59 the issue at hand:
