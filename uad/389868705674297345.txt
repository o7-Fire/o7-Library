general 2021-10-29 20:55:40 Roblox had a facebook moment
creations-chat 2021-12-14 19:53:12 well i got some pretty bad angles combined with the camo, makes it look worse than it does in person
creations-chat 2021-12-14 19:55:18 i'll repaint it a single color and post it here
creations-chat 2021-12-14 20:12:06 Crude repaint, and the bigger wheels make it look out of proportion, aside from barely fitting
creations-chat 2022-06-18 12:41:45 That was from like 3 years ago lol
bot-central 2022-07-10 13:36:52 That was from when i posted more than 3 years ago lol, every once in a while i get these random underage pins
general 2022-07-20 11:22:19 That was from something I posted more than 3 years ago, I’m well over 13 now
general 2022-07-20 11:22:50 Every now and then someone finds that and pings me lol
