general 2021-05-10 08:33:03 Where can I post my building picture ? ;D
general 2021-05-10 08:33:11 I built a whole starship (SpaceX)
general 2021-07-13 23:09:25 Hi guys
general 2021-07-13 23:13:54 I wish the developers of plane crazy made the rotate ability where u can rotate your build any position
general 2021-07-13 23:14:33 Is any new map comming?
general 2021-07-13 23:16:26 Huh
general 2021-07-13 23:16:42 Um
general 2021-07-13 23:17:29 I wish there was space in plane crazy or bigger and cooler map
general 2021-07-13 23:19:13 Its weard that developers didnt add rotate builds ability tho- 

Cause rotate ability would help soo much cause i know some people and including me that needs to rotate the buildings
general 2021-07-13 23:20:19 Cause shuttle is suppossed to face the sky but its hard to build it like that..
general 2021-07-13 23:21:09 Sorry mate i am not.. english is not my first language lolzz.
general 2021-07-13 23:21:17 Why is everybody so rude..
general 2021-07-13 23:21:35 Lithuanian
general 2021-07-13 23:21:43 And I'm 14
general 2021-07-13 23:21:48 You can hate on me but idc.
general 2021-07-13 23:21:54 Baltic states.
general 2021-07-13 23:22:02 Next to poland, latvia uh..
general 2021-07-13 23:22:54 Rude one üôÑ I just joined and Im kinda not proud about that.
general 2021-07-13 23:23:08 But I still love it..
general 2021-07-13 23:23:22 Yah, it's pretty small state buddy.
general 2021-07-13 23:25:25 Cause it would help a lot of people than building it upsidedown.. I would rather build it normaly and rotate it upsidedown when it's finished.. cause for example space shuttle is facing sky.
general 2021-07-13 23:26:34 I mean I don't mind building it in original position but I would rather have rotating ability than actually building it orginally upsidedown.
general 2021-07-13 23:27:41 Yah, but it's a bit harder making it while it's facing up. I would rather make it while its facing down and then rotate it up.
general 2021-07-13 23:27:50 It takes less time also
general 2021-07-13 23:29:59 Also I kinda have a question. Why did developers make a plot building height limit and like actually really small plots..
general 2021-07-13 23:30:34 I would understand if there was gamepass to make your plot bigger or height limit bigger.
general 2021-07-13 23:31:19 Lol
general 2021-07-13 23:31:43 I think the same but I would be mad if they did it bigger or no limit at all lol.
general 2021-07-13 23:31:55 Or gamepass for that.
general 2021-07-13 23:32:23 I build it actually already today, finished it.
general 2021-07-13 23:32:42 Sadly can't post it here.
general 2021-08-19 22:27:13 I wish they added rotating option
general 2021-08-19 22:27:27 So u can rotate build
general 2021-08-19 22:27:47 Rotate the build not block.
general 2021-08-19 22:28:44 Wdym
general 2021-08-19 22:28:58 U can place seats and then ppl can ride it
general 2021-08-19 22:32:29 Hello devs, if yall are reading this in my opinion i would like to suggest adding this: 
Bigger plots ( it can be a gamepass or anything just pleasee)
Option to rotate your builds.
Space.
Cooler map, bigger map.
I don't know if this is possible but maybe a gamemode where u can spawn alone in a server and u can build your own map.
general 2021-08-19 22:33:10 I cant type there
general 2021-08-19 22:35:37 Yes they can but they cant control
general 2021-08-24 17:14:17 I tought they posted something about pc2

bug-reports 2022-04-15 14:10:40 There is a bug with the jetpack. I haven't really figured out why it happens but it sometimes starts to go up even tho I don't want it. All tho there is a way how to fix it - just equip the jetpack and close the builder menu (Hammer button) And unequip and then equip again and it should work. But I think this should get fixed if it's possible, have a good day and easter üôÇ
bug-reports 2022-04-15 14:12:11 Could I ask what is it or what causes it?
bug-reports 2022-04-15 14:20:34 :/
bug-reports 2022-04-15 14:34:34 I agree.
help 2022-07-12 17:28:52 So I have a build megalodon and it works everywhere fun but not in water. It works everywhere and moves fast and stuff but when it goes in water all motors start to turn very very slow and I also move very slow it's almost like it's lagging but it's not-
help 2022-07-12 17:35:46 Bro..
help 2022-07-12 17:35:54 I'm just asking for help
creations-chat 2022-07-12 17:45:41 Does anyone know why a big build for example: Shark or Ship in water are very slow and the motors are also turning very slow it's almost like it's lagging but on ground it's working perfectly.
creations-chat 2022-07-12 17:47:43 Oh, thank you for the answer, cause I was very confused why my build was so slow in water haha, I hope they fix it cause I spent a lot of time on it.
