plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:15:11 So, I'm trying to make a twinjet, but I just can't beat that annoying "blue and yellow has to be lined up" thing. Can anyone here help me?
help 2019-01-03 21:18:01 Can you guys help me with the "blue and yellow line up" thing?
help 2019-01-03 21:18:22 Here's a better look at the twinjet, in case you need it
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:19:48 Can you guys <#478584971670454284> me with my twinjet pls
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:25:29 Okay, I could really use some help with my twinjet, please?
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:26:38 Trying to get the blue and yellow thing lined up
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:26:45 So it actually works properly
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:26:56 I tried helium blocks, but they don't really help.
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:27:12 If you need a visual, look in <#478584971670454284>
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:28:01 I'll try to add a bit more weight
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:31:43 I got them a bit closer
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:33:02 Okay, uh.
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:33:07 Not working.
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:33:50 I did that a lot.
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:33:53 Didn't really help.
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:33:58 All it did was make it float.
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 21:35:48 I could try to make the plane a bit longer.
help 2019-01-03 21:38:13 So I tried adding weight onto the back of the twinjet.
help 2019-01-03 21:38:15 Didn't really work.
help 2019-01-03 21:38:48 Sure
help 2019-01-03 21:39:55 
help 2019-01-03 21:40:49 In short: The plane won't even take off.
help 2019-01-03 21:41:32 Yeah.
help 2019-01-03 21:41:58 Oh, and here's the yellow blue thing.
help 2019-01-03 21:42:25 I mean, I do sort of want to keep it a twinjet.
help 2019-01-03 21:44:03 I guess I could see how it would be as a quadjet.
help 2019-01-03 21:46:40 Okay, so as a quadjet, it's a lot faster.
help 2019-01-03 21:46:43 But it still just won't take off.
help 2019-01-03 21:50:29 About 130 knots.
help 2019-01-03 21:50:41 That is if the speed measuring thing is knots.
help 2019-01-03 21:52:38 Alright
help 2019-01-03 21:54:25 Dang it, I'll have to finish this tomorrow
