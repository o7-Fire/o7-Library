plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:11:02 Guy turned into a communist
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:11:46 Because
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:12:20 Ok copying a tutorial is cool because it had the owner's permission
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:12:46 But copying the build of an afk player without him knowing is sad
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:14:16 LOL
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:14:42 He's finding ways to advertise via dms
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:14:47 Us

plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:16:40 Even tho it's stuck in that number for a year
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:17:11 Stop denying when you're already caught in 4K
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:17:26 It's like killing someone in front of a cop and saying you didn't do it
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:17:54 Guys send a dislike bomb on his channel
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:18:38 Jesus didn't know people can get this dumb these days

plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:19:35 We have proof
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:19:49 You exposed yourself
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:20:07 boom
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:20:10 That's a lot
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:20:42 In my opinion copying tutorials is alright, but you took it wayyy too far
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:21:16 Guy sounds like a 10 year old here
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:22:24 We have enough proof to possibly ban this guy
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:22:49 In this server
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:23:42 Tutorial plane with an excessive amount of pvp weapons

plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:25:57 O
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:26:00 Server mod
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:26:17 If the owner knows it's fine
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:27:08 It wouldn't if you didn't tell anyone
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:28:35 Let's stop bullying the guy and mind our business, the situation has been controlled by a mod so we have nothing to do here anymore
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:29:12 Ok he's still going with it
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:31:10 I used to copy builds in the past but look where it got me, still unfinished tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:31:41 You don't just copy paste a build, you need to learn a thing or 2 in it
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:32:40 Ok I'll play tds now since I've been playing plane crazy 3 days straight
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:33:26

creations-chat 2021-11-13 07:02:31 Yeah i have been deciding, either go with the tan color like the one in pf, or stick with black
creations-chat 2021-11-13 08:06:38 That's alot of buttons <:how:886142285744599080>
creations-chat 2021-11-18 00:59:59 The iron cross looking button?
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:03:35 If it's garbage then why is it going to remain in service untill 2040, just because it's overrated it ain't bad
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:08:26 If the A-10 is really as bad as you're saying it is, why did the US air force make a lot of variants of it, why are there over 300+ of it in service, and why from the past decades only seven warthogs have been shot down,
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:13:22 Yes i am a military nerd and i am proud of it, also yes the rounds it carries can fuck a tank in a short burst
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:16:15 Do you see how big this shit is?, the armor-piercing round can penetrate armor of up to 69mm thickness. At 4,000 ft range
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:18:24 Youve seen a real one?, God damn I've only seen the spitfire in person
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:21:35 I've only seen tanks from the cold war, not everything but most of them, also it's really annoying how this channel has 2 minutes slow mode
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:23:57 Alright I'm out of here imma go think of something else to build or play a different game for once
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:29:08 I live below a flight path of nearby airports i hear airliners, helicopters 24/7
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:32:18 Funny story about the F-35 "Lightning", it was struck by lightning in flight and needed to land, it landed safely but the damage done by the lightning was so bad it's highly unlikely it's gonna survive another flight
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:36:47 I wonder where that lightning part of the name came from
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:41:36 Ohhhh ok makes sense now kinda
creations-chat 2021-11-18 23:36:44 I like how people can just build good looking stuff and it doesn't need to work just for upvotes

general 2021-11-22 00:59:23 I know
general 2021-11-22 00:59:30 That's why I don't like that game
general 2021-11-22 00:59:41 It became more of a casino than a roleplaying game
general 2021-11-22 01:00:10 Not that much

creations-chat 2021-11-23 01:08:57 I see, well it's probably unnecessary because of how bad i built it
creations-chat 2021-11-23 01:10:59 It really isn't there's just similarities, you know what fine delete for fucks sake
creations-chat 2021-11-23 01:19:46 It's a two seater, and the back is very different from his, and idk if his is a two seater also i have no idea i didn't watch it, plus i know building tutorials is wrong so why would I break it, i am willing to give every proof to prove this is not a tutorial and its just an accident that it looked the same, i will even send a full video of a me building it from scratch
creations-chat 2021-11-23 01:34:57 What's wrong with the nose do i need to remove it because it looks similar to someone's build, i might not be a tryhard builder at this game who builds shit with motorlocking or somethubg like that, but i would never build tutorials because i know i can build stuff alone now, and this is the 3d model i copied does that count as a tutorial?
creations-chat 2021-11-23 01:38:00 What can't i change the fucking color is that illegal to do?, I didn't like the color of the model so i changed it did i break a rule from doing that?
creations-chat 2021-11-23 01:42:54 I wasted 2 fucking days to be called a tutorial, fucking cool dude just fucking cool
creations-chat 2021-11-23 01:46:27 Here full brightness and enhanced you happy now?, I have dark theme on my whole phone on which makes everything slightly darker

plane-crazy 2021-11-23 02:13:07 Dms
creations-chat 2021-11-23 02:18:37 It really is not there's just fucking similarities, this is the model i copied
creations-chat 2021-11-23 02:22:45 So what if the nose looks simiral did i commit a war crime when it looked similar?
creations-chat 2021-11-23 13:04:26 My first motorlock build, wip still, also can someone give me the RGB codes for the camo of the Felon, the pixel camo one because i don't know how to do that, thanks in advance
