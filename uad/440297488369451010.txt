plane-crazy 2021-06-26 00:21:05 How hated on are shredders in non-pvp
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 00:23:11 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 00:23:39 I kinda dislike how hated on they are in pvp cause it's optional to go in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 00:25:13 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 15:21:13 Should I add custom wheels to the Shredder Bug
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 15:21:38 What about wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 15:21:59 Should I add those?
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 15:31:47 Why wasn't that a response message.
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 15:31:58 No
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 15:32:06 No
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 15:32:26 Be mad all you want about shredder I'm not deleting it
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 15:32:37 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 15:33:46 I'm not gonna delete shredder cuz I wanna add custom stuff to it
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 15:34:05 I will use in non-pvp
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 15:35:12 Do people complain about shredders because they get destroyed by them in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 15:35:58 Your'e'nt'funny
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 15:36:39 I don't only use shredders <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 15:36:55 And?
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 15:36:59 What's your point?
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 15:37:31 They're being cucks
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 15:38:01 Like I'm not even using it with weapons
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 19:05:50 How toxic would this be : a robot that grabs vehicles or other robots and breaks them apart with cutters
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 19:15:34 No u
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 19:24:28 Well could I add a piston system that closes around the desired object and add cutters to the locations I would want to do damage?
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 19:25:06 Lifting them would be op
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 19:25:22 Magnets could probably grab
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 19:25:39 That's actually awesome
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 19:27:18 Ghostbusters! there's something strange in the neighbourhood, who're you gonna call? Ghostbusters!
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 19:29:54 Which part is supposed to be urmom

plane-crazy 2021-06-27 04:49:13 My reaction to the funny
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 04:53:19 Dunno want me to check
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 04:54:14 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 04:54:59 Should I make a ground shredder bug or the robot idea from earlier
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 04:55:29 No go fuck yourself
Don't actually do that I was messing around :FineTroll:
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 04:57:02 Did you even read the entire text or stop at shredder? <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 04:57:25 No I don't want to do that, that's gross
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 04:57:58 It changes cause there was a second option <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 04:59:21 ~~I kinda want to make shredder not have a bad appearance in the community~~
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 04:59:36 So should I pick up the robot idea or not
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:00:21 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:00:38 I don't like rockets
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:00:47 They blow self up
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:01:11 Yeah ones without pvp systems
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:01:59 PvP system gets unfair with how fast it can go <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:02:22 I like them cause they go fast
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:03:47 Do people also hate non-pvp shredders
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:03:57 Cause if so zoinks
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:05:21 Ironclad looks awesome
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:06:47 Welp time to go make the magnet robots
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:46:57 
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:47:14 Too many buttons?
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:49:16 ?
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:50:06 Don't ask about the doubles with - and +
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:56:15 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:56:33 Can PC put words as the binds
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 03:36:23 <:empty:794431705070174238>

plane-crazy 2021-06-28 23:25:43 Yosh
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 01:14:08 How does the shredders head movement work? Asking cause I don't fully understand it.
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 01:15:05 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:32:36 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:32:54 This hurts my brain
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:33:33 Chaos chaos!
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:33:58 **metamorphosis**
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:34:39 Why do servers like abusing children <:m_:778994206948589638>
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:35:08 Oh yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:36:00 I'm gonna go try and make a magnet robot again
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 03:39:26 How many wheels on a car is too many
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 03:39:41 Time to add 2000
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 03:40:50 Not even sure how I would add that many in the amount of space I have
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:53:07 Can one of y'all give me a recommendation on what to try and build
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:53:43 Dunno how to build mechs <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:55:18 You talking about the farman f.220?
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:58:55 I might be able to make the funny French plane <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:59:26 How do I make a mech
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:00:38 Sounds simple
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 06:59:17 "What else am I gonna say" maybe the word "okay"
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 06:59:54 No but you could've still said ok or okay
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 07:02:16 Dude you're not even aeronautical engineer II
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 07:02:39 And?
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 07:03:06 No that's you talking about yourself <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 07:03:46 No, I don't think I will
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 07:04:56 Eh
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 07:40:58 Uh oh
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 07:41:10 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 07:41:21 But I reached the billions at the peak
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 01:38:06 Didn't know the height limit for building was a couple thousands
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 01:39:46 I made a plane but it spazzes out whenever I try to go faster than 30 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 01:40:49 How do I stop my plane from spazzing out
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 01:41:55 It isn't even laggy it just freaks out
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 01:42:20 Seems like ip stealer
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 01:43:30 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 01:43:53 Yeah but **mutual friend**
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 01:44:11 Ight
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 01:44:43 Is that a lag generator
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 01:44:49 To the left
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 01:45:31 That's cringe
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 01:46:18 accidentally made a self lag generator with magnets and pistons
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 01:46:57 I bet
