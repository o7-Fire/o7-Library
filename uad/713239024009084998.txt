the-dump 2022-07-05 00:35:46 Minions 2 is the greatest film ever

 The movie Minions, Rise of Gru, is unequivocally the greatest film of the decade, for now I question whether I, and humanity as a species, are worthy of this life changing masterpiece. Immaculate, extravagant, and brilliant are nowhere near enough to describe this film.   This movie was truly encompassing of all emotions, along with profoundly polished animation, near flawless lip-syncing, and subtle and powerful moments of comedy. The scene where the minions comply with a request for peanuts by giving not the bag, but a single peanut, made the theater roar with applause, and led to a standing ovation in the middle of the film. In fact, that scene was a subtle criticism of the current economic "situation" regarding inflation, or shrinkflation, to be more accurate. However, the movie also includes more wholesome scenes, such as when the Minions (very graciously) almost crash an airplane with live passengers into an air traffic control tower.   My first time watching the film, I ended up shaking, crying, and falling over, while the moviegoers around me began chanting pro-gru chants. When I woke up, I ascended to the astral plane and witnessed millions of human lives being saved because of this masterpiece of a film. Thousands of people fell to their knees at various grocery outlets and fast food chains as applause drowned out the ending credits. "Minions: The Rise of Gru" defines the expansiveness of what we as a civilization can achieve if we dedicate ourselves wholeheartedly to our craftz.
general 2022-07-08 16:50:05 yall think in pc2 we should get a longer runway at airport
general 2022-07-08 16:50:15 for more realistic like airline landings for rpers
general 2022-07-08 16:50:21 or just showcase
general 2022-07-08 16:50:39 its very weird when a plane gets touchdown on a runway and just instantly stops
general 2022-07-08 16:50:48 unless the runways got invisible arresting cables or some shit
general 2022-07-08 16:53:32 then yeah but like
general 2022-07-08 16:53:48 wont the plane (depending on it's size and weight) still go over the runway when landing?
general 2022-07-08 16:54:05 i mean if its like a namnam trapdoor plane then it wont happen most likely
general 2022-07-08 16:54:13 but when you have an airliner or smth like an airbus a380
general 2022-07-08 16:54:22 its gonna take a while to stop unless you got thrusters facing backward in there
general 2022-07-08 16:59:38 fair
general 2022-07-08 17:00:31 i men
general 2022-07-08 17:00:34 i mean
general 2022-07-08 17:00:57 inertia exists (somewhat) in one way, when you get touchdown with default gears, you still move because the wheel on it actually moves
general 2022-07-08 17:01:01 instead of being stationary
general 2022-07-08 17:01:11 but its a very small way of having inertia
general 2022-07-08 17:38:17 fuck you
general 2022-07-08 17:39:42 1
general 2022-07-08 17:40:03 ðŸª‘ ðŸª¢ ðŸ˜µ

plane-crazy 2022-10-26 15:22:44 its now fall
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:42:46 plane crazy players using reshade to lower the game quality (they get an extra 5 fps when they spawn their massive motor fold motor lock aircraft carrier)
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:44:03 camera lock?
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:44:28 its at an angle it has to be some type of lock other than normal locks
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:44:39 AHA
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:45:39 easy size to make ro-scale f8/a7

plane-crazy 2022-10-31 17:02:42 i am
plane-crazy 2022-10-31 17:02:45 it was an example
creations-chat 2022-12-07 14:28:05 a lot of the stuff in <#384025409945337856> doesnt deserve as many dislikes as they get the only reason they get that many is because everyone here has such a high building standard or they just dont like certain styles of making planes
creations-chat 2022-12-07 14:33:01 i make all 1x1 planes and plus if you join a good server guarantee you will find at least 1 amazing looking namnam jet
creations-chat 2022-12-07 14:35:14 bro lemme post my ah1z for an example minus the 400 exposed motor blocks
creations-chat 2022-12-07 14:37:17 time to get fucked in the ass by people who think every build HAS to be extremely detailed and not just a fun build to pvp with or mess around with
creations-chat 2022-12-07 14:39:49 dude, pc isnt about extremely detailed planes look at half the god damn builds in <#384025409945337856> their builds have like one color and they get what, 150 upvotes even though its probably smaller than the average 1 block plane
creations-chat 2022-12-07 14:41:53 MOST of them, some are genuinely good yet you say all of them are trash and should be killed
creations-chat 2022-12-07 14:44:26 i have had a lot of friends that play pc in the past and probably have more necessary motorlock and angle lock in their planes than you have on your #1 most motorlocked plane and they make namnam planes
creations-chat 2022-12-07 14:46:30 im not talking about those wtf
creations-chat 2022-12-07 14:51:41 average plane crazy player "im just a casual" my ass wtf thats way better than i could make an f4 look
general 2022-12-08 01:22:45 i just realized i left wtf when did i do that
help 2022-12-08 14:12:11 i hate myself for reading it like potato pototo
the-dump 2022-12-09 15:01:59 there isnt even slowmode
creations-chat 2022-12-12 13:25:56 bit late to the convo, but with enough altitude dont ro-scale jets do that too
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:21:13 no fucking way, based on the announcements/leaks rick has made, he isn't rushing the game, i assume he wants it as polished as possible
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:21:21 before release that is
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:21:28 oh

plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:29:29 wait
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:29:36 if gliding is possible does that mean we'll need a real runway to land big planes

plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:30:37 i think at one point rickje said map would be 12x the size
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:30:39 of the current one
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:30:45 like the main island
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:31:14 that one scene from like pacific rim 2 where they go underwater
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:31:32 wait holy shit
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:31:35 speaking of cars
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:31:41 yall know how most cars are really small
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:31:46 in pc
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:31:51 what if
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:31:56 rickje implemented like small wheels
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:31:58 for cars
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:32:08 like a wheel that had suspension
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:32:14 but fit 1x1
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:32:38 have you ever seen that one guy that uses ball wheels for cars
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:32:44 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:33:44 they will be
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:33:50 shredder bugs will be insanely nerfed
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:34:03 that too
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:34:26 battlebot builders having the times of their lives making battlebots with motherfucking sawblades on them:
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:34:55 i wonder if lag machines will be patched
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:35:05 though i dont really see a purpose 95% of the time it just lags the user of it
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:35:08 not the people around it
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:35:11 yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:35:31 bro outrunning shredders is easy
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:35:34 they all go like 500 speed
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:36:02 ball shredders are worse than shredder bugs in performance imo
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:36:10 i can drive a tank, shredder ball comes in and tries to kill me
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:36:15 i just press f and hes completely dead
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:36:17 no more  cutters
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:36:47 hover drives:
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:37:05 what if
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:37:08 pc2 adds thicker wings
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:37:19 cause irl fighter jet wings arent like a pixel wide
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:37:40 actually wait this will probably be possible with scaling
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:38:01 the tutorial plane getting completely fucked because of that:
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:39:53 wait
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:40:03 waitwaitiwiatiwiati
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:40:12 if the physics are gonna get fixed a shit ton
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:40:15 does that mean......
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:40:22 no motorlocking to put stuff on wings?
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:40:48 and blocks
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:40:50 stuff like that
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:43:14 what if we got different missile times?
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:43:20 types
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:43:22 not times
