plane-crazy 2021-02-05 15:37:26 how do you make a large hovercraft? I tried but it's so unstable
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 15:37:48 It turned into a craft that goes over 700 straight up
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 15:42:01 hmm, I've tried by using 4 panels of tilting rocket thrusters, and propellers to turn, but doesn't really work
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 15:42:40 I saw this incredible design earlier though but don't remember the username of the person who made it besides that it had 'creeper' and 'w' somewhere
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 15:50:33 is there a wayto make an auto-stabalization system?
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 16:19:23 how do you make an actually good guided missile?
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 16:24:40 is there a way to make a steerable, good one that can fit on a small  wing
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 16:31:34 oh propellers work rlly well for it
