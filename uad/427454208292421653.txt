general 2020-06-18 00:05:12 more wedges when
general 2020-06-19 12:01:30 pay2win blocks?
general 2020-06-19 12:01:38 mEmbErship blocks?
general 2020-06-19 12:01:50 wait
general 2020-06-19 12:01:56 would they also be removed from you build?
general 2020-06-19 12:02:00 if you quit boosting
general 2020-06-19 12:02:24 bc if it removes the blocks when you stop boosting that's pretty pointless

creations-chat 2021-04-04 15:05:07 like with Os or emojies
creations-chat 2021-04-04 15:07:24 doesnt wanna go on the sign for some reason
creations-chat 2021-04-04 15:15:00 does this look ok? signs are just getting annoying
creations-chat 2021-04-04 15:18:00 ?
creations-chat 2021-04-05 04:24:06 any advice for my t55e1?
creations-chat 2021-04-05 04:26:28 like what kind?
creations-chat 2021-04-05 12:18:07 <@!763847040190775326>  you should try and get better colors imo
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 12:52:58 im still pretty dumbfounded by the fact that my t55e1 didnt get mass down voted from war thunder players
creations-chat 2021-04-05 13:02:24 <@!723940197456281640> you should try and make the turret fly off with the ammo detonation lol
creations-chat 2021-04-05 13:05:25 id suggest putting rockets (normal for the yellow exhaust) on the top of the turret facing down and add a dissconnector to the turret motor, probably got it all wrong but just trying to help lol
creations-chat 2021-04-05 13:09:49 oh alr
creations-chat 2021-04-05 13:33:00 do horns look decent as ammo/shells?
creations-chat 2021-04-05 13:37:41 or does this look better as ammo? ill find a way to hide the motorlock
creations-chat 2021-04-05 13:49:44 sure? what do you wanna build


uhhh
creations-chat 2021-04-05 13:52:07 kinda boring idea but, what about a sherman?
<@!611251614178869269>  what about a helicopter actually?
creations-chat 2021-04-05 13:54:32 k so you wanna go in a vip or smt?
creations-chat 2021-04-05 14:13:52 wouldnt 4 wings mean more motors/more lag/more parts
bot-central 2021-04-05 16:03:55 -pccmc
creations-chat 2021-04-05 16:21:30 does this ammo look good?
creations-chat 2021-04-05 16:24:05 how do i make it better?

whats a 1/4th circular block then?
creations-chat 2021-04-05 16:30:43 what about this? i can maybe add like a trail in the middle to make it look like its 2 seperate shells

sparkler is a full block <@!630182372444209182>
creations-chat 2021-04-05 16:33:30 kinda like this
creations-chat 2021-04-05 16:38:07 really hope i can get designer III with my T55E1, just need 5 more upvotes
creations-chat 2021-04-05 16:40:25 imo it looks a bit blocky from the front, also the back house part looks a bit weird, try making it flat and adding the helm above it, aswell as putting the stairway to below hull kind of connected to the new flat part and the deck
creations-chat 2021-04-05 16:42:52 kind of like this but a bit further back
creations-chat 2021-04-05 16:54:52 does this ammo rack look better? /:
creations-chat 2021-04-05 16:56:55 not the shells, just the ammo rack box with the Os on it since i cant find any circles that actually work on signs
creations-chat 2021-04-05 17:00:04 does anyone have a circle in text that actually works on the sign?
creations-chat 2021-04-05 17:04:56 do half cylinders look better?
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 17:23:18 why do signs tag like everything
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 17:23:52 yeah, but roblox changed the filter so <13 accounts can say numbers and they still tag it on signs
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 17:24:01 and signs also tag alot of emojies for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 17:24:23 and sometimes it doesnt tag
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 17:24:33 and other times it tags the exact thing that didnt tag last time
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 17:26:07 that meant to be an A-4B?

plane-crazy 2021-04-05 18:49:14 <@!465121200847192075>
creations-chat 2021-04-05 19:01:47 not really tbh, its just super fast and if you encounter it headon chances are you'll kill it since you can MG the gunner and driver instantly and the T55E1s gun takes a while to stabilize after braking
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 19:03:10 alt+ keypad numbers really do produce some weird shiz
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 19:04:54 oh god
