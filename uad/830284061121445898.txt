general 2021-09-02 13:20:35 Oui
general 2021-09-02 13:21:44 The turret is a weird mix of Panther Ausf A and Konigstiger with a Pzkpfw-IV that has a konigstiger barrel with an M48 muzzlebreak..and its disturbing me and most likely will be in my nightmares

general 2021-09-03 17:17:12 So a T-34/85-1945 but with extra steps
general 2021-09-03 17:19:08 T-34-1940(Bolted transmission to the rear)
T-34/76(New transmission and better engine)
Asu-85-T-34/85 but destroyer.
T-34/85(Finalized product)
general 2021-09-03 17:19:55 T-34 1940 had the spare transmission in the back, so it was a german T-34
general 2021-09-03 17:20:11 Why no angled armor.
general 2021-09-03 17:20:52 More angles
general 2021-09-03 17:21:36 The knight gigachad/The T-34/85's with litteral bedframes on them

general 2021-09-04 09:01:21 Yes but what if i used the gun that made *Me* look cool and shot myself with it. Wouldnt it be a cool death?
general 2021-09-04 09:04:27 Huh?
general 2021-09-04 09:18:02 Spy would be a good impostor as he could litterally just sap the ships engines and it would go down. And he also could do that on the generators really screwing it all up
general 2021-09-04 09:18:52 Exactly
general 2021-09-04 09:19:24 And when hes voted out he can deadringer it and bolt outta there
general 2021-09-04 09:20:27 Or he could sabotage the button and not get voted out
general 2021-09-04 09:20:41 Since the buttons still an electronic device
general 2021-09-04 09:21:11 Very true
general 2021-09-04 09:22:39 Oui
general 2021-09-04 09:23:11 Then he could just blane another crewmate saying "I screwed scouts mother so much that scout died"
general 2021-09-04 09:23:32 Which is canonical since he actually does screw scouts mom
