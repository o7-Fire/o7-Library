plane-crazy 2020-07-17 17:08:36 is there no way to mirror your build?
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 17:08:43 mimirror
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 20:22:06 how do you do a fold like this
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 20:22:13 oh i cant paste
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 20:22:20 i see all the videos
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 20:22:31 but i need the seem on the inside of the 180*
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 20:23:00 
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 20:23:01 here
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 20:23:11 i need to fold 2 pieces
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 20:23:29 ?
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 20:26:08 that wont work
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 20:26:21 because then the motor will be outside the rocket
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 20:26:28 i need the opposite
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 20:27:13 how do other people build rockets
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 20:43:25 how do you do a fold but have the motor and stuff be on the other side
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 20:46:05 build mode?
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 20:49:09 how would i build a fold like this so that the motor is inside the rocket when its folded
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 20:50:05 what is that
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:45:48 how do i do a fold like this so that the motor and stuff isnt visable from the outside
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:45:52 its a rocket
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:47:51 can someone help
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:48:29 wdym use cameras
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:48:34 the motor would still be visable
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:48:47 yeah but the motor would still be there
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:49:23 how do other people do it on rockets
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:49:28 do they just have to have the motors visable?
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:49:42 oh
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:49:44 thats sad
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:50:20 oof
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:50:31 looks like Apollo 11
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:50:44 i built the lego model
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:50:52 things huge lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:51:57 there should be some kind of seamless hinge block or something
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:52:20 idk to make it so theres no motor
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 21:52:30 not rreealy important though
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 22:02:48 <@!163143541160148992> i guess i wont post any pictures when its done then
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 22:03:47 well someone deleted what he said
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 16:57:25 im watching this video, why are the blocks rendering like this with a better looking appearance (it was a single color fill paint, not a bunch of slightly different colored paints put on it)
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 16:58:33 oh
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 16:58:41 so theres no way to make it look like that now?
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 16:59:28 oh
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:00:02 i seem to remember something happening when you switched from day to night and back
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:00:10 it made it look similar to that
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:03:40 i like the outlines on everything
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:03:50 the rendering/shading or whatever of the blocks now is just ugly
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:06:15 the blocks kinda seem like the surfaces are lit from all sides or something
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:06:20 or idk
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:06:28 theres something about it i just cant figure out
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:06:51 maybe its the surface texture or something
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:07:19 no thats not what i mean
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:11:27 i wish stuff i made actually looked good
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:12:39 the only thing ive made that actually looks good was a halo elephant
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:12:43 ive never played halo
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:12:46 i have no idea why i built it
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:15:43 what
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:17:44 why is this chat so weird
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 17:19:23 i like building tanks and trains
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 18:20:30 isnt there a way to place 2 blocks in one place
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 18:21:03 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 00:14:12 how do i stop my builds from looking like shit
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 00:25:41 idk how to do that tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 00:26:06 :(
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 00:27:02 this
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 00:27:17 how
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 00:27:56 but every time i build something new it either looks worse or the same
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 00:28:24 lol
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 00:28:43 i was able to build a train that can take corners at 330 speed
help 2020-12-03 22:20:33 im trying to make a turret and i need this hinge to make the barrel longer, but placing the motor down causes everything to wobble
help 2020-12-03 22:21:06 up down left right are fine before the motor (both axis are motor 2 things so it follows your curser)
help 2020-12-03 22:32:44 maybe
help 2020-12-03 22:32:58 but why does placing down a motor at the top of the barrel cause it to wobble
help 2020-12-03 22:33:34 oh and its not just wobbling, its like it dosnt have the energy to get all the way up as well
help 2020-12-03 22:34:13 it only does it when the motor is there though
help 2020-12-03 22:35:44 its perfectly fine when it has no motor on the hinge, when i add the motor it flops
help 2020-12-03 22:35:51 that makes it worse
help 2020-12-03 22:35:55 it wont even move then
help 2020-12-03 22:36:05 i tried adding helium to the end and it wont move now
help 2020-12-03 22:36:32 lemme get a video of it
help 2020-12-03 22:38:11 no hinge
help 2020-12-03 22:38:19 hinge
help 2020-12-03 22:39:20 great
help 2020-12-03 22:39:21 lol
help 2020-12-03 22:39:36 now how am i going to add a barrel to this
help 2020-12-03 22:40:04 that is a motor fold
help 2020-12-03 22:40:09 its whats breaking it
help 2020-12-03 22:40:34 oh
help 2020-12-03 22:40:44 lemme see if it being powered or not does anything
help 2020-12-03 22:41:38 its all at base speed and torque
help 2020-12-03 22:42:37 what the up and down motors?
help 2020-12-03 22:43:54 oh
help 2020-12-03 22:44:13 i havnt even been using it, just having it exist is what breaks it
help 2020-12-03 22:46:14 hmm
help 2020-12-03 22:47:43 it still breaks even with unpowered motors i think
help 2020-12-03 22:48:16 yeah its still broken if the motor is unpowered
help 2020-12-03 22:48:22 actually lemme relog
help 2020-12-03 22:48:27 server might be broken
help 2020-12-03 22:48:29 ill try that
help 2020-12-03 22:51:47 <@!611251614178869269> still broke
help 2020-12-03 22:51:51 it works when the motor is locked though
help 2020-12-03 22:52:35 ill look it up
help 2020-12-03 22:53:48 is this what your talking about
help 2020-12-03 22:53:50 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K848OEofiyU

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 18:54:22 i thought it looked a lot worse
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 18:54:45 :(
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 18:55:28 i have a bunch of different versions that lead up to the cannon one
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 18:55:33 i think i erased them though
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 18:56:13 i posted the basic one in <#384025409945337856>  yesterday and it has 26 upvotes wow
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 18:56:18 lol
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 18:56:48 well at least the cannon one is somewhat good at killing shredders
