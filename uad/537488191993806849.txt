plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:08:32 i found a hacker
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:09:03 
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:09:24 the guy wearing the hat is dogeum, hes also flying cause his avatar is in the air
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:09:33 and lavendar caviar is his friend
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:13:03 lavendar also admitted that he was hacking, but the chat got flooded before i could screenshot
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:13:33 too many messages and it gets moved out
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:13:41 like you cant scroll up anymore
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:14:00 i tried to tell ppl to leave cause hackers can steal builds
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:14:17 but they didnt listen cause the guy was just "vibing"
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:14:18 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:14:23 theres copy scripts
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:14:59 idk
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:15:25 wait did dogeum get banned from the server?
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:15:33 i clicked on his tag and it changed to a different guy
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:16:20 hes still here
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:16:28 thats not good
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:17:22 his friend lavendar is also a shredder user, so figures
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:18:03 yeah ig
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:18:06 but rockets are the best
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:18:24 oh and i already reported so dont worry about that
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:18:41 i actually ran into lavendar like yesterday
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:18:48 he was using the tutorial shredder sphere
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:18:56 and so i blacklisted him and he got super mad
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:19:04 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:19:23 LOLOLOLOL
GGGG
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:24:40 theres only one way to find out
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:36:52 wait what how did you know?
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:36:56 didnt you get banned?
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:37:16 oh wait one of the accounts are an alt
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:37:40 he did say though. he said that you were basically hacking
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:37:57 its hidden somewhere in the chat
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:42:58 well you were hacking anyways, even if i got some things wrong
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:43:41 he was hacking
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:43:46 had a big goat hat
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:43:50 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:44:01 i reported it in the server but i got some things wrong
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:44:09 whatever i guess, he was still hacking
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:44:19 
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:44:43 ok, but there isnt anything in the chat. I only screenshotted for evidence of him hacking and the other guy
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:45:00 thats cap
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:45:09 how would you know unless you were in the server?
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:45:32 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:45:38 there arent two dogeums in the server
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:45:41 im in it rn
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:46:01 they accidentally banned another account
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:46:12 and its a perma ban so you wouldnt be able to join back
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:46:27 i think
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:47:11 <@!466793357318815744> sorry for the ping, but i think you got the wrong guy
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:47:42 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:48:51 sure, but the points would be hard to make
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 03:48:58 unless you go big

plane-crazy 2021-05-06 04:30:38 so he might have linked it to the same acc
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 04:32:32 i want to put my build in <#384025409945337856> but im scared that ill get ratioed lol

creations-chat 2021-05-07 18:29:40 i think the white spots are supposed to be at the top
the-dump 2021-05-07 21:17:28 
creations-chat 2021-05-08 03:58:03 yeah, i figured that i should probably get better at wasd flying anyways, so I changed it to custom aielrons and flaps
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 04:01:43 are there ways to reduce the space of motor lock?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 04:02:13 im trying it and it takes a lot of space
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 04:02:41 ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 04:03:33 what angle are the f-4's wings?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 04:03:55 not the tips, the whole wing
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 04:05:48 oh thats fine
help 2021-05-08 04:11:08 are there any ways i can reduce the amount of space the motor lock takes up?
help 2021-05-08 04:11:13 just looking at it seems a bit too much
help 2021-05-08 04:17:21 actually im kind of stupid

plane-crazy 2021-05-09 00:51:11 look at this guy
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 00:52:30 there will be no trace of him in a few hours
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 00:52:53 boomerboy will vanish from the face of the earth
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 00:58:25 he said he wouldnt lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 00:58:29 but we'll see
the-dump 2021-05-09 01:10:01 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/769761701624545301/840396037415370752/video0.mp4
the-dump 2021-05-09 01:28:55 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWcASV2sey0 i think
the-dump 2021-05-09 01:43:36 it was inevitable
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 02:27:25 propeller pushing it down maybe
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 02:27:38 cause its the only way you can push up or down on command i think
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 02:28:07 you could use any engine, but propellers are 1x1
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 02:32:33 yeah thats the only bad part
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:09:15 i thought it was just a cylinder on a disconnector
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:09:22 but cylinders arent that thin
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:21:53 inertia, the speed of your plane is faster than the speed the firework is launched.
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:22:20 so the speed of the firework is subtracted from the speed of the plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:22:31 but the plane is still faster, so it travels forwards
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:23:04 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:23:24 think of the speed of the firework as like -1 and the speed of the plane is 3
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:23:29 3+(-1)= 2
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:23:39 negative cause the firework is backwards
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:23:52 the speed of the plane cancels out the speed of the firework
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:24:07 i am smart
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:24:25 thank you, but i suck at pc lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:24:50 someone should try it
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:24:51 for science
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:27:39 oh
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:28:02 no evidence for you
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:32:07 laggy computer moment
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:32:55 i can barely get my plane over 600 before having it wiggle like crazy
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:33:05 cause my computer sucks
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:33:29 ur mom
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:33:47 howww??
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:33:51 i need the secrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:35:56 oh i found out how to stop wobbl
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:36:04 moar wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:38:39 yes conveyor engines are ovverated
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:38:50 might as well use hover drive if youre going fast
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:38:52 yea
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:39:37 hover thrusters in front of piston/motor
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:39:46 facing the piston/motor
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:40:17 you also probably need a anchor block attached to a disconnector on the plane though
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 04:40:40 cause hover thrusters are on by default when you spawn in

plane-crazy 2021-05-12 00:05:33 what do you need help on?
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 00:06:12 hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 00:06:19 the front part is like a square
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 00:06:28 so do that first
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 00:06:39 use wedges 1x2 or something for the sides cause its sloped
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 00:07:48 i can see the resemblance
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 00:08:43 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 00:08:47 can you spawn it in?
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 00:08:58 its hard to see the real deal n build mode
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 00:09:06 oh i c
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 00:09:22 make the turret flat
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 00:09:40 you can easily shave off like 2 blocks from the height
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 00:09:58 let me see
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 00:10:28 well thats the tank body problem
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 00:10:55 the side armor for the turet makes it seem wider
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 00:11:01 so ignore that
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 00:11:15 
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 00:13:55 you might have to restart though
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 00:14:06 but as long as you make it better, its worth it

creations-chat 2021-05-25 18:25:37 they look similar because theyre both based on the same thing
creations-chat 2021-05-25 18:29:31 i meant that they look similar cause theyre based on the same thing. just cause it coincidentally looks similar doesnt mean its copied
creations-chat 2021-05-25 18:31:54 Yeah, but it's also weird how some people see things the same way. As humans, its not uncommon to bump heads and do something the same way, but even so, its not copied just because there are some details that are similar.
