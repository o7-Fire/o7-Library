plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:12:51 Does anyone know any suspension designs?
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:13:52 Or what to do when designing the suspension of a car
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:16:03 Currently observing parts of Prototrode's suspension design in an attempt to try understanding some more complicated designs
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:19:12 Well, at least I started with the double wishbone part
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:22:25 Well, I should go ahead and try making a compact one
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:24:19 I feel like I'm gonna have a hard time considering I'm trying to fit it within 5 block width space between the wheels
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:24:44 And the wheels are fabric cylinders
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:49:31 xp
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:53:21 I did the wishbones (albeit with a strange shape due to the space constraints I placed on myself) but after that it's gonna be a lot of reverse engineering stuff

Edit: >_< dang I forgot I was gonna use 3x3 wheels
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:54:48 I feel like I'm gonna frustrate myself a lot in trying to make sure it doesn't move freely like a hinge and actually move like a suspension
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 07:55:27 That's a weird threat
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:02:56 
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:02:56 
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:02:57 
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:03:13 Before I continue, anyone know any methods to make sure these don't move around too freely
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:03:29 Like in the sense that it won't move around like it's on a hinge, but in an actual suspenison
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:03:51 Red - Steering
Blue - The unusual wishbones I said
Green  - Chassis
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:04:07 Still an early WIP
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:07:37 Oof I forgot to check if the wishbones can move, and it can't
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:08:56 I'm confused how as soon as I connect the steering and the wishbones, the wishbones don't wanna move anymore
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:09:53 Once it becomes a single wishbone, it moves again
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:25:43 **aaaahh**
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 08:26:57 Okay, simplified it to this

What's next?
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 09:55:50 <@283153622496182274> I made a wishbone for a suspension setup I'm making
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 09:56:15 Didn't do double wishbone as it was too big for 3x3 cylinder wheels
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 09:56:54 I was trying to make a suspension setup for smaller cars
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 09:57:13 5 block gap between the cylinder wheels
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 09:58:13 Well, can someone explain how are wishbone suspensions built?
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 09:58:42 Because I'm still lost af
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 09:35:03 I feel stupid for forgetting the last bit of <#623337136267067393>
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 09:35:23 Are those 5G towers? XD
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 09:39:13 I'm just confused now xp
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:56:56 Any advice when I wanna make a plane fly?
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:57:26 I already placed a magnet drive engine
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:57:34 Do wings affect it's ability to get off the ground?
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:58:09 So do I give it bigger wings?
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 07:58:51 I have variable sweep wings, but not flaps
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:01:03 
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:01:17 I colored the wings in blue
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:01:43 Using the wings at the back for sharper steering but if needed I'll turn them into flaps
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:05:21 Hmm, okay then
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:05:48 Also just to give visualization on those front wings, they're only about 14 blocks long (not combined)
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:16:15 bouncy flight
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:17:40 nvm i forgot about helium
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:19:40 Oof, I tried putting the magnet drive back in and the magnet drive seemed to have made the ride bouncy
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:21:23 Blacklists are pretty useful, my personal space isn't being invaded
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:25:57 Because it's easy to build
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:26:17 And I honestly couldn't be bothered to learn how to make a compact conyevor drive yet
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:28:49 Nothing's welded but yet it doesn't give a speed boost
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:29:35 I did what you said literally
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:30:36 I don't get how the F-14 Tomcat I made can fly but this one I tried doing myself doesn't
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:31:01 I find it a little funny I keep devolving in functionality
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:33:34 My first plane had a huge rocket engine mounted in the middle
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:33:48 It also had VTOL and didn't rely on having many control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:34:13 Is it because me placing a lot of the engines at the back it's causing problems?
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:35:08 Also on my F-14 Tomcat design I found having the wings swept forward gave it better control
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:35:15 Sweeping it back made it into a glider
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:45:42 Decided to rebuild the whole plane to distribute the weight of the engines in the middle
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:51:59 So...

After the mounting the huge rocket engine in the middle my plane flew better
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:52:36 Placed most of the weight in the middle
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:52:48 And made it have forward swept wings
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:53:00 And somehow it worked
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:53:14 Just need magnet/conveyor drive engines
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:53:25 Cheap solution for speed
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:53:44 Reset your character
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:53:48 That's how I do it
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:55:02 Good thing I wasn't working on something that was very important
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:55:10 Was just building a Corvette C1
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:55:44 Meh, I don't bother
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:57:52 **bruh we hate random people invading our spaces**
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:58:44 <@723419054114865202> Dude, not everyone has robux
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:59:31 **BRUH NOT EVERYONE PLAYS PVP**
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:59:52 Seriously though, PvP's not for everyone
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:00:21 And it'd annoying if a rando decides to use up most of your space
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:00:29 By ramming you
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:02:02 Seriously I find it annoying when people 
- Park their vehicles in my plot 
- Jumping around where its being built 
- Riding in my vehicle like they're my friend
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:02:46 **STOP USING CAPS**
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:03:33 <@723419054114865202> Aight I'm gonna actually listen, how do I get in that free VIP server you just said?
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:03:49 A rank in here?
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:06:15 <@318291033626771457> Tank, roleplaying isn't the first reason people play this game 

The building aspect is, and PvP
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:06:46 I just wanted to point that out
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:06:58 Like I'm just here to build stuff
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:08:34 Anyways gonna figure out how to get a ranj
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:08:38 Rank*
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:10:06 <@451853936815636511> Well, I guess I should complete that ICBM carrier, based on something Russia/Soviet Union built 

I also have a dragon but it's not completely original
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 04:02:14 I just realized the suspension setup I used is basically the Jaguar Independent Rear Suspension
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:28:25 Does a detailed enough recreation of a real car enough to get a rank? I'm building a Mercedes-Benz 300SL
help 2020-07-02 22:32:13 When it said all blocks are connected, can it include doors and suspension?
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:34:30 Private parts and fireworks? Now I see why it's bad
plane-crazy 2020-07-02 22:34:48 oof Discord being buggy again
help 2020-07-06 01:04:09 What to consider when making a fighter jet?
help 2020-07-06 01:05:48 I'm struggling to make it agile in movement
help 2020-07-07 02:39:26 Continuing my question from yesterday, which is how to make planes agile and fast, is there anything else I need to know apart from having plenty of control panels
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:01:49 gonna just wait for plane building advice
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:03:03 There's a lot of tutorials on how to build a specific plane, but not a tutorial where it teaches you *how* to build planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:03:35 It's like the difference between following instructions and teaching you the basics and other stuff to consider when designing a plane
help 2020-07-07 03:05:01 Are variable sweep wings a good idea or not?
help 2020-07-07 03:05:42 Also, what do I consider when designing the shape of a wing and where to place it?
help 2020-07-07 03:05:50 As well as how I'd distribute weight
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:30:54 I'm planning to use conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:31:08 I kinda regret making variable sweep wings, they weren't that useful
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:32:15 The heck the car I built has a lot of downvotes
creations-chat 2020-07-07 03:33:02 oof got downvoted on the Mercedes-Benz 300SL
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 03:39:43 Still finding the video that suits my needs
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 06:50:27 Finally figured out what to do when designing a plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 07:23:11 Does this quote "Simplify, then add lightness" will work well when building stuff in Plane Crazy?
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 07:37:24 So, more like add as much functionality needed, but don't overcomplicate?
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 07:40:45 I've made the plane simple, and it's still pretty good compared to my previous builds
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 07:41:18 Where I made it unnecessarily complex
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 07:46:13 I scrolled up and see 600+ is apparently a decent speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 07:49:56 <@!479784834475229186> Epic that 600+ was for speed of jet planes not torque
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 07:50:09 Sorry if that confused you
help 2020-07-07 07:54:59 ***F i l l   t h e   h o l e s***
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 08:00:10 <@!163143541160148992> Oh, yeah details are good, I just meant it with what's under the hood
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 03:32:10 How hard is it to use locked motors for details on a moving vehicle?
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 03:34:02 Well, the width of the car I'm building is 7 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 03:34:22 That enough space for say something like a Dodge Viper?
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 03:35:56 I'm a bit lost though on how I'll make some decent looking headlights
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 03:37:13 Could search other front engined supercars
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:03:36 <@!409676438682206218> The actual thing, yeah, but the details, well it's my first time doing this so...
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:05:03 The idea is to make a front engined supercar, I was thinking of using locked motors to add more details to the front of the car
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:05:30 The entire front, maybe other sides of the car
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:07:10 That single motor over there is where the locked motors will start from
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:10:58 ~~I really hope I'm not overcomplicating again~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:13:31 I think the best answer for a newbie with locked motors details is to just experiment to see what works
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:13:59 That's what I'm expecting y'all would say would be the best thing for me to do
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:18:55 Well, the car I'm building ain't that large anyways
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:19:30 As you can see in the picture above
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:25:03 <@!163143541160148992> Wait, more space as in space on the vehicle itself or empty space within the plot?
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:31:28 I mean it doesn't look that small
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:43:06 A Mustang truck?
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:43:27 Hmm, hover thruster headlights...
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:44:20 Gonna find other high performance cars
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:45:07 Guess I could start with something like a Dodge Challenger, looks easier to build than a Ferrari 599X
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:51:45 E g g
plane-crazy 2020-07-08 04:52:15 I'm too lazy to make that
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:12:20 Finally had the motivation to try building a larger fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:13:36 And add more stuff too
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:16:57 That reminded me of this one guy who said "amateurs" in the chat
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:17:17 All he did was make a basic fuelselage
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:17:35 Meanwhile I'm building the said plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:18:16 I don't even know how to build helicopters
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:18:53 Wayne built eyesore
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:19:45 Imagine a Minecraft model, but it has the "missing texture" texture
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:20:40 Oh, I use motor 1
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:21:05 Well, if it works then it works
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:21:13 Aight that's fair
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:21:28 Maybe I'll use motor 2 too next time
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:23:21 <@292578772333363200> Dang that car looks like something a 5 year old would do, and even then they'd make it less cringy
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:24:22 It's like he's trying to make it scary but ended up making a child's plaything
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:29:38 Continuing my plans with my plane

Decided to go with a delta wing setup similar to the F-22 Raptor 

I thought of making almost every wing movable, made them almost out of control panels. Planning to add separate motor controlled flapperons, movable tail wings that adjust both to A and D key presses and keys assigned for ascension/descesion, air brakes that also can be used for steering, and vertical tail wings for added control 

The main source of thrust would be from a conveyor drive, and considering it's gonna be a bit large added custom landing gear and a moving canopy

So, are those plans good?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:31:28 I mean, it's a price I'm willing to pay for, unless I end up making over sensitive steering
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:31:34 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:31:53 It worked for the last fighter jet I made
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:32:05 I just added a 0.9 block so the piston doesn't extend on its own
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:34:04 I see your point but it working fine for me to be honest
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:34:32 All I did was add a 0.9 block behind the conveyor, after that I didn't have any problems so far
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:35:27 It's unnatural, but at least I get the one thing I want 

***s p e e d***
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:36:21 Aight then, y'all probably know better than me anyways
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:37:53 I've done before tbh, couldn't remember if it gave a dip in performance or not
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:38:35 That's why I don't go in PvP
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:38:58 I'm more appealed by the building aspect anyways
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:40:11 plane: haha car/boat go boom
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:40:56 Am I seeing a boom tail at the back?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:43:04 Ah, okay then 

I just usually call the tail wings on planes like the de Haviland Vampire boom tails
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:43:32 Also, I don't know how to feel that all it took was this game to give me some interest in planes xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:44:22 Ah crap
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:44:59 My brain still feels like mush
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:45:44 <@387195148741771275> Well I'm a big dumb dumb potato
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:46:22 We're both potatoes
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:46:32 Neat
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:47:29 Also is it just me or are there people intentionally "mass" downvoting other peoples' builds?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:48:58 Well, I shouldn't give a crap about downvotes then
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:51:35 Are there any rules for Plane Crazy's equivalent for self-promotion 

S e l f - u p v o t i n g
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:52:01 Not like making separate accounts, but the equivalent of liking your own tweet on Twitter
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:52:33 If not then I might do that to avoid said domino xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:54:01 It doesn't look bad, honestly looks good
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:54:24 ~~I wonder if it has the S-duct at the bottom of the Eurofighter Typhoon~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:54:36 I mean I've seen worse, which are just modified tutorial planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:55:53 If I'm gonna take a picture of the plane I'm building, I think I'll go replace the control panels with wing panels
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:56:13 And then put back the control panels for the sake of agile movement
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:57:06 Oh, the modified tutorial planes I said?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:57:28 I've seen some
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:58:33 My first fighter jet literally was just a rocket with wings and curved side ducts
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:59:14 Like imagine the Bell X series, with just curvy side air intakes added
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 08:59:59 I accidentally overwritten my first jet a while ago 

I was proud that it had perfect VTOL
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:01:38 I'm happy enough though my first good plane (the side air intake Bell X-1) actually flew pretty agile, and with a conveyor drive that's pretty stable
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:02:16 I have a private jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:02:29 It uses folding for the kitchen and staff room
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:02:37 And the tail end basically
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:03:17 Hmm, pistons make for good sliding doors
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:03:22 Unless it's glass
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:04:40 **To show you the power of flex tape, I cut this plane in half**
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:04:42 XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:05:07 ***B o i***

He needs to get off the sauce
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:05:36 Would a cutter going up then falling down be considered a gullitone?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:06:25 Well, only one way to find out

plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:07:40 Sure why not xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:08:04 ***B I G***
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:08:24 Like that's even bigger than my semi truck
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:08:42 Which is based on conventional cab ones like the International Workstar
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:09:02 I also have a cab over design that looks like some sort of Citroen/Mercedes-Benz hybrid
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:09:42 The Citroen part you'll get when you see the front grille, the Mercedes-Benz part from the water propeller I used for the logo xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:09:53 I am Asian, who builds European stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:10:31 Nah, I'm from the Philippines
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:11:24 Well, I'm gonna go search for *sustenance* 

aka food :>
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 09:11:39 And maybe head over to the land of drama and depression known as Twitter
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:21:26 Well, flight become unstable and it spun
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:22:03 It sorta favors one direction more
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:22:16 So it keeps kinda leaning right and from there just spin and be unstable
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:22:42 I was making a fighter jet for context
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:23:45 <@287779983445721088>, what does it mean if my plane keeps favoring going one direction until it spins or has an unstable flight
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:24:20 Well, how does one achieve stable flight
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:24:37 On a somewhat large plane, enough to fit in custom landing gears
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:24:57 It has a huge delta wing
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:25:03 Two tail wings
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:25:14 Theres flapperons
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:25:25 Both the delta and tail wings can move
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:25:45 I even added canards late into development
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:26:17 Does even a little asymmetry affect flight?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:26:30 O h
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:26:42 Well, my plane has a little bit of asymmetry at the front
help 2020-07-18 12:27:49 My plane keeps favoring one side, having an extremely unstable and unpredictable flight
help 2020-07-18 12:28:07 List me isntructions of what to and what not to do when building a plane, specifically a fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:28:59 Wait did I hear French and German in one sentence?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:29:14 I thought Germany can't get French stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:29:37 Wait it is
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:30:16 Tbh, I was joking about how Germany in World War couldn't manage to hold onto France
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:30:31 You can't
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:30:34 Only blacklist
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:31:27 I don't even know what a swashplate is
help 2020-07-19 06:46:43 
help 2020-07-19 06:46:44 I need help, what's the best wing configuration?
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 06:47:34 <#478584971670454284>I'm still frustrated by the fact it's very sensitive in going up
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 06:48:05 So I decided to not place wings until I get help in what to do when solving that issue
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 06:48:35 As well as to find a way to make my plane not become a glorified fidget spinner
help 2020-07-19 06:48:50 I'm asking for two reasons
help 2020-07-19 06:49:25 1.) For some reason it becomes a glorified fidget spinner when I placed a lot of control panels
2.) It's oversensitive in going up
help 2020-07-19 06:49:30 I'm making my own fighter jet
help 2020-07-19 06:50:04 A little bit, mostly for assisted steering
help 2020-07-19 06:50:35 ^
it worked on my other plane
help 2020-07-19 06:50:49 A smaller (but not modified tutorial plane sized) plane
help 2020-07-19 06:51:57 <@!287779983445721088> This plane has a conveyor drive, yet it works perfectly, in fact more than my previous designs involving locked motors
help 2020-07-19 06:55:57 Honestly during my period of using locked motors, it just felt so sluggish
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 06:56:40 I've never seen outlines on builds
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:01:10 plane go fidget spinner again when engine's at the back
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:01:50 A center mounted one though only leaves me with sensitivity issues
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:02:03 It just feels floaty and sensitive
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:02:31 That was when I reduced the amount of control panels
help 2020-07-19 07:03:36 So, I tried using forward swept with minimal control panels
help 2020-07-19 07:04:01 Now it feels sensitive yet floaty
help 2020-07-19 07:06:08 <@!283153622496182274> I mean that was my first build that actually worked the way I wanted it to (fast and agile), and I kept it simple so I didn't have to bother with headache inducing problems
help 2020-07-19 07:07:15 I don't get how you people build large fighter jets
help 2020-07-19 07:07:24 Yet still make it go fast
help 2020-07-19 07:08:10 So motor locking's better than simply just attaching it to blocks?
help 2020-07-19 07:09:34 Are those motor locked wings?
help 2020-07-19 07:11:05 Bless my rendering distance
help 2020-07-19 07:12:22 I'm gonna continue again when it doesn't feel like I'm gonna have a brainfuck trying to build one
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:12:47 I am mashed potato
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:12:58 really smooth smol mashed potato
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:13:04 filled with fat
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:13:06 from laziness
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:13:39 The only reason I'd want ranks would probably be servers
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:14:36 <@!645128367611445248> Can it be based on something real?
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:14:56 I'm gonna do that so I can get easy in
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:16:14 Wait a fucking minute there's VTOL rank, and my vehicle has 200+ blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:17:37 <@!645128367611445248> What was the minimum again? I have a semi truck that has around 447 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:17:50 That should probably only require a picture
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:18:09 Yeah screw it I'm gonna go with that route instead
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:26:40 <@!468207489524039680> Sorry for the ping

Does `TERRAIN SPECIALIST [I]` require video proof or is a picture/multiple pictures good enough?

All blocks are attached to the build, no locked motors used for appearance too, though it does have functioning doors (via motors) that can lock and the bed can rotate independently (still attached via an unpowered motor) considering it's a semi-truck
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:27:40 Thanks
bot-central 2020-07-19 07:30:39 ?rhelp
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:34:11 Now to wait
help 2020-07-19 07:35:36 I think I'm gonna take a break from this plane up until I get a better understanding
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:36:39 Support's offline though
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:37:06 I'm gonna take note of motor locks
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:37:43 I'm gonna try locked motors again
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:37:55 Maybe I'm just doing something wrong so that's why it wasn't as fast for my first time
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:40:36 <@!287779983445721088> So, locked motors are good

What else am I supposed to know before I build a large fighter jet?
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:41:51 b o i someone copied me
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 07:42:39 This is the kind of stuff that makes me wanna blacklist everyone who randomly comes into my plot
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:06:11 <@!387195148741771275> While I was afk, doing stuff in here in Discord and while my truck was still spawned, I noticed he made a low quality copy (which was the picture I showed)
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:06:48 I shouldn't worry too much though, looks like he didn't take the time to understand *how* it worked
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:07:36 I used bellcrank based front suspension, and what he did was just attach the wheels to motors which were attached to another motor probably for steering
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:07:49 Which ended up not really working for him as it couldn't move
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:09:14 Doesn't seem to talk too
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:10:41 Guessing must be a kid
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:10:52 And if that's true, maybe I shouldn't be that harsh
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:11:39 Let me guess, trolling people? xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:19:29 Just send 'em a rickroll
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:31:44 I've made a Christie suspension
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:31:54 oh neat i got a rank
bot-central 2020-07-19 08:33:45 !servers
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 08:35:02 Ah neat, well I gtg
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 10:57:53 Out of desperation I'm gonna watch some tutorials on some jet fighters
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 10:59:40 Thanks jay
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 10:59:55 I'm currently on one of the VIP servers, I like I'm all alone
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:01:05 So, keep it under 370 parts

Well, this one's more for creative purposes
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:01:26 Though I will consider that when replacing my first good aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:01:57 Well, it just says it's ideal to keep it under those amount
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:02:32 The tutorial just says it's for lag and for making a smaller target
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:03:14 Honestly unless I do go PvP I'm not gonna consider block size for now
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:04:41 <@!287779983445721088> Is it a good idea to use conyevor drives not as the main source of thrust but as after burners?
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:09:07 ***Oh***
My dense af brain thinking it's a good idea to use conveyor drive as a main engine now knows why it's bad
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:12:20 I'm gonna use the F-22 Raptor wing setup
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:16:53 So, any hope for fixing this non-PvP plane?
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:16:55 
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:18:36 By aerodynamics, you mean more advanced stuff?
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:18:48 Like ground effect, how the shape of a vehicle effects stuff, etc.
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:19:16 Ground effect is useful for cars, just look at Lotus's success in Formula 1 before the FIA banned it
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:20:02 I mean there is basic downforce, but it's not really the kind I'd say makes a car less slippery and more grippy, and more like less likely to roll over
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:20:32 I used wings as spoilers on a truck, but it's just an anti-roll over system
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:20:44 Otherwise it doesn't work
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:23:47 I'll go use a tailed delta, maybe combined with a compound delta design
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:24:27 Sorry if I didn't make up my mind, but I think a smaller aircraft's better for practice
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:24:31 Now that I think about it
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 11:28:45 Downforce is good on the track, but not for pure speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:47:57 I followed the video
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:49:06 The fact that I made a barrel roll has convinced me I still have a lot more to learn
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:49:34 Oh, my brothers playing right now
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:50:09 The plane though is smaller for now, as I'm still learning
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:51:01 I'm still figuring out lift (which you've already told me can be done by using locked motors) but hey at least I can spin my plane 360 degrees (the barrel roll I mentioned)
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:52:26 I can only make custom 5x5 circles for my wheels
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:53:34 Well, I procrastinated today and made a flywheel
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:53:44 A thing but with inertia
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:54:30 VIP is nice 

being alone is nice
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:55:11 I mean you could smoothen it out
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:55:20 By yourself
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:55:34 Experiment to see which works
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:55:44 Use half wedges and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:56:04 That's what I did to make custom wheels
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:57:15 Just a 5x5 fabric wheel composed of the different half wedges that's confusingly similar in name
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 12:57:25 Which I used to add custom rims
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:00:19 <@456226577798135808> I see you're into Polandball/Countryballs
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:01:04 Also, seeing there's pixel art, I might think of doing one of Sega's IPs or one of Valve's
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:01:20 Sega has more than Sonic for me to choose from
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:03:56 VTOL also looks possible, that is if I could find a video platform
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:09:38 Let's see...
- Portal 
- Half-Life 
- Team Fortress 
- Sonic The Hedgehog 
- Shenmue 
- Space Harrier 
- Fantasy Zone 
- Alex Kidd 
- Crazy Taxi
- After Burner 
- Out Run
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:09:55 Looks like I have a decent amount of choices to try pixel art on
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:10:24 (Assuming I'm good at it XD, so probably need to learn it first)
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:13:31 <@551573378662662145> A type of webcomic anyone can create 

It involves countries, represented as balls. Do whatever joke you want, whether it's for fun or if it's for educational stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:13:44 There's even videos people have made
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:13:57 oh wait I wooooshed myself
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:14:03 again
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:14:32 I just do random stuff on the internet
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:15:14 I mostly lurk in Plane Crazy (help I'm addicted), YouTube, ~~depressed birds~~ Twitter and sometimes Discord
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:16:18 Honestly this is the only game on Roblox I found to be addicting
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:16:32 And when I am addicted, I don't leave until I'm tired of it
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:17:12 Kinda like Minecraft, I used to play that game a lot but now I just don't have the motivation anymore
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:34:03 <@456226577798135808> Kinda lost the magic ever since Notch was gone
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:34:58 It's still good, Microsoft hasn't failed but it just doesn't feel like it used to
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:35:07 Or maybe I've just missed having friends
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:35:37 ~~My parents don't buy me Minecraft so I have to use cracked~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:35:58 I wish I could buy but they dont
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:36:16 It was later on that I found it was cracked
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:36:45 And considering I was already playing, I've already invested too much time into it
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:37:29 Let's not discuss about piracy here, so let's stop
plane-crazy 2020-07-19 13:50:49 plane go ***n y o o o o m***
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 02:52:23 It finally works!
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 02:52:38 I had to make flaps using motor 2 to assist with lift but it works
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 02:53:39 <@456226577798135808> What's CoM?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 02:54:05 Huge engines definitely have an effect with center of mass
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 02:54:10 What's the blue called again I forgot xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 02:54:43 Oof again they didn't align on my plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 02:55:37 But if it can achieve a speed of 500 (without afterburners) while having yaw, pitch and 360 degrees of roll then I'm happy enough
help 2020-07-20 02:59:22 Anything I need to improve?

The plane relies on flaps to adjust pitch, but it can achieve a speed of 500 without the use of an afterburner (a conveyor drive) and has 360 degrees of roll
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 05:33:16 Replaced every control panel with wing panels, considering every wing in my plane can now be controlled
help 2020-07-20 05:34:21 <@456226577798135808> <@!318892614378061824> Already replaced almost every control panel with wing panels, and almost all of the wings anyways are an aileron
help 2020-07-20 05:37:19 The canards and flaps (both on the back of the body and on main wings) adjust pitch
The main wing itself has variable incidence to adjust roll alongside the tail wings
Only the vertical tail wing doesn't move, but even then it has control panels
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 05:40:11 Reminds me of this meme
**"NOOOO YOU CAN'T DO THAT"**
"haha box go nyoooom"
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 05:40:43 <@!645128367611445248> He got mad, and you're just enjoying flying your box

Every conveyor/magnet drive user
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 05:44:46 Only colors but no texture
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 05:44:53 Kinda like his personality
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 05:55:57 1.) When applying for VTOL, does that also accomplish aeronautical engineer?
2.) Is limited roll counted or does it have to be capable of rolling 360 degrees?
3.) How am I gonna fit a video with the limitations on Discord?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 05:58:54 What the hell happened to that plane

help 2020-07-20 06:47:08 I'm just gonna take a picture of the double wishbone design I have and  let you figure it out from there
help 2020-07-20 06:48:27 
help 2020-07-20 06:48:28 
help 2020-07-20 06:48:46 Ignore the ropes, they're just there for adjusting the suspension on the go
help 2020-07-20 06:49:04 I mean, double wishbones ain't tiny
help 2020-07-20 06:49:18 I could just show you the smaller suspension and rope design
help 2020-07-20 06:52:25 
help 2020-07-20 06:53:32 Blue - Wheels
Red - Steering
Green - Arms (make sure the bottom part is only touching the suspension block and the upper part only the motor 2)
White - Adjustable suspension
help 2020-07-20 06:53:48 Oh, it could be any size you want
help 2020-07-20 06:54:02 I suggest you give it a stiffness of *at least* 20 and give it max suspension height
help 2020-07-20 06:54:14 That's what the ropes there for, to adjust the suspension height without exiting
help 2020-07-20 06:54:36 Aight, good luck
help 2020-07-20 06:58:40 Oh, the suspension and rope setup handles most of the stuff you'll need
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 06:59:46 Do I get aeronautical engineer if I do VTOL?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 06:59:49 Or are those two separate?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 07:00:12 Well, any suggestions on how to share video?

plane-crazy 2020-07-20 07:01:48 I'd rather work out the technical stuff in a small space
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 07:01:59 Than to not have technical stuff but have a lot of building to do
help 2020-07-20 07:02:28 You're welcome, well I gtg
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 08:45:46 Gonna try applying for aeronautical engineer rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 08:46:12 And maybe VTOL I
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 08:47:22 Let me see how much blocks I have on my plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 08:47:39 My fighter jet has about 439 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 08:47:56 So aeronautical engineer II

plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:04:02 I did it
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:04:08 I got both
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:05:25 I got both Aeronautical Engineer II and VTOL I
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:08:34 Why am I having too much fun doing aileron rolls
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:17:24 Taking advantage of how Plane Crazy renders glass behind glass (it only renders the one closest to you), I made the exterior of my plane's cockpit dark while the inside has a clear view (at least when facing from the front)
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:19:55 This looks like the worst way to fly
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:20:26 Crosshair is thicc
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:20:31 And is only made from text
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:21:26 Some rendering bugs (crosshair is still there, hence that glass nub)
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:21:27 
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:22:11 That's the kind of people who need VIP servers
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:22:33 Just wait till they know about the Discord server
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:23:18 Stealth bombers are just flying explosive pancakes
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:23:34 ||please don't get mad at me xp||
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:24:15 Wingplane, now that's definitely a pancake xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:24:32 Because wings are already flat, and plane is almost made of wings
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:25:08 <@!467765396108476426> Look the made the wingplane in real life XD https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:25:50 Bigger plots would make larger builds possible
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:25:59 But larger builds would require more save space
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:26:18 Bigger plots over longer wedges
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:26:35 Now that's what I want
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:26:38 More save data
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:27:11 Save data and plots are what we want
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:27:43 Independent suspension generally should mean that the wheels acts independently of each other
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:28:01 So that suspension I showed could be independent if to each individual wheel
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:28:34 Save data and plot size
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:30:21 So

More wedges (not strictly longer)
Save data
Plot size
Map size
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:31:27 Well, we can only hope one day we get those features
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:31:39 Bigger map and bigger plot are both good
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:31:46 But bigger plot would help out
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:32:18 That 1/4 half wedge but faces outsi- aww
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:32:43 More advanced aerodynamics? (Let me guess hardcoding xp)

plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:39:11 Give me ideas on what to build
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:41:14 Do crankbells make for good heavy duty suspension?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:42:01 XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:43:26 I'mma go make a pull/pushrod suspension, because why the heck not?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:43:37 Or maybe an ATV or a giant lawnmower
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:44:00 Hmm

plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:44:17 I misread that as boombox
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:44:27 Add a speaker and some designs and it'll be a flying boombox
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 09:45:10 Anyways, I'm gonna recreate a pushrod suspension in the game cuz why not

plane-crazy 2020-07-20 12:38:47 Same here, I have no idea how mechs and robots work
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:02:53 How hard is it to make a 3 or 4 fold double floor (partially triple, mostly for the pilot and room for staff) as a private jet?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:03:08 The size I'm aiming for would be like your typical Boeing Business Jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:04:00 Gonna take a picture of the nose to provide a sense of scale
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:05:54 So, y'all think it's possible?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:06:11 Make a private jet of this size
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:06:25 With 3 (or maybe an extra 4th vertical) folds?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:06:35 2 floors (with a small 3rd floor for the pilot and staff)
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:06:52 Those red and yellow blocks are to give a sense of scale of the nose
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:11:50 Btw, the engines I'm planning to make them 5x5
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:11:57 So bless me that I finish this
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:16:03 <@!260797229068058634> Yeah but the size I'm aiming for to reach Boeing 747 size
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:16:10 Not a very scaled down version
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:16:26 Which means I have to make it a widebody with two floors
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:19:24 <@!260797229068058634> *cough* Boeing Business Jets *cough*
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:20:15 To be specific, the Boeing 747-8 VIP
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:20:59 So it's still considered a private jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:21:35 I mean in a literal sense all a private jet has to be is to be private owned (in a sense that it isn't used by the public in the case of airliners)
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:24:37 Blacklist abuse?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:27:19 Now that sounds like abuse
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:27:45 But I think reports are still closed
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:29:45 This engine needs improvements but this looks like it's good enough for 747 like private jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 14:32:12 "We're no strangers to love"
help 2020-07-20 14:33:16 Is it possible to make this kind of plane

Here's the nose for scale
help 2020-07-20 14:33:34 Here's the engine, needs improvements. It's 5x5 in size

help 2020-07-20 14:48:39 So starting at 2.5, with a 5x8 engine got it
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 04:53:57 So Piaggio, the scooter manufacturer
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 04:54:00 Also makes planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 04:54:11 Under Piaggio Aerospace
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 04:55:22 I mean I'm not surprised if an Asian company happens to make a lot more things than what they're commonly known for
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 04:55:26 Just look at Samsung, they make tanks
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 04:55:45 Or basically make up South Korea itself
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:02:56 Some rando: *sees I'm obviously very busy*
Also rando: *jumps around, tries to get an unwelcome ride and other distractions*
Me: *blacklists*
Rando: ***t r i g g e r e d***

How common is this?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:04:29 I've already posted that plane (widebody, 2 floors) I'm building, and y'all can assume that I really don't want any interactions
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:04:58 Not even a simple "hi"
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:05:10 And eventually what I said above is exactly what happened
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:05:20 Got triggered, said "HI IDIOT" and left
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:05:36 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:05:56 Well, there's two kind of airliners, narrow body and widebody
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:06:12 The Boeing 747 is a perfect example of a widebody
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:08:37 xp, no not really
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:09:07 I see that GT-R has some camber on it
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:14:36 So Airbus also makes private jets
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:14:48 Under Airbus Corporate Jets
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:22:05 Afterburners are nice, especially in PvP
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:22:52 I think I'll just wait for the next Winter Event
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:23:00 Because I wouldn't be given robux anyways
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:23:31 ~~speaking of afterburner, that's also the name of a game Sega made~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:23:56 Kinda find it funny someone's trying to get through the blacklist wall via tons of rockets
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:25:01 wat?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:25:31 What do you need assistance with?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:26:06 Should I join you or...
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:26:54 That sounds nice
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:27:02 (Except for the pilot seat)
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:27:52 I probably know another thing that could motivate me in building the plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:27:56 Micromanagement
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 05:28:04 Think of it as smaller separate tasks rather than one big task

plane-crazy 2020-07-21 08:55:44 I underestimated the size of a fold
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 09:00:19 The result of a 2 fold being used on a plane

plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:17:01 Someone made fun of someone by calling them a noob
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:17:12 So I gave them a taste of their own medicine and showed them my own builds
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:17:25 It's funny considering they can only make blocky pieces of crap
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:18:10 Not when your build's buggy
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:18:17 That happened to me, several times
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:18:34 The suspension block is both useful and buggy
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:19:03 Oh it's fine to use the suspension block
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:19:27 Yeah the suspension block is a buggy yet useful item
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:32:34 big wrinkly brain
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:39:16 > what if they made it so the sealed parts of you build are water tight
<@!658774365261004801> Good luck if your build has doors on it, especially ones that either use pistons or motors
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 04:52:23 Why am I imagining zombie Micheal Jackson

plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:26:22 A quick question, any suggestions apart from more engines to gain improvements in both speed and maneuverability with planes?
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:27:34 Also any advice when making wings to improve on flight?
help 2020-07-22 13:28:25 Any advice when designing aircraft?
help 2020-07-22 13:28:36 Thinking of wing configuration this time
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:30:35 How stable are magnet drives?
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:31:25 I saw Integex's video
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:31:41 And I thought "what if I use them on a plane?"
help 2020-07-22 13:32:08 <@280020722431295488> oof no programs  just experimentation so far
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:32:53 More than a comparable rocket engine only plane?
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:33:54 I used one on a large fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:34:06 I ended up being a fidget spinner
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:34:29 Meanwhile on my much longer private jet, it works fine somehow
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:34:53 Which kinda confused the heck out of me
help 2020-07-22 13:36:36 <@280020722431295488> Well considering this is Plane Crazy, any advice if my priority is more on speed and maneuverability?
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:41:52 Press X to doubt
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:58:20 I wonder if wing size and wing shape has an effect on how a plane flies
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 13:59:31 So wider wingspan won't affect roll?
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:00:34 So wingspan and size
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:00:49 I'll take note of that when redesigning my plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:01:44 Does the vertical tail wings at the back have any significant effects?
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:03:51 So, if I were to make the vertical tail wings moveable, should I move them with vertical or horizontal motor 2s?
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:03:59 .
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:05:43 Well, what if the entire vertical tail wing could move? (unless there's no benefits to that)
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:06:48 Easy, but does it have any actual effect on the plane's flight?
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:10:20 A bug
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:10:31 I remember getting that
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:10:41 Except I don't know how
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:11:00 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:11:15 Also, I'm gonna add vertical control surfaces then
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:11:44 I wanna reach supermanuverability
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:11:50 That's my next goal
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 14:12:00 On top of my other project
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:39:51 I'm gonna start my attempt at a supermanuverable aircraft today
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:40:11 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermaneuverability
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:40:36 Or at least something that's very agile
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:40:47 Either goal works out for me
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:41:49 (I just wanted an excuse to improve on building fighter jets)
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:42:58 I'm not even good enough for contests yet xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:43:26 I only have 11 days and 3 hours of total in game time spent
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:43:45 I remember that from yesterday

plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:55:08 Hmm, I'm gonna make a very long delta wing for the aircraft I'm making
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:55:17 So I can extend the control surfaces further
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:55:56 *Is there such a thing as too wide of a wingspan?*
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:56:52 *This wide then*
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 01:57:34 I should probably make the wing fold
help 2020-07-23 01:58:22 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/735676777783099392 I'mma make this wide of a wingspan
help 2020-07-23 01:58:28 But I'll make sure the wings can fold
help 2020-07-23 02:01:18 I'm just making my own jet, I just wanted it to be very agile/very manuverable
help 2020-07-23 02:01:47 The wing is gonna be long, but not trying to make it large
help 2020-07-23 02:15:04 <@!447221768520859659> <@!582834773773254656> So wait, what makes good roll then?
help 2020-07-23 02:16:40 I also see it's just only slightly longer than my current fighter jet's wingspan
help 2020-07-23 02:17:01 But has less wing panels transverse to it's wingspan
help 2020-07-23 02:17:45 This is what I did so far
help 2020-07-23 02:18:21 Hmm, I guess I should experiment a bit then
help 2020-07-23 02:18:46 I'm still gonna use canards and variable incidence delta wings
help 2020-07-23 02:19:53 So large custom control surfaces?
help 2020-07-23 02:20:11 Yep, that's one thing I was told
help 2020-07-23 02:20:15 But for speed instead of flight agility
help 2020-07-23 02:21:24 So
- Hidden wings
- Lots of custom control surfaces
- Don't go overboard with wing size
- Canards and variable incidence wings
help 2020-07-23 02:21:57 Engines?
help 2020-07-23 02:22:17 Well, I guess I'll just go with a slight redesign of my existing plane then
help 2020-07-23 02:22:31 Because it already looks like I've done a decent job
help 2020-07-23 02:22:40 I just need more power and revised wings
help 2020-07-23 02:24:11 For the main wing, looks like I'll just be needing a slight redesign
help 2020-07-23 02:38:34 Triangle Wedge Block in Wedge 2?
help 2020-07-23 02:47:22 I wonder if this would work
help 2020-07-23 02:47:49 The entire vertical tail wing, turned into control surface
help 2020-07-23 02:49:53 I probably shouldn't actually do that, would probably look pretty ugly

plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:46:13 Why do I keep using the regular servers xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:46:19 I guess I'm too lazy to open a bookmark
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:46:30 I use VIP2
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:46:35 Or 3
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:46:44 *It's fun to be lonely*
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 03:47:10 Good for testing all by myself
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:07:43 What would be considered too fast of a roll
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:07:56 I made a plane do a 360 degree roll in about 1.5ish seconds
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:08:28 I've done that, and it was nice
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:10:01 Gonna adjust more settings to give a more sharper pitch control
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:10:44 Canards get 45, variable incidence delta wings get about 15
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:17:15 I've reached a speed of 500 with less engines
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:17:26 So that means I could possibly get a lot more with more engines

plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:45:24 Once I filled the back with engines
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 05:45:34 No motor locking yet, so that should be interesting

plane-crazy 2020-07-23 07:10:55 I prefer using tutorials just to understand the mechanics, and then build my own thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 07:11:23 Besides if I build my own stuff I can fine tune
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 07:11:35 Oh, what I do is just move it up and move it down
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 07:12:10 canards are pretty useful
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 07:12:47 XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 07:13:17 Fr though canards help with flight at least for me
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:04:01 I mean there's American fighter jets
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:04:13 Kinda based the wing design of my current plane on the F-35 Lightning
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:11:50 Someone said they don't know what a plane is
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:12:11 I'm a little astonished
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:13:25 <@456226577798135808> Saab Gripen? Eurofighter Typhoon?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:13:55 I could think of two things
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:14:05 Saab Gripen or one of Dassault's planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:14:09 Unless that plane is also common
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:14:16 In that case go with the Saab Gripen then
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:14:39 Or maybe one of Japan's planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:14:53 Mitsubishi... just modified American jet planes from what I've seen so far
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:18:15 I can think up of a few planes that aren't really common in-game/don't exist
Kawasaki T-4
Kawasaki P-2J
Saab Gripen
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:18:26 Well, planes that much your criteria
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:18:37 Single engine, single rudder

plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:24:09 Also, the red line is where my wings would be, it's currently at 12 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:24:26 It's too small, how much blocks do you think the wings need to be?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:24:48 Wingspan I'll just make it reach block limit or something
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:25:01 But the length transverse to wingspan, how long?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:25:18 Guess I'll just experiment then
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:26:38 18 blocks and still feels short
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:26:41 25 then
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:29:20 25 blocks, nice length (for the wing of my plane)
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:30:17 I remember my buggy, double wishbone

plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:41:34 Wait I forgot I can do another fold for the wings

plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:53:06 (help my sanity wants unexist)
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:53:11 (I'm gonna fold wings xd)
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 08:59:23 This looks like it's enough of a wingspan, isn't it?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:00:14 If this has enough blocks by the time I'm done for Aeronautical Engineer Rank V, I might as well share a video instead of pictures on <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:00:54 Because not only do I have to do the exterior, I also have to do the interior
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:01:50 *Look how large the wingspan of an Airbus A380 is*
https://www.seatmaestro.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Airbus-A380.png
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:02:11 And this thing I'm building, I'm not even sure if it's long enough or not
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:03:05 Looks enough for four engines, but for the actual wingspan, I'll either make a triple fold wing or make reach the end of my plot (horizontally)
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:05:24 I'm surprised I managed to get this far
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:06:05 Guess I'll avoid that then
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:21:57 <@!271299269984518155> "• Do not artificially increase the block count of your creation by placing blocks instead of beams."

Let's say a business jet has an interior (with effort placed), which is caught in video, the video used for proof that the plane meets the criteria said in Aeronautical Engineer in <#609442446249820211> 

That isn't counted as artificially increasing block count right? Plus the windows in the plane I have to place, which requires a row of alternating individual blocks of default and glass blocks

Other than those, I've followed what's said, using beams and longer versions of blocks where it can be placed
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:23:03 Oh, I was just asking before I get a ticket
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:23:10 About certain stuff in a build
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:23:20 Okay let me rephrase
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:23:30 Does the interior count as "artificially increase block count" or not
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:23:46 As well as the windows on a plane, that uses glass and default blocks alternating
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:24:12 Oh good, that relieves me a bit
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 09:24:39 I need a break, I'll go continue the plane later
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 01:40:54 I have some ideas for my next plane
- Concorde
- Tupolev Tu-144
- Boeing 2707
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 01:41:10 All of them are supersonic commercial planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:01:11 wat
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:04:52 Earlier tanks look easy
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:05:10 ~~The Germans have some really boxy tanks~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:08:40 Random brainfart of a question, is the Soviet Union considered controversial here? Or just another meme?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:11:13 But am I allowed to use stuff related to the Soviet Union? (of course there are limits, such as one certain person I shall not mention about)
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:11:36 wait a sec
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:11:40 rick's here
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:11:57 *how did I not notice that*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:12:01 well I am brainded
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:12:20 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:16:42 Probably pickle

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:37:22 Don't take that OOC
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:41:38 oh hi im in the chat
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:41:45 making potato noises
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:44:37 You know what's funny
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:44:54 Someone earlier said leave the server because it's making them lag
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:45:03 And NANI said it's because weak device
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:45:08 Well, look what's happening here now
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:49:12 I'm gonna build a rickroll in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:49:26 ***b o x y   c a r s***
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:49:27 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:49:39 But I'm not gonna make it too obvious
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:49:49 So I'm gonna do some interlacing thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:50:13 gonna use this font http://www.fontriver.com/i/fonts/commodore_64_pixelized/commodore_pixelized_v1.2_specimen.jpg
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:50:23 Old computer, old font
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:53:31 Ah, lava
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 02:58:40 Fighter? During pre-jet or post-jet?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 03:10:38 If rick is rolling, would it be considered a rickroll?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 03:16:22 This is how I'll secretly rickroll people
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 03:16:25 Tell random people there's an optical illusion
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 03:16:36 I just gotta finish the text
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 03:17:30 It may look like a random mess of blocks, but it's actually just text interlaced in a way that it looks like a random mess of blocks
the-dump 2020-07-24 03:19:21 Minecraft's Far Lands?
the-dump 2020-07-24 03:19:51 Well, the closest we'll ever get today is the one in Bedrock Edition
the-dump 2020-07-24 03:19:54 The Stripe Lands
the-dump 2020-07-24 03:20:30 Wait the Far Lands is still in Bedrock?
the-dump 2020-07-24 03:20:37 https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Far_Lands
the-dump 2020-07-24 03:21:04 Well I have a Samsung Galaxy S5
the-dump 2020-07-24 03:21:10 Snapdragon 801, a 32-bit processor
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 03:23:25 The cyan exploding army
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:18:34 I finished my rickroll
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:18:40 Now to test it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:22:47 Finally my rickroll worked XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:23:01 I tricked someone into looking at my interlaced text
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:24:05 Was the company who made that de Havilland? The same company who made the Comet?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:24:12 Or was it another one?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:24:23 *disintegrating airliner noises*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:25:30 I mean anchoring *is* a cheap trick
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:25:44 Well, at least in certain cases
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:25:48 Such as VTOL
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:28:54 Wings look high enough for engine mounts
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:29:31 I mean wings on planes like these are mounted low and slowly raise high anyways
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:30:05 ~~I wonder if it's enough for 5x5 engines~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:34:24 Interesting, the nose of the Boeing 747 is used for storage
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:34:36 Would that be worth the trouble or not to add a nose like that?

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:35:41 It looks kinda weird ngl
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:35:53 haha plane go nom
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:36:08 It's probably not worth the hassle for me to include that
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:36:15 I already used almost all of my plot space
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:37:25 Take note that I already raised this to the height limit, and it has already reached width limit
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:38:12 Probably some kids trying to build something without trying to understand it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:38:58 Box go n y o o o o m instead of flot
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:40:05 Boeing 747 has this much rear wheels https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Boeing_747_main_landing_gear.jpg
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:40:11 I'll cheat and reduce it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:40:22 And use a simplified landing gear design
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:40:36 Because I barely have enough room
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:42:18 Gonna use pistons for shock absorbers
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:42:28 Kinda like the oleo strut suspension used in planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:43:07 I'm also gonna combine regular suspension blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:43:12 To maximize damping
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:49:28 Well, I have no idea what kind of custom landing gear to make
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:49:39 So I'm just gonna go for "cylinder dragging against the ground and hope for the best"
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:03:21 Well, at least the thing works
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:04:16 What the fuck is happening here?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:04:48 <@!707991071476547745> I'm disappointed considering Reshiram is my favorite Pokemon
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:05:30 Just like real life, you gotta take advantage of everything or you'll end up dying in PvP
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:05:47 And these bugs and glitches are pretty useful anyways in the first place
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:06:27 <@!261632279917363200> You haven't seen toxic till you've seen social media
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:06:30 Or the Roblox chat
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:06:53 <@!645128367611445248> You are indeed correct, and not only is that being smart, that's actually how ailerons work
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:06:57 Literally just moving pieces of wing
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:09:42 There is a difference between
"In my opinion, this feature is a bit too overpowered and I would like the devs to nerf this. If you say it isn't, then please explain to me and let's have a constructive conversation instead of a dumb argument"

and

"OMG THIS GAME IS RIGGED, THIS IS CHEATING EXPLOITING AAAA"
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:11:08 <@!163143541160148992> Still, I gotta give credit to *some* 10 year olds using common sense and making use of everything they know and willing to improve instead of complaining
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:11:10 you know, like this guy
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:13:26 ***Resh, just accept this is the state of PvP. It's not only about skill but also taking advantage of everything you can use***

***Besides you can make up for that by being good at building***
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:14:20 <@!287779983445721088> Okay, I'm gonna calm down for a bit
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:15:25 Aight

<@!261632279917363200> Just learn how to use custom flaps made out of motor 2. You already know how to use exploits within the game and it's not that hard to use custom flaps
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:15:50 > PEOPLE LEARN FROM OTHER PEOPLE

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:16:23 *This chat is giving me brain damage*

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:18:32 <@!551573378662662145> Let's just go back so we don't have to see this unfold, this is too much for me

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:29:04 I dunno I'm still tired from whatever happened in this chat
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:29:35 this argument in the chat
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:30:01 I'm gonna go change the topic

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:31:34 ah finally
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:31:40 *c o l m m*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:31:53 2 account?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:31:58 Like you're literally gonna use 2 accounts
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:32:07 I'd like to see that
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:33:00 woah it's large
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:33:11 How is it even attached though?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:33:47 Can that thing actually fly like any other vehicle?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:33:53 Even with the two account setup
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:34:22 I'm just gonna continue making this Boeing/Airbus
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:35:31 wii remote
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:36:04 It's a remote, that's weeing data
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:36:37 How do people make smoke get flung btw?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:36:58 You know those spinning things that make smoke go well, very far in range
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:37:03 How to do it in a straight line?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:37:28 oh wait, this uses much more different stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:37:34 Well crap
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:37:41 I have to wait for the Winter Event
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:37:57 I'm still brainded xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:38:18 oof, the closest thing I can do is color it and adjust some settings
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:38:42 Problem with smoke is it has a short range
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:39:02 I mean I've seen a few times smoke get flung
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:39:08 To a pretty decent range
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:40:07 I'm gonna go take a break from the plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:40:09 And build stupid stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:41:27 am tired
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 08:48:44 Give me stupid ideas

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:26:23 I haven't seen someone build that yet
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:56:08 I have a stupid idea
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:56:17 https://youtu.be/drnxZlS9gyw I watched this video and thought
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:56:32 What if I made an aircraft into an aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:56:44 And added not only aircrafts but also bombs
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:57:04 Sure, as a modification to my existing plane though
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:57:28 Tiny planes go ***p o o p*** out of the jumbo jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:57:47 And jumbo jet go haha bomb go boom
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:58:34 Shredder bugs are flying snakes but much worse
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:59:39 I wonder how forcefields work
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:01:30 Wait, cutters spinning really fast
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:01:46 Well, I did thought of a lawnmower but it's cutter
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:02:01 Now I'm thinking of roller but cutter
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:02:41 Motor spins an axle that has cutters in it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:04:52 Does TNT armor actually work?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:05:30 Hmm, I wonder if I should try PvP some time
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:05:58 It explodes?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:06:13 I'll make a custom tank then
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:06:26 Or some other custom heavy duty vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:07:21 Now I remembered making a railgun 

I'll go take a picture of it and delete it to replace it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:08:18 Well, I've made a huge rail gun 

Well, huge design wise anyways, built for appearance anyways
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:09:05 <@305721738015014913> Make a turret/artillery cannon that fires TNT and cutters
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:09:19 I use magnets
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:09:28 Suspension guns aren't reusable
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:09:36 They're just a one time thing, a disposable gun
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:12:46 So conveyors push the TNT as close to the magnets as possible
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:13:21 And the momentum carried from being moved by conveyors add up to the launch power of the magnets
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:14:16 <@287779983445721088> So, I managed to make after burners "stable"

It pitches up, but only *very* subtly
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:14:34 So I can now reach 1000 with ease
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:15:04 Assuming I'm travelling in a very level direction without any pitch variations
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:15:13 Even going down slows it down
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:16:05 Hmm, if I enter PvP, I might use that aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:16:18 To basically outrun shredders
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:16:50 (Isn't that basically the strategy of the SR-71?)
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:17:40 <@551573378662662145> I mean it could be 

But for me it's so far a hit or miss if it would work or not
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:18:08 The same aircraft I just mentioned got buggy with conveyor drives before I redesigned it into what it is today
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:18:21 Now it only has the mentioned subtle pitching issues
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:19:08 I have a private jet that uses a conveyor drive as it's main engine, and it saved me a lot of effort
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:21:37 <@551573378662662145> https://youtu.be/drnxZlS9gyw Imagine just casually playing the game with your aircraft carrier and these suddenly land after coming out of a jumbo jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:22:18 Ah yes, I was there
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:22:34 This pic though, looks like it's showing dominance
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:22:40 With a T pose
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:23:40 <@467565971918422017> How did you got live footage of my last two brain cells leaving me?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:24:22 Is that what a swashplate is though?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:27:37 Well, now I have an idea for suggestions
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:28:36 How do I suggest ideas?
bot-central 2020-07-24 10:28:51 ?shelp

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:39:40 XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:39:53 Roblox memes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 11:34:43 <#507673335816126509> I have made my first suggestion
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 11:35:14 Is it crap, is it meh or is it decent?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:04:20 Do planes in real life shake from instability?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:04:28 I was reading the suggestions log
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:05:00 Basically, high speed aerodynamic stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:05:55 So in real life, too much speed and the planes gets hot? Nothing aero dynamically affected apart from turbulence
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:06:40 Isn't it related to titanium?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:07:27 Ok boomer
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:08:09 Doge eat froge <@723419054114865202>
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:08:35 ***R e j e c t   M o n k i***
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:08:45 ***B E C O M E   C E L L***
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:09:29 ***reject atom*** 
***become string (theory)***
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:09:46 I can't change your mind, wheels are faster than treads
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:10:13 Oh, I usually go with using the motor belt route
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:10:31 The wheels on the tank stretch the belt
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:11:29 So, if I make a PvP vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:11:34 One, turrets
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:11:39 Lots of firepower
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:12:00 Two, thicc chonky armor and TNT
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:12:12 Three, speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:12:31 Does that sound like a decent formula for land vehicle success?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:13:23 Can't argue with you there
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:13:36 I just prefer the look of motor treads
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:14:13 I've experienced that a lot when my tank wanted to unexist by breaking suspension
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:14:35 It became buggy storm of a mess
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:14:57 I still prefer using suspensions though
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:15:12 Mostly for off-roading
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:15:45 I made a Christie suspension tank
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:16:05 I still haven't finished that Jumbo Jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:16:29 Already reaches well over 2000+ blocks so far, and that's without the interior and engines
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:17:18 Mine is a private jet, so more attention to the interior is needed too
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:17:39 It's also a widebody two floor plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:18:40 Three folds, enough for each row to have 7 seats
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:18:52 But again, private, not airliner
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:19:50 https://youtu.be/drnxZlS9gyw I'm just gonna post this again 

I still wanna fit an army inside of my plane, it just feels so fitting
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:20:21 Of course I'd have to make scaled down versions of vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:20:36 So I have to do tankettes, mini fighter jets and other small vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:21:15 <@456226577798135808> What are those rods sticking out of your ladders?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:21:34 I forgot those exist
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:21:43 I never use trails up until now
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:21:50 And even then, pretty minor
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:22:39 Hmm, on a scale of 1-10 

How good is it to skydrop an army from a jumbo jet?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:22:53 Not for PvP at least
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:23:07 But for its absurdity
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:23:49 Wait a second
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:24:03 An aircraft carrier, carrying a powerful a bomb
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:24:49 Get 2 accounts on PvP, one for a large plane and one for the locked motor bomb
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:25:55 <@237986362601504768> All I do is to experiment around which looks good, also take advantage of Triangle Wedge Block and Triangle Wedges in Wedge 2 for the curves of a plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:26:22 Also, don't use control surfaces, they're crap compared to custom flaps, ailerons, etc.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:28:16 So there's a contest
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:28:26 And one of the choices were rally cars
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:29:03 *unhappy Group B and Dakar Rally noises*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:30:22 That engine is not happy if it's gonna carry too much load though
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:30:57 If the theme for the contest was really cars, I already know some vehicles to buikd
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:32:34 - Audi Quattro 
- Ford RS200 
- Lancia Delta S4 
- Bowler Nemesis 
- Volkswagen Racing Touareg 
- Mitsubishi Racing Lancer 
- Not sure about Dakar Rally trucks
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:32:47 Porsche has participated in the Dakar Rally
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:33:04 BMW has some rally history
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:34:47 i like cars
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 15:34:50 i want sleep
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 03:23:09 I'm currently making the UK's Advanced Passenger Train
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 03:23:25 Specificially, it's tilting system
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 03:24:01 Might use a jet engine like in France's Aerotrain xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 03:27:36 Which one is more correct, the wheels are inside the track (the one on the right) or the wheels are outside the track?
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 03:28:56 I haven't designed any trains yet
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 03:29:02 so i asked
help 2020-07-25 03:32:35 Do the train wheels go inside (right) or outside (left) https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/736424381093511203/RobloxScreenShot20200725_111926084.png
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 06:54:46 Oops I made a minor mistake in my suggestion
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 06:55:01 Nothing big anyways, literally just one typo
bot-central 2020-07-25 06:55:24 No
bot-central 2020-07-25 06:55:28 I've seen that trick before xp
bot-central 2020-07-25 06:55:33 It's an image
bot-central 2020-07-25 07:02:54 No, I already knew what to expect
bot-central 2020-07-25 07:03:07 I mean if I hover over it the white thing at the bottom left corner says it's a PNG anyways
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:07:29 I made two suggestions
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:08:34 In the suggestions channel
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:08:40 <#507673335816126509>
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:08:46 Though I also have a suggestion for you
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:09:43 <@!624733630882643969> Add a block on top of the conveyor, and give some space for the conveyor itself (only the top block touches the conveyor itself)
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:10:00 Oh and the piston
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:10:05 Make sure the piston touches the conveyor too
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:10:07 So only two blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:10:11 One on top and the piston
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:10:19 ~~why do I have a feeling someone's gonna read this OOC~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:14:33 game lag
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:14:44 I'll go log out of discord now
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 07:14:47 .
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:09:45 How common is it for a private (non-corporate) jet to be painted other than white (and maybe a black nose)?
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:10:47 I thought those were glass signs
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:10:59 Also wait fabric panel?
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:11:10 <@!670939038999511041> Tell me more about these fabric panels
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:11:37 Honestly I thought it was a shitpost
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:11:43 So I skipped over it
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:12:07 But if there's something unique, then I'll use it
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:12:53 o o f
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:13:06 Well, I guess I'll just use regular wings then
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:13:25 Way too much?
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 12:13:38 I mean it literally jumped out of existence
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:53:37 That's one trippy camo
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:53:46 Reminds me of that one camo used one ships
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:54:31 Isnt the Berkut one of the few fighter jets with forward swept wings?
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:55:05 I guess the only purpose would be confuse the heck out of others with that paint
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:56:12 How friendly is PC physics with giant planes?
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:57:36 The only thing I know is "haha plane go lift" with wings
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:58:30 Why am I still awake it's 11:58 PM
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:58:51 Philippines
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:59:10 My lazy arse
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 15:59:47 I'll go add rudder and elevators to my jumbo jet tonorrow
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:02:41 Living in S.E Asia, the languages/nationalities I commonly see are 

- Korean (quite common for me)
- Indonesian 
- Chinese 
- Japanese 
- English 
- My own kind
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:03:27 Actually yes I did forget
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:03:44 Philippines
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:04:30 I mean I'm already a potato over here
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:04:36 XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:05:28 Wait a second
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:05:43 fair
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:06:23 ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:06:36 idk, still up to them
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:07:08 I'm just being a sleep deprived human being
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:07:25 Also, wings made out of any material go into the heavens
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:07:37 I tried it with metal and it flew
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:08:03 I have a dumb idea
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:08:11 Wing powered launchers
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:08:36 Fabric wing go ***n y o o o m***
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:08:53 So make anything go ***n y o o o o m***
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:09:11 Also, wings really are capable of flinging things
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:09:31 Shaky wing = trampoline deathtrap
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:09:53 I'm gonna go get off this server for now 

I need ***s l e e p***
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:10:24 Yes that's what I've been doing all day
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:10:30 In bed
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:10:35 Procrastinating
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:10:43 Being a lazy dumbass xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:11:11 Anyways, I better stop talking when I'm still braindead
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:13:05 <@446205377604878336> The heck you've made a suspension block not vertical
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:13:16 I saw it in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:13:29 (I mean I shouldn't be surprised given how buggy it is)
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:13:34 (But still)
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:15:28 ah yes motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:15:33 I forgot about that
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:16:07 Scrolling up now I kinda wanna make a large projectile launcher for no reason
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 16:16:21 As another side project for fun crap

plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:48:56 I tried using conveyor engines in my jumbo jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:49:04 It glitched the heck out
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:49:29 The folds unfolded and it become a glorified fidget spinner
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:49:44 I guess I'll have to use regular engines then
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:49:47 rip my pc
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:50:02 Also, what plane engine should I use for a Concorde like plane?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:50:09 Well, engine size
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:50:55 Well, if in case the conveyor drive bugs out again, then what about rocket engines?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:50:57 Which size?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:52:12 I trust Savoic
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:52:21 I mean he's an expert aeronautical engineer ffs
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:53:51 I just realized I have a bus with 900 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:53:55 I know my next submission is now
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:54:12 wait no it's 699
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:55:11 Hmm, the bus I made has two sections
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:55:16 One that's full of seats
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:55:19 And one that has empty space
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:55:26 What should I put in that empty space?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:56:13 I don't really think lighting is useless, but RGB isn't needed
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:56:27 The fans on the computer I'm using has green lighting
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:56:49 And I don't mind having lights during when it's dark
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:57:47 Give me ideas what to place in this section of the bus
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 03:57:52 I wanna increase block count
help 2020-07-26 04:00:39 What do I place in the back?
help 2020-07-26 04:01:00 Well, I divided the bus into two sections
help 2020-07-26 04:01:15 The one hidden behind the wall is where passengers seat
help 2020-07-26 04:01:22 But the one in the back, I wanted something different here
help 2020-07-26 04:01:38 (I mean there's only so many people that can be in one server so why not)
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:02:06 <@!287779983445721088> Tank has eyes
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:03:55 So there's color roles
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:04:04 What command do I use to get color roles
help 2020-07-26 04:06:45 You just gave me the idea of first-class
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:07:02 Well I guess I better be building that plane then xd
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:07:31 I still gotta solve the issue of the plane bugging out with conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:07:36 Or trying to find a way to reduce lag
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:08:28 I've used a lot of beams and 1x4 wing panels
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:09:25 As you can see, a lot
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:09:42 The interior and rudder still hasn't been done yet
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:10:09 <@!649695489553334314> I mean, I gotta fit that widebody double floor body somehow
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:10:27 While also minimizing block usage
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:12:01 fuck it i'm just gonnna delete the conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:12:21 > <@!649695489553334314> I mean, I gotta fit that widebody double floor body somehow
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:12:47 I wonder how that flew past you
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:15:04 This chat has lost whatever made sense of it
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:23:40 wait what happened
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:26:57 idk why i made an off-roading bus
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:32:12 If they actually landed a jet on top of a jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:32:14 Then congrats
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:35:08 I know what I can turn into a drift car
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:35:16 A Ford Escort/Ford Sierra
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:35:51 Because the Ford Escort has big spoilers
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:36:03 Like it already came with a big spoiler
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:36:24 Well, the Ford Escort RS Cosworth anyways
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 04:38:31 I wonder if a tilting spoiler like the one on the Zenvo TSR-S would work or not
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 05:12:29 <@369303015267631104> That reminds me of something in Marvel
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 05:12:45 All I remember is helicarrier
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 05:13:12 Oh, well if you want then sure
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 05:13:43 Well, have fun then
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:56:25 Well crap, I don't know how to build this car
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenvo_TS1_GT
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:56:32 I feel like I might mess up the proportions
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:57:26 It's gonna be 7 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:57:32 Might use hover thrusters for headlights
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:58:31 I mean there's also the ST1
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:59:02 Well, Wikipedia only mentions it on the ST1
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 07:59:08 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenvo_ST1
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 08:00:38 Just felt it'd be easier to do chonky supercars
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 08:01:29 I mean I could do something based on it but not exactly
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 08:02:02 I wonder if it's tilting spoiler would have any effect at all in this game
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 08:12:25 <@!283153622496182274> Yes

I mean it's still the same chassis
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:08:50 I finally made the jumbo jet work
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:09:39 Well, after using jet engines, rocket engines and a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:09:52 And even then the roll and pitch is pretty weak
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:10:27 The conveyor drive at speed 18 was barely just enough
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:10:39 Once it got off the airport it got around 500
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:10:53 600
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:10:58 Somewhere near that
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:11:23 Oof, I don't even know
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:11:30 All I know it sometimes be like that
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:12:27 <@287779983445721088> Is it fine to use a conveyor drive in combination with regular engines just to get a huge vehicle flying?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:12:54 I kinda went for two main engines
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:13:24 The plane has four wing mounted engines of a custom design
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:14:00 In the custom engines, there's of course a huge jet engine, with super rockets crammed in there
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:14:26 The conveyor drive is the second main engine, which is located at the back
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:15:47 I'm currently redesigning the wings to give it some huge flaps
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:16:03 And bigger ailerons
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:16:26 For now though, I'm taking a break
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:17:40 You know what I don't get, how it's a hit or miss if a conveyor drive becomes buggy or not
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:18:28 It's either fidget spinner or actual thrust
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:20:22 A small question for me to ask
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:21:16 Would it make sense for a non-corporate, private jet to be painted?
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:24:08 Well, I'll go do it then
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:24:12 Plain white is bland
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:24:33 Though I should probably try not to go too overboard
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:24:59 Keep it simple, and the colors not like a five year old sneezed on it
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:25:28 Well, grey's already my typical color scheme
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:25:56 Alongside blue and orange
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:26:48 (I like Portal, and it looked nice so I sticked with grey, blue and orange)
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:27:51 That has the same energy as "it's big brain time"
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:28:24 <@283153622496182274> It's blursed
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:28:27 Arrest me
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 10:29:23 exactly
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 11:55:25 Random thought
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 11:55:39 The weirdest kind of avatars on Plane Crazy are the ones that are all skin
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 11:55:40 Literally
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 11:56:36 For some bizarre reason I also notice this more often on Korean servers
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 12:00:33 I usually just blacklist if they approach too close
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 12:01:47 Roblox avatars in a nutshell
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 12:01:58 They're just weird
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 12:02:11 But in a game like this it's normal for me
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 12:02:38 It's just those that are literally skin is what weird for me
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 12:02:54 Like why would people choose to not have clothes
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 12:14:12 Anyways, I'm lagging now
plane-crazy 2020-07-26 12:14:40 Crappy Philippine ISP + Having Discord and Roblox up
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:04:34 Any ideas what the interior of a private jumbo jet (like the Boeing 747-8 VIP) would look like? Or are they literally just flying houses?
help 2020-07-27 03:05:37 Any ideas what the interior of a private jumbo jet would look like? Or are they literally just flying houses?
help 2020-07-27 03:05:52 An example of a private jumbo jet, the Boeing 747-8 VIP
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:07:01 <#478584971670454284> I'm just gonna wait
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:08:12 <@!658774365261004801> That also sounds like someone in either the furry or anime fandom would say, and I dunno if that makes it worse or not
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:09:32 Wait someone played for that long
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:10:47 I just woke up and forgot that Math exists
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:13:21 <@!658774365261004801> Dang Minecraft back then must be really efficient with that 64 KB of memory, if we assume everyone's using a Commodore 64 back then
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:14:16 I'm gonna go search up pictures of the Boeing 747-8 VIP's interior, as well as their Airbus competitor
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:14:19 I want some references

​
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:19:46 XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:19:50 I used a zero width space
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:19:56 That exists
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:20:08 ​
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:20:17 Copy it
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:20:42 <@!658774365261004801> I just searched up the character and copied it, then inserted it between the @ and username
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:20:51 Rick's not gonna be happy with that ghost ping xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:21:40 XD dang I didn't expect everyone to try doing it
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:21:49 <@456226577798135808> No seriously a zero width character exists
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:22:00 @​rickje139

plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:27:09 Hey Rick look at this @​rickje139
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:27:55 aw rick didn't notice me
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:28:05 Anyways, I gotta go work on my stuff, see y'all later
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:28:16 well, after this
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:28:25 ***P i c k i e   R i c k i e***
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 03:28:38 ***@​rickje139***
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:31:44 I just realized something
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:31:54 I didn't notice my plane's 2nd floor was 4 blocks high
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:32:18 Well, I'm gonna give the 1st floor a different celling
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:32:39 And for the sake of giving it more personality
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:34:12 Actually it's too much work for me xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:34:20 I'm just gonna color the celling of the 2nd floor
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:34:49 <@!287779983445721088> where is da wae
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:36:05 So basically
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:36:07 Increase firepower
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:36:50 You know what I'd play if I had speakers in the game
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 06:36:55 Discord ping
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:55:44 Jumbo jet works, just gonna upload it to Streamable
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:56:30 I mean it's just a meme, it's not like it's gonna hurt you
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:57:00 **Doctor:** "Meme doesn't exist, he can't hurt you"
**Meme:** *exists*
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:58:05 <@!725583147928125461> With glitches, you can
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:58:49 Oh, my game hasn't crashed yet
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:59:21 Oh, I became texture polygons
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 07:59:28 Literally just textureless polygons in the sky

Ah, this is exactly how I do the chassis of my cars
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:03:31 Literally just a backbone with suspension
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:03:40 Then I place a body on top of it
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:08:57 <#384025409945337856> Here's a demonstration of my jumbo jet in action
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:12:20 <@!446205377604878336> oof, maybe I should put emphasis on the video
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:12:49 There, made the font in bold
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:13:38 <@!551573378662662145> I'm too lazy for inventor rank so I just stick with builds

plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:20:34 mad engine?
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:22:27 wait there's an actual mad engine
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 08:22:39 
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:34:47 I don't get what you people want from me https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/737219878666371152
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:35:42 <@!626512383287754763> I agree with you on this one
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:36:49 Like what do I need to be a damn 5 year old and sneeze colors onto a boxy thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:37:14 Actually, thinking about it
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:38:17 <@!447221768520859659> I don't know how to feel about this, you're correct yet I wanna deny this for my own sake
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:38:57 Fuck it I'm just gonna build that car
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:40:07 <@!447221768520859659> Wait that's the Fiat Multipla in a nutshell
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:40:19 Good features, everything went downhill though because of the looks
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:40:42 Everytime I build, I should remind myself the Fiat Multipla exists
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:41:16 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_Multipla
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:41:23 Just look at this thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:42:08 The Fiat Multipla
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:42:19 The successor to this is the Fiat 500L
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:42:29 Like the only reason it failed was because of how it looks
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:43:54 <@456226577798135808> I mean there's this from the page

"The exterior and interior design of the Multipla were displayed at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York during its "Different Roads – Automobiles for the Next Century" exhibition in 1999"
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:44:04 Yes, this is modern art
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:44:51 This quote from the Wikipedia page accurately describes how people felt about it at the time

"The tragedy of the Multipla is that its Elephant Man esque exterior enclosed a genuinely clever and spacious interior, and it wasn’t bad to drive, either. It’s a shame, then, that you’d rather walk than be seen in it."
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:45:30 Now I know how Fiat's designer felt about it xd
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:46:32 I'm gonna go delete this to make room for other stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:46:43 It has no purpose other than firing stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:47:40 Eh, this doesn't look good anyways
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:48:39 And that
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:48:59 I don't even wanna give a shit anymore about it
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:49:06 Especially after that mass downvoting
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 02:49:14 That was just motivational blow
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:11:07 I"ll go look at some screenshots from Forza
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:27:04 Give me an idea for scenery
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:27:08 I'm gonna screenshot something
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:27:48 Oh wait I forgot what I was gonna use this for
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:28:20 
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:28:23 I'm gonna take a screenshot at night
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:29:10 Well, I didn't want a tutorial Lamborghini
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:29:20 So I decided to make one of those chonky European supercars
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:29:35 TVR, Zenvo, Gumpert, those kind of cars
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:29:57 Though I may have taken a bit of styling cues from the Ford GT, mainly with the dual exhaust
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:30:26 
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:31:54 
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:33:33 Stiffness, well it's how stiff the suspension is

Think of this, a softer spring is easier to compress than say a stiffer spring
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:34:08 0% is the equivalent of having no suspension
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:34:41 As for damping, I'm too tired to think about it
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:34:50 I'll just let someone else answer it
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:36:41 I'm just gonna look at the box art of Forza and try making up scenery for it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forza_Horizon_4
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:37:12 And I feel like I should focus on making things look good rather than function only
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:38:07 <@!447221768520859659> So, *how* important are looks in this server?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:41:38 Well, I've got one part right
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:41:45 But the other...
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:44:19 Ah, shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:44:25 The only reason I don't use PvP
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:46:04 <@506566804508770315> I mean what did you expect 

Shredder bug users are the equivalent of trolls
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:47:22 Well, I hope you're ready to deal with raging 12 year olds
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:47:32 We live in a society
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:48:00 ^
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:49:14 You know, I wonder how people in PvP would react to ForkNut
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:49:35 And other negative comments about typical favorites of our naive zoomers
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:53:02 Duck?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:53:10 Did I hear duck?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:53:50 Trying to find the duck meme on the clipboard
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:54:17 Eh screw it I'll just search on YT

plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:56:55 That only Innov. Inc game I played is this
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 03:56:58 PC
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:07:14 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/87/Forza_Horizon_4_cover.jpg I'm just gonna submit something like this in creations
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:07:40 Some natural scenery to complement a submission
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:08:08 <@456226577798135808> Damn that burrito really messed you up didn't it
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:10:22 Which looks better as a road (not highway, but somewhere like in a mountain pass)

Slate or cobblestone?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:11:43 I'll just do slate for the road
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:11:47 With a mix of dirt and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:11:57 Trying to get mountain road vibes
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:12:04 Or something outdoorsy
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:17:34 Would it be a good idea to build Skinner's house? (Steamed Hams meme)
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:17:43 And send it to <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:18:07 People are weird
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:18:31 But what can you do, people be like that
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:21:40 Because paint is life
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:21:45 Downvote bombing, I'm too familiar with that
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:22:01 Let me just grab the link to the last downvote bomb
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:23:08 <@456226577798135808> https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/737219878666371152 I'm wondering how I got 27 downvotes for making a fucking three fold jumbo jet actually fly competently
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:23:25 Most airliners in this game barely get to 2 folds
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:23:40 It's either no fold or 1.5 fold
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:24:09 But hey, if people want memes
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:24:24 Then I'll go build Skinner's house for the sake of ***S t e a m e d H a m s***
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:25:00 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:25:08 Just slap America's flag there and you'll get upvoted to heck
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:25:20 Should I go do that
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:25:24 To see if it actually fucking works?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:27:50 that cockpit is a skinny boi
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:28:28 Pass
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:28:35 ***O h***
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:28:44 That's a good hen tie
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:29:11 XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:29:46 So
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:29:52 ***m e m e s***
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:29:56 That's the answer
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:29:58 To getting upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:30:13 Just make shitposts and I might get upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:31:19 I wonder if we should have a venting channel, to vent about the upvotes and downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:31:36 Like just to release frustration, even if it goes into the void
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:31:41 Where nobody gives a shit

plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:39:17 I would put vector thrusting but that breaks the rules in <#609442446249820211>
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:39:51 Thrust vectoring*

Canards also help
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:39:59 That's why I use canards
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:40:44 <@!447221768520859659> "[2] Plane must use only wings to fly (i.e, don't use engines to control the pitch of the plane)."
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 05:41:29 Wait it doesn't break the rules?

plane-crazy 2020-07-28 06:07:25 I see funnel there
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 06:07:32 Now I'm using Maple Valley Raceway as a reference
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 06:08:05 Except I make it less race track
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 06:08:14 And more like a one way thin road
the-dump 2020-07-28 06:10:03 XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 06:20:54 Well, I guess I'll have to build my own trees then
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 06:21:12 I wonder if a friend of mine is online
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 06:32:38 Oh, I use rocket engines
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 06:33:15 Smoke pipe are one of the blocks you get without a pass
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:00:43 For tank steering I just use two regular motors
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:00:54 For cars I use both
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:06:54 This exists https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Jet

plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:26:32 "THIS AIRLINE BUILDER IS BEING GAY"
boy they went silent the moment I made a comeback
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:27:05 My comeback was "I thought that was your mom"
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:27:16 And then they lowered in quality even further, "your a potato"
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:27:31 So I said "That's because I am"
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:28:19 Honestly fr though I have no problems with actual gay people
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:29:02 The Philippines is Catholic yet being gay isn't rare here
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:29:11 Not even uncommon
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:29:57 I'm gonna screenshot the convo for the meme
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 07:33:17

plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:33:26 What's the RGB code of the grass?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:33:35 I saw what Jay did
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:33:45 And now I wanna apply that
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:33:54 If I ever go PvP
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:35:37 <@456226577798135808> What's the RGB?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:35:56 Well, guess I should experiment
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:36:11 Is it worth going onto PvP?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:37:07 This chat is becoming annoying
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:40:09 Both of you two are noobs, it's not that hard to apply for a rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:40:31 Read it again, slowly
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:40:46 Then apply for a rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:41:04 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:41:11 That white really is off-putting

plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:42:57 Discord has file size limitations
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:43:31 Aight, apply for a rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:43:45 Even Aero Engineer 1's good enough
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:44:53 Just make sure the mods can see it
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:44:58 If you want a rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:45:19 Depends
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:45:35 I mean I literally just sent a picture of my truck and I got a rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:45:53 It's a semi, the one with the chonky hood
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:46:25 But for some vehicles, you need proof
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:46:57 They're not gonna give you VTOL if you don't show them VTOL
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:47:13 Your crack
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:48:04 Alexa's nice, though privacy concerns apply to me
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:49:22 Hmm, should I build a custom armored combat vehicke?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:50:01 Okay, I'll do that then
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:50:34 Though I'll reduce the quality of my suspension to fit in more weaponry
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:50:59 I like planes and cars
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:51:10 Though aircraft has worked out best for me
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:51:37 I'll go do stupid stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:52:04 Here's an easy project, build a fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:54:17 A small fighter jet isn't hard to build, plus it'll teach you the importance of motor 2
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:54:47 Mr. Bean
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:55:04 I wanna see big clock on Big Ben
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:56:08 Here's an unwritten rule of the Internet 

If you two keep arguing just stop and block
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:56:54 This isn't gonna stop until one is tired
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:57:00 So better not waste time
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:57:31 (These two really remind me of Twitter ngl)
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 08:59:28 Well, goodbye
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 09:00:39 <@723419054114865202> Leave this chat unless this crap entertains you 

I'm already tired of it
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 09:01:59 <@287459677611098114> Boeing X-32 but it's on land
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:04:31 Some rando named pyhywong calling people noobs
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:04:34 So I put him in his place
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:04:41 By whipping out the airliner
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:05:09 The *jumbo* jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:06:19 Here it is unfolded
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:06:30 I just need to improve pitching and it'll fly well
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:06:38 Yes, it's boxy
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:06:49 But ***w i d e***
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:07:03 What's even funnier is that he literally only has a fighter jet to show off
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:19:04 XD
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:19:22 <@!645128367611445248> You return to cell
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:19:26 Return to inside human
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:45:17 Improving on my fighter jet again
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:52:15 Reduced width from 7 to 5, consequence being a twin engine is no longer possible and that there'll be only a single rudder 

Made it more curved in appearance, imagine F-35 Lightning II but has the top shaved off a bit and has box scoops (F-14 Tomcat for example) at the side that curves into the body 

Wing setup will mostly be the same, apart from said single rudder and new elevators 

Made it a single seater so no rando can actually ride it
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:54:40 Well, I don't have experience with water vehicles of any form 

For plane locking, well you gotta acknowledge everyone designs their plane differently
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:55:10 Some might have folding wings, some will go for variable sweep and some can't even reduce the space they take up
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:56:08 Well, in that case I can't enter xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:56:26 My planes usually involve variable incidence
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:56:51 That's big
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:57:48 Now I'm imagining a sub carrying parasite fighters (mini fighter jets)
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:57:59 Like the Shinano but modern
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:59:01 ?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 14:59:54 Oh I was searching it up
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:00:05 Google's saying Falken Jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:00:25 Well, I'll try both
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:02:04 https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/ADF-01_FALKEN
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:02:07 This it?
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:03:18 I'm guessing they're AFK, when you said 'alive'
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:03:49 Probably busy
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:04:07 From what I see, you're gonna need a lot of wedges for this plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:05:28 Well, good luck because VTOL in tight spaces isn't what I'd say is easy
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:06:15 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:06:20 It's 11 PM
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:02:40 Tested my new fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:02:48 It can't use afterburners reliably anymore
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:04:26 New
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:04:30 Old
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:05:44 I'm still confused as to how I'd fix this afterburner issue
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:06:07 The old one, it can even use it as a main engine with minimal pitching issues
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:06:22 The new one however, it just wants to die when I use the conveyor drive as an after burner
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:07:50 <@!724461096349728824> Wait who?
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:08:05 Build like who?
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:08:52 Oh, well I just experiment around and see what works, as well as taking cues from existing aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:09:24 Started with a F-35 Lightning II, then sorta drifted towards the Sukhoi Su-33
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:09:51 With a bit Saab Gripen applied to the back
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:10:38 Hmm, I noticed a mounted the conveyor drive afterburner in reverse
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:10:52 I swear if that's what's making it work, i cri
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:13:29 *The reverse mounted conveyor drives were a significant part of making a stable afterburner*
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:14:23 Somehow it makes it more stable, while also reducing but not completely getting rid of the pitching issue
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:16:02 Like imagine the plane is facing like this <. well the conveyor drive faces the opposite direction, like this (1 = conveyor, 2 = piston)

1 2
><
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:16:49 And at speed 25, it gets to speeds up to 1000 while having not enough of a pitching issue relative to the speed I'm gaining
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:17:25 Wait no it goes up to 2100
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:47:51 <@456226577798135808> Aeromorphs.

That's the only answer I have
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:53:26 plane afterburner
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:53:50 I lost control beyond 1000, I feel like I might've broken something
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 03:54:19 Really loses control at 1200
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:00:06 1.5?
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:00:35 Ah, so like the fighter equivalent of those sports cars/supercars that have "backseats"
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:01:11 > More bulgy
You know the rules but I don't

***O W O What's this?***
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:01:37 How have you people not noticed that?
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:02:20 Scalies
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:02:41 I'm surprised I've managed to not get comments about me
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:03:45 Well, it was fun seeing how people reacted to me being a furry
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:03:55 Even though I often appear here in the chat
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:05:35 <@!435946988559925248> Understandable, and I've seen both sides
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:05:54 Both those who just wanna enjoy it and those who just want clout and less SFW stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:06:11 At least in my experience on Twitter
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 04:07:14 Aight, I'mma head off, might bbl
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 09:07:43 Back
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 09:07:57 Oh neat I got Aero Rank V
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 09:10:11 Bacc to blue xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 09:10:48 I was blue before, and I became blue again
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 09:11:24 Well, the next goal is to get the highest aero rank or improve in another rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:42:14 Can the great builders of this server bless me the knowledge of how to actually build something that looks good
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:42:27 I wanna improve on the looks of my current fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:42:40 Even if it means designing a slightly larger one
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:47:13 Well, I'm gonna show the recently finished one and the replacement for it
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:48:47 Well, here's the one I recently finished
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:49:07 
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:49:08 ***A h h L a g***
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:49:08 
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:49:25 And here's the start of another project
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:49:29 My internet connection's lagging
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:50:16 Oh, I use the canards as another flap
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:50:22 You sure I should remove them?
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:50:59 So slanted wings, avoid 1x2+
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:54:25 My current aircraft's 5 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 11:59:44 Well, time to look at some Mikoyan, Sukhoi, Lockheed and Northrop(s) once I get back on
general 2020-07-29 12:05:15 So out of curiosity, I searched up aeromorph in Plane Crazy Community
general 2020-07-29 12:05:32 Is it bad I liked what I saw?
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:23:51 ***g i v e***
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:26:02 Boeing 747 bomber

general 2020-07-29 15:08:34 And I haven't curved the plane yet
general 2020-07-29 15:08:49 Time to curve it to add block count
general 2020-07-29 15:09:00 Because it's already at 3.6k
general 2020-07-29 15:09:11 3 folds

plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:01:53 I almost thought there was a random hole in the tonk, but then it was a barrel
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:02:20 I literally woke up minutes ago
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:10:52 Well, I saw a flying car that had no upvotes at all, only downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:12:05 I'm gonna search up flying car
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:12:19 Because that feels like the easiest way to find downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:13:03 Flying car has 7 - 26
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:13:27 And that was the most simplest out of all them
general 2020-07-30 00:17:25 I have brainfart
general 2020-07-30 00:17:38 https://youtu.be/yThbMcxNf-E
general 2020-07-30 00:18:54 All I could think of are clothes or in game items
general 2020-07-30 00:19:06 Both of which you should spend wisely
general 2020-07-30 00:19:42 I mean if you really want you can get a speaker
general 2020-07-30 00:25:52 I swear one of my neighbors groans like the fucking seagulls from Finding Nemo
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:26:26 I dunno either, try searching experimental aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:27:28 Oof, ekranoplans? That was built during the Soviet Union but I'm not sure if it was ever used in WW2 or not
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:28:11 I honestly am running out of ideas
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:28:19 Wait
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:28:34 Germany has experimental jet aircraft right?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:29:42 Try that, searching if Germany has any interesting WW2 aircraft, whether it be plans, prototypes or something produced in small numbers
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:32:18 I just make the same motor rotate opposite facing propelles blades
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:32:44 And place a counter rotating motor below
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:33:00 ***what is that monstrosity?***
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:33:26 ~~I also have no clue what a swash plate is~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:33:48 Autocorrected
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:34:25 I'm not really into helicopters tbh
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:35:12 Has anyone ever made a pun out of Fokker
general 2020-07-30 00:36:29 All I could think of right now is how Lotus's cars are powered by a V6 from a Toyota Camry
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:36:54 <@551573378662662145> Fok you then
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:36:58 Fokker
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:37:26 <@163143541160148992> Have I seen you before in that ship?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:37:47 That looks too familiar
general 2020-07-30 00:40:10 Toyota can also go fast
general 2020-07-30 00:40:42 Especially with aftermarket stuff
general 2020-07-30 00:41:39 MR2, Supra and Celica are some sporty Toyota cars I could think of, one of them known for the 2JZ engine
general 2020-07-30 00:42:48 <@444476246899032086> Toyota 86
general 2020-07-30 00:43:05 Thats somewhere in between
general 2020-07-30 00:43:18 It's sporty, and also a Toyota
general 2020-07-30 00:44:03 <@444476246899032086> Well, it's not fully a Toyota, because Subaru also sells their own 86 as the Subaru BRZ
general 2020-07-30 00:44:41 Subaru's also known for their engines, cars and also rally history (Subaru WRX)
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:46:29 The ***OWO***mobile
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:46:34 That should be cursed
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:47:05 Or make a furry mech, seeing how the community here reacts xp
general 2020-07-30 00:47:43 ~~You have successfully restrained Shaggy's powers~~
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:48:04 No make Uranus
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:48:19 Thomas The Train is cursed
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:48:34 Imagine going in PvP and seeing that
general 2020-07-30 00:49:18 Hmm, all what's left is PewDiePie and Markiplier to get the YouTube traffic light trio
general 2020-07-30 00:50:20 Markiplier = Red
PewDiePie = Yellow
Jacksepticeye = Green
general 2020-07-30 00:50:44 I call Markiplier "Can't Get Over It"
general 2020-07-30 00:51:04 Watch his gameplay of Getting Over It and Pogostuck
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:52:07 <@163143541160148992> What word is best used when something's both funny and horrifying, the closest I can come up to is blursed
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:52:19 These are blursed
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:53:49 <@163143541160148992> If that's yours, make it poop little trains like a spider
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:41:29 Gonna look up some planes in <#627195143040139264>
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:42:27 Someone made a Waluigi mech
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:42:30 And I'm proud xp
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:44:26 I also see Prototrode was once in this server
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:45:27 Wait for what reason?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:46:12 So, out of curiosity, how does one get into the HoF?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:49:22 Well, if I manage to get 4000 blocks without the interior, I might try an attempt at HoF by converting my jumbo jet into a bomber
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:49:30 Or that one Boeing 747 aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:50:08 For now though my priorities is to make the plane less boxy
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:50:34 Knowing my plane though, the landing gear is gonna affect it's curviness
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:50:39 So it's gonna be more flat at the bottom
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:53:47 I'll go curve it like this
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:54:20 Wedge, then taller wedge
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:57:50 Ah, every vehicle I made https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ec/98/44/ec9844f7adc78b5ca767816c575d25e1.png
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 01:59:57 Volvo actually marketed this way
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:00:04 By being honest
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:00:34 <@!363742162757877761> That did not age well didn't it?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:13:32 <@!335599526414909451>Does a bomber's bombs count as part of a creation or not? I was thinking of converting my jumbo jet into a bomber. What about carrying vehicles inside, such as this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drnxZlS9gyw
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:14:13 I kinda wanted to give <#627195143040139264> a shot ngl
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:14:37 I already made the jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:14:44 Like way too far into it
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:15:22 
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:15:37 No I meant I literally made it
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:15:43 And have spent too much time onto it
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:16:36 wait purified's here
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:17:06 Pure
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:17:15 Does a bomber's bombs count as part of a creation
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:17:24 What about mini planes?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:17:41 Wait even the parasite fighters inside?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:18:41 Ah fuck it I'm gonna try anyways
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:18:58 <@!335599526414909451> What about parasite fighters inside of the plane? Are they part of a build?
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:19:12 Or are they considered separate things
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:19:34 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drnxZlS9gyw ***I'll make this then, slap a camo and call it a day***
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:19:49 Because screw it I've already wasted too much time
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:21:15 If a plane was a Volvo
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:22:37 9 blocks wide and 10 blocks tall inside
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:22:43 I feel like I can definitely place a plane inside
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:25:57 > those sharp curves
👀
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:26:20 Stealth aircraft are sharp
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:27:21 Anyways, I'm gonna attempt to please the builder gods of this server by building what I said
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:28:10 Make them exploding pineapples
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:28:28 Exploding ananas
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:29:31 I wonder how it'd fly though

plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:36:32 I'm gonna take a break and make a fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:36:38 Ground camo on top
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:36:42 Sky camo on bottom
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:36:47 Once I learn how to make camo
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:36:51 With yehudi lights

plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:39:47 So, current improvements I can make
- Appearance
- Stealth
- Weaponry
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:40:19 That too
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:40:32 Well, give me ideas for air intakes
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:41:33 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverterless_supersonic_inlet This is ugly ngl
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:41:55 Well, at least that's what I expect people to react

plane-crazy 2020-07-30 02:42:31 Should I just go for a more subtle intake ramp?

help 2020-07-30 03:19:36 Well, I guess I'll just go for blue on the bottom and your regular old green camo at the top

plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:57:01 The fact that I look up at others builds really means I'm bad at planes
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:57:14 I can make them work but not look good
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 05:57:43 I'm gonna make the air intakes bigger

plane-crazy 2020-07-30 09:35:34 I'm having trouble doing thrust vectoring
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 09:37:17 It wobbles
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 09:37:25 Like it wants to dance
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 09:38:58 I gave one motor an arm, it becomes more stable
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 09:40:16 No it didn't make it more stable
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 09:40:36 I used locked motors
general 2020-07-31 09:30:32 I followed 99eryaydude's advice for the main wing, though for the canards I didn't wanna abandon it just yet

Also, this plane wobbles when I turn. Help.
general 2020-07-31 09:31:09 plane go shake when I turn
general 2020-07-31 09:31:44 So stability issues = not enough wings?
general 2020-07-31 09:32:02 <@!177743269105500160> Odd, my previous designs that use wider wings usually don't do that
general 2020-07-31 09:33:19 This blocky piece of crap is the most stable out of my planes, even with conveyor drives
general 2020-07-31 09:33:52 ~~why can't I combine good building with functionality~~
general 2020-07-31 09:35:26 <@!283153622496182274> Well, in terms of how stuff works, what's good with this blocky grey plane?
general 2020-07-31 09:35:31 (The one I sent)
general 2020-07-31 09:36:01 Yes spooqed, I added an S-duct to the new one with the most cringy camo
general 2020-07-31 09:36:53 wait it's not me
general 2020-07-31 09:37:30 Bless me with the knowledge of how to combine decent looks with actual functioning planes
general 2020-07-31 09:38:34 I verified using my main account
general 2020-07-31 09:40:06 I'm gonna just put 1x2 delta wings on my plane
general 2020-07-31 09:40:42 I thought you meant a new map
general 2020-07-31 09:41:13 anyways gonna redesign my plane wing the lazy way
general 2020-07-31 09:41:24 by making the wings chonkier
general 2020-07-31 09:42:22 also gonna try f-22 raptor wings
general 2020-07-31 09:42:39 Basically just try to transition from my F-35 like wings into something more delta like
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 15:53:10 
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 15:53:20 Is flying grenade less ugly than flying Volvo?
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 15:53:26 If you excuse the colors
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 15:54:14 (I'm already converting this into a twinjet)

general 2020-07-31 15:55:27 Called "Code Monkey"
general 2020-08-01 01:40:51 This section marked red is where I'd place the delta wing, is 12 blocks good enough?
general 2020-08-01 01:41:02 I'm trying to go for the F-22 Raptor delta wing
general 2020-08-01 01:41:15 wait this is the wrong channel
general 2020-08-01 01:41:19 I keep forgetting about that
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 01:41:54 Is 12 blocks fine for a delta wing? Trying to go for a F-22 Raptor like delta
general 2020-08-01 01:44:56 One day old pizza? I'm assuming it's refridgerated

general 2020-08-01 01:45:53 ^
general 2020-08-01 01:46:08 Oh, I usually do that for the cheese
general 2020-08-01 01:46:23 I want my cheese
general 2020-08-01 01:47:06 I dunno, try what works for you

I just find high to be ***aaaaa it burns***
general 2020-08-01 01:48:35 When I microwave my pizza, <3 on the cheese still being stringy or at least good for me
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 01:48:56 I'm just gonna go for 1x2 wing panels, 1x1 looks fugly
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 01:49:24 <@456226577798135808> Show your build, and then describe what's theirs
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 01:59:11 Ah, evil bug + neutral bug
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 06:19:08 Why am I expecting downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 06:19:21 Or am I just being pessimistic
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 06:35:43 Well I was suggested to give my plane the name Wasp
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 06:36:08 I shall give it a bee themed name then, once I think up of what's the best suited one
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 07:47:26 6 upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 07:47:56 Without downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-08-01 07:48:17 Well, that means I'm going in the right direction when building stuff

plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:30:55 Ah, this is why I never decided to do PvP
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:30:59 Sounds like crap
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:31:13 Yes, that

plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:31:45 1.) Don't use realistic treads
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:33:24 I wonder what happens if I typed it in
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:34:36 Why is it the rear wheels that make a car drifty?
general 2020-08-02 00:36:28 What if cutters are heavy, making shredders not useful?
general 2020-08-02 00:37:33 Or what if there's a new wedge that looks like a cutter but isn't a cutter
general 2020-08-02 00:37:56 So builders don't have to get affected
general 2020-08-02 00:38:01 But shredders still do
general 2020-08-02 00:39:20 ~~But what if I were to purchase fast food and disguise it as my own cooking. Hohoho, delightfully devilish Seymour~~
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:39:42 Laser?
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:40:13 Why am I thinking of a laser that reflects off of metal/glass now
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:40:56 Actually wait, a laser that reflects might end up hitting someone else
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:41:26 <@615876745710534676> I just use unpowered motors and fabric wedges
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:42:09 Well crap
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:42:26 There's the budget rope suspension
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:43:01 Literally ropes acting as treads, which I've never used
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:43:06 Because they ugly
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:43:40 Hmm
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:43:45 Why not a half track
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:43:51 Half treads, half wheels

plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:44:18 Conveyor treads are better than rope treads
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:44:34 Like at least they look like treads
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:44:47 Yes they poopoo off-road
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:45:22 I guess ropes would be the only choice
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:45:46 ~~imagine treads but it's suspension instead of ropes and motors~~
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:46:53 <@615876745710534676> I've drifted my cars plenty of times 

That means too much grip on the rear wheels, reduce speed
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:47:46 Irl tho, I think drifting requires that the rear also has plenty of grip
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:48:00 ~~does that mean drifting is just controlled oversteer?~~
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:48:33 Never
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:48:59 I have bumpy but not wrinkly

plane-crazy 2020-08-02 00:50:41 The C stands for carrier ships

plane-crazy 2020-08-02 04:16:46 <@!283153622496182274> That bulbous nose reminds me of one cartoon character

plane-crazy 2020-08-02 04:17:16 Billy from this cartoon
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 04:17:20 That's what the plane reminds me of
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 04:17:42 I loved that show
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 04:17:45 It was my childhood
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 04:20:30 <@!168872475701018624> Have you seen that one episode, where it shows like a backstory of Courage's childhood?

plane-crazy 2020-08-02 04:22:14 I have an idea for a build, a typewritter thing

plane-crazy 2020-08-02 04:31:07 They get triggered when they don't get what they want
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 04:31:22 ~~Wait does that mean some people on Plane Crazy are Karens?~~
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 04:32:00 That Mistubishi is trippy af
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 04:32:09 It looks like one of those 4D things
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 04:34:13 Looking pretty good so far

general 2020-08-02 05:30:03 <@!527653676022628353> Isn't that a plane that can also glide on water?
general 2020-08-02 05:30:24 oof
general 2020-08-02 05:31:02 If I divide 200 by the 26 letters of the alphabet
general 2020-08-02 05:31:08 that leaves me with seven signs per letter

plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:21:55 Simple bus door
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:26:56 I just use pistons for the simpler ones
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:27:05 And 0.9 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:27:14 Some use a combination of motor 2s
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:28:07 I'm just gonna make a modified version of this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplan_Skyliner
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:29:13 yes, I will make a bus
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:29:19 something different from planes
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:29:22 and military vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:29:35 and small cars
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:30:27 Blacklists being invisible behind glass again
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:30:29 just a minor render bug
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:31:33 Even the plot lines went away
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:31:47 But that's pretty easy to replicate so why even bother taking a pic of it
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:32:47 I wonder if anyone's gonna take a ride on Rollover Buses (tm, BlueSeaReptile)
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:33:02 You can guess why I named it that
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:34:29 oof, well good luck getting the length
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:34:52 I wonder if I should redo my dragon
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:35:01 It's an old build, which isn't original either
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:35:35 I'm getting braindamage once I saw you use locked motors on the plane
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:35:43 Because I can't do locked motors on a plane
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:35:45 Only on land
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:36:17 Also, this is where I copied one of my earlier builds, a dragon, from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM5H7HLkkZM
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:36:38 Back when I was new, and didn't knew there was a PC Discord
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 06:37:17 And honestly I'm kinda proud that I was dedicated enogh to copy something that doesn't have a tutorial, but also conflicted by the fact what I've built isn't original
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:33:15 I wanna make a dragon
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:33:22 How is it any different from planes?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:34:21 Like an actual dragon, not a vehicle named dragon
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:35:31 Yes, there's the flapping wings
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:36:29 Not gonna do the serpent kind of dragon
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:36:40 They've been overdone by now
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:37:44 Well, a bird's the closest we'll get to a dragon in terms of how it'll fly
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:38:31 Still better than what I can do
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:47:48 <@!434989303882579981> For a second I thought you had actual tips
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:47:50 and avice
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:48:25 https://emojipedia.org/flag-france/
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:48:36 ~~yes there is an actual emoji encyclopedia~~
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:49:44 Well crap there's no roundel emoji
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:52:46 ***Shinx***
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:52:52 Tell me what I need to know before making the dragon
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:53:39 Well, I was thinking of making the European kind of dragon
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:53:58 Two big wings, four legs, non-serpent like
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:54:46 <@!434989303882579981> Basically, dragon that isn't snake
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:55:29 I wanted to update this build
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:55:34 Because it copycat dragon
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:55:54 So torso first
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:58:18 But are good but what happens if I shot down a mech's leg?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:59:04 You know I have an idea for a flying mech
https://www.gamesdatabase.org//Media/SYSTEM/Arcade/Title/big/Space_Harrier_-_1985_-_Sega.jpg
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:59:16 This is a real Sega game
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:59:41 Would that be a good flying mech to do?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:59:50 Now I also wanna try making a mech
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:04:34 A mech has more parts to repair
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:05:38 A mech would be the equivalent of a twincharged engine, sure it may be state of the art but not only would there be more engineering invovled but it would be a mechanic's nightmare to try to repair it

A tank would be the equivalent of a twin turbo, sure it may not be as advanced but it's easier to deal with
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:06:08 A/C, as in air conditioning?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:06:20 Because all an airconditioner is a heat exchanger
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:08:57 <@!369303015267631104> If one of the wheels broke, it still can move due to the redundant amount of wheels, right?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:09:03 If a mech's leg broke, just one leg
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:09:08 Well I'll let you imagine that
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:11:05 What would be better? An armored car or an armored person?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:11:49 Well I'm gonna leave now
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:12:00 I don't even know if we're talking about IRL mechs or in game mechs
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:20:16 I have an idea 

Merch but it controls like QWOP
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:20:21 Mech*
general 2020-08-03 04:21:06 Aren't hydraulics only linear in motion?
general 2020-08-03 04:21:48 Well, I'm assuming this is real life
general 2020-08-03 04:22:17 <@434989303882579981> Boston Dynamics made a robot that can backflip, but mech? Not really a practical application
general 2020-08-03 04:23:13 Yeah, big mechs aren't even good for backflips
general 2020-08-03 04:23:28 Robots that can backflip, Disney would look to buy that
general 2020-08-03 04:24:39 Battles aren't static, they're dynamic
general 2020-08-03 04:27:18 Problem with mechs is it'd be expensive, not good for mass production
general 2020-08-03 04:29:19 Guns don't do much to a tank
general 2020-08-03 04:30:34 <@369303015267631104> Don't you need like an anti-armor bullet just to get some shots into a tank? Even then it'd be difficult unless you're using some big artilery
general 2020-08-03 04:31:31 Meanwhile, a mech would be extremely heavy just to get the same amount of strength as a tank
general 2020-08-03 04:33:36 Well, let's consider this 

What's better for mass production? Which can provide better protection while offering better firepower and agility/manuverabulity?
general 2020-08-03 04:34:09 A tank satisfies those requirements
general 2020-08-03 04:34:57 So a quadripedal mech?
general 2020-08-03 04:36:13 Still, it'd be more of a hassle to repair wouldn't it? Plus the costs of manufacturing it? And generally trying to bear the weight of the tank itself
general 2020-08-03 04:36:25 This is why we don't see legs on cars
general 2020-08-03 04:37:16 Wheels are faster and would handle the load better without being overcomplicated and overpriced

general 2020-08-03 04:42:42 <@369303015267631104> Also for cargo, that's one of the reasons suspension exists
general 2020-08-03 04:43:31 Just a question, how good is the HAL Tejas?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:44:42 What's everyone's opinion on India's HAL Tejas?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:45:08 I'm lagging
general 2020-08-03 06:21:45 <@!369303015267631104> Discord mobile bugged out for me

Could be any kind of suspension, as long as it's designed to cope with the heavy weight
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 06:22:33 Should I make a supersonic bomber or just a regular modern subsonic bomber?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 06:23:34 wait a supersonic bomber actually exists
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 06:23:41 Well I know what I'm doing now
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 06:33:40 I wonder if I could get away with using the variable sweep wings for further pitch control

plane-crazy 2020-08-03 06:34:57 I see little canards, some room for the wings to change it's sweep
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 06:35:24 And hopefully isn't overused like the A-10 or the B-2 Spirit
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 06:51:50 Why is there a giant confederate flag

plane-crazy 2020-08-03 09:43:25 I'm just gonna view it
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 09:44:11 Like in my head "Why would I wait to install something I'm not gonna even use often" when I can just use this app that came with Windows to view that B-1 Lancer
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 09:44:16 Unless it's an online thing
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 09:44:54 <@!723419054114865202> For a second I thought it was a download, I was wrong
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 09:45:24 Well, I did what I could for the glass cockpit
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 09:45:37 Though I feel like I could still make the line thinner
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 09:46:33 "Has a nice sliding motion"
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 09:46:36 I made it sound wrong
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 09:46:54 ~~Messing with people is fun xp~~
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 09:47:54 Looks like I was on the right track with the nose
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 09:48:04 Because the B-1 gets progressively wider
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 09:48:15 Nice curvature
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 09:48:20 wait
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 09:48:24 why did that sounded wrong now
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 11:58:56 I might have to use folding on the wings, which isn't a problem for me
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 11:59:06 Also for those of you who like curvy bodies
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 11:59:28 Yeah thought so
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:00:17 That's gonna be easier to fix though compared to if I did the proportions wrong (on the whole body, not just part of it)
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:00:33 At that point I'd just screw it and make it the final product
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:03:04 Ah, hypocrisy at it's finest
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:20:06 <@456226577798135808> Wait a second 

Is that what I think it is? Glass of juice?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:20:35 Well
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:20:43 Is this in PvP?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:21:38 If I remember isn't that in settings?
general 2020-08-03 12:22:40 A Lamborghini going off-road
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:23:04 Why are Bugattis and Lamborghinis common in this game
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:23:13 Apart from being the favorite cars of edgy kids
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:23:28 And the fact that they're tutorial builds
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:32:25 Well, I don't even know what a swashplate is
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:32:34 So I'm gonna search it up on Wikipedia
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:34:50 Ah, noted
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:34:58 I just play with wedges
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:35:10 Wedge 2 is my friend
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:35:24 There is never enough wedges
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:35:37 ~~I wonder if Rick will add a custom wedge tool xp~~
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:37:16 Imagine someone making an overly complicated curved wedge just to mess with people by forcing their device to render too much polygons
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:38:02 1939 bad word, let me guess it's the bad guy leader's regime?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:38:33 wait
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:38:47 It's real
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:43:30 I just remembered why I didn't do thrust vectoring
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:43:45 "haha engine go wobble"
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 12:44:14 Don't know why how it takes only 2 motors to make motor locked engine wobble intensely
general 2020-08-03 12:49:26 The keys to success in <#384025409945337856> 
- ***c u r v y*** 
- Functional 
- Good paint
- Not overused (I.E, not an A-10)
general 2020-08-03 12:49:58 Yes, meme build can also work sometimes
general 2020-08-03 12:50:45 I already see one obvious meme
general 2020-08-03 12:50:48 Bacon hair
general 2020-08-03 12:50:56 What other memes are you not providing us?
general 2020-08-03 12:51:26 The heck is that real?
general 2020-08-03 12:52:21 <@723419054114865202> **Squidnoir! It's not just a rock, it's a cube!**
general 2020-08-03 12:53:00 Well my brain has confused a quote for what I was about to type
general 2020-08-03 12:53:08 It has mixed them
general 2020-08-03 12:55:11 this is my brain https://youtu.be/yTOwMeimSl4
general 2020-08-03 12:55:24 no
general 2020-08-03 12:55:28 bye
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:19:13 According to Wikipedia, the Rockwell B-1 Lancer has a maximum wing sweep of 67.5 degrees
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:19:38 So I entered that and this happened
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:21:25 plane boat, flying boat
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:21:31 seaplane, airboat
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:21:55 b o a t
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:21:59 but yes that boat is nice
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:22:16 plus it has ***c u r v e s***
general 2020-08-03 14:23:09 Fox with a wig?
general 2020-08-03 14:23:15 Or furry?
general 2020-08-03 14:23:21 I'm not sure anymore
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:23:49 My brain wanted to say "underwear"
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:23:56 It's 10:23 PM
general 2020-08-03 14:24:46 ~~I hate how my brain wants to autofill "unde" as "underwear"~~
general 2020-08-03 14:25:39 There's a server moderator
general 2020-08-03 14:25:44 Grab Food
general 2020-08-03 14:26:15 He Grab Food

but they're a mod
general 2020-08-03 14:26:27 Hello who is Nevada
general 2020-08-03 14:26:37 I am a lizard who lives under a rock
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:27:17 It's only a little timefuck
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:27:37 Wait it's stuck?
general 2020-08-03 14:28:00 <:FalconStance1:715614632655454269><:FalconStance2:715614633737584691><:FalconStance3:715614633972727878>
general 2020-08-03 14:28:34 Well, I must make the bomber now
general 2020-08-03 14:28:48 What should I go for, one big bomb or many smaller motor locked bombs?
general 2020-08-03 14:29:29 Many motor locked bombs instead of one big motor locked bomb then
general 2020-08-03 14:29:53 I have an idea how I'll deal with the pitching issue conveyor drives present
general 2020-08-03 14:29:59 I'll use the variable sweep wing
general 2020-08-03 14:30:30 lag bomb go boom
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:34:48 I can relate
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:34:59 The kind who go
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:35:04 FLY. DRIVE. GO
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:35:17 And get triggered when you don't give them what they want
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:37:28 Kids usually be like that
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:37:35 Complain when they don't get what they want
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:38:33 <@!320502593111719937> every plane crazy channel*
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:38:46 When someone does tutorials
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:38:52 It's best to do it for parts
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:38:58 Not the whole vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:39:27 If you plan to make a tutorial, I suggest either only the necessary parts to spark creativity in these kids
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:39:29 Or make a guide
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:39:52 Creativity is learned through limitations
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:40:03 Not giving them everything all at once
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:40:31 Yes, tutorials are for learning
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:40:52 I mean why do you think redstone YouTubers only build a certain thing like a door
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:40:56 Not an entire base
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:41:16 Well apart from the time it takes
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:41:27 ^^
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:42:22 If you're a YouTuber, don't worry

*They'll eventually be caught bragging a tutorial build*
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:42:58 Honestly, I have no problem people using tutorial builds, it's when they think it makes them look cool it becomes a problem
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:43:21 Like you built it, now you should understand how it works
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:43:25 Then experiment with it
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:43:33 Up until you build a great vehicle of your own
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:44:12 I've started out with tutorials
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:44:19 From there I learned the technical stuff of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:44:41 And with enough time on this server, how to design the appearance of stuff
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:44:50 I started with Prototrode
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:44:58 But variety is good, so I watched others
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:45:13 I eventually learned how to make my suspension
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:45:25 A sorta trailing arm type suspension
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:45:53 I made an adjustable suspension out of this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailing_arm
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:46:22 wait why are we all reacting to palestine?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:46:25 Explain I am confused
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:47:08 What's in creations? 👀
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:47:58 I might try applying for Terrain Specialist II or III
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:48:04 Jay what did I miss?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:48:48 I have 1000 block bus
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:49:14 That's literally my only submission
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:49:24 Though bus looks clean, thanks to motor locking
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:50:05 Motor lock is *needed* on land vehicles of smaller scale
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:50:11 Just to look good
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:51:07 Motor lock makes it easy to add details
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:52:53 What's stall?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:53:00 ~~I literally don't know what it is~~
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:53:13 plen slow
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:53:37 Good thing I like doing big wings and big engines
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:54:54 Someone building a gun in my server
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:54:59 So I have a suggestion
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:55:29 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancor_Jackhammer
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:56:03 I suggested the Pancor Jackhammer to my local gunbuilder
general 2020-08-03 14:56:31 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancor_Jackhammer
general 2020-08-03 14:56:39 big shotgun
general 2020-08-03 14:56:44 someone wanted to build a gun
general 2020-08-03 14:56:47 so I sent them that
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:58:28 How to unlazy?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:58:36 Apart from occasional rest
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:59:14 That part I got it covered, because I already made what I think is a decent plane body
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:59:20 I'm lazy too
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:59:28 Though it is 10:59
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:59:32 I almost typed 69 there
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 14:59:41 Maybe I'm just tired
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:01:27 <@!723419054114865202> Ignoring the fact I still haven't fixed the nose and still haven't refined the wing sweep, how is plane looking so far?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:01:59 I'll go change that then
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:02:55 It's 11 PM, I'll just take note of that and go turn off this computer
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:03:16 If I have to be honest though, I'm kinda proud my building skills are somewhat improving
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:04:39 <@!387195148741771275> What were you using for keybinds on mobile?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:04:49 Unless Plane Crazy on mobile already has keybinds in game
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:05:10 Oh neat
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:06:02 Reminds me of those Android emulators that have customizable controls
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:06:11 Like the My Boy emulator
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:06:21 Anyways, see y'all tomorrow
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:16:32 I forgot I had Discord Android
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:16:50 Well, I might adopt a new format for my builds
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:17:13 A sorta mix in between informational and pictures
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:17:36 At least for the more advanced builds I might have
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:17:50 For when I post in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:21:47 I'm just gonna drop this here 

Here's the format I might use for more advanced builds when posting in <#384025409945337856>, with a shortened version being in the post and a more detailed one in the image itself

**Name:**
**Engine:** <number> <name> 
**Years in service:** 
**Description:** 
**Picture compilation**
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:22:14 I was thinking of making my stuff look nicer
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:22:34 Plus compiling everything into one picture reduces hassle
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:23:07 You have a lot, don't you?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:23:18 Well, go ahead if you want
general 2020-08-03 15:24:33 Why is Fokker funny
general 2020-08-03 15:25:45 I just find the name Fokker to be funny
general 2020-08-03 15:25:53 Like the planes, they nice
general 2020-08-03 15:26:08 But the name, I can't stop thinking how it sounds so close to fucker
general 2020-08-03 15:28:23 <@437078588701933568> fuck wolf
general 2020-08-03 15:29:10 Any plane can be a bomber if you're brave enough
general 2020-08-03 15:29:25 I speak Asian
general 2020-08-03 15:29:45 Ah yes that is indeed a flying eye sore
general 2020-08-03 15:30:35 I'm from the Philippines
general 2020-08-03 15:30:50 We were once a colony of both the Spanish Empire and the USA
general 2020-08-03 15:31:02 And was once conquered by Japan in WW2
general 2020-08-03 15:31:36 Honestly though the geography here is nice
general 2020-08-03 15:32:07 The weather will either be a Brit's paradise or a Brit's nightmare
general 2020-08-03 15:32:16 Tropical but with a chance of typhoons
general 2020-08-03 15:32:47 Food is nice, so is other stuff 
I'mma stop being braindead now
general 2020-08-03 15:32:53 So bye then
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 15:33:16 Lots of planes
general 2020-08-03 22:47:23 Rainora?
general 2020-08-03 23:41:56 Warthog?
general 2020-08-03 23:42:01 Long Warthog?
general 2020-08-03 23:42:08 The one in Halo or the plane?
general 2020-08-03 23:43:14 No that's where Valve gets their magic steam from
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 23:45:48 When I watch tutorials, I usually prefer tutorials that either teach you a mechanic, shows you how to build a certain thing or a guide
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 23:46:02 Not the kinds that show you how to build the whole vehicle
general 2020-08-03 23:46:35 I have woke
general 2020-08-03 23:47:03 I'm still slightly braindead
general 2020-08-03 23:47:13 <@456219506486804480> no.
general 2020-08-03 23:47:28 ~~save my ears from the horns~~
general 2020-08-03 23:48:37 Interesting
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 23:49:43 Well, I've given myself time for my brain to wake up
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 23:49:54 Time to continue the B-1 bomber
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 23:50:47 Great now I can't unsee it
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 23:51:14 yes u
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 23:51:54 Aight I'll take your word for it
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 23:52:39 I'm just a mess of free catalog items
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 23:53:07 Junkbot with that big block head with blue glow
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 23:53:51 Too bad Rthro makes it hard or near impossible to climb ladders
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 23:54:39 I'll do it with my jumbo then
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 23:56:44 7 blocks break into 7 blocks 
One 1x7 beam doesn't break into 7 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:27:41 The B-1 Lancer uses four General Electric F-101 102 engines with afterburners
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:27:45 Those engines are turbofans
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:28:01 Should I use jet engines (turbofans) or rocket engines (mmm, burning stuff)
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:28:44 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:28:52 All I go is that they make plen go nyooooom
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:29:13 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric_F101
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:29:15 oh ok then
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:30:00 now to make the engines look l o n k
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:34:06 I just realized something
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:34:45 I could shift the weight of the plane to having it's center of lift and center of mass match by using the weight of the in-game engines
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:37:41 This should not only make it look a little bit more accurate but also help with the center of mass be closer to the center of lift
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:38:29 Now if only I could move them slightly out of the way of the wing when it changes sweep
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:47:14 I see ballasts and possibly helium (maybe fuel)
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:50:56 I cringed when someone called my car a Porsche
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:51:28 If they had spent one second looking at the rear, it's obvious it isn't one
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:52:47 Well, you did say you're new right?
Well, it's pretty decent
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:53:18 Ironclad?
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:53:41 Has plates of metal to protect it?
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:54:25 https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=define+ironclad&atb=v225-1&ia=definition
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 00:57:01 That's pretty *metal*
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 01:02:07 Blue or yellow
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 01:02:31 Or whatever color fire can actually be
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 01:06:37 Well for a specific RGB, all I can suggest is this

plane-crazy 2020-08-04 01:07:54 Looking at this 3D model, the tail end of a B-1 Lancer reminds me of an empanada https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/strategic-bomber-rockwell-b-1-3d-3ds/1087458

plane-crazy 2020-08-04 01:09:08 How many people will get mad if I call the B-1 Lancer the "Empanada Bomber"
general 2020-08-04 01:09:30 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/740013421868613742
general 2020-08-04 01:10:53 The tail end of a B-1 Lancer looks like an empanada
general 2020-08-04 01:10:57 So empanada bomber
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 01:47:14 <@!363742162757877761> It's an untextured ice cream cone
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 01:47:42 And I'm hungry
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 01:48:52 There's duplicates
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 01:49:09 My brain doesn't wanna think
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 01:49:12 because hunger
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 01:50:20 What happened to your Rafale?
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 01:51:10 They want c o l o r s
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:00:14 > request

plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:02:02 <@!615876745710534676> My classmates deny Facebook being overly greedy about tracking
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:03:18 Here's what I noticed about upvoted aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:03:42 - Has some color variation, though not to the point of being an eyesore
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:04:03 - Body's curvy, not boxy (some exceptions may apply but never on an aircraft)
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:04:26 - Isn't an overused aircraft such as the A-10 Warthog
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:05:04 Yeah, there's also a balance in size
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:05:37 Kinda glad what I chose isn't too common
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:05:47 *cough* A-10 Warthog *cough*
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:06:17 Ah yes, the US's recent aircraft is also common
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:07:06 I'll go search up how many results it pops up
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:07:18 Not checking individual results
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:07:37 Page 1 out of 16 if I search up A-10
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:08:00 1 of 2 with *A10* (no hyphen)
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:08:57 <@!447221768520859659> You're right, it is common
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:09:08 Though the A-10 is still common though
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:09:49 Oh there's tanks called B1
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:11:06 12 B-1 Lancers
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:11:17 Typing in both B-1 and B1 Lancer
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:11:56 Dragons aren't common, so I might build them too
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:12:09 ~~I know they're not aircraft~~
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:12:15 Actually I am
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:12:52 <@!447221768520859659> Still better than my early builds

plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:13:53 that nose
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:14:08 It looks like it got into a crash mid-flight
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:14:14 And then got s q u i s h e d
general 2020-08-04 02:14:29 ||*ⁿᵉᵛᵉʳ ᵍᵒⁿⁿᵃ ᵍᶦᵛᵉ ʸᵒᵘ ᵘᵖ*||
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:14:48 Still better than most people in the game though
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:15:07 Reminds me when someone made a literal rectangle with glass on it and called it a "limo"
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:15:29 Or how someone made a glass box on a platform with suspension and called it an all-terrain vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:15:57 Meanwhile I made a dump truck
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:16:10 Not detailed but definitely not a box
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:16:32 *flashbacks to US carrier with Japan's flag*

plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:18:41 
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:18:42 
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:18:42 The earliest plane that I have recorded
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:18:56 It *sucks*
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:19:01 It's cringe
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:19:18 I have now learned to keep styling a little pulled back
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:19:42 <@!447221768520859659> Those colors look like it came out of an teenage edgelord's bedroom doesn't it?
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:20:59 Before I go, I must submit a ticket
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:21:27 I only joined this game this year
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:21:40 About last month-ish
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:26:43 Decidius actually gets it
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:26:55 It's just something we enjoy, so let us enjoy it unless we're actually doing harm
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:27:30 Why is Proto ban?

plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:30:28 XD
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:30:44 I might upvote
general 2020-08-04 02:49:07 <@328413257092169729> Aren't there laptops you can disassemble?
general 2020-08-04 02:49:24 And replace parts with
general 2020-08-04 02:49:52 Like I remember this budget laptop for gaming involving a Lenovo laptop that can be opened up
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:55:14 So apart from build quality, colors and rarity/uniqueness, what else could help with <#384025409945337856>?
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 02:55:50 Picture quality? Info?
general 2020-08-04 02:57:04 I can play Plane Crazy even though my computer's not that good

general 2020-08-04 02:58:57 It's still decent though

general 2020-08-04 04:33:00 What about 5?
general 2020-08-04 04:39:56 I remember Adopt Me
general 2020-08-04 04:40:09 I gave up as soon  as someone was generous enough to gift me a rare dragon
general 2020-08-04 04:40:57 I never played Adopt Me since someone gifted me this Frost Dragon with all possible potions
general 2020-08-04 04:41:57 That gift was one of the times where I actually met a good person on Roblox
general 2020-08-04 04:42:06 Before joining Plane Crazy
general 2020-08-04 04:42:23 Yes, I wasn't kidding about the frost dragon
general 2020-08-04 04:42:36 Someone was actually that kind, to give me something expensive
general 2020-08-04 04:42:38 With all the potions
general 2020-08-04 04:42:52 ~~but I am happy that I have dragon~~

general 2020-08-04 04:44:56 Yes

general 2020-08-04 05:07:43 <#617941134605549579> Are these Discord servers for Plane Crazy stuff?
general 2020-08-04 05:07:56 I might take a look into them
general 2020-08-04 05:08:35 Might join the PCAA
general 2020-08-04 05:08:46 To learn a thing or two about aerospace stuff

plane-crazy 2020-08-04 06:10:09 Looks like for the most part I've finished the B-1's exterior
help 2020-08-04 06:20:46 So how does it look?
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 06:21:00 <#478584971670454284>
help 2020-08-04 06:21:13 apart from you know, long nose
help 2020-08-04 06:40:42 Thanks
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 09:29:16 <#384025409945337856> I made a thing
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 09:29:23 Probably not the best screenshots but oh well
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 09:30:05 At least I delivered
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 09:31:08 I almost forgot to include something
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 09:32:12 I got too lazy
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 09:32:42 And honestly I wanted to finish it to just somewhere good enough
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 09:32:48 So I can do other stuff
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 09:32:53 Other than planes
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 09:33:53 I probably should redesign it when I'm motivated to do it again
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 09:34:35 Ah, 5 downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 09:34:44 I was expecting that for not finishing it completely
creations-chat 2020-08-04 09:36:06 @ me what I need to change https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/740139170319826954
creations-chat 2020-08-04 09:36:20 For now I just wanna take a break from building planes
creations-chat 2020-08-04 09:36:34 I'll fix it when I'm motivated again
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 09:37:22 <#504436696021204992> Just tell me what I need to do
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 09:37:32 And I'll fix it when I want to
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 10:36:27 <@693476997007147068> I'm just minding my own business here, doing my own things (within reason of course)
general 2020-08-04 10:37:19 8:6 upvote to downvote ratio, I'm not sure if that's good or bad
general 2020-08-04 10:37:29 Like it's almost close to being equal
general 2020-08-04 10:37:56 Yeah that's the problem I usually heard
general 2020-08-04 10:38:10 Noted, when I return to the B-1
general 2020-08-04 10:39:10 I can see why exposed engine doesn't look so good
general 2020-08-04 10:40:52 So to list what I'll do when I return to it 
- Fix the engines 
- Better flight (it's not that bad, but will get outmatched by a fighter and has a tendency to pitch downwards)
- Motor locked carpet bombing
general 2020-08-04 10:41:28 I have a feeling the weakest will be glass
general 2020-08-04 10:42:00 I mean it's glass, didn't say anything about being bulletproof or being Gorilla glass (that strong glass that's on your smartphone and on the Ford GT)
general 2020-08-04 10:43:34 As for strongest, I assume anything metal/diamond playing
general 2020-08-04 10:43:59 Well, it does have an effect
general 2020-08-04 10:44:14 But I've only tested it with friction
general 2020-08-04 10:44:27 Ice is slippery and fabric is grippy
general 2020-08-04 10:45:14 In real life?
general 2020-08-04 10:46:10 Well, that's interesting
general 2020-08-04 10:46:30 Didn't expect glass to be good for armor
general 2020-08-04 10:46:45 Also I have an idea on what to post in <#384025409945337856>
general 2020-08-04 10:46:58 ***S t e a m e d   H a m s***
general 2020-08-04 10:47:29 That's if the mods are fine with me recreating every scene in it
general 2020-08-04 10:47:42 Because meme
general 2020-08-04 10:48:45 I'll do shitposts because it's fun
general 2020-08-04 10:49:11 Roomba but it's Amazon Echo?
general 2020-08-04 10:49:44 Tutorial plane? Wait isn't that the giant tutorial plane?
general 2020-08-04 10:49:59 O h
general 2020-08-04 10:50:27 One giant block
general 2020-08-04 10:50:32 Got it
general 2020-08-04 10:50:51 A big ol' block of cobblestone
general 2020-08-04 10:51:19 I am big brain boy :>
general 2020-08-04 10:51:34 Because I have dense smooth brain
general 2020-08-04 10:53:09 There is but not that good
general 2020-08-04 10:53:19 It's a Wikia/Fandom page
general 2020-08-04 10:55:16 What if I were to build a furry/aeromorph mech and post it into <#384025409945337856> xp
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 12:27:30 I eased the pitching problem of the conveyor drive afterburner
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 12:27:38 On my B-1 Lancer
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 12:28:20 I took advantage of the small canards in front and mounted the conveyor drive in the back and facing in reverse (the piston facing towards the travel of the aircraft)
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 12:28:42 Well, with that I should take note that the location of conveyor drives also affects their stability
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 12:30:12 Current stable speed achieved with minimal manual pitch controls is 3000
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 12:30:21 After that it decides to steer itself
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 12:31:45 Also managed to make it steer better, not sacrificing much pitch in exchange for roll
help 2020-08-04 12:55:11 that's a big chonker
help 2020-08-04 12:55:23 but yeah wings
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 13:18:59 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-21_Raider
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 13:19:06 This exists
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 13:19:16 I wonder if anyone might end up making it into a tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 13:19:40 It is just an improved B2
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 13:21:05 There seems to be some bombers from Russia and China comparable to this one
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 13:21:16 Tupolev PAK DA and Xian H-20
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 13:21:45 They're both flying wings, like the B-21
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 13:25:06 It does look a lot like the B-2
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 13:25:46 The Tupolev PAK-DA on the other hand is a flying dorito
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 13:25:58 With variable sweep wings
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 13:26:20 Might be an interesting way of designing flying wing aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 13:26:45 So reliance on purely control surfaces could be reduced
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 13:27:42 <@!441756332610289673> Must be Thor's long lost brother, Thorn

general 2020-08-04 14:21:08 No time, long see boi, fire
general 2020-08-04 23:19:13 Did you do another earrape today?
general 2020-08-04 23:19:53 Logic has answered his question
general 2020-08-04 23:21:32 Random brainfart, who makes jet engines again?

GE, P&W and Rolls-Royce?
general 2020-08-04 23:22:41 Yeah just wanted to be sure
general 2020-08-04 23:23:08 Those are the only names I know of right now
general 2020-08-04 23:24:57 First time I heard Rolls-Royce as an aircraft engine manufacturer and not luxury cars is with the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar
general 2020-08-04 23:29:55 The L-1011 was a pretty neat airliner
general 2020-08-04 23:30:36 :gasp: So realistic!

general 2020-08-04 23:38:34 I'm having low expectations for online classes now

general 2020-08-04 23:41:43 So basicallt, anti self-destruct?
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 23:43:07 If a plane nose dives just a little, is it a good idea to use ballast blocks?
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 01:08:56 What do I do when my plane keeps doing nose dives
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 01:09:02 And not fly straight?
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 01:09:33 It's only when I use the conveyor drive it seems to fly straight
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 01:10:05 I see have some space inside
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 01:10:58 
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 01:10:59 
general 2020-08-05 01:13:53 On a scale of 1-10, how bad does a supersonic dive bomber sound
I got that as a response to me saying I have nose diving issue
general 2020-08-05 01:14:37 wait what
general 2020-08-05 01:26:43 I don't think Roblox bots go that advanced
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 01:29:00 Huh, the variable sweep wings actually help with take-off
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 01:30:54 Eventual redesign fixed the pitching issue
general 2020-08-05 01:31:19 I have a friend with a lag bomb
general 2020-08-05 01:31:30 Forced me to close the Roblox GC
general 2020-08-05 01:32:30 <@!606370928410099712> That's like reporting a plane for being too loud
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 01:34:21 Now it ruins the afterburmers
general 2020-08-05 01:36:08 There is a difference between a laggy build and an actual lag inducer
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 01:40:50 It's gone?
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 01:43:48 After some adjustments both supersonic and subsonic flight flies straight now
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 01:44:21 Used the front canards to help out with the nose dives but only if I held W
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 01:44:46 As for the conveyor driving pitching problem, the variable sweep wing was used
general 2020-08-05 01:50:07 Can someone tell me why people like randomly riding builds
general 2020-08-05 01:50:27 Especially ones that aren't even built by their friends

bug-reports 2020-08-05 01:53:05 One time on a custom engine
bug-reports 2020-08-05 01:53:21 I mean ngl, it was pretty creative
bug-reports 2020-08-05 01:55:56 I feel like water wheels would be great at looking like fans and gears
bug-reports 2020-08-05 01:56:12 Might be a neat little suggestion
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 01:57:09 floating? rotating in mid-air?
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 01:57:13 Anchors
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 01:57:57 Cameras?
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 01:58:00 no
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 01:58:07 There isn't a base or something to make it rotate
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 01:58:32 Not even sure if it can contain an anchored motor

general 2020-08-05 02:12:28 Has anyone experienced easily falling asleep in the morning
general 2020-08-05 02:13:02 Like it's the opposite, I stay up late at night yet in the morning I struggle to wake up
general 2020-08-05 02:13:17 Well unless I motivate myself to wake up
general 2020-08-05 02:17:08 Oh I have a Gundam game

general 2020-08-05 02:17:46 I found this

general 2020-08-05 02:18:32 Literally just TNT with wings
general 2020-08-05 02:19:06 The closest thing I have is my experience with jet-era planes
general 2020-08-05 02:20:04 I only have one decent and one good build
general 2020-08-05 02:20:10 And even then that good build still needs improvements
general 2020-08-05 02:20:30 The biggest flaw being the one most people said to me
***e x p o s e d e n g i n e***
general 2020-08-05 02:20:54 I know what to build for a mech, search up the title screen for the arcade game Space Harrier

general 2020-08-05 02:25:28 I might do construction equipment
general 2020-08-05 02:25:31 Maybe a Volvo
general 2020-08-05 02:25:36 Because I know the name
general 2020-08-05 02:26:29 I've done a mix of military and civilian
general 2020-08-05 02:26:39 Though the latter's still more on the commercial side
general 2020-08-05 02:27:42 I have bus
general 2020-08-05 02:28:15 Here's mine, a modified Neoplan Skyliner
general 2020-08-05 02:28:31 With a grill that looks like came from a Citroen DS3
general 2020-08-05 02:29:04 nice bus
general 2020-08-05 02:29:46 I misread Volvo Penta as something else
general 2020-08-05 02:31:34 It's fine
general 2020-08-05 02:31:54 I just noticed the majority of the chat are

general 2020-08-05 02:37:37 Give me suggestions for tracked vehicles that aren't tanks
general 2020-08-05 02:38:12 I'll go look up Volvo's excavators then
general 2020-08-05 02:38:34 They also a crane on tracks
general 2020-08-05 02:39:13 "**Big Wood Bigger Power**"
This is on their website
general 2020-08-05 02:39:26 Their choice of words are interesting
general 2020-08-05 02:39:47 Haven't tested them out, but could work
general 2020-08-05 02:41:07 For an excavator this be looking a little curvy ngl https://www.volvoce.com/global/en/our-offer/crawler-excavators/

general 2020-08-05 04:47:56 It's not bad, I actually like Hawaiian
general 2020-08-05 04:48:06 Plus the pineapples help if you like hot sauce on your pizza
general 2020-08-05 04:48:42 That's blursed
general 2020-08-05 04:49:19 👀 There's a DJ set beside my plot
general 2020-08-05 04:50:10 I'm gonna be cheap in the way I'll build my exit/entrance and just use a trapdoor this time

general 2020-08-05 05:07:35 Tbh the only reason I want HoF is the master rank
general 2020-08-05 05:08:10 The mods
general 2020-08-05 05:08:14 I think

general 2020-08-05 05:21:20 Well I got quickly tired of doing the first part of the Volvo, I'm gonna do another thing
general 2020-08-05 05:21:35 Multi-tasking is the only thing that motivates me without thinking too hard
general 2020-08-05 05:22:41 wait I've found something one person hasn't built in <#384025409945337856>
general 2020-08-05 05:25:31 There are furries in this server

general 2020-08-05 05:26:16 No, it isn't
general 2020-08-05 05:26:29 I mean I talk here everyday and nobody has a problem with the fact I am one
general 2020-08-05 05:28:59 I don't know either
general 2020-08-05 05:29:16 YouTube once shown me a *huge* lizard acting like a dog

This is the only good ad in this format
general 2020-08-05 05:33:12 Everything else is just clickbait
general 2020-08-05 05:33:50 Honestly if it's done in a meme like way, I wouldn't mind

plane-crazy 2020-08-05 05:42:19 How compact can a trailing arm suspension be?
general 2020-08-05 05:51:45 Everytime I see a sirenhead builder, I think of earrape
general 2020-08-05 05:52:07 Because kids
general 2020-08-05 05:52:48 <@!645128367611445248> I'd rather see "questionable" artwork than to see sirenhead fan art
general 2020-08-05 05:52:59 I'd rather see DeviantArt type stuff than that
general 2020-08-05 05:53:55 no
general 2020-08-05 05:53:59 I already have what I want
general 2020-08-05 05:55:11 <@!645128367611445248> Please steer your cousin away from DeviantArt if you don't want his stuff to get worse
general 2020-08-05 05:56:56 <@!645128367611445248> I really don't get the appeal of inflation tbh
general 2020-08-05 05:57:18 Well he's beyond saving now
general 2020-08-05 05:58:52 <@!645128367611445248> I am a student of the art of weird

And let me tell you, your cousin got the wrong kind of weird
general 2020-08-05 05:59:41 Good thing he hasn't learned how to kick you in the groin
general 2020-08-05 06:02:00 <@!645128367611445248> Let's see
- Cussing
- Weird spicy stuff
- Sirenhead obsession (seriously I'm fine if he likes it, but not obsesses over it like some Undertale kid)
general 2020-08-05 06:02:33 Why is he the embodiment of every pre-teen kid out there
general 2020-08-05 06:04:02 <@!645128367611445248> If he was fun to be with, that might be the only redeeming quality that'll make you look past his unusual things
general 2020-08-05 06:04:08 But nope he isnt
general 2020-08-05 06:04:42 Yeah, I see your point
general 2020-08-05 06:05:15 <@!645128367611445248> Would it be less worse if he's at least a decent person personality-wise
general 2020-08-05 06:06:36 John, his personality reminds me when me and my brother were younger
general 2020-08-05 06:06:43 Except without the weird stuff
general 2020-08-05 06:06:55 Like me messing with my brother, damn I missed that
general 2020-08-05 06:07:00 When he was still gullible

general 2020-08-05 06:16:03 The bad sides of both the furry and anime fandoms
general 2020-08-05 06:16:34 Me, being a furry, wishes I won't argue with him
general 2020-08-05 06:16:39 Or meet him

general 2020-08-05 06:25:21 I'm gonna let you imagine why
general 2020-08-05 06:27:34 I don't know if that's worse than the cursed comment I saw
general 2020-08-05 06:28:21 <@!642151786966286348> I thought those were doge heads

plane-crazy 2020-08-05 08:44:08 To get an idea of how I'll style a car
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 08:44:49 Mostly the Oshkosh L-ATV, Hummer/Humvee, Suzuki Jimny and Toyota's SUVs and trucks (and of course the Mega Cruiser), maybe the LM002
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 08:47:22 The FJ Cruiser seems to be the only Toyota off-roader that looks sorta Jeep like
general 2020-08-05 08:57:39 I have discovered another kind of player that I now dislike
general 2020-08-05 08:57:56 Unsolicited roleplayers
general 2020-08-05 08:58:28 Which I have been forced to experience by this
"*poops on window*"
general 2020-08-05 08:58:50 Who the hell poops on the window of a bomber?
general 2020-08-05 08:59:22 Pooped on a B-1 Lancer
general 2020-08-05 08:59:29 Without me even asking for it
general 2020-08-05 08:59:44 <@456226577798135808> Simple, I was on the ground at the time

general 2020-08-05 09:01:39 :>
general 2020-08-05 09:02:47 I have also seen that the B-1 Looks like a Tu-144 or whatever the name of that Soviet supersonic bomber is
general 2020-08-05 09:03:31 Nope, I left
general 2020-08-05 09:03:50 I just said "I can't stay in the same server with an attention seeking roleplayer" and then left
general 2020-08-05 09:04:52 My brain has poop question
general 2020-08-05 09:05:24 What's the first game that introduced y'all to fighter/attack aircraft, bombers, etc.
general 2020-08-05 09:07:53 Mine is an arcade game made by Sega, called After Burner

And out of all the OSTs I like, it's the one on the Sega CD https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLirSddeMOYZ5x66nKRmo6zTTeGtzh18g1

general 2020-08-05 09:34:20 I wonder what plane girl people think of
general 2020-08-05 09:34:40 Anime plane girl or anthropomorphic plane girl (aeromorph)
general 2020-08-05 09:36:13 <@448505589983739914> It's in the dump, Russian plane girl aeromorph

Somehow I have conflicted feelings between liking and not liking it
general 2020-08-05 09:38:19 <@448505589983739914> That looks like some memory problems

plane-crazy 2020-08-05 12:00:58 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummer_HX There's something I like about the Hummer HX's styling as an off-roader
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 12:01:21 I might build this in Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 12:11:32 My god
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 12:11:38 Do I have to be forced to listen to horns again
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 12:11:59 Guy with an ugly Bugatti did horn abuse
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 12:12:19 Emphasis on ugly, red and blue looks bad

plane-crazy 2020-08-05 12:15:53 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeep_Hurricane This car is powered by two HEMI V8s
general 2020-08-05 12:16:47 Is it just me or do people in this game really have an addiction to horns
general 2020-08-05 12:18:38 I'm surprised people upvoted my simple suspension

general 2020-08-05 12:20:34 What's halifax?
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 12:25:40 Well, I just saw you on that server
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 12:25:49 lots of cameras
general 2020-08-05 12:26:31 Aren't there people who build bunkers?
general 2020-08-05 12:26:41 Drop it onto a bunker
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 12:27:49 Oh, James Norrington
general 2020-08-05 12:52:45 I tried to meet the demands of a noob who is forcing me to fly
general 2020-08-05 12:52:52 My god does it really piss me off
general 2020-08-05 12:53:31 It started off with him getting an unsolicited ride in my bomber
general 2020-08-05 12:53:44 When he couldn't get a free ride (because tbh I prefer doing it with people I've met)
general 2020-08-05 12:53:55 He got triggered and said "I bet my plane could outrun this"
general 2020-08-05 12:54:14 He got flexed on, I told him mine could fly up to 3500 before losing stability
general 2020-08-05 12:54:27 He did it again with "I'll spawn in the largest battleship"
general 2020-08-05 12:54:36 I responded to his ego by spawning in the jumbo jet
general 2020-08-05 12:54:48 He didn't even have a battleship
general 2020-08-05 12:55:14 Nope
general 2020-08-05 12:55:20 When I'm irrirtated, I just leave
general 2020-08-05 12:55:34 Unless I'm reminded it's actually content here
general 2020-08-05 12:55:47 After that
general 2020-08-05 12:55:55 There begins another "FLY. FLY. FLY" session
general 2020-08-05 12:56:08 After he saw my jumbo jet, well that happened
general 2020-08-05 12:56:16 torture through annoying begging
general 2020-08-05 12:56:33 Like in my mind I went "Dude let me build my car"
general 2020-08-05 12:56:38 "Stop bothering me"
general 2020-08-05 12:56:59 I have to agree, it is smol
general 2020-08-05 12:58:07 I feel like Plane Crazy's best played on Snapdragon 7XX or 8XX processors
general 2020-08-05 12:58:17 6XX is what I'd call mid-range
general 2020-08-05 12:58:29 7XX is high-end for me and 8XX is the cutting edge
general 2020-08-05 12:58:54 Oppo's Chinese ._.
general 2020-08-05 12:59:04 The Chinese dominates the smartphone market
general 2020-08-05 12:59:20 The only Japanese brands I know are Sony and Sharp
general 2020-08-05 12:59:29 But even then only Sony does exports
general 2020-08-05 13:00:20 <@!397848139677040671> Motor 2, turn off servo
general 2020-08-05 13:00:53 This is the hardware I'm using
general 2020-08-05 13:00:54 
general 2020-08-05 13:00:57 Hopefully it's good enough
general 2020-08-05 13:01:25 I've been told this GPU gets outperformed by the Radeon R7
general 2020-08-05 13:01:38 An iGPU
general 2020-08-05 13:03:13 Well I'm just gonna make a custom off-roader now
general 2020-08-05 13:03:24 After the shitfest that is dealing with egotistical noobs
general 2020-08-05 13:04:06 Hmm, random thought
general 2020-08-05 13:04:28 Does India have a growing smartphone industry?
general 2020-08-05 13:04:57 <@456226577798135808> Like their own smartphones?
general 2020-08-05 13:05:39 Do they have a good range of smartphones?
general 2020-08-05 13:06:51 I've met girls on Discord
general 2020-08-05 13:07:29 Wait I just wooooshed myself
general 2020-08-05 13:07:54 Ship color scheme
general 2020-08-05 13:08:18 <@456226577798135808> You have identified it as shipsexual
general 2020-08-05 13:08:29 112 wpm, damn that's fast
general 2020-08-05 13:09:38 Does this look better than the Jeep type front grills? https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/L-ATV_4.jpg/1024px-L-ATV_4.jpg
general 2020-08-05 13:09:39 Like fr
general 2020-08-05 13:09:47 I wanna build an off-roader
general 2020-08-05 13:10:28 Gonna build something based on the L-ATV then
general 2020-08-05 13:15:39 Rick has done a good job in this game
general 2020-08-05 13:15:47 Because it's literally the only Roblox game I play
general 2020-08-05 13:16:14 I'm currently doing the kind of style the L-ATV has
general 2020-08-05 13:16:21 But not exactly the whole thing
general 2020-08-05 13:17:07 Expanded default when
general 2020-08-05 13:20:20 I have suddenly remembered that one discussion we had with bigcrazyjohn
general 2020-08-05 13:20:30 The one with his cousin
general 2020-08-05 13:21:22 XD
general 2020-08-05 13:21:43 I wonder if there should be Chat OOC channel xp
general 2020-08-05 13:22:07 That was a real thing in the chat btw
general 2020-08-05 13:23:10 These chat logs combined nicely
general 2020-08-05 13:23:54 A lot of people from S.E Asia playing PC
general 2020-08-05 13:24:12 Let me get the suggestiosn channel
general 2020-08-05 13:25:18 For me Koreans are especially noticeable
general 2020-08-05 13:28:07 Anyone beyond S.E Asia is rare for me
general 2020-08-05 13:29:19 I still remembered the nude avatars
general 2020-08-05 13:29:34 Like that still weirds me out
general 2020-08-05 13:30:41 I wonder what's the most common fandom in this server
general 2020-08-05 13:30:50 Apart from Roblox related and anime
general 2020-08-05 13:33:37 Laziness came and now I'll go ride my builds
general 2020-08-05 14:15:36 Ive heard of people assembling computers for dirt cheap
general 2020-08-05 14:16:35 <@652857275769421825> I know a YouTube Discord for literally budget builds
general 2020-08-05 14:17:07 But I don't know if I should DM you about it
general 2020-08-05 14:18:52 Well, he's a YouTuber with experience in buulding computers on a budget
general 2020-08-05 14:19:12 Even his community has experience in that kind of stuff
general 2020-08-05 14:19:21 Im in his Discord
general 2020-08-05 14:20:54 Knowing me though Ill probably ask more stuff from the community when I have a stable source of income
general 2020-08-05 14:21:04 No not LTT
general 2020-08-05 14:21:19 Thats literslly the name of his channel

general 2020-08-05 14:33:29 Minecraft Java Edition is nice
general 2020-08-05 14:33:35 OG Minecraft
general 2020-08-05 14:34:40 I actuslly hsve that launcher
general 2020-08-05 14:34:52 Installed with ForgeOptifine

general 2020-08-05 14:36:42 As well as some ultralight shaders
general 2020-08-05 14:36:51 Theres also the Wurst hacked client
general 2020-08-05 14:37:03 Mmm, wurst sasauges
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 00:59:55 The chat being weird again
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 01:01:02 I was just flying around mindlessly in the morning
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 01:03:05 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/740489171894009856 I don't get how this got a decent upvote to downvote ratio compared to my other builds, like it's literally just a suspension setup that allows for 3x3 wheels
general 2020-08-06 01:17:22 wat
general 2020-08-06 01:18:02 <@456226577798135808> wait a supersonic shit?
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 01:18:24 PC's definitely recommended
general 2020-08-06 01:18:47 I'm just gonna pretend I didn't see that because I need to eat some breakfast
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 01:36:20 Back
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 01:36:31 There's literally a tutorial for intakes?
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 01:37:10 Well, it's not like it's gonna be abused like horns and shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 01:37:12 So go ahead
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 01:37:40 I really can't see how it'll go wrong tbh
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 01:39:36 I'm gonna go build a Land Rover or something now
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 01:39:54 Looks different from the Jeep styling that's popular
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 01:40:19 I'm running fine, Windows 10 literally giving me only 2 out of 8 GB to work with
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 01:40:36 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 01:40:42 Well, there's only one way to find out
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 01:41:31 I'm just content I got a decent PC
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 01:42:22 The only thing I know that my dad has is watercooled Ryzen 5, haven't heard much from his own computer
general 2020-08-06 01:43:06 Give me a good color for Land Rovers
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 01:43:49 Switch with an outlet
general 2020-08-06 01:44:53 <@!287779983445721088> I mean I just wanted to try something that doesn't have Jeep styling
general 2020-08-06 01:45:33 I haven't heard much with European off-roaders in the game/this server tbh
general 2020-08-06 01:45:52 Well, there's that one Russian who built a Mercedes-Benz G-Class 6x6
general 2020-08-06 01:46:08 The Mercedes-Benz 6x6...
general 2020-08-06 01:46:14 It's an absurd idea and I love it
general 2020-08-06 01:46:57 Speaking of Land Rover
general 2020-08-06 01:47:12 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowler_Nemesis
general 2020-08-06 01:47:26 This is based on a Land Rover
general 2020-08-06 01:47:39 It's used in endurance rally raid races such as the Dakar Rally
general 2020-08-06 01:48:26 So it's either rally raid type cars or some unique off-roaders such as the MB G-Class 6x6 and the Local Motors Rally Fighter
general 2020-08-06 01:49:28 I mean Tata Motors didn't do a bad job with Jaguar
general 2020-08-06 01:49:39 Tata owns Jaguar Land Rover
general 2020-08-06 01:50:34 So, what should I be building then
general 2020-08-06 01:52:04 Last time I tried making a buggy, it ended up being a roll-over disaster
general 2020-08-06 01:52:09 Or with double wishbones, a gliitchy mess
general 2020-08-06 01:53:40 https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/cmr/images/6/64/Dirt_Scott_SchwalbeSuperBuggy.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170127015150

This is the buggy I made last time
general 2020-08-06 01:53:54 A buggy made for racing, Scott Shwalbe's Super Buggy
general 2020-08-06 01:54:34 I dunno, but kinda prefer it over a beach buggy
general 2020-08-06 01:54:54 Kinda reminds me of an Ariel Nomad tbh
general 2020-08-06 01:55:11 Maybe I'll just go make a rally raid vehicle
general 2020-08-06 01:55:28 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_raid
general 2020-08-06 01:55:44 Basically, endurance desert racing, which looks much tougher than even the 24 Hours of Le Mans
general 2020-08-06 01:57:46 Well never experienced shopping for bruhs
general 2020-08-06 01:58:31 <@!287779983445721088> Immediately my mind went to Peugeot(s) modified for hillclimbing
general 2020-08-06 01:59:57 <@!287779983445721088> https://rallygroupbshrine.org/the-group-b-cars/post-group-b-evolutions/peugeot-405-t16-pikes-peak/ Wait what about this?
general 2020-08-06 02:00:43 880 kg with 800 bhp
general 2020-08-06 02:00:55 That sounds like something I wanna build
general 2020-08-06 02:01:40 Cars made for racing in Pikes Peak are absurd
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 02:02:39 I'll go build a Peugeot 406 T16 Pikes Peak
general 2020-08-06 02:07:50 Wasn't there a Suzuki Escudo Pikes Peak car?
general 2020-08-06 02:08:33 985 hp from a twin turbo V6 is absurd
general 2020-08-06 02:08:50 Any more and it might be a Formula 1 engine
general 2020-08-06 02:11:10 ford rs200 is good car
general 2020-08-06 02:18:32 <@!287779983445721088> You know the game Richard Burns Rally?
general 2020-08-06 02:18:46 It's old but it has a big modding community
general 2020-08-06 02:18:54 Ranging from graphical to adding new cars
general 2020-08-06 02:19:21 Game's known for that and being a simracer, focusing on realistic driving physics
general 2020-08-06 02:22:03 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrsnN23tmUA> this is best car

general 2020-08-06 03:37:03 Discord saying Shift + Esc marks an entire server as read
general 2020-08-06 03:37:10 But is there one for pings only?
general 2020-08-06 03:38:16 **Shift** + **Esc** actually marks an entire Discord server as read
general 2020-08-06 03:38:20 that's pretty neat
general 2020-08-06 03:43:27 <@!168872475701018624> No more soyuz nerushimy?
general 2020-08-06 03:44:30 Radial engines? Isn't that the kind used in propeller era planes?
general 2020-08-06 03:44:58 Fun Fact: The Soviet Union had their own sports car, it sucked
general 2020-08-06 03:45:04 Soviet Lotus
general 2020-08-06 03:45:28 I can say whatever I want xp
general 2020-08-06 03:45:39 Ngl though the Marussia B2 is a pretty nice car
general 2020-08-06 03:46:25 "Let's go eat banana"
general 2020-08-06 03:46:41 ***b a n a n a***
**monke worship banana**
general 2020-08-06 03:47:46 Ah, yes

The overused plane
general 2020-08-06 03:49:22 The F-14 Tomcat's variable sweep wings would make it suitable for conveyor drives
general 2020-08-06 03:49:38 I've already fixed the pitching using via the variable sweep wings of the B-1 Lancer
general 2020-08-06 03:49:45 So I can do it again on the F-14  Tomcat
general 2020-08-06 03:50:38 > imagine posting your creation in binary
<@!430739561690431489> Sounds like a potential rickroll
general 2020-08-06 03:51:42 fr tho who's 13blackplus?
general 2020-08-06 03:53:51 Communism doesn't sound that good as an idea, but capitalism did go wrong in the USA
general 2020-08-06 03:54:41 Meanwhile Europe and some S.E Asian countries are doing alright compared to literally everyone else
general 2020-08-06 03:55:31 Problem with TikTok is do you trust software where it can be potentially exploited by China
general 2020-08-06 03:56:36 <@!544683852384174093> Actually I can't argue with that
The USA is also guilty of spyware
general 2020-08-06 03:57:16 If I remember, wasn't there a Chinese software ban in India?
general 2020-08-06 03:57:53 Here are two things I know about TikTok over here in the Philippines
1.) Cringy teens love it
2.) Decent celebs also use it
general 2020-08-06 03:59:34 <@!546223347025969164> My experience on Twitter tells me that'll be a bad thing

Just look at all those weirdphiles which I heard came from Tumblr
general 2020-08-06 04:00:16 Twitter's pretty decent as a social media platform

You just gotta use filters, *emphasis on fliters*
general 2020-08-06 04:00:26 From there it should cater to your liking
general 2020-08-06 04:00:41 Doesn't Instagram have a TikTok compettitor
general 2020-08-06 04:01:05 There are a few subreddits I use, mainly
r/polandball
general 2020-08-06 04:01:40 r/polandball is a decent subreddit
general 2020-08-06 04:03:00 We should stop
general 2020-08-06 04:03:51 Half Triangle Wedge Block when?
general 2020-08-06 04:04:19 When motor uwu?

You're welcome
general 2020-08-06 04:05:07 **Custom wedge maker when?**
general 2020-08-06 04:05:22 *sad wedge noises*

general 2020-08-06 04:05:55 Plane Crazy in Plane Crazy when?
general 2020-08-06 04:06:35 ***we must invade rick to force him to softcode***
general 2020-08-06 04:06:55 This chat too entertaining
general 2020-08-06 04:07:03 Gonna force myself to go so I can actually build
general 2020-08-06 04:07:30 1x5 delta wings
general 2020-08-06 04:08:08 xp

general 2020-08-06 04:09:47 yes
general 2020-08-06 04:17:03 If I had a braincell everytime someone bothers me in PC, I would've made an Anti-Bacon System by now
general 2020-08-06 04:35:13 <@!697369825902854184> Better get a rank so you can get access to PC's official private servers
general 2020-08-06 04:36:32 @ a mod if you need to ask something about ranks
general 2020-08-06 04:37:17 2K blocks is enough to get you at least Aero Engineer III
general 2020-08-06 04:37:35 Oh I was talking about XYZ's cargo plane
general 2020-08-06 04:37:52 It's fine, simple misunderstanding
general 2020-08-06 04:38:31 <@!645128367611445248> I can relate with my suspension design
general 2020-08-06 04:40:29 I mostly deal with land vehicles and aerospace
general 2020-08-06 04:41:05 What about ballast tanks?
general 2020-08-06 04:41:12 To make it f l o a t
general 2020-08-06 04:42:11 why am i procrastinating so hard
general 2020-08-06 04:42:23 I still haven't made the dragon or the hillclimb car
general 2020-08-06 04:42:45 I have a friend with a Warthog
general 2020-08-06 04:43:05 Is the Warthog the new F-22/F-35?
general 2020-08-06 04:43:11 In the sense that it's overbuilt
general 2020-08-06 04:44:27 If Plane Crazy had an economy

Then the Warthog/F-35/F-22/A-10 would've experienced hyperinflation
general 2020-08-06 04:44:42 <@456226577798135808> Except for those that teach how to build parts/guides that force you to build your own plane
general 2020-08-06 04:45:09 Sure why not
general 2020-08-06 04:46:01 https://www.roblox.com/users/292743669/profile This?
general 2020-08-06 04:49:05 oh wait it's L not i
general 2020-08-06 05:14:43 Thinking of how I'll add a moving mouth and teeth to a dragon
general 2020-08-06 05:14:58 And a better head
general 2020-08-06 05:15:36 Should I even add teeth?
general 2020-08-06 05:16:15 That made me think of the Toyota Mega Cruiser
general 2020-08-06 05:17:03 It looks like it's possible to add weapons on that Toyota
general 2020-08-06 05:17:07 Though you'll have to give it some size
general 2020-08-06 05:18:14 Well crap I don't stuff about Toyotas in combat
general 2020-08-06 05:18:54 Look what I found while looking for dragons to give my poo-brain ideas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6B7V69JUws
general 2020-08-06 05:20:58 Can anyone here link me to a guide for mechs
general 2020-08-06 05:22:16 In the meantime I might just try to build a supersonic fighter
general 2020-08-06 05:22:38 Not replacing my other fighter, was just thinking of taking advantage of conveyor drives
general 2020-08-06 05:23:48 I guess I still have more stuff to learn about making a good plane
general 2020-08-06 05:24:22 Though I am learning how to make some stable conveyor drives
general 2020-08-06 05:24:47 And boy do variable sweep wings and canards help in controlling that pitch issue
general 2020-08-06 05:25:30 <@!287779983445721088> Give me examples of some good variable sweep wing fighters
general 2020-08-06 05:25:44 Because rn I can only think of building an F-14
general 2020-08-06 05:27:01 ?
general 2020-08-06 05:29:05 I guess it's F-14 then
general 2020-08-06 05:31:32 I know what I'll do with this
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Grumman_F-14_Tomcat_SDASM.jpg
general 2020-08-06 05:31:37 Increased roll
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 05:32:10 I might do an F-14 Tomcat again, and seeing this exists https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Grumman_F-14_Tomcat_SDASM.jpg
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 05:32:22 I might take advantage of it to increase manuverability
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 05:32:50 F-14 Tomcat
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 05:33:01 With variable sweep wings that can sweep individually
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 05:33:31 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Grumman_F-14_Tomcat_SDASM.jpg
Wait, does this even increase roll/yaw?
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 05:33:45 Like one wing is unswept while the other is swept
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 05:34:16 <@!404539659440488468> Plane Crazy being hardcoded, at least that's what rick said
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 05:36:11 MSFS
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 05:36:40 Well I'll go copy that then
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 05:37:06 <@!435946988559925248> Wait are they actually gonna make it? Or is it just brought up?
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 05:38:35 So ST in ST-21 is Super Tomcat
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 05:40:54 https://the-drive-2.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-drive-cms-content-staging%2Fmessage-editor%252F1567534822690-f-14082.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&ixlib=js-1.4.1&s=651c9b4c4daba0dff16209c6750d01df Interesting

plane-crazy 2020-08-06 05:57:21 Anyone have ideas on how to design a good intake ramp? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake_ramp
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 05:57:37 Or should I just go for a Diverterless Supersonic Inlet?
general 2020-08-06 06:06:41 Lots of explosives
general 2020-08-06 06:07:25 How do people end up making good ramp intakes?
general 2020-08-06 06:07:37 Ramp intakes are like the ones used in the F-14
general 2020-08-06 06:07:59 Or should I use just use DSIs?
general 2020-08-06 06:08:35 @.Zeon#3363?

general 2020-08-06 07:28:37 What do y'all think of this?
general 2020-08-06 07:28:51 Well, these are canards
general 2020-08-06 07:29:06 Wanted something a little different from my typical straight canards
general 2020-08-06 07:29:24 I was originally gonna attempt the Sukhoi Su-33 canards but then I thought these look pretty neat
general 2020-08-06 07:29:38 Because canards aren't h y o o o g e
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 07:33:33 What would be a nice color scheme for digital urban camo?
help 2020-08-06 07:36:08 Any good urban camo colors?
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 07:38:56 That's an app
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 07:39:00 On Android
general 2020-08-06 07:44:16 Why does this Sukhoi look oddly looks like a starter fighter https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Sukhoi_Su-24_inflight_Mishin-2.jpg
general 2020-08-06 07:44:30 like it's very bloccy
general 2020-08-06 07:45:14 <@!723419054114865202> You know those fat cylinders of a fighter?
general 2020-08-06 07:45:33 Let me get what I'm talking about
general 2020-08-06 07:46:27 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/740469820310421504 Something like this
general 2020-08-06 07:46:36 Except the Sukhoi Su-24 is just blockier
general 2020-08-06 07:47:07 Guess it's just the view in the pic
general 2020-08-06 07:47:17 ***C h o n k***
general 2020-08-06 07:47:37 Gonna go find some variable sweep wings that don't have ramp air intakes
general 2020-08-06 07:47:54 Looks like only the Dassault Mirage G
general 2020-08-06 07:48:09 And maybe the F-111 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/An_air-to-air_left_front_view_of_an_F-111_aircraft_during_a_refueling_mission_over_the_North_Sea_DF-ST-89-03609.jpg
general 2020-08-06 07:48:50 Only reason I wanted variable sweep wings is for conveyor drive pitching
general 2020-08-06 07:49:28 <@!723419054114865202> I'm not good with ramp air intakes, such as on the Tomcat
general 2020-08-06 07:49:42 I end up getting a blocky plane
general 2020-08-06 07:50:08 I'm having a brainfuck trying to imagine one rn
general 2020-08-06 07:50:33 Making plane curved yet somehow manage to not make it look ugly by being boxy
general 2020-08-06 07:51:16 That could work
general 2020-08-06 07:51:44 So intakes tilted
general 2020-08-06 07:51:49 Use wings for the intakes
general 2020-08-06 07:52:26 Should I use half wedges or triangle wedges for the section above the intakes?
general 2020-08-06 07:52:57 U h h h
The part that doesn't move and is above the intakes, idk xd
general 2020-08-06 07:53:24 Yes, the tilted part above the tilted intake
general 2020-08-06 07:53:46 wait I forgot you said wedges
general 2020-08-06 07:53:55 Well, I'll go use wedges for now
general 2020-08-06 07:54:10 Because my smol brain is already struggling with planning
general 2020-08-06 07:54:19 Well, at least I've found a way to not make it so boxy
general 2020-08-06 07:55:10 I think I'll just resort to keeping it simple
general 2020-08-06 07:55:20 I'll probably learn about it the more I build
general 2020-08-06 07:56:40 Well crap I've already started progress on a custom fighter
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 09:53:01 Thinking of making a blended wing design for a variable wing sweep aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 09:53:11 That a good idea on a fighter?
general 2020-08-06 10:05:01 https://www.google.com/search?q=plane+digital+camo&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj9zLLrqYbrAhWsHqYKHasTDQwQ_AUoAXoECA0QAw&biw=1344&bih=726 Guess I'll just download an image to get the colors for digital camo

plane-crazy 2020-08-06 14:15:50 Still need to fix issues relating to pitch
general 2020-08-06 14:16:34 Mad was here?
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 14:17:24 If it's planes, probably wings
general 2020-08-06 14:21:37 I just use dark grey
general 2020-08-06 14:22:33 10k is a lot
general 2020-08-06 14:23:08 My biggest build is a plane at 3.8K blocks
general 2020-08-06 15:55:56 **I thought I'd never see those numbers**
general 2020-08-06 15:56:32 Well i need sleep now it's almost 12
general 2020-08-06 23:37:33 What happened here?
general 2020-08-06 23:44:01 Don't lie if it's serious.
general 2020-08-06 23:44:59 Assuming he's willing to come though
general 2020-08-06 23:46:24 I probably shouldn't butt in
general 2020-08-06 23:46:34 I know nothing
general 2020-08-06 23:47:44 I don't even know
general 2020-08-06 23:49:12 I'll just go back to my usual routine then, ignoring some problems within this country
general 2020-08-06 23:52:22 This sounds like something I shouldn't involve myself too much in
plane-crazy 2020-08-06 23:54:49 Current day Russia has one of the intimidating militaries, both in manpower and in technology

plane-crazy 2020-08-07 01:02:52 Tbh I just wanted urban camo
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 01:03:08 Digital would be nice tho

plane-crazy 2020-08-07 01:05:30 Because I'm bad at ramp intakes
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 01:05:48 The only reason I wanted variable sweep wings was for the conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 01:06:38 I mean Minecraft's all about building when the name says something about mining and crafting
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 01:07:10 Aw man

general 2020-08-07 01:39:34 I remembered that one image where I did inspect element
general 2020-08-07 01:39:42 And edited Rick's name to "Pickie-Rickie~"
general 2020-08-07 01:39:45 And made him say UWU

general 2020-08-07 01:40:22 XD
general 2020-08-07 01:40:49 Should I make another cursed image of Rick?

help 2020-08-07 01:54:10 Is this fine or should I change how it's painted
help 2020-08-07 01:54:22 Still gonnna keep the colors considering I'm aiming for an urban camo
help 2020-08-07 01:56:30 <@!660019099430289418> Autocorrect wants bacon strips
help 2020-08-07 02:04:10 <@456226577798135808> Still applies the same to every other vehicle
A Warthog for example would go into terrain specalist, anything that flies aero engineer, etc.
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 02:18:28 I've made the plane have self correcting roll
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 02:19:15 wait no I forgot to disable control surfaces xp
general 2020-08-07 03:33:05 Same vibes as downvote if gay
general 2020-08-07 03:33:46 Who?
general 2020-08-07 03:35:07 To be fair, his vehicle isn't what I'd say upvote worthy, but it's not noob quality
general 2020-08-07 03:35:40 Still needs improvements
general 2020-08-07 03:35:54 Too much green, could use a grille
general 2020-08-07 03:36:03 The front's decent enough
general 2020-08-07 03:36:33 Well, how much has he been doing that?
general 2020-08-07 03:37:06 I'd excuse someone expecting up votes for the first few times
general 2020-08-07 03:37:13 But if it's everytime
general 2020-08-07 03:37:21 Then that's just being unrealistic
general 2020-08-07 03:38:09 People who think they rule the world really be giving off bad vibes
general 2020-08-07 03:38:12 Such as him
general 2020-08-07 03:38:54 I just do whatever the heck I want, I learned the hard way ever since my first huge build
general 2020-08-07 03:39:42 Like life here be like that, don't expect upvotes everytime, same as vice versa
general 2020-08-07 03:40:26 Besides, those downvotes should be thought as "still needs improvement" not "lol noob"
general 2020-08-07 03:41:05 I mean there are some who do the latter but still, don't take downvotes too seriously
general 2020-08-07 03:42:27 For me it depends
general 2020-08-07 03:43:05 If I see no effort was truly placed at all, then I downvote
general 2020-08-07 03:43:37 But if I think that they tried, well you won't get any upvotes but I won't downvote either
general 2020-08-07 03:45:55 I remembered this one time
general 2020-08-07 03:46:11 Someone had a red blocky plane (absolutely no wedges)
general 2020-08-07 03:46:25 I downvoted it, because it's not that hard to put some wedges on a blocky cylinder
general 2020-08-07 03:47:03 The next day I received "Why'd you downvote my build bro" in DMs
general 2020-08-07 03:48:09 I just ignored
general 2020-08-07 03:48:25 It's just gonna go down in hell if I replied
general 2020-08-07 03:49:45 I can see why that's satisfying 

Reminds me of the time I argued with an anti-LGBT edgelord
general 2020-08-07 03:50:29 Funny how the kid called that I'm obsessed over his pathetic ass when he's obsessed on making friends
general 2020-08-07 03:50:54 Like he said "I'll merk you"

I'm a brown belt in martial arts, doubt he'll do that
general 2020-08-07 03:51:53 He also has a "body building" Discord
general 2020-08-07 03:52:07 Literally the thumbnail is a horrifying edit of Spongebob
general 2020-08-07 03:52:17 And his profile picture looks like a fat sombie
general 2020-08-07 03:52:28 Yeah I do karate
general 2020-08-07 03:52:41 But quarantine made me stop
general 2020-08-07 03:53:22 Honestly those karate lessons were fun tbh
general 2020-08-07 03:54:27 <@168872475701018624> Now I remembered that one meme on the Internet 

1.) Judo - the art of folding clothes while people are still in them
general 2020-08-07 03:54:49 XD
general 2020-08-07 03:55:23 <@335599526414909451> Reminds me of that one disastrous diet candy named Aids
general 2020-08-07 03:55:32 That was actually a real thing
general 2020-08-07 03:56:16 Cookie Monster what happened to you
general 2020-08-07 03:56:32 ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
general 2020-08-07 03:56:58 The only thing they did was to rebrand as "Diet Aids"
general 2020-08-07 03:57:17 Like that's not gonna help when there's a *viral* thing out there with the same name
general 2020-08-07 03:58:07 A YouTuber said from his personal experience that Gatorade helps him when he's very hungover
general 2020-08-07 03:58:21 Channel is Business Blaze
general 2020-08-07 03:59:48 Oof, okay
general 2020-08-07 03:59:51 Well
general 2020-08-07 04:00:05 I'm just gonna go do my stuff then
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:22:48 
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:22:54 Just uploading this here for <#384025409945337856>
general 2020-08-07 04:27:49 I wonder how my build would fare up today
general 2020-08-07 04:28:11 oh im asian
general 2020-08-07 04:28:17 im a dumbass :>
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:29:29 yes, now we both wait
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:30:50 I mean if you think about it a lot of fighters are pretty similar aren't they?
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:34:24 :/

general 2020-08-07 04:40:28 Tencent? Aren't they Chinese?
general 2020-08-07 04:40:43 Why am I feeling there's gonna be a huge controversy
general 2020-08-07 04:40:51 Similiar to the one that happened to TikTok
general 2020-08-07 04:41:01 Yeah fair
general 2020-08-07 04:41:33 I feel like if they went the route Minecraft did, which is to release one catered to the Chinese market, it wouldn't be so bad
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:43:56 99's Su57 is nice
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:44:00 Not too big, just right
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:44:42 Yeah I've seen that too
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:44:55 Nothing's really gonna stop me from downvoting
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:45:42 Nothing's unfair here in this server, unless you're some edgelord
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:46:03 <@!572411935669354528> I upvoted it, it's blursed in a good way
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:48:08 oof
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:49:57 Considering we're already here
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:50:05 Tell me what I can do to make my plane better?
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:52:40 Aight, understandable Raiken
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:53:05 Kinda already thought so that the pattern wasn't that good
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:54:29 That's shameless
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:54:40 Imagine being so low you upvote your own builds
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:54:54 Not Dragons
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:55:24 Well at least you don't do it now
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:55:46 I wonder if someone here before did "upvote if not gay" or something like that
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:58:06 If I have to rate my own building skills, it'd be like if I were to be meme man
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:58:45 white?
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:59:11 You got my upvotes
creations-chat 2020-08-07 04:59:38 Oh the guy who built a Jeep?
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:00:02 I'm just happy I could build something somewhat decent
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:00:05 Basically not blocky
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:01:09 I mean Jeep's just a name
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:01:24 As long as it can off-road, then I consider it a Jeep
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:01:48 Toyotas make for decent off-roaders
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:02:39 Meanwhile the most they went to making a Hummer is the Toyota Mega Cruiser
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:02:55 Literally a Japanese Hummer
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:03:49 Mine is ***S t e a m e d   H a m s***
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:04:01 Make it green
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:04:18 And add a pineapple underwater xp
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:04:28 A pineapple, a rock and a tiki head
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:04:35 Totally not related to something else
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:05:10 Pollution
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:05:34 I mean why would there be metal buildings, crab traps and pineapples underwater
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:05:44 Make your ship actually fly too
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:06:03 <@!577655331229007872> How about ship that can fly, go underwater and sail on water
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:06:38 What do you mean by "fly"
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:06:45 oh it's fast ship
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:07:09 I'll go make an off-roader now
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:07:20 Well, what about a ship that actually flies?
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:07:32 I'll go build the Peugeot 405 T16 Pikes Peak now
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:09:52 <@!410992368494575626> nice gradient
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:10:02 like that's buttery smooth
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:10:48 Outlines help though when building
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:11:09 How?
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:11:17 That's like saying gridlines when drawing don't help
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:12:15 jUsT pAiNt iT a DiFfErEnT cOlOr
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:12:26 Y'know what I'll just go
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:12:35 No point in beating a dead horse to argue
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:20:51 Olin, ignore the troll
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:21:31 <@!387195148741771275> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96hlins I immediately thought of this randomly
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:21:57 **olin**denver
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:22:13 **Öhlins** Racing AB
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:22:50 yes, you're a racing suspension
creations-chat 2020-08-07 05:23:06 you make high quality rides
general 2020-08-07 05:27:54 Lost motivation in building a Peugeot 405
general 2020-08-07 05:28:03 Gonna try building a VW Racing Touareg
general 2020-08-07 05:31:42 I could with olin after spending time with him
general 2020-08-07 05:32:01 He's a Swedish racing suspension
general 2020-08-07 05:32:38 I'll go search up for more Dakar Rally cars
general 2020-08-07 05:33:31 Yes
general 2020-08-07 05:33:39 Apparently a Toyota Hilux won 2019
general 2020-08-07 05:34:03 I think I'll go do a Land Rover again
general 2020-08-07 05:34:10 Still gonna try building the Peugeot
general 2020-08-07 05:36:34 Let his PFP rest in peace
general 2020-08-07 05:36:39 You need to move on
general 2020-08-07 05:41:35 at this point I'm just building a generic off-roader
general 2020-08-07 05:41:43 Poodle?
general 2020-08-07 05:42:06 This isn't <#495286269459300364>
general 2020-08-07 05:42:42 Oh I meant the guy who's posting vids here
general 2020-08-07 05:42:57 Can we get a mod if they don't stop
general 2020-08-07 05:44:12 Irony
general 2020-08-07 05:44:42 <@!216193164199985152> Could you deal with this guy, spamming videos in the chat and generally being toxic
general 2020-08-07 05:45:06 Aight fine
general 2020-08-07 05:46:31 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
general 2020-08-07 05:47:02 This chat gives me this vibe from an edited rickroll
"Your heart's been aching, but I don't give a shit"
general 2020-08-07 05:48:52 <@!387195148741771275> We're already talking to one, he's been spamming the whole time
general 2020-08-07 05:49:09 No
general 2020-08-07 05:49:21 Nor will I ever expect something good
general 2020-08-07 05:49:46 Just migrate to <#495286269459300364>
general 2020-08-07 05:51:03 We have been bamboozled
general 2020-08-07 05:51:55 <@!429826358827417601> Here, fresh content

general 2020-08-07 05:54:03 
general 2020-08-07 05:54:10 Just a regular day in Plane Crazy
general 2020-08-07 05:55:09 kermit or die?
general 2020-08-07 05:56:36 The dump is back
general 2020-08-07 06:07:45 13blackplus? Isn't he the unoriginal teenage cringelord copycat?
general 2020-08-07 06:08:43 This is why I feel good that I know technical stuff
general 2020-08-07 06:08:48 Stuff this kid will never learn
general 2020-08-07 06:09:02 Such as conveyor drive stabilization
general 2020-08-07 06:10:28 There is a difference between criticizing a person because of his skin color and criticizing a person because of something he did and just so happens to be a PoC
general 2020-08-07 06:10:45 Learn how to get those two things right
general 2020-08-07 06:13:58 Rank?
general 2020-08-07 06:14:12 wait rank in what?
general 2020-08-07 06:31:22 Can a build be considered VTOL if I have to use the elevators to keep it stable?
general 2020-08-07 06:32:02 Looks like I have something to submit for VTOL
general 2020-08-07 06:32:55 Has a bit of pitching issue though
general 2020-08-07 06:33:00 It sorta rocks
general 2020-08-07 06:33:06 Like that duck toy
general 2020-08-07 06:33:14 nice shaders
general 2020-08-07 06:33:22 Also I notice you're using a 32x resource pack
general 2020-08-07 06:33:59 I use uhh, I forgot
general 2020-08-07 06:34:49 <@!287779983445721088> I use Sildur's, they even have an Enhanced Default for those on the really low end
https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/
general 2020-08-07 06:35:20 I find Sildur's does the job for me
general 2020-08-07 06:35:28 Might switch though if BSL does a better job
general 2020-08-07 06:37:45 What's obc?
general 2020-08-07 06:38:21 What's obc?
general 2020-08-07 06:38:57 I just need a few more blocks to get VTOL II
general 2020-08-07 06:39:09 Now where can I add block count
general 2020-08-07 06:39:19 Like literally just 2 or 3 blocks
general 2020-08-07 06:39:51 I think I'll just add a few more designs
general 2020-08-07 06:40:14 Maybe some oleo strut (piston) suspension at the rear
general 2020-08-07 06:40:50 chair
general 2020-08-07 06:40:59 add 1x2 wings beside it
general 2020-08-07 06:41:05 add 1x2 control surfaces behind
general 2020-08-07 06:41:12 reverse thrust propeller at the back
general 2020-08-07 06:41:31 Wait I thought designer and inventor were unobtainable?
general 2020-08-07 06:41:56 ***o h w a i t***
general 2020-08-07 06:42:35 oof I was about to illustrate something

general 2020-08-07 08:20:02 Should I go back to playing Minecraft?
general 2020-08-07 08:20:03 I have mods
general 2020-08-07 08:20:36 Maybe I should go back to playing Minecraft every now and then
general 2020-08-07 08:20:38 And go back to my roots
general 2020-08-07 08:20:41 Of doing redstone
general 2020-08-07 08:21:48 It's one of those games that's fun, you just gotta deal with kids
general 2020-08-07 08:21:52 Kinda like PvP in PC

general 2020-08-07 08:23:52 it's hard to breathe

general 2020-08-07 09:46:49 Honestly I've only watched one, and I didn't really get into it that much
general 2020-08-07 09:46:59 In fact now that I think about it I wasn't really into it too now
general 2020-08-07 09:47:40 Honestly the only experience I have with Dragon Ball
general 2020-08-07 09:48:02 I also used to watch Pokemon tbh
general 2020-08-07 09:48:07 Used to

plane-crazy 2020-08-07 09:49:02 it gets smaller
general 2020-08-07 09:49:38 <@!287779983445721088> Fvlvia, what shaders do you suggest I get?
general 2020-08-07 09:49:47 For light-end desktops
general 2020-08-07 09:50:17 AMD A8-7600 with AMD Radeon HD6670
general 2020-08-07 14:11:19 Only in Bedrock you can push chests in Minecraft
general 2020-08-07 14:12:03 I mean there's other ways to hide chests
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 14:17:41 BabaAlganx really be reposting builds
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 14:33:27 I'm making an off-roading coupe, which I'll continue tomorrow
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 14:34:08 Kinda like in the body style of the Mitsubishi Racing Lancer (rally raid, Dakar Rally)
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 15:39:15 Could use some work but not bad
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 15:39:37 ^
general 2020-08-07 23:21:11 Send SCP-096 to undes
general 2020-08-07 23:21:45 Don't send them the furry bait SCP though
general 2020-08-07 23:22:01 Like they're too young to discover that crap
general 2020-08-07 23:22:22 Just 096 should be enough
general 2020-08-07 23:24:21 Well, considering we're talking about SCPs, have this 
https://www.youtube.com/c/SCPAnimatedTalesFromTheFoundation
general 2020-08-07 23:24:46 I started with the infinite Ikea
general 2020-08-07 23:25:49 Looks like I've missed a bit of content from him
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 23:26:24 It's blocky
general 2020-08-07 23:37:42 oof
general 2020-08-07 23:45:10 I'm just fine using VS Code
general 2020-08-07 23:45:23 It gets the job done doing basic Python
general 2020-08-07 23:45:37 Which I did do up until I discovered Plane Crazy
general 2020-08-07 23:47:10 ~~anyone still remember "Pickie-Rickie~" and "Rickje Chan"~~
general 2020-08-07 23:49:32 
general 2020-08-07 23:50:09 Gives me unde vibes
general 2020-08-07 23:52:36 Let's see 
- Sirenhead PFP 
- Status: "ROBLOX DA BEST 😎"
- Who names themselves after literal shit
general 2020-08-07 23:52:57 Plus that idea gives me unde vibes
general 2020-08-07 23:53:18 Because this is a building game with some PvP, not a survival game
general 2020-08-07 23:54:04 There's a setting to disable automatically changing into emojis
general 2020-08-07 23:54:17 :)
general 2020-08-07 23:56:17 Sappy
general 2020-08-07 23:56:20 Happy and sad
general 2020-08-07 23:56:29 Or that's just a wrinkly face
general 2020-08-07 23:56:57 Yes
general 2020-08-07 23:57:13 Remember when blacklists were gone that one time
general 2020-08-07 23:57:55 KSP is space themed PC
general 2020-08-07 23:58:18 Those are some low mounted engines
general 2020-08-07 23:59:40 I suggest moving the engines higher, somewhere where it won't scrape against the ground
general 2020-08-08 00:00:10 Only reason engines are mounted low on some planes is for easier access when doing maintainance (when it doesn't scrape against the ground ofc)
general 2020-08-08 00:01:57 The poopoo guy in <#384021699466756107>
general 2020-08-08 00:02:19 The way he typed those in is a dead giveaway
general 2020-08-08 00:02:43 Probably an unde, tell a mod to provide proof of age
general 2020-08-08 00:03:27 Well, if it doesn't scrape against the ground then that's fine by me
general 2020-08-08 00:03:41 Rocket engines are pretty stable for me
general 2020-08-08 00:04:23 An increase in speed requires more wings to prevent planes from being unstable
general 2020-08-08 00:06:57 Searching his chat history, it seems yousuf already seems to have verified his age
general 2020-08-08 00:07:11 Probably could be just barely 13
general 2020-08-08 00:10:00 > how are rockets unstable
<@615876745710534676> That's what I thought 

Rather than the rocket itself, it's more like the plane has already reached it's top speed and going any further would make it unstable
general 2020-08-08 00:10:47 Generally, you'd want more wings. The easiest way would be wider wingspan if you don't wanna rebuild the body
general 2020-08-08 00:11:18 There's also redesigning the tail wings or adding canards
general 2020-08-08 00:11:41 If you want something more passive, just add some hidden wing panels/motor lock them
general 2020-08-08 00:12:13 If it keeps pitching up, add ballasts in front
general 2020-08-08 00:12:26 If it nose dives, I just use titled canards or some other active wing adjustment
general 2020-08-08 00:14:12 <@615876745710534676> What are booms?
general 2020-08-08 00:15:16 Well, I dunno if I should try adding booms
general 2020-08-08 00:16:02 Aight, if I find a good place to put it
general 2020-08-08 00:16:30 y my ticket still not accepted? Like it's still there
general 2020-08-08 00:17:34 Speaking of which, I wonder if they'll accept that I used the elevators to assist my plane's VTOL
general 2020-08-08 00:18:03 Because without it, my plane would initiate into gliding nose dive
general 2020-08-08 00:18:34 A gliding nose dive kinda sounds like another potential way to control landing
general 2020-08-08 00:21:07 Possibly, if the wings were damaged
general 2020-08-08 00:21:56 yes
general 2020-08-08 00:22:27 Anyways I'm gonna go have some breakfast pizza
general 2020-08-08 00:22:35 No, not really
general 2020-08-08 00:22:50 That's the job of the wings and control surfaces
general 2020-08-08 00:23:29 Nope, only three kinds of blocks can change center of lift
general 2020-08-08 00:23:41 Though anything that has weight can change center of mass
general 2020-08-08 00:24:30 Anyways brb
general 2020-08-08 00:24:34 Im hungry
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:43:54 I searched his chat history
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:44:07 yousuf already checked about his age
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:44:36 Probably *barely* 13
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:45:25 Let's just say some minds bloom later than others
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:46:25 Dude his chat history says otherwise
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:47:12 I dunno
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:48:07 Aight, I guess we should make him give more concrete proof of age
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:48:28 Like even a simple school I.D (censor some stuff ofc) might give a loose clue
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:49:39 Oh, over here ours mention if we're in 10th grade, etc.
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:49:46 Yeah that
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:49:54 That's what I was thinking of
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:50:19 The grade you're in is a good clue to know your age
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:50:52 I've became 16 recently, I'm about to be in 10th grade somewhere around late August
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:51:27 My birthday happened not that long ago
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:51:43 Which is why I have pizza
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:51:59 Nope
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:52:12 I heard my parents won a motorcycle
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:52:15 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:52:24 16, 10th grade
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:52:35 Works differently
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:53:19 Normally, classes start during June here
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:53:30 But because of the current pandemic...
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:53:41 Classes start in late August
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:53:48 Just right after my birthday
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 00:54:10 We should
general 2020-08-08 00:54:34 I don't really carry any weapons
general 2020-08-08 00:54:38 I use my body
general 2020-08-08 00:54:45 No
general 2020-08-08 00:54:57 Like fists, kicks and those kind of stuff
general 2020-08-08 00:55:25 But even then I doubt I'll be doing those
general 2020-08-08 00:55:41 Martial arts over here
general 2020-08-08 00:57:02 I'm 16 and I'm not in America, so weapons would be useless because of legal stuff for me
general 2020-08-08 00:57:55 ~~look I made a subtle jab about the US and guns xp, okay I'm a bit sorry about that~~
general 2020-08-08 00:58:33 Same
general 2020-08-08 00:58:46 So I just relax
general 2020-08-08 00:59:01 I live in Jazz's shed
general 2020-08-08 01:01:32 I live in a small structure that is made out of wood that stores equipment such as tools and paint that can be used as shelter, and said small structure is made out of wood and said structure has a owner of the highest standards whose name is JazzMuse
general 2020-08-08 01:08:59 <@287779983445721088> I have a random thought, use locked motors as light bars
general 2020-08-08 01:09:11 You know those lights they place on the roof
general 2020-08-08 01:09:43 Color the shaft white and the base a dark grey
general 2020-08-08 01:11:07 Aight
general 2020-08-08 01:11:17 Also I went for something simpler this time
general 2020-08-08 01:11:47 A hybrid of a Volkswagen Racing Touareg and a Mitsubishi Racing Lancer
general 2020-08-08 01:11:55 And then modify the design a little
general 2020-08-08 01:12:21 Well, gtg 

Battery low
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 02:00:59 So Inner Wedge?
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 02:01:15 And outer wedge?
<@!659435410820169759>
general 2020-08-08 02:08:30 <@!615876745710534676> A custom bot
general 2020-08-08 02:08:43 <@!660341617537843210>
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 02:12:30 If the rear wheel being too fast for the front wheels is what causes drifting in this game, then would using an extra set of motors to control wheel speed when turning a good idea?
general 2020-08-08 03:08:09 That's just blatant ageism
general 2020-08-08 03:08:57 <@!505835349889777685> Why am I getting 19th century America vibes from this
general 2020-08-08 03:09:17 Back when the US was fine with outright lack of concern for human rights
general 2020-08-08 03:11:12 There are two kinds of boomers

One that we usually associate with "okay boomer", and ones that are pretty decent
general 2020-08-08 03:12:15 To be honest, you really need to get that issue resolved
general 2020-08-08 03:13:22 It also seems to be kinda ironic he said anyone born after 2000 only cares about what they want, when he seems to be quite controlling and wants everything to be what he wants
general 2020-08-08 03:13:59 brb (sorry)
general 2020-08-08 03:19:41 <@!505835349889777685> That's just racist
general 2020-08-08 03:20:00 It's best to judge someone based on their actions, not on something as abritary as skin color
general 2020-08-08 03:20:31 He is a walking contradiction, going by that logic
general 2020-08-08 03:23:53 1.) Hopefully things go better for you Sav
2.) The heck I just ate pizza for breakfast
general 2020-08-08 03:25:04 SAL you didn't saw anything
general 2020-08-08 03:26:20 Unblacklisted? Like from the server itself or from plots?
general 2020-08-08 03:28:28 When I feel down, I just do what makes me happy
general 2020-08-08 03:28:40 Or distract myself
general 2020-08-08 03:30:27 My brain has awake, and I almost forgot
general 2020-08-08 03:30:40 I should probably set my priorities correctly
general 2020-08-08 03:36:24 <@!671156550546751550> Let me guess, flashy intentionally laggy tutorial noodle like dragon?
general 2020-08-08 03:37:39 Best you can do Axitraz is to just avoid getting too close, to avoid receiving the full effect of the lag
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 03:38:08 Fixed my trailing arm suspension
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 03:38:21 Seems the suspension got jammed by one of the motor bearings
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 03:41:00 <@456226577798135808> Have you tested it in that grey area near the ocean and desert? Does it ride over that bumpy area as smooth as butter?
general 2020-08-08 03:49:57 So he is, in a nutshell, an abusive contradiction?
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 03:51:10 It looks like they're worshipping a swashplate
general 2020-08-08 03:52:54 Savoic, even under these horrible conditions you live under, I'm impressed by the fact you're mentally strongwilled
general 2020-08-08 03:53:34 And I've never heard of anyone that can control their sleep
general 2020-08-08 03:54:21 Just stay close to what comforts and supports you
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 03:55:26 <@578011055079555085> Folding
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 03:56:36 Do tilted wings have the same effect as blades have?
general 2020-08-08 03:57:33 I saw the one pure posted in <#384021699466756107> 

***W o r s h i p   t h e   s w a s h p l a t e***

general 2020-08-08 03:58:52 Like physically?
general 2020-08-08 03:59:06 <@324815581368811520> same here 

I'm a desktop normie
general 2020-08-08 03:59:51 AMD A8-7600 Accelerated Processing Unit with integrated Radeon R7 that blows away my computer's HD6670
general 2020-08-08 04:00:17 Alongside some 8 GB of RAM that Windows 10 seems to eat up
general 2020-08-08 04:00:29 Damn if only my dad approved of me using Linux
general 2020-08-08 04:00:48 So I don't have the RAM-eater OS
general 2020-08-08 04:01:21 <@335599526414909451> You seem to know stuff about computers

Does Windows 10 eat RAM or not?
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 04:01:59 Well I guess I could try a swashplate when I try helicopters

general 2020-08-08 04:03:07 Ah good
general 2020-08-08 04:03:20 8 GB should be good for some light gaming then
general 2020-08-08 04:03:31 What about Asus?
general 2020-08-08 04:08:04 <@335599526414909451> One last thing, what about these?

APU - AMD A8
iGPU - Radeon R7 
GPU - Radeon HD6670

Is it good enough for some casual gaming? And other tasks like video editing if one of my subjects decides to make making a video a project
general 2020-08-08 04:08:23 I'm only on a HDD
general 2020-08-08 04:08:42 My dad gave me and my brother a perfectly fine computer
general 2020-08-08 04:09:02 Just wanted to know if these are good enough for a little bit more intensive tasks
general 2020-08-08 04:09:44 I ran Minecraft with light shaders one time 

It runs above 30 FPS with Sildur's Lite
general 2020-08-08 04:10:48 Thinking about it, if I run Sildur's at 30 FPS then I guess I have a decent low end PC
general 2020-08-08 04:11:01 I ran it under Optifine
general 2020-08-08 04:11:44 Is 30+ FPS running Minecraft with shaders and HD resource pack decent for a low end PC? <@492887853702053898>
general 2020-08-08 04:12:44 I guess the Radeon R7 iGPU helped a bit on top of my the Radeon HD6670 GPU
general 2020-08-08 04:13:13 <@324815581368811520> I placed a drawing over the camera in my bedroom 

I too am paranoid for malware taking a peek
general 2020-08-08 04:14:51 The new Mac Pro at the highest end specs will cost you a Mercedes
general 2020-08-08 04:15:24 I'm just waiting for the motorcycle to come
general 2020-08-08 04:16:00 <@324815581368811520> Get a laptop you can disassemble if it needs to be portable
general 2020-08-08 04:16:50 Apple Computers used to be quite good, back when it was the 80s
general 2020-08-08 04:17:01 Now it's just Rolls-Royce
general 2020-08-08 04:19:10 <@456226577798135808> Tbh the company went downhill ever since Steve Jobs died
general 2020-08-08 04:19:23 Now they're really bad
general 2020-08-08 04:19:31 Considering they rely on brand name
general 2020-08-08 04:21:38 What GPU are you using?
general 2020-08-08 04:21:56 <@492887853702053898> Settings
general 2020-08-08 04:22:00 Make it manual
general 2020-08-08 04:22:17 SkinJim
general 2020-08-08 04:22:42 <@492887853702053898> Rendering stuff is resource intensive, of course it's gonna eat into your GPU
general 2020-08-08 04:23:52 Only limiter I know is the ***oPeRa Gx LiMiTeR***
general 2020-08-08 04:24:13 Literally just a browser with RAM limiter
general 2020-08-08 04:24:51 Isn't the reason browsers eat RAM is for security reasons?
general 2020-08-08 04:24:58 Sandboxing I think
general 2020-08-08 04:25:23 It's like a virtual machin but for webpages isn't it?

general 2020-08-08 04:28:20 For my battery

creations-chat 2020-08-08 08:45:36 Taken a second before the shot was ruined
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 08:48:40 I made a thing, in creations
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 08:50:21 What about Cortana?
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 09:02:54 <@!645128367611445248> Did that guy literally took a piece of road, painted it white, plopped into the water and called it a carrier?
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 09:06:03 <@!645128367611445248>
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 09:06:05 
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 09:06:08 Look what I found
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 09:07:54 A drone, but why like that?
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 09:08:27 Now I remember that DJ set drone
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 09:10:33 I don't even know
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 09:43:15 <@670939038999511041> Same guy who posted the "downvote if degenrate" jeep literally reposted his Jeep and Toyota AE86 

Also, y'all have high standards
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 09:43:30 soldier
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 09:47:05 <@271299269984518155> Heard reposts aren't allowed so BabaAlganx2 reposted his Jeep and his Toyota AE86, also "downvote if degenerate"
general 2020-08-08 09:49:21 Random thought, landing gear looks like is perfect for the Reliant Robin (blue 3 wheeled Mr. Bean car)
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 09:49:45 Transforming jet?
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 09:52:50 I literally don't know what a transforming jet is
general 2020-08-08 09:53:06 Off brand uwu
general 2020-08-08 09:55:19 Well, what did you expect from a game with kids
general 2020-08-08 09:56:07 I just remembered when you surrounded me with shredder bugs
general 2020-08-08 09:56:17 And then I said those things
general 2020-08-08 09:56:33 You are the milccman
general 2020-08-08 09:56:52 stop
general 2020-08-08 09:57:32 You're sKaren me, I might have to call the manager
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 09:58:07 I saw Pickle did the job
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 09:58:56 Make a giant shredder
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 09:59:02 Made of cutters
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 10:00:06 Shredding shreddingly to shred undes to being red shredding their hair because they got shreddingly shredded shreddingly beyond shredding shredness.

I feel so braindead
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 10:00:30 Idfk know what to do
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 10:01:38 Cameras, and giving it a one block offset
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 10:01:51 Because it will literally rotate 90/180 degrees
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 10:45:39 I've managed to fit mine within a somewhat small car
general 2020-08-08 10:48:21 <@615876745710534676> Wait did I hear F2P?
general 2020-08-08 10:48:50 ~~also I missed an opportunity to get CHKN for free a long time ago~~
general 2020-08-08 10:51:01 I read suggestions
general 2020-08-08 10:51:17 A constant day and night cycle you can't disable ***sucks***
general 2020-08-08 10:51:36 I can't see in night so why would that be a good idea?
general 2020-08-08 10:54:05 <@654239873489960970> What's the difference?
general 2020-08-08 10:55:21 Well, it's a game that lets me build stuff
general 2020-08-08 10:55:30 Sounds like the kind of game I'd play
general 2020-08-08 10:55:59 Well, I'll go do stuff on PC now
general 2020-08-08 10:56:03 Because why not
creations-chat 2020-08-08 10:56:52 Until Roblox removed it
creations-chat 2020-08-08 10:58:42 A build mode only outlines as a suggestion?

creations-chat 2020-08-08 11:11:12 Thanks
general 2020-08-08 12:25:11 I'm gonna try learning how to build a swashplate
general 2020-08-08 12:25:17 Which is hard considering I know nothing xp
general 2020-08-08 12:25:51 ?
general 2020-08-08 12:27:01 What do I need to know when building a swashplate?
general 2020-08-08 12:27:54 This chat is becoming weird now
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 12:28:03 What do I need to learn about swashplates?
help 2020-08-08 12:28:56 How to build a swashplate?
general 2020-08-08 12:34:43 I might visit vip 1
general 2020-08-08 12:35:48 This exists https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AgustaWestland_AW609

general 2020-08-08 12:38:08 if it breaks
general 2020-08-08 12:43:39 Ah, parents back at it again with the classic insult to get attention
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 23:48:56 I remembered there's this one person who called motor locks "block compression"

You know what's the most cringe thing I heard from him, calling my build a "block compression car"
general 2020-08-08 23:49:16 Florida Man
general 2020-08-08 23:55:15 I misread bread bank
general 2020-08-08 23:56:07 Breed
general 2020-08-08 23:57:08 That's how I misread bread
general 2020-08-09 00:04:13 Sharks are just sea planes and planes are air sharks
general 2020-08-09 00:09:20 I live in typhoon
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 00:09:52 I build mine out of default
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 00:10:13 Because stone or slate is stone and slate, not smooth metal
help 2020-08-09 00:12:22 I just use unpowered motors and wedges, that get stretched by the very same wheels that power them
help 2020-08-09 00:13:24 I used Prototrode's outdated tread design
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:14:13 Does .mp4 provide better video quality/better data compression?
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:14:46 Like I wanna know outside of it being more secure here in PCC

general 2020-08-09 00:30:16 Rickrolled xp
general 2020-08-09 00:31:31 Good point but that's a lot of control surfaces
general 2020-08-09 00:32:11 Over here we use custom control surfaces made out of wing panels and motor 2s
general 2020-08-09 00:32:56 And those custom control surfaces really provide a lot of performance and looks better
general 2020-08-09 00:34:12 Allegedly
general 2020-08-09 00:34:47 I'll go take a look at the image
general 2020-08-09 00:36:00 <@692815897949372437> Well if you're gonna make a new one here's some advice 

Try to use custom control surfaces, which wing panels connected to motor 2s, using control surfaces only to prevent from welding 

Wedges are your friend, you'll need a lot of wedges to make a plane look good
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:37:23 You broke light speed
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 00:38:17 To unplane a plane?

creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:55:15 That's literally it, tiny controllable vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 00:56:14 Is it bad i find it funny?
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 00:56:29 That that itself is enough to warrant an even worse
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:35:56 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UJt2YS1pfk I'm gonna go watch this
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:36:02 So I can build tanks
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:36:08 That don't look like crap
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:36:54 <@!260797229068058634> It literally says guides
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:37:11 If I wanted a tutorial then I would've watched this noob https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsZ_ttUm5iQ
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:37:21 But no that's just unoriginal
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:39:10 <@!260797229068058634> So you're saying that I'm watching a tutorial for the sake of how it looks, not for technical stuff?
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:39:52 My god Blackbird I've been doing that to planes for quite a while now, using IRL images to get an idea of how stuff should look like
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:41:12 wdym new?
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:42:19 I'm just gonna leave this chat, I'm not in the mood for any bs atm
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:46:27 I just woke up and I'm already tired of htis chat
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:46:45 Can we just all agree everyone learns differently and that you shouldn't bash someone for using tutorials

plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:49:19 "I wasn't"

You literally just said "tutorial, noob, no imagination"
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:50:13 > now please be quiet
<@!456238251204935690> yes, let's just be quiet or change the topic
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 01:52:08 You're still wanting to argue, don't you?

general 2020-08-09 02:03:58 I'm already facing an economic recession over here

general 2020-08-09 02:05:07 Oh, in that case
general 2020-08-09 02:05:09 Good luck
general 2020-08-09 02:05:47 I tried Python once
general 2020-08-09 02:05:57 I gave up on Python as soon as I found PC
general 2020-08-09 02:06:11 At least the school's gonna teach Java this year
general 2020-08-09 02:06:37 After about *tons* of lessons related to HTML and CSS
general 2020-08-09 02:07:08 <@!456238251204935690> Considering you're gonna teach how to code, then what do you do to stay motivated?
general 2020-08-09 02:07:37 The latter
general 2020-08-09 02:07:55 Like how do you keep getting motivated to keep coding
general 2020-08-09 02:08:08 I'm also Asian
general 2020-08-09 02:08:16 I guess I'm more into building stuff and seeing them work
general 2020-08-09 02:08:43 Filipino
general 2020-08-09 02:08:56 Also I just realized what Black was doing satire
general 2020-08-09 02:09:05 And I got triggered
general 2020-08-09 02:09:55 I can't draw
general 2020-08-09 02:10:10 I just like to b i l d d

general 2020-08-09 02:14:03 Almost a perfect tilt
general 2020-08-09 02:14:21 I dunno ask Wikipedia I'm not gonna search the entire internet to fact check
general 2020-08-09 02:14:53 I can still feel the effects of cough medicine
general 2020-08-09 02:14:57 Because I am beyond braindead
general 2020-08-09 02:15:26 When are we gonna find Uranus in person?
general 2020-08-09 02:15:56 Suit is not ready for URanus, Phyl0t
general 2020-08-09 02:16:05 We all need masks, during this time
general 2020-08-09 02:16:14 Stay at home, wear a mask
general 2020-08-09 02:16:34 <@!430739561690431489> I misread that as musk
general 2020-08-09 02:16:40 Uranus is stinky
general 2020-08-09 02:16:44 Wash it
general 2020-08-09 02:17:09 Cough on Uranus's ecosystem
general 2020-08-09 02:18:03 <emoji spam>
general 2020-08-09 02:19:15 Sounds like the US
general 2020-08-09 02:21:07 Random question, how stupid am I if I get triggered over satire?
general 2020-08-09 02:21:52 Now you're just messing with me xp
general 2020-08-09 02:22:50 Oh remember our little argument
general 2020-08-09 02:23:45 i am the big stupid
general 2020-08-09 02:23:57 But for real though, I'll just stick with what I'm comfortable with
general 2020-08-09 02:24:08 But not too much
general 2020-08-09 02:24:55 Yes but tbh that's just how I start
general 2020-08-09 02:25:11 Up until I know how to do it on my own
general 2020-08-09 02:25:53 Eh, I dunno, because I really do feel more comfortable with the thought of how crap works
general 2020-08-09 02:26:03 Just like how I first started with planes
general 2020-08-09 02:27:59 My brain is just "how does the basics of this thing works" and eventually it just goes on it's own
general 2020-08-09 02:28:23 My brain is now also affected more by the medicine I took
general 2020-08-09 02:28:33 For I have lost my sense of scale for everything
general 2020-08-09 02:29:32 I've built a lot of planes
general 2020-08-09 02:30:21 Actaully I don't know
general 2020-08-09 02:30:25 Would be interesting to do
general 2020-08-09 02:30:46 *Everything feels small*
general 2020-08-09 02:30:55 *help why does everything feel so small*
general 2020-08-09 02:31:55 <@!456238251204935690> No I took cough medicine that makes me feel sleepy
general 2020-08-09 02:32:10 Life for me is distract myself from depression
general 2020-08-09 02:33:14 cough cough
general 2020-08-09 02:33:17 i cough on the chat
general 2020-08-09 02:33:29 ***s p i t***
general 2020-08-09 02:33:56 Speaking of cars, how about Formula 1?
general 2020-08-09 02:34:35 The thing I keep hearing about Formula 1 is "FIA kills this innovation" or etc.
general 2020-08-09 02:34:49 Speaking of innovations
general 2020-08-09 02:34:56 Lotus ground effect and Brabham BT1 fan car
general 2020-08-09 02:35:04 Yes, rallies are nice
general 2020-08-09 02:35:06 Off-roading fun
general 2020-08-09 02:35:33 If rallying has it's own version of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, it would be the Dakar Rally
general 2020-08-09 02:35:47 Except it's longer than 24 hours
general 2020-08-09 02:36:16 Also, everything that I watched in that vid is literally everything that I've learned
general 2020-08-09 02:36:21 About tanks
general 2020-08-09 02:36:25 So I learned nothing new
general 2020-08-09 02:36:48 I have friends
general 2020-08-09 02:36:54 Real life friends though
general 2020-08-09 02:36:55 haha no
general 2020-08-09 02:37:33 I only have like 3 real life friends
general 2020-08-09 02:37:38 Only one of which I'm close with
general 2020-08-09 02:38:36 anyways I'll go build wide boi tank
general 2020-08-09 02:38:44 So I can fit a cabin and suspension
general 2020-08-09 02:39:19 9 days until you have successfully lived another year of the game that is life
general 2020-08-09 02:40:38 I have something to show Black

general 2020-08-09 02:41:56 Still pretty good vid though
general 2020-08-09 02:42:12 Unless Disney actually made that, and not edit
general 2020-08-09 02:43:20 
general 2020-08-09 02:43:29 I misread that as Suzuki
general 2020-08-09 02:43:50 My brain played a game of fill in the gap
general 2020-08-09 02:44:17 Anyways I'll go look up at tank images now
general 2020-08-09 02:59:45 @​Rickje139
general 2020-08-09 03:00:25 <@!177743269105500160> Those colors look like it came out of a Mega Blocks set

general 2020-08-09 03:01:33 You can't copy my creations

I like using technical stuff such as locked motors and conveyor drives
general 2020-08-09 03:01:45 I use locked motors and conveyor drives too much
general 2020-08-09 03:02:01 Yes
general 2020-08-09 03:02:13 Can't finish my planes without them
general 2020-08-09 03:02:26 Because ***s p e e d***
general 2020-08-09 03:03:17 German Mustang https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opel_Kadett
general 2020-08-09 03:03:42 Specifically the Opel Kadett C
general 2020-08-09 03:03:52 Because it's the only one with a sloped rear
general 2020-08-09 03:04:40 Wait I was thinking of the Ford Mustang Fastback
general 2020-08-09 03:05:18 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastback
general 2020-08-09 04:07:22 Seeing this in my recommendations, I just realized I never made propeller planes in PC https://youtu.be/IwqTN5fhMR8
general 2020-08-09 04:08:01 Should I build this plane as my first turboprop plane?
general 2020-08-09 04:08:10 Sometimes I read suggestions
general 2020-08-09 04:09:09 I guess I'll go build the P-47 Thunderbolt as my first turboprop, something different from the Spitfire
general 2020-08-09 04:09:35 Did you ran out of wedges?
general 2020-08-09 04:14:43 On a scale of 1-10 how hard is it to build a working custom plane propeller
general 2020-08-09 04:15:26 A custom plane propelled that actually provides thrust
general 2020-08-09 04:16:24 I'm on mobile with no Roblox
general 2020-08-09 04:16:40 Because potato processor can't handle it
general 2020-08-09 04:17:10 32 bit Snapdragon 801, Samsung Galaxy S5 2 GB of RAM
general 2020-08-09 04:17:20 Okay gn
general 2020-08-09 04:17:48 Also the 16 GB of storage ain't gonna work for me
general 2020-08-09 04:18:07 At 32 GB is where I have some breathing room
general 2020-08-09 04:19:44 Considering what Savoic said about custom working propellers, I guess I'll go build trimotor setup, basically three turboprops
general 2020-08-09 04:20:48 Give me some examples of somewhat small turboprop planes with three engines
general 2020-08-09 04:21:30 <@177743269105500160> At least you have 64 GB
general 2020-08-09 04:21:37 I have 16

general 2020-08-09 04:26:34 And I've experienced worse
general 2020-08-09 04:48:16 Look at the user list at the right
general 2020-08-09 04:48:28 Or if on mobile, swipe left
general 2020-08-09 06:43:53 Random thought, what if I were to put a swashplate on a propeller plane
general 2020-08-09 07:04:03 I might do it tbh
general 2020-08-09 07:04:23 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_P-47_Thunderbolt On this thicc boi
general 2020-08-09 07:05:20 Because swashplates are too complex for my smol brain
general 2020-08-09 07:05:28 I'm gonna actually learn something from a tutorial
general 2020-08-09 07:07:21 The video I'm watching has an earrape intro
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:24:21 I have an idea too, using a swashplate for the propeller of a plane
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:25:41 Because of his two master ranks
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:25:52 Robotics and shipwright
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:26:31 I mean those are the colors of the master ranks as I clicked on his profile
general 2020-08-09 07:29:42 <@!645128367611445248> If Marvel's Thanos and DC's The Riddler had a baby
general 2020-08-09 07:30:24 Well I never had that character model
general 2020-08-09 07:30:29 So I don't know how
general 2020-08-09 07:32:27 Swashplates are larger than I thought
general 2020-08-09 07:32:48 So I'm just gonna go for a smaller thing then
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:34:17 <@!645128367611445248> Sounds like a carrier but in the sky
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:34:23 Carrier blimp?
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:35:01 Making it a blimp though makes it look nicer
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:35:30 But square with helium is best function-wise
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:44:24 <@!287779983445721088> can relate
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:45:05 that's a nice plane
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:45:52 If only I could build that good
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:46:21 Frogfoot?
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:47:25 There is an Italian plane company called CANT
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:47:36 I **can't** believe that exists
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:47:45 <@!287779983445721088> Also Sukhoi was once Japanese?
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:48:14 Oh wait I misread that
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:48:36 ***M m m, A s s i***
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:49:14 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dornier_Do_24 Should I build this as my first turboprop plane?
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:50:04 How about this one? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker_F.XX
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:50:51 I dunno wanted to try build a trimotor plane
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:50:56 As my first turboprop
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:51:26 I'm laughing at the fact there's a company named Siemens
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:52:25 I read Siemens as something I shouldn't mention
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:52:44 Anyways, I'll go build a Dornier Do 24 or a Junkers Ju 352
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 07:53:13 Wait why am I even thinking of building a specific plane when I could try a custom one first xp
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 08:25:33 Imagine bomber but it drops horns
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 08:27:38 Note: Avoid Thailand, because I heard even tourists can get in trouble
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 08:28:15 Let me go confirm that
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 08:28:28 yes, but let me search it up to see if what I've heard is true or not
general 2020-08-09 08:30:10 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A8se_majest%C3%A9_in_Thailand
general 2020-08-09 08:30:18 Well, if anyone wants to read about it
general 2020-08-09 08:30:40 I'll go find about the ones where it isn't coming from their own citizens
general 2020-08-09 08:31:12 Dang even Thailand has internet censorship
general 2020-08-09 08:31:39 Ah here we go, notable cases
general 2020-08-09 08:32:11 Lech Tomasz Kisielewicz, French National of Polish descent, 1995
general 2020-08-09 08:32:21 "Made an insulting remark about a Thai princess aboard a Thai Airways flight. He was jailed under lèse majesté for two weeks after his flight landed in Bangkok"
general 2020-08-09 08:32:44 This suggests that even non-citizens can get arrested for insulting Thai royalty
general 2020-08-09 08:33:08 "Even "attempting" to commit lèse majesté, making sarcastic comment about the King's pet, and failure to rebuke an offense have been prosecuted for lèse majesté. "
general 2020-08-09 08:34:44 Well, I'll let y'all do whatever you want because I don't wanna get too political
general 2020-08-09 08:35:19 Also, there's a movie where Superman's a Soviet
general 2020-08-09 08:37:00 <@456226577798135808> I almost forgot, scroll up for the answer to your question
general 2020-08-09 08:37:11 Foreigner actually got arrested
general 2020-08-09 08:51:02 I wonder what other Roblox games I should go play
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 09:27:04 > That's what I picture when I think about America
Add guns and oil on top of that
general 2020-08-09 09:27:36 Tonk
general 2020-08-09 09:27:50 I have seen I can get away with wide body
general 2020-08-09 09:27:58 Because of that pic
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 09:29:12 You're looking through your own blood
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 09:39:13 <@645128367611445248> oh i do that
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 09:41:00 The car you saw, wheels on 50
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 09:41:10 Mine's powered
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 09:42:09 <@645128367611445248> On the ground, they don't shake but when nothing's pressing them onto the ground, prepare for the wheels to spasm
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 09:42:49 Prepare to fly
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 09:42:59 If you're gonna use conveyor drives for a car
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 09:43:09 Mine becomes a plane
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 09:43:23 I deleted the poor thing
creations-chat 2020-08-09 09:43:50 Finally someone said it

general 2020-08-20 03:13:08 People still do
general 2020-08-20 03:13:17 I mean there literally was just a new release recently
general 2020-08-20 03:13:20 To end the series
general 2020-08-20 03:13:31 Like I actually mean it fvlvia
general 2020-08-20 03:13:43 There was a new and final release in the series just recently
general 2020-08-20 03:14:02 https://store.steampowered.com/app/1089980/The_Henry_Stickmin_Collection/
general 2020-08-20 03:14:28 Honestly I'd play it for the sake of nostalgia
general 2020-08-20 03:15:07 Torrent bad, you don't support the devs
general 2020-08-20 03:15:28 The Pirate Bay
general 2020-08-20 03:16:12 Honestly I'd play The Henry Stickmin series, for the nostalgia
general 2020-08-20 03:17:43 <@456226577798135808> The Henry Stickmin collection was released on Steam, there's a new game in the series, some new added content and redone stuff (the most obvious being the animations and stuff)
general 2020-08-20 03:18:23 I guess to finally put the series to an end
general 2020-08-20 03:18:39 Like a proper end I guess
general 2020-08-20 03:19:10 Steam says the reviews are Overwhelmingly Positive
general 2020-08-20 03:20:31 Take Minecraft's building then slap it onto vehicles
general 2020-08-20 03:20:45 <@!527653676022628353> Grinding?
general 2020-08-20 03:21:21 I'm assuming the most popular genre on Roblox involves a lot of grinding or a lot of waiting (like tycoons or those clicking games)
general 2020-08-20 03:21:52 I'll go take a look into Skidrow, I trust epicman
general 2020-08-20 03:23:53 I'll go find some free games now on Steam, got DDracenetwork and I'll try to find more
general 2020-08-21 11:59:11 ***L e n i n***
general 2020-08-21 11:59:51 This is a good channel
general 2020-08-21 12:00:13 Had a recent video about the Russian Revolution
general 2020-08-22 00:04:15 All hail the wise tooti
general 2020-08-22 00:06:31 You haven't been on the Internet for long
general 2020-08-22 00:06:48 Honestly chaos is normal, ask 4-chan
general 2020-08-22 00:08:00 Cutie? That's actually *bad*
general 2020-08-22 00:08:14 I don't mean the word cutie
general 2020-08-22 00:08:35 I mean Cutie on Netflix
general 2020-08-22 00:09:31 If anyone is unaware of it, I'll just bring up three terms 

11 year old girl, twerking dance group and TV-MA
general 2020-08-22 00:10:25 I'll let people figure why it's bad with those three words
general 2020-08-22 00:11:36 <@456226577798135808> My attempt at trying to explain a controversial show without trying to get warned for it
general 2020-08-22 00:11:54 I just woke up xp
general 2020-08-22 00:13:23 The whole show itself is controversial, a TV-MA show about an 11-year old girl joining a "twerking dance group"

Yeah I doubt that's what it is Netflix
general 2020-08-22 00:14:13 I think it's audience are certain Tumblr users and your creepy uncle type of people
general 2020-08-22 00:14:21 Anyways I'll stop
general 2020-08-22 00:15:05 Is it about Rasputin?
general 2020-08-22 00:15:23 Communism good Fascism bad
general 2020-08-22 00:16:01 Yes, both are bad in reality
general 2020-08-22 00:16:17 But one gets memed the heck out of it
general 2020-08-22 00:16:34 And their anthem became the meme anthen
general 2020-08-22 00:16:47 *Our* anthem
general 2020-08-22 00:17:45 Communist Mario = good
general 2020-08-22 00:18:23 How about Puri X a literal bottle of water
general 2020-08-22 00:19:21 Rickje already shipped with someone, mad
general 2020-08-22 00:20:30 Madcrosoft
general 2020-08-22 00:20:50 Sony... I remember when their phones were decent
general 2020-08-22 00:21:17 They're just a shadow of their former self tbh
general 2020-08-22 00:21:26 Samsung already won with electronics
general 2020-08-22 00:21:53 Plus other companies involved in electronics such as Panasonic
general 2020-08-22 00:22:36 And their phones just suck nowadays, honestly cameras are the only decent thing I know from them and other media related stuff
general 2020-08-22 00:23:16 Boop clan
general 2020-08-22 00:23:44 Beebux clan
general 2020-08-22 00:23:57 Stick bug clan
general 2020-08-22 00:24:44 Ew shredders
general 2020-08-22 00:26:43 Is it me or are the lines getting blurred with furries and anime
general 2020-08-22 00:27:03 That's a shredder
general 2020-08-22 00:27:16 We know what a shredder is when we see it
general 2020-08-22 00:28:55 <@615876745710534676> Ngl though I see BNA getting the attention of furries
general 2020-08-22 00:29:30 And there's an anime where the characters literally are furries
general 2020-08-22 00:30:50 Beastars I think, a bit fuzzy for me to remember fully
general 2020-08-22 00:33:31 Well, I'll just go avoid unde spam for now
general 2020-08-22 00:33:44 And avoid that channel for now
general 2020-08-22 00:35:32 I feel like the distraction dance from the Henry Stickmin series is gonna become a meme
general 2020-08-22 00:36:27 Well
general 2020-08-22 00:37:05 At least we know Puffballs hates the Fortnite default dance
general 2020-08-22 00:37:41 Because you'd instantly fail if you try it within the game (FN default dance)
general 2020-08-22 00:42:04 My keyboard is back from the dead
general 2020-08-22 00:42:39 I hate it when my phone prioritizes a useless app every Filipino uses over a pretty good keyboard
general 2020-08-22 00:43:21 Isn't anime weird when you think about it?
general 2020-08-22 00:44:27 Space demi-god people that can become King Kong for example
general 2020-08-22 00:44:46 Yes, I agree
general 2020-08-22 00:44:52 Good weird is good
general 2020-08-22 00:45:11 Honestly life is weird
general 2020-08-22 00:45:56 Somehow from eating sugar we became self aware creatures that are both dumb and intelligent
general 2020-08-22 00:46:33 If I have to be honest I don't really watch anime, I've barely watched it in my life
general 2020-08-22 00:47:01 But those few times in childhood, I was pretty occupied with it
general 2020-08-22 00:49:43 I remembered my first build
general 2020-08-22 00:49:51 It was a thicc fighter jet
general 2020-08-22 00:50:00 It wasn't that good
general 2020-08-22 00:50:23 My first fighter looked like a hunchback
general 2020-08-22 00:50:33 It had 1x4 delta wings
general 2020-08-22 00:50:54 And didn't even use a lot of control surfaces
general 2020-08-22 00:51:07 It also can't roll beyond 90 degrees
general 2020-08-22 00:51:17 At least it had perfect VTOL
general 2020-08-22 00:53:46 I tried building a dependent suspension last night
general 2020-08-22 00:53:54 Ride quality is stiff as heck
general 2020-08-22 00:54:08 Well compared to other designs
general 2020-08-22 00:54:20 And if I made the springs any softer it would've buckled
general 2020-08-22 00:56:56 Barney no
general 2020-08-22 00:57:39 I have 45 pings and I'm too lazy to check them all
general 2020-08-22 00:58:11 No Rasputin isn't with us
general 2020-08-22 00:58:52 I really don't wanna see that knowing what weird shit I've already seen posted there
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:02:13 Literally a bot
general 2020-08-22 01:02:57 Somebody once told me

general 2020-08-22 01:03:38 ~~wait wat xp~~

general 2020-08-22 03:05:57 **Make 'em emojis**
general 2020-08-22 03:07:43 Naz nowadays is just another term for alt-right, and not wanting to get political I'll let you research that term by yourself
general 2020-08-22 03:08:25 Yes let's do that
general 2020-08-22 03:08:34 Let's stop
general 2020-08-22 03:09:44 Could you stop being an idiot and acknowledge that millions of Jews died under *that* Germany
general 2020-08-22 03:09:53 It's insensitive to make a meme about it
general 2020-08-22 03:10:35 "Say something cool"

Not cool bro, still insensitive
general 2020-08-22 03:10:44 That's like saying "lol who cares" if someone's mother died
general 2020-08-22 03:10:58 But on a much worse scale, since again millions were affected
general 2020-08-22 03:12:11 There are some topics that shouldn't be touched by dark comedy
general 2020-08-22 03:12:42 You gotta know the line between being tasteful in comedy and just being distastefully insensitive
general 2020-08-22 03:13:35 <@!569298230983131137> Something "joking" about the largest crime against humanity in WW2
general 2020-08-22 03:14:36 Let's just agree that we shouldn't joke about actual deaths, religion and politics because that's just asking for trouble
general 2020-08-22 03:15:22 Get some mods in varying regions
general 2020-08-22 03:15:27 Europe, Asia, etc.

general 2020-08-22 03:18:00 Open mod apps for Europeans and Asians, because like Nevada said 50% are EST
general 2020-08-22 03:18:23 Fonkl got mad at space bat
general 2020-08-22 03:18:47 What was the space lion again?
general 2020-08-22 03:19:20 Solgaleo is the space lion
general 2020-08-22 03:20:36 Or maybe Jail is a Stealth  Bomber

general 2020-08-22 08:18:34 Here's a question 

Thin crust or stuffed crust?
general 2020-08-22 11:05:30 So a McLaren P1 is good for running people over?
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 11:05:47 1.) Nice Among Us profile picture
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 11:06:03 2.) I made a sorta semi-independent suspension system
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 11:06:28 It's sorta a hybrid between a beam axle type dependent suspension and a coil spring based one
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 11:07:03 Which I designed specifically for my missile truck/tractor, to carry a heavy motor locked missile
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 11:09:09 
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 11:09:10 
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 11:11:50 Under non-extreme loads, it sorta acts like a beam axle type of suspension, which I chose so that I don't have to get that concerned over the weight affecting suspension
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 11:12:06 But accidentally, it kinda changes camber all by itself
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 11:12:26 So it's the reason why I consider it to be semi-independent
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 11:13:54 At the front, I just use the basic rope and suspension system
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 11:14:06 why do I have a feeling I'll get stick bugged
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 11:15:00 xp

plane-crazy 2020-08-24 00:52:20 It's a nice Viper
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 00:57:59 Can someone send me towards a pic or a vid of a good looking custom engine for a fighter?
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 00:58:09 ~~because mine's just basic~~

plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:01:04 Just not in the way I expected it
general 2020-08-24 01:01:29 11 upvotes and 1 dislike
general 2020-08-24 01:01:35 11 - 1 = 10
general 2020-08-24 01:09:30 that is nice house
general 2020-08-24 01:09:38 I see you're holding redstone
general 2020-08-24 01:09:43 Now you got my interests
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:12:21 Life is strange isn't it puri?

plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:18:23 < noob parks his missile launching square in my plot
< tries to ram the trash off my plot
< noob goes "hey"
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:18:33 It's just a really basic looking truck tbh
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:19:39 
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:20:28 The nuke flies
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:20:49 But it isn't guided
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:21:15 I need to make it controllable so I can guide it
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:21:23 ~~and destroy bombers in the process~~
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:22:10 
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:22:11 
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:22:13 Look at this
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:23:11 I'd be fine if he wasn't trying to invade my space all the time
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:23:27 *I value my space*
general 2020-08-24 01:23:49 I have an idea
general 2020-08-24 01:23:54 Show undes the game Carrion
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:24:14 Ask him
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:24:26 I like my green dark
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:24:31 As in army green
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:26:40 I found a decently good car, looked like a Viper (never fully inspected it)
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:26:43 Too bad they left
creations-chat 2020-08-24 01:28:23 I left War Robots too

help 2020-08-24 01:30:36 Dunno if it's good or bad
help 2020-08-24 01:30:46 But it looks better than my previous planes at least so far
help 2020-08-24 01:31:07 So far this is just a basic thing I'll use to plan out the actual plane's appearance
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 01:33:21 <#478584971670454284> what my lazy distracted arse has produced so far
general 2020-08-24 01:34:59 I saw a hacker
general 2020-08-24 01:35:01 Once
general 2020-08-24 01:35:09 He showed off
general 2020-08-24 01:35:13 Did square head
general 2020-08-24 01:36:03 Fall Guys bringing Half-Life and Team Fortress costumes into the game
general 2020-08-24 01:36:42 Before I shall migrate to mobile
general 2020-08-24 01:36:52 I shall claim my copy of TF2
general 2020-08-24 01:38:12 oh wait i got tf2 already
general 2020-08-24 01:38:25 ~~I wonder if someone has misinterpreted that as The Fuck~~
general 2020-08-24 01:39:04 I hear my brother watching "I dream of you and ice cream"
general 2020-08-24 01:39:56 More in-game mods would reduce the amount of N-word imagery
general 2020-08-24 01:40:05 You know, the N regime
general 2020-08-24 01:40:22 There's literally no reason to use exploits in PC
general 2020-08-24 01:40:37 And it's not like it's gonna let you get gamepasses for free
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 02:20:26 k

plane-crazy 2020-08-24 02:41:51 Not making a flying wing design nor will I ever make one
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 02:41:59 I'm not interested in making a bomber
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 02:42:10 I'm trying to make a fighter or something similar
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 02:47:55 ***IT'S ALIVE***
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 02:52:53 best car
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 02:52:56 m2 car best car
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 02:53:11 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_AMCA boxy intakes
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 02:53:18 Just look at these intakes
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 02:53:21 It's very boxy
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 02:54:06 Aircraft looks fine though tbh
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 02:54:34 Still, doesn't hide the fact it has boxy intakes
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 02:56:41 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_EA-18G_Growler I'd never thought to hear the name Boeing on a fighter
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 02:59:27 What did you expect? This is Roblox
general 2020-08-24 03:00:02 There is a plane called the CAC FC-1
general 2020-08-24 03:00:30 That's a *nice* name
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 03:06:56 What if speakers were only limited to a few seconds of audio
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 03:07:18 ~~So we don't have to be forced to listen to torture~~
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 03:08:34 Oh I'm aware of that
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 03:09:04 That I can set music to client only
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 03:09:39 Read the chat
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 03:17:38 Hmm, if I motor lock then I can use cylinders
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 03:17:44 And use the regular rocket engines
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 03:17:52 Which means I don't have to bother with making a custom engine
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 03:19:21 Sirenhead
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 03:19:26 please fall off the void
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 03:19:27 thank you

plane-crazy 2020-08-24 03:29:25 Like I actually wanna know
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 03:29:52 Or is it fine?
general 2020-08-24 03:45:15 sure why not im bored
general 2020-08-24 03:45:38 I got there before you
general 2020-08-24 04:18:19 What's the difference between mechanical and membrane keyboards in terms of how it feels to use them
general 2020-08-24 04:21:05 <@!163143541160148992> So membrane keyboards feel more mushy when typing while mechanical has better typing experience
general 2020-08-24 04:21:33 In that case, I think I might be using a membrane keyboard
general 2020-08-24 10:23:57 Wait a second
general 2020-08-24 10:24:08 Did I hear unde owning a NSFW server?
general 2020-08-24 10:24:16 Oh hi DLB
general 2020-08-24 10:24:39 ~~dang now I kinda wanna have a sandwich or burger now~~
general 2020-08-24 10:25:14 So Gamer Thailand?
general 2020-08-24 10:25:43 Well, that's one more thing to know about him
general 2020-08-24 10:25:59 Underaged copycat that's viewing content not meant for his eyes
general 2020-08-24 10:27:29 What's that one Scandinavian sniper's name again
general 2020-08-24 10:27:38 That guy had a world record on him
general 2020-08-24 10:27:59 Yes
general 2020-08-24 10:28:17 <@467765396108476426> Hayha
general 2020-08-24 10:28:26 You beat me to it
general 2020-08-24 10:29:00 Well, I got the Scandinavian part right
general 2020-08-24 10:29:36 I don't even know who leafy is, I'm just gonna assume he's one bitter leaf
general 2020-08-24 10:29:59 Like herbal medicine but it's poison ivy
general 2020-08-24 10:30:39 I will now snacc
general 2020-08-24 10:30:54 And continue playing Plane Crazy on my alt
general 2020-08-24 10:31:25 he
general 2020-08-24 10:32:40 <@649268176185720832> *Hot Wheels flashback*
general 2020-08-24 10:33:56 How many times has Rick gotten himself into a pickle?
general 2020-08-24 10:34:57 When will Rick actually get stuck inside a pickle?
general 2020-08-24 10:35:07 So he can be true Pickle Rick
general 2020-08-24 10:37:02 <@467765396108476426> How about a gun named after you
general 2020-08-24 10:38:34 Speaking of snipers, wasn't there a bolt action chassis based French precision rifle that used the same ammo as a lot of Barretts use?
general 2020-08-24 10:38:56 Yes Hecate
general 2020-08-24 10:40:54 Imagine having the unfortunate company name of ***H e c k l e r   &   K o c h***
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:28:52 Maybe I should take a look into the B-1 Lancer for design ideas
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:29:25 Rn the rear is what's hindering me atm
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:30:09 I'm still at the prototype stages of this plane, where it's still missing the motor locks I'm supposed to use
general 2020-08-24 12:31:17 <@!615876745710534676> The creator of Python is Dutch, so far from it
general 2020-08-24 12:31:46 Made in the Netherlands, the country where you can literally call it's people waterbenders (because of their history with dams)
general 2020-08-24 12:32:08 The point of Python is to be easy, isn't it?
general 2020-08-24 12:32:48 Just like how the point of Java is it's philosophy of "Write Once, Run Anywhere"
general 2020-08-24 12:33:39 <@!414043552595574796> What about one of the versions of C?
general 2020-08-24 12:33:47 C++, C#, the original one, etc.
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:34:13 Literally just rocket spam
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:34:55 Make it look like the Bloodhound LSR and I'll reconsider
general 2020-08-24 12:35:05 I know
general 2020-08-24 12:35:09 That's why I suggested it
general 2020-08-24 12:35:39 I forgot something
general 2020-08-24 12:36:02 Is it bad I've always read the full name of H&K as "Heckler and Co*ck*"
general 2020-08-24 12:36:11 A hard ck in pronounciation
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:36:44 Still rocket spam
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:37:36 My brain is too tired to explain but still knows how it works

plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:39:26 wait I forgot I can build
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:39:34 So I can show you smol
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:40:32 Waiting for Roblox to load
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:41:38 I think I'll go setup Thunderbird while I wait
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:42:17 ~~fun fact: dust is just dead skin~~
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:42:19 ~~we shed~~

plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:43:30 No you're just allergic to everyone else
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:43:44 That means I'm allergic to my classmates
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:43:53 Now I have a legit reason to call my classmates the bane of my existence
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:44:10 Roblox isn't loading ._.
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:44:14 yes I am the blue blur

plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:44:25 oh wait I see the world loading
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:44:49 <@!448505589983739914> Wait does that mean we're cannibals
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:44:51 Or worse
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:45:07 It starts with a V and ends with E
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:45:12 And I'm afraid I'll get warned again xp
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:45:36 wait no that term is only referring to things swallowed alive
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:46:06 We are micro sized cannibals
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:47:13 The V word refers to swallowing things alive
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:47:19 But cannibalism doesn't need to be alive
plane-crazy 2020-08-24 12:47:31 *As long as it's eating your own kind, even yourself*

general 2020-08-24 23:31:20 At least planes are naturally curvy
general 2020-08-24 23:31:51 Anthropomorphic cars is just a big no coming from me
general 2020-08-24 23:32:33 The Latias one though is gud
general 2020-08-24 23:32:38 Nothing cursed about it
general 2020-08-24 23:32:56 Pokemon usually aren't cursed
general 2020-08-24 23:33:34 Honestly I've seen worse
general 2020-08-24 23:34:39 I almost wanna call this The Hunchback of Notre Plane Crazy
general 2020-08-24 23:34:47 Oh I've played them a bit on an emulator
general 2020-08-24 23:35:31 <@!283153622496182274> add ears
general 2020-08-24 23:35:40 I know it's weird
general 2020-08-24 23:36:05 I'm just questioning why I'm even doing it
general 2020-08-24 23:36:16 Not really NSFW
general 2020-08-24 23:36:30 When it shows a pair of you know what then it's NSFW
general 2020-08-24 23:36:58 Wait
general 2020-08-24 23:37:01 Why are we even defending this
general 2020-08-24 23:37:30 Yes, we're defending an aeromorph
general 2020-08-24 23:37:39 And I dunno why
general 2020-08-24 23:37:49 no
general 2020-08-24 23:38:01 Bleach your eyeballs instead
general 2020-08-24 23:38:28 Honestly, I've seen so many weird stuff I don't even find these weird
general 2020-08-24 23:39:04 From the YouTube side from the likes of cyriak, Salad Fingers and DHMIS to even unintended encounters with the weird side of NSFW
general 2020-08-24 23:41:23 "Black person" Why am I getting racist vibes from how that was used
general 2020-08-24 23:41:32 <@!551573378662662145> Just send us Pokemon being cute
general 2020-08-24 23:41:38 Not ***c u r s e d*** images
general 2020-08-24 23:41:43 oh shit
general 2020-08-24 23:42:02 ***w h y***
general 2020-08-24 23:42:15 Why did you have to time that just right
general 2020-08-24 23:42:43 Hmm
general 2020-08-24 23:43:04 Would an Antonov An-225 aeromorph be gigantic?
general 2020-08-24 23:43:30 Let's just pretend this is lizard man
general 2020-08-24 23:43:35 Lizard man at least is meme
general 2020-08-24 23:43:43 Let's pretend he is playing dress-up
general 2020-08-24 23:44:06 Thought so
general 2020-08-24 23:44:32 <@!627645793343635457> You sound like a kid who just discovered the meaning of racist
general 2020-08-24 23:45:55 <@!695352880735191040> That one isn't actually so cursed
general 2020-08-24 23:46:16 The one with cat ears looks like a company mascot ngl
general 2020-08-24 23:46:39 Specifically this one https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/747602544041394238
general 2020-08-24 23:47:03 I don't watch Anna Mae though
general 2020-08-24 23:47:09 I watch Western content
general 2020-08-24 23:47:28 Like ***s p o n g e***
general 2020-08-24 23:48:24 <@!163143541160148992> That reminds me a lot of why Hello Kitty was created
general 2020-08-24 23:48:55 <@!573197570566782977> That's why you call us degenerates xp
general 2020-08-24 23:49:08 But seriously though unless they're being NSFW, just let them be
general 2020-08-24 23:49:45 We as a fandom seriously need fixing
general 2020-08-24 23:50:01 On Twitter, I see a lot of furry drama
general 2020-08-24 23:50:29 America is weird
general 2020-08-24 23:50:37 Like how do some people go against common sense
general 2020-08-24 23:50:53 I'm referring to anti-maskers and ***K a r e n s***
general 2020-08-24 23:51:06 Yes, Christmas bulb dino

general 2020-08-24 23:52:00 The more I look at my Hunchback Fighter, the more I get reminded of the F-35 Lightning II's chonky shape
general 2020-08-24 23:53:06 Venezuela, the poorest country (like seriously it's even worse than North Korea)
general 2020-08-24 23:53:23 <@!551573378662662145> There are anime furries
general 2020-08-24 23:54:18 <@!335599526414909451> I suggest you don't scroll up if you don't wanna get bombarded by aeromorphs (well apart from doing your job)
general 2020-08-24 23:55:04 Oh
general 2020-08-24 23:55:06 I was about to ask
general 2020-08-24 23:55:08 What it was
general 2020-08-24 23:55:30 Is it the one where it looked "pleasured"
general 2020-08-24 23:56:04 Aight I'mma just go back to PC
general 2020-08-24 23:56:09 This chat has became too wild for me
general 2020-08-24 23:56:44 *Aeromorph in PC*
general 2020-08-24 23:57:00 We already have the furry tank
general 2020-08-24 23:57:14 We need it to complete the summoning ritual of the cursed trio xp
general 2020-08-24 23:57:38 Let's see what you people find cursed here
general 2020-08-24 23:57:42 Aeromorphs
general 2020-08-24 23:57:44 Furries
general 2020-08-24 23:57:46 What else?
general 2020-08-24 23:58:16 Someone build anime and aeromorph in Plane Crazy
general 2020-08-24 23:58:23 So I can summon the demon of the cursed content
general 2020-08-24 23:59:31 I'm just gonna take a break from PC for now
general 2020-08-24 23:59:37 I'll be playing DDRace Network now
general 2020-08-24 23:59:55 Yes, that is technically anime
general 2020-08-25 00:00:15 You can't deny it, because it has the animation style
general 2020-08-25 00:00:31 <@!695352880735191040> Wait, an aeromorph leading regular planes
general 2020-08-25 00:00:39 It's commanding his own kind
general 2020-08-25 00:01:15 <@!551573378662662145> Where do you find these Pokemon content
general 2020-08-25 00:01:20 I want more wholesome stuff
general 2020-08-25 00:01:31 Not the uncontrolled chaos that is this chat
general 2020-08-25 00:02:02 XD
general 2020-08-25 00:02:08 You fucking little shit xp
general 2020-08-25 00:02:20 That was unsatisfying
general 2020-08-25 00:02:37 The chat has achieved calm, hopefully
general 2020-08-25 00:03:32 mini birb
general 2020-08-25 00:03:34 birb is nice
general 2020-08-25 00:03:42 Now I will frustrate myself in playing this game https://store.steampowered.com/app/412220/DDraceNetwork/
general 2020-08-25 00:04:21 Japan
general 2020-08-25 00:04:41 Japan has vending machines for all sorts of stuff
general 2020-08-25 00:04:58 But you know what sounds like the best idea for a vending machine? A pizza vending machine
general 2020-08-25 00:05:36 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vending_Pizza_Machine
general 2020-08-25 00:05:45 yes it exists
general 2020-08-25 00:05:51 I actually want that
general 2020-08-25 00:06:14 Like ngl, I like the idea of having quick access to pizza
general 2020-08-25 00:06:55 "The machine combines water, flour, tomato sauce, and fresh ingredients to make a pizza in approximately three minutes. It includes windows so customers can watch the pizza as it is made.[1] The pizza is cooked in an infrared oven. [2] The machine is made to create 100 pizzas before it needs to be refilled with its ingredients. "
general 2020-08-25 00:07:11 Let's hope that pizza tastes good enough
general 2020-08-25 00:07:29 <@!695352880735191040> ***wait a fucking minute***
general 2020-08-25 00:07:43 That looks *familiar*
general 2020-08-25 00:07:51 That SR-71 Blackbird
general 2020-08-25 00:07:56 I've seen that in NSFW content before
general 2020-08-25 00:08:31 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_fry_vending_machine
general 2020-08-25 00:08:32 yes
general 2020-08-25 00:08:37 more snacc vending machines
general 2020-08-25 00:08:55 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_machine
general 2020-08-25 00:09:13 I'm honestly becoming hungry now
general 2020-08-25 00:09:33 <@!695352880735191040> I mean people like to get their food fast, don't they?
general 2020-08-25 00:11:15 ***i should stop getting distracted by this chat and play my damn game***
general 2020-08-25 00:12:06 No mine's better
general 2020-08-25 00:12:24 
general 2020-08-25 00:12:25 
general 2020-08-25 00:12:32 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills_Caviar_Automated_Boutique and one last vending machine, but this one's for those rich fancy foods
general 2020-08-25 00:13:50 I think I'll go play Minecraft now
general 2020-08-25 00:14:04 I wanna relive childhood and relearn redstone
general 2020-08-25 00:15:07 I dunno either, but Forza isn't really realistic
general 2020-08-25 00:15:14 But I still love it
general 2020-08-25 00:16:38 <@!695352880735191040> Are those jets anthropomorphic? xp
general 2020-08-25 00:16:54 ~~You've posted a lot of aeromorphs today~~
general 2020-08-25 00:17:46 I recognize that art style
general 2020-08-25 00:18:00 Careful not to post NSFW
general 2020-08-25 00:18:18 Let's change the topic
general 2020-08-25 00:18:27 This man built the Coffin Dance meme https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrn9iA219LE
general 2020-08-25 00:18:42 But as a base
general 2020-08-25 00:20:09 I forgot why I like these kinds of Minecraft YouTubers
general 2020-08-25 00:20:43 I wonder what new stuff Seth has made
general 2020-08-25 00:21:05 Yes
general 2020-08-25 00:21:13 And they do cool stuff
general 2020-08-25 00:21:44 Sethbling's doing Mario speedruns again
general 2020-08-25 00:22:46 https://www.youtube.com/c/MinecraftSethBling/videos Well, these speedruns are short, so he be really speedy
general 2020-08-25 00:23:26 wait a second there's a mario card game
general 2020-08-25 00:23:30 Called Mario: The Gathering
general 2020-08-25 00:24:06 SethBling actually has videos of it
general 2020-08-25 00:24:43 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VST7hpAr2_A ***S t i c c Bu g***
general 2020-08-25 00:26:19 Minecraft Mob Tetris
general 2020-08-25 00:26:24 Where every mob is a tetromino
general 2020-08-25 00:26:43 And Steve are the numbers
general 2020-08-25 00:29:49 ???

general 2020-08-25 00:30:45 No he's going to France
general 2020-08-25 00:31:15 No France
general 2020-08-25 00:31:23 Where the gullotine resides
general 2020-08-25 00:32:29 Would a thin French person be called a "French fry"
general 2020-08-25 00:32:36 Yes, in DMs
general 2020-08-25 00:32:43 I know because I've been banned before
general 2020-08-25 00:34:13 Yes
general 2020-08-25 00:34:20 wait let me check again
general 2020-08-25 00:34:35 Yes
general 2020-08-25 00:34:47 3 days for being the horn
general 2020-08-25 00:47:50 Pufferfish make for good sensors
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 02:45:19 I wonder what benefits does this even provide
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 02:45:44 It's a dependent suspension, that can adjust camber on it's own
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 02:55:18 
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 02:55:21 
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 02:55:23 I'm having doubts if a motor lock could even save this
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 02:56:18 Might as well go with it and improve on later designs
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 02:56:49 Gonna continue building the prototype before carrying onto motor locking it
general 2020-08-25 02:57:06 blood moon
general 2020-08-25 02:57:49 The moon used to adventure around the solar system, but then it got shot in the knee and bled
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 02:58:10 I know it looks ugly
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 02:58:53 I honestly have no idea why I'm even doing this
general 2020-08-25 02:59:43 <#384021699466756107> I made ugly plane butt
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:00:41 This just looks weird, even without the stabilators and rudders
general 2020-08-25 03:01:16 "Too memey"
general 2020-08-25 03:01:26 *Waluigi looks down in disappointment*
general 2020-08-25 03:02:54 Because meme
general 2020-08-25 03:03:05 High effort memes usually get upvotes
general 2020-08-25 03:03:21 Make a hippo out of motor locks
general 2020-08-25 03:03:27 So I can make the pun "Motor-Motor"
general 2020-08-25 03:04:04 Moto-moto for the motor-motor pun
general 2020-08-25 03:04:23 I have regular desktop

general 2020-08-25 03:06:52 https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/EVE Make this lass too
general 2020-08-25 03:07:12 Yes, give us that Disney magic
general 2020-08-25 03:09:15 
general 2020-08-25 03:09:15 
general 2020-08-25 03:09:18 This is what hardware I have
general 2020-08-25 03:09:22 Not the best
general 2020-08-25 03:09:26 Oh yeah the new movie
general 2020-08-25 03:09:36 <@!533422608964911104> dxdiag
general 2020-08-25 03:09:58 I thought it was only on Disney+
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:10:42 I should make this thing less c h o n k
general 2020-08-25 03:11:16 56 GB
general 2020-08-25 03:11:31 RAM 100
general 2020-08-25 03:11:55 Or if you want verbose numbers
general 2020-08-25 03:11:58 56083000000 bytes
general 2020-08-25 03:12:13 damn you have money
general 2020-08-25 03:12:58 How motorvated are you to build Wall-E?
general 2020-08-25 03:14:31 Would pistons be better track tensioners?
general 2020-08-25 03:14:45 Compared to suspension
general 2020-08-25 03:15:21 so locc?
general 2020-08-25 03:16:41 Time to unchonk a plane
general 2020-08-25 03:18:33 Is it just me or does Scott literally just shape the lore around MatPat's theories
general 2020-08-25 03:18:51 And be a troll by forcing him to redo each theory he has
general 2020-08-25 03:20:28 ~~I wonder how people would react if someone with an aeromorph PFP decided to join this game~~
general 2020-08-25 03:21:26 Doesn't Lego have a product for more robotic stuff, Mindstorms?
general 2020-08-25 03:21:40 Images are still loading for me
general 2020-08-25 03:21:54 Guess it's more for kids
general 2020-08-25 03:23:20 Oof, that sucks
general 2020-08-25 03:24:16 I'll just wait for next month for Ching to post more cursed content
general 2020-08-25 03:24:59 It's fun seeing the chat die over aeromorphs xp
general 2020-08-25 03:25:19 <@!426802747875131393> *I suggest you turn on safe search*
general 2020-08-25 03:26:32 It's just anthropomorphic plane
general 2020-08-25 03:26:33 And yes
general 2020-08-25 03:26:42 It exists in a furry NSFW site
general 2020-08-25 03:27:00 I've seen stuff
general 2020-08-25 03:27:24 Some of which I'd like to forget, some just meh just because of my exposure to weird stuff
general 2020-08-25 03:27:35 No, one I saw had jugs
general 2020-08-25 03:28:07 <@!615876745710534676> Well, you could use the rope and suspension as a form of hydraulics
general 2020-08-25 03:28:55 <@456226577798135808> Jay, slow down

**DO THIS INSTEAD**
general 2020-08-25 03:29:39 It's NSFW if it shows kinky stuff and/or is suggestive
general 2020-08-25 03:29:51 Or if you're doing stuff like standing on an office chair
general 2020-08-25 03:30:02 pls stop
general 2020-08-25 03:30:04 that is cursed
general 2020-08-25 03:30:09 just cursed
general 2020-08-25 03:30:15 that's even worse than aeromorphs
general 2020-08-25 03:30:22 Aeromorphs I can still tolerate
general 2020-08-25 03:30:25 But that
general 2020-08-25 03:30:32 *kill it*
general 2020-08-25 03:30:51 <@!615876745710534676> Fine meshing coudl be used as linear actuators
general 2020-08-25 03:31:15 <@!447221768520859659> Mine is more like a spectrum
general 2020-08-25 03:31:29 That thing belongs beyond the dump
general 2020-08-25 03:33:27 "hey" "hey" "hey" "this server has nobody with mouths"
general 2020-08-25 03:33:34 Another day dealing with a bacon
general 2020-08-25 03:33:49 The kind that wants you to ride their trashy build
general 2020-08-25 03:35:41 <@!163143541160148992> Nah he probably uses the mic feature on phone keyboards
general 2020-08-25 03:36:00 He can't grammar
general 2020-08-25 03:36:34 Chingy, just how much weird stuff do you have lying around?
general 2020-08-25 03:36:49 Literally just those planes
general 2020-08-25 03:37:02 E
general 2020-08-25 03:37:25 At this point I wanna joke about Guroion being attracted to aeromoprhs
general 2020-08-25 03:38:01 We get it, they're curvy
general 2020-08-25 03:38:09 But you don't need to announce it m8
general 2020-08-25 03:39:33 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/747617861014388776 I'm surprised this got upvotes
general 2020-08-25 03:42:31 Still, I'm surprised it got upvotes
general 2020-08-25 04:09:11 Isn't Carrion a reverse horror game?
general 2020-08-25 06:04:34 Rotato potato
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 06:06:45 <@251880826386513924> Looks like you encountered the "UFO"
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 06:07:02 It is undentified, it might fly
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 06:07:12 But it is definitely not an object
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 06:08:07 No wait, the U means unde
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 06:10:37 That UF~~O~~ you saw is an Unde's Flying Oof
general 2020-08-25 06:11:51 Let me utter the cursed word
general 2020-08-25 06:12:04 **DeviantArt.**
general 2020-08-25 06:25:13 I got curious
general 2020-08-25 06:25:24 I made a throwaway account on DA
general 2020-08-25 06:25:30 I searched aeromorph
general 2020-08-25 06:25:39 I saw a giant ekranoplans
general 2020-08-25 06:26:12 As in ***gigantic*** ekranoplans aeromorph
general 2020-08-25 06:26:37 Kinda glad it isn't really NSFW
general 2020-08-25 06:26:51 But this image, it really exaggerates the size
general 2020-08-25 06:27:25 I'll DM it instead
general 2020-08-25 06:48:59 After a laggy session
general 2020-08-25 06:49:11 Finally sent Darrell the thing
general 2020-08-25 06:49:16 That I saw
general 2020-08-25 06:49:46 ~~a beyond mountain sized ekranoplans aeromorph~~
general 2020-08-25 06:50:46 Gacha...

You pay for waifu or that app that's even worse than DeviantArt
general 2020-08-25 06:50:55 Either one works
general 2020-08-25 06:52:04 <@456226577798135808> Which site and what do I need to do?
general 2020-08-25 06:53:42 Part of me is curious now
general 2020-08-25 06:54:09 Either one works, but go for OBS
general 2020-08-25 06:54:34 I just let it automatically setup and click record screen
general 2020-08-25 06:55:13 <@426802747875131393> Did you made sure to add a source first?
general 2020-08-25 06:55:23 It's the plus sign, under the list source
general 2020-08-25 06:55:39 O h
general 2020-08-25 06:55:48 OBS works for me
general 2020-08-25 06:55:56 Anyways, gtg
general 2020-08-25 08:09:51 So I went ahead even further with seeing what surprises I had in DA
general 2020-08-25 08:11:36 I probably should've turned back when I had the chance
general 2020-08-25 08:13:50 Also, is it true that most pre-teens-early teens are the typical users on that site?
general 2020-08-25 08:14:27 ***D e v i a n t A r t***
general 2020-08-25 08:14:38 I got curious
general 2020-08-25 08:14:57 Yes, you are right
general 2020-08-25 08:15:06 There's barely any good stuff
general 2020-08-25 08:16:04 <@467765396108476426> Give me bleach eye droplets
general 2020-08-25 08:16:34 I need to unsee the weirder content on that site
general 2020-08-25 08:16:49 I did already
general 2020-08-25 08:17:40 I'm weird, but that site is just uncontrolled weirdness
general 2020-08-25 08:17:52 And I don't like it
general 2020-08-25 08:18:09 Only do it in tasteful doses, such as Weird Al
general 2020-08-25 08:18:15 He's weird in a good way
general 2020-08-25 08:18:37 Countryballs is fine
general 2020-08-25 08:19:22 I haven't really been into anime, so I can't judge it
general 2020-08-25 08:19:30 Furry, your mileage may vary
general 2020-08-25 08:20:25 Though as with any site that's social in one form or another, ya better start using that filter if you don't wanna see unwanted content
general 2020-08-25 08:21:06 Of course we aren't referring to DA
general 2020-08-25 08:21:24 I wanna slap past me for using DeviantArt
general 2020-08-25 08:21:48 I actually used to use that site
general 2020-08-25 08:22:38 Now I stick onto the unholy list of mainstream websites
general 2020-08-25 08:22:46 Reddit, Twitter and YouTube
general 2020-08-25 08:23:13 "Mom of Baby"
general 2020-08-25 08:23:17 So wife?
general 2020-08-25 08:23:39 Clickbait ads aren't uncommon these days
general 2020-08-25 08:24:17 Mobile games, it's like a dungeon
general 2020-08-25 08:24:34 The enemies in that dungeon are the crappy apps
general 2020-08-25 08:24:45 The treasures are the hidden gems that are actually fun
general 2020-08-25 08:25:58 One last thing before I go 

Why are squeaky loud voices usually are bad news on YouTube
general 2020-08-25 08:27:02 Meanwhile in the opposite end of the spectrum, those YouTubers with at least somewhat of a deep voice usually mean good news
general 2020-08-25 08:27:43 Those that are loud but not squeaky usually are just well they're having fun
general 2020-08-25 08:27:54 Yes, conspiracy theorists begone
general 2020-08-25 08:28:21 An example of one of those deep voiced YouTubers I watch are one of the many channels Simon Whistler has
general 2020-08-25 08:28:27 Such as Business Blaze
general 2020-08-25 08:29:25 Bald guys on YouTube also can ring good news
general 2020-08-25 08:29:35 Well, I think I should go now
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 08:30:06 "OR I AM YOU REPORT"
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 08:30:34 Undes, not the brightest bulb
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 08:31:01 Best to fix them before they become so misguided to the point of just being disgusting human being
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 08:31:11 Like even behavior wise
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 08:31:46 Like if you're into weird things but is a good person to hang out with, at least you have that
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 08:32:38 I'm weird
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 08:32:59 Definitely not DA levels where its just screw boundaries
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 08:33:23 I should go now
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 08:33:26 Bye
general 2020-08-25 09:59:36 Canada, "America but better"
general 2020-08-25 09:59:54 I still remember them shipping a ship load of trash into the Philippines
general 2020-08-25 10:00:25 Let's not continue talking about that topic
general 2020-08-25 10:00:37 I mean it literally is above America
general 2020-08-25 10:00:50 Is it bigger than the US?
general 2020-08-25 10:01:12 Russia is a continent
general 2020-08-25 10:01:18 Just look at the size of it
general 2020-08-25 10:01:55 Also, Australia wants access to the YouTube algorithm
general 2020-08-25 10:02:01 For that sweet media company money
general 2020-08-25 10:02:09 That is all, I'll leave the rest to everyone else
general 2020-08-25 10:07:33 Is it bad that after some diving into the Internet I actually have an interest in aeromorphs now?
general 2020-08-25 10:08:37 Feetball
general 2020-08-25 10:09:10 Well at least it hasn't convinced me DeviantArt is good
general 2020-08-25 10:09:22 And I doubt it will
general 2020-08-25 10:10:24 My brain is now thinking of Transformers now
general 2020-08-25 10:10:37 Because both are humanoid
general 2020-08-25 10:15:22 Well, you're being deported to Brazil
general 2020-08-25 10:17:37 He gone
general 2020-08-25 10:20:27 Wait, isn't there a rule in Math called PEMDAS
general 2020-08-25 10:21:03 Basically, do these in this order 
- Parenthesis 
- Exponents 
- Multiplication 
- Division 
- Addition 
- Subtraction
general 2020-08-25 10:21:13 Do the ones in the parenthesis first
general 2020-08-25 10:21:47 I can't even remember the quadratic thing xp
general 2020-08-25 10:22:14 PEMDAS though is an essential rule to apply in Math
general 2020-08-25 10:22:31 Tomorrow we introduce ourselves to the teachers
general 2020-08-25 10:22:43 But classes actually start in September 1st
general 2020-08-25 10:23:19 All I remember is logic goes in hand with Math
general 2020-08-25 10:23:39 Microsoft has an app that helps you solve Math by teaching you how to do it
general 2020-08-25 10:23:51 Like seriously they have it on the Play Store
general 2020-08-25 10:24:51 Play Store
general 2020-08-25 10:24:58 Why is it named the Play Store
general 2020-08-25 10:27:37 Anything can sound weird if it ends with ~
general 2020-08-25 10:31:56 ***What did the rats do to you?***
general 2020-08-25 10:32:23 Ratsa Pasta
general 2020-08-25 10:34:31 Ratsa Pasta Yeeto Paste 

Let's make this chat even more cringe
general 2020-08-25 10:34:44 So we can torture everyone who dares come in
general 2020-08-25 10:35:36 Jugs
general 2020-08-25 10:35:43 ***J u g s***
general 2020-08-25 10:36:01 That thumbnail
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 11:57:03 
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 11:57:14 Made it look less like a weird chonker
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 11:57:20 But the back is flat
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 11:57:25 It looks so dull and plain
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 11:57:36 What do I do to make back not dull
general 2020-08-25 11:57:43 sports
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 11:58:10 I almost wanna take a look into the Tomcat for some help in design
general 2020-08-25 11:59:41 I've improve on my fighter's appearance
general 2020-08-25 12:00:03 New problem being the dull back
general 2020-08-25 12:00:06 <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 12:01:49 <@!396200986386890762> it is flat
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 12:02:05 More flatter than an F-14 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/US_Navy_051105-F-5480T-005_An_F-14D_Tomcat_conducts_a_mission_over_the_Persian_Gulf-region.jpg
general 2020-08-25 12:02:18 ***This is the greatest plan!***
general 2020-08-25 12:03:23 is this what I think it is?
general 2020-08-25 12:03:36 A flying dorito?
general 2020-08-25 12:08:27 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTmJKIsIjmI Is this what Math feels like?
general 2020-08-25 12:08:50 You just slowly go mad at how frustrating it is
general 2020-08-25 12:09:11 <@!426802747875131393> When you're in the womb
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 12:09:40 Well, the mods did say something about you need to put in effort too
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 12:09:49 Basically
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 12:10:00 Don't do the common literal brick with wheels
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 12:10:06 Gotta make it look like a vehicle too
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 12:10:19 So blocky car is fine, but literal block isn't
general 2020-08-25 12:11:44 Why ass?
general 2020-08-25 12:11:58 wait wat
general 2020-08-25 12:12:14 That reminded me of a video I accidentally stumbled upon
general 2020-08-25 12:12:22 On YouTube
general 2020-08-25 12:12:24 Related to Roblox
general 2020-08-25 12:13:18 <@!426802747875131393> Thing is, who the hell lets their niece be a giantess doing NSFW things in the Roblox Studio
general 2020-08-25 12:13:31 Like I'm just here going
general 2020-08-25 12:13:36 What the fuck why does this exist
general 2020-08-25 12:14:16 Yes, and you have reactivated that memory
general 2020-08-25 12:15:08 I tried to search it up again just to show you proof
general 2020-08-25 12:15:18 Now I'm scared to search it
general 2020-08-25 12:15:23 Too many giantess related stuff on Roblox
general 2020-08-25 12:15:32 Most, if not, none are SFW
general 2020-08-25 12:23:14 <@!551573378662662145> https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/747792416047628318 ***y o i n k***
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 12:25:35 So I was looking for Ren's video for the F-14 Tomcat, mostly just to get an idea how to design the rear of my  plane
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 12:25:42 Guess who I found in the first search results
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 12:25:50 ||Gamer Thailand||
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 12:25:55 yes
general 2020-08-25 12:28:56 So first aeromorphs, which was only cursed until Chingy risked his warnings for it
general 2020-08-25 12:29:08 Next furry stuff
general 2020-08-25 12:29:17 Then the next thing that happened was giantess stuff
general 2020-08-25 12:29:32 Today has been a cursed day
general 2020-08-25 12:30:11 Let's relax by taking a look at this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjOyl6zS-eU
general 2020-08-25 12:30:18 Take On Me but it's otamatones
general 2020-08-25 12:30:37 Flat Earth Society...
general 2020-08-25 12:30:49 What if Flat Earth is supposed to mean flat chested Earth
general 2020-08-25 12:31:39 <@!551573378662662145> Qued, just let the furries live like actual people for once
general 2020-08-25 12:31:43 Like they have hobbies
general 2020-08-25 12:32:00 *Yes*
general 2020-08-25 12:32:32 I mean, people cosplay as anime and people are pretty fine with it
general 2020-08-25 12:32:50 Yeah I got it
general 2020-08-25 12:34:05 Yeah, they usually do
general 2020-08-25 12:34:40 > And when people dislike something different they try to expel it
<@!426802747875131393> Honestly though that can be applied to real life
general 2020-08-25 12:35:07 People don't like it when someone's different
general 2020-08-25 12:35:27 meh
general 2020-08-25 12:36:03 > Until they start harrasing you that’s when you get the glock out
<@!725088321214087279> We already have enough of that on Twitter
general 2020-08-25 12:36:27 Like we seriously need to expel them out because they be ***really*** horn
general 2020-08-25 12:36:37 And other bad stuff
general 2020-08-25 12:36:47 And generally being clout chasers
general 2020-08-25 12:37:17 <@!426802747875131393> It's not surprising to find furry drama on Twitter, at least as a furry
general 2020-08-25 12:37:58 Because if I have to be honest, I've seen a lot of people being clout chasing, exploitative and generally being no good
general 2020-08-25 12:38:19 Like even furries wish they don't wanna be in the fandom
general 2020-08-25 12:38:27 Just because there's so much problems within the fandom
general 2020-08-25 12:39:13 It sucks considering a lot of drama, and them being abused for being LGBT
general 2020-08-25 14:03:46 Did Chingy just sent a macro sized furry?
general 2020-08-25 15:04:24 https://youtu.be/xXnfUNTAcZA Skip to around 4:30 

Make more of these so Karens will have to wear a mask
general 2020-08-25 15:05:02 We must invest
general 2020-08-25 15:05:07 Into the mask gun
general 2020-08-25 15:05:24 Yes, that is good gun
general 2020-08-25 15:05:28 Like pure good
general 2020-08-25 15:06:50 On another note, is Russia actually making progress on a vaccine for the pandemic?
general 2020-08-25 15:08:32 What engine does the Bloodhound LSC use to make 150,000 HP?
general 2020-08-25 15:09:03 I also heard it uses a Jaguar V8 to start the main engine of the LSC
general 2020-08-25 15:09:38 BRICS 

Countryballs but bricks 

Okay it's a group of countries though dr
general 2020-08-25 15:09:40 Fr*
general 2020-08-25 15:10:34 Isn't BRICS Russia, India, China and South Africa? I forgot the B
general 2020-08-25 15:11:03 ~~Dont send me to Brazil for forgetting it~~
general 2020-08-25 15:11:57 There is one thing I associate Russia most with
general 2020-08-25 15:12:03 That is the anthem of the USSR
general 2020-08-25 15:12:13 Because memes
general 2020-08-25 15:12:49 So she's overused?
general 2020-08-25 15:13:33 I noticed it when I watched TheRealSullyG's video about it
general 2020-08-25 15:14:03 Otamatone = best instrument
general 2020-08-25 15:14:20 Someone make a giant Otamatone in PC
general 2020-08-25 15:14:37 And use speakers and horns for more honkage
general 2020-08-25 15:15:11 My hands smell like chicken
general 2020-08-25 15:15:46 Mmm, roast chicken
general 2020-08-25 15:17:13 <@723419054114865202> ***Can you feel the SPED?!***
general 2020-08-25 15:17:50 Oh, search up banana rotat e
general 2020-08-25 15:18:20 No
general 2020-08-25 15:18:28 We come back*
general 2020-08-25 15:19:02 My brain thought of melted popsicle
general 2020-08-25 15:19:12 It looks like a melted popsicle
general 2020-08-25 15:19:27 Guess I'm in the mood for ice cream
general 2020-08-25 15:19:46 A caramel sundae sounds nice rn
general 2020-08-25 15:20:11 Pure sweet
general 2020-08-25 15:20:24 A hot fudge sundae's also nice
general 2020-08-25 15:20:48 RickCity
general 2020-08-25 15:21:58 OurCity
general 2020-08-25 15:22:20 Leningrad
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 15:24:40 Distraction dance?
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 15:25:34 Delta wing
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 15:25:59 Wait I just noticed from the illustrations
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 15:26:15 That's a funny looking delta
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 15:26:35 Trapezoid wing?
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 15:27:33 I should really improve on designing planes
general 2020-08-25 15:28:18 Now leave them there because that's a one way trip
general 2020-08-25 15:28:45 Two way trip expensive, one way trip cheap $$$
general 2020-08-25 22:48:21 <@348204263614447636> You're literally right
general 2020-08-25 22:50:38 Thinking of going back to Reddit, I'll just be avoiding certain subreddits such as r/politics
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 22:53:43 And then everyone got hurt from luggage falling out
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:07:00 Well, gonna go for bottom mounted air intakes again
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:07:23 Oh, I'm making a plane atm
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:07:47 A bottom mounted air intake like in the F-16 Fighting Falcon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:08:04 Still trying to make a twinjet though
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:10:05 space chonker worm
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 02:10:27 It really reminds me of Minecraft silverfish ngl
general 2020-08-26 02:10:55 Would Minecraft in Germany be called Meincraft?
general 2020-08-26 02:11:31 Germany also wants some of that French ass
general 2020-08-26 02:11:46 ~~I mean why did they invade France two times~~
general 2020-08-26 02:12:20 Guess I must've misremembered stuff
general 2020-08-26 02:13:58 Probably just misremembered the French entry into World War 1 as Germany invading France
general 2020-08-26 02:14:12 Though in WW2 Germany did invade France
general 2020-08-26 02:14:45 My plane looks like it has chubby cheeks
general 2020-08-26 02:15:44 Still better than that one time I made it too wide
general 2020-08-26 02:16:16 
general 2020-08-26 02:17:10 More of a non-PvP thing
general 2020-08-26 02:17:25 I'll be using locked motors
general 2020-08-26 02:17:40 done what?
general 2020-08-26 02:18:07 the overpopulation of brazil from people being sent there?
general 2020-08-26 02:19:09 What did my brain led me to
general 2020-08-26 02:19:20 I thought of football after thinking of Brazil
general 2020-08-26 02:19:26 I remembered a joke
general 2020-08-26 02:19:36 And now I remembered that feet pic of an aeromorph Chingy sent
general 2020-08-26 02:20:13 I wish I forgot that
general 2020-08-26 02:20:47 I will now go look at Tomcat pics https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pjgCS5uzopg/Tg326jbIKdI/AAAAAAAACFE/0pKUIXpyH2o/s1600/F-14_Tomcat4.jpg
general 2020-08-26 02:20:52 So I have an idea how to design the rear of my plane
general 2020-08-26 02:21:31 Rien
general 2020-08-26 02:21:35 Is that Gary with no shell?
general 2020-08-26 02:21:52 ***S n a i l   b u t t***
general 2020-08-26 02:22:37 Is the F-14 Tomcat's rear really that flat? https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N15DP8Gf1Lo/UwLK2SCjLvI/AAAAAAAAQlg/ksWQKXYlPX4/s1600/Rear+view+of+IRIAF+Grumman+F-14+Bombcat+fitted+with+500+lb.+general-purpose+bombs+3.jpeg
general 2020-08-26 02:22:47 that be one flat plane ass
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 05:56:08 
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 05:56:26 
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 05:57:06 I tried to make the engines Ren used on his F-14 Tomcat
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 05:57:18 And it looks much better than what I usually do for less space
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 06:02:04 British engineering levels of unreliable?
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 06:03:48 I can't tell the difference from a British Leyland car
general 2020-08-26 06:06:37 How reliable do y'all think of MG is today? A British car company owned by a Chinese company
general 2020-08-26 06:10:58 The mods are visiting the people in Brazil
general 2020-08-26 06:12:37 Why do I usually struggle with a plane's ass
general 2020-08-26 06:14:40 My brain is empty rn
general 2020-08-26 06:14:54 And this doesn't even have motor locks still
general 2020-08-26 06:15:08 This is just the basic shape it'll have which I'll use as reference
general 2020-08-26 06:25:12 I'm having a creative brainfuck
general 2020-08-26 06:26:39 I can't judge that, I'm not a helicopter engineer
general 2020-08-26 06:28:44 Oh, I thought it was the tail rotor's job to make a helicopter stop spinning
general 2020-08-26 06:29:16 ~~this is why I don't wanna be a helicopter engineer~~
general 2020-08-26 06:29:34 Less work on planes, apart from making them ***c u r v  y***
general 2020-08-26 06:30:28 I still have no idea how I'll transition this from block to a motor locked rocket engine + jet engine tbh
general 2020-08-26 06:30:51 Yes, it's a quirky ass
general 2020-08-26 06:31:42 Anything that uses propellers is challenging in this game
general 2020-08-26 06:31:54 Unless you use the default propellers
general 2020-08-26 06:33:58 fuck it i'll just go ahead
general 2020-08-26 06:34:39 <@!608204785384030208> Trying to motor lock
general 2020-08-26 06:34:49 Wait
general 2020-08-26 06:34:53 I'm forgetting the stabilators
general 2020-08-26 06:34:56 And the rudders
general 2020-08-26 06:35:16 <@!347182144873037824> North Korea's too ancient for that
general 2020-08-26 06:36:12 Submit a massive 3 fold plane
general 2020-08-26 06:36:18 With 3 fold wings
general 2020-08-26 06:36:37 ~~Even if it looks fuckin ugly~~
general 2020-08-26 06:37:36 I got upvotes from it, enough for the mods to approve
general 2020-08-26 06:37:54 ~~even if it was downvoted to heck~~
general 2020-08-26 06:40:02 *Motor locking*
general 2020-08-26 06:40:17 If you can't find any other to fill it in, add details with motor locks
general 2020-08-26 06:41:19 Pink Land Rover
general 2020-08-26 06:41:41 <@!608204785384030208> Still better than stanced rides
general 2020-08-26 06:42:56 Yes I said it
general 2020-08-26 06:43:05 Still better than stanced rides
general 2020-08-26 06:44:46 Excuse me while I copy homework from everyone else in this server
general 2020-08-26 06:47:25 ***TrY mE m8!!!11!!!***
general 2020-08-26 06:47:50 ||I like when the chat devolves into degeneracy||
general 2020-08-26 06:48:15 what?
general 2020-08-26 06:48:43 Over here we use the power of the union
the-dump 2020-08-26 06:54:10 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_bIaupAeSE This is me when I realize there's a shredder bug user in the server
general 2020-08-26 06:56:20 I thought this was gonna be them trying to put the blame on someone else
general 2020-08-26 06:58:21 <@!347182144873037824> Now this looks more like something N. Korea would make
general 2020-08-26 06:59:17 Well lucky you
general 2020-08-26 06:59:41 Fr though how technologically advanced is N. Korea?
general 2020-08-26 07:00:23 oh ok
general 2020-08-26 07:00:33 Tbh I've associated them with WW2 leftovers
general 2020-08-26 07:01:36 To be fair though they made an ICBM (to which I hope it's a dud) so I guess I'm also underestimating N. Korea
general 2020-08-26 07:03:02 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-21 Well their planes are more recent than I thought
general 2020-08-26 07:03:10 A Mig-21, guess I was wrong
general 2020-08-26 07:03:34 You need wings
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 07:08:04 <@!447221768520859659> Still better than what I can do
plane-crazy 2020-08-26 07:08:08 I still suck xp
general 2020-08-26 07:09:12 idk, I'm just taking a break
general 2020-08-26 07:09:21 As I struggle to build good
general 2020-08-26 07:10:23 The Germans can have the snek
general 2020-08-26 07:10:34 The US already has an eagle and Russia has bears

general 2020-08-26 07:14:36 <@!347182144873037824> The world is just the Soviet Union then
general 2020-08-26 07:15:55 <@!551573378662662145> hot
general 2020-08-26 07:16:28 Just let them have those images
general 2020-08-26 07:16:42 To distract them
general 2020-08-26 07:16:48 For entering y'all's personal space
general 2020-08-26 07:17:48 <@!645128367611445248> I wonder if aeromorphs would work as a distraction for undes
general 2020-08-26 07:18:25 <@456226577798135808>
general 2020-08-26 07:20:07 thomas go die
general 2020-08-26 07:20:33 That
general 2020-08-26 07:20:39 That looks even worse than four eyed Peppa Pig
general 2020-08-26 07:22:56 <@!512467907469377539> Thanks for reminding me that there's a game where there's a WW2 game in this style https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moe_anthropomorphism
general 2020-08-26 07:23:02 Where the countries are literal people
general 2020-08-26 07:23:27 I forgot the name of the game
general 2020-08-26 07:23:34 But it exists
general 2020-08-26 07:24:07 I mean aeromorphs exist
general 2020-08-26 07:24:26 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/748077932018270208 This is an aeromorph
general 2020-08-26 07:24:43 Which is worse
general 2020-08-26 07:24:49 Countryhumans or aeromorphs
general 2020-08-26 07:25:48 <@!512467907469377539> There's an aeromorph of an ekranoplans
general 2020-08-26 07:25:56 And it's beyond the size of a mountain range
general 2020-08-26 07:26:33 <@!608204785384030208> A Sukhoi aeromorph exists, and it's within the jet era too
general 2020-08-26 07:26:56 And it's in this server
general 2020-08-26 07:27:18 oh god no
general 2020-08-26 07:27:25 Don't make countryhumans nsfw
general 2020-08-26 07:27:34 Planeballs, plane but shape like a ball
general 2020-08-26 07:28:11 <@!512467907469377539> That doesn't look like an aeromorph
general 2020-08-26 07:28:17 That looks like a cartoonized plane
general 2020-08-26 07:28:25 The kind if you had to make a kids' masoct
general 2020-08-26 07:28:49 I remembered seeing an aeromoprh online that wasn't as cursed
general 2020-08-26 07:28:57 Because it looked like a robot at least
general 2020-08-26 07:29:17 <@!512467907469377539> I suggest you turn on safe search, and avoid DeviantArt altogether
general 2020-08-26 07:30:03 I just realized something
general 2020-08-26 07:30:24 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hood_(1973_film) Furry before furry
general 2020-08-26 07:31:14 <@!448505589983739914> I've seen too much to the point aeromorphs are normal for me
general 2020-08-26 07:31:30 I still cringe at DeviantArt though
general 2020-08-26 07:31:36 Twitter, it's society in a nutshell
general 2020-08-26 07:32:21 <@!608204785384030208> There are aeromorphs but for cars
general 2020-08-26 07:32:26 ***They're worse***
general 2020-08-26 07:32:41 At least aeromorphs I can pretend they're just strange looking robots
general 2020-08-26 07:33:08 <@!551573378662662145> They definitely exist, and not just dragons doing the thing with cars
general 2020-08-26 07:33:38 At least with aeromorphs y'all can pretend they're just some curvy looking robots if they're within the jet era
general 2020-08-26 07:33:42 With automorphs
general 2020-08-26 07:33:44 ***I can't***
general 2020-08-26 07:34:26 <@!551573378662662145> I saw someone drew an anthropomorphic PS5 controller, it's actually not that bad tbh
general 2020-08-26 07:35:27 <@!448505589983739914> Go to the SFW section of FurAffinity
general 2020-08-26 07:35:40 Or selectively filter out the NSFW of Twitter artists
general 2020-08-26 07:36:03 <@!370594904268734464> I promise this isn't NSFW this time
general 2020-08-26 07:36:17 You can't really view NSFW
general 2020-08-26 07:36:20 Unless you get an account

general 2020-08-26 07:36:53 This chat should be clean
general 2020-08-26 07:37:07 ~~Besides I fear yousuf now~~
general 2020-08-26 07:38:18 help my brain is dying
general 2020-08-26 07:39:10 <@!287779983445721088> *US glances over with Fat Man and Little Boy*
general 2020-08-26 07:39:34 <@!551573378662662145> I mean children find peepee poopoo funny, don't they?
general 2020-08-26 07:40:02 Guess it depends on them
general 2020-08-26 07:40:26 this video is accurate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSd3dw4RN38
general 2020-08-26 07:40:32 even in non-pvp
general 2020-08-26 07:41:13 Jessie and James being the good guys now
general 2020-08-26 07:41:51 James has always been good considering he can raise a Pokemon better than Ash
general 2020-08-26 07:42:44 You cannot deny he actually raises them instead of going down the classic routine of ***battle battle battle***
general 2020-08-26 07:43:03 They shouldn't be getting Pikachu
general 2020-08-26 07:43:13 They should get Ash, for somehow he keeps attracting legendaries
general 2020-08-26 07:43:56 Pikachu has now been diagnosed with Stockholm Syndrome
general 2020-08-26 07:44:35 Now I'm getting "dad beats me" vibes from Pikachu and Ash
general 2020-08-26 07:44:47 Because just look at how Ash treats Pikachu, mostly fighting
general 2020-08-26 07:45:52 <@!551573378662662145> You're making me remind of some naughty stuff involving those two characters
general 2020-08-26 07:45:57 *Why*
general 2020-08-26 07:46:23 <@!608204785384030208> No, send that to DA
general 2020-08-26 07:47:11 Let's forget this happened, this is too weird even for me
general 2020-08-26 07:47:14 The local weirdo
general 2020-08-26 07:47:47 I'm weirder than you
general 2020-08-26 07:48:22 The chat finally died
general 2020-08-26 07:48:36 Send it off to the farm
general 2020-08-26 07:49:18 Doof must be really good at drawing if he can draw a face that well
general 2020-08-26 07:50:02 Can we all agree Doofenschmirtz is just misunderstood and mistreated
general 2020-08-26 07:50:52 As a dad, he really tries his best. Remember those episodes with the doll and Vanessa's birthday
general 2020-08-26 07:51:19 If he wanted to be really evil, shouldn't he aim to rule over the world?
general 2020-08-26 07:51:37 What if Doof's plans are just overly expensive ways of getting Perry's attention
general 2020-08-26 07:51:54 ~~because he has a crippling case of loneliness~~
general 2020-08-26 07:52:27 Somehow he managed to work out the kinks in his relationship with his ex-wife, so it doesn't really look like a broken family to Vanessa
general 2020-08-26 07:53:08 He could've left Vanessa's ex as a chimera thing
general 2020-08-26 07:53:11 But he didn't
general 2020-08-26 07:53:32 He's clumsy, but not *that* evil
general 2020-08-26 07:54:24 wait
general 2020-08-26 07:54:34 isn't that the first phineas and ferb movie?
general 2020-08-26 07:55:00 <@!448505589983739914> How did they get inators at OWCA? Maybe they steal his inator plans?
general 2020-08-26 07:55:07 I mean it benefits them both tbh
general 2020-08-26 07:55:24 Doof isn't so lonely and they get inators
general 2020-08-26 07:55:44 Plus all we've seen Doof do really is just embarass his brother
general 2020-08-26 07:55:48 Not do any actual harm
general 2020-08-26 07:56:34 <@!448505589983739914> Didn't Doof hang out with Perry a bunch of several times?
general 2020-08-26 07:56:52 I mean Perry could've arrested him, but instead he just lets him do his schemes and even helps him out at times
general 2020-08-26 07:57:17 Yes
general 2020-08-26 07:57:29 Somehow he didn't get arrested or something like that
general 2020-08-26 07:57:32 They actually let him work
general 2020-08-26 07:57:43 Yes, Doof deserves to get what he didn't get
general 2020-08-26 07:57:56 And he's doing that with his daughter tbh, giving her what he didn't receive
general 2020-08-26 07:58:54 He came at her birth, threw her birthdays, gave her lots of love and support (much to the embarassment because he's really oversupportive)
general 2020-08-26 07:59:10 Basically, he's a smart as heck dad with a case of crippling loneliness
general 2020-08-26 07:59:37 Not impossible if you've just done it
general 2020-08-26 08:00:02 I remember launching myself with magnets
general 2020-08-26 08:00:06 ***s p e e d***

general 2020-08-26 08:01:36 This channel, meme + weird
general 2020-08-26 08:01:46 basically shitposting in video form
general 2020-08-26 08:02:43 Remember when Doof convinced people to buy his merch?
general 2020-08-26 08:02:56 That's literally every cringy YouTuber with an audience of kids
general 2020-08-26 08:03:05 The inator is their videos

general 2020-08-26 08:11:24 You know what would be cursed? Rasputin but it's a Minecraft song

general 2020-08-26 08:16:52 oh
general 2020-08-26 08:17:37 I wonder how milk tea tastes like
general 2020-08-26 08:17:43 Because it's popular over here yet I never tried it
general 2020-08-26 08:18:00 I'm only used to the taste of iced tea tbh
general 2020-08-26 08:18:05 Any other tea and I'm not interested
general 2020-08-26 08:18:21 But milk tea, if people like it then I guess there's a reason why
general 2020-08-26 08:18:43 Coffee
general 2020-08-26 08:18:55 I remembered MatPat saying on Food Theory coffee caused The Enlightenment
general 2020-08-26 08:19:20 Coffee...

general 2020-08-26 08:20:51 Rasputin is played on an Otamatone
general 2020-08-26 08:20:57 By the king of Otamatones himself
general 2020-08-26 08:21:03 TheRealSullyG
general 2020-08-26 08:21:29 He also has that
general 2020-08-26 08:21:54 Issa_Bass is the Toad version of TheRealSullyG
general 2020-08-26 08:21:58 He sings with Toad's voice
general 2020-08-26 08:22:35 ~~if only there was a video of waluigi singing rasputin~~
general 2020-08-26 08:22:47 ~~it just feels so fitting to hear "Wah Wah Wasputin"~~
general 2020-08-26 08:23:17 <@!347182144873037824> please stop with the aeromorphs the joke needs some rest
general 2020-08-26 08:23:28 I think I'll go send a cursed image here

general 2020-08-26 08:23:52 Wait
general 2020-08-26 08:24:00 I'm right the Earth is ruled by dinos
general 2020-08-26 08:24:06 We are ruled by the lizard people
general 2020-08-26 08:24:22 <@!695352880735191040> You have given qued too much power
general 2020-08-26 08:24:58 <@!551573378662662145> That's not gonna stop me from sending it (besides what I have in mind it's not even remotely NSFW)
general 2020-08-26 08:25:12 Oh, I was about to send something here
general 2020-08-26 08:25:17 Let me turn off this computer and move onto mobile
general 2020-08-26 08:25:41 <@!347182144873037824> You do not out hot the wheels
general 2020-08-26 08:26:03 Just like how you shouldn't out pizza the hut
general 2020-08-26 08:26:38 qoou
general 2020-08-26 08:27:17 Anyways prepare for my attempt at trying to hurt the eyes of everyone in this chat
general 2020-08-26 08:56:37 <@287779983445721088> yes it is, it's also Pixar's first film to see widespread success
general 2020-08-26 08:56:57 Oh I'm still doing it
general 2020-08-26 08:57:17 I just wanted to say some stuff about Pixar first
general 2020-08-26 08:57:42 Pixar had Steve Jobs on board, who also designed the Next series of computers
general 2020-08-26 08:58:03 The Next computers were actually top of the line during their time of release
general 2020-08-26 08:58:25 Well, if we don't count workstations such as the SGI Indigo
general 2020-08-26 08:59:00 But even then, the Next computers I remembered also helped to lay the foundations of her internet
general 2020-08-26 08:59:09 Anyways
general 2020-08-26 08:59:23 Time to do what I promised to everyone's eyes
general 2020-08-26 09:00:35 This is a PS5 controller
general 2020-08-26 09:00:55 Oh
general 2020-08-26 09:01:12 Judging by the chat's reactions, this isn't as bad as the aeromorphs
general 2020-08-26 09:02:41 <@546223347025969164> I made a promise to harm this chat's eyes, and I see I've failed
general 2020-08-26 09:03:14 I feel braindead
general 2020-08-26 09:03:24 More than i usually am
general 2020-08-26 09:03:58 On a scale of 1-10, how bad is the image I sent?
general 2020-08-26 09:04:16 no
general 2020-08-26 09:04:23 Not even I would take that
general 2020-08-26 09:05:09 That sets off my DeviantArt alarms
general 2020-08-26 09:05:44 0balance, let the professional weirdos do the job for yoU next tine
general 2020-08-26 09:05:59 I.E, me
general 2020-08-26 09:06:15 <@347182144873037824> What did you found?
general 2020-08-26 09:06:38 DMs
general 2020-08-26 09:07:19 What's the closest words you can find then
general 2020-08-26 09:08:06 Aeromorph doing feet stuff?
general 2020-08-26 09:08:33 Because if it's that, that's pretty tame compared to some stuff I've seen
general 2020-08-26 09:09:09 Trust me, you better to turn safe search next time
general 2020-08-26 09:09:42 Dying from lag
general 2020-08-26 09:11:09 Well, I don't know what to do now
general 2020-08-26 09:11:23 Tbh I have mixed feelings towards aeromorphs
general 2020-08-26 09:12:08 <@347182144873037824> It depends if what it's doing is weird or not
general 2020-08-26 09:12:18 If it's just anthropomorphic plane, well ok that exists
general 2020-08-26 09:12:42 If you think about it we just accept weirdness and hate on some
general 2020-08-26 09:14:03 Not meaning to offend anyone, but how would someone who is completely oblivious to anime would feel towards it
general 2020-08-26 09:14:08 Like that's just my point of view
general 2020-08-26 09:14:33 Like it's unfamiliar, so we don't like it
general 2020-08-26 09:14:41 We as a species like familiarity
general 2020-08-26 09:15:25 I'll just go back on Reddit and consume my daily dose of countryballs
general 2020-08-26 09:15:48 <@656137684213039124> Which console?
general 2020-08-26 09:16:08 Well, I heard you say emulator
general 2020-08-26 09:16:36 Oh, Bluestacks?
general 2020-08-26 09:16:44 It emulates Android
general 2020-08-26 09:16:47 Oh ok
general 2020-08-26 09:17:53 <@534419428368973835> That is accurate
general 2020-08-26 09:18:03 For I have given up on Python for now
general 2020-08-26 09:18:10 Until I receive motivation again
general 2020-08-26 09:18:23 I might try programming again
general 2020-08-26 09:18:46 After Python, I could try C# for game dev stuff tbh
general 2020-08-26 09:19:07 Does Unreal use C#?
general 2020-08-26 09:19:51 <@347182144873037824> Shred it
general 2020-08-26 09:20:52 <@278351709607165953> On my i7 laptop, I don't need to
general 2020-08-26 09:21:07 I just need to run Minecraft with shaders and mods xp
general 2020-08-26 09:21:19 Isn't Pentium dead?
general 2020-08-26 09:22:29 My i7 laptop died so I have to settle for an air cooled AMD A7 or whatever the name of the APU is
general 2020-08-26 09:22:52 With a graphics card that only has 1 GB of VRAM
general 2020-08-26 09:27:02 Hmm, gaming but on server CPU
general 2020-08-26 09:27:07 Gaming on a Xeon
general 2020-08-26 09:27:19 You can't
general 2020-08-26 09:27:48 Nobody can, until Plane Crazy has more people on board and is easier to work with
general 2020-08-26 09:28:04 Well unless its in this server
general 2020-08-26 09:28:11 You can report people in this server
general 2020-08-26 09:28:50 Bots channel
general 2020-08-26 09:29:00 There's a reason it can't be used here
general 2020-08-26 09:29:13 Wait
general 2020-08-26 09:29:16 Is Dyno down?
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:29:48 You're a quick learner
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:30:23 ?userinfo <@347182144873037824>
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:30:46 That's fine *pat pat*
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:31:52 I remember my original Discord account
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:32:17 ~~I lost the fucking access because of Gmail~~
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:32:24 I have access to it now
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:33:12 ?whois rickje139
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:34:01 Wait, I just realized that
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:34:17 Does it?
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:34:41 ?whois BlueSeaReptile
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:34:57 ?whois Dense Reptile
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:35:03 It doesn't ping rick
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:35:05 Good
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:35:25 ?whois your dad
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:36:41 ?whois who asked?
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:37:39 <@347182144873037824> Hire a hitman instead, nobody can find the body that way
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:37:56 It's more terrifying to die alone than to die with plenty of people around you
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:38:08 Let them be in fear first
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:38:49 No, no
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:38:55 Get a Hecate
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:39:03 Then dump the body into the ocean
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:39:49 Tbh I'm making it a little dark now
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:39:57 I'll stop
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:40:43 So my fart is humane?
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:41:48 <@347182144873037824> Go eat at Taco Bell and fart at a shredder bug user, same effect with less money
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:42:53 Your butt gas is silent but deadly too
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:44:38 Buy an old ICBM or an old rocket from the Soviet Union
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:44:57 For your purposes this is cost effective
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:45:14 <@347182144873037824> Imagine having Thanos's glove
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:45:23 Or gauntlet
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:45:42 Whichever term you prefer to use (I prefer the latter)
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:46:42 I saw that
general 2020-08-26 09:47:12 Here's a question to everyone in general
general 2020-08-26 09:47:35 What if you had Thanos's gauntlet ||(or glove >:()||
general 2020-08-26 09:47:55 Like what would you do with it?
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:48:51 So end diseases, world hunger, more peace (but not a utopia, that's impossible)
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:49:14 <@347182144873037824> So space British Empire?
bot-central 2020-08-26 09:49:27 I saw what you typed in there
general 2020-08-26 09:49:54 What would the snap do?
general 2020-08-26 09:50:01 Who would it erase?
general 2020-08-26 09:50:50 Why not snap some people away
general 2020-08-26 09:51:05 Like those child touchers
general 2020-08-26 09:51:13 I mean, you do have all the power
general 2020-08-26 09:52:11 <@347182144873037824> You have infinite power, tap into their minds what is eternal suffering for them
general 2020-08-26 09:52:57 Nothing airjet
general 2020-08-26 09:53:06 Just banana rotat e
general 2020-08-26 09:54:38 Ngl Airjet makes me think of France, which makes me think of Dassault
general 2020-08-26 09:55:05 Germany already did that
general 2020-08-26 09:55:36 Waffle nice
general 2020-08-26 09:55:52 <@347182144873037824> You are pure chaos
general 2020-08-26 09:56:01 ***Bomb Brazil***
general 2020-08-26 09:56:08 There I said it
general 2020-08-26 09:57:18 That looks cursed
general 2020-08-26 09:57:35 your mom
general 2020-08-26 09:57:40 nice.
general 2020-08-26 09:58:12 <@347182144873037824> Okay for real though end Anerica's suffering
general 2020-08-26 09:59:09 Australia's been done (which means we don't have to worry about them opening the gates of monopoly for big media)
general 2020-08-26 09:59:17 What else...
general 2020-08-26 09:59:22 Can't do Russia, too memey
general 2020-08-26 10:00:05 Japan's been bombed already so give it mercy
general 2020-08-26 10:00:20 Plus it makes all your favorite stuff
general 2020-08-26 10:00:32 *Its also unfortunate weird stuff also comes from there too*
general 2020-08-26 10:01:28 After thinking of US and Asia, now I'm thinking of China
general 2020-08-26 10:01:47 Leave Brazil
general 2020-08-26 10:01:54 We need them for the prisoners
general 2020-08-26 10:02:09 But we need a place to jail people
general 2020-08-26 10:02:39 Bomb the Earth's core
general 2020-08-26 10:03:27 I heard Rwanda's improving as a country
general 2020-08-26 10:03:39 Like everything in general
general 2020-08-26 10:04:20 <@347182144873037824> Moto-moto lives in Madagascar
general 2020-08-26 10:04:37 Elon Musk is Mad At Gas Car
general 2020-08-26 10:05:42 <@347182144873037824> Wait if Japan is usually stereotyped with weird stuff...

... then what if furries came from there
general 2020-08-26 10:06:03 But what if it doesnt
general 2020-08-26 10:06:16 Yeah that
general 2020-08-26 10:06:40 It's a hard choice isn't it?
general 2020-08-26 10:07:19 You're still gonna bomb it, even if it means losing big tech companies, famous game devs and anime
general 2020-08-26 10:08:24 What if I told you, we also *boop*
general 2020-08-26 10:09:04 And that we also took your OWOs and UWUs
general 2020-08-26 10:09:40 But what if I live in the US or Eussia?
general 2020-08-26 10:09:48 Russia*
general 2020-08-26 10:10:32 What if it's your mom
general 2020-08-26 10:11:09 What if I were to purchase fast food and disguise as my own cooking
general 2020-08-26 10:12:13 <@347182144873037824> He Stalin her heart, but left her so he can Stalin Russia
general 2020-08-26 10:13:36 I thought the US would be the father land
general 2020-08-26 10:14:36 Germany is the tiny yet abusive father
general 2020-08-26 10:15:58 Russia is le thicc, she used to be friends with France until Germany cheated for France in WW2
general 2020-08-26 10:17:22 Honk honk you're a horn
general 2020-08-26 10:17:37 Wait a second
general 2020-08-26 10:18:13 That sounds a lot like "adult Japanese media"

general 2020-08-26 13:34:32 Something that isn't a grind fest like Adopt Me
general 2020-08-26 13:34:57 Or a robux grabber like... Adopt Me
general 2020-08-26 13:35:34 Noted
general 2020-08-26 13:35:46 I also forgot data packs exist in Minecraft
general 2020-08-26 13:36:05 I wonder if it's possible to implement Microsoft BASIC but within chat
plane-crazy 2020-08-27 00:15:25 Should I adopt to using ramp air intakes, such as in the F-14 Tomcat and most modern Russian fighter jets
plane-crazy 2020-08-27 00:16:09 I honestly feel like I can't continue using DSIs atm without making a plane look fat
general 2020-08-27 00:17:48 Do I have to use this to make a plane look not fat and chonky https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intake_ramp
general 2020-08-27 00:18:51 I've used those bottom mounted scoops
general 2020-08-27 00:18:57 *They were fuckin ugly*
general 2020-08-27 00:20:53 When he is ready to leave anime for a girl
general 2020-08-27 00:21:57 Anna Mae is good enough for rickje
general 2020-08-27 00:22:01 He don't need another girl
general 2020-08-27 00:22:19 Stick bugged
general 2020-08-27 00:22:23 Gone, distracted away
general 2020-08-27 00:22:42 And wait is that actually in Plane Crazy rn?

general 2020-08-27 00:34:19 <@!527653676022628353> You have the 2nd best rick as your pfp
general 2020-08-27 00:34:28 Rick
general 2020-08-27 00:34:41 You should really invest in a dev team
general 2020-08-27 00:34:54 Because one man is not enough
general 2020-08-27 00:35:21 Planes use wings to turn, right?
general 2020-08-27 00:35:29 <@!526468680498806786>
general 2020-08-27 00:36:18 Use the custom control surfaces us aero engineers use
general 2020-08-27 00:36:35 Literally just wings attached to motor 2 servos
general 2020-08-27 00:37:21 I mean he did say is there anything else apart from rockets
general 2020-08-27 00:37:30 So I gave him an answer that doesn't use rockets
general 2020-08-27 00:38:44 It'll give you some control in it's flight, but I suggest attaching those delta wings to a motor 2 set to servo so you can control it with keyboard

general 2020-08-27 00:44:51 <@!526468680498806786> You also need stabilators/elevators
general 2020-08-27 00:44:54 As well as rudders
general 2020-08-27 00:45:23 Well oof
general 2020-08-27 00:45:46 Well, all an elevator does is to adjust the pitch of any flying object
general 2020-08-27 00:46:09 A rudder adjusts yaw
general 2020-08-27 00:46:28 But you'll also need an extra set of wings to adjust roll
general 2020-08-27 00:46:31 So add some canards
general 2020-08-27 00:48:13 Because the paparazzi wants ***a s s *** pics

general 2020-08-27 01:16:48 I just noticed it's a rainbow too
general 2020-08-27 01:16:53 or something like that
general 2020-08-27 01:17:19 Got tired of lag, so I'm gonna play an emulator (Kega Fusion)
general 2020-08-27 01:25:17 I'll just be playing some Sonic CD
general 2020-08-27 01:28:15 I have made it crash
general 2020-08-27 01:28:35 Loaded in a save state for Sonic the Hedgehog instead of Sonic CD
general 2020-08-27 01:32:53 I'm just gonna play After Burner
general 2020-08-27 01:33:12 Arcade game with an F-14 Tomcat
general 2020-08-27 02:43:15 Apache Attacke
general 2020-08-27 02:44:04 Well, at least they aren't using shredders
general 2020-08-27 02:44:58 A lot of my planes usually go supersonic (I consider 600 to be subsonic), will speed alone be enough?
general 2020-08-27 02:46:28 Is that supposed to be a Supra?
general 2020-08-27 02:47:30 I will now go do the Russian design of planes
general 2020-08-27 02:47:48 Cockpit, then flat, then air intakes underneath
general 2020-08-27 02:47:57 And see if it's better than what I usually do
general 2020-08-27 02:49:00 Reminds me of the 911
general 2020-08-27 08:11:39 I'm gonna go read this thing with Zuggy
general 2020-08-27 08:14:34 So I see a snowflake with brain damage who isn't willing to accept criticism
general 2020-08-27 08:16:36 I understand frustration, but that 

I'm just gonna stay away
general 2020-08-27 08:16:48 It reeks of toxicity
plane-crazy 2020-08-27 08:18:49 <@714763671410180127> Those minions have the same vibe as how much brain cells I have left over
general 2020-08-27 08:20:44 I just torrent
general 2020-08-27 08:20:58 Because that is what I have been teached
general 2020-08-27 08:21:14 Also there are cracking groups that release xracked versions of software don't they?

plane-crazy 2020-08-27 09:19:40 <@!448505589983739914> That's a pretty nice interior ngl
plane-crazy 2020-08-27 09:19:48 Doing some progress, no motor locks yet, decided to try out ramp air intakes instead of bottom mounted air scoops
plane-crazy 2020-08-27 09:21:00 I looked up the planes made by Sukhoi and Mikoyan to see how a ramp intake would work
plane-crazy 2020-08-27 09:22:06 And just decided to go ahead with just designing them like that
plane-crazy 2020-08-27 09:25:06 <@!645128367611445248> I know, considering how noob I am at designing stuff
plane-crazy 2020-08-27 09:25:38 I've done a lot of revisions
plane-crazy 2020-08-27 09:26:03 Might as well do the basic shape, then do some touching up when I do the basic shape
plane-crazy 2020-08-27 09:31:49 i lag, so i head to vip2
plane-crazy 2020-08-27 09:32:03 because vip1 probably is crowded

general 2020-08-28 02:38:47 The country of Nigeria
general 2020-08-28 02:39:10 It's a country in Africa
general 2020-08-28 02:39:20 With three stripes
general 2020-08-28 02:39:25 As a flag
general 2020-08-28 02:39:29 Why are three stripes so common
general 2020-08-28 02:40:46 As long as it's not used in a racist way, you can use the name Niger since it's a real country
general 2020-08-28 02:41:16 And near it is a country named Chad
general 2020-08-28 02:41:20 ***C h a d***
general 2020-08-28 02:42:31 Speaking of Europe, they have a lot of three striped flags
general 2020-08-28 02:42:41 And if it's not three, then it's two
general 2020-08-28 02:44:23 Greenland also has two stripes
general 2020-08-28 02:44:45 The only difference Greenland has with Poland and Indonesia's flags is circle
general 2020-08-28 02:44:49 Literally just circle
general 2020-08-28 02:45:23 It's also Danish property
general 2020-08-28 02:46:41 Is there a special meaning behind semen in Indonesian? Because there's a company that's literally called "Semen Indonesia Group"
general 2020-08-28 02:46:59 Like I'm asking this as a legit question
general 2020-08-28 02:47:54 So cement but without the T?
general 2020-08-28 02:48:56 Still not as unfortunate as the name Siemens
general 2020-08-28 02:51:10 Thinking about how RGB works
general 2020-08-28 02:51:43 It makes me think of the maximum number 8-bit integers can have
general 2020-08-28 02:52:24 Imagine Adobe
general 2020-08-28 02:53:21 <@456226577798135808> Imagine baguettes attacking
general 2020-08-28 02:56:51 France and the UK are like frenemies
general 2020-08-28 02:57:12 Enemies until Germany wants to collect all of the baguettes

plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:05:55 damnit you missed #6969
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:06:03 We as a community should suggest which wedges we need
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:06:17 I would like to have longer half wedges and half triangle wedge blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:06:43 We need more s m o o t h n e s s
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:07:15 Right now we're settling for motor locks
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:07:20 But that just gets verbose
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:08:29 You know what's satisfying
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:08:34 Having a server all for yourself
general 2020-08-28 03:08:45 Understeer
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:09:13 I am almost alone
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:09:21 I just need two people to leave and I am fully alone
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:11:41 I observe everyone else
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:11:53 ~~because I have the intelligence of a fermented potato~~
general 2020-08-28 03:12:43 Unpowered motors?
general 2020-08-28 03:13:04 Like with enough balance maybe they'll balance themselves? I dunno never made a ferris wheel
general 2020-08-28 03:13:33 Unpowered motors really are just free moving hinges
general 2020-08-28 03:14:14 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_Furai This car runs purely on alcohol
general 2020-08-28 03:14:27 Get the Russians to rebuild this car and make it run on vodka
general 2020-08-28 03:14:43 And slap on a Marussia B2 body for more Russian vibes
general 2020-08-28 03:19:52 Question is, what about the center?
general 2020-08-28 03:20:06 Will it mirror on the other side or just builds normally?
general 2020-08-28 03:20:48 Simple, it won't mirror at the center
general 2020-08-28 03:22:03 See that arrow in the plot? The tip of the arrow is the center of the plot
general 2020-08-28 03:22:06 Nothing gets mirrored there
general 2020-08-28 03:22:25 And if blocks collide, well you can't place them down
general 2020-08-28 03:22:39 The game will just treat them as invalid if they somehow collide in the center
general 2020-08-28 03:23:03 Can't really merge two blocks, nor to cut off a block
general 2020-08-28 03:23:23 You need a rank
general 2020-08-28 03:24:14 Imagine Plane Crazy
general 2020-08-28 03:24:16 But Rasputin
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:26:23 Time for motor locking
general 2020-08-28 03:36:05 Chainsaw...
general 2020-08-28 03:36:08 Get a tread
general 2020-08-28 03:36:14 Attach cutters
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:37:01 Some progress within the prototype
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:37:33 It's just a motor locked large rocket engine and large jet engine
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:37:39 I give credit to Ren for the idea
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:37:42 In his F-14 Tomcat video
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:38:04 It's a simple but effective solution
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:38:26 brb lunch
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:38:32 I haven't ate breakfast yet
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:56:32 Trail afterburners?
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:56:48 Wait, those are only trails? <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:58:33 Well, if it works for you then it might work for me
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:59:01 Considering conveyor drives can be set to toggle
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 03:59:09 And trails are only toggleable anyways
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 04:00:35 I'll go implement them as the last piece
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 04:00:52 Once I got the motor locks ready, I should probably refine my plane too
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 04:01:46 I just noticed that plane literally only uses wedges for the flatter parts
general 2020-08-28 04:05:03 If Russia has Moskau and Rasputin, Africa has Waka Waka and Africa (by Toto), then what other songs would fit other countries?
general 2020-08-28 04:05:44 <@!546223347025969164> Okay let me rephrase that
general 2020-08-28 04:05:51 Which other meme songs would fit other countries
general 2020-08-28 06:22:06 <@!546223347025969164> Opera is based on Chromium though, the same source code Google Chrome uses
general 2020-08-28 06:25:07 Yes, Opera also has Opera GX
general 2020-08-28 06:25:26 With a RAM limiter
general 2020-08-28 06:25:56 Though isn't at least one of the reasons browsers consume a lot of RAM is because of security through sandboxing?
general 2020-08-28 06:26:01 Like virtual machine but for websites
general 2020-08-28 06:27:34 It has Opera's standard proxy, a GX Corner for news about games, CPU limiter and Twitch integration
general 2020-08-28 06:28:36 Still uses the same code from Chromium though, Blink browser engine and V8 for javascript
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 06:33:53 engines: yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 06:34:22 
general 2020-08-28 06:35:00 <#384021699466756107> I need more engines
general 2020-08-28 06:35:08 oh and room for a conveyor drive
general 2020-08-28 06:35:24 Motor locks are fun
general 2020-08-28 06:36:22 One is just a really fast and really expensive Volkswagen
general 2020-08-28 06:36:29 The other is BMW's cash cow
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 06:37:45 Haven't finished it yet and yet I'm still testing for speed
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 06:37:55 It reaches almost 700 without conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 06:38:04 Which isn't that bad
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 06:38:10 Could do better
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 06:39:39 I'll just see if it's roll is crappy or not
general 2020-08-28 06:40:48 <@!163143541160148992> Wait, both are British brands owned by the Germans
general 2020-08-28 06:41:17 Rolls-Royce and Bentley
general 2020-08-28 06:41:25 Bentley is a part of Volkswagen
general 2020-08-28 06:41:33 Rolls-Royce is a part oF BMW
general 2020-08-28 06:41:56 Volkswagen also did do a luxury car for the masses
general 2020-08-28 06:42:01 Volkswagen Phaeton
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 06:43:44 I misread that as a 1:3, like a ratio
general 2020-08-28 06:46:48 Regular day in PC

plane-crazy 2020-08-28 06:48:16 something trippy i found
general 2020-08-28 06:50:40 wat happened here
general 2020-08-28 06:52:05 World of Goo is nice
general 2020-08-28 06:52:13 Replayability though
general 2020-08-28 06:52:37 Unless it has a level editor, then it's really a one time experience
general 2020-08-28 06:53:09 Technically the truth
general 2020-08-28 07:00:09 I found a double wishbone that wants to break it's spine
general 2020-08-28 07:00:21 It has some extreme squat and dive
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:03:51 i need to see the chaos
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:04:05 oof full
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:05:37 Mine doesn't really lag
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:06:05 Even if I do have decent PC that lags when I play Minecraft with shaders
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:06:23 Mine's an AMD A7 with an HD6670
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:06:39 I mean to be fair I did turn off particles
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:06:47 And I only used one conv. drive
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:07:16 It's enough for me to reach speeds of over 2000
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:08:39 Lots of room for engines
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:09:06 I will use conveyor too
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:09:13 I always use conveyors
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:09:21 But I also want more non-afterburning speed too
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:10:27 Target for me would be to consistently get a speed of 700 without afterburners
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:11:59 Fine 1000 then
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:12:27 Just locc till there's no more rocket engines
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:13:40 This looks decent enough, I'm gonna cover up the engines with blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:14:21 Locked motors
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:14:39 Locked motors are a blessing for me
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:14:43 Alongside conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 07:15:44 Well, I gtg so y'all can explain it to them

general 2020-08-28 09:38:19 Because it was too much to handle
general 2020-08-28 09:38:27 So they delete
general 2020-08-28 09:39:02 What if I put a knife into yousuf? Does he become cake?
general 2020-08-28 09:39:16 Oof

general 2020-08-28 12:23:21 Let's make Pocari swear at you
general 2020-08-28 12:23:32 Imagine bottled swear words
general 2020-08-28 12:24:03 <@287779983445721088> Anchovy Sweat?
general 2020-08-28 12:24:24 Gives me gamer girl bath water vibes
general 2020-08-28 12:24:51 Just be glad it isn't gamer girl pee
general 2020-08-28 12:25:05 I heard a student say that
general 2020-08-28 12:25:10 Gamer girl pee
general 2020-08-28 12:25:55 Mig has a nostrill
general 2020-08-28 12:26:09 One giant mouth/nostrill
general 2020-08-28 12:26:30 Imagine birdstrikes tho
general 2020-08-28 12:26:47 Bloody fans, literally
general 2020-08-28 12:27:30 <@448505589983739914> **Succ**hoi
general 2020-08-28 12:28:29 Nose intakes are just giant birdstrike vacuums
general 2020-08-28 12:29:38 I have a way to make that more cursed <@615876745710534676>
general 2020-08-28 12:30:24 Involves aeromorphs and the V-word kink
general 2020-08-28 12:30:38 I'll let everyone go figure that out
general 2020-08-28 12:31:07 Am I gonna stop? Never

general 2020-08-28 13:08:04 
general 2020-08-28 13:08:07 The only reason I came here was for the free medals
general 2020-08-28 13:08:27 You people were right about this kind of avatar/character being common
general 2020-08-28 13:09:00 Any more orange and she'd be looking like an Annoying Orange
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:14:18 
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:14:19 
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:14:21 
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:14:21 
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:15:00 Yes, that
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:15:28 As you can see, I still need to keep building
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:15:38 Until I can do better
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:15:47 Well at least it works anyways
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:16:16 <@!437152336176087052> The  engine, I can solve that
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:16:30 Though it's gonna be heckin huge
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:16:55 Yes, they're just motor locked
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:16:58 From a motor lock tower
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:17:11 Well, if all I need is to increase size at least
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:17:35 It won't have contact with the motor lock tower, good
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:18:10 ***s a n d w i c h***
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:19:29 I mean, is an airbus a flying bus or a land plane?
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:20:20 So flying cars are just airplanes
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:20:27 No matter what anyone says
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:20:50 I'd like to see a future where everyone says plane instead of car
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:20:57 And that airliners are literally air buses
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:21:25 good
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:21:40 Well, my plane still not good enough
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:21:43 But at least it still works
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:25:31 Print Screen
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:25:42 Ah yes, Math <@!720891502108344360>
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:26:33 Your mask became bird
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:26:39 Mothman, birdman
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:29:50 So tiny tail and small engine
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:29:54 What else is wrong
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:30:36 Table
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:31:13 I am confused for I do not see any motor locks for the legs

general 2020-08-28 14:28:50 I find the Disney/Pixar style of aeromorphs to be more cursed than your usual aeromorph

general 2020-08-28 14:33:00 I already have one ban xp

plane-crazy 2020-08-28 14:33:28 locc
general 2020-08-28 14:33:50 I got banned for being the honker
general 2020-08-28 14:33:54 The big horn
general 2020-08-28 14:34:12 The beeping beeper
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 14:35:20 I still need to make a better plane
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 14:35:24 Because I did poob
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 14:35:47 I should stop being concerned over the air intakes
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 14:36:02 And just b u i l d
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 14:36:46 I'm bad at designing things
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 14:37:04 The technical stuff I'm decent
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 14:37:22 <@428948212225933312> Worship the orb

plane-crazy 2020-08-28 14:38:12 Honestly the best build I have probably would still be the B-1 Lancer I've built a while ago
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 14:41:10 I need more advice in building stuff
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 14:41:22 Because poob quality is me
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 22:58:53 I mean kids like to do things easy, don't they bee?
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 22:59:12 And what's easier than pet grinding simulator?
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 23:00:44 For large builds, that's fine
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 23:00:58 For small builds, still too generous
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 23:05:47 I dunno, maybe limit the amount of parachutes that can be opened in a given area
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 23:06:59 Let's say you have a blimp, the other side can open X amount of parachutes while the other can open X amount of parachutes at a time
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 23:07:48 Though eggdog is right, only cargo drops require that many parachutes
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 23:08:47 Knowing how ridiculous Plane Crazy players get, 20 seems enough
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 23:09:09 After that, despawn parachutes
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 23:09:50 <@363742162757877761> Sounds like verification that's like "I am not an unde"
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 23:11:02 Despawning parachutes when they land?
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 23:11:33 Collision with the map?
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 23:12:37 I think speed is how fast your bombs need to fall to explode
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 23:12:48 Not how fast they'll detonate
general 2020-08-28 23:15:40 Tbh Plane Crazy is the only game I play nowadays on Roblox
general 2020-08-28 23:15:54 It's good for a lazy person like me
general 2020-08-28 23:16:17 Like Minecraft, I can just be at my own pace
general 2020-08-28 23:17:04 I did the treads first
general 2020-08-28 23:17:15 Because suspension system
general 2020-08-28 23:18:13 But your name is beautiful
general 2020-08-28 23:18:30 "Several people is typing"
general 2020-08-28 23:20:10 Wheel tracks tracks are better than conveyor tracks
general 2020-08-28 23:20:40 They work, can go off-road and isn't cheap and lazy
general 2020-08-28 23:21:38 Motors though, they can summon krakens
general 2020-08-28 23:22:09 Is there a musk named Elon?
general 2020-08-28 23:22:26 Yes, they're for mini tanks
general 2020-08-28 23:22:55 Like really mini tanks
general 2020-08-28 23:23:12 Smaller than tankette size
general 2020-08-28 23:23:31 Tankettes are still obliged to use wheels
general 2020-08-28 23:23:46 Must see
general 2020-08-28 23:23:50 The Muscc
general 2020-08-28 23:23:54 Be big brain boi
general 2020-08-28 23:24:27 <@456238251204935690> Imagine if Elon Musk discovered the secret to living forever

general 2020-08-29 02:47:35 The actor for Black Panther died?
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 02:47:45 Shredders
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 02:47:57 Nothing can beat shredders
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 02:48:05 In terms of being annoying
general 2020-08-29 02:49:07 I am why do you think I have Dense in my username

plane-crazy 2020-08-29 02:50:34 <@!645128367611445248> Why does that sound like if tutorial planes had a baby with shredder bugs
general 2020-08-29 02:52:00 I wonder how this'll effect the MCU
general 2020-08-29 02:53:21 Wikipedia already updated his page
general 2020-08-29 02:53:33 If it's that fast, then it really is gonna blow up
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 02:54:39 <@!645128367611445248> I remember one guy who had a flying triangle (if I said stealth bomber then that would be an insult to a real stealth bomber)
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 02:54:47 Let's hope his plot sized blue triangle doesn't have cutters
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 02:54:58 It's a good thing it's slow as heck
general 2020-08-29 02:56:00 It sucks that there's also corona, a time where hospitals are likely full
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 02:56:34 I hope I never have to encounter those
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 02:58:24 Triangle, the classic noob shape if it isn't tutorial plane shaped
general 2020-08-29 03:37:45 <@!615876745710534676> Is that a gundam? (Sorry not really that familiar with it tbh, only played a game related to it)
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 04:09:11 Any advice I could do so that I can use wedges better?
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 04:09:21 Basically, how to make plane not ugly

general 2020-08-29 04:18:08 To the bot channel
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 04:19:01 I'm still learning how to make use of wedges
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 04:19:30 Because my plane still doesn't look that good
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 04:19:47 Needs to be more ***s m o o t h***
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 04:20:00 Not ***c h o n k y***
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 04:20:12 Building in this game is like peanut butter
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 04:20:18 It's either smooth or chonky
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 04:21:09 Imagine bomber, but it drops shredder bugs
general 2020-08-29 04:21:57 What if shredder bombers existed, where a plane just drops shredders
general 2020-08-29 04:22:52 That would be a nuke bomber

plane-crazy 2020-08-29 05:03:09 I mean you said it's sharp
general 2020-08-29 05:04:34 Is it good or bad to look at others' planes to observe their building techniques?
general 2020-08-29 05:05:26 good
general 2020-08-29 05:05:59 Because the way I use wedges on my planes, they still look a little crappy
general 2020-08-29 05:06:10 Better than what I did before, but still crap

general 2020-08-29 05:14:39 9/11 are one of those topics you don't joke about, no matter what
general 2020-08-29 05:14:57 Still risky
general 2020-08-29 05:15:07 Like it still has the general same idea
general 2020-08-29 05:15:18 Crash a plane with lives in it into a building

general 2020-08-29 05:21:40 <@456226577798135808> I mean being scalie still means you're in the furry fandom

general 2020-08-29 05:27:13 Kinda warmed my day last night when I heard the police and willing people donated resources and helped children in their education in areas that are remote here

general 2020-08-29 05:34:03 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan_MiG-29K#/media/File:MiG-29K_at_MAKS-2007_airshow_(altered).jpg See these lines dividing the cockpit
general 2020-08-29 05:34:09 How do I make that with trails
general 2020-08-29 05:34:19 Specifically how do I rotate trails
general 2020-08-29 05:34:31 Rotat e the traals
general 2020-08-29 05:37:26 I was about to say
general 2020-08-29 05:37:29 ***d o u b t***
general 2020-08-29 05:38:40 Someone used a runway with a launcher for a jet
general 2020-08-29 05:38:44 Should I include that?
general 2020-08-29 05:39:47 I just realized I could motor lock a half block wedge
general 2020-08-29 05:39:55 So I can divide the cockpit
general 2020-08-29 05:43:03 Is there anything on December 26?
general 2020-08-29 05:43:24 Stop giving me an existential crisis I'm gonna leave this chat
general 2020-08-29 05:44:31 Actually, thinking of it
general 2020-08-29 05:44:44 We all try to predict apocalypses
general 2020-08-29 05:44:51 Yet we always fail
general 2020-08-29 05:45:56 <@!456238251204935690> Please don't I don't wanna get an existential crisis/stay awake at night
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 05:51:40 HHH
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 06:08:19 
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 06:08:20 
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 06:08:25 Do these look less like crap?
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 06:09:30 Well, I'll attach the wings from there
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 06:09:37 ~~with the magic of locked motors(tm)~~
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 06:10:15 Like in the last plane I did?
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 06:10:34 <@!645128367611445248> https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/749126544978346095
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 06:10:53 The wings are literally made out of half wedges and half blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 06:11:14 With actual wings motor locked alongside control surfaces for extra roll
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 06:12:05 I used motor 2 flaps
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 06:12:21 The main wing also has motor 2 flaps
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 06:12:26 But it kinda was lacking
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 06:12:47 ~~eh Im sure nobody would notice it anyways unless they look closely~~
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 06:13:08 The transition of the wedges doesn't look smooth enough
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 06:16:05 Oh, I can also do that
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 06:17:27 But knowing how the final result of my planes end up looking, I'd probably stick to what I know for now in design
general 2020-08-29 06:23:31 I just realized something
general 2020-08-29 06:23:48 Y'all know that one episode of Phineas and Ferb where Candace became a giant?
general 2020-08-29 06:24:11 Well, what does she usually wear?
general 2020-08-29 06:24:53 What kind of shenanigans would giant girl + skirt would mean?
general 2020-08-29 06:25:10 Yeah... ***b a d***
general 2020-08-29 06:25:12 Yes let's stop
general 2020-08-29 06:25:27 After all those years, I just realized it now
general 2020-08-29 06:27:17 Let's call <@!551573378662662145> quiddengbros, like the British quid
general 2020-08-29 06:28:06 I see a Ford
general 2020-08-29 06:28:09 And I see a Fiat 500
general 2020-08-29 06:28:30 Let me zoom in
general 2020-08-29 06:28:41 wait it isn't
general 2020-08-29 06:28:48 *that's not a Fiat*
general 2020-08-29 06:29:10 I didn't saw the rest of the car
general 2020-08-29 06:29:40 Chonky, like a Smart Fortwo

Wasn't there a brand called Scion?
general 2020-08-29 06:30:00 Not a Scion
general 2020-08-29 06:30:06 Doesn't look like a Scion
general 2020-08-29 06:30:40 wait hold on
general 2020-08-29 06:30:58 God in Spanish is dios
general 2020-08-29 06:31:11 Similar spelling in Filipino, which the Spanish has influence in
general 2020-08-29 06:31:23 Due to being once a former Spanish colony

general 2020-08-29 06:32:23 Looks like a Smart ngl
general 2020-08-29 06:32:30 The first car
general 2020-08-29 06:33:06 The Smart Forfour is something Daimler owns
general 2020-08-29 06:33:16 So in turn it's a little related to Mercedes-Benz
general 2020-08-29 06:33:24 In the fact that they're owned by the same company
general 2020-08-29 06:36:18 hm yes budget mercedes
general 2020-08-29 06:36:32 All under the ownership of Daimler
general 2020-08-29 06:37:23 If they were still merged with Chrysler then I wonder if we would've had drag racing Mercedes-Benz(es) and ultra-luxurious Dodge(s)
general 2020-08-29 06:38:44 Huh, Daimler also has some ownership in KAMAZ, Freightliner, Detroit Diesel and Mitsubishi Fuso
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 06:39:45 man me a sand
general 2020-08-29 06:43:11 I regret reading something in <#495286269459300364>
general 2020-08-29 06:43:14 About *cheese*
general 2020-08-29 06:43:33 disgustang
general 2020-08-29 06:43:37 we didn't need to know that
general 2020-08-29 06:45:39 Seeing as it says wiki
general 2020-08-29 06:45:46 I'll check their respective Wikipedia pages
general 2020-08-29 06:46:36 Who'd win in sales. The tea-drinkers, the baguettes or the sasauges
general 2020-08-29 06:49:18 Citroen 2CV - 3.8 Million produced
BMC Mini - 5,387,862 sold
Volkswagen Beetle - 21,529,464 produced
general 2020-08-29 06:49:39 Keep in mind all of them ended production at different times
general 2020-08-29 06:50:24 The 2CV ended production in 1990, the Mini in 2000 and the Beetle in 2003
general 2020-08-29 06:50:28 All three of which barely had any updates
general 2020-08-29 06:50:35 Emphasis on barely
general 2020-08-29 06:50:53 The Mini in 2000 was about to be updated anyways by BMW
general 2020-08-29 06:51:14 The Beetle failed in modern times, just look at the New Beetle and it's sucessor
general 2020-08-29 06:51:22 And there's no need for the 2CV nowadays
general 2020-08-29 06:56:15 Imagine if Rick pulled a Mojang and instead of giving Map & Wedges he instead gives up something else
general 2020-08-29 06:56:39 Wait I mistyped
general 2020-08-29 06:57:11 Imagine if Rick gave us something else*
general 2020-08-29 06:57:19 Because I can
general 2020-08-29 06:57:47 I mean I don't have much to do atm
general 2020-08-29 06:58:09 Force me to do Python or finish other stuff
general 2020-08-29 06:59:16 Crinje139
general 2020-08-29 07:00:15 Ngl when I first saw Rick's name I thought it was spelt Rickjel39 instead of Rickje139
general 2020-08-29 07:00:57 When Rick Astley gives back the formula to rick
general 2020-08-29 07:01:20 That's why Rick Astley's hair looks nice

general 2020-08-29 07:03:38 Did Sukhoi made any planes with nose inlets
general 2020-08-29 07:03:49 Asking so that I can call them Succhoi
general 2020-08-29 07:05:50 What plane is that, Succhoi Su-??
general 2020-08-29 07:06:57 I might build that just so I can submit and say ***Succhoi***
general 2020-08-29 07:08:17 Hmm yes choices
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 10:39:34 A quick picture of what I have in progress
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 10:40:27 For now I'm at a stage where I'm just developing the general shape of the plane
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 10:40:29 And thanks
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 10:41:28 ~~The fatherland may not be happy I may have looked up images of the motherland's toys~~
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 11:13:10 <@512467907469377539> I may or may not have looked up images of various Sukhoi and Mikoyan aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 11:14:28 That looks a lot like a tutorial UFO
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 11:14:50 I think I've seen that before

plane-crazy 2020-08-29 11:26:28 https://youtu.be/lkoZP2OLbi0 I knew it was a tutorial

plane-crazy 2020-08-30 04:10:54 It's all coming together
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 04:11:42 That's a lot of empty space to cram super rocket engines into, and still more room for wings if needed
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 04:13:04 
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 04:13:06 
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 04:13:32 I looked up images of Russian fighter jets
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 04:13:47 because my poob brain does not want to do the effort of building the F-22
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 04:15:00 I could still probably try doing better tbh
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 04:15:56 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 04:15:57 thanks
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 06:34:44 I am now procrastinating
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 06:34:55 I am now making four banger in VIP1
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 06:36:53 I'll make the cylinder walls out of ice and pretend there's engine oil
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 06:48:34 nvm
general 2020-08-30 06:52:30 https://streamable.com/00vw3x How is there solid collision?
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 06:54:19 Something still feels missing on my fighter (apart from the engines)
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 06:54:25 But I just can't point out what it is
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 06:57:38 Let's see what I can add onto the motor lock tower...
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 06:59:39 Drogue parachute, wings, air brake?, weapons, motor lock bombs/missiles...
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 06:59:47 Do air brakes work in this game?
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:01:13 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/F-15_Eagle_landing_with_the_speed_brake_up.jpg
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:01:17 Hmm
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:03:53 Only the Sukhoi Su-30 has air brakes
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:04:28 I know, but I was referring to if any Russian fighters have air brakes
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:04:48 I probably should've clarified
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:05:59 ew a shredder
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:21:10 A four wheeled hover bike...
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:21:14 That isn't even a bike
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:23:23 Ultra fast shredder?
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:23:35 oh good
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:23:49 Unless said missile is guided too
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:24:34 Well, if shredders were bad enough
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:24:41 We also have ultra fast guided missiles
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:25:10 Shredders are worse
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:25:39 Well, I'll just add a conveyor drive to the locc tower
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:34:37 Are parachutes buggy?
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:34:46 If yes then no drogue parachute then
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:40:19 ***yes.***
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:44:41 I need more rocket arrays
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:44:50 670 is not enough
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:45:12 crap I jammed my air brake
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:47:42 <@!645128367611445248> But is there room for a controlled hover engine? Because most of the body literally is just 1 block thick
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:48:49 Like how do I stop it when I don't need any thrust
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:49:27 O h
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:49:37 Are they faster than rocket engines?
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:49:48 If yes then abandon friendship with rocket engines
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:49:57 Hover engines will be my new friend
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 07:50:32 Looks like I don't need the rocket array after all
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 08:33:52 What if you press Tab

general 2020-08-30 12:26:53 <@244667801824919553> We are flex tape, you are flex ship
general 2020-08-30 12:27:31 I tried making gears once, friction based fabric cylinders work better for me
general 2020-08-30 12:28:22 I wonder if I should continue my inline 4 engine, and put a transmission below it
general 2020-08-30 12:28:59 Is it worth it to make a full car platform? With...

- Engine 
- Transmission 
- Differential
general 2020-08-30 12:29:23 I mean, I've made a bus and lots of planes
general 2020-08-30 12:29:31 I wanna do something stupid
general 2020-08-30 12:29:46 Roblox here in Asia works fine
general 2020-08-30 12:30:19 No, this game didn't broke Roblox
general 2020-08-30 12:30:25 It's the other way around
general 2020-08-30 12:30:56 Screw ir
general 2020-08-30 12:31:09 I'll go make a car platform tomorrow for because why not
general 2020-08-30 12:31:54 <@419873641229189120> Roblox in Asia works fine
general 2020-08-30 12:32:29 <@419873641229189120> How 'bout no? I can have my own opinion
general 2020-08-30 12:33:16 I mean, still accesses the same server
general 2020-08-30 12:33:40 Whether it's the one from the Microsoft Store or from the site itself
general 2020-08-30 12:34:02 Yes, set a VPN to access Asian servers
the-dump 2020-08-30 12:35:11 Anime Rick
the-dump 2020-08-30 12:35:40 ~~imagine if this is an actual AU rick~~
general 2020-08-30 12:36:35 <@419873641229189120> Just search it up, how to change region for ??? VPN
general 2020-08-30 12:37:00 Jeticopter
general 2020-08-30 12:54:30 You know what comes after CD? It's not DVD
general 2020-08-30 12:55:02 <@451025784228806656> That bunny is just pure fluff
general 2020-08-30 12:55:07 It's a bunny sheep
general 2020-08-30 12:55:31 Are you on mobile suf?
general 2020-08-30 12:55:58 I'm still playing PC in Asia
general 2020-08-30 12:56:06 Is this a thing in the US?
general 2020-08-30 12:56:31 Well
general 2020-08-30 12:56:43 My brother's still playing Roblox
general 2020-08-30 12:56:51 And I live in the Philippines
general 2020-08-30 12:56:58 Right here in S.E Asia
general 2020-08-30 12:57:21 no, you did not hire me
general 2020-08-30 12:58:02 <@444476246899032086> Oh I thought you were referring to how many Overseas Filipino Workers there are
general 2020-08-30 12:58:21 But sir, you did not hire me
general 2020-08-30 12:58:29 But out of my kindness, I will make sammich
general 2020-08-30 12:58:58 *makes a sandwich from the production line, AKA the kitchen*
general 2020-08-30 12:59:07 *force feeds <@444476246899032086>*
general 2020-08-30 12:59:27 Oh ok
general 2020-08-30 12:59:33 Understandable, have a nice day
general 2020-08-30 12:59:53 <@419873641229189120> I got myself DDRace Network on Steam
general 2020-08-30 13:00:11 If you're into platformers/casual games
general 2020-08-30 13:00:27 Well, casual for the novice levels anyways
general 2020-08-30 13:00:40 Just search it up, and not even a GB
general 2020-08-30 13:00:50 It's smol
general 2020-08-30 13:01:09 It is smol
general 2020-08-30 13:01:26 It's multiplayer only tho
general 2020-08-30 13:01:34 so oof
general 2020-08-30 13:01:54 Well, you can just connect to a random server in the game
general 2020-08-30 13:02:10 But it's also possible to make private server too
general 2020-08-30 13:02:14 Or play local
general 2020-08-30 13:02:22 Local multiplayer
general 2020-08-30 13:02:47 Imagine if Roblox compensated us with bobux
general 2020-08-30 13:03:10 <@310863132727836672> Ye' sound like a pie rat
general 2020-08-30 13:03:14 But I was wrong
general 2020-08-30 13:03:43 I shall hope Roblox gives us bobux
general 2020-08-30 13:03:53 As compensation
general 2020-08-30 13:03:56 For downtime
general 2020-08-30 13:04:08 But that's just extremely wishful thinking
general 2020-08-30 13:04:33 My ass can only afford free
general 2020-08-30 13:04:53 <@419873641229189120> There are areas in the game where it freezes you
general 2020-08-30 13:05:08 Basically, become black
general 2020-08-30 13:05:28 All you can do is shout up until someone pulls you out or you respawn
general 2020-08-30 13:05:31 By pressing K
general 2020-08-30 13:11:56 <@419873641229189120> Right click to use grapple, left click to use weapon, scroll wheel to change weapon
general 2020-08-30 13:12:03 Hammer can be used to push stuff
general 2020-08-30 13:12:08 Oof
general 2020-08-30 13:14:16 My phone lied to me
general 2020-08-30 13:14:32 Just a few minutes ago it said it's at 15%
general 2020-08-30 13:14:43 Suddenly restarted and its at 2%
general 2020-08-30 13:14:52 So now I'm charging it
general 2020-08-30 13:15:35 <@437152336176087052> The toxic undes? A learning curve that may frustrated undes?
general 2020-08-30 13:16:07 Speaking of undes
general 2020-08-30 13:16:24 Why is the potential for a good fandom ruined by undes
general 2020-08-30 13:16:44 Refer to the mess that is the Undertake and FNaF fandom
general 2020-08-30 13:16:53 Undertale*
general 2020-08-30 13:17:34 Well, if it ain't full of weird stuff and has at least some people being people well I find it good enough
general 2020-08-30 13:18:04 Undertale and FNaF has weird kids
general 2020-08-30 13:26:32 <@437152336176087052> So make a weaponized beyblade?
general 2020-08-30 13:26:55 Also, what happens if a shredder perfectly collides with another shredder head-on?
general 2020-08-30 13:27:12 <@433617207734304778> So parachute spam and magnet spam?
general 2020-08-30 13:27:46 I need to make plane better
general 2020-08-30 13:28:05 PCBLike said my plane too wide, and engines too close to wings
general 2020-08-30 13:28:11 So I need to do that
general 2020-08-30 13:33:57 <@433617207734304778> Because I've built a 3 fold airliner with 3 fold wings, powered almost exclusively by a conveyor drive and no form of cheating for controls, just custom control surfaces
general 2020-08-30 13:34:36 Which I deleted because it's boxy, save storage issues and doesn't fly sharp
general 2020-08-30 13:34:45 But still meets the criteria for expert though
general 2020-08-30 13:36:07 <@437152336176087052> Does it have wheel camber though?
general 2020-08-30 13:37:26 <@448505589983739914> It should, it looks like it had one of those flower straws for wheels with a body that's even more polarizing than the Fiat Multipla/Tesla Cybertruck
general 2020-08-30 13:38:00 Wheel become triangle
general 2020-08-30 13:38:28 So, it turns from cylindrical to rounded triangle
general 2020-08-30 13:39:08 <@437152336176087052> Probably capitalist land not wanting to spend so much money after blowing it all on two fighters
general 2020-08-30 13:39:28 F-22 and F-35
general 2020-08-30 13:39:48 The F-22 is a stealth fighter, a very expensive stealth fighter
general 2020-08-30 13:40:08 The F-35 is a mess
general 2020-08-30 13:40:44 F-35 looks like they screwed up the F-16
general 2020-08-30 13:40:52 By trying to make it better than the F-22
general 2020-08-30 13:41:21 There are keyboards that use magnets and lasers
general 2020-08-30 13:41:57 <@437152336176087052> Off-roading Greek supercwr
general 2020-08-30 13:42:24 Looks like a stubby Porsche to me <@433617207734304778>
general 2020-08-30 13:42:49 I mean, we already have an off-roading coupe
general 2020-08-30 13:42:57 In the form of the Local Motors Rally Fighter
general 2020-08-30 13:43:06 Designed for off-roading
general 2020-08-30 13:43:25 It's a coupe, that actually goes off-roaf
general 2020-08-30 13:44:11 <@448505589983739914> That's like giving a Land Rover a supercar engine (which they can through sibling company Jaguar)
general 2020-08-30 13:44:28 Land Rovers have some thin tires
general 2020-08-30 13:45:00 <@456226577798135808> Yes
general 2020-08-30 13:45:43 The Bowler Nemesis is just an endurance racing Land Rover with a Jaguar engine
general 2020-08-30 13:46:22 <@437152336176087052> Search up the Ariel Atom 500 V8
general 2020-08-30 13:46:48 Weight reduction taken to the max, with a V8 made from two sport bike V4s
general 2020-08-30 13:47:17 Makes up to 500 horsepower, with nearly 500 kg of weight
general 2020-08-30 13:47:41 Imagine slapping a Gemera engine onto the Atom
general 2020-08-30 13:48:08 The Gemera has an Inline 3 with 600 HP
general 2020-08-30 13:48:21 With electric motors that boost it to over 1000
general 2020-08-30 13:48:32 Four wheel drive electric motors
general 2020-08-30 13:49:05 <@448505589983739914> Imagine the Ariel Atom but with the Gemera's tech
general 2020-08-30 13:49:24 Sure it may be a little bit heavier, but that's absurdity taken to the extreme
general 2020-08-30 13:49:55 Also, a lot of VW supercars use 4WD <@448505589983739914>
general 2020-08-30 13:49:59 Like Lamborghini
general 2020-08-30 13:51:28 <@437152336176087052> Hmm, didn't Chrysler/General Motors once had an era where they slapped turbines onto cars?
general 2020-08-30 13:52:01 I remember Pontiac in specific was the brand they tested those turbine engines
general 2020-08-30 13:53:04 <@437152336176087052> Well, at least you have a valid reason to slap some jet engines onto a car
general 2020-08-30 13:54:01 ***We need Adopt Me to distract the undies from playing Plane Crazy***
general 2020-08-30 13:54:39 Did I just call undes undies?
general 2020-08-30 13:54:43 As in underwear
general 2020-08-30 13:55:08 Let's send to the washing machine
general 2020-08-30 13:55:30 Torment undies with gas
general 2020-08-30 13:55:39 Wait
general 2020-08-30 13:55:49 I just realized that could mean something else
general 2020-08-30 13:56:19 There are bosozoku scooters
general 2020-08-30 13:57:29 <@437152336176087052> Try searching up bosozoku scooters
general 2020-08-30 13:58:14 Also, I swear my phone wants to autocorrect into bosozoku into Jeff Bezos
general 2020-08-30 13:59:43 We need Chaos Control
general 2020-08-30 13:59:57 The mods live in the Chaos Control Center
general 2020-08-30 14:00:25 **Its Pickie Rickie**
general 2020-08-30 14:00:36 ***O h***
general 2020-08-30 14:00:49 well i can't browse my friends' posts
general 2020-08-30 14:00:57 ~~totally not furry content~~
general 2020-08-30 14:01:21 <@456226577798135808> Because it keeps the undes distracted
general 2020-08-30 14:01:40 My keyboard keeps autocorrecting undes into undies
general 2020-08-30 14:01:54 My Internet is fine
general 2020-08-30 14:02:32 Roblox, upgrade server
general 2020-08-30 14:02:39 Or upgrade your software
general 2020-08-30 14:03:03 Roblox upgrade your servers and software
general 2020-08-30 14:03:13 oh oof
general 2020-08-30 14:03:27 Hello Henry <@402617794606399488>
general 2020-08-30 14:04:25 <@448505589983739914> Is there an event that's forcing the Internet into depression, hence the slowness and servers being ded
general 2020-08-30 14:04:51 I remember doing inspect element
general 2020-08-30 14:05:00 So I can make Rick say UWU
general 2020-08-30 14:05:07 As Pickie Rickie
general 2020-08-30 14:05:30 <@402617794606399488> I thought that was both in the furry fandom and in anime too
general 2020-08-30 14:05:36 Wait what
general 2020-08-30 14:06:29 <@437152336176087052> yes he did, in three instances
general 2020-08-30 14:06:53 Question is, is it anime owo uwu or furry owo uwu?
general 2020-08-30 14:07:24 Let's make a Ricksona
general 2020-08-30 14:07:38 <@335599526414909451> pls no, i beg of you
general 2020-08-30 14:07:48 We'll behave
general 2020-08-30 14:08:10 <@456226577798135808> 👀
general 2020-08-30 14:08:48 I'm fine with one expert rank
general 2020-08-30 14:09:05 <@297019145084469248> The Forza server once did 6 hours.
general 2020-08-30 14:09:32 Yes, at least according to a Forza YouTuber
general 2020-08-30 14:09:43 Who got banned for having the flag of the rising sun
general 2020-08-30 14:09:55 And the YouTube community getting banned
general 2020-08-30 14:10:02 Mass banned
general 2020-08-30 14:10:21 Even mentioning banned warns you, and saying bannned bans you
general 2020-08-30 14:10:39 Bssically, Turn 10 corruption
general 2020-08-30 14:11:03 Turn 10 only it seems, as Mojang doesn't have any problems
general 2020-08-30 14:11:29 FE? Fire Emblem?
general 2020-08-30 14:11:44 Or whatever the name of that game is
general 2020-08-30 14:12:53 What do you all think of the Alfa Romeo 4C?
general 2020-08-30 14:13:09 It's made out of carbon fiber, and is ultralight
general 2020-08-30 14:13:28 But has an inline 4 that barely reaches 300 HP
general 2020-08-30 14:14:01 If only you could report
general 2020-08-30 14:14:14 There is a site for scripts
general 2020-08-30 14:14:47 <@448505589983739914> I love how my phone lagged so it read "Police Ass"
general 2020-08-30 14:31:07 Wait how is my brother playing Roblox
general 2020-08-30 14:31:27 Also, I might play Theme Park Tycoon 2 because casual capitalism
general 2020-08-30 14:34:59 Yummy piss
general 2020-08-30 14:35:20 "Gladsaxe"
general 2020-08-30 14:35:27 Is that you GLaDOS
general 2020-08-30 14:35:58 That Czechoslovakian plane sounded interesting
general 2020-08-30 14:36:34 Do you live in one of those Scandanavian/Nordic countries?
general 2020-08-30 14:37:08 <@456226577798135808> I see your country owns Greenland
general 2020-08-30 14:37:30 Explain?
general 2020-08-30 14:39:07 I remember when the US wanted some of that Green ass
general 2020-08-30 14:39:48 Why does Green ass made me think of the Hulk
general 2020-08-30 14:41:03 <@444476246899032086> If you're that desparate then get a mask, maybe even a face shield
general 2020-08-30 14:41:15 Donuts be nice tho
general 2020-08-30 14:41:23 Mmm, donuts
general 2020-08-30 14:41:26 Speaking of food
general 2020-08-30 14:41:38 It's my dad's birthday soon so we get free pizza
general 2020-08-30 14:41:56 Mmm, ***c h e e z y***
general 2020-08-30 14:42:36 <@456226577798135808> We don't have a small case of Covid here though, and kinda hard when your literal neighbor is China right up the North
general 2020-08-30 14:43:14 May I call yousuf
general 2020-08-30 14:43:15 Suf
general 2020-08-30 14:43:29 Because laziness
general 2020-08-30 14:43:55 <@402617794606399488> Gotta make that money like Henry
general 2020-08-30 14:44:13 ~~He's in constant fear of getting kicked out of his apartment~~
general 2020-08-30 14:44:29 Don't worry, the diamond paid for it
general 2020-08-30 14:45:04 I mean, I'm playing Roblox on a TV
general 2020-08-30 14:45:23 Is there any software alternatives for Lego Technic?
general 2020-08-30 14:45:41 So I can play around with mechanical stuff
general 2020-08-30 14:46:38 Oof, I just wanna do mechanical stuff
general 2020-08-30 14:47:04 *sad noises*
general 2020-08-30 14:47:17 I mean I just wanna play out with mechanical stuff in general
general 2020-08-30 14:47:32 If I want virtual Lego then I have Minecraft for that
general 2020-08-30 14:48:01 Yeah, that
general 2020-08-30 14:48:17 ~~Jusr let me play with gears~~
general 2020-08-30 14:49:18 The smallest scale block we have are quarter wedges
general 2020-08-30 14:49:29 I'm not gonna call them half wedges
general 2020-08-30 14:49:53 My parents came up with the excuse of "you're not gonna play it"
general 2020-08-30 14:50:04 Like I may not be an architect
general 2020-08-30 14:50:32 But I've always wanted to be a mechanical engineer tbh
general 2020-08-30 14:51:32 I'll go relax to some Business Blaze
general 2020-08-30 14:51:52 Where a bald British man loses his sanity while being educational
general 2020-08-30 14:52:00 What is that map?
general 2020-08-30 14:52:38 Check down detector for the Philippines
general 2020-08-30 14:52:47 because I'm on a phone
general 2020-08-30 14:52:57 That very old
general 2020-08-30 14:53:09 A Galaxy S5
general 2020-08-30 14:55:33 Well, no down
general 2020-08-30 14:55:41 Apart from Manila
general 2020-08-30 14:55:50 But it's just pretty minor
general 2020-08-30 14:56:00 We're just South of China
general 2020-08-30 14:56:20 I live in a group of islands
general 2020-08-30 14:56:58 The tropics are nice, when it isn't raining
general 2020-08-30 14:57:11 And boy can it rain hard here
general 2020-08-30 14:57:54 Like a weak little typhoon at this point is just business casual for me, considering Haiyan/Yolanda happened not too long ago
general 2020-08-30 14:58:57 Oh, well it doesn't feel that far off in my lifetime
general 2020-08-30 14:59:32 My perception of time must be messed up then
general 2020-08-30 15:00:36 Anyways, to the Red Land of Demonitized Content Creators
general 2020-08-30 15:00:51 The not Communist land of videos
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 15:17:53 https://youtu.be/YmKrzntYzuQ I gotta do this in Plane Crazy, my friend has the house so now I just need the Raptor
general 2020-08-30 15:18:44 <@546223347025969164> Because red is the color of communism
general 2020-08-30 15:19:18 And it is meme to me
general 2020-08-30 15:19:24 A milked meme
general 2020-08-31 01:01:09 https://youtu.be/Sik_gQ-tHHc Is this *the* Rick Astley
general 2020-08-31 01:01:28 I found it randomly while browsing on YouTube
general 2020-08-31 01:01:41 Is this his actual YT?
the-dump 2020-08-31 01:03:53 https://youtu.be/x-SZYwc7fWs
the-dump 2020-08-31 01:04:16 Look at the intro without context
general 2020-08-31 01:05:01 I have sent something in the dump
general 2020-08-31 01:06:07 <@710208141144489995> Add 1x2 wings on the armrests, with control surfaces behind the wings. Add a rudder behind the chair with a reverse thrust propeller
general 2020-08-31 01:06:20 The rudder being a control surface
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 01:07:32 <@456226577798135808> The Wizard of Bikini Bottom
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 01:08:17 Ngl that's a pretty neat build though, the Krusty Krab
general 2020-08-31 01:09:55 Oh wait, I forgot to mention
general 2020-08-31 01:10:12 The thing I said literally is just a chair with those wings
general 2020-08-31 01:10:18 And control surfaces
general 2020-08-31 01:10:27 With a reverse thrust propeller
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:18:02 I'm losing speed when I adjust pitch
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:18:04 Why does that happen
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:19:04 Well, there is one thing I could think of doing with it though
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:19:10 Pugachev's Cobra
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:20:14 Well, in my case I lose speed to the point where there's almost nothing
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:20:57 Well, I don't know how I'll add that tbh
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:21:15 Though in my older design it doesn't lose speed to the point where it's concerning
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:21:22 Like it just gets halved
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:21:33 Somewhere around 300ish
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:21:43 In my newer design, speed go bye bye
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:28:24 You have become just a bunch of polygons
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:28:36 The most basic form you can take before becoming code
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:29:12 <@!213233227979161601> If only I hadn't motor locked the engines
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:51:41 Why did I just forgot air brakes were supposed to slow the plane down
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:51:45 Not make it faster
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:55:27 Don't you just hate it when they suddenly ride like they're your friend
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:55:47 Like in my mind, "Sir you aren't my friend, nor did I invite you"
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:56:34 What if Roblox servers actually divide teens and above, and undes
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:58:23 ***o h   n o***
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:58:49 Let's not
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 02:59:17 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn_Buccaneer I found this plane, it got my attention
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:00:10 There is another Harrier
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:00:13 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Aerospace_Sea_Harrier
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:00:38 How many planes are named Harrier?
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:01:38 There's also the US Harrier
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:01:42 That also goes VTOL
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:01:57 When I think of Harrier jet, I think of the one made by the US
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:02:04 The subsonic VTOL plane
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:02:43 Hmm, Africa operated the Bucaneer up until the 90s
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:03:06 <@!213233227979161601> Damn that's a thicc intake
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:03:37 That;s bit a tank
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:03:50 That's a "truck"
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:04:00 With a tumor on top of it
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:04:23 <@!213233227979161601> Guess karma bit them in the arse, just look at the political disaster behind the F-35
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:04:38 It be chonky box intakes
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:05:17 The Mig-31 has even chonkier box intakes
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:05:44 How chonky do the Soviets' air intakes get?
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:07:13 Maybe just search Tu-22
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:08:49 oof
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:09:03 I wonder which plane has the chonkiest air intakes

plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:19:02 <@!213233227979161601> What happened to that plane
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:19:08 Why is there motors in front of it
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:20:06 The canopy?
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:20:28 Mmm sharp
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:20:34 That be one sharp nose tho
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:21:04 Well, not the best but you got it sharp
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:22:21 I'm already trying out a different building style

plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:34:22 I should probably try to make my aircraft look more accurate to the Sukhoi Su-27 (and it's variants) now
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:34:32 Considering since I'm already basing an aircraft on it
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:35:52 I should probably focus on the Sukhoi Su-30 though, considering it's the only Su-27 based fighter with an air brake
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 03:39:18 Okay, good night (even though it's morning for me xp)
general 2020-08-31 03:48:09 Mongolia was once Genghis Khanland

general 2020-08-31 03:50:43 We were always fools
general 2020-08-31 03:50:57 Okay, adios
general 2020-08-31 03:51:47 I must focus my efforts into making any fighter in the Sukhoi Su-27 family of fighters
general 2020-08-31 03:52:38 I mean, if I had an alt then I wouldn't name it after myself
general 2020-08-31 03:52:48 So I believe jojo
general 2020-08-31 03:53:34 <@551573378662662145> **No, I'll send it here right here and right now** (don't worry purified it's SFW)

general 2020-08-31 03:54:50 Yes, I see your point
general 2020-08-31 03:57:23 I just think it's a fake, because naming an alt after yourself would be pontless
general 2020-08-31 03:57:47 Oof

plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:02:07 <@456226577798135808> Is it right for me to get bothered by the fact that Raptor doesn't really have any delta wings
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:03:09 Just give me how crap works, a collection of builds and I'll be fine
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:04:36 I already have Ren and Proto for showing me in-game mechanics, <#384025409945337856>, <#504436696021204992> and <#478584971670454284> for the collection of builds and the methods y'all use

plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:09:25 Which tutorial is the only one that's close to accurate?
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:09:42 Then that probably means none
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:10:00 I mean it you wanted accurate then motor locks are the answer
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:10:21 What did you do?
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:10:42 Blueprints are good
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:10:46 Also 3D models
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:11:06 Blueprints and 3D models help
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:11:10 ok
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:11:25 as long as I have a reference, then I'm fine
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:11:48 All I used for reference for my recent plane are Wikipedia images xp
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:12:17 Actually
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:12:25 I shouldn't use Wikipedia only
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:12:47 Because it's all under Wikimedia anyways
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:13:04 Why stick to a pedia when I can view media
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:13:50 I'll just stick with Wikimedia for now
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:14:06 It's free and at least I'm more sure they got things right
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:14:27 It's not the most accurate source of info, but still accuracy assured
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:14:45 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:14:50 More angles the better too
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:15:31 <@213233227979161601> I mean, to be fair there has been a lot of aircraft based on the Su-27
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:15:52 Mostly just some variations though
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:16:01 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:16:16 They're just evolutions of the Su-27
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:16:37 ***And then there's that Chinese cousin of the Su-27***
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:17:30 What about the J-11? What gun is it
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:18:40 Early Sukhoi definitely deserve the name Sukhoi
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:18:55 Because they have the ***s u c c*** nose

general 2020-08-31 04:22:28 Uranus best planet
general 2020-08-31 04:22:42 Because it has anus in it xp
general 2020-08-31 04:23:16 Uranus is tilted almost 90 degrees, isn't it?
general 2020-08-31 04:23:44 Now I remembered this vid where this kid says "Dad, where's my anus?"
general 2020-08-31 04:24:05 Like he was teaching this kid about Uranus saying "There's Uranus"
general 2020-08-31 04:24:28 Then this kid asks it
general 2020-08-31 04:24:48 How many undes have said "my anus" instead of Uranus
general 2020-08-31 04:56:10 Wait I thought lizards are what keep insects out of the house
general 2020-08-31 04:56:27 Ah I see
general 2020-08-31 04:56:53 Keep some so that it won't turn into an insect fedt

plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:55:52 I actually looked up the Flanker family of Sukhois
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 05:56:07 I'm already doing it so I thought of well just going with it
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:12:36 anyone who needs to make lol needlessly long is cringe
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:13:05 Were you
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:13:08 doing exactly that?
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:16:40 no
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:18:23 I feel like I could just modify my existing airframe and call it a Flanker
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:19:01 Yes, all I need to do is to modify a little
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:19:08 First of all, my plane is a bit too wide
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:20:03 Could do some modifications relating to the engines, make the delta cropped because rn I just realized ti does look a little bit like the F-15 Eagle wings
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:20:21 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Sukhoi_Su-27SKM_at_MAKS-2005_airshow.jpg Not sure about this midsection though
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:20:29 Like see that little bump in the middle
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:20:50 Starting from the cockpit all the way to the tail
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:21:38 Probably better to not mind that, can't figure out a way to make it blend in without looking like an eyesore
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:21:50 Sukhoi Su-27?
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:22:44 I'm guessing it's not in the server, because when I searched I saw Su-35CM
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:22:54 It's still the same family though
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:25:06 Upvoted
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:29:25 Hmm, I could do a little curvature, from 1x2 to 1x3
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:30:36 Oh I was thinking of what adjustments to make so I can make my current plane look more like a flanker
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:30:44 Good thing I still saved the airframe

general 2020-08-31 06:41:41 I just remembered something, wasn't there a plane with "Ebola Gay" painted on it?
general 2020-08-31 06:42:03 What did it meant though
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:42:27 How do I use trails to make this part of the canopy https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/sukhojj-su-27.png
general 2020-08-31 06:42:39 O h
general 2020-08-31 06:43:44 anna mae skins
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:43:55 Trails, because half block wedge be thicc
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:44:09 I wanna use rotated trails for the sides
general 2020-08-31 06:44:26 Why does it have to be that long?
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:44:41 Oh the side of the canopy
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:44:51 See those two lines
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:45:09 It probably isn't worth it
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:45:23 Probably shouldn't obsess over little things too much then
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:45:53 They're both in the Flanker family though
general 2020-08-31 06:47:25 Will the mods  warn me if I keep referring to Russian planes as "The Motherland's Toys"
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:55:29 Latest build went to 6000 pretty fine, even if there was slight pitching issues
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:56:46 <@!645128367611445248> What do you consider to be good speed while being controllable?
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:56:53 Like in a fighter
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:58:25 Well, that can easily be achieved
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 06:58:45 Conveyor drives are great
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 07:01:58 I took a closer look at the Flanker cockpit, I did it wrong so another thing to add to the revision

creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:08:26 Yes
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:08:52 Doesn't sound like it's gonna be hard to add in the motor lock tower
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:10:51 yes that
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:12:02 All I could do is raise an eyebrow in confusion
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:12:05 But I've seen worse
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:12:19 I still remember when I downvoted something worse
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:12:28 And then the owner DM'd
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:12:33 "why you downvote me bro?"
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:12:46 I mean dude it's a blocky-ass low effort dart you call a German plane
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:12:56 No not you
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:13:16 Also, who uses canards as the main wing
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:14:03 Yes, he literally made his main wing look like a canard

creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:15:07 This bothers me on many levels
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:15:40 Like it bothers my sense of design
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:15:48 It bothers my sense of aeronautics
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:15:58 It just bothers me in general
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:16:04 ~~also that nose be really small~~
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:16:39 If you wanna screenshot it, use anchored blocks so that you can get a good shot
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:16:46 That's what I do, makes life so much easier
creations-chat 2020-08-31 07:17:01 I upvoted that

plane-crazy 2020-08-31 08:26:27 <@370594904268734464> Were you serious about that Yousuf?
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 08:27:17 Uh oh, it seems my phone is popping out a little
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 08:27:39 Well, there goes the waterproofing the Galaxy S5 promised

plane-crazy 2020-08-31 08:28:52 Bomb go boom
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 08:29:17 Give me context behind the Palestinian thing
general 2020-08-31 08:30:01 Did fulvia just say OwO?
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 08:31:12 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 08:33:33 Why is the Middle East chaos
general 2020-08-31 08:59:43 The only reason I joined drag's server
general 2020-08-31 08:59:46 was for the free vip server
general 2020-08-31 09:00:48 <@!723419054114865202> wait what, who?
general 2020-08-31 09:01:05 No seriously, who?
general 2020-08-31 09:01:18 Whose server?
general 2020-08-31 09:01:34 Oh
general 2020-08-31 09:01:36 Not surprising
general 2020-08-31 09:03:04 Consult a doctor for real results, not exaggerations
general 2020-08-31 09:03:10 oh hi lime
general 2020-08-31 09:03:38 You can show off being the emperor of Japan in <#384025409945337856>, get a designer role and join me in VIP
general 2020-08-31 09:04:15 Stress, what every human being experiences
general 2020-08-31 09:04:49 Stress is literally normal, it only becomes abnormal like say a more extreme case of bullying
general 2020-08-31 09:05:18 "Fast heartbeat"
general 2020-08-31 09:05:46 You can swear, but don't use slurs and the likes
general 2020-08-31 09:06:03 A fast heartbeat due to stress such as fear, anxiety, stuff like that
general 2020-08-31 09:06:05 That's normal
general 2020-08-31 09:06:28 But if it's fast because of an abnormality, well you definitely need to consult a doctor
general 2020-08-31 09:07:11 <@!562612137474916353> Show off your build, let it get upvotes, request for a <#609442446249820211>  (the designer rank should work) then you get access to the server's official VIP servers
general 2020-08-31 09:07:53 the big oof
general 2020-08-31 09:08:40 What about warn 2?
general 2020-08-31 09:08:52 Hmm, how is it 3 warns if it's only for pinging
general 2020-08-31 09:10:05 I am a poobrain furry fren
general 2020-08-31 09:10:25 Yes, thanks for knowing my existence
general 2020-08-31 09:18:12 Let's just agree that a month is 30 days in general
general 2020-08-31 09:18:37 <@!370594904268734464> Yousuf, can any rank qualify for VIP access?
general 2020-08-31 09:19:02 I don't have contest winner
general 2020-08-31 09:19:06 Only expert aero engineer
general 2020-08-31 09:19:09 And some other ranks
general 2020-08-31 09:19:29 Oh
general 2020-08-31 09:19:32 I meant VIP servers xp
general 2020-08-31 09:19:39 how stupid of me
general 2020-08-31 09:20:01 Expert servers?
general 2020-08-31 09:20:28 <@456226577798135808> Any wider and that would've been human Venom
general 2020-08-31 09:21:14 3 out of 10
general 2020-08-31 09:21:35 Only 7 more up until you can get Designer Rank 1
general 2020-08-31 09:21:43 Which gives you access to the server's own VIP servers
general 2020-08-31 09:22:41 Wait, oh wait
general 2020-08-31 09:23:03 Yes I see why that is bad
general 2020-08-31 09:23:16 I did not think about that
general 2020-08-31 09:23:26 I shall use the Motherland instead
general 2020-08-31 09:23:30 Because the Motherland is best waifu
general 2020-08-31 09:23:49 Mother Russia provides us with ***m e m e***
general 2020-08-31 09:24:57 No
general 2020-08-31 09:25:24 The USSR tho
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 09:25:57 dunno if this boi is too wide
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 09:26:51 ok
general 2020-08-31 09:27:04 I feel brainded
general 2020-08-31 09:27:15 Yes I am very brainded
general 2020-08-31 09:27:37 I need the Dew
general 2020-08-31 09:27:43 The Dew of the Mountain

general 2020-08-31 09:29:16 But the Saab drops meatballs
general 2020-08-31 09:34:33 <@!451025784228806656> I was thinking of the planes
general 2020-08-31 09:34:36 Meatball bomber
general 2020-08-31 09:42:07 Wait NSFW?
general 2020-08-31 09:42:17 As in "popcorn" type of content?
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 09:42:37 https://i.redd.it/0vwygtqrbbpz.jpg
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 09:42:55 I see there is panel between engine and elevator
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 09:43:12 Still can't do TVC
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 09:43:19 Because of the way I motor locked my engines
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 09:44:24 ngl the legs made me think of a prion
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 09:44:54 wait no something else, i forgot what they're called
general 2020-08-31 09:48:57 <@456226577798135808> Must be one really dumb unde
general 2020-08-31 09:49:15 I'm surprised nobody in his family sees him viewing NSFW content
general 2020-08-31 09:49:23 And gets away with it
general 2020-08-31 09:50:05 Besides being unde means you're not allowed to use pretty much plenty of services
general 2020-08-31 09:50:23 Discord ToS says 13+ right?
general 2020-08-31 09:50:35 Doesn't YouTube require you to be 13+ to use a lot of features?
general 2020-08-31 09:50:53 If not then you're restricted to YouTube Kids or whatever's close on desktop
general 2020-08-31 09:56:52 ***do it.***
general 2020-08-31 09:57:21 You have two choices
general 2020-08-31 09:57:31 Be the responsible mod
general 2020-08-31 09:57:33 Or be the troll
general 2020-08-31 10:01:11 If you can
general 2020-08-31 10:01:14 Be the leader
general 2020-08-31 10:03:45 <@!562612137474916353> You may now get a role
general 2020-08-31 10:03:52 rank
general 2020-08-31 10:04:23 Well, there's all you need
general 2020-08-31 10:06:35 Depends on rank
general 2020-08-31 10:06:47 But designer just requires the vote - downvote ratio
general 2020-08-31 10:10:21 Gamer Thailand has one messed up perception of reality
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 10:10:55 I think I just realized why I haven't experienced pitch stalling until now
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 10:11:18 The fact that there's almost no wings in front in my older planes
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 10:11:28 I just use canards to actively prevent nose diving
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 10:11:44 And that the main wing and elevators act as one huge elevator instead of an air brake
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 10:11:59 Now that I don't use canards, the entire plane can now be an airbrake
general 2020-08-31 10:12:31 The world is chaos and we distract ourselves from it in multiple ways
general 2020-08-31 10:12:38 Or some join the chaos
general 2020-08-31 10:12:59 And oof
general 2020-08-31 10:12:59 We as a species have made our lives a disaster
general 2020-08-31 10:13:19 Well, hope you get a better
general 2020-08-31 10:13:35 I remember when I was an unde, I was actually pretty happy not knowing how the world works
general 2020-08-31 10:14:11 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/749934238534729758 Is this a good explanation as to why I haven't experienced stalling when pitching until now?
general 2020-08-31 10:15:15 Mine is medium
general 2020-08-31 10:16:49 I pitched up and held D together
general 2020-08-31 10:16:57 I did a loop to the right
general 2020-08-31 10:17:14 Like literally the plane just looped, and sorta just got moved to the right
general 2020-08-31 10:17:38 Sorta just followed the direction of a coil
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 10:17:56 Why is the Burj's base
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 10:17:58 Like that
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 10:18:32 i am the dirty green mind
general 2020-08-31 10:19:04 I don't see a point in doing that anyways
general 2020-08-31 10:19:12 Also, when it does a straight loop, it sorta slows down when it's upside down
general 2020-08-31 10:19:20 Imagine if I made a plane overshoot and now I'm behind it
general 2020-08-31 10:20:33 Is it possible to use a loop in PvP?
general 2020-08-31 10:20:43 Like in my mind, I was thinking I'm being chased by a plane
general 2020-08-31 10:20:54 By doing a loop I slow down and I'm behind the plane
general 2020-08-31 10:21:07 Which I can use by shooting down the plane once I'm behind it
general 2020-08-31 10:24:18 Wait, what's folding@home?
general 2020-08-31 10:25:00 Oh interesting
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 10:27:53 nice place to put a nose cone
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 10:27:56 hmm succhoi
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 10:28:48 Succhoi succ bird into nose

plane-crazy 2020-08-31 10:33:39 Make it wedgy boi
general 2020-08-31 10:34:00 I gave up on Python xp
general 2020-08-31 10:34:10 I wanna do Unity
general 2020-08-31 10:34:13 But I am the lazz
general 2020-08-31 10:34:43 Yes, Python is good, both for beginners and experienced programmers
general 2020-08-31 10:34:55 But I also want game, after seeing Sam Hogan and PolyMars
general 2020-08-31 10:35:25 But I want Python, then *sea sharp*
general 2020-08-31 10:35:39 I wanna be mechanical engineer tbh
general 2020-08-31 10:36:01 <@!260797229068058634> That's how our school introduced us to programming before HTML
general 2020-08-31 10:36:33 *It took us 9th grade to reach Javascript, and it's not even a detailed lesson*
general 2020-08-31 10:36:47 I'm in 10th grade, I hope for actual Java

general 2020-08-31 10:40:13 I should really learn another programming language after Python
general 2020-08-31 10:40:42 I feel like I should try out C# for just some lighthearted game development
general 2020-08-31 10:40:59 C#
general 2020-08-31 10:41:04 The only reason I wanted to learn C#
general 2020-08-31 10:41:14 Games
general 2020-08-31 10:41:59 I either have Java or C# to choose as a secondary programming language
general 2020-08-31 10:42:46 C++ too, I forgot
general 2020-08-31 10:42:53 Three  choices then, and I don't know what to choice
general 2020-08-31 10:42:55 brain empty

general 2020-09-01 02:10:10 What is f3x?
general 2020-09-01 02:10:19 Also inventor has been made unobtainable
general 2020-09-01 02:10:42 So easy mode Roblox Studio
general 2020-09-01 02:11:03 <@456238251204935690> Video has NSFW content?
general 2020-09-01 02:11:38 Just keep things PG13
general 2020-09-01 02:12:47 <@456226577798135808> You forgot being a weird grasshopper but for vehicle seats
general 2020-09-01 02:12:56 Seathopper
general 2020-09-01 02:13:16 I just woke up
general 2020-09-01 02:13:24 They keep trying to get a free ride
general 2020-09-01 02:14:38 Do I need to learn Lua for f3x
general 2020-09-01 02:15:01 Meme chat is <#495286269459300364>
general 2020-09-01 22:13:59 a ping
general 2020-09-01 22:14:30 reeeeeeeeck, y u ping
general 2020-09-02 00:35:04 I wanna learn Python
general 2020-09-02 00:35:14 But I do the procrastinate
general 2020-09-02 00:37:44 <@!349710938607452160> I mean I have poob brain
general 2020-09-02 00:37:54 I wanna start with something that's basic for me
general 2020-09-02 00:38:15 Oh
general 2020-09-02 00:38:19 That's what school shoved down my throat
general 2020-09-02 00:39:12 I wanna take a break from HTML, school already tried to shove it in my head for most of high school
general 2020-09-02 00:40:53 Any other programming languages to make note of?
general 2020-09-02 00:41:17 xp
general 2020-09-02 00:41:35 You literal fuck xp
general 2020-09-02 00:42:03 I'm still setting my eyes onto Java or C
general 2020-09-02 00:42:21 C
general 2020-09-02 00:42:35 And it's adopted children
general 2020-09-02 00:42:40 C++ and C#
general 2020-09-02 00:43:09 4 choices
general 2020-09-02 00:44:09 hmm, what to choose
general 2020-09-02 00:44:23 Which one would be worth it in pain-reward/benefits ratio
general 2020-09-02 00:46:18 How many games that aren't Minecraft even use Java? Python probably could do what Java could already do
general 2020-09-02 00:47:02 *rebranded purchase* *
general 2020-09-02 00:48:02 No reason to unless I'm really dedicated to it as a hobby
general 2020-09-02 00:48:21 I guess I'll just look forward to C
general 2020-09-02 00:48:44 Yes, good luck on my arse
general 2020-09-02 00:48:59 C# or C++ tho
general 2020-09-02 00:49:24 I'd probably find most use in games though, considering I picked up programming as a hobby
general 2020-09-02 00:49:55 I'll look into C++ then once I learned enough Python
general 2020-09-02 00:51:01 Unreal, Godot and Source use C++, good enough for me
general 2020-09-02 00:51:19 Unity uses C# but considering I have other choices...
general 2020-09-02 00:55:17 literally
general 2020-09-02 01:05:12 I forgot my cousin does C
general 2020-09-02 01:05:27 <@!349710938607452160> I forgot this ^
general 2020-09-02 01:05:32 He's around my age
general 2020-09-02 01:05:47 I could ask him if I need help xp
general 2020-09-02 01:17:26 Someone else suggested me to go with C++
general 2020-09-02 01:17:33 My cousin does both C++ and C#
general 2020-09-02 01:17:43 I'll just go with the majority
general 2020-09-02 01:18:00 My Samsung has a bloated battery
general 2020-09-02 01:18:10 I don't take care of my electronics 🤡
general 2020-09-02 01:18:36 I mean, being good at the game also means learning how to let go of builds
general 2020-09-02 01:19:49 Meanwhile I'm here forced to rely on my parents
general 2020-09-02 01:20:06 Like they don't trust me that well
general 2020-09-02 01:20:26 Which is fair, considering I already broke two phones in a gorilla infested warzone known as school
general 2020-09-02 01:20:42 We don't have lawns here
general 2020-09-02 01:20:53 Most are just h o u s e
general 2020-09-02 01:21:13 Colored lines
general 2020-09-02 01:21:36 I remember wen I broke my LCD
general 2020-09-02 01:21:48 My HTC had a fucking black blob covering most of the screen
general 2020-09-02 01:22:10 Before that drop, I had a drop that made the pixels look thicc
general 2020-09-02 01:23:10 *Abandon slab. Revive brick*
general 2020-09-02 01:24:04 <@!260797229068058634> I dropped my HTC for a few times
general 2020-09-02 01:24:18 IT's screen completely died
general 2020-09-02 01:24:33 My cheap Chinese phone that I was given without choice cracked
general 2020-09-02 01:24:39 Under simple compression
general 2020-09-02 01:25:02 Literally pressure was enough to kill the phone from ever working again
general 2020-09-02 01:25:07 And it had a screen protector
general 2020-09-02 01:25:26 To be fair, my parents did buy me (without choice) a cheap 20 dollar phone
general 2020-09-02 01:25:39 With cheap plastic, thicc as fuck body
general 2020-09-02 01:26:25 <@!502211422718263307> It's a cheap, thicc as fucc, plastic Lenovo you shouldn't even buy. Pressure was enough to kill it so don't put it in your pocket
general 2020-09-02 01:26:44 2nd in what survived among my phones was my Samsung Galaxy S5
general 2020-09-02 01:27:23 The only damage was the front panel popped a little, but I blame my swole battery for putting pressure on it
general 2020-09-02 01:30:54 <@!444476246899032086> Root a Samsung
general 2020-09-02 01:31:11 unde
general 2020-09-02 01:32:01 Yes, it is
general 2020-09-02 01:32:07 I have a lot of gay friends, like fr
general 2020-09-02 01:32:19 ~~I mean what did you expect, I'm a furry~~
general 2020-09-02 01:32:34 str8 boy with a lot of lgbt friends
general 2020-09-02 01:36:09 Backwards wings?
general 2020-09-02 01:36:15 I mean, aren't all wings backwards?
general 2020-09-02 01:36:21 Apart from some planes
general 2020-09-02 01:36:27 ~~*berkut*~~
general 2020-09-02 01:36:55 I tried building that
general 2020-09-02 01:37:03 the plane do the shake
general 2020-09-02 01:37:40 haha plane go brrr
general 2020-09-02 01:37:54 <@!163143541160148992> Ballast tanks?
general 2020-09-02 01:38:05 If it is, then don't they only change in water?
general 2020-09-02 01:38:52 Probably would've made sense anyways, aircraft don't just suddenly change weight
general 2020-09-02 01:39:59 I saw what Herrison did to his plane (as watershep)
general 2020-09-02 01:40:03 I wanna do custom engines now
general 2020-09-02 01:40:08 Just so I can do vectored thrust
general 2020-09-02 01:40:21 A thing that motor locked jet + rocket engines can't do
general 2020-09-02 01:41:07 How to make custom engines

general 2020-09-02 01:41:32 <@!260797229068058634> **sleep.**
general 2020-09-02 01:41:36 just sleep
general 2020-09-02 01:41:48 Forget about Dicsord, you have an entire lifetime for that
general 2020-09-02 01:42:16 Fall asleep to YouTube
general 2020-09-02 01:42:23 o h
general 2020-09-02 01:42:53 Sleep for me is either timeskip or be an observer in a world made up in my head
general 2020-09-02 01:42:56 Just watch
general 2020-09-02 01:42:56 No control
general 2020-09-02 01:43:49 Seeing my brother's classmates, I see the boys having a lack in braincells
general 2020-09-02 01:44:06 like how does one not understand the simple concept of behaving
general 2020-09-02 01:44:27 My dreams are just exist
general 2020-09-02 01:44:38 It's like watching TV except you have no control
general 2020-09-02 01:44:39 And it's VR
general 2020-09-02 01:44:51 It just happens
general 2020-09-02 01:45:28 <@!260797229068058634> You'll know when you're not dreaming when it's just a timeskip with a void in between the previous day and today
general 2020-09-02 01:45:43 I remember that one dream with Chadwick Boseman
general 2020-09-02 01:45:51 Yes
general 2020-09-02 01:45:55 Somehow I dreamt of that
general 2020-09-02 01:46:02 It even had a Black Panther-esque scene in it
general 2020-09-02 01:47:39 <@456226577798135808> Sleep at a somewhat consistent schedule, do not force sleep, relax
general 2020-09-02 01:48:03 I fall asleep when I'm relaxed
general 2020-09-02 01:48:18 I don't get headaches
general 2020-09-02 01:48:29 So I don't know how
general 2020-09-02 01:48:45 you should reallly sleep more
general 2020-09-02 01:49:26 Having light noise in the background helps tbh
general 2020-09-02 01:49:32 It keeps you from being driven insane
general 2020-09-02 01:49:43 Seriously?
general 2020-09-02 01:50:04 Even fans trigger that fear?
general 2020-09-02 01:51:07 Sleep with a fan set to low power, fall asleep to YouTube (podcasts, whatever your choice is), make it not too bright but not completely dark
general 2020-09-02 01:51:22 I close the window
general 2020-09-02 01:51:30 I don't like unneccessary noise
general 2020-09-02 01:51:51 the only time I fall asleep to noise is at random
general 2020-09-02 01:51:56 Usually when relaxed
general 2020-09-02 01:52:22 Doesn't matter which way you relax, whether you hug a pillow or fall asleep to music/video
general 2020-09-02 01:52:31 Fans aren't cold, unless the air is cold
general 2020-09-02 01:53:14 <@456226577798135808> Jump out of a Blackbird, or crash land a Space Shuttle

general 2020-09-02 08:24:59 Why are you trying to show your setup?
general 2020-09-02 08:26:49 <@456226577798135808> Don't worry, you can dump it down 0balance
general 2020-09-02 08:26:56 He's a dump
general 2020-09-02 08:27:42 <@!396200986386890762> No, it's worse if you shoot it in front
general 2020-09-02 08:27:50 Now you can't recover from that
general 2020-09-02 08:29:38 I'll just go now, away from a wild Redditor/4-channer
general 2020-09-02 08:30:41 <@!347182144873037824> I mean it's fucking common sense m8
general 2020-09-02 08:31:44 Adios
general 2020-09-02 08:31:59 <@!347182144873037824> Btw your setup sucks
general 2020-09-02 08:32:36 <@!723419054114865202> What black magic do you consume?
general 2020-09-02 08:33:01 <@!457827362520694790> As long as you're not 240K then that's fine
general 2020-09-02 08:33:05 ***rick***
general 2020-09-02 08:33:23 Did you seriously made it 4 000 000?
general 2020-09-02 08:33:33 Tell us is that real?
general 2020-09-02 08:33:46 4 MB is 4 000 000
general 2020-09-02 08:34:52 So, we were previously stuck with what like 280 KB of plot storage
general 2020-09-02 08:34:55 Now we have 4 MB
general 2020-09-02 08:35:00 That's a big jump
general 2020-09-02 08:35:08 280 KB to 4 MB is a lot
general 2020-09-02 08:36:43 For a second I thought you meant gun as in we hold guns
general 2020-09-02 08:37:13 <@456226577798135808> What are you gonna do with your alts?
general 2020-09-02 08:39:08 <@!651029619251609611> ***alt***
general 2020-09-02 08:39:23 Should we tell?
general 2020-09-02 08:43:00 This looks oddly like literal shit
general 2020-09-02 08:43:01 
general 2020-09-02 08:43:21 It's thing
general 2020-09-02 08:43:23 Turd engine
general 2020-09-02 08:43:32 I call it
general 2020-09-02 08:43:34 The turd engine
general 2020-09-02 08:44:01 How does Herisson do it so well
general 2020-09-02 08:44:18 I have a bomb, it's motor locked
general 2020-09-02 08:44:59 b o m b
general 2020-09-02 08:45:16 ***s o y u z   n e r u s h i m y***
general 2020-09-02 08:50:29 How do I make custom engine not poob
general 2020-09-02 08:51:02 oh wait let me clarify
general 2020-09-02 08:51:29 how to make this not poob https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/750636888490246234
general 2020-09-02 08:52:09 Yes
general 2020-09-02 08:52:20 I wanted to try something that isn't a motor locked rocket + jet engine
general 2020-09-02 08:52:26 So I can do TVC on it
general 2020-09-02 08:53:02 Finding nice back view of the pro builder's planes
general 2020-09-02 08:53:48 as long as I can make my succhoi look good, then I'm fine
general 2020-09-02 08:54:18 <@!163143541160148992> dafuq is that?
general 2020-09-02 08:54:37 boing boi
general 2020-09-02 08:55:12 I was searching over jay's creations
general 2020-09-02 08:55:18 Did I just saw the most American thing?
general 2020-09-02 08:55:55 More searching
general 2020-09-02 08:56:04 And I found "plane with thighs"
general 2020-09-02 08:56:19 ***plane with thighs***
*aeromorph flashbacks*
general 2020-09-02 08:56:46 I give up
general 2020-09-02 08:56:48 I'll just experiment
general 2020-09-02 08:57:17 Now I only need my alt for different themed builds
general 2020-09-02 08:57:23 My main for stupid crap
general 2020-09-02 08:57:28 My alt for more serious builds
general 2020-09-02 08:58:28 thank you, our great rickness
general 2020-09-02 08:58:31 Wait no
general 2020-09-02 08:58:38 Thank you our great Asstleyness
general 2020-09-02 08:58:54 If the queen is called "Your Highness"
general 2020-09-02 08:59:01 Let's call rick "Your Asstleyness"
general 2020-09-02 09:00:05 4 000 000 bytes
general 2020-09-02 09:00:25 Yes rick
general 2020-09-02 09:00:31 With that amount, we can either...
general 2020-09-02 09:01:13 <@456226577798135808> Now, if the next *major* update we might get better more plot space
general 2020-09-02 09:02:00 I'll just watch some videos and continue doing school stuff
general 2020-09-02 09:02:45 Rick, is it possible to add more save slots? Because we're gonna need a lot more save slots for the ones that don't do big builds all the time
general 2020-09-02 09:03:04 <@!396200986386890762> Wait until the past of your lifetime, when we can go past Moore's Law
general 2020-09-02 09:03:55 It's gonna be a *looooong* time before we get bigger plot size
general 2020-09-02 09:04:09 That's when rick softcodes
general 2020-09-02 09:04:47 Limit it somewhere around like I dunno, 1 KB before the actual maximum
general 2020-09-02 09:05:05 A few KB before the maximum
general 2020-09-02 09:06:16 <@!551573378662662145> Don't save over 240K until the update comes
general 2020-09-02 09:06:24 Which means say bye bye to rocket for now
general 2020-09-02 09:06:55 40 GB on the Roblox server
general 2020-09-02 09:07:15 <@!163143541160148992> Gotta consider the fact that there's undes too
general 2020-09-02 09:07:21 Actually no
general 2020-09-02 09:07:30 They'll barely fill it up
general 2020-09-02 09:07:52 Let's take the most popular game
general 2020-09-02 09:13:50 Let's take the most popular grindfest on Roblox, Adopt Me

Now considering we can't get statistics for the actual amount of people playing, let's take favorites instead. This game has been favorited by 14,450,866 people

4 MB is 4000000 bytes, now multiply that by the amount of favorites and you'll get 57803464000000 bytes which converted into the following is

- 57803500000 Kilobytes
- 57803500 Megabytes
- 57803.5 Gigabytes
- 57.8035 Terabytes
- 0.0578035 Petabytes

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petabyte Refer to the "Usage examples" section to get an idea how much is a petabyte
general 2020-09-02 09:14:31 So, how much storage does Roblox have?
general 2020-09-02 09:17:11 57.8035 terabytes isn't that bad, but considering how much games there are on Roblox that's gonna be inflated to be a lot bigger

Now, here's a quote from the Wikipedia article on an exabyte (bigger than petabyte)

"In 2013, Randall Munroe compiled published assertions about Google's data centers, and estimated that the company has about 10 exabytes stored on disk, and additionally approximately 5 exabytes on tape backup.[28] The company has not commented on Munroe's estimate."
general 2020-09-02 09:18:37 Yes rick
general 2020-09-02 09:19:05 <@456226577798135808> Close enough, but anything beyond exabyte is too much
general 2020-09-02 09:19:28 I'm just gonna assume Roblox has at most some exabytes of storage to handle it all
general 2020-09-02 09:20:56 Anyways, I'm too tried
general 2020-09-02 09:20:58 tired*
general 2020-09-02 09:21:09 I'll just watch one last video before I continue school stuff
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:53:50 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:54:01 wing panels for the panels beside the engine
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:54:03 Or wedges
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:54:12 Gotta do some thrust vectoring
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:54:40 I just copied from this https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/sukhojj-su-27-2.png
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:55:22 <@!645128367611445248> Looking at it, maybe one block reduction is needed isn't it?
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:55:32 Not sure how I'll extend the length though
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:58:09 Reminds me earlier with 0balance
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 13:00:15 Last thing that got him banned was shitposting in general
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 13:00:44 Kinda got offended what he thinks of my setup is the messy lazy gamer setup
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 13:00:52 Looks like he got bit back in the ass
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 13:01:17 Honestly shitposting weird crap in <#497142796961054721> was enough to give me bad vibes
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 13:01:46 Literally random stuff, no context
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 13:01:47 Just image
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 13:02:36 Honestly how I see him now is either a typical toxic user on 4-chan or one of the lowlifes on Reddit's more toxic subreddits
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 13:03:05 yes, move
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 13:03:28 Black
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 13:03:33 Sometimes I don't know you xp
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 13:03:39 But I have no problems with that
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 13:04:02 I should stop anyways, I'm procrastinating again in building in PC

plane-crazy 2020-09-02 13:11:34 Ballasts or helium
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 13:12:05 I could get away with enequal weight with either clever wing placement or more power
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 13:12:44 I mean you could make the canards pitch up if it nose dives
general 2020-09-02 13:13:25 take me

general 2020-09-03 03:07:21 <@456226577798135808> Why not OBS?
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 03:08:05 Just wait till you see iSuspension's ship
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 03:08:45 A month
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 03:08:56 That's about as long as me playing this game
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 03:09:28 Procrastination?
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 03:09:56 Also for two sided pistons, the closest you can get is motor locked pistons
general 2020-09-03 03:10:22 I mean it already established itself a reputation
general 2020-09-03 03:10:38 And it's FOSS (free and open source software)
general 2020-09-03 03:10:51 Worked for me
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 03:11:20 What do locked pistons do
general 2020-09-03 03:14:18 I'm familiar with the feeling
general 2020-09-03 03:14:33 I remember my three folder jumbo
general 2020-09-03 03:14:39 It sucked in terms of appearance
general 2020-09-03 03:14:56 But for the engineering part, well I'm surprised I managed to do it at the time
general 2020-09-03 03:17:50 I feel like I've only played this game for two months
general 2020-09-03 03:18:19 I have e-mail and office software, what other kind of software do I need for online classes (already have Zoom)
general 2020-09-03 03:18:44 Firefox

creations-chat 2020-09-03 03:39:20 Still needs to look better
creations-chat 2020-09-03 03:42:25 I mean it really depends on you on how you design your plane
creations-chat 2020-09-03 03:42:50 The plane I'm making has ramp intakes (those box shaped intakes)
creations-chat 2020-09-03 03:43:23 Easy speed

plane-crazy 2020-09-03 04:05:49 Those wheels look odd ngl
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 04:07:13 I'm not used to round wheels
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 04:07:18 Like those wheels are very round
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 04:15:30 So afterburning engines have variable nozzle geometry
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 04:19:26 this doesn't look too bad
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 04:21:30 oof sorry this is outside of my experience, all I could say is looks like nothing is wrong

general 2020-09-04 01:43:54 Draw wings, because Nevada is a space bat in disguise

general 2020-09-04 01:48:45 What is Nevada? A human? Space bat? Neko?
general 2020-09-04 01:49:34 Why is ||Gamora|| Nevada
general 2020-09-04 01:50:29 Werewolf but space bat?

general 2020-09-04 01:58:16 we need to wait for weentur
general 2020-09-04 01:59:17 i'll wait instead
general 2020-09-04 01:59:46 Plane Crazy is the only game I'm willing to give bobux
general 2020-09-04 02:00:07 Speakers first
general 2020-09-04 02:00:18 Then the pacc so I can make building easier
general 2020-09-04 02:02:57 <@!221487880487436288> Mmm, jpeg compression
general 2020-09-04 02:03:36 <:EYES:525319504721608705>
general 2020-09-04 02:03:45 That's a bit too much
general 2020-09-04 02:04:09 <@!287779983445721088> Reminds me of 70s era European cars
general 2020-09-04 02:04:19 Or somewhere near that time
general 2020-09-04 02:05:00 The front reminds me of a Ford Sierra ngl
general 2020-09-04 02:05:34 That's why it gave me the European vibes
general 2020-09-04 02:05:52 Wasn't the Sierra designed by Ford Europe?
general 2020-09-04 02:06:37 It was inspired by the Renault 5
general 2020-09-04 02:07:23 <@!287779983445721088> **Now rally it**
general 2020-09-04 02:07:34 Renaut also makes sports cars, under the Alpine brand
general 2020-09-04 02:08:49 Alpine
general 2020-09-04 02:08:54 Lotus before Lotus
general 2020-09-04 02:09:08 It uses fibreglass, and it recycles parts from other cars
general 2020-09-04 02:09:30 There's a car named the Gaylord Gladiator
general 2020-09-04 02:10:27 <@456226577798135808> French people's car
general 2020-09-04 02:10:37 A French equivalent of the VW Beetle
general 2020-09-04 02:11:33 damn
general 2020-09-04 02:11:37 those tires are thicc
general 2020-09-04 02:12:22 roblox girls but tires
general 2020-09-04 02:12:54 <@!615876745710534676> What do you think when I say "Polestar"

Because that's Volvo's performance sub-brand
general 2020-09-04 02:13:35 well notebook battery low
general 2020-09-04 02:13:36 gtg
general 2020-09-04 04:10:28 Would a motor locked custom engine not wobble? (I'm trying to do TVC)
general 2020-09-04 04:11:25 <@!447221768520859659> Sometimes I experience the motor 2 I'm using wobbling uncontrollably
general 2020-09-04 04:11:54 For an engine
general 2020-09-04 04:12:36 But the motor 2 I'm using for thrust vectoring too
general 2020-09-04 04:16:30 No wobble yet
general 2020-09-04 04:16:37 I could motor lock
general 2020-09-04 09:15:24 oh hi rick
general 2020-09-04 09:15:40 how is being a pickle dev
general 2020-09-04 09:16:12 Does rick still get some money though?
general 2020-09-04 09:16:17 Considering he is now the dev of the game
general 2020-09-04 09:16:48 Isn't robux convertible to actual currency?
general 2020-09-04 09:17:05 ~~in that case, boy does adopt me have a lot of funds~~
general 2020-09-04 09:17:22 Let me search it up
general 2020-09-04 09:17:52 https://www.quora.com/Can-you-convert-Robux-to-real-money?share=1
general 2020-09-04 09:18:04 "Yes, but there's some requirements"
general 2020-09-04 09:18:17 So yes, you can earn money from robux
general 2020-09-04 09:18:36 wait
general 2020-09-04 09:18:39 earn money from robux
general 2020-09-04 09:18:54 $D
general 2020-09-04 09:19:24 If you got a game that might go big on Roblox, then it might be worth it
general 2020-09-04 09:20:58 <@!741264456360788038> "To show you the power of Flex tape, I sawed this duck in half"
general 2020-09-04 09:21:18 <@456226577798135808> Sir, the reason we want you to change your name is to make it easier to ping you
general 2020-09-04 09:21:42 Yes, contact admins if it's really that big of a deal
general 2020-09-04 09:22:04 You really are a clown, I'll just go play PC
general 2020-09-04 09:23:35 <@!387195148741771275> Yes, I mean iSuspension already did it
general 2020-09-04 09:23:44 Be the suspension boi you are
general 2020-09-04 09:24:19 ~~is it me or am i getting karen vibes from this~~
general 2020-09-04 09:26:46 Finally, c o l m
general 2020-09-04 09:29:01 <@!280020722431295488> Even more Karen vibes
general 2020-09-04 09:31:21 Roblox skipped Science class so that's why it don't physics
general 2020-09-04 09:32:56 I mean, you can't really do ultra-realistic physics if you're aiming to be not only multiplatform but can also run on low end devices
general 2020-09-04 09:33:37 Motors like to freak out when they feel crowded
general 2020-09-04 09:34:02 So far my TVC engine doesn't wobble (yet)
general 2020-09-04 09:34:19 Could be the fact it hasn't flown yet, could be because it's anchored
general 2020-09-04 09:34:32 Do the shake
general 2020-09-04 09:34:38 Well, so far only problem is occasional jamming
general 2020-09-04 09:34:56 So I made parts of the body ice for minimal friction
general 2020-09-04 09:35:08 While the engine remains in slate for apperance reasons
general 2020-09-04 09:37:12 https://streamable.com/js0ehz .
general 2020-09-04 09:37:30 there
general 2020-09-04 09:39:42 still needs more engines
general 2020-09-04 09:39:44 and trails
general 2020-09-04 09:39:52 6 rows should do it
general 2020-09-04 09:40:00 DM yousuf
general 2020-09-04 09:41:22 tall boi looks tall enough
general 2020-09-04 09:41:49 Wait
general 2020-09-04 09:41:53 I remember someone
general 2020-09-04 09:41:55 Joining
general 2020-09-04 09:41:59 Quite early on
general 2020-09-04 09:42:28 He said something about color roles being accessible by everyone early on the server's life

but that ain't the same person
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 02:46:21 
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 02:46:21 
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 02:46:43 I feel like this is good enough now, just gonna finish what needs to be finished
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 02:47:22 Can't get the sides of the canopy to go backwards when opening, only the top
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 02:53:19 Here's some less obvious stuff I added
- Ventral fins
- Semi-backwards opening canopy (only top)
- TVC engines (w/ motor locked super rocket engines, no wobble)
- Ramp air intakes

Also, I haven't forgotten about the air brakes and drouge parachute. What else am I missing from the Flanker family of jets
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 02:53:41 Honestly, if it's good enough, then it's good enough for me
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 02:53:53 I also followed the advice of using trails for afterburners
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 02:54:47 Btw, what's the needle at the tip of the nose called (the one where I used trails)
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 02:58:08 I'm guessing it's this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_data_boom
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 02:59:21 Or a pitot tube/probe
general 2020-09-05 03:01:30 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell-MBB_X-31 tall boi

general 2020-09-05 03:09:23 yes
general 2020-09-05 03:10:15 hello, and this looks like the kind of idea i'd build
general 2020-09-05 03:10:23 a literal land plane
general 2020-09-05 03:13:34 pls no
general 2020-09-05 03:14:07 thomas in pc is cursed
general 2020-09-05 03:16:03 <@!466793357318815744> What if Thomas is just a human piloting a train costume
general 2020-09-05 03:16:36 Ah, you see, those are the souls of the humans Dora captured and then forced into random objects
general 2020-09-05 03:17:49 Ah, so that's why they're happy to serve Dora
general 2020-09-05 03:17:57 She forces them into submission
general 2020-09-05 03:18:05 Stockholm Syndrome
general 2020-09-05 03:18:40 How does she make a monkey talk tho
general 2020-09-05 03:21:33 I mean it's not really meant to go on a track, it's meant for pure speed
general 2020-09-05 03:21:36 So rubber isn't needed
general 2020-09-05 03:24:27 There's also the Bloodhound LSR
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 03:28:10 Though if it's true that he had copied it by hand perfectly
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 03:28:18 Well, I can't disagree with CraftxTD
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 03:28:25 But still, copying bad
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 03:28:55 So a guy named Derpydud94?
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 03:33:11 https://www.roblox.com/users/772812183/profile copied the link if anyone's too lazy to type it by hand
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 03:34:06 Ah, yes
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 03:34:15 The kind of person who blows his cash onto costumes
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 03:34:31 https://www.roblox.com/users/772812183/inventory/#!/accessories
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 03:35:40 Like who needs 3 golden football helms
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 03:36:22 Plus he has a lot of offsale items, I'm betting those didn't came in cheap
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 03:37:04 O h
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 01:24:33 My plane just sorta glides, as in it lacks speed
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 01:24:43 What did I do wrong
help 2020-09-06 01:25:48 I made a plane with TVC
help 2020-09-06 01:25:52 It's slow as hecc
help 2020-09-06 01:26:04 It displays 640 yet it doesn't feel like it
help 2020-09-06 01:26:11 Thrust vectoring
help 2020-09-06 01:26:46 
help 2020-09-06 01:26:51 It already has a conveyor drive
help 2020-09-06 01:27:08 But it's buggy
help 2020-09-06 01:27:51 I mean it worked in my previous design
help 2020-09-06 01:28:31 
help 2020-09-06 01:28:44 I turned the effect particles off, it still didn't flew that fast
help 2020-09-06 01:29:40 Automatic, also the pic I posted has decent speed
help 2020-09-06 01:29:45 Doesn't feel like a flying snail
help 2020-09-06 01:30:39 And buggy
help 2020-09-06 01:31:18 2000, which isn't enough for what I usually achieve
help 2020-09-06 01:32:32 Tested my previous plane, got almost 8000
help 2020-09-06 01:34:37 Well, it does have a lot of vertical wings
help 2020-09-06 01:34:56 For half of both air intakes, the rudders, the ventral fins
help 2020-09-06 01:35:18 I think the thrust vectored engines are the ones that force Roblox to throttle
help 2020-09-06 01:35:33 <@!200793484053970944> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/478584971670454284/751976656947904672/RobloxScreenShot20200906_092618603.png
help 2020-09-06 01:36:14 I'll just either remove them entirely or use trails only
help 2020-09-06 01:39:00 Reduced the TVC to the role for afterburners only, it felt like it went faster but not fast enough
help 2020-09-06 01:40:22 It went faster without the TVC engines
general 2020-09-06 01:40:53 How do you people use thrust vectored engines without losing speed
general 2020-09-06 01:41:19 I got rid of mine and it flew faster
general 2020-09-06 01:41:25 Much faster
general 2020-09-06 01:42:33 I think I'll go do another redesign, without TVC
general 2020-09-06 01:42:45 And yet another session of making it slimmer
general 2020-09-06 01:44:10 Funny how my first and ugliest attempt was the one that had best performance, didn't even stall when pitching
general 2020-09-06 01:44:51 Poompkeen
general 2020-09-06 01:46:04 I'll go play something other than PC for today, kinda tired
general 2020-09-06 01:47:03 Is Arsenal just Team Fortress 2 but Roblox?
general 2020-09-06 01:52:24 What's Gai in Chinese though
general 2020-09-06 01:53:22 I do, because it messes with people
general 2020-09-06 01:53:46 > in multiple contexts
<@!287779983445721088> <:EYES:525319504721608705>
general 2020-09-06 01:54:05 Thanks for putting cursed images in my mind
general 2020-09-06 01:54:32 You have now made me think of tankmorphs
general 2020-09-06 02:05:08 Got back into playing FPS games, and relearned that pray and spray usually works
general 2020-09-06 02:19:46 The **0W0** Bush
general 2020-09-06 02:20:44 <@!287779983445721088> Make it go **0/w/0** to really make it cursed
general 2020-09-06 02:21:42 I have eat one egg pie
general 2020-09-06 02:21:51 It was fine, but not addicting tbh
general 2020-09-06 02:22:09 Felt smooth and buttery, but not something I'd eat a lot
general 2020-09-06 02:37:27 I misread that as rick engine
general 2020-09-06 02:43:04 "Weld a pee pee"
general 2020-09-06 02:43:12 Stop reminding me that truck pee pees exist
general 2020-09-06 02:45:37 I'm playing a game, and one of the aircraft is a literal Walrus
general 2020-09-06 02:46:53 Now I wanna see a flying Walrus
general 2020-09-06 02:47:00 Because it just sounds so ridiculous
general 2020-09-06 02:56:44 <@!221487880487436288> why is tonk so smooth
general 2020-09-06 02:59:10 So that why it smooth
general 2020-09-06 02:59:23 Any smoother and it might become the SUVs of tanks
general 2020-09-06 03:11:04 I think I'll go build an F-18 for now, I'm having some troubles in building the Flanker
general 2020-09-06 03:12:58 On second thought, F-15 instead
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 03:15:32 https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/strike-eagle2.gif Yet again another detailed blueprint
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 03:15:39 From the Drawing Database
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 03:15:57 It's very high res though, so zooming in is needed
general 2020-09-06 03:18:33 https://drawingdatabase.com/ this site has detailed blueprints
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 03:19:18 Is that an extension of the runway?
general 2020-09-06 03:19:42 Oh, well this is what you should expect from this site
general 2020-09-06 03:19:52 https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/strike-eagle2.gif
general 2020-09-06 03:20:06 Zoom in, it's 6000xsomething resolution
general 2020-09-06 03:21:54 <@!177743269105500160> I am confused, I also view the link directly in a new tab for how high resolution it is
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 03:27:37 <@!387195148741771275> Open it in new tab
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 03:27:43 Then zoom in
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 03:29:49 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 03:30:01 "6000 x 4091"
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 03:31:34 yes, lots of info
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 03:31:47 and details
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 03:31:48 and uhh stuff
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 03:32:14 ~~does anyone here understand russian though xp~~

I think I'll go rewatch this again after finishing any school related stuff
general 2020-09-06 06:14:13 Oh ok
general 2020-09-06 06:14:41 Well, I'm gonna go log out for today then come back
general 2020-09-06 07:36:13 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA25GjBbsRo Wait, someone built an Opel Blitz here right?
general 2020-09-06 07:36:28 Is it by any chance related to this video or not?
general 2020-09-06 07:36:39 Also, 'trode did another script hax
general 2020-09-06 07:37:09 Prototrode, was feeling lazy to type out the whole name
general 2020-09-06 07:37:39 Oh wait, this is Vulpen's channel
general 2020-09-06 07:37:53 Nevermind, this is their build
general 2020-09-06 07:38:33 grill is nice
general 2020-09-06 07:38:49 I assume it's ballast tanks and ladders, maybe wing panels on the side?
general 2020-09-06 07:41:45 engine go vrrrrroom https://streamable.com/npjorv
general 2020-09-06 07:42:19 Sweitlana? Is that another word for *that* German symbol
general 2020-09-06 07:43:12 oh good
general 2020-09-06 07:43:32 And I broke one of the pistons
general 2020-09-06 07:47:10 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Engine_movingparts.jpg I just do this
general 2020-09-06 07:47:16 Build a flat plane crankshaft
general 2020-09-06 07:48:11 you know what I'll just build it too tired to explain
general 2020-09-06 07:55:20 <@!615876745710534676> Pretend the black glass is text and these pistons are encased in the cylinders/engine block

Also green is input, red is output
general 2020-09-06 07:55:39 this is a 2 cylinder engine
general 2020-09-06 07:56:14 Yes, green go spinny
general 2020-09-06 07:56:35 Red go power stuff, if you want you can connect a timing belt to the camshaft
general 2020-09-06 07:56:45 And yes, green go spin to make piston up and down
general 2020-09-06 07:56:58 If it's encased, otherwise it will just flail
general 2020-09-06 07:57:30 I mean, it still is gonna spin the same speed
general 2020-09-06 07:57:56 Unless you go figure out a way to make it spin via en engine's boom juices
general 2020-09-06 07:57:57 then idk
general 2020-09-06 07:58:09 I couldn't make the valves yet
general 2020-09-06 07:58:32 I still haven't done a timing chain, valves and camshafts
general 2020-09-06 07:58:57 That is possible
general 2020-09-06 07:59:10 Never tried it
general 2020-09-06 08:00:19 I just did 4 cylinder because it's easy to build
general 2020-09-06 08:00:35 If I remember, a V8 shares one crankshaft
general 2020-09-06 08:01:34 Well, I don't know how to make them go diagonal
general 2020-09-06 08:01:37 Boxer though, maybe
general 2020-09-06 08:02:11 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_engine#Boxer_engine Never fully experimented tbh
general 2020-09-06 08:02:16 Also here's the boxer
general 2020-09-06 08:02:50 Yes, it's flat
general 2020-09-06 08:02:58 Only Subaru and Porsche uses boxer engines
general 2020-09-06 08:03:17 I usually associate inline 5s with Audi
general 2020-09-06 08:03:45 You sure you wanna build something that big?
general 2020-09-06 08:03:58 Make boxer engine for more pistons
general 2020-09-06 08:04:01 But car be wide boi
general 2020-09-06 08:05:02 That four banger takes up half a plot-ish, cylinder block alone
general 2020-09-06 08:05:09 W12, I associate that with Volkswagen
general 2020-09-06 08:05:21 If inline is one, V is two then W is three
general 2020-09-06 08:05:47 Didn't Mazda made a car that runs purely on alcohol
general 2020-09-06 08:05:56 ~~or what I call, the Russian juice~~
general 2020-09-06 08:06:19 I'll try making a boxer fr though
general 2020-09-06 08:06:39 ***ra-ra-rasputin stops***
general 2020-09-06 08:07:00 Also them
general 2020-09-06 08:08:46 Huh, so basically wider inline 4 https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.Q2PyIDm5dogtW3XAtlEICwHaFk%26pid%3DApi&f=1
general 2020-09-06 08:08:54 With 2 pistons opposing each other
general 2020-09-06 08:09:52 I have no idea how to make two pistons share the same area tbh
general 2020-09-06 08:10:54 yes
general 2020-09-06 08:11:13 Also, apparently flat eights exist https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat-eight_engine
general 2020-09-06 08:11:31 Randomly found it on DuckDuckGo, said it came from Subaru
general 2020-09-06 08:14:12 Make plane but it's a baguette
general 2020-09-06 08:14:20 And another but it's a sasauge
general 2020-09-06 08:14:30 And another one but it's whatever you can put on that's British
general 2020-09-06 08:14:45 And then make them dogfight
general 2020-09-06 08:15:28 I'll go try to find The Drawing Database's F-15 Eagle
general 2020-09-06 08:16:07 https://drawingdatabase.com/mcdonnell-douglas-f-15e-strike-eagle/ There's more planes down below
general 2020-09-06 08:17:17 General Dynamics-Grumman EF111A Raven, Dassault Mirage III. Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, Lockheed JetStar, Lockheed C-130 Hercules...
general 2020-09-06 08:17:25 I wonder how detailed tho
general 2020-09-06 08:18:26 For a second I misread that as Take On Me
general 2020-09-06 08:19:24 <@!467765396108476426> Make it fly
general 2020-09-06 08:20:38 save it
general 2020-09-06 08:20:47 for ooc reasons
general 2020-09-06 08:20:55 ~~thretten him with it~~
general 2020-09-06 08:21:12 I remembered when someone made a legless ugly hooman and called themselves a demon
general 2020-09-06 08:21:26 It was satisfying to yeet it with an equally ugly tank
general 2020-09-06 08:23:03 i must build the f-15, but what does brainded do to unbrainded
general 2020-09-06 08:23:42 make it your pfp
general 2020-09-06 08:23:59 do it
general 2020-09-06 08:24:12 do it or i call it ur mom
general 2020-09-06 08:26:04 you actually built it
general 2020-09-06 08:26:11 ***build the baguette for france***
general 2020-09-06 08:27:41 I just realized I could've made the nose longer so I wouldn't have to motor lock the canopy
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 08:35:54 needs more refinement
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 08:36:40 <https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/strike-eagle2.gif>
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 08:37:00 here
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 08:37:10 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 08:37:50 I kinda gave up for now on the Sukhoi Flanker tbh
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 08:38:06 <@!213233227979161601> Just visit the Drawing Database website
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 08:51:44 The absurd resolution on that site forces you to zoom into the original file (click original for example)
general 2020-09-06 09:02:22 I saw that self upvoted build
general 2020-09-06 09:02:41 Is it me or does it look like a flying electric cigarette
general 2020-09-06 09:03:53 I can't help but think that a vape stick had a baby with a Dassault Mirage 

@DryAitim1 it's in <#384025409945337856>
general 2020-09-06 09:05:18 The 0w0 tank
general 2020-09-06 09:06:03 <@287779983445721088> Is that W just a 3?
general 2020-09-06 09:06:12 But tilted to the side
general 2020-09-06 09:06:33 Tank go blush if you add some tilted 1s
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 09:07:37 I just like building stuff
general 2020-09-06 09:07:55 oof
general 2020-09-06 09:08:04 Guess owo tank no blush
general 2020-09-06 09:08:18 chonk pug(?)
general 2020-09-06 09:08:26 Can pug go pog
general 2020-09-06 09:09:21 Pug pog, but pig pog?
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 09:10:00 Is it me or is that one of the US's experimental aircraft
general 2020-09-06 09:10:20 What else rhymes with pog?
general 2020-09-06 09:10:25 Apart from pug and pig
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 09:11:05 I like calling it the Berkut, because my brain can't remember all of these numbers xp
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 09:11:38 Just like how I refer to Su-27 based fighters Flanker
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 09:12:46 berk
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 09:12:54 Plane go berk
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 09:13:17 I guess the other man's best friends are planes
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 09:13:50 ~~lets wish nobody takes that ooc~~
general 2020-09-06 09:14:09 Keyboard go strokk
general 2020-09-06 09:15:33 Needs 2000 characters and a whole lotta garbage data to win
general 2020-09-06 09:18:34 A dinosaur using its central processing unit of brain cells to try and construct an underwater self propelled explosive
general 2020-09-06 09:19:05 I got bored
general 2020-09-06 09:19:31 Who is Steggy
general 2020-09-06 09:19:45 Why is Cado?
general 2020-09-06 09:20:06 ~~no really what's cado?~~
general 2020-09-06 09:20:47 <@456226577798135808> Wait is that Stalin?
general 2020-09-06 09:21:22 9
general 2020-09-06 09:21:42 You better stop *stalin*g
general 2020-09-06 09:23:16 7 forgot to 8 9, so they went for 10
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 09:25:36 I feel like rick's not gonna add that tho, considering its such a niche thing
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 09:26:20 Actually wait, ships
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 09:26:37 I could see it working on ships, and other large stuff
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 09:27:21 Lower the knob
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 09:29:24 Anchors stop trapdoors from working
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 10:35:48 Meta?
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 10:36:34 "Abuse 2"

I mean to be fair you're abusing Plane Crazy more with conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 10:36:55 Also, idk what's meta in this context
general 2020-09-06 12:52:19 Is monocoque really pronounced as "mono-cock"?
general 2020-09-06 12:52:37 Also, I have experienced my first copycat
general 2020-09-06 12:52:55 "can i copy copy"
<blacklist>
"ew no" <leave>
general 2020-09-06 12:56:13 It really is pronounced similarly to cock
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 12:56:32 IGot bored, searched up my country's air force
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 12:56:45 It's a mix of old and new
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 12:57:49 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_military_aircraft_of_the_Philippines
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 12:58:12 The most advanced plane we have here are a dozen South Korean FA-50 Golden Eagles
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 12:58:28 We still have turboprop planes here
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 12:59:31 For transport, a mixture of various planes
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 12:59:50 We also have SPYDER SAM missiles
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 13:03:06 Literally the only non propeller based aircraft we have here are the KAI FA-50 Golden Eagle (a dozen in inventory) and a Gulfstream G280 (in order)
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 13:05:38 I keep noticing we order from the USA, UK, Germany, Italy and Israel, with Poland, Brazil, Australia, Spain and China being mentioned only once or a few times
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 13:08:11 Hmm, I wonder if I should build a building
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 13:09:08 plen go spin
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 13:09:38 swede
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 13:09:54 If it's really IKEA, then show us the instructions how to build suspension
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 13:12:41 eagle
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 13:13:23 <@!645128367611445248> I've never motor locked a plane up until the Sukhoi  Flanker
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 13:13:41 I got expert by building a 3 folder jumbo jet with 3 fold wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 13:13:59 I did motor lock with cars before though
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 13:15:49 Saab is the only Swedish plane I know
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 13:16:39 saab will stab
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 13:16:40 gn
general 2020-09-06 14:25:12 Random late night thought, I think it would be fitting to build my country's only supersonic aircraft
general 2020-09-06 14:25:28 The KAI FA-50 Golden Eagle
general 2020-09-06 14:26:53 I'm decent, like I'm not the best
general 2020-09-06 14:27:03 There's definitely people who can do better than me
general 2020-09-06 14:27:19 I.E: Herisson, 224jay
general 2020-09-06 14:27:33 But I did pick up stuff from others and made use of them
general 2020-09-06 14:28:05 I'll go read about the KAI FA-50 Golden Eagle before I sleep
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 14:45:04 dang I missed seeing the bomber for myself
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 14:45:38 Skinny Jay
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 14:49:50 What if I made a giant hammer
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 14:49:58 Used a conveyor drive to power it
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 14:50:07 And made the head out of metal ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 14:50:39 Would that literally slam people into ground, glitch into getting yeeted, or nothing?
general 2020-09-06 14:51:10 Blurry
general 2020-09-06 14:52:24 What if I make ban hammer in VIP1, but the head is made out of metal ballasts and method of thrust is both conveyor drive and super rocket engines
general 2020-09-06 14:53:16 Anything can be a nail if you slam it hard enough
general 2020-09-06 14:53:27 Including people
general 2020-09-06 14:54:39 <@456226577798135808> Looks like it's using a live axle (a type of dependent suspension)
general 2020-09-06 14:55:18 I have a "dependent" suspension
general 2020-09-06 14:55:25 Emphasis on the quotes
general 2020-09-06 14:55:47 It acts like a live axle, but my suspension experiences camber changes when needed
general 2020-09-06 14:55:59 So it's sorta both dependent and independent
general 2020-09-06 14:56:45 Well, based on my experience
general 2020-09-06 14:57:02 Taller suspension provides better off roading but worse stability
general 2020-09-06 14:57:10 The opposite for lower suspensions
general 2020-09-06 14:58:06 All I did was try copying Jeep's suspension
general 2020-09-06 14:58:30 A solid axle with coil springs
general 2020-09-06 14:59:01 The way I did it uses suspension blocks pulling on the live axle though
general 2020-09-06 14:59:36 Which have an effect on the suspension itself 

I'm on mobile, almost 11
general 2020-09-06 14:59:53 I'll just @ you when I'm available
general 2020-09-06 15:00:35 Donate so rick can have pizza
general 2020-09-06 15:01:02 If I had like plenty of bobux
general 2020-09-06 15:01:10 I'd invest it into good games like PC
general 2020-09-06 15:01:17 And spend some on how I look in game
general 2020-09-06 15:01:48 I have nobux
general 2020-09-06 15:02:04 I only have my bren
general 2020-09-06 15:02:08 And my PC
general 2020-09-06 15:02:29 hello i am the local dragon, i build plens
general 2020-09-06 15:03:09 my plens either look good or fly decent, rarely on between
general 2020-09-06 15:03:52 If there's one vehicle in here in PC that's rare
general 2020-09-06 15:03:56 It's trains
general 2020-09-06 15:04:10 Oh, I meant vehicle type
general 2020-09-06 15:04:20 But good vehicles are a rare sight too
general 2020-09-06 15:08:35 If rick updated the map (which would be impossible for a one-man dev team)

I feel like he should give ships and other water vehicles more room to work with, like make the map an island 

Give trains more purpose, by expanding their reach. Improving existing man-made areas such as the train station and the airport would be nice, as well as new areas 

Roads, for land vehicles, and generally make more unique areas to add that nice variety 

I'll go submit this in <#507673335816126509> tomorrow and polish up my thoughts about the map
general 2020-09-06 15:09:40 Imagine if high speed trains were actually viable instead of being victim to getting stuck
general 2020-09-06 15:09:57 Well, there's a lot of military stuff here
general 2020-09-06 15:11:13 There's also more casual stuff, like popular cars such as the AE-86, buses, etc.
general 2020-09-06 15:11:41 So civilian and military themed stuff would be definitely considered in PC
general 2020-09-06 15:12:09 High speed trains usually demand gentle curves
general 2020-09-06 15:12:21 ~~unless you're the UK~~
general 2020-09-06 15:12:42 ~~*cough* Advanced Passenger Train *cough*~~
general 2020-09-06 15:13:04 It's literally just a wooden building
general 2020-09-06 15:13:37 I do appreciate Rick building those buildings out of the game's own materials
general 2020-09-06 15:13:47 Consistency is nice
general 2020-09-06 15:18:31 *bonks with expert required for color role*
general 2020-09-06 15:19:54 Would the Advanced Passenger Train actually work in PC?
general 2020-09-06 15:20:10 Or would it's tilting system just be decorational?
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 15:21:25 Only in private/VIP servers do they not get destroyed
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 15:21:43 Which is why I refuse to use TNT motor locks
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 15:21:51 ~~Flex in public~~
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 15:22:35 I have a feeling disconnectors won't work so I won't have hope in that
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 15:22:56 Swedish SPAA
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 15:23:01 Can I take a dip in it?

plane-crazy 2020-09-06 15:23:48 <@456226577798135808> Literally just `!expertservers`

plane-crazy 2020-09-06 15:25:58 Then expert servers would be to keep out normies

general 2020-09-06 15:28:53 First time I went here my early builds experienced a lot of downvotes up until I used locked motors
general 2020-09-06 15:29:26 And really made use of wedges and references (3D models and highly detailed blueprints)
general 2020-09-06 15:30:24 Plane Crazy is fun, just be wary of some people
general 2020-09-06 15:30:41 Considering there are kids on Roblox, and you do know how they can be like

plane-crazy 2020-09-06 23:42:10 The game is hardcoded, it's hard to add whitelists without ending up breaking the game, and being a one man team it's hard to do thy quick

plane-crazy 2020-09-06 23:55:21 Male stupidity
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 23:56:31 Honestly though they need help
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 23:56:38 Stuff like racism
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 23:56:57 Only cares for themselves
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 23:57:26 One of them said they wanted to gamble when they grow up
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 23:58:13 But what do I expect

plane-crazy 2020-09-07 02:41:05 You need the explosives to have a speed of 300 to explode
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 02:43:00 Hmm, guess I should turn off ignore self for my missile to work then
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 02:43:12 ~~or maybe I have crappy design~~
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 02:45:16 Oh, so me not turning on arm on key is the reason my motor locked SAM missile doesn't explode on impact?
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 02:46:42 Well, at least I know my missile can work if I detonate it manually
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 02:47:23 Being a motor locked bomb, it causes lag
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 02:47:38 And Gamer Thailand is great

*In being a copycat*
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 02:48:25 Gamer Thailand ≠ originality
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 02:48:39 I'm surprised he hasn't learned anything from being a copycat
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 02:49:22 Like you'd think that time spent copying would eventually teach him some stuff so he could be original but nope
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 02:49:46 What if we mass commented he's a copycat
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 02:50:06 To expose it to his viewers
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 02:50:12 oh good
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 02:50:21 He hasn't turned off comments?
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 02:51:37 So if Gamer Thailand is infamous for being a copycat
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 02:51:50 Then what's 13blackguy's claim to infamy?
general 2020-09-07 02:53:11 I read about the F-15 Eagle, 104 kills to no losses is a lot, half of which are made by Israel

general 2020-09-07 02:56:37 I only do a few stuff
general 2020-09-07 02:56:43 School, Plane Crazy and other hobbies
general 2020-09-07 02:56:53 I'm still waiting for my dad to find a spare USB to setup Linux Mint

plane-crazy 2020-09-07 04:15:15 
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 04:15:23 
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 04:16:04 The Eagle's nose no longer falls apart, did some work on the body and made the trailing edge of the wings a little longer, to match the F-15's wings more
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 04:16:26 ship is missing a lot of stuff
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 04:17:00 It's a WIP, I can't say it's doodoo if it's not really finished yet

general 2020-09-07 04:27:46 <@!447221768520859659> So if I post a pic of a Boeing that also shares a platform with a military aircraft, do I get banned?
general 2020-09-07 04:28:50 So wait, I can get banned for posting this? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_E-4
general 2020-09-07 04:29:23 "The Boeing E-4 Advanced Airborne Command Post (AACP), the current "Nightwatch" aircraft,[2] is a strategic command and control military aircraft operated by the United States Air Force (USAF). The E-4 series are specially modified from the Boeing 747-200B for the National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP) program. The E-4 serves as a survivable mobile command post for the National Command Authority, namely the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, and successors."
general 2020-09-07 04:29:32 It's literally just a Boeing 747 converted into military use
general 2020-09-07 04:30:45 What if I post a former WW2 plane that has been converted into less war related activites
general 2020-09-07 04:30:48 Such as racing
general 2020-09-07 04:31:06 Will I get banned?
general 2020-09-07 04:31:14 <@!456238251204935690> So if I say Obama, ban?

plane-crazy 2020-09-07 09:57:10 nice trails
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 09:57:49 foxx
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 09:58:11 idk i saw a fox
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 09:58:36 I'm feeling a little brain dead today

plane-crazy 2020-09-07 09:59:47 <@456226577798135808> What plane is that?
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 10:00:19 I almost forgot to do the F-15
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 10:00:52 I'm gonna do rocket + jet engine motor lock again
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 10:01:10 Thrust vectored engines don't really benefit me
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 10:01:25 They're just a throttling parasite
general 2020-09-07 10:02:52 Hmm, what if I make trainer jets
general 2020-09-07 10:03:01 To train bacon into building plen
general 2020-09-07 10:03:11 And driving plen
general 2020-09-07 10:03:47 <@582598719916998692> Wait, he started streaming on May 16, and still streaming till now?
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 10:13:41 <@615876745710534676> I suggest looking the Mini, considering how it managed to fit both the transmission and engine into a tiny little package
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 10:14:18 I wonder if it's possible to make a flat six using half blocks
the-dump 2020-09-07 10:15:58 This man concerns me
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 10:16:39 I mean the motor's really the one doing most of the work to begin with so...
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 10:17:23 If TNT can actually push pistons, then it might be possible to make an actual engine
general 2020-09-07 11:19:27 wait no wrong site
general 2020-09-07 11:19:36 https://www.discordia.me/en/easter-eggs
general 2020-09-07 11:19:38 this exists
general 2020-09-07 11:19:56 And Discord apparently has Google style easter eggs
general 2020-09-07 11:20:06 Fun little stuff you'll find hidden
general 2020-09-07 11:21:49 It's 404 page has snek game
general 2020-09-07 11:22:26 https://discord.com/NotFound click button
general 2020-09-07 11:22:44 the rectangle beside the console
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:09:32 I'll go build a trainer aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:09:35 Because why not
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:10:10 I left, because too much stuff
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:10:33 Online classes is like a game of Tetris
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:10:43 It keeps coming
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:10:47 And it eventually gets harder
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:11:48 glitch or map?
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:11:52 oh wait
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:11:54 I just realized
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:11:58 It's just slow loading
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:12:11 Accurate, I know
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:12:29 I'll just go build a trainer aircraft, to procrastinate
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:12:32 And relax
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:13:42 Oh yay

*I t   u n l o a d e d*
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:13:47 the map
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:14:47 Remind me what the tutorial plane looks like again?
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:15:04 I have too much and tbh I just wanna do my own things till it ends
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:15:29 If only my brother knew how to school
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:15:33 Actually no
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:15:45 How to obey instructions *from me*
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:15:56 To be fair I do pull jokes on him
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:16:07 ~~such as the magic of Inspect Element (tm)~~
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:18:09 <@!437152336176087052> For me the Tetris metaphor still works
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:18:27 They keep sending it, but it starts off easy
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:18:39 Eventually as the game progresses, so is the difficulty
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:19:02 Waiting for the Plane Crazy UI to load
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:19:07 So I can unload my F-15 for now and do the trainer
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:19:25 <@!437152336176087052> Mine started this September
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 12:19:28 I bet it'll be quick paced
bot-central 2020-09-07 12:20:43 !servers
general 2020-09-07 12:21:47 I got confused when the VIP link said X16 savedata
general 2020-09-07 13:29:44 I'm starting to hate online classes as I have to deal with bs excuses
general 2020-09-07 13:30:05 Like my brother isn't supposed to be my responsibility yet here I am having to be his assistant
general 2020-09-07 14:26:48 I wanna take a break
general 2020-09-07 14:27:45 Get sheets of former tree
the-dump 2020-09-07 14:28:08 This is the dump
the-dump 2020-09-07 14:28:14 Where I see humans being humans
general 2020-09-07 14:29:16 Emotionally I feel like I will collapse like Rome
general 2020-09-07 14:29:53 Yes
general 2020-09-07 14:30:15 help me im dying becaue of my brother
general 2020-09-07 14:30:32 Limileme?
general 2020-09-07 14:30:43 Yes
general 2020-09-07 14:30:51 I'll just go onto YouTube
plane-crazy 2020-09-07 21:44:35 <@645128367611445248> Wait, he the guy that call anything good at PvP meta?
general 2020-09-08 03:33:47 Sounds stupid
general 2020-09-08 03:33:48 I love it
general 2020-09-08 03:38:09 ah yes
general 2020-09-08 03:38:13 screen tearing
general 2020-09-08 03:38:20 Why is Roblox giving me screen tearing
general 2020-09-08 03:41:15 I will go continue making trainer aircraft
general 2020-09-08 03:41:17 For bacons to use
general 2020-09-08 03:41:32 For I am that bored
general 2020-09-08 04:30:47 I did this as a trainer jet, it ended up being too sharp and too fast
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 04:33:52 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/752747745600602213 How come this basic plane ends up having too much performance, steering and speed wise (I blame throttling on the latter)
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 04:34:00 It's just a trainer
plane-crazy 2020-09-08 04:34:06 Yet it somehow outperforms my other planes
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 02:01:19 Isn't the plural of larva, larvae?
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 02:01:33 And I read
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 02:01:35 larvas
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 02:01:45 I'm just nitpicking here now xp
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 02:02:20 Gonna go find Verthox's build to downvote it
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 02:04:06 <@!488043585443332096> Needs more variety doesn't it?
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 02:04:40 And make it easier on high speed trains, more room for water vehicles and improve/add more areas for land vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 02:05:12 I did that on a dependent suspension on accident
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 02:05:46 Acted like a live axle, camber only changing when it can't compress any further
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 02:06:51 I'm not that much of a suspension designer so idk
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 02:09:00 Thinking about it none of my suspensions have camber change, still stayed straight
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 02:10:17 <@!645128367611445248> I think it'd be somewhat more of an achievement to have camber that doesn't end up making the wheels go flat
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 02:10:32 Basically, lying down on the ground
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 02:13:12 In real life, it does have benefits
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 02:13:35 But in a game like Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 02:14:31 It's pretty much a benefit that's not worth trying to control, it's not gonna add much to the handling of a car
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 02:17:56 https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8havrQ--1S8RLWTN_nfpwwYa3iU=/97x0:922x550/2050x1367/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/1494211/thinkpad_lead.jpg nub
general 2020-09-09 02:25:24 I wonder what it is though
general 2020-09-09 02:25:53 Also, apparently keyboards have nipples on them, used as a mini trackpad
general 2020-09-09 02:27:59 Don't do (Lenovo) Thinkpads still have them? Or are they only on old IBMs?
general 2020-09-09 02:28:15 oh
general 2020-09-09 02:28:30 ** **
general 2020-09-09 02:29:03 I'm still waiting for that one guy who's drawing Nevada
general 2020-09-09 02:29:37 I need to arrange my online class schedules
general 2020-09-09 02:30:09 <@456226577798135808> Meanwhile you can get more out of a rooted Android-based smartphone
general 2020-09-09 02:30:25 Yes, get a Samsung
general 2020-09-09 02:30:35 But root it to get rid of the bloatware
general 2020-09-09 02:30:44 Samsung is infamous for good hardware, bad software
general 2020-09-09 02:31:02 Realme, isn't that made by one of Xiaomi's compettitors?
general 2020-09-09 02:31:28 One thing I don't like about Xiaomi tbh is the lack of an expandable storage
general 2020-09-09 02:32:16 I heard my dad saying about buying me a 2 TB USB flash drive

That's a lot of room, so I'd immediately go make a Linux Mint live USB
general 2020-09-09 02:33:12 When he abuses, claim it as self-defense
general 2020-09-09 02:33:51 Speaking of which, anyone know what happened to Savoic?

general 2020-09-09 02:35:26 <@!582834773773254656> You are in China
general 2020-09-09 02:35:35 Oh understandable
general 2020-09-09 02:35:38 have a nice day
general 2020-09-09 02:36:00 We all know we live on a dinosaur
general 2020-09-09 02:36:07 Question is, where are we on the dinosaur?
general 2020-09-09 02:36:20 So that's why 2020 is shit
general 2020-09-09 02:36:39 It's the year of dino crap
general 2020-09-09 02:37:00 What if Mars was just another dinosaur?
general 2020-09-09 02:37:10 What if the solar system is one giant dinosaur
general 2020-09-09 02:37:21 ~~at least it ain't an anthropomorphic dinosaur~~
general 2020-09-09 02:37:49 SpaceX is just a program to explore the dinosaur
general 2020-09-09 02:38:29 So long after Elon Musk dies?
general 2020-09-09 02:38:41 Unless we somehow discovered the secret to extending your life
general 2020-09-09 02:38:57 <@!265819387498332160> Are you saying Mars is the head of a dinosaur?

general 2020-09-09 02:44:55 The wind fucks you
general 2020-09-09 02:45:01 With natural disasters
general 2020-09-09 02:45:18 goes the toilet
general 2020-09-09 02:46:11 <@456226577798135808> Is that an actual plane?
general 2020-09-09 02:46:55 <@!615876745710534676> ~~don't expose our pyramid scheme~~
general 2020-09-09 02:47:26 So don't put trees up in my yard?
general 2020-09-09 02:48:31 Pee is just fresh tea for trees
general 2020-09-09 02:48:55 **@​rickje139**
general 2020-09-09 02:49:35 Later already happened though
general 2020-09-09 02:49:59 Honda Racing Lawnmower
general 2020-09-09 02:50:16 ~~wait a honda racing lawnmower is just a mass grass killer~~
general 2020-09-09 02:50:34 It looks like they took the engines of an F-15
general 2020-09-09 02:50:39 And slapped it onto an F-22
general 2020-09-09 02:50:47 Or whatever plane has those squished engines
general 2020-09-09 02:51:12 imagine having a grim reaper pfp
general 2020-09-09 02:51:13 smh
general 2020-09-09 02:51:27 Flying lawnmower
general 2020-09-09 02:51:36 That totally doesn't sound familiar
general 2020-09-09 02:52:33 <@!363742162757877761> So flying lawnmowers with knock-off Russian fighters?
general 2020-09-09 02:53:48 This looks a lot like a helicopter I've seen before in Plane Crazy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr3ngmRuGUc
general 2020-09-09 02:53:56 Where literally it's rocket engines
general 2020-09-09 02:54:36 <@456226577798135808> I mean, the KAI TA-50 literally had Lockheed Martin's help
general 2020-09-09 02:54:45 The same people who designed the F-16
general 2020-09-09 02:55:03 Guessing they might've went the same route here
general 2020-09-09 02:55:40 In 2020, HoF are multi account builds
general 2020-09-09 02:56:08 In 2022, literally a giant house
general 2020-09-09 02:57:07 <@456226577798135808> Typical gameplay on Sega's After Burner
general 2020-09-09 02:57:34 ~~I know it's an arcade game, but how does a plane carry ***that*** many missiles~~
general 2020-09-09 02:58:06 F-14 Tomcat carry portals, so that's why it has so many missiles in that game
general 2020-09-09 02:58:31 The floor is lava
general 2020-09-09 02:58:58 Just wait until the winter event
general 2020-09-09 02:59:05 Technically you're not touching grass at that point
general 2020-09-09 02:59:10 You're touching water
general 2020-09-09 02:59:52 I mean it depends on how it's designed
general 2020-09-09 03:00:08 If it can be like a magnifying glass, then yes
general 2020-09-09 03:00:35 Because we need to reduce climate change
general 2020-09-09 03:00:40 So let's keep the topic like this
general 2020-09-09 03:00:43 We prefer this climate
general 2020-09-09 03:00:47 Don't change it
general 2020-09-09 03:01:10 <@!615876745710534676> But will the aliens want that nuclear waste?
general 2020-09-09 03:02:07 <@!287779983445721088> That looks like if a kid designed a plane
general 2020-09-09 03:02:28 1940s Dassault Mirage
general 2020-09-09 03:02:35 But it's trainer sized
general 2020-09-09 03:02:50 anyways see y'all later
general 2020-09-09 03:05:49 rifle with magazine
general 2020-09-09 03:06:22 I do not pro at the gun
general 2020-09-09 03:06:48 I have the case of bumpy brain, still needs wrinkling
general 2020-09-09 03:07:30 What if helicopters floated instead of have rotating rotors
general 2020-09-09 03:08:29 Aging is just coming closer to going back to the Earth
general 2020-09-09 03:09:25 <@456226577798135808> Does that mean I can make turboprop planes work in water if I try hard enough?

general 2020-09-09 03:12:00 ~~I gotta stop getting distracted by this chat~~
general 2020-09-09 03:12:14 <@!387195148741771275> "I remember the day I met your grandmother, young lad"
general 2020-09-09 03:12:52 "It was a real doozy, but you're too young for that"
general 2020-09-09 03:13:14 Wait hold on
general 2020-09-09 03:13:41 This has a totally different meaning now that we're not smol kids anymore https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBu_kDW3DOQ
general 2020-09-09 03:14:02 The animators did a sneaky on that one
general 2020-09-09 03:14:09 Just because Schnitzel doesn't really talk
general 2020-09-09 03:14:49 what if it hit mars
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 04:08:12 I found an NSFW truck in PC
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 04:08:30 Advertising an NSFW website
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 04:08:35 A very iconic one
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 04:08:53 I left, but I took a screenshot
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 04:09:29 Wait for potato connection on my PC to load Discord
general 2020-09-10 03:30:37 fell asleep
general 2020-09-10 03:30:50 i really needed that
general 2020-09-10 03:31:00 cringe?
general 2020-09-10 03:31:07 Understandable
general 2020-09-10 03:32:25 Still trying to find a way to make the back of an F-15
general 2020-09-10 03:32:39 I always seem to struggle with the plane's arse
general 2020-09-10 03:34:16 https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/strike-eagle2.gif Am I supposed to curve down on the back?
general 2020-09-10 03:34:45 Like make it slimmer near the engine
general 2020-09-10 03:35:38 It has two engines
general 2020-09-10 03:37:42 <@!615876745710534676> Maybe that's why Steve can build superstructures as a one man team, cube brain = big brain
general 2020-09-10 03:40:03 That terrain generation doesn't look right
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 03:43:28 Does vertical wings compromise roll speed?
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 03:43:42 I'm using them for air intakes
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 03:45:36 https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/strike-eagle.gif I see the engine bulge extends all the way near the wings

general 2020-09-10 03:46:51 Here we see a wild McDonald's tank
general 2020-09-10 03:47:56 The top looks like it's made out of rock while the bottom is  made out of grass
general 2020-09-10 03:48:08 wait that doesn't sound right
general 2020-09-10 03:49:27 Why is it grey
general 2020-09-10 04:03:42 I have now realized why people don't design engines this way (the one on the right)
https://streamable.com/t1446p
general 2020-09-10 04:03:51 The after burners would melt the fan blades
general 2020-09-10 04:04:39 Otherwise the one on the left is good enough for a Western style after burning turbofan
general 2020-09-10 04:04:46 Locked motors
general 2020-09-10 04:04:56 use the locc tower
general 2020-09-10 04:08:38 If the Russian definition of supermanuverability favours slow speed, close range
general 2020-09-10 04:08:45 Then does that mean stalling is actually encouraged
general 2020-09-10 04:08:59 To achieve their version of supermanuverability
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:15:56 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:16:13 ~~you probably know the size of typical planes here in PC by now~~
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:17:30 I find my aircraft stalling being weird
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:17:53 When I use my conveyor drive and suddenly pitch a 180 degrees, it still carries momentum from being supersonic
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:18:04 Kinda weird to see an aircraft travel backwards while in the air
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:19:57 Russian supermanuverability feels wonky for me
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:24:37 this server is indeed pain
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:24:40 Someone made a "tank"
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:24:48 Literally just a box with another box to trap people in
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:25:36 <@!505835349889777685> Didn't bother to picture the others https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/753461319331741718
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:25:54 It's generally in this style of default wheels for treads, literally just blocks
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:26:36 No it's McDonald's tank
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 04:30:49 <@!505835349889777685> Where is that?
general 2020-09-10 13:14:58 I see Fall Guys
general 2020-09-10 13:15:02 but it's anime girls
general 2020-09-10 13:16:07 Question, do Russian supermanuverable fighters use stalling to their benefit?
general 2020-09-10 13:16:46 <@!448505589983739914> Well, if that's the case then I'll keep the stalling on my previous plane
general 2020-09-10 13:17:23 Meanwhile the West has a different philosophy of supermanuverability, contrary to the Russian slow speed, close range kind
general 2020-09-10 13:17:31 So F-15 shouldn't do that
general 2020-09-10 13:18:40 Modern American planes are overrated in general
general 2020-09-10 13:19:08 Yet I still make them
general 2020-09-10 13:19:20 Depends on where it's applied
general 2020-09-10 13:19:57 Military turbofans have to consider after burners, performance and fuel usage, meanwhile commercial applications just need good mileage
general 2020-09-10 13:20:02 Because fuel saved = money
general 2020-09-10 13:21:09 <@!448505589983739914> Range is important in fighters, unless said plane's purpose is to be a short range interceptor
general 2020-09-10 13:21:43 With short range interceptors, be fast and have good climb rate
general 2020-09-10 13:23:00 Has YouTube made pre-jet age planes overrated yet?
general 2020-09-10 13:24:26 A lot of people have made the A-10, F-22 and F-35 in PC
general 2020-09-10 13:24:36 And I assume even the F-15, the one I'm building right now
general 2020-09-10 13:25:25 Germany is that one crazy person who managed to pull something off but ends up failing
general 2020-09-10 13:25:56 Anyways, gn
general 2020-09-10 13:26:33 <@456226577798135808> WW2 or WW1 Germany?
general 2020-09-10 13:26:44 Either way I wouldn't be surprised considering what kind of stuff they're into
general 2020-09-10 13:27:42 I don't know much with propeller era planes
general 2020-09-10 13:28:28 I'm even less surprised considering German dude was obsessed with wiping out a good number of the human race
general 2020-09-10 13:28:52 Lockheed made the most advanced airliner of it's time
general 2020-09-10 13:28:54 But failed
general 2020-09-10 13:29:23 I could understand airports not buying it, I heard their previous airliner was a dangerous disaster to ride in
general 2020-09-10 13:29:31 Anyways fr goodnight
general 2020-09-10 13:37:58 English Electric Lightning? Dornier Do-31 or that one British airliner that literally disintegrates mid-air?
general 2020-09-10 13:41:09 > is that supposed to be a rekt?
That oddly sounds a lot like what I'd hear from Fortnite
general 2020-09-10 13:41:50 No no
general 2020-09-10 13:41:55 It's Xbux
general 2020-09-10 13:42:14 Xbux 360, with free 360 bobux
general 2020-09-10 13:42:46 I just think it's something a 13 year old would say
general 2020-09-10 13:44:01 <@387195148741771275> I used to watch DanTDM a lot, then moved onto Markiplier and jacksepticeye, and eventually RTGame and GrayStillPlays
general 2020-09-10 13:45:34 Stupid ideas + A good personality = good YouTuber
general 2020-09-10 13:46:14 Always do the big dumb of ideas, they're interesting and unique
general 2020-09-10 13:47:30 Fidget spinners as a trend as died, it's back to its original purpose
general 2020-09-10 13:47:48 Dabbing, I don't get it
general 2020-09-10 13:48:28 <@387195148741771275> I mean I could understand kids fidgeting a toy under stress
general 2020-09-10 13:48:34 Otherwise, useless
general 2020-09-10 13:49:09 Who was that one YouTuber who was a sentient pasta with an annoying voice and both a lack of personality and intelligence
general 2020-09-10 13:49:22 I called him spaghetti hair and pimple balls
general 2020-09-10 13:50:07 <@456226577798135808> Same vibes as JayStation
general 2020-09-10 13:51:29 JayStation, touches on any subject and demonizes them 

I bet he also did anime, knowing him
general 2020-09-10 13:51:40 He's the cringy 3 AM demons video guy
general 2020-09-10 13:57:48 Here's an example of a JayStation video, at least from what I heard 

A 3 AM video involving furries. To summon one, apparently you cut your fingers and shove it up somewhere I must not say 

Then you got a slave and more cringe
general 2020-09-10 13:59:34 Oof
general 2020-09-10 13:59:39 Big oof
general 2020-09-10 14:00:43 <@387195148741771275> Well, there's a Wikipedia article for that 

I'm serious about that
general 2020-09-10 14:01:12 So go ahead and read up, if you want
general 2020-09-10 14:01:49 *We all die someday*
general 2020-09-10 14:02:08 *It only takes time before we're taken*
general 2020-09-10 14:02:52 Honestly, just exterminate the bad side of fandoms in general
general 2020-09-10 14:03:39 Your first site to find them is on Twitter
general 2020-09-10 14:04:10 Doesn't matter which fandoms, whether it be Undertale, furry or anime
general 2020-09-10 14:04:49 You know if I have to be honest I think there's three sides to each fandom
general 2020-09-10 14:04:56 The good, the bad and the weird
general 2020-09-10 14:06:34 <@387195148741771275> I mean if you think about it there's also weirdness in anime 

I'm not gonna discuss about the NSFW side, I mean to a normie what would they think of humanized dragon girls?
general 2020-09-10 14:06:55 Dragon girl maids?*
general 2020-09-10 14:07:23 I'm not  that into anime so I can't think up of any other example
general 2020-09-10 14:07:30 But yes, there is a dragon maid anime
general 2020-09-10 14:07:45 Not related to the furry fandom the way I see it
general 2020-09-10 14:07:52 More on the side of nekos
general 2020-09-10 14:08:16 Yes, and honestly if you want to escape into fantasy that's fine
general 2020-09-10 14:08:19 We all do that
general 2020-09-10 14:08:31 Aight, yousuf told us to stop
general 2020-09-10 14:08:39 So let's change the topic to something safer
general 2020-09-10 14:09:41 Ngl, looking back Teen Titans Go isn't that bad
general 2020-09-10 14:10:09 Early episodes weren't good
general 2020-09-10 14:10:50 <@444476246899032086> It easily entertains kids
general 2020-09-10 14:11:55 The only redeeming qualities is that it pokes fun of real life stuff, self awareness and stuff
general 2020-09-10 14:12:15 In referring to TT Go
general 2020-09-10 14:13:17 Like, the animators poking fun at how their fandom gets mad when they just want a break from the serious stuff 

Or poking fun at how Teen Titans Go keeps doing fart jokes
general 2020-09-10 14:14:07 Like I can respect the team behind TT Go for that, but it isn't the same as the original Teen Titans, they're nothing compared to the original
general 2020-09-10 14:14:41 The OG is where they really went full on in terms of animation, plot, and other stuff
general 2020-09-10 14:15:25 There's some *decent* ones, but still cringe
general 2020-09-10 14:16:20 Like that one episode they made fun of how the film industry, but it still has the childish exaggeration
general 2020-09-10 14:16:45 But what if I wanna stop being angry?
general 2020-09-10 14:16:51 It puts too much pressure onto me
general 2020-09-10 14:17:15 <@387195148741771275> Every Ben 10 before the reboot maintained the quality
general 2020-09-10 14:17:40 I'm tired of having to juggle many tasks
general 2020-09-10 14:17:51 I just wanna relax, even for a bit
general 2020-09-10 14:18:40 <@387195148741771275> There's the OG, Omniverse and everything in between
general 2020-09-10 14:19:08 Like anything after Omniverse is simplified for CN's kid audience
general 2020-09-10 14:19:54 I liked every series
general 2020-09-10 14:20:05 Ben 10 is usually good
general 2020-09-10 14:21:21 I liked the pre-monopoly era Disney and the Cartoon Network when they still experimented
general 2020-09-10 14:21:55 The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons, Kids Next Door, etc.
general 2020-09-10 14:22:46 <@723419054114865202> Try watching the ones before the 2019 reboot
general 2020-09-10 14:23:34 <@387195148741771275> Wait if Ben 10 can make diamonds, why doesn't he try getting rich from it?
general 2020-09-10 14:24:13 Still, knowing him he'd be getting all those Sumo Slammer cards
general 2020-09-10 14:24:19 And games
general 2020-09-10 14:24:30 Speaking of games, remembered when he got into his game?
general 2020-09-10 14:25:07 And Gwen actually had magic
general 2020-09-10 14:25:14 ***m a g i c***
general 2020-09-10 14:25:24 Literally pink
general 2020-09-10 14:25:43 Cat shirt
general 2020-09-10 14:25:50 Luck and magic
general 2020-09-10 14:26:02 A Protogen
general 2020-09-10 14:26:09 Orange hair too
general 2020-09-10 14:26:33 I remembered that one episode that involved swapping bodies
general 2020-09-10 14:26:51 I'm watching Dexter's Lab, good nostalgia
general 2020-09-10 14:27:13 <@370594904268734464> What was his name again?
general 2020-09-10 14:27:21 Red Med...
general 2020-09-10 14:27:30 ***Red Med Redemption***
general 2020-09-10 14:27:50 I'm not sorry
general 2020-09-10 14:28:01 That was too much of a pun to avoid
general 2020-09-10 14:28:45 What do y'all think of the CGI movie? And the live action one?
general 2020-09-10 14:28:52 I prefer when it was animated
general 2020-09-10 14:30:22 Good plot, good presentation, what else is needed for a movie?
general 2020-09-10 14:31:28 I mean, you were a kid
general 2020-09-10 14:31:35 I liked it when I was a kid
general 2020-09-10 14:31:54 I like the Ducktales reboot
general 2020-09-10 14:32:08 Disney did a good job
general 2020-09-10 14:32:21 Compared to Cartoon Network's own reboots
general 2020-09-10 14:32:27 Sorta just made them childish
general 2020-09-10 14:32:44 Like original content, Cartoon Network knows how to do that
general 2020-09-10 14:32:55 But reboots, it's a hit or miss
general 2020-09-10 14:33:37 I should go sleep
general 2020-09-10 14:34:03 I remember playing Madness on Newgrounds when I was like 6?
general 2020-09-10 14:34:24 First game I played is Need For Speed though
general 2020-09-10 14:34:36 So glad I grew up with NFS Underground 2
general 2020-09-10 14:34:45 Same olin
general 2020-09-10 14:34:49 I remember PvZ
general 2020-09-10 14:35:02 PvZ is also good
general 2020-09-10 14:35:26 Pretty much before the latter half of the 2010s games were good
general 2020-09-10 14:35:42 Now good games are being provided by smaller developers and of course Valve
general 2020-09-10 14:35:51 Valve won't hurt us with bad content
general 2020-09-10 14:36:08 ~~maybe on steam when you find a badly downvoted game~~
general 2020-09-10 14:36:44 But still, Valve knows gamers more than most big name companies do
general 2020-09-10 14:37:00 Definitely better than EA
general 2020-09-10 14:37:17 Epic's fine, I mean they provided us the tools to make games 

Unreal Engine
general 2020-09-10 14:37:30 Like they let the public have access to it
general 2020-09-10 14:37:43 Too bad Apple banned anything Epic related
general 2020-09-10 14:37:48 Anyways, good night
general 2020-09-10 23:55:00 What are the odds
general 2020-09-10 23:55:57 Well, now it looks kinda barren
general 2020-09-10 23:57:08 Oof, Cookie go bye bye
general 2020-09-10 23:57:43 Why does crazy mustache man do the big experiment?
general 2020-09-10 23:59:37 What stuff came from WW2 Germany?
general 2020-09-10 23:59:49 Didn't they made a rocket powered plane too?
general 2020-09-11 00:00:11 Like a literal rocket powered plane
general 2020-09-11 00:00:37 And Maus, like what's the point of a superheavy if it's too heavy
general 2020-09-11 00:00:48 Or too big, or too slow
general 2020-09-11 00:01:02 Apart from being a moving weaponized bunker
general 2020-09-11 00:01:48 Imagine Plane Crazy but terrain generation
general 2020-09-11 00:02:36 Doesn't Minecrafr use something called Perlin noise to generate it's terrain?
general 2020-09-11 00:02:55 Can we call it magic noise
general 2020-09-11 00:03:21 Make the railways optimized for high speed trains
general 2020-09-11 00:03:38 Like the Shinkansen (or whatever its called)
general 2020-09-11 00:04:07 Make beeg water
general 2020-09-11 00:04:11 For sheeps
general 2020-09-11 00:04:15 And soobs
general 2020-09-11 00:04:59 <@456238251204935690> You have one for each day
general 2020-09-11 00:05:23 365 cookies
general 2020-09-11 00:05:35 My battery do the die
general 2020-09-11 00:06:14 It's 🌲 percent
general 2020-09-11 00:06:26 Fish powered battery, is that what Nokia uses?
general 2020-09-11 00:07:04 <@656137684213039124> Why did I immediately thought of Windows XP
general 2020-09-11 00:07:30 Eventually you'll get Windows XP
general 2020-09-11 00:08:44 <@456238251204935690> If the trees are Vietnamese then where's fvlvia's tank?
general 2020-09-11 00:08:53 The ***0W0*** tank
general 2020-09-11 00:09:34 oh neat 1% battery
general 2020-09-11 00:09:44 I'mma yeet off now
general 2020-09-11 00:09:59 Make lakes
general 2020-09-11 01:07:57 Trying out Arctic Monkeys for the first time
general 2020-09-11 01:08:03 I don't really listen to music that much
general 2020-09-11 01:08:30 <@!656137684213039124> The Roblox Lands
general 2020-09-11 01:14:08 <@456226577798135808> Try finding the real life wall of spam
general 2020-09-11 01:14:44 Yes that exists
general 2020-09-11 01:14:46 A literal wall of can of spams
general 2020-09-11 01:15:40 Well, see that can of spam
general 2020-09-11 01:15:48 Now stack them into making a great wall
general 2020-09-11 01:19:37 In real life, it's actually pretty safe to be in the back of a plane
general 2020-09-11 01:19:56 ~~besides when was the last time a plane crashed on it's back~~
general 2020-09-11 01:20:00 I forgot when I joined tbh
general 2020-09-11 01:20:52 I played Minecaft since 1.5-1.6
general 2020-09-11 01:21:14 Stuwupowod

general 2020-09-11 01:31:49 Crush yourself
general 2020-09-11 01:32:30 How long can a person last adding ~ to the end of every sentence until they get told off
general 2020-09-11 01:33:02 <@456226577798135808> <#609442446249820211> <#705941616199991307>
general 2020-09-11 01:33:23 Now fall
general 2020-09-11 01:33:46 <@!720891502108344360> What if Apple released a cup
general 2020-09-11 01:34:14 I mean Apple made a trash can
general 2020-09-11 01:34:22 At least a computer that looks like a trash can
general 2020-09-11 01:34:56 XD
general 2020-09-11 01:34:59 I'm glad that exists
general 2020-09-11 01:35:23 Spell imp
general 2020-09-11 01:35:36 yes you are
general 2020-09-11 01:35:58 I pee orange juice
general 2020-09-11 01:37:17 I have an idea

general 2020-09-11 01:38:25 Here's a little fun fact

Apple made a free and open source OS, named Darwin
general 2020-09-11 01:38:37 They also made a console with Bandai, called the Pippin

general 2020-09-11 01:41:04 Huh, since when did Thailand got into a war?
general 2020-09-11 01:42:11 Neutral until Japanese occupation
general 2020-09-11 01:42:19 That's what Wikipedia says at least
general 2020-09-11 01:44:42 What do y'all think of this line from Spongebob

"If I'm lucky, Mr. Talent will rub his tentacles on my art"
general 2020-09-11 01:45:22 okay

general 2020-09-11 01:49:21 Send to Gamer Thailand's server "Alt F4" to open Plane Crazy cheats
general 2020-09-11 01:50:09 Remember when it used to be 4/20/20? (Assuming you're on MM/DD/YY)
general 2020-09-11 01:51:00 4/20/2020, oof only three 20s
general 2020-09-11 01:51:03 Not four twenties
general 2020-09-11 01:51:28 I have normal PC
general 2020-09-11 01:51:36 I am on cat heater
general 2020-09-11 01:51:39 AKA laptop
general 2020-09-11 01:51:53 AKA a Celeron based netbook
general 2020-09-11 01:52:18 A decent Ryzen and Radeon is enough to play most games decently
general 2020-09-11 01:52:40 ~~there's no such thing as too much storage~~
general 2020-09-11 01:53:02 Is Linux still not as good as Windows for  gaming, or is it decent?
general 2020-09-11 01:53:51 <@!363742162757877761> You have an Intel Core series
general 2020-09-11 01:54:00 The i Series of CPUs
general 2020-09-11 01:55:07 <@!656137684213039124> Hmm, have you taken advantage of those purple areas to fill water with?
general 2020-09-11 01:56:09 I need to eat
general 2020-09-11 01:56:26 I won't eat Touched
general 2020-09-11 01:56:30 oh wait
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 01:56:57 If American planes are overrated
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 01:57:02 Jet planes at least
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 01:57:13 Then how much of them are usually bad builds?
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 01:57:57 I'm making an F-15, using a blueprint as reference
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 01:58:10 Haven't ate lunch, I should really eat now

plane-crazy 2020-09-11 02:25:27 <@!583801306871758848> They only have three people in the reports team (in-game)
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 02:25:36 Only one of them actually is free to moderate
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 02:25:44 mad wants nothing with PC anymore
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 02:25:48 Rick is busy being a developer
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 02:26:06 And the other one, I'm not sure
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 02:26:24 With the lack of people on the team, I can see why reports is closed
general 2020-09-11 02:27:13 What if cutters had a maximum speed before taking damage?
general 2020-09-11 02:27:39 And the faster it goes, the more it gets destroyed
general 2020-09-11 02:28:10 Which makes ultra-fast shredders not viable, and slower shredders being vulnerable to being an easy target or being outrunned
general 2020-09-11 02:29:24 It's raining spaghettification
general 2020-09-11 02:29:32 Not bad
general 2020-09-11 02:30:02 I tend to make my wings 8 blocks in length
general 2020-09-11 02:30:20 Works for most jet fighters (at least for me)
general 2020-09-11 02:30:42 224jay uses trails for after burners
general 2020-09-11 02:30:48 It actually looks pretty good
general 2020-09-11 02:31:05 I did it too, and it really does look good
general 2020-09-11 02:31:20 So I should learn from jay
general 2020-09-11 02:31:46 Wedge 2 category
general 2020-09-11 02:34:37 I just realized how stupid some of my brother's classmates are
general 2020-09-11 02:34:55 Like literally the only thing they wanna do is play Fortnite and do stupid noises
general 2020-09-11 02:36:29 I'm currently assisting him in his classes, so I definitely know they're doing that
general 2020-09-11 02:39:33 Are there laptops with backlit keyboards?
general 2020-09-11 02:43:36 I feel like motor locks wouldn't affect much in strength if designed well, though due to throttling might get affected in speed
general 2020-09-11 02:44:12 <@!163143541160148992> They do, helped me with my cars, my bus and planes
general 2020-09-11 02:44:38 Finally can add the engine bulge the F-15 Strike Eagle has because motor locc
general 2020-09-11 02:45:00 wood has entered the chat
general 2020-09-11 02:46:06 I feel like motor locks could add strength at least in some areas, for example TNT armor, wing protection, etc.
general 2020-09-11 02:46:36 I live in the Philippines, we have a duopoly in our internet service providers

general 2020-09-11 03:06:51 Or a DS if you want
general 2020-09-11 03:07:10 The Game Boy Advance actually has videos on it
general 2020-09-11 03:07:57 If I remember someone did high resolution 3D on the Game Boy Advance(d)
general 2020-09-11 03:10:28 I'm searching the YouTube channel
general 2020-09-11 03:11:50 <@!347182144873037824> I'm too lazy to find it, have this instead https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuhdamEsqeM
general 2020-09-11 03:12:36 Fully fledged 3D, on a system that's as powerful as the SNES
general 2020-09-11 03:35:59 I'm a little confused as to how someone would guess this is an F-35
general 2020-09-11 03:36:34 Me neither, I don't get how
general 2020-09-11 03:37:59 https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/strike-eagle2.gif As you can see, doesn't even resemble the F-35
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 03:42:18 engine bulge too tiny
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 03:42:29 needs more length
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 03:43:03 I'm using a combination of rocket engines and jet engines
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 03:43:14 Like in Ren's F-14
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 03:43:54 I still haven't attached the jet engines though
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 03:48:38 I still went for the easier route
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 03:49:01 I'm lazy by nature
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 03:51:06 I don't get it
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 03:51:12 Luke
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 03:55:14 The way I motor locked, finally can add conformal fuel tanks
general 2020-09-11 04:11:48 Would it be normal if a plane barely falls?
general 2020-09-11 04:11:55 Like it's fall is way too slow
general 2020-09-11 04:12:31 The chat ded
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 04:13:22 The FBI in his name stands up Federal Bacon International
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 04:17:43 <@!508326311044055052> Don't worry, idiots aren't aware that they themselves are idiots
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 04:19:31 "In the field of psychology, the Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability. It is related to the cognitive bias of illusory superiority and comes from the inability of people to recognize their lack of ability. Without the self-awareness of metacognition, people cannot objectively evaluate their competence or incompetence."

It isn't rare to see a person on Plane Crazy who fits well into the effect
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 04:22:33 It's fun to fight fire with fire
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 04:22:45 Or in this case, trash
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 04:24:44 he spawned the big nsfw
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 04:24:57 You should probably remove that before a mod sees it
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 04:26:20 Stop reminding me this scene exists in Spongebob

plane-crazy 2020-09-11 04:29:48 Where did R15 and R5 got their names anyways?
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 04:30:33 So like Roblox 5? and Roblox 15?
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 04:30:38 Could also mean revision
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 04:30:49 But I think the moving parts count is better
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 04:31:36 We never talk about the players whose whole body is R15 but has R6 legs
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 04:31:44 Those are mutants born from Chenorbyl
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 04:31:52 Anyways, classes gotta start
plane-crazy 2020-09-11 04:32:02 ~~also realistic human avatars are cursed~~
general 2020-09-11 12:43:59 Hello Nissan Leaf
general 2020-09-11 12:44:40 There's someone who's actually named MotorLockChan
general 2020-09-11 12:44:57 oh wait it's just our local goose
general 2020-09-11 12:47:36 YouTube is trying so hard to do everything
general 2020-09-11 12:48:04 Diversity as a business practice is good
general 2020-09-11 12:48:22 But YouTube is really making themselves look like try-hards
general 2020-09-11 12:49:36 Parents are too lazy to use YouTube Kids
We already have Spotify for music, try harder YouTube
YouTube Gaming, glorified filter
general 2020-09-11 12:49:53 YouTube Premium, I guess it's fine but not really needed

general 2020-09-11 12:53:07 <@!387195148741771275> wait dog has dog
general 2020-09-11 12:53:16 ~~is this slavery?~~
general 2020-09-11 12:53:43 How is this attached to the rocket engine? Well at least it's pretty convenient
general 2020-09-11 12:54:10 Hot dog eats a hotdog during a BBQ, while eating with a dog

dog dog dog
general 2020-09-11 12:55:02 Don't think too much about the sentence I made, there might be regrets
general 2020-09-11 12:55:21 "brocculu"
general 2020-09-11 12:55:30 ble
general 2020-09-11 12:55:30 hmm yes vegeta
general 2020-09-11 12:55:59 I just realized something, why are they both named after vegetables?
general 2020-09-11 12:56:36 Ka*karot* and *Vegeta*(ble)
general 2020-09-11 12:57:20 ***G a y m m u n i s m***
general 2020-09-11 12:58:19 I dunno, but this is literally a gay tank
general 2020-09-11 12:58:40 This is from the same person who made the communist tank
general 2020-09-11 12:59:32 Germany likes it's big cats
general 2020-09-11 13:00:16 ~~so wait does that mean their tanks are afraid of water?~~
||yes im aware big cats aren't afraid of water but just roll with it||
general 2020-09-11 13:01:06 Okay now this  is just an abomination in tank design
general 2020-09-11 13:01:46 yes u
general 2020-09-11 13:01:53 Just look at that short, stubby barrel
general 2020-09-11 13:01:57 That's the most obvious thing
general 2020-09-11 13:02:13 I'm also bothered by the proportions of it
general 2020-09-11 13:02:22 Like how is the turret bigger than the body?
general 2020-09-11 13:03:08 The turret also doesn't look right, shape wise
general 2020-09-11 13:03:29 this tank? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliment_Voroshilov_tank
general 2020-09-11 13:04:03 The Wikipedia page is the tank series
general 2020-09-12 00:40:11 I'm guessing Rick found a way to add videos
general 2020-09-12 00:41:48 The chat is uncontrolled chaos sometimes
general 2020-09-12 00:45:52 Why does the KV-2 have some ridiculous proportions?
general 2020-09-12 00:46:16 Like it looks like it has more turret than body, yet it has a short, stubby barrel
general 2020-09-12 00:57:31 Well, the US did convinced companies to not supply for Chinese tech, especially Huawei, so that shows how much power the US still has
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 02:48:42 Tested my F-15 today
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 02:49:03 It's a bit unstable, and I'm artificially preventing it from nosediving
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 02:49:40 But otherwise, I'm surprised it didn't get throttled by the servers
bot-central 2020-09-12 03:02:24 !vipservers
bot-central 2020-09-12 03:02:27 !servers
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:47:59 I tried my best performing plane again
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:48:11 It gets a speed of 12 000 SPS before it reaches a physical limit
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:48:21 At half that speed, the conveyor drive pitching is still controllable
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:48:29 Within lower speeds, there's not even any pitching at all
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:48:56 <@!448505589983739914> I see two rails, that a railgun?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:49:26 oh wait
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:49:34 That's for a ship isn't it?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:51:26 
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:51:27 
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:51:35 I remember making this, a plane but for noobs
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:52:25 A minor amount of motor lock, teaches keyboard controls and usage of wedges, and of course rocket spam
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:53:11 It only reaches a speed of 530 but it's steering is sharp
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:54:55 
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:54:56 
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:55:00 I'm almost done with this
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 08:55:07 almost
general 2020-09-12 10:00:12 Mustard released a new video today
general 2020-09-12 10:00:27 This time about a monster of a helicopter built by the Soviets
general 2020-09-12 10:01:13 Because of course the Soviets would build something like that
general 2020-09-12 10:01:48 <@444476246899032086> My classmates use their handkerchief to actually whip people with it
general 2020-09-12 10:02:00 It actually hurts a bit
general 2020-09-12 10:02:28 Only works with thin cloth handkerchieves though
general 2020-09-12 10:02:41 Thick cloth ones don't provide as much whipping power
general 2020-09-12 10:03:22 I should probably look up how gliders work if I want to make a paper airplane fly better
general 2020-09-12 10:03:39 The gliders based on planes, not the simple hang type one
general 2020-09-12 10:06:27 I have dumb idea
general 2020-09-12 10:06:35 Paper airplane but it's a "bomber"
general 2020-09-12 10:07:08 Add more planes and throw it at someone specific
general 2020-09-12 10:07:13 There you got King Kong
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 10:08:01 I don't really use Reddit that much
general 2020-09-12 10:08:37 Remember 

Shredders can't build
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 10:08:53 I only use a few subreddits anyways
general 2020-09-12 10:09:18 We really need Rick to add HP to cuttets
general 2020-09-12 10:09:24 Cutters*
general 2020-09-12 10:09:50 So high speed shredders end up destroying themselves while low speed shredders end up just being a minor nuisance
general 2020-09-12 10:10:07 And possibly to add more skill to the gene pool
general 2020-09-12 10:14:10 Rick should add a ranked tutorial section
general 2020-09-12 10:14:23 Where there's beginner, moderate and advanced
general 2020-09-12 10:15:01 Oof
general 2020-09-12 10:17:35 Is that on desktop only?
general 2020-09-12 10:18:54 Well, is it available on mobile too?
general 2020-09-12 10:19:46 I'm fine tbh
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 10:20:11 Cutters having HP when?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 10:20:25 So shredders self-destruct upon use
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 10:20:36 At least with high enough speeds anyways
general 2020-09-12 10:21:24 Sometimes I see Hofung's PFP as an otamatone
general 2020-09-12 10:22:18 I'm too lazy to learn how to swashplate
general 2020-09-12 10:22:37 <@448505589983739914> Wait isn't Mindustry actually on mobile?
general 2020-09-12 10:22:48 Maybe that's what I was thinking of
general 2020-09-12 10:23:24 Cool
general 2020-09-12 10:23:32 Also, Indigo made the flying island
general 2020-09-12 10:24:16 You know that flying island in PC? The one with a house, runway and a rickroll
general 2020-09-12 10:24:38 My arse can only afford free xp
general 2020-09-12 10:26:10 Is it me or is there a trend of military on Roblox in general?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 10:27:00 <@286793767162347521> Make a banana fighter too
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 10:27:09 Actually, just make a banana military line of vehicles
general 2020-09-12 10:27:23 Plane Crazy is the only place its good
general 2020-09-12 10:27:34 Because you actually frickin build it
general 2020-09-12 10:28:18 Military RP can succ
general 2020-09-12 10:28:26 Uhhh...
general 2020-09-12 10:28:35 I actually can't think up of any dumb jokes
general 2020-09-12 10:28:44 All I had in mind were peace treaties
general 2020-09-12 10:31:14 I probably already have enough games tbh
general 2020-09-12 11:28:11 I heard there exists a Mig-25 turned into a VIP transport
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 01:57:25 Do I need 5x5 wheels for a double wishbone or can I get away with 3x3 wheels by attempting to do portal axles
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_axle>
general 2020-09-13 01:58:13 Do double wishbones with 3x3 wheels exist?
general 2020-09-13 01:58:29 Oh, I was thinking of doing this https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/754521085071851562
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 02:01:24 oof only 5x5 double wishbones exist
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 02:04:41 Maybe I should try taking what I learned from my trailing arm suspension
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 02:05:13 As well as watching Prototrode's explanation of suspensions
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 02:05:22 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YudXITSozC4
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 02:05:31 I'm too lazy to reverse engineer their previous suspensions
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 02:07:39 suspension would be the next thing to do while I take a break from planes
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 02:10:02 I'm just bored and wanted to do something else
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 02:15:56 I'm just doing what worked, experimentation
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 02:16:59 I don't even know
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 02:17:15 All I've learned is to make a trailing arm
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 02:38:23 What if there was a suspension engineer role
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 02:58:26 I still don't get how people make complex double wishbones
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 02:58:34 The kind with plenty of fine tuning available
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 02:59:01 I also don't find it easy to control camber on double wishbones
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:04:04 I'll go take a look at Prototrode's tutorials again
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:04:26 One of the few Plane Crazy YouTubers that bother with actually explaining the technical stuff
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:05:02 I usually prefer tutorials that explain technical concepts, rather than tutorials that show you how to build a certain plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:05:49 yes
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:05:54 now back to how to suspension
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:07:12 <@!335599526414909451> That is a brainfuck of a motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:07:14 And I love it
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:07:40 Speaking of brainfuck, that's an actual programming language
general 2020-09-13 03:08:01 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck
general 2020-09-13 03:08:07 this exists
general 2020-09-13 03:08:40 <@!447221768520859659> wait I notice the lack of rudders
general 2020-09-13 03:09:52 "FREE CANDY"
I think this kind of build is starting to get on my nerves now
general 2020-09-13 03:10:11 Like sir you came into my plot without consent
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:13:06 Now I'm having a brainfuck examining Proto's anti wheel wobble
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:29:07 All I'm experiencing is constant confusion
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:29:31 <@!387195148741771275> Just an anti wheel wobble mechanism in his suspension
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:29:57 Suspensions confuse me

plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:30:20 this is the only one i built
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:30:29 that is actually half decent
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:34:49 me trying to understand is just like me when I was new to planes
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:41:57 Y'all underestimate the lengths of which my stupdity can travel to
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:42:10 It already has went into Mars far before Elon Musk even thought of SpaceX
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:46:53 <@!437152336176087052> You said made a suspension that glides over terrain too well right?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:47:03 ***Citroen would like to know your location***
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:47:42 ||https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropneumatic_suspension||
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:49:04 I know
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:49:14 But a suspension that glides too well over terrain
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:49:30 Well that would immediately remind me of the quality of Citroen's hydropneumatic suspension
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:59:47 I use the power of towers
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 04:00:58 Unfortunately, it has artificial pitch stability instead of passive wing based pitch stability
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 04:01:17 So while it doesn't nose dive/pitch-up, the artificial stability does put a limit on the conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 04:01:23 Though it does experience less throttling
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 04:01:35 Still is way slower than 12K
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 04:01:40 Or even just 6K
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 04:03:45 oof
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 04:04:00 I also used stalling to my advantage to achieve Russian supermanuverabilty on my Flanker
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 04:04:52 
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 04:04:52 
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 04:05:03 The chonkier one has actual supermanuverability
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 04:05:20 The decent looking one experiences a case of server throttling
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 04:05:24 Which means slow by default
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 04:06:02 Should I try making a Flanker again?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 04:08:42 Thanks
general 2020-09-13 04:09:44 Is the secret to getting conveyor drives to do five figures (for example, 10,000 sps) extreme fine tuning and no artificial stability?
general 2020-09-13 04:10:41 Oof
general 2020-09-13 04:11:34 <@!287779983445721088> As in the Ford Motor Company? Company behind cars like the Ford GT40, Ford Raptor, Mustang, etc.
general 2020-09-13 04:12:39 This is the only plane from them I know https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Trimotor
general 2020-09-13 04:13:22 oof i am the big stupid for assuming it's a plane because aerospace
general 2020-09-13 04:14:29 That's because it is related to German planes from what I remember
general 2020-09-13 04:15:00 "The Ford Trimotor was a development of previous designs by William Bushnell Stout, using structural principles copied from the work of Professor Hugo Junkers, the noted German all-metal aircraft design pioneer, and adapted to an airframe very similar to the Fokker F.VII - even using the same airfoil cross section at the wing root. "
general 2020-09-13 04:15:43 I mean it already says Junkers and Fokker in there
general 2020-09-13 04:15:47 ~~haha fokker~~
general 2020-09-13 04:16:30 I should probably build a revised Flanker
general 2020-09-13 04:16:39 Comparing it to the F-15 I just built
general 2020-09-13 04:16:53 It looks like it has chubby cheeks, and of course solving the physics throttling issue it has
general 2020-09-13 04:17:01 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/754553157341675520/RobloxScreenShot20200913_120435759.png
general 2020-09-13 04:19:15 Still, Ford did a decent job with their own planes
general 2020-09-13 04:20:27 Wait it is?
general 2020-09-13 04:21:49 Reading the Wikipedia article, it doesn't say that much bad stuff about the Ford
general 2020-09-13 04:23:46 Everyone knows about the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar right?
general 2020-09-13 04:24:08 How come it's regarded as top of the line and safe when not too long ago (relative to the TriStar) there was the Electra
general 2020-09-13 04:27:24 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil_V-12 lorge helicooper

general 2020-09-13 04:29:39 The ridiculousness of the idea
general 2020-09-13 04:29:41 I wanna build it
general 2020-09-13 04:46:15 Oops my universe crashed

general 2020-09-13 04:46:38 *says the Super Why OC*
general 2020-09-13 04:47:38 My F15 goes 530 without conveyor drives
general 2020-09-13 04:48:10 If I remember v2/v3 of my Flan jet achieves somewhere above 600 without one
general 2020-09-13 04:48:17 Flanker*
general 2020-09-13 04:48:27 My keyboard is hungry so it wants flan

1.) Leave the game and jump into another server, the in-game reports are closed as stated within their respective channels 

2.) Delete the image as you might be warned by the mods for publicly posting offensive German imagery

general 2020-09-13 09:11:57 I had my hopes high that when I heard there were promo codes on Roblox

general 2020-09-13 09:12:08 But it was actually just items
general 2020-09-13 09:12:20 Rick should make PC merch
general 2020-09-13 09:12:26 Like motor hat
general 2020-09-13 09:13:10 Random question, which is the superior pet?

Dogs, cats or birds?
general 2020-09-13 09:13:22 <@!387195148741771275> Make motor body set
general 2020-09-13 09:13:33 Motor torso, motor limbs, motor head, motor hat, motor shoulder pet
general 2020-09-13 09:14:07 I'll call the whole set "Motor-motor", totally not gonna get sued by Dreamworks

general 2020-09-13 09:16:23 but seriously rick
general 2020-09-13 09:16:27 motor merch, for motor money
general 2020-09-13 09:16:39 Motor merch = motor money
general 2020-09-13 09:16:49 money = good
general 2020-09-13 09:17:07 Rick, you should really try getting extra income
general 2020-09-13 09:17:16 <@!582598719916998692> Without context that sounded so bad
general 2020-09-13 09:26:56 what am i doing to this "double wishbone"
general 2020-09-13 09:29:49 I should probably simplify this suspension
general 2020-09-13 09:30:38 This is the Jaguar IRS https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Jaguar_IRS_coloured_diagram.png
general 2020-09-13 09:30:43 Independent Rear Suspension
general 2020-09-13 09:30:54 I think I may have been overcomplicating my suspension

general 2020-09-13 09:36:32 I noticed those tips at the rudders and thought of T-tail

general 2020-09-13 09:36:46 A T-tail with elevators
general 2020-09-13 09:36:55 So it has 4 horizontal stabilizers
general 2020-09-13 09:37:20 Works for me
general 2020-09-13 09:37:41 I only get my plane engineering knowledge from one channel

general 2020-09-13 12:08:42 G18, isn't that the one with the caseless ammunition?
general 2020-09-13 12:09:28 Still that pistol be looking like a cheap uzi with such a long magazine
general 2020-09-13 12:10:46 Looks fancy
general 2020-09-13 12:11:19 I only think of two companies when I think of revolvers
general 2020-09-13 12:11:27 Smith & Wesson and Colt
general 2020-09-13 12:12:19 I'm gonna search Ren's tutorial on suspension, to get a better idea of how suspensions work
general 2020-09-13 12:12:38 That is the way I have been used to, ever since my Minecraft days
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:13:19 Watching Ren's suspensions
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:14:58 It's a nice beam axle
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:15:09 wait a minute
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:25:14 it's firing pasta
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:28:23 Should I make a CAS plane by adding lots of bombs and TNT armor
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:28:52 How good are forward swept wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:29:07 Like how good are forward swept wings when flying in PC?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:30:11 <@456226577798135808> Didn't you have forward swept wings? Do they fly better than conventional deltas/backward swept wings?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:30:33 Other than looking different
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:30:53 Should I attempt to just make a fighter without any references? Just my imagination
general 2020-09-13 12:32:43 How many people here have made custom fighters?
general 2020-09-13 12:35:32 <@!615876745710534676> Is it worth the effort building?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:36:30 smol brain unde
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:37:09 I might think of building a custom fighter tbh
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:37:56 Though I might think of keeping it not too difficult of a task for me
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:39:48 If I were to be a plane designer, what would I consider
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:50:37 I cringed at my old planes
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:50:58 I just realized how ugly they really look like
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:51:50 <@!437152336176087052> How did you even learn how to make good suspension?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:52:32 I also learned the hard way camber is actually harder than it looks
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:52:50 Especially on suspensions such as double wishbones, where the wheel has to have camber change
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:53:02 <@!437152336176087052> Wait wdym backward?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:55:22 Meanwhile I'm trying to figure out how to make a decent functioning suspension
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:55:36 Yet the best I can come up with is literally to just copy Prototrode's suspension
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:56:04 <@!437152336176087052> Is that a video about types of suspensions?

general 2020-09-13 12:56:23 w a n g s
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:56:53 If I have to be honest, what's the point of a swing axle in PC?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:57:39 I am again having a brainfuck trying to comprehend this at first glance
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:58:47 I'm still trying to make a suspension
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:58:53 Yet I have no idea what I'm doing
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:59:26 Even my older trailing arm has better ride quality than this
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:59:47 I am assuming you are cringing in how bad I am
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:00:14 Like I can't even build one without relying on a tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:00:19 At least in memory
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:01:16 I've posted a suspension in <#384025409945337856>, just a simple trailing arm that you can use as tank suspension too
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:01:35 Literally just tank suspension that's adjustable and somewhat compact
general 2020-09-13 13:02:06 <@!577604979909459989> That looks like a fence
general 2020-09-13 13:02:39 Well, I could always give it a shot
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:03:02 The tank suspension is literally the only thing I understand
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:03:10 Anything more advanced than that and my brain dies
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:03:18 Which is surprising given my history with planes
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:03:43 3 folders both with body and wings, yet I can't even make a suspension
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:04:27 I use horizontal springs
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:04:36 They're compact
general 2020-09-13 13:05:07 Aluminum alloys?
general 2020-09-13 13:05:21 Can we make that sextuple plane in PC
general 2020-09-13 13:05:24 But add rocket engines to it
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:06:04 <@!437152336176087052> Apart from being obsessed and a lot of dedication, what else do you do to learn suspension engineering?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:06:29 that be smooth
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:07:32 If I could make my trailing arms be that smooth with four wheels while capable of carrying heavy weight while maintaining it's adjustable height, I think I'm fine with just doing things simple
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:07:56 Right now, the trailing arm I used can't even lift a bus xp
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:08:53 I should probably try to make a new goal with suspensions
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:09:04 Make them buttery smooth yet heavy duty and adjustable
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:09:41 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:09:48 Did that
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:10:10 Heavy duty though, I can't seem to figure that out with four wheels only
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:10:47 I should probably go try to make planes now
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:10:58 Because that's what I'm used to doing and I think I'm still not good enough
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:11:47 Bellcrank, isn't that the kind used in pull/pushrods?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:13:16 I think I'll just go back to trying to get good with planes for now
general 2020-09-13 14:51:34 I see two expert robotic specialists fighting over here
general 2020-09-13 14:52:37 I mean it's a tutorial that demonstrates the function 

Tutorials that prioritizes looks are overrated anyways, and not all of them are good
general 2020-09-13 14:54:04 <@621014351784181760> I've had experience with huge planes before, trust me it's hard
general 2020-09-13 14:54:12 Like really hard
general 2020-09-13 14:54:34 To get the dang thing off the ground requires a lot of wings, custom flaps and thrust
general 2020-09-13 14:54:47 To make steer good, it's harder
general 2020-09-13 14:57:24 <@621014351784181760> Well, here's some advice 

- Use custom flaps. They generally provide better control over the plane more than the game's default control surfaces. If you need any help just ask any of the local aero engineers here 

- Lots of thrust, a conveyor drive should provide enough thrust 

- Folding, both at the wings and at the body
general 2020-09-13 14:57:28 I'm too sleepy to explain
general 2020-09-13 14:57:37 But generally the community is here to help
general 2020-09-13 14:58:23 I must hibernate now
general 2020-09-13 14:58:27 I'm sleep
general 2020-09-13 14:59:19 <@512467907469377539> That also works too, though I use manually controlled control surfaces to provide extra roll power and for pitch stability
general 2020-09-13 14:59:34 So I don't end up nose diving
general 2020-09-13 15:00:08 I find Herisson to be a jack of all trades, and an expert at many
general 2020-09-13 15:00:21 Well, depends on your needs really
general 2020-09-13 15:01:05 Anyways goodnight
general 2020-09-13 15:01:05 Like do you want to have some mouse control or do you want those control surfaces to contribute to the keyboard steering
general 2020-09-13 22:26:40 If Tom and Jerry exhibit human like characteristics
general 2020-09-13 22:27:03 And anthropomorphism is like giving human like characteristics to something
general 2020-09-13 22:27:35 Then does that mean did we all just watch a cartoon of two furries fighting/made memes out of it
general 2020-09-13 22:27:53 No
general 2020-09-13 22:28:47 It's mostly a coincidence you end up seeing me doing this, and other stupid stuff
general 2020-09-13 22:30:05 How long was it since the last time?
general 2020-09-13 22:30:58 But you're not wrong either
general 2020-09-13 22:31:53 420 hours is still 420 hours
general 2020-09-13 22:34:16 You remind me of the KV-2
general 2020-09-13 22:34:46 Thanks for reminding me of that thing, a turret on wheels
general 2020-09-13 22:35:22 What were the Soviets thinking when they made the KV-2?
general 2020-09-13 22:37:33 <@505835349889777685> Nah try breaking the fabric of reality
general 2020-09-13 22:37:57 That's better than hovering or flying
general 2020-09-13 22:38:39 For real though there's no need for hover tanks irl
general 2020-09-13 22:38:48 Too much for too little returns
general 2020-09-13 22:40:23 Besides we already have pretty good tank suspension
general 2020-09-13 22:41:38 Hydropnuematic suspension, same technology used on Citroen's cars, which rode over war torn roads of France pretty smoothly
general 2020-09-13 22:42:52 I wonder what's the liquid part used for in Citroen's hydropneumatic suspension
general 2020-09-13 22:50:15 https://www.roblox.com/games/5243341535/Rickroll-simulator You know this could be a potential rickroll to anyone who has a little sibling
general 2020-09-13 22:50:26 As long as you know how to do HTML
general 2020-09-13 22:50:36 And disguise it as another game
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 23:03:08 I'm trying to make one
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 23:03:21 But I'm adding an extra spring
general 2020-09-13 23:24:20 this sentence is false
general 2020-09-13 23:46:03 <@551573378662662145> Isn't that the game with goo?
general 2020-09-13 23:46:29 Also I sent shredder nerfing suggestion in <#507673335816126509>
general 2020-09-13 23:46:36 Why do you ask?
general 2020-09-13 23:47:50 Someone here has a Changed PFP if I remember
general 2020-09-13 23:48:18 tehnoob1233

plane-crazy 2020-09-13 23:53:00 ***m o u t h***
general 2020-09-13 23:53:44 And then took the body in
general 2020-09-13 23:54:01 Easier than free candy I guess
general 2020-09-13 23:55:18 Why am I thinking of GTA
general 2020-09-13 23:56:03 <@163143541160148992> Is this like GTA?
the-dump 2020-09-13 23:58:33 They already are
the-dump 2020-09-13 23:58:50 It's just chaos in the US
the-dump 2020-09-13 23:59:36 Just look at the political disasters they have
general 2020-09-14 00:00:36 Discord is dying for me
general 2020-09-14 03:03:25 <@645128367611445248> Would TNT armor protect me from shredders if let's say I'm doing close air support?
general 2020-09-14 03:03:59 Knowing you
general 2020-09-14 03:04:13 You'd place lava spitters on your supersonic shredder
general 2020-09-14 03:05:17 I have some control when my Flanker goes 12K, but it has the sensitivity issues
general 2020-09-14 03:06:16 Wait
general 2020-09-14 03:06:23 You use 12 conveyor engines?
general 2020-09-14 03:06:49 I only use one
general 2020-09-14 03:07:31 The motors on my plane are stable even at 12k
general 2020-09-14 03:08:29 Well, they're blasting off
general 2020-09-14 03:08:54 I guess there's some purpose to adding TNT armor to planes if I'm doing CAS
general 2020-09-14 03:09:09 Oof
general 2020-09-14 03:09:13 well fair
general 2020-09-14 03:09:26 Have any offline games?
general 2020-09-14 03:09:34 oh good
general 2020-09-14 03:09:45 I usually download myself some emulators
general 2020-09-14 03:09:53 And download plenty of ROMs
general 2020-09-14 03:10:08 I got bored of Minecraft too tbh
general 2020-09-14 03:10:30 Maybe when multiplayer on cracked servers are alive again I might play again
general 2020-09-14 03:13:18 If I made a custom fighter, I should probably try forward swept wings unless it doesn't affect pitch that much
general 2020-09-14 03:13:30 Kinda wanna avoid nose diving
general 2020-09-14 03:13:43 Without using aritificial pitch stability
general 2020-09-14 03:13:54 And supermanuverability
general 2020-09-14 03:14:57 It's not, I'll just use whatever works for me
general 2020-09-14 03:15:31 That looks like a third gen fighter
general 2020-09-14 03:16:11 Okay
general 2020-09-14 03:16:28 Though I'll still try adding more wings at the front to take advantage of stalling
general 2020-09-14 03:17:29 The Panavia Tornado, does it have variable wing sweep?
general 2020-09-14 03:18:10 Wait no, that's an Airbus Beluga
general 2020-09-14 03:18:21 How could I be so blind
general 2020-09-14 03:19:14 I am disgusted by the Supra in <#384025409945337856>
general 2020-09-14 03:20:15 <@456226577798135808> No it's a Renault Megane
general 2020-09-14 03:21:12 Wait no it's not a Renault
general 2020-09-14 03:23:09 <@456226577798135808> No I'm referring to the thing in <#384025409945337856> 

It looks like a Toyota had a baby with those fat butt Citroens/Renaults
general 2020-09-14 03:24:16 It looks like a city car liftback with the front of a French car
general 2020-09-14 03:24:35 no u
general 2020-09-14 03:24:40 wait-
general 2020-09-14 03:25:00 No that's a deadly laser
general 2020-09-14 03:25:36 It's gonna burn us all, slowly
general 2020-09-14 03:26:04 Wait
general 2020-09-14 03:26:12 So is the sun a deadly bomb
general 2020-09-14 03:27:31 <@456226577798135808> I was kinda half joking 

But for real, it looks like a liftback city car (or whatever you call those Fiat 500 sized cars) with the front looking like a Supra survived a crash
general 2020-09-14 03:28:01 The proportions bother me
general 2020-09-14 03:28:16 <@733931029890596943> Hens are good, because chicken
general 2020-09-14 03:28:44 You have two golden nuggs
general 2020-09-14 03:28:53 Do you share or keep them
general 2020-09-14 03:29:14 ***dirty capitalist pig***
general 2020-09-14 03:29:17 ***share***
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 03:41:15 https://streamable.com/v6mzbs This is why it's important to add at least parts of the wings onto a motor lock tower
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 03:41:23 seamless
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 03:41:48 oof an argument
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 03:42:04 ok
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 03:42:10 understandable, have a nice day
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 03:43:15 I just realized something

general 2020-09-14 03:45:12 <@!505835349889777685> So that basically shows that the saying "If it's not broken, then don't fix it" should apply
general 2020-09-14 03:45:17 Especially to idiots with no experience
general 2020-09-14 03:57:08 ill go look up some custom jets
general 2020-09-14 03:59:16 I see custom fighter jets in this plane use delta wings
general 2020-09-14 03:59:29 in this game*
general 2020-09-14 03:59:35 Flying dorito is overrated
general 2020-09-14 03:59:42 Just like American fighter jets

general 2020-09-14 04:11:34 Understandable

general 2020-09-14 09:01:31 Greenland flag is BnL clothes
general 2020-09-14 09:02:01 Buy and Large
general 2020-09-14 09:02:14 Buy **Enlarge**
general 2020-09-14 09:02:18 They enlarge
general 2020-09-14 09:02:28 Literal capitalist pigs
general 2020-09-14 09:04:13 Can we give a plane Rickje clothes and hair 

And call it Planje
general 2020-09-14 09:04:22 I mean he is the Plane Crazy dev
general 2020-09-14 09:04:34 So planje139
general 2020-09-14 09:04:52 Yes
general 2020-09-14 09:05:09 Now your plane is Stalin*g*
general 2020-09-14 11:32:07 it's a walking card
general 2020-09-14 11:47:48 <#478584971670454284> just a minor detail
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 11:55:55 
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 11:55:56 
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 11:56:04 I can't decide which one looks better
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 11:56:15 It's for a forward swept wing custom fighter
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 11:56:19 Or at least as custom as I could make it
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 11:56:25 Might add canards, might not
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 11:56:43 The way I'm gonna implement the canards would be similar to the Eurofighter Typhoon
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 11:56:59 The only reason I'm doing forward swept wings tbh is because of nose diving
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 11:57:37 Like which one looks better for a forward swept wing (maybe with canards), the top or bottom image?
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 11:58:12 <@!572411935669354528> Practice, dedication, motor locking, custom flaps, and a whole lotta engine power
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 12:01:27 Hmm, the intakes actually could work
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 12:01:32 Put more forward
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 12:01:45 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/AMCA_model_at_Aero_India_2013_%28cropped%29.jpg This is the HAL AMCA
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 12:01:58 A proposed 5th gen stealth fighter from India's own aerospace company
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 12:03:30 I'm doing these kind of ramp intakes https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/North_American_XB-70_above_runway_ECN-792.jpg
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 12:03:47 If Wikipedia says they're good for aircraft with speed in mind
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 12:03:52 Well, I'll go use them then
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 12:05:55 I'm currently doing fine with intake ramps so far, so I'll stick with them for now
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 12:06:00 If needed I'll change it
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 12:07:12 Hmm, guess I could do canards placed just near or right in front of the cockpit, as demonstrated by that pic or in the Typhoon
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 12:07:22 Though I'll go do that when the forward sweep isn't enough
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:15:38 My imagination is struggling a little
general 2020-09-14 13:16:45 I'm back at another session of struggling with plane design
general 2020-09-14 13:16:52 Bought you by my dense brain
general 2020-09-14 13:17:39 Who is this Developer from the Netherlands?
general 2020-09-14 13:17:44 DutchDeveloper
general 2020-09-14 13:17:54 Robo sees all
general 2020-09-14 13:18:00 That's he sent eye
general 2020-09-14 13:18:03 Because he sees all
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:18:18 <@456226577798135808> Wait what's too small?
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:18:43 A forward swept wing because nose diving
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:19:11 I placed it very far forward for a forward swept wing
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:19:24 But I can see why it's small
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:19:42 It's currently at like 8 blocks in length
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:20:40 so small wing
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:20:43 and the lacc of locc
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:23:41 It's pretty stable for me
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:23:54 I use them regularly on planes
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:24:27 I just use them as after burners also
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:24:35 Though 12k on a Flanker is pretty decent
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:25:34 Magnets are fun for propelling things
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:27:40 I should probably use the Su-47 as a reference for forward swept wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:31:19 Made it slightly bigger, though still looks like needs more adjustments
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:33:24 I'll probably just do a session of trying to get wing size right
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:40:50 looking kinda fat
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:48:08 Just a custom plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:51:23 1x3 front, 1x2 back, got it
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:52:15 ~~Honestly the only reason I did forward swept is so that it nose dives less~~
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:52:29 ~~That is literally the only reason~~
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:53:36 Because it's unique compared to other wing configurations?
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:56:12 Some design goals I should set 
- Prevent nose diving passively (only wings, no flaps/control surfaces)
- TNT armoring for shredder and CAS protection 
- High manuverability through intentional stalling 
- Look at least decent
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:56:50 The first goal is to make sure I have more control over a single conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:56:54 Possible
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:57:06 Like I've never took something into PvP
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:57:12 Might as well try it
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:57:31 I mean the second goal isn't the most important thing
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:57:40 It's a nice bonus to have though
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:58:29 So 
- Passive anti nose dive 
- Intentional stall for high manuverability 
- Look good
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:59:07 Well, it's about to be 10
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:59:17 So I'll take a break and continue next tine
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 13:59:22 time*
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 14:00:07 Looking at the wings now on mobile
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 14:00:14 It does indeed look small
general 2020-09-14 14:01:09 Installing Python? How hard could it be when installers exist
general 2020-09-14 14:01:52 <@370594904268734464> O h 

Don't hurt my brain with *that*
general 2020-09-14 14:01:58 Now I see
general 2020-09-14 14:02:29 I'm learning Python so I can have less of a brainfuck (pun intended) with C++
general 2020-09-14 14:03:00 Though now I might try AutoHotKey then C++, because at least I have a reason to try making some scripts
general 2020-09-14 14:03:09 Which is to make my life easier with online classes
general 2020-09-14 14:03:36 C++ I could use for game developer stuff, I might even learn some regular C
general 2020-09-14 14:04:26 <@693476997007147068> I'm surprised my cousin does fine learning both C++ and C#
general 2020-09-14 14:04:48 I just wanna do hobby stuff 

Which is game dev stuff
general 2020-09-14 14:04:57 Like just casual dev stuff
general 2020-09-14 14:05:43 Still learning C++ would be a good thing to learn
general 2020-09-14 14:06:06 Right now though, I'll settle with AutoHotKey or Python
general 2020-09-14 14:06:43 I mean if I see people preferring C++ over C#, then I'd go with the majority
general 2020-09-14 14:07:10 I should try to motivate myself
general 2020-09-14 14:07:12 For I am noob
general 2020-09-14 14:07:36 Print, the only command I memorized in Python xp
general 2020-09-14 14:08:26 So, I have two programming language and a scripting app to learn
general 2020-09-14 14:08:47 Doesn't AutoHotKey use Emacs?
general 2020-09-14 14:09:18 To make its scripts work
general 2020-09-14 14:09:32 Well if it says it's easy to learn
general 2020-09-14 14:09:39 Well I'd go give it a try
general 2020-09-14 14:10:12 I have VS Code
general 2020-09-14 14:10:20 And the community edition of VS
general 2020-09-14 14:10:30 I probably should've only installed VS Code
general 2020-09-14 14:10:43 Considering I'm only doing small scale stuff
general 2020-09-14 14:10:54 The kind you'd expect from hobbies
general 2020-09-14 14:12:08 I have 2 TB of USB space 

H m m, Mint
general 2020-09-14 14:12:40 Because my dad says to do it there
general 2020-09-14 14:12:56 <@456226577798135808> Relatable
general 2020-09-14 14:13:09 It's not even my PC xp
general 2020-09-14 14:13:17 Just a shared computer xp
general 2020-09-14 14:13:41 Mint on a Live USB
general 2020-09-14 14:14:33 Because my dad prefers I do it that way
general 2020-09-14 14:15:02 It's surprising this USB has way more space than the family computer
general 2020-09-14 14:15:25 2 TB USB to like 200ish GB of HDD
general 2020-09-14 14:16:22 It's an HP USB manufactured in Taiwan formatted in exFAT
general 2020-09-14 14:16:51 It says 1.90 TB
general 2020-09-14 14:17:06 Which is close enough
general 2020-09-14 14:17:22 It's a tall boi
general 2020-09-14 14:17:32 Gold tol boi
general 2020-09-14 14:17:41 Even has a neat little keychain
general 2020-09-14 14:18:42 My dad also bought one for my brother
general 2020-09-14 14:19:01 Dunno what use a 10 year old would need for 2 TB
general 2020-09-14 14:19:22 Apart from games
general 2020-09-14 14:19:57 I could put a lot of emulators and games on that USB
general 2020-09-14 14:20:18 That's a lot of RetroArch cores
general 2020-09-14 14:21:10 I'll go download most mainstream consoles cores on RA
general 2020-09-14 14:21:27 Starting from the 16 bit era, as well as a few 8-bit ones
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 14:22:33 So much black
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 14:22:37 So I can see why
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 14:23:57 Default
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 14:24:30 .)—(.

dee-folt
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 14:24:50 Rocc
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 14:24:52 Slate then
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 14:25:01 Because it's rocky, but not pebbley
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 14:25:20 I'll just use 2 trails for afterburner
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 14:25:32 2 trails per engine
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 14:25:37 So I can reduce the motor lag
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 14:26:40 I'm used to putting landing gear under wings, so where should I put them now
general 2020-09-14 14:27:42 Keep tapping light mode for OLED dark mode
general 2020-09-14 14:28:09 Oh crap
general 2020-09-14 14:28:12 He knows
general 2020-09-14 14:28:20 Well, you know it already
general 2020-09-14 14:28:26 So keep tapping dark mode
general 2020-09-14 14:28:35 For the actual OLED dark mode
general 2020-09-14 14:28:51 Also, Discord's 404 page has a hidden snek game
general 2020-09-14 14:30:07 Yes, OLED dark mode exists
general 2020-09-14 14:30:17 It's the darkest of dark bois
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 14:30:37 Ren has a good tutorial on that
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 14:30:42 So does Prototrode
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 14:30:52 Either of them works
general 2020-09-14 14:32:09 Because I am a kind dumbass
general 2020-09-14 14:32:14 I'll go do it anyways
general 2020-09-14 14:33:11 
general 2020-09-14 14:34:50 ***w H y   C o M i C   s A n S***
general 2020-09-14 14:35:25 I saved it
general 2020-09-14 14:36:12 <@370594904268734464> Boy are you using the Motorola Flip-flop-flippatron XZY 2000?
general 2020-09-14 14:36:53 I have Sam's Song
general 2020-09-14 14:37:18 I actually have a Samsung Galaxy S5
general 2020-09-14 14:37:41 A phone for a teen that is clumsy when in chaos
general 2020-09-14 14:37:56 Chaos such as school
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 14:38:16 <@437152336176087052> me.
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 14:38:36 An ugly jumbo jet was the only reason I got expert
plane-crazy 2020-09-14 14:38:52 It's in <#384025409945337856>
general 2020-09-14 14:39:18 IEEE
general 2020-09-14 14:39:28 What's the largest port/cable?
general 2020-09-14 14:40:40 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE-488 Show me something larger than this
general 2020-09-14 14:41:28 This thing is huge tho
general 2020-09-15 00:16:41 Planeje139
general 2020-09-15 00:17:00 Planeje139
general 2020-09-15 00:18:13 <@430739561690431489> So give wings that aerofoil shape or whatever that curvature is called?

It is possible with motor locking, although you can't do it on flaps
general 2020-09-15 00:19:33 Build mode only outlines?
general 2020-09-15 00:19:40 Build mode only outlines?
general 2020-09-15 00:23:01 If planeje139 exists, then what plane
general 2020-09-15 00:24:46 Maybe both
general 2020-09-15 00:25:03 I mean it's a hinge, it could attach to the side
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 00:29:02 Folding
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 00:30:26 I just do planes, no ships and not much in land vehicles
general 2020-09-15 00:31:07 I literal Tiger
general 2020-09-15 00:31:18 What is this Starfox?
general 2020-09-15 00:34:02 This is Robloxian Space Program, not Minecraft
general 2020-09-15 00:43:20 nice.
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 00:44:37 I mean you could hide the vertical wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 00:44:47 Assuming you have more boxy intakes
general 2020-09-15 00:45:20 Undies don't do comedy
general 2020-09-15 00:48:45 Is Rick Dutch?
general 2020-09-15 00:48:51 Dutchje
general 2020-09-15 00:49:14 Can we call this server, The Dutchjeland?
general 2020-09-15 00:49:37 ~~im aware it sounds a bit like deutschland~~
general 2020-09-15 00:50:17 I'm too lazy to search that emoji
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 00:51:09 I use vertical wings for the intake ramps
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 00:51:19 <@659472689903173672> Make it bigger
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 00:52:06 I should really learn how to reduce the amount of locked motors I use to avoid physics throttling
general 2020-09-15 00:54:01 <@720891502108344360> It won't suck Rick because Rick is beyond the hole
general 2020-09-15 00:54:17 He is too powerful for the black hole
general 2020-09-15 00:54:43 *I know the perfect video to describe Rick's power*
general 2020-09-15 00:55:51 https://youtu.be/arHaYawxa2c <@720891502108344360> Even his mere scent is enough to defeat anything

general 2020-09-15 00:56:13 Yes this is a real ad
general 2020-09-15 00:57:02 ***Nev is not mom?***
general 2020-09-15 00:57:11 So no mod mom
general 2020-09-15 00:57:17 The big sad
general 2020-09-15 00:57:35 <@720891502108344360> What did you expect from Old Spice?
the-dump 2020-09-15 00:58:44 https://youtu.be/1tF2dF67Q2c lol have fun <@720891502108344360>
the-dump 2020-09-15 00:59:09 I remember finding this a long time ago
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 03:47:06 Is this large enough?
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 03:48:11 A custom fighter

plane-crazy 2020-09-15 03:50:03 Let me show you something
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 03:50:06 Memelous
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 03:51:19 
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 03:51:20 
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 03:51:30 This is a motor lock tower, it's a classic plane building technique
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 03:51:41 
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 03:51:42 
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 03:51:48 And these are the results of doing it
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 03:52:33 Something like that
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 03:53:54 I think you'd rather start with what I do
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 03:53:59 Motor lock towers
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 03:55:43 The fighter I'm building requires motor locking
general 2020-09-15 04:06:06 
general 2020-09-15 04:06:43 Angle of wings?
general 2020-09-15 04:09:04 I might as well just use a three surface delta
general 2020-09-15 04:09:44 Also the chat made me lose hope in humanity
general 2020-09-15 04:11:06 Not this one

Like in what world do you defend a shredder?
general 2020-09-15 04:12:51 "eW a PlaNe"
general 2020-09-15 04:12:54 That guy
general 2020-09-15 04:14:28 I left, like I always do when a server has no hope
general 2020-09-15 04:15:34 Please welcome back my friend called delta wings
general 2020-09-15 04:15:41 I'm DenseReptile
general 2020-09-15 04:18:31 What if Spiderman
general 2020-09-15 04:18:33 the unde hunter
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 04:21:03 Back to using old reliable delta wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 04:21:32 I have an easier time working with them
general 2020-09-15 04:23:44 Reverted to using delta wings again
general 2020-09-15 04:26:02 I'll just figure out other ways of passively preventing nose dives
general 2020-09-15 04:26:22 It also blends in with the intake ramp nicely, which is a bonus
general 2020-09-15 04:35:39 Prototrode did that as an experiment
general 2020-09-15 04:36:32 101,439
general 2020-09-15 04:45:20 Or a lot of the little monstrosities known as shredders
general 2020-09-15 04:45:25 Anyways classes starting, cya
general 2020-09-15 09:13:50 I think I saw something cursed
general 2020-09-15 09:13:55 Pony plane
general 2020-09-15 09:14:18 On a more positive side, Ford's bringing back the Bronco
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 09:15:23 I see a tornado and block spam within one server 

I give my condolences to propilotcaptain
general 2020-09-15 09:16:41 As long as it isn't a low grade tycoon
general 2020-09-15 09:16:44 Then you'd be fine
general 2020-09-15 09:17:11 ~~We already have enough obbies and tycoons in Roblox tbh~~
general 2020-09-15 09:17:56 <@409676438682206218> Well, guess you better learn to optimize
general 2020-09-15 09:18:12 If it can run on a Ryzen 5, I guess that's good
general 2020-09-15 09:18:31 If it can run on an i3/Ryzen 3, now that's a good minimum
general 2020-09-15 09:19:09 AMD's Accelerated Processing Units, not sure if that's too much of a goal
general 2020-09-15 09:19:48 <@409676438682206218> Did anyone happen to use your computer?
general 2020-09-15 09:20:24 Must be some old videos if it ain't yours
general 2020-09-15 09:20:35 Probably that for some
general 2020-09-15 09:20:53 Actually it might be all K-drama
general 2020-09-15 09:21:09 I should learn how to partition USB drives
general 2020-09-15 09:21:34 250 GB out of 2 TB allocated for live USB? That good?
general 2020-09-15 09:22:00 Oh, well I'm just planning to install Linux Mint
general 2020-09-15 09:22:34 Not really planning to do any heavy workloads on a live USB
general 2020-09-15 09:24:24 Honestly for most people there's nothing much different from Linux, apart from gaming
general 2020-09-15 09:24:48 Like what are you really gonna miss?
general 2020-09-15 09:26:39 I also find that Windows 10 is trying so hard to conquer all platforms
general 2020-09-15 09:27:39 Yes
general 2020-09-15 09:28:03 I'm trying to come up with something clever but I got nothing
general 2020-09-15 09:28:29 Back to stuff I guess
general 2020-09-15 09:29:35 One thing though, GIF with hard G or with soft G (like the peanut butter brand)?
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 10:22:34 What is a good measurement of knowing when a delta wing is oversized or not?
general 2020-09-15 10:24:39 I guess Mee6 didn't want you to be full of yourself
general 2020-09-15 10:25:45 When does a delta wing considered to be too big or too small?
general 2020-09-15 10:26:56 *What stache?* 👀
general 2020-09-15 10:28:28 guess ill go experiment
general 2020-09-15 10:31:57 Why do I have a feeling someone mentioned the Egyptian goddess's name
general 2020-09-15 10:32:34 Tomcat ||aeromorph||
general 2020-09-15 10:33:41 > I accuse all of you for stupi except blob
Thanks, I've always known that
general 2020-09-15 10:34:22 <@456226577798135808> ngl I can see why people call it a fancy shredder
general 2020-09-15 10:35:40 https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimgproc.airliners.net%2Fphotos%2Fairliners%2F9%2F6%2F5%2F1576569.jpg%3Fv%3Dv40&f=1&nofb=1 wtf is this
general 2020-09-15 10:36:02 I randomly found this
general 2020-09-15 10:36:08 Two Sukhois, got welded
general 2020-09-15 10:36:16 Weldhoi
general 2020-09-15 10:37:12 wait a fucking minute
general 2020-09-15 10:37:17 it isn't
general 2020-09-15 10:37:29 It's just uncomfortably close
general 2020-09-15 10:38:15 That's tiny
general 2020-09-15 12:50:44 Do those group funds in Roblox actually work?
general 2020-09-15 12:51:15 Well I should go ahead and join them if I want some robux
general 2020-09-15 12:52:37 <@!409676438682206218> Does that mean I can simply just sell my own clothes for bobux?
general 2020-09-15 12:52:50 Does that require me to pay up first?
general 2020-09-15 12:52:59 Oof
general 2020-09-15 12:53:02 Then group funds
bot-central 2020-09-15 12:53:12 !servers
general 2020-09-15 12:54:01 My money says "you can only afford free"
general 2020-09-15 12:54:35 An actual legit way of earning free robux
general 2020-09-15 12:56:14 <@!409676438682206218> Delete before the mods see
general 2020-09-15 12:56:34 Still, the mods might lean on the suggestive side
general 2020-09-15 12:56:38 Told ya
general 2020-09-15 12:58:10 It is suggestive anime stuff
general 2020-09-15 12:58:44 I don't even know anime
general 2020-09-15 12:58:48 ~~maybe a little~~
general 2020-09-15 12:59:12 I'm more inclined on Western content tbh
general 2020-09-15 13:01:02 oof
general 2020-09-15 14:16:21 Anime Ohio 

OWOhio
general 2020-09-15 14:16:52 2b or not 2t
general 2020-09-15 14:17:06 I see a missile
general 2020-09-15 14:17:57 I do jet era planes
general 2020-09-15 14:18:11 Not really interested in ships
general 2020-09-15 14:18:32 Not much of a suspension expert
general 2020-09-15 14:20:24 I still remember that guy who defended shredders by saying "eW a PlAnE"
general 2020-09-15 14:21:19 < complains about getting killed 
< has crappy immobile turret
general 2020-09-15 14:22:09 <@199720559557214208> The classic case of talentless cringe
general 2020-09-15 14:22:33 There's a reason why planes are designed the way they are
general 2020-09-15 14:23:20 Honestly even a basic three surface plane would do a better job while still looking good compared to wing spam
general 2020-09-15 14:24:18 Like you'd have a better time making poob tailed Eurofighter Typhoon than cringe spam/cube
general 2020-09-15 14:24:47 Shredders is the result of lacking any shame and talent
general 2020-09-15 14:25:01 And ground turrets are just bad investments
general 2020-09-15 14:25:24 Like just slap some wheels and at least you can call it a "tank"
general 2020-09-15 14:25:35 When it's an armed platform
general 2020-09-15 14:26:08 <@199720559557214208> Tell them eight wheeled trucks exist
general 2020-09-15 14:27:12 If a plane can turn 999G, I'd be both impressed and concerned
general 2020-09-15 14:27:27 For somehow you broke physics as well as the pilot
general 2020-09-15 14:28:15 <@456226577798135808> I'd believe high turn rates over suddenly stopping in mid-air
general 2020-09-15 14:28:37 ~~I mean the Russians do it all the time~~
general 2020-09-15 14:28:50 ~~with their Supermanuverable aircraft~~
general 2020-09-15 14:29:29 And the Americans are loving it too with their F-22
general 2020-09-15 14:31:22 Don't do Russians prefer close-range, slow speed combat over the Western philosophy of retaining energy and BVR weapons?
general 2020-09-15 14:32:35 <@447221768520859659> **X** (doubt)

I'd believe it if it's compared to an F-22, at least Wikipedia says it's capable of being supermanuverable
general 2020-09-15 14:33:41 But an F-18, you can say it's highly manuverable but no respected source says it's Supermanuverable
general 2020-09-15 14:34:19 Thrust vectoring is a requirement for *true* supermanuverabilty
general 2020-09-15 14:35:17 Though still, plane design can make a plane very manuverable
general 2020-09-15 14:35:50 This is Plane Crazy, where we're going we don't need thrust vectoring
general 2020-09-15 14:36:02 In real life though you need those kind of engines
general 2020-09-15 14:36:31 Yes, that
general 2020-09-15 14:36:39 This is why I don't include it
general 2020-09-15 14:36:56 I'm fine with being highly manuverable
general 2020-09-15 14:37:02 And using stall to my advantage
general 2020-09-15 14:38:39 X-35 <@693476997007147068> 

If Mazda made a plane
general 2020-09-15 14:39:00 I tried making one
general 2020-09-15 14:39:14 Ended up looking similar to a 5th gen fighter
general 2020-09-15 14:41:37 What are the requirements for a 5th gen fighter? Apart from stealth, multirole and being highly manuverable
general 2020-09-15 14:42:34 Well stealth doesn't really exist in PC
general 2020-09-15 14:43:04 And I don't think supercruise is a requirement in PC considering conveyor drives have no fuel
general 2020-09-15 14:44:00 I'm planning for multirole and making my plane highly manuverable 

That puts it into 4-5th generation in Plane Crazy
general 2020-09-15 14:44:16 Though the way I designed it makes it look like a 5th gen
general 2020-09-15 14:44:28 At least in my opinion
general 2020-09-15 14:45:02 You slept
general 2020-09-15 14:45:16 I will have chicken empanadas for breakfast tomorrow
general 2020-09-15 14:45:41 <@546223347025969164> You need to get an alarm with your phone shoved somewhere you'll feel it
general 2020-09-15 14:45:59 <@456226577798135808> Make it ranked so we won't get cringe
general 2020-09-15 14:46:25 <@693476997007147068> Imagine bombing speakers
general 2020-09-15 14:46:40 Like a bomber that drops speakers
general 2020-09-15 14:47:05 <@546223347025969164> Put it in your pocket or near your face
general 2020-09-15 14:47:11 And set to vibrate also
general 2020-09-15 14:47:40 <@448505589983739914> Bomber but it drops shredders with speakers on them
general 2020-09-15 14:47:54 oof
general 2020-09-15 14:48:08 I'm hungry
general 2020-09-15 14:48:15 I want my empanadas now
general 2020-09-15 14:48:31 Fine I'll eat you then
general 2020-09-15 14:48:57 <@392334096560554001> It was in response in PCBLike saying no
general 2020-09-15 14:50:01 <@693476997007147068> Hold up you wanna be food?
general 2020-09-15 14:50:13 **n o .**
general 2020-09-15 14:50:49 I'd be a half baked potato with some hot sauce/peppers on it
general 2020-09-15 14:51:46 I'm spicy mashed potatoes
general 2020-09-15 14:52:15 <@693476997007147068> No thanks I'd rather have aeromorphs instead of morphs that are willing to be vored
general 2020-09-15 14:52:44 At least I can keep pretending that aeromorphs are robots
general 2020-09-15 14:53:02 Just pretend they are robot waifu and they'll be less worse
general 2020-09-15 14:53:50 Imagine being a foodmorph though where your entire life is dedicated to being eaten alive
general 2020-09-15 14:54:11 <@472857982703763487> Robot* 

Hologram cannot be touched
general 2020-09-15 14:55:24 <@472857982703763487> It was first vore, then it become foodmorphs, then became aeromorphs, then me saying "pretend aeromorphs are robot waifu and they'll be less worse"
general 2020-09-15 14:55:43 I just like it warm
general 2020-09-15 14:55:47 Not hot, not cold
general 2020-09-15 14:55:54 Just a little hot
general 2020-09-15 14:56:33 I mean if you live in Arizona then it's understandable
general 2020-09-15 14:56:37 O h
general 2020-09-15 14:57:31 I upvoted, because ***F R E E ? !***
general 2020-09-15 14:57:52 I remembered that one vid
general 2020-09-15 14:58:01 "Robbie Rotten is Communist"
general 2020-09-15 14:58:39 I can only afford broke
general 2020-09-15 14:58:57 They're just a neat bonus
general 2020-09-15 14:59:43 <@670939038999511041> The speakers have more value than anything on Roblox that's a grindfest
general 2020-09-15 14:59:48 Or a clicker
general 2020-09-15 14:59:52 Or a tycoon
general 2020-09-15 15:00:01 Or an obby
general 2020-09-15 15:00:21 But yes he need bobux
general 2020-09-15 15:00:52 If he has other forms of income then he would make it free
general 2020-09-15 15:00:55 But no
general 2020-09-15 15:01:13 And he won't be the cruel dictator known as triple A studios
general 2020-09-15 15:01:23 Where its all DLC and crap
general 2020-09-15 15:01:41 An obvious example would be the Sims, expensive DLC that barely adds anything
general 2020-09-15 15:01:51 Specifically Sims 4
general 2020-09-15 15:02:43 Half of these I'd buy tbh if I had money
general 2020-09-15 15:03:38 <@163143541160148992> That's a decent amount of income
general 2020-09-15 15:04:17 But can Roblox integrate with Discord?
general 2020-09-15 15:04:23 As in check ranks and stuff
general 2020-09-15 15:04:31 Where'd you spank?
general 2020-09-15 15:04:51 Oh right
general 2020-09-15 15:04:57 Possible
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 15:06:07 Get a rank
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 15:06:22 <#609442446249820211> <#705941616199991307>
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 15:06:29 Better have time to read
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 15:06:35 Both
bot-central 2020-09-16 04:18:01 !servers
general 2020-09-16 04:18:53 Did the PCC Staff just decided to constantly change the VIP server link?
general 2020-09-16 04:21:01 A helicopter is a cop from hell
general 2020-09-16 04:27:00 <@!163143541160148992> If only I was paid to receive electricity
general 2020-09-16 04:27:49 Because it hot
general 2020-09-16 04:29:07 w a t
general 2020-09-16 04:29:13 I'm too lazy for that
general 2020-09-16 04:29:36 That checks out
general 2020-09-16 04:29:59 Formula 1 cars are just reverse planes, aren't they?
general 2020-09-16 04:30:13 Instead of trying to get off the ground, they try to stay on the ground
general 2020-09-16 04:30:25 With how much spoilers and aerodynamic devices they have
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 04:31:58 plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 04:32:13 just plen
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 04:36:52 Are 5th gen fighter wings really that big?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 04:40:52 I keep having the mindset that I'm designing for 4th gen, maybe that's why it ends up being small
general 2020-09-16 04:45:22 Dunno why they decided to name it javascript
general 2020-09-16 04:46:20 haha funny
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 06:46:07 So
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 06:47:01 5th generation fighters apart from having stealth, highly manuverable, has supercruise and is multirole also has large wings as well as a lot of curvature
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 06:47:29 As well as a distinct seam that can be obviously seen on fighters like the F-22 and F-35
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 06:47:43 Is that correct?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 06:47:54 Or is that "line" not necessary
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 06:48:54 Stealth fighter wings are larger than I thought
general 2020-09-16 06:50:04 Japan's making their own stealth fighter https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_X-2_Shinshin
general 2020-09-16 06:51:30 Do all stealth fighters have this line/seam https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Aircraft_Combat_Archer_%282565196807%29.jpg
general 2020-09-16 06:51:46 Look at the nose
general 2020-09-16 06:52:13 I might as well go full-on 5th gen
general 2020-09-16 06:52:29 Instead of trying to apply 4th gen design on a plane that already looks like it's ready for 5th gen
general 2020-09-16 06:54:28 I'm not surprised considering they also did something similar with the Sukhoi Flanker
general 2020-09-16 06:54:51 oh wait, I forgot about that
general 2020-09-16 06:55:03 They built it under license if I remember
general 2020-09-16 06:56:23 But that looks a lot like an F-22
general 2020-09-16 06:57:08 Well Math classes are starting
general 2020-09-16 06:58:04 math inflicts damage onto the brain
general 2020-09-16 06:59:12 I wonder how I'll do that seam stealth fighters do on the nose tho
general 2020-09-16 07:13:29 Did I just saw impure puri?
general 2020-09-16 07:14:20 <@!693476997007147068> Commit distillation and filtration
general 2020-09-16 07:20:52 Motor locked tanks are just like motor locked planes, aren't they?
general 2020-09-16 07:22:59 I need to get rid of that space then, so I can reduce the motors needed
general 2020-09-16 07:26:54 "Hardened meat shell"
general 2020-09-16 07:27:05 So bugs?
general 2020-09-16 07:27:16 They have a hard shell that's organic
general 2020-09-16 07:33:57 cat is chonky
general 2020-09-16 07:34:05 Cat: Become Garfield
general 2020-09-16 09:14:43 https://www.temporary-url.com/40A6 Can someone test if this actually works?
general 2020-09-16 09:14:53 I've set it to be 1 click then after that expires
the-dump 2020-09-16 09:15:08 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjDebmqFRuc
general 2020-09-16 09:18:02 It didn't work
general 2020-09-16 09:18:57 Other than for looks
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 09:20:36 Screw it I'll go full on 5th gen as much as possible on this
general 2020-09-16 09:22:56 Too curvy
general 2020-09-16 09:23:14 Like it's more 2010s in appearance
general 2020-09-16 09:23:36 <#384021699466756107> also, I might as well make this into a 5th gen fighter
general 2020-09-16 09:25:33 I honestly have no idea how I'll make a stealth fighter nose
general 2020-09-16 09:26:08 I need that line/seam visible on 5th gen fighters
general 2020-09-16 09:30:33 Maybe I shouldn't do the seam, because *this*

This looks more like an A-10 Warthog nose
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 09:32:34 Different username though
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:15:33 https://streamable.com/ddkwbl
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:15:53 I made it work
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:16:18 I ditched the main wing
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:16:48 <@!315262125113081856> You are aware <#384025409945337856> mentions Streamable as one of the services to use when trying to display videos, right?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:17:13 So I'm only relying on the stabilators, rudders and those hidden wings in front
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:17:56 Understandable
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:19:13 I prefer minimizing the amount of motor locks needed
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:19:28 And making good use of the space available to me
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:20:17 Still, I should apply minimizing the amount of motor locks needed to reduce physics throttling
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:20:29 Think of it like JPEG compression, do only what is needed
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:21:25 A balance of both is nice
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:21:40 If you can add aesthetics here, then do it
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:22:04 But it it the throttling it gives is worse than the looks it gives in return, then nah
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:22:10 That's why I didn't add TVC
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:23:12 Something looks so trippy about that wave
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:24:31 He wants to patent it
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:24:41 So he can get all the credits
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:24:59 Watch Ren's video or Prototrode's video
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:25:07 Both of them are good at explaining stuff
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:26:32 I think I'll adapt getting rid of the main wing
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:26:58 Because it really is just deadweight after I realized I could simply just add hidden wings in front
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:27:19 To avoid pitching, plus I already have enough wings for stability
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:27:45 The unde won, there is a giant shredder
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:28:52 Good, did some testing and it didn't stall as much
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:29:07 Only loses half of it's speed instead of completely losing it
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:30:19 <@456226577798135808> The irony of it is that he's using a low-grade, cheap "tactic"
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:30:39 dang that be really smooth
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:31:59 I forgot I added a speed brake at the back, so technically a Cobra *might* be possible if I had enough skill
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:35:36 What if
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:35:44 He made a demonstration vid on YouTube
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:35:50 But never tells the secret behind it also
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:38:18 Make something extra smooth with that
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:38:25 Even if it's just decorational
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:38:58 https://streamable.com/zy6pve Why am I having fun doing this stupid and useless manuver
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:39:55 I honestly can't think up of a reason why someone would actually do that, spinning like a corkscrew in the air
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:41:09 <@!383528513778745344> Wait why motor bending?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:42:31 I mean if you want a really realistic shirt or pants then might be possible
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:42:58 Though part of me thinks someone will eventually do something "weird" if they knew the secrets behind that
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:46:24 I don't even know how single engined prop planes work
general 2020-09-16 13:47:48 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorjet so this kind of engine exists
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:48:27 Tilted engine, with occasional tilted blades
general 2020-09-16 13:48:43 I don't know
general 2020-09-16 13:48:56 All I know is that it's a combination of a turbofan and a propeller
general 2020-09-16 13:49:04 So propeller + jet engine
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:50:10 <@456226577798135808> Aren't WW2 planes some of the most powerful propeller planes?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:50:24 Oh yes
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:50:37 The ones operated by non-military groups are called warbirds, right?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 13:50:47 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warbird
general 2020-09-16 13:52:31 I heard wasps?

general 2020-09-16 13:54:17 I didn't realize it wasn't merged until just some hours ago
general 2020-09-16 13:54:22 When someone told me it wasn't merged
general 2020-09-16 13:58:27 Is it me you're looking for?
general 2020-09-16 13:58:44 > keep saving ur world to avoid  virus so u can reload
<@!447426989280722946> Oops my universe crashed but I had an anti-virus
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 14:50:20 What if tank tracks, but it's wing panels
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 14:50:39 And it's as flexible as motor treads
general 2020-09-16 14:51:07 This looks like chaos

general 2020-09-16 23:02:31 What toppings?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:04:36 Gonna need to tune the plane more if I wanna go beyond 2.8K sps
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:04:56 Currently my personal record is 12K, which is far faster than 2.8K
general 2020-09-16 23:05:12 Wash your hands obc
general 2020-09-16 23:05:18 Or you get the 'roni virus
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:05:30 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:06:15 I'm playing Plane Crazy literally just minutes after waking up
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:08:31 <@!432344306427101184> That looks like a shredder with a purple tumor
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:08:49 Which sounds disgusting
general 2020-09-16 23:19:19 What is considered fast in Plane Crazy?
general 2020-09-16 23:19:34 Well, controllable fast anyways
general 2020-09-16 23:19:41 For an aircraft
general 2020-09-16 23:20:50 Still barely got halfway of my goal of 12K, only reaching 5K so far
general 2020-09-16 23:23:04 Can a plane run purely off of alcohol, such as in the case of the Mazda Furai concept car
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:25:53 <@645128367611445248> How do you achieve high controlled speeds?
general 2020-09-16 23:26:59 Motor 2s or horizontal propellers
general 2020-09-16 23:27:56 Vertical motor 2s?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:28:12 I deleted the main wing
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:29:13 I used conveyor drives, because I want to add interceptor to one of the roles I'd add to my plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:29:30 And conveyor drives accelerate quickly and I'm used to them
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:31:46 Here is a slightly old pic https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/741513206123724801/755790283735695470/RobloxScreenShot20200916_215939914.png
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:32:28 The only new things I added was to add a conveyor drive and fine tuned the wings hidden in front
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:33:08 5K, no nose diving/pitching up until I use conveyor drives, no wobbling but still highly agile
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:33:27 5K is half the speed I got on my Flanker
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:33:33 Which is 12K
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:34:24 My experience is that they tend to pitch up until unless you do some black magic
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:35:00 Tank steering, if you wanna turn left, make right wheels go forward while left wheels either do nothing or go backward
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:35:15 And vice versa
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:35:54 And you shred people like there's no tomorrow
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:36:31 They probably hasn't considered this game has a lot of exploits
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:37:02 ~~shredders, motor lock bombs, tnt armor, lava spitters, guns~~
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:38:37 Still, TNT armor would be nice when doing something like Close Air Support
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:39:18 Otherwise, for stuff like air superiority and interception you probably don't need TNT armor considering you're already fast and agile
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:39:52 What if I bombed a TNT cannon
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:39:59 With a motor lock bomb
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:41:10 <@467565971918422017> Can we get Fat Man and Little Boy over there
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:42:07 <@371113735760248832> You do realize conveyor drives and supermanuverability exists, so you'd have to be really good at aiming stuff
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:42:24 Assuming its a SAM cannon
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:42:53 On a tank, I mean it's not hard to damage them badly
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:43:09 If there's one thing you can't protect on a tank, it's their means of transport
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:43:19 Wheels
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:44:48 Sorta like that
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:45:40 Probably isn't that hard to add TNT armor to the sides of my plane alongside the usual blocks
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:45:53 Intakes probably won't get protected due to how thin they are
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:46:03 ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:47:47 The fact that you have that mentality triforce tells me that you're mentally "delayed"
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:48:06 Getting mad over something so petty
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:49:25 Looking at this reminds me a lot of those subreddits with Karens
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:50:04 Reddit is fine, if you're careful that is
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:50:29 Twitter is just chaos
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:52:18 Reddit is what I find to be neutral, still equally as chaotic as Twitter
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:52:47 Also this is becoming a little off topic
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:57:05 You also have to consider physics too, so try a dual propeller plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:57:36 You know why helicopters have tail rotors or two contra-rotating rotors, it's to prevent them from being a glorified fidget spinner
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:58:53 Custom propellers look nice, and conveyor drives don't play nicely with physics
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:59:51 You're gonna have difficulties figuring out to balance everything just to make a conveyor drive fly straight
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:00:57 I've did 12K before
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:01:29 It's just a matter of fine tuning the plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:02:08 All I need really are pitch and roll controls
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:02:25 Yaw's not that useful, I still add vertical stabilizers though
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:03:21 I usually design fighters
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:03:43 I don't use magnets for turning, it's unnatural for me
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:05:13 <@575265449407938560> I've used conveyor drives, less laggy
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:05:48 They're pretty fast, fixedmotors achieved 150k with them
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:07:13 I use custom flaps
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:07:35 Custom flaps are fast and stable
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:07:43 And doesn't lag as much

general 2020-09-17 00:09:59 If I paint a Panther tank pink

plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:15:32 The aerodynamics on that looks like crap, it's blocky and has exposed engines
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:16:17 The last thing you want is to have your engines shot down

general 2020-09-17 10:21:06 Solar panels are external electronics
general 2020-09-17 10:21:23 Literally what you can do is to improve on existing designs
general 2020-09-17 10:21:32 Not make up some marketing buzzwords
general 2020-09-17 10:23:48 <@!448505589983739914> I get it now, it's trying to absorb the energy of my anger from listening to bs
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:26:32 Is a speed of 7K good for an interceptor role for an multirole aircraft?
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:28:28 After adding enough engines, the conveyor drive finally works with minimal pitching
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:28:36 Speed now reaches 670-700, which is a good start
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:29:25 It does tend to move slightly, but not to the point where it's uncontrollable when using the conveyor drive at high speeds
general 2020-09-17 10:30:18 <@!448505589983739914> Is it bad I read that as light pee?
general 2020-09-17 10:30:56 I will setup my USB

plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:32:09 Text?
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:35:05 The only thing I need to change now on my plane are the wings and *maybe* the nose
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 10:36:26 Text is good, they're one sided and no collision
general 2020-09-17 10:43:02 Has the same vibes as online classes
general 2020-09-17 10:54:46 I posted the plane

general 2020-09-17 10:59:33 Okay summarized
general 2020-09-17 11:02:41 Depends on what you're good at tbh

Already half an hour has passed, and there's a lot more I'm gonna install. This is just GIMP
general 2020-09-18 04:31:37 I'm just gonna let it install while Zoom classes start
general 2020-09-18 09:25:41 Suddenly my WiFi is faster
general 2020-09-18 09:25:51 Which means I can download GIMP faster
general 2020-09-18 09:26:41 Sometimes even the simplest of motor locks can help
general 2020-09-18 09:27:05 I literally only used motor locks for the top curvature of my latest build
general 2020-09-18 09:30:33 I mean you could be misremembering stuff
general 2020-09-18 09:31:23 I tried searching for anyone who had future in their username

general 2020-09-18 09:33:15 To install

general 2020-09-20 02:05:00 Do very low torque motor 2s actually work for suspension?
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 02:05:49 The Dassault Mirage 2000 has very chonky intakes
general 2020-09-20 02:07:23 So a fine tuned low torque motor 1?
general 2020-09-20 02:07:49 Motor 2 then, because max angle
general 2020-09-20 02:07:53 Motor 1 only has toggle
general 2020-09-20 02:11:07 Finally image loaded

plane-crazy 2020-09-20 02:48:15 I'm imagining what it'd look like
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 02:48:38 It looks like a suspension is being stretched in pain in my mind
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 02:49:57 A double wishbone makes sense, but a triple wishbone I'd imagine makes no returns or perhaps would even make it worse
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 02:50:32 The only time I could think more than two arms would work is with multi-link suspension
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 02:54:08 If you want upvotes in <#384025409945337856>, you have no choice other than to use cylinder wheels
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 02:54:34 Besides better suspension setups exist for cylinder wheels

plane-crazy 2020-09-20 03:06:50 Use a vertical motor 2 for steering
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 03:07:01 And motor 1 for acceleration

plane-crazy 2020-09-20 05:08:39 The wing design of the plane would be a cranked arrow delta, only rudder for stabilizers
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 05:08:42 Might add canards
general 2020-09-20 05:10:13 how to wing size?

general 2020-09-20 09:12:19 ~~there isn't gonna be any horizontal stabilizers however, so it's up to the delta wing to do that function too~~

plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:16:57 That's motor locked, isn't it?
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:17:27 I usually don't do TNT for motor locks

plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:21:59 Wing panels or lots of experimentation with wedges
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:23:08 Use wing panels for the walls of the intake
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:23:18 Thick walls don't look too good
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:23:51 Part of me wants to know how much I can do with motor lock reduction
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:24:08 I'm planning to only repeat it twice
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:24:25 If not then I guess somewhere close to 9 locked motors then
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:24:51 All I do is just make it stable passively, and lots of fine tuning
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:25:24 I've managed to make a plane fly at 12k, though at that point any faster and you would've sacrificed any form of stability suddenly
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:25:57 <@!447221768520859659> Oh, so is removing the actual delta wing on my 5th gen fighter the reason it can't go any faster than 7K?
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:26:03 Under normal operation it is stable
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:26:09 But faster than that and I die
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:27:13 Yes, that
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:27:21 I can't go faster than 7K due to stability issues
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:27:42 Just the stabilators
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:27:47 The man wing has no actual wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:27:49 Just wedges and half blocks
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:28:04 It has two rudders and two stabilators
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:28:17 But no actual delta wing
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:28:28 oof
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 13:29:58 oh neat I got the rank

plane-crazy 2020-09-20 14:09:42 That's I usually do F-15 style wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 14:09:59 They're usually easy to work with
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 14:10:38 And I've put them to good use
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 14:11:27 Better than the stretched F-16 wings I used to do

general 2020-09-21 00:28:45 Strap that motorized gaming chair to an arcade cabinet, add fans and play
general 2020-09-21 00:31:22 In the ending of Wreck It Ralph 2, in their post credits scene
general 2020-09-21 00:31:29 There is something special there
general 2020-09-21 00:31:43 Right after the Frozen 2 preview

general 2020-09-21 01:06:24 I was about to ask where the 0W0 tank went
general 2020-09-21 01:07:08 HTC Vive
general 2020-09-21 01:07:42 That's one weird looking hair ngl
general 2020-09-21 01:08:13 Wait
general 2020-09-21 01:08:16 Cockraoches
general 2020-09-21 01:08:35 <@527653676022628353> Are you trying to say they want to crawl into our pants
general 2020-09-21 01:09:17 <@447221768520859659> Wait they fly?
general 2020-09-21 01:09:25 That is terrifying
general 2020-09-21 01:10:06 Oh god
general 2020-09-21 01:10:10 I'm on phone

general 2020-09-21 01:32:08 I don't get how someone got F-4 Phantom from this

plane-crazy 2020-09-21 01:35:00 All I do is lots of wing tuning
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 01:35:16 also ew shredder on non-pvp
general 2020-09-21 01:36:46 I dunno, I also just decided to not care about designing a plane in specific
general 2020-09-21 01:37:01 So I just designed what worked best for me
general 2020-09-21 01:37:14 And I got a really pitchy light fighter
general 2020-09-21 01:37:29 Pitch sensitivity is fun
general 2020-09-21 01:37:48 But the lack of any roll dedicated custom flaps means I have to hide the game's default control surfaces
general 2020-09-21 01:37:56 Which are of course assigned to keyboard controls though
general 2020-09-21 01:56:14 Your PC is a keyboard only tablet
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 01:58:50 Then I'd call the police on you
general 2020-09-21 01:59:16 That might actually work on sunrise/dawn
general 2020-09-21 01:59:45 <@456226577798135808> Is that a Nissan GT-R ute?
general 2020-09-21 02:00:09 Reminds me of the Holden Commodore ute

general 2020-09-21 02:04:33 <@417397161198878731> I thought you meant the plane company
general 2020-09-21 02:04:59 Or was it Convair?
general 2020-09-21 02:06:09 Doesn't it have variable camber wings?
general 2020-09-21 02:06:17 Or whatever it was called
general 2020-09-21 02:06:25 Yes that is a nice F-22
general 2020-09-21 02:06:57 What was that thicc plane in WW2?
general 2020-09-21 02:07:28 I think it was called the Fairchild Republic something?
general 2020-09-21 02:07:56 Republic
general 2020-09-21 02:08:03 Only Republic
general 2020-09-21 02:08:10 Republic something
general 2020-09-21 02:09:31 We only have a dozen fighter jets here, and it's the KAI Golden Eagle
general 2020-09-21 02:09:53 Everything else are propeller

general 2020-09-21 02:26:06 I cringed
general 2020-09-21 02:26:17 So bad
general 2020-09-21 02:26:58 What if Minecraft, but it's about eating like in that video
general 2020-09-21 02:27:54 <@407275829299773451> Those old people captured your reaction to the vid itself
general 2020-09-21 02:27:58 Disappointment

general 2020-09-21 02:33:58 One of which is scheduled for 2020
general 2020-09-21 02:34:25 Anyways, I'mma head off now
general 2020-09-21 02:34:45 ~~simp for rick btw~~
general 2020-09-21 02:45:08 Have I found something that isn't the usual cringy weirdness on this site? https://www.deviantart.com/softkeychains/gallery
general 2020-09-21 04:21:04 <#384025409945337856> Cringe at the colors
general 2020-09-21 04:21:44 Which I really don't care much about, considering I usually build planes with locked motors
general 2020-09-21 04:23:35 Don't worry I'll post the actual thing
general 2020-09-21 04:25:29 Okay, back to normal <#384025409945337856>
general 2020-09-21 04:25:40 Back to the usual bland gray
general 2020-09-21 04:25:47 That's at least safer than no-no sand
general 2020-09-21 04:26:28 Still, the plane be looking pretty generic though
general 2020-09-21 04:26:56 It's just a light fighter
general 2020-09-21 04:27:12 I mean I could easily modify it into a Saab Gripen if I wanted to
general 2020-09-21 04:28:27 Sure why not, I don't really do camo though so that would be a good change of pace
general 2020-09-21 04:28:50 Too much work for lazy monke
general 2020-09-21 04:29:14 Maybe I should try making a Saab Gripen for real though
general 2020-09-21 04:29:28 I mean I've already made a platform where I can make any light fighter I desire
general 2020-09-21 04:29:33 As long as it's single engined

plane-crazy 2020-09-21 12:53:44 https://streamable.com/jqhomg I'm dumbfounded by how this works
general 2020-09-21 12:54:01 help I am confused https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/757585357570310265
general 2020-09-21 12:54:10 Just how is this possible
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 12:54:47 Yes, it's floating in the air
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 12:54:56 And I just noticed I let go of Q
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 12:55:02 The button I used to pitch down
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 12:55:21 <@!299289130964090881> I mean it flies perfectly fine at full throttle though
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 12:55:35 Though if I did it again but actually held Q, it just floats there
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 12:55:48 Instead of slowly falling down
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 12:56:10 It was at half throttle at the time, 300ish speed before suddenly pitched up
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 12:57:21 Probably even slower
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 12:58:24 <@!299289130964090881> Well I reproduced it, with careful control I could actually manage to just float in the air
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 12:58:41 I just gotta manage the throttle so it'd sorta float in the air
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 12:58:58 No change in altitude, just try to pitch down
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 12:59:02 And no ballasts or helium
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 12:59:11 Purely using wing design and engines
general 2020-09-21 13:04:53 Can I show something here
general 2020-09-21 13:05:06 https://streamable.com/8ngl3r
https://streamable.com/uu1gh2
general 2020-09-21 13:05:16 Somehow I've managed to make it stay perfectly still wtthout anchors
general 2020-09-21 13:05:24 I'm still confused
general 2020-09-21 13:05:43 Well, it's not hard to recreate
general 2020-09-21 13:05:52 It's just careful management of pitch and throttle
general 2020-09-21 13:05:54 Mostly the latter
general 2020-09-21 13:06:07 Ah, so drag
general 2020-09-21 13:06:18 <@!387195148741771275> Low power
general 2020-09-21 13:06:30 Low power, can work both while attempting to pitch down or up
general 2020-09-21 13:06:53 This one's just a plane's drag forcing it to stay still
general 2020-09-21 13:07:00 At least that's what Maple said
general 2020-09-21 13:07:28 Still, it'd be a neat little trick though to just stay still like that
general 2020-09-21 13:07:48 I wonder if my 5th gen fighter can do that
general 2020-09-21 13:07:57 Just use drag to make a little airshow
general 2020-09-21 13:09:50 Converge, isn't that a new ISP in the Philippines?
general 2020-09-21 13:10:03 ISP meaning internet service provider
general 2020-09-21 13:11:07 I tried doing it on my 5th gen fighter
general 2020-09-21 13:11:12 *It couldn't do it*
general 2020-09-21 13:11:32 The light fighter out of all planes was the one capable of doing that
bot-central 2020-09-21 13:11:48 !servers
general 2020-09-21 13:18:57 There's an Among Us game on Roblox

general 2020-09-21 14:24:12 VTEC, turbo without the turbo
general 2020-09-21 14:32:30 I mean planes can also use non rotating engines
general 2020-09-21 14:32:37 Like flat engines
general 2020-09-21 14:33:01 A clean red Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 3
general 2020-09-21 14:33:10 Pigeon or Peugeot?
general 2020-09-21 14:34:13 I succ at suspensions
general 2020-09-21 14:34:31 I need to watch more tutorials to understand how they work before I go design then by myself
general 2020-09-21 14:34:36 Kinda like me with planes
general 2020-09-21 14:34:50 Started with tutorials before being somewhat independent in design
general 2020-09-21 14:35:13 Different server or different channel?
general 2020-09-21 14:35:30 Car suspension
general 2020-09-21 14:35:52 All I read is uwu and something about being warm
general 2020-09-21 14:36:12 The only tank suspension I had is the trailing arm based design
general 2020-09-21 14:36:23 Or torsion bar, or whatever
general 2020-09-21 14:36:51 Relies on suspension spring instead of motor 2
general 2020-09-21 14:37:05 A horizontal one with a rope for adjustability
general 2020-09-21 14:37:50 Hmm, never made propeller based planes
general 2020-09-21 14:43:08 Is it possible to make a fully automated missile in PC? Or still have the manually control?
general 2020-09-21 14:47:12 <@467765396108476426> How do big plane be smooth?
general 2020-09-21 14:47:25 Like what makes you do the wedge in big scale
general 2020-09-21 14:47:33 For I can only do the wedge in small scale
general 2020-09-21 14:47:36 Like my fighters
general 2020-09-21 14:48:00 That is now our slogan/tagline
general 2020-09-21 14:48:15 If Nike has Just Do It

general 2020-09-21 14:52:22 With how much people asking how to do stuff here on Plane Crazy, what if someone did an official Wiki with strict moderation to avoid low quality help
general 2020-09-21 23:00:31 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMYEE8lvlvA Anyone remember this guy? Been 6 months since his last video (which is this one)
general 2020-09-21 23:00:47 Apparently he's also done this for a decade now
general 2020-09-21 23:05:03 wait
general 2020-09-21 23:05:16 they're already wearing suits in space
general 2020-09-21 23:05:29 Isn't that like a fully body face mask?
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 23:05:55 That's a good build
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 23:06:06 Hopefully it doesn't get abused like sirenhead
general 2020-09-21 23:06:48 > something america coulnt achieve
<@456226577798135808> What did you expect when the country has a lot of Karens and whatever the male equivalent is

oh and a lot of idiots
general 2020-09-21 23:07:14 Like how does one think a mask makes you suffocate
general 2020-09-21 23:07:27 I heard that the only thing that convinced him to wear a mask
general 2020-09-21 23:07:34 Is to say he looks like he's a movie star
general 2020-09-21 23:07:48 Let me search it up
general 2020-09-21 23:09:00

general 2020-09-21 23:52:04 I just noticed that
general 2020-09-21 23:52:25 The 69 turret
plane-crazy 2020-09-21 23:53:13 <@572411935669354528> Roomba but it carries a nuke
general 2020-09-21 23:54:38 The baguette can be weird

general 2020-09-22 00:13:19 Maybe I should try making an English Electric Lightning
general 2020-09-22 01:41:17 <@177743269105500160> That looks like motor lock black magic
general 2020-09-22 01:42:37 I'm never gonna do that kinda stuff
general 2020-09-22 01:42:57 I never go onto public PvP
general 2020-09-22 01:43:25 Plus VIP can sometimes be full or empty
general 2020-09-22 01:45:48 Can planes with TVC in real life actually manage to sorta float vertically?
general 2020-09-22 01:46:45 I think I remember something like that, let me check if it is a thing though
general 2020-09-22 01:56:10 Well I can't find the image, all I remember was its a thrust vectors plane floating sorta vertically
general 2020-09-22 01:56:19 Thrust vectored*
general 2020-09-22 01:59:32 Closest we have is pyramids
general 2020-09-22 02:01:38 How long can a tank's barrel be?
general 2020-09-22 02:02:06 ~~I swear kookie if you make a joke about that~~
general 2020-09-22 02:03:10 If I ever get tired of planes, can someone suggest me the next kind of vehicle to try?
general 2020-09-22 02:03:55 big funni
general 2020-09-22 02:04:49 The person below me eats shit
general 2020-09-22 02:05:29 Don't scroll up, totally didn't edit anything
general 2020-09-22 02:05:50 ***l o n g***
general 2020-09-22 02:06:00 That's what she wants
general 2020-09-22 02:07:00 The magic of editing
general 2020-09-22 02:07:26 <@163143541160148992> He should give lazy students "Johnson's Baby Powder" then
general 2020-09-22 02:08:25 That's a big no-no
general 2020-09-22 02:08:46 Still bad
general 2020-09-22 02:09:01 Don't do the no-no with animals, even if it's fake
general 2020-09-22 02:09:40 Always remember the meme that tells you when it's legal or not to like-like something
general 2020-09-22 02:10:23 Isn't third ban perma?
general 2020-09-22 02:10:49 He will be snapped out of existence
general 2020-09-22 02:10:59 You made us cry
general 2020-09-22 02:11:03 Say goodbye
general 2020-09-22 02:12:37 I mean how are you gonna appeal to wanting to no-no something that can't consent and has no human level intelligence
general 2020-09-22 02:12:47 Anyways I'll stop
general 2020-09-22 02:13:36 I mean JJ Abrams sounded like a name already
general 2020-09-22 02:13:42 Just shortened
general 2020-09-22 02:13:49 Sorta like W.O Bentley
general 2020-09-22 02:14:48 All I know is motor locc, but with rotated motors
general 2020-09-22 02:15:26 <@448505589983739914> Either constantly adopted or gay fathers
general 2020-09-22 02:16:17 wait—
general 2020-09-22 02:16:57 And if you get another dad, well I'll just say you have gay daddies
general 2020-09-22 02:17:05 Well nvm
general 2020-09-22 02:17:13 You say VIP is now your GF
general 2020-09-22 02:17:32 Your totally real GF who has an anime PFP
general 2020-09-22 02:17:51 <@527653676022628353> That gives me big Alabama vibes
general 2020-09-22 02:18:38 Wasn't there in something Bioshock called Big Daddy?
general 2020-09-22 02:19:08 ~~call your father(s) those instead~~
general 2020-09-22 02:19:31 So wait
general 2020-09-22 02:19:39 <@177743269105500160> Are you half liquid then
general 2020-09-22 02:19:50 Are you half empty or half full?
general 2020-09-22 02:20:16 Then your blood is dry then
general 2020-09-22 02:20:20 If you don't have water
general 2020-09-22 02:20:35 Hooray for body shock
general 2020-09-22 02:20:57 You have now the case of organ failure, or whatever dry blood means
general 2020-09-22 02:21:34 What happened to the previous 8 kookies?
general 2020-09-22 02:21:41 👀
general 2020-09-22 02:22:04 You know the saying cats have nine lives?
general 2020-09-22 02:22:11 Well this is your last life
general 2020-09-22 02:22:29 Then become cat
general 2020-09-22 02:22:38 So we can actually say you have nine lives
general 2020-09-22 02:23:16 You are now the property of Microsoft
general 2020-09-22 02:23:24 Along with the rest of TikTok
general 2020-09-22 02:24:05 The Earth is just a giant magnet
general 2020-09-22 02:24:28 I'm repelled
general 2020-09-22 02:26:13 Has Citroen's patent with hydropnuematic suspension expired?
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:27:04 <@645128367611445248> The only vehicle where that works is the Fairey Rotodyne
general 2020-09-22 02:27:28 Off-brand Jimmy Neutron
general 2020-09-22 02:28:20 ~~your apple thing really looks like off-brand jimmy neutron ngl~~
general 2020-09-22 02:28:45 Yes I forgot what they're called
general 2020-09-22 02:29:01 In school
general 2020-09-22 02:29:09 Not really caring for that feature tbh
general 2020-09-22 02:30:03 Does anyone here know how portable VirtualBox works?
general 2020-09-22 02:30:11 I can't seem to install it onto my USB
general 2020-09-22 02:30:52 But how though? There's a pandemic
general 2020-09-22 02:30:57 No he meant walk the dog
general 2020-09-22 02:31:15 Oh wait
general 2020-09-22 02:31:19 Just do social distancing
general 2020-09-22 02:31:33 Over here, we can't come out
general 2020-09-22 02:31:38 Unless it's important stuff
general 2020-09-22 02:31:43 Like food or jobs
general 2020-09-22 02:31:54 Otherwise, you literally have to stay at home
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:32:24 Use lots of wedges
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:32:33 To make it more curved and smooth
general 2020-09-22 02:33:50 There are two factors that affect a population during a pandemic 

1.) Population density 
2.) Population density
general 2020-09-22 02:34:21 <@456226577798135808> That's what the 2nd population density is for
general 2020-09-22 02:34:30 As in, how dense are their intelligence
general 2020-09-22 02:35:24 Gore is NSFL
general 2020-09-22 02:35:35 Who posted that crap
general 2020-09-22 02:35:47 ***K o o k i e***
general 2020-09-22 02:36:13 **@planeje139**
general 2020-09-22 02:37:03 If Covid happened in 1969, would it be called Covid-69?
general 2020-09-22 02:37:15 Nice.
general 2020-09-22 02:37:45 Him
general 2020-09-22 02:39:00 Look what funny Otamatone man did https://youtu.be/kYXLKox7Iqo
general 2020-09-22 02:39:20 Does this mean
general 2020-09-22 02:39:34 "There's a Platypus controlling me" is a meme now
general 2020-09-22 02:40:02 Spootify
general 2020-09-22 02:40:14 Everyone knows Windows Media Player is the best
general 2020-09-22 02:40:57 Jokes aside, I tried listening to a .flac file
general 2020-09-22 02:41:11 Not an audiophile yet to know the difference
general 2020-09-22 02:41:35 Well, any subtle differences between mp3 and the flac file format anyways
general 2020-09-22 02:42:21 AIMP looks like a good music app tbh
general 2020-09-22 02:42:41 Reminds me of WinAmp but actually better
general 2020-09-22 02:43:03 I don't have any Apple branded devices
general 2020-09-22 02:43:24 Plus I'm cheap, so I went for free
general 2020-09-22 02:43:29 Which isn't all bad
general 2020-09-22 02:44:01 Having to find the .flac files online though means I have to be careful
general 2020-09-22 02:44:08 Or Ill end up downloading malware
general 2020-09-22 02:45:05 That's what I like Reddit for
general 2020-09-22 02:45:17 The neat stuff, not cringe
general 2020-09-22 02:45:47 <@430394898726780940> And the games made by shit developers
general 2020-09-22 02:46:13 Russians do a lot of technical software stuff don't they?
general 2020-09-22 02:47:06 Are all the good free stuff online usually are Free and Open Source Software?
general 2020-09-22 02:47:39 I watched in the cinema, before Demonitization-19
general 2020-09-22 02:48:55 <@456226577798135808> Streaming services...

***Disney+ would like to access your bank account***
general 2020-09-22 02:49:14 I wonder if Netflix has taken down the no-no show
general 2020-09-22 02:49:23 The one with children in a dance group
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:50:39 What's Cado?
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:51:19 Also, I should probably adopt a new building technique for cars
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:51:33 You know the Body on Frame construction adopted irl?
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:52:08 Do that but motor lock the body onto the chassis/secondary details
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:52:26 oh ok
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:53:22 How strong would body on frame be in PC?
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:53:37 Assuming I filled the gaps with TNT armor
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:54:47 Cooter boog
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:54:55 Cooter booger
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:55:20 You're not harassed
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:55:35 There's a difference between criticism and actual harassment
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:55:38 Snowflake
general 2020-09-22 02:56:14 What if I did body on frame construction in Plane Crazy
general 2020-09-22 02:56:23 Where the frame is TNT armor
general 2020-09-22 02:56:28 And secondary details
general 2020-09-22 02:56:34 It's for cars
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:57:19 This is the internet, stop getting triggered over an in-game thing
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:57:40 Get triggered if it's an actual issue worth getting mad about
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:58:05 They haven't
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:58:17 Can we just agree to stop this
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:58:42 <@459442244265705504> 15 and acts like a normal person
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 02:59:29 I'll just let you two fight, this is the Internet 

People like to fight in it
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:00:14 <@318291033626771457> If you want people to not join then go into the DMs 

You're being a snowflake, you're just blissfully being unaware
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:00:34 You want people to defend you, but not criticize you
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:00:45 Being a snowflake is a quality only other people can tell you
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:01:02 You can't really measure if you're a snowflake or not
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:01:28 No, you wanted to me to get out so you can benefit yourself
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:01:52 Sir, you haven't seen bullying
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:02:18 I've seen people being harassed online for their sexuality 

This is just petty ***eW sHrEdDeR***
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:02:52 Jail would probably have some fun watching over us
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:03:27 Be like everyone else, just stop and forget
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:03:44 Every argument could simply be ended it you just stop and forget about it
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:04:30 <@318291033626771457> You saying that really makes me think you haven't played enough PvP 

I've heard people being able to target shredders
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:05:06 While I myself don't PvP, there are people who can wield the mouse
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:06:01 <@645128367611445248> This is literally like talking to a child 

Always biased towards their benefit
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:07:02 <@572411935669354528> If he wanted actual bullying, he should've went to social media 

This is literally a very petty thing to get triggered about, so my point about him being a snowflake still stands
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:07:15 You know nothing about bullying m8
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:07:49 Either you're some stupid unde or you're a troll
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:08:06 Here's an example of bullying 

I've been forced fed paper in school
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:08:12 This is a petty argument
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:08:24 And its dirty floor crumpled paper
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:08:34 It happened in 6th grade
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:08:58 I'm in 10th grade, I never forgave the people who did them to me since at the core they never changed
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:10:20 Anyways, I'll leave this chat

No point staying here, he won't listen and actually deal with it, instead makes a big fuss
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:11:17 Also 

Someone in Indonesia was doxxed for being gay, it happened on Twitter 

*Now that's cyber bullying. This is a pretty argument*
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:11:25 They're a teen also from what I remember, or a young adult
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:11:58 You're a teen getting triggered over a normal Internet argument
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:12:24 Stop trying to defend yourself, be mature.

Nobody defends themselves for such a long time over such a little thing
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:12:37 Nobody really cares if you have a gunner/shredder bug
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:12:58 People just don't like it because shredders in general are low effort cheap tactics
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:13:08 Shredders are dumb
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:13:49 Can we just stop, there's no point in continuing 

Honestly anyone who lets an argument go on for something this small is pathetic
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:14:08 There is no meta, just skill and clever "engineering"
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:14:43 I give up, I already wasted the remaining battery on this fucking stupid thing
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:14:57 All I could say before I go is
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:15:03 ***Dude, chill***
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:15:48 <@572554184285749259> Block, until the mods do actual mute
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 03:16:07 > if you both just forget what this convo was about and move on then it will be fine
<@435946988559925248> let's do this
general 2020-09-22 07:57:25 > hes calling wedges crap
<@!556724758176333874> Don't listen to him if that's the first piece of advice he gives
general 2020-09-22 07:57:54 I'm waiting for classes to end
general 2020-09-22 07:58:07 Shinx, that be one red hot sword
general 2020-09-22 07:58:50 I misread that as chutter
general 2020-09-22 07:58:58 Mechs too much effort
general 2020-09-22 07:59:10 I'm too lazy for mechs
general 2020-09-22 07:59:14 But cutter is crinj
general 2020-09-22 07:59:45 rick is here
general 2020-09-22 07:59:52 Crinje139
general 2020-09-22 08:00:40 I don't know what it is but that looks nice
general 2020-09-22 08:02:12 What specific Gundam?
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 08:03:08 "A funny dog girl with dual-colored unkept hair and a petite bust size"
I immediately thought of nekos but dogs
general 2020-09-22 08:04:02 I was about to ask are you trying to make a sprite
general 2020-09-22 08:04:06 But then I saw the name
general 2020-09-22 08:04:55 Well I'll go make an English Electric Lightning or a car later
general 2020-09-22 08:06:09 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/495286269459300364/757802917301452811 Is this AI trying to say after climate change is the end?
general 2020-09-22 08:07:02 Jet or rocket?
general 2020-09-22 08:07:15 Either one can work
general 2020-09-22 08:07:27 Not enough plane
general 2020-09-22 08:07:32 Needs more ***r o u n d***
general 2020-09-22 08:08:06 <@!615876745710534676> Well, my brain was about to ask what are you making but then I realize I don't need that question to be answered if the answer is in the image itself
general 2020-09-22 08:08:13 You're using a site to make sprites/pixel art
general 2020-09-22 08:08:35 also brb/gtg
general 2020-09-22 12:57:46 Did I just read "does grass bounce"?
general 2020-09-22 12:58:41 "I'm just gonna go kill myself"

That's literally every attention seeking kid on the internet, the kind where they rage over a petty loss on Xbox
general 2020-09-22 12:59:30 Look, part of living life is finding friends to support you, and to try your best to go through whatever problems you have

And I'm not kidding
general 2020-09-22 13:00:03 Even though I've been bullied, I can't relate to being depressed

*That's because I get constantly pissed instead*
general 2020-09-22 13:00:17 ***P A N I C C***
general 2020-09-22 13:00:22 ***P A N I N I C C***
general 2020-09-22 13:01:14 <@!615876745710534676> Is it normal to hold a grudge against bullies for trying to make life hell?
general 2020-09-22 13:02:22 **Y'all should calm down**

Seriously, this chat has became chaos
general 2020-09-22 13:05:19 Okay, so I see two sides here

StormChaser here is trying to seek attention, because if we have to be honest we already know the difference between real suicidal depression and faking it for attention.

> Lol

This honestly implies that StormChaser is just being a troll, and also judging by his username either has been one for a long time or is an unde thinking it's cool to be insensitive

MilkChocolateChan on the other hand is encouraging suicide. While it is out of blind rage, which while understandable, it's still encouragement
general 2020-09-22 13:05:56 <@!335599526414909451> Can we please get slow mode and kick/ban StormChaser, or at least warn him for insensitivity
general 2020-09-22 13:06:15 There, the chat has calmed down
general 2020-09-22 13:07:02 <@!448505589983739914> I feel like I should avoid <#497142796961054721> when chat activity is at an all time high

It usually ends up being this kind of crap
general 2020-09-22 13:07:30 <@456226577798135808> pls no they might slow mode it too
general 2020-09-22 13:08:30 He's either a troll or an underaged user, both is bad
general 2020-09-22 13:09:01 <@!409676438682206218> ~~he seriously gives me xbox kid edgelord vibes~~
general 2020-09-22 13:11:22 very
general 2020-09-22 13:11:40 <@456226577798135808> Scroll up to see the chaos that resulted in slow mode
general 2020-09-22 13:16:14 I'm gonna go do an off-roader, double wishbone in front while modified swing axle at the back
general 2020-09-22 13:17:02 I have an idea

Private jet but interceptor performance
general 2020-09-22 13:17:14 Should I go do that as a little side project?
general 2020-09-22 13:17:38 ok
general 2020-09-22 13:17:59 Guess I'll go build a private jet interceptor thing after the car
general 2020-09-22 13:21:50 Don't anger the mommy mods and daddy mods
general 2020-09-22 13:22:22 Because they're tired of it?
general 2020-09-22 13:22:42 well crap didn't save when I got disconnected
general 2020-09-22 13:24:41 Wasn't there a proposed Mikoyan private jet, but got cancelled?

general 2020-09-22 13:26:31 This is the kind of private jet I wanna build, and also there's a strong rainstorm outside
general 2020-09-22 13:27:10 It's a pretty fast interceptor right, well I want a really fast private jet

creations-chat 2020-09-22 14:27:32 I got pinged 

Looking at the images of it's rear, decided to leave a tiny gap for the F-15's engines
creations-chat 2020-09-22 14:29:21 I mean the images I found online shows it isn't squished as in no space

general 2020-09-23 01:21:11 <@!615876745710534676> I have a basic truck carrying a motor locked missile
general 2020-09-23 01:21:44 It follows the classic formula for ramming stuff
general 2020-09-23 01:21:49 Lots of mass + Lots of speed
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 01:23:55 I gotta figure out how to build the nose on this thing, wanted to build a private jet while trying to retain the performance of an interceptor
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 01:24:53 Basically, something like the Mig-25 VIP transport
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 01:28:06 Yes
general 2020-09-23 03:30:42 It's happening

general 2020-09-23 03:31:26 As a Filipino, I don't get why we have to bring our nationality tbh
general 2020-09-23 03:32:57 If it's related to those memes about Russia, the US and other big name countries

Well they've established those reputations, that's why you see memes about communism and stuff
general 2020-09-23 03:38:06 That's actually the first build I made in game
general 2020-09-23 03:38:58 I'm still struggling with private jet noses
general 2020-09-23 03:40:47 I wanna build something like the Mig-25 VIP transport
general 2020-09-23 03:41:16 <@!177743269105500160> Remember, TikTok's about as good as YouTube Kids
general 2020-09-23 03:41:46 <@!447221768520859659> The community killed any chances for me to get interested tbh

plane-crazy 2020-09-23 04:13:44 It's not the first time I've seen a helicarrier
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 04:13:55 And the level of quality on his private jet just sucks
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 04:14:07 Immediately despawned
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 04:14:18 But damn it looks generic, complete with abnormally short nose

plane-crazy 2020-09-23 04:16:13 He's gone now, replaced by someone ***MUCH*** better
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 04:24:44 I'm almost tempted to say "doing your mom" just to trigger them, but no not a jerk
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 04:25:50 "Step on me"
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 04:26:07 Does this guy have a "getting stepped on" "thing" or something

plane-crazy 2020-09-23 09:33:07 Such a toxic snowflake
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 09:33:27 You'd think he came from nuclear winter/fallout
general 2020-09-23 12:39:37 It actually does

general 2020-09-23 12:40:05 Heinz also has sold a ranch dressing and ketchup combo in a single bottle
general 2020-09-23 12:40:24 Yes, and I don't know how ranch tastes like
general 2020-09-23 12:40:33 I'm curious how kranch tastes like
general 2020-09-23 12:41:15 Well, guess I'll stick to regular ketchup then
general 2020-09-23 12:41:27 When I dip my fries in ketchup, I make sure it really gets dipped in there
general 2020-09-23 12:41:58 I'm fine with the taste of ketchup, adds flavor for my tastes
general 2020-09-23 12:42:24 At least with fries and other food compatible with the 'chup

general 2020-09-23 12:44:20 I wonder how adding engines to the side would do onto the plane
general 2020-09-23 12:44:59 Probably would end up being similar to a stretched Sukhoi Flanker at the back with the bulge sticking out at the back

general 2020-09-23 12:58:22 At 262.35 KB that's about as large as a decent image
general 2020-09-23 12:58:31 Probably comprehensive

plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:27:27 I am currently doing some basic design for now
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:28:02 So Guggi lives in the many germs of man
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:28:26 I wonder if Australia still makes V8 sport sedans
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:28:33 Or at least fast V6 sedans
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:29:05 Yeah but I heard the stuff that happened to Holden
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:29:33 Do they still make new sport sedans?
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:29:55 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:30:16 Yes, and General Motors has the big yellow cross
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:30:30 I know
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:30:36 Holden is lion
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:30:57 They also have the luxurious Detroit shield
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:31:11 And premium Buick that nobody seems to care about nowadays
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:31:24 Even less attention than Lincoln
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:31:44 Of course, the Commodore
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:32:04 Honestly I could joke about the Holden Commodore being the national car and I'd be somewhat right
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:39:16 Back 

In the Philippines, the market's dominated by the Japanese with their economy cars and motorcycles (the latter especially for those who can't afford a car)

It's followed by SUVs, Ford and Chevrolets of various classes
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:39:30 For luxury, expect German and Japanese
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:39:47 For tuner, of course it'd Japanese
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:39:57 Oh and we also have compact trucks here
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:40:49 Compact trucks like the Ford Ranger, it's smaller than an F-150
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:41:32 It's still large though compared to your typical Japanese economy car
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:41:59 It's a Ford
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:42:52 My dad told me he once had a Ford Falcon, I'd believe him since his family had what I believe to be a 50s or below Dodge
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:43:57 I just like cars in general, as long as they're interesting enough
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:45:45 I don't even see any Lamborghinis here, at least not yet
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:46:04 I have seen a Porsche roadster/spyder though
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:47:06 That looks like a car a government official/executive would drive, at least in its time
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:48:06 Has anyone outside of Japan seen a Toyota Century?
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:49:04 Imagine Lexie being Mercedes-Benz/BMW, now imagine Toyota luxury cars sold under the Toyota brand being like a Rolls-Royce
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:49:28 I mean they've done the Toyota Century for a long time
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:50:00 Autocorrect and lag
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:50:06 Lexus*
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:50:31 Plus I've heard Toyota branded luxury cars ain't cheap
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:51:06 That's a nice GT
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:51:42 The current generation of GTs are exclusive, aren't they?
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:52:09 Wing doors...
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:52:25 300 SL or SLS AMG?
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:53:29 It is a 300 SL
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:53:37 I recognize that iconic look
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:53:59 That's the rare BMW M1
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:54:18 I've heard BMW worked with Lamborghini to make the csr
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:54:26 The latter doing engine work I believe
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:54:44 Haven't seen the C8 Corvette also puri
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:55:44 The Audi Quattro Group B rally car is absurd
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:56:39 The Ford RS200 is also nice
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:57:21 Herisson, a really good plane builder
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:58:36 If Plane Crazy had f3x, Herisson would probably build the most realistic looking ***Succ***hoi Flanker
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:59:06 Ive seen you more often
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 14:59:21 But Plane Crazy is limited by w e d g e
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 15:00:52 I know, but you can only do so much before either the physical limitations or lag kicks in, at least when trying to be hyperrealistic
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 15:01:30 Still, motor locks are very useful
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 15:02:10 If I could make TNT explode in public non PvP then that would be great for my motor locks
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 15:02:45 That way, I can flex upon the common folk without getting destroyed
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 15:06:14 If it's executed well, then I'm fine with changing up stuff

general 2020-09-23 15:15:06 <@195253906333368320> Dang people be simping over you
general 2020-09-23 15:15:29 <@347182144873037824> No balance
general 2020-09-23 15:16:21 I have two accounts, and another one which I abandoned due to cringier name
general 2020-09-23 15:16:45 <@177743269105500160> Why would ever say that?
general 2020-09-23 15:16:58 Make it neko but bunny girl
general 2020-09-23 15:17:23 Obc should wear bunny ears irl
general 2020-09-23 15:17:30 And pretend to be a bunny girl/boi
general 2020-09-23 15:17:38 Aight cya
general 2020-09-23 15:19:02 Just a question, what happened to the chat when pyromaster5555 said 

"obc's fursona is a rabbit girl"
general 2020-09-23 15:19:09 I wanna know what ensued
general 2020-09-23 15:19:37 Actually no I forgot the search bar exists
general 2020-09-23 15:19:51 I can see more chat chaos
general 2020-09-23 15:20:01 Of course <@660019099430289418>
general 2020-09-23 15:20:25 Now say uwu when you come back
general 2020-09-23 15:20:43 <@347182144873037824> Because software engineers called it like that
general 2020-09-23 15:21:01 They are racist
general 2020-09-23 15:21:11 F o r g
general 2020-09-23 15:22:12 People do weird stuff
general 2020-09-23 15:22:28 Anything can be weird
general 2020-09-23 15:22:40 Just look at the FNaF/Undertale fandom
general 2020-09-23 15:22:57 Honestly it feels like a short year for me
general 2020-09-23 15:23:19 Is there such a thing as fandomcist?
general 2020-09-23 15:23:42 what is it not capitalist pig?
general 2020-09-23 15:24:28 Is every fandom weird?
general 2020-09-23 15:25:24 S t e l t h
general 2020-09-23 15:26:21 When you said not showing up on radar, I think of stealth aircraft/bombers
general 2020-09-23 15:27:00 But why would there be an airshow over a residential area
general 2020-09-23 15:27:18 Anakin, do not panakin
general 2020-09-23 15:27:26 You have a planakin, Pigglekin
general 2020-09-23 15:28:12 Well, goodnight y'all
general 2020-09-23 15:28:22 ~~And remember to stay weird~~
general 2020-09-23 15:29:24 It's 11:30 

I will spend the last percentage on depressed bird app
general 2020-09-23 15:29:45 No not that, that's bird torture
general 2020-09-23 15:30:08 The blue bird that once got anthropomorphized
general 2020-09-23 15:30:15 That's what I'm talking about
general 2020-09-23 15:30:37 The chaotic neutral social media filled with heckin loud tweeters
general 2020-09-23 15:31:06 no ***us***
general 2020-09-23 15:32:02 <@392334096560554001> No, you're anti communication 

***Communist***
general 2020-09-23 15:32:14 Fr I should go before this chat distracts me more
general 2020-09-23 15:32:44 ***y e s***
general 2020-09-23 15:32:51 Rotat e faster
general 2020-09-23 15:33:02 Hold birb like banana
general 2020-09-23 15:33:15 Do MadKun
general 2020-09-23 15:33:22 So we ship
general 2020-09-23 15:34:08 <@347182144873037824> Your turtle will like cockatiels then 

They look a bit like blushing bananas/Pikachu birb
general 2020-09-23 15:34:44 He is hooman
general 2020-09-23 15:34:58 Hoomans will eat anything given enough stupidity
general 2020-09-23 15:35:24 Yes that's why we're inside
general 2020-09-23 15:35:32 Our species ate a bat
general 2020-09-23 15:35:45 Bat soup anyone?
general 2020-09-23 15:35:59 Y u c k
general 2020-09-23 15:36:18 Delete before a mod warns you
general 2020-09-23 15:36:43 Well good luck then
general 2020-09-23 15:36:56 Reptile go roar
general 2020-09-23 15:37:22 ***Ohlins suspension***
general 2020-09-23 15:37:32 Olindenver
general 2020-09-23 15:37:51 Hello Mr. Denver
general 2020-09-23 15:37:57 Colorado
general 2020-09-23 15:38:16 Aight, I'll call you olin
general 2020-09-23 15:38:36 Maybe Ohlins as a joke sometime
general 2020-09-23 15:38:52 My bat's at 15% now
general 2020-09-23 15:39:36 There is only one good bat in this server
general 2020-09-23 15:39:41 And that is bat mom
general 2020-09-23 15:39:54 Anyways i should go (again)
general 2020-09-23 15:40:04 Procrastination be darned
general 2020-09-23 15:40:10 It's 11:40
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 22:47:46 wait passengers inside a blimp

**wait, that's illegal**
general 2020-09-23 22:53:21 On a scale 1-10, how dangerous would it be to place passengers *inside* a zeppelin?
general 2020-09-23 22:53:47 A type of rigid airship that uses hydrogen, a flammable gas
general 2020-09-23 22:54:51 <@!432344306427101184> Worry more when it begins to stand on two legs
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 22:56:04 <@!459442244265705504> Leak goes the zeppelin, and burn goes the whole ship with just one cig
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 22:56:27 Or probably suffocate the passengers when there's a leak
general 2020-09-23 22:58:24 I think Roblox doesn't have an algorithm

Look at some of these recommends
general 2020-09-23 22:58:40 Organize your desktop, it looks like the icons are fleeing
general 2020-09-23 22:59:32 I mean if I wanted to roleplay I would've gone onto those roleplaying Discord servers
general 2020-09-23 22:59:35 They're a thing
general 2020-09-23 22:59:44 At least they're better than Roblox roleplays
general 2020-09-23 23:00:00 Mostly because the Discord ToS prevents underaged users and their cringe on here
general 2020-09-23 23:00:30 <@!671156550546751550> Actually, you're not wrong. You're right
general 2020-09-23 23:00:43 It is just a reskinned popular games
general 2020-09-23 23:01:21 Roblox is a miss or hit when it comes to recommending
general 2020-09-23 23:01:54 I just realized your name
general 2020-09-23 23:02:01 is pronounced like the company Siemens
general 2020-09-23 23:02:51 ~~funni name~~
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 23:05:26 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/758440427568627782 wait doesn't the lightning have a short nose?
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 23:07:18 Gave it an upvote
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 23:08:17 SAME is the company that owns Lamborghini Trattori
general 2020-09-23 23:09:47 <@!479298992874979328> For someone named FixerWiser he really ain't wise, nor does he fix his crap
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:10:44 I keep misreading NereRear as NereBear the first time I saw them
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:10:55 smol text is smol
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:11:05 There's two kinds of VTOLs
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:11:16 Propeller and jet based
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:12:16 <@!563462654090543114> I remember my old builds

*They were cringe*
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:12:33 My newer builds were at least decent
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:12:40 Locked motors and wedges and that kind of stuff
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:13:02 I've used them already
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:13:09 On a regular basis
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:13:22 The first significant usage of them was on my 5th gen fighter
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:15:12 Somebody once told me that's a sad life to live
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:15:36 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:15:42 Can't tell people how to live their life
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:16:09 It is downvote worthy, but not the worst thing I've seen
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:16:25 I still remember that one time someone wanted to unexist in <#497142796961054721>
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:17:26 <@!563462654090543114> They were probably just seeking attention

Some discussion later, they probably were considering people thought he was immature
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:17:29 But not unde at least
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:35:58 I've made a map suggestion <@273536574770380800>
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:36:11 Yes
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:36:18 Kinda detailed
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:36:45 <@456226577798135808> Walk away and ignore
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:40:03 <@273536574770380800> Pretty normal for me 

Look at the Holden Commodore ute
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:40:14 That's normal in the upside down land
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:40:43 The stance though, it bothers me
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:40:56 Those wheels bother me more
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:41:17 Also why make it a truck if the suspension go delete
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:42:04 It's like deleting what made the Land Rover Range Rover good
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 23:44:22 That reminds me, I should add more TNT onto one of my planes
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 23:44:53 Even though I'll probably forget about PvP again
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:46:56 I have the high ground, Tankakin
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:47:12 Literally
creations-chat 2020-09-23 23:48:33 Truck but van
creations-chat 2020-09-24 01:55:39 For a carrier, nothing is too long
creations-chat 2020-09-24 01:56:01 Length makes it easier for aircraft to land
creations-chat 2020-09-24 01:57:59 Also, width makes it easier for good aircraft to land
creations-chat 2020-09-24 01:58:09 Emphasis on good
creations-chat 2020-09-24 01:58:44 And yours looks better anyways
creations-chat 2020-09-24 01:59:53 Weight makes it harder for others to ram you while making it easier to ram others
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:00:04 Assuming you have the speed
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:00:31 Good
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:00:55 Custom engines/drives and locked motors are a blessing in this game
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:01:16 <@456226577798135808> "We're blasting off again"
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:01:28 Because physics throttle
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:01:37 That's the curse part
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:02:05 Make sure your ship doesn't end up flying
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:02:32 On my planes, good wing design is what keeps me from pitching extremely
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:03:26 I just use one conveyor drive for stability reasons
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:03:37 ***m e m e***
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:04:18 So
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:04:28 Gonna make you cry 
Say goodbye?
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:04:51 Desert the ship
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:05:18 > Tell a lie
<@456226577798135808> Youre not gonna make him die then
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:05:34 <@628523381209169930> ***v o m i t***

creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:07:13 <@581846949901369365> Choke with toaster then add water
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:07:43 **kookie no**
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:07:52 No horns in the chat
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:08:20 The chat's brain has died
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:08:45 <@456226577798135808> That eggplant has flavoring inside, so you might make a mess
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:09:16 I like to call undes, undies
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:09:41 Ah, so the r word
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:10:07 I've done that before but as a missile
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:10:23 Couldn't make them explode upon crashing
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:10:28 Just the tip
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:10:46 So I end up having to manually detonate them
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:10:58 Rickje said he'll keep it as a feature
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:11:09 <#504436696021204992> read one of the denied suggestions
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:13:42 You're known for being a cookie with a microwave with a burger
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:14:30 I just have designer IV

creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:15:45 Weeb is weeb
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:16:17 <@456226577798135808> Twist: They actually think she's food
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:16:46 They smell the mammal in her
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:16:58 Of course we embrace the doggo
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:17:12 <@456226577798135808> You are doge
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:17:15 The best doggo
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:17:23 I wanna be the raptor that thonks
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:18:24 How much does ogre eye cost? One of my friends has a literal PlayStation for an avatar
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:18:38 Doggeh!
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:18:43 What happened to Doggo?
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:19:12 <@456226577798135808> What happened to Doggo? Doggeh.
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:19:45 <#504436696021204992> is what happens when <#495286269459300364> and <#497142796961054721> had a baby out of wedlock
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:20:24 I misread video as waifu
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:21:09 Buying a body pillow is hardcore simp
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:22:04 <@581846949901369365> That's a tasteful body pillow 

But where's ***D O N K E H***
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:22:45 Ate him in pieces or whole?
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:23:05 Wipe out half of every fandom
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:23:52 <@456226577798135808> Nah it's more fun kicking people down a hole and screaming the name of the place you're in
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:24:09 ~~totally not referencing a dead, ancient meme~~
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:24:51 What if we delete all the NSFW
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:24:58 No matter how good or bad
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:25:50 **This is <#504436696021204992>**
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:26:10 That looks like that kid coupe thing
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:26:13 But it got matured
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:26:20 <@456226577798135808> Add rusty nails
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:26:47 If the bat doesn't do it, then tetanus would
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:27:09 I know
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:27:16 Wait no too controversial
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:28:08 <@710208141144489995> Reminds me or Pixel Gun 3D but it's off brand Minecraft
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:30:08 Let's invent a machine that digitizes anything so we can let undes feel the pain of shredders and weapon spam 

~~and y'all can have your waifus or whatever the heck you're into~~
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:31:03 I prefer Plane Crazy and Minecraft, with redstone or mods of course
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:31:14 Redstone makes any Minecraft session fun with enough tinkering
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:31:19 Same goes with mods
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:31:37 <@710208141144489995> Sounds like Twitter
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:32:40 > <@289930922655088640> I mean you're not wrong
<@456226577798135808> I know, I've seen a lot of grooming on that site and a lot of callouts

creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:38:05 I have a lot of apps
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:38:21 Like it almost fills storage kind of full
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:38:36 Nope, but I could get it
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:38:47 But I'm really fine tbh
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:38:59 I'd probably delete after enough pain
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:40:17 ***it looks like those generic play store cringe***
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:40:45 I'd rather pirate than play that unironically
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:42:07 I wonder if Androeed has more good ALPs 

They usually make hacked APKs of games, and they actually work
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:42:50 I mean this ain't a Mercedes
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:43:09 Does Porsche make tanks?
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:43:34 Like does Porsche actually make tanks?
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:46:14 Careful someone might do her
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:46:41 What if I motor locc smoke pipe?
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:47:20 So no t h e e c k smoke?
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:47:57 You know what else is hot?
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:48:16 The temperature of this phone when I play a heckin decent game
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:48:30 Seriously, this 32 bit Snapdragon 801 is a bottleneck
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:48:43 All processors today use 64 bits
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:49:32 The AMD A series looks like a decent CPU ngl
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:49:48 Higher end models could compete with the Intel i3
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:50:07 After that, it's the Ryzen's job to compete with the i Series
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:50:16 idk
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:50:37 <@658140951273013248> Let the body hit an incoming plane

creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:51:05 Imagine not using a computer fueled by uranium
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:51:25 It is
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:51:27 Just slowly
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:51:54 Your room is filled with soot
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:52:03 Diesel man >:(

creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:53:08 But how will you cool the computer when it's ***h o t***
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:53:31 Here's a random thought but has someone made a computer girl?
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:53:43 Like a literal computer girl, because if it did then I'm done
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:54:39 <@456226577798135808> before you slep
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:54:43 Ship girls exist
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:54:57 Anime ship girls
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:55:01 Girls that are ships
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:55:26 Not aeromorph style, just anime girls
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:55:52 It's a distant memory but I remember finding out about them during a random browsing session
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:55:58 Not sure it its in a game or anime
creations-chat 2020-09-24 02:57:17 <@456226577798135808> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantai_Collection

Is there a version with planes so we can replace aeromorphs
general 2020-09-24 03:01:54 > So ill get like 20 super rockets inside my jet
For most, this isn't enough
general 2020-09-24 03:02:37 I made a suggestion about the map
general 2020-09-24 03:02:43 I haven't drawn anything about it though
general 2020-09-24 03:04:02 <@363742162757877761> You think the map needs more variety? I was thinking the maps games like Forza has except more water
general 2020-09-24 03:04:06 A lot more water
general 2020-09-24 03:04:30 That's exactly the kind of map I was thinking of when I suggested in <#507673335816126509>
general 2020-09-24 03:05:18 Honestly just copy Driving Simulator's homework
general 2020-09-24 03:05:32 But add more off-road
general 2020-09-24 03:07:45 Add a city so we can distance ourselves from roleplayers, more water for naval battles, an actual port so we can load vehicles into ships, a motocross style stadium for suspension experts and a better airport because we ain't tiny
general 2020-09-24 03:08:00 Also, battles in a city
general 2020-09-24 03:08:11 Exactly
general 2020-09-24 03:08:25 We can distance ourselves from role players
general 2020-09-24 03:08:44 <@347182144873037824> That means we finally have space away from roleplayers
general 2020-09-24 03:09:08 So other players can focus onto building stuff
general 2020-09-24 03:09:19 Should I try making my own map?
general 2020-09-24 03:10:26 Actually, you're not wrong now that I think about it
general 2020-09-24 03:11:11 <@618489590805823503> ***flashbacks to seeing a Sans statue on wheels***
general 2020-09-24 03:11:30 An ugly Sans 2D statue
general 2020-09-24 03:11:40 A box
general 2020-09-24 03:11:56 Cheap SR-71 Blackbird

general 2020-09-24 03:13:37 They made a Sonic sona
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 03:14:23 Should I try drawing a map?
general 2020-09-24 03:15:05 At least memorials are more thoughtful
general 2020-09-24 03:15:47 Doesn't mean people would actually try to knock it down
general 2020-09-24 03:16:01 Also dumb dumb doesn't realize TNT won't explode
general 2020-09-24 03:18:54 Tell the owner of the server to ban him from now on
general 2020-09-24 03:18:59 No warnings, just ban
general 2020-09-24 03:19:28 I'll go off of Discord now
general 2020-09-24 04:01:48 How to not make nose pitch up on it's own?
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 04:01:49 I think I made a mistake because now I have the problem of nose pitching instead of nose dives
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 04:02:36 I'm not so sure how to fix this, and ballasts don't do anything
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 04:02:45 Helium's just cheating and doesn't make the plane fly right
general 2020-09-24 04:03:29 <@!525244805756878889> Most of the wings are located within somewhere around the mid to rear section of the plane https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/758538661485740052
general 2020-09-24 04:04:10 I did density 10
general 2020-09-24 04:04:13 It didn't do anything
general 2020-09-24 04:04:38 The pitching really is that bad
general 2020-09-24 04:05:26 It pitches more with speed
general 2020-09-24 04:05:37 I think I'll go delete wings and retry
general 2020-09-24 04:07:50 Center of Lift and Center of Mass don't look so right
general 2020-09-24 04:07:55 On the other hand, I never gave a crap about them
general 2020-09-24 04:08:00 Yet all of my planes flew fine
general 2020-09-24 04:08:08 Except for this one
general 2020-09-24 04:09:49 Apparently I just needed to shift more weight upfront
general 2020-09-24 04:10:53 Which means this plane really needs a lot more ballasts than usual
general 2020-09-24 04:11:54 I'm being terrorized by cringy earrape music
general 2020-09-24 04:13:39 A clusterfuck of them, being played all at once
general 2020-09-24 04:13:44 Then cringified even more
general 2020-09-24 04:13:55 Like you'd think it came from 2010
general 2020-09-24 04:14:45 This plane could use more engines, 500 without afterburners is unsatisfactory for a SSBJ
general 2020-09-24 04:22:06 Needs less pitching up
general 2020-09-24 04:22:18 Plane can't go past 7k without extreme pitching
general 2020-09-24 04:22:35 Already set the conveyor to speed 60
general 2020-09-24 04:28:45 Managed to slow down the climb rate when using conveyor drive afterburner
general 2020-09-24 04:28:52 Still does it but at a more acceptable speed
general 2020-09-24 04:30:10 Almost reached 10k before the pitch limits it from going any faster
creations-chat 2020-09-24 04:31:44 
creations-chat 2020-09-24 04:31:45 
creations-chat 2020-09-24 04:31:52 Did some progress on my SSBJ (Supersonic Business Jet)
creations-chat 2020-09-24 04:32:07 Well, gonna head off to online classes now
general 2020-09-24 04:34:58 A supersonic business jet
general 2020-09-24 04:35:33 I've heard the fastest controllable speed on an aircraft in this game is 16k
general 2020-09-24 04:35:53 Meanwhile fixmotors has done 250k on a shredder
general 2020-09-24 04:36:08 Well, I'm gonna use that as a reference point then
general 2020-09-24 04:37:16 I've only used one max speed (60) conv. eng
general 2020-09-24 04:38:32 I only have 8 GB
general 2020-09-24 04:38:37 Just normie RAM
general 2020-09-24 04:39:19 I should really install Linux to reduce RAM usage, Windows be taking up like 4 GB of RAM
general 2020-09-24 04:40:28 It's sluggish
general 2020-09-24 04:40:40 Add on top  with a Celeron and you got stop motion
general 2020-09-24 04:40:51 So netbooks are the worst way to play
general 2020-09-24 04:41:39 Upgrade to an i3/Ryzen 3 or an high end AMD A-Series at least
general 2020-09-24 04:42:06 Well, it's decent enough to do stuff decently
general 2020-09-24 04:42:31 Running Minecraft with shaders and an HD resource pack, expect 30-40 FPS
general 2020-09-24 04:43:01 16 GB should be the minimum amount to comfortably game or do resource intensive tasks
general 2020-09-24 04:43:02 brb
general 2020-09-24 04:43:27 probably not
general 2020-09-24 04:43:41 No, if no lag
general 2020-09-24 04:44:59 <@!347182144873037824> Oh and I only have 1 GB of VRAM
general 2020-09-24 04:45:14 Radeon HD 6670
general 2020-09-24 04:45:36 Video RAM
general 2020-09-24 04:45:54 RAM for graphical stuff
general 2020-09-24 04:46:17 Once I actually get a job, I should focus on getting better hardware and gaming on a budget
general 2020-09-24 04:46:54 My plans is to take up engineering or something software related
general 2020-09-24 04:47:05 If they're too hard, then accounting/business stuff
general 2020-09-24 04:47:12 I'm talking whiel there's online classes
general 2020-09-24 04:47:41 <@!347182144873037824> My family has a 2nd house
general 2020-09-24 04:48:08 My parents are really hard working judging by that
general 2020-09-24 04:48:19 Or maybe the prices of housing here isn't that high
general 2020-09-24 04:48:55 Sir, are you on a server?
general 2020-09-24 04:49:59 <@!347182144873037824> You could run a lot of virtual machines if you have the processing power
general 2020-09-24 04:51:14 The AMD A-Series at least has some pretty decent integrated graphics
general 2020-09-24 04:52:10 <@!645128367611445248> Integrated graphics are pro
general 2020-09-24 04:52:25 Don't game then
general 2020-09-24 04:53:29 Seriosuly, 32 MB?
general 2020-09-24 04:53:40 That's much worse than the 1 GB I'm stuck with
general 2020-09-24 04:54:03 Stick with DOS
general 2020-09-24 04:54:54 <@!645128367611445248> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Accelerated_Processing_Unit
general 2020-09-24 04:55:03 This has better integrated graphics
general 2020-09-24 04:55:13 Replace it with this
general 2020-09-24 04:55:23 At least on a budget it's decent
general 2020-09-24 04:56:06 "The Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Xbox One eighth generation video game consoles both use semi-custom third generation low-power APUs."

If they use this, then it's probably good enough
general 2020-09-24 04:56:26 On the mid-high end, probably
general 2020-09-24 04:56:36 But on the low-end,expect integrated graphics
general 2020-09-24 04:57:53 AMD's integrated graphics apparently are based on Vega GPUs
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:08:49 It seems there's only one supersonic business jet
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:17:04 Thy
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:17:21 Fax
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:17:29 ~~it really is~~
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:17:49 I'll go wait for a more opportune time to continue to SSBJ
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:18:10 Kinda looks like there's potential for variable sweep wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:19:01 I usually don't do variable sweep wings, they usually compromise afterburner speed due to instability
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:19:25 Like the motor 2s go I wanna die
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:20:01 ~~besides motor locked flaps makes the flaps seamless~~
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:20:35 Reminds me of those armies, but actually bearable
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:21:53 Once I do a redesign of my plane I should add this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiet_Spike
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:22:11 Basically, make nose into lance
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:22:48 Their only point is to reduce sonic booms though
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:23:38 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaped_Sonic_Boom_Demonstration And another program I could look up
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:24:46 So a long nose would be an obvious addition
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:26:05 Probably could also sacrifice wing width in exchange for wing length (parallel to the aircraft)
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:29:06 and of course smooth
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:49:35 You're in Brazil
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 06:54:02 olleH
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 07:22:31 I don't even know how make those wavy flag
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 07:23:36 So wait they're just all ropes?
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 07:23:41 Mounted sideways?
general 2020-09-24 07:26:50 I don't understand this language
general 2020-09-24 07:27:25 There's one thing I wanna say about that
general 2020-09-24 07:27:28 You speak water bender
general 2020-09-24 07:28:02 I prefer water bender, because the Dutch and their dams and other water related stuff
general 2020-09-24 07:29:33 And my software isn't saved
general 2020-09-24 07:29:35 G r e a t
general 2020-09-24 07:30:08 I have to reinstall my portable apps again

general 2020-09-24 07:36:58 bird go knock knock who's there
general 2020-09-24 07:45:42 It's not yet gonna come
general 2020-09-24 07:48:38 Until everyone's happy, no map for you then
general 2020-09-24 07:52:31 Should rick hold a map contest?
general 2020-09-24 07:52:47 If he actually plans on doing one
general 2020-09-24 07:53:08 Oof
general 2020-09-24 07:53:36 Well, should I add another map to the list of maps already out there?
general 2020-09-24 07:54:40 I'll get a paper then
general 2020-09-24 07:54:44 During my spare time

general 2020-09-24 07:55:50 Like instant hit, sure
But instant kill, no
general 2020-09-24 07:59:13 A problem though being that lag could make it so that for you it looks like you hit it
general 2020-09-24 07:59:21 But for your target it's like nothing happened
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 08:00:18 yes
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 08:00:31 <@!387195148741771275> Sudden extend, then either unweld or pull back slowly
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 08:01:27 Can't really find a use for it tbh
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 08:02:14 I wonder if it's possible to make anti body roll suspension
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 08:02:48 I feel like pistons could be used
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 08:03:04 I tried doing it, ended up compressing suspension
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 08:03:17 I mean it could stiffen up the part where it leans towards to
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 08:09:43 <@!387195148741771275> So large wings?
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 08:10:32 So ballasts and helium
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 08:10:45 ~~and pretend propellers are like that one Brabham F1 car~~
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 08:10:54 ~~or the new Gordon Murray supercar~~

plane-crazy 2020-09-24 09:20:40 I did the SSBJ
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 09:20:56 It's lacking in performance tbh, apart from speed
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 09:21:03 So in a way it performs like an interceptor
general 2020-09-24 09:36:12 I have no idea what to build
general 2020-09-24 09:36:56 Something is indeed wrong

general 2020-09-24 09:40:37 <@!448505589983739914> So wait, container has too much water that it exploded?
general 2020-09-24 09:53:10 Puri is empty
general 2020-09-24 09:53:13 He's dead inside
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 12:12:18 I did the nose
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 12:12:24 Doing a redesign
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 12:12:52 Decided to give it a much longer nose so it looks less likely to make sonic booms
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 12:13:10 Emphasis on looks, I'm aware there are no sonic booms in this game (unless you have speakers)
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 12:13:43 Also made the interior to be 5 blocks wide
bot-central 2020-09-24 12:14:05 !servers
general 2020-09-24 12:16:25 Long nose + wing sweep + smooth body = Supersonic Business/Commercial/Passenger jet?
general 2020-09-24 12:16:29 Wait
general 2020-09-24 12:16:30 Lucario
general 2020-09-24 12:16:33 But it's a Protogen
general 2020-09-24 12:17:02 <@!551573378662662145> Still better than the actual thing
general 2020-09-24 12:17:16 Moto-moto should stay as motor-motor
general 2020-09-24 12:17:50 I'm in VIP1 with ThyssenKrupp
general 2020-09-24 12:18:12 Eye contact
general 2020-09-24 12:18:15 Literal eye contact
general 2020-09-24 12:18:19 That's just disgusting
general 2020-09-24 12:18:55 <@!448505589983739914> Give me Dr. Squarepant's Eyewash Formula
general 2020-09-24 12:19:12 <@!551573378662662145> Out of curiosity though, where did you find those hybrids?
general 2020-09-24 12:24:18 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi-Gulfstream_S-21 Well, this is the closest I'll have to an IRL SSBJ
general 2020-09-24 12:24:24 yes it should be an emoji
general 2020-09-24 12:24:56 Invalid texture
general 2020-09-24 12:25:08 Isn't that an industry standard?
general 2020-09-24 12:25:16 Like if there's a missing texture, it goes magenta and black
general 2020-09-24 12:25:33 <@!177743269105500160> The one who takes actual pictures instead of screenshotting?
general 2020-09-24 12:26:31 What emoji would best suit cockpit avionics?
general 2020-09-24 12:36:11 21 jays
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 12:36:29 Just co-exist
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 12:37:12 Jay has found an idiot
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 12:37:23 Apparently conveyor drive = bad
general 2020-09-24 12:38:18 You can swear, but not to the point where it's unneccessary
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 12:39:03 Shredder users think they're Thor
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:36:59 What kind of crap am I seeing in this channel
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:37:39 Well, Arjunn had a session of reading the map related suggestions in <#681209786942881806>
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:37:49 -mapsuggest
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:37:55 O h
bot-central 2020-09-24 23:38:08 Well this is interesting
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:39:28 Still, maintain some bumpiness so suspension wouldn't be useless
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:40:22 Wait team?
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:40:50 Well, how about Rick having a *development team*
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:41:11 That's good
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:41:35 No, because player demands
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:42:33 Keep in mind you also have to consider planes, ships, cars and suspension engineers in this game, and that's not the only vehicles here
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:43:38 I wonder if suspension engineers could test out their vehicles like a rally driver
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:44:48 Wait a second does that thumbnail show a blacklist box in the background
general 2020-09-24 23:52:20 That's some dedication
general 2020-09-24 23:52:38 <@470018120317403137> Do you share servers with him?
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:53:10 Robo go PP
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:53:53 Electromagnetic Prolonged Pulsation
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:53:56 Or EMPP
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:54:32 Put your meats there
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:54:47 Then **e**at 'em fresh from the grill
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:55:29 Eat 'em prolonged pulsation grilled meats, or put 'em on your burgers and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:55:50 Also, that's a lot of control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:56:24 I have a medium sized fighter
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:56:34 Locked motors help
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:56:57 Kinda hard to go past 10k though
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:57:12 F e e t
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:57:45 Feeting away 
I don't know what to say 
But I'll say it anyways
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 23:57:50 That's just gross
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 00:00:33 I'm currently figuring out how to seamlessly fold my SSBJ
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 00:02:38 I usually use motor 2s for roll
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 00:02:51 Usually on a tailless delta wing
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 00:03:26 Supermanuverability?
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 00:07:36 What's the fastest you've went?
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 00:08:03 <@459442244265705504> Wing design
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 00:08:20 For me it's all in how you design your wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 00:09:21 I usually assign the afterburners to T
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 00:11:08 I mean there's VIP servers here
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 00:11:14 And expert servers
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 00:12:01 Z, X and V I usually assign to cockpit and landing gears
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 00:15:20 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 00:15:25 You need a role though
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 00:15:31 A rank I mean
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 00:15:39 <#609442446249820211> <#705941616199991307>
general 2020-09-25 00:20:04 I mean there's already a -mapsuggest command
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 00:20:58 Magnet ones are laggy
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 00:21:33 Conveyors though, helps me reach 16k, though I typically reach 7k-10k
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:30:44 -mapsuggest Add a mixed surface rally style track for those suspension engineers. Off-road should test the effectiveness of suspensions while on-road should test stuff such as their stability against roll-overs (or just stability in general) and sharpness of handling
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:33:18 -mapsuggest Add a larger airport, perhaps more closer to an actual one just for that aesthetic while also adding a section for assisted take-offs
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:35:36 Wait this for maps, not for in game bugs
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:37:29 -mapsuggest For the more mountainous areas, add some somewhat wide natural, bumpy roads for those with rock crawlers. Not something impossible, but still difficult to traverse with non high-travel regular suspension
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:40:06 -mapsuggest Add a port for those with absurdly large ships and carriers. ~~So we can easily have tank carriers xp~~
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:41:22 <@385571953903271936> What did you expect when this suggestion command is open to everyone
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:41:32 No quality control
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:41:45 Because anyone can suggest
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:42:28 Don't make it harder onto the mods already
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:43:59 Yes, that's good
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:44:07 Especially for those with bullet trains
general 2020-09-25 00:44:33 I used mapsuggest
general 2020-09-25 00:51:03 <@218240161719386112> Antivirus is not enough, use Protogent
general 2020-09-25 00:51:38 How many Protogens are in this server
general 2020-09-25 00:52:30 Blame Prototrode

general 2020-09-25 01:34:44 Yes

bot-central 2020-09-25 01:58:15 I think I'll go try sketching my own map
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:59:20 <@690449203385729025> I was thinking off-roaders should have this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tipxvSscEWA
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:59:32 What you're thinking is more suited for rock crawlers
bot-central 2020-09-25 03:11:07 -mapsuggest https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/442834679004135434/758885502899322921/IMG_20200925_105344.jpg 

A quick sketch for a motocross or rally style race track, combined with a drag strip. For on road races, people could use the highway/road system in a sort of street race kind of race (think of Need For Speed)
general 2020-09-25 03:28:02 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384027830192832513/758888289159348274 I did a basic suggestion, because I can't draw maps I instead drew a track
general 2020-09-25 03:28:15 I'm too uncreative for maps xp
general 2020-09-25 03:30:06 Fish would be kinda pointless
general 2020-09-25 03:30:52 Seamines, wouldn't that just be removing work from players in making bombs?
general 2020-09-25 03:31:01 Plus would be more of a turn off to make subs
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 03:31:55 How the hell am I gonna fold this 90 degrees from vertical to horizontal
general 2020-09-25 03:32:38 Still, it'd be kinda like putting landmines on ground
general 2020-09-25 03:33:52 But in that case, hovercraft would be like to boats like how cars are to submarines. Like why make something that could touch mines when you can avoid them in the first place
general 2020-09-25 03:34:18 Actually, I think I'd be fine if the mines aren't gonna be dense
general 2020-09-25 03:34:39 Then in that case I agree with you
general 2020-09-25 03:34:50 Be wary or be caught off guard
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 03:35:45 Stubby aircraft look ugly
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 03:36:11 It's supposed to be an SSBJ
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 03:36:30 I'm trying to use both locked motors and folding
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 03:36:45 Which is why I asked how to fold from this
-| to this --
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 03:37:22 An example of an SSBJ is the Sukhoi-Gulfstream S-21
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 03:37:39 yes but how do I do vertical-to-horizontal folds
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 03:38:25 I only know how to do 180, maybe I should go do that instead
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 03:40:54 yes very helpful
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 03:41:18 *w e d g e*
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 03:42:32 Not really interesting for me tbh, considering they've become tutorial builds
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 03:47:53 I managed to do it
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 03:48:00 As long as I'm fine with a floating motor then this is fine
general 2020-09-25 03:55:34 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/758897540136960000 On a scale of 1-10, how bad is it to have a floating motor?
general 2020-09-25 03:55:56 Well there's nothing I can do about that
general 2020-09-25 03:56:05 Otherwise I can't fold and I'll have a stubby plane
general 2020-09-25 05:14:01 Can we add rank limits to  -mapsuggest
general 2020-09-25 05:14:21 I notice a lot of suggestions that exist, are duplicates or just low quality
general 2020-09-25 05:15:05 Like please for the sake of the map team add it

plane-crazy 2020-09-25 06:58:31 tbh I just kinda gave up and decided to just do stuff on my own
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 07:00:03 It got lost

general 2020-09-25 07:35:46 oh now i see what's wrong
general 2020-09-25 07:41:48 Does anyone watch the cartoon Adventure Time?
Does anyone remember that one episode where Princess Bubblegum got possessed by the Lich?
Does anyone remember that one scene where Jake peeped into a certain keyhole?

I wonder how that would influence the brains of undes
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 07:46:53 I just realized how this would seriously lack in roll
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 07:47:28 On the other hand this ain't a fighter anyways
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 07:51:20 It's still a WIP so I can't say this will be the final look
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 07:54:53 Aight, also here's what I'm working with
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 07:55:40 At least it looks better than this thing
general 2020-09-25 08:01:10 https://streamable.com/zj1hku What you're seeing here is mama bird trying to flap it's wings seconds before disaster
general 2020-09-25 08:01:41 If only I recorded it earlier
general 2020-09-25 08:01:57 To show that it's actually trying to flap it like bird wings
general 2020-09-25 08:02:36 That's a pretty slow fall

general 2020-09-25 08:12:37 Try doing that
general 2020-09-25 08:14:19 You honestly look like these kids that say they're gonna commit it

*I've been there once*
general 2020-09-25 08:14:40 From personal experience, you'll eventually learn how to deal with common problems
general 2020-09-25 08:15:03 I can understand some problems are just too hard to deal with, such as the loss of a loved one
general 2020-09-25 08:15:43 You can push through it
general 2020-09-25 08:15:48 Also, try to find some friends online
general 2020-09-25 08:15:56 Trust me, it'll help you in the long term
general 2020-09-25 08:16:35 Or if you want, try to find ways to tolerate/cope with stress
general 2020-09-25 08:17:00 Heck if you want to roleplay servers exist, if you're *that kind* of person
general 2020-09-25 08:19:49 I've been bullied too, a lot actually
general 2020-09-25 08:20:25 It's tough but with support from friends and trying to push through it, you can deal with it eventually
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 08:21:46 <@!392334096560554001> What about manuverable fighters with supersonic capabilities?
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 08:21:58 Let's say a shredder has touched the plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 08:22:03 And then I turn on the afterburners
general 2020-09-25 08:22:26 I mean who'd name themselves like that
general 2020-09-25 08:22:41 It sounds like it came from pre-2010
general 2020-09-25 08:23:12 <@!758898127049588798>
general 2020-09-25 08:23:24 `thinbluenation911#8950`
general 2020-09-25 08:23:29 Here use this
general 2020-09-25 08:24:11 Type it in alongside the user number
general 2020-09-25 08:24:45 I mean it says "hi I'm new to Discord"
general 2020-09-25 08:25:30 <@!507103930388578304> Let's hope he isn't a bot too
general 2020-09-25 08:25:36 Also there's someone named HOFUNG32
general 2020-09-25 08:26:01 ***f e m a l e   c l o n e***
general 2020-09-25 08:28:26 Hofung, your name in game is woodywood right? (I can't exactly remember)
general 2020-09-25 08:28:54 oof
general 2020-09-25 08:30:12 Are drones good for videos?
general 2020-09-25 08:45:52 <@448505589983739914> To show you the power of humanity, I cut our ~~self-esteem~~ air in half
general 2020-09-25 08:50:34 Those lines
general 2020-09-25 08:50:40 It looks like cat that got shook
general 2020-09-25 08:51:00 That would be pretty neat
general 2020-09-25 08:51:09 ~~especially for the views~~
general 2020-09-25 08:52:31 Yeah we gotta wait for the map team to build it
general 2020-09-25 08:53:40 Planes will get a new airport, ship builders will get a new dock and expanded ocean, land vehicles will probably get better land design
general 2020-09-25 08:54:12 I really wish for suspension engineers to have a mixed surface rallycross style race track
general 2020-09-25 08:54:38 I drew a track
general 2020-09-25 08:56:28 There is a lizard
general 2020-09-25 08:56:32 Near the window
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:04:25 <@387195148741771275> Your suggestion makes me think of Initial D and Gymkhana
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:05:02 I wonder if there's room for rock crawlers though 

On the other hand, suspension in this game has a lot of travel already
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:06:36 My car related suggestion is related more into mixed surface rally and suspension/stabukity tests
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:07:09 Yes stability, phone typo
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:07:33 I mean you can't really drive a car if it keeps rolling over
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:07:40 Or if it has poor turning
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:08:15 I designed a track though it's mostly off road now that I think about it, though I did integrate a potential drag strip
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:08:43 Problem is when there's people on the strip, so I added an alt. route
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:08:53 Mountainous roads would be nice
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:09:23 ~~I remembered playing a game of Forza in its fictional mountain road though~~
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:09:30 ~~I struggled xp~~
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:11:31 Rick would probably have to shrink our ideas though if they're too big
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:12:01 What's the largest map in Roblox anyways?
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:12:33 Project Trackday I remember implemented the Le Mans track
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:12:40 And that thing is large in length
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:15:17 The ocean is large but naval warfare I'd expect to be small in the amount of space it actually consumes
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:16:52 Yeah that sounds nice
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:17:17 Though part of me wonders how we'll end up combining the efforts
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:17:28 Of map maKers
bot-central 2020-09-25 09:17:49 But yes Rick is getting a map team
general 2020-09-25 09:24:22 I use Reddit, but never try to talk there 

Just consume the content you selectively like, and maybe ask some questions there
general 2020-09-25 09:24:36 Mostly because with how much people are on there
general 2020-09-25 09:24:47 Gets me fast answers on r/retroarch
general 2020-09-25 09:26:25 Japan do the big funny
general 2020-09-25 09:26:47 Imagine in real life though having a weaponized robot and what you immediately do is flip off your foes
general 2020-09-25 09:27:36 What's on Japanese Twitter?
general 2020-09-25 09:27:57 Stuff too spicy for international?
general 2020-09-25 09:28:13 Don't they still use Yahoo there?
general 2020-09-25 09:32:02 <@451025784228806656> Racoon?
general 2020-09-25 11:50:20 That's cold
general 2020-09-25 11:50:45 Then get a not off brand AC
general 2020-09-25 11:51:06 Below 20 is unbearable for long periods of time
general 2020-09-25 11:51:13 I set it around 24
general 2020-09-25 11:51:46 Summer in the equator is like an outdoors sauna
general 2020-09-25 11:51:58 The Philippines
general 2020-09-25 11:53:06 Singapore🎤
general 2020-09-25 11:53:28 Imagine living in not South East Asia
bot-central 2020-09-25 11:53:55 This contest is for Puri
bot-central 2020-09-25 11:54:02 And his collection of bottle pics
general 2020-09-25 11:55:26 One of the online stores here advertises big discounts on a regular basis as a promo 

As in around 80% I think, real brands or get twice back
general 2020-09-25 11:56:07 Imagine playing Fallout
general 2020-09-25 11:56:22 Then lubricate the engine
general 2020-09-25 11:56:34 ~~haha steam engine pun is the big punni~~
general 2020-09-25 11:56:50 I just have Steam for the free stuff
general 2020-09-25 11:57:17 Steam should step up their game
general 2020-09-25 11:57:31 Epic be trying to offer free games
general 2020-09-25 11:57:53 I'd probably regret getting an Epic Games store account knowing the games industry
general 2020-09-25 11:58:20 Plus they aren't what I know for quality 

*cough* Fortnite, Duke Nukem Forever *cough*
general 2020-09-25 11:58:41 <@456226577798135808> The wheels on the car go broke and broke
general 2020-09-25 11:59:22 Politics chat = bad
general 2020-09-25 11:59:30 The nose?
general 2020-09-25 11:59:58 Also, that's either a big van or a tiny tank
general 2020-09-25 12:02:13 Jet engine plane but tiltrotor
general 2020-09-25 12:02:50 You need to boost your chair
general 2020-09-25 12:03:30 And beat Squidward
general 2020-09-25 12:03:51 Squidward's chair is OP
general 2020-09-25 12:03:58 Battle him for chair
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 12:06:46 That's why it's called imposter
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 12:07:09 A real impostor wouldn't call themselves impostor
general 2020-09-25 12:07:46 squidward will use his tentacles to c h o k e
general 2020-09-25 12:08:11 <@432344306427101184> I was about to say either its old or your ass was too fat
general 2020-09-25 12:08:17 But no it's just crap
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 12:09:00 You post pics of Tim?
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 12:09:02 Ew
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 12:10:24 You know what's the most annoying of non PvP baconery?

The glitch through blacklists ones
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 12:10:48 Like "pls ride"

Like no I'm not gonna spawn my incomplete build for a brainless peasant
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 12:11:25 Oof, well I respect for your good timing
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 12:12:09 <@403843930543882241> You know that duck-rabbit illusion?

Imposter or cactus?
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 12:12:35 <@387195148741771275> Make them ride by standing on your build, then drive off the void
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 12:13:25 I wonder how people can stand on builds even when going super sonic 

Like do they have magnets for feet
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 12:13:49 <@387195148741771275> Why do kids bother you so much when you're busy?
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 12:14:09 Yeah, let's compare them to kids who do that
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 12:14:27 Imagine standing on a plane going super sonic tho
general 2020-09-25 12:16:04 Pig pug pog
general 2020-09-25 12:16:55 puggo doggo poggo
general 2020-09-25 12:17:11 I thought dogs were lighter
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 12:17:42 How do I make not plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 12:17:44 Like bote
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 12:17:47 And kar
general 2020-09-25 12:18:20 I just noticed Minty has a cracked screen
general 2020-09-25 12:19:04 <@432344306427101184> Must be really satisfied to let it all out then
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 12:19:52 I always use wedges for curves
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 12:20:18 3x3 fabric cylinders for wheels or 5x5 fabric wedge wheels
general 2020-09-25 12:21:09 Do ducks really have teeth on their tongues?
general 2020-09-25 12:21:30 O h N o
general 2020-09-25 12:21:45 Hold birb like a banana
general 2020-09-25 12:22:06 Pinguin be chonk and teethy
general 2020-09-25 12:22:45 I remember when I had a birb 

It was in a cage 

It climbed it just to change my finger
general 2020-09-25 12:22:50 Chase*
general 2020-09-25 12:23:04 Puri
general 2020-09-25 12:23:08 Is this contest
general 2020-09-25 12:23:12 Just to add more pics
general 2020-09-25 12:23:18 To your water bottle collection
general 2020-09-25 12:23:57 <@712358550097231934> ***He's Perry, Perry the b i r b***
general 2020-09-25 12:24:16 Cockatiels are just grey haired Pikachu birds
general 2020-09-25 12:24:53 <@448505589983739914> Did they call them Concorde and Tupolev Tu-144?
general 2020-09-25 12:25:23 Missed opportunity to nickname one of them Concorde
general 2020-09-25 12:25:39 <@432344306427101184> **Its Pikachu**
general 2020-09-25 12:25:46 Just make birb blush
general 2020-09-25 12:25:54 Y e s
general 2020-09-25 12:26:04 ***hold birb like a banana***
general 2020-09-25 12:26:11 Pure fluff
general 2020-09-25 12:26:20 Wabbit*
general 2020-09-25 12:26:35 Ah yes a firebird
general 2020-09-25 12:26:41 Get a Pontiac Firebird
general 2020-09-25 12:27:10 <@456226577798135808> I can't tell if that pink bun has eyes or its closed
general 2020-09-25 12:27:20 Monke Wabbit
general 2020-09-25 12:27:36 <@177743269105500160> That's real, and chat was surprisingly calm
general 2020-09-25 12:27:56 The best pet is obviously a Raptor 

An F-22 Raptor that is
general 2020-09-25 12:28:08 Do it
general 2020-09-25 12:28:16 Obc needs dog rabbot
general 2020-09-25 15:02:05 What just happened
general 2020-09-25 15:02:22 That face ngl is unsettling
general 2020-09-25 15:03:04 Can someone explain what's happening?
general 2020-09-25 15:05:03 What is that Courier?
general 2020-09-25 15:05:17 I kinda recognize the Courier font
general 2020-09-25 15:05:38 <@456226577798135808> gross, copycat
general 2020-09-25 15:06:09 If only I had bobux
general 2020-09-25 15:06:38 This chat is wild
general 2020-09-25 15:07:14 <@260797229068058634> Looks like you'll have to trace down the problem then
general 2020-09-25 15:07:42 Maybe it's the connector/port, maybe it's the card 

I dunno, I'm just some dumbass
general 2020-09-25 15:08:10 <@435864400235200522> He said it's the PC
general 2020-09-25 15:08:41 Windows 

More like unneccessary features
general 2020-09-25 15:09:02 Seriously why is Microsoft trying to be a do it all
general 2020-09-25 15:11:12 <@347182144873037824> We both know they want money, but is anyone really gonna go make Windows the next iPad?
general 2020-09-25 15:11:45 Then stay out of mobile space
general 2020-09-25 15:12:45 Windows isn't gonna run fine on a mobile device 

It's too fat, it's not like Android which can somewhat run on 1 GB of memory
general 2020-09-25 15:13:00 And has low storage requirements
general 2020-09-25 15:13:21 And its UI can never be the iOS
general 2020-09-25 15:13:50 3.2 GHz?
general 2020-09-25 15:14:41 I mean I'd be more concerned about what kind of RAM (DDR#) and the amount of RAM I have
general 2020-09-25 15:16:19 <@260797229068058634> You know building computers 

Doesn't DDR in RAM influence write times and other speed related stuff?
general 2020-09-25 15:16:53 Yes
general 2020-09-25 15:17:30 I have 8 GB, which is decent for normies
general 2020-09-25 15:17:58 4 GB is mid end on mobile but low end on computers
general 2020-09-25 15:18:19 16 GB is good enough for most people
general 2020-09-25 15:18:54 <@347182144873037824> meanwhile has 256 GB of RAM 

Like that's server amounts of RAM
general 2020-09-25 15:19:42 Anymore and he might need Windows Server Edition (yes that's a thing)
general 2020-09-25 15:20:48 <@456226577798135808> Squidward Tentacles would like to know your location 

He's an artist, after all
general 2020-09-25 15:20:59 No
general 2020-09-25 15:21:31 I have normie
general 2020-09-25 15:22:36 AMD A8-7600 (A-series known for having some competent integrated graphics)
AMD Radeon HD6670 
8 GB of RAM
general 2020-09-25 15:22:56 Still, that's normie
general 2020-09-25 15:24:17 <@347182144873037824> You already have 256 GB of RAM, what are you gonna do with 2 TB 

Run a server? Claim a whole Plane Crazy server with virtual machines and alt accounts?
general 2020-09-25 15:26:03 Honestly with that amount of RAM, you could multitask two sessions of Windows without worries 

Though you do must have the CPU and GPU for that
general 2020-09-25 15:26:26 WiFi please, I'll install Linux
general 2020-09-25 15:27:25 <@347182144873037824> Honestly I can deal with 4 GB if I'm not running Windows, its FAT
general 2020-09-25 15:28:07 How punny of me to forget Windows' default file system literally is named FAT32/exFAT
general 2020-09-25 15:29:08 Here's a fun fact 

Renault (or maybe it was Citroen) has an engine named the F4RT
general 2020-09-25 15:29:22 Must be emitting a lot of carbon then
general 2020-09-25 15:29:34 Hot gassy carbon
general 2020-09-25 15:29:38 Silent but deadly
general 2020-09-25 15:29:46 F4RT engine
general 2020-09-25 15:30:10 Yes I definitely meant that
general 2020-09-25 15:30:18 When the map makers get around to it
general 2020-09-25 15:30:50 The engine pollutes us with Methane
general 2020-09-25 15:31:05 Where's Ketchup gas?
general 2020-09-25 15:31:11 Or hot sauce gas?
general 2020-09-25 15:31:33 Hot sauce gas would probably be one hella painful time
general 2020-09-25 15:31:46 Lots of eye pain and lung irritation
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 23:56:35 I see the chat is being the chat
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 23:56:53 Wait this isn't <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 23:57:08 General is wilder
general 2020-09-26 00:06:23 This image confuses me
general 2020-09-26 00:06:43 At least you have **69**9 blocks 

Nice.
general 2020-09-26 00:07:48 Try reaching 404 or 420
general 2020-09-26 00:09:31 Ah yes, the classic love it or hate it battle royale 

Fotniet!
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:19:02 <@437152336176087052> I mean I sometimes go to VIP1, and I'm a furry just without the avatar
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:20:02 We all know how undes are
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:20:14 Mostly crap
general 2020-09-26 00:21:16 Somebody once told me to ||never gonna give you up||
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:26:15 Cul da mänägaer
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:26:42 Saxophone
general 2020-09-26 00:27:23 The amount of dedication to do that is incredible
general 2020-09-26 00:27:28 Unless he does the hacker
general 2020-09-26 00:28:16 If blocks normally have a limit of 2000...

Do 50x40x50
general 2020-09-26 00:28:27 I forgot what was the height limit
general 2020-09-26 00:30:10 He cannot ban in game
general 2020-09-26 00:30:15 But he can in here
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:30:59 "I'm doing your mom right now, sorry"
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:31:11 That should trigger undes
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:31:39 Undes both hate and love your mom jokes
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:32:08 Kinda like bullying, loves to be on top but hates it when being the victim
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:32:44 Wedgy
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:33:11 Nobody does VC to strangers on Discord
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:33:25 Only friends do, or at least a comfortable enough community
general 2020-09-26 00:34:56 <@456226577798135808> That one oddly looks like a reproductive thing but green
general 2020-09-26 00:35:06 Why are shredders cursed to look like that
general 2020-09-26 00:36:09 Share being fertilized
general 2020-09-26 00:41:39 I remember making a bee army
general 2020-09-26 00:41:50 It was a buggy lagfest
general 2020-09-26 00:42:01 If I filled a plot with them I'd die
general 2020-09-26 00:42:32 Still fun to have Lenny bees buzzing around
general 2020-09-26 00:46:45 I don't understand
general 2020-09-26 00:47:10 Why the vipEmpire tambien?
general 2020-09-26 00:47:56 So someone named stripi, neta and vip are hackers?
general 2020-09-26 00:48:06 He must really be one big bacon
general 2020-09-26 00:48:51 Oh well, we can't be all intelligent
general 2020-09-26 00:49:15 Gotta balance out the gene pool somehow
general 2020-09-26 00:52:46 <@163143541160148992> Leave before they enter the "terrorize" phase
general 2020-09-26 00:53:01 Which is when they verbally annoy you or go "DIE DIE DIE"
general 2020-09-26 00:57:09 I wonder how magma when summer event is done drains out
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:57:58 Part of me thinks it wants to kill me
general 2020-09-26 00:58:35 Is that 'rick with a mask?
general 2020-09-26 01:01:19 <@456226577798135808> Explain? Also what does invert do
general 2020-09-26 01:02:21 I'm already familiar with the motor 2 wanting to wiggle it's lego butt
general 2020-09-26 01:02:35 But motor 2 going the opposite, I haven't seen that before
general 2020-09-26 01:03:02 Don't do bees shake their rear to communicate?
general 2020-09-26 01:03:20 So aren't they just glorified motor 2s?
creations-chat 2020-09-26 01:04:08 Telljefixje
general 2020-09-26 01:42:58 Nobody asked, nor does anyone wanna hear about how the beliefs of others are crap compared to yours
general 2020-09-26 01:43:50 Building a plane with an cone inlet
general 2020-09-26 01:44:50 > were not talking about planes
okay poob
general 2020-09-26 01:45:14 I just answered battleship
general 2020-09-26 01:47:44 I just take advantage of how we have a pre-defined schedule for passing stuff
general 2020-09-26 01:47:58 So for this subject, pass X every friday
general 2020-09-26 01:48:08 This subject, end of each quarter, etc. etc.
general 2020-09-26 01:49:33 Sounds like they made school a game
general 2020-09-26 01:55:02 I thought it was trying to suck your finger thinking it's food
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 01:55:40 2nd gen fighter looks weird, probably either because of colors or still incomplete
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 01:56:09 Very typical
general 2020-09-26 02:09:39 
general 2020-09-26 02:09:41 
general 2020-09-26 02:09:43 I wish I could build this good at this scale
general 2020-09-26 02:10:24 I could be a dic and blacklist tbh
general 2020-09-26 02:11:22 I don't
general 2020-09-26 02:11:37 I deleted the jumbo jet long ago
general 2020-09-26 02:11:43 It was ugly anyways
general 2020-09-26 02:14:27 It actually flies
general 2020-09-26 02:14:39 With retractable landing gear
general 2020-09-26 02:15:05 It be using a lot of engines though
general 2020-09-26 02:15:29 Yes, I prefer conveyor
general 2020-09-26 02:15:45 But I still add rocket engines under the assumption they help with stability
general 2020-09-26 02:16:10 It's not flying too fast so it's safe to stand on it
general 2020-09-26 02:19:55 <@!163143541160148992> Did you just join me?
general 2020-09-26 02:34:47 back, ate empanadas
general 2020-09-26 02:35:37 The ones that were bought were decent
general 2020-09-26 02:35:41 I've had better
general 2020-09-26 02:36:00 I've had one where I can actually taste the chicken
general 2020-09-26 02:37:02 I saw a zeppelin with the no-no symbol
general 2020-09-26 02:38:24 A "tornado", a tutorial bomber and the no-no zeppelin is hidden on the left
general 2020-09-26 02:39:38 She keeps coiling around your business?
general 2020-09-26 02:41:01 Honestly that would be worth it to get Nitro
general 2020-09-26 02:41:06 Just imagine randomly using that
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 02:42:49 ***e g g***
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 02:44:35 Aight I'm gonna leave and go back to general
general 2020-09-26 02:45:26 So flies just exist and be a little annoying?
general 2020-09-26 02:45:42 ew
general 2020-09-26 02:45:58 Mosquitos do that and be an infectious bloodsucker
general 2020-09-26 02:47:35 <@456226577798135808> The difference is, mosquitos don't seduce
general 2020-09-26 02:47:36 They disgust
general 2020-09-26 02:47:42 And they go squish
general 2020-09-26 02:48:12 <@!587459840255983616> Something tells me you're gonna go on a private browsing session
general 2020-09-26 02:48:29 <@!163143541160148992> Mmm, roast diseases
general 2020-09-26 02:48:49 So chicken?
general 2020-09-26 02:48:59 I mean cock is just another way of saying chicken/rooster
general 2020-09-26 02:53:12 that's a tiny cock
general 2020-09-26 02:54:18 I don't get how my dad says Beat Up simulator is violent when he literally lets my brother play GTA 4
general 2020-09-26 02:56:31 Honestly it's not that bad
general 2020-09-26 02:56:41 I go pew pew and vroom vroom
general 2020-09-26 02:56:56 Food here still stayed the same
general 2020-09-26 02:57:21 Probably because of how many people are seeking alternative income now that stuff like transportation has limits
general 2020-09-26 02:59:00 <@!671156550546751550> Well, social distancing

Also, the people here rely on public transport, and public transport here is provided either by companies or individuals
general 2020-09-26 02:59:29 Imagine the individuals doing public transport though
general 2020-09-26 02:59:46 So people who do that probably are seeking alternative income
general 2020-09-26 02:59:58 Such as with food, or online selling
general 2020-09-26 03:00:44 Everything feels light and weird
general 2020-09-26 03:00:58 And this TV feels small now
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:01:35 not big enough, isn't it?
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:02:01 A second generation jet fighter
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:02:33 yes
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:04:42 EQ over here is the name of a diaper brand

general 2020-09-26 03:08:36 Guess what somebody once told me?
general 2020-09-26 03:09:21 Somebody once told me to
general 2020-09-26 03:09:24 Never gonna give you up
general 2020-09-26 03:11:04 If tacoes actually rained from the sky though, then I'd stay inside because I don't wanna get dirty
general 2020-09-26 03:11:25 Put it in a container at least
general 2020-09-26 03:11:36 Then I'd eat it
general 2020-09-26 03:11:52 Because at least it's clean due to protection, and won't get me dirty
general 2020-09-26 03:12:17 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2020-09-26 03:12:42 One of my friends is playing Adopt Me

please tell me it's just an experiment

general 2020-09-26 03:13:08 you know the rules
general 2020-09-26 03:13:10 and so do I
general 2020-09-26 03:13:55 <@456226577798135808> I'm surprised how fast you deleted it though
general 2020-09-26 03:14:36 If I had spare robux, I'd use it to be my namesake
general 2020-09-26 03:14:40 And change my avatar
general 2020-09-26 03:15:29 Literally the only thing I'd spend robux on if I were given it for free is a few gamepasses and of course to be a reptile
general 2020-09-26 03:15:47 "Virtual agent"
general 2020-09-26 03:16:21 Anyone know any good group funds?
general 2020-09-26 03:17:53 <@456226577798135808> It's actually possible to steal robux from group funds?
general 2020-09-26 03:19:42 "i dont have friends"

plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:36:17 ~~probably because I have no tastes in tanks~~
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:36:25 Cybertank <@!435946988559925248>
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:36:28 Strong but polarizing
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:36:51 Add suspension
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:37:03 Because they do improve off-road capabilities
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:37:26 There is a point though where the raised suspension becomes a liability, making it prone to roll-overs
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:38:37 I don't even tank
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:38:38 I aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:38:51 I usually do aerospace

plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:44:15 Probably won't bring any performance boosts with the variable sweep wing

general 2020-09-26 05:07:30 <#495286269459300364> Is this what a normal day in public servers is like in PC?
general 2020-09-26 05:09:14 Still can ping him
general 2020-09-26 05:09:41 Honestly I don't get about his rant with bigcrazyjohn
general 2020-09-26 05:11:23 Knowing how people think of you, I'd believe them saying it's not false
general 2020-09-26 05:12:02 Wait didn't you say something about being unde yourself one time?
general 2020-09-26 05:13:23 Would a tiny Tactiphy be called a ThumbTac?
general 2020-09-26 05:14:21 I can't pay for software, so I got Shotcut (and its portable)
general 2020-09-26 05:14:50 Openshot is also portable, since I really only store my apps on a USB drive
general 2020-09-26 05:15:06 Due to my dad not wanting to upgrade the storage on the computer
general 2020-09-26 05:15:36 A month is long for me
general 2020-09-26 05:16:04 I've played this game for about a month, others played this for a few years
general 2020-09-26 05:16:09 4 hours is nothing
general 2020-09-26 05:16:41 Adob||e|| meal
general 2020-09-26 05:16:58 Adobo is an actual food
general 2020-09-26 05:17:47 Good wing design + Weight balancing + Lots of engine power = Plane fly
general 2020-09-26 05:18:13 That's the basic formula to making a plane fly
general 2020-09-26 05:19:13 Lots of weight + Lots of speed = Ram/flinging power
general 2020-09-26 05:20:17 Custom flaps and ailerons will help, they perform better than the default control surfaces
general 2020-09-26 05:20:25 Also, use super rocket engines
general 2020-09-26 05:20:48 Only use other engines for decorational purposes
general 2020-09-26 05:21:04 Also, locked motors
general 2020-09-26 05:21:15 <@710140531451232286> Who doesn't?
general 2020-09-26 05:21:28 Also use wedges
general 2020-09-26 05:21:36 Lots of wedges if you want it to look good
general 2020-09-26 05:23:04 <@672751503592914944> First of all, it needs engine power. Use something like super rocket engines 

Use custom flaps. They're basically wing panels connected via motor 2s 

Make sure your wing design is good, you don't wanna cram them in one place or you'll end up struggling to fly it
general 2020-09-26 05:24:00 Make a building but it's color palettes
general 2020-09-26 05:25:17 <@672751503592914944> If it can't fly, even if it looks like it has enough engines, have you considered placing wings in front?
general 2020-09-26 05:25:38 <@456226577798135808> Looks like those TV test cards but it's corrupted
general 2020-09-26 05:25:56 I just wait
general 2020-09-26 05:26:44 Honestly I might make a building if I have nothing else to do
general 2020-09-26 05:26:57 Speaking of which, gonna go back to PC
general 2020-09-26 05:50:27 That kind of build just makes me cringe
general 2020-09-26 05:50:46 > <@!289930922655088640> i havnt been using wings
Did I seriously just hear Perez00 say that?
general 2020-09-26 05:51:51 Epic bot
general 2020-09-26 05:52:11 <@!672751503592914944> Did you not follow the tutorial and decided to remove wings, one of the things that makes a plane fly?
general 2020-09-26 05:52:23 Removing it would be like removing the tires on a car
general 2020-09-26 05:54:16 I'll go back to just figuring out how to motor lock this thing
general 2020-09-26 05:56:07 yes
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 05:57:24 Time to get creative, because I sure as heck don't know how I'll end up motor locking two stacked engines
general 2020-09-26 06:01:24 lizard is back on the window again
general 2020-09-26 06:01:35 It's been Day 2
general 2020-09-26 06:10:39 <@!671156550546751550> lizerd is gone

I dunno why lizard likes to check on me every now and then
general 2020-09-26 06:42:56 Points for originality, but I don't know what I'm looking at tbh
general 2020-09-26 06:43:18 It has evolved
general 2020-09-26 06:45:24 I don't even know
general 2020-09-26 06:45:37 It's a hovercraft, judging by the way it travels
general 2020-09-26 06:46:43 If it's trying to be a blended wing, well it failed miserably
general 2020-09-26 06:47:08 Stripe design is an eyesore
general 2020-09-26 06:47:28 And it's pretty easy for a bomber to hit due to how slow and wide it is
general 2020-09-26 06:48:07 I think it's an attempt at VTOL
general 2020-09-26 06:50:19 It's pretty roomy in here, might open up potential for easy carpet bombing
general 2020-09-26 06:50:49 But of course knowing me, I usually don't consider PvP xp
general 2020-09-26 06:50:58 wait a heckin minute

general 2020-09-26 07:22:31 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Canada_CF-105_Arrow this thing has no rudders
general 2020-09-26 07:22:42 Or anything else other than it's main wings
general 2020-09-26 07:22:46 I wonder how stable it was in flight
general 2020-09-26 07:24:56 Never do the loli
general 2020-09-26 07:25:22 Just don't, keep the child-like person innocent
general 2020-09-26 08:26:22 Apart from group funds, is there any other way to earn robux without spending any money?
general 2020-09-26 08:27:36 Well, better learn Lua then
general 2020-09-26 08:28:05 Or make dirt cheap T-Shirts
general 2020-09-26 08:28:40 Just produce tons from images
general 2020-09-26 08:28:46 And hope you get m o n e y
general 2020-09-26 08:29:00 Blue, red or trendy
general 2020-09-26 09:17:43 If I were to make a game on Roblox, then maybe I should take some pages from EA and mobile game devs, but not the entire book
general 2020-09-26 09:17:57 So I can extract bobux from unsuspecting undes
general 2020-09-26 09:18:46 Also maybe I should try making a Mario Party/Warioware kind of game or a game with arcade like gsmeplay
general 2020-09-26 09:19:06 Yeah that too
general 2020-09-26 09:19:17 But not tycoons, undes probably are tired of that
general 2020-09-26 09:19:24 I'm assuming also clickers
general 2020-09-26 09:19:52 Those two genres have been abused the heck out of them
general 2020-09-26 09:20:17 On makes it shiny
general 2020-09-26 09:20:47 <@409676438682206218> Try some natural scenery, maybe tinted glass
general 2020-09-26 09:21:03 And other sceneries that isn't just box
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 09:22:24 Puri you already have enough bottle pics
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 09:22:33 For your vast and endless bottle collection
general 2020-09-26 09:22:57 The first version ngl looks nicer
general 2020-09-26 09:23:23 The one with brighter room colors
general 2020-09-26 09:23:40 Yes
general 2020-09-26 09:24:38 Just thinking the dark room looked a little dull
general 2020-09-26 09:25:34 Why giant rickje-chan?
general 2020-09-26 09:25:53 You know the Deviants like their giant girls
general 2020-09-26 09:27:42 O h
general 2020-09-26 09:27:49 I didn't even thought about that
general 2020-09-26 09:28:14 I'm thinking too hard
general 2020-09-26 09:28:20 I should just appreciate it
general 2020-09-26 09:28:52 Oh that's neat
general 2020-09-26 09:29:23 Wasn't there an image enhancing tool called Waifu2x? Or was I mis remembering things
general 2020-09-26 09:29:50 How bad is your computer?
general 2020-09-26 09:30:02 O h
general 2020-09-26 09:30:13 <@456226577798135808> Ask 0balance for help
general 2020-09-26 09:30:51 0balance is the 256 GB RAM guy
general 2020-09-26 09:31:06 Probably way more than enough for Waifu2X
general 2020-09-26 09:32:24 Probably isn't youngpeople<name of social media>
general 2020-09-26 09:34:44 .jpeg is best suited for photography, if I remember it stands for Joint Photographs Expert Group
general 2020-09-26 09:37:29 Meanwhile .png and .svg is suited for stuff like drawings 

The difference is that .png uses raster graphics, where it uses pixels (as well as using a slightly different compression method)

.svg uses vector graphics, where instead of using pixels, it instead stores data for where lines, colors and other data is supposed to go in an image. This ensures crisp and clear graphics no matter the scaling
general 2020-09-26 09:38:04 Oh neat a blue Renault 5 Turbo
general 2020-09-26 09:38:36 The difference between .png and .svg is like the difference between .mp3 and .flac
general 2020-09-26 09:38:53 <@409676438682206218> What if you cleared your cookies everytime you run out?
general 2020-09-26 09:39:45 <@409676438682206218> Put it in a zip file
general 2020-09-26 09:40:16 Because undes are at home
general 2020-09-26 09:40:21 They have nothing else to do
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 09:41:46 Ah
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 09:41:51 American Concorde
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 09:42:23 I should try making my own blended body aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 09:43:32 <@351809528209080324> Yeah but it was highly expensive to run, wasn't exactly the most environmentally friendly plane and its sonic booms were an issue with just about anyone
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 09:44:29 If I remember, wasn't Aerospatiale a part of Airbus? Not sure about BAC 

That probably means they still have some data about the Concorde
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 09:44:47 Very expensive with low returns
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 09:45:19 There are supersonic projects
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 09:46:22 The Sukhoi-Gulfstream S-21 got cancelled, probably not worth the costs for the companies involved 

Not sure about the Spike SST and the Overture Boom
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 09:46:59 NASA did some experiments with sonic booms, the Quiet Spike for example 

But they were tested on fighter bodies
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 09:47:23 <@723419054114865202> DC-10? Isn't that a flying death trap in its early days?
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 09:47:56 At least it wasn't the de Haviland Comet
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 09:48:05 Literally disintegrates
general 2020-09-26 09:48:58 I know a way to activate Windows
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 09:49:24 Pretty neat though to hide the engines within the wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 09:50:22 Though wouldn't work with turbofans
general 2020-09-26 09:51:10 Is RoBeats just Beat Saber or whatever that VR game is
general 2020-09-26 09:51:49 There is a game like that on Robloz though
general 2020-09-26 09:52:03 U h h
general 2020-09-26 09:52:15 RetroArch if you're into retro gaming
general 2020-09-26 09:52:21 Yeah probably that
general 2020-09-26 09:53:10 <@392334096560554001> Now that's what I was finding
general 2020-09-26 09:53:24 I thought Sound Space just makes you look at it
general 2020-09-26 09:53:42 Nope
general 2020-09-26 09:54:09 At best a wannabe Jack of All Trades, and definitely a master of none
general 2020-09-26 09:54:15 At worst, schiesse
general 2020-09-26 09:55:34 Herisson added googly eyes on tonks <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 09:56:29 So it sniffed puri?
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 09:56:53 He sniffed the crushed bits of plastic
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 09:56:58 Crushed into dust
general 2020-09-26 09:57:51 Gay line spam is Fruit Ninja
general 2020-09-26 09:58:48 /tts I wonder if it still works
general 2020-09-26 09:58:57 Good
general 2020-09-26 09:59:25 (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
general 2020-09-26 09:59:35 I can still do this though
general 2020-09-26 10:00:09 As you can see I'm bored
general 2020-09-26 22:58:58 Ah, classic chat
general 2020-09-26 22:59:51 The chat has a case of smooth brain
general 2020-09-26 23:01:14 There's a difference between satire and actual offensive content
general 2020-09-26 23:01:27 Know the difference,, uncultured unde swine
general 2020-09-26 23:02:55 Dumbass did I just read "trick you guys"
general 2020-09-26 23:03:04 Sir,  stop making excuses
general 2020-09-26 23:04:32 You literally showed yourself your level of stupidity
general 2020-09-26 23:04:55 Nevada pls delet
general 2020-09-26 23:05:03 Oh thank
general 2020-09-26 23:05:33 Why is it white?
general 2020-09-26 23:05:59 Pingkle Rickle
general 2020-09-26 23:08:33 You know I would've been fine with this if it weren't so blurry
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 01:55:20 Can I call it MAO?
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 01:55:24 Out of laziness
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 03:25:19 I mean control spam could work if hidden
general 2020-09-27 03:28:07 T h y
general 2020-09-27 03:28:10 Smooth
general 2020-09-27 03:29:46 15-16 you can get h a i r
general 2020-09-27 03:41:25 Very straight
general 2020-09-27 03:41:47 Japan, Germany and Italy
general 2020-09-27 03:42:20 Does Italy have a big navy in WW2?
general 2020-09-27 06:28:39 Like it has a mechanical snake tongue
general 2020-09-28 00:19:15 Apparently people are so dumb that they think Among Us has a political message
general 2020-09-28 00:19:36 It cringes me to see that one tweet calls people who play it as sheep
general 2020-09-28 00:21:14 Like it's a murder mystery kind of game, don't take it as a way to demotivate being different and whatever crap they said
general 2020-09-28 00:22:29 I can always grab that one tweet
general 2020-09-28 00:22:34 If you want
general 2020-09-28 00:22:50 It even fooled parents, literally making them sheep
general 2020-09-28 00:23:25 I dunno, didn't scroll through their tweets
general 2020-09-28 00:23:49 I think the person's @ is UnbiasedKatie
general 2020-09-28 00:34:43 The whole account is a joke
plane-crazy 2020-09-28 00:41:08 The over built plane but someone actually gives respect
plane-crazy 2020-09-28 00:41:35 First time I see one not getting butchered
general 2020-09-28 00:50:09 <@163143541160148992> I don't get people 

I only get constant confusion and pissed off
general 2020-09-28 00:50:33 People are confusing xd
general 2020-09-28 00:51:01 <@456226577798135808> Go ahead
general 2020-09-28 00:52:45 At this point I'll just stay out of these stuff
general 2020-09-28 00:52:54 Or at least try xd
general 2020-09-28 01:35:09 What if
general 2020-09-28 01:35:26 Unranked poggers couldn't vote
plane-crazy 2020-09-28 01:36:43 wide hips with a flat ass
general 2020-09-28 01:37:55 Are there helicopters with two tail rotors?
general 2020-09-28 01:39:43 We're waiting on that with -mapsuggest
general 2020-09-28 01:40:47 There's probably already some people who suggested the gentle curves
general 2020-09-28 01:45:20 Are the engines in this game underpowered?
creations-chat 2020-09-28 01:46:31 That's an interesting suspension
creations-chat 2020-09-28 01:48:06 Looking at the suspension, it looks a bit like a dependent suspension
creations-chat 2020-09-28 01:48:39 Shit
creations-chat 2020-09-28 01:51:52 Honestly this is like bolting springs onto a solid axle
creations-chat 2020-09-28 01:52:42 Now I see it, looks like a solid axle with coil springs
creations-chat 2020-09-28 01:53:10 I dunno, I just wanna build my vehicles
creations-chat 2020-09-28 01:54:39 I make aircraft 

I don't make suspension that much so I don't even know advanced crap
creations-chat 2020-09-28 01:56:06 The best kind of suspension is ~~hydropneumatic~~ double wishbone suspension
creations-chat 2020-09-28 01:56:42 Yes
creations-chat 2020-09-28 01:56:59 Feel the road (tm)
general 2020-09-28 02:05:32 I mean the map is pretty old
general 2020-09-28 02:05:46 I think Rick would rather redesign than expand it anyways
general 2020-09-28 02:06:08 Better to redesign than to expand an old map
general 2020-09-28 02:07:02 I drew a track, suggested some stuff missing from the map and other sfuff
general 2020-09-28 02:07:26 Kinda liked someone's idea of mud for off roading
general 2020-09-28 02:08:02 <@456226577798135808> I never said anything about expanding a map
general 2020-09-28 02:08:12 I said ***redesign***
general 2020-09-28 02:08:25 Rick Astley
general 2020-09-28 02:08:41 I said it's better to redesign than to expand
general 2020-09-28 02:08:55 How did you miss that?
general 2020-09-28 02:09:04 I never agreed to expanding the map
general 2020-09-28 02:09:12 I agreed to redesign it
general 2020-09-28 02:09:51 So what's with saying you agree with me then changing it to something I never agreed with?
general 2020-09-28 02:11:14 Besides a redesign is less lazy of a solution and the devs can optimize the new map
general 2020-09-28 02:12:56 Remember, Plane Crazy has to render everyone's builds
general 2020-09-28 02:13:14 Which is a lot to render consider how big everyone's build is
general 2020-09-28 02:13:43 Not only that but the builds are also resource heavy
general 2020-09-28 02:14:15 Lots of particles to render, the amount of processing power to process the complicated stuff they have, stuff like that
general 2020-09-28 02:15:03 Make the map only be big as it needs to be
general 2020-09-28 02:16:40 The underwater of Jailbreak is non-existent, the terrain is more urban and less complicated for Roblox and the devs did optimization
general 2020-09-28 02:17:25 Plane Crazy meanwhile is a lot more complicated
general 2020-09-28 02:17:49 Do you really think you'd run a game with complex terrain with complex builds would run smoothly
general 2020-09-28 02:18:25 Still, those scripts are concrete
general 2020-09-28 02:18:33 They won't really have to change much
general 2020-09-28 02:19:12 Meanwhile Plane Crazy I'd expect to have large, constantly changing scripts
general 2020-09-28 02:19:30 Because of course large, complex builds
general 2020-09-28 02:20:00 Also, Plane Crazy has one dev, those games probably have an actual team
general 2020-09-28 02:20:19 That team could make the code run faster and better
general 2020-09-28 02:20:50 Tiredje
general 2020-09-28 02:21:48 Mad just does some stuff, maybe helped out at the start
general 2020-09-28 02:22:02 After that, poof
general 2020-09-28 02:22:31 Rick has been suggested multiple times to get a dev team
general 2020-09-28 02:22:40 But who to trust?
general 2020-09-28 02:22:50 Anyways, brb

The only structure that decently works is to reinforce the thiccest common tower you can find
general 2020-09-28 04:36:56 Anything else just gets destroyed too quickly (apart from maybe walls)
general 2020-09-28 04:37:41 Second day on the game
general 2020-09-28 04:37:53 Yes, the thiccest of towers deserve the thiccest of w||f||alls
general 2020-09-28 04:38:48 It works well enough that I can go take a quick bathroom break while it happens
general 2020-09-28 04:55:17 Delete old map
general 2020-09-28 04:55:20 Then replace with new map

general 2020-09-28 05:08:00 Propeller blades go spin and make helicopter go vertical
general 2020-09-28 05:08:06 But it also makes it go spin
general 2020-09-28 05:08:14 So that's what tail rotors are for
general 2020-09-28 05:08:28 Or you could do contra-rotating rotors
general 2020-09-28 05:09:03 Or dual main rotors

general 2020-09-28 07:07:51 <@456226577798135808> What about Nevadamom/Momvada?
general 2020-09-28 07:08:18 Can't think up of anything for the other mods
general 2020-09-28 07:08:38 Other than puri = water bottle with arms and legs
general 2020-09-28 07:09:45 Add background?
general 2020-09-28 07:10:15 Nevada is space bat
general 2020-09-28 07:10:18 The Pokemon Lunala
general 2020-09-28 07:11:25 Can't find Nevada
general 2020-09-28 07:11:35 All I know Nevada is a Lunala (the Pokemon)
general 2020-09-28 07:12:59 Looks like it's time for Momvada

general 2020-09-28 22:41:07 Doesn't Nvidia use their own graphics card in cloud gaming?
general 2020-09-28 22:43:40 Thinking about a graphics card is just a co-processor
general 2020-09-28 22:46:01 The graphics card really is just having another CPU isn't it?
general 2020-09-28 22:46:47 Stjll, it could be used for extra processing wouldn't it!
general 2020-09-28 22:46:51 ?*
general 2020-09-28 22:47:18 Well, the link you sent
general 2020-09-28 22:51:00 I'd side with vip
general 2020-09-28 22:51:22 He isn't really implying the CPU is useless
general 2020-09-28 22:52:06 I just find it that he was implying that the GPU could do some load off the CPU
general 2020-09-28 22:55:16 Both of you weren't wrong
general 2020-09-28 22:56:16 So vip, the Wikipedia page said the GPU has plenty of cores right?
general 2020-09-28 22:59:36 "Their highly parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose central processing units (CPUs) for algorithms that process large blocks of data in parallel."
general 2020-09-28 22:59:44 So AI?
general 2020-09-28 23:01:32 2012, reminds me of my old Android phone that didn't even have 1 GB
general 2020-09-28 23:02:51 Wait, it's all not interested?
general 2020-09-28 23:04:03 Why am I even joining useless arguments in the morning

general 2020-09-29 01:27:23 Is it possible to access the rest of the USB drive (second partition, storage) while a Live OS is running (first partition)
general 2020-09-29 01:36:07 obc is just smol chungus
general 2020-09-29 01:36:40 Also that doesn't sound like it belongs in the chat
general 2020-09-29 01:43:51 I'll go play some B&S, to relax

general 2020-09-29 07:10:16 Just casually warp time and space while it's flying
general 2020-09-29 07:10:28 I know
general 2020-09-29 07:11:11 Fr though I wonder how that camera recorded the propellers that distorted
general 2020-09-29 07:12:27 <@!221487880487436288> I thought it just freezes from how perfectly synced up it is, not distort
general 2020-09-29 07:12:54 Paint your Panther tank pink
general 2020-09-29 07:13:40 Then what causes that distortion then?

general 2020-09-30 07:45:28 ~~YouTube COPPA compliance, Undertale, FNaF, etc.~~
general 2020-09-30 07:47:14 No, a bit too controversial for Discord
general 2020-09-30 14:05:46 Cat Stevens 

I immediately think of Steven Universe's literal cat fingers episode
general 2020-09-30 14:06:00 Like cats for fingers
general 2020-09-30 14:06:13 It's not really that bad
general 2020-09-30 14:06:28 Considering its a cartoon with kids watching
general 2020-09-30 14:06:57 Yes, from what I've heard
general 2020-09-30 14:07:03 As a cartoon, it isn't bad
general 2020-09-30 14:07:10 But as with any fandom
general 2020-09-30 14:07:17 Expect it to be bad if kids have access
general 2020-09-30 14:08:10 Imagine if your mom was actually a former colonizer leading a revolution under a new life
general 2020-09-30 14:08:23 That's literally Steven's mom
general 2020-09-30 14:09:32 I just realized something
general 2020-09-30 14:09:46 All gems are just gay alien rock women
general 2020-09-30 14:10:10 Steven is the only male gem
general 2020-09-30 14:10:51 I wonder how that'll work out for him in adulthood
general 2020-09-30 14:11:07 Like imagine being the only male human on this planet
general 2020-09-30 14:11:28 It's really not that bad
general 2020-09-30 14:11:34 Clarence is worse tbh
general 2020-09-30 14:12:17 Modern cartoons aren't that bad compared to the dark ages of cartoons 

*Live action*
general 2020-09-30 14:13:05 TTG is just meh it exists for me
general 2020-09-30 14:13:44 Still more bearable than watching Twitter in chaos
general 2020-09-30 14:14:26 Thundercats Roar is their take on TTG
general 2020-09-30 14:14:59 <@387195148741771275> I dunno, maybe some yoga crap
general 2020-09-30 14:15:43 I wonder how two kids are more intelligent than even the smartest leaders we have here
general 2020-09-30 14:16:05 Uncle Grandpa is just a kids' imagination on steroids
general 2020-09-30 14:16:37 Clarence is a cartoon about a mentally delayed kid's adventures
general 2020-09-30 14:17:29 Uncle Grandpa isn't that bad having watched it, or maybe I've been exposed to worse stuff that it doesn't bother me no more
general 2020-09-30 14:17:58 That's a decent cartoon tbh
general 2020-09-30 14:18:12 But this is better

general 2020-09-30 14:21:42 What do y'all think of that cartoon with two Mexican kids?
general 2020-09-30 14:22:34 It's still enjoyable compared to Clarence in my tastes
general 2020-09-30 14:22:58 Clarence sometimes is just disgusting
general 2020-09-30 14:23:10 Oh and that Total Drama cartoon
general 2020-09-30 14:23:17 Who the heck sniffs farts and enjoys it?
general 2020-09-30 14:23:45 Craig of the Creek isn't bad
general 2020-09-30 14:24:45 Clarence had one episode where apparently it's fine to leave your kids at school and let them get lost and injured
general 2020-09-30 14:25:00 It's apparently fine to let your kid go at school even if they're sick
general 2020-09-30 14:25:30 That cartoon implies his parents are a bit too careless
general 2020-09-30 14:25:37 Yeah that's the kid
general 2020-09-30 14:25:52 Who looks a bit delayed compared to his classmates
general 2020-09-30 14:26:12 Seriously he has the mind of a pre schooler

general 2020-09-30 14:31:05 The man actually had nightmares of divorce and work stress
general 2020-09-30 14:31:22 He's actually pretty responsible in that one episode he visited his parents
general 2020-09-30 14:31:55 I dunno tbh
general 2020-09-30 14:32:07 Mary's mom is crazy

plane-crazy 2020-10-03 03:38:01 Can a plane work without rudders
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 03:38:06 Like no vertical wings at all
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 03:39:16 But what if it's not a bomber
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 03:40:46 I didn't notice the Avro Arrow had rudders

plane-crazy 2020-10-09 10:02:19 I forgot how my old light fighter looked like
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 10:02:23 So I made a new one
general 2020-10-09 10:15:29 I looked at my old B-1 Lancer
general 2020-10-09 10:15:31 It's ugly
general 2020-10-09 10:51:17 What do you call a motor lock/locked motor expert?

||A locksmith||
general 2020-10-09 10:52:14 yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 10:57:59 Let's call motor lock experts locksmiths
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 11:40:56 Simplified my light fighter, now it's at 447 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 11:41:35 
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 11:41:38 Yes, wedges
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 11:41:52 And less stuff
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 11:42:20 While it lacks in speed, I did manage to balance physics throttling and looks
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 11:42:34 And it's sharp both in pitch and nose
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 11:43:24 Well, I'm not really lagging
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 11:43:30 In a nose dive I reach 680
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 11:43:54 Physics throttling
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 11:44:00 That sucks
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 11:44:26 Tbh slow-mo is more tolerable than stop motion
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 11:45:10 447 blocks probably would be enough to reduce physics throttling
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 11:45:19 And reducing the engine array to 2 layers
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 11:46:43 That is unless I add weapons on it
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 11:46:51 Motor locc bomb will make go die
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 01:36:30 For a light fighter, how good is a speed of 640 for 90 degree climb and 680 for a 90 dive
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 01:36:45 Like the plane is perfectly vertical
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 01:37:28 Still doesn't stop people here from breaking speed records, don't they?
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 09:41:40 I was gonna look up for aircraft with the stealth fighter seam in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 09:41:52 But none didn't have any that I could ~~copy~~ learn from

plane-crazy 2020-10-12 09:42:46 I did find something else though when I searched for Su-57

general 2020-10-12 09:47:12 Does a 1x7 block have less weight than 1x1 block
general 2020-10-12 09:47:23 It sounds stupid but I still wanna know
general 2020-10-12 09:47:51 Also, does a TNT block increase physics throttling
general 2020-10-12 09:49:36 Yes, I've managed to make my motor locked plane be near 500 with them
general 2020-10-12 09:49:50 522 without weapons
general 2020-10-12 09:50:11 However I am planning to modify it further considering it's flight is nice
general 2020-10-12 09:51:59 Well that's an unfortunate coincidence
general 2020-10-12 09:52:43 It's still bearable, just don't go too extreme with the hooks
general 2020-10-12 09:53:07 
general 2020-10-12 09:53:07 
general 2020-10-12 09:53:10 I simplified
general 2020-10-12 09:53:21 I still feel like there could be more improvements
general 2020-10-12 09:53:49 This is Plane Crazy, so a twin engine would be redundant
general 2020-10-12 09:54:26 I would keep the delta, maybe add canards for finer control of aircraft pitching
general 2020-10-12 09:54:46 Maybe dual vertical stabilizers
general 2020-10-12 09:54:53 Speed, it depends on it's pitch
general 2020-10-12 09:55:05 When I go straight down, it goes 680 last time I checked
general 2020-10-12 09:55:18 I minimized the amount of wings I used
general 2020-10-12 09:56:44 I feel like the only thing I need to do is maybe add canards, add another rudder for stability and more fine tuning
general 2020-10-12 09:57:08 ~~Now do I delay motor locks without TNT, anchors?~~
general 2020-10-12 09:59:40 Hmm, anchors seem to provide some motor lock delay
general 2020-10-12 09:59:44 That's good
general 2020-10-12 10:01:34 Well, now I can do those tilted rudders without TNT
general 2020-10-12 10:02:25 I should still try to minimize motor lock usage though
general 2020-10-12 10:03:08 Well, I'm gonna go ahead and simplify and tune even further
general 2020-10-12 13:15:05 What about flies?
general 2020-10-12 13:15:34 Flies are food for just about almost every species
general 2020-10-12 13:15:51 Decomposition is important
general 2020-10-12 13:16:33 <@!451025784228806656> My phobia still doesn't want to agree
general 2020-10-12 13:16:38 But logic and reasoning says yes
general 2020-10-12 13:16:58 Lizards are nice though
general 2020-10-12 13:17:22 <@!447221768520859659> Did you seriously count them to get an approximate
general 2020-10-12 13:17:44 lizerd family
general 2020-10-12 13:17:59 ~~now take one and take care of it and it will grow up into a big lizerd~~
general 2020-10-12 13:18:18 I remember having a lizard fall on my foot
general 2020-10-12 13:18:28 It felt weird and I reacted considering it was late night

general 2020-10-12 13:22:05 Spiders do be making silk and eating bugs

general 2020-10-12 13:24:15 It doesn't trigger my phobia that much
general 2020-10-12 13:24:37 Still isn't that bad
general 2020-10-12 13:24:45 Seen worse
general 2020-10-12 13:25:21 I've seen an image involving detailed surgery

general 2020-10-12 13:29:02 she slep now
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:30:10 Tbh I'm a little sick to think of how I'll do tilted rudders. I know I have to use motor lock delay but I'm out of brain juice
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:30:36 And anchors
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:31:18 yes, I'll go put them on top
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:31:30 And add motor 2 onto motor locc tower
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:31:35 With anchors to do motor locc delay
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:31:43 So I can do it on non-PvP servers also
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:32:13 I have an idea of how I'll do it now
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:32:29 I'll still motor locc two huge engines to make ***r o u n d*** exhaust
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:32:39 The roundest boi you'll ever see
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:33:59 That'll work when physics throttling isn't an issue
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:34:08 Less weight
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:34:19 ~~those huge engines are heavy~~
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:34:46 So motor locks aren't a significant physics throttling thing
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:34:52 Good to know
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:35:24 I only only have two motor 2s for the main wings
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:35:38 Everything else relies on manually controlled hidden control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:36:06 I use tail-less delta wings
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:36:41 I'd add canards also if needed
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:36:46 Anyways back to building
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:37:20 I make them big
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:37:35 Literally the entire delta wing has a control surface hidden
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:38:14 
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:39:35 I just do them because a tailed design was a bit lacking for me
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:39:49 In pitch at least
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:40:34 Also, the motor lock itself hides the control surfaces within the wing
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:40:41 Doesn't jam for me when I hid it inside the wing
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:42:00 I don't experience any jamming, no noticeable delay for me other than the control surfaces themselves adjusting from lowered to raised and vice versa
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:42:06 I guess somehow I got it to work right
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:42:51 A lot of times I use locked motors for medium sized builds
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:43:38 The kind of wings I use are the kind you'd find on the Eurofighter Typhoon/Saab JAS-39 Gripen/Dassault Rafale/etc.
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:44:01 Those small wings in front of said planes
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:44:21 I know
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:44:27 I've used them multiple times
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:44:50 Conveyors aren't that glitchy when done right
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:45:05 <@!447221768520859659> What if rickje added afterburner engines
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:45:16 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:45:42 But can you control said speed
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:47:48 I gave up on trying to constantly improving my speed
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:48:07 If it can outspeed a good amount of planes, then it's good enough
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 22:28:38 These look extreme for tilted rudders xp
general 2020-10-12 22:29:49 Has there been any fighter jets with V-tails?
general 2020-10-12 22:30:36 <#384021699466756107> Well, I have a V-tail
general 2020-10-12 22:30:48 goodsleep

general 2020-10-12 22:36:30 I misread that as Twitter

general 2020-10-12 22:42:35 Is it possible to transfer items?

general 2020-10-12 22:43:05 he gone
general 2020-10-12 22:43:07 can't ping
general 2020-10-12 22:43:24 Linking
general 2020-10-12 22:43:27 Maybe that's a way
general 2020-10-12 22:44:17 I usually think of my brother no more than a young idiot
general 2020-10-12 22:45:22 Being his assistant during online classes
general 2020-10-12 22:45:32 He constantly pisses me off with sluggish reactions
general 2020-10-12 22:45:45 Like even dial up internet would be more useful
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 23:00:00 Or maybe I'll just embrace it

general 2020-10-13 03:53:01 wait this is general
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 03:53:33 Any effects tilted wings have on flight (for example, V-tails)
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 03:58:10 I wonder if canards could benefit from it
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 04:30:35 Does the game's own landing gears have any stability issues
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 04:51:30 <#384025409945337856> This is how it ended up looking like
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 04:51:35 V-tail looks fine, not out of place at least for me

general 2020-10-13 05:34:51 Instead of just doing Opera GX's RAM limiting, they actually do improvements within the code
general 2020-10-13 05:35:12 They implemented some features within Firefox already
general 2020-10-13 05:35:35 Delet Chrome, use reskinned Chrome

general 2020-10-13 05:36:50 https://servo.org/ This is the site to Mozilla's new browser engine
general 2020-10-13 05:36:55 They lack the funds to continue

Why 15 seconds aaa
general 2020-10-13 09:21:05 Compared the performance of my fighters. Light fighter has better manuverability while my V-tailed one is best suited for interceptor duty if it weren't for physics throttling

general 2020-10-13 09:22:07 Smol, I may not have any experience in that

general 2020-10-13 09:26:12 I think the V-tail is making my plane unstable

general 2020-10-13 09:31:34 <@!447221768520859659> To be fair, they could just use existing 5G technology
general 2020-10-13 09:31:54 It's not that slow
general 2020-10-13 09:32:05 Most of us deal with 20 MBPS
general 2020-10-13 09:32:10 Download speed mind you
general 2020-10-13 09:32:43 I mean we are surrounded by electromagnetic waves, aren't we?
general 2020-10-13 09:34:38 "Low-band 5G uses a similar frequency range to current 4G cellphones, 600-700 MHz, giving download speeds a little higher than 4G: 30-250 megabits per second (Mbit/s)"

About there I shouldn't be concerned
general 2020-10-13 09:34:45 "Mid-band 5G uses microwaves of 2.5-3.7 GHz, currently allowing speeds of 100-900 Mbit/s"

plane-crazy 2020-10-13 23:14:16 It is potato, it's dual core

plane-crazy 2020-10-13 23:35:26 What are those wings
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 23:35:35 That nose also bothers me
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 23:37:04 Do what I do, use motor lock tower
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 23:37:18 That's how I hide the motors of my plane
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 23:37:27 Hide it into the body itself
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 23:39:34 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 23:39:48 Be me and motor lock the aileron
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 23:39:59 So you can yeet away the control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 23:40:46 And achieve absolute s m o o t h

general 2020-10-14 04:03:33 Or maybe it's just the server I'm in
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 04:15:54 I tried mounting tank suspension sideways, on a car platform
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 04:15:57 It worked decently
general 2020-10-14 04:39:40 Did I just hear leaved

The test flights revealed, that with the shielding used, the crew would not be endangered by radiation from the reactor, including with low-altitude flights, but that there was a risk of radioactive contamination in the event of an accident."

general 2020-10-14 07:39:33 Hmm, maybe a V-tail was a bad idea
general 2020-10-14 07:39:41 Because it felt much slower than my light fighter
general 2020-10-14 07:40:08 What usually causes physics throttling
general 2020-10-14 07:40:34 What about locked motors?
general 2020-10-14 07:42:17 So minimize motors, make as much blocks attached as possible and only use as much wings as needed

general 2020-10-14 07:47:04 How can there be overdesigned though?
general 2020-10-14 07:47:44 <@!448505589983739914> When the main wing is tilted/wing, does it provide any differences in flight
general 2020-10-14 07:48:09 Like do dihedral wings provide any differences
general 2020-10-14 07:48:31 Yes, what vip said
general 2020-10-14 07:49:23 <@!448505589983739914> Any differences during flight with those anhedral wings I see? https://i.pinimg.com/564x/2d/6a/21/2d6a2144aea12ce5617605ad741325bc.jpg
general 2020-10-14 07:50:25 Those can't be used as derogatory terms
general 2020-10-14 07:50:42 The N and R word though are inherently derogatory
general 2020-10-14 07:51:27 <@!448505589983739914> So, anhedral does the opposite, would that make it more manuverable?
general 2020-10-14 07:52:21 That's an interesting loop
general 2020-10-14 07:52:40 Edited it immediately
general 2020-10-14 07:52:58 I usually rely on passive designs
general 2020-10-14 07:53:17 To achieve high manuverability, no engines involved
general 2020-10-14 07:54:08 So delta wings are slower but unstable
general 2020-10-14 07:55:03 So anhderal delta wings are very unstable but highly manuverable?
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 08:05:54 yes
general 2020-10-14 08:55:48 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakovlev_Yak-141 this plane looks weird

general 2020-10-14 09:11:12 It's honestly decent
general 2020-10-14 09:11:50 After further testing I have evaluated that this plane flies like crap

general 2020-10-14 09:12:20 I shall now adapt the European fighter build
general 2020-10-14 09:12:27 Because it flies so slow
general 2020-10-14 09:12:38 68 Million?

general 2020-10-14 13:03:59 I wonder when plane becomes too long
general 2020-10-14 13:04:37 So the new iPhone 12 is just an upgraded 11
general 2020-10-14 13:05:04 Better buy a OnePlus Nord or a Google Pixel instead
general 2020-10-14 13:05:11 At least I get root warranty
general 2020-10-14 13:05:18 With OnePlus at least
general 2020-10-14 13:05:34 <@!437152336176087052> Gimmicks are features, just like removing the headphone jack
general 2020-10-14 13:08:16 <@!725583147928125461> What about this? https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_nord-10289.php
general 2020-10-14 13:08:22 It has root warranty so if you rooted it
general 2020-10-14 13:08:28 Well you still have warranty from OnePlus
general 2020-10-14 13:08:39 So go be free and Android to your liking
general 2020-10-14 13:09:14 I'm not really a fan of Apple, too restrictive
general 2020-10-14 13:09:57 Meh, still not that customizable even if jailbroken
general 2020-10-14 13:10:56 Thing is, does iOS have a Xposed Modules alternative
general 2020-10-14 13:11:56 Telegram if I remember doesn't lose image quality
general 2020-10-14 13:12:54 > It’s not that restrictive,  just jailbreak it lmao
I mean restrictive as in modifying the operating system itself, that was the main appeal for me
general 2020-10-14 13:13:49 <@!448505589983739914> It went to JPEG Hell
general 2020-10-14 13:14:59 You can also throw in most of North America

general 2020-10-15 09:19:34 I wonder what goes onto the minds of people as to why they think it's acceptable to jump around and invade personal space while someone's clearly building
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:27:02 Well, what does it mean when my plane's nose is up
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:27:05 It slightly pitches up
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:27:10 And when it's down
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:27:20 It slightly pitches down continuously also
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:30:01 It barely has any wings in front
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:30:35 
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:30:53 It just continues slightly pitching  in the direction it left off
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:30:59 Locked motors
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:32:36 If I put more wings in the front
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:32:45 Well I'm just gonna pitch up based on personal experience
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:33:15 It's not pitching down
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:33:25 The issue is it's continuing to pitch in the absence of input
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:35:13 Well I just realized it only pitches up when at an extreme angle
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:35:43 Well I'm just gonna do the usual hidden wings
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:35:49 Should be easy to implement in a motor locked design
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:36:53 I prefer wing design
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:39:15 Again, I prefer wing design
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:39:51 Ballasts don't work well for me tbh
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:48:36 I did it, just needs more tuning
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:51:59 I literally only needed to add a few wings in front, hidden within the body
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:53:51 Tootipoodi
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 09:53:59 Makes me think of toothpaste, ngl

general 2020-10-15 12:29:46 I may or may not need to reduce engines
general 2020-10-15 12:30:27 Okay maybe not, guess it's just drag
general 2020-10-15 12:30:56 ok lag
general 2020-10-15 12:30:59 it's lag
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 12:37:21 I dunno what's more impressive
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 12:37:27 The camo or the details
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 12:37:55 those wings are curvy
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 12:39:43 Aaa my original light fighter still outpeforms my new design
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 12:39:48 Simply because less lag

plane-crazy 2020-10-15 12:43:37 wedges
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 12:43:39 lots of wedges

general 2020-10-15 13:53:32 4 studs = 1 meter
general 2020-10-15 13:53:53 I'm gonna do quick Math
general 2020-10-15 13:54:16 There are 1000 meters in a kilometer
general 2020-10-15 13:54:39 Mach 2 is 2469.6 km/h
general 2020-10-15 13:56:21 If we're going by 4 studs
general 2020-10-15 13:56:42 Then 1000 meters * 4 studs = 4000 studs in a kilometer
general 2020-10-15 13:56:45 Unless I'm wrong
general 2020-10-15 13:57:44 I can't really think now

general 2020-10-15 13:58:45 <@!177743269105500160> I'm more interested in the plane below
general 2020-10-15 13:58:47 What is that
general 2020-10-15 13:59:06 Upon closer inspection it makes me think of the F-35
general 2020-10-15 13:59:44 The intakes confused me

general 2020-10-15 14:00:50 https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5976853.jpg Are the F-22 intakes really that boxy?

general 2020-10-15 14:02:14 > ~~f22 is a literal box~~
<@!527653676022628353> I can't disagree with you there
general 2020-10-15 14:02:16 It's boxy
general 2020-10-15 14:02:25 At least the intakes make it boxy

general 2020-10-15 14:06:56 Exhaust go out
general 2020-10-15 14:07:06 And fan add more thrust

general 2020-10-16 04:28:43 How useful are motor lock delays
general 2020-10-16 04:29:27 Well, I'm gonna try building another plane

general 2020-10-16 04:33:31 Woah there
general 2020-10-16 04:33:35 This ain't Science class
general 2020-10-16 05:05:12 the muscc is good businessman
general 2020-10-16 05:32:09 Because I'm too braindead to think up of an uncreative response
general 2020-10-16 05:32:37 Opinion on what?
general 2020-10-16 05:33:28 ***o h***
general 2020-10-16 05:34:04 I wonder how large can a fighter be until it's unacceptable
general 2020-10-16 05:34:23 Yes, higher ping is better internet
general 2020-10-16 05:35:27 I wonder who has the lowest ping here
general 2020-10-16 05:35:45 Well you probably either have crap or decent internet
general 2020-10-16 05:35:50 -ping
general 2020-10-16 05:36:10 I have online classes atm
general 2020-10-16 05:36:36 iNephus is on fiber optic
general 2020-10-16 05:36:54 It means you have fast internet
general 2020-10-16 05:36:55 very fast
general 2020-10-16 05:37:39 <@!656137684213039124> You know those trap McDonalds' builds
general 2020-10-16 05:38:13 Same mechanism, use a lever so that it ends up on the edge of the world
general 2020-10-16 05:38:25 And anchor the base that rotates the lever
general 2020-10-16 05:38:33 So it won't fall off
general 2020-10-16 05:39:04 0 ping = no internet
general 2020-10-16 05:39:30 Better
general 2020-10-16 05:40:10 Because you have no internet in the first place
the-dump 2020-10-16 05:40:49 <@!403843930543882241> Quiet, we're messing with him
general 2020-10-16 05:42:21 1299 Philippine Pesos is 26.70 US Dollars
general 2020-10-16 05:42:46 <@!347182144873037824> Well you better let that charge for a bit just so you don't suddenly die
general 2020-10-16 05:42:50 hey wait a second 0balance
general 2020-10-16 05:43:19 weren't you supposed to be on mute for a year
general 2020-10-16 05:43:31 Fair
general 2020-10-16 05:43:42 I mean I'd be bored too if I couldn't talk in this wild chat
general 2020-10-16 05:43:56 <@!403843930543882241> If it has bulge, dispose of it properly
general 2020-10-16 05:44:40 ***wait a sec not that kind of bulge***
general 2020-10-16 05:45:13 > huge bulge
no I mean this
general 2020-10-16 05:45:37 It's just bulge
general 2020-10-16 05:45:58 If it had a huge bulge then that means your battery already exploded and is probably leaking it's acids
general 2020-10-16 05:46:20 Unless capacitors act different from batteries
general 2020-10-16 05:47:22 <@!656137684213039124> Is it when you get a job?
general 2020-10-16 05:49:10 616.50 USD
general 2020-10-16 05:52:48 ~~go cheap and reduce costs with amd~~
general 2020-10-16 05:53:10 Be programmer, earn Google money
general 2020-10-16 05:53:22 Make games, fill with ads and microtransactions
general 2020-10-16 05:53:47 600 sounds like above normie but below gaming pc
general 2020-10-16 05:54:05 Is there a category between normie and gaming
general 2020-10-16 05:54:22 Yes, that budget is for casual gaming
general 2020-10-16 05:55:04 8 GB of RAM is normie, an AMD A-series or an i3/Ryzen 3 is normie to me
general 2020-10-16 05:55:12 Below that is budget
general 2020-10-16 05:55:29 Low-end AMD A-Series/Intel Celeron with 4 GB-ish of RAM
general 2020-10-16 05:55:42 Usually on budget laptops
general 2020-10-16 05:57:02 <@!656137684213039124> Be a Google Play Store developer

It's $25 one-time to get a developer account, and you can make some cheap clickbaity game with ads and microtransactions
general 2020-10-16 05:57:21 Basically, be a mobile game dev
general 2020-10-16 05:57:56 <@456226577798135808> I'll assume Shadow isn't old enough for a job
general 2020-10-16 05:58:29 Minors are also legally not allowed to go out anyways during this pandemic from what I remember
general 2020-10-16 05:58:51 Really depends
general 2020-10-16 05:59:10 We have online classes
general 2020-10-16 05:59:17 Physical classes... I doubt so
general 2020-10-16 06:00:13 Basically, just do what you need to do and stay the heck at home for the most part, some areas are more lenient and are opening up for tourism albeit under strict rules
general 2020-10-16 06:01:40 https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html this exists apparently
general 2020-10-16 06:01:58 I shall call the Intel NUC
general 2020-10-16 06:02:02 Gaming Pi
general 2020-10-16 06:02:25 My dad used half of the 222 GB of this SSD
general 2020-10-16 06:03:06 <@!656137684213039124> That's schiesse for even casual gaming
general 2020-10-16 06:03:34 *cries in Snapdragon 4XX and 2 GB of RAM*
general 2020-10-16 06:03:42 cheap parents, that's why
general 2020-10-16 06:04:32 The Snapdragon 4XX series is about as good as the Snapdragon 801
general 2020-10-16 06:04:44 A 32 bit processor from a decade ago
general 2020-10-16 06:04:54 Literally only improvement is that it's 64-bit
general 2020-10-16 06:05:35 Grammagrammar
general 2020-10-16 06:06:05 iOS still isn't appealing enough for me tbh
general 2020-10-16 06:06:08 Because it's closed off
general 2020-10-16 06:06:30 I just prefer the open source nature of Android
general 2020-10-16 06:06:59 Plus there are some good phones within the mid-range area
general 2020-10-16 06:07:38 I still want the OnePlus Nord, nice specs and has warranty for root
general 2020-10-16 06:09:13 literally just wings
general 2020-10-16 06:09:29 It looks like a mutated moth baby
general 2020-10-16 06:09:31 anyways, brb
general 2020-10-16 06:10:41 <@!347182144873037824> About as expensive as a Mitsubishi Mirage (well, almost anyways)
general 2020-10-16 06:10:44 now to brb
general 2020-10-16 06:53:15 i wonder how big a fighter can be in this game
general 2020-10-16 06:59:07 I'm still confused on how miner did the nose on his vulcan
general 2020-10-16 06:59:42 aaa
general 2020-10-16 06:59:58 Meanwhile I can't even do the 5th gen fighter nose seam
general 2020-10-16 07:01:05 Hmm
general 2020-10-16 07:01:07 What if I split the nose
general 2020-10-16 07:01:13 And then motor lock them .5 studs
general 2020-10-16 07:01:18 So they'll be joined together
general 2020-10-16 07:03:04 still looks awkward
general 2020-10-16 07:04:33 Me locking two wedges in an attempt to make that seam
general 2020-10-16 07:07:08 Making it larger does not help
general 2020-10-16 07:10:28 I hate how there's this vertical line, I just want the horizontal seam
general 2020-10-16 07:11:43 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/F-22_Raptor_edit1_%28cropped%29.jpg how do I 5th gen fighter nose seam
general 2020-10-16 07:11:56 the nose aaa
general 2020-10-16 07:14:12 There's another way I wanted to try
general 2020-10-16 07:14:18 But it makes it look like an A-10 Warthog
general 2020-10-16 07:23:04 I give up
general 2020-10-16 07:24:28 im gonna  go unfriend an unde
general 2020-10-16 08:44:33 "Well landing gears in real life have suspension"
"Just use suspension"
general 2020-10-16 08:44:53 I probably shouldn't be surprised
general 2020-10-16 08:45:05 But this person isn't aware planes have suspensions in the form of an oleo strut
general 2020-10-16 08:56:13 <@456226577798135808> Reminds me of leaf springs and torsion bars for some reason
general 2020-10-16 08:56:48 Well, still need to extend the seam a bit
general 2020-10-16 08:56:55 Otherwise, I'm making some progress with stealth fighter noses
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 09:06:35 w a t
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 09:14:01 I think I've made a decent stealth fighter nose, still needs more refinement
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 09:24:53 Still can't manage to fit a half wedge in it
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 09:25:14 Apart from the tip of the nose
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 09:27:59 I'm gonna go try finding some canopies
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 09:33:02 I may or may not need to put a locc on top of al occ
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 10:08:34 well crap

plane-crazy 2020-10-16 23:54:44 Still considering what kind of wing configuration I should add here
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 23:57:28 To be specific, whether to rely on delta only or add elevators also
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 00:01:07 Probably should go for delta only, elevators sucked for me

plane-crazy 2020-10-18 03:58:20 this looks cursed
general 2020-10-18 04:05:42 What the heck
general 2020-10-18 04:05:46 Is that Pikachu
general 2020-10-18 04:09:02 That is blursed
general 2020-10-18 04:09:08 It's both blessed and cursed
help 2020-10-18 05:06:46 https://streamable.com/egmudu why is this spasming
general 2020-10-18 05:10:06 Well don't go blacklisting bacons then
general 2020-10-18 05:10:17 If you were blacklisting them on sight then you are blacklisting them based on looks
general 2020-10-18 05:10:19 No exceptions
general 2020-10-18 05:11:36 > "intakes useless"
<@!536013994188865554> Well, I give him luck with cooling or finding ways for the engine to breathe
general 2020-10-18 05:12:29 Because it'd be really inefficient to run an engine purely on fuel, not only would that increase fuel consumption but that'd also reduce cooling
general 2020-10-18 05:13:04 > do you think we are that rich
<@!447221768520859659> Money's not only the problem, that thing has low power, better use it in space where you won't deccelerate
general 2020-10-18 05:13:42 Yes but that plane wasn't fast nor would it be practical
general 2020-10-18 05:14:17 <@!429826358827417601> Exhaust
general 2020-10-18 05:15:12 An engine is out taking air
general 2020-10-18 05:15:25 An engine is in taking air
general 2020-10-18 05:16:28 I don't get how outtake would work, if an engine is intaking air
general 2020-10-18 05:16:35 As in, it's taking in air
general 2020-10-18 05:16:56 Yes, he's literally describing what an exhaust is

general 2020-10-18 05:20:47 ~~that was a horrible pun~~
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 05:22:44 Has anyone made this on their plane? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading%E2%80%93edge_extension#Leading%E2%80%93edge_vortex_controller
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 05:22:54 Basically, flaps on the front of the wing
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 05:24:51 You could save up for more if you're resource intensive
general 2020-10-18 05:25:33 Has there been any plane with leading edge extensions in this game?
general 2020-10-18 05:25:56 Basically, flaps in the front instead of back
general 2020-10-18 05:27:41 Give me various aerodynamic devices I could add apart from leading edge extensions
general 2020-10-18 05:29:20 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/767257682511659018 <@!287779983445721088> A starfish would like to take all of your stocks

general 2020-10-18 05:32:09 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Canada_VZ-9_Avrocar The Canadians have built a UFO
general 2020-10-18 05:32:16 The Canadians are aliens
general 2020-10-18 05:33:46 I think I'm too braindeadened to understand
general 2020-10-18 05:42:56 The only two things I can do to improve aerodynamics is to add leading edge devices and a dedicated elevator

Not sure about canards on a 5th gen fighter
general 2020-10-18 05:44:08 yes railgun
general 2020-10-18 05:44:13 add magnet powered gun
general 2020-10-18 07:23:23 Herissson how do you angle things on your plane them so spasming out of control
general 2020-10-18 07:23:29 Herisson*
general 2020-10-18 07:23:32 Autocorrect sucks
general 2020-10-18 07:24:09 Doesn't help I'm on the budget of budget phones
general 2020-10-18 07:24:24 Snapdragon 4X with 2 GB of RAM
general 2020-10-18 07:25:01 Herisson, remember that Sukhoi 

How do you angle the back so it doesn't spasm
general 2020-10-18 07:25:20 I tried making a V tail
general 2020-10-18 07:26:03 Yes, I did that
general 2020-10-18 07:26:10 But the angle was done with a motor 2
general 2020-10-18 07:26:29 Well that explains it
general 2020-10-18 07:26:54 Lenovo S90 because I'm not trustworthy of a better phone
general 2020-10-18 07:28:05 Jif is peanut butter, and what the creator of GIF pronounces it as
general 2020-10-18 07:28:18 Snek
general 2020-10-18 07:29:29 If I had my own money, I'd buy a OnePlus Nord
general 2020-10-18 07:30:36 bug
general 2020-10-18 07:30:39 Also, I'm lagging
general 2020-10-18 07:31:09 How is it Jan 1, 1970 for Discord
general 2020-10-18 07:31:31 Ngl that train looks like a ship from the front
general 2020-10-18 07:31:45 Lightning
general 2020-10-18 07:32:53 I modified my light fighter which has the same configuration as the Mirage to have canards 

It ended up being level during conveyor drive based flight, barely any pitch changes
general 2020-10-18 07:33:29 Hmm yes American Mirage
general 2020-10-18 07:34:35 Is it normal to have almost 1K blocks on a fighter?
general 2020-10-18 07:34:59 I did it on my 5th generation fighter
general 2020-10-18 07:35:21 But it isn't airliner sized
general 2020-10-18 07:35:33 Literally about as large as my other planes
general 2020-10-18 07:35:58 I will take a picture of what I did
general 2020-10-18 07:36:27 But you can blame it on having lots of wedges in the front and having TNT balls in the IWB
general 2020-10-18 07:36:34 At least part of it
general 2020-10-18 07:36:51 It also has a tall motor lock tower compared to other planes I have
general 2020-10-18 07:37:26 I should add a missile instead, less laggy than just pure balls
general 2020-10-18 07:38:28 I feel like the buggy V tail is only causing problems
general 2020-10-18 07:39:07 Probably should invest in LERXes
general 2020-10-18 07:39:13 And actual elevators
general 2020-10-18 07:39:44 I wonder what else contributes to physics throttling
general 2020-10-18 07:39:48 Block count?
general 2020-10-18 07:40:05 Gooddie
general 2020-10-18 07:40:35 Same time with pyro but it's PM

general 2020-10-18 09:20:13 So 40s, 70s then 80s
general 2020-10-18 09:20:28 What is 50s and 60s not interesting enough for them?
general 2020-10-18 09:23:51 Actually I don't
general 2020-10-18 09:24:00 And I don't know why

general 2020-10-18 09:27:18 Yes but when it's melted you drink it

general 2020-10-18 09:31:47 You can't anyways, I doubt you can cram computer parts
general 2020-10-18 09:34:54 <@456226577798135808> If you're into modifying your phones, well here's a well known community for exactly that

general 2020-10-18 09:36:33 Costs are seen below
general 2020-10-18 09:36:52 Yes, I want that when I have a job
general 2020-10-18 09:36:56 I want *power*
general 2020-10-18 09:37:00 For a good price
general 2020-10-18 09:37:20 Even better
general 2020-10-18 09:37:27 Plus root warranty
general 2020-10-18 09:37:30 Another appeal for me
general 2020-10-18 09:37:40 So if I root it, well I still have warranty
general 2020-10-18 09:39:10 Still, I find OnePlus phones to be very desireable

general 2020-10-18 10:04:48 That looks like GLaDOS made it

plane-crazy 2020-10-18 10:11:43 ~~magnets?~~
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 10:12:27 There's only two things I can think of, magnets or trailer hitches

plane-crazy 2020-10-18 10:13:17 pls die

plane-crazy 2020-10-18 10:16:55 Or else
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 10:18:12 I summon Protogen if you don't sleep
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 10:28:11 <@456226577798135808> I almost forgot
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 10:29:17 Definitely not pro motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 10:29:30 But still locced
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 10:29:46 If I was then I'd be like Miner
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 10:32:23 I'm still disappointed by it's performance even if I removed by the V tail
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 10:34:02 Letting the TNT balls despawn added performance
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 10:38:37 Removing the rudders and explosives has improved performance
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 10:38:41 Though it's still throttled a bit
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 10:43:47 Are these the characteristics of a good plane?
- None or not noticeable physics throttling
- Level flight even with conveyor drives
- Whole body can act as an air brake, even during conveyor drive flight
- Highly manueverable
general 2020-10-18 10:46:05 I feel brainded

plane-crazy 2020-10-18 10:51:08 i cringed
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 10:51:18 look at the chat
general 2020-10-18 10:54:45 The fact that they request for a passport
general 2020-10-18 10:54:51 Just shows how stupid they are
general 2020-10-18 10:55:10 And also, the cooldown timer shows their intelligence
general 2020-10-18 10:55:50 You have the right to not give that information
general 2020-10-18 10:56:50 "Final Verdict. It is illegal for your employer to demand the surrender of your passport not only because of the prevailing laws. It is more importantly because of the connection of your passport to your recognized human rights."
general 2020-10-18 10:57:04 Keep in mind this is from a site for Overseas Filipino Workers
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 10:57:43 <@!447221768520859659> "I play a little bit but I don't like it" he says
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 10:57:47 In response
general 2020-10-18 10:58:11 No point doing that then
general 2020-10-18 10:58:26 It's literally against ToS, and the law for the NSFW part
general 2020-10-18 10:58:54 You're also legally not required to show your passport
general 2020-10-18 10:59:38 oh wait I misread the Google thing I search
general 2020-10-18 10:59:51 But still, you shouldn't be required to show that
general 2020-10-18 10:59:53 It's just a server
general 2020-10-18 11:01:16 Your credit card number
general 2020-10-18 11:01:29 <@456226577798135808> That is perfect
general 2020-10-18 11:02:03 But yes, do not give any personal information to Gamer Thailand

*Besides he has no use for that*
general 2020-10-18 11:02:56 The only scenario I could think of would be some strict verification for an online service, but that I think would only be limited to like IDs
general 2020-10-18 11:02:59 Not actual passports
general 2020-10-18 11:03:35 I think I need rest
general 2020-10-18 11:04:23 I feel like the only reason Ungamer Thailand would need for that is to doxx people

general 2020-10-18 11:07:07 It's from another server
general 2020-10-18 11:07:19 ~~which server has that 💯 but yikes~~
general 2020-10-18 11:08:21 I have no idea on how I'll make a swashplate
general 2020-10-18 11:21:36 Is middy an unde in this server?
general 2020-10-18 11:22:40 Also, middy_37 has mentioned minor and NSFW
general 2020-10-18 11:23:09 He bypassed the filters put in place
general 2020-10-18 11:23:55 "I was old member"

general 2020-10-18 11:28:56 <@370594904268734464>. <@441125486312030221> did two filter bypasses, both being very unwanted content

general 2020-10-18 12:48:53 Is it wrong to say my dad is stupid for being too lazy to add an email to my brother's Roblox and buying cheap fragile hardware
general 2020-10-18 12:49:33 He also doesn't understand phone hardware
general 2020-10-18 12:49:56 <@456226577798135808> He's in 4th grade, you think he'd add his own email
general 2020-10-18 12:50:17 Also, he thinks that phone hardware doesn't matter
general 2020-10-18 12:50:21 Yeah no
general 2020-10-18 12:50:32 Password reset
general 2020-10-18 12:50:44 <@456226577798135808> Oh I meant in the low end
general 2020-10-18 12:51:22 Low end hardware matters for me on phones
general 2020-10-18 12:51:46 My first Android phone is about as useful as a Nokia
general 2020-10-18 12:52:07 Literally 512 MB of RAM, old processor and limited storage
general 2020-10-18 12:52:13 And ancient software
general 2020-10-18 12:52:30 Also, very destructible
general 2020-10-18 12:52:40 So Nokia without durability but has touchscreen
general 2020-10-18 12:52:57 It's basically one of those ancient tiny phones that gets beaten by a smartwatch
general 2020-10-18 12:53:16 Next phone was a fragile plastic cheap thing
general 2020-10-18 12:53:56 Another being a Samsung Galaxy S5 that was laggy and constantly full in storage due to bloat and 16 GB of storage
general 2020-10-18 12:54:25 This phone I'm using is barely any better, having only improved in storage and software
general 2020-10-18 12:54:46 It even has a smartwatch processor, and 2 HM of RAM
general 2020-10-18 12:54:51 GB*
general 2020-10-18 12:55:13 So low end hardware does matter for some
general 2020-10-18 12:55:31 On the higher end, people don't care that much
general 2020-10-19 03:41:46 Processor pog
general 2020-10-19 03:41:48 RAM meh
general 2020-10-19 03:45:04 I have been visited by a hideous monstrosity when my plane was loaded in
general 2020-10-19 03:45:39 I've been visited by Lego knock off ninja turtle with no ninja
general 2020-10-19 03:46:37 <@!656137684213039124> Probably some rando who doesn't know how consoles work
general 2020-10-19 03:47:24 Consoles if I remember don't have to dedicate their resources to other programs, just the game you're playing and some basic features
general 2020-10-19 03:48:02 That's why even with a modified A-series chips they'll run fine at high-end graphics
general 2020-10-19 03:49:16 Let me translate
Consoles only game and chat and other stuff
general 2020-10-19 03:49:38 Computer have many software
general 2020-10-19 03:49:43 Many stuff to run
general 2020-10-19 03:50:03 No experience
general 2020-10-19 03:51:37 What usually causes physics throttling

plane-crazy 2020-10-19 04:16:49 yes i am

plane-crazy 2020-10-19 04:19:54 help
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 04:19:58 im right beside a sirenhead builder
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 04:20:11 I'm being terrorized by noise
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 04:20:21 And floppiness
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 04:20:26 I'll bring out my old crappy tank
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 04:20:35 Because that's the only thing I have that can decently ram stuff
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 04:22:04 oh no they rp
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 04:23:30 One of them blacklisted me
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 04:23:40 And the sirenhead builder has more cringe
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 04:24:06 An Among Us astronaut?
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 04:27:16 No one built that
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 04:27:40 I'd like to pretend that there's somebody actually named no one
general 2020-10-19 06:54:32 Imagine being under 13 feet
general 2020-10-19 06:55:00 oh wait there's actually an unde
general 2020-10-19 06:55:34 **FBI OPEN UP**

general 2020-10-19 06:59:54 Yeah mass join is sus
general 2020-10-19 07:00:12 But fr Gamer Thailand's server is a free unde list
general 2020-10-19 07:00:26 But don't mass join, that's sus
general 2020-10-19 07:00:53 <@!723419054114865202> Did he just locked out his server
general 2020-10-19 07:01:00 I guess his server is N. Korea now
general 2020-10-19 07:01:49 <@!429826358827417601> That aircraft looks like it has two main wings
general 2020-10-19 07:02:20 You literally can't join, he locked out any access
general 2020-10-19 07:02:33 His server became North Korea, in a simple way of describing it
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 01:04:49 Automatic? That's impossible 
Manually controlled? I just design it like a plane that explodes
general 2020-10-20 01:06:00 I make sliding canopies with a bjt of motor locking magic
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 01:36:57 Plot sized fighter jets are large
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 01:37:27 I just make mine medium to medium large sized
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 01:37:51 Leave
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 01:38:05 Just rejoin
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 01:38:39 A minute of waiting
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 01:40:10 *French word for egg*
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 01:41:21 What if motor 2s had toggleable option to lock when not in use
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 01:42:39 Still prefer it be a toggle setting, as they have a springy action when being pushed while active
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 01:42:54 <@572411935669354528> Is that why my plane flies so slow
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 01:44:06 Well, should aim for not having a block count of 960
general 2020-10-20 01:45:09 Why is it sinking
general 2020-10-20 01:46:10 Long
general 2020-10-20 01:47:11 Folding
general 2020-10-20 01:47:31 No
general 2020-10-20 01:47:45 You can fold in one plot and still have a huge ship
general 2020-10-20 01:48:15 <@565300409170919454> I've seen triple folding, even four folds
general 2020-10-20 01:49:52 I'm too lazy to fold, so I lock
general 2020-10-20 01:51:53 You wanna know how to make multi-account builds as huge as possible 

1.) Rent a VIP server 
2.) Buy a used server 
3.) Run multiple virtual machines running multiple accounts 
4.) Connect builds, use folding if needed
general 2020-10-20 01:52:26 Oh right
general 2020-10-20 01:52:52 But still you need something powerful to run those multiple sessions smooth enough
general 2020-10-20 01:53:27 But if it's just two qccoints
general 2020-10-20 01:53:36 O h

general 2020-10-20 01:54:30 And claims the record for biggest build
general 2020-10-20 01:54:57 <@671156550546751550> Claim the server record for biggest build
general 2020-10-20 01:55:55 My biggest build is an ugly triple segment jumbo jet
general 2020-10-20 01:56:06 It got down vote bombed and rightfully so
general 2020-10-20 01:56:13 It's ugly and boxy
general 2020-10-20 01:56:59 You know you can fold pieces of builds, that's why jumbo jets exist
general 2020-10-20 01:57:10 They fold wings
general 2020-10-20 01:57:31 Oh I thought single acc builds
general 2020-10-20 01:57:41 Yes I am dumb
general 2020-10-20 01:57:49 Bonk me with the dumb hammer
general 2020-10-20 01:58:24 I see miner's build
general 2020-10-20 01:59:02 Ah yes it's 1970
general 2020-10-20 02:00:17 The Titanic is an overbuilt build and most of them suck
general 2020-10-20 02:00:46 All I do is just build planes
general 2020-10-20 02:00:57 I'm lazy
general 2020-10-20 02:01:14 Not impossible but rare
general 2020-10-20 02:01:24 I've found one that looked nice tbh
general 2020-10-20 02:02:28 <@671156550546751550> There are plenty of good land and aquatic vehicles because the people who build them aren't lazy like me xd
general 2020-10-20 02:03:38 All I do is aerial vehicles tbh
general 2020-10-20 02:03:48 Can't do details on land vehicles
general 2020-10-20 02:04:01 My only good land vehicle is a bus
general 2020-10-20 03:54:59 I'm too lazy to even bother trying
general 2020-10-20 03:55:11 The standards are too high for me to stand a chance
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:57:14 Huh, an actual Sergal in the server
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:57:37 I never thought I'd see one here
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:58:11 @/Awsomeman1089
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 03:58:21 Just a fictional furry species

plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:32:10 That's if I could design a decent looking engine
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:32:27 Have to use motor locks anyways, can't design tilted rudders/V-tails without them
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:33:05 Also, another motor lock in the front to give it 5th generation fighter chimes
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:34:01 Before I go ahead and make it a rotating nozzle, I gotta first make a decent looking custom engine
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:34:54 locc
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:35:25 that's locc engine
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:36:21 Looks like all I need to do is to rotat e 1x4 wedges
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:36:34 But I should figure out how to make it moveable still
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:39:13 I've been motor locking early on in the game
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:39:41 It took me a while to learn how it works
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:39:55 No, no
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:40:01 **Nosefartu*
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 03:53:43 this does not look right
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 04:03:36 And now I just realized where to use the upper half wedge
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 04:05:54 i did it, now to figure out how to rotat e the engine
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 04:06:16 Even a poob brain like me did it
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 04:06:42 i just do this
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 04:06:48 And wait for it's spasming to settle
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 04:10:46 you measured the map
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 04:10:52 Now to make a build to measure the map
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 04:10:57 And use that build as a ruler
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 04:11:50 yes that is real
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 04:34:03 https://streamable.com/n5t85i Well, I made it rotate
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 04:34:13 But I gotta make the engine rotate, not the whole lock itself
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 04:36:01 Could also provide limited thrust vectoring
general 2020-10-21 04:37:11 So what is peak time
general 2020-10-21 04:38:23 So what you're saying is to avoid posting during 4 PM (Philippines)
general 2020-10-21 04:39:13 I'll go post at 7 PM then
general 2020-10-21 04:40:53 Humans invented sleep when they tried to imagine skipping time

general 2020-10-21 04:41:29 Same here
general 2020-10-21 04:43:49 That's actually pretty detailed

general 2020-10-21 04:46:14 That GIF looks like he's catching rocks
general 2020-10-21 04:46:29 His hands hurt
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 04:49:00 So apart from VTOL, there's apparently CTOL, STOL and V/STOL
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 04:49:17 And STOVL
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 04:50:07 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convair_XFY_Pogo Still can't get over how stubby this looks
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 04:50:38 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_XFV This looks more refined
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 04:54:30 I'll go design my plane with a combination of a tilt jet and lift jets

plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:38:51 No
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:39:11 When I think of Viper, I think of the one made by Dodge
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:39:23 Yes the experimental West German VTOL transport
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:39:48 I just use canards for finer control
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:40:08 Nowadays it's outmanuvered
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:40:19 The Russians
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:41:26 Should I do tilt jet or full thrust vectoring?
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:42:12 But the whole engine moves
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:42:32 oh right nozzle
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:42:56 Well, if it doesn't work then I'll do tilt jet
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:43:09 And by doesn't work, I mean muscle spasming

plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:44:44 I usually avoid VTOL as much as possible, reason being unnatural
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:45:22 Ballasts vs. wings though for pitching, I just find wings also have the added affect of manueverability
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:47:51 Do wings like to spasm?
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:48:19 Still have issues with V-tails
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:49:33 Otherwise I'll just give up tilting wings
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:49:39 And retain vertical rudders
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:50:47 I'm never gonna give you up <@!679109002222895114>
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:53:10 G Suite
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 05:54:50 I usually use wings to balance the pitch of my plane during uncontrolled flight

general 2020-10-21 12:41:09 After seeing an image of the Yakolev Yak-141, I have decided there is no such thing as a plane that's too long
general 2020-10-21 12:41:10 Only too short
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 12:44:48 I wish I could build cars like that but smaller
general 2020-10-21 12:46:49 Does anyone know why two motors together causes spasming

general 2020-10-21 12:48:24 Still a detail I'd like to add

general 2020-10-21 12:51:00 You two confuse me with those PFPs
general 2020-10-21 12:53:07 I think I'll just do pitch only thrust vectoring
general 2020-10-21 12:53:53 also that Maxrois guy told me to say sorry for unfriending him
general 2020-10-21 12:53:58 Like that just makes me wanna block him more
general 2020-10-21 12:55:16 I'm just adding it to a single nozzle plane
general 2020-10-21 12:57:09 I think I'll just stick to STOL
general 2020-10-21 12:57:21 VTOL isn't worth it for me
general 2020-10-21 12:59:57 Darkz?
general 2020-10-21 13:01:03 I wonder if with enough motor locked engines I can make it work even just a bit
general 2020-10-21 13:04:59 If I remember fermented grapes are used for alcoholic beverages

general 2020-10-21 13:05:34 Well, I dunno then
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:25:41 I wonder if I should add separate elevators
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:25:46 Unless the drag is too much to be useful
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:27:49 On the other hand I've added canards onto my 4th gen plane so why the heck not I'll add elevators
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:28:14 French is vertical

plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:34:03 I've did three motor lock towers, looks like I won't be adding an internal weapons bay
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:53:35 At a block count of 522 I think I might manage a reasonable block count

plane-crazy 2020-10-21 22:41:42 I wonder if this'll work in PC
creations-chat 2020-10-21 22:59:47 Incomplete but it doesn't throttle as much anymore, just needs more adjustments to compensate it lacking in pitch
creations-chat 2020-10-21 23:01:38 Before I'll do that, I'll first try adding hidden wings in the front to see if that'll change anything, if not then I'll go do that

general 2020-10-21 23:39:52 Do the locc if you want thicker wings
general 2020-10-21 23:40:06 I do them on every fighter I have
general 2020-10-21 23:42:25 The hardest nose to make is to make an accurate 5th generation fighter nose that also has chimes
general 2020-10-21 23:43:44 A lot of 5th generation fighters in this server I notice use the completely round noses or use triangle wedges but those lack in detail
general 2020-10-21 23:44:42 Ngl that plane could use a redesign
general 2020-10-21 23:45:42 Mitsubishi
general 2020-10-21 23:46:54 Physics throttling does not like the amount of motors on your build
general 2020-10-21 23:47:14 Or block count
creations-chat 2020-10-21 23:57:03 <:PogU:670373666164572172>
creations-chat 2020-10-22 03:54:19 Still physics throttled with 756 blocks, I think I'll just go make 4th generation fighters
general 2020-10-22 03:55:14 How much physics throttling does vectored thrust give?
general 2020-10-22 03:55:32 Compared to something like four huge engines
general 2020-10-22 03:57:10 I usually minimize wings anyways
general 2020-10-22 03:58:00 Without wings I can't do that, too unstable
general 2020-10-22 03:58:32 This is how I usually design planes
general 2020-10-22 03:58:53 I tend to avoid using wing panels for the main wings
general 2020-10-22 03:59:33 I prefer the slight thickness of half wedges plus it lets me hide control surfaces
general 2020-10-22 04:00:04 Tbh this design is the only plane I've found that worked very well for me
general 2020-10-22 04:02:10 It's fast and manuverable, not too high on block count and stable enough on conveyor drives, alongside the nice benefit of pitching up to act as an airbrake
general 2020-10-22 04:08:45 Technically you've invented something that hasn't existed in the game yet
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 04:09:08 https://streamable.com/qd2buw the plane is a supersonic airbrake

plane-crazy 2020-10-22 04:20:08 I just build planes
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 04:20:52 Fighter jets in general are intentionally unstable
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 04:25:55 I really don't know

plane-crazy 2020-10-22 04:31:25 Honestly, it's surprisingly stable for a plane with conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 04:32:03 At least when it's not going at speeds like 7k or higher
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 04:32:27 But this vid shows how much of a bad pilot I am
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 04:36:02 Another thing to add to creations just to see how people would think
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:12:28 That's nice
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:12:37 All I did was to have fun flying
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:12:43 As seen above
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:13:38 You're both either good or bad, probably the former
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:15:50 I wonder if it'd be a good idea to add vectored thrust onto that plane I just showed off
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:16:03 Sounds like a good dumb idea
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:16:30 Tbh I didn't even noticed I pulled a cobra
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:16:38 I was just trying to avoid hitting that hill
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:17:09 That oddly looks familiar, I think I pulled that off before but on a plane that I deleted
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:17:39 I only can only do 10K at best
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:18:31 That fifth generation jet? It had a severe case of physics throttling
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:18:42 It still has way too much throttling and block count
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:18:51 775 compared to 600 something
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:18:58 I have an even lighter fighter at 500ish blocks
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:19:11 Only difference being removal of canards and being slightly less stable with conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:19:22 Slightly less stable being that it pitches a little
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:19:28 Otherwise, perfectly fine
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:20:06 I motor locked wings and control surfaces onto half wedges
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:21:49 > https://tenor.com/view/pugachev-pugachevscobra-cobra-cobra-maneuver-jet-gif-17240783
<@!572411935669354528> I think this is possible, although not easy to pull off
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:22:40 I think I've been trying to pull it off without even noticing
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:22:48 Problem being is that I overshoot
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:22:55 And end up turning left or right a bit
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:24:08 I guess I've achieved supermanuverability then with my current airframe
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:24:33 Supermanuverability within plane crazy standards anyways
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:25:14 Literally just a 4th gen light fighter design, a design similar to the Saab JAS-39 Gripen
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:26:01 Do you people expect the Saab JAS-39 Gripen to be supermanuverable?
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:26:16 Because I literally built my plane with it's exact configuration, just not exactly body
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:27:18 I still don't know why you people get so worked up over these

plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:28:53 Yes, it is good Swedish plane
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:29:16 It's highly manuverable, but can't do post stall manuvers
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:29:31 Which is something I can't do now that I think of it
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:30:41 I'll just take people's advice
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:31:01 And assume that the gains of vectored thrust in this game is outweighed by it's negatives
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:31:40 ~~Only reason I'd do that is to attempt to make the tightest loop~~
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:32:32 That's a lot of control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:33:23 Thrust vectoring is possible, but I do with movable nozzles
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:33:39 But actual functional thrust vectoring, I'm not so sure
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:33:54 The line, I think chimes
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:34:21 All I did was do some motor lock to add chines/chimes
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:35:22 <@!429826358827417601> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chine_(aeronautics)
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:35:23 ah here
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:35:36 The SR-71 is the perfect example of chines
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:36:43 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:37:23 Let me grab my plane that has chines

plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:37:52 Here is my plane with chines
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:38:35 Okay why did 48 of you people upvote this simple plane
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:40:30 The plane is a knife
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:40:45 All I did was to motor lock part of the nose
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:40:49 And move it .5 studs back
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:42:27 <@!429826358827417601> Here's a screenshot of my newer fifth generation fighter
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:42:47 This is my solution, pretty simple but I feel like it's inefficient
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:42:54 To use two separate motor lock towers
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:43:16 And another one for the thrust vectored engines
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 05:43:36 Three motor lock towers, I should reduce that

plane-crazy 2020-10-22 08:24:09 Only fabric, landing gear and wheels

plane-crazy 2020-10-22 08:25:31 Then they die
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 08:26:31 Give me ideas for planes, apart from one or two thrust vectoring nozzles
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 08:26:48 Speaking of planes
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 08:26:57 rick pls let us add more than one keybind
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 08:27:29 Motors and engines
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 08:28:23 Yeah that sounds reasonable
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 08:28:48 What if motor 2s locked when they're not moving as an option
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 08:29:00 Their bugginess is relied upon with motor 2 suspension
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 08:29:06 But otherwise, we'd prefer them to not spasm

plane-crazy 2020-10-22 08:29:20 like me
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 08:29:51 What else does improve a plane's performance
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 08:30:25 Yes, I do that often
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 08:30:51 Would it be worth it to add dedicated elevators or just use a canard-delta setup
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 08:31:44 I usually think they add drag but I could be wrong
general 2020-10-22 09:02:00 What if F-16XL + F16 VISTA
general 2020-10-22 09:03:11 Well I'm already making a delta + canard plane with a vectoring nozzle
general 2020-10-22 09:05:02 Well no
general 2020-10-22 09:07:27 I'm gonna add a vectored nozzle to an already manuverable plane

<@!626449107577471012> I used a conveyor drive as afterburner speed, it's stability during flight can be found in the way I designed it's wings
creations-chat 2020-10-22 22:51:59 If you want manuverability, consider using the minimal amount of wings possible while still being able to have to as level as a flight possible, use motor locking if needed, and of course use as much flaps or control surfaces as possible. Don't forget make the design simple to avoid physics throttling
creations-chat 2020-10-22 22:55:24 <@!487872003936878593> Honestly, just build things you like, and build it the way you want

general 2020-10-23 01:02:38 Cookie go coffin
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:03:29 If thrust is unequal on one side, guess what happens
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:10:34 Conveyor drive? Those things can either be unstable or stable
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:11:30 They work fine for me though, and in one plane, perfectly
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:16:40 If you can make a flight with conveyor drives be level and still be controllable, well that would be a big achievement

plane-crazy 2020-10-23 11:11:32 The Dassault Grurage
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 11:11:50 Gru's nose is aerodynamic enough
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 11:12:35 Gru has Flanker nose/F-15 nose
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 11:13:08 Step 1, make Sukhoi Flanker or F-15 nose
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 11:13:12 Step 2. Make dome

general 2020-10-23 11:23:34 The purpose of the Cobra is to make an enemy pilot overshoot, right?
general 2020-10-23 11:24:07 Well there's a reason why it's only been used in mock dogfights
general 2020-10-23 11:24:33 Looks cool, but why do you need it in combat?

general 2020-10-24 00:38:21 Perhaps Plane Crazy should add an autocannon of sorts? Probably slower than guns but packs a better punch
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 00:38:45 You're welcome

plane-crazy 2020-10-24 02:26:04 It was an attempt at a supersonic cobra
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 02:28:23 The Convair F-106 Delta Dart?
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 02:28:25 Why though?
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 02:29:50 I mean I already have this plane
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 02:30:10 This is where my main fighter was derived from, literally only adding canards and extending the body
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 02:31:14 I mean if it works, then it works
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 02:31:23 Could do better with the body of the aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 02:31:26 But it flies, and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 02:32:52 I balanced it

plane-crazy 2020-10-24 02:56:58 Now I want spicy cheeseburger
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 03:05:51 I'm gonna go make a rudderless jet
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 03:06:03 The intakes will be the vertical stabilizers
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 03:07:36 There are aircraft without vertical stabilizers, though most of them are 5th gen
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 03:09:14 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_X-44_MANTA

<@!715019067773157406>
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 03:09:28 See, no vertical stabilizers
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 03:10:35 "The X-36 possessed high maneuverability that would be ideal for use as a fighter. Despite its potential suitability, and highly successful test program, there have been no reports regarding further development of the X-36 or any derived design as of 2017."

oof
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 03:11:17 "The MANTA was designed to have reduced mechanical complexity, increased fuel efficiency and greater agility"

Another interesting thing
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 03:12:58 I think I'll design my rudderless aircraft similarly to the F-14 Tomcat and the Flanker family of fighters
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 03:15:45 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/F14_pancake.jpg yes something like this

plane-crazy 2020-10-24 03:26:41 yes, round
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 03:26:54 Same thing I do with exhaust can be applied to round noses
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 03:26:59 If only I could fill in the gap

plane-crazy 2020-10-24 10:53:05 Large gaps
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 10:53:10 Use control surfaces

general 2020-10-24 10:54:07 That's unhealthy

general 2020-10-24 10:54:27 Preferably fresh ingredients
general 2020-10-24 10:55:31 I've tasted soy milk before, which may or may not have flavoring as it tasted like chocolate for me
general 2020-10-24 10:56:11 I guess it has flavoring then
general 2020-10-24 10:56:54 I remember I may or may not have went to the bathroom shortly after, which usually doesn't happen when I drink regular milk/chocolate milk
general 2020-10-24 10:57:33 I hate that my brain imagined sudden explosion
general 2020-10-24 10:58:00 Lack of fluids or too much fluids?
general 2020-10-24 10:58:34 For the slimy part, I'm guessing it has a lot of liquid content in it
general 2020-10-24 10:58:52 For hot, well that's normal when your stomach does not like you
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 10:59:17 Well, that's a day to remember
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 10:59:23 I can't even build a mech
general 2020-10-24 10:59:54 I'm cringing so bad rn
general 2020-10-24 11:00:23 Understandable, you're lactose intolerant
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 11:00:45 Meanwhile I build planes
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 11:00:54 And sometimes land vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 11:01:02 But mostly planes
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 11:01:32 I just do plenty of thrust and only the necessary amount of wings
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 11:02:12 It's just something I do, I just experiment
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 12:30:49 <@!447221768520859659> I tried the custom nozzles

What does it mean when it keeps spasming
general 2020-10-25 01:51:47 How fast is 200 for a coach bus?
general 2020-10-25 01:52:19 Like compared to an actual coach bus irl
general 2020-10-25 01:56:00 Do what I do, motor lock engines
general 2020-10-25 01:56:33 Oh I thought you meant to add more engines
general 2020-10-25 01:57:05 It would've been fine they were canards
general 2020-10-25 01:57:10 But no
general 2020-10-25 01:57:51 I can't consider that to be a two main wings setup, because for that one there's one main wing above and below the aircraft
general 2020-10-25 01:58:14 Nor a biplane
general 2020-10-25 01:58:42 Ah tandem wing, that's what I was finding

general 2020-10-25 02:06:11 No
general 2020-10-25 02:06:26 Opa-Opa is from a fictional place, called the Fantasy Zone
general 2020-10-25 02:06:40 Fantasy Zone also being an arcade game made by Sega

general 2020-10-25 05:22:59 I have no idea what to build
general 2020-10-25 05:33:47 I used the custom nozzle to make this
general 2020-10-25 05:33:48 What am I doing

general 2020-10-25 05:49:47 I don't get propellers
general 2020-10-25 05:50:31 I'm concerned about you
general 2020-10-25 05:50:55 <@!546223347025969164> I mean you're not wrong
general 2020-10-25 05:51:26 Though I haven't met anyone who is an alcoholic
general 2020-10-25 05:51:38 Only times I've seen people consume alcohol is during occasions

general 2020-10-25 05:54:44 I remember that one time my dad filled a water container with fuel

*Guess what happened?*
general 2020-10-25 05:56:00 I mean meat is meat
general 2020-10-25 05:58:20 I wonder if there are any advantages to variable swept wings in this game
general 2020-10-25 05:59:39 <@!546223347025969164> So the only thing it's good for slowing down aircrat
general 2020-10-25 06:00:17 I'm honestly just thinking up of stuff to do
general 2020-10-25 06:03:28 I forgot I had this add-on
general 2020-10-25 06:08:02 It sucked
general 2020-10-25 06:08:17 Power was lacking for the role it was intended for
general 2020-10-25 06:09:57 I read it as Ember, because 3 is E in 1337
general 2020-10-25 06:13:49 Should I make this swivel with a motor 2?
general 2020-10-25 06:17:21 I usually go for a delta-canard configuration
general 2020-10-25 06:17:25 With a single rudder
general 2020-10-25 06:18:14 Wasn't there an FPS Unlocker for Roblox, and does it actually work?
general 2020-10-25 06:18:18 Because the throttling succs
general 2020-10-25 06:19:31 <@!163143541160148992> Well, what can it do for mid to low end PCs?

plane-crazy 2020-10-25 09:34:12 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QejHmtB6Kvs This gives me an idea of what next type of builds to do
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 09:34:15 Guns
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 09:34:21 Or other projectile launching devices
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 09:35:46 Yes but slowly
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 09:36:07 If it did it quick enough then I would've used it
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 10:02:51 3rd and 2nd generation jet fighter or guns and cannons?
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 10:04:17 That Owned looks like an Owo
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 10:04:21 ngl
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 10:18:25 Back to another session of watching Plane Crazy videos for motivation
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 10:20:08 And maybe picking up a thing or two about building
general 2020-10-25 10:22:07 Would it be a good idea to use FPS Unlockers to reduce lag
general 2020-10-25 10:23:42 Well can't do anything about it
general 2020-10-25 10:23:55 8 GB of RAM at least, could do worse
general 2020-10-25 10:24:12 Though I have an AMD A8-7600, a processor from 2014
general 2020-10-25 10:24:22 I might join you out of boredom

general 2020-10-25 10:25:59 I have the worst aim with planes
general 2020-10-25 10:26:11 Or maybe I'm so crippled by render distance
general 2020-10-25 10:28:04 Let me guess, a spy leaked all of his illegal activities
general 2020-10-25 10:28:22 Passport request, showing NSFW to minors, etc.
general 2020-10-25 10:28:31 And gore
general 2020-10-25 10:29:06 Well the third one wouldn't be *too* bad if it weren't for the fact that his audience are literal kids
general 2020-10-25 10:29:44 If the devs actually made an Among Us 2, and open-sourced the original
general 2020-10-25 10:29:49 What would that mean
general 2020-10-25 10:30:30 https://innersloth.itch.io/among-us/devlog/171026/among-us-2 If anyone doubts open-sourcing the original, here
general 2020-10-25 10:30:54 <@!714763671410180127> So he shames his own kind?

plane-crazy 2020-10-25 10:50:20 Wait it out for a day or two then check to see what score you've got
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 10:50:29 Then request for a Designer rank of that score
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 10:51:08 I mean the mods are busy at times
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 10:51:30 The benefits are access to the Discord's private servers and being able to flex on others
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 10:52:11 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 10:52:14 And with an expert rank

There's your experts, scroll down to see more experts
general 2020-10-25 12:43:39 How much drag do wings create in this game?
general 2020-10-25 12:44:11 So if I want speed or manuverability, minimize the wings used?
general 2020-10-25 12:44:27 Because that's honestly what I've been doing
general 2020-10-25 12:45:56 Tbh I was thinking of a carrier based fighter with variable sweep wings
general 2020-10-25 12:46:31 Like in the F-111, F-14, Su-24, etc.
general 2020-10-25 12:47:13 Gotta find a way to make seamless yet thin variable sweep wings
general 2020-10-25 12:47:47 Unless there are better ways of reducing space usage on fighters
general 2020-10-25 12:48:49 I could fold the wings, I forgot
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 12:50:22 Which looks nicer, variable sweep wings or folding wings
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 13:10:12 Well, I'll go with the F-14's solution then
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 13:10:18 Which is to oversweep the wings
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 13:10:40 That's if I could neatly integrate it though
general 2020-10-25 13:26:15 I came to the chat
I saw unironic use of caps lock
I go why?
general 2020-10-25 13:27:19 BeamNG in Roblox
I'd play that
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 13:55:31 > The current state of pvp is that you would just get a jet at 800 speed and just Cas spam the living fuck out of them
<@!730808827234091041> So get a really fast plane and spam Close Air Support the heck out of them
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 13:56:16 I usually avoid treads
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 13:56:23 Too buggy for not much
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 13:57:18 This is what I did
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 13:58:45 How good is a swiveling gun on a plane
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 13:59:41 Do what I do, a swiveling gun on a plane
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 13:59:45 So you can have more fine aim
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 14:00:14 Honestly my render distance sucks
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 14:01:03 I'm both lagging and having bad render distance
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 14:01:28 Mine's decent
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 14:01:40 But low render s u c c s
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 14:02:31 I have two planes that have 517 and 532 blocks respectively, no weapons yet
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 14:02:50 Meanwhile my current plane has 630 blocks including weapons
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 14:03:06 602 without
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 14:04:13 Are there people in VIP1?
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 14:04:33 oh good I can go honk honk in public transport
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 14:05:28 Oof, PC has 29K dislikes
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 14:05:37 But that's fine, it has 115K likes
general 2020-10-26 06:19:57 Should I be worried some kids are RPing their own version of FNaF but edgier and with superpowers on a PC server
general 2020-10-26 06:20:12 "dark wolf"
"dark fox"
general 2020-10-26 06:20:22 I've been through that phase

*I cringe*
general 2020-10-26 06:20:37 Glad I got out of that then
general 2020-10-26 06:22:07 Their "dark crate pizza" looks more like burnt pizza
general 2020-10-26 06:22:17 But somehow the sauce survived
general 2020-10-26 06:25:07 Wait yousuf left?

general 2020-10-26 06:30:02 But 13 Mirage 2000s
general 2020-10-26 06:30:26 I'm gonna watch how to do the back of 3rd gen fighters
general 2020-10-26 06:31:28 Rotat e flat wedges to make longer wedge
general 2020-10-26 06:32:25 What the fuck
general 2020-10-26 06:32:52 Back to making a carrier based fighter
general 2020-10-26 06:45:17 I don't get how you people motor lock blocks into other blocks without them spasming
general 2020-10-26 06:46:24 I'm probably doing something wrong here
general 2020-10-26 06:52:20 > pcc wards away the furry syndrome

general 2020-10-26 06:53:21 I'm just here to do stupid crap

<@!163143541160148992> I mean there's already a TED video about that
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 08:04:42 I'll just trust their words as fact or at least a believable opinion
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 08:05:09 Also, yes I agree with you with that so we wouldn't get lagged
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 08:06:44 Plane Crazy

general 2020-10-26 09:59:35 Some kid named yrytuhtu trying to copy me
general 2020-10-26 09:59:54 First of all, what kind of username is that

general 2020-10-26 10:23:11 <@!287779983445721088> I got an expert rank from a blocky yet humungous plane
general 2020-10-26 10:24:21 Seriously the standards to get expert rank is low https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/737219878666371152
general 2020-10-26 10:24:44 But to get into HoF, now that's a sudden jump
general 2020-10-26 10:25:25 I'm gonna give up rotating half blocks to make longer wedges
general 2020-10-26 10:25:31 Too spasmy for dumb potato brain
general 2020-10-26 10:25:49 Streaky hull
general 2020-10-26 10:26:05 I'm never gonna finish making fighter jets
general 2020-10-26 10:27:09 welp, back to Ren's tutorial
general 2020-10-26 10:27:10 For I am lost
general 2020-10-26 10:28:17 Was that seriously the problem?
general 2020-10-26 10:28:23 It was because it was outside?
general 2020-10-26 10:37:11 It's 6:37 PM over here
general 2020-10-26 10:37:22 Also, that plane is long
general 2020-10-26 10:38:05 Well, apparently my only alternative to TNT is disconnectors
general 2020-10-26 10:41:56 Well nvm
general 2020-10-26 10:43:33 Do I really have to use explosives?
general 2020-10-26 10:44:35 Honestly, cylinders do the same thing that wing panels do for me
general 2020-10-26 10:47:08 I've done motor locking a bunch of times
general 2020-10-26 10:47:29 But never done it with rotating motors
general 2020-10-26 10:48:25 Tbh I'm fine, I usually go on Non-PvP also so I'll just make due with wedges
general 2020-10-26 11:00:16 The F-8 has variable camber wings
general 2020-10-26 11:01:03 No wait variable incidence wings
general 2020-10-26 11:26:14 I regret going onto PvP
general 2020-10-26 11:26:21 "haha loser"
general 2020-10-26 11:26:32 Then I see what is essentially only wings
general 2020-10-26 11:27:11 "I am speed"
Yeah I think I got a glimpse the pain you guys experience
general 2020-10-26 11:27:24 If only I had good render distance without sacrificing too much FPS
general 2020-10-26 11:27:48 Also, denial of using shredders sounds normal from what I've heard
general 2020-10-26 11:31:01 <@!720024036863901717> I'm guessing you have a high-end gaming PC from 2013
general 2020-10-26 11:31:21 Meanwhile I'm on a mid-low end PC with a 2014 CPU
general 2020-10-26 11:31:42 8 GB, AMD A8-7600 with an HD6670
general 2020-10-26 11:31:55 So it's somewhere between low-mid end
general 2020-10-26 11:32:47 The things I dislike about Apple is that it's completely closed off and that it's really trying to trap you into it's ecosystem
general 2020-10-26 11:33:14 And if you're a developer, isn't it so sudden that they just moved from x86 to ARM?
general 2020-10-26 11:33:43 At least Microsoft had no problem with modifications to Windows itself
general 2020-10-26 11:34:26 And MacOS literally is just unmodifiable Linux
general 2020-10-26 11:35:57 Though Apple devices do have that user experience and taking advantage of privacy
general 2020-10-26 11:37:18 You could go ask, or trace back what you think could've caused it
general 2020-10-26 11:37:40 Understandable, to each to their own
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 11:39:01 > but my su-57 can do cobra
<@!433617207734304778> Would you believe me if I said I couldn't do a cobra without a conveyor drive?
general 2020-10-26 11:39:31 Portable consoles
general 2020-10-26 11:39:38 Like the PSP and the Game Boy
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 11:40:00 Doing it without them is hard for me
general 2020-10-26 11:41:26 <@!536013994188865554> Honestly you could just emulate on desktop, and if you're lazy like me you can just do RetroArch
general 2020-10-26 11:42:29 Kega Fusion is nice for emulating Sega consoles
general 2020-10-26 11:42:37 Well, up to the 32X/CD anyways
general 2020-10-26 11:42:42 Can't do Saturn and above
general 2020-10-26 11:43:09 A shrapnel
general 2020-10-26 11:43:31 No wait, napalm
general 2020-10-26 11:44:04 <@!536013994188865554> How does nulldc run for you?
general 2020-10-26 11:44:12 And Dolphin, if you're into Gamecube and Wii games
general 2020-10-26 11:45:00 To be fair, the Saturn I heard was a mess
general 2020-10-26 11:46:23 <@!536013994188865554> Apparently the Saturn has 8 processors
general 2020-10-26 11:46:54 That sounds a lot like a mess to me
general 2020-10-26 11:50:40 It had two GPU chips (labelled as Video Display Processors), two Hitachi SH-2 that only had 4 KB of cache memory and two chips for sound, one for controlling and one for processing

Now I can see why it's a mess
general 2020-10-26 11:51:05 And a dedicated Hitachi SH-1 for the CD drive
general 2020-10-26 11:51:40 Now I can see why not only was it a complex console to develop for, but for emulation is also slow
general 2020-10-26 11:52:30 Too much stuff going on
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 11:53:13 Use a vertical motor to make variable sweep wings
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 11:54:00 I wonder how this'll work out in PC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_wing
general 2020-10-26 11:54:38 They really screwed themselves for making the console too complex
general 2020-10-26 11:55:17 Meanwhile newer consoles are much simpler
general 2020-10-26 11:55:42 The Switch relies on an Nvidia Tegra while the Xbox and PlayStation rely on a modified AMD A-Series
general 2020-10-26 11:56:01 A low to mid-end CPU with better than Intel integrated graphics
the-dump 2020-10-26 12:08:14 Uhh, gator https://twitter.com/GatorsDaily/status/1320512950654980096?s=19

plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:11:44 If planes doing nose dives is a way of doing 0G, then in Plane Crazy it would be a way to become a projectile
general 2020-10-26 12:12:45 Well let's hope there's an achievement for that
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:13:40 I'm happy I can *study* what people do to make their builds work
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:14:12 <@739469014224470087> Symmetric delivery of power is important
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:14:25 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:14:33 You are an expert shipwreck
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:14:42 I am expert flying brick engineer
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:16:19 Has there been already a suggestion where there's an option to make Motor 2s lock when not in use (specifically without retracting like normal locked motors)
general 2020-10-26 12:16:38 Do 24 hours
general 2020-10-26 12:16:46 Heck do 48 if you're up to it
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:17:31 Contra-rotating rotors with tail rotor
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:18:06 Yes, yaw
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:18:20 The one thing that I don't do on planes
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:18:52 Pretty much seen doing pitch and roll only
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:19:44 I just integrate vertical stabilizers wherever I could, usually intakes
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:19:52 If I'm not adding one
general 2020-10-26 12:20:26 Goldbux
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:21:37 How about stable flight even with a conveyor drive?
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:21:46 And even if you're pitching or rolling?
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:21:59 I did
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:22:12 Only makes the controls more sensitive but otherwise it's fine
general 2020-10-26 12:31:23 Minecrafr

general 2020-10-26 23:47:08 Left gear
general 2020-10-26 23:47:28 What pointless argument is this chat having again
general 2020-10-26 23:48:15 Obc trying to be German
general 2020-10-26 23:48:57 I wonder how a microwaved cookie tastes, like that's an actual question
general 2020-10-26 23:49:20 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
general 2020-10-26 23:49:34 There is an impostor among us
general 2020-10-26 23:49:54 Salmon kinda sus
general 2020-10-26 23:51:01 Gun go locc
general 2020-10-26 23:51:38 All I did is a swiveling twin gun setup
general 2020-10-26 23:51:48 Because you are the 9th cookie
general 2020-10-26 23:52:07 That's a role?
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 23:54:27 Did you damage your phone?
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 23:55:23 
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 23:55:28 I found this recently
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 23:56:08 One of the two new phones costs like a hundred bucks or something
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 23:56:56 Or you could get a used phone
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 23:59:30 Honestly, the new phone is at least much cheaper than most phones
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 00:00:15 Well, most new phones
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 00:01:01 The ultra budget one though is a significant downgrade
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 00:01:23 Snapdragon 4x, 4 GB RAM, 64 GB of expandable storage
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 00:01:52 Which is lower compared to the Snapdragon 7x featured in the full OnePlus Nord
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 00:02:17 O h
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 00:02:36 So that's how low you have
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 00:03:06 Tell them with that money you're only gonna get fragile useless garbage
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 00:03:17 I know that from experience
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 00:03:33 Build quality, you better handle it like a baby
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 00:03:57 Specs, mileage varies
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 00:05:05 <@456226577798135808> Honestly I feel like that Nokia with KaiOS would at least work
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 00:05:20 That cheap garbage is just crap
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 00:06:34 <@456226577798135808> Tell them that they have no right to tell you what to buy coming from tech illiterate people
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 00:06:47 There's even a slur for that apparently
general 2020-10-27 00:14:38 Discord Light Mode:
general 2020-10-27 00:16:15 This is what I imagine is going on in undes' heads when they try to make a DJ boothmobile
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 00:22:08 Ropestorm
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 01:29:35 Wing design?
general 2020-10-27 02:30:04 Well, your computer died
general 2020-10-27 02:31:07 Clean them ffs
general 2020-10-27 02:31:24 If I can manually brush them off then so can you
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:01:13 I'm in pain
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:01:20 I'm with someone who roleplays as a god
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:01:30 And the classic free candy
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:02:50 I mean you can get aero engineer and VTOL rank at the same time
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:09:43 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:09:53 F for the mods
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:10:05 I'm just too lazy
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:12:34 Let me rephrase that
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:12:48 Am I lucky for having not met or not met much asshole mods then?
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:14:08 goodbye
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:20:34 I'm watching a metal pterodactyl and a bee fight
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:20:42 Both powered by helium
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:29:29 
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:29:29 
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:29:41 Got the basics done
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:29:56 Time for appearance stuff
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:04:04 piston engine
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:04:10 Well I wanna build a piston engine
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:08:41 I should try making an engine
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:08:53 Or making the XB-70 Valkyrie
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:09:02 Because speed
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:09:22 That I'm busy with online classes
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:09:42 And wouldn't wanna give away I'm listening to music
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:10:17 Motor locks are indeed useful
general 2020-10-27 05:10:57 How would you feel if I made the XB-70's be variable sweep horizontally instead of vertically
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:13:41 How would you people feel if I did variable sweep wing tips instead of folding wing tips on the XB-70

general 2020-10-27 05:32:53 <@!656137684213039124> Remind me the specs of your PC again
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:34:36 2 wide sounds tiny
general 2020-10-27 05:35:34 <@!656137684213039124> There are Linux distributions lighter than Windows 10
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:36:00 3 blocks if fine for me, if the sides have half wedges
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:36:13 Oh, is that what you meant by 2 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:36:40 That's tiny for me, not worth it
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:37:39 yes, but I'm already content with the size I have
general 2020-10-27 05:41:43 trippy
general 2020-10-27 08:29:02 Does this look painfully awkward?
general 2020-10-27 08:29:08 sock lizard is good lizard
general 2020-10-27 08:29:18 I knew something looked off
general 2020-10-27 08:30:21 well at least it's pretty spacious here
general 2020-10-27 08:31:49 I'll just shelve the low floor bus then
general 2020-10-27 08:31:52 Too awkward
general 2020-10-27 08:32:14 I'll just continue when I can think up of a better design
general 2020-10-27 08:34:51 I'll just go search up some supersonic bombers like the Valkyrie, Blackbird and whatever Avro made
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 08:38:18 Give me design principles supersonic bombers and recon aircraft have
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 09:23:25 The only reason rick added this hill was to add a ramp
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 09:24:02 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 09:24:17 But a ramp is a ramp
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 09:25:06 <@!660019099430289418> As for actual use case, I'm not so sure who'd use that but it's a bit of an oddly specific shape isn't it?
general 2020-10-27 12:49:08 If fries were made in Belgium, then why are they called French Fries?
general 2020-10-27 12:50:01 When I think of good chocolate, I think of anything that has to do with Europe
general 2020-10-27 12:50:07 Behind that is America
general 2020-10-27 12:50:54 <@456226577798135808> To be fair I've only consumed mass produced chocolates
I like chocolates coming from Europe and Australia (as a continent, that includes NZ)
general 2020-10-27 12:51:48 "making carrots orange"
general 2020-10-27 12:51:55 Are you implying that carrots were not orange before?
general 2020-10-27 12:52:10 <@!451025784228806656> Beheadings?
general 2020-10-27 12:52:19 Because that sounds a lot like France
general 2020-10-27 12:54:50 I think of waffles and fries with Belgium
general 2020-10-27 12:55:27 Though I only associate fries with Belgium when reminded
general 2020-10-27 12:55:41 Otherwise, I have the mindset of "fries is fries"
general 2020-10-27 12:56:12 If food good, then I eat food
general 2020-10-27 12:56:16 If it's healthy and good
general 2020-10-27 12:56:21 Then I definitely eat
general 2020-10-27 12:56:32 Ngl I've ate some good hospital food
general 2020-10-27 12:56:42 Like actual meals
general 2020-10-27 12:57:13 <@!451025784228806656> I dunno, but the hospital I was in had good food served to me
general 2020-10-27 12:57:28 Mine was a variety
general 2020-10-27 12:57:38 Tasted like actual meals from home
general 2020-10-27 12:57:44 good seafood
general 2020-10-27 12:57:47 good chiccen and other meats
general 2020-10-27 12:57:56 has the herbs and spices and whatnots
general 2020-10-27 12:58:14 basically, actual cooking
general 2020-10-27 12:58:18 time for dinner
general 2020-10-27 12:58:35 <@!448505589983739914> Not really, just a normal private hospital
general 2020-10-27 12:58:38 I'm from the Philippines
general 2020-10-28 00:12:03 What if Big Chungus but it's fungus
general 2020-10-28 00:14:09 Should I make a Rickroll QR code
general 2020-10-28 00:14:29 And let unsuspecting victims scan it
general 2020-10-28 00:16:10 The day obc became bunny
general 2020-10-28 00:16:19 And became food
general 2020-10-28 00:16:23 When?
general 2020-10-28 01:23:42 Noob got salty after I made him got stuck for invading my plot space
general 2020-10-28 01:23:59 Remember kids, the plots of others aren't your parking lot
general 2020-10-28 01:24:57 Ew I got caught by a free candy van
general 2020-10-28 01:25:31 <@456226577798135808> It only had the shape of a car, but doesn't look like a car
general 2020-10-28 01:26:06 This is the piece of shit that caught me while AFK
general 2020-10-28 01:26:24 Barely looks like a car
general 2020-10-28 01:26:43 I think an unde is trying to report you
general 2020-10-28 01:26:58 Nevermind, he really is an unde
general 2020-10-28 01:28:40 Only verified, no other ranks
Gives off a childish vibe
Copycat
Speeleeng go bonkk
general 2020-10-28 01:30:00 Kookie, they don't have any *roles* apart from verified
general 2020-10-28 01:30:20 Like surely you'd know how to get a role
general 2020-10-28 01:30:46 I'm probably just tired of undes being a bit of an arse
general 2020-10-28 01:30:54 Or being cringe
general 2020-10-28 01:31:28 Going onto public PvP was a mistake I now know
general 2020-10-28 01:32:17 <@!656137684213039124> Java's nice for modding, and OG redstone
general 2020-10-28 01:32:32 Also it's datapacks and scripting
general 2020-10-28 01:33:47 <@!645128367611445248> yes
general 2020-10-28 01:34:48 Why is big chungus having a chicken spasm
general 2020-10-28 01:36:14 You know a good thing with contests

You get to observe the building methods other people use
general 2020-10-28 03:15:16 That's cursed pizza

general 2020-10-28 08:15:31 Why yes
general 2020-10-28 08:15:56 Springs still are a bit problematic for me when I fill the space TNT used to consume

general 2020-10-28 08:23:37 Actually wait
general 2020-10-28 08:23:48 That sounds like a decent opportunity to flex and vote farm
general 2020-10-28 08:24:04 Do not leave car
general 2020-10-28 08:24:12 You have more rallies to attend
general 2020-10-28 08:24:29 Fish to blob blob blob

general 2020-10-28 08:24:45 Nein
general 2020-10-28 08:24:47 No
general 2020-10-28 08:24:55 No buenos
general 2020-10-28 08:25:37 Once eryay returns, let's call them 69er just to mess with them
general 2020-10-28 08:26:13 I have been befriended by le Blob
general 2020-10-28 08:26:32 I'm lazy

general 2020-10-30 01:15:18 yes, *all*
general 2020-10-30 02:41:06 Rick said the game's hardcoded
general 2020-10-30 02:41:15 Which means it's hard to change something without screwing up something else
general 2020-10-30 02:41:40 Also, you do realize he's a one man team
general 2020-10-30 02:43:13 I prefer waiting for softcode first, so we could easily receive new content quicker
general 2020-10-30 02:55:25 It's the Helium Rangers
general 2020-10-30 02:55:44 Literally all four of them are just basic helium mechs
general 2020-10-30 02:57:29 None
general 2020-10-30 02:58:21 Not really interested in a non-working microscopic canopy either
general 2020-10-30 02:59:26 Personally, I find tiny canopies unappealing both in design and in function served
general 2020-10-30 03:00:05 So yeah, if I wanted a fat ass canopy I would've made it whole blocks
general 2020-10-30 03:01:16 Still better than a micro-canopy
general 2020-10-30 03:02:02 Any smaller and I'd rather not place a canopy at all
general 2020-10-30 03:03:03 > a motor can be modern art
<@!251880826386513924> A motor represents humanity's tendency to keep moving forward, but occasionally their desire go backward
general 2020-10-30 03:04:21 > indonesia blocks everything
<@!582834773773254656> Sounds like The Great Firewall of China
general 2020-10-30 03:07:32 Mortal Kombat is indeed brutal, but still if people wanna play it then let them play
general 2020-10-30 03:08:34 The nation run by Karens apparently
general 2020-10-30 03:14:10 How did I not notice that
general 2020-10-30 03:15:48 dog clown
general 2020-10-30 03:16:20 So if there's anything I learned from this
general 2020-10-30 03:16:25 Stay away from the Middle East
general 2020-10-30 03:19:20 there is an ugly shredder
general 2020-10-30 03:19:25 with a spinning tip
general 2020-10-30 03:19:46 It's trying so hard to get in the blacklist box
general 2020-10-30 03:23:33 I left the shredder noobs
general 2020-10-30 03:23:43 Apparently there's a whole group of shredder users
general 2020-10-30 03:25:46 ye be a pirate

<@!645128367611445248> *If only there was a mode where you can't PvP*
general 2020-10-30 06:14:45 Either it's stronk
general 2020-10-30 06:14:52 Or because supersonic propeller plane
general 2020-10-30 06:15:53 > 2 conveyor engines and get speeds up to 2000
<@!645128367611445248> I can get 10k from one
general 2020-10-30 06:16:26 I'm also using a basic one, literally just a piston and conveyor with blocks on top
general 2020-10-30 06:16:37 Yet it achieves 10k
general 2020-10-30 06:16:52 I also don't use more wings, I use more control surfaces
general 2020-10-30 06:17:11 Is it good or bad if a plane pitches too shaprly?
general 2020-10-30 06:17:59 Like loses all speed if I continue to hold the key I assign to pitch up
general 2020-10-30 06:18:26 From how quick it pitches
general 2020-10-30 10:24:46 Nobody
general 2020-10-30 10:24:59 Lawnmower shredders won't work anyways, nor ramming
general 2020-10-30 10:25:42 <@!645128367611445248> Okay, you do have a point
general 2020-10-30 10:26:10 But within normal gameplay, cutters are either overpowered flight attacks or useless ground ramming
general 2020-10-30 10:29:01 Imagine if they disintegrate when reaching a certain speed in public
general 2020-10-30 10:29:23 make them private only in function
general 2020-10-30 10:29:44 fast shredders begone
general 2020-10-30 10:31:47 What if I combine Typoon and Flanker
general 2020-10-30 10:32:41 You can
general 2020-10-30 10:32:52 Just don't do the plus sign with hooks
general 2020-10-30 10:35:28 You are now being terrorized with the big naughty
general 2020-10-30 10:36:01 And I'm just here trying to understand what kind of bs you people are doing
general 2020-10-30 10:36:40 I have no idea what's the context behind this anymore
general 2020-10-30 10:37:38 Because you have WiFi hogs
general 2020-10-30 10:37:43 Kicc siblings
general 2020-10-30 10:37:45 Problem solved
general 2020-10-30 10:38:17 Looks like normal PvP
general 2020-10-30 10:40:26 Now add cutters in front
general 2020-10-30 10:42:26 Think up of something cursed, and try to build it
Now spawn it in Public PvP
general 2020-10-30 10:42:32 Prepare to ruin everyone else's day
general 2020-10-30 10:42:39 And be the target of many
general 2020-10-30 10:43:31 10k sps plane then
general 2020-10-30 10:44:19 Still fun though, and I'm guessing at this point most people have achieved 1 to 2k anyways
general 2020-10-30 10:44:31 It's also pretty controllable, if pitch sensitive is your thing
general 2020-10-30 10:49:10 Is there something wrong with this too cranked of an arrow wing
general 2020-10-30 10:50:22 I'll go use it as an excuse to not make my wing flaps bigger then
general 2020-10-30 10:53:06 >im gonna have a heart attack
>*grab a gun and shoot my head

Roblox roleplayers surely are weird
general 2020-10-30 10:55:36 Then proceeds to say it got deleted before it hit his head
general 2020-10-30 10:55:49 They sure do make great storylines for cringelord teens
general 2020-10-30 10:56:55 I'm an idiot
general 2020-10-30 10:57:24 I decided to spread the flaps further out
general 2020-10-30 10:57:35 Including the canards
general 2020-10-30 10:58:49 Something tells me this is bad taken out of context
general 2020-10-30 11:01:04 All I do is just do whatever works, and partially follow the KISS principle
general 2020-10-30 11:01:40 I swear I'm making things get taken ooc too easily
general 2020-10-30 11:03:33 The iPhone 12 is just another overpriced piece of slab that traps you into Apple
general 2020-10-30 11:03:43 Ice
general 2020-10-30 11:03:45 It's always ice
general 2020-10-30 11:03:50 If you want it to be slippery
general 2020-10-30 11:04:14 Headphone ore
general 2020-10-30 11:04:19 Make that a Minecraft mod
general 2020-10-30 11:05:31 "Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler"
This is a good principle when making stuff in-game
general 2020-10-30 11:06:18 <@!536013994188865554> Up to you, though it's related to After Burner
general 2020-10-30 11:07:29 That car looks like one of those noob grabbing mobiles
general 2020-10-30 11:08:04 That car is just a worse version of free candy vans
general 2020-10-30 11:08:52 Phyiscs throttling and FPS drops are scarier
general 2020-10-30 11:09:41 I'm too lazy to continue my plane
general 2020-10-30 11:09:47 I'll just drive around in an ugly bus
general 2020-10-30 11:11:27 hm yes not pretty
general 2020-10-30 11:11:32 Oh nice, you got gamer permissions back
general 2020-10-30 11:11:34 oof
general 2020-10-30 11:13:11 yes
general 2020-10-30 11:13:18 I'm used to doing those kind of headlights
general 2020-10-30 11:14:45 At least has barebones suspension
general 2020-10-30 11:15:00 So nothing chnaged
general 2020-10-30 11:15:03 Just more riscc
general 2020-10-30 11:15:41 see, barebones suspension
general 2020-10-30 11:15:48 spring at bacc, solid axle in front
general 2020-10-30 11:16:09 I didn't even take this build seriously tbh
general 2020-10-30 11:16:23 Just slap on whatever works good enough and you got a low floor bus thing
general 2020-10-30 11:16:35 bus go angery
general 2020-10-30 11:16:42 it will send you to the abyss and lava pits
general 2020-10-30 11:18:13 Tsunami Dating Simulator
general 2020-10-30 11:21:32 Maybe some copyrights issue?
general 2020-10-30 11:22:44 Purchase jetpack
general 2020-10-30 11:24:58 Perhaps, maybe NASCAR also?
general 2020-10-30 11:26:09 "To keep costs lower, Sega decided not to negotiate with NASCAR for a license, and therefore the game did not contain actual sponsors, drivers, nor cars."

NASCAR inspired, but not NASCAR
general 2020-10-30 11:26:19 So I guess rights to use the Daytona name then
general 2020-10-30 11:26:43 <@!536013994188865554> Closest I could think of atm is Virtua Racing
general 2020-10-30 11:42:40 I see unde
general 2020-10-30 11:43:00 with one of those flat floor only "cars"
general 2020-10-30 11:43:05 except it's no-no part
general 2020-10-30 11:43:52 I have concluded that there is no difference between PvP and Non-PvP
general 2020-10-30 11:50:46 I'm cringing that said person considers it public transport
general 2020-10-30 11:51:11 Nobody wants to ride something microscopic
general 2020-10-30 11:51:15 And so ugly
general 2020-10-30 11:52:18 He's gone
general 2020-10-30 11:53:53 Looks about what I expected with limited space
general 2020-10-30 11:54:45 But it does have those anhedral wings
general 2020-10-30 11:55:08 I don't even bother to add effort for landing gear
general 2020-10-30 11:55:13 Pistons too buggy
general 2020-10-30 11:55:23 And custom landing gear too fat
general 2020-10-30 11:56:05 F-104
general 2020-10-30 11:56:28 Succy
general 2020-10-30 11:56:32 Literally
general 2020-10-30 11:56:36 Look at those intakes
general 2020-10-30 11:56:51 Why are you on Arabic Wikipedia
general 2020-10-30 11:57:14 That looks like Firefox
general 2020-10-30 11:57:19 But on Windows 7
general 2020-10-30 11:57:50 Chrome poob
general 2020-10-30 11:58:02 Use actual Linux instead of Browser Linux
general 2020-10-30 11:58:16 Mario Browser is the best browser
general 2020-10-30 11:58:27 Imagine using bloated glass
general 2020-10-30 11:59:17 **Abandon window

https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.10/
general 2020-10-30 11:59:44 Are those actual browsers?
general 2020-10-30 11:59:59 Sounds like illegal content ngl
general 2020-10-30 12:00:10 Nintendo not happ- wat
general 2020-10-30 12:00:24 It's in a CD sleeve
general 2020-10-30 12:00:28 Is that from the 2000s?
general 2020-10-30 12:00:41 Knew it, 90s usually have big boxes
general 2020-10-30 12:00:51 And has that form of effort
general 2020-10-30 12:00:59 2000s is weird
general 2020-10-30 12:01:45 I think I see some actually good builds on public
general 2020-10-30 12:02:05 A closer look reveals yes
general 2020-10-30 12:03:38 Another build, well I'm impressed
general 2020-10-30 12:09:38 ***help im being terrorized***
general 2020-10-30 12:09:50 well at least it's an effective lag machine
general 2020-10-30 12:09:58 most of the time what I've seen fails
general 2020-10-30 12:14:11 The lag is so bad
general 2020-10-30 12:14:18 I just wanna see pretty dragon
general 2020-10-31 01:23:33 On a scale of 1-10, how much does this blue plane bother you
general 2020-10-31 01:23:56 Look at those wings, is that a canard or is that a main wing
general 2020-10-31 01:24:59 Probably is
general 2020-10-31 01:25:30 Simple, throw your phone
general 2020-10-31 01:25:33 Now everything dies
general 2020-10-31 01:27:02 And now he's using one of those basic trucks
general 2020-10-31 01:28:00 Box cab, no suspension but at least has a fifth wheel
general 2020-10-31 01:44:01 And now being copied by a noob called iatesomanyhakdogs
general 2020-10-31 01:45:04 A bit too sus to be using similar colors and a similar canopy
general 2020-10-31 01:45:10 Except fatter due to the use of whole blocks
general 2020-10-31 01:49:10 I'm busy doing what I usually do, aircraft
general 2020-10-31 01:51:38 I wanna see this unfold

general 2020-10-31 01:53:09 I'm just building a plane
general 2020-10-31 01:53:50 Can't screenshot it now because incomplete motor lock
general 2020-10-31 01:54:38 I gave up on actually basing my builds on irl planes

general 2020-10-31 02:12:38 Honestly, you're just spamming the chat
general 2020-10-31 02:13:20 Juan was enough of a reason to make me actually want the chat to die
general 2020-10-31 02:14:18 There's a part of me that wants to question this Juan guy's age
general 2020-10-31 02:15:35 Can you please just shut, nobody casually talks in meme
general 2020-10-31 02:15:56 yes
general 2020-10-31 02:16:00 i am scalie
general 2020-10-31 02:25:15 Or not II B
general 2020-10-31 02:32:06 Is it me or when I see someone unironically use bro, it's usually a clingy unde
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 02:59:27 Honestly I don't even care what I'm building
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 02:59:41 I just want a really manueverable and agile plane
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 03:01:00 I just find the delta canard setup to be optimal
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 03:01:29 I could do twin fin but I want roll
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 03:18:17 <@456226577798135808> I upvoted, enjoy
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 03:18:46 <@456226577798135808> Very much oblivious of the fact that there's a Discord
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 03:18:54 And could easily confirm it from there
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 03:27:47 
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 03:27:48 
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 03:27:48 
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 03:27:51 This good or bad?
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 03:28:05 Trying to keep the design function wise simple
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 03:28:10 But not compromise on looks nor performance
A design principle I partially tried to apply was "Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler" (a variant of the KISS principle)
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 03:29:11 Without engines, has a block count of 474, with engines 507
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 03:29:23 <@456226577798135808> They're even easier than motor locking
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 06:52:37 Apparently parachutes freak out when it's lagging
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 06:52:44 Aka, recording
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 06:54:05 Well at least I know drogue parachutes work effectively enough
general 2020-10-31 07:30:13 Tell me, does BBQ sauce or ketchup belong on pizza?
general 2020-10-31 07:30:19 Because I don't think they do
general 2020-10-31 07:33:18 Tbh, I don't think ketchup belongs on pizza because the sauce is already there
general 2020-10-31 07:33:29 You're just gonna drown the pizza in a sauce that's already there
general 2020-10-31 07:33:37 But when there's not enough, understandable
general 2020-10-31 07:34:15 Changing the topic, here's a flying square
general 2020-10-31 07:34:46 Now that's my kind of pizza

general 2020-10-31 08:00:07 Give me an idea for a compact off-roading vehicle
general 2020-10-31 08:04:20 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTI5XL-k_1I I just saw this appear while I was searching for PC stuff
general 2020-10-31 08:04:39 Back to getting ideas
general 2020-10-31 08:07:34 That's a nice trucc
general 2020-10-31 08:07:45 Better than what I could do
general 2020-10-31 08:25:36 I think I'll just go make smol vehicle
general 2020-10-31 08:25:50 that might need loccing
general 2020-10-31 08:30:32 well im too bored
general 2020-10-31 08:30:56 fixes what
bot-central 2020-10-31 08:31:14 !servers
general 2020-10-31 11:36:27 I feel like there's no hope in promoting otherwise normal stuff in Roblox
general 2020-10-31 11:37:02 "Hide Your Screen From Parents"
general 2020-10-31 11:37:15 I mean, that's honestly pretty normal from what I've seen
general 2020-10-31 11:37:34 Some parents have harsher disapproval
general 2020-10-31 11:43:08 <@!387195148741771275> Still better than juan moment

general 2020-10-31 11:46:49 If you wanna see some juan moments
general 2020-10-31 11:47:02 Scroll up for more
general 2020-10-31 11:48:03 Also spammed the chat with an attempt of teaching WW2 with memes
general 2020-10-31 11:48:08 A *boring* attempt
general 2020-10-31 11:48:14 Which can be seen by scrolling up further
general 2020-10-31 11:49:26 Poop here, you have clothes right?
general 2020-10-31 11:49:36 Use clothes to hold it
general 2020-10-31 11:49:44 oh wait you're serious
general 2020-10-31 11:50:41 Anything where you end up throwing up is worse
general 2020-10-31 11:51:03 But doing both, intensely
general 2020-10-31 11:51:07 That's the worst fate
general 2020-10-31 11:51:42 It does, but let me show you a 1920s plane

general 2020-10-31 12:04:23 This is where the first ARM chip started from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Archimedes

general 2020-11-01 04:11:49 Is it me or are the F-18 wings the straightest I've ever seen
general 2020-11-01 04:13:35 On a supersonic jet fighter at least

general 2020-11-01 04:17:47 Well at least it's supersonic
general 2020-11-01 04:51:06 I feel like I'm running out of creativity
general 2020-11-01 04:51:09 And I'm bored
general 2020-11-01 04:54:04 <@!403843930543882241> There's two default resource packs

general 2020-11-01 10:09:47 It detaches only when you tell it too
general 2020-11-01 10:10:04 Well I dunno, some sort of latching mechanism
general 2020-11-01 10:11:47 Oh yeah, magnets
general 2020-11-01 10:11:54 I keep forgetting about them
general 2020-11-01 10:12:05 ~~Probably because of the lag~~

general 2020-11-01 11:49:15 So far added VTOL, thrust reversal, custom landing gear, pitot tube, drogue parachute, enter/exitable canopy
general 2020-11-01 11:49:18 What else am I missing
general 2020-11-01 11:59:38 <@!467765396108476426> The best insult is obviously to spam Polish cows

No matter how much we simplify our aircraft, he's still never gonna get to our level without some cheap hacks
general 2020-11-01 12:25:09 He'll never get features right no matter how much he copies, doubt he knows motor locking or effeciency

general 2020-11-01 12:27:12 o h
general 2020-11-01 12:27:16 that actually could work
general 2020-11-01 12:27:25 But I won't modify my designs just yet
general 2020-11-01 12:27:31 I'm content with anchor based delays

general 2020-11-01 12:29:38 People will do it until you make something original
general 2020-11-01 12:30:15 Sometimes I check <#384025409945337856> on what I could build
general 2020-11-01 12:30:26 Also wedges are your friend, your best friend
general 2020-11-01 12:31:10 Jets can be pog
general 2020-11-01 12:31:22 Boats are equally as built as planes
general 2020-11-01 12:31:38 So no point in calling boats pog when they're just as built as much
general 2020-11-01 12:31:56 Cars however, they're kinda built less than aircraft and ships
general 2020-11-01 12:32:13 <@!403843930543882241> A little braindead
general 2020-11-01 12:32:38 Honestly screw English, if I get my point across then that's good enough for me

general 2020-11-02 02:01:46 yes
general 2020-11-02 02:01:49 and no
general 2020-11-02 02:02:01 and maybe
general 2020-11-02 02:02:13 Basically, I have the sense of humor of an idiot
general 2020-11-02 02:02:48 Still doesn't change the fact <@!683825202609651832> took it too seriously
general 2020-11-02 04:13:09 Did you try to refresh?
general 2020-11-02 04:13:30 Must be that then, internet

general 2020-11-02 05:01:53 damn undes trying to justify being a copycat
general 2020-11-02 05:02:55 Some kid named justinplaysroblox864 trying to justify copying, he's the classic "Xbox cringe' type
general 2020-11-02 05:03:15 Yes
general 2020-11-02 05:03:26 Claims he's not a kid in spite of grammatical errors
general 2020-11-02 05:03:33 Threatens with "my dad is police in usa"
general 2020-11-02 05:04:10 The classic claims tutorial build is theirs
general 2020-11-02 05:04:25 Seriosuly, he didn't invent treads
general 2020-11-02 05:04:42 And his tank is shit
general 2020-11-02 05:04:54 No real anti-slippage system
general 2020-11-02 05:05:14 His only anti tread slip system is a half-arsed cylinder
general 2020-11-02 05:05:19 An eyesore
general 2020-11-02 05:05:41 Well at least it ain't random paint splash, but it's all beige (even the treads)
general 2020-11-02 05:06:11 Honestly that's the only good build he has, basic Prototrode tank treads

general 2020-11-02 05:47:41 <@!177743269105500160> Yes they are overbuilt

Too much F-22s, F-16s and A-10s
general 2020-11-02 05:47:57 I also don't like how most F-16s on public are straight wings
general 2020-11-02 05:48:07 They're not trapezoidal, they're delta
general 2020-11-02 05:48:28 <@!466793357318815744> If it's done right, then it deserves upvotes
general 2020-11-02 05:48:41 If it's just another overbuilt generic plane, well you're not gonna get much
general 2020-11-02 05:49:02 > <@!466793357318815744> not perfectly
<@!177743269105500160> Still, it's better than most
general 2020-11-02 05:50:33 Whenever I go build, I usually keep this principle in mind at least partially
"Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler"
general 2020-11-02 05:51:07 Avoid overcomplicating builds unless necessary

general 2020-11-02 05:59:45 <@!367108451198959619> My experience on furry Twitter makes that true

general 2020-11-02 06:00:15 Obese though, never seen anyone like that

<@!367108451198959619> eh, kinda doubt it if you're being serious. It usually goes downhill from there
general 2020-11-02 06:01:52 Like banning a fandom from my experience can be the downhill of something
general 2020-11-02 06:02:27 Anyways <#497142796961054721> is being the big stupid, I'll come back when there's braincells again

<@!177743269105500160> As actual advice, get your priorities straight and do some planning. Like what are you gonna need for this build? The scale? The amount of time you're gonna dedicate? Stuff like that

And remember to relax, there's no point in overworking yourself
general 2020-11-02 06:04:53 so ban anime?

plane-crazy 2020-11-05 01:21:17 I need to unfat it
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 01:22:06 Can't tell the difference from an F-35, which kinda looks a little chonky for me
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 01:22:38 Honestly I gave up on basing on irl planes, too much effort
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 01:23:19 Sounds like the US
general 2020-11-05 01:35:18 ~~I feel like the server should be slightly more aggressive in clarifying rank related questions, so we wouldn't get these kind of questions~~

general 2020-11-05 03:17:50 Windows and Bedrock has no difference
general 2020-11-05 03:18:54 I wonder when Mozilla finally finished their Servo browser engine
general 2020-11-05 03:19:09 finishes*
general 2020-11-05 03:23:54 <@656137684213039124> Here's two things I suggest you look toward to 

1.1.1.1. and Mozilla Firefox. Mozilla currently has a project named Servo, aimed at doing actual optimizations instead of limiting RAM
general 2020-11-05 03:24:12 It's not complete but they've implemented some features into Firefox
general 2020-11-05 03:24:40 Servo is also programmed in Rust
general 2020-11-05 03:25:30 A RAM limiter I doubt would be useful
general 2020-11-05 03:25:50 Browsers are already optimized as it is
general 2020-11-05 03:26:03 Let them manage RAM for you
general 2020-11-05 03:31:24 <@!656137684213039124> https://www.reddit.com/r/operabrowser/comments/gt2z0t/my_opera_gx_review/
general 2020-11-05 03:31:56 So, Opera GX when limiting resources basically freezes tabs
general 2020-11-05 03:32:04 And only loads them in when needed
general 2020-11-05 03:32:19 It also isn't as stable from what I read

general 2020-11-05 05:50:06 So have fun
general 2020-11-05 05:51:31 For a second I thought that was a dragon
general 2020-11-05 05:51:44 A dragon with a weird misfiguration
general 2020-11-05 05:52:14 What if **redstone**
general 2020-11-05 05:52:19 What if **slime block machines**
general 2020-11-05 05:56:56 So server is whitelist?

general 2020-11-05 06:35:59 This is from the Minecraft Wiki on Java 20w41infinity

general 2020-11-05 08:22:35 The red video land known for demonitization or maybe somewhere else
general 2020-11-05 10:23:51 Can anyone explain why the F-18's wings are straight compared to other jet fighters
general 2020-11-05 10:26:47 For a second I thought those were batteries
general 2020-11-05 10:28:27 <@!192861290677534722> Are you trying to make a deep learning bot
general 2020-11-05 10:28:45 Why on Roblox though
general 2020-11-05 10:29:14 Wait so does that mean you only know how to use Lua?
general 2020-11-05 10:30:17 Godot uses a scripting language similar to Python
general 2020-11-05 10:31:37 Tbh, what's the difference in using Roblox and another game engine?
general 2020-11-05 10:34:53 Do not fail at Brazil
general 2020-11-05 10:34:58 Or Brazil will fail you
general 2020-11-05 10:36:29 What happens if the F-16XL and F-16 VISTA combined
general 2020-11-05 10:36:43 And became a supermanuverable cranked arrow delta wing fighter
general 2020-11-05 10:38:20 Thrust vectored F-16XL
general 2020-11-05 10:38:47 The VISTA also has direct voice input and a virtual HUD
general 2020-11-05 10:40:05 Voice command plane
general 2020-11-05 10:40:15 Sounds like the Dassault Rafale
general 2020-11-05 10:40:50 F-16XL VISTA vs. Succhoi™️
general 2020-11-05 10:41:48 this server has a sukhoi aeromorph
general 2020-11-05 10:41:56 why does it exist
general 2020-11-05 10:44:44 What if you made a game out of this
general 2020-11-05 10:51:53 Pee in a bottle, at least we won't see something sticking out of a window
general 2020-11-05 10:52:07 That's just disgusting
general 2020-11-05 10:52:18 yes
general 2020-11-05 10:52:47 <@!451025784228806656> So bomber on bomber? Does that mean potentially endless carpet bombing?
general 2020-11-05 10:53:11 Call it a flying fortress
general 2020-11-05 10:54:40 If the F-16 XL provides better stability, more lift-to-drag ratio, smoother flight, significantly more fuel, more ordinance and 27 hardpoints

Imagine if it had thrust vectoring
general 2020-11-05 10:56:00 Probably be a cheaper route compared to the F-35/F-22
general 2020-11-05 10:56:15 But no stealth
general 2020-11-05 10:56:31 Add stealth to F-16XL VISTA
general 2020-11-05 10:56:58 And you get a cheaper 5th gen fighter that doesn't involve cost overruns
general 2020-11-05 10:58:41 <@!451025784228806656> F-16 XL + VISTA + stealth  technologies (not just paint)
general 2020-11-05 11:04:19 I need to find better intakes
general 2020-11-05 11:04:47 Because this intake doesn't look so good
general 2020-11-05 11:07:36 I think I'll go use box intakes
general 2020-11-05 11:07:40 Looks less of an eyesore
general 2020-11-05 11:07:52 Sorta like on the Panavia Tornado
general 2020-11-05 11:08:02 *jojo moment*
general 2020-11-05 11:09:10 I think I'll go do undercarriage mounted intakes or side box intakes
general 2020-11-05 11:09:54 Let me guess, you had experience
general 2020-11-05 11:10:53 Does Discord even have a support site? As in support.discord
general 2020-11-05 11:11:18 I mean it's already sus
general 2020-11-05 11:11:26 Attachments leading to a .mov file
general 2020-11-05 11:13:41 <@!292578772333363200> Is it the one that looks like a really low-res image?
general 2020-11-05 11:14:38 There's two kinds of IPs, from what I've heard from my Linux friends
general 2020-11-05 11:14:41 Dynamic and static

general 2020-11-05 11:38:36 That's the latest thing he has
general 2020-11-05 11:39:16 Let me be known for being in the background of an unde's video
general 2020-11-05 11:39:26 For almost the whole time
general 2020-11-05 11:40:54 Box intakes still a bit of a sore thumb, but less compared to round ones
general 2020-11-05 11:41:49 I think I should move the intakes forward
general 2020-11-05 11:41:55 Maybe that's why it looks like a sore thumb
general 2020-11-05 11:43:01 dat glass

general 2020-11-05 23:04:57 I would've immediately assumed K-pop
general 2020-11-05 23:05:32 Or maybe some KDE project
general 2020-11-05 23:10:22 What did you expect from Roblox?
general 2020-11-05 23:10:32 That they'd actually put in effort in development?
general 2020-11-05 23:11:21 Discord going OwO
general 2020-11-05 23:12:30 I feel like it'd be a bad idea to keep having that PFP

general 2020-11-05 23:13:59 On the other hand I'm a furry on this server, so I guess cursed is fine
general 2020-11-05 23:14:32 The server recommends this https://streamable.com/

general 2020-11-05 23:15:32 Discord only supports .mp4, .mov and .webm

general 2020-11-06 03:31:40 The irony
general 2020-11-06 03:33:27 The Dunning-Kruger effect states that people who aren't knowledgeable are unaware of how dumb they are, which makes them think they're smarter than what they really are
general 2020-11-06 03:33:49 Right now, we've seen general has multiple cases of this
general 2020-11-06 03:34:30 Like this guy, a no-brainer spamming someone's DMs
general 2020-11-06 03:35:10 <@!656137684213039124> They're all either stupid or undes aren't they?

general 2020-11-06 03:36:34 dragon
general 2020-11-06 03:36:37 yes
general 2020-11-06 03:38:53 <@!652639621708251148> You're pretty much the living evidence I need to show that people in real life can be pretty stupid, just like a Karen
general 2020-11-06 03:39:54 He's not a bad server owner. Imagine 3 new people just joined and then griefing suddenly happened

You'd think those 3 are suspicious, aren't they?
general 2020-11-06 03:40:49 Damn, why you gotta lie

general 2020-11-06 03:43:25 He's acting oddly guilty and immature, probably best to keep him banned
general 2020-11-06 03:44:58 > cool nobody gives a crap about you
<@!652639621708251148> Why are you describing yourself?
general 2020-11-06 03:45:30 He's here because he plays Plane Crazy, poob
general 2020-11-06 03:45:39 That's like asking a kid why he's in an arcade
general 2020-11-06 03:46:00 Even if you did sent the IP, it doesn't matter
general 2020-11-06 03:46:48 <@!652639621708251148> Then go make your own server, poob
general 2020-11-06 03:46:56 Get a Raspberry Pi or some old computer
general 2020-11-06 03:47:35 This dumbass thinks he can do better, I doubt he even has a cheap-ass server or good internet
general 2020-11-06 03:48:18 <@!652639621708251148> You can call Aternos cringe when you get your own server and some good internet, you annoying shithead
general 2020-11-06 03:48:36 But oh wait, you can't
general 2020-11-06 03:48:42 You don't know how the internet works
general 2020-11-06 03:49:03 So you can't even search up how to setup one without getting a brainfuck
general 2020-11-06 03:49:21 Sir, we're using the internet
general 2020-11-06 03:50:06 It's a World Wide Web of computers you dense dummy <@!652639621708251148> \
general 2020-11-06 03:50:22 You used Google
general 2020-11-06 03:50:26 We're talking about how to setup servers
general 2020-11-06 03:50:45 Something you're too braindead to even comprehend
general 2020-11-06 03:51:22 <@!652639621708251148> Yeah, I said **you**, not **me**
general 2020-11-06 03:51:28 Wow, you really are an idiot
general 2020-11-06 03:51:36 Can't even understand what a pronoun is
general 2020-11-06 03:52:29 Yeah, I said **you** can't search up how to setup a **server** <@!652639621708251148> 

Why do you have to twist my words just to get a petty win
general 2020-11-06 03:52:45 > oh yes but everyone whos here is gonna get blocked
<@!652639621708251148> Then leave
general 2020-11-06 03:52:49 Easier than blocking everyone
general 2020-11-06 03:53:01 Also, it's spelled Professor
general 2020-11-06 03:53:06 You're a kid
general 2020-11-06 03:53:28 You really look a lot like a 10 year old
general 2020-11-06 03:53:47 You speak like a 10 year old, you argue like a 10 year old, you think like a 10 year old
general 2020-11-06 03:54:06 Eh, fair
general 2020-11-06 03:54:29 But still, don't deny you were being toxic yourself
general 2020-11-06 03:55:11 You know we can't adjust for you right? Like this isn't even an argument
general 2020-11-06 03:55:18 It's just common sense
general 2020-11-06 03:56:01 He went, but didn't leave
general 2020-11-06 03:56:24 Tsunami was fair tbh
general 2020-11-06 03:56:48 It's not bullying, it's called arguing
general 2020-11-06 03:57:03 Can you just go somewhere else
general 2020-11-06 03:57:19 Even I'm tired of the bs here
general 2020-11-06 03:58:06 > also shadow did a damn good job of not getting warned
<@!615356321340063784> yes he did keep his cool, explained his reasons well, stuff like this
general 2020-11-06 03:58:26 He's not mocking you
general 2020-11-06 03:58:43 He wasn't bullying you, he was being constructive
general 2020-11-06 03:59:08 He didn't deserve a warn because he was doing his job, and he did a good job doing that
general 2020-11-06 03:59:25 Tsunami here was being a fair mod, he wasn't going against you
general 2020-11-06 03:59:50 If Tsunami was being unfair we would've all gone against him in revolt
general 2020-11-06 04:00:17 Then please, shut. Come back later when everything has calmed down
general 2020-11-06 04:00:43 That's just common sense at this point, wait until it's calm
general 2020-11-06 04:00:51 No, it isn't
general 2020-11-06 04:01:01 It's just your messed up perception of reality telling you that
general 2020-11-06 04:01:14 Like I don't get how where fabricated those lies
general 2020-11-06 04:02:00 <@!652639621708251148> You know there's settings for pings, and none of us have broken the ToS
general 2020-11-06 04:02:08 If we were sending you threats then that would've broken the ToS
general 2020-11-06 04:02:23 He did broke a rule, being toxic
general 2020-11-06 04:03:34 <@!652639621708251148> Can you just forget this happened, and we won't bother you
general 2020-11-06 04:03:53 **shut**, and just forget
general 2020-11-06 04:04:20 > CAN ALL OF YOU FUCKING STOP GIVING HIM ATTENTION
<@!409676438682206218> okay
general 2020-11-06 04:04:31 I'll just go ahead and go back to PC
general 2020-11-06 04:05:22 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/774122097034657802 good cat

general 2020-11-06 04:05:46 Cats keep the chat calm
general 2020-11-06 04:06:07 cat hammock
general 2020-11-06 04:06:13 cat go relax
general 2020-11-06 04:06:20 Let's be like the cat
general 2020-11-06 04:06:26 *Relax*
general 2020-11-06 04:06:48 Excuse me wtf just happened
general 2020-11-06 04:07:06 Is it me or did the server lose braincells this month?
general 2020-11-06 04:07:29 2020 is the year this server somehow is more braindead than it usually is
general 2020-11-06 04:07:38 It has became unacceptably braindead
general 2020-11-06 04:08:33 Can we all go relax to the soothing sounds of a bomber flying overhead
general 2020-11-06 04:09:20 cat go blep
general 2020-11-06 04:12:07 <@!354786846049566720> btw Shadow's busy eating
general 2020-11-06 04:12:54 Bees, they make the sweet stuff
general 2020-11-06 04:13:02 And they make flowers go alive
general 2020-11-06 04:15:40 If you're too poor to go to Brazil
general 2020-11-06 04:15:49 Then go to the Soviet gulags
general 2020-11-06 04:18:51 oh yeah i almost forgot
general 2020-11-06 04:18:57 that blob is the owner
general 2020-11-06 04:19:36 I like it when general is calm
general 2020-11-06 04:19:39 Or is memey
general 2020-11-06 04:30:01 Are we a brain piloting a skeletal organic mech or are we a body being controlled by a self-aware cellular mush?
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:32:35 Might consider doing F-18 style or Saab Draken style like wings
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:32:54 Otherwise, some sort of double delta or cranked arrow wing
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:35:32 I did consider using them once
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:35:48 ~~but I couldn't manage to make them work, ended up with a glorified magnet drive~~
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:37:33 Can't see anyone complaining
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:37:46 It's both a real life thing and smooth
general 2020-11-06 04:57:37 5/10, needs Succhoi
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:58:49 All planes have turrets
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:58:56 Usually rotary cannons or autocannons
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:59:41 Oh, what I said usually applies to jet aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 05:00:19 <@!720128356452139087> But you can add guns, you can't have a plane without them
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 05:00:35 Unless it be some 2nd generation aircraft where BVR missiles are more important
general 2020-11-06 06:29:33 There's a mod that removes the build limit
general 2020-11-06 06:29:47 O h
general 2020-11-06 06:30:05 <@!403843930543882241> That exists, alongside vertical chunks
general 2020-11-06 06:31:27 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdxXHsQsDaA this should allow chunk spawning at infinite heights
general 2020-11-06 06:35:28 I'm gonna go on Minecraft
general 2020-11-06 06:36:37 wait y
general 2020-11-06 06:37:14 Fine I'll go build at the Nether
general 2020-11-06 06:37:16 Dibs on the Nether
general 2020-11-06 06:38:10 I wanna build mememunism in the Nether
general 2020-11-06 06:38:14 Or some other stupid stuff
general 2020-11-06 06:38:40 I might build a civilization in the Nether, I might build a lab
general 2020-11-06 06:38:46 Heck I could build an interdimensional lab
general 2020-11-06 06:39:10 Then I will build a town in the Nether
general 2020-11-06 06:39:22 Where I shall establish Smolistan
general 2020-11-06 06:40:25 <@!354786846049566720> In Memestan, we must share
general 2020-11-06 06:40:31 So yes we should
general 2020-11-06 06:40:57 Now, what's the first line of business in Memestan
general 2020-11-06 07:48:58 funni lizard man is just building his minecraft home
general 2020-11-06 07:49:02 starting with his bloccy bridge
general 2020-11-06 10:03:01 I am having a brainfuck again
general 2020-11-06 10:03:12 This time with some classes stuff
general 2020-11-06 10:03:20 Can't answer a question I haven't studied yet
general 2020-11-06 10:09:45 racist words?
general 2020-11-06 10:35:43 <@!656137684213039124> ~~have you remembered about cracked users~~
general 2020-11-06 10:36:10 I see a point in transferring servers, heard RAM allocation on Aternos is about 2 GB-ish
general 2020-11-06 10:36:43 Pretty much the fact it's free and allows cracked is the reason I use it
general 2020-11-06 10:37:50 How is he gonna pay for it though
general 2020-11-06 10:39:51 Btw Minecraft has an official server
general 2020-11-06 10:40:09 Well, never had any experience with server hosting
general 2020-11-06 10:40:20 But I'll go search up the differences between the two
general 2020-11-06 10:42:18 https://www.reddit.com/r/admincraft/comments/gb05mo/hosting_discussion_2020_mayjune/ <@!656137684213039124>
general 2020-11-06 10:42:34 Well, according to this thread they don't have a very good experience with Shockbyte
general 2020-11-06 10:44:00 Apprently, Shockbyte is low-tier
general 2020-11-06 10:44:05 So don't go with that
general 2020-11-06 10:44:16 So yeah, go with Apex
general 2020-11-06 10:45:38 I feel like you'd be better off with Apex anyways, Shockbyte customer support apparently is a joke
general 2020-11-06 10:45:51 Aka, there is no support
general 2020-11-06 10:46:34 I'm surprised you can manage that
general 2020-11-06 10:46:56 Better have a way to support it
general 2020-11-06 10:47:02 Well, Blob's the boss
general 2020-11-06 10:47:59 ~~*cries in cheap*~~
general 2020-11-06 10:51:20 Sounds like you people are making a public server ngl
general 2020-11-06 10:51:28 But it's private
general 2020-11-06 10:52:43 Guess I'll go draw out the plot size I'll need for the apartment suite
general 2020-11-06 10:53:28 Yes, that's what I was doing
general 2020-11-06 10:53:56 Might do a pool just for the roads to connect with the other buildings
general 2020-11-06 10:58:02 What should I do with the bridge to a little lodge I'll make
general 2020-11-06 10:58:46 She needs your liver
general 2020-11-06 10:59:51 Any suggestions for the apartment suite?
general 2020-11-06 11:00:38 oh oof nexity is offline
general 2020-11-06 11:00:58 Well, I'm gonna go do some PC stuff
general 2020-11-06 11:05:07 > <@!289930922655088640> im here
<@456226577798135808> i mean the server, should've clarified
general 2020-11-06 11:09:07 We already have too many members leaving, don't go
general 2020-11-06 11:14:21 fast dorito isn't fast enough
general 2020-11-06 11:14:26 needs 10,000 sps
general 2020-11-06 11:15:32 So, does Draken in Swedish mean dragon and kite?
general 2020-11-06 11:18:32 I should really build a Draken someday
general 2020-11-06 11:18:40 Just for my namesake
general 2020-11-06 11:21:20 <@!359613171495075842> Oh I meant the plane
general 2020-11-06 11:33:46 somehow my plane is wobbling when pitching
general 2020-11-06 11:35:30 Adding wings in the front added stability
general 2020-11-06 11:47:12 I don't even know what a camlock is
general 2020-11-06 11:51:14 That's one detailed excavator
general 2020-11-06 12:14:05 yes
general 2020-11-06 12:15:24 https://streamable.com/oiolir Is this what you call a tailslide?
general 2020-11-06 12:15:31 Or am I thinking up of something else
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 12:20:24 Is this what's called a tailslide? https://streamable.com/oiolir
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 12:20:32 Or am I thinking up of something else I don't know the name of

general 2020-11-06 12:31:23 Managed to do it flat
general 2020-11-06 12:31:31 For some reason
general 2020-11-06 12:32:23 I really don't know what maneuver I did there tbh
general 2020-11-06 12:33:10 Why you gotta make me laugh
general 2020-11-06 12:34:05 Nah even he wouldn't make that
general 2020-11-06 12:51:11 Ro-Sux
general 2020-11-06 12:51:42 I mean he did have a generic Joker PFP
general 2020-11-06 12:55:22 Save that image
general 2020-11-06 12:55:25 And post it OOC
general 2020-11-06 12:55:35 out of context

general 2020-11-06 13:04:25 I broke the plane <@!403843930543882241>
general 2020-11-06 13:04:40 The one I said I thought was doing tailslide
general 2020-11-06 13:04:47 I broke it by rotating the cockpit
general 2020-11-06 13:04:57 Mid-flight
general 2020-11-06 13:05:13 The neck has been snapped
general 2020-11-06 22:19:35 > the collective iq of this server is -10x10^3003
<@715019067773157406> Pretty much accurate
general 2020-11-06 22:20:25 I misread Phase 3 as Google Pixel 3
general 2020-11-06 22:21:12 Bunny is aerodynamic if he lies down
general 2020-11-06 22:21:32 Gotta reduce the drag

general 2020-11-06 22:26:38 Blow wind onto the bun
general 2020-11-07 01:19:59 robo is robo
general 2020-11-07 01:42:52 I have no idea what to do
general 2020-11-07 01:43:19 Maybe I'll go setup Winaero Tweaker and Open Shell
general 2020-11-07 01:43:28 So I can have nice looking Windows 10 desktop
general 2020-11-07 01:44:05 Whose tank is that?
general 2020-11-07 01:44:08 And yes body is nice
general 2020-11-07 01:44:11 very detailed
general 2020-11-07 01:44:35 The wheels
general 2020-11-07 01:44:37 B l o c c
general 2020-11-07 01:44:57 Blocky wheels look out of place
general 2020-11-07 01:48:16 Found this on a review about Open Shell, ignoring the Windows 9x style start button, looks better doesn't it? https://tr1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/01/08/cd68ca9e-b6a7-43c3-941b-e99f4414975f/resize/770x/f0a00834aeaeb5f05910edd8164da697/figure-b.jpg

general 2020-11-07 01:52:30 Oh
general 2020-11-07 01:58:10 "They thought it would make me better"

Remember, parents are like dinosaurs
general 2020-11-07 01:58:50 <@!287779983445721088> Can you tell them to Google up the word "escapism", and tell them they're taking that away from you
general 2020-11-07 02:00:23 At this point I would find it plausible that they're dumb, at least with EQ
general 2020-11-07 02:01:15 Aazo, where do you live?
general 2020-11-07 02:01:25 Just the country
general 2020-11-07 02:01:29 Nothing specific
general 2020-11-07 02:01:52 I live in Asian country
general 2020-11-07 02:02:26 In the meantime, there are other ways to play games
general 2020-11-07 02:03:18 "my opinion doesn't matter"

*I'm still bitter about the fact that when I wanted to make a video for a school project, I still had to follow their shitty unprofessionalism*
general 2020-11-07 02:03:50 Asian parents also don't have good advice when it comes to literally anything modern
general 2020-11-07 02:04:21 They may be decent with the stuff they were raised with
general 2020-11-07 02:04:37 But I shouldn't rely on them for stuff like film, software or technology
general 2020-11-07 02:04:52 The fact my mom has boomer humor should be a sign she's not reliable
general 2020-11-07 02:05:34 <@!287779983445721088> Always do your best to separate your private life online
general 2020-11-07 02:05:53 I always put my accounts behind inconveniences and passwords and crap
general 2020-11-07 02:06:14 Usually, an idiot can't see they're an idiot
general 2020-11-07 02:09:35 oh server is up
general 2020-11-07 02:10:03 why must it be hot
general 2020-11-07 02:11:20 Please tell me you have a rollback system
general 2020-11-07 02:11:36 So damages can be at least mitigated
general 2020-11-07 02:11:58 Blobethanol
general 2020-11-07 02:12:07 wait who?
general 2020-11-07 02:12:21 /kill @e[type=tnt], not sure
general 2020-11-07 02:12:48 Yep TNT's entity id is "tnt"
general 2020-11-07 02:13:09 So /kill @e[type=tnt]

How about placing a command block in the spawn that kills TNT?
general 2020-11-07 02:14:26 It's whitelisted
general 2020-11-07 02:14:39 Ask Blob
general 2020-11-07 02:14:54 Nexity
general 2020-11-07 02:15:06 So that's why I can't connect
general 2020-11-07 02:15:09 It's lagging
general 2020-11-07 02:15:35 <@456226577798135808> SymptomaticAazo9 wants to join the server
general 2020-11-07 02:16:17 Do it, and probably make it so that anything TNT is killed with a repeating command block
general 2020-11-07 02:16:58 What about STC?
general 2020-11-07 02:17:30 fuck im timing out
general 2020-11-07 02:17:44 I'm running on 1.16.4 w/ Optifine
general 2020-11-07 02:19:48 I'm on cracked 1.16.4
general 2020-11-07 02:20:14 What do I do if I keep timing out and can't connect
general 2020-11-07 02:21:21 <@!772187887018049536> 
`C:\Users\\[username]\AppData\Roaming\\.minecraft\mods`
Put Optifine here
general 2020-11-07 02:21:28 Or that
general 2020-11-07 02:22:22 You can enter that directly into the Windows file explorer location bar
general 2020-11-07 02:23:20 Okay, so here's two options
On TLauncher, just select "1.16.4 Optifine"
general 2020-11-07 02:23:42 Or if you're not on TLauncher, enter this folder `C:\Users\\[username]\AppData\Roaming\\.minecraft\mods`
general 2020-11-07 02:23:51 Then put the Optifine Java file there
general 2020-11-07 02:24:05 This is under the assumption you have Forge
general 2020-11-07 02:24:41 Though if I remember doesn't Optifine have the ability to install itself?
general 2020-11-07 02:25:06 I'm too tired from the heat
general 2020-11-07 02:25:10 I can barely think
general 2020-11-07 02:27:06 Keep your account, you'll still use it when you're older and independent
general 2020-11-07 02:28:07 <@!656137684213039124> Aight I keep timing out
general 2020-11-07 02:30:02 This happened again
general 2020-11-07 02:30:15 <@!772187887018049536> D: drive? You got portable Minecraft?
general 2020-11-07 02:30:44 A C: and D: drive
general 2020-11-07 02:30:55 Then what's the disk drive then
general 2020-11-07 02:32:09 Well, I'm just gonna give up for now
general 2020-11-07 02:49:05 I'm gonna return later
general 2020-11-07 02:49:12 And see if I can connect
general 2020-11-07 02:49:28 And maybe do some more progress
general 2020-11-07 02:55:07 There is no password
general 2020-11-07 02:56:10 Ch0mega, it's whitelisted 

Think of it like a friends only server, or like a Ferrari where only selected people can buy
general 2020-11-07 02:57:34 Mirror is just another download link
general 2020-11-07 02:57:48 It's a "mirror" of the main download link
general 2020-11-07 02:58:44 Doesn't Optifine have an installer?
general 2020-11-07 03:00:12 Aight, cya
general 2020-11-07 03:04:25 Star motor
general 2020-11-07 14:52:09 GoogleChrome does indeed use a red screen to warn you
general 2020-11-07 14:52:35 Besides that looks too low quality to be Google's
general 2020-11-07 14:53:26 <@656137684213039124> We both know Google sets a high standard even in designing minor stuff like errors and warns
general 2020-11-07 14:53:41 Gotta be professional
general 2020-11-07 14:54:14 Isn't that pretty much big tech
general 2020-11-07 14:54:37 There's the real warn
general 2020-11-07 14:54:43 Red and eye catching
general 2020-11-07 14:56:12 I'll be anticipating for Apex hosting if it does indeed allow 24/7 hosting
general 2020-11-07 14:57:22 Then Shoccbyte
general 2020-11-07 15:01:38 Woooosh
general 2020-11-07 15:05:38 I misread that as Samsung Pula
general 2020-11-07 15:06:22 The Renault car?
general 2020-11-07 15:06:40 Add their minivan that has an F1 engine
general 2020-11-07 15:07:23 You had a stroke typing that
general 2020-11-07 15:08:01 Go figure it out, Sherkbloc Holmes
general 2020-11-07 15:08:41 Review the Thailand server
general 2020-11-07 15:08:54 The unde farm
general 2020-11-07 15:10:02 <@415192917012119552> Gamer Thailand has the case of doing one or two illegal things
general 2020-11-07 15:10:18 Literally, not even a joke
general 2020-11-07 15:10:57 Showing NSFW to minors and requesting for sensitive data like passports
general 2020-11-07 15:11:33 I like your thinking Blob
general 2020-11-07 15:11:59 Fr set a budget
general 2020-11-07 15:12:15 Unless you're willing to host your own server
general 2020-11-07 15:12:26 In which that case a Raspberry Pi 4 will do you fine
general 2020-11-07 15:12:45 Yes
general 2020-11-07 15:12:53 Get the best bang for your buck
general 2020-11-07 15:13:33 If I remember
general 2020-11-07 15:13:49 The most expensive Pi 4 costs like 80 bucks for an 8 GB model
general 2020-11-07 15:14:27 ARM processor does good for low power
general 2020-11-07 15:14:52 <@456226577798135808> yes good
general 2020-11-07 15:15:02 But the price
general 2020-11-07 15:15:35 Actually that looks decent
general 2020-11-07 15:16:50 I'm trying to get in to continue the apartment I'm building
general 2020-11-07 15:16:56 It's 11 so tomorrow though
general 2020-11-07 15:17:48 The French like to be unusual
general 2020-11-07 15:18:56 Yes
general 2020-11-07 15:19:12 And I am just building an apartment, with a pool and parking
general 2020-11-07 15:19:31 Might add an elytra station
general 2020-11-07 15:19:57 I feel like Llama chains would be like trucks
general 2020-11-07 15:20:08 Donkeys are like SUVs
general 2020-11-07 15:20:17 Pigs would be like scooters
general 2020-11-07 15:20:30 And horses are cars
general 2020-11-07 15:20:50 What's very good
general 2020-11-07 15:22:07 <@730808827234091041> I mean India's looking pretty ripe for high-end specs for low prices
general 2020-11-07 15:23:44 The Asians rn really be on price to specs compettition
general 2020-11-07 15:23:57 Meanwhile Nokia just exists
general 2020-11-07 15:24:06 And Windows phone is dead
general 2020-11-07 15:24:41 Look at how many Chinese and Samsung phones try to compete in having the best specs for low prices
general 2020-11-07 15:24:57 <@722506071733960794> Geotagging
general 2020-11-07 15:25:52 <@730808827234091041> Honestly for what they provide, Chinese phones are highly appealing 

I still have trust issues with Huawei though
general 2020-11-07 15:26:12 Like how do you get those specs for a decent price
general 2020-11-07 15:27:33 Well, I wish luck onto you two in server hosting
general 2020-11-07 15:28:32 1 USD here is give or take 40-50 PHP
general 2020-11-08 00:12:17 I actually kind of want breakfast now, Buffalo wings with a blue cheese dip
general 2020-11-08 00:13:02 A console is like a gaming media center
general 2020-11-08 00:13:13 Unless it's the Switch
general 2020-11-08 00:13:55 In which in that case the Switch is a portable Wii U
general 2020-11-08 00:14:28 Switch Lite, why though?
general 2020-11-08 00:14:58 Go for the regular Switch, with normal controllers
general 2020-11-08 00:15:25 O h
general 2020-11-08 00:15:38 Damn the Switch really is high demand
general 2020-11-08 00:16:21 What's BRM5?
general 2020-11-08 00:16:49 I live under a rock so I don't know it still
general 2020-11-08 00:17:52 In that case, I put on some music
general 2020-11-08 00:17:59 Maybe take a quick bfeak
general 2020-11-08 00:18:07 Then go back to what I'm doing
general 2020-11-08 00:18:49 Asian, where expectations are more important than practical reality
general 2020-11-08 00:19:02 Depends on the parents
general 2020-11-08 00:19:29 Mine doesn't reward me
general 2020-11-08 00:19:36 Like that
general 2020-11-08 00:19:59 Honestly, the fact they keep feeding me shit is kinda demotivating
general 2020-11-08 00:20:21 At least with schoolwork anyways
general 2020-11-08 00:20:30 Otherwise, decent
general 2020-11-08 00:20:52 I mean they did gift me an external HDD
general 2020-11-08 00:21:14 Not really
general 2020-11-08 00:21:19 I mean they're cheap
general 2020-11-08 00:21:23 What did you expect
general 2020-11-08 00:21:41 It's better than that USB thumb stick scam
general 2020-11-08 00:22:16 <@195253906333368320> They're cheap though
general 2020-11-08 00:22:29 Well at least its USB 3.0
general 2020-11-08 00:22:39 Otherwise I would've had hell
general 2020-11-08 00:23:22 I got a 1 TB HDD, same one that stored my Xbox 360 games
general 2020-11-08 00:23:35 It honestly runs well enough
general 2020-11-08 00:25:18 I heard Lubuntu at best can run idling at 200MBish of RAM
general 2020-11-08 00:26:07 Similar results with Xubuntu, except its more polished despite focusing on being light

general 2020-11-08 02:29:18 ***c h e e s e***
general 2020-11-08 02:30:58 I don't know what to do rn
general 2020-11-08 02:39:46 ok boomer
general 2020-11-08 03:01:38 rabid zoom
general 2020-11-08 03:02:19 I'm gonna go read this page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_configuration
general 2020-11-08 03:02:57 And the page for supermaneuverability
general 2020-11-08 03:03:14 Even though PC doesn't have realistic aerodynamics
general 2020-11-08 03:03:35 Then I shall fork that creativity
general 2020-11-08 03:03:42 Or make an alternative
general 2020-11-08 03:03:51 Kinda like what happened when the crank got patented
general 2020-11-08 03:05:03 The alternative is stupidity
general 2020-11-08 03:05:09 Be big dumb-dumb
general 2020-11-08 03:06:59 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etrich_Taube Imagine seeing this in the sky
general 2020-11-08 03:07:47 Why were you doing that in the first place anywyas
general 2020-11-08 03:12:26 What if I did a trapezoid wing + cranked arrow delta
general 2020-11-08 03:13:46 j e e  p
general 2020-11-08 03:35:57 give me more ideas for plane aerodynamics
general 2020-11-08 03:37:21 We've known each other, for too long
general 2020-11-08 03:37:26 I know the game and I'm not gonna play it
general 2020-11-08 03:37:41 No that was intentional
general 2020-11-08 03:38:03 Seems it flew over your head
general 2020-11-08 03:38:24 anyways i need actual ideas that i'll end up using
general 2020-11-08 03:39:37 Most of my designs *reduce* the amount of wing panels used
general 2020-11-08 03:40:31 Wikipedia still ends up being more useful than whatever's in the chat rn
general 2020-11-08 03:40:39 <@!419477639229865984> yes, that's good cat
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 03:41:26 Any ideas of what to add on a custom plane
general 2020-11-08 03:45:58 Anyone know the advantages of the tapered wing configuration of the F-104 Starfighter? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_F-104_Starfighter
general 2020-11-08 03:46:37 that thumbnail pretty much sums it up
general 2020-11-08 03:47:48 The Mini has a lot of generations, mostly with no styling changes
general 2020-11-08 03:47:51 So I can't even tell
general 2020-11-08 03:48:32 The wheels did give me those 2000s vibes
general 2020-11-08 03:49:56 So does low aspect ratio mean potentially better manuverability?
general 2020-11-08 03:50:36 Best you'll get is Citroen's hydropneumatic suspension
general 2020-11-08 03:51:14 I wonder if variable sweep wings have any advantages in-game
general 2020-11-08 03:51:37 I got bored, so I was thinking of messing around with wing design
general 2020-11-08 03:53:11 If someone actually makes an Altair 8800, that works in this game, they better damn get an inventor role
general 2020-11-08 04:01:29 Did a little experiment and this seemed to give it more roll without compromising on pitch
general 2020-11-08 04:02:14 Of course I'd motor lock it
general 2020-11-08 04:02:40 But it's just a simple tower
general 2020-11-08 04:02:57 yes
general 2020-11-08 04:03:03 I need to learn how to use hover engines
general 2020-11-08 04:03:07 hover drives
general 2020-11-08 04:03:10 Whatever you call them
general 2020-11-08 04:03:17 Because I can't somehow use them on aircraft
general 2020-11-08 04:03:54 Oh, I already did round exhaust
general 2020-11-08 04:04:10 With about a single locked motor
general 2020-11-08 04:04:41 No I mean I literally only used 1 motor lock for each exhaust
general 2020-11-08 04:04:44 Not segment
general 2020-11-08 04:04:50 At least in my recent designs
general 2020-11-08 04:05:42 Literally just a locked motor, that rotates 45 degrees ish
general 2020-11-08 04:06:15 I mean it works, doesn't spasm mid-flight
general 2020-11-08 04:06:39 yes i am the big dumb
general 2020-11-08 04:07:49 works good enough for me
general 2020-11-08 04:08:12 Even though I could do better to hide it
general 2020-11-08 04:09:31 The USA is funny
general 2020-11-08 04:10:14 This post was made the Asian gang
general 2020-11-08 04:13:05 Hello I'm Asian and I never had fish and chips
general 2020-11-08 04:13:36 I've only put ketchup on fries
general 2020-11-08 04:13:59 I find putting ketchup on anything else is either incompatible or you're gonna drown it, like with burgers and pizza
general 2020-11-08 04:14:07 Like the pizza already has tomato sauce, don't put ketchup on it
general 2020-11-08 04:14:31 I like blue cheese dressing on my buffalo wings
general 2020-11-08 04:14:38 I like cheese in general

general 2020-11-08 04:17:16 So you don't need something big
general 2020-11-08 04:17:36 Just eat the small version of the 4 Cheese Whopper on an occasional basis

general 2020-11-10 03:47:18 It's a ping, it's not gonna harm you
general 2020-11-10 03:47:27 And it's not even hard to disable

<@!713898685540597822> It's because not everyone can speak Spanish
general 2020-11-10 03:49:27 "They can use Google Translate"

*You do realize nobody just casually talks with a translator*
general 2020-11-10 03:49:59 <@!287701246192648193> You glitched out of existence
general 2020-11-10 03:50:31 Wiisports, they're not lazy, you're honestly ignorant
general 2020-11-10 03:52:35 That's really my honest opinion, let me give out some points

- It's really enefficient to use a translator just to understand you, not only that but nobody just casually talks with a translator all the time. Try constantly copying and pasting on mobile, you'll get tired of it and it's slow
- Google Translate **isn't** accurate, because you know how complex languages can be and a computer can't understand every subtle detail of a language

**please read this wiisports**

general 2020-11-10 03:53:44 Then don't tell us not to ping you
general 2020-11-10 03:53:55 Seriously, that's a flawed argument

general 2020-11-11 11:49:34 I wonder if there's any advantages to using dedicated elevators compared to just doing a canard-delta design

general 2020-11-11 12:06:49 That's meh quality
general 2020-11-11 12:06:59 I just build average quality planes
general 2020-11-11 12:07:05 Sometimes with weird physics
general 2020-11-11 12:07:58 I think I'll go try making a trapezoidal wing plane
general 2020-11-11 12:08:17 Or make some double delta
general 2020-11-11 12:08:32 Just so I can add leading root extensions and bigger flaps
general 2020-11-11 12:09:18 I have the constant need to make planes 🅱️etter
general 2020-11-11 12:09:26 or worse
general 2020-11-11 12:11:45 I've made a plane with larger flaps and have it's flaps spread out
general 2020-11-11 12:11:49 It was too sharp in pitch
general 2020-11-11 12:12:11 But roll is still something I need to improve on
general 2020-11-11 12:12:30 I'll go figure out how to make large flaps look small
general 2020-11-11 12:17:28 I think I'll go modify an older plane design
general 2020-11-11 12:19:21 <@!447221768520859659> In a canard-delta setup, I make it so that each flap is divided into two, but can still act as one when pitching, with the other half being used for roll
general 2020-11-11 12:20:45 I'll show you what I did
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 12:46:06 Something tells me this is gonna end up looking a little weird
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 12:46:27 It just looks so stubby
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 12:47:32 Needs length
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 12:48:54 Make it l o n g e r

plane-crazy 2020-11-11 12:51:12 
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 12:51:33 Better but still feels offputting
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 12:51:46 I'll go experiment around
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 12:59:32 chonky wing
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 13:00:32 Gonna fine tune the trapezoidal wing

plane-crazy 2020-11-11 13:06:52 Northrop F-20 Tigershark
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 13:06:59 Just because it's nose is heccin long

plane-crazy 2020-11-11 13:10:15 Still kinda chonky, kinda like the F-104 Starfighter
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 13:11:37 I'll go do trapezoidal wing-canard setup
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 13:11:42 Instead of delta-canard
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 13:12:46 I'll leave delta to experiment with trapezoid wing
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 13:12:53 Because bigger flaps
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 13:12:59 And leading edge extensions
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 13:13:09 I want that maneuverability
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 13:14:32 I just realized that if I add a vertical stabilizer
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 13:14:51 It'll have to be either a single one or a V-tail

plane-crazy 2020-11-11 14:53:27 Rotated parts not having collision is a bad idea for folded builds
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 14:55:02 Tomorrow when electricity ain't fluctuating, I'll continue building aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 14:55:17 There's two kinds of motors
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 14:57:05 So rotate motors to get a good angle
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 14:57:24 Make sure to rotate using a locked motor
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 14:57:27 Or it'll spasm
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 14:57:44 I learned that the hard way
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 14:58:11 Springs are also a viable alternative to disconnectors
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 14:59:40 Reason I don't use TNT is it only works on PvP or Private

plane-crazy 2020-11-11 15:01:39 But I haven't gotten plot sized
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 15:04:09 Canopy
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 15:04:31 I need to do what you do
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 15:04:51 But then again, I minimize drag
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 15:04:56 By minimizing wing panels
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 15:05:05 And only adding them for flaps
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 15:05:22 And hide control surfaces for extra roll
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 15:06:24 I usually do better with delta-canard setups
plane-crazy 2020-11-11 15:07:39 I use a simple motor lock tower

general 2020-11-13 06:24:50 What if rickje optimizes the 4M save data?
general 2020-11-13 06:25:01 For more save data
general 2020-11-13 06:25:28 We already have plenty of save data anyways
general 2020-11-13 06:25:55 I'm just rebuilding an old aircraft
general 2020-11-13 06:26:30 Add progressively expanding slots, so we can practically have infinite save slots
general 2020-11-13 06:26:59 Yes
general 2020-11-13 06:27:23 100 slots is good
general 2020-11-13 06:27:27 But add a search function
general 2020-11-13 06:27:41 Because that's too many slots for me to read
general 2020-11-13 06:28:40 But that's with 35 save slots
general 2020-11-13 06:28:44 100 is big

general 2020-11-13 07:19:58 I think some random guy trying to make an intro out of my plane

<@!720891502108344360> 
While it isn't concrete, saying "wait let me make intro" then proceeding to jump onto my unlocked plane kinda sus
general 2020-11-13 07:23:58 On the other hand, he can't get a clear shot without the outlines showing it ain't his
general 2020-11-13 07:24:13 And if he did manage to leave it out, well it's a pretty crappy shot probably
general 2020-11-13 07:24:30 I blacklisted anyways
general 2020-11-13 07:24:33 With anti-copy on
general 2020-11-13 07:27:09 https://www.roblox.com/users/1251710945/profile I'll go search up this guy's channel later to see if he actually did it
general 2020-11-13 07:27:58 On the other hand does this even look pretty
general 2020-11-13 07:29:36 Because I cannot hover engine
general 2020-11-13 07:29:41 Without it failing
general 2020-11-13 07:30:20 And I struggle in controlling conveyor drives
general 2020-11-13 07:30:26 For they are too fast
general 2020-11-13 07:30:38 10k is too much sped
general 2020-11-13 07:31:35 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2020-11-13 07:32:20 Actually, I could've just done a twin conveyor drive setup
general 2020-11-13 07:32:25 Also do this `/shrug`
general 2020-11-13 07:32:40 I forgot I could just do a twin conveyor drive
general 2020-11-13 07:32:46 One for 1K and below
general 2020-11-13 07:32:51 And another for 10K and above
general 2020-11-13 07:36:47 I have no idea what to add here at the middle of the back
general 2020-11-13 07:37:03 Back with the fuselage though
general 2020-11-13 07:37:46 I got lazy in putting a chair
general 2020-11-13 07:37:50 So I put it in the canard motor lock
general 2020-11-13 07:38:22 Is that purely conveyor drive?
general 2020-11-13 07:38:41 But how much rocket engines?
general 2020-11-13 07:39:17 I think I'll reduce the super rockets
general 2020-11-13 07:39:52 Mine's just sorta medium sized
general 2020-11-13 07:40:22 I think I just read "Drone Island" in the chat

general 2020-11-13 07:43:54 I think I'll go add this little triangle
general 2020-11-13 07:43:56 To fill in the gap
general 2020-11-13 07:43:58 Lazily
general 2020-11-13 07:44:48 Actually I can just make it a smooth gap

general 2020-11-13 07:44:52 Like in the back of the F-18
general 2020-11-13 07:45:27 Those elevators look like it combined with the main wing
general 2020-11-13 07:45:37 For some reason
general 2020-11-13 07:45:54 ew milk is going into your nose
general 2020-11-13 07:48:26 this looks kinda weird
general 2020-11-13 07:48:46 To just fill in the void like this
general 2020-11-13 07:49:04 Like nothing in between, just like in the F-18

plane-crazy 2020-11-13 08:06:12 and keep building engine
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 08:06:51 What if boxer engine
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 08:06:57 But V-engine also
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 08:07:33 <@!224513422161739776> Closest I can think of is someone's turbofan engine

plane-crazy 2020-11-13 08:09:23 I can actually see some blades there
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 09:44:51 weird vertical stabilizers
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 09:45:37 It does it's job, but also slows down roll
general 2020-11-13 09:46:26 If rickje adds more than one keybinds for controls then that would be pretty convenient
general 2020-11-13 09:46:43 Obvious thing I could think of is better aircraft controls
general 2020-11-13 09:48:06 I forgot to rotate

*This looks even weirder*
general 2020-11-13 09:48:20 weird stabilizers got weirder
general 2020-11-13 09:48:36 > so i can actually have a good Ironclad
<@!670491329905557544> what if plane rotary cannons/autocannons
general 2020-11-13 09:49:21 I mean it's entirely possible to reuse that to make autocannons
general 2020-11-13 11:14:36 I have concluded that I cannot recreate my supersonic fighter's characteristics
general 2020-11-13 11:15:56 Imperial Japan is brutal

general 2020-11-13 11:17:41 By not crashing
general 2020-11-13 11:17:54 And actually stayed at home
general 2020-11-13 11:18:18 Yes but let's assume its the end of the war
general 2020-11-13 11:18:23 And there's still some pilots left
general 2020-11-13 11:18:41 Probably lived a normal life after that
general 2020-11-13 11:18:57 Japan at this point is tech and anime and culture
general 2020-11-13 11:19:34 <@467765396108476426> I could do that
general 2020-11-13 11:19:46 I need to reduce throttling
general 2020-11-13 11:19:55 So I can get some good pitching out of large flaps

general 2020-11-13 11:51:00 Cannons, slower than guns, faster than missiles and in between with power

general 2020-11-13 12:24:56 Literally
general 2020-11-13 12:25:24 Like that sounds like some sort of tornado or tropical storm
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:26:11 I think I need to rework the upper portion of this
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:28:26 The fastest method of thrust is a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:28:43 For me they work fine
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:29:04 I still get straight level flight
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:30:05 For me it's just two blocks in length, two blocks in height, for a total of 4 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:31:02 If you want to see someone doing fine with conveyor drive, let me show you an old video I have
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:31:31 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/768692007404830751 Here is me, having normal flight with a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:32:56 I still don't know how I managed to make it pitch stable though
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:33:06 Like it's perfectly fine with pitching
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:33:16 Which I've never been able to recreate (almost)
general 2020-11-13 12:36:19 I almost thought that wasn't PC
general 2020-11-13 12:36:27 Then I saw the center of lift and center of mass
general 2020-11-13 12:38:15 > and side task bar
<@!720891502108344360> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(user_interface)
general 2020-11-13 12:38:18 Side task bar
general 2020-11-13 12:39:37 How does one make airliner nose not weird
general 2020-11-13 12:40:08 so like this guy over here
general 2020-11-13 12:40:31 But make it a little bit more curvier
general 2020-11-13 12:40:37 With the windscreen
general 2020-11-13 12:40:56 I did have this though
general 2020-11-13 12:41:00 The windscreen kinda bothers me
general 2020-11-13 12:41:09 Like too much s l e e k
general 2020-11-13 12:42:09 I have made nose
general 2020-11-13 12:42:11 as seen in pic
general 2020-11-13 12:42:16 that i sent
general 2020-11-13 12:43:05 yeah this I do not agree with
general 2020-11-13 12:44:34 So make plane have a distinct nose?
general 2020-11-13 12:44:52 Gru's nose
general 2020-11-13 12:45:14 As you can see a struggle beyond cone shaped noses
general 2020-11-13 12:45:26 of fighters
general 2020-11-13 12:46:06 A 🅱️lane, nothing in specific tbh
general 2020-11-13 12:46:38 Boeing X-32
general 2020-11-13 12:47:06 <@!715019067773157406> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-32
general 2020-11-13 12:47:10 Look at this plane
general 2020-11-13 12:47:43 F22 has those chines
general 2020-11-13 12:49:21 You're a flying Mazda
general 2020-11-13 12:54:57 What if the F-16 XL had F-16 VISTA technologies (thrust vectoring and advanced avionics), then was reshaped for stealth or had added canards with supercruise added on top
general 2020-11-13 13:09:50 The Boeing X-32 is a flying Mazda
general 2020-11-13 13:10:20 Canada
general 2020-11-13 13:10:23 Is that an Avro Arrow
general 2020-11-13 13:10:39 rick said wait
general 2020-11-13 13:11:04 <@!437152336176087052> The F-35 is what happens when you try to make a budget F-22
general 2020-11-13 13:11:47 The future now is Sukhoi Su-57
general 2020-11-13 13:12:18 The future is cheese
general 2020-11-13 13:13:14 The future is thrust vectored F-16XL
general 2020-11-13 13:13:31 Yes F-16XL
general 2020-11-13 13:14:00 Ferrari FF
general 2020-11-13 13:14:13 The McLaren F1 is powered by a BMW V12
general 2020-11-13 13:14:23 The British car is powered by a German engine
general 2020-11-13 13:14:40 The best car/plane obviously is Fiat
general 2020-11-13 13:15:26 Give a Fiat Abarth 124 Spider wings and you got a successor to the Fiat G91
general 2020-11-13 13:15:46 Even though the Abarth 124 is just a badge engineered Miata
general 2020-11-13 13:16:02 <@!738702049113538600> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abarth_124_Spider This is literally an Italian Mazda Miata
general 2020-11-13 13:17:38 The Abarth 124 is a high performance version of the Fiat 124 which itself is an Italian version of the Mazda Miata with some different tuning (mainly in engine and suspension) with Abarth being a Fiat owned brand, with Fiat if I remember also owning Ferrari
general 2020-11-13 13:18:13 wait nevermind FCA spun-off Ferrari
general 2020-11-13 13:18:16 Now Ferrari is independent
general 2020-11-13 13:19:05 <@!738702049113538600> Lancia used to make great cars like the Delta S4, now they make *only* this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancia_Ypsilon
general 2020-11-13 13:19:17 Average supermini
general 2020-11-13 13:19:37 Multipla's at least practical
general 2020-11-13 13:19:39 Like the Aztek
general 2020-11-13 13:19:47 Ugly yet practical
general 2020-11-13 13:21:10 This is the best McLaren https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_SLR_McLaren
general 2020-11-13 13:21:14 best mclaren
general 2020-11-13 13:21:22 is Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren
general 2020-11-13 13:21:38 <@!224513422161739776> eject to die
general 2020-11-13 13:23:47 <@!738702049113538600> What if you took the man behind the McLaren F1, and extracted his magic onto a single car

You get this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Murray_Automotive_T.50
general 2020-11-13 13:24:44 They made the Lancia <@!287779983445721088> too
general 2020-11-13 13:25:13 Why else are they named Fulvia?
general 2020-11-13 13:25:18 And likes cars also
general 2020-11-13 13:25:56 How much would you pay to get a Gordon Murray T.50?
general 2020-11-13 13:26:17 > mclaren more like mckaren
<@!444476246899032086> McDonald's

~~i like mclaren tho~~
general 2020-11-13 13:26:51 The one at the left is the closest to looking like a Group B Audi Quattro
general 2020-11-13 13:27:13 What's left is the Ford RS200 and the Lancia Delta S4 (we don't talk about the MG Metro 6R4)
general 2020-11-13 13:27:23 We need those two to complete the Group B trio
general 2020-11-13 13:27:45 The MG Metro 6R4's engine is reused in the Jaguar XJ220 if I remember
general 2020-11-13 13:27:50 But with turbochargers
general 2020-11-13 13:28:02 that's a huge aud
general 2020-11-13 13:28:16 i like em chonky
general 2020-11-13 13:28:19 some madagascar stuff
general 2020-11-13 13:28:51 The Lancia Delta S4 is what you get when you combine a turbocharger and a supercharger
general 2020-11-13 13:28:55 And then use it off-road
general 2020-11-13 13:29:40 <@!720891502108344360> Then you go slap a Cosworth engine, because those boys at Cosworth really do know *power*
general 2020-11-13 13:30:09 "One of the main selling points was the Cosworth YBT, a highly tunable turbocharged 2.0 L (1,993 cc) with a bore x stroke of 90.8 mm × 77 mm (3.57 in × 3.03 in) Inline-four engine[1][2] which had an output of 227 PS (167 kW; 224 bhp) in standard trim. Tuning companies have achieved power outputs of over 1,000 bhp (746 kW; 1,014 PS)."

*Imagine 1,000 hp rally car*
general 2020-11-13 13:32:20 What if we get the Cosworth engine from the Escort, twincharge it
general 2020-11-13 13:32:29 Then slap it onto a Lancia
general 2020-11-13 13:32:37 aw
general 2020-11-13 13:32:43 no vroomy british boi
general 2020-11-13 13:33:45 If you have a Ford, bring it to Cosworth https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosworth
general 2020-11-13 13:34:09 Apparently the people at Cosworth were former Lotus employees
general 2020-11-13 13:34:15 Lotus has good engineers
general 2020-11-13 13:35:12 Lotus + Cosworth = ???
general 2020-11-13 13:35:40 Cosworth dominated F1 with the DFV engine as I read their Wikipedia page
general 2020-11-13 13:35:58 And Lotus dominated F1 with good engineering

general 2020-11-13 13:40:14 what do you get?
general 2020-11-13 13:40:33 yes
general 2020-11-13 13:40:55 the Ariel Atom 500 V8 has 500 hp and approximately 500 kg of weight

general 2020-11-13 13:42:24 with the space, mind you
general 2020-11-13 13:42:54 Make a custom fighter, and make it as maneuverable as you can make it
general 2020-11-13 13:43:55 Make supermaneuverable/extremely agile plane
general 2020-11-13 13:44:23 Try making a plane that you can control even if it's going supersonic
general 2020-11-13 13:44:28 Like what I did
general 2020-11-13 13:45:00 Make plane that's stable even with conveyor drives
general 2020-11-13 13:45:09 One you can still pitch and roll a little bit with

general 2020-11-13 13:49:22 Almost
general 2020-11-13 13:49:37 I mean I could almost do a cobra, but it still has some change in pitch

<@!287779983445721088> I mean it shares a platform with the Fiat Punto and the Fiat 500, but with none of the benefits
general 2020-11-14 01:14:48 So apparently weight affects an aircraft
general 2020-11-14 01:15:12 And shifting the weight backwards made a plane I have be more manuverable
general 2020-11-14 01:18:52 <@!409676438682206218> Teethed fabric?

general 2020-11-14 01:55:55 Tesla and Apple stonks
general 2020-11-14 01:56:06 Because people buy them like I buy cheese

general 2020-11-14 01:59:09 Just invest into a company you'd think be good

Personally I'd buy into Tesla and Apple because people buy them like wildfires, and they just keep growing
general 2020-11-14 01:59:44 Buy their products*
general 2020-11-14 02:00:56 > apple is shit

general 2020-11-14 02:01:09 And they try to trap them into their ecosystem of products
general 2020-11-14 02:02:03 <@!409676438682206218> Just pick a job you'll end up liking or at least not regretting

general 2020-11-14 02:04:15 Remember, manufacturers of Android phones always put a skin onto Android
general 2020-11-14 02:04:25 So your fact may vary

general 2020-11-14 07:58:54 I need to inflict as much pain as possible
general 2020-11-14 08:00:36 That looks pretty McLaren F1 to me, especially with the center seat
general 2020-11-14 08:01:11 No need
general 2020-11-14 08:01:14 There's already three
general 2020-11-14 08:02:10 The McLaren F1 does have three seats
general 2020-11-14 08:02:58 oof
general 2020-11-14 08:05:02 What if Volvo made a supercar, does that mean one boxy but very safe supercar?
general 2020-11-14 08:06:13 Turned on anti-copy, now there's an invisible wall this guy has to share with
general 2020-11-14 08:06:56 I need to make a cage
general 2020-11-14 08:06:59 So nobody can escape
general 2020-11-14 08:07:02 When they share plot
general 2020-11-14 08:09:36 I'll go make a plot sharing trap
general 2020-11-14 08:09:43 So nobody can escape when they end up sharing a plot with me
general 2020-11-14 08:27:12 I'm just making a trap for when I experience another plot sharing glitch
general 2020-11-14 08:27:32 By using TNT balls to create some lag onto my prey
general 2020-11-14 08:27:40 And using ballasts to glitch out their build with weight
general 2020-11-14 08:28:13 Probably because I'm building something so insignificant
general 2020-11-14 08:30:03 How did you not notice the big glass cage
general 2020-11-14 08:30:19 Oh
general 2020-11-14 08:30:25 Guess I'm just very generic then
general 2020-11-14 08:55:38 In that case
general 2020-11-14 08:55:41 I own an Android emulator
general 2020-11-14 08:55:45 Called **Blue**stacks
general 2020-11-14 08:56:14 Bluesnacks
general 2020-11-14 08:56:20 That's just cursed
general 2020-11-14 08:56:38 Postn't it please
general 2020-11-14 08:56:51 For it is cursed
general 2020-11-14 08:56:58 That is less cursed
general 2020-11-14 08:57:17 What if McObama F1
general 2020-11-14 08:58:05 I've seen an Obama pyramid in game though

general 2020-11-14 09:00:35 Imagine using Kelvin

hot or cold best
general 2020-11-14 09:00:48 no need for fancy numbers
general 2020-11-14 09:01:00 What is 69F in celsius?
general 2020-11-14 09:01:37 69 Farenheit is 20.5556 Celsius according to Google
general 2020-11-14 09:01:41 So still kinda normal
general 2020-11-14 09:02:14 <@!546223347025969164> Americans too lazy to change to metric
general 2020-11-14 09:02:38 Even though nobody uses farenheit

general 2020-11-14 09:13:52 She's an X-32

general 2020-11-14 09:15:31 <@!467565971918422017> I'm sure they'll like Korean Rap
general 2020-11-14 09:15:32 Krap
general 2020-11-14 09:16:00 Still not as good as Thai Rap
general 2020-11-14 09:16:11 Or Chinese Rap
general 2020-11-14 09:16:23 Trap crap
general 2020-11-14 09:16:50 American rap is Arap
general 2020-11-14 09:17:02 Canadian rap is Crap
general 2020-11-14 09:17:47 Your mother is a phater jet, always fighting fat
general 2020-11-14 09:18:24 <@!536013994188865554> Virtua Racing has a Sega 32X port
general 2020-11-14 09:18:37 And Kega Fusion exists
general 2020-11-14 09:19:09 Kega Fusion should emulate SG-1000, Mark III, Master System, Genesis, 32X and CD
general 2020-11-14 09:19:27 Or was it 3000, I forgot
general 2020-11-14 09:19:36 But yes anything pre-Saturn should work
general 2020-11-14 09:19:46 Well, guess you gotta use MAME
general 2020-11-14 09:19:56 Also, somehow Retroarch cannot use .pce files
general 2020-11-14 09:20:03 So no PC Engine/Turbografx games for me
general 2020-11-14 09:20:27 Or maybe I got the wrong core
general 2020-11-14 09:20:43 I usually try to find home ports first
general 2020-11-14 09:20:48 Because I'm too lazy to setup MAME
general 2020-11-14 09:21:10 How *lame* of me
general 2020-11-14 09:21:27 We're talking about retro stuff
general 2020-11-14 09:21:33 Mostly emulation
general 2020-11-14 09:22:23 https://www.retroarch.com/ pretty much an easy way of getting into emulation
general 2020-11-14 09:22:31 if anyone's interested
general 2020-11-14 09:23:27 It's pretty easy to setup, until you get to arcade games
general 2020-11-14 09:24:20 
general 2020-11-14 09:24:20 
general 2020-11-14 09:24:20 
general 2020-11-14 09:24:24 There's a lot of platforms you can run it from
general 2020-11-14 09:24:28 So yeah
general 2020-11-14 09:24:36 Easy to setup, and very multiplatform
general 2020-11-14 09:25:02 
general 2020-11-14 09:25:03 
general 2020-11-14 09:25:09 Okay that's a lot of platforms
general 2020-11-14 09:26:31 I organize mine into whatever company they came from
general 2020-11-14 09:26:33 Then the consoles
general 2020-11-14 09:26:35 Then the ROMs
general 2020-11-14 09:26:43 With an added alphabetical arrangement
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 09:28:59 <@!536013994188865554> http://www.lakka.tv/
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 09:29:03 If this went along with KODI
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 09:29:08 Then it would be perfect
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 09:30:10 Oh crap this isn't general
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 09:30:33 I'll move
general 2020-11-14 09:30:53 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodi_(software) This, along with Lakka OS, would go along pretty nicely in something like Raspberry Pi 400
general 2020-11-14 10:28:37 Who said you were cool in the first plsce
general 2020-11-14 10:29:20 Nope, don't know anything about arcades tbh
general 2020-11-14 10:29:44 Why yes indeed /s
general 2020-11-14 10:30:27 If you want a flinger, go get something really heavy and make it go fast
general 2020-11-14 10:31:02 Yeah it is crap
general 2020-11-14 10:31:40 I've had better results with an ugly tank
general 2020-11-14 10:31:47 It looks slow, but it'll fling you
general 2020-11-14 10:33:01 That's just
general 2020-11-14 10:33:45 That's even worse than tutorial build
general 2020-11-14 10:34:19 Everyone knows Bimak is Cheese
general 2020-11-14 10:34:29 Now eat him
general 2020-11-14 10:34:55 Yummy cheese ship in my tummy
general 2020-11-14 10:35:08 It's oozing cheddar sauce from its engines
general 2020-11-14 10:35:21 ***burn***
general 2020-11-14 10:35:49 Even my three folder jumbo jet looks better than that
general 2020-11-14 10:36:12 And its literally a flying block
general 2020-11-14 10:36:58 You have mustard gassed it
general 2020-11-14 10:37:42 What if every ship is cheese
general 2020-11-14 10:37:56 The Brits would've won with Walls and Grumm
general 2020-11-14 10:38:01 They eat chez
general 2020-11-14 10:38:49 Wacky light car
general 2020-11-14 10:39:00 Seriously thats a lot of lights
general 2020-11-14 10:39:23 I have now realized what it is
general 2020-11-14 10:39:31 And I can say it actually looks decent
general 2020-11-14 10:39:42 <@456226577798135808> Mine's for the motor locking
general 2020-11-14 10:40:31 No
general 2020-11-14 10:40:36 Because half blocks are ladders
general 2020-11-14 10:40:56 <@536013994188865554> Intimidate undes with hypermanuverability
general 2020-11-14 10:41:08 Try stacking half blocks in build mode
general 2020-11-14 10:41:13 Doesn't it look like a ladder
general 2020-11-14 10:41:33 O h
general 2020-11-14 10:41:37 Now I see
general 2020-11-14 10:42:38 <@536013994188865554> Make an unde pull off a kulbit but strictly within the length of their own aircraft 

They can't
general 2020-11-14 10:42:45 Maple and I have done it though
general 2020-11-14 10:43:34 A Kulbit is just a really tight loop
general 2020-11-14 10:43:49 Lucky you
general 2020-11-14 11:26:57 r o o m
general 2020-11-14 11:27:02 room for an IWB
general 2020-11-14 11:27:28 Other than a motor locked bomb, can't think up of anything else
general 2020-11-14 11:27:40 This would make this into a fighter-bomber if I carry bombs inside
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:30:39 > https://gyazo.com/7201d772d5029d907d925ef6d791983d
<@!723419054114865202> So is that what a sparkler is
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:31:01 I really need to learn how to make 5th generation noses without making an A-10 nose
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:31:32 I've sorta made a 5th generation fighter nose
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:32:03 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/767197771425120266/RobloxScreenShot20201018_092344978.png
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:32:04 nose
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:32:11 but kinda thicc
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:32:40 Because canopies are what I'm lazy at
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:32:58 Which is why I tend to resort to poob bubble canopy
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:33:45 look at how poo my canopy is
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:34:00 Because I'm too lazy to actually build one
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:34:43 I'm using half wedges
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:34:47 To make a bubble canopy
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:36:18 I could do better but this'll do
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:36:24 At least the top isn't sharp
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:37:58 1 block wide nose skinny
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:38:14 Personally I find 1 block noses too low effort
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:38:24 Two blocks I can agree
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:38:33 3 blocks is better than 1 block, at least there's some effort
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:39:10 Well at least it isn't skinny nose
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:39:26 I'm just agreeing
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:39:31 With anything at this point
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:40:49 https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/strike-eagle.gif
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:41:00 Got a Strike Eagle
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:41:14 And it'd look weird if canopy is same width as nose
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:41:40 yes they will
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:41:54 I also prefer if I can get in and out
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:42:51 what do i put in an iwb (internal weapons bay)
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:43:10 That's assuming I can make a weapns bay door in the first place
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:43:33 Fighter-bomber jet
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:46:12 Well multirole fighter

<@!527092191189925918> tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:47:51 Loops look kinda weird when the imaginary center point is your avatar
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:48:03 Like your avatar is just pinned there while the entire plane is doing a loop
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:48:44 I think I've done enough trying to get the best out of pitch
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:49:23 I'll go figure out how I'll design IWB doors on the lock tower with this much space
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:50:22 Tank Fish's Raptor at this point is an obvious tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:50:47 Alongside Thailand's copycat Harrier and Ren's tutorial fighter
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:50:56 Tutorial fighter with straight wing
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:51:06 Seriously that thing has minimal delta
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:51:55 If you want unde to stop begging you
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:52:01 Show them your superior build
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:52:40 At that point I'll just say "poob tutorial user" and server hop
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:53:42 I'll go assign my bomb to the keybind X
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:53:49 As in e**x**terminate
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:54:45 How does one explain you can't give money online that easily
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:57:28 to some random kid
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 11:58:38 <@!536013994188865554> What annoys me more are those people who ask for free rides
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:00:09 I usually seal mine too
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:00:12 Even in build mode
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:00:23 So that's one advantage of using simplified canopies
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:00:48 
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:00:49 As you can see, sealed by design
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:01:20 The only way to solicit in is with parachute glitching
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:05:00 done
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:05:03 added some bay doors
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:05:25 Me neither, I just set it to either 100 or 0
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:06:06 Plane Crazy's not a racing sim or a simcade so I don't know what's damping for
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:06:36 > excuse me, who made this vehicle?
<@!527092191189925918> Looks like some apocalypse vehicle toy that got discountinued
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:08:22 If only the doors were hinged at the edge, not like this
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:08:53 Wait
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:08:59 Why is the green screen not behind him
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:09:03 Or the camera
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:09:13 They're in the wrong place
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:09:37 Upon closer inspection it was right
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:09:45 I was wrong
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:12:17 stick bombs
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:12:26 What are those hand thrown explosives
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:12:31 That I can best describe as
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:12:38 "explosives on a stick"
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:12:55 I forgot what those are called
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:13:06 If I remember, is of European origin
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:13:10 Or Russian
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:13:47 Is Russia considered European, Asian or Eurasian
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:15:00 a ok
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:15:17 How to spell
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:15:19 Get a spellbook
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:15:25 Get your spelling stuff there
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:18:21 I've seen that rocket
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:18:23 Too many times
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:18:40 That's now a tutorial rocket
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:18:57 <@!661550706511314944> No it's a tutorial pen with external ink tanks
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:19:44 Hmm, what's next to add
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:19:47 After IWB
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:19:49 VTOL?
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:21:15 <@!403843930543882241> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_C-130_Hercules
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:21:22 According to Wikipedia, it says the Philippines operates it
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:21:33 so we operate it I guess
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:21:51 typical
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:22:58 Doritos
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:23:11 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruffles
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:23:12 i want this
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:25:13 bigboi plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:25:49 I just work with this size
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:27:37 thanks
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:27:53 With enough room I might actually add VTOL
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:28:09 First time that I combined an IWB with VTOL
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:29:06 Being bombarded with what?
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:29:12 VTOL is for lazy people like me
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:29:17 Who can't bother moving
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:29:56 Besides I can flex that I managed to add VTOL and an IWB to your non PCC player
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:30:38 We are being bombarded with Mig fighters
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:30:50 Kill what
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:30:54 The Migs or the shredders
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:33:37 best alex
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:33:43 literal alex with a mustache
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:34:18 Every skin has no gender
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:34:21 They can't reproduce
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:34:58 You're gonna take it OOC aren't you
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:35:46 Aircraft too heavy for VTOL
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:36:11 <@!707991071476547745> It's a V-tail plane isn't it?
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:36:29 Aka ruddervators
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:36:39 Rudder + elevator
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:37:05 I mean
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:37:14 You could add leading edge extensions
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:37:20 Basically flaps at the front
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:38:32 I forgot you can divide the flaps into two
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:38:36 Sorta like on a delta wing
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:38:39 Like the Mirage
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:38:56 I just realized my plane too fat
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:39:07 Too much weight for VTOL
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:39:14 So I can only do STOVL
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:39:20 Short takeoff and vertical landing
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:41:08 <@!403843930543882241> I mean CTOL's still a thing
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:41:15 Conventional take-off and landing
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:41:24 I'm guessing it has to be really short
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:41:29 But not VTOL short
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:41:39 To show people how to do stuff
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:41:58 Unless it's a tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:42:06 In which in that case how are you gonna learn from copying a whole plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:42:18 Watch a tutorial for a part
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:42:36 yes tutorial pvp planes are bad
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:42:50 Unless they actually teach you how a plane works
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:42:57 Like how wing placement is important when designing a plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:43:07 Or the placement of weight affects it too
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:43:21 Usually, I shift the weight to the rear so it'll pitch good
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:43:45 A plane can be hard to hit given enough speed
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:43:59 Agility is also important
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:47:05 The R word is also not allowed, it's a slur relating to intelligence
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:48:04 The closest word it rhymes with is Reddited
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:49:20 Not enough thrust in the front
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:49:22 needs more engines
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:52:21 oh neat it's a claw machine
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:53:04 c l a w
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:53:13 why yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:53:20 rick in the background, mad in the foreground
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:55:01 That looks like a Harrier tried to be a 5th generation fighter
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:56:39 Why do I keep seeing that nose
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:57:09 <@!527092191189925918> There's actually a box plane from the US
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:57:17 I forgot the name
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 12:57:25 But it definitely is boxy
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:06:08 I'm forced to use CTOL
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:06:15 Can't even do STOVL
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:06:27 But I want VTOL
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:07:34 My fighter jet currently is almost finished
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:07:42 Now my fighter needs weaponry
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:10:28 They put coffee creamer in your milk
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:10:42 Do not cream what's already creamy
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:10:58 Just like how you shouldn't drown pizza in ketchup
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:11:21 Shredder user
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:11:32 Because you didn't say how often I should use shredder
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:11:40 Could be just once in my life
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:14:04 If planes could talk, would a B2 call a B-32 a *boomer* plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:14:14 Boomer bomber
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:14:36 That surely can be taken out of context
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:14:41 Both messages
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:15:05 It has a thing sticking out
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:15:07 What is that
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:15:42 The plane is a dragon
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:15:44 It opens mouth
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:15:46 It goes pew
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:15:52 Plane is dragon
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:15:56 Because it opens mouth to go pew
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:16:30 wait
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:16:33 make a fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:16:37 but it looks like a dragon
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:16:54 Supersonic dragon
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:17:15 yes make jetgon
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:17:18 as an actual build
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:18:21 Jetgon is good
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:18:35 <@!718006867808485447> How about this, cyborg but dragon
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:18:44 so supersonic dragon fighter
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 13:18:47 is actually dragon
general 2020-11-14 13:51:00 My brother joined this today
https://www.roblox.com/lilnasxconcert
general 2020-11-14 13:51:20 Honestly I'm happy he isn't listening to K-pop or liking Fortnite
general 2020-11-14 13:51:40 He could do worse tbh
general 2020-11-14 13:52:00 Korean Pop
general 2020-11-14 13:52:20 It's just pop but you can't understand a thing, and it's filled with eye candy
general 2020-11-14 13:52:46 Yes, it's too much so it hurts
general 2020-11-14 13:54:01 Honestly my brother just does his own thing, he knows he's not gonna get into a real concert
general 2020-11-14 13:54:08 So he isn't disappointed
general 2020-11-14 13:56:44 Honestly I'm fine with him listening to Lil Nas X

Because I feel like he could do better
general 2020-11-14 13:57:06 With K-pop though I feel like there'd be no hope
general 2020-11-14 13:57:09 Just gonna be addicted to it
general 2020-11-14 13:57:26 There's three types of people
general 2020-11-14 13:57:41 - Good tastes
- Bad tastes, but saveable
- Bad taste cannot be saved
general 2020-11-14 13:57:54 K-pop falls into the third category
general 2020-11-14 13:58:15 Lil Nas falls into the 2nd category, you can still save people from it
general 2020-11-14 13:58:30 And it can be bearable, but not something you'd willingly listen to
general 2020-11-14 13:59:50 I don't listen to music often
general 2020-11-14 13:59:59 But I dunno if my picks are good or not
general 2020-11-14 14:00:28 Usually into rock and electronic
general 2020-11-14 14:00:39 And game OSTs
general 2020-11-14 14:01:19 <@!536013994188865554> Speaking of game OSTs, one of my favorites being After Burner from the game After Burner
general 2020-11-14 14:01:26 A Sega arcade game
general 2020-11-14 14:02:41 Tbh there's one version of it that really takes it too much
general 2020-11-14 14:04:35 <@!536013994188865554> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yThbMcxNf-E&list=PLirSddeMOYZ5x66nKRmo6zTTeGtzh18g1&index=8
general 2020-11-14 14:04:41 This is the version I was talking about
general 2020-11-14 14:04:50 That really takes it maybe a bit too much
general 2020-11-14 14:05:24 Literal name of this track is After Burner
general 2020-11-14 14:05:44 Everything else has their own names though
general 2020-11-14 14:06:04 Yes, they went a bit too much
general 2020-11-14 14:06:05 With this
general 2020-11-14 14:07:02 Tbh I like Sega's OSTs
general 2020-11-14 14:07:19 I forgot this exists https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.T._Band
general 2020-11-14 14:08:21 Sega hits it just right when they do it
general 2020-11-14 14:08:28 But the Sega CD version
general 2020-11-14 14:08:35 Not exactly a full-on Sega job
general 2020-11-14 14:52:42 Pistons in general are buggy to begin with
general 2020-11-14 14:53:00 Use suspension + rope if it's for damping
general 2020-11-14 14:53:18 Even though pistons are pretty good at being landing gear damping
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 14:55:29 What else do I need to add on a 4.5 generation fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 14:55:54 Apart from better roll
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 14:58:27 Well, added an internal bomb
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 14:58:54 Guess I can add hardpoints for missiles
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 14:58:58 And guns
general 2020-11-14 15:00:31 > oh, so you like plane crazy? name every block
general 2020-11-14 15:00:59 There's tiny and small landing gear
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 15:02:29 Already did
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 15:02:45 Still can have it in Non-PvP for decorational purposes
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 15:03:20 I added a motor locked TNT bomb in an internal weapons bay
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 15:03:42 <@467765396108476426> wait whag
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 15:03:50 Alexa ship is real?
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 15:07:19 <@730808827234091041> Should I just do decorational missiles
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 15:07:25 I never go to PvP anywayd
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 15:07:47 Rendering sucks
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 15:08:02 So might as well focus on looks
general 2020-11-14 15:10:12 I'll go do it tomorrow then
general 2020-11-14 15:10:17 November 15th
general 2020-11-14 15:10:37 It's 11:10 PM, Nov 4 here
general 2020-11-14 15:11:40 Nov 14
general 2020-11-14 15:11:47 My brain just farded
general 2020-11-14 15:12:37 Honestly Adopt Me kinda boring once you're rich
general 2020-11-14 15:12:45 Or have something worth flexing
general 2020-11-14 15:12:59 And its just a grindfest
general 2020-11-14 15:13:43 I have a flying rideable Frost Dragon there
general 2020-11-14 15:13:49 I mean I like dragons
general 2020-11-14 15:14:00 But it was a gift
general 2020-11-14 15:14:06 From a very generous rich guy
general 2020-11-14 15:14:09 Who likes football
general 2020-11-14 15:14:28 He was a nice unde
general 2020-11-14 15:14:35 Or not unde
general 2020-11-14 15:14:37 Not sure
general 2020-11-14 15:15:24 I decided to satisfy my liking for dragons some game else
general 2020-11-14 15:15:51 <#498473314445033472>

general 2020-11-15 01:23:32 Thing looks like suspension
general 2020-11-15 01:23:44 Thai rappers are traps
general 2020-11-15 01:23:51 T-rap
general 2020-11-15 01:33:26 <@409676438682206218> Sounds like you're making some sort of racing suspension
general 2020-11-15 01:34:23 Rally car with ***Bose***™️ magnetic suspension
general 2020-11-15 01:34:51 Nobody gives a shit
general 2020-11-15 01:35:47 Those are some paper thin wheels
general 2020-11-15 01:36:53 Huh, I just noticed creative has a Protogen PFP
general 2020-11-15 01:37:13 I'm just happy with my plane
general 2020-11-15 01:38:09 Go make him prove his age
general 2020-11-15 01:38:12 He's kinda sus

<@!251880826386513924> it's just casually supporting itself on it's back landing gear and engines
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:18:01 Which is kinda weird
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:18:14 I couldn't even do STOVL
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:18:27 I have thrust reversal at least
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:20:23 Sounds like an Osprey
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:20:58 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Boeing_V-22_Osprey
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:22:56 I have no idea how I'll add custom landing gear in front of this
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:23:23 It does have some form of suspension
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:23:28 But it's just a very basic trailing arm

plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:36:48 Well, I wouldn't downvote that monster truck, but it certainly could do a little better
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:36:57 I might upvote
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:37:18 Kinda bothered it doesn't have independent suspension

please tell me that isn't another siren head thing
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:38:11 Good
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:38:18 My ears are still traumatized by sirenhead
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:38:37 My upvote record is on a plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:39:05 Sounds like a swing axle suspension
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:39:20 Or a solid axle
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:39:51 I'll try finding the build I got most upvotes for
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:41:00 This is the build I got most upvotes from https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/767197771928829962

plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:42:21 I forgot Designer V required 60
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:43:39 The paint bothers me
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:43:52 It gives me that kids vibe
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:44:39 Why is it every time I see a blue angels plane it usually ends up having too bright of a blue and yellow
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:45:57 I feel like the default yellow could be toned down a bit
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:46:00 Just a little bit
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:48:09 https://streamable.com/6bm9ib I hate this
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:48:35 Why must it wanna point up
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:50:12 Can't move it back, rudders in the way
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 05:50:37 And kinda don't wanna do forward facing landing gears because I'm also using it as suspension
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:05:55 It would be neat to see an engine be used as a source of power
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:10:04 this is weird
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:10:12 but better than no landing gear at all
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:10:43 I'm gonna go tune it so it doesn't end up pointing up like some weird gun
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:11:36 because p i n g
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:12:35 A flying rube goldberg machine
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:12:47 I already suggested a supersonic dragon to someone yesterday
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:23:02 <@!447221768520859659> Is it bad I'm wasting time on a pair of rear landing gears
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:24:39 Not atm
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:25:02 
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:25:14 I'm frustrated that it keeps wanting to point up
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:25:20 Or just not support it's own weight at all
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:26:29 There's 8 ballasts at the back
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:26:36 Located in these nozzles
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:26:46 Which I use to make it pitch faster
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:27:03 Now they're causing problems
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:27:38 So STOVL isn't a thing
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:27:43 And landing gears just want to die
general 2020-11-15 06:28:53 I'm in a public server that has no people in it
general 2020-11-15 06:54:57 I think I've made my plane not safe to land at low speeds
general 2020-11-15 06:55:15 Because without enough speed it'll initiate pitching up on it's own
general 2020-11-15 06:55:22 Considering how much weight is at the rear
general 2020-11-15 07:02:36 <@!484529511468236802> It looks like they enslaved Ernie

I'm honestly giving up on fixing this
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:09:31 It already has too much pitch
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:09:43 You know that GIF Maple posted
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:09:45 It does that
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:09:51 The weird loop
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:10:15 My planes are just interceptors trying to be fighters xp
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:11:14 I've figured out a way to increase roll, but that involves adding motor 2s onto the main flaps
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:11:22 Which would've made it unstable at high speeds
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:11:32 Which means I cannot do the weird half-loop
general 2020-11-15 07:12:04 How fast do planes roll usually in PC
general 2020-11-15 07:12:16 Oh yeah

general 2020-11-15 10:41:07 Give him the McNuggets
general 2020-11-15 11:34:43 How to canard
general 2020-11-15 11:34:52 Because I only know one good looking canard
general 2020-11-15 11:35:12 
general 2020-11-15 11:35:15 looking a bit smol
general 2020-11-15 11:35:40 I will extend a little

general 2020-11-15 11:36:53 because ***m a n***
general 2020-11-15 11:37:22 Guess I should try aiming for about 1/3 to 1/2-ish size of main wing
general 2020-11-15 11:37:29 Or something
general 2020-11-15 11:41:23 can ard
general 2020-11-15 11:41:27 <@!546223347025969164> yes
general 2020-11-15 11:41:38 Spike-ard
general 2020-11-15 11:41:46 Should I reshape the canard
general 2020-11-15 11:41:59 The Chinese have their own jets
general 2020-11-15 11:42:08 Okay, what shape should I try
general 2020-11-15 11:42:35 J-20 canard looks like a mini delta wing
general 2020-11-15 11:42:43 I shall take note of that
general 2020-11-15 11:43:10 https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/J20_4.png
general 2020-11-15 11:43:15 It kinda does
general 2020-11-15 11:43:22 But it's slightly kinked inwards
general 2020-11-15 11:43:39 This blueprint is meant to be zoomed in
general 2020-11-15 11:44:18 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenyang_FC-31
general 2020-11-15 11:44:27 Doesn't this look *familiar*
general 2020-11-15 11:44:44 And slapped an F-22/35-ish body
general 2020-11-15 11:45:24 Looking at the FC-31, it does look like some sort of F-22/F-35 knockoff
general 2020-11-15 11:45:44 Leaning more onto F-35
general 2020-11-15 11:46:02 Okay it's just a blatant ripoff of the F-35
general 2020-11-15 11:46:45 Remember the Soviet Union birthed you
general 2020-11-15 11:50:31 China did the economy because they embraced capitalism

plane-crazy 2020-11-15 11:51:25 Left or right canard?
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 11:51:50 Nothing in specific
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 11:52:10 Tell me what needs to be done
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 11:52:15 To the one on the left
general 2020-11-15 11:53:33 I feel like China and the USA are the current "at the extreme edge of politics" if I have to be honest
general 2020-11-15 11:53:40 China's too strict and the USA is just...
general 2020-11-15 11:53:42 I dunno

plane-crazy 2020-11-15 11:54:09 <@!251880826386513924> Then compare it to the canard of an existing aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 11:54:59 I mean I could also do trapezoidal canards
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 11:55:02 Instead of delta canard
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 11:55:14 Or remove it kinking inwards a little
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 11:55:50 ~~For the elevators I just made it a smaller version of the main wing~~
general 2020-11-15 11:59:44 describe what kind of reshaping is needed

general 2020-11-15 12:02:07 Should I do X-36 canards
general 2020-11-15 12:02:12 Or still keep delta canards
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 12:05:29 Okay
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 12:05:30 I'm not even sure anymore
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 12:05:39 Whether I did the canards right or not
general 2020-11-15 13:34:44 Eh
general 2020-11-15 13:35:36 Could reshape it a little better
general 2020-11-15 13:35:56 Otherwise it just looks like a generic nose intake plane
general 2020-11-15 13:36:51 Tan is giving me them suspicious vibes
general 2020-11-15 13:37:36 Should we ask a mod to unde check Tan
general 2020-11-15 13:38:12 Or maybe that's just how he talks
general 2020-11-15 13:38:37 I see some resemblance

general 2020-11-15 13:43:29 At best just some basic no brainer ones

general 2020-11-15 23:00:57 Usually I avoid ballasts since it causes more problems for me

general 2020-11-15 23:07:40 I mean it's not unexpected, the Nintendo Switch uses the ARM architecture, which is what most mobile devices use
general 2020-11-16 00:35:02 Which can work as an alternative to sparklers for guns?

general 2020-11-16 00:59:26 Stop sending Pi
general 2020-11-16 00:59:42 I'll go Google it instead
general 2020-11-16 00:59:51 Chat is very active
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 01:35:59 Hmm, I should add landing gear doors considering I have the room for it
general 2020-11-16 01:37:25 I didn't even know you guys had those conditions
general 2020-11-16 01:38:03 <@239052650446979082> Wet water, sounds like a brine pool
general 2020-11-16 01:38:37 Brine pools are just very salty water

general 2020-11-16 01:39:39 <@615356321340063784> Did you keep any notes locally?
general 2020-11-16 01:40:20 When I was a child I was a big crybaby
general 2020-11-16 01:40:46 ~~hmm maybe my stupidity is just my way of coping with how fucked up real life is~~
general 2020-11-16 01:41:05 <@430394898726780940> No I meant literally crying almost everyday
general 2020-11-16 01:41:16 Even in elementary
general 2020-11-16 01:42:00 It's easy to make me angry, just pull enough of your bullshit and you'll have a megaphone
general 2020-11-16 01:42:26 My classmates can be best described as the "bullshit fake monke machine"
general 2020-11-16 01:43:20 My classmates have crippling hopelessness
general 2020-11-16 01:43:36 So I'm glad the leader of the "dumb-dumb clan" finally went to a public school
general 2020-11-16 01:44:53 Gave no pity to the one whose house burnt down, they were pretty shit anyways
general 2020-11-16 01:45:04 Didn't treat me like a real person
general 2020-11-16 01:45:06 Just some toy
general 2020-11-16 01:45:31 > I'm best over the interney
<@260797229068058634> A lot of people are
general 2020-11-16 01:45:36 Though some shouldn't
general 2020-11-16 01:45:45 Who says "HAHAHAHA" online?
general 2020-11-16 01:46:13 An online friend is nice
general 2020-11-16 01:46:27 I just find a place I could fit in
general 2020-11-16 01:46:32 And this is why I'm still a furry
general 2020-11-16 01:46:44 I need friends to cope with stress
general 2020-11-16 01:47:43 Yes
general 2020-11-16 01:48:18 <@260797229068058634> That's understandable, they're pretty weird at times
general 2020-11-16 01:49:52 <@670491329905557544> What the fuck are you talking about I don't even know you
general 2020-11-16 01:50:57 I honestly find "Hahaha" to be not really sincere
general 2020-11-16 01:54:31 Is ice slippery by nature or is the condensed water making it slippery?
general 2020-11-16 01:55:25 I mean water makes things wet
general 2020-11-16 01:56:05 Dry ice is solid gas
general 2020-11-16 01:56:26 Huh
general 2020-11-16 01:56:33 That's one way of putting it
general 2020-11-16 01:57:06 <@322970944303923200> Is ice naturally slippery or is it the water making it slippery
general 2020-11-16 01:57:54 Covered and surrounded have differences, I think it's solid
general 2020-11-16 01:58:10 So I can see being underwater is not wet
general 2020-11-16 01:59:59 <@430394898726780940> Grab the definition of saturated
general 2020-11-16 02:02:27 So if an object is wet, it means it's covered or saturated (as in holding water like a sponge) with a liquid but not necessarily surrounded as in the case of swimming
general 2020-11-16 02:04:31 Let me read Wikipedia, because I can't spend an entire hour reading a scientific articles
general 2020-11-16 02:06:51 **Wetting** - "Wetting is the ability of a liquid to maintain contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together."

**Moisture** - "Moisture is the presence of a liquid, especially water, often in trace amounts. Small amounts of water may be found, for example, in the air (humidity), in foods, and in some commercial products. Moisture also refers to the amount of water vapor present in the air."

*Let's agree on one thing though, water is water stop arguing*
general 2020-11-16 02:08:39 <@322970944303923200> So by Wikipedia's definition, if it means only liquid maintaining contact with a **solid** surface, and nothing else, then you are right
general 2020-11-16 02:09:26 So water isn't wet by itself, as it only has itself to make it wet even though its not a solid surface
general 2020-11-16 02:10:32 So if it's wet, liquids are making solid contact on it and its a solid object
general 2020-11-16 02:10:41 But water is not a solid object
general 2020-11-16 02:10:44 It is a liquid
general 2020-11-16 02:11:25 Puri and Tsunami should settle this, they're the experts of liquids
general 2020-11-16 02:11:28 I mean it's in their name
general 2020-11-16 03:40:16 Would it work to use an all-moving rudder as an airbrake
general 2020-11-16 03:47:36 https://embed.rauf.wtf/infinite+bobux?&image=https://tenor.com/bqtE6.gif&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0
general 2020-11-16 03:47:44 oof it didn't display
general 2020-11-16 03:47:56 i need a gif that works
general 2020-11-16 03:48:23 otherwise enjoy funny rickroll man
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 03:57:53 rudder airbrake
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:06:22 01111001 01101111 01110101 01110010 00100000 01101101 01101111 01110100 01101000 01100101 01110010
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:08:18 Did a test flight and the rudder speed brakes work as intended
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:08:26 ~~maybe with some help from thrust reversal~~
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:10:24 This wing configuration so far is doing better in using purely a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:10:40 Still can do Maple's weird loop, imrproved roll and braking
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:11:07 <@!251880826386513924> Rick should so we don't have to constantly go to Google
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:11:55 That's not wrong
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:12:12 so poob is literally dark orange
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:12:27 So when you drink OJ it becomes darker
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:12:32 When it comes out of you
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:13:15 Orange poob
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:13:26 Is it saying poop is orange or oranges are shit tasting
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:17:22 Are we controlled by a mushy parasite or are we piloting a skeletal mech
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:34:17 https://streamable.com/54fn9n a test flight
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:34:39 m a n e u v e r a b i l i t y
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:35:59 There's barely any super rockets
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:36:04 Only two for thrust reversal
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:36:26 100% of the power comes from a single conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:37:27 Still has some features I'd like to add
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:38:11 - Fully recessed landing gears
- VTOL or at least STOVL
- Internal weapons bay/bomb bay
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 04:38:30 No ballasts this time
general 2020-11-16 04:46:44 I usually use springs over TNT for motor lock delay
general 2020-11-16 04:47:01 I like being able to use my aircraft in public non-PvP
general 2020-11-16 04:47:55 but spring barely consumes any space
general 2020-11-16 04:48:25 and it completely pops off
general 2020-11-16 04:50:16 I just place the springs in the gaps that isn't the center
general 2020-11-16 04:50:20 I usually place them on their side
general 2020-11-16 04:50:34 Make them break weld and pop goes the spring

general 2020-11-16 05:05:53 It looks like it wanna take over the world
general 2020-11-16 05:06:22 My ears are in pain listening to my classmate's Christmas video
general 2020-11-16 05:06:33 It feels like a disaster of instruments
general 2020-11-16 05:06:43 Like an unorganized band
general 2020-11-16 05:06:47 The singing is fine

general 2020-11-16 05:11:38 I do know what weird dreams are
general 2020-11-16 05:11:55 Like how does one travel down an escalator at car speeds while still standing up and not feeling any wind
general 2020-11-16 05:12:13 Made slightly worse by how it's a stepless escalator
general 2020-11-16 05:12:57 It's also long escalator, like thinking about it, it's like a mall for giants
general 2020-11-16 05:13:04 Yet everything is normal sized
general 2020-11-16 05:13:12 Giant sized height but somehow everything else is normal sized
general 2020-11-16 05:13:43 basically lots of room between ceiling and floor
general 2020-11-16 05:13:45 for some reason
general 2020-11-16 05:14:02 <@456226577798135808> What if you cover yourself with blankets and a pillow
general 2020-11-16 05:14:16 Become Black Panther cocoon
general 2020-11-16 05:15:05 get big blanket
general 2020-11-16 05:15:09 and then spread it
general 2020-11-16 05:16:02 But what if the sleep paralysis demon is smol
general 2020-11-16 05:16:12 So the demon enters the hole
general 2020-11-16 05:16:27 What if it's just a friend that looks scary
general 2020-11-16 05:17:03 But fr cover yourself up until your chest, and cover your head with a pillow, even if you're not holding it
general 2020-11-16 05:17:57 > <@!289930922655088640> the spd that I have is long and slanky and it crawls on my ceiling and just states directly into my eyes
<@456226577798135808> So like some sort of very long lizard?
general 2020-11-16 05:18:44 I've had during childhood but the demon wasn't there
general 2020-11-16 05:18:57 And it was only one or two times
general 2020-11-16 05:19:23 The closest I'll get to a nightmare are weird dreams

plane-crazy 2020-11-16 05:49:01 I wonder what'd be a good beginner engine to build
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 05:55:16 I said engine, not gears
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 05:56:34 Steam engine, V8, Inline 4, rotary engine, Wankel engine, boxer engine, etc.
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 05:56:35 Not parts

plane-crazy 2020-11-16 06:02:00 Btw you can't use helium
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 06:02:13 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 06:02:30 Use the screwdriver tool to find helium, because helium actually has some settings
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 06:11:52 Add rockets in front
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 06:11:58 Or other means of thrust
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 06:12:22 Or if you want ballasts but I prefer avoiding that until it's absolutely necessary

plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:00:26 I think the physics throttling is affecting the pitch of my plane

plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:02:03 I need the pitch sharpness
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:03:25 Max angle's already at 45
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:03:36 It went from being able to do Maple's funny loop to just regular loop
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:04:06 On another note, managed to add recessed gears that recess into the body itself
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:04:29 also more bomb room
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:04:33 And no, the front barely has anything
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:04:52 Other than some wings to straighten flight a bit
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:05:10 Discord being glitchy on Firefox today
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:05:44 I never use helium
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:05:49 Ballasts only when necessary
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:06:02 But helium is a block I never use due to how unnatural it is
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:06:35 It flies straight mostly, with negligible lean
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:07:09 The more stuff I added the more I noticed it seems to have reduced in pitch
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:08:14 I don't know why, though I am on an AMD A8-7600 with an HD6670 if low end specs also cause problems
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:08:24 Again I don't do helium
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:08:56 > i dont like helium cause gravity barely effects it
<@!447221768520859659> For me it's because it's just too unnatural to put on a plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:10:08 Heliums don't really work well, you don't just shove a bunch of balloons into a fighter like in the movie Up
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:10:42 I prefer working around with the weight and wing placement of aircraft, at least it's more natural
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:12:38 
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:12:39 
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:12:48 Well, I added the gears at least
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:12:55 This time a proper set of gears
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:13:34 > i just balance my plane with motorlocked wings or ballasts
<@!447221768520859659> Exactly what I do
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:14:08 For weight I usually prefer it to avoid going at the front
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:14:33 For roll, I sorta made the whole flap on the main wing an aileron
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:14:56 Because yes I can
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:15:20 Otherwise I find compromises if it's in my usual delta-canard config
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:15:48 I just casually take off from my plot
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:16:01 With the short runway
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:16:07 Along it's width
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:16:22 Not it's length, because yes I'm lazy
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:17:29 I add landing gear at least on the front
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:17:34 Even if it's just default landing gear
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:17:56 I'm trying to add better landing gear though
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:18:06 I'm adding a front one so the plane points up a bit
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:18:28 I really hope these rudders also work as airbrakes
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:18:59 ew
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:19:12 I'm planning to add VTOL, or at least STOVL
general 2020-11-16 22:21:37 Yes ropes do make suspension adjustable
general 2020-11-16 22:22:32 Wait why are those gears asymmetric
general 2020-11-16 22:23:21 I just realized one of them's lowered
general 2020-11-16 22:23:36 Wut
general 2020-11-16 22:24:29 Anything that's not painfully bright

plane-crazy 2020-11-17 04:18:25 https://streamable.com/yp2hr5 Another test flight of a severely physics throttled fighter jet, would've been faster and had sharper steering if it weren't for the throttling.
help 2020-11-17 04:29:31 https://streamable.com/yp2hr5 Been testing some stuff, though any advice on how to reduce physics throttling
help 2020-11-17 04:29:46 I need that speed and steering sharpness
general 2020-11-17 04:39:22 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_YF-23 Having motor 2 locking and multiple keybinds would've been useful for this kind of plane
general 2020-11-17 04:41:37 But in seriousness, how would a V-tail work effectively without multiple keybinds and those angled flaps would've required them to be rotated
general 2020-11-17 04:42:32 Change what?
general 2020-11-17 04:43:18 A V-tail usually combines the function of an elevator and a rudder
general 2020-11-17 04:43:26 Which is why they're also called ruddervators
general 2020-11-17 04:45:04 <@456226577798135808> I'm thinking how would you combine a rudder and an elevator and possibly use it as an airbrake without using the default control surfaces
general 2020-11-17 04:45:36 It'd be pretty ugly to have a holes on a wing
general 2020-11-17 04:46:42 For the flaps, that's acceptable
general 2020-11-17 04:46:45 It isn't as obvious
general 2020-11-17 04:47:04 It's a normal rudder
general 2020-11-17 04:47:52 <@456226577798135808> That's just a rudder, not a ruddervator
general 2020-11-17 04:48:37 Still doesn't explain how does one combine an elevator and a rudder and possibly an airbrake
general 2020-11-17 04:50:06 <@!738702049113538600> Do I really have to manually adjust the ruddervators?
general 2020-11-17 04:50:46 How
general 2020-11-17 04:51:56 Well crap somehow someone managed to use ruddervators
general 2020-11-17 04:52:04 With them functioning both as a rudder and elevator
general 2020-11-17 04:53:32 As for the weird diamond wing of the YF-23, probably just precision rotation would be enough
general 2020-11-17 05:08:16 smh my head

general 2020-11-17 05:36:33 This is even worse than being Dacia
general 2020-11-17 05:36:55 At least outdated Renaults are better than being boring and selling one car

general 2020-11-17 07:31:52 So far I've only managed to use the motor 2s on the V-tail as airbrakes
general 2020-11-17 07:32:00 Well, tbh who uses yaw in-game

- Mass report (YouTube sends humans if reported for NSFW)
- Abuse the algorithm and let the channel rot by not giving views 
- Expose him
general 2020-11-17 08:31:11 What if make a server called the Anti-GT server
general 2020-11-17 08:31:22 And organize events against him
general 2020-11-17 08:31:56 <@582834773773254656> If you think it's enough, then it probably is, we don't wanna overwhelm his tiny btain
general 2020-11-17 08:33:20 Also, YouTube has a not interested option right? What if it makes the algorithm say "nobody cares for this little dipstick let's not advertise his channel"
general 2020-11-17 08:35:47 > the soundtrack is boring
<@536013994188865554> After Burner has a better soundtrack, it has a lot of action in it

general 2020-11-17 08:37:33 And slap it onto some random stuff
general 2020-11-17 12:01:46 I think something like the YF-23's wing configuration would make for a good light fighter design in PC
general 2020-11-17 12:02:05 Light as it won't cause physics to throttle much
general 2020-11-17 12:03:57 Who's soniclover?
general 2020-11-17 12:11:29 I know
general 2020-11-17 12:11:47 Finally getting around to it
general 2020-11-17 12:12:10 By just using two motor 2s
general 2020-11-17 12:12:22 Even if it ends up looking ugly
general 2020-11-17 12:18:04 I use motor 1 to angle them first, then use motor 2 to make the all-moving ruddervator work
general 2020-11-17 12:19:35 At least this is close to what I'll for a multi-keybind setup
general 2020-11-17 12:19:46 Not exactly the prettiest way
general 2020-11-17 12:20:48 I use a locked motor 1
general 2020-11-17 12:20:57 No we've seen that before
general 2020-11-17 12:23:59 too late
general 2020-11-17 12:24:01 that was a rickroll

general 2020-11-17 12:30:15 https://streamable.com/403jj3 Here's what I had in mind
general 2020-11-17 12:30:27 First pitching, second yaw
general 2020-11-17 12:30:41 Yaw's pretty useless considering we do roll + pitch anyways
general 2020-11-17 12:32:02 Because Inventer
general 2020-11-17 12:32:35 Well, we already have motor 2 locking suggestion
general 2020-11-17 12:32:38 So I don't need to type that
general 2020-11-17 12:33:03 So a rank to post videos here?
general 2020-11-17 12:33:13 Or a tutorial plane
general 2020-11-17 12:33:23 Because nobody approves of vehicles that came from tutorials
general 2020-11-17 12:33:44 It's just pretty lazy to post it in <#384025409945337856>, and it would get pretty repetitive
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 12:40:51 https://streamable.com/d6h12z I think I've combined all three axes (plural of axis)
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 12:41:02 So that's another throttle reduction measure

general 2020-11-18 04:00:27 it is
general 2020-11-18 04:01:10 The closest you'll get to the Lexus LFA is the RCF and the LC 500

general 2020-11-18 04:02:18 Maybe with a more performance oriented version Lexus might catch our attention
general 2020-11-18 04:02:36 Otherwise they're not like the LFA
general 2020-11-18 04:03:28 > <@!289930922655088640> prolly an lc500f
<@!720891502108344360> Actually, wouldn't be the closest we'll get to the LFA be a tuned RCF?

general 2020-11-18 04:07:26 <@!738702049113538600> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Century I think this is the car

general 2020-11-18 04:07:56 As in the Ford luxury brand
general 2020-11-18 04:08:12 Though it does look pretty refined imo

general 2020-11-19 11:58:20 I'll just revert to tiny nose
general 2020-11-19 11:59:28 so I'll just focus on improving the cockpit
general 2020-11-19 12:00:08 how to cockpit
general 2020-11-19 12:00:14 especially canopy
general 2020-11-19 12:02:45 Maybe I'll go play Minecraft

plane-crazy 2020-11-20 01:34:32 Gonna place the wing low for the semi lifting body design
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 01:34:35 Like the F-15
general 2020-11-20 01:35:22 Is the E in Dassault Rafale silent?
general 2020-11-20 01:35:51 Dassault raffle

Get a chance at winning a Dassault
general 2020-11-20 01:39:00 Are wings the only way to reduce the *thicc* walls of this intake
general 2020-11-20 01:39:06 Do I have to locc
general 2020-11-20 01:40:10 <@!433617207734304778> Motor locked disconnectors, because those don't do 45 degrees all by themselves
general 2020-11-20 03:34:22 random poob
general 2020-11-20 03:34:37 blacklisted for the usual invades building space
general 2020-11-20 03:37:46 poob calls himself "big plane crazy fan", that's literally his username
general 2020-11-20 03:39:33 at this point I'm pretty sus of this server, this guy almost looks like he's copying something from how he builds
general 2020-11-20 03:39:45 Almost as if the big poob tried to screenshot an incomplete plane
general 2020-11-20 03:40:09 They copy, and they show NSFW to minors
general 2020-11-20 03:40:23 They also request sensitive information like passports
general 2020-11-20 03:41:33 When I think of Thailand
I think of Lèse-majesté
general 2020-11-20 03:56:59 yet again bothered by a poob
general 2020-11-20 03:57:41 I'll go on VIP, where not answering someone's question is not considered rude because they have brain cells to know they're busy
bot-central 2020-11-20 03:57:55 !servers
general 2020-11-20 03:58:39 Mine's being bothered by some rando noobs
general 2020-11-20 03:59:08 got butthurt for me not answering to every of their big poob question
general 2020-11-20 03:59:54 I would, but I don't want to constantly switch cameras
general 2020-11-20 04:00:25 Karen wants to be cheap
general 2020-11-20 04:02:16 Best Cheap
general 2020-11-20 04:02:32 We're speaking the language of gods
general 2020-11-20 04:02:58 Boi you bought in a high-end model and that's all they give you?
general 2020-11-20 04:03:19 Did their mother create their brains upside down
general 2020-11-20 04:04:22 Imagine asking $42 for an expensive consle

That's barely enough for a controller
general 2020-11-20 04:06:34 Does this look like an F-16 or an F-18, this is what poob said before I left
general 2020-11-20 04:07:01 I understand F-22
general 2020-11-20 04:07:06 But F-18 and F-16
general 2020-11-20 04:07:07 dum-dum
general 2020-11-20 04:07:26 I can't
general 2020-11-20 04:08:27 I like the name British Aerospace Systems, because you get to call it bae
general 2020-11-20 04:08:50 BAE Systems
general 2020-11-20 04:08:55 The systems from your bae
general 2020-11-20 04:09:18 <@!458654078914920458> Meanwhile I easily laugh at pp and random comedy
general 2020-11-20 04:09:23 My comedy has been raised by YouTube

general 2020-11-20 04:11:52 I do not hate that I laugh a little from it
general 2020-11-20 04:13:43 s t r e t c h
general 2020-11-20 04:14:41 On the other hand, how bad is the Plane Crazy spaghetti code

general 2020-11-20 04:15:08 For advanced avionics
general 2020-11-20 04:16:08 What if I called you bae

But then I was referring to British Aerospace Systems
general 2020-11-20 04:16:27 Conflicting wants of the server?
general 2020-11-20 04:16:47 bae
general 2020-11-20 04:17:42 babe is only reserved for synth
general 2020-11-20 04:18:34 a sfw aeromorph
general 2020-11-20 04:18:44 I mean there's anime catgirls
general 2020-11-20 04:18:51 And then there's true furry catgirls
general 2020-11-20 04:19:08 I know
general 2020-11-20 04:19:11 Don't make that sound wrong
general 2020-11-20 04:20:02 Voxel's here
general 2020-11-20 04:20:11 Voxel is in VIP1
general 2020-11-20 04:21:00 anthromorphic cat, not human with cat ears and tail
general 2020-11-20 04:22:36 No
general 2020-11-20 04:22:47 I haven't seen a single aeromorph in <#384025409945337856>
general 2020-11-20 04:22:56 We've seen tanks with furry ears
general 2020-11-20 04:23:10 And other furry themed builds
general 2020-11-20 04:23:16 But no aeromorphs
general 2020-11-20 04:24:04 Roblox needs the bobux money
general 2020-11-20 04:24:54 I mean there's already the Cyber Critter set
general 2020-11-20 04:24:59 Which is a literal Protogen
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 04:39:05 does this look better than the semi-circle I've used before

plane-crazy 2020-11-20 04:49:06 it's more cursed
general 2020-11-20 04:49:55 If I could build mechs and have some privacy
general 2020-11-20 04:50:01 I would've built an aeromorph
general 2020-11-20 04:50:47 Just so I can bother everyone
general 2020-11-20 04:54:43 <@!738702049113538600> Build a Pontiac Aztek to match with it

general 2020-11-20 05:39:22 ?ping
general 2020-11-20 05:40:42 lmao
general 2020-11-20 05:40:59 when i see reddit
general 2020-11-20 05:41:01 i see reddit
general 2020-11-20 05:41:19 My classmate's vacuum sounding a lot like a jet engine
general 2020-11-20 05:41:52 I use Reddit for wordavalanche, polandball and other dumb stuff
general 2020-11-20 05:42:12 None of those serious stuff
general 2020-11-20 05:42:23 Social media's too much of a dump for serious stuff like politics
general 2020-11-20 05:42:50 4chan sounds like the gate between the dark web and surface web
general 2020-11-20 05:43:05 Basically
general 2020-11-20 05:43:10 If 2b2t was a forum
general 2020-11-20 05:44:07 sounds like every other social media site
general 2020-11-20 05:44:17 except judging from what I've heard
general 2020-11-20 05:44:22 It's on steroids
general 2020-11-20 05:45:17 So is that why when I asked for questions there it's a 50/50 chance of either meeting a jerk or someone actually helpful
general 2020-11-20 05:45:26 Like that one time I asked for RetroArch cores
general 2020-11-20 05:45:39 One said "google dumbass" or something liek that
general 2020-11-20 05:45:50 And one actually helped by pointing me out to the documentation
general 2020-11-20 05:46:13 I should learn to use forums more
general 2020-11-20 05:46:22 Or Discords
general 2020-11-20 05:46:42 Discords are more helpful than subreddits provided you got a good community to join
general 2020-11-20 05:47:29 For Discord, it's either Kim Jong-Un's descendants have ruled the server, good friendly community or just dead
general 2020-11-20 05:48:08 It isn't

There's a Linux community that has a *huge* grudge against certain distros. For example, ask about Linux Mint and you get the ban hammer
general 2020-11-20 05:50:52 Reddit and 4chan have clashing mindsets, but they do share being hellholes
general 2020-11-20 05:51:35 Do both sides have hidden gems of communities?
general 2020-11-20 05:52:54 A big flaw of social media sites is that there's always a community of people who aren't human
general 2020-11-20 05:53:35 Sometimes with fire you can make something good
general 2020-11-20 05:53:50 Reddit being the fire itself
general 2020-11-20 05:54:21 Or you can cook a feast

general 2020-11-20 05:59:39 you look strong
general 2020-11-20 06:01:37 You know if there's one quote that best describes humanity right now

general 2020-11-20 06:02:04 It's just chaos here

general 2020-11-20 06:08:34 Not much in the way of stuff that'll hurt me when a disaster happens
general 2020-11-20 06:08:53 ok bye, think positive
general 2020-11-20 06:09:05 what game is that

general 2020-11-20 06:17:16 First came anime, then came furries

Maybe in 2022 we'd get the one everyone doesn't like
general 2020-11-20 06:17:23 Anthropomorphic vehicles
general 2020-11-20 06:17:58 OwO XB-70 Valkyrie waifu

general 2020-11-20 06:19:01 time for food
general 2020-11-20 06:20:08 Not the worst but yes, you need eye bleach

You want eye trauma, search up automorph or whatever's the car equivalent for aeromorphs
general 2020-11-20 06:22:20 Do not the cars

They already have planes, at least I can pretend it's just some weird looking robot waifu. I can't do that with cars
general 2020-11-20 06:23:30 there is a sukhoi flanker aeromorph in the dump

general 2020-11-20 06:52:00 In practice, communism won't work

general 2020-11-20 07:03:56 For example, the no-no premature end
general 2020-11-20 07:04:32 It's sad to see people go

general 2020-11-20 07:06:32 oh wait
general 2020-11-20 07:06:38 It's exactly what I think it is isn't it?
general 2020-11-20 07:07:15 So far YouTube hasn't banned it though
general 2020-11-20 07:07:31 yes
general 2020-11-20 07:07:42 The game

general 2020-11-20 07:08:02 <@!407275829299773451> vid?
general 2020-11-20 07:08:10 oh
general 2020-11-20 07:08:12 let me find
general 2020-11-20 07:08:57 Let me DM
general 2020-11-20 07:10:13 I DM'd the poor man who asked
general 2020-11-20 07:10:21 He got exactly what he asked
general 2020-11-20 07:10:23 The vids
general 2020-11-20 07:11:24 Is it bad that most of the stuff you guys find here bad I'm not bothered with?
general 2020-11-20 07:12:02 The stuff you guys find bad such as aeromorphs, I don't find bad, probably because I've seen weirder shit
general 2020-11-20 07:12:12 But stuff like bronies I still don't like
general 2020-11-20 07:12:15 Ewe
general 2020-11-20 07:12:23 Necrophilia's straight up gross
general 2020-11-20 07:12:57 Tbh, I won't call you out for being a brony
general 2020-11-20 07:13:08 But I'm not gonna like it either
general 2020-11-20 07:14:07 In that case, I'm in "I don't even care anymore, there's worse stuff like *the literal attraction to children, that's gross*"
general 2020-11-20 07:14:31 No I mean an attraction
general 2020-11-20 07:14:36 Like mating type of attraction
general 2020-11-20 07:14:57 Yes, Cuties is an example of worse stuff
general 2020-11-20 07:15:08 There's also "transage"
general 2020-11-20 07:15:27 Age is a universal constant, you can't turn back time
general 2020-11-20 07:16:13 I surf on YouTube
general 2020-11-20 07:16:27 For random stuff and t e c h h
general 2020-11-20 07:17:17 I really do find channels like Half As Interesting, PolyMatter and TechAltar to be interesting though
general 2020-11-20 07:17:40 I have an A8-7600 and an HD6670 with 8 GB of RAM
general 2020-11-20 07:18:00 I don't know why I still have Reddit even though I mostly lurk in Twitter, YouTube and Discord
general 2020-11-20 07:19:14 Random crap and tbh life is boring without a little bit of it's own disasters
general 2020-11-20 07:19:54 If the algorithm has nothing to feed me, then I go on Twitter
general 2020-11-20 07:20:11 on the other hand I could join more discord servers
general 2020-11-20 07:20:15 but then I'd have too many to manage
general 2020-11-20 07:20:20 And I'm too lazy for that
general 2020-11-20 07:21:07 TikTok

You mean teens exposing how little brain cells they have with some hidden gems
general 2020-11-20 07:22:11 Some are reasonable, some I've heard is just questionable, some is just outright I don't even know anymore
general 2020-11-20 07:22:36 YouTube meanwhile is the land of the demonitized peoples
general 2020-11-20 07:23:35 YouTube are one of the nice places left, but it certainly is damaged by modern day trends

general 2020-11-20 07:24:13 Is this dark humor?
general 2020-11-20 07:24:33 Seriously I don't do dark humor
general 2020-11-20 07:24:47 I do the pp and the stupid humor
general 2020-11-20 07:24:56 Like communism and 69420

general 2020-11-20 07:30:16 I came to PCC for "oh neat a discord"
general 2020-11-20 07:30:42 My messages are ignored
general 2020-11-20 07:30:46 But somehow nobody notices my PFP
general 2020-11-20 07:30:59 wait no i mistyped
general 2020-11-20 07:31:25 Sometimes I think I'm a stealth furry, because I have to point it out just for people to realize
general 2020-11-20 07:31:42 Well, not everyone but still some people genuinely don't notice
general 2020-11-20 07:32:08 fair point
general 2020-11-20 07:32:55 I have a case of the "please distract me i don't want this reality"
general 2020-11-20 07:33:15 do many no-nos
general 2020-11-20 07:33:18 and you will get banned
general 2020-11-20 07:33:37 I prefer not acknowledging problems all the time
general 2020-11-20 07:34:09 Thinking about it, that's not far off
general 2020-11-20 07:34:43 Honestly I can't even remember it
general 2020-11-20 07:35:15 <@456226577798135808> I've had classmates

*I got bruised, fed paper, had my project get destroyed and other stuff*
general 2020-11-20 07:35:55 I actually got for the lack of a better term, played with
general 2020-11-20 07:36:25 So I guess really this is just me trying to fill in the void they made by engaging into activities that will surely not remind me of them
general 2020-11-20 07:36:55 Honestly I watch too much Western stuff
general 2020-11-20 07:37:06 Barely enough stuff from Japan
general 2020-11-20 07:37:32 I'm not depressed, I'm just mad
general 2020-11-20 07:37:56 I'm honestly still pissed, during 6th I had thoughts of how to make my classmates be in extreme pain
general 2020-11-20 07:38:28 In the emotional department, I am the steam engine
general 2020-11-20 07:38:55 Basically, inside I wanna say "please shut the fuck up your ideas are incompetent"
general 2020-11-20 07:39:01 "you're shit"
general 2020-11-20 07:39:22 "you're not a good person, you're a bitch"
An example of my views on some of my worse classmates
general 2020-11-20 07:39:27 I hated them a lot

Karma bit some of them. One got their house burned down due to electrical negligence, one got forced into public

I could describe them as hyperNSFW airheaded gorillas
general 2020-11-20 07:43:30 Ah finally
general 2020-11-20 07:43:49 Now I'm actually pretty fine, all I have to deal with is your normal everyday stuff
general 2020-11-20 07:44:25 The most of my problems now are Twitter and the normal bs
general 2020-11-20 07:45:07 oh and time based stress
general 2020-11-20 07:45:10 but yes im fine

general 2020-11-20 07:49:34 server raided by poob
general 2020-11-20 07:49:53 Rick you were pinged by a poob raider
general 2020-11-20 07:50:07 Check the logs to see the Poob Raider
general 2020-11-20 07:50:17 Poob Raider sounds like a noob version of Tomb Raider
general 2020-11-20 07:50:43 Simple, Control + V
general 2020-11-20 07:50:47 Then enter
general 2020-11-20 07:50:54 Then repeat until everyone is tired
general 2020-11-20 07:51:17 Honestly today's events killed my brain
general 2020-11-20 07:52:35 my ears are dying from bad sound mixing, I'm listening to my classmate's project
general 2020-11-20 07:52:49 I hear background instruments more than foreground instruments, or maybe it's out of sync
general 2020-11-20 07:57:08 Is that a Hercules plane?
general 2020-11-20 07:57:13 But with Philippines theming
general 2020-11-20 07:57:43 <@!163143541160148992> tbh I don't know much with larger aircraft
general 2020-11-20 07:57:59 Well, large military aircraft
general 2020-11-20 07:58:02 Airliners, maybe
general 2020-11-20 07:58:18 I'll take note
general 2020-11-20 07:58:30 Whenever I say Hercules, I should say C-130 instead
general 2020-11-20 07:58:34 It's better anyways
general 2020-11-20 07:59:03 It's not like there's a whole family of aircraft as is the case of the Sukhoi Flanker
general 2020-11-20 07:59:38 please downvote
general 2020-11-20 07:59:48 we need to dislike bomb it to discourage his copying
general 2020-11-20 07:59:58 We need to discourage him so he stops
general 2020-11-20 08:01:36 That plane not only has a bad camera angle but that's just a bit too much, the flag I'd be fine but that
general 2020-11-20 08:01:51 I don't even know
general 2020-11-20 08:02:17 Tinon is the waterbender
general 2020-11-20 08:03:37 Honestly it wouldn't be far off the call the Dutch waterbenders, they've explored the world in ships during the times of the VOC and they really know how to control the flow of water
general 2020-11-20 08:04:16 I mean fair
general 2020-11-20 08:04:32 That's the first step into embracing your Dutchness
general 2020-11-20 08:05:23 Okay goodbye Batroach
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:35:55 not sure about this intake
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:36:17 
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:36:28 intakes look unusual, not sure if it's good or bad
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:40:21 Bimaleka
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:53:36 <@!163143541160148992> So basically, design it like how an engineer would design it in real life?
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:54:05 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:55:01 ~~why am i getting vibes building a space station would be like constructing something from Ikea~~
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:55:43 So I guess it is like building something from Ikea
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:55:55 But just more sciencey and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:56:30 That sounds like a neat idea for a pointless video
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:56:42 Multiple people coming together to make a space station
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:57:20 You know I just realized something
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:57:25 Why hasn't rick added some space stuff
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:57:59 Yeah, would give some more life into the game
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:58:22 Besides people like rockets and space themed stuff
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:58:26 And Sci-Fi
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:58:42 So rick has some reasons for space
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:59:18 Usually planes fly a 30k don't they?
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 08:59:52 Well tbh 1k's pretty high already for PC standards
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:00:12 Yeah let's not go too realistic
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:00:33 No plane would ever go that high
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:00:54 At most you'd be flying around 1 to 2k for a fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:01:06 And bombers also
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:01:35 Yeah that's one of the problems for PC aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:01:48 You also can't do actual supermaneuverability
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:02:40 It would be neat to see PC getting an aerodynamics update
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:02:50 Maybe those 5th generation aircraft might gain an advantage too
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:03:00 With their chines, and body design
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:03:48 If PC ever gets an aerodynamics update, I'm gonna adopt chines and lifting body designs
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:04:10 So no need to worry about that, ever
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:04:27 Just screw around with thrust and wings
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:04:48 If it wants to pitch down, add wings in front
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:04:53 Or add ballasts at the back
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:05:01 Preferably wings first but ballasts are fine
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:05:15 ~~but boi do planes don't want to VTOL and use their landing gear right that way~~
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:05:50 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/194th_Fighter-Interceptor_Squadron_-_Convair_F-106A-135-CO_Delta_Dart_59-0136.jpg
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:06:05 Everytime I make the back too heavy
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:06:10 A plane ends up doing this
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:06:19 Wheelie even without thrust
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:06:49 But at least it makes the plane more maneuverable in pitch
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:07:13 But wings have a better effect for me so I use them more
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:08:00 I just realized why do I have an empanada shaped plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:08:43 If there's anything this server thought me

Looks are everything
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:08:57 If it looks good or technical, you get upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:09:13 Like that one time an A-10 Warthog got into HoF
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:09:29 One of the most overrated planes somehow got into HoF
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:09:35 Or maybe not but still got plenty of upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:09:47 Just because they did it right
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:10:21 I mean it's a nice change of pace
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:10:32 A good looking A-10, even got some livery/camo
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:10:56 very

plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:11:24 Of course Miner would get into HoF
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:11:28 He's too good for this game
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:12:05 Anyways if anyone's curious here's the A-10 in question https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/627195143040139264/760300661656518697
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:12:18 As you can see they really placed a lot of effort into it
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:13:10 It's like that one thing with monke
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:13:27 Give a monkey a typewriter, and he'll eventually write one of the works of Shakespeare
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:13:47 The Infinite Monke Theorem
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:14:16 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem This is pretty much the A-10
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:15:21 That ship needs Diet Sprite
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:15:31 No wonder it couldn't fit into the Panama
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 09:15:48 Give it some Sprite Zero Cranberry
general 2020-11-20 09:17:09 There's actually Sprite Cranberry Zero

general 2020-11-20 11:52:15 The answer is it'll be faster to use a calculator than to ask someone
general 2020-11-20 11:53:05 Dark has been pinged 3,160 times
general 2020-11-20 11:53:50 I have been pinged 1,017 times

*Let me record getting pinged 1,111 times*
general 2020-11-20 11:53:58 Because yes 1111
general 2020-11-20 11:55:13 <@456226577798135808> wait is he calling himself stupid then?
general 2020-11-20 11:56:41 You cannot ping jojo, he is already at 420 pings

general 2020-11-20 12:04:11 True, why else am I replying to you
general 2020-11-20 12:04:57 Become pyramid
general 2020-11-20 12:04:59 Become your name
general 2020-11-20 12:08:43 I heard it was the same story for the P-47 Thunderbolt
general 2020-11-20 12:08:56 No wait they built the plane around the engine
general 2020-11-20 12:09:03 Or something like that
general 2020-11-20 12:09:33 I'm confused now
general 2020-11-20 12:10:01 Maybe that's why they chose the name "Thunderbolt II"
general 2020-11-20 12:10:14 Build the plane around something
general 2020-11-20 12:10:55 "The P-47 was designed around the powerful Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp 18-cylinder radial engine, which also powered two U.S. Navy/U.S. Marine Corps fighters, the Grumman F6F Hellcat and the Vought F4U Corsair."

In this case apparently, it is
general 2020-11-20 12:11:08 It was designed around an engine, not an engine designed for a plane
general 2020-11-20 12:13:47 f
general 2020-11-20 12:18:41 Detroit: Kill Human
general 2020-11-20 12:20:10 the devs made a mistake
general 2020-11-20 12:20:18 It should be called
general 2020-11-20 12:20:23 Detroit: Become Monke
general 2020-11-20 12:21:22 "4 mb/s"
general 2020-11-20 12:21:25 How
general 2020-11-20 12:21:29 How is it that low
general 2020-11-20 12:21:49 I just noticed a lot of you people are on Macs
general 2020-11-20 12:24:23 That looks familiar
general 2020-11-20 12:25:13 The cheese grater is the Mac Pro
general 2020-11-20 12:25:26 Aka will stop receiving support and costs 50 grand at max specced
general 2020-11-20 12:25:36 Because Mac OS will move onto Arm
general 2020-11-20 12:26:19 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Mac_G5
general 2020-11-20 12:26:24 So this is what you have
general 2020-11-20 12:26:32 "2003 -2006"
general 2020-11-20 12:26:38 boi that's ancient by modern standards
general 2020-11-20 12:27:22 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC_970 It's also powered by a processor that's no longer used in consumer electronics

It's also not x86
general 2020-11-20 12:27:39 The PowerPC architecture is not compatible with x86, so you definitely need an upgrade
general 2020-11-20 12:28:06 Basically, you won't run any apps at all from modern day
general 2020-11-20 12:29:00 Still, software compatibility is dubious
general 2020-11-20 12:29:50 I mean if you want it to be updated then at least swap out some parts, specifically the processor
general 2020-11-20 12:30:19 Software on the other hand, it depends on what it's written for
general 2020-11-20 12:30:35 I dunno, I never used Apple
general 2020-11-20 12:31:22 I mean consumers usually download more than upload
general 2020-11-20 12:32:39 34.81 mb/ps
general 2020-11-20 12:32:51 Looks like you're good
general 2020-11-20 12:33:51 Wait isn't that a tablet?
general 2020-11-20 12:34:10 A tablet is a portable computer, that you can technically draw on
general 2020-11-20 12:34:30 And a tablet does look like a monitor
general 2020-11-20 12:34:36 I mean it's just a screen with thick bezels
general 2020-11-20 12:35:25 Surface
general 2020-11-20 12:35:39 Or one of those two in one laptops
general 2020-11-20 12:37:26 German is also nice
general 2020-11-20 12:37:52 Volkswagen IDR is just wedge
general 2020-11-20 12:38:06 But not as wedgy as the Lancia Stratos Zero

***Now that's a literal wedge***
general 2020-11-20 12:39:10 That's what I was thinking, you'd sport a badge normally associated with expensive luxury cars and both brands do have a history of aftermarket performance
general 2020-11-20 12:40:18 https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Rr0YSZZ-FYg/maxresdefault.jpg
general 2020-11-20 12:40:24 The Stratos Zero
general 2020-11-20 12:40:29 Literal wedge
general 2020-11-20 12:41:00 https://www.supercars.net/blog/1996-suzuki-escudo-pikes-peak/
general 2020-11-20 12:42:14 Still, that Suzuki has 985 bhp with 800kg-ish of weight sent through 4WD
general 2020-11-20 12:42:32 All coming from a TTV6
general 2020-11-20 12:43:06 Still for it's time kinda impressive engineering
general 2020-11-20 12:43:18 Also there's worse cars
general 2020-11-20 12:43:27 Fiat Multipla and Pontiac Aztek for example
general 2020-11-20 12:43:35 Sure it may appeal to civilians in features
general 2020-11-20 12:43:39 But they do look shittier
general 2020-11-20 12:44:01 Those two are practical yet ugly
general 2020-11-20 12:44:37 https://i.pinimg.com/originals/42/a8/59/42a8590bfb3d7a669d5436dfb2ab664c.jpg
general 2020-11-20 12:44:40 Look at this Subaru
general 2020-11-20 12:44:49 It's what's called the bugeye Subaru Impreza
general 2020-11-20 12:45:06 I mean if it's good, then I want
general 2020-11-20 12:45:28 Yeah the bugeye Impreza looks kinda weird
general 2020-11-20 12:45:34 It's like it's in shock
general 2020-11-20 12:46:04 https://www.supercars.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2010_Hennessey_VenomGT-1-1536.jpg
general 2020-11-20 12:46:11 Meanwhile this is just a Lotus with an American V8
general 2020-11-20 12:46:32 *tires squeal in pain*
general 2020-11-20 12:46:46 I mean it's their car, their choice
general 2020-11-20 12:47:10 But good luck on maintainance to whoever owns that Mitsubishi
general 2020-11-20 12:50:25 Okay
general 2020-11-20 12:50:31 Now *that's* a Multipla
general 2020-11-20 13:06:53 oh yeah feet rookie got banned
general 2020-11-20 13:07:15 Is this the Grablador person I've been hearing about
general 2020-11-20 13:12:47 is it bad i'm having fun with this
general 2020-11-20 13:14:39 https://streamable.com/oaktrz
general 2020-11-20 13:14:45 idk what i'm doing here
general 2020-11-20 13:14:50 all I know is that I'm bored
general 2020-11-20 13:15:22 I'mma keep bothering him
general 2020-11-20 13:20:16 i am procrastinating
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:30:07 i boarded someone's ship
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:30:39 Well, a coincidentally met them then
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:31:53 This ship still has more detail than a good amount of builds
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:32:04 ~~I'm talking about modified tutorial planes~~
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:32:19 ~~And basic land vehicles~~
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:33:39 Helicopter basics? As in how it works?
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:35:25 Still, it would be nice to get something in depth
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:36:20 The only person I've seen do it decently is Prototrode
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:39:55 That looks like a tutorial F-16
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:40:08 F-18?
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:40:39 It's a WIP so I couldn't tell
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:43:39 There's a vid for basics of a plane, but it's concerned more on designing on a PvP fighter and not planes in general
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:43:55 Would be nice to have a vid explaining how to design a plane in general, at least with Plane Crazy's physics
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:47:13 a i r b r a k e
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:47:28 Literally a lazy airbrake
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:47:52 I would use them as ruddervators but collision got in the way
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:47:58 Didn't bother and just went with it
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:48:04 The wing will be motor locked
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:49:15 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:50:46 I just make sure the design is stable
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:51:25 Because if it keeps spasming, then your plane is unstable by design
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:53:05 The F-22 meanwhile has a clipped delta
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:53:25 It's close, but not diamond shaped
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:55:13 And after that comes the Shinshin and F-X
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:55:27 elpehant man with alexa ship is here
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:56:29 here i fixed it
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:57:02 I still have room to cram a leading root extension
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:57:15 What if the pilot painted it himself
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:00:32 S m o o t h
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:00:36 but also large nose
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:01:34 I'm still dumbfounded on how to design a good cockpit
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:01:37 or nose
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:02:01 I see I am using your nose design already
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:02:10 But cockpit I still need improvements
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:02:27 Still pretty smooth, something you don't see everyday
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:03:13 <@!447221768520859659> Hmm have you considered using an all-moving rudder?
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:03:50 You could try
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:04:02 If you want you can use a dual motor 2 setup
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:04:09 Mostly so that you can make a ruddervator
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:04:17 Or combine an airbrake function
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:04:59 ngl that's a pretty good use of motor locking and default engines
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:05:53 Meanwhile I have this incomplete thing, I'll just continue it tomorrow
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:06:26 I wonder if this will slow down the aircraft as intended
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:06:35 I've gotten rid of super rockets entirely
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:06:49 At least with forward thrust
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:06:55 Because speed and physics throttling
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:07:06 And because I've gotten to a point it's pretty stable

||that was rtheorical||
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:11:12 I'm implying I never use mouse adjustments
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:11:13 At all
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:11:37 Closest you'll get is canard based adjustment but I only do that when I'm desperate
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:11:39 Which is once
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:12:30 Once I go forward, canard adjusts
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:12:39 For example, if it's pitching down slightly
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:12:43 I make the canard pitch up slightly
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:13:25 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/779346784812007464 this uses only uses 6 motors to lock everything in place
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:13:59 This WIP only uses 6 locked motors, everything else rotates
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:14:22 It's pretty simple in the first place so nothing impressive
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:14:55 It's a forward swept wing
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:14:58 With canards
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:15:11 Do I see purely default engines?
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:15:24 And those rudders
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:16:28 Are the rudders supposed to be like that?
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:16:37 Like segmented into strips
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:16:59 <@!730808827234091041>
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:17:21 Are those rudders supposed to be like that?
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:17:39 Guess I'm just used to all-moving rudders/vertical stabilizer flap rudders
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:18:26 <@!467765396108476426> i use springs
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:18:42 I don't know how to use disconnectors
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:18:45 So I use springs
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:19:05 Yes they do
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:19:16 But it's the only one that I know that completely pops-off
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:19:37 Which I find convenient too
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:20:25 Plus I find springs to be compact, takes up the same space as TNT
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:20:48 Yes that sucks
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:21:05 My designs rn have size constraints
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:21:18 So I use springs so I can cram the most features
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:21:24 Symmetrical builds are good
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:21:34 But bomb bays really make it not symmetrical
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:21:55 my plane looks like an empanada

plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:23:05 fuselage is just flatter empanada
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:23:12 I just grabbed a random image
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:23:30 It's not accurate, but it's accurate enough for most
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:23:47 <@!296003830649454603> but yes empanada fuselage
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:23:53 my plane has empanadalage
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:24:15 A flying empanada?

general 2020-11-21 00:19:30 Can someone give me Rick's PFP
general 2020-11-21 00:19:49 I wanna do an edit involving a Sony Ericsson
general 2020-11-21 00:20:15 https://twitter.com/rickje139?lang=en nevermind I can get his profile pic here

general 2020-11-21 00:22:08 What phone do you think when I say Sony Ericsson?
the-dump 2020-11-21 00:53:36 
general 2020-11-21 00:53:54 I have the best phone
general 2020-11-21 00:54:03 
general 2020-11-21 00:54:24 No it's a Sony Erickjeson
general 2020-11-21 00:55:42 Why is it on Google of all places
general 2020-11-21 00:55:52 On the other hand, Google can show weird results if you ask
general 2020-11-21 00:55:59 That's even more unexpected
general 2020-11-21 00:57:19 Search up "human knuckles"

I promise you Google won't show you hand knuckles, it instead shows you something you'd expect from DeviantArt
general 2020-11-21 00:58:21 Also Bing powers most privacy based search engines and I've had a fine time with it
general 2020-11-21 00:59:56 Well I wish you luck in not getting eye trauma
general 2020-11-21 01:00:35 should we ping
general 2020-11-21 01:00:40 about the illegal image

general 2020-11-21 01:13:03 Is that an Escort? <@!409676438682206218>
general 2020-11-21 01:16:37 Would this make sense for a fighter jet rear landing gear?
general 2020-11-21 01:17:55 Where the gears are parallel to the aircraft, not perpendicular

general 2020-11-21 01:30:12 You have the most IVs
general 2020-11-21 01:30:23 my brain just shart itself
general 2020-11-21 01:30:38 Now try to reach the most Vs
general 2020-11-21 01:32:33 I've seen a plot sized truck before
general 2020-11-21 01:33:05 Used some folding if I remembered
general 2020-11-21 01:33:20 Not because it had a long cargo, but because of it's sheer size
general 2020-11-21 01:34:03 When you consider there's shipbuilders and people making absurdly detailed large builds
general 2020-11-21 01:34:12 Well that's not impossible at this point
general 2020-11-21 01:34:45 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/775347332925489182 For example this
general 2020-11-21 01:35:01 <@!437152336176087052> I feel like that could easily reach 1k
general 2020-11-21 01:35:07 2k still possible
general 2020-11-21 01:35:47 You're definitely gonna need a lot of blocks to get stuff good
general 2020-11-21 01:36:18 Well, at larger scales anyways
general 2020-11-21 01:36:30 You can make nice smol stuff, but larger builds definitely are gonna pile up
general 2020-11-21 01:36:43 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/775025164685148180 look what i found
general 2020-11-21 01:36:54 typical public server vehicle
general 2020-11-21 01:37:32 <@456226577798135808> Nah this man's rally car's hot https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/774387225592332328
general 2020-11-21 01:38:01 It's not unreasonable, but it's definitely gonna be a challenge if you don't know what you're doing
general 2020-11-21 01:38:36 For cars, well there's a supercar in HoF right now
general 2020-11-21 01:39:10 <@!195253906333368320> Is there a minimum block count requirement for HoF?
general 2020-11-21 01:40:13 The most I got with VTOL is a fighter jet
general 2020-11-21 01:40:28 I remember the build I got expert with
general 2020-11-21 01:40:38 *It was an ugly-ass three folder jumbo jet*
general 2020-11-21 01:41:08 If I remember the jet now has gotten downvote bombed
general 2020-11-21 01:41:31 Luckily I got it approved before it can't be ranked for expert
general 2020-11-21 01:42:10 If I had requested for expert any later then that jumbo jet would be invalid
general 2020-11-21 01:42:34 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/737219878414712882/RobloxScreenShot20200727_160630429.png
general 2020-11-21 01:42:37 This is what I got expert with
general 2020-11-21 01:42:46 I was still sorta new at the time
general 2020-11-21 01:43:27 Honestly I could've salvaged it and added 1x2 wedges to make it curvier
general 2020-11-21 01:43:41 Should I return to making airliners?
general 2020-11-21 01:44:17 It took three folds to get it right
general 2020-11-21 01:44:58 So it wasn't a tiny main wing
general 2020-11-21 01:45:28 Yes, but being a three folder, it had hella high drag
general 2020-11-21 01:45:41 I still remembered it having slow steering in general
general 2020-11-21 01:46:07 If I could make airliner noses right I might return to it
general 2020-11-21 01:46:50 But it would be hell to manage
general 2020-11-21 01:48:02 ~~why is it always the noses I struggle with~~
general 2020-11-21 02:02:38 When Rick adds softcode
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 02:04:02 <@209005642000760832> What if spinstang does Herbst maneuver or Cobra maneuver?
the-dump 2020-11-21 02:05:31 They should've added 6 more for better marketing
general 2020-11-21 02:11:20 Gacha money
general 2020-11-21 02:12:01 A madman
general 2020-11-21 02:17:19 They added headbands
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 02:52:45 Is this fine?
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 02:56:54 shipe
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 02:58:25 thicc
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 03:00:30 you make a superstructure
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 03:00:40 by applying radiation onto normal structure
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 03:00:48 then it becomes a superstructure
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 03:00:57 wait no that's how you make a superhero
general 2020-11-21 03:05:04 here's a random question, how many times do executives of big companies have tainted childhood shows
general 2020-11-21 03:07:49 That isn't a glitch
general 2020-11-21 03:07:59 It's just wonky Plane Crazy mechanics
general 2020-11-21 03:08:22 I dunno how you'll end up using that, but it's a feature that's been in the game for a long time

general 2020-11-21 03:10:47 So you joined this server pretty recently
general 2020-11-21 03:10:51 At October 20, 2020
general 2020-11-21 03:11:13 Coincidentally you registered onto Discord at Jan 20, 2020
general 2020-11-21 03:11:37 Say that as a tongue twister
general 2020-11-21 03:11:42 Gotta bucket a chicken
general 2020-11-21 03:12:57 It isn't, but you can still try
general 2020-11-21 03:13:12 Sounds like it could be one
general 2020-11-21 03:15:59 Reading this I was expecting the United States would be the hardest
general 2020-11-21 03:19:42 Personally though, if this were real life
general 2020-11-21 03:19:59 I wouldn't be surprised if India had a powerful military
general 2020-11-21 03:20:27 They have Pakistan and China to worry about, and I see progress in their jets
general 2020-11-21 03:20:41 Referring to the HAL AMCA
general 2020-11-21 03:21:02 but this is civ
general 2020-11-21 03:21:09 so this is different
general 2020-11-21 03:22:06 nice
general 2020-11-21 03:22:06 Brazil
general 2020-11-21 03:22:26 When Brazil conquers you
general 2020-11-21 03:22:32 You go somewhere worse than the gulags
general 2020-11-21 03:23:55 there is a literal firefox
general 2020-11-21 03:25:36 Guess what's the closest I've been to being interested into anime
general 2020-11-21 03:26:44 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakugan_Battle_Brawlers> This and Pokemon and Dragon Ball were the closest I've ever gotten to, but these were during my *early* childhood years when I was still a braincellless moron
general 2020-11-21 03:27:24 I am, just less moron and more stupid
general 2020-11-21 03:27:53 I'm gonna be mean to Tsunami

Thank you you're so kind and sweet
general 2020-11-21 03:28:45 Zero
general 2020-11-21 03:30:57 I'm hating this
general 2020-11-21 03:31:34 I might give up on this type of landing gear
general 2020-11-21 03:33:04 On the other hand I have no room to do this
general 2020-11-21 03:33:12 Where the landing gear is tucked in sideways
general 2020-11-21 03:33:47 just something I made in my spare time
general 2020-11-21 03:34:14 I usually play it safe and just stick with this shade of grey
general 2020-11-21 03:34:38 No, no
general 2020-11-21 03:34:44 **O w U**
general 2020-11-21 03:34:45 this is
general 2020-11-21 03:43:22 this looks awkward
general 2020-11-21 03:43:43 the gears look placed a bit too forward
general 2020-11-21 03:44:42 no he's comic sans
general 2020-11-21 03:44:50 never take him seriously
general 2020-11-21 03:47:47 No you are Segoe UI
general 2020-11-21 03:49:05 become capitalist font
general 2020-11-21 04:01:49 I came back for one second and now I see 2000s adware
general 2020-11-21 04:04:36 HEAT warhead
general 2020-11-21 04:04:54 things are getting hot in here
general 2020-11-21 04:06:08 I've finally fit a decent looking pair of landing gear
general 2020-11-21 04:06:14 Nothing too forward this time
general 2020-11-21 04:08:34 okay landing gear too unstable
general 2020-11-21 04:22:48 he's shrek
general 2020-11-21 04:22:51 that's why
general 2020-11-21 04:24:46 I have somehow ended up in a Korean server
general 2020-11-21 04:27:21 I will now go use trapdoors for landing gear doors
general 2020-11-21 04:27:37 Because I'm desperate for space now
general 2020-11-21 04:28:11 As you can see, no space for a proper door, so trapdoors
general 2020-11-21 04:29:58 <@!665734924099387431> Make a Dr. T themed Grussault Mirage

general 2020-11-21 04:30:26 look at this nose
general 2020-11-21 04:30:31 it's like an aircraft nose
general 2020-11-21 04:30:48 so yes Grussault Mirage
general 2020-11-21 04:38:53 this is making me laugh a little
general 2020-11-21 04:39:01 long gear
general 2020-11-21 04:44:53 made landing gear less funny
help 2020-11-21 04:45:56 felt like I posted too much in general
help 2020-11-21 04:46:05 so I'm posting it here
help 2020-11-21 04:46:11 landing gear less funny now
help 2020-11-21 04:48:54 yes it is kinda thin
help 2020-11-21 04:49:30 I should, shouldn't deviate much from being straight
help 2020-11-21 04:50:12 I'll just use a half wedge then
help 2020-11-21 04:50:57 nevermind
help 2020-11-21 04:51:02 It somehow gets stuck
help 2020-11-21 04:51:36 so I guess a control surface will do, probably has something to do with wonky welding
help 2020-11-21 04:54:17 well I made it a little thicker now
help 2020-11-21 04:54:22 And should be level now
help 2020-11-21 04:55:36 roll flaps being buggy
help 2020-11-21 04:56:12 If it's just collision problems, that should be easily fixed
help 2020-11-21 04:56:32 Instead of adding a leading root flap, I'll just redesign the wing
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 05:37:32 I just popped in
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 05:38:04 Is this what I'm trying to read
"The longer you're in a Roblox server, the more likely you're gonna encounter a copycat"
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 05:38:37 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 05:39:03 Carry on.
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 05:40:25 Must be a GT subscriber who copied
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 05:42:50 I mean it's not false to assume that someone who actively follows Gamer Thailand would also be fine with copying
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 05:43:34 Powered locking's fine for me
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 05:43:42 I can still do my nozzles
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 05:44:48 Now I must answer a paper about Health
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 05:45:15 Nothing, just farded it out
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 05:45:38 Something about mental health
general 2020-11-21 05:46:12 Apple? You mean portless?
general 2020-11-21 05:46:33 Apple also apparently seems to be the leader in flagships, aka overpriced slabs
general 2020-11-21 05:47:11 Like how do companies think just because Apple removed the headphone jack means it's a good idea?
general 2020-11-21 05:47:46 Well at least they actually tried, for example with foldable phones
general 2020-11-21 05:47:51 Apple just doesn't
general 2020-11-21 05:48:26 How hard is it to get a high-resolution touch screen? Apple instead adds an emoji row touchscreen for the keyboard
general 2020-11-21 05:49:15 Meanwhile Lenovo makes a foldable tablet
general 2020-11-21 05:49:21 Which is more than what Apple can and could do
general 2020-11-21 05:50:52 I feel like the only reason they could get away with it is with the software experience
general 2020-11-21 05:52:00 Otherwise, the hardware's a petty excuse for the price and the software is restrictive in terms of customization
general 2020-11-21 05:52:41 Like how does it cost 50k just to get a computer, that's server money
general 2020-11-21 05:53:02 For 50 grand I could've bought myself a nice Mercedes
general 2020-11-21 05:55:09 There's a lot you can do with 50 grand apart from letting it waste to an overpriced computer whose support is about to end anyways
general 2020-11-21 05:55:20 Referring to Apple abandoning x86
general 2020-11-21 05:55:32 They also do unauthorized throttling
general 2020-11-21 05:55:45 If it's for batteries, then it would be nice to make it optional
general 2020-11-21 05:56:41 For 50 grand you could buy yourself a server that's significantly more powerful and probably have some change left
general 2020-11-21 05:57:16 It's your choice
general 2020-11-21 05:57:27 I mean is it really worth the trade-offs?
general 2020-11-21 05:57:50 Honestly apart from price the casual consumer shouldn't have a problem
general 2020-11-21 05:58:11 The only reason Apple wouldn't give a touchscreen to the Macbook would be cannabilizing iPad sales
general 2020-11-21 06:02:46 How much money do you have
general 2020-11-21 06:05:02 Meanwhile my parents are both cheap and restrictive
general 2020-11-21 06:05:18 As much as I want to use Linux
general 2020-11-21 06:05:24 I have to use legacy glass OS 10
general 2020-11-21 06:05:55 And I have to use Android 5
general 2020-11-21 06:06:28 Because rOoTiNg Is DaNgErOuS
They should really stfu they're tech illiterate as far as I'm concerned
general 2020-11-21 06:07:05 I'd rather setup everything myself
general 2020-11-21 06:07:49 I'm not talking about you

I'm talking about my parents thinking it'd be a good idea to be so cheap to buy fragile knock-offs while at the same time restricting any form of modifications
general 2020-11-21 06:08:09 They're too blind to know that they don't know anything with software
general 2020-11-21 06:08:30 It's like making an idiot the leader of a group of engineers
general 2020-11-21 06:08:45 The dumbass that knows nothing thinks he knows more than those with experience
general 2020-11-21 06:09:29 Honestly I don't get why my dad thinks rooting is dangerous

I find it moronic to think you'd require special tools to root a phone
general 2020-11-21 06:09:47 When in reality all it takes is a computer with a USB connection
general 2020-11-21 06:10:09 It's an old phone, Lenovo S-90, I think it's already past it's warranty
general 2020-11-21 06:10:36 I wasn't being specific when I requested it
general 2020-11-21 06:11:31 My mindset just goes "free is better than nothing"
general 2020-11-21 06:12:24 Honestly how I was being a bit ambigious, but otherwise I willingly waited
general 2020-11-21 06:12:31 Like I'm getting it for free, so I wait
general 2020-11-21 06:12:39 I'll just pay with time
general 2020-11-21 06:13:56 Honestly what I got is semi-anthropomorphic
general 2020-11-21 06:14:25 Yes it does
general 2020-11-21 06:14:32 Corona is also the name of a Toyota
general 2020-11-21 06:14:36 Toyota Coronavirus
general 2020-11-21 06:15:44 It's on Android 5, and I wanna customize the software in general
general 2020-11-21 06:15:50 To get a better experience out of a budget phone
general 2020-11-21 06:16:35 I'll just start with ADB just to show them it's no big deal when doing technical stuff to your phoe
general 2020-11-21 06:16:45 And to prove them that those "specialist stores" are a scam
general 2020-11-21 06:17:01 Rooting is free, you just need to follow instructions properly
general 2020-11-21 06:19:04 I should really focus on gaining trust first
general 2020-11-21 06:20:35 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTH6s1SMIQicvyd8OLBYMtQ I wish I had good editing skills like this man
general 2020-11-21 06:20:57 He is the magic man
general 2020-11-21 06:21:06 He knows how to wield the magic editing tool
general 2020-11-21 06:22:28 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLq_P0K4jvA he also knows how to smooth, and there's also a part 2 of this
the-dump 2020-11-21 06:28:11 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e6xOBCAVvA Imagine having the dedication of this man, to smuggle a rare company only product out of a country during a total travel lockdown, having to pay thousands of dollars just to get the dang thing, getting someone out of retirement for a modded 3DS when 3DS modding is dead only to be beaten by someone else who's kinda selfish only to dump the ROM of the game online, where he and collectors lose out
the-dump 2020-11-21 06:31:34 It's not all bad, like I said he dumped the ROM online for everyone
the-dump 2020-11-21 06:32:36 I also need to convince a brick wall

general 2020-11-21 06:42:51 What incentive do you have to do that
general 2020-11-21 06:43:15 boi
general 2020-11-21 06:43:18 you just rickrolled us

general 2020-11-21 06:44:26 never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
general 2020-11-21 06:44:52 That was pretty convincing
general 2020-11-21 06:45:08 You have told a lie
general 2020-11-21 06:45:10 And hurt us
general 2020-11-21 06:45:16 Now say goodbye
general 2020-11-21 06:45:19 For tell a lie

general 2020-11-21 06:47:00 you really did it
general 2020-11-21 06:48:41 I mean how often do we talk about food
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:50:39 I just realized something
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:50:45 No super rockets means no engine noise
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:50:50 Which means I have a form of stealth
general 2020-11-21 06:52:32 https://streamable.com/k7vtwq What did I do wrong that makes this do wheelies
general 2020-11-21 06:52:37 Stationary wheelies
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:02:23 Anyone know what causes wing spasming
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:02:29 The kind where you disappear from the world
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:03:05 Servo doing the seizure funny
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:03:11 Although it's only on two flaps
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:03:15 Everything else, in spite of being servos
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:03:23 Somehow are pretty stable in supersonic flight (conveyor drive)
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:03:38 Even the elevators are fine
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:04:27 The flap I'm standing on will freak out once I try to pitch up while going supersonic
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:04:54 Thought so
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:05:43 I'll just redesign the wing
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:06:00 Which is what I was supposed to be doing
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:13:32 poob attempts to use blacklist bypass, colorized
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:23:51 After making sure the wings don't collide with anything, ailerons are now stable
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:38:15 It's all motors
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:39:21 look at this "thing"
general 2020-11-21 07:43:53 I think I'm getting better at cramming stuf-

general 2020-11-21 07:51:10 ngl doesn't that defeat the purpose of not looking there
general 2020-11-21 07:54:31 Femboy if I remember are boys who dress up in what is seen as feminine
general 2020-11-21 07:54:36 Or maybe I'm wrong
general 2020-11-21 07:54:58 That is a better explanation
general 2020-11-21 07:55:24 So I guess it's like you're not acknowledging the person is trans, but I'll just get out now
general 2020-11-21 07:55:39 I'm not qualified for this
general 2020-11-21 07:56:34 All I'm gonna say I don't even know femboys
general 2020-11-21 07:56:46 I'm just gonna only use it when a person describes themselves as such
general 2020-11-21 07:56:51 And yes let's shut and forget

general 2020-11-21 07:58:52 large banans
general 2020-11-21 07:59:06 what banan is cooked
general 2020-11-21 07:59:28 It's more on the sweet side, but not the really sweet ones like chocolate and candy
general 2020-11-21 07:59:42 ew
general 2020-11-21 07:59:44 that's gross

plane-crazy 2020-11-21 08:17:35 Meanwhile I just build
general 2020-11-21 09:08:01 I just noticed lvoeguys_withroblox's PFP looking kinda NSFW
general 2020-11-21 09:09:14 I see this is why people are against anime and furries
general 2020-11-21 09:09:25 They go OwO for the wrong reasons
general 2020-11-21 09:10:08 For them, here's a rule of thumb 

Keep your horns to yourselves
general 2020-11-21 09:10:27 I've been doing fine doing that
general 2020-11-21 09:11:01 Where I don't bother anybody except when I intend giving cursed content
general 2020-11-21 09:11:41 <@714763671410180127> Why not do both?
general 2020-11-21 09:12:07 You have anime
general 2020-11-21 09:12:25 Do the *other one* also
general 2020-11-21 09:12:44 My kind
general 2020-11-21 09:13:03 So you can go full circle
general 2020-11-21 09:13:22 At least I didn't suggest anthropomorphic planes

You can't crash a PC with simply an IP

general 2020-11-21 09:53:06 <@673397945764151336> Check logs, scroll up, and check our pings, we were all witnesses

The obvious spamming 

Also, undie check him (I mean it's kinda suspicious he reacted with "BAD WORD WEE WOO")

general 2020-11-21 09:58:16 Also
general 2020-11-21 09:58:33 He used his real name 

***He literally doxxed himself***

general 2020-11-21 14:45:12 <@760100554646224937> By bouncing, you mean it's shaking a bit?
general 2020-11-21 14:45:32 Oh I didn't even notice the shading
general 2020-11-21 14:46:04 I'll take your word on it, but yeah the art style is familiar
general 2020-11-21 14:46:30 Tbh I like Google's Material Design
general 2020-11-21 14:46:57 It pops, it feels at home and just feels nice and consistent
general 2020-11-21 14:47:22 I dunno how to describe it
general 2020-11-21 14:47:52 But honestly comparing it to Windows 10, Microsoft needs a better design
general 2020-11-21 14:48:11 It's inconsistent and needs more personality
general 2020-11-21 14:48:36 It's trying but the inconsistencies make it like frankenstein
general 2020-11-21 14:49:06 It doesn't matter if you're just casually using it
general 2020-11-21 14:49:27 But it does need a bit of touching up
general 2020-11-21 14:49:55 Just be consistent and finally do their Fluent Design thing

plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:03:46 Hmm yes afterfarters

plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:05:05 I'm already an expert rank
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:05:53 Then a traumatized water bottle, a disgusted Tsunami and a bat that's already flying away
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:06:07 Batman stares in shock while Box is just box
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:06:38 Okay we've already been too stupid here
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:06:52 Speakers to never gonna give you up
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:07:03 Second best is jetpack
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:07:13 Jetpack is convenient
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:07:29 When you're gonna motor lock a lot you're gonna need the help you can get
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:07:43 Honestly you could use speakers for sound effects
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:08:42 <@723419054114865202> please do not scroll up if you value your eyes
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:08:46 Actually just leave
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:08:51 Go to general
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:09:32 ~~this is cringe, even for me~~
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:11:30 Considering you can watch a YouTube video to know the winter items' locations, unless you already got all summer items, get the Summer Pass
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:12:10 Rick should still make them available like Summer Items
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:12:43 <@437152336176087052> that sounds so wrong
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:13:31 You know you don't need an account there, you only need it for the NSFW 

*Dont ask how I know*
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:13:44 Unless you were joking
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:13:49 In that case woooosh
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:14:22 fuck off
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:14:42 I have something I need to test
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:15:01 Everything looks weird if you add a tilde at the end of a sentence~
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:15:25 Somehow you did
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:15:38 How did I get dragged into this
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:15:56 <@743010779229454346> aeromorph*

general 2020-11-21 15:18:47 How much variations of English does exist
general 2020-11-21 15:19:01 *I swear if someone here says Old English*
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:19:17 Oh we just got raided

plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:20:20 Unde or undie
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:20:47 This Discord is sponsored by Raid Shadow Legends
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:21:22 Gonna take that out of context
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:23:20 
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:24:10 Glad I didn't get in that maid bs.

*Even though it would be fitting considering there's a literal Dragon Maid anime*
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:25:20 <@296003830649454603> It's a real thing, an anime where dragons are maids
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:25:38 I don't even anime yet I know this somehow
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:25:48 Thanks internet
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:26:44 The name on Wikipedia 

Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maids 

Anyways, enough with the sensory trauma today
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:27:22 hey I'm dumb 

Or is being a potato different
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:29:10 What if I search you bot central but without ping
bot-central 2020-11-21 15:30:07 ?whois 454570394343702529
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:30:37 An asshole is an asshole
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:30:51 A holeass is a holeass
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:30:59 Tabasco is tabasco
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:31:25 Irrelevant is us
bot-central 2020-11-21 15:32:24 I wonder what happened
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:32:39 I mean if you're sneaky about it...
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:33:01 A human trait is that we always find a way to screw overselves somehow
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:33:33 And we always find a way to rely on what can't be returned to
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:34:03 The human brain goes "Nothing is as pretty as the past though" at times
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:35:14 <@437152336176087052> There's two kinds of shit, generic shit and shit shit
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:35:50 Yes but with music that's what I think of
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:36:16 <@437152336176087052> Exactly
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:36:38 Honestly whatever makes you happy go for it, just don't rub it in
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:36:52 *cough* K-Pop *cough*
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:37:16 Seriously then K-Pop addicts are a walking billboard
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:39:22 It's an opinion yes, and if jojo only listens to two artists then that's his choice
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:39:47 Honestly I prefer judging music on a scale
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:40:06 I just listen to rock or electronic, and avoid getting an existential crisis
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:40:53 Video games pretty much made my tastes in music
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:41:04 It's only recently I started randomly searching
general 2020-11-21 15:42:23 How do you pronounce "Siemens"?

I just read it in <#384025409945337856> and I just wanted to be sure if I'm reading it right
general 2020-11-21 15:43:32 I will go to DemonitizationTube now

general 2020-11-21 15:52:07 Eggplant
general 2020-11-21 15:52:42 Apparently people find this egg plane important
general 2020-11-21 15:52:46 Anyways bye again
general 2020-11-21 23:58:44 Make everything in AR
general 2020-11-21 23:59:02 Then make a house out of the models
general 2020-11-21 23:59:48 But then you can't fool anyone with that
general 2020-11-21 23:59:58 You just fooled yourself into working
general 2020-11-22 00:00:12 And we don't do work here
general 2020-11-22 00:00:19 We do procrasfination
general 2020-11-22 00:01:24 If it's a small plot, you can still convince people it's bigger than usual
general 2020-11-22 00:01:43 As long as you don't go outside
general 2020-11-22 00:03:29 What if you made separate pictures for separate rooms, and pretend you're living in some sort of big fancy luxury suite/house

Nobody will tell with good enough AR
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 00:04:57 Bless me with with your art magic
general 2020-11-22 00:05:52 <@746204423793016873> If you're going for the Pi route, get a Raspberry Pi 400, it's a more complete PC
general 2020-11-22 00:06:33 It's still the same Pi
general 2020-11-22 00:06:39 Just with a keyboard added
general 2020-11-22 00:07:00 If you need it open, you can still use the Pi 4
general 2020-11-22 00:07:54 Still has USB, and the GPI/O port, and other ports from previous Pis
general 2020-11-22 00:08:20 Hardware's a little enhanced
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 00:09:54 But he must descend his skills onto us
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 00:09:58 We must learn
general 2020-11-22 00:10:24 Cringe advertisement
general 2020-11-22 00:10:49 <@409676438682206218>
general 2020-11-22 00:10:52 Contest please
general 2020-11-22 00:11:01 Context*
general 2020-11-22 00:11:22 Why do I have a feeling its a face people do
general 2020-11-22 00:12:12 I'm confused
general 2020-11-22 00:12:24 For I know nothing about this
general 2020-11-22 00:12:34 Pure? What's that
general 2020-11-22 00:12:47 I've already seen a lot of NSFW
general 2020-11-22 00:14:23 I need a confusion be gone
general 2020-11-22 00:15:55 You wanna know one of the things I've seen even worse than aero morphs 

I'll tell you in DMs
general 2020-11-22 00:19:50 You have smoked the high plant
general 2020-11-22 00:20:15 <@456226577798135808> What if it makes you Elon Musk
general 2020-11-22 00:21:14 My brain still remembers highly detailed pics relating to inserting people into your body in many strange ways
general 2020-11-22 00:23:52 I will wait for context now 

Oh and I once got raided with NSFL pictures, a really disfigured man with bloody needles all over his body
general 2020-11-22 00:24:07 It was in a Pokemon server
general 2020-11-22 00:24:33 I need to know the context Shinji
general 2020-11-22 00:24:54 I need to not lag here also
general 2020-11-22 00:25:03 Because crapphone
general 2020-11-22 00:26:54 It's gone and done a long time ago, back when I was new to Discord, young but legally allowed on Discord
general 2020-11-22 00:27:57 It's some years ago, at that point you can't recover anything from thar
general 2020-11-22 00:29:57 ||Imagine man, now imagine a hospital like setting, now imagine the process of gelatinization and irreversible disfiguration setting in, now imagine he's also bleeding and covered with needles||

tl;dr, Dr. Frankenstein has went too far
general 2020-11-22 00:30:29 Now imagine its hyperrealistic
general 2020-11-22 00:31:36 On the otherhand playing all three Bioshock games this should be tame for me now
general 2020-11-22 00:31:49 Not unlike *the other* image I've seen
general 2020-11-22 00:32:08 Let's stop
general 2020-11-22 00:32:18 Hello Tar
general 2020-11-22 00:32:53 Juc
general 2020-11-22 00:35:14 I'm still on baby steps for programming
general 2020-11-22 00:36:23 Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio Community exists
general 2020-11-22 00:36:36 Microsoft make IDE
general 2020-11-22 00:37:05 An integrated development environment
general 2020-11-22 00:37:30 Search up Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code to know more about it
general 2020-11-22 00:37:44 Make the remake have space
general 2020-11-22 00:37:47 We need more life
general 2020-11-22 00:37:57 Like actual space exploration
general 2020-11-22 00:38:53 Rick, there's a Microsoft community
general 2020-11-22 00:38:59 Like an actual Microsoft Discord
general 2020-11-22 00:39:40 I also know some people at a Linux community who's also into programming
general 2020-11-22 00:39:43 Actually wait
general 2020-11-22 00:39:57 That community has a lot of programming nerds who like Ubuntu
general 2020-11-22 00:40:08 I stayed because it's a chill place
general 2020-11-22 00:40:59 They also talk about other distros, some use for example RHEL
general 2020-11-22 00:41:04 OpenSUSE
general 2020-11-22 00:41:07 Etc.
general 2020-11-22 00:41:23 Yes they talk about that too
general 2020-11-22 00:41:31 Ocassionally
general 2020-11-22 00:42:38 Is metal stronger?
general 2020-11-22 00:42:59 Are metal blocks stronger than default?
general 2020-11-22 00:43:20 <@305442286861549580> Right click and save image
general 2020-11-22 00:44:07 <@305442286861549580> Do me, make your own server to stash your stuff in
general 2020-11-22 00:44:22 And yes you can plug your phone into your conputer
general 2020-11-22 00:45:24 Still, there are better ways of doing it instead of posting it in a public server where its likely to get lost
general 2020-11-22 00:46:06 <@305442286861549580> Also I suggest you check a site called the drawing database
general 2020-11-22 00:46:32 A blueprint website
general 2020-11-22 00:47:08 I
general 2020-11-22 00:47:24 Just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
general 2020-11-22 00:47:36 Don't tell me you're too shy to see
general 2020-11-22 00:47:52 Never
general 2020-11-22 00:48:35 Thanks 

I like messing with people
general 2020-11-22 00:58:33 So I made my brother a starter jet, guess what colors he gave it
general 2020-11-22 00:59:09 
general 2020-11-22 00:59:11 
general 2020-11-22 00:59:14 And now for the moment of truth
general 2020-11-22 00:59:19 Perry the Platypus
general 2020-11-22 00:59:35 I mean it's not the worst thing I've seen
general 2020-11-22 01:00:16 Now I just realized why it was a good idea to use a Northrop F-5 like nose
general 2020-11-22 01:01:10 I gave it a trapezoidal wing so it'll have good roll
general 2020-11-22 01:01:13 Alongside big elevators
general 2020-11-22 01:01:24 While having low drag
general 2020-11-22 01:22:45 A warn usually has a cooldown
general 2020-11-22 01:22:49 Of a month
general 2020-11-22 01:22:50 I think
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 01:23:01 Finally managed to do STOVL
general 2020-11-22 01:23:24 You just pinged it
general 2020-11-22 01:23:59 I mean the server forces you to use a Roblox username anyways
general 2020-11-22 01:24:10 I also have an alt named DenseReptile
general 2020-11-22 01:27:22 Fabric wheels do a great job of slowing down aircraft
general 2020-11-22 01:27:41 Pretty much
general 2020-11-22 01:27:57 I've set their motor 2s to speed 5-10 with max torque
general 2020-11-22 01:28:30 Is it technically vertical landing if I have to use elevators to assist two super rockets stowed in front?
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 01:34:15 What if VTOL Bob Ross head
general 2020-11-22 01:37:35 you are doge
general 2020-11-22 01:37:40 you must take ftrookie's place
general 2020-11-22 01:38:03 <@!720891502108344360> You must take FtRookie's place now
general 2020-11-22 01:38:06 For he is gone
general 2020-11-22 01:38:40 He's permabanned
general 2020-11-22 01:40:20 He shitposted one last time
general 2020-11-22 01:40:46 what is this chat
general 2020-11-22 01:40:50 He's permbanned now
general 2020-11-22 01:41:47 I have an idea for art, this
general 2020-11-22 01:42:34 Make RickPhone running RickjeOS
general 2020-11-22 01:43:19 It's a Sony Ericsson W595 that I searched up randomly
general 2020-11-22 01:43:40 I mean if you want something that looks odder
general 2020-11-22 01:43:44 Look at the Nokia N-Gage
general 2020-11-22 01:43:49 Aka, the Taco Phone

general 2020-11-22 01:45:32 They're only N-Gaging in how weird it is
general 2020-11-22 01:45:44 Otherwise not really a phone that would N-gage anyone
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 01:51:08 
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 01:51:08 
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 01:51:12 Normal day within a public server
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 01:51:50 They don't even know what actual hacking is
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 01:52:07 <@!720891502108344360> If you're a hacker, would you reveal your intentions before or after you hacked?
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 01:52:34 Most ransomware says the latter
general 2020-11-22 02:03:03 I had a stroke reading that

plane-crazy 2020-11-22 02:29:17 A ramp intake, kinda like those in Panavia Tornado and the F-14 Tomcat also?
general 2020-11-22 02:30:35 How to gain more speed? Multiple conveyor drives?
general 2020-11-22 02:30:53 If I have to make a controllable interceptor
general 2020-11-22 02:30:59 I have to make it faster than 10k
general 2020-11-22 02:31:16 Because rn my fighters have that as a speed ceilling
help 2020-11-22 02:33:04 Does the speed boosting effects of conveyor drives stack up or is it only as fast as the fastest conveyor drive?
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 02:34:38 Make an Air Bus
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 02:35:05 I'm just waiting in <#478584971670454284>
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 02:35:17 To see if the effects of two conveyor drives stack up
help 2020-11-22 02:36:48 If it does, then I should aim to make a 20k sps interceptor
help 2020-11-22 02:36:56 Or at least 15k
help 2020-11-22 02:37:49 I was asking if two conveyor drives speed boosting would stack up
help 2020-11-22 02:38:17 I.E A single conveyor drive would reach 10k, can another conveyor drive be added to reach 20k
general 2020-11-22 02:45:59 You have a big forehead

general 2020-11-22 02:49:46 What's motor bending?
general 2020-11-22 02:50:06 big brain boi

general 2020-11-22 02:51:16 I am potato
general 2020-11-22 03:57:18 Jokes aside if you can make a plane go 10k with complete control and no spasming then you've done good

That honestly looks trippy
general 2020-11-22 03:58:18 I think motor bending should be kept as a feature
general 2020-11-22 03:58:35 I mean, you could make better curves
general 2020-11-22 03:59:24 Let's give it some time for people to make ideas
general 2020-11-22 04:00:00 Ballasts suck for VTOL
general 2020-11-22 04:00:09 It also sucks when you want a plane to do a cobra
general 2020-11-22 04:00:23 My latest design does STOVL
general 2020-11-22 04:00:33 Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing
general 2020-11-22 04:01:05 I would do VTOL but there's not enough space
general 2020-11-22 04:02:11 I need free nobux

general 2020-11-22 04:04:47 I will be unfunni lizard man
general 2020-11-22 04:05:15 Now close it
general 2020-11-22 04:05:19 Or eat pant
general 2020-11-22 04:06:05 Send a DMCA Strike
general 2020-11-22 04:06:57 Make a sine wave, inventer
general 2020-11-22 04:07:02 We need the smooth wave
general 2020-11-22 04:07:14 Oh wait you did
general 2020-11-22 04:07:44 You forgot to request
general 2020-11-22 04:08:07 Honestly it'd time consuming to automatically give you the roles
general 2020-11-22 04:08:15 The moderators aren't bots
general 2020-11-22 04:08:32 Oh Vilde's here
general 2020-11-22 04:08:49 Do your thing Batroach
general 2020-11-22 04:08:52 Give this man a rank
general 2020-11-22 04:10:03 Are gradients a good idea?
general 2020-11-22 04:10:13 When painting an aircraft
general 2020-11-22 04:10:23 I mean it's simple
general 2020-11-22 04:10:41 It's not hard to screw up a gradient
general 2020-11-22 04:11:11 Then give your tongue the healing stuff
general 2020-11-22 04:11:23 Seriously go treat that now you can Discord later
general 2020-11-22 04:12:07 So first of all, is it on a hill? Is it driving up the hill?
general 2020-11-22 04:12:39 If it is then A and B would be possible 

If it is on a flat surface, then it's C if you're driving fast
general 2020-11-22 04:12:49 On the other hand, it's just an image
general 2020-11-22 04:12:55 It doesn't say it's moving
general 2020-11-22 04:13:16 Like the image is just saying "which of these trucks are driving"
general 2020-11-22 04:13:42 But then, are these trucks actually moving or is it just staying still
general 2020-11-22 04:13:59 Gotta eat
general 2020-11-22 04:14:15 My answer is both all and neither, not enough info

general 2020-12-07 11:04:20 R
help 2020-12-07 15:06:20 Balance it out with how you distribute power, or if lazy use ballasts
help 2020-12-07 15:07:43 I suggest if reducing power by replacing super rockets with regular rocket engines, and changing up the placement of the VTOL engines
help 2020-12-07 15:08:16 Ballasts have an affect on maneuverability and the weight a VTOL can carry
help 2020-12-07 15:08:58 Honestly though its fine if it's STOVL since that's how most aircraft work operationally in real life
general 2020-12-07 15:10:43 So, the BAE Harrier does VTOL through extensive use of pure thrust vectoring, right?
general 2020-12-07 15:11:05 Is that the reason why it's subsonic, because of leeched power
general 2020-12-07 15:12:50 Bees, with Barry B. Benson
general 2020-12-07 15:13:23 I mean you read the rules, gotta oblige

general 2020-12-07 15:14:28 Second, give wings
general 2020-12-07 15:14:56 Why'd you think we'd called him Batroach
general 2020-12-07 15:15:04 Even before this
general 2020-12-07 15:15:57 Even Vilde agrees with batroach
general 2020-12-07 15:16:37 Hello Karen
general 2020-12-07 15:16:56 As if that hasn't been done before
general 2020-12-07 15:17:52 But constantly in a state of braindeaderism
general 2020-12-07 15:19:10 I'mma get something
general 2020-12-07 15:20:49 This is the kind of stuff I've gotten myself into while I was away 

As you can see, nothing changed, just more braindead
general 2020-12-07 15:22:14 I might do that landing gear Blob did just because it actually works without sacrificing width
general 2020-12-07 15:23:02 Why is that cursed alien here
general 2020-12-07 15:23:45 Imagine if that's how humans communicated 

By peeing on each other
general 2020-12-07 15:24:46 Wait, is it possible that if one were to waste their life, would it be possible for a human to communicate with a lobster
general 2020-12-07 15:25:21 It's exactly what it sounds
general 2020-12-07 15:25:38 Waste a good chunk do your time, learning lobster
general 2020-12-07 15:25:42 To talk to lobsters
general 2020-12-07 15:26:44 Careful, lobster claws looking sharp
general 2020-12-07 15:26:55 You don't want to piss it off
general 2020-12-07 15:27:31 Hmm yes HTML
general 2020-12-07 15:28:04 What's better 

Crab or lobster
general 2020-12-07 15:28:29 But crab do rave and underpays squids and sponges
general 2020-12-07 15:29:11 Crab also bring out knife to protect bears
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 15:30:31 Round

plane-crazy 2020-12-07 15:30:51 This breaks the Plane Crazy laws of physics

general 2020-12-07 15:37:35 Bans, and levelling
general 2020-12-07 15:38:15 First ping from ducc
general 2020-12-07 15:40:08 Someone make an Ilyushin Il-62 and pull a Cobra maneuver with it
general 2020-12-07 15:40:35 I heard it could pull off one
general 2020-12-07 15:40:54 An air liner, doing a form of a a Cobra maneuver, during landing
general 2020-12-07 15:41:12 But it's subsonic
general 2020-12-07 15:41:22 And doesn't have crazy long front landing gear
general 2020-12-07 15:42:51 Is the lt in Dassault silent?
general 2020-12-07 15:43:04 If it does
general 2020-12-07 15:43:27 Then the Dassault Rafale would be called "the sow raffle"
general 2020-12-07 15:44:02 Watch Ren's and Prototrode's tutorial
general 2020-12-07 15:44:16 Better hope Rick does the map revamp
general 2020-12-07 15:44:40 Supersonic dogfighting is sorta lacking
general 2020-12-07 15:44:48 Map too small
general 2020-12-07 15:47:15 Honestly I'd rather focus on optimizing the map, that is, make the rendering job easier for the player and bring improvements and more features that'll satisfy everyone, to your typical jet builders to the suspension bois to even your local build pro like miner
general 2020-12-07 15:48:25 Laptop fans though
general 2020-12-07 15:48:41 I've actually placed my hand close but not blocking an exhaust port
general 2020-12-07 15:48:53 It feels warm enough actually
general 2020-12-07 15:49:45 So, what does it mean if a jet stalls even with conveyor drives?
general 2020-12-07 15:50:08 Stop you're triggering my arachnophobia
general 2020-12-07 15:50:43 But it has many kegs, like a spider
general 2020-12-07 15:51:23 I used it omg my brother's little private jet 

I decided to take advantage of it anyways so he'll have a harder time trying to screw up his plane
general 2020-12-07 15:52:05 On my planes though I use conveyor drives as my main engine
general 2020-12-07 15:52:35 Conveyor drives honestly work better for me than super rockets could ever do
general 2020-12-07 15:53:01 The only thing I missed though was my ability to pull off a supersonic Cobra maneuver

general 2020-12-08 02:17:34 I'm still too dumb to get how people design aircraft tails
general 2020-12-08 02:25:00 this looks painfully awkward to look at

plane-crazy 2020-12-08 02:46:22 What should I build

Military transport, bomber or airliner
general 2020-12-08 02:46:39 One more ban I might get permed

general 2020-12-08 02:53:36 Why does everyone in your family have to be named obcpro
general 2020-12-08 03:06:27 All I know is "haha funni rabbit man with magic hammer"
general 2020-12-08 03:07:05 because obc is handsome/hot/your preferred word
general 2020-12-08 03:07:55 <@!195253906333368320> Why yes it is a weird reason, but since when did I not make the chat weird
general 2020-12-08 03:08:48 Then that would mean you'd be excessively interested in yourself but you know you're never gonna approve of yourself
general 2020-12-08 03:09:35 Make it a rule so people know not to ping

general 2020-12-08 03:39:48 You using a phone then?
general 2020-12-08 03:40:21 <@!347182144873037824> What kind of calculator are you using that has the resolution of a low-end phone
general 2020-12-08 03:40:57 Over here we use Casio
general 2020-12-08 03:42:05 Honestly that's a pretty high-res for a calculator
general 2020-12-08 03:42:33 wat
general 2020-12-08 03:42:46 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio
general 2020-12-08 03:48:42 Calculators will eventually become Nokias
general 2020-12-08 03:50:06 <@347182144873037824> Your calculator has a headphone jack right? Cause those are basically cheap USB ports for Texas Instruments
general 2020-12-08 03:51:03 Oh, some calculators I know have round ports, similar to a headphone jack
general 2020-12-08 03:51:14 Mine doesn't have any, just a basic calculator
general 2020-12-08 03:51:55 Imagine running Symbian OS on a calculator
general 2020-12-08 03:52:17 Symbian being the OS Nokia uses before moving to Android
general 2020-12-08 03:53:46 So basically, we need weather
general 2020-12-08 03:53:56 So air traffic control would have a purpose then
general 2020-12-08 03:54:10 So more roleplayers
general 2020-12-08 03:54:15 Actually wait
general 2020-12-08 03:54:24 More strategic battles
general 2020-12-08 03:54:31 That's better
general 2020-12-08 03:54:59 The pros being now you need a navigator to guide you within fog
general 2020-12-08 03:55:47 For the radar part, could imagine people making stealth planes
general 2020-12-08 03:56:23 If I remember, horizontal surfaces are better against radar compared to vertical surfaces
general 2020-12-08 03:57:35 What if an accelerometer added, so you can make mechanisms that react based on their orientation
general 2020-12-08 03:58:17 Would go great alongside multi keybinds
general 2020-12-08 03:58:52 Perhaps the accelerometer block would lock with a specific keybind. A case I could imagine would be self correcting planes
general 2020-12-08 03:59:09 Wait that sounds a lot like fly by wire
general 2020-12-08 04:23:09 I have suggested another block that senses stuff
general 2020-12-08 04:23:29 Depressed puri
general 2020-12-08 04:28:01 Still, it would be neat
general 2020-12-08 04:28:19 A lot of stuff nowadays is computer assisted
general 2020-12-08 04:29:18 That and multi-keybinds would work well
general 2020-12-08 04:30:41 Braindamage

general 2020-12-09 04:30:54 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancor_Jackhammer
general 2020-12-09 04:33:38 <@!403843930543882241> Apparently the US classified the Pancor Jackhammer as a machine gun

*It may not be the best looking, but perhaps it was fast*
general 2020-12-09 04:33:58 "Though unconventional, the Jackhammer can best be described as a gas-operated revolver. Many parts were constructed of Rynite polymer to reduce weight. Layout was of a bullpup configuration with a 10-round revolving cylinder that fired conventional, 12-gauge shells. The cylinder's method of rotation was very similar to the Webley–Fosbery Automatic Revolver, an operating rod being used to rotate the cylinder."
general 2020-12-09 04:34:06 Apparently it can go either semi-auto to full auto
general 2020-12-09 04:34:18 so yes very stronk if it existed

general 2020-12-09 04:51:33 Apparently the F-16's elevators are anhedral

general 2020-12-09 04:54:43 So let's tell F-16 builders that to get it accurate, you gotta include the anhedral angle

general 2020-12-09 05:19:20 I am now thinking of why 5
general 2020-12-09 05:19:56 Your mom needs more than 5 to operate her, she's too big
general 2020-12-09 05:20:02 and too heavy
general 2020-12-09 05:20:41 Your mom I will call the FGW, or fat giant woman
general 2020-12-09 05:21:08 Which means you need the whole US army just to get her
general 2020-12-09 05:21:43 That's why I said fat giant woman
general 2020-12-09 05:22:06 Your mom's the property of the US Army now, congrats on having a warmachine in the family
general 2020-12-09 05:23:28 Imagine getting crushed by fat

general 2020-12-09 05:28:36 you people will enjoy it
general 2020-12-09 05:28:39 I must make it painful

plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:31:19 Use motor angling for the elevators, because the elevators are anhedral
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:32:04 I use springs to delay the motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:32:09 Sideways placed springs
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:32:36 It completely pops off but leaves a mess of springs behind

plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:37:31 is it me or is this guy mentally unde?
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:38:08 sleep then
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:38:42 I have a way to do motor angling like it's a motor 2
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:38:47 but it needs space
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:38:51 for disconnectors
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:39:25 Basically, use physical blocks to limit the travel of something, and use disconnectors so it'll pop off as soon as you lock it
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:42:59 That's why I said to use disconnectors, so the physical stops won't become a part of the plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:43:15 It'll basically be left behind
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:44:23 results should end up similar to this
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:51:53 because it's a testbed
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:51:56 for wing angling
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:52:28 I'm not sure if there's any apparent effects
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 05:52:42 Should test it with angling and without angling
general 2020-12-09 05:53:08 Can we actually get that wheel

general 2020-12-09 12:36:48 This is video is premiered, not live

general 2020-12-09 12:57:59 So before I left
general 2020-12-09 12:58:23 I told them to know what's really horrifying, close the video and take a deep close look into a mirror
general 2020-12-09 13:00:47 How does one not understand to just temporarily visit Discord
general 2020-12-09 13:00:59 And how does one not understand basic internet stuff like AI
general 2020-12-09 13:01:15 Like YouTube ain't gonna manually weed out actual scam links
general 2020-12-09 13:01:22 Instead they just turn off all links
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:04:57 I wonder how I'm gonna fit a custom engine on aircraft with a height of two blocks (excluding the canopy)
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:06:05 Actually let me rephrase that
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:06:25 I wonder how I'm gonna fit a custom exhaust nozzle on a plane that's only two blocks tall
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:06:39 I never use anything other than conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:06:52 Hover drives don't work for me, at least pretty easily
Magnet drives are too laggy
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:06:56 And there's no expand tool
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:07:16 There isn't this ain't Build a Boat
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:07:31 Then you're not playing Plane Crazy
general 2020-12-10 04:09:07 How does someone think there's an expand tool alongside "my version of Plane Crazy"
general 2020-12-10 04:09:08 I don't get it
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:09:36 Personally I find conveyor drives to be stable
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:09:46 Unless something collides into it
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:10:11 I use the most basic of conveyor drives, and it gets the job done
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:10:17 Actually pretty well for my needs
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:11:56 <@!676162260925808650> Here's one of my older designs doing fine using a conveyor drive as a main engine
https://streamable.com/4bud3o
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:12:07 Honestly I never used super rockets nowadays, only conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:12:15 The only time I use them is for VTOL
general 2020-12-10 04:12:35 <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:12:50 Magnet drives are too laggy for me
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:13:04 Plus doesn't really have any advantages over conveyor drives for me
general 2020-12-10 04:13:21 He confused it for another game
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:13:35 Then you have a gaming PC
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:14:05 Yes, unless said magnet drives are low-powered
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:14:40 You have one if those magnets have it's strength set high
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:14:51 And you don't lag at all
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:15:28 So that's why, it's not even set to it's maximum strength/power
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:15:47 It gets laggier to the point where it's better to use conveyor drives in the first place
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:16:05 Considering you could easily reach a speed of 10,000 sps without lagging
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:18:04 <@!676162260925808650> I've done that multiple times
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:18:15 All it takes is good wing design, weight balance and of course conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:18:56 And how does that affect what I've said
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:19:17 People still do it anyways
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:19:50 Besides it gives you a speed advantage
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 04:20:17 Besides it's common to see planes go 2k
general 2020-12-10 04:20:46 what channel is that
general 2020-12-10 04:23:15 "anime letters"
general 2020-12-10 04:23:18 Should I tell him
general 2020-12-10 04:24:45 He has gotten two things wrong already
general 2020-12-10 04:24:51 But I'll only point out one mistake
general 2020-12-10 04:25:00 Avatar The Last Airbender isn't an anime
general 2020-12-10 04:25:05 It's an American animated series
general 2020-12-10 04:25:19 As American as Nickelodeon itself
general 2020-12-10 04:25:33 As for the other obvious mistake, I'm not pointing it out
general 2020-12-10 04:25:45 You really need to learn about other countries
general 2020-12-10 04:26:01 <@!676162260925808650> Specificially, Asia
general 2020-12-10 04:26:26 Search up the writing system of Japan
general 2020-12-10 04:27:09 It's Japanese

Honestly I don't even know anymore whether this is trolling or just pure disappointment
general 2020-12-10 04:27:51 <@!676162260925808650> Honestly there's people that dumb on the internet
general 2020-12-10 04:28:30 At least you've only seen regular femboys

general 2020-12-10 04:32:01 the big gae
general 2020-12-10 04:32:56 I've once messed with Vixxage by sending them furry images
general 2020-12-10 04:33:11 Especially while they're 📯
general 2020-12-10 04:33:16 So even further pain
general 2020-12-10 04:33:22 I like making Vix be in pain
general 2020-12-10 04:34:34 I already told them that multiple times

general 2020-12-10 05:08:54 That's one curvy Blackbird
general 2020-12-10 05:34:17 Meanwhile I have to ***s h a r e***
general 2020-12-10 05:34:21 so I setup a trap
general 2020-12-10 05:34:44 Get crushed by a plot sized ballast platform
general 2020-12-10 05:37:29 <@!347182144873037824> Then I'll keep the cage, but add a plot sized spinner
general 2020-12-10 05:37:47 The cage is to make sure nobody escapes
general 2020-12-10 05:38:35 <@!347182144873037824> I can blacklist them also, but on the other hand

Does collision still occur if your build is in build mode
general 2020-12-10 05:39:00 Because the cage is plot sized, and if collision does occur in build mode
general 2020-12-10 05:39:04 Well you're still not gonna escape
general 2020-12-10 05:39:40 <@!363742162757877761> About messing with people when sharing plots
general 2020-12-10 05:40:07 Yes, that's what I thought we were talking about
general 2020-12-10 05:40:16 o h
general 2020-12-10 05:40:43 it's fine
general 2020-12-10 05:41:00 I might add a cross/spinner just to glitch builds
general 2020-12-10 05:41:12 <@!347182144873037824> It happened before, blame Plane Crazy being a bit buggy
general 2020-12-10 05:41:52 Nah, think of it as two separate plots within a single space
general 2020-12-10 05:42:30 <@!347182144873037824> This is what I did previously before moving onto the cage with a falling ballast roof https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/777076321804353556
general 2020-12-10 05:43:27 People still managed to escape which is why I did something else
general 2020-12-10 05:43:36 I might replace that folding wall
general 2020-12-10 05:43:51 Because I can
general 2020-12-10 05:44:08 It's not everyday you get to take advantage of it
general 2020-12-10 05:45:14 It's anchored
general 2020-12-10 05:45:21 Of course I'd anchor it
general 2020-12-10 05:45:35 The ballast roof though, no
general 2020-12-10 05:46:29 But then there's a literally a plot sized ballast platform crushing it
general 2020-12-10 05:46:46 It'd probably have a hard time balancing itself to begin with
general 2020-12-10 05:46:56 Unless it somehow glitches through
general 2020-12-10 05:48:09 <@!347182144873037824> Well, it's TNT balls on the floor, a max density ballast roof that's about to fall and the cage while only blocks the sides of the plot, is anchored
general 2020-12-10 05:48:12 Though it has a flaw
general 2020-12-10 05:48:15 It's interlaced
general 2020-12-10 05:48:30 Meaning if you somehow ragdolled your way out, then congrats
general 2020-12-10 05:49:02 If it isn't PvP, I dunno maybe the balls will bug the platform a bit
general 2020-12-10 05:49:56 Well, that's if you can spin your way out
general 2020-12-10 05:50:26 I think you could, but you'd have to ragdoll your way out of the horziontally interlaced cage
general 2020-12-10 05:50:39 |=| sorta shaped like this, but more horizontal lines
general 2020-12-10 05:50:43 And as a ox

plane-crazy 2020-12-10 06:14:46 This is a very old plane I did, when I was fairly new to the game
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 06:15:10 And other massive aircraft advice
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 06:15:21 Apart from the obvious add more wedges/curves
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 06:16:20 yes, but what if I wanted to apply it on a double decker plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 06:16:58 I'll go do that then, but curve a bit more
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 06:17:19 Shouldn't be that different from what I do now, just upscaled
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 06:17:25 Very upscaled
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 06:17:37 hmm yes

plane-crazy 2020-12-10 06:17:56 Who made that anyways

general 2020-12-10 08:08:27 it is a simple question
the-dump 2020-12-10 08:08:50 hmm this looks basic
the-dump 2020-12-10 08:08:53 I must improve it
the-dump 2020-12-10 08:09:01 nah just some random user

the-dump 2020-12-10 08:16:19 nah I won't edit
the-dump 2020-12-10 08:16:23 Unless there's another online tool for that

plane-crazy 2020-12-10 08:29:21 there's hands, but no mouth
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 08:29:23 so add mouth
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 08:29:55 oh i meant mouth that opens and closes
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 08:30:23 o h

general 2020-12-10 09:51:46 8 sounds more reasonable
general 2020-12-10 09:52:08 Considering we usually don't do beyond 8 MB normally anyways
general 2020-12-10 09:52:20 Perhaps its a link?
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 09:57:42 Any regrets?
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 09:59:07 F-117, the stealth attack aircraft?
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 10:00:21 Now try reaching 1-2k speed/sps, or for a real challenge do 10,000 sps
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 10:16:00 Actually it's very stable
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 10:16:50 More so with a well designed aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 10:17:23 In fact you can use it as a main engine
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 10:58:48 You ask someone who knows how to
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 11:06:40 About the multi-rank thing?
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 11:06:51 I mean technically you should
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 11:07:26 I mean if you made a Harrier, it's still an aircraft/plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 11:07:32 And it's still VTOL
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 11:07:43 So you should get both (assuming both can be ranked up)
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 11:14:20 Then it would be pointless
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 11:14:41 No
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 11:15:06 The point of the A-10 is to be a mass-produced attack aircraft that isn't expensive to produce yet is strong and reliable
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 11:15:28 VTOL isn't needed, just adds unneeded complexity

general 2020-12-11 06:41:55 back from lunch
general 2020-12-11 06:46:27 Firstly, the wings. I feel like a 1x1 delta would've been a better shape. The rudder seems decent. The elevators could've been anhedral

The colors, try using more variety. Avoid using the default white as the main color.

For the body. From the top view the nose looks a bit too rough. The canopy's fine though what's with the half blocks behind it? I suppose maybe a bit more smoothening?

Other stuff would be try to use custom landing gear and a custom exhaust nozzle <@!499705220637392897>

general 2020-12-11 06:48:37 Understandable, it's either stay at the size you're working with or try to make it a little larger to ease with adding details

general 2020-12-11 07:16:29 The one on the right
general 2020-12-11 07:20:56 It'll make the axe more silky
general 2020-12-11 07:28:57 I prefer swords over axes, has speed and sweep advantage
general 2020-12-11 07:29:11 The sweep only comes in handy if you time it right though
general 2020-12-11 07:29:57 It does
general 2020-12-11 07:30:02 Though kinda slow for my tastes
general 2020-12-11 07:30:43 If I were to play an FPS, I'd go for an assault rifle over a shotgun
general 2020-12-11 07:30:49 Or whatever the axe is comparable to
general 2020-12-11 07:31:37 I just thought of something, how often do burst fire weapons even exist on Roblox
general 2020-12-11 07:32:11 The world would be my slaughterhouse (unless fighting a Ghast or something)
general 2020-12-11 07:32:33 I mean I might as well use it
general 2020-12-11 07:32:44 Actually I feel like it'd be more suited to a mob form
general 2020-12-11 07:32:52 You wouldn't waste more valueable swords

general 2020-12-12 01:03:48 that is true awkwardness
general 2020-12-12 01:07:22 reusable soviet rocket
general 2020-12-12 01:08:25 is there a soviet elon musk?
general 2020-12-12 01:13:05 hmm yes real estate
general 2020-12-12 01:13:28 Could do a 3+3 with economy class seats
general 2020-12-12 01:13:53 Or fit bombs and tiny planes
general 2020-12-12 01:14:13 That's if said tiny plane is 7 blocks wide
general 2020-12-12 01:15:09 is it me or are shredders becoming common again, on top of other noob builds
general 2020-12-12 01:15:14 like grabbers
general 2020-12-12 01:24:10 why is there a sleeping anime girl

general 2020-12-12 01:27:41 unintentional suggestiveness
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:46:39 I can see why I don't do large aircraft

*this kinda sucks*
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:47:09 I struggle too much with large scale stuff
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:48:14 I don't think I can cram a motor lock for a plane the size of three folds
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:48:23 Or at least effectively
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:49:31 I did that before

looks very sharp
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:50:02 actually boeing 747 very sharp

this happened
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:51:44 please proceed to cry in pain
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:52:07 that's the point

s i z e
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:52:14 I'm aiming for ***b i g***
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:53:04 9 blocks tall, 7 blocks wide

well at least it's larger than my previous plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:55:41 Knowing me

I just want it to be big
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:55:46 But not looking like a flying block
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:56:22 I gave up on trying to do real life planes
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:56:29 I would've given up by then
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:57:54 I mean why would I do something more than what I can do
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:59:02 I prefer gradual increases instead of a steep climb
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 01:59:21 So personally, I'd rather do my own thing before doing real life stuff
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:00:11 <@!273536574770380800> Still not worth the effort for me personally to force myself into perfecting the nose of a real life aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:00:34 I didn't play Plane Crazy to be a perfectionist immediately
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:01:54 Personally I don't aim too high, if it comes crashing down you'd be hurt more than if you kept it more conservative
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:04:46 If it looks decent, then I upvote, that is, if it's proportions are good enough
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:05:10 If it's close enough, I wouldn't notice
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:05:48 yes that

if it's recognizeable then I upvote it
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:05:55 I don't how care how large or small the entire thing is
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:06:34 If stuff like say the wings of an aircraft aren't oversized or too small, then it can get an upvote
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:07:53 I still remember that one time someone made a Sukhoi with oversized rudders with an eye-stabbing cyan
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:07:56 It hurts
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:09:59 I just keep it simple and go for a bland grey
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:10:06 It won't stab your eyes, but it does look dull
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:10:17 At least the dull colors won't hurt as much
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:10:46 I keep forgetting about afterburners
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:11:44 <@!437152336176087052> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/779891906750185552/2020-11-21_12.png
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:11:46 I still remember this
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:11:47 It hurts
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:12:22 That plane feels like an itch I can't scratch
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:12:34 Like why the cyan and unbalanced wings
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:12:50 Like geez those rudders are as large or even larger than the main wing
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:13:19 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/779891906750185552/2020-11-21_12.png but still, these rudders outmatch the main wing
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:13:41 kinda doesn't fit with a fighter jet too
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:13:45 looks like it's torn from an airliner
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:14:32 I mean there exists that one forward swept American fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:14:39 The American equivalent of a Sukhoi Su-47
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:15:34 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Grumman-X29-InFlight.jpg
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:15:36 hmm yes very unstable
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:17:30 All I know is that unstable means you'd have an easier time to maneuver the thing, unless said thing is too unstable
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:17:51 In which in that case you'd need to constantly correct it's flight
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:19:49 Use a locked motor to rotate a piece
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:19:55 But make sure to delay the motor lock tower/whatever's your choice
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:19:59 Or it won't work
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:20:27 Or that too, you can use camera locking and camera angling
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:21:12 Honestly I'm too hungry to notice
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:22:20 What is this final warning the funni water disaster man is talking about
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:23:29 I haven't ate breakfast
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 02:23:42 So I didn't even knew there was an argument
the-dump 2020-12-12 02:27:06 something braindead

||There is a local bottling plant that sells purifiedwater14, with the plant taking advantage of the recent Tsunami2525. These bottles are then V0xelBox(ed), to which they are sent to a Jailbreakius in N0tNevada, where the warden is obcpro99, where the mascot of the prison is a Vildebeest||

general 2020-12-12 03:22:54 Y'all is a contraction
general 2020-12-12 03:23:18 Always contracting whether a build poob or not poob

general 2020-12-12 03:49:47 I'll just search up the MC-21's cockpit to see what I should do
general 2020-12-12 03:50:54 Rockwell Collins manufactured the cockpit didn't they?
general 2020-12-12 03:51:43 well, they do make cockpits
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 03:55:31 Intakes usually are placed at the sides, or if it's just a single intake something like the F-16 or Eurofighter Typhoon does
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 03:56:18 <@!553754576709353494> You could try ramp intakes, either fixed or variable. Nose intakes are possible, or just make a duct where air goes in either at the side or below the aircraft
general 2020-12-12 04:00:32 caveman*
general 2020-12-12 04:01:08 nah i see cavemen
general 2020-12-12 04:02:04 I just realized, I can reduce block count by making the ceiling of an aircraft out of wings
general 2020-12-12 04:02:30 I meant reduce block thickness
general 2020-12-12 04:03:10 Like instead of using 2 block spaces just so that passengers on the bottom deck don't see the floor of the upper deck
general 2020-12-12 04:03:18 It technically becomes 1 block space
general 2020-12-12 04:03:33 By covering the floor of the upper deck from below with wing panels
general 2020-12-12 04:03:47 So the bottom deck doesn't see the floor of the upper deck
general 2020-12-12 04:03:59 Which I can achieve by a single motor lock
general 2020-12-12 04:04:41 Basically I do something similar to this
general 2020-12-12 04:05:31 Did you expect me to do well with large aircraft noses?
general 2020-12-12 04:05:54 Don't expect that from me
general 2020-12-12 04:06:19 yes but designer

***no.***
general 2020-12-12 04:07:16 It's still better than the first time I made a large aircraft
general 2020-12-12 04:07:51 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/737219878414712882/RobloxScreenShot20200727_160630429.png
general 2020-12-12 04:08:19 this nose is worse
general 2020-12-12 04:08:26 it's just a literal stub
general 2020-12-12 04:08:37 no details
general 2020-12-12 04:17:52 Get Old Tycoon
general 2020-12-12 04:18:01 Where you get richer by being older
general 2020-12-12 04:18:42 So basically
general 2020-12-12 04:18:50 Add HoF builds with a filter
general 2020-12-12 04:19:02 Filter to make look nicer, or shaders, or something
general 2020-12-12 04:19:14 yes but don't be too clickbaity
general 2020-12-12 04:20:11 Plane Crazy is about building and shitposting
general 2020-12-12 04:20:35 Last time I made a buggy, it used tutorial wishbone suspension
general 2020-12-12 04:20:55 The only modifications that I did was add ropes so it can be adjusted
general 2020-12-12 04:21:12 Because of course I'd add ropes, it's one of the things I want from my suspension
general 2020-12-12 04:21:29 So it's less bouncy, and I can make it stiffer or softer on demand
general 2020-12-12 04:21:48 That video idea though, what if you got various clips from various submissions
general 2020-12-12 04:22:29 To bring attention to people who want a sandbox game?
general 2020-12-12 04:22:40 yes we must hold a contest
general 2020-12-12 04:22:55 ***you don't want undes in the game***
general 2020-12-12 04:23:26 Aren't they the same people who made "become a racist" ad?
general 2020-12-12 04:24:00 Don't go too far with the exaggeration, just enough so it's eye-catching
general 2020-12-12 04:24:30 The minty breath goes to your eyes?
general 2020-12-12 04:24:52 Do it, kinda miss when I saw big builds in PC
general 2020-12-12 04:24:57 Stuff that I actually enjoy seeing
general 2020-12-12 04:25:17 S-duct
general 2020-12-12 04:25:25 Make a pink battleship with furry ears, and make it go UwU
general 2020-12-12 04:25:53 Just big builds or effort placed builds in general
general 2020-12-12 04:25:59 Like most of the stuff I see are unde stuff
general 2020-12-12 06:41:01 Aerodynamicn't

general 2020-12-12 06:43:42 What's the difference between polish and Polish?

general 2020-12-12 06:56:32 Yes I know, but it just looks so weird from that angle
general 2020-12-12 06:56:36 Like it looks bald
general 2020-12-12 06:57:31 The B2's always Russian around

general 2020-12-12 08:48:10 Any suggestions on stuff to do
general 2020-12-12 08:48:16 Kinda braindead and bored to think up of anything

general 2020-12-12 08:51:26 A Spongebob meme
general 2020-12-12 08:52:07 I honestly don't know, but it's pretty popular over here

*And I don't like it*
general 2020-12-12 08:53:06 A lot of people here like it
general 2020-12-12 08:53:15 I just think it's "meh just another social media app but Chinese"
general 2020-12-12 08:54:06 I talked about it

I don't get how "privacy concerns" translates to "only banned in America"
general 2020-12-12 08:54:15 On the other hand I consider them close to being braindead
general 2020-12-12 08:54:55 Yes but I was talking about how I refuse to use it due to excessive privacy concerns
general 2020-12-12 08:55:13 Yet somehow they get "BaNnEd OnLy In UsA"
general 2020-12-12 08:55:31 Like I swear whenever you talk about something beyond their understanding they don't even attempt to turn on a single braincell
general 2020-12-12 08:55:57 Then I guess they never had a head then
general 2020-12-12 08:56:18 b i p l e n
general 2020-12-12 08:56:33 Kinda looks a bit blocky imo
general 2020-12-12 08:56:40 Or maybe that's just the front
general 2020-12-12 08:57:04 Okay it's a bit too blocky for my tastes
general 2020-12-12 08:57:28 Guess the angle just didn't show it right
general 2020-12-12 08:58:15 You could go for generic yellow, or you could go for green
general 2020-12-12 08:58:39 Go for green a lot of people have done yellow
general 2020-12-12 10:00:49 I think I'll go try some other games out, I play PC often
general 2020-12-12 10:13:45 Feeling casual today though

general 2020-12-12 13:02:40 My plane is approx. 36 blocks wide when unfolded

***it needs to be bigger***
general 2020-12-12 13:03:02 Considering I have to redo anyways anyone got an aircraft nose I could use?
general 2020-12-12 13:04:12 38*, I forgot the consider the elevators
general 2020-12-12 13:05:21 That fact that I can only do a 3+3 configuration means it's not large enough
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 13:08:21 Folding
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 13:09:23 I've only done one block thick wings, but this time I should try 3 blocks thick (2 if you don't count the motor locking
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 13:09:32 So that it'll end up having an actual aerofoil
general 2020-12-12 13:12:45 i want a better nose
general 2020-12-12 13:12:50 and larger size
general 2020-12-12 13:13:01 because yes to large aircraft
general 2020-12-12 13:13:10 Gotta try out that Airbus A380 2+3+2 config

general 2020-12-12 13:15:22 I must try 3+3+3
general 2020-12-12 13:15:27 That's if I can do it to begin with
general 2020-12-12 13:17:36 do not the deforest

general 2020-12-12 13:41:32 I seem to notice I like soft or fluffy legendaries

general 2020-12-12 13:44:50 i have an even more cursed Pokemon
general 2020-12-12 13:44:56 This time involving Mr. Mime
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 13:46:30 Normal PC stuff
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 13:47:21 hmm d e l t a
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 13:47:23 just delta
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 13:47:39 oh wait it's variable sweep
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 13:47:42 Everyone talking about F-14
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 13:47:51 But no Panavia Tornado or Dassault Mirage G
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 13:48:26 Why not Dassault Mirage G
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 13:48:37 Or Banana Tornado
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 13:51:18 I've seen that too much
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 13:51:53 I feel like I'm never gonna make variable sweep wings considering it bothers me it isn't perfectly seamless
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 13:53:24 Thought it also changes the center of lift
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 13:54:17 Honestly at that point we might as well have better aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 13:55:09 Semi-realistic is good
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 13:57:06 That would give chines more purpose then
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 13:57:44 Plane Crazy but it has inertia
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 13:59:46 In that case we should have two types of engines

Afterburning jet engines for military aircraft and normal jet engines for everyone else
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 14:00:29 Rocket engines can stay as rocket engines and maybe as makeshift turbojet
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 14:00:55 Actually, afterburning jet engines should have thrust vectoring
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 14:04:11 I mean Roblox has managed to hold up to our motor shenanigans, hasn't it
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 14:04:16 <@!437152336176087052>
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 14:05:40 And yet it still acts kinda buggy
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 14:06:25 I mean I can see why
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 14:06:39 Or maybe that's just because I can only build aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 14:06:47 And even then I'm not good at making it look good
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 14:07:19 Speaking of aircraft, I need an aircraft nose that can fit with a plane that can accomadate either a 2+3+2 configuration or a 3+3+3 seating configuration
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 14:07:52 I'm trying to expand considering...
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 14:08:03 this ain't big enough
plane-crazy 2020-12-12 14:08:11 Approximately 38 blocks wide
general 2020-12-13 01:52:37 I'm cringing a bit as I realize I'm doing a Boeing like nose.

L o n g
general 2020-12-13 01:52:52 This is even worse than the previous one I built
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 01:53:25 Does this look worse than my previous nose
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 01:54:12 This is the previous nose
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 01:54:29 I feel like the new nose I'm building is worse
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 01:54:44 wait is it seriously a ramp?
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 01:55:19 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Stridsvagn_103_Revinge_2013-1.jpg still looks rampy
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 01:55:29 And I still need help with aircraft noses
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 01:58:56 I'll just stick with b u l b
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 01:59:04 And just expand it
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 02:02:11 You're doing folding?
general 2020-12-13 02:03:50 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Boeing_314_Clipper-cropped.jpg this is a Boeing
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 02:04:49 Throttle what?
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 02:18:21 hmm yes 2+3+2, wonder if a 3+3+3 can fit
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 02:18:54 I'm just settling for "cringe boeing technique"
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 02:20:38 I'm bad at making them look good
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 02:20:58 I always find the part of "how do I make this look good" harder than "how do I make this fly"
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 02:25:13 Looks like I can't make it any larger without making the aerofoil abnormally thin
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 02:25:35 2+3+2 seating is pretty large anyways
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 02:26:24 Plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 02:26:34 Because yes to large
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 02:27:17 Large but Ugly 2: Electric Boogaloo

general 2020-12-13 02:45:24 I just realized why does Plane Crazy play elevator sounds when you place down a block
general 2020-12-13 02:51:30 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_An-22 why does the An-22 have this NATO reporting name
general 2020-12-13 02:54:26 I have managed to make the nose more hideous in exchange for a 2+3+2 seating layout
general 2020-12-13 02:55:40 Miner always impresses
general 2020-12-13 02:55:44 Meanwhile
general 2020-12-13 02:56:04 I made this hideous thing
general 2020-12-13 02:56:30 It's Santa going undercover
general 2020-12-13 02:58:03 What if I tried a triple decker aircraft?
general 2020-12-13 02:58:50 That hideous thing I'm making could be a triple decker
general 2020-12-13 02:59:42 I might make this a triple decker
general 2020-12-13 02:59:48 And maybe an additional deck for cargo
general 2020-12-13 03:00:02 Return of the Large but Ugly
general 2020-12-13 03:00:48 🅱️lane
general 2020-12-13 03:01:06 I honestly gave up
general 2020-12-13 03:02:11 Are there any decent aircraft that's 9 blocks wide or smaller?
general 2020-12-13 03:04:33 It's because I might wanna fit some aircraft in the ugly blane
general 2020-12-13 03:04:50 Ah yes
general 2020-12-13 03:04:55 The Fuck-1
general 2020-12-13 03:05:21 ah yes

Boeing 707 but AESA radar in the nose
general 2020-12-13 03:06:08 I live in the Philippines

We still have propeller based aircraft according to Wikipedia, most advanced aircraft being a KAI T-50
general 2020-12-13 03:06:38 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_JAS_39_Gripen#Philippines Though I read this
general 2020-12-13 03:06:57 We might potentially buy a Saab Gripen I heard
general 2020-12-13 03:07:23 I mean, it would be a good idea to train pilots for jet aircraft first, wouldn't it?
general 2020-12-13 03:07:59 No the closest you'll get to Euro is Dassault Rafale
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 03:08:13 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 03:08:36 expect this for the electric boogaloo
general 2020-12-13 03:08:54 yes but the rafale looks pretty similar
general 2020-12-13 03:09:05 It has canard delta, and s-ducts
general 2020-12-13 03:09:44 And the Rafale is twin engine
general 2020-12-13 03:09:46 Like Euro
general 2020-12-13 03:10:00 But European aircraft are nice
general 2020-12-13 03:10:28 "the Department of National Defense is more likely to buy the Gripen C/D over the US offer of F-16V Block 70/72."
I hear we're more likely to buy the Gripen over the F-16
general 2020-12-13 03:11:38 <@456226577798135808> What is that
general 2020-12-13 03:11:41 Looks Chinese
general 2020-12-13 03:12:09 It looks weird
general 2020-12-13 03:12:46 <@!738702049113538600> yes eunsoo it's the Korean jet trainer
general 2020-12-13 03:16:58 "Stainless steel is much cheaper than the carbon-fiber material that SpaceX initially aimed to use for Starship and Super Heavy, and the metal has other important advantages as well, Musk stressed. For example, stainless steel handles heating far better than carbon composites do, he said."

general 2020-12-13 03:26:32 Because I gave up
general 2020-12-13 03:26:38 I gave up on noses
general 2020-12-13 03:26:45 Because fuck noses they're too much effort

general 2020-12-13 03:29:05 This is just miniscule and uglier

general 2020-12-13 03:32:26 Let them waste time
general 2020-12-13 03:32:53 Honestly I might as well focus on fixing the technical aspects of my plane
general 2020-12-13 03:33:00 Instead of focusing on the nose
general 2020-12-13 03:33:09 Nah I'd rather let them waste time
general 2020-12-13 03:35:58 I have an excuse for large nose

general 2020-12-13 03:36:40 Anyways I responded to them before I leave
general 2020-12-13 03:36:45 My answer was "The answer is no"
general 2020-12-13 03:36:54 Just so I can confuse them even further

general 2020-12-13 03:38:11 it had a cold
general 2020-12-13 03:38:49 I'm lazy, so deal with cringe Boeing nose
general 2020-12-13 03:40:58 I tried that before, also gave people negative responses
general 2020-12-13 03:41:04 As in they say there's no nose
general 2020-12-13 03:41:34 I remember asking about it
general 2020-12-13 03:41:44 no nose and similar responses
general 2020-12-13 03:42:05 So I decided to try again but with an Ilyushin Il-62 style nose
general 2020-12-13 03:42:11 Then eventually Boeing nose
general 2020-12-13 03:43:20 Honestly it's not bad
general 2020-12-13 03:43:42 You still haven't met the people who do absolutely no nose
general 2020-12-13 03:43:47 As in it's not even smooth
general 2020-12-13 03:43:51 It's literally just a window
general 2020-12-13 03:46:04 I feel like the only thing I need to do is to remove most of the wedges and replace it with triangle wedge and triangle wedge blocks
general 2020-12-13 03:48:25 Still gotta figure how to scale up those noses
general 2020-12-13 03:49:39 yes and i don't have time for that
general 2020-12-13 03:50:44 I'm fine with just rebuilding the whole thing once it's proven to work
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 03:52:37 I started this year, within the first quarter of 2020

general 2020-12-13 04:44:20 Now you definitely don't have friction on the ground

Water 
Oil 
Aerogel
general 2020-12-13 04:45:15 If I remembwr, aero gel is very porous

general 2020-12-13 04:56:45 Liquid absorbs heat, air cools liquid
general 2020-12-13 05:37:49 I just realized something

The aircraft noses I've been shown today are more of a nose *diamond*, not the nose *cone* that I've been wanting to do
general 2020-12-13 05:38:36 Sounds like you're making a Transformer there
general 2020-12-13 05:44:36 Is the Boeing 747 nose cone more of a diamond?
general 2020-12-13 05:45:03 Because I just noticed a lot of Boeing 747 noses here are shaped more like a diamond instead of an actual cone
general 2020-12-13 05:46:26 Honestly I shouldn't even give a shit about people disliking this

I don't want a diamond, I want an actual cone
general 2020-12-13 05:46:36 So I make an actual cone
general 2020-12-13 05:46:40 Even if it looks rough
general 2020-12-13 05:48:28 Nose looks very long though

plane-crazy 2020-12-13 06:01:40 Pretty much the easiest part when I design a plane is to make one work
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 06:01:50 The harder part is building the plane and adjusting the aerodynamics

general 2020-12-13 06:24:35 do not the james
general 2020-12-13 06:24:54 Technically, the Boeing 747 is a jet
general 2020-12-13 06:25:09 I mean it's powered by turbofans, and is called a jumbo jet
general 2020-12-13 06:25:17 Turbofan engines are also called jet engines
general 2020-12-13 06:25:43 You can't convince me otherwise that airliners aren't jets
general 2020-12-13 06:25:52 They're still powered by jet engines
general 2020-12-13 06:26:11 Jet fighters are fighters that are powered by jets/turbofans
general 2020-12-13 06:26:16 So by that logic, turbofan airliners are jets too
general 2020-12-13 06:27:16 In that case your joke wasn't obvious
general 2020-12-13 06:27:55 Honestly, I thought you were being serious
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 06:28:35 Fabric has a lot of friction while ice and glass doesn't
general 2020-12-13 06:31:17 What comes after Boeing 797? Would it be 808
general 2020-12-13 06:32:08 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_367-80 wait they skipped all the other numbers
general 2020-12-13 06:32:17 They went from 3XX to 7XX
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:35:12 Where's the build, I wanna put in some input
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:42:01 Looking at the private jet, everything is wrong there.

Firstly, the size is too small to have any actual details, I suggest you upscale it so that you can add details, and speaking of size, that couldn't carry any passengers viably so that's also another reason to upscale it/make it larger.

If you're gonna make it larger, give it an actual nose. The wings should be more of a swept wing instead of a delta wing, it's gonna go supersonic anyways.

As for the body shape, I suggest you look up a bunch of private jets to see what they all have in common. I suggest looking at the Gulfstream family of jets, the Cessna Citation, Dassault Falcon. If you want something slightly larger like a regional jet, try the Mitsubishi SpaceJet, the Sukhoi Superjet or the Airbus A220/Bombardier C-Series
<@!342402058994974730>
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:44:05 Anyways that's all I could think up of for criticisms about that jet, and slayertazer, I recommend you do research about aircraft also so people don't gang up against you like this
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:46:39 In that case

- Use swept wings instead of delta wings. Delta wings only work on supersonic aircraft
- Place those horizontal tail fins on motor 2s, they're called elevators for a reason.
- Use a pyramid wedge for a nose instead of a cutter

But honestly, people still won't like it. It just makes it *slightly less* worse. If you want upvotes you gotta make a new plane
creations-chat 2020-12-13 06:55:47 <@!342402058994974730> For the motor 2s, well, go figure it out since I can't really take a good look. The motors 2s though moves the wings so they'll act like control surfaces. Custom control surfaces are better both in appaerance and performance

Also, here's some jets I recommend you to research. They're called very light jets
- Honda HA-420 HondaJet
- Cessna Citation M2 or Citation Mustang
- Embraer Phenom 500

Here's an example of one https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/HondaJet_Ryabtsev.jpg
(Anyways, gonna be a bit busy so go ask someone else for advice)
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 06:58:11 This man literally making a car platform
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 06:59:01 As for the brakes, sure why not
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 06:59:39 Maybe some friction to give some finer control?
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 07:00:31 What about gears?
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 07:01:48 Yes, engines are gradual, not binary
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 07:06:31 You should

general 2020-12-13 09:01:54 So I could consider mine a quad-decker if including the cargo deck
general 2020-12-13 09:02:36 who
general 2020-12-13 09:08:03 <@!467765396108476426> wait is vixxage beaned
general 2020-12-13 09:08:36 Was Vixxage banned?

plane-crazy 2020-12-13 09:29:40 That's my honest opinion, it's barely even an aircraft

plane-crazy 2020-12-13 10:05:03 More progress

general 2020-12-13 10:09:37 <@!448505589983739914> I tired to ragdoll onto your ragdolled body, I spasmed and glitched out of the sky
general 2020-12-13 10:10:05 <@!499705220637392897> I see you're using custom exhaust, try using upper half wedge 1x2
general 2020-12-13 10:10:21 Instead of bottom half wedge 1x2
general 2020-12-13 10:13:53 https://streamable.com/ujk13w hmm yes
general 2020-12-13 10:14:07 watch me get flung near the coastline

general 2020-12-13 10:17:27 <@!499705220637392897> I mean the KAI T-50 did have some help from overseas
general 2020-12-13 10:17:35 Which is why it kinda resembles the F-16
general 2020-12-13 10:18:04 "The T-50 program was originally intended to develop an indigenous trainer aircraft capable of supersonic flight, to train and prepare pilots for the KF-16 and F-15K"
general 2020-12-13 10:18:07 That's why
general 2020-12-13 10:18:19 Because it was meant to train pilots for the F-16 and F-15
general 2020-12-13 10:19:41 T-50 article says we have FA-50s
general 2020-12-13 10:19:46 So basically, we have budget F-16s
general 2020-12-13 10:20:20 "Since the retirement of the Northrop F-5s in September 2005 without a planned replacement"
wait what
general 2020-12-13 10:20:32 Didn't know we actually had Northrop F-5s in the past
general 2020-12-13 10:21:21 We used to have Vought F-8 Crusaders and F-86 Sabres, but retired
general 2020-12-13 10:23:42 Current ones we have that are jet aircraft are
- SIAI-Marchetti S.211
- Fokker F28
- Gulfstream G280
- KAI FA-50

And a bunch of turboprop aircraft
general 2020-12-13 10:23:52 Not piston engine, but turboprop
general 2020-12-13 10:24:08 Lots of propeller based though
general 2020-12-13 10:24:32 I could barely even understand that
general 2020-12-13 10:24:36 I'm not good with suspensions
general 2020-12-13 10:25:48 <@456226577798135808> Which is why the only thing I understand well enough are aircraft

general 2020-12-13 11:11:14 Negative camber
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 11:12:11 I see an A-10 Warthog, and so far, stuff has actually been done right
general 2020-12-13 11:12:32 What if 90 degree camber
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 11:13:34 Well, puri never said what kind of submission
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 11:13:46 Did he meant submission as in the total amount of images
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 11:13:53 Or submissions as in the builds themselves?
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 11:14:04 Also that's one low-res image I could barely even read it
general 2020-12-13 11:15:28 It's up to your personal preferences, personally I do pyramids since they're more conical in shape

general 2020-12-13 11:24:31 That nose kinda reminds me of the SR-71/Archangel recon jets
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 11:24:53 What is that
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 11:25:28 Well I'm not a spacecraft designer so guess wait for someone else
general 2020-12-13 11:25:54 That's why they're caled bae systems
general 2020-12-13 11:26:14 "It is being developed by a consortium known as "Team Tempest",[8] consisting of the UK Ministry of Defence, BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Leonardo S.p.A. and MBDA,"
general 2020-12-13 11:26:27 So Europe's coming up with two joint 5th generation aircraft
general 2020-12-13 11:27:25 Oh right 6th
general 2020-12-13 11:27:52 I'd bet there's already a game called War Simulator

general 2020-12-13 11:29:47 Because VIP costs 100 bobux

general 2020-12-13 11:32:19 where
general 2020-12-13 11:32:30 i see
general 2020-12-13 11:32:30 oh yes
general 2020-12-13 11:50:26 i know bigger
general 2020-12-13 11:52:49 VIP 1 barely has anyone

haha projectile go stabby stab
general 2020-12-13 11:54:31 Anyways, I'll be building again on VIP1
general 2020-12-13 14:09:39 Forward swept-ish
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:14:37 Discord not loading images again
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:15:11 What happened here
general 2020-12-13 23:07:06 oh hey a pusher propeller aircraft
general 2020-12-13 23:07:30 but yes technically it can be considered a bullpup plane
general 2020-12-13 23:08:22 I'm thinking of how  I'll build the tail of an airliner
general 2020-12-13 23:08:45 yes very helpful
general 2020-12-13 23:08:57 I'll just do what I did on the nose
general 2020-12-13 23:09:29 VIP 1, but it's just a quick look to plan stuff out
general 2020-12-13 23:09:46 This is what I'm working with
general 2020-12-13 23:10:11 Width is around 11 blocks
general 2020-12-13 23:10:17 For height, well I forgot, let me measure it up
general 2020-12-13 23:10:49 8 + 7 + 0.5 for height
general 2020-12-13 23:11:03 Height is around 15.5 blocks
general 2020-12-13 23:11:16 So a height of 15.5 blocks and a width of 11 blocks
general 2020-12-13 23:12:06 I'll just do the same magic I did onto my aircraft's nose to do the tail
general 2020-12-14 00:30:53 I see Prototrode

general 2020-12-14 00:58:46 t a i l
general 2020-12-14 00:58:54 I think I could fit that in three folds
general 2020-12-14 01:01:25 No I meant the whole plane
general 2020-12-14 01:01:49 Though why do I have a feeling this is gonna end up slightly stubby
general 2020-12-14 01:01:59 But the wings need folding based on previous experience
general 2020-12-14 01:02:09 That includes the elevator
general 2020-12-14 01:03:12 Because yes
general 2020-12-14 01:03:26 If if I can, then I can
general 2020-12-14 01:03:30 3 passenger decks
general 2020-12-14 01:03:57 And yes I was right tail was gonna get stubby
general 2020-12-14 01:04:03 Gonna extend the tail further
general 2020-12-14 01:04:50 I live to be the server's plane idiot
general 2020-12-14 01:08:02 l o n g tail
general 2020-12-14 01:08:23 Dunno if it's too long
general 2020-12-14 01:13:23 I should follow the curve 1x4 wedges make
general 2020-12-14 01:14:22 yes i see it

general 2020-12-14 04:02:00 Question? How bad is Ryanair
general 2020-12-14 04:02:20 I know what livery to do
general 2020-12-14 04:02:57 When I'm done with this I'll give it a Ryanair livery
general 2020-12-14 04:03:15 Because Ryanair = bad
general 2020-12-14 04:03:24 And cramming tons of passengers isn't the best idea
general 2020-12-14 04:04:35 <@!652857275769421825> hello, on a scale of 1-10, how cursed is a Ryanair triple decker + cargo plane?
general 2020-12-14 04:04:47 Just something I made up
general 2020-12-14 04:05:07 Conclusion: Give my triple decker a Ryanair livery
general 2020-12-14 04:05:25 It's cursed yet not shitposty
general 2020-12-14 04:05:42 So I might have sliver of at least having a chance at HoF
general 2020-12-14 04:05:55 Just a sliver
general 2020-12-14 04:06:00 Not a big chance
general 2020-12-14 04:06:29 Not exactly https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/787892774044827699
general 2020-12-14 04:07:34 It's in the works
general 2020-12-14 04:07:50 Big plane also needs aerofoils
general 2020-12-14 04:08:34 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airfoil Basically, I'll give wings some thiccness
general 2020-12-14 04:08:43 Instead of being 0.1 block thick default wing
general 2020-12-14 04:08:58 Large aircraft needs thicc wings
general 2020-12-14 04:09:10 yes
general 2020-12-14 04:09:53 https://img.gta5-mods.com/q95/images/ryanair-livery-for-boeing-737/865c7b-20161026143507_1.jpg Doesn't look *too* hard
general 2020-12-14 04:10:31 Zoom in
general 2020-12-14 04:10:55 Honestly I just want an excuse to motivate myself to build this thing
general 2020-12-14 04:11:05 Like I really want ***b i g*** plane
general 2020-12-14 04:11:14 I want **s i z e**
general 2020-12-14 04:11:25 I already invested time
general 2020-12-14 04:11:32 Now I need to big
general 2020-12-14 04:12:28 Ah screw it I might as well aim that high
general 2020-12-14 04:12:48 Well, the Ryanair livery is where I'll be most concerned
general 2020-12-14 04:13:01 As for detail and accuracy, I mean it's just a plane I built on my own
general 2020-12-14 04:15:07 If I'm actually aiming for a realistic goal, an upgrade to my designer rank would be it
general 2020-12-14 04:15:18 Designer IV not enough
general 2020-12-14 04:17:00 I mean it would be nice to have Aero Engineer X, or whatever's beyond expert
general 2020-12-14 04:17:30 But that's far from happening unless I somehow got a miracle
general 2020-12-14 04:17:48 I mean a lot of people have done airliners
general 2020-12-14 04:17:56 What makes mine even special
general 2020-12-14 04:18:25 I just do what I'm familiar with
general 2020-12-14 04:18:35 And I'm more familiar with 🅱️lanes
general 2020-12-14 04:23:35 I wonder if Ryanair would actually purchase something like an Airbus A380
general 2020-12-14 04:27:15 I'm looking at the tail of my aircraft and it reminds me of fish
general 2020-12-14 04:28:00 The more I look at it the more I think it also looks like a radiator
general 2020-12-14 04:28:09 Or part of a giant SPAS-12 https://i.redd.it/sycu8aj9jty11.jpg
general 2020-12-14 04:35:12 Actually, are there any airliners worse than Ryanair?
general 2020-12-14 04:35:42 So it's either AA or Ryanair
general 2020-12-14 04:36:18 It's for the purposes of cursed aircraft
general 2020-12-14 04:38:13 I gotta make a poll
general 2020-12-14 04:38:37 Give me more names
general 2020-12-14 04:38:41 Then I'll make a poll
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 04:52:07 What is the *worst* airline
🍎 Ryanair
🍌 American Airlines
🍰 S🅱️irit Air
general 2020-12-14 04:54:58 Is it worth it to try and build a Delta Dart?

plane-crazy 2020-12-14 05:14:05 I see plane, I see I don't like it
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 05:23:28 - The nose doesn't exist, redesign the cockpit in general
- Those don't look like any wings aircraft would actually use. I'm assuming that's an airliner, so use swept wings
- The tail is just a block, fix it. Also the elevators look weird
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 05:23:46 And the lack of a side view means we don't get a good view
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 05:24:00 And yes follow their advice, like using custom control surfaces (basically wing panels on a motor 2)

plane-crazy 2020-12-14 05:25:52 However if it's not a military aircraft, don't place the wings that high. Place it lower and make it dihedral as opposed to using the high mounted, anhedral wings of military aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 05:26:51 I could imagine it being similar to why the A-10 has it's engines placed high, repairability while avoiding damage from stuff like dust
general 2020-12-14 05:30:58 Apparently sugar can be used as fuel
general 2020-12-14 05:31:05 I shall call it the UwU/OwO fuel
general 2020-12-14 05:31:23 But it's sugar
general 2020-12-14 05:31:27 And it's cursed
general 2020-12-14 05:31:45 Congrats you're going to space
general 2020-12-14 05:31:52 When you take a dump on a stove
general 2020-12-14 05:33:45 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p-XWqYHez4 but yes this guy used sugar as fuel, or at least up until the parts I watched
general 2020-12-14 05:34:02 He does 3D printed projects
general 2020-12-14 05:34:49 I mean poop produces methane doesn't it?
general 2020-12-14 05:36:10 Gotta age the poop like cheese though to get the most methane
general 2020-12-14 05:37:47 I mean we can

general 2020-12-14 06:15:07 I was under the assumption said AI plane is 6th gen
general 2020-12-14 06:15:52 AI should still have human assistance
general 2020-12-14 06:16:23 what update
general 2020-12-14 06:18:16 Dec 16th, literally last day of exams
general 2020-12-14 06:18:20 Time to YouTube the locations
general 2020-12-14 06:18:29 because laziness
general 2020-12-14 06:19:34 Which is?
general 2020-12-14 06:21:26 ah yes

the meme system
general 2020-12-14 06:21:53 I have the Asian system
general 2020-12-14 06:22:47 Speaking of Asians
general 2020-12-14 06:23:01 This part of Asia I live in was once territory of Spaniards and Americans
general 2020-12-14 06:23:35 so they give us the religions and capitalisms
general 2020-12-14 06:23:52 Pull out the Yakovlev
general 2020-12-14 06:25:14 Ah yes
general 2020-12-14 06:25:17 The Windows ME planes
general 2020-12-14 06:27:25 Call me Bill Gates for meeting yours
general 2020-12-14 06:29:46 If I saw yours then aliens would've been jealous
general 2020-12-14 06:31:03 yes but it's easy to think up of the spot because still rich
general 2020-12-14 06:31:30 and apparently taught in schools, that he is very rich
general 2020-12-14 06:34:12 he isn't, I mean he ain't the CEO anymore nor is Microsoft the only big tech company
general 2020-12-14 06:35:42 FIFA Copy, paste and rename
general 2020-12-14 06:39:27 iplier
general 2020-12-14 06:40:44 What is that
general 2020-12-14 06:41:51 Cessna, what about Cessna with slats
general 2020-12-14 06:42:12 Those leading edge flaps that aid with low speed maneuverability
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 06:44:36 How, did you anchor it?
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 06:48:01 I use springs to delay motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 06:48:18 While it does leave a trail of springs behind and in your aircraft, it makes it usable in non-PvP
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 06:50:53 <@!499705220637392897> I just realized why don't you try applying for a rank
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 06:52:22 You just do them, mess around with wedges until you get something satisfactory
general 2020-12-14 06:54:23 "live"
*decides to premiere it*
general 2020-12-14 06:54:33 I remember the chat, it was an idiotic experience
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 06:54:54 Because well you have the planes
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 06:55:03 Why not try applying one of them to get a rank
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 06:55:24 As long as you have the block count, should be good to request for rank
general 2020-12-14 06:55:46 I'll be gone
Head On Me
general 2020-12-14 06:57:46 Do you have a 4-chan and Twitter gun?

general 2020-12-14 07:00:04 <@!582834773773254656> I can't think up of anything for the letter-number thing
general 2020-12-14 07:00:08 PR sounds like public relations
general 2020-12-14 07:00:22 I had the idea of Propeller/Prototype-Racer
general 2020-12-14 07:00:25 But yes the PR thing
general 2020-12-14 07:00:51 I just made it up on the spot
general 2020-12-14 07:00:54 I'm not the creative type
general 2020-12-14 07:04:24 If I made an interceptor one day, I'll know what to name it
general 2020-12-14 07:05:01 Peregrine Falcon
general 2020-12-14 07:05:20 "The peregrine falcon is best known for its diving speed during flight—which can reach more than 300 km (186 miles) per hour—making it not only the world's fastest bird but also the world's fastest animal."
general 2020-12-14 07:05:33 300 km/h is pretty fast for a literal bird
general 2020-12-14 07:26:14 The what now?
general 2020-12-14 07:26:25 Also I'm writing the thing
general 2020-12-14 07:26:41 The how to aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 08:00:20 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mN5dYGV6NeNg57Rj_9N1cBAjeWnd1Q6hb-YP53hS2AU/edit?usp=sharing Well I wrote it
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 08:00:22 Because why not
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 08:00:25 I have nothing else to do
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 08:00:45 I should've wrote this after exams but screw it
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 08:03:07 I should really improve this once exams are done
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 08:03:11 Because it kinda looks like crap
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 08:03:41 And so that I don't have to repeat saying what is already basic stuff
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 08:03:51 When I see poob build in creations
general 2020-12-15 00:58:31 Is Rick getting prepared for the winter update?
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:58:40 I think I'll go try out a penta-jet setup
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:03:20 Submarines are water planes
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:03:25 Except no wings, and it's propeller driven
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:04:10 wait isn't the point of submarines to sink so you can hide from enemy radar?
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:06:42 Both are equally terrifying

You never said they could move anyways
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:07:17 Yes, but they technically said "gun with wings"
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:07:20 But not with engine
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:07:24 Speaking of engines
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:07:43 I gotta make a better exhaust nozzle
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:12:20 they are
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:12:26 unobtainable
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:13:08 Besides kinda hard to objectively judge someone for those roles
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:16:06 I just know how to cram stuff with motor locking
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:16:11 And delay it with springs
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 01:22:31 Shredder interceptor
general 2020-12-15 01:23:09 Impact speed 

Basically the amount of speed it takes to make TNT go boom
general 2020-12-15 01:23:37 This is Plane Crazy, not First Person Shooter Crazy
general 2020-12-15 01:25:10 Noticed he's unranked

<@!347182144873037824> eat veggies with meat to balance flavors
general 2020-12-15 04:51:41 With this guy around <#497142796961054721> feels like Reddit again
general 2020-12-15 04:53:25 No that's the Forza server
general 2020-12-15 04:55:34 "form of government in which one person or a small group possesses absolute power without effective constitutional limitations."

Doesn't feel abused here though
general 2020-12-15 04:56:16 Reminds me of a Linux server that bans you for asking about Linux Mint
general 2020-12-15 04:56:45 Technically, while you are right, it doesn't feel like moderation powers are abused here
general 2020-12-15 04:57:59 I mean I wasn't disagreeing, but I'm not saying this server is bad also
general 2020-12-15 05:02:06 Honestly Discord mods shouldn't be democratic

Y'all aren't adults with jobs and work and stuff to do
general 2020-12-15 05:05:55 <@!435946988559925248> What's in the shithole?
general 2020-12-15 05:06:19 So normal dump
the-dump 2020-12-15 05:06:40 I don't know this

general 2020-12-15 05:20:01 hmmyes gas stove
general 2020-12-15 05:20:07 I'm 16 yet I don't cook
general 2020-12-15 05:20:10 pathetic of me
general 2020-12-15 05:20:51 <@!265819387498332160> Because I wasn't given any actual cooking, just the books
general 2020-12-15 05:21:01 Blame my school and my parents
general 2020-12-15 05:21:13 My school is way too cheap
general 2020-12-15 05:21:21 And my parents prefer doing the cooking themselves
general 2020-12-15 05:22:56 *push and twist*
***repeated clicking***
**f i r e**
general 2020-12-15 05:23:35 About half I'd say isn't useful

Like an N95 mask
general 2020-12-15 06:01:31 Then Roblox is not optimized
general 2020-12-15 06:01:49 Odd how the game that's coded in Java performs better than Roblox
general 2020-12-15 06:02:08 Bedrock isn't OG, plus I want mods and redstone and stuff
general 2020-12-15 06:02:20 Give me the OG mechanics and mods and I'll go to Bedrock
general 2020-12-15 06:02:24 Like old redstone mechanics
general 2020-12-15 06:02:46 We have observers
general 2020-12-15 06:03:08 But Bedrock is Edookasyonal Edision
general 2020-12-15 06:04:10 And mods
general 2020-12-15 06:04:14 And mapmaking
general 2020-12-15 06:04:38 Java is good for technical builds
general 2020-12-15 06:04:44 And the OGs
general 2020-12-15 06:05:19 But they're kinda limited from my previous experience
general 2020-12-15 06:06:36 Vegan borger

general 2020-12-15 07:11:37 Obc Dating Simulator
general 2020-12-15 07:12:58 Should I @ obc and tell him you have a crush on them?
general 2020-12-15 07:13:34 shadedwood deleted an image
general 2020-12-15 07:14:00 But big chungus is obc
general 2020-12-15 07:14:50 shadedwood wants to date obc
general 2020-12-15 07:17:09 I usually just adjust wings and use the bare mimimum amount of ballasts to achieve level flight
general 2020-12-15 07:17:59 o h
general 2020-12-15 07:18:23 <@!392334096560554001> wait Cessna(s) point up when on the ground?
general 2020-12-15 07:21:05 So always go for a hybrid of 3D models, blueprints and real life images
general 2020-12-15 07:22:40 Is that an F-104?
general 2020-12-15 07:23:13 I didn't even notice it had a T-tail
general 2020-12-15 07:23:21 All I know is long and slender like a dart and has trapezoidal wings
general 2020-12-15 07:35:21 wait

general 2020-12-15 07:35:36 here
general 2020-12-15 07:41:01 what is that
general 2020-12-15 07:41:07 Looks like a satellite and a rocket combined
general 2020-12-15 07:43:05 Yes but what is that image
general 2020-12-15 07:43:09 What's it about
general 2020-12-15 07:43:21 What is the Silbervogel
general 2020-12-15 07:44:03 I was right about silber being silver
general 2020-12-15 07:44:13 But didn't knew vogel is bird
general 2020-12-15 07:44:28 All I had to rely on was "silber kinda sounds like silver"
general 2020-12-15 07:45:10 So apparently it's a liquid rocket propelled sub-orbital bomber
general 2020-12-15 07:45:33 Built by The 3rd Reich/No-no Germany
general 2020-12-15 07:49:03 Mine's random geeky stuff, animals, kekeflipnote (recently) and other stuff
general 2020-12-15 07:53:32 Is that why Discord and YouTube was being buggy yesterday?
general 2020-12-15 07:53:40 Undetale Genocide Route

general 2020-12-15 08:00:08 May I ask why is there another furry here
general 2020-12-15 08:01:28 i am referring to gingerbread
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 08:01:56 Looking at various blueprints of the F-16, the only inconsistency so far seems to be the nose
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 08:02:09 Can't tell whether it's supposed to be flat or pointing down
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 08:02:19 And I see it's elevators are anhedral
general 2020-12-15 08:02:54 he caught the furry virus?

general 2020-12-15 13:41:25 Can't really buy a Sukhoi if you're the USA
general 2020-12-15 13:42:14 https://www.military-today.com/aircraft/su_37.jpg Is this easy?

general 2020-12-16 05:11:28 that's actually pretty decent considering how limited that is
general 2020-12-16 05:12:20 Vehicle Simulator should be that low

It's a grindfest to get any decent vehicles
general 2020-12-16 05:13:38 <@!727028164223696966> My experience on Forza made me get used to actually having something to buy
general 2020-12-16 05:14:02 Without getting tired of grinding
general 2020-12-16 05:14:13 Also, driving physics still feels arcade like
general 2020-12-16 05:14:58 Here's a game I often play, The Crusher

I mean it's not bad, more of a quick time killer for me
general 2020-12-16 05:15:20 Like an arcade game
general 2020-12-16 05:15:31 I can compare The Crusher to an arcade game
general 2020-12-16 05:15:37 A quick time killer to relieve boredom
general 2020-12-16 05:15:54 Though it doesn't stop you from dedicating yourself to it
general 2020-12-16 05:16:43 ~~seriously how do people not get bored of getting world records in arcade games~~

general 2020-12-16 06:20:26 Still doesn't change that both the X-32 and the F-35 are kinda fat
general 2020-12-16 06:21:18 F-18 = F-16 brother
general 2020-12-16 06:21:26 I mean they both come from the same program

general 2020-12-16 07:07:17 Meanwhile on Twitter I just don't give a crap and much thought anymore
general 2020-12-16 07:08:28 While the intentions aren't bad, I'm honestly tired of hearing the same problem
general 2020-12-16 07:09:40 All I want rn is some peace
general 2020-12-16 07:10:19 ute
general 2020-12-16 07:10:59 I tried to search up "gingerbread furry" just to search up that image

I got something else instead https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9f/1a/fd/9f1afd1c0b293dbd49f6ff4cae5741d8.png
general 2020-12-16 07:11:52 I forgot reverse image search exists
general 2020-12-16 07:12:32 Found where the image and sona is from
general 2020-12-16 07:12:48 On Twitter, @fiddleafox
general 2020-12-16 07:13:05 Now my curiosity has been solved
general 2020-12-16 07:13:15 Also, who's pyrocynical
general 2020-12-16 07:13:19 Like I actually don't know them
general 2020-12-16 07:16:19 That accurately represents Twitter
general 2020-12-16 07:20:29 15 year old being on an 18+ server
Sometimes I don't get people
general 2020-12-16 07:20:44 On the other hand, Twitter's pretty much the de facto place for public horniness

general 2020-12-16 07:26:27 swift key? more like fat key
general 2020-12-16 07:30:31 ah ok understandable
general 2020-12-16 07:30:46 that man in the picture
general 2020-12-16 07:33:13 why foxgirl tho
general 2020-12-16 07:33:45 I was about to say I couldn't believe it
general 2020-12-16 07:33:50 Up until I realized that's in 2018
general 2020-12-16 07:33:54 That vip builds like that
general 2020-12-16 07:34:36 My first large build is literally a brick with wings and a "nose"
general 2020-12-16 07:34:43 Literally a dorito
general 2020-12-16 07:40:49 old plane crazy looks more shadowy
general 2020-12-16 07:41:02 it's like if you added heavy drop shadow onto text
general 2020-12-16 07:55:36 ower sever
general 2020-12-16 07:58:36 <@!467765396108476426> Fun Fact: There are games that cost ten cents, at least on the Switch

Gamer Thailand's loyal subscribers are like if a paid game decided to do a 100% discount just because it's so bad people actively avoid buying it
general 2020-12-16 07:59:24 His subscribers are the bottom barel of discount games
general 2020-12-16 07:59:31 Actually no not bottom barrel
general 2020-12-16 07:59:57 His subscribers are the basement barrel of discount games
general 2020-12-16 08:00:01 So bad it goes underground
general 2020-12-16 08:05:55 and to thailand also
general 2020-12-16 08:06:14 Basically, no piece of garbage anyone should endure
general 2020-12-16 08:06:38 I'm surprised he could barely even spell at that age
general 2020-12-16 08:06:49 Especially for someone who's exposed to the internet 24/7
general 2020-12-16 08:07:15 He cannot the spellings
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 08:08:37 When it's teaching you how something works, not how to build something, it's fine
general 2020-12-16 08:09:17 Looks like a modern day Jaguar XJ220
general 2020-12-16 08:09:27 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_XJ220
general 2020-12-16 08:09:55 Go figure why I think it looks like a modern day XJ220
general 2020-12-16 08:10:49 <@!409676438682206218> Imagine being Koenigsegg

Now imagine submitting something for Gran Turismo
general 2020-12-16 08:10:54 And solely for Gran Turismo
general 2020-12-16 08:11:31 K
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 08:11:52 Didn't really used tutorials for specific builds
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 08:11:58 Mostly just for in-game mechanics
general 2020-12-16 08:12:59 you ruined the chain
general 2020-12-16 08:13:14 now i go rest
general 2020-12-16 08:13:21 The chain smh
general 2020-12-16 08:13:45 https://tenor.com/view/chain-gif-18490487
general 2020-12-16 08:13:59 the chain smh
general 2020-12-16 08:14:47 dont break the chain pls
general 2020-12-16 08:14:59 dont break the chain pls
general 2020-12-16 09:55:06 An image is an image
general 2020-12-16 09:56:04 I mean it doesn't matter format it is, it's not like you're gonna get the original data without black bars
general 2020-12-16 09:57:20 Besides if censoring stuff was a matter of adding overlays I would imagine people could make the image equivalent of zip bombs
general 2020-12-16 09:58:09 War Thunder

general 2020-12-16 22:57:06 The Third Reich is always not allowed
general 2020-12-16 22:57:27 Wait it's in game
general 2020-12-16 22:57:38 Also I'm not a mod
general 2020-12-16 22:58:13 That's outside of the PCC's responsibility
general 2020-12-16 23:02:26 How important is single core performance
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 23:04:38 Considering you people are talking about hardware
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 23:04:53 How important is looking up for single core performance
general 2020-12-16 23:05:28 I think I'll go onto Plane Crazy
general 2020-12-16 23:05:37 And be cheap and watch a video
general 2020-12-16 23:05:40 Because I'm lazy
general 2020-12-16 23:06:02 Chonkerbeast
general 2020-12-16 23:06:46 They can 

Why do you think websites ask for your birthday
general 2020-12-16 23:07:23 I see a lack of logic here 

Kinda sus
general 2020-12-16 23:08:28 Probably, from how they spell to their own logic
general 2020-12-16 23:09:20 Bonkl Bankl, Byekl
general 2020-12-16 23:10:37 Give him a time limit
general 2020-12-16 23:10:50 Oh wait nvm
general 2020-12-16 23:11:12 He's illegal
general 2020-12-16 23:11:49 What did he say
general 2020-12-16 23:12:45 The R word is a mental health thing
general 2020-12-16 23:13:23 Ban
general 2020-12-16 23:13:28 That was quick
general 2020-12-16 23:14:12 Ban him until he's 13
general 2020-12-16 23:14:25 **A new world record**
general 2020-12-16 23:15:15 <@547919053742800907> Tell him your age or you're gonna be banned for a year
general 2020-12-16 23:15:38 Yeah BRICS.

Britain 
Russia 
India 
China
South Africa
general 2020-12-16 23:16:03 Funni typo
general 2020-12-16 23:16:16 Ban him for a year
general 2020-12-16 23:16:38 Yes
general 2020-12-16 23:17:37 I'm glad I wasn't listening to his sorry ass
general 2020-12-16 23:19:23 Don't tell me you're too shy to see 
Never gonna give you up
general 2020-12-16 23:19:46 I'll go play some PC now, this kid's beyond help
general 2020-12-16 23:20:13 Pour it into a female shaped container and maybe it will
general 2020-12-16 23:20:48 Ask the Internet and their weird fantasies
general 2020-12-16 23:21:00 Cursed
general 2020-12-16 23:50:19 I think I'll go use fireworks more often
general 2020-12-16 23:51:00 cookie
general 2020-12-16 23:55:07 Snow pipes are apparently if smoke pipes actually made smoke
general 2020-12-16 23:59:47 I have a present
general 2020-12-17 00:23:13 I wonder if this game can be played without a VR headset
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 00:25:58 smooth and curved
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 00:27:54 The purpose of a tail rotor is to counteract the tendency of a helicopter to spin
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 00:28:36 why is there a shredder
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 00:37:16 Good luck with locked motors
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 00:37:23 And a bit of motor angling
general 2020-12-17 00:40:13 Give me the distinct features of an advanced 4.5 generation fighter jet
general 2020-12-17 00:41:34 Kinda getting bored of 5th gen for now
general 2020-12-17 00:41:54 Fireworks is near the dock and the snow blaster is in the lab
general 2020-12-17 00:43:03 The skis are kinda all over the place, but you can find them in a hole underwater, near the lava lake and nearby a sign that's just nearby the spawn area
general 2020-12-17 00:43:10 Snow pipe, I forgot
general 2020-12-17 00:43:28 Probably near the outside of the base <@!424656494949040129> for the snow pipe
general 2020-12-17 00:45:04 You're in the lab, yes? Well see that pipe under the floor? Follow it
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 00:45:35 modern art building
general 2020-12-17 00:46:09 Oh, I use trails
general 2020-12-17 00:46:28 Snow pipe kinda looks like a more thicc and smooth smoke
general 2020-12-17 00:46:38 Yes, now follow to where it leads
general 2020-12-17 00:46:44 To the door it's going to
general 2020-12-17 00:47:06 I mean you literally just place the trails to where the exhaust is
general 2020-12-17 00:47:24 Yes it is
general 2020-12-17 00:47:33 Now you just gotta press a red button on the control panel
general 2020-12-17 00:47:51 Aight, get inside once it stops spewing snow
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 00:48:30 I'd say a light fighter, like the Saab Gripen or the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon
general 2020-12-17 00:49:02 It kinda does

But I did this instead
general 2020-12-17 00:49:11 Your gift is supercar exhaust
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 00:50:18 <@456226577798135808> I suggest you use it's canards either for better pitch control or to straighten it's flight
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 00:50:36 no it's chonk, like Boeing X-32
general 2020-12-17 00:51:34 e
general 2020-12-17 00:51:57 i used a snow pipe
general 2020-12-17 00:52:12 because can't gift exhaust if it doesn't smoke
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 00:54:07 <@456226577798135808> The variants of most aircraft are for the most part, just fitting in new features that won't be really visible externally or a single/two-seater variant
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 00:54:17 So the same should apply for the Gripen
general 2020-12-17 00:54:38 I misread that as ground beef
general 2020-12-17 02:17:14 If that feature gets added 

That means more lazy low-effort players
general 2020-12-17 02:19:11 Yes but copilot should not have access to some key binds (like W,A,S,D,Q,E)

plane-crazy 2020-12-17 04:16:09 Also found a hover drive that I could easily plop in
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 04:16:32 I dunno, but I just wanna try making a 4th generation fighter jet again
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 04:37:09 How do you not know how to get to the airport?
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 04:46:17 Hmm, snow pipe = cooking pot

general 2020-12-17 12:20:54 i do not know how to helicopter
general 2020-12-17 12:22:23 I'm still doing the swashplate

general 2020-12-17 12:24:02 I'm just watching a video because I have absolutely no experience with helicopters
general 2020-12-17 12:28:31 That's not a brainfuck
general 2020-12-17 12:28:58 I have a harder time understanding how swashplates work
general 2020-12-17 12:29:39 <@!461743274013753344> Go experiment around with locked motors

general 2020-12-18 01:32:28 Being an inteceptor

general 2020-12-18 07:12:26 Gonna add aerofoil to the weirdliner
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 07:13:08 too lazy to check this on my computer, just gonna view this on web browser
general 2020-12-18 07:17:58 I underestimated the spacing needed between parts of the fuselage
general 2020-12-18 07:18:13 ~~oh god help I gotta redo the fuselage and tail~~
general 2020-12-18 07:18:21 The tail is the most demotivating part

general 2020-12-18 07:22:35 You shipbuilder, how do you not give up when you have to redo a large part of a build like the hull
general 2020-12-18 07:23:37 Well, mine's just a simple spacing issue
general 2020-12-18 07:23:57 Because I lack the space for a decent aerofoil
general 2020-12-18 07:24:51 I forgot to consider the fact that the half blocks of my aerofoil are gonna weld with the fuselage
general 2020-12-18 07:25:35 I'll remake it later
general 2020-12-18 07:25:42 I'll just screw around and relax for now

general 2020-12-18 07:58:09 https://streamable.com/3ii6gp Roblox has sent me to be tested for the Brazilian council.
general 2020-12-18 08:05:40 remind me what game is that from again
general 2020-12-18 08:14:11 Winter wheels apparently are faster than default wheels
general 2020-12-18 08:14:23 Did a quick test with a drag race, it accelerated faster right off the bat
general 2020-12-18 08:14:36 It also goes 470
general 2020-12-18 08:15:08 still pretty fast for default wheels
general 2020-12-18 08:15:34 for default wheels

general 2020-12-18 12:04:52 Finally motivated to redo the fuselage, considering I also don't have to move the tail once I consider wing placement
general 2020-12-18 12:05:23 Why would I post an incomplete creation there?
general 2020-12-18 12:06:38 Here's why I'm redoing the fuselage, not enough space for the wing

general 2020-12-18 12:26:48 "The sausage is branded as a "Volkswagen Original Part" and has been given the part number 199 398 500 A. The product has been described as the most produced of any of Volkswagen's parts, some 6.81 million sausages being manufactured in 2018. In many recent years the company has produced more sausages than cars. A Volkswagen ketchup is also produced and sold to accompany the currywurst."
general 2020-12-18 12:26:51 Wait
general 2020-12-18 12:26:56 It's a Volkswagen part
general 2020-12-18 12:27:07 And it's also has Volkswagen branded ketchup
general 2020-12-18 12:27:17 They make more sausages than cars

general 2020-12-19 01:17:02 herotubes
general 2020-12-19 01:17:21 wait is that an actual thing
general 2020-12-19 01:18:06 yes I too would be in agony if my eyes became spiky
general 2020-12-19 01:18:31 But it's free
general 2020-12-19 01:20:09 There's a controls button, click on it
general 2020-12-19 01:20:14 Also
general 2020-12-19 01:20:18 It has no automatic gearing
general 2020-12-19 01:20:25 Just either semi-auto or manual
general 2020-12-19 01:20:59 What if Roblox actually had a simracer, or a game that's at least compareable to Forza
general 2020-12-19 01:21:13 Because Project Trackday is basically Forza without the tuning
general 2020-12-19 01:21:31 And I like Forza because of tuning
general 2020-12-19 01:21:46 Like let me screw around with the cars
general 2020-12-19 01:22:45 Wait, did you leave it set at neutral? Because you do realize you need to shift into 1st gear first to move right?
general 2020-12-19 01:23:27 I've played Assetto Corsa before, got bored faster than I did in Forza
general 2020-12-19 01:23:43 It's a simracer yes, but it doesn't let me screw around with the cars
general 2020-12-19 01:23:48 And I wanna screw around with cars
general 2020-12-19 01:24:15 Honestly, it's been a while since I've played that game
general 2020-12-19 01:25:01 ah yes fanboys
general 2020-12-19 01:25:41 yes that would be nice
general 2020-12-19 01:38:20 That's the most downvotes I've ever seen
general 2020-12-19 01:38:42 "anime sounds"
general 2020-12-19 01:38:55 What exactly do you mean
general 2020-12-19 01:39:21 Oh right I forgot that exists, I couldn't remember how much downvotes though
general 2020-12-19 01:39:28 Yikes

general 2020-12-19 01:42:06 why are you people this engaging
general 2020-12-19 01:42:27 I made mistake with fuselage and yet this is a bigger priority
general 2020-12-19 01:43:05 What if Roblox physics added intertia
general 2020-12-19 01:43:15 So we can do an actual Cobra manuever
general 2020-12-19 01:45:05 I want multiple keybinds
general 2020-12-19 01:45:25 Because more keybinds = better controls

general 2020-12-19 01:49:08 wall of warns
general 2020-12-19 01:49:54 Now I kinda wish we can mass delete a certain part of a build
general 2020-12-19 01:50:07 Because manually having to move an entire fuselage is tiring
general 2020-12-19 01:52:18 why does 180 degree folding only work with an odd gap in between the folds (that is, works with a 5, 3, etc. block gap but not something like 4)
general 2020-12-19 02:00:56 Is it because of stuff like how fat stores energy
general 2020-12-19 02:01:30 Then eat big
general 2020-12-19 02:01:34 But not a lot of junk
general 2020-12-19 02:02:00 I wonder how filling rice is
general 2020-12-19 02:03:08 yes eat fried rice with some meat and other good stuff
general 2020-12-19 02:04:33 I don't even watch anime
general 2020-12-19 02:04:53 Like I'm just "it exists, but I don't even know much nor watch it"
general 2020-12-19 02:05:54 weeb = Weally eento Eastern 🅱️ulture
I can't make an acronym out of that
general 2020-12-19 02:16:48 Are they?
general 2020-12-19 02:17:11 I thought they said at one time they just take commissions in drawing furries because "anthropomorphic animal funni"
general 2020-12-19 02:17:41 why yes we have established that
general 2020-12-19 02:17:45 I.E, me

general 2020-12-19 02:35:54 <@555601119473041409> help why do I see a mustache when I look at your pfp
general 2020-12-19 02:36:37 It's just cropped so perfectly it has that mustache curve
general 2020-12-19 02:37:06 Should we ping a mod
general 2020-12-19 02:37:12 Before he gets out of hand
general 2020-12-19 02:37:22 Yag is not the best
general 2020-12-19 02:37:31 Yak is, as in Yakovlev
general 2020-12-19 02:38:38 If you pressed both, don't you think it would cancel out each other?
general 2020-12-19 02:38:55 Hmm yes cynical poop
general 2020-12-19 02:39:38 Magnets can be used to weld blocks, right?
general 2020-12-19 02:41:29 What if Tucker '48

I need it for rotary cannon purposes
general 2020-12-19 02:47:27 The one you submitted on contest
general 2020-12-19 02:47:44 That black part that I could use for a rotary cannon

general 2020-12-19 02:50:38 I forgot about motor locking
general 2020-12-19 02:51:20 Yes now I can make guns that go fart
general 2020-12-19 02:51:39 If I make them spin though
general 2020-12-19 02:51:54 I am clearly stoopid
general 2020-12-19 02:52:44 Well hope you stay that way

plane-crazy 2020-12-19 02:54:05 <@764906252202410005> Speaking of bees, honey is just bee spit
general 2020-12-19 02:56:06 If honey is just bee vomit, then does that mean we're addicted to bee vomit
general 2020-12-19 04:21:55 I just realized how exactly am I gonna fold thicc wings

general 2020-12-19 05:42:37 The minimum score of Aero Engineer V changed

plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:48:02 Well, TNT has the most HP so guess you gotta use them anyways. If you need to hide the TNT you can do this
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:48:25 Essentially, you motor lock wing panels so it becomes the "skin" while the TNT becomes the actual armor of the tank
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:49:36 That's assuming there's some areas where the "Explosive" label is seen
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:49:54 Otherwise you don't need to do this to begin with, just use the TNT as is since it can be colored (unless you're doing some sort of camo)

plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:55:39 If it means copying from other plots you can forget about it
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:56:24 That's not gonna pass considering there's a bunch of stuff that's operated from space
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:57:41 Still doesn't sound like a good idea. Rocket builders aren't gonna be happy to find out their motors don't work in space
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:57:50 Then there's spaceship builders
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:58:10 And don't forget about high altitude aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:59:09 Interceptors for example, operate at high altitudes. So do bombers
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 05:59:40 If weapons didn't work at high altitude, then people would build missiles
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:00:33 <@456226577798135808> Honestly it's not gonna bring balance, you're just gonna make it easier for missiles (like ICBMs) to not get hit
general 2020-12-19 06:02:11 Is it a good or bad idea for weapons to not work at certain altitudes
I had a discussion with someone in <#384021699466756107>
general 2020-12-19 06:03:12 That makes more sense, though I wonder how that'll effect rockets
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:04:00 So basically, make aircraft not abuse cannons
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:04:08 Even though they basically use glorified cannnons
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:04:23 It's even in the name, autocannons and rotary cannons
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:05:05 Like I don't get the point of this, people already abuse the game with conveyor drives, hover drives, etc.
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:05:41 Motor locking is also a potential feature for abuse yet people aren't complaining
general 2020-12-19 06:06:44 so wait how do we go to space now
general 2020-12-19 06:08:12 Imagine if someone actually pings madattak
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:09:16 Besides it's a thing used in actual aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:10:55 With motor locking, well here's the thing

When a motor is locked, it pulls any blocks attached to it 0.5 studs. This can be used in creative ways especially with such as with angling of parts (though it requires you delay the locking)
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:11:35 I did suggest adding an autocannon to the game
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:12:18 Okay, perhaps just a regular cannon, an in-between missiles and guns
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:12:32 🤮
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:12:58 I'd slap them onto my planes
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:13:16 Though there's one thing I want them to make
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:13:27 They must make ***brrrt*** sounds
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:13:44 Well, tbh the guns in this game kinda default tbh
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:14:13 Honestly the guns could use a change
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:14:54 Let's just agree to change the models of the guns and give them a sound
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:15:02 And rename them to autocannons

general 2020-12-19 07:32:02 When there's a Thunderbolt III, I wonder what it would be built around this time
general 2020-12-19 07:33:05 Thunderbolt II is built around the Avenger rotary cannon
The original Thunderbolt is built around the engine
general 2020-12-19 07:34:17 Then make a server

plane-crazy 2020-12-19 07:39:56 Well they can't see you too
general 2020-12-19 07:50:15 what if guns in Plane Crazy made a sound
general 2020-12-19 07:50:24 So instead of silence
general 2020-12-19 07:50:31 We get ***brrrrrt***

general 2020-12-19 08:45:13 Would he learn the true toxic communities
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 08:52:51 Actually you can, that's just standard design on my fighters
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 08:53:05 The thing is, the moving part of motors themselves have no collision
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 08:53:23 Only the base does, meaning you can hide them
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 08:53:39 And if you can't, you need to practice motor locking more
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 08:54:29 Pretty basic tbh

general 2020-12-19 09:15:16 Not only that but also make a working door also
general 2020-12-19 09:15:43 It probably may be easier considering I made the tail out of half wedges instead of the usual triangle wedges
general 2020-12-19 09:16:19 I gave it the same treatment as the nose
general 2020-12-19 09:17:23 Has there been any tiger stripes aircraft camo, it just feels appropriate here
general 2020-12-19 09:18:06 I hate myself more now that I realize the wings need to be mounted high
general 2020-12-19 09:18:13 Actually no
general 2020-12-19 09:18:17 That's less work now

general 2020-12-19 11:09:08 The clues I'm getting is that you live in a former part of the Soviet Union
general 2020-12-19 11:10:00 I can see why that can suck 

Over here we got colonized by the Spanish, Japanese and Americans
general 2020-12-19 11:11:08 Honestly their influences on us weren't that all bad
general 2020-12-19 11:58:55 Can a decent aircraft be made with only 9 blocks of width? (This is with folding wings)
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:00:46 A decent aircraft fit within these dimensions?
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:01:00 I was originally gonna make a passenger aircraft with a Ryanair livery
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:01:09 But I asked <#497142796961054721> and they said the idea of a jumbo jet aircraft carrier is better
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:03:31 The carrier is custom, and the planes I'll be carrying can be any
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:05:00 This is what I ended up building
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:05:03 Didn't really bother looking up references
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:05:15 All I did was "how do I make this as big as possible within my skill level without looking like a flying brick"
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:06:02 I was avoiding that
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:06:29 Well, assuming I did wing folding for the parasite fighters, would it be possible for the rest of the body to be 7 blocks wide?
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:07:56 I'm just modifying a passenger aircraft into an aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:08:38 No, I mean like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drnxZlS9gyw
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:08:47 I like this stupid idea
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:09:17 <@456226577798135808> Basically, I'm doing the video I sent
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:09:30 Well, I gotta go figure out how to do a decent aircraft body
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:09:36 Within such a tiny space
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:10:31 My 5th gen aircraft consume 9 blocks of space if not including wings
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:11:25 Ah, here's a suitable design
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:11:31 One of my old light fighters
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:12:04 The body is 7 blocks wide, meaning I could cram in folded wings as if it were in an aircraft carrier
general 2020-12-19 12:12:27 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/789827226858029066/RobloxScreenShot20201219_201108355.png I have found a suitable design for my jumbo jet aircraft carrier
general 2020-12-19 12:12:32 My old light fighter
general 2020-12-19 12:12:49 The one that does weird Cobra or whatever you people say
general 2020-12-19 12:13:02 Just gotta add folding wings and I'm good
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:13:32 20? I mean if you've seen the kind of suspension we have here that kinda sounds small
general 2020-12-19 12:14:32 How big do custom suspensions go
general 2020-12-19 12:14:51 <#384021699466756107> our local non-furry lizard man is making a map
general 2020-12-19 12:14:56 because rickje tweeted it
general 2020-12-19 12:15:08 go help him out suspension buidlers
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:15:41 I tried putting 3 1x7 block beams, okay it looks sufficient
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:16:13 Most builds take up half a plot
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:16:23 Don't they?
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:16:31 Well, I mean in width
general 2020-12-19 12:17:43 hmm yes bug eye headlights
general 2020-12-19 12:20:26 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/768692007404830751 Is this decent enough to look decently good but still fit within 9 blocks?
general 2020-12-19 12:20:59 because jumbo jet become carrier
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:21:52 Track width for a map for the game
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:22:13 <@456226577798135808> What kind of track though? Rally-style? Paved roads?
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:23:11 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tipxvSscEWA Sounds better than me suggesting this as a mixed surface course
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:23:59 <@456226577798135808> So something like Pikes Peak?
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:24:26 That sounds good, still tests suspension
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:24:37 <@456226577798135808> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tipxvSscEWA This is what I sent when I thought of mixed
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:24:51 We're already in an island <@!409676438682206218>
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:25:10 Yes, and it's bad now that I think of it
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:25:40 Pikes Peak like track better
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:27:00 I'll just let you do your magic then
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:27:23 Don't forget about the shipbuilders and aero engineers here
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:28:03 Gotta consider them too considering they make up a majority of the playerbase alongside land vehicle builders
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:28:13 Still sounds reasonable
general 2020-12-19 12:28:31 I'm 69
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:29:53 I feel like S.E Asia would look nice
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:30:30 Well, considering PC has a lot of military vehicles, it could fit in
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:30:32 But on the other hand
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:30:44 We also have a good chunk of non-military builds too
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:30:54 I feel like we shouldn't focus on one theme
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:31:34 Who even uses canyons?
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:31:43 I feel like you should make it diverse
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:32:31 Perhaps, though Innovation Inc. is more sciencey
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:32:40 So don't forget that
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:34:24 <@456226577798135808> What about existing builds? Like the airport, railway and the spawn base? Thinking you should also expand the dock from a basic rectangle to something more fleshed out
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:34:48 How much do you like history and geography?
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:35:00 That explains it
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:35:21 Hmm, alright. Don't forget about the somewhat diverse playerbase here though
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:36:49 Hmm, so
- Race track
- Interesting geography
- Improve existing spawn areas (because I personally find them to be sorta bland compared to what we usually have)
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:38:35 Some inspiration from real life would be good, but remember. This is Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:39:03 So you can still go a little wild considering this is PC
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:39:36 I mean we already have an underground base, so why not give a mix of real life and fiction
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:40:00 Volcano is more fitting than random lava lake
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:40:11 hmm yes hydrothermally powered base
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:42:30 Hmm, would it be a good or bad idea to have rivers
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:43:30 For PvP, it'll give a strategic advantage
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:43:38 For non-PvP, nice aesthetic
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:45:12 What if we carry tanks on ships
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:45:38 So like ramps, controlled bumps and turning tests?
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:47:23 Well, we already discussed some ideas
- Instead of lava lake, volcano where the Innovation Inc. base can be nearby. Plus hydrothermal power
- Rivers
- Improved spawn locations (so improve on airports, the dock, etc.)
- Race track (ask Rieperal about it)
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:48:14 I mean don't you think PC could use more flair?
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:48:21 We've had the same map for years now
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:48:30 Time to sprucen/freshen it up a bit
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:49:01 3 years of the same small map still feels like a point where it needs improvements
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:50:12 Speaking of trains

What if there's a secret railway to the Innovation Inc. base
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:50:42 Okay maybe that's just a bit too much
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:51:06 I was thinking it'd be like where supplies are received
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:51:17 If Plane Crazy had some realism
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:51:29 Which it does not have
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:51:54 Honestly why am I even thinkign up of ideas I'm feeling braindead
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:53:34 I just make aircraft
general 2020-12-19 12:56:06 https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b3/d0/96/b3d096de689188f3abdb956e6f106ece.jpg
https://www.arcair.com/Gal5/4501-4600/gal4507-B-52-Large/01.jpg
Should I do this camo?
general 2020-12-19 12:56:18 I don't do camo so this will be essentially my first time
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:59:05 Reminds me of one track on Forza, Fujimi Kaido. Could be fun if done right
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:59:22 Well, a plane I have is already at 2k and it's just the body, no wings or interior so far
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:59:36 Well, not right as in accurate
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 12:59:44 But right as in it's fun
general 2020-12-19 13:00:00 I just found it randomly
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 13:00:49 Hmm, I guess we'll just how it goes
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 13:01:21 I mean PC isn't a single player game, nor are there not large vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 13:01:28 So it pretty much is up to you
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 13:01:39 I guess striking a decent balance is good enough
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 13:02:17 Btw Rieperal, good luck
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 13:02:32 Gonna go watch that one show with a cheese for a fry cook
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 01:44:37 I fell asleep when you pinged me

Anyways it's a good start so far, I can see (or assume) what you're going for here
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 01:45:04 I wonder how'd they agree to this
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 01:48:37 I think I'll go to VIP 1 and check what happened there
bot-central 2020-12-20 01:48:42 !servers
the-dump 2020-12-20 01:55:06 too lazy to find it on PC, just gonna post it here so I can view it in browser
general 2020-12-20 02:03:41 Do aircraft carry tanks?
general 2020-12-20 02:05:21 Well, guess I continue with the Jumbo Jet Aircraft Carrier project
general 2020-12-20 02:09:45 Dora the Explorer
general 2020-12-20 02:14:39 I'd consider it a plane if
- Isn't a one time use, easily refuelable (similarly to a car)
- Intended to carry a load (whether it's passengers, weaponry or other related items not required for the aircraft to fly)
- Has some form of thrust, otherwise it's more of a glider
- Has some maneuverability within three axes
general 2020-12-20 02:16:10 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/609442446249820211/609442890472751104 Though technically it only says it needs to be able to do the three axes and flies naturally
general 2020-12-20 02:16:27 So if it can fly without helium or use engines to change pitch and stuff, well it passes
general 2020-12-20 02:22:47 I have crossed the bridge
the-dump 2020-12-20 02:50:11 haha i see 6 then 9
the-dump 2020-12-20 02:50:26 That is cursed
general 2020-12-20 02:52:43 I think I might need to do Antonov An-225 wings
general 2020-12-20 02:52:48 To compensate for wing sweep
general 2020-12-20 03:07:10 nMn

plane-crazy 2020-12-20 03:36:52 Hmm no not flat enough of a rear
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 03:36:59 I see curves

You're the servermom
general 2020-12-20 03:45:47 How many people here play WT
general 2020-12-20 03:45:51 Because I feel left out
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 03:46:29 Succhoi
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 03:47:06 You're building a Sukhoi Su-57 "Felon"
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 03:47:49 Excuse me
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 03:47:52 Succhoi*

This isn't Twitter
general 2020-12-20 03:49:20 Yes but that's the kind of thing I'd expect from Twitter
general 2020-12-20 03:50:06 I willingly got Twitter 

Still better than being forced to use Facebook since people in the Philippines love it as much as Facebook loves being controversial
general 2020-12-20 03:50:34 Facebook is worse
general 2020-12-20 03:50:59 4-chan?
general 2020-12-20 03:53:20 4-chan is the edgy wasteland 
Reddit is the hive of cringe 
Facebook is boomerland with big Zuckerlizard watching 
Twitter is a warzone 
Google+ is dead
general 2020-12-20 03:53:58 Monkes love Messenger, what did you expect
general 2020-12-20 03:54:11 Instagram is cloutland
general 2020-12-20 03:54:31 Actually I think that's the worst of Instagram, clout
general 2020-12-20 03:54:38 And the fact it's owned by Facebook
general 2020-12-20 03:54:58 I avoid Instagram and Facebook because cringe privacy trap
general 2020-12-20 03:55:41 Instagram not really cringe, but there's people who chase cloudy there
general 2020-12-20 03:55:48 Clout*
general 2020-12-20 03:56:25 I don't really use Instagram simply because it's owned by Facebook
general 2020-12-20 03:56:46 Like they already got themselves in trouble way too much
general 2020-12-20 03:57:54 I've found some friends over at Twitter
general 2020-12-20 03:58:05 And Discord
general 2020-12-20 03:58:50 I usually keep my online life separate from the rest of my life
general 2020-12-20 05:17:37 I just realized something

Are we embracing being furries by rejecting humanity, embrace monke
general 2020-12-20 05:17:41 By being monke
general 2020-12-20 05:18:05 but real life hurts
general 2020-12-20 05:18:15 how about too much escapism bad
general 2020-12-20 05:18:19 but a little bit of escapism good
general 2020-12-20 05:18:36 like how too much coffee bad, but little coffee good

general 2020-12-20 05:28:25 Thanks she's smart
general 2020-12-20 05:28:58 Also, if you're less dense than water shouldn't you be more likely to float above it?
general 2020-12-20 05:29:43 he broke it after an intense writing session

It has implied NSFW

general 2020-12-20 07:13:34 was Discord down down, or is it just having an extreme case of lag?
general 2020-12-20 07:14:10 Guess it's just a thing in Asia

general 2020-12-20 07:18:10 I think I might be able to do more detailed camo by taking advantage of wing panels
general 2020-12-20 07:18:54 I kinda wanna @ miner but I doubt they aren't busy
general 2020-12-20 07:20:40 Spidercrab
general 2020-12-20 07:22:35 Even without the third fold, I already know this looks tiny
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:24:10 tiny wing
I'll make it bigger, I just don't know how much
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:24:24 I might continue to fold just to see how much length I have available
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:26:18 This is how much length I have
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:26:22 Does it need more wing sweep btw?
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:27:43 Looked at blueprints of the three well known large aircraft, mine needs more sweep
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:28:01 Those three aircraft being the Antonov An-225, Boeing 747 and Airbus A380
general 2020-12-20 07:28:48 can someone wish me luck in redesigning this wing, it's not large enough and needs more wing sweep
general 2020-12-20 07:29:05 It's tiny in width, though in length is decent
general 2020-12-20 07:29:59 As in Proto's video, wings that don't have the default texture don't play nice (even though ice wings worked perfectly fine for me)
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:31:12 If at first it doesn't look good, redesign until it's hell (or looks good enough)
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:33:02 I think I may need 4000 blocks when I'm finished with my plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:33:15 And then some if you include it's cargo
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:33:18 Fighter jets
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:33:32 5000?
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:33:58 I think I forgot one detail
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:34:11 Underside mounted hooks
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 07:34:14 To grab the fighters

general 2020-12-20 07:45:36 fuck
general 2020-12-20 07:45:43 I have more redesigning to do
general 2020-12-20 07:45:54 Now instead of doing tail-mounted doors
general 2020-12-20 07:46:13 Now I have to do underside mounted doors to drop off micro fighter jets
general 2020-12-20 07:46:33 Not only that but I also have to manage to do a recovery system and a refueling system
general 2020-12-20 07:47:25 Anyone here knows how to do a semi seamless bomb bay door?
general 2020-12-20 07:47:33 But instead of bombs, it's small fighter jets
general 2020-12-20 07:48:21 Good but not the best
general 2020-12-20 07:48:34 Outside of Roblox it's hopelessly outclassed by Forza Horizon
general 2020-12-20 07:48:51 In Roblox, well it has competition
general 2020-12-20 07:49:24 Isn't the starter car there a Subaru BRZ
general 2020-12-20 07:51:40 Hmm, must've misremembered it for another game
general 2020-12-20 07:52:17 Can shipbuilders and airliner builders give me advice when building large builds
general 2020-12-20 07:55:31 is it good advice to save two copies of a build
general 2020-12-20 07:55:41 In case I severely fuck up
general 2020-12-20 07:57:23 I now learned that 1x3 wing panels don't have enough of a wing sweep
general 2020-12-20 07:57:31 1x2 this time
general 2020-12-20 07:57:40 And if 1x2 doesn't work, 1x1
general 2020-12-20 08:00:44 I'm watching some videos to c a l m
general 2020-12-20 08:01:14 A part of me wants to temp-block and a part of me doesn't
general 2020-12-20 08:11:38 futbol
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 08:16:35 It's in Materials
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 08:16:47 Can find it either in the build menu or the paint tool

general 2020-12-20 12:36:29 Be transparent to your elephont child
general 2020-12-20 12:36:40 How?
general 2020-12-20 12:37:24 Explain to me the events that happened that motivated you in a way that makes you wanna build a 1:1 cardboard working maus
general 2020-12-20 12:37:32 For I am very confuse
general 2020-12-20 12:37:51 What happened in your Fur-Day
general 2020-12-20 12:38:09 But I am building the carrier
general 2020-12-20 12:38:20 But this carrier is airborne
general 2020-12-20 12:38:33 So I can commence "air strike fighters" on your t o n k
general 2020-12-20 12:38:58 Because memes
general 2020-12-20 12:39:01 People upvote the funni
general 2020-12-20 12:39:05 Also tank kinda sucks
general 2020-12-20 12:39:30 The bimak

general 2020-12-20 12:40:31 Wait
general 2020-12-20 12:40:35 "Built-in"
general 2020-12-20 12:40:49 Is Discord implying we can add custom commands to the pop-up UI?
general 2020-12-20 12:45:30 Because it's fur-day
general 2020-12-20 12:45:41 wait I thought that was yesterday (at least in the US)
general 2020-12-20 12:45:48 There's Anti-Fur day, then there's Fur Day

general 2020-12-20 12:54:31 yes wing light
general 2020-12-20 12:54:48 You could use wing lights for those orange dots
general 2020-12-20 12:55:14 where
general 2020-12-20 12:55:29 ah yes pirate land
general 2020-12-20 12:58:13 How peaceful is Somaliland compared to Somalia
general 2020-12-20 12:59:30 too much
general 2020-12-20 12:59:35 Monke don't like
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 13:11:28 So, for the wings of my aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 13:11:43 Should I do Airbus A380 wings and just smooth swept wings
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 13:11:44 https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Airbus-A380.gif
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 13:12:02 Or do I the slightly kinked wings of the Antonov An-225 Myria
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 13:12:03 https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/An-225-3.jpg
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 13:12:32 Which one is a better fit for a custom aircraft whose main purpose is to be an airborne carrier
general 2020-12-20 13:12:46 <#497142796961054721> i have question
general 2020-12-20 13:12:50 mostly design wise
general 2020-12-20 13:13:03 oof I meant <#384021699466756107>

general 2020-12-20 13:15:26 Lockheed C-5 Galaxy
general 2020-12-20 13:15:58 For a company that makes some pretty decent military aircraft and one good passenger aircraft, dang that's a phat nose
general 2020-12-20 13:16:20 ur mom loves you
general 2020-12-20 13:25:26 I will go watch Cheesehead Brownpants now
general 2020-12-20 14:42:07 The Convair 990 has a top speed of 1,000 km/h, maybe that's a good speed I should aim for
general 2020-12-20 14:43:12 Wait she's asking for an ERP? Why
general 2020-12-20 14:44:18 Something's wrong with her in a way that doesn't tick with me
general 2020-12-20 14:44:33 Like why is she so picky
general 2020-12-20 14:44:38 And so random
general 2020-12-20 14:47:54 I read the DMs, remember 

Idiots think they know more than you.
general 2020-12-20 14:48:47 And having learned the hard way, you became less of an idiot
general 2020-12-20 14:48:54 Which is good
general 2020-12-20 14:49:00 That's just normal
general 2020-12-20 14:49:06 Learning from your mistakes
general 2020-12-20 14:50:56 Could it be she has some irl problems where instead of trying to seek help, she instead relies on unhealthy amounts of escapism like clinging onto your RPs
general 2020-12-20 14:51:20 Now that I think of it
general 2020-12-20 14:51:56 I don't, I'm broke and I'm not gonna RP with some random kids who godmodes
general 2020-12-20 14:53:03 I'm trying to get back into it
general 2020-12-20 14:53:11 In a server I joined
general 2020-12-20 14:53:22 During my earlier years of Discord
general 2020-12-20 14:54:13 I used to do it, I might get back to *one* server I'm in related to it
general 2020-12-20 14:54:22 Just one server, nothing else
general 2020-12-20 14:54:51 Human brain efficiency
general 2020-12-20 14:55:07 I like to have variety in the free stuff I have
general 2020-12-20 14:55:19 And because my options in free is limited
general 2020-12-20 14:55:31 Yeah that explains why I used to RP
general 2020-12-20 14:57:12 The only RP server I'm in is a kingdom sort of thing, I still gotta write some lore for mine
general 2020-12-20 14:58:01 I don't use scripts
general 2020-12-20 14:59:56 <@715036601247465599> Think of the server I'm in having lore already
general 2020-12-20 15:00:06 With kingdoms
general 2020-12-20 15:00:39 Yeah I'm not good at explaining
general 2020-12-20 15:01:01 Honestly I don't know why I talk about the stuff I've done in the past
general 2020-12-21 00:06:28 I'm still confused why some swept wings kink inward near the root
general 2020-12-21 00:07:33 https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/An-225-2.gif Kink as in the wings become straight near the roots of the wing
general 2020-12-21 00:08:22 Like in this Antonov An-225 Myira
general 2020-12-21 00:08:44 While the wings of the A380 are a clean swept wing, no noticeable kinking inwards
general 2020-12-21 00:10:24 I mean we are playing a game about building stuff, mainly vehicles
general 2020-12-21 00:11:06 At that scale, doubt so
general 2020-12-21 00:13:48 Considering the scale, I doubt you can make it detailed without making it unusually large
general 2020-12-21 00:14:21 hmm yes do not armor me
general 2020-12-21 00:15:19 Clegg
general 2020-12-21 00:16:00 ah fokk it I'll just do a clean swept wing, kinking it inwards will make a bit oversized anyways
general 2020-12-21 00:19:04 dart with thicc large delta wings
general 2020-12-21 00:19:16 A detailed one however, well you can't beat miner's

general 2020-12-21 00:31:32 Why would some DDoS a random user?
general 2020-12-21 00:31:49 It's called a Distributed Denial of Service
general 2020-12-21 00:31:58 Which means to deny a service
general 2020-12-21 00:32:08 You have to target the *servers*, not the *users/client*
general 2020-12-21 00:32:32 https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/
general 2020-12-21 00:32:43 DDoS only applies in computing/software
general 2020-12-21 00:33:25 Doesn't make sense to say "rams gave a distributed denial of service to jets"
general 2020-12-21 00:33:33 Like a jet isn't a service
general 2020-12-21 00:33:48 It's a vehicle, you don't call your car a service unless you rideshare
general 2020-12-21 00:34:41 In that case what you're referring to is interdiction
general 2020-12-21 00:34:53 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdictor
general 2020-12-21 00:36:03 Honestly this guy is confusing

general 2020-12-21 00:36:46 I'm not into sports but we're more into basketball over here
general 2020-12-21 00:37:17 We have boxing over here
general 2020-12-21 00:37:36 Personally I have that view, even with the things that I like
general 2020-12-21 00:37:38 Such as motorsports

general 2020-12-21 01:40:42 I think I shall brand my stupid yet effort(ful?) builds under the name Shitpost Industries
general 2020-12-21 01:40:59 yes that is exactly what I want
general 2020-12-21 01:41:12 It's a stupid idea and I love it

general 2020-12-21 10:56:55 Elephant is nice
Also really good elephant, good details
general 2020-12-21 11:18:10 How much is 3356 blocks
general 2020-12-21 11:18:45 Ah yes, a bomber refueling a bomber refueling a bomber while two helicopters watch
general 2020-12-21 11:19:46 okay let me rethink my question

Is 3356 blocks a lot for an aircraft whose right wing is only 2/3 finished while the left wing is basically non-existentn
general 2020-12-21 11:21:11 I'm still not finished, I also have to replace beams with regular blocks for camo, not to mention the carrier function I have to consider
general 2020-12-21 11:22:03 For the carrier function, I should aim a little high. Instead of simple drop and forget, I'll try to make it retrievable
general 2020-12-21 11:22:11 I don't know how but I'm guessing magnets or perhaps a hook system
general 2020-12-21 11:22:46 I should also try making refueling a possible thing, because it's a carrier aircraft (not aircraft carrier)
general 2020-12-21 11:24:16 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Boeing_747_AAC_cutaway.png
general 2020-12-21 11:24:21 Basically this
general 2020-12-21 11:24:54 I have a lot to cram in there
general 2020-12-21 11:25:22 For release and retrieval, I think just using regular bomb bays would work
general 2020-12-21 11:26:27 As for how I'll do the hangar, if I remember correctly it has a conveyor system
general 2020-12-21 11:26:55 So I'll just do something similar, using what does tutorial ziplines use
general 2020-12-21 11:27:19 I honestly have no idea how the recovery bay will insert the aircraft back into the hangar
general 2020-12-21 11:28:13 <@!447221768520859659> Any idea on how I'll make the aircraft recovery bay put the aircraft back into the hangar?

plane-crazy 2020-12-21 11:29:22 Anyone here have any ideas how I'll put an aircraft in the recovery bay back into the hangar
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 11:30:37 I keep forgetting magnets exist, but I'm aware it's laggy
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 11:30:55 Or maybe I just haven't used it enough
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 11:31:19 I'm fine with a bit of temporary lag
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 11:32:11 If it doesn't end up causing too much lag, I think I'll do a tutorial zipline like thing, but with an extendable arm with a magnet on one end
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 11:32:29 Extendable arm is just suspension + rope
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 11:34:22 Did someone do that to you
general 2020-12-21 11:35:10 When a magnet welds something, does it create lag? And when it does, can it unweld?
general 2020-12-21 11:35:54 Oh

I think I need a break I'm overcomplicating stuff
general 2020-12-21 11:36:24 Aight, I'll either do a mini-fighter or a folding wing one
general 2020-12-21 11:36:41 Probably the former, makes more sense

plane-crazy 2020-12-21 12:08:52 I tried making a microfighter for my AAC
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 12:09:34 It kinda works but lacks in stability and kinda ugly, on the other hand 9 blocks is the maximum width
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 12:09:42 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_aircraft_carrier> This kind of AAC
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 12:10:01 At least it has a hover drive

general 2020-12-22 00:11:39 No, screw off, I'm outta here
general 2020-12-22 00:12:34 I know a way to get free Minecraft Bedrock Edition
general 2020-12-22 00:12:53 Is that the particle game I keep forgetting the name of
general 2020-12-22 00:13:03 Oh, I thought you were on mobile
general 2020-12-22 00:13:18 Looks like Vista
general 2020-12-22 00:14:03 Oh, I know a place to Minecraft Bedrock Edition on mobile (unless you're on iOS)
general 2020-12-22 00:14:33 ~~yes some of us do that here~~

general 2020-12-22 00:19:35 This is what I get
general 2020-12-22 00:19:42 When searching for "US 6th generation fighter"
general 2020-12-22 00:19:51 Spreading pride
general 2020-12-22 00:20:23 That exists as the Lockheed Martin X-44 MANTA
general 2020-12-22 00:20:40 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_X-44_MANTA
general 2020-12-22 00:20:55 Now here's a tailless F-22 Raptor
general 2020-12-22 00:21:58 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_X-36 There's also this
general 2020-12-22 00:22:09 hmm yes good russian plane
general 2020-12-22 00:22:16 sukhoi good
general 2020-12-22 00:22:44 If only the Roblox physics engine had inertia
general 2020-12-22 00:22:52 Also apparently it doesn't have terminal velocity
general 2020-12-22 00:23:09 One time I fell into the void falling at 10k+ sps
general 2020-12-22 00:23:40 Roblox no terminal velocity
general 2020-12-22 00:23:50 you just keep accelerating
general 2020-12-22 00:24:25 <@!738702049113538600> what if Plane Crazy had aerodynamics, so aircraft shape is important
general 2020-12-22 00:24:31 And shredders are even weaker
general 2020-12-22 00:24:56 Let's just settle for inertia
general 2020-12-22 00:25:15 At least it lets us finally do somewhat realistic maneuvers
general 2020-12-22 00:26:32 Well, it lets us pull it off but not much of a challenge in terms of aircraft design
general 2020-12-22 00:27:02 What if I told Shinji
general 2020-12-22 00:27:10 ||**O w O**||
general 2020-12-22 00:27:36 I think I'll go try one with one of my older aircraft
general 2020-12-22 00:30:28 Couldn't pull it off
general 2020-12-22 00:30:35 Still has the change in pitch
general 2020-12-22 00:39:31 https://streamable.com/knd4qx I tried it, still doesn't feel good enough
general 2020-12-22 00:41:58 <@!738702049113538600> https://streamable.com/knd4qx Is this close or not?
general 2020-12-22 00:42:30 Fasn't
general 2020-12-22 00:42:40 It's a pretty old design tbh
general 2020-12-22 00:44:26 I'm just asking eunsoo t osee if I did a Cobra
general 2020-12-22 00:44:36 In the vid I sent
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 00:46:29 https://streamable.com/knd4qx Did I do a Cobra right
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:01:22 That's the one thing I couldn't manage
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:01:34 https://streamable.com/6k2y5v abandon controlled flat spin, become glider
general 2020-12-22 01:05:53 How about I abandon controlled flat spin
general 2020-12-22 01:05:55 Become glider
creations-chat 2020-12-22 01:07:11 You engine builders give me a brainfuck, for how you people manage to pull those off
creations-chat 2020-12-22 01:09:17 All my brain is thinking of right now is give crankshaft and camshaft a form of a timing belt
general 2020-12-22 01:12:14 How much unranked does appear in <#504436696021204992>?

Also yes <#504436696021204992> is more of a review instead of feedback
general 2020-12-22 03:41:11 Well, Prototrode says materials affect mass
general 2020-12-22 03:41:23 Considering Prototrode smort
general 2020-12-22 03:41:29 Well I'll just take that as fact
general 2020-12-22 03:41:54 I'm still confused on how swashplates work
general 2020-12-22 03:43:04 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uogugKueTvY This is the only video where I actually got information out of it
general 2020-12-22 03:43:30 Helicoopers too complicated
general 2020-12-22 03:44:06 Yes you're right

But still posts content occasionally that I can somewhat comprehend so doesn't matter
general 2020-12-22 03:44:21 I have no idea how helicopters work in general
general 2020-12-22 03:44:24 That's why I make planes
general 2020-12-22 03:44:52 But I have an AAC in progress
general 2020-12-22 03:45:11 Airborne Aircraft Carrier
general 2020-12-22 03:45:21 It's exactly as it sounds, an aircraft carrier but airborne
general 2020-12-22 03:45:53 I already made the Microfighters for my AAC
general 2020-12-22 03:45:58 Looks kinda weird though
general 2020-12-22 03:46:10 Imagine Saab Viggen but the canards are now elevators, and more wing sweep
general 2020-12-22 03:46:48 Still it does fly at a decent speed for a microfighter, at 500ish while still being surprisingly stable and can sustain a level flight
general 2020-12-22 03:47:18 I don't mind pineapple on pizza
Just don't drown the pizza in ketchup
general 2020-12-22 03:47:28 Like seriously who puts ketchup on pizza
general 2020-12-22 03:47:32 That's called drowning a pizza
general 2020-12-22 03:47:51 Ask my parents' questionable habits
general 2020-12-22 03:47:59 Imagine putting tomato on tomato
general 2020-12-22 03:48:02 The pizza already has tomato
general 2020-12-22 03:48:11 I once remembered my parents using a ***fork*** to eat pizza
general 2020-12-22 03:48:13 Like why
general 2020-12-22 03:48:20 That's what the crust is for
general 2020-12-22 03:48:38 You don't need a fork and a knife to eat pizza
general 2020-12-22 03:48:52 potato good, yes
general 2020-12-22 03:48:54 let's talk about fries
general 2020-12-22 03:48:57 let's talk about potato
general 2020-12-22 03:49:10 ***I said we should talk about potatoes***
general 2020-12-22 03:49:14 potatoes good
general 2020-12-22 03:49:18 yes?
general 2020-12-22 03:50:12 spinny spinny on top to make it fly, but it also make helicooper go fidget spinner, so tail is there to make not spinny spin like a fidget spinner and instead pushy push
general 2020-12-22 03:50:38 yessy yes, biggy big crazy crazyzy johny john?

general 2020-12-22 04:17:16 I'd bet someone here is gonna get an idea
general 2020-12-22 04:19:44 Oh I meant as a submission in <#384025409945337856> 

On the other hand, looks kinda weird
general 2020-12-22 04:19:54 still, new Mustard video
general 2020-12-22 04:19:59 I always welcome a new video by Mustard
general 2020-12-22 04:23:32 So the Coleopter in vertical flight uses thrust vectoring, uses "conventional" triangular control surfaces in horizontal flight, and to vertically land is assisted by deployable "canards"
general 2020-12-22 04:24:05 With swiveling seats and tail mounted landing gear
general 2020-12-22 04:25:15 Scroll up
general 2020-12-22 04:25:22 It's also a ramjet aircraft
general 2020-12-22 04:25:33 very unconventional
general 2020-12-22 04:30:05 Isn't that the same Ferrari Ford competed with in Le Mans?
general 2020-12-22 04:30:52 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_330_P3 you're right it looks different

general 2020-12-22 04:33:10 invisible silencer
general 2020-12-22 04:33:21 so silent Discord considers it a GIF

general 2020-12-22 07:10:03 If there's Anti-Furry and Furry Day
general 2020-12-22 07:10:08 Where's Anti-Weeb and Weeb Day
general 2020-12-22 07:10:21 To bring further balance
general 2020-12-22 07:11:13 DrunkComedi
general 2020-12-22 07:12:02 It looks like it had holes punched in it's cheeks

time for pain
general 2020-12-22 07:14:36 Stuff the meat of the animal encased in their own intestine
general 2020-12-22 07:15:46 **S t u f f T h e M e a t O f T h e H u m a n I n T h e i r I n t e s t i n e***
general 2020-12-22 07:16:25 So basically, spicy meat encased in a clean intestine
general 2020-12-22 07:16:44 That doesn't sound bad
general 2020-12-22 07:16:52 I'll still eat sosigs
general 2020-12-22 12:27:06 Are read/write times agony?
general 2020-12-22 12:27:18 no do not the blind
general 2020-12-22 12:27:51 Oof, personally I kinda prefer speed now
general 2020-12-22 12:28:14 Like it's still important to have a decent capacity but I don't want agonizingly slow speeds
general 2020-12-22 12:28:31 My cousin got himself an external SSD for that, even got Windows 10 running on it
general 2020-12-22 12:29:30 Unless it's one of those shockproof drives
general 2020-12-22 12:29:40 Get an SSD
general 2020-12-22 12:29:53 Who casually destroys a hard drive?
general 2020-12-22 12:30:07 Don't get your mind in the gutters
general 2020-12-22 12:30:31 Then that sounds a lot like

Redundant
Array of
Inexpensive
Disks
general 2020-12-22 12:30:52 Sounds a lot like something Linus would do
general 2020-12-22 12:31:18 It's literally called RAID
general 2020-12-22 12:31:30 A redundant array of inexpensive disks
general 2020-12-22 12:31:48 Basically, store data across different disks/drives
general 2020-12-22 12:32:03 Intentionally fragmented
general 2020-12-22 12:32:51 That sounds like Windows 10X
general 2020-12-22 12:33:54 This looks like a glorified Chromebook
general 2020-12-22 12:34:21 Literally just UWP and web apps, very Chromebooky
general 2020-12-22 12:34:34 Speaking of containers
general 2020-12-22 12:34:41 I got GWSL to run Linux apps
general 2020-12-22 12:34:58 And I might get GNOME Boxes
general 2020-12-22 12:35:02 Because why not

general 2020-12-23 10:55:16 **o h**
general 2020-12-23 10:55:24 Flan
general 2020-12-23 10:57:48 We don't have that
general 2020-12-23 10:57:53 Or at least not as widespread as flan
general 2020-12-23 10:58:16 okay not everyone here has a blowtorch
general 2020-12-23 10:58:22 at least for cooking
general 2020-12-23 10:58:43 probably for good reason, you don't just casually teach kids that
general 2020-12-23 10:59:07 What reinforces that point for me is most people my age I've met are brainless morons
general 2020-12-23 10:59:18 Basically, think of the typical TikTok idiot
general 2020-12-23 10:59:57 How about if those brainless morons are high school students
general 2020-12-23 11:00:32 I remember seeing a lighter that oddly looked like a handgun
general 2020-12-23 11:00:40 I'm Asian
general 2020-12-23 11:01:00 Those morons look like monkes, and not the good kind
general 2020-12-23 11:01:03 Like the bad kind
general 2020-12-23 11:01:12 Anyways, today I had pain setting up XFCE for WSL2
general 2020-12-24 05:00:03 How should I feel about seeing an avatar with no clothes
general 2020-12-24 05:00:26 one-eyed ball
general 2020-12-24 05:00:36 no no
general 2020-12-24 05:00:38 he be a pirate
general 2020-12-24 05:01:10 Is that multi-boot
general 2020-12-24 05:01:19 Why four?
general 2020-12-24 05:01:25 And why three different versions of Windows
general 2020-12-24 05:01:44 But why two versions of Windows 10
general 2020-12-24 05:01:55 Arma? Have any experience with X servers and WSL2?
general 2020-12-24 05:02:09 Guess I'll go set it up myself
general 2020-12-24 05:02:27 why not pro instead of home?
general 2020-12-24 05:03:24 You know what kinda sucks, Roblox is Linuxn't
general 2020-12-24 06:42:22 this explains a lot
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 06:44:02 Assuming what was deleted is indeed what WITWRobloxAlt1 said, it's an aeromorph
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 06:44:33 Appearance varies, from the kind you'd find in Disney/Pixar's Planes to actual furry aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 06:44:56 Personally I find automorphs (if that's correct) to be more cursed
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 06:45:21 I simply can't ignore the fact that it's a car at that point, can't fool myself into believing otherwise
general 2020-12-24 06:45:53 That's one way of destroying pigeons
general 2020-12-24 06:47:28 Now that Roblox is down for now, I wonder what kind of setup others here use in FPS games
plane-crazy 2020-12-24 06:49:54 hmm yes birb go squish
general 2020-12-24 06:50:20 Roblox is down'nt
general 2020-12-24 06:50:24 According to Down Detector
general 2020-12-24 06:51:12 Fall asleep to jojo's words
general 2020-12-24 06:51:30 now I go play the game
general 2020-12-24 06:51:36 Where I survive waves of zombies
general 2020-12-24 06:51:44 On Bobuxland

general 2020-12-24 06:57:48 bot no good
general 2020-12-24 06:57:54 unless it's a tool assisted speedrun
general 2020-12-24 06:57:59 or one of those AI tests
general 2020-12-24 06:58:15 Or you have no choice and it's single player
general 2020-12-25 01:23:18 One question, are Redditors toxic smartasses?
general 2020-12-25 01:23:28 Or at least is that the stereotype
general 2020-12-25 01:24:08 And do they talk like cringe?
general 2020-12-25 01:24:22 I've met some people who I think would fit within that stereotype
general 2020-12-25 01:24:35 "his mom prob teached him how to fight back bullys"
general 2020-12-25 01:25:03 Actually I think I've met the normal internet kid
general 2020-12-25 01:25:25 Fortnite addiction, always toxic-aggressive, attempts to make low effort builds look cool
general 2020-12-25 01:26:26 <@456226577798135808> Should I just avoid the chat in PC altogether
general 2020-12-25 01:26:34 Kinda tiring to see little disappointing shits

general 2020-12-25 01:29:39 Do I go for cranked arrow or F-22 like wing but it's a double delta
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 01:31:23 w i n g s
general 2020-12-25 01:31:33 Okay, I'll go use a cranked arrow delta then
general 2020-12-25 01:35:12 Maybe I'll reconsider
general 2020-12-25 01:35:29 Entity cramming? Are you making an automated mob farm

general 2020-12-25 02:08:35 I heard KFC's better overseas, especially in Asia
general 2020-12-25 02:08:47 While in America, it's crap
general 2020-12-25 02:09:16 Is it true KFC overseas, especially in Asia, is doing better than in the US
general 2020-12-25 02:09:58 Instead we have TikTok teens
general 2020-12-25 02:10:37 They make me cringe

general 2020-12-25 02:32:02 Is there an anime for **Heckler and Koch** guns
general 2020-12-25 02:32:17 Even the famous P90?
general 2020-12-25 02:32:47 What about the Chicago Typewriter/Thompson?
general 2020-12-25 02:33:34 Okay, just two last questions
general 2020-12-25 02:33:53 Is there an M1 Garand and is there a Thompson SMG there

general 2020-12-25 02:37:37 hmm yes vector
general 2020-12-25 02:37:53 yes it is good pdw
general 2020-12-25 02:39:45 I wonder if H&K ever made an MP4 and MP3
general 2020-12-25 02:39:51 So I can do the funni
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 02:49:26 hmm yes good
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 02:50:16 Leading edge extensions
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 02:51:03 Mostly in giving my aircraft better controls, might abandon elevators
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 02:51:11 In exchange for a V-tail
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 02:51:33 If rick added mutl-keybinds then that would be good
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 02:51:51 I could use it to compensate for when my aircraft begins to have pitching issues
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 02:52:26 I saw a shredder
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 02:52:31 I 🤮
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 02:52:36 I'm in Non-PvP
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 02:54:02 Are you running on a potato
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 02:55:20 square
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 02:55:29 Like Raptor
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 02:56:29 Of course I'll add trail afterburner
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 02:57:02 The exhaust?
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 02:57:15 That oddly specific color is making me think of the BAE Systems Tempest
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 02:57:46 Too black
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 02:59:10 What if I made actual camo for the first time
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 02:59:20 Make it g r e e n
plane-crazy 2020-12-25 02:59:26 Or maybe use urban camo
general 2020-12-25 03:05:23 rickroll
general 2020-12-25 03:09:54 Imagine if rick added multi-keybinds
general 2020-12-25 03:10:54 Multi-keybinds still pretty useful
general 2020-12-25 03:11:03 Like I want my plane to have less m o t o r s
general 2020-12-25 03:11:12 Basically, multiple inputs
general 2020-12-25 03:11:27 Like for example
general 2020-12-25 03:11:49 I can make a V-tail actually function as a ruddervator
general 2020-12-25 03:12:31 Still kinda poob controls for modern aircraft
general 2020-12-25 03:12:58 Motor lock isn't gonna solve that for compact builds
general 2020-12-25 03:14:30 Sometimes, less is more
general 2020-12-25 03:15:39 Pretty inconvenient to use two motor 2s
general 2020-12-25 03:15:46 Just to do multiple keybinds
general 2020-12-25 03:16:09 And it doesn't really add more complexity to the users
general 2020-12-25 03:16:21 If you think it does, it really sounds more like laziness
general 2020-12-25 03:16:42 Like you've managed to assign locked motors to an unused key
general 2020-12-25 03:16:51 Why can't you do the same?
general 2020-12-25 03:18:37 Boi not everyone is into PvP
general 2020-12-25 03:19:09 There's a thing called avoiding
general 2020-12-25 03:19:30 Why would anyone intentionally fly into lava or the propellers
general 2020-12-25 03:19:44 What loss are you gonna get from having multiple keybinds
general 2020-12-25 03:19:54 It's not like you're forced to lose what you already have
general 2020-12-25 03:20:18 You can still use whatever you're used to
general 2020-12-25 03:21:34 And what's wrong with having multiple keybinds?
general 2020-12-25 03:21:53 Why do you think it's better to have two motor 2s?
general 2020-12-25 03:24:07 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Northrop_YF-23_DFRC.jpg
general 2020-12-25 03:24:33 See this, the ruddervators for example
general 2020-12-25 03:25:14 Also, why make one motor 2 dedicate to one job
general 2020-12-25 03:25:48 I could be making ailerons function like flaps
Without having to consume more space
general 2020-12-25 03:27:18 Right tail motor 2, but it only functions as a rudder
general 2020-12-25 03:27:34 Unless you're willing to have an obtuse keybind setup
general 2020-12-25 03:29:49 I remember when I tried to use two motors per ruddervator
general 2020-12-25 03:29:55 Ended up being less useful
general 2020-12-25 03:31:11 Also, how am I gonna fit a motor 2 stack here vertically
general 2020-12-25 03:31:25 It's literally two blocks tall
general 2020-12-25 03:32:45 It works perfectly fine without having to create an abnormally tall motor lock tower
general 2020-12-25 03:33:46 ok, we should stop now
general 2020-12-25 03:34:19 yes that
general 2020-12-25 03:34:24 also it's pretty fucking hot here
general 2020-12-25 03:34:53 How hot is 31 degrees celsius
general 2020-12-25 03:35:05 Which is 87 degrees Farenheit
general 2020-12-25 03:35:40 Is that considered hot
general 2020-12-25 03:41:53 That's the weather
general 2020-12-25 03:42:08 I'm somewhere near the equator
general 2020-12-25 03:42:16 With a tropical climate
general 2020-12-25 03:42:48 With the area being also vulnerable to typhoons
general 2020-12-25 03:42:59 so yes sometimes it's cold
general 2020-12-25 03:43:03 sometimes it's fucking hot
general 2020-12-25 03:43:08 I prefer the former
general 2020-12-25 03:43:15 At least it doesn't try to give me a stroke
general 2020-12-25 03:44:27 
general 2020-12-25 03:44:37 This is how bad it gets apparently
general 2020-12-25 03:44:52 okay let me do maths

general 2020-12-25 03:45:46 That isn't in a specific mountain area

general 2020-12-25 06:22:44 There are two things I'd like to say that affects the survival rate of a population
1.) Population Density
2.) Population density
general 2020-12-25 06:22:57 I don't know if we're overpopulated, but we sure are dense at times

general 2020-12-27 06:52:39 the fact that PC became mainstream invites even more undes, which is both good and bad

plane-crazy 2020-12-27 07:42:08 I'm currently thinking of what I'll do with this old plane I have
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 07:42:29 I mean it's surprisingly maneuverable for how crappy it's designed
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 07:42:57 Yet somehow stable enough to fill an interceptor role
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 07:43:16 Almost did 10K and it still flies straight without any forms of trying to die
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 07:43:31 And if I tried to pitch up to slow down, at most just sort of shakes a bit
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 07:43:43 Otherwise, funni cobra

general 2020-12-27 08:06:57 Honestly if someone gifted me a Kindle I'd think of it as a crap present
general 2020-12-27 08:07:36 You're still gonna get better value with Asian smartphones
general 2020-12-27 08:07:43 And the Galaxy Tab, if it's a tablet
general 2020-12-27 08:07:58 Or the iPad, if it's not Android
general 2020-12-27 08:09:15 Besides, e-books aren't exclusive to the Kindle, plus there's better e-readers anyways if you prefer the look of actual paper
general 2020-12-27 08:10:01 I remember playing Minecraft on a tablet as a kid
general 2020-12-27 08:10:36 The battery usage? Less artificial light?
plane-crazy 2020-12-27 08:11:19 "too fast"

general 2020-12-27 09:05:34 Would you believe this is still Windows?
general 2020-12-27 09:05:50 2/3 says still Windows
general 2020-12-27 09:05:58 Vilde's right
general 2020-12-27 09:06:35 I used Rainmeter, with the dock being a third party application called Nexus Dock
general 2020-12-27 09:07:36 Maybe Megalodon
general 2020-12-27 09:07:44 Unless they're actually offline and not just stalking
general 2020-12-27 09:12:08 I mean I could easily change it
general 2020-12-27 09:12:32 For a second I thought that was the default "immunity" bubble
general 2020-12-27 09:12:42 Where when you die, you have blue bubble that indicates you cannot be hurt
general 2020-12-27 09:13:36 Basically, shield bubble

general 2020-12-27 11:20:55 Is the amount of effort relative to the stuff I'll get not worth it?
general 2020-12-27 11:21:12 Personally I find the RB Battles one not worth it to complete
general 2020-12-27 11:21:26 But Ready Player Two to be worth it since it's not too hard

general 2020-12-27 11:29:13 <@!738702049113538600> Isn't it odd that a plane that looks like a Mirage with canards somehow pulls off a Cobra
general 2020-12-27 11:29:58 Yes but the Sukhoi Flanker's a 4th generation fighter jet
general 2020-12-27 11:30:10 If I remember, the Mirage is either 2nd gen or 3rd gen
general 2020-12-27 11:30:22 And wasn't designed with supermaneuverability in mind
general 2020-12-27 11:31:06 For WW84, I need 2200 for Steve's clothes + 5000 for the cat head to mess with people by being a furry
general 2020-12-27 11:31:24 A total of 7200
general 2020-12-27 11:31:36 One of those I'm dedicated to getting just to make sure the PCC suffers

general 2020-12-28 10:05:11 I'm gonna go find a plane with a good cockpit/canopy
general 2020-12-28 10:05:21 And figure out how to make custom ailerons not jam
general 2020-12-28 10:10:00 Any suggestions for decent canopies?
general 2020-12-28 10:10:25 I need images to get idea
general 2020-12-28 10:13:43 My multi keybind suggestion still better. At least better controls and provides redundancy if say an elevator was shot down
plane-crazy 2020-12-28 23:31:08 canopy still needs improvement

general 2020-12-28 23:34:43 I feel like the canopy still needs work
general 2020-12-28 23:37:02 I guess a simple motor angle does make a little better

general 2020-12-29 00:05:49 The only things I find odd about the Su-34 is the canopy/seating and the extended tail boom
general 2020-12-29 00:06:46 Anyways time to show an odd plane

general 2020-12-29 00:08:28 Apparently human powered

general 2020-12-29 00:09:42 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedral_kite> So this is why Bell made that weird plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 00:12:38 I was about to say what the hell is that up until i realized it was unlocked

plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:50:16 
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:50:18 This is what I have so far
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:50:46 nice, they updated the bot
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:51:16 You don't need to upload it to YouTube
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:51:32 https://streamable.com/ The server recommends this
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:51:36 And the bot too
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:52:11 I think I'll keep the canopy that way, I think it's decent enough without overcomplicating it
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:55:00 I still don't get swashplates
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:56:46 I find this easier
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:57:12 The intakes, the shape of the fuselage and tail fins
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:57:24 But it doesn't have the top mounted anhedral wings of the real Harrier
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:57:48 Oh wait it doesn't upon closer look
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:58:01 But the shape of the fuselage and tail fins might

plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:58:36 I think I recognize it a bit
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:58:50 <@!467565971918422017> McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom?
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:59:24 I recognized it once I saw the main wings with it's wing tips being diheral
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:59:32 And those intakes
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 02:59:36 And the general shape
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:03:04 It's possible with a large enough plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:03:20 Three folder planes are possible, I mean I have one

general 2020-12-29 03:47:37 I know this chat is in it's usual braindead state
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:49:03 <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:49:53 Let me type what's wrong here
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:51:06 - Cheese grater wings. Try using custom flaps, which is basically wings attached to a motor 2
- The nose doesn't exist, and it looks like a flying box. It's incredibly unaerodynamic
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:52:06 <@!244574447921528842> I recommend you look up 3D models, blueprints and images of a bunch of planes to see how exactly you'll design a plane

And no it's still flat
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:52:11 A nose should protrude, not sink
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:52:26 So the nose still doesn't exist
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:53:29 It needs a redesign in general
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:54:36 There isn't that much of a difference between a passenger jumbo jet and a military transport jet externally
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:55:05 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/C-17_test_sortie.jpg
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:55:11 Here's a Globemaster, see that nose?
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:55:19 It protrudes, doesn't sink
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:55:54 Made by Boeing, involved both in commercial and military aviation
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:56:08 All subsonic planes do that
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:56:38 The one you made pretty much violates basic aircraft design
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:57:04 I'm honestly surprised why it's like that to begin with
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:59:03 this is bad, at least for smaller aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:59:12 But it's still bad, too long
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:59:27 It's curved, but still bad
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 03:59:49 I'd say better than non-existent noses but I still could make it better
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:00:07 If I copied other noses, well I can't compensate for the nose looking like a diamond
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:00:10 So this will have to do
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:02:17 This is why I don't do large aircraft much, I always butcher the nose and tail
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:03:11 Well, the nose isn't a diamond
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:03:43 Well, triangle wedge based diamond
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:05:22 <@!790732709559271444> Imagine this but at a larger scale
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:05:27 It's gonna get flat looking at larger scales
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:05:35 And I hate it on large aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:05:53 On smol ones, it's acceptable.

plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:06:35 this just looks too awkward for me on large aircraft

plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:09:50 This is why we use custom control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:10:13 If I used the default control surfaces only, it would've performed horribly
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:10:36 It also shows the importance of wedges
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 04:10:54 Oh, if it's just for ranks then go ahead

general 2020-12-29 06:22:20 It does look kinda fat with it's lift fan and engine creating the tubular bulge in the middle

general 2020-12-29 06:23:14 Look at this
general 2020-12-29 06:23:25 F-35 looks like it has a bulge in the middle
general 2020-12-29 06:23:29 And that's what makes it look fat

general 2020-12-29 07:12:30 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Bird_of_Prey I have found a weird jet

general 2020-12-29 07:33:15 I find planes to be easier than ships
general 2020-12-29 07:33:34 Let me search up the qualifications
general 2020-12-29 07:34:26 
general 2020-12-29 07:34:54 But do trains turn in the spirit the mods are thinking of
general 2020-12-29 07:35:32 But is it turn as in independently without guidance?
general 2020-12-29 07:35:38 Because rails technically guide the train
general 2020-12-29 07:36:06 Hmm, I guess it could
general 2020-12-29 07:36:47 <@!466793357318815744> https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/609442446249820211/609442937792757761 As long as it doesn't use helium and is capable of yaw, pitch and roll
general 2020-12-29 07:36:53 Basically, your boat must fly like a plane too
general 2020-12-29 07:37:24 So if it satisfies that, then go ahead
general 2020-12-29 07:37:52 SHIELD Helicarrier is overbuilt if you think of building it
general 2020-12-29 07:38:16 Wait why?

plane-crazy 2020-12-29 10:11:59 wait this is <#384021699466756107>
general 2020-12-30 01:29:39 I think I might use the default landing gear as a tailhook
general 2020-12-30 01:30:16 Even though not everyone makes arresting gears
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:32:33 That plane is giving F-16 vibes
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:32:55 Though can't say much since this is all I get
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:36:46 Probably because I'm only getting a side view
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:36:53 Of that blueprint
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:37:01 And it's also pretty low-res
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:37:19 What I just woke up
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:39:55 i hate that this bomb bay door keeps getting stuck with the air brake
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:40:47 On the other hand, I attached the bomb bay door's motors to the air brake
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:41:11 And the air brake is attached to a motor lock tower
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:42:20 Oh, well guess I'll just replace the motor 2s with locked motor 1s
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:42:44 tbh this looks kind of an odd way of doing it
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:45:48 Well, I just realized the problem is that the door keeps hitting a trail
general 2020-12-30 01:46:13 i
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:54:49 Hmm
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:55:06 Is this variable sweep <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:55:58 https://i.redd.it/nw6192z2ui051.jpg
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:56:02 wing go swing swing
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:56:03 like this
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:56:06 The F-14 Tomcat
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:56:23 Then your wing needs more sweep
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:57:42 <@456226577798135808> Well, for supersonic planes they usually have a more triangular shape in wings https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/F-16_and_F-16XL_aerial_top_down_view.jpg
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:58:03 Above is the F-16XL, a cranked arrow wing fighter jet
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:58:12 Below is a regular F-16, a tailed delta aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:58:36 A cranked arrow is essentially a double delta but the flaps are cranked
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 01:59:12 What's a double delta? Look closely, you can see the sweep changes at the trailing edge of the plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 02:00:45 There is one exception though <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 02:00:46 https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/main_images/zsfsdasdf.jpg
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 02:00:50 Trapezoidal wings
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 02:01:10 They're another form of wings designed for supersonic flight
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 02:01:27 This plane is the F-104 Starfighter
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 02:02:38 The reason the trailing edge is like that is due to stealth, same on the F-22 Raptor (pictured) and YF-23 https://media.defense.gov/2006/Jul/05/2000550259/1088/820/0/060705-F-JZ506-835.JPG
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 02:03:58 Honestly you could just use a regular delta wing, just give it more sweep
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 02:04:08 Use 1x1 delta wing panels instead of 1x2
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 02:04:45 you eat the french

general 2020-12-30 02:29:55 I might just use the M1 Garand
general 2020-12-30 02:30:04 The SAP-6 isn't working out for me
general 2020-12-30 02:30:24 Or maybe the KAC PDW
general 2020-12-30 02:30:47 What a funni name, KAC PDW
general 2020-12-30 02:32:19 😳

general 2020-12-30 02:45:33 I find it odd an expert acts like this

plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:35:21 What does it mean if an aircraft drifts
plane-crazy 2020-12-30 04:35:31 As in it slowly yaws even without rudder input
general 2020-12-30 04:37:59 Anyone knows why a plane can yaw without input?

general 2020-12-30 07:11:34 How does one use hover thrusters in their suspensions
general 2020-12-30 07:11:53 I've seen jojo use them
general 2020-12-30 07:12:33 ~~why am I getting magnetic suspension vibes~~
general 2020-12-30 07:13:01 Oh, that advice actually makes sense
general 2020-12-30 07:13:25 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TS28sYywi4 I'm also watching Prototrode because I have no idea how suspensions work at all tbh
general 2020-12-30 07:13:42 I've done planes, but suspension, not really
general 2020-12-30 07:14:10 I wanna know what's the context behind this

plane-crazy 2020-12-31 12:04:34 too much s p r o i n g

general 2020-12-31 13:12:55 For making a pet named Steve be in Google autocomplete
general 2020-12-31 13:14:59 This is sorta Gamer Thailand
general 2020-12-31 13:15:24 By trying to prove he didn't copy, he further proved he did indeed copy
general 2020-12-31 13:15:40 The fact he knows so much thus implies he did copied
general 2020-12-31 13:16:08 Sometimes, it's better to just shut up than to argue
general 2020-12-31 13:17:05 Don't send Gamer Thailand the Streisand Effect
general 2020-12-31 13:17:24 He must learn it the hard way, through experiences
general 2020-12-31 13:17:45 That should also build character in the process, that's if he had the mental capacity to begin with
general 2020-12-31 13:18:45 Just get Knockback Infinity, problem solved
general 2020-12-31 13:19:44 Every Plane Crazy YouTuber has a consistent style, yes (apart from Gamer)
general 2020-12-31 13:19:59 Prototrode usually sticking with highly technical builds but memey editing
general 2020-12-31 13:20:28 Rens usually going for nice aesthetic
general 2020-12-31 13:20:41 But Gamer has no consistent style
general 2020-12-31 13:21:06 Bad enough to give his channel some personality, more implied copying

plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:21:33 
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:22:19 This is the exhaust, of a jet engine
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:23:07 What, you asked for suggestions
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:25:14 What if you make that carry surface to air missiles

plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:41:06 Provide more viewing angles
general 2021-01-01 02:41:46 Watches that have no proper markings at all shouldn't exist
general 2021-01-01 02:42:02 You know, watches where literally there's no numbers or roman numerals, literally just useless lines
general 2021-01-01 02:42:42 Still, what's the point of making those
general 2021-01-01 02:43:03 And monies
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:44:43 The wings are alright (apart from the vertical tail, what's up with protuding fins?) but it's kinda boxy
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:44:57 Looks fine but the wings are way too straight
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:46:23 For supersonic wings, I suggest either trapezoidal wings (like the F-18 Hornet or the F-104 Starfighter, F-35 also counts) or delta wings
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:46:52 Those aren't delta wings, those are straight tapered wings
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:47:47 <@!687744950158491731> This is a delta wing
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:48:04 You didn't

plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:48:21 These aren't delta wings, these are tapered straight wings
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:49:05 Just because you placed delta wing *panels*, doesn't mean you've made a delta wing
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:49:41 https://aviationenglishclasses.com/images/types%20of%20fix%20wing%20shapes.png
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:50:04 When we say delta wing, we mean the wing as a whole
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:50:09 Not wing *panels*
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:51:09 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_configuration> There's a lot of wing designs
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:51:36 But the most you'll ever need to know are straight, trapezoidal, swept, forward and delta
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:52:07 And also dihedral wings, anhedral wings and wingtips
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:52:40 How about I show you designs
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:55:55 What plane are you making?
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:57:15 Then that wing is way off
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:57:18 Let me get a blueprint

plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:58:32 If image is blurry, just open it in a new tab and zoom in
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:58:38 As you can see, your wing is way too straight
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:58:43 It needs to be more triangular
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 02:59:23 I should've just sent you the blueprint
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 03:00:18 Speaking of F-15s

plane-crazy 2021-01-01 03:00:31 This is a thrust vectored F-15

plane-crazy 2021-01-01 03:02:12 Just look at the Sukhoi Su-33
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 03:03:04 Which is also similar to the Su-30, the Su-33 being more specialized for navy use
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 03:03:34 The curve of what?
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 03:03:38 Be more specific
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 03:04:27 Just use a 1x2 delta going inwards
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 03:04:33 Followed by a 1x4 for the flap
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 03:06:28 <@!687744950158491731>
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 03:27:16 yes the wings look better
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 03:27:39 Now what's next is the elevators and the rudders
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 03:29:57 What if fighters flapped their wings

plane-crazy 2021-01-01 04:40:43 if there's wing, there's lift there
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 04:40:57 wing go rotate, wing become flap
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 04:44:06 this is how you make an aircraft roll to the left
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 04:44:34 You did something wrong didn't you
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 04:45:56 I'd rather use custom control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 04:46:40 https://streamable.com/1ekcof
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 04:46:47 Less space for better roll
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 04:48:30 Still better than cheese grater wing personally
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 04:50:06 Honestly, wing panels make for better control surfaces to begin with. You're gonna need more space if you add more of the default control panels

plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:16:05 
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:19:25 Is this for the new map?
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:19:55 I could think up of people to consider
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:20:13 Shipbuilders, aircraft builders, suspension builders, tanks/armored vehicle builders
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:20:47 Though there is one map builder I'm waiting for to finish
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:21:13 I talked to him alongside some other people about ideas
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:22:51 Some of the ideas I talked to Rieperal were a race track, a volcano instead of a lava lake (which opens up the idea of hydrothermally powered Innovation Inc. base), rivers to give smaller ships some purpose
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:23:04 ***l a g***
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:26:30 Tbh I kinda like the hill valley, gives purpose to suspension

general 2021-01-03 07:34:43 reichtangle better
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:37:38 - Bigger map, sure wouldn't hurt
- Bigger plot = bigger lag machiens
- Trees, eh
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:38:26 I guess, still brings up concerns for lag if someone were to use it to contribute to lag
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:39:08 Volcano would fit in more than lava lake
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:39:37 Plus it can integrate well with the innovation inc base
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:39:52 By making it hydrothermally powered
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:40:27 Add some stuff for suspension builders
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:40:42 Whether it'd be a race track, a hillclimb sort of thing, or etc.
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:41:19 Train tracks could use some more gentler curves
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:42:14 Who even uses the canyon tbh

plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:45:47 nothing
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:46:12 so add space stuff
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:46:32 To be fair, people have gone beyond 10k easily
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 07:47:00 30-50k sounds decent. 10k sounds a lot like high altitude

general 2021-01-03 12:39:40 If only I had a real copy of Minecraft
general 2021-01-03 12:42:49 I want it so I don't have to play on cracked servers and have an actual skin
general 2021-01-03 12:43:03 Cracked servers are boring nowadays
general 2021-01-03 12:43:14 Or maybe I haven't found the right one
general 2021-01-03 12:43:33 There's a setting for that, but I'm not talking about Aternos
general 2021-01-03 12:43:45 Aternos is only good if you need a free, cracked server
general 2021-01-03 12:44:03 The service is free, and allows for cracked players
general 2021-01-03 12:44:08 But for paid, I'm sure there's better options
general 2021-01-03 12:44:25 tried*
you tried
general 2021-01-03 12:45:27 If I had money and parents that actually let me earn and use money, I would've bought it some time ago
general 2021-01-03 12:45:34 But apparently, learning useless skills is more important
general 2021-01-03 12:46:21 they're cheapskates
general 2021-01-03 12:46:29 but maybe for a good reason
general 2021-01-03 12:46:59 I could imagine this could add up
general 2021-01-03 12:47:56 They gave me a $20 phone

It expectedly broke, the whole thing felt like it was made out of weak plastic
general 2021-01-03 12:48:18 The best phone I have is a 2014 ultra budget phone now
general 2021-01-03 12:48:39 Or a US sourced Samsung Galaxy S5 that has a hand me down
general 2021-01-03 12:48:48 Lenovo S90
general 2021-01-03 12:48:53 At least it's more durable

plane-crazy 2021-01-04 13:45:35 yes vip general can vote for hof builds
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 13:46:15 I mean to be fair we had Waluigi and a Japanese spider crab
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 13:46:26 Though to be fair those were pretty nice builds and was different

plane-crazy 2021-01-06 04:09:52 If you want something that flies perform well, the first thing to do is attach wing panels to motor 2s
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 04:10:02 The motor 2s make the wing panels act like flaps
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 04:10:43 The default control surfaces in this game suck

This is about the Yak-38, specifically the wings in general. Something's clearly wrong
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 12:34:08 tip three:
Don't do tutorial planes, unless they actually manage to teach you something
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 12:43:01 <@456226577798135808> Here's some advice on building planes
- For looks, I recommend to use 1x2 delta wing panels (for swept wings) or 1x1 delta wing panels (for delta wings) for the leading edge and either 1x4 wing panels or 1x4 delta wing panels for the trailing edge if it's supersonic (exception being trapezoidal wings). If it's subsonic, use straighter wings. Motor 2s help with angled wings.
- Wedges and half blocks are your friend, they really do make a plane more curved when used correctly. You can use motor locking if you're willing to use more advanced techniques
- For performance, a hover drive can be used for light aircraft. Use conveyor drives either when the aircraft is too heavy for hover drives or as afterburners
- For maneuverability (while maintaining decent looks), use wing panels attached to motor 2s. We call this custom control surfaces, or flaps. They're definitely better than cheese grater wings (which is when you make the wing out of the default control surfaces)
- If you're basing it off of a real plane, search up blueprints for them. If it's custom, try to think if it would make sense on an aircraft
**And lastly, tutorials will get downvoted for being unoriginally low-effort**
creations-chat 2021-01-06 12:46:09 Don't forget the delta wings. For the main wing use 1x1 delta wing panels for the leading edge and 1x4 wing panels for the trailing edge, for the tail, use about a single 1x4 delta wing panel (adjust accordingly) for the trailing edge
general 2021-01-06 12:46:59 wait is vungi drawing
general 2021-01-06 12:47:15 show us the elephont
general 2021-01-06 12:47:32 I don't get how people draw to begin with
general 2021-01-06 12:47:57 I have suggestion. Add a bacon to represent the typical Roblox unde
general 2021-01-06 12:48:31 no we do both
general 2021-01-06 12:49:43 <@!403843930543882241> I mean the weeb could just keep buying stuff
general 2021-01-06 12:49:54 Could just keep buying budget stuff
general 2021-01-06 12:50:39 yes but to watch their favorite shows.

just keep watching on a cheap knockoff phone
general 2021-01-06 12:50:45 even if you keep breaking it
general 2021-01-06 12:50:58 they will just get another phone/similar device

general 2021-01-06 13:09:41 It looks like a generic 80s car
general 2021-01-06 13:09:51 I could name other cars such as the Lotus Esprit and the Ferrari F40
general 2021-01-06 13:10:04 There's also the Lamborghini Diablo
general 2021-01-06 13:10:15 Basically every car in the 80s or the early 90s
general 2021-01-06 13:10:28 In that era, they made wedges
general 2021-01-06 13:10:52 A lot of supercars in that era are wedges
general 2021-01-06 13:11:10 detailed wedges
general 2021-01-06 13:11:34 It's not a tank, it looks more like an armored trapezoid
general 2021-01-06 13:11:52 With a weird looking attachment on top
general 2021-01-06 13:12:22 Now that's a detailed wedge
general 2021-01-06 13:12:48 <@!392334096560554001> That "tank" looks like a breadbox

That's not a tank, that's just an armored trapezoid with a weird cannon on top or as I'd like to call it "armed breadbox"
creations-chat 2021-01-06 13:16:36 <@!475239686407847946> https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/796329698606055434 That just looks like a generic 80s sports car/supercar, maybe a bit of early 90s. This is why people don't mix specific models with "mini" unless they manage to add enough details
general 2021-01-06 13:17:10 Pagani Zonda
general 2021-01-06 13:17:52 Fun Fact: The basic design of the Pagani Zonda is really old
general 2021-01-06 13:18:14 The Pagani Zonda's body design if I remember was meant to be "timeless"
general 2021-01-06 13:19:34 so yes quite old, but still good
creations-chat 2021-01-06 13:26:21 I could name some cars right now that'd prove my point
- Ferrari F40
- Lamborghini Diablo
- Ferrari 288 GTO
- Ferrari Testarossa
- Lotus Espirit
- BMW M1
- Pontiac Fiero
general 2021-01-07 01:26:33 I'm cringing a little hearing someone say they don't need suspension even after they kept falling
general 2021-01-07 01:27:31 It seems people nowadays really do love brain death
general 2021-01-07 03:40:28 The F-16 is an agile flying tube with a cockpit and wings
general 2021-01-07 03:41:43 he really is named dr. coomer
general 2021-01-07 03:42:08 Because I do not Half-Life, as much as I want it
general 2021-01-07 03:43:20 I wonder if Gabe intentionally made his name "Coomer"
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 03:58:53 There's a movie about that game
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 03:58:56 Called Wall-E
general 2021-01-07 03:59:48 Apparently I'm friends with them, says Discord.
Discord also says he's in the Python and Bee Swarm Simulator Discord
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:00:19 No it's Wall-E, you have to find last remaining plant to save hue manatee
general 2021-01-07 04:00:42 I don't really know Idra

general 2021-01-07 04:01:56 You could just report it

general 2021-01-07 04:03:57 Let's see if their claim holds up
general 2021-01-07 04:04:11 Actually, you could also try it on an Intel Celeron/Intel Atom

general 2021-01-07 04:08:45 https://browser.geekbench.com/processors/1839 Pretty similar to a Celeron from what it looks
general 2021-01-07 04:09:55 Honestly, why am I even bringing up benchmarks
general 2021-01-07 04:10:23 They're not really what I'd consider a reliable indicator of specs anyways, just helps in giving an idea

general 2021-01-07 13:57:40 Yes, if I remember, it had s p e d and more stealth
general 2021-01-07 13:57:46 It also has the odd diamond wings

plane-crazy 2021-01-08 10:16:46 Are those basically motor treads but with added trapdoors

general 2021-01-08 10:49:42 but technically still a furry, since it is a furry species
general 2021-01-08 10:50:06 to be specific, organic just part robot

Never drown it a food with it
general 2021-01-08 11:43:29 Vegetable juice just sounds horrible in general
general 2021-01-08 11:43:59 I'm fine with eating vegetables, as long as there's other flavors cotrasting it that I like
general 2021-01-08 11:44:36 Well, I'll take your word for it about the carrot juice
general 2021-01-08 11:45:13 To be fair, when I eat vegetables it usually involves having some meat just to make some flavors more bearable
general 2021-01-08 11:45:51 I'm gonna go think up of how many wheels do I need for a tank
general 2021-01-08 11:46:05 And how large do I need those wheels to be
general 2021-01-08 11:46:56 3x3 sounds good for tank wheels, don't they?

general 2021-01-08 12:22:34 I was about to use a piston + suspension hybrid
general 2021-01-08 12:22:42 But hover suspension sounds more promising
general 2021-01-08 12:24:57 I either did something wrong or did something different when I made it move

general 2021-01-09 12:58:47 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet
general 2021-01-09 12:58:54 and then make chenorbyl 2.0
general 2021-01-09 13:38:18 Group B?
general 2021-01-09 13:38:35 How about you use that one Bri'ish car
general 2021-01-09 13:38:38 The MG Metro 6R4
general 2021-01-09 13:39:30 *I was talking about giving you a challenge by using the car that literally only had one win because of how unreliable it is*
general 2021-01-09 13:40:49 If I needed *any* car, a Kia Soul would be fine, but of course I could do better
general 2021-01-09 13:41:05 I'm looking towards Subaru
general 2021-01-09 13:41:38 My family has a Kia Picanto, it's honestly fine
general 2021-01-09 13:41:54 For a small car, doesn't feel as cramped as a Toyota
general 2021-01-09 13:42:09 Well, a Toyota of compareable size
general 2021-01-09 13:42:45 My classmate's Toyota which looks newer has less leg room than the Picanto
general 2021-01-09 13:43:20 The lack of leg room makes it only good for short trips
general 2021-01-09 13:43:57 <@!287779983445721088> Instead of getting a boring old Kia Soul, why not get a Subie
general 2021-01-09 13:43:58 https://s3.caradvice.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2018_subaru_wrx_sti_07.jpg
general 2021-01-09 13:44:51 Toyotas are also good, just need to find one bigger than my classmate's car
general 2021-01-09 13:45:07 ~~Seriously that thing really felt cramped~~
general 2021-01-09 13:45:34 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Third_generation_Toyota_Vios-1-.jpg/1200px-Third_generation_Toyota_Vios-1-.jpg
general 2021-01-09 13:45:37 Probably this
general 2021-01-09 13:45:40 It's a small sedan
general 2021-01-09 13:46:04 Asian market Toyota probably
general 2021-01-09 13:46:22 Let me get a snip from Wikipedia
general 2021-01-09 13:46:57 <@!370594904268734464>
general 2021-01-09 13:48:14 If I actually had my own job, I'd like to have a Subaru or a Toyota
general 2021-01-09 13:49:44 <@!370594904268734464> https://automobile-spec.com/cars/kia-1238.jpeg This is more roomier than a Vios in my experience
general 2021-01-09 13:49:47 This is what my family has
general 2021-01-09 13:50:29 I mean while a sports car is nice, it would be good to also be a bit practical
general 2021-01-09 13:51:51 What are those
general 2021-01-09 13:51:57 That kinda looks nice
general 2021-01-09 13:53:06 very sus
general 2021-01-09 13:53:07 
general 2021-01-09 13:53:33 I got curious and searched up "used Lexus"
general 2021-01-09 13:53:40 And then I see this
general 2021-01-09 13:53:50 Literally only a bunch of thousand dollars
general 2021-01-09 13:54:07 Either something's really wrong with it or it's a scam
general 2021-01-09 13:55:02 Now these sound more reasonable, that's if luxury cars quickly lose value
general 2021-01-09 13:55:23 Let me convert them to US dollars
general 2021-01-09 13:57:20 19,768.42 USD for the Lexus RX
15,606.65 USD for the ES350
20,767.24 for the RX350

<@!415192917012119552> Do those sound reasonable for a decade old luxury cars
general 2021-01-09 13:57:49 Let me convert it to pounds
general 2021-01-09 13:59:02 RX350 = 15,308.87 Pound sterling
ES350 = 11,504.66 Pound sterling
RX = 14,572.57 Pound sterling

<@!536013994188865554> Converted from Philippine Pesos
general 2021-01-09 13:59:09 No, just got curious
general 2021-01-09 13:59:51 <@!415192917012119552> I've heard Lexus cars have good aftermarket parts, yes?
general 2021-01-09 14:00:43 So wait
general 2021-01-09 14:00:57 At that price, does that mean a person could get a decent sport sedan?
general 2021-01-09 14:01:30 Nice.
general 2021-01-09 14:02:40 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Lely-M%C3%A4hdrescher.jpg
general 2021-01-09 14:03:43 When I heard Megahertz, that immediately made me think

***s l o w***
general 2021-01-09 14:03:50 You said vehicles, not cars
general 2021-01-09 14:08:29 In retrospect, it isn't.

I think the most boring would probably be a human powered tricycle
general 2021-01-09 14:09:02 Technically yes, but are we a vehicle
general 2021-01-09 14:09:40 Carry me to school then
general 2021-01-09 14:10:20 So wait, rollerskates with hella big fan?
general 2021-01-09 14:11:30 Going into the realm of the unusual and quirky 

Can an aeromorph/similar be considered a vehicle or a living being
general 2021-01-09 14:12:16 We might as well talk about unusual forms of transport
general 2021-01-09 14:12:59 Yes but which category do they fall into more
general 2021-01-09 14:13:14 Mmm yum
general 2021-01-09 14:13:36 Cheese is aged milk
general 2021-01-09 14:14:01 So by definition, they're like horses, but with human level intelligence
general 2021-01-09 14:14:23 Is that slavery? Or is it labor in the sense of work?
general 2021-01-09 14:14:38 If we use them as transport
general 2021-01-09 14:15:06 Rickshaw
general 2021-01-09 14:15:18 I mean are we paying aircraft?
general 2021-01-09 14:15:28 On the other hand, we are providing maintainance
general 2021-01-09 14:16:01 Yes
general 2021-01-09 14:16:09 I guess theyre kinda like horses
general 2021-01-09 14:16:27 We don't exactly pay them, but aircraft maintainance is a thing
general 2021-01-09 14:16:48 This is some weird thing we're diving in here
general 2021-01-09 14:16:57 Imagine having to take care of a human like a horse
general 2021-01-09 14:17:41 Just brain farts involving aeromorphs
general 2021-01-09 14:18:12 ***DeviantArt user***
general 2021-01-09 14:20:48 On a scale of 1-10, how often do I effectively make people talk weird stuff
general 2021-01-09 14:21:15 Aw :(
general 2021-01-09 14:23:32 Meanwhile I just make the chat talk about really weird stuff, but not with that kind of transition
general 2021-01-09 14:23:39 I admit defeat
general 2021-01-09 14:24:11 Okay
general 2021-01-09 14:24:15 He's even weirder than me
general 2021-01-09 14:24:23 I lost the title of weird
general 2021-01-09 14:24:35 What about idiot/dum-dum
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 14:25:06 Dang thats smooth
general 2021-01-09 14:25:24 Click it
general 2021-01-09 14:25:27 What game is it
general 2021-01-09 14:26:39 Ah yes, dating in Roblox
general 2021-01-09 14:27:12 Let me add some sort of lazy bookmark 

1234567890E
general 2021-01-09 14:28:26 Bricks, man 

They turned him into Wendover's favorite topic
general 2021-01-09 14:29:13 Wait did they seriously add The Third Reich mustache man?
general 2021-01-09 14:30:10 Give me an idea on how to make the chat be in pain
general 2021-01-09 14:30:20 Apart from sending a SFW aeromorph
general 2021-01-09 14:30:38 Because really weird stuff makes people say ***NO***
general 2021-01-09 14:30:53 Like **UwU~**
general 2021-01-09 14:31:14 I know, they just tolerate my existence here

general 2021-01-10 01:06:44 Unneccessary expenses
general 2021-01-10 01:08:59 I mean you still get access to VIP servers
general 2021-01-10 01:09:27 I mean it's pretty neat and clean
general 2021-01-10 01:10:17 You forgot one thing

general 2021-01-10 01:10:53 Oh they're there, just not as visible as the p i n k
general 2021-01-10 01:13:48 Is that some RP thing with that one game
general 2021-01-10 01:14:14 Ah yes the cowboys game
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:17:21 Shredders 

Instant get shamed and downvoted
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:17:43 Don't build them if you want to be a valued member of this server
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:18:32 Shitty quality build, easy to build and can easily shred something
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:18:54 This ain't a kids server
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:19:18 People casually swear here smh
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:20:04 Did you read that light swearing is tolerated
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:20:11 It seems you're the one who didn't read
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:21:27 What implies I got mad?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:21:44 It seems you also don't know that the word "shit" can be casually used
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:22:20 You really need to spend more time on the Internet, you don't know much
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:23:31 -unde <@731810774116204624>
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:23:59 Well, you aren't underaged, you're just blissfully way too innocent
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:24:38 To the point where swears = anger
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:25:26 <@731810774116204624> Go try spending some time in <#497142796961054721> for a few days, you'll see its vastly different from what you'll expect
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:26:11 So basically, 0.28 mass = 1 block
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:26:32 And regardless of size, a single block weights a single block
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:26:44 No matter how much space it occupies
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:26:59 No I mean
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:27:10 1x4 wedge weighs the same as one block
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:27:28 And half wedge weights the same as one block
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:27:52 Well, I mean in weight
general 2021-01-10 01:28:14 I think I've met someone who hasn't been stained by the Internet in <#384021699466756107>
general 2021-01-10 01:28:28 Oh wait they're here
general 2021-01-10 01:28:44 Dry water
general 2021-01-10 01:28:56 Like I'm not mad if I swear
general 2021-01-10 01:29:14 That's literally a casual thing nowadays
general 2021-01-10 01:29:50 My god you really are innocent
general 2021-01-10 01:30:34 Honestly you kinda give off child vibes and I hate it

general 2021-01-10 01:37:28 It won't, Twitter managed to survive in spite of multiple times children/teens got in danger there from adults
general 2021-01-10 01:38:22 The bankruptcy part 

Let's hope not
general 2021-01-10 01:38:57 Didn't they have their local game library

*Including content your eyes would burn to*
general 2021-01-10 01:55:49 yes I actually view furry content you'd get traumatized to, or at least question
general 2021-01-10 02:30:50 I wonder how rack and pinion steering works in PC
general 2021-01-10 02:36:24 https://streamable.com/yt8tg7 I started with something simple, but this won't do in the long term if I need suspension
general 2021-01-10 03:08:29 ok i don't know how to do rack and pinion
general 2021-01-10 03:10:31 I'll just stick with the regular motor 2 setup

general 2021-01-10 03:17:45 Just a random thought but what is in your subjective opinion the most useful block in Plane Crazy
general 2021-01-10 03:19:08 What about excluding regular building blocks (wedges, half blocks, etc.) and the seats
general 2021-01-10 03:19:24 for me it's your dad
general 2021-01-10 03:19:31 he <:largerabbit:772883550349426719>

general 2021-01-10 03:34:52 Does Roblox have any rally racing games?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:36:27 What did you use to draw that
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:36:35 ~~unless you just scanned that~~
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:37:19 The explosives?
general 2021-01-10 03:37:58 It doesn't have any actual tracks
general 2021-01-10 03:38:25 No not that kind of track
general 2021-01-10 03:38:28 I mean race tracks
general 2021-01-10 03:38:46 Airport too tiny
general 2021-01-10 03:39:45 ok but apart from pc, anything else
general 2021-01-10 03:40:59 What the hell is Tomorrow Tides?
general 2021-01-10 03:41:27 I mean, the name itself is already sus
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:41:58 So scanned it
general 2021-01-10 03:42:41 <@!738702049113538600> Jokes aside, if Plane Crazy had an actual track I might consider it a rally racing game
general 2021-01-10 03:43:07 I'd like people to make Group B out of the new map
general 2021-01-10 03:43:30 Yes
general 2021-01-10 03:43:37 Or at least something in the spirit of Group B
general 2021-01-10 03:43:47 Where any form of limitations just gets thrown out of the window

general 2021-01-10 03:46:17 look at the road, then look at the car
general 2021-01-10 03:46:25 then realize how dangerously close to tipping over that is
general 2021-01-10 03:46:44 group b?

It's a mess
general 2021-01-10 06:26:06 what is this
general 2021-01-10 06:28:29 I left
general 2021-01-10 06:28:33 I have no idea what's happening
general 2021-01-10 06:28:39 So I just go back to suspension
general 2021-01-10 06:29:02 so the land of sosigs has rising gdp
general 2021-01-10 06:30:33 rising gdp you say? in sosig land

general 2021-01-10 06:37:04 I thought it involved first person camera
general 2021-01-10 06:37:24 because avatar always follow first person camera
general 2021-01-10 06:37:43 back to rack and pininon instead procrastinating
general 2021-01-10 06:37:48 which <#497142796961054721> is good at
general 2021-01-10 06:40:06 ok i meant just steering axle
general 2021-01-10 06:40:12 instead of basic motor 2 steering
general 2021-01-10 06:41:11 no i am in public
general 2021-01-10 06:41:14 because laziness
general 2021-01-10 06:41:36 same
general 2021-01-10 06:41:49 but no furry avatar
general 2021-01-10 06:42:42 well i have to go after anyways
general 2021-01-10 06:42:43 so later
general 2021-01-10 06:43:28 ew
general 2021-01-10 06:43:40 how about i make chat ew further
general 2021-01-10 06:43:48 **O w O**
there
general 2021-01-10 07:32:21 must be damn good if he can do that
general 2021-01-10 07:32:30 anyways what happened while i was gone
general 2021-01-10 07:32:39 me
general 2021-01-10 07:32:49 yes
general 2021-01-10 07:33:01 if I proclaim that I am furry
then I am furry
general 2021-01-10 07:33:11 no you don't
general 2021-01-10 07:33:20 and I decide to be a furry
general 2021-01-10 07:42:17 https://streamable.com/omz6p7 well, here's a start, but this is crappy steering
general 2021-01-10 07:42:36 I need to make a better steering axle
general 2021-01-10 07:50:21 ah yes

the unobtainable ranks
general 2021-01-10 07:50:33 I kinda wanna give up on the steering axle
general 2021-01-10 07:50:40 Because it keeps shaking it's ass off
general 2021-01-10 07:51:07 how do you people make steering axles not have msucle spasms
general 2021-01-10 07:51:41 oh wait i said it wrong

how do i make steering rack not have the seizures
general 2021-01-10 07:52:28 I'm poob, so I start by doing basic poob steering rack
general 2021-01-10 07:53:01 do I join your weird club again
general 2021-01-10 07:53:06 or do I not join the weird club
general 2021-01-10 07:53:19 I mean to be fair, I have zero experience with steering axles
general 2021-01-10 07:53:53 The most I can do is not a steering rack, instead basic motor 2 steering
general 2021-01-10 07:55:39 https://streamable.com/9beci8 I might just go back to regular motor 2 steering for the time being
general 2021-01-10 07:56:27 no this is my car
general 2021-01-10 07:57:08 yes

but it go s p r o i n g

but I'm gonna replace pistons with hover thrusters
general 2021-01-10 07:57:18 haha funni number
general 2021-01-10 07:57:52 isn't that pretty much every suspension
general 2021-01-10 07:58:07 lots of motors
general 2021-01-10 07:59:11 where does this come from
general 2021-01-10 07:59:21 and i am big bored again
general 2021-01-10 07:59:43 I speak in the language of braindead
general 2021-01-10 08:00:48 Okay I need something else to do
general 2021-01-10 08:01:03 no
general 2021-01-10 08:01:14 best
general 2021-01-10 08:01:16 buy best
general 2021-01-10 08:04:38 
general 2021-01-10 08:04:39 my eyes
general 2021-01-10 08:10:34 yer mootha is a furryweeb
general 2021-01-10 08:12:01 the umm that fuckin ummm uhhh

general 2021-01-10 08:16:00 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island_(series) They have been hiding the goods from us
general 2021-01-10 08:17:05 what's the advantages of thin vs. thick wheels in plane crazy
general 2021-01-10 08:17:31 which one, thin or thick
general 2021-01-10 08:17:34 which has more grip
general 2021-01-10 08:17:47 so I go for t h i c c then
general 2021-01-10 08:18:12 ok one block then
general 2021-01-10 08:18:16 not 0.5
general 2021-01-10 08:18:18 just 1 block
general 2021-01-10 08:18:49 I wonder how wide trucks get
general 2021-01-10 08:19:24 well, the body of the truck in general
general 2021-01-10 08:20:51 that means I have to make either larger custom wheels or w i d e trucc
general 2021-01-10 08:21:14 
general 2021-01-10 08:22:15 I too will commit that crime

general 2021-01-10 10:35:16 train go bounce
general 2021-01-10 10:35:32 so japan?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 10:35:59 less volume, and more f l a t
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 10:36:12 How much time did you spend on that
general 2021-01-10 10:37:16 so ducks are essentially "all-terrain"

in the sense that they fly, can move on the ground and can float on water
general 2021-01-10 10:37:30 or whatever bird you people are talking about
general 2021-01-10 10:37:49 That's a pretty subjective thing
general 2021-01-10 10:40:43 Honestly I can only think up of two
- Rock crawling, but that requires a Jeep or similar off-road vehicle
- Some local race tracks/similar races with low-cost entry
general 2021-01-10 10:41:31 Cars can't go everywhere

They aren't ships, nor are they aircraft
general 2021-01-10 10:41:45 The problem is, I don't expect a car to go to a mountain as quick as a helicopter
general 2021-01-10 10:41:59 Or a car to be capable of sea transport at all
general 2021-01-10 10:42:32 And if they don't follow the road, well it's gonna be limited since cars have their own limits
general 2021-01-10 10:43:29 Train is meant to be public transport
general 2021-01-10 10:43:43 Like sure you can build tracks everywhere but what's the point
general 2021-01-10 10:44:22 100 million is overpriced for a train imo
general 2021-01-10 10:44:37 That sounds more reasonable, though I underestimated it
general 2021-01-10 10:47:26 I'll embrace the train, but that doesn't mean I won't stop liking cars
general 2021-01-10 10:47:37 oops i meant htat for someone else
general 2021-01-10 10:49:04 That's just dumb. He should also know that not everyone's gonna travel to an obscure place anyways, people just need to travel to point A to B effectively, and a well designed train serves that quite well
general 2021-01-10 10:50:23 I'm too lazy for that
general 2021-01-10 10:50:31 Big builds make me lazy
general 2021-01-10 10:51:32 Anyways, let's change the topic to maps.
general 2021-01-10 10:52:02 What kind of stuff should the next map have
general 2021-01-10 10:55:09 Here's what I want for new PC map

- Volcano instead of lava lake, more natural and I like the idea of a hydrothermally powered Innovation Inc. base
- Larger and deeper water of course, and rivers so smaller ships can fare better
- Revamped surroundings, so tanks and suspension vehicles will have a bit more fun
- An improved airport, because have you seen the sizes airliners go?
- Better railroads, because the current one sucks. Only goes from Base to Airport and then back
general 2021-01-10 10:57:26 Roads.

I mean there's trains.
general 2021-01-10 10:58:19 It's up to whoever's making the map to whether add it or not
general 2021-01-10 10:59:34 looks nice and something people could agree on
general 2021-01-10 11:03:07 Can we agree this should be the next Plane Crazy map
general 2021-01-10 11:03:55 Nah let's go for the Super Mario 64 route

***s p r i t e s***
general 2021-01-10 11:05:27 Flat, but not ideal for suspension, which might bring up some complaints
general 2021-01-10 11:05:43 oh good
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 11:06:37 <@!738702049113538600> do i use this for rear suspension
general 2021-01-10 11:08:32 What if we just made one hella big map like Forza scale
general 2021-01-10 11:09:16 yes
and more optimizations, and plane crazy map is tiny compared to prison game maps
general 2021-01-10 11:16:15 I mean we don't drown
general 2021-01-10 11:16:33 Nor does the game have realistic physics and stuff to begin with
general 2021-01-10 11:16:40 Rickje and his bobux pile
general 2021-01-10 11:16:52 Undes will definitely pay for features
general 2021-01-10 11:18:43 In **P**lane **C**razy **C**razy, how would it know the difference between a submarine in space and a rocket in water
general 2021-01-10 11:19:27 (Definitely not Plane Crazy Community, as I noticed from Dark)
general 2021-01-10 11:20:27 If we wanted a realistic game, we might as well mod Kerbal Space Program at that point
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 11:25:25 When has Plane Crazy ever went for compacc
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 11:25:45 ~~unless you deliberately made a compact build~~
general 2021-01-10 11:27:02 What if Plane Crazy had terminal velocity and inertia
general 2021-01-10 11:27:33 But *what if*
general 2021-01-10 11:28:15 Terminal velocity

Yeah that doesn't exist if my avatar constantly accelerates even at speeds of up to almost 20k
general 2021-01-10 11:29:17 I should make bigger wheels for this thing
general 2021-01-10 11:30:41 I was about to make them 7x7
general 2021-01-10 11:30:50 But I guess I'll just stick with default cylinder wheels
general 2021-01-10 11:31:52 I mean we can't drown, we can burn our legs off and we somehow can make a conveyor make us fly, not only that but motor locking exists which could generate a black hole from how dense a given amount of volume is
general 2021-01-10 11:32:53 I mean if you wanted something more realistic you might as well get a modded version of Kerbal Space Program

general 2021-01-10 11:33:36 Kia
general 2021-01-10 11:34:31 Why even complain when the game wasn't meant to be hyperrealistic
general 2021-01-10 11:36:04 Besides what Roblox kids would play a game that's too realistic
general 2021-01-10 11:37:10 Ask Minecraft
general 2021-01-10 11:37:19 yes
general 2021-01-10 11:39:02 Just enjoy the game, at this rate you might as well complain that every sandbox game isn't realistic enough
general 2021-01-10 11:40:44 Hmm, I wonder what happened during that "Club Iris Furry Event" planecrazytanks and gman participated in
general 2021-01-10 11:41:38 A few hours ago, they were on Club Iris, something about Furries
general 2021-01-10 11:51:08 I got curious

Apparently the furry audience on Roblox is big enough to warrant their own videos
general 2021-01-10 11:52:08 Rope engine

Show us a demonstration of said engine
general 2021-01-10 12:03:01 Vilde, may I send you something in DMs
general 2021-01-10 12:04:02 guess what I sent Vilde
general 2021-01-10 12:04:41 
general 2021-01-10 12:06:41 This is what I sent to obc

What's next
general 2021-01-10 12:07:21 I need another mod though
general 2021-01-10 12:07:29 I gotta do one per mod
general 2021-01-10 12:07:51 Because I barely have a sense of humor
general 2021-01-10 12:08:23 I know what to send to Pepsima
general 2021-01-10 12:13:19 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdackF2H7Qc&pbjreload=101 I sent this to Pepsiman, who's next
general 2021-01-10 12:16:21 Get a demilitarized Flanker for rent
general 2021-01-10 12:17:33 OwO furry dragon here
general 2021-01-10 12:18:39 but that's normal
general 2021-01-10 12:18:44 for you to say owo isn't
general 2021-01-10 12:19:23 for me I don't
general 2021-01-10 12:21:18 yes and we test bombs there
general 2021-01-10 12:21:49 I'll go customize Windows
general 2021-01-11 01:36:11 Isn't that pretty much every suggestion where it involves adding a feature into a game
general 2021-01-11 01:36:26 Since it requires that rick himself views it
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 01:36:48 https://streamable.com/u2f4lu suspension feels light
general 2021-01-11 03:36:01 I mean you're wasting time replying to me
No point in writing an essay in <#497142796961054721> when half of the time it's braindead
general 2021-01-11 03:37:23 Still pointless unless there's an argument
general 2021-01-11 03:37:42 I mean who casually just writes an essay in here of all places
general 2021-01-11 03:38:37 Well I guess when you people make essays I'm usually asleep by then
general 2021-01-11 03:40:07 I thought K-Pop is a product of Korean capitalism
general 2021-01-11 03:40:29 oh yeah
general 2021-01-11 03:40:33 I mean South Korean capitalism
general 2021-01-11 03:40:51 No I just had a mental lapse
general 2021-01-11 03:40:56 and forgot to add South
general 2021-01-11 03:41:49 I wonder if N. Korea had any Covid cases

*Probably not considering how isolated they are*
general 2021-01-11 03:43:44 Well it'd probably even more chaos
general 2021-01-11 04:04:11 I tried replacing the custom wheels of my suspension with 5x5 fabric cylinders

It became unstable
general 2021-01-11 04:04:44 Or maybe I just didn't anticipate the gains
general 2021-01-11 04:05:17 Okay maybe I didn't anticipate the gains, on the flat area near the rails it went 300
general 2021-01-11 04:07:13 What do they have now?
general 2021-01-11 04:07:34 What is this horrific thing
general 2021-01-11 04:07:45 It violates all known laws of aviation
general 2021-01-11 04:08:32 Because the wording's pretty similar

Something about all known laws of aviation saying bees shouldn't fly
general 2021-01-11 04:09:05 That is relative, but yes that is pretty simple compared to the stuff people have done
general 2021-01-11 04:09:21 I have an even simpler plane
general 2021-01-11 04:10:05 For mine it's 50/50 works perfectly fine or there's some flaws that prevent it from being seriously used
general 2021-01-11 04:12:22 If I can build this, even someone like you can build a somewhat decent plane

*And I'm known for making ugly planes*
general 2021-01-11 04:13:18 Ugly, but I made people overreact for some "supersonic Cobra" maneuver
general 2021-01-11 04:14:10 https://streamable.com/qd2buw I mean this is pretty normal
general 2021-01-11 04:15:31 Here's advice
Supersonic wings = forms a triangle. Subsonic wings = more straight
general 2021-01-11 04:15:52 yes it is shit
general 2021-01-11 04:16:09 I am not your cushion
general 2021-01-11 04:16:36 it smells like ass
general 2021-01-11 04:16:43 it smells bad
general 2021-01-11 04:17:10 it's pretty shitty and it's crushing all of my bones
general 2021-01-11 04:17:56 I forgot

general 2021-01-11 04:22:37 Here's a saying I should follow ~~that's definitely not a spongebob quote~~
general 2021-01-11 04:22:43 "I'm ugly and I'm proud"
general 2021-01-11 04:23:41 WAIT
general 2021-01-11 04:23:44 I just realized the context

general 2021-01-11 04:35:58 The ball guy
general 2021-01-11 04:36:05 Or maybe Dark
general 2021-01-11 04:36:21 That Germany ball guy
general 2021-01-11 04:52:39 Looks like game code
general 2021-01-11 04:54:09 What's that, the stuff you have to study?
general 2021-01-11 04:54:37 Like I just came back to see listing some subjects
general 2021-01-11 04:55:15 Either that's a lot or over here we categorize stuff like Physics goes onto a Science subject
general 2021-01-11 04:58:09 I thought it was 75
general 2021-01-11 04:58:10 oh
general 2021-01-11 04:58:37 Here it's 75, but even then that means you've barely passed and you're a failure
general 2021-01-11 04:58:49 80+ is just average, nothing special
general 2021-01-11 04:58:54 90 means you're smort
general 2021-01-11 05:09:10 I have a picture of obc

general 2021-01-11 05:11:09 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2021-01-11 05:11:20 I'm honestly fine with pineapples
general 2021-01-11 05:11:32 Like they're not that bad
general 2021-01-11 05:11:59 I don't really like vegetables raw anyways
general 2021-01-11 05:12:42 ┬_┬ ノ( ゜-゜ノ) -(guys the table broke)
general 2021-01-11 05:13:53 what is that btw
general 2021-01-11 05:15:52 <@!536013994188865554> Hmm, what's your opinion of Famitracker
general 2021-01-11 05:18:07 https://www.youtube.com/user/ThePotatoWhisperer well here's a neat little channel
general 2021-01-11 05:19:25 no just use unpowered motor
general 2021-01-11 05:19:30 make solid axle suspension
general 2021-01-11 05:20:02 you see
you're the one who is wooooshed
general 2021-01-11 05:20:57 i also tried suspension
general 2021-01-11 05:22:00 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/794166405787418625 simple but does the job
general 2021-01-11 05:22:36 something looks off about that
general 2021-01-11 05:24:23 what's behind the building 👀
general 2021-01-11 05:24:37 how and why
general 2021-01-11 05:24:44 actually just why
general 2021-01-11 05:25:02 why big
general 2021-01-11 05:25:45 why is there a giant clotheless man behind the building
general 2021-01-11 05:26:49 how what? I don't get it
general 2021-01-11 05:27:14 no that's a shaved lex luthor
general 2021-01-11 05:28:24 I heard Twitch is bringing back pog, but new face every 24 hours
general 2021-01-11 05:29:44 i have absolutely no idea what pctanks is doing
general 2021-01-11 05:45:56 It's a man with grandma hair
general 2021-01-11 05:47:46 two cars
general 2021-01-11 05:47:50 now lock it
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:17:15 Is there such a thing as too much speed in suspension
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:17:30 Is 300 too much?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:17:44 Then I need to make better suspension then
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:18:25 Land vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:18:49 Though to be fair it had the assist of a *single* super rocket
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:19:44 "I built the fastest plane"

Let me guess, it goes 100
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:20:09 You said 300 is thrice faster than his so
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:20:29 I casually fly around 1000 sps
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:20:45 I could achieve 10,000 sps if I wanted to
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:21:17 I use custom engines for that, I use  conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:21:41 To be fair

There are hella dumb furries
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:22:25 Ugly
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:23:23 
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:23:28 I probably won't end up using this
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:23:43 It's nice but tank treads are gimmicky for me
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:24:03 I just took a look at Guggi's treads
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:24:11 He used trapdoors
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:25:50 If I ever made a tank, I'll just use wheels
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:26:17 The lag is unbearable
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:27:57 I made a tank have a tantrum
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:28:43 I got lazy to play Plane Crazy
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 13:28:52 I've gone casual

general 2021-01-11 13:44:41 I don't know why, but it happened
general 2021-01-11 13:45:10 The only good games on the MS Store are those that already exist on Xbox or are related to some good IPs like Lego
general 2021-01-11 13:46:26 Not much, some niche customization stuff
general 2021-01-11 13:49:07 I just wish there's an option for rounded corners
general 2021-01-11 13:49:42 Windows with some customization

general 2021-01-11 13:52:58 I used Nexus Dock and Rainmeter mostly
general 2021-01-11 13:53:23 Apps, you'll have to find that on your own to match your **a e s t h e t i c**
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 01:25:45 Added spoilers onto the car, helped to keep the car planted onto the ground at the cost of the suspension
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 01:26:22 Still keeping the pistons for now as it handled the weight of the ballasts
general 2021-01-12 01:27:43 What kind of hell am I seeing here
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:52:41 https://streamable.com/rjokfy Either something went wrong or something went too well
general 2021-01-12 03:56:22 I think I may have messed up with suspension

general 2021-01-12 03:57:50 Oh, it's a Chrome only extension
general 2021-01-12 03:58:57 Yes because they're Chromium based
general 2021-01-12 03:59:10 Firefox on the other hand, isn't
general 2021-01-12 04:00:27

plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:04:37 *proceeds to use conveyor drives*
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:04:40 That's way too easy
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:05:24 And if it's features becoming exclusively paid, well the community isn't gonna like EA Rick

plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:10:44 Imagine banning people for wanting to make use of their monitors
general 2021-01-12 04:11:25 Should probably adjust that later, after classes

plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:27:36 And got this
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:28:13 Suspension, two hover thrusters opposing each other, then rope
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:28:16 In that order, sideways
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:28:31 Then I stack them to make that zero gravity thing

the multiplayer one, not the original singleplayer series
general 2021-01-12 09:24:09 https://store.steampowered.com/app/444640/Bloons_TD_Battles/ I was thinking of this
general 2021-01-12 09:24:15 The one where it's exclusively multiplayer
general 2021-01-12 09:25:00 All I do is to just adjust the wings and don't give a crap about the center of lift
general 2021-01-12 09:25:27 I wonder what even is his plane

general 2021-01-12 09:25:51 w a t
general 2021-01-12 09:26:15 I mean change/add/remove the location of wings
general 2021-01-12 09:26:23 Why would I raise the wings that's not gonna do much
general 2021-01-12 09:26:51 Like if I'm pitching down, I usually add more wings at the front or use artificial stability
general 2021-01-12 09:27:41 FutureScience is the guy who I immediately think of for that
general 2021-01-12 09:28:44 In real life, they're either called lifting bodies or flying wings
general 2021-01-12 09:29:01 They're distinct in that with lifting bodies, the body generates lift while with flying wings, the entire aircraft is a wing
general 2021-01-12 14:11:50 Is it just me or is there a slow but gradual increase of furries in the PCC
general 2021-01-12 14:12:18 Like for real, I'm noticing it

general 2021-01-13 12:47:27 Nice Chevy (Bel Air)
general 2021-01-13 12:48:25 Imagine if we could scale our builds
general 2021-01-13 12:48:46 Like we can make our builds bigger or smaller, but the player stays the same
general 2021-01-13 12:48:56 And the details remain
general 2021-01-13 12:49:43 Plane Crazy 2022: Build Scaling
general 2021-01-13 12:49:58 I just realized something with that idea
general 2021-01-13 12:50:16 If we could manage to pick up our scaled down builds, we could potentially make actual guns
general 2021-01-13 12:51:01 But at that point that wouldn't be Plane Crazy, more like Build Crazy
general 2021-01-13 12:51:32 It'd be the equivalent of taking the seat of a toy car, and then sitting on it
general 2021-01-13 12:51:50 Micro seat traps

That's horrible, but build scaling is still pretty nice
general 2021-01-13 12:52:03 On the other hand, adjustable seats
general 2021-01-13 12:52:59 Plane Crazy with build scaling

Now with realistic cars with realistic suspension, doors and other car features
general 2021-01-13 12:53:22 Aircraft that actually looks pretty close to their real life counterparts
general 2021-01-13 12:53:55 But without the motor locking
general 2021-01-13 12:54:00 Or reduced at least
general 2021-01-13 12:55:14 <@!621817208313479248> What happens if we make a helmet but it's made out of ballasts, and then make someone wear it
general 2021-01-13 12:55:20 Would it crush the avatar and make it spasm?
general 2021-01-13 12:55:37 That sounds like a neat unde trap
general 2021-01-13 12:55:52 Just placing down a really heavy object that looks small and then death
general 2021-01-13 12:56:18 He told me about it
general 2021-01-13 12:56:21 The teleporter
general 2021-01-13 12:56:41 That's what he told me it is
general 2021-01-13 12:57:30 What if RC Crazy
general 2021-01-13 12:57:34 With mini planes
general 2021-01-13 12:57:35 And stuff
general 2021-01-13 12:57:53 Let's make it a suggestion to make build scaling
general 2021-01-13 12:58:33 He can't find the original PFP
general 2021-01-13 12:58:40 PRobably
general 2021-01-13 12:58:49 I assume
general 2021-01-13 12:59:12 Is there?
general 2021-01-13 12:59:50 The fog

I don't want the fog
general 2021-01-13 12:59:54 Or the snowflakes
general 2021-01-13 13:00:13 Maple's Chinese?
general 2021-01-13 13:02:10 Will you get mad if I make a pun?
general 2021-01-13 13:02:23 https://i.redd.it/hqviq2win9p21.png
general 2021-01-13 13:04:36 basically

body go brrrr
general 2021-01-13 13:04:45 cold but no sno
general 2021-01-13 13:05:25 Simple
general 2021-01-13 13:05:35 They're Chinese but in Malaysia
general 2021-01-13 13:05:57 Or maybe I interpreted that wrong, which in that case ignore
general 2021-01-13 13:06:20 I gotta make a logo for Math project
general 2021-01-13 13:06:23 That requires a circle
general 2021-01-13 13:06:37 brain go boeing
general 2021-01-13 13:06:58 but it must be original
general 2021-01-13 13:07:02 https://www.aerotime.aero/aviation-blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Boeing-Logo.svg.png
general 2021-01-13 13:07:06 so no b o i n g
general 2021-01-13 13:07:51 which is
general 2021-01-13 13:08:50 i searched it up
general 2021-01-13 13:08:59 and I see it is indeed MD

general 2021-01-13 13:09:18 I guess Boeing liked it
general 2021-01-13 13:09:33 I need ideas for logos
general 2021-01-13 13:12:30 I mean, it is aerospace
general 2021-01-13 13:16:12 Google uses Oxford, right
general 2021-01-13 13:17:06 
general 2021-01-13 13:17:49 https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/15007/state-vs-country-as-nation Have these pros from the Stack Exchange

general 2021-01-14 00:26:34 Are toes fingers?
general 2021-01-14 00:27:43 What if sign language
general 2021-01-14 00:27:46 But with feet
general 2021-01-14 00:28:52 I drank m o m
general 2021-01-14 00:29:10 Your mom tastes good as a liquid

general 2021-01-14 00:30:36 No it's male and "fee" malw
general 2021-01-14 00:30:44 Whatever the hell fee is
general 2021-01-14 00:32:06 It smells like disappointment
general 2021-01-14 00:33:05 What if 😳 simulator
general 2021-01-14 00:33:17 yes
general 2021-01-14 00:34:15 What if delta wing, but instead of undes doing trapezoidal they actually make it a delta
general 2021-01-14 00:35:10 It looks like a ship that's meant to be sunk
general 2021-01-14 00:36:23 Undes, people who make trapezoidal wings, double deltas/cranked arrows like the Saab Draken
general 2021-01-14 00:36:46 I'm on mobile
general 2021-01-14 00:36:53 So wait a second
general 2021-01-14 00:38:57 <@363742162757877761>
general 2021-01-14 00:39:18 Saab Draken and F-16 XL
general 2021-01-14 00:40:19 I mean, the wing could carry both elevators and ailerons
general 2021-01-14 00:40:31 Such as one famous French aircraft
general 2021-01-14 00:41:15 Wouldn't last long
general 2021-01-14 00:41:42 I mean you're already going super sonic, and the blades are going faster
general 2021-01-14 00:43:05 I usually color my builds
general 2021-01-14 00:43:16 So I know what's definitely not there
general 2021-01-14 00:45:07 "Newbie"

Is that where the cringe term noobie came from
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 01:21:25 Would 312 considered be a decent speed for suspension builds
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 01:22:42 At least on a flat drag strip like the spawn area
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 01:25:16 https://streamable.com/9kdpe4 Is this decent
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 01:36:23 what's pog?
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 03:45:10 Because I can
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 03:46:16 I might consider doing it more
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 03:47:36 I was asking about speed
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 03:47:54 I could've done a separate video about the actual off-roading
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 03:56:29 <@!738702049113538600> fine have throttled video https://streamable.com/ohbvu3
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 04:01:46 https://drawingdatabase.com/mcdonnell-douglas-fa-18-hornet/ I found this
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 04:02:14 That's a normal thing here, otherwise how do you expect people to make accurate representations of aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 04:02:49 What's that?
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 04:03:37 Everything looks good so far
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 04:04:19 Here's a simplified blueprint for comparison https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/f18a-2.gif
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 04:05:17 Though still, you got everything correct so far
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 04:08:04 Closely spaced engines, trapezoidal wings, swept elevators, the leading edge is for the most part correct, and the body in general
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 04:09:20 Motors are naturally unstable
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 04:14:25 I mean it's a turret
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 04:14:33 Which honestly, is a common PvP thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 04:14:57 And I can't really see anything that stands out with it
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 04:17:09 Exactly, it's honestly very ordinary
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 04:22:00 Text has welding but no collision, so with some creative motor locking you can make a custom front landing gear
general 2021-01-14 04:34:34 I gotta play this later
general 2021-01-14 04:35:17 why you don't craze plane anymore
general 2021-01-14 04:44:01 I thought you said Note 7
general 2021-01-14 04:44:05 The phone that go boom

general 2021-01-14 05:18:52 The coconut is a big brown hairy milky bowling ball
general 2021-01-14 05:19:01 I will adapt to rbk
general 2021-01-14 05:19:30 I tried foods with coconut stuff in them

general 2021-01-14 05:30:04 Thus people would fear what reminds them of disease
general 2021-01-14 05:30:38 What if I told you

There are people who are unironically into feet
general 2021-01-14 05:32:57 says the guy who goes uwu
general 2021-01-14 05:33:36 The fact that those are googly eyes make it less creepy and more oddly funny due to how ridiculous it is

general 2021-01-14 07:12:13 How easy are tip-jet helicopters
general 2021-01-14 07:13:41 making things fly without wings
general 2021-01-14 07:15:32 What if we can scale builds

So cars can became highly detailed and realistically sized (perhaps even in function, given decent suspensions and usage of motors) and other stuff like giving planes better scale/details
general 2021-01-14 07:16:31 Could imagine as soon as it loads, it shrinks (or grows, for ship and submarine builders, and airliners)
general 2021-01-14 07:16:50 But with scaling, less lag
general 2021-01-14 07:17:43 Assuming you have a decent, recent PC
general 2021-01-14 07:17:57 I have a computer with 2014 low to mid-end parts

general 2021-01-14 11:39:22 What's the best way to troll undes
general 2021-01-14 11:39:46 Wtihout having to involve in arguments
general 2021-01-14 11:40:10 Since their logic is more flawed than Apple's innovations
general 2021-01-14 11:40:29 I think I'll just build a big big beautiful wall
general 2021-01-14 11:40:57 And then trap them in their plots
general 2021-01-14 11:42:40 I think I'll do a wall

general 2021-01-14 11:46:26 Our dad is Rickje
general 2021-01-14 11:46:32 And our mother is Madattak
general 2021-01-14 11:46:48 But with Pepsi being the mother, therefore, that makes rickje and madattak our grandparents
general 2021-01-14 11:46:52 Or great grandparents
general 2021-01-14 11:47:36 Our uncle is Batman

general 2021-01-14 11:57:40 so typical clout chaser?
general 2021-01-14 12:11:37 Programming can also be a hobby
general 2021-01-14 12:11:49 Or just simply building websites
general 2021-01-14 12:13:01 If they do consider it though, I recommend something simple like Python and Visual Studio Code or Notepad++
general 2021-01-14 12:13:46 Oh, I use VS Code for the writing part
general 2021-01-14 12:14:25 Speaking of stuff like the BBC Microbit, what about an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi?
general 2021-01-14 12:15:32 https://www.raspberrypi.org/pi-zero-w/ I found this
general 2021-01-14 12:16:42 yes
general 2021-01-14 12:17:25 basically very smol computer, and you can take it a step further with this
https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/
general 2021-01-14 12:17:54 I told them they can take it a step further with a Pi 400
general 2021-01-14 12:18:01 Where it's basically a glorified Commodore 64
general 2021-01-14 12:18:29 https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sP8KYWYE6JU/hqdefault.jpg
general 2021-01-14 12:18:32 This is a Commodore 64
general 2021-01-14 12:19:12 I mean there's tons of tutorials, and they make it don't look so hard to setup
general 2021-01-14 12:20:03 https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en
general 2021-01-14 12:21:05 I tried Lua, but I decided to go with Python since it had better documentation for me
general 2021-01-14 12:22:08 I mean it is again, a miniaturized computer at heart, of course you can do more with it. Some even make servers out of them
general 2021-01-14 12:23:07 I've asked some people to set myself a road map for what I'm gonna learn
general 2021-01-14 12:23:31 So I've set on Python and maybe refining what my school taught me about HTML/CSS and then add Javascript on top
general 2021-01-14 12:24:03 And eventually move onto C-family language later on once I get a decent understanding
general 2021-01-14 12:24:19 I mean I do have poob brain
general 2021-01-14 12:25:27 <@!260797229068058634> Well, what do you suggest as a middle ground between me trying out Python, Javascript and markup languages and a C-family language
general 2021-01-14 12:26:09 So Lua then after that jump ahead to C++
general 2021-01-14 12:26:45 Aight then, well I am gonna do this gradually so I don't overwork myself
general 2021-01-14 12:27:20 Aeromorphs exist, remember
general 2021-01-14 12:27:57 <@456226577798135808> Just try out something simple at first, so you can get the hang of things
general 2021-01-14 12:29:27 That's fine, you just do what makes you happy
general 2021-01-14 12:30:01 https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html I'm still going through this, *slowly*
general 2021-01-14 12:30:27 oh hi real lizard man
general 2021-01-14 12:30:48 welcome back
general 2021-01-14 12:30:57 to crazy plane
general 2021-01-14 12:31:54 no
it's create a flying machine that somehow defies the understanding of a child's brain
general 2021-01-14 12:32:45 What are your numbers so we can get the mean
general 2021-01-14 12:33:54 ah yes.

if you want havoc try hot furry pfp
general 2021-01-14 12:34:07 that'll surely mess with people
general 2021-01-14 12:34:23 If you're serious about that there is a site I know where you can burn your retinas out
general 2021-01-14 12:35:01 Here's your clue, sugar

general 2021-01-14 12:45:34 I'll ggo join my sibling in an Innovation Inc game
general 2021-01-14 12:45:54 Because it's Innovation Inc.
general 2021-01-14 12:48:04 I told him to use that one
general 2021-01-14 12:48:16 Because femboi furry creates more havoc
general 2021-01-14 12:48:27 and I decided to go for the one that leans more to that
general 2021-01-14 12:49:06 why yes it's a thing
general 2021-01-14 12:54:13 no need for anime
when we have mitsubishi fighter jets

general 2021-01-14 13:04:04 What, they wanted havoc
general 2021-01-14 13:04:37 who else wants to cause havoc without effort

general 2021-01-14 13:15:44 are you now?
general 2021-01-14 13:23:21 "If it doesn't explode, it isn't ours"
general 2021-01-14 13:25:11 Don't you mind pre-Covid internet
general 2021-01-14 13:27:33 Find if Shinji is in other servers
general 2021-01-14 13:28:10 Shinji#9680
general 2021-01-14 13:31:10 ah yes our rival
general 2021-01-14 13:31:37 I remember when we raided Pinewood Computer Core
general 2021-01-14 13:37:13 Ah yes, work in progresses

the-dump 2021-01-14 22:30:02 Now I download poster
general 2021-01-14 22:31:02 I read once that apparently madattak was once a part of Pinewood?
general 2021-01-14 22:31:20 Before leaving to focus on Innovation Inc?
general 2021-01-14 22:31:47 So if green
general 2021-01-14 22:32:14 Remove gman
general 2021-01-14 22:32:16 He's green
general 2021-01-14 22:33:46 I am a background person
general 2021-01-14 22:35:06 General is where the braindead children of Rick play and fight
general 2021-01-14 22:37:05 Do what I do, drink Innovation fuel
general 2021-01-14 22:37:53 Why don't you try looking at Blackbird's PFP
general 2021-01-14 22:38:40 Exactly 

You wouldn't expect him to do that
general 2021-01-14 22:39:16 There's still a furry here
general 2021-01-14 22:39:53 You're talking to one
general 2021-01-14 22:40:29 Your mom's an F-15 afterburner
general 2021-01-14 22:41:17 That one game where you dig holes so they can go down a pipe so a crocodile can take a bath
general 2021-01-14 22:43:07 I heard Vungi finds furries less annoying than weebs 

When he said day partially saved
general 2021-01-14 22:44:21 Ah yes ERPs,

*Hold on let me load up my Kalashnikov*
general 2021-01-14 22:45:21 Normies that are obsessed with ships and aircraft and armored vehicles*
general 2021-01-14 22:45:44 vs ya fatha
general 2021-01-14 22:46:18 vs ya gran fatha
general 2021-01-14 22:46:41 I have nothing I can think up of right now to insert
general 2021-01-14 22:47:38 What if the mods are furries 

Since they're literally talking objects
general 2021-01-14 22:47:45 Bottle furry, box furry
general 2021-01-14 22:48:02 Ah yes, Batman furry
general 2021-01-14 22:48:11 Batman is a man running around in a fursuit
general 2021-01-14 22:48:36 I just wanna see Xfinity in pain
general 2021-01-14 22:49:06 Nevada is a bat, therefore you can say they're a bat furry
general 2021-01-14 22:49:15 Space bat furry mom
general 2021-01-14 22:49:47 Give us context
general 2021-01-14 22:49:57 O h
general 2021-01-14 22:50:42 Okay I'll go eat breakfast now
general 2021-01-14 22:51:04 Because Roblox doesn't want to heal us, you need to pay bobux
general 2021-01-14 22:52:02 Rickje.

Let's worship rickje
general 2021-01-14 22:52:33 I've got myself banned for saying worse
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 01:31:25 The amount of detail on that thing surprised me a little
the-dump 2021-01-15 01:32:24 Sounds like Koenigsegg
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 02:19:17 You could've still done better, otherwise that rocket really is just basic trash
general 2021-01-15 02:20:59 Wait did Balance left?
general 2021-01-15 02:21:19 No they got banned
general 2021-01-15 02:21:27 Guess what was the last thing they got banned for
general 2021-01-15 02:22:20 I forgot to tell you this 

224jay has a furry pfp
general 2021-01-15 02:22:55 Jojo 

The intakes guy
general 2021-01-15 02:23:48 I don't even know what CADO is 

I'm just a simple monke doing as I please
general 2021-01-15 02:24:18 What's CADO?
general 2021-01-15 02:25:31 I mean, does it have yaw pitch and roll?
general 2021-01-15 02:26:10 Pitch is a bit questionable, but blimps definitely don't have roll
general 2021-01-15 02:26:35 Also, isn't helium banned for VTOL rank?
general 2021-01-15 02:26:53 That's one way of saying rock and roll
general 2021-01-15 02:27:57 Send A-10 Thunderbolts there
general 2021-01-15 02:29:07 Has a side by side Panavia Tornado ever existed
general 2021-01-15 02:29:57 Stage 6: *ahem* 

uwu
general 2021-01-15 02:30:21 pain is good, when you're the one suffering
general 2021-01-15 02:30:39 get hurt by uwu
general 2021-01-15 04:50:30 The Earth burning

It already got one part right
general 2021-01-15 04:51:07 But knowing Roblox story games
general 2021-01-15 04:51:16 It's probably just
general 2021-01-15 04:51:26 Threat appears > Escape from threat > Defeat threat
general 2021-01-15 04:51:45 Maybe some branching, but otherwise same format in the end
general 2021-01-15 04:52:28 That's pretty much story games
general 2021-01-15 04:52:52 If I had robux I'll donate to story games that actually manage to make a decent story
general 2021-01-15 04:53:06 One that doesn't involve yet another cliched threat
general 2021-01-15 04:53:38 CG go uwu
general 2021-01-15 04:54:16 Become Blackbird
Use furry PFP
general 2021-01-15 04:54:56 Nope, and he isn't gonna try to cause havoc
general 2021-01-15 04:55:03 He knows it'll cause havoc anyways without even trying
general 2021-01-15 04:55:14 ***oh they do exist***
general 2021-01-15 04:55:18 Just a rare breed on Twitter
general 2021-01-15 04:56:04 Let's not
general 2021-01-15 04:57:00 I see you use Opera
general 2021-01-15 04:57:06 I use the furry browser, Firefox
general 2021-01-15 04:57:55 Are you implying that superior one is Shrek
general 2021-01-15 04:58:37 No it's Shrek
general 2021-01-15 04:58:43 snek is furry
general 2021-01-15 05:00:10 I wonder if the new map will get a race track, an off-road one maybe
general 2021-01-15 05:00:40 Competition between suspension builds
general 2021-01-15 05:01:16 yes

But I wonder what will rick choose
general 2021-01-15 05:01:23 Among out of all map builders
general 2021-01-15 05:01:34 Softcoding's worth the wait
general 2021-01-15 05:01:39 It's a better long term solution
general 2021-01-15 05:02:07 It would be a blessing if it took under a year
general 2021-01-15 05:02:27 ass thrill ya
general 2021-01-15 05:03:20 What playerbase?
general 2021-01-15 05:04:08 PCC isn't the worst when it's fanbases in general
general 2021-01-15 05:04:34 *Though it is a joke compared to other fanbases ngl*

general 2021-01-15 11:53:18 Them what's Aperture
general 2021-01-15 11:54:02 I hate how this shield makes it look like something else

general 2021-01-15 12:11:01 deer woman
general 2021-01-15 12:12:13 oh wait it's a moose
general 2021-01-15 12:12:16 i thought it was a deer
general 2021-01-15 12:12:52 that looks like madattakchan
general 2021-01-15 12:13:12 who says madattak girl can't have long hair
general 2021-01-15 12:14:03 abandon anime
become hooman
general 2021-01-15 12:14:18 actually

abandon hooman
become a productive member of society
general 2021-01-15 12:14:55 by becoming monke
general 2021-01-15 12:14:57 technically
general 2021-01-15 12:15:00 you are embracing furry
general 2021-01-15 12:15:15 by becoming monke
you get monke fursona
general 2021-01-15 12:15:43 but instead of a fursuit
you become it
general 2021-01-15 12:16:20 Is that supposed to be an F-18
general 2021-01-15 12:16:27 Or is it yet another plane that can't do delta wings right
general 2021-01-15 12:16:51 The latter then, can't do delta wings right
general 2021-01-15 12:18:02 This is an F-15, if you're trying to make one
You're obviously doing something wrong, mainly the main wings
https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/f15c-1.gif
general 2021-01-15 12:18:19 This is an **F-18**, **not** an **F-15** https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/f18a-2.gif
general 2021-01-15 12:18:29 See, different wings
general 2021-01-15 12:19:00 But I don't like it when a delta wing is straight up a trapezoidal wing
general 2021-01-15 12:19:12 I suggested that
general 2021-01-15 12:19:27 Been told that it's a waste of time and that making an essay in general is better
general 2021-01-15 12:19:36 Which is even a bigger waste o time
general 2021-01-15 12:19:45 Because who'd listen to essays in general anyways
general 2021-01-15 12:21:01 Oh, then I made one after yours
https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/507673335816126509/796955338678075402
general 2021-01-15 12:21:27 You gave your F-15 straight ass wings
general 2021-01-15 12:21:39 Your F-15 has trapezoidal wings, not delta wings
general 2021-01-15 12:22:05 Delta wings are more triangle in shape
I mean you even had the images to compare to side by side
general 2021-01-15 12:22:32 So an implementation of Lua into the game?
Actually maybe that's too hard for undes
general 2021-01-15 12:22:50 No supersonic wing I know is supposed to be curved
general 2021-01-15 12:23:35 *Finally*

I can make that multi-keybind thing if that ever happened
general 2021-01-15 12:24:15 Imagine if it ended being scratch just so rick can earn unde money
general 2021-01-15 12:25:14 I know, dont' take that idea too seriously
general 2021-01-15 12:26:10 I know I wasn't being serious about it
Rick's not that kind of dev
general 2021-01-15 12:26:22 He's better than *them*
general 2021-01-15 12:28:20 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_configuration <@!703823635319881738> Here's basic wing designs
general 2021-01-15 12:28:55 Make ailerons
general 2021-01-15 12:29:15 Just search up what an aileron is, and I recommend using keyboard controls
general 2021-01-15 12:29:44 Give me some games that aren't a generic simulator/story/whatever cliche
general 2021-01-15 12:29:53 You know Roblox more than me
general 2021-01-15 12:30:18 Well, what do you think is fun then
general 2021-01-15 12:31:04 Okay Beeper
general 2021-01-15 12:32:48 Maybe I'll try Minecraft
general 2021-01-15 12:32:54 again
general 2021-01-15 12:33:12 I used to do redstone in Minecraft
I might try it again

general 2021-01-15 12:36:33 or whatever zoomers say
general 2021-01-15 12:37:20 Today's generation of Roblox users is easy money bait

general 2021-01-15 12:38:16 you really do
general 2021-01-15 12:39:14 Imagine being some guy in the 1910s
general 2021-01-15 12:39:16 And then you saw this

general 2021-01-15 12:45:26 You'd rather not know
general 2021-01-15 12:45:51 That's why I didn't wanna answer
general 2021-01-15 12:45:57 Next time I'll answer since curiosity kills the cat
general 2021-01-15 12:46:41 ***why is it***

whenever I told you guys not to search it, you search it

if I answered, will you not search it?
general 2021-01-15 12:47:29 <@!738702049113538600> What if your F-16 go **o/w/o**
general 2021-01-15 12:47:45 Fitting for the guy who says uwu <@!738702049113538600>
general 2021-01-15 12:48:16 hold up you're actually into that?
general 2021-01-15 12:48:46 just pretend it's a weird lugia and it'll be less worse

general 2021-01-15 12:49:53 hey at least it ain't an automorph
general 2021-01-15 12:50:24 I might as well embrace it
general 2021-01-15 12:50:41 If I remember, not only do automorphs exist

There's also one for tanks
general 2021-01-15 12:50:56 I'd bet there's also one for ships
general 2021-01-15 12:51:44 Now your turn to experience pain

What if I told you aeromorphs are just Protogens with wings and a more slender body
general 2021-01-15 12:52:09 what if submarine morph
general 2021-01-15 12:52:34 please continue having a stroke from the chat being brainless
general 2021-01-15 12:52:45 Then make one out of your F-16
general 2021-01-15 12:53:34 ***w e l l t h e n***
general 2021-01-15 12:53:37 that is awkward
general 2021-01-15 12:53:53 But is the F-16 seriously 40 years old?
general 2021-01-15 12:54:37 I'll search creations for more recent aircraft you've built
general 2021-01-15 12:54:56 ah yes cursed tank
general 2021-01-15 12:55:13 ***the tank pains me more than aeromorphs***

I have no idea what to add all I'm gonna say is

eunsoo and f-16 go uwu together
general 2021-01-15 12:56:34 tank morphs pain me more, the lack of curves makes them even more unnatural
general 2021-01-15 12:57:15 Antonov An-225 aeromorph

Now all you see is a giant plane girl
general 2021-01-15 12:57:42 You wished for it when you said Airbus A380 aeromorph
general 2021-01-15 12:58:05 ***now you gotta hear about giant antonov an-225 girl cad***
general 2021-01-15 12:58:32 Well less illegal than the Airbus A380
general 2021-01-15 12:59:03 Search up a Boeing 747 or an Antonov An-225, then send it to Cad
Also give eunsoo an F-16
general 2021-01-15 12:59:39 what if I told you

antonov an-225 aeromorph can give you actual affection
real antonov an-225 is just inanimate object
general 2021-01-15 13:00:17 That's why he asked for his age
general 2021-01-15 13:00:46 Speaking of undes

Unes is just a typo for underwear, right
general 2021-01-15 13:01:46 For real what about the Boeing 777?
general 2021-01-15 13:01:49 How old is it?
general 2021-01-15 13:02:06 26

now take a flight with it
general 2021-01-15 13:02:38 antonov an-225 go uwu
general 2021-01-15 13:03:04 cad no longer is reacting
general 2021-01-15 13:03:11 oh well it's fun while it lasted
general 2021-01-15 13:03:20 That looks like schiesse you can find on DeviantArt
general 2021-01-15 13:03:49 anyways, now that pain session is over
general 2021-01-15 13:04:01 let's get pepsiman
general 2021-01-15 13:04:24 ngl this is the most normal thing you've sent so far
general 2021-01-15 13:05:28 Antonov An-225 aeromorph will take care of you
Real Antonov does not

now how do i make this worse
general 2021-01-15 13:05:41 ***y e s***

general 2021-01-15 13:06:19 honk honk uwu train coming

general 2021-01-15 13:08:26 That plane has underwear
general 2021-01-15 13:08:29 And the other plane doesn't
general 2021-01-15 13:08:49 This implies the other aeromorph is no clothes
general 2021-01-15 13:09:06 delete
general 2021-01-15 13:09:08 it's even worse
general 2021-01-15 13:09:45 one of them has underwear but the other one doesn't, if one requires clothes then is the other one doing the illegal
general 2021-01-15 13:10:03 okay let me try to change the topic

general 2021-01-16 09:08:35 you did it
general 2021-01-16 09:09:03 I think I might be able to fit the suspension within these dimensions, body's temporary
general 2021-01-16 09:09:39 More fine tuning needed
general 2021-01-16 09:10:07 I have this
general 2021-01-16 09:10:21 I gave up on custom wheels
general 2021-01-16 09:12:46 Well it worked fine enough

The pistons bear the weight while the outer suspensions made a bit more stable. That and I don't design suspensions often
general 2021-01-16 09:13:40 But the suspension though is fine enough, doesn't feel bumpy and loose
general 2021-01-16 09:14:07 oh wait
general 2021-01-16 09:14:59 Honestly I don't know
general 2021-01-16 09:15:04 I just want something that works
general 2021-01-16 09:15:18 Besides Plane Crazy isn't realistic anyways
general 2021-01-16 09:16:09 too much brainfuck moments given when making them
general 2021-01-16 09:18:20 haha spring go ***A A A A A A H***
general 2021-01-16 09:19:14 I tried to replace the piston suspension with hover suspension, it either needs a redesign or it just can't handle the weight
general 2021-01-16 09:20:09 yes that's why it isn't working
general 2021-01-16 09:20:18 4 ballasts
general 2021-01-16 09:21:07 this is the basic component, yes
general 2021-01-16 09:21:38 no stiffness suspension block, two hover thrusters and a rope
general 2021-01-16 09:22:22 I'll just show something
general 2021-01-16 09:22:25 Let me record something real quick
general 2021-01-16 09:28:11 <@!270291665116200962> idk if this helps https://streamable.com/897nnh
general 2021-01-16 09:29:30 yes I can do that, all I did was make a basic hover susp
general 2021-01-16 09:30:04 I adde more, now it became an anti-grav

general 2021-01-16 09:32:42 become old browser
or tell them
general 2021-01-16 09:32:49 that flash go die die
general 2021-01-16 09:34:29 "we are fixing it" probably means "we don't know what happened"
general 2021-01-16 09:34:41 Considering it's not hard to miss that Adobe Flash is dead
general 2021-01-16 09:35:01 Why even Flash to begin with
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 09:35:29 ugly
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 09:35:40 defies plane design logic
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 09:35:57 not worrying at all

general 2021-01-16 09:37:59 why
general 2021-01-16 09:38:26 that's the fun part
general 2021-01-16 09:38:55 so powerful even you cringe

general 2021-01-16 09:43:57 haha aston go ***A A A A A A***
general 2021-01-16 09:44:47 I'm not surprised that luxury cars lose value so quickly
general 2021-01-16 09:44:53 What about those made by Lexus tho?
general 2021-01-16 09:45:38 I was referring to this when I asked about Lexus
general 2021-01-16 09:46:18 They're under Toyota, so I'd expect a Lexus to at least be less of a pain
general 2021-01-16 09:46:47 That's basically a Mazda Miata with only a few differences
general 2021-01-16 09:46:55 Mainly styling, suspension tuning and the engines
general 2021-01-16 09:48:53 Well, if you are serious about a car, well there's making sure it can last a while, and for a sports car make sure you have fun
general 2021-01-16 09:49:39 The Mazda Miata/Fiat 124 Spider has reviews that shown it to be fun
general 2021-01-16 09:49:57 Hmm, you could get yourself a used sports car
general 2021-01-16 09:50:01 It's not like you're gonna go fast
general 2021-01-16 09:50:08 You just need something that *feels* fun
general 2021-01-16 09:50:17 And looks good
general 2021-01-16 09:50:21 According to you
general 2021-01-16 09:50:28 And is reliable
general 2021-01-16 09:50:58 I thought they were 18
general 2021-01-16 09:51:35 You know more about this than I do
Go tell them what they need to know
general 2021-01-16 09:52:09 I'm gonna be curious and search up how expensive used Lexus cars are over here
general 2021-01-16 09:54:07 <@!444476246899032086> Would you question if an almost decade old Lexus costs about 20 grand more or less.
general 2021-01-16 09:56:13 so basically

japanese cars have good value?
general 2021-01-16 09:56:43 not long
general 2021-01-16 09:57:33 so yes for japanese cars then
general 2021-01-16 09:57:57 Did you seriously waited for 4 weeks
general 2021-01-16 09:58:09 never gonna give you up
general 2021-01-16 09:58:36 I mean to be fair the way you type already gives off underaged vibes
general 2021-01-16 09:58:40 yes
general 2021-01-16 09:59:09 no
general 2021-01-16 10:01:46 I mean a new car is nice
but if say I tried to buy my first car, a used one doesn't sound that bad
general 2021-01-16 10:01:58 I mean it's not like an infotainment system is a deal-breaker
general 2021-01-16 10:02:04 And other new stuff
general 2021-01-16 10:02:33 nice
general 2021-01-16 10:03:00 well, have you asked him why?
general 2021-01-16 10:05:29 <@!444476246899032086> your family likes cars
the-dump 2021-01-16 10:05:52 
general 2021-01-16 10:06:40 why does your family have a lot of cars anyways?
general 2021-01-16 10:08:03 you people sound like have a lot of money
general 2021-01-16 10:08:12 or maybe that BMW wasn't new
general 2021-01-16 10:08:33 ok maybe you people are rich enough if he can just gift them a car
the-dump 2021-01-16 10:15:12 Rick heard your suggestions

Here's his response
general 2021-01-16 10:24:27 I think I'll go play so *our*craft
general 2021-01-16 10:24:49 Chrome what? The browser or OS?
general 2021-01-16 10:25:20 So Chrome OS
general 2021-01-16 10:25:47 Chromebooks aren't meant to be high-end
general 2021-01-16 10:26:03 If you need a good laptop, do some research
general 2021-01-16 10:26:34 Then just deal with it, I don't expect a cheap Chromebook to do more than basic work
general 2021-01-16 10:27:19 I can't remember the last time I used XD, but I only use it when something's actually funny
general 2021-01-16 10:28:01 F-15, what made it a dead giveaway
- The main wings
- The intake
- The general shape
general 2021-01-16 10:29:01 https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/strike-eagle2.gif
general 2021-01-16 10:29:08 Here's the blueprint of an F-15 Strike Eagle

general 2021-01-16 10:29:52 That's why I said to open in a new tab
general 2021-01-16 10:30:27 You can see the F-15 has distinct main wings
general 2021-01-16 10:30:50 Like you can't not recognize that shape once you've seen the F-15
general 2021-01-16 10:31:20 I'll give a challenge

general 2021-01-16 10:36:48 You should answer ours
general 2021-01-16 10:37:31 The fact that you're avoiding my question means you don't know the Lockheed Martin X-44 MANTA

general 2021-01-16 12:24:53 <@!192861290677534722> Future, anything I should know about learning Lua? Such as any Roblox specific documentation I should know of? If none I might just consider reading the Lua website's documentation then

general 2021-01-16 12:36:41 what do you think of it
general 2021-01-16 12:36:58 as you can see in the background
general 2021-01-16 12:37:16 knock-off oreos, but the bars themselves taste fine
general 2021-01-16 12:37:31 Cereal crispies
general 2021-01-16 12:37:40 Maybe that gives an extra cronch?
general 2021-01-16 12:37:53 idk
general 2021-01-16 12:37:58 Maybe flavor? Or texture?
general 2021-01-16 12:38:36 is someone in modellers using a Gamecube as a PFP
general 2021-01-16 12:38:54 I think that's my grandma's age, maybe a bit more
general 2021-01-16 12:39:03 or less
general 2021-01-16 12:39:12 I wouldn't know, but lived past 60 I think
general 2021-01-16 12:39:21 yeah definitely beyond 60
general 2021-01-16 12:39:30 So 70+

general 2021-01-16 12:44:13 moral of the story
general 2021-01-16 12:44:16 don't give mom beans
general 2021-01-16 12:44:37 we don't have footage of mom farting, so here's the equivalent
general 2021-01-16 12:45:08 Boeing X-32 was rejected in favor of the F-35 anyways
general 2021-01-16 12:46:40 And can actually VTOL without much change
general 2021-01-16 12:46:55 Less configuration stuffs
general 2021-01-16 12:47:26 F-35 is basically chonkier F-22
general 2021-01-16 12:47:40 So basically
general 2021-01-16 12:47:45 Smaller F-22 is better
general 2021-01-16 12:47:52 no wait not smaller, but chonkier
general 2021-01-16 12:50:34 i mean I did made something worse
general 2021-01-16 12:50:38 which is knock-off mac os
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 12:52:09 how are you people this motivated
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 12:52:20 I can barely build an airborne aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 12:52:39 oh hi miner
general 2021-01-16 12:53:05 whois htis
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 12:53:59 Imagine if Miner made a carrier
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 12:54:06 wait he did
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 12:54:22 What has miner not built yet
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 12:54:26 That he could do his miner magic on
general 2021-01-16 12:54:53 I almost misread that as Theme Mefin
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 12:55:50 The F-35 is a discount F-22, but with VTOL
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 12:56:12 I mean it does look kinda chonky
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 12:56:18 But I'd blame that on the lift fan system
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 12:56:52 I was calling it discount because of how it looks
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 12:57:18 It looks like if you made the F-22 just more chonkier, that's what I think of the F-35
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 12:57:44 I mean, they do wanna export 5th gen fighter jets, yes?
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 12:57:56 Without exposing whatever they need to hide on the F-22
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 12:59:19 I'll give you the best Mitsubishi
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 12:59:28 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/X-2_First_Flight.jpg
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 12:59:48 ok but what do you people even consider when making aircraft carriers
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:00:12 ~~and is it possible to add at least small motor locked fighter jets~~
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:00:34 Aesthetic and capacity
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:01:25 I mean to be fair

I got nothing, planes are hard to land
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:01:40 Especially when it stalls at low speed
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:01:50 F-104
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:02:02 It has them short stubby trapezoidal wings
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:02:10 I have an idea
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:02:18 What if we make the F-104 a missile
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:02:44 yes, F-104 already looks like it can be a missile
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:03:00 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Lockheed_XF-104_(modified).jpg/1200px-Lockheed_XF-104_(modified).jpg
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:03:13 see, already missile like
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:03:22 but somehow it can carry more missiles
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:03:29 What if
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:03:31 We make a missile
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:03:35 But it defends itself with smaller missiles
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:03:55 that send kamikaze missiles to defend itself
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:04:20 yes but they make their smoler brethren to die
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:04:42 now that's just a kamikaze f-104
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:04:46 but loaded with explosives
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:04:48 ready to go boom
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:05:08 I should make more dart like plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:05:30 I should focus on learning Lua anyways
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:05:41 That's where I can earn bobux (hopefully)
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:05:46 besides how hard is it to cash grab undes
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:06:13 take game, spice it up, then add gamepasses
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:06:17 b o b u x
general 2021-01-16 13:06:51 And if I were to make a game, how much knowledge of Lua do I actually really need
general 2021-01-16 13:06:57 I want some of that bobux tbh
general 2021-01-16 13:07:44 Well, I could start small, but I shouldn't make those easy obbies
general 2021-01-16 13:07:54 It's overpopulated there
general 2021-01-16 13:08:24 I could learn from mobile game devs
general 2021-01-16 13:09:07 Learn enough Lua (if needed)
Make addicting game
Add bobux traps
general 2021-01-16 13:09:35 Oh, that's neat
general 2021-01-16 13:10:06 The AI I assume
general 2021-01-16 13:10:35 And the fact that there's a lot to consider when playing a game of chess, I mean the moves you can make if I remember is more than the atoms of the universe
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:10:49 ah yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:10:51 helicooper
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:10:57 minercooper
general 2021-01-16 13:11:45 Well
general 2021-01-16 13:11:54 I should go continue what I was doing earlier, learning Python
general 2021-01-16 13:12:04 Or brainstorm what I can make in Roblox
general 2021-01-16 13:12:41 I started with it so learning programming is more gradual
general 2021-01-16 13:13:00 And I can use it anyways
general 2021-01-16 13:13:28 https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html I'm at this section
general 2021-01-16 13:13:35 Lesson 4
general 2021-01-16 13:15:24 It's just logic
general 2021-01-16 13:16:40 <@!192861290677534722> So Future, Roblox has it's own version of Lua, is that correct?
general 2021-01-16 13:16:51 And if so, it isn't vastly different, is it
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 13:17:06 minercopter to take the diamonds home
general 2021-01-16 13:17:27 ah, so I shouldn't worry about it much
general 2021-01-16 13:17:47 just the scripting and the ideas
general 2021-01-16 13:18:25 <@!738702049113538600> I think I'll just combine the crusher and that one wall game
general 2021-01-16 13:18:40 And put it in Obby format
general 2021-01-16 13:18:50 easy unde bux (probably)
general 2021-01-16 13:19:13 no then
general 2021-01-16 13:19:40 Eh I shouldn't think too hard about it
general 2021-01-16 13:19:44 Maybe it'll come as a shower thought
general 2021-01-16 13:20:38 <@!738702049113538600> Would you be mad at me if I made an escape game just for the sake of getting an unde's money
general 2021-01-16 13:25:13 aight that's fair
now to think of what to escape from, but man's gotta keep the quality though. nobody's gonna be wanting to play a random escape/obby in the void.
something like this I saw my brother play
<https://www.roblox.com/games/195845601/Rob-Mr-Richs-Mansion-Obby-NEW-READ-DESC>
general 2021-01-16 13:25:49 I might consider exposing myself to pain
general 2021-01-16 13:25:58 I want ideas for the bobux
general 2021-01-16 13:31:07 maybe when I can write a decent racing game
general 2021-01-16 13:38:28 Another format I'm thinking of for a Roblox games

One of those place games or whatever you call them, like bunker.jpeg
general 2021-01-16 13:40:38 if I took this question seriously, it would be

because people care more about personality than about reproduction
general 2021-01-16 13:53:29 Give me some tactics games use to either extract the most play time or robux out of their users
general 2021-01-17 01:57:39 A part of me wishes there was a server divide for <13 and 13+
general 2021-01-17 01:58:08 Everytime I hear an unde try to sound like a pro, it hurts my brain
general 2021-01-17 01:59:01 batter man
general 2021-01-17 02:00:30 yes batman is epic
general 2021-01-17 02:01:01 very rich with fists that go brrrr
general 2021-01-17 02:02:09 ah yes

blue sea horse
general 2021-01-17 02:02:22 I'm fine with both
general 2021-01-17 02:03:07 "dedicated father"
Are you talking about Robin(s) or does he actually have a child
general 2021-01-17 02:04:10 So I guess it is kinda both

He has an actual child, but said child also became a Robin
general 2021-01-17 02:04:23 That also became a Teen Titan
general 2021-01-17 02:08:31 A guy who joined the PCC

First impressions, random quizzes
general 2021-01-17 02:08:54 All being related to aerospace
general 2021-01-17 02:09:41 oh wait I was thinking of azo
general 2021-01-17 02:09:59 I died trying to make an AAC, didn't do the wings
general 2021-01-17 02:10:21 that's called giving us a brainfuck
general 2021-01-17 02:10:52 I don't have the motivation to even build a tank
general 2021-01-17 02:11:09 Maybe I should do what I did with cars
general 2021-01-17 02:11:30 Build the technical parts such as suspension and the body seperately
general 2021-01-17 02:11:33 Then combine them
general 2021-01-17 02:12:13 tank nub then
general 2021-01-17 02:12:47 de Haviland Comet?
general 2021-01-17 02:13:49 Has there been an a jet aircraft that hasn't been overbuilt?
general 2021-01-17 02:14:50 your mom after a diet
general 2021-01-17 02:15:20 but yes I agree with Touched_Pork
general 2021-01-17 02:16:04 The USSR anthem here is the equivalent of a milked meme
general 2021-01-17 02:16:39 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kw1BT6hY9Q On the other hand, this will never get old
general 2021-01-17 02:16:49 Because otamatones
general 2021-01-17 02:17:25 It's implied
general 2021-01-17 02:18:19 A flinger's more fun anyways, can be more creative and more worthwhile
general 2021-01-17 02:19:18 Are you on a 4-inch phone or something
general 2021-01-17 02:19:37 add conveyor drive and hella lot of mass
general 2021-01-17 02:20:17 honestly no

but tank treads do the funni physics throttling, and that makes the tank slower than it actually is
general 2021-01-17 02:20:26 trick undes into thinking slow tank is safe
general 2021-01-17 02:20:40 That I don't remember it
general 2021-01-17 02:20:59 oh I meant it as a separate thing, a suggestion
general 2021-01-17 02:21:30 oh good point
general 2021-01-17 02:21:38 just make it hella fast and hella fat

general 2021-01-17 03:32:34 And of course the mobile game dev tactics, see what works
general 2021-01-17 03:32:39 Then extract the monies
general 2021-01-17 03:34:51 Hmm, I'll do the abstraction of bobux like the vid said, because hey if it works for mobile game devs and casinos then might as well try it

general 2021-01-17 12:50:40 what else am i missing
general 2021-01-17 12:52:33 what if suspension + folding on the trucc
general 2021-01-17 12:52:38 so you can make it lonk but comfy

general 2021-01-17 12:53:45 spam weapons
general 2021-01-17 12:56:59 Hmm, I wonder if I should do a multiplayer obby game where the goal is to slow each other down or kill each other to win first place
general 2021-01-17 12:58:01 Maybe I can implement an upgrade system
general 2021-01-17 12:58:05 Or a shop
general 2021-01-17 12:58:12 Then undes will have to pay to win
general 2021-01-17 12:59:10 undes trying to murder each other in a game good opportunity for a pay-to-win situation, yes?
general 2021-01-17 12:59:29 or at least make each other lose by being slown down
general 2021-01-17 13:04:57 give me ideas on competitive pay-to-win obby
general 2021-01-17 13:05:22 the stuff I can use to give players a boost, or to the detriment of others

general 2021-01-17 13:07:29 y e s
general 2021-01-17 13:08:03 yes and to make it even more bobux worthy

it's a vip only thing, meaning no amount of daily rewards can get you that
general 2021-01-17 13:08:10 Or at least very hard to get
general 2021-01-17 13:09:06 The shop has two currencies, rocoins and rogems (or whatever name I could think of)

Rogems can buy you rocoins and the premium items, while rocoins buys you normie stuff
general 2021-01-17 13:09:31 I'll add an abstraction of currency so undes don't know how much they're truly spending for
general 2021-01-17 13:10:01 why
general 2021-01-17 13:10:23 they want the vongo-waifu

general 2021-01-18 01:24:57 <@456226577798135808> I know how to make the nose intake smoother, use motor angling
general 2021-01-18 01:25:27 Basically, delay the motor lock
Use a motor to rotate some half wedges
general 2021-01-18 01:25:31 Locked motor*
general 2021-01-18 01:25:52 Did you use a locked motor to rotate it
general 2021-01-18 01:27:33 a non locked motor spasms when you try to motor angle
general 2021-01-18 01:27:45 also it must be rotated before the motor delay
general 2021-01-18 01:31:10 personalization settings mostly isn't it?
general 2021-01-18 01:39:32 still doesn't mean it's a complete loss of personalization
general 2021-01-18 01:39:43 that's if third party software counts

general 2021-01-18 05:59:59 Ah

So the characters are ripped off from Cars
The name of the characters are ripped off from Transformers
The credits are ripped off from another Chinese movie
The show is literally a ripped compilation of episodes from a kids' show, or so I've heard
The show is literally rip-off in every way possible

general 2021-01-19 07:27:11 but yes you can crash Windows 10 with that bug
general 2021-01-19 07:27:26 By simply trying to access a simple file location
general 2021-01-19 07:27:57 
general 2021-01-19 07:28:09 wait where's the rest of the text
general 2021-01-19 07:30:51 <@!499705220637392897> where is it

general 2021-01-19 07:32:15 doesn't matter what species, whether it be fox, wolf, dragon, cat, etc.

general 2021-01-19 07:34:30 why to burn your eyes ofc

general 2021-01-19 07:45:43 <@!299289130964090881> look a femboi fox
general 2021-01-19 07:46:02 I'm tempted to make your PFP worse
general 2021-01-19 07:46:08 By finding another femboi furry
general 2021-01-19 07:46:18 Because your pain is my satisfaction
general 2021-01-19 07:48:08 what you gotta dedicate to the looks
general 2021-01-19 07:48:22 a man's gotta dedicate himself to his craft
general 2021-01-19 07:49:22 because you make horrible decisions in life?
general 2021-01-19 07:52:04 yes
general 2021-01-19 07:52:16 we must make furry fembois a trend
general 2021-01-19 07:52:19 so others can be in pain
general 2021-01-19 07:52:39 then it must leak into pcc
general 2021-01-19 07:53:28 yes that's real
general 2021-01-19 07:53:47 speaking of furry anime
general 2021-01-19 07:54:04 https://www.netflix.com/ph/title/81220429
general 2021-01-19 07:54:34 yes but I might've sent one
general 2021-01-19 07:54:39 skip if not furry
general 2021-01-19 07:54:56 become one with the cringe, so you don't feel cringe
general 2021-01-19 07:56:11 wait is that a google search result?
general 2021-01-19 07:57:07 still not as good as this classic
general 2021-01-19 07:57:29 where is steve anyways
general 2021-01-19 07:57:41 Blame Markiplier
general 2021-01-19 07:57:57 make it fabric
general 2021-01-19 07:58:01 needs them grip
general 2021-01-19 07:58:55 no not long enough
general 2021-01-19 07:59:06 what if rolling pin buggy
general 2021-01-19 07:59:39 or how about drag racing car but all four wheels are rolling pins
general 2021-01-19 07:59:59 help I accidentally swallowed a traumatized ball
general 2021-01-19 08:00:27 ferrari go hee hee
general 2021-01-19 08:00:48 I like that you used a sideways horse for the logo
general 2021-01-19 08:03:31 Vongogirl, Vongodad or Vongomom
general 2021-01-19 08:05:38 if water is made out of hydrogen and oxygen, and both of those are flammable, then why is water not flammable
general 2021-01-19 08:07:23 I wonder how long will shadedwood keep the pfp
general 2021-01-19 08:07:37 a 6x6 yes
general 2021-01-19 08:08:28 Probably not the kind you'd bring to an urban area considering the visibility
general 2021-01-19 08:09:22 i'll go learn how I'll do a forced camera perspective and a shop
general 2021-01-19 08:09:35 For an 2D FPS type of game
general 2021-01-19 09:14:05 I up voted the Pepsi fleet
general 2021-01-19 09:14:34 Can't forget that one time Pepsi traded for vokda
general 2021-01-19 09:14:53 But they can't trade the Soviets vodka all the time so they got a military fleet
general 2021-01-19 09:15:52 Russians 

If you can't trade for vodka, trade them with metal
general 2021-01-19 09:16:23 I keep frgetting what NI means
general 2021-01-19 09:17:11 I would like to make an inquiry joke please
general 2021-01-19 09:18:34 What if 

Eunsuwu Gaming
general 2021-01-19 09:18:48 If you mean YouTuber by copycat then yes he is
general 2021-01-19 09:19:23 Already, multiple times
general 2021-01-19 09:19:30 We even mass disliked his videos
general 2021-01-19 09:20:21 Ping eunsoo if you think he is gay catgirl furry
general 2021-01-19 09:21:06 <@738702049113538600>
general 2021-01-19 09:21:31 Nuclear powered plane?
general 2021-01-19 09:22:14 I have no idea
general 2021-01-19 09:22:29 All I know is that the nuclear powered plane is a Convair project
general 2021-01-19 09:22:50 Turbojet? Turbofan? Turboprop?
general 2021-01-19 09:23:48 Imagine plane, but the fuel is anime
general 2021-01-19 09:24:05 Burn anime to make plane fly
general 2021-01-19 09:24:33 Why must you make me laugh
general 2021-01-19 09:25:02 Any taller and she might end up looking like a traffic light
general 2021-01-19 09:25:08 With how much she gives mixed signals
general 2021-01-19 09:25:52 No sit on it, so we have a reason why his eyes are red
general 2021-01-19 09:27:06 That explains everything 

She's a giraffe furry, but all that neck length went to her legs
general 2021-01-19 09:27:37 Find if he said uwu/owo
general 2021-01-19 09:27:55 The leg giraffe. Legraffe
general 2021-01-19 09:28:43 **OwO~**
general 2021-01-19 09:29:10 Make Vungimobile
general 2021-01-19 09:29:59 The title has a mistranslation.

It's called "Ancestors Ran away"
general 2021-01-19 09:30:33 Imagine PCC, but it's just furry and weebs
general 2021-01-19 09:30:58 Eunsoo stays since he is furry
general 2021-01-19 09:31:20 Catgirl
general 2021-01-19 09:31:31 Admit you are femboi cat
general 2021-01-19 09:31:54 The femboi cat Eunsuwu
general 2021-01-19 09:32:30 By doing the weeb ritual while its not too late
general 2021-01-19 09:33:21 If you do it now he might just stay as anime catgirl
general 2021-01-19 09:33:27 Not full furry
general 2021-01-19 09:34:36 How about I infect you with cringe 

*uwu nuzzles you cutely*
general 2021-01-19 09:34:43 You have cringe
general 2021-01-19 09:35:06 Thanks
general 2021-01-19 09:35:10 I am cringey
general 2021-01-19 09:35:27 I am a student of cringery
general 2021-01-19 09:36:09 Then I fight tumor with tumor 

***b O o P***
general 2021-01-19 09:36:49 I'll go watch the new BFDI episodes
general 2021-01-19 09:37:00 Haven't watched the series in a while
general 2021-01-19 09:37:27 Boi just make your D drive the main one at this point
general 2021-01-19 09:38:23 I'd like to have a PC with at least Ryzen 3 specs for some decent gaming and work
general 2021-01-19 09:38:56 Maybe when I get a job I should invest in used stuff
general 2021-01-19 09:39:04 Since they seem to work if done right
general 2021-01-19 09:39:46 I like m o n e y
general 2021-01-19 09:39:50 I'm crabman
general 2021-01-19 09:40:27 ***M o n e y*** 🦀
general 2021-01-19 09:40:46 Mr. Crabbe
general 2021-01-19 09:41:01 Ok
general 2021-01-19 09:41:06 *I flop on you*
general 2021-01-19 09:41:33 I have Macindows
general 2021-01-19 09:41:57 Mac UI + Windows 10
general 2021-01-19 09:42:02 Macindows
general 2021-01-19 11:57:10 MC is more civilized *back then*
general 2021-01-19 11:57:42 Remember when MC had a community of creative people or just people who wanna have a good time
general 2021-01-19 11:58:06 It seems undes of this generation really do ruin everything, don't they?
general 2021-01-19 11:58:28 This place is where your braincells die
general 2021-01-19 11:59:08 Try getting into an argument on Twitter

You'll get to meet actual assholes, 4chan /b/ if you want uncontrolled chaos
general 2021-01-19 11:59:52 Let's wind back to 200X
general 2021-01-19 12:00:00 Or early 2010s
general 2021-01-19 12:00:23 No you gotta be Bri'ish to say Bri'ish words

Just like how you gotta be furry to say uwu and owo
general 2021-01-19 12:01:43 Honestly even kids' YT channels were better back then

An actual worthwhile Minecraft adventure that's original and isn't adding yet another cliche, meme or overused pop culture reference.
general 2021-01-19 12:02:13 I remember that, I was fond of that
general 2021-01-19 12:02:40 DanTDM sorta moved on from Minecraft
PopularMMOs I'm not sure, but I remembered him for mod showcases
general 2021-01-19 12:03:18 DanTDM's still relevant, he just diversified I guess
general 2021-01-19 12:05:03 There's worse.
general 2021-01-19 12:05:31 Oh good, he left

He was being an immature pain in the ass
general 2021-01-19 12:06:22 go finish it
general 2021-01-19 12:06:31 what're you doing here?
general 2021-01-19 12:06:59 When I read Golden Eagle, I thought it was that Korean "F-16"
general 2021-01-19 12:07:49 floating man go eeee
general 2021-01-19 12:08:13 If you want motivation to leave

**O w O ! ~**
general 2021-01-19 12:08:19 here's motivational leave
general 2021-01-19 12:08:21 now get out
general 2021-01-19 12:08:25 finish your thing
general 2021-01-19 12:08:45 just leave already blackbird finish your thing
general 2021-01-19 12:09:09 is poob
general 2021-01-19 12:09:32 skim and just write the basic details
general 2021-01-19 12:10:06 ~~Blackbird, you disappointment, but don't worry, I'm a bit of a disappointment too~~
general 2021-01-19 12:10:15 Maybe that's why you have a furry PFP
general 2021-01-19 12:11:00 I get motivation from the thought of benefits
general 2021-01-19 12:11:02 Like bobux
general 2021-01-19 12:11:16 And for learning Python, just the idea of making stuff is enough for me
general 2021-01-19 12:11:39 Compared to the level of difficulty, it isn't demotivating for me
general 2021-01-19 12:11:54 I just want dem bobux
general 2021-01-19 12:12:22 bobux good
So I'm gonna brainstorm on my first bobux farm
general 2021-01-19 12:12:36 Aka a game undes will play and willingly give me money for
general 2021-01-19 12:12:57 Honestly, I might just consider doing a simulator
general 2021-01-19 12:13:16 Because all I need is bobux, if I wanted to make an *actual game*, I'd consider aiming a little higher
general 2021-01-19 12:13:49 I'll just copy some code online to make a simulator, the harder part would probably in how to differentiate myself
general 2021-01-19 12:14:01 because you think in the end you'll fail, or at least get nothing?
general 2021-01-19 12:16:09 Then give yourself a reason to do something
general 2021-01-19 12:16:17 Like the idea of success
general 2021-01-19 12:16:26 And having people care about you from that success
general 2021-01-19 12:17:37 Become successful game dev
Get ~~simps~~ fans/whatever
general 2021-01-19 12:17:47 even at roblox scale
general 2021-01-19 12:17:50 o h
general 2021-01-19 12:17:55 well, what does make you happy
general 2021-01-19 12:18:08 o h
general 2021-01-19 12:20:30 I am simple monke
I find pleasure in simple things
Even just an escape gives short term feel good
general 2021-01-19 12:20:44 I'm an idiotvert
general 2021-01-19 12:21:11 I think of myself as an ambivert
general 2021-01-19 12:21:27 not stealthy enough
general 2021-01-19 12:21:40 You need to get some of that furry DNA in your PFP
general 2021-01-19 12:21:52 Like a Faunbutt PFP
general 2021-01-19 12:22:38 I just go into communities of like minded people
general 2021-01-19 12:23:10 you know there's a site dedicated to furry sauce
general 2021-01-19 12:24:05 I'm open, but only to friends or when I feel anonymous about it
general 2021-01-19 12:24:34 What about now?
general 2021-01-19 12:25:01 Maybe this is why I'm an idiot who has the need to distract myself from real life's discord
general 2021-01-19 12:26:32 can you tell me why?
general 2021-01-19 12:29:58 Same, I think I'll just you people here to resolve this
general 2021-01-19 12:30:59 Mine's about 12:30 NN to 4 PM
general 2021-01-19 12:31:16 I end up waking up earlier than I need to
general 2021-01-19 12:31:19 Because sibling
general 2021-01-19 12:31:52 And I end up getting a lack of rest mentally

You came from your dad and were born out of your mom
general 2021-01-19 12:37:05 I'lll just let you think why
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 12:37:15 about what
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 12:37:23 high resolution gif
general 2021-01-19 12:37:54 why not google it
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 12:38:31 resolution so high yet lines so thin zooming out makes it weird
general 2021-01-19 12:39:36 I wonder what simulator I should do
general 2021-01-19 12:41:31 if clones of each other exist and they work

then it's bobux time
general 2021-01-19 12:48:44 <@!632942443536318494> I have an idea

Rolympics Simulator
general 2021-01-19 12:48:59 Basically obby + those simulators where you get stronger, faster and jump higher
general 2021-01-19 12:49:35 I'll also add a prestige thing, so if undes want to flex they'll have to restart the entire thing
general 2021-01-19 12:49:46 They might've restarted but they get a "cool" rank
general 2021-01-19 12:50:00 I'll also monetize it as much as possible
general 2021-01-19 12:50:37 And if unde completionists exist, I should try adding collectibles or something that'll keep them at bay
general 2021-01-19 12:50:45 Something they might be even willing to pay bobux to complete
general 2021-01-19 12:51:01 yes this is good idea for unde farming
general 2021-01-19 12:51:46 I both like and hate that's how you actually lure undes
general 2021-01-19 12:52:57 Boblox game for bobux
general 2021-01-19 12:54:43 the game will be free to play
basically just think of those freemium games like candy crush
general 2021-01-19 12:55:56 your ass stimky
general 2021-01-19 12:57:19 wait wat

creations-chat 2021-01-19 22:43:13 I gotta agree with BobJohson.

Magnets are buggy to work with. Motor locking doesn't really affect blocks directly
general 2021-01-19 22:44:10 servo go brrrr
general 2021-01-19 22:44:53 I don't know why some animals have tails go begin with
general 2021-01-19 22:45:13 Monkey, I can see why
general 2021-01-19 22:45:27 They do have the bone for it though
general 2021-01-19 22:47:04 Become bodiless 
Become DC superhero 
Become Cyborg
general 2021-01-19 22:50:27 Servos sometimes like to go brrrr
general 2021-01-19 22:51:05 If they can't answer, reverse image search it
general 2021-01-19 22:51:43 Intakes large

general 2021-01-19 22:52:38 You gotta do intakes, we wanna see the ***s u c c*** intakes
general 2021-01-19 22:53:16 Nah the plane is actually his dad
general 2021-01-19 22:54:02 I mean it's an interceptor meant for the SR-71 Blackbird
general 2021-01-19 22:54:40 They need all the air to go at Mach 3

general 2021-01-20 03:46:23 no i'd rather call them flying tubes
general 2021-01-20 03:46:29 two holes, just like a tube
general 2021-01-20 03:46:33 one sucks air, one blows air

general 2021-01-20 03:49:25 yes but I like to call a flying tube
general 2021-01-20 03:49:36 tubes are cylinders with hole
general 2021-01-20 03:50:05 Mig-15 has best/worst NATO name

general 2021-01-20 04:09:16 boi you had a furry femboy pfp yesterday
general 2021-01-20 04:09:34 technically that includes catgirls, whether anime or furry
general 2021-01-20 04:09:44 since catgirls are technically not human
general 2021-01-20 04:09:48 since they identify as cat
general 2021-01-20 04:10:15 technically some anime characters aren't human
therefore they don't have human rights
general 2021-01-20 04:10:25 likewise cat furries get cat rights
general 2021-01-20 04:10:52 I just realized something
general 2021-01-20 04:11:11 If miner isn't human due to his unhuman building skills
general 2021-01-20 04:11:14 then does he have human rights

general 2021-01-20 12:52:41 They also try to deny that they're doing something wrong, don't they?
general 2021-01-20 12:52:45 Like when they get blacklisted
general 2021-01-20 12:52:59 They'll say something like "WHAT DID I DO WRONG?!"
general 2021-01-20 12:53:31 yes vungi go upvote cargo

general 2021-01-20 13:00:15 what are you gonna do?
general 2021-01-20 13:00:19 for cargo plane
general 2021-01-20 13:00:28 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FICON_project I'll modify this idea then
general 2021-01-20 13:00:56 I need them dumb ideas
general 2021-01-20 13:00:59 For brain juice
general 2021-01-20 13:02:09 I want to make cargo plane, but something that's a little unconventional
general 2021-01-20 13:02:40 Like supersonic cargo plane, or aircraft carrier + cargo plane

And a Flying Fedex Van is definitely unconventional
general 2021-01-20 13:02:49 But hey if mods consider it, I might actually consider trying it
general 2021-01-20 13:03:12 Have the mods actually accepted unconventional builds like that
general 2021-01-20 13:04:33 Well, remember rbk's tank seaplane right?
And it's valid wasn't it?
general 2021-01-20 13:05:03 <@!466793357318815744> rbk just for clarification, your tank seaplane was valid right?
general 2021-01-20 13:05:26 I liked the idea of flying car for cargo aircraft
general 2021-01-20 13:06:19 I still want dumb ideas
general 2021-01-20 13:07:01 Step 1.) Rebuild my suspension
Step 2.) Slap body
Step 3.) Add wings
Step 4.) Conveyor drive
general 2021-01-20 13:07:21 yes that is idea
general 2021-01-20 13:07:40 slap on a body
general 2021-01-20 13:08:18 If off-road vehicles won contest, and amphibious is allowed...

general 2021-01-20 13:09:22 Schwimmwagen t r u c c
general 2021-01-20 13:09:45 I need the dumb and quirky ideas
general 2021-01-20 13:10:25 It's either
1.) Flying cargo van
2.) Cargo + Aircraft Carrier Plane
3.) ***S c h w i m m w a g e n***
general 2021-01-20 13:11:06 Nobody has the time for an An-225
general 2021-01-20 13:11:15 Besides I already have a triple decker aircraft I'm too lazy to finish
general 2021-01-20 13:11:26 I have two choices for cargo, one choice for off-roader
general 2021-01-20 13:11:43 I know being lazy
Because I am the laziness
general 2021-01-20 13:12:23 I haven't even done the wings of my triple decker
general 2021-01-20 13:12:32 Making it t h i c c while being acceptable is demotivating
general 2021-01-20 13:17:07 I see one is a conventional aircraft, one is a trapezoidal/delta wing SST and one is a the VongoBeluga
general 2021-01-20 13:17:29 My cargo *aircraft* is not a plane
general 2021-01-20 13:17:38 Or maybe it will be but it's also an aircraft carrier
general 2021-01-20 13:18:42 Cargo aircraft, not planes

Here's what polyurethane's used for
general 2021-01-21 08:16:21 So this ain't no weak plastic apparently

general 2021-01-21 08:21:22 yes
general 2021-01-21 08:21:52 But as expected

The internet will always end up in an argument
general 2021-01-21 08:25:26 Honestly I don't give a crap whether you want PF or not in <#497142796961054721>

general 2021-01-21 12:11:44 Which means I could easily just slap together some stuff on Roblox
general 2021-01-21 12:11:51 To make a game for easy bobux
general 2021-01-21 12:12:18 How much bobux do roleplay and simulator games get
general 2021-01-21 12:14:05 Honestly, all I need is get some undes to pay me

general 2021-01-21 12:27:02 o h
general 2021-01-21 12:27:33 I should probably keep things simple

I tend to overestimate myself
general 2021-01-21 12:27:39 wait why do you have 120 of them
general 2021-01-21 12:29:44 ok I'll go to thinking

general 2021-01-21 12:39:55 I'm stuck in loading limbo
general 2021-01-21 12:46:04 I should probably just try small
general 2021-01-21 12:46:10 By doing one of those "place" games
general 2021-01-21 12:46:27 Or "vibe places"
general 2021-01-21 12:46:36 Or whatever those small places are
general 2021-01-21 12:46:49 Yes, start small then I go bigger
general 2021-01-21 12:47:55 Yes, some place to relax
general 2021-01-21 12:48:05 And a little bit of gamepasses sprinkled there because that wouldn't hurt
general 2021-01-21 12:48:18 Anyways, I am the dark knight
general 2021-01-21 12:51:45 H m m m

general 2021-01-22 05:01:24 rbk offered bobux if it's not a plane
general 2021-01-22 05:01:33 So I did it literally
general 2021-01-22 05:02:46 It looks like a weird stickman
general 2021-01-22 05:04:33 M1911
general 2021-01-22 05:04:45 But something's obviously wrong

general 2021-01-22 06:58:29 There is a difference in the software used to render raytracing and a brand name for raytracing ready graphics cards
general 2021-01-22 06:59:01 needs more faster spin
general 2021-01-22 06:59:24 I should make PC gifs

general 2021-01-22 07:05:21 too much creative efforts for my tiny brain
general 2021-01-22 07:21:25 i saw a stick bug
general 2021-01-22 07:21:34 I find it odd it doesn't fell
general 2021-01-22 07:21:44 on the other hand it's just sweeping the ground
general 2021-01-22 07:22:09 yes
general 2021-01-22 07:22:13 I am not safe from that
general 2021-01-22 07:22:25 Because I like to half-arse effort
general 2021-01-22 07:27:03 wart popper
general 2021-01-22 07:31:03 <@!287779983445721088> I have an idea if you plan to join the contest

general 2021-01-22 07:31:19 even if you don't win, you get rbk's bobux
general 2021-01-22 07:32:57 On the other hand, there are people with screechy voices
general 2021-01-22 07:33:37 An industrial fan?
general 2021-01-22 07:34:28 At first I was gonna question why you need a hella big fan
general 2021-01-22 07:34:47 I have two rooms fans
general 2021-01-22 07:34:54 In this room
general 2021-01-22 07:35:06 Because I don't wanna be cold if my brother wants to be cold

general 2021-01-22 07:35:57 The land of the free ~~and capitalism and oil~~
general 2021-01-22 07:36:16 You guys have money making technologies
general 2021-01-22 07:37:46 Us Asians have a different way of cooling down

Typhoons and the floods that follow
general 2021-01-22 07:38:13 jokes aside they're bad
🙃
general 2021-01-22 07:38:37 Honestly the EAS tone is scarier than the typhoon in where I live
general 2021-01-22 07:39:07 Well I guess we're in an unfortunate location
general 2021-01-22 07:40:08 So basically, anyone those living near bodies of water

People still get hurt since the typhoons here occasionally get real strong
general 2021-01-22 07:41:26 all humans aren't normal
general 2021-01-22 07:41:36 if we were then we wouldn't have degeneracy
general 2021-01-22 07:41:49 or various medical conditions
general 2021-01-22 07:41:56 like what notmlggoose said
general 2021-01-22 07:42:35 I also have no idea
general 2021-01-22 07:43:12 who just posted something about nuking here

general 2021-01-22 07:45:13 The US is just chaos now
general 2021-01-22 07:45:41 Piracy but it's real life
general 2021-01-22 07:45:58 I'm content in my little Asian archipelago

general 2021-01-22 09:45:27 I still think the F-35 is kinda fat for a stealth fighter
general 2021-01-22 09:46:33 "Surprizingly"

We now have a challenger against Darkz's name
general 2021-01-22 09:46:47 Wart hog

general 2021-01-22 09:49:53 Which is either mechanical, industrial or *maybe* electrical
general 2021-01-22 09:51:04 They could do writing

But wouldn't something like video speak for itself?
general 2021-01-22 09:51:14 If it's gonna be shown physically pre-corona
general 2021-01-22 09:51:47 O h

general 2021-01-22 12:21:38 You do realize

*pinging everyone is disabled*
**and that logs exist.**
***and those logs can be used to track if someone did something bad.***
general 2021-01-22 12:22:58 Only the moderators can ping everyone

Regulars here cannot, as these people have demonstrated

A ping usually highlights a msesage in yellow, like this <@!393858481268064266>

general 2021-01-22 12:29:36 yes
general 2021-01-22 12:29:54 maybe if you accept being a femboi cat
general 2021-01-22 12:30:00 then I'll stop calling you a femboi hippo

general 2021-01-23 11:07:17 as a multi-collab project
general 2021-01-23 11:07:21 for almsot one hour
general 2021-01-23 11:07:27 with some music playing
general 2021-01-23 11:08:09 why not australia-austria
general 2021-01-23 11:08:26 Combine the Austrs
general 2021-01-23 11:10:12 I'd like to joke that carrier as a basketball court
general 2021-01-23 11:24:46 Well that's Duzgun's problem now
general 2021-01-23 11:24:54 I summoned the power of the No U mirror
general 2021-01-23 11:49:25 what face
general 2021-01-23 11:50:07 I don't even know what ":v" is supposed to mean
general 2021-01-23 11:51:14 it looks more like a weird bird
general 2021-01-23 11:53:56 I was searching for Ford F-750
general 2021-01-23 11:54:05 And then I found this unit
general 2021-01-23 11:54:20 http://assets.trucktrend.com/f/32206881.jpg
general 2021-01-23 11:54:47 Why did someone turn a medium to heavy duty truck into an SUV
general 2021-01-23 11:59:10 I dunno, I just found it randomly
general 2021-01-23 11:59:38 I dunno, ask Ford why they designed it like that
general 2021-01-23 12:01:26 oh I remember when he tried to prove he wasn't copying
general 2021-01-23 12:01:33 By doing a Premier instead of a livestream
general 2021-01-23 12:01:39 And his English sucks there
general 2021-01-23 12:02:08 He's definitely too dumb to learn, but his audience is dumber for believing a premier is enough proof
general 2021-01-23 12:02:27 It's just a scheduled video post
general 2021-01-23 12:02:29 With some live chat
general 2021-01-23 12:02:48 I remember when we tried to prove it to them
general 2021-01-23 12:03:01 They believed YouTube has chat protection that's as perfect as a god
general 2021-01-23 12:03:05 When in reality, they censor every link
general 2021-01-23 12:03:19 And when they were told to go to Discord, they refused
general 2021-01-23 12:03:26 Because "pCc ToxIc"
general 2021-01-23 12:03:36 like boi there's much more toxic places than the PCC
general 2021-01-23 12:03:51 Twitter's an obvious place
general 2021-01-23 12:06:40 I don't even know what that place is
general 2021-01-23 12:07:05 Oh
general 2021-01-23 12:07:09 I'm happy in Rickjeland
general 2021-01-23 12:07:24 this is rickjeland
general 2021-01-23 12:08:08 I did the cab of trucc
general 2021-01-23 12:08:17 Now to make the place where I put stuff
general 2021-01-23 12:08:19 And after that, make it fly
general 2021-01-23 12:08:27 then collecc my bobux
general 2021-01-23 12:12:14 someone remind me why I'm building this other than for rbk's bobux
general 2021-01-23 12:18:09 ah yes

AV-8B "Matador"

It's definitely not Harrier
general 2021-01-23 12:18:12 Nope, never existed
general 2021-01-23 12:19:26 He's saying that by hating his builds, he's hating Thai people
general 2021-01-23 12:19:41 That's like me hating Zuckerberg means I hate the whole of America
general 2021-01-23 12:20:34 also

"English Harrier from Thailand"

I can't tell if he's saying that Harriers were from Thailand or if he's saying it's Bri'ish
general 2021-01-23 12:21:31 I'm fine with if someone were to use someone else's mechanism, as long as they give credit
general 2021-01-23 12:21:43 Like if it's supposed to be shown off
general 2021-01-23 12:21:49 But if it's copying a build, that's a no-no
general 2021-01-23 12:22:38 It's just a truck just so I can get rbk's bobux, though I did used the Ford F-750/650 as a reference/guide
general 2021-01-23 12:23:25 honestly it's ugly
general 2021-01-23 12:23:27 but that's fine
general 2021-01-23 12:23:35 rbk never said I had to win
general 2021-01-23 12:23:44 he just said in <#504718138399522832> to make something that isn't a plane
general 2021-01-23 12:24:02 yes
general 2021-01-23 12:24:21 Just enough effort so that it isn't looking too desparate
general 2021-01-23 12:26:53 I mean flying cars don't sound as farfetched as a spaceship
general 2021-01-23 12:28:36 Technically a flying car already exists
general 2021-01-23 12:29:26 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_CLR
general 2021-01-23 12:29:29 I was referring to this
general 2021-01-23 12:29:41 The car that keeps flying off the track
general 2021-01-23 12:29:45 For some reason
general 2021-01-23 12:29:48 Literally lifts off
general 2021-01-23 12:30:20 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Mercedes-Benz_CLR_rear_2009_Nurburgring.jpg
general 2021-01-23 12:30:22 also large fenders
general 2021-01-23 12:31:14 I mean to be fair

Cars in Le Mans are kinda like a pancake
general 2021-01-23 12:32:31 oh
general 2021-01-23 12:32:41 I was about to show the Peugeot 908
general 2021-01-23 12:33:03 but the name
general 2021-01-23 12:33:05 it's funni
general 2021-01-23 12:34:40 I'll show you an early design of the Peugeot 908, with an obvious clue in the image as to why the name of the car is funni
general 2021-01-23 12:34:41 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Peugeot_908.jpg
general 2021-01-23 12:35:09 An early design of the Peugeot 908
general 2021-01-23 12:35:37 I mean to be fair it's an early design, now look at the rear section and tell me if there's somethign funni there
general 2021-01-23 12:36:29 I mean Pegueot did get featured on Forza Motorsport 4
general 2021-01-23 12:36:49 Look behind the V12 lettering, it's right past Xbox
general 2021-01-23 12:37:25 I hate Discord's slow upload times
general 2021-01-23 12:37:32 anyways here's the final design
general 2021-01-23 12:37:47 as you can see, it's a pancake
general 2021-01-23 12:37:48 of a car
general 2021-01-23 12:40:23 <@!403843930543882241> did you see the funni, or do I have to highlight it
general 2021-01-23 12:42:14 no not intakes
general 2021-01-23 12:46:56 fishe monke
general 2021-01-23 12:48:33 what is that ugly blocky thing
general 2021-01-23 12:48:44 it looks like that one crappy "ssto" I found
general 2021-01-23 12:50:19 I tried to find the abomination I was comparing it to

They deleted it.
general 2021-01-23 12:50:25 So here's the closest you'll get https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/800981357210763274
general 2021-01-23 12:50:34 Basically imagine that blocky monstrosity, but even uglier
general 2021-01-23 12:51:08 Combine blockiness with the body being a literal block, wing spam but the wings are tiny and rocket spam at the back
general 2021-01-23 12:51:26 Like imagine an uglier space shuttle but the nose is almost non-existent
general 2021-01-23 12:51:43 we like your cheese
general 2021-01-23 12:52:21 but here's the best cheese
general 2021-01-23 12:52:22 https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gRgBRfJ0dfA/maxresdefault.jpg
general 2021-01-23 12:52:59 why is a villager stalking cheese
general 2021-01-23 12:53:21 Now how do I ruin this
general 2021-01-23 12:53:27 This convo with cheeses
general 2021-01-23 12:53:30 H m m m
general 2021-01-23 12:54:10 on second thought I don't wanna harm someone's eyes today
general 2021-01-23 12:54:25 I regret going on DDG just to double check if it's safe
general 2021-01-23 12:54:57 I was about to say something furry related
general 2021-01-23 12:55:11 Basically, we call a certain fictional species cheese
general 2021-01-23 12:55:36 A fictional species called Sergals
general 2021-01-23 12:56:20 Considering it's furry content

If you are curious, please turn safe search on
general 2021-01-23 12:56:30 I already have hurt enough of peoples' eyes with aeromrophs
general 2021-01-23 12:57:07 yes that's why I told you to do safe search
general 2021-01-23 12:57:19 I am not liable for whath happens beyond that
general 2021-01-23 12:59:39 I wonder how many retinas have I killed
general 2021-01-23 13:02:58 In that case

A Volkswagen Golf isn't the same car as the Volkswagen Citi Golf since one of them is made for South Africa only
general 2021-01-23 13:03:11 Even though the Citi Golf is literally no different from an early gen Volkswagen Golf
general 2021-01-23 13:04:08 Would you rather

Have dorito food or have dorito bomber
general 2021-01-23 13:04:51 Did Jack Northrop really have an addiction to flying wings?
general 2021-01-23 13:05:20 "moose girl"

you know what would be worse
general 2021-01-23 13:05:23 calling them femboi moose
general 2021-01-23 13:06:06 <@!403843930543882241> how would you feel being called a femboi moose/goose
general 2021-01-23 13:06:21 free food is free food
general 2021-01-23 13:06:26 if it ain't expired, then consume
general 2021-01-23 13:08:02 that guy needs more time spent here
general 2021-01-23 13:08:12 to show that what you're doing is pretty tame
general 2021-01-23 13:08:36 There had been worse here
general 2021-01-23 13:08:43 Like the VC incident
general 2021-01-23 13:09:11 I have no idea what even is in anime
general 2021-01-23 13:09:20 My dad knows more anime than me
general 2021-01-23 13:10:02 ah

so simpsons but it's actually simp on
general 2021-01-23 13:10:49 what's the difference
general 2021-01-23 13:10:59 oh I've watched that
general 2021-01-23 13:11:02 since childhood
general 2021-01-23 13:11:21 girl gets literally spirited away
general 2021-01-23 13:11:34 parent become ~~capitalist~~ pig
general 2021-01-23 13:11:43 girl encounters dragon boy
general 2021-01-23 13:11:54 girl also works for a rich grandmother
general 2021-01-23 13:11:59 with a big-ass baby
general 2021-01-23 13:12:30 girl gets real and returns with not pig parents
general 2021-01-23 13:12:54 the end

that is oversimplification 101
general 2021-01-23 13:13:20 mmm I wish I could get their bobux
general 2021-01-23 13:13:33 i feel sleepy
general 2021-01-23 13:27:42 what about american?
general 2021-01-23 13:29:41 what's next
general 2021-01-23 13:29:53 after bri'ish and murican
general 2021-01-23 13:35:17 okay femboi moose
general 2021-01-23 13:38:06 Don't forget

You keep dying from me
general 2021-01-23 13:40:35 GLaDOS keeps being in death/near-death because of Chell
general 2021-01-23 13:43:27 what build?
general 2021-01-23 13:44:16 i like your container
general 2021-01-23 13:44:18 so get an upvote
general 2021-01-23 13:45:16 people like what they like

I wouldn't mind seeing a meme getting designer if it's well-executed
general 2021-01-23 13:45:32 That container covered in oil thing would've worked only in winter
general 2021-01-23 13:45:40 Because snow is technically water
general 2021-01-23 13:46:08 I don't really consider it to be a meme
general 2021-01-23 13:46:19 I find it to be more on the neat side
general 2021-01-23 13:49:15 Hmm, maybe ask for a consensus by the community
general 2021-01-23 13:49:27 So if obc were to judge again, maybe he'd reconsider?
general 2021-01-23 13:50:08 then post when obc is sleep
general 2021-01-23 13:50:19 fair point
general 2021-01-23 13:50:26 i mean you could say that also
general 2021-01-23 13:52:43 I could see the effort in having to push it all the way there
general 2021-01-23 13:53:14 I know you can spawn at the airport
general 2021-01-23 13:53:44 What I wanna know though is how did he manage to put those inside
general 2021-01-23 13:54:08 not the pushing but the contents of it
general 2021-01-23 13:54:52 actually nvm I could just imagine he manually pushed some half wedges inside the thing
general 2021-01-23 13:55:47 shame

it was a pretty neat build ngl
general 2021-01-23 13:56:33 I might just build something quick to motivate myself
general 2021-01-23 13:57:19 I think I'm gonna go put something in the airport
general 2021-01-24 00:49:42 What did I walk into
general 2021-01-24 00:50:04 I thought this was the dump
general 2021-01-24 00:50:45 Ah yes, Dyno is cool
general 2021-01-24 00:51:00 Crap
general 2021-01-24 00:51:13 Shit

general 2021-01-24 00:52:15 Yes, Joe Mama owns a Super Guppy
general 2021-01-24 00:52:27 What else does Joe Mama own

general 2021-01-24 11:41:51 That's subtraction

general 2021-01-24 11:45:56 This is division

general 2021-01-24 11:46:04 10 divided by 2 is equals to 5
general 2021-01-24 22:49:08 What happens if you place a Koenigsegg engine onto a propeller based plane

general 2021-01-25 01:01:57 A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
general 2021-01-25 01:02:08 You know the game and we're gonna play it
general 2021-01-25 01:03:46 I'll go build a heli
general 2021-01-25 01:21:21 I just realized something

I have no experience with helicopters
general 2021-01-25 04:12:09 That implies you run away from your mother
general 2021-01-25 04:15:51 gae

general 2021-01-25 04:17:43 wait so he's 13, and he gets thigh pics of what now?
general 2021-01-25 04:18:20 You're 13, don't do that
general 2021-01-25 04:18:57 The most I can ignore is someone finding one of those NSFW anime sites, beyond that I don't like where it's going
general 2021-01-25 04:19:24 Yes, "child loving" is illegal
general 2021-01-25 04:20:03 A minor being NSFW irl is gonna screw up their already screwed up perception of reality
general 2021-01-25 04:20:51 Why legs though, that's oddly specific
general 2021-01-25 04:21:22 I don't like it, that doesn't sound good
general 2021-01-25 04:21:36 irl legs = no
anime legs = fine just keep it to yourself
general 2021-01-25 04:25:25 I don't like this

general 2021-01-25 04:57:06 of theirs
general 2021-01-25 04:57:10 to see how atrocious it is
general 2021-01-25 04:58:35 I've seen worse, but I only judged from thumbnail
general 2021-01-25 04:58:56 Well, it's a place

general 2021-01-25 05:02:55 ah, it's dead
general 2021-01-25 05:03:03 eunsuwu pissed on it
general 2021-01-25 05:04:17 So far FireyOblivion's aircraft tutorial isn't that bad
general 2021-01-25 05:05:31 No it's <@!738702049113538600> territory
general 2021-01-25 05:05:37 Femboy cat territory
general 2021-01-25 05:05:55 no it's territowory
general 2021-01-25 05:07:16 <@!347182144873037824> what's atrocious?

general 2021-01-25 05:09:10 wait does that actually work on unde infested games?
general 2021-01-25 05:09:22 ***n o m***
general 2021-01-25 05:09:25 yumi donut
general 2021-01-25 05:13:36 Thanks for the advice
general 2021-01-25 05:13:47 What games did you test it on
general 2021-01-25 05:13:59 ow my face
general 2021-01-25 05:14:30 🛡️
general 2021-01-25 05:14:32 punch metal
general 2021-01-25 05:14:51 oh no i've been falcon punched
general 2021-01-25 05:15:38 💥🦶
general 2021-01-25 05:15:44 explosive kick
general 2021-01-25 05:16:11 I took your atrocious thing seriously
general 2021-01-25 05:16:43 O h
general 2021-01-25 05:16:45 I misread that
general 2021-01-25 05:16:46 Badly
general 2021-01-25 05:16:52 🪞
general 2021-01-25 05:22:22 -0
general 2021-01-25 05:27:20 but it's negative
general 2021-01-25 05:29:23 but it's a negative integer overflow so it becomes positive
general 2021-01-25 05:29:36 meaning your score is the <insert bits>-bit limit
general 2021-01-25 05:33:10 I think I should relearn making aircraft
general 2021-01-25 05:33:18 So my build quality is less poob
general 2021-01-25 05:35:57 That one still used super rockets
general 2021-01-25 05:36:06 My current ones like any inertia at all
general 2021-01-25 05:36:13 Since they're fully dependent on a single conveyor drive
general 2021-01-25 05:37:01 I do probably need to make them *look* better though
general 2021-01-25 05:37:17 They're crap in looks, but in technical stuff, decent
general 2021-01-25 05:41:15 I should go figure out two things
- Better looks
- Maintaining "inertia"
general 2021-01-25 05:41:52 Of course I'll do that, though maintaining inertia would be neat when trying to pull off some maneuvers like the Cobra
general 2021-01-25 05:43:11 Just improving on planes in general
general 2021-01-25 05:43:19 Everything I build looks like crap
general 2021-01-25 05:43:44 Have you seen every plane I built?
general 2021-01-25 05:43:55 go to <#384025409945337856> and search my name
general 2021-01-25 05:44:06 You'll see the way I build
general 2021-01-25 05:44:28 And how it went from super shitty to decent crap
general 2021-01-25 05:46:01 see it's bad
general 2021-01-25 05:47:53 I looked through stuff
general 2021-01-25 05:47:54 I remember this
general 2021-01-25 05:47:55 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/497142796961054721/791942598918406154/RobloxScreenShot20201225_161652895.png
general 2021-01-25 05:48:03 the pancake fighter I made
general 2021-01-25 05:48:17 stelth pancake
general 2021-01-25 05:48:27 I could make up in paint
general 2021-01-25 05:48:44 Try to make an F-22, but make it as flat as possible
general 2021-01-25 05:49:35 I remember seeing a Japanese spider crab and a freaky tentacle monster fighting there
general 2021-01-25 05:50:01 It's fun when people are being the big dumb
general 2021-01-25 05:50:19 that too
general 2021-01-25 05:51:12 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/627195143040139264/760300661656518697
this is the kind of stuff that puts my builds to shame
general 2021-01-25 05:52:00 unless you're someone like miner
general 2021-01-25 05:53:10 I mean I'd be impressed of myself if I can manage to make something look unusually accurate
general 2021-01-25 05:53:14 puri
general 2021-01-25 05:53:21 do you consider a flying truck eligible for contest? <@!335599526414909451>
general 2021-01-25 05:53:52 since you made the contest
general 2021-01-25 05:54:26 Just recently, made for contest with rbk's thing considered in mind
general 2021-01-25 05:54:32 The "free bobux if not plane"
general 2021-01-25 05:55:17 Because of course I'd go 🤑 if I heard free bobux
general 2021-01-25 05:55:31 Why would I pass up free stuff
general 2021-01-25 05:56:18 Well, I posted screenshots of me building it a bunch of times here in general
general 2021-01-25 05:56:39 But the finished product is in contest chat
general 2021-01-25 05:57:22 you're right about that
general 2021-01-25 05:58:13 But eh, a build's a build. It's shitty though
general 2021-01-25 05:58:52 yes

now gib bobux
general 2021-01-25 05:59:22 yes that's why I joined
general 2021-01-25 05:59:46 Otherwise, I just relax when building
general 2021-01-25 05:59:49 And don't really hurry
general 2021-01-25 06:00:53 I wonder what else I should do to get free bobux
general 2021-01-25 06:02:31 i am money'nt
general 2021-01-25 06:02:39 That's why I'm finding other ways of not bobuxn't
general 2021-01-25 06:03:19 I'm told to s t u d y and learn useless skills in summer like swimming
general 2021-01-25 06:04:03 Ha! If only they weren't also cheap
general 2021-01-25 06:04:24 - me needs phone
- gives fragile plastic body phone that barely survives stress
general 2021-01-25 06:04:46 It's not like I'm gonna do some competitive swimming
general 2021-01-25 06:05:01 I'm glad Covid prevented that
general 2021-01-25 06:05:20 Parent go "working student bad"
general 2021-01-25 06:05:47 Parent go "developer doesn't make money even though I know nothing about how independent devs make money"
general 2021-01-25 06:06:34 That's my idea, but only in Roblox
general 2021-01-25 06:06:44 oh well Roblox is good opportunity to learn how to be big scammer
general 2021-01-25 06:06:57 I can apply that when earning real monies in Google's Play Store
general 2021-01-25 06:07:07 that's good
general 2021-01-25 06:07:11 btw, what was Leon's game
general 2021-01-25 06:07:31 Of course it'd be a simulator
general 2021-01-25 06:07:37 Because simulators are popular
general 2021-01-25 06:08:19 also those vibe places and other random stuff like "bunker.jpeg" seems to be doing fine too
general 2021-01-25 06:08:43 Vibe, it's just meh
general 2021-01-25 06:08:54 But bunker.jpeg, they neat
general 2021-01-25 06:08:57 Those kinds of games are neat
general 2021-01-25 06:09:09 hmmyes
general 2021-01-25 06:10:15 Speaking of games
general 2021-01-25 06:10:33 I should also ask my little brother for research in what kids like nowadays
general 2021-01-25 06:12:43 He doesn't like that game
general 2021-01-25 06:13:03 *though I should be concerned he doesn't mind furry stuff*
general 2021-01-25 06:13:20 I blame Changed or whatever that goo game is
general 2021-01-25 06:13:49 he is not yet ready for degeneracy
general 2021-01-25 06:13:53 Also I don't show him that crap
general 2021-01-25 06:14:14 Around 10-11
general 2021-01-25 06:16:17 You have Creations Blacklist
general 2021-01-25 06:16:25 You can't
general 2021-01-25 06:20:03 why is it so big
general 2021-01-25 06:25:36 imagine being an oxymoron
general 2021-01-25 06:27:40 what about the -stan countries
general 2021-01-25 06:28:12 What if we make Weebistan, land of the weebs
general 2021-01-25 06:29:39 A place abounding in <insert>
general 2021-01-25 06:30:06 A place abounding in weebs/furries/Dream

general 2021-01-25 07:02:49 <@!642151786966286348>'s lignum vitae wood
general 2021-01-25 07:03:18 Fun Fact: Lignum Vitae is the hardest wood
general 2021-01-25 07:03:25 Literally
general 2021-01-25 07:04:19 <@!642151786966286348> Are you made out of Balsa or Lignum Vitae?
general 2021-01-25 07:05:40 boi there's someone named pp
general 2021-01-25 07:06:20 That <@!509895178576723972> doesn't belong here
general 2021-01-25 07:06:34 Because puri explore body to make you go die
general 2021-01-25 07:06:39 He is actually doctor
general 2021-01-25 07:06:44 A surgeon to be specific
general 2021-01-25 07:06:57 Surgeon puri will make you die
general 2021-01-25 07:22:41 I just joined because bobux
general 2021-01-25 07:22:57 Me actually joining a contest for the sake of building is another thing
general 2021-01-25 07:23:01 Ask rbk
general 2021-01-25 07:23:26 Is that how much rbk paid
general 2021-01-25 07:23:31 Well, free bobux is still bobux
general 2021-01-25 07:23:57 I wanted to join a contest for the sake of building, I should improve on building first
general 2021-01-25 07:24:59 Now send him spiders
general 2021-01-25 07:25:31 Label it as gummy worms
general 2021-01-25 07:26:08 Gummy bear*
general 2021-01-25 07:26:20 Bullet ants
general 2021-01-25 07:27:09 <@!347182144873037824> Put these in a pair of clothing
general 2021-01-25 07:27:11 Pants for extra damage
general 2021-01-25 07:28:36 Take the phrase "ants in one's pants" literally
general 2021-01-25 07:28:50 That's me
general 2021-01-25 07:34:34 React if not poob
general 2021-01-25 07:35:06 Give me some good vehicle builders to learn building techniques from
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 07:36:15 give me some good aircraft builders in pcc
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 07:36:21 land vehicles are also fine
general 2021-01-25 07:36:50 A merry can
general 2021-01-25 07:37:07 wait I thought you were ***d e u t s c h***
general 2021-01-25 07:37:53 also

***A m e r i c a n   P o l i t i c s***
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 07:38:50 Names of people

I should get better at building
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 07:39:02 yes of course you
general 2021-01-25 07:48:35 London? Poob name, I know something better

general 2021-01-25 07:49:44 Yes
general 2021-01-25 07:51:00 I will go release a "hack"
general 2021-01-25 07:51:48 okay in the dump since it's too long
the-dump 2021-01-25 07:51:54 Full name of Titin
the-dump 2021-01-25 07:54:47 hmm still too long
the-dump 2021-01-25 07:56:20 actually no
the-dump 2021-01-25 07:56:23 too long even for me
the-dump 2021-01-25 07:56:31 I'll just do it on another server
general 2021-01-25 11:08:09 What's the suggestion?
general 2021-01-25 11:08:52 I remember suggesting to make builds scalable

Basically, imagine very detailed but very big car, now imagine it being smaller
general 2021-01-25 11:08:56 yes
general 2021-01-25 11:31:57 <@!521458738981502987>
general 2021-01-25 11:32:17 I just saw this at the last second

general 2021-01-25 11:35:14 Excuse me what
general 2021-01-25 11:35:29 are you going to use that on a car or something
general 2021-01-25 11:36:03 Is that supposed to be some Mercedes-Benz Silver Lightning kind of tire?
general 2021-01-25 11:37:06 https://assets.wallpapersin4k.org/uploads/2017/04/Mercedes-Benz-Silver-Lightning-Wallpaper-2.jpg
general 2021-01-25 11:37:10 look at this hot wheels car
general 2021-01-25 11:37:36 That circle PlaneCrazyTanks made reminds me of that for some reason
general 2021-01-25 11:37:46 It looks like a Hot Wheels car
general 2021-01-25 11:38:14 What do you think?

general 2021-01-25 11:41:41 It's a glorified Hot Wheels car

2.) Use reference images, or blueprints

3.) Never build shredders

As for the lens part, ask them. All I know is that it's clever manipulation of the way glass is rendered
creations-chat 2021-01-26 04:52:18 Looking at your F-15, the shaders look nice but the aircraft itself kinda feels incomplete. Like it feels it could be done a bit better in some areas
general 2021-01-26 04:53:09 What if we get a pro builder like miner to use shaders while taking a picture of stuff

general 2021-01-27 01:41:01 https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/main_images/f4phantomjetpreparingtotakeoff.jpg I was looking at this image

general 2021-01-27 01:41:19 So I proceeded to do it
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 01:48:52 Why do you need the canopy to be open?
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 01:50:30 You do get extra upvotes for details
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 01:51:00 Which is why people make their jets medium sized

Also I don't like that thing's head lights
creations-chat 2021-01-27 02:36:26 You pointed them out

You sound like a company denying their failures
general 2021-01-27 13:08:42 boi it's not even that long
general 2021-01-27 13:08:59 You think nobody would notice everything else
general 2021-01-27 13:10:01 The point of listing bad things is so that the flaws can be pointed out without having to type out an essay
general 2021-01-27 13:11:12 Hmm, so that's why something felt off. His wings were just two convex curves
general 2021-01-27 13:12:02 Let's just agree to eat up what others have to say and use it to improve
general 2021-01-27 13:13:45 Just someone not taking the criticism he already received, and instead complaining about it also
general 2021-01-27 13:19:20 I see a problem here

You can't make everything have a sprinkle of sugar of top. If people simply can't find anything good about it, then they won't say it. People just don't work the way you want them to be

Motor locking isn't a hard skill to learn, I recommend you look up Just Rens or Prototrode's tutorials for them

Yes, nobody starts good but they improved because they took anything people had to say about what they built, even if it's purely negative, took the advice of others and did their effort to learn the techniques others use.
general 2021-01-27 13:19:54 Why are you being a baby about it
general 2021-01-27 13:20:28 To be fair though, I was busy looking at that one specific message

But let's assume it was added
general 2021-01-27 13:29:31 What kind of stuff would they end up building
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 13:46:28 
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 13:46:32 Everything is going fine so far
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 13:46:39 I'll go take a break now
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 13:47:40 nah it's an f-35

do not compare a ***f i n e c h o n k e r*** to that hideous flying thing that people love
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 13:48:50 nah the f-22 is too thin for that
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 13:49:01 F-35 better since it's chonker
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 13:50:15 The default in-game beige is more appropriate if it's supposed to be tan
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 13:51:09 What aircraft is that anyways
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 13:52:52 https://drawingdatabase.com/mikoyan-gurevich-mig-21/ I found this, if it helps
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 13:53:13 Oh, that's what I'm trying to practice in improving my build quality
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 13:53:37 I mean the two aren't really that much different
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 13:53:59 Just adjust accordingly for any small differences the two has
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 13:55:46 Apparently Wikipedia says it's a better Mig-21
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 13:56:12 Too bad it was made too late
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 13:56:29 So it was outdated by the time issues with production was solved
general 2021-01-27 13:57:21 Is the F-4 Phantom already overbuilt here
general 2021-01-27 13:58:40 I did a reverse image search and apparently that's Midnight Club 2, so let's narrow it down there

plane-crazy 2021-01-28 04:03:29 I only have one
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 04:06:47 If you want t h i c c wings, use whole blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 04:06:57 Like a full block, full wedges, etc.
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 04:07:05 Then motor lock wing panels on it so it can still produce lift
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 04:07:17 ~~or control panels if you're a masochist like me~~
general 2021-01-28 04:07:49 That's a fact in the Gamer Thailand Discord

general 2021-01-28 04:13:55 I'll go check
general 2021-01-28 04:14:36 Yet another rocket that everyone has already built
general 2021-01-28 04:17:51 Let me be specific with the rocket

Just like the US's 5th generation fighter jets, people have overbuilt it which means if you want it to be good, you better make it stand out (usually by giving it a good amount of details)

It honestly looks pretty basic, it's like if you put a hotdog on a stand. Rockets are one of the things you have to take time and really put your heart into it, alongside shipbuilding
general 2021-01-28 04:18:37 Let's take the A-10 Warthog for example, it's overbuilt but if you really worked hard you can get it to be good, just like the one in <#627195143040139264>

general 2021-01-28 04:47:49 Well, it's not that hard. Here's what I got so far on my F-4 Phantom
general 2021-01-28 04:48:08 It just takes some creativity

general 2021-01-28 06:58:57 Excuse me what
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 11:34:13 Apart from canopy framing, the front section seems to be good enough for basic prototyping
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 11:34:54 Now to move onto the rear section, than after that some camo practice and then finally refining the aircraft itself
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 11:35:08 You're correct
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 11:35:49 Fine chonker with them anhedral wing tips

the-dump 2021-01-29 02:42:22 Eunsoo is more suited for that since he actually uses uwu and owo

plane-crazy 2021-01-29 04:18:34 https://streamable.com/mpcqbu why is this not working as intended
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 04:18:50 One elevator works perfectly fine but the other just struggles
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 04:20:54 still the same even when angled
general 2021-01-29 04:21:29 Motor 2s are now really broken for me
general 2021-01-29 04:21:58 https://streamable.com/mpcqbu
general 2021-01-29 04:22:21 Both elevators
general 2021-01-29 04:22:29 Also the torque is set to max
general 2021-01-29 04:28:52 yes

because people are people, jsut hope for the best
general 2021-01-29 04:29:30 I mean if he wants to get warned again it's his choice
general 2021-01-29 04:30:51 Yes

I mean motor 2 elevators aren't working for me right so
general 2021-01-29 04:31:18 what did they do
general 2021-01-29 04:32:39 why am I losing motivation
general 2021-01-29 04:32:44 I wanna finish this but I'm getting lazy
general 2021-01-29 04:33:16 also nose is ugly
general 2021-01-29 04:33:29 The fuselage, I guess it's decent
general 2021-01-29 04:33:37 But I don't want the nose to be a boxy diamond
general 2021-01-29 04:33:51 I prefer c u r v e s than s m o o t h n e s s
general 2021-01-29 04:34:12 <@!347182144873037824> femboi

general 2021-01-29 04:35:13 Goodbye ***femboi*** <@!347182144873037824>
general 2021-01-29 04:35:36 I seriously need a better nose
general 2021-01-29 04:35:52 me:
general 2021-01-29 04:37:17 I need "research" so I can build a better aircraft nose
general 2021-01-29 04:39:43 I wonder if there are airlienrs in the server that are both really hella large without weird boxy diamond nose
general 2021-01-29 04:41:24 You can probably tell I'm not a fan of not curvy noses
general 2021-01-29 04:41:29 They just look so unaerodynamic for me
general 2021-01-29 04:42:16 Which is why I ended up using this ugly ass nose
general 2021-01-29 04:42:38 <@!265819387498332160> So when you said radial engine motor locking, basically like custom exhausts but on a larger scale?
general 2021-01-29 04:53:12 what if we purify <@!265819387498332160> 
and put mud in <@!335599526414909451>
general 2021-01-29 04:53:26 do it
general 2021-01-29 04:55:37 How do you people manage to be so creative and motivated
general 2021-01-29 04:56:01 What is that, that Club Iris game or whatever it's called
general 2021-01-29 04:57:00 Ah, so basically it's a game about who gets the most simps?
general 2021-01-29 04:58:48 How to get easy simps

1.) Get not terrifyingly realistic parts
2.) Thiccify
3.) "Expose"

Or at least that's how I expect it would go there
general 2021-01-29 04:59:02 No you're not funny
general 2021-01-29 04:59:03 Youre-

general 2021-01-29 04:59:52 What if I don't want to so you get hurt
general 2021-01-29 04:59:59 tell me how

general 2021-01-29 05:07:17 How often do arguments happen when someone doesn't get HoF
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 06:12:07 So that was the problem you people were talking about
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 06:12:12 what's that
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 06:13:04 Unlocked, it looks confusing
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 06:13:06 But otherwise fine
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 06:13:28 ricke must fixe the motore twoe
general 2021-01-29 06:13:59 no that's not the appropriate reaction

plane-crazy 2021-01-29 11:09:53 What do I do if a motor 2 decides to instead of smoothly going up and down, it shakes
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 11:20:18 https://streamable.com/gmj9ea
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 11:20:23 Why must this not work
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 11:20:53 Even though the elvators are essentially just mirror copies
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 11:21:54 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 11:22:34 2
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 11:22:37 Torque 1000
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 11:22:42 Max angle 45
general 2021-01-29 11:26:13 I don't think I can continue the Phantom if motor 2s are too broken to work with
general 2021-01-29 11:26:18 Elevators just die
general 2021-01-29 11:27:07 I'll just do what Pepsiman said
general 2021-01-29 11:27:38 Besides "normal" motors aren't viable for control surfaces
general 2021-01-29 11:27:48 Nor do I wanna do control surface spam on elevators
general 2021-01-29 11:28:04 I usually only reserve them on the main wings, where it isn't as obvious
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 11:30:01 Tell me when motor 2s are fixed and I'll continue this
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 11:34:04 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 11:34:08 Because I suck at building
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 11:34:16 So, the best thing to do is improve at building
general 2021-01-29 11:34:49 😳
general 2021-01-29 11:35:02 Dang, Poland really has big guns
general 2021-01-29 11:35:37 What if
general 2021-01-29 11:35:43 We separate undes from 13+
general 2021-01-29 11:35:53 ~~because honestly they're a pain in the arse~~

general 2021-01-29 11:38:46 wait is this considered a tank
general 2021-01-29 11:38:52 this looks more like an armored car
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 11:39:52 The fact that I get more performance out of 2014 budget hardware means something is clearly wrong with yours
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 11:40:30 What have you been downloading recently anyways
general 2021-01-29 11:41:33 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAMzOwBYlqo ah yes

general 2021-01-29 11:41:42 When it looks more like some body panels popped off
general 2021-01-29 11:42:19 <@!467765396108476426> So Vungi, what did you do when you first started using Roblox Studio
general 2021-01-29 11:43:06 I mean it's not really a meme
general 2021-01-29 11:43:08 OR a shitpost
general 2021-01-29 11:43:28 So basically, just fuck around with the Studio up until you feel comfortable enough to take it seriously
general 2021-01-29 11:43:50 okay, I'm just gonna mess around with free models
general 2021-01-29 11:43:55 And see what I can do
general 2021-01-29 11:44:00 To make a mix and mash of a game
general 2021-01-29 11:44:16 What matters is that I become EA
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 12:45:29 Drawing Database
general 2021-01-29 12:46:26 Did the 4-Series always had this tall of a grill?

general 2021-01-29 12:47:05 why is BMW grill so unusually large
general 2021-01-29 12:47:31 I always misread it as "Denim MC"
general 2021-01-29 12:48:32 ah yes

because apparently that's a strategy Italy used
general 2021-01-29 12:48:51 Knowing Italy, they definitely won't do that unless you're funni bald guy
general 2021-01-29 12:49:18 Does a straw has two holes or one hole
general 2021-01-29 12:49:53 The only answer that convinced me it's one
general 2021-01-29 12:49:55 Is
general 2021-01-29 12:50:10 That a straw is the same as a really deep circle
general 2021-01-29 12:50:46 If it goes straight through, it probably isn't enough to convince me otherwise
general 2021-01-29 12:51:02 I'm more convinced by "a circle with lots of depth"
general 2021-01-29 12:53:17 That's because you're something else

general 2021-01-29 13:00:38 I just use ropes to make it not become a glorified jelly
general 2021-01-29 13:02:10 I wonder if undes actually donate
general 2021-01-29 13:02:15 well donate bobux
general 2021-01-29 13:03:53 do you people think undes will donate bobux
general 2021-01-29 13:04:25 wait what does 3 and 4 mean
general 2021-01-29 13:05:51 o h

they want m o n e y
general 2021-01-29 13:06:38 So undes simp for girl avatars right?
general 2021-01-29 13:08:33 are you serious or are you joking
general 2021-01-29 13:12:01 If only there was a dark mode Roblox theme where the text also doesn't go d a r k
general 2021-01-29 13:12:14 Roblox Studio
general 2021-01-29 13:12:36 I don't like how dark this text is
general 2021-01-29 13:12:44 well the comments anyways
general 2021-01-29 13:12:52 The text is fine though it feels like it doesn't pop enough
general 2021-01-29 13:13:14 No
general 2021-01-29 13:13:22 You think I'd have the expertise to do that
general 2021-01-29 13:13:49 Well no

I'm completely new to Studio
general 2021-01-29 13:15:00 It's 9:14 though
general 2021-01-29 13:15:12 I'm also forgetful
general 2021-01-29 13:15:26 Should I still continue Python or just go straight ahead to Lua
general 2021-01-29 13:15:33 I barely progressed
general 2021-01-29 13:17:38 I'm just gonna go read if I can edit text colors, the one thing I liked about VS Code and NP++
general 2021-01-29 13:47:16 I spent time with Blackbird
general 2021-01-29 13:47:22 Even if I look hideous
general 2021-01-29 13:47:58 I have the curse of the 2014 budget hardware
general 2021-01-29 13:48:13 That somehow runs better than someone's gaming PC
general 2021-01-29 13:48:26 Or maybe that's just Nvidia
general 2021-01-29 13:48:38 This PC I use has AMD parts
general 2021-01-29 13:48:57 ok bye I go to the tube of videos
general 2021-01-29 13:48:59 YouTube
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 13:49:50 that tank is nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 13:49:56 a lot better than what I can do
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 13:50:00 ok now i go rest bye
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 10:20:24 Ah yes

general 2021-01-30 10:22:36 What if there's space to spawn in an actual custom base
general 2021-01-30 10:23:01 I feel braindead
general 2021-01-30 10:23:04 Very braindead
general 2021-01-30 10:23:16 I feel like doing buildings tbh
general 2021-01-30 10:52:58 There is an aircraft nicknamed the "Ass Ender"
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:31:24 h m m m
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:32:36 Nope, there's still an emoji limit
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:33:30 
general 2021-01-30 13:35:57 I wonder what game is that
general 2021-01-30 13:36:41 He wants you to Brazil him so hard that it's good
general 2021-01-30 13:36:54 To which I say, please don't
general 2021-01-30 13:36:58 I don't want more cursed PCC
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:37:35 The Italian wedge
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:38:48 A lot of sports and supercars in the 80s are wedgy aren't they
general 2021-01-30 15:19:22 Maybe I'll join the whitename trend
general 2021-01-30 15:19:26 Confusion is fun
general 2021-01-30 15:20:27 As in, SR-71
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:25:57 Yes, if it's not a custom engine
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:26:13 A jet engine is just bad in general
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:27:11 If you just want speed, just use a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:28:09 Still can't beat conveyor drives though
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:30:41 I don't even get how something that's supposed to have more power is supposed to be slower
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:31:25 That just sounds pretty illogical if you ask me
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:32:09 But planes don't have gears
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:32:18 They have weight, aerodynamics and thrust
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:33:12 They aren't slower, that just doesn't make sense on aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:34:00 Oh, so that's why 

Well I'll go shelve my F4 Phantom in the meantime then
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:35:15 They'll be fixed if Rickje could
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:35:29 But Rickje's PC is dead
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:35:32 So just wait
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:35:51 It's a furry tank
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:37:29 If catgirls are humans with animal characteristics 
And furries are animals with human characteristics 
That means we can hunt *some* anime
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:38:37 Not as bad as the day someone will build an aeromorph
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:39:11 Looks like it can still be pink and have a tail, ears are a challenge
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:39:39 Anything can be a cat girl if you're brave enough
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:40:21 Wait if furries are both human and animal, then does that mean MatiPL could be liable for homicide
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:40:57 It's 11:40 I should rest
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:42:13 Add a blushy OwO, make it pink, rope or trail tail and half wedge ears
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:42:45 11:42 PM is late
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:43:03 Unless you're using separate text
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:43:23 I'd like to see someone in PCC make a typewriter
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:43:52 Even separate text blocks?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:43:56 Oh
general 2021-01-30 15:44:30 Make a typewriter in PCC, and spell "fuck"
general 2021-01-31 09:49:31 I've done that for years
general 2021-01-31 09:50:05 Scripting is about as easy as Math 

It depends
general 2021-01-31 09:50:42 Blame school
general 2021-01-31 09:51:01 "It depends"
general 2021-01-31 09:51:34 Eunsuwu
general 2021-01-31 09:53:10 I find learning Python to be easier than Math <@632942443536318494> 

That or the school I have thinks cramming is always good
general 2021-01-31 09:53:44 ;)
general 2021-01-31 09:57:41 Which is a markup language, which I'd say is below a scripting language in terms of difficulty

general 2021-02-01 07:23:02 Just focus on l o n g

general 2021-02-01 07:24:24 The longer, the better

general 2021-02-01 07:35:36 correct
general 2021-02-01 07:37:28 Because default is kinda ugly and inconsistent anyways
general 2021-02-01 07:38:58 If there's one thing I like about MacOS, it's how UI was designed. Consistent and soft
general 2021-02-01 07:39:33 Exactly
general 2021-02-01 07:39:50 I can't exactly do XFCE styled, so MacOS will do
general 2021-02-01 07:40:38 I mean they did do UI at least better than Windows
general 2021-02-01 07:40:46 They managed to make consistent and look updated
general 2021-02-01 07:41:06 Windows has inconsistent styling and still uses legacy UI
general 2021-02-01 07:41:19 Doesn't really fit well with their "Fleunt Design"
general 2021-02-01 07:41:26 Like what's the point of doing that when you're gonna half-arse it anyways
general 2021-02-01 07:48:40 If there's one thing I want from Windows is Linux like customization

general 2021-02-02 06:19:13 To think it's rounder than it actually is
general 2021-02-02 06:20:48 There are two things that make it higher than you expect

The amount of tutorial creations available online, and people have shown that you can really pull off some impressive crap.
general 2021-02-02 06:21:12 I'm just monke who likes ***p r o f i t***
general 2021-02-02 06:23:19 Or there were less features
general 2021-02-02 06:23:33 Now that there's much more than what was previously available, the standards are also set higher
general 2021-02-02 06:24:21 No

*I rely on motors now*
general 2021-02-02 06:25:04 Just build something that looks good enough
general 2021-02-02 06:25:12 I'll go get an example
general 2021-02-02 06:26:26 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/799738797037584444 <@!358365690362855425> This is an F-4 Phantom

If it looks good, then people like it
general 2021-02-02 06:26:39 No need to be a perfectionist
general 2021-02-02 06:27:00 I suggest you learn motor locking and motor angling though
general 2021-02-02 06:27:31 I'll go find the banana
general 2021-02-02 06:28:15 it does indeed look like banan
general 2021-02-02 06:28:19 and banan is good
general 2021-02-02 06:28:22 so I give banan upvote
general 2021-02-02 06:28:38 Remember kids to eat your potassium cresents
general 2021-02-02 06:31:11 <@!358365690362855425> I saw it and it just doesn't look that good
general 2021-02-02 06:31:48 https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/f35c.jpg Here's an F-35
general 2021-02-02 06:32:10 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/803311253937848331 Here's his F-35
general 2021-02-02 06:32:24 Obvious mistake for the F-35, the main wings
general 2021-02-02 06:35:42 <@!358365690362855425> 
1.) Your main wings just look like thick straight tapered wings, not the F-35's trapezoidal wings. Same goes for elevators.

2.) Cheesegrater flaps, people don't like that. Same goes for your elevators, make them stabilators instead

3.) Tilt your rudders, and give more space between them

4.) And maybe just try learning motor locks. If you need more performance use custom flaps using motor 2s and a conveyor drive for more speed

*You have a lot more to learn*
general 2021-02-02 06:37:02 Use blueprints also
general 2021-02-02 06:37:09 And other reference images
general 2021-02-02 06:37:31 Well, detailed builds definitely use more motors than you'd expect
general 2021-02-02 06:38:21 yes
general 2021-02-02 06:39:57 Hundreds is an overstatement if you're just starting
general 2021-02-02 06:40:09 Just Rens and Prototrode have decent tutorials about motor locking
general 2021-02-02 06:40:55 That's because you're pro
general 2021-02-02 06:41:20 A simple motor locked build can just use a simple motor lock tower
general 2021-02-02 06:41:35 ~~though if you're anything like these guys, you'd get creative~~
general 2021-02-02 06:42:15 I wonder what would be a fairly easy aircraft for you to build
general 2021-02-02 06:42:43 I find the F-4 Phantom to be a moderate level one
general 2021-02-02 06:43:08 Name it, so they'll learn
general 2021-02-02 06:43:17 The irony
general 2021-02-02 06:43:23 Lockheedn't
general 2021-02-02 06:45:15 That thing couldn't get any more two dimensional without becoming an actual pancake
general 2021-02-02 06:45:58 This is a lego game, just build
general 2021-02-02 06:46:25 ~~Honestly one of the things that helped me learn is to look at other peoples' builds~~
general 2021-02-02 06:46:33 Not copy them, just learn the methods they used
general 2021-02-02 06:47:53 Ngl the only decent build I see is the lawnmower
general 2021-02-02 06:48:19 
general 2021-02-02 07:01:07 <@!499705220637392897> Since you are German

Build Eurofighter, Panavia Tornado or a fully local aircraft like a Messerschmitt
general 2021-02-02 07:01:48 then take a break, I'm not rushing you to make a german fighter
general 2021-02-02 07:03:16 you gave me a brainfart of a sentence

general 2021-02-04 04:42:07 Random question

Do you people use D/M/Y or M/D/Y
general 2021-02-04 04:42:17 When formatting dates
general 2021-02-04 04:42:47 Over here we use both
general 2021-02-04 04:44:21 "English: mmmm d, yyyy
DMY dates are also used occasionally, primarily by, but not limited to, government institutions such as on the data page of passports, and immigration and customs forms.
Filipino: ika-d ng mmmm, yyyy"

general 2021-02-04 06:55:45 make it a suggestion
general 2021-02-04 23:06:39 Finally, motor 2s work the way I expect them to
general 2021-02-04 23:06:47 I can continue work on the F-4 Phantom
general 2021-02-04 23:08:22 Still isn't perfect, that's why I'm making this attempt #1 out of #2/more

general 2021-02-05 04:59:07 Like a literal weapons fortress
general 2021-02-05 04:59:26 Depends on what kind of player you are
general 2021-02-05 05:00:22 I just make stuff
general 2021-02-05 05:00:35 I have no plans to go to PvP
general 2021-02-05 05:02:34 All I could say is gunship, close air support, air superiority or multi-role/strike fighter
general 2021-02-05 05:02:54 Thanos made that
general 2021-02-05 05:03:47 Take a Peel P50, put the Koenigseggg Gemera engine in it, do extreme weight reduction
general 2021-02-05 05:03:51 Have fun trying not to die
general 2021-02-05 05:04:50 Imagine though to put the Koenigsegg Gemera engine on a heavily modified Ariel Atom, that'd be like having a road-legal Formula 1 car
general 2021-02-05 05:06:05 Anyone know the Lola F1R
general 2021-02-05 05:07:07 Still, it's a 600hp 3 cylinder
general 2021-02-05 05:07:17 If it weighs significantly less, I'd take it
general 2021-02-05 05:07:27 Sound, probably not the best
general 2021-02-05 05:07:43 But if you're just focusing on something like making a car go fast
general 2021-02-05 05:07:47 Well I don't think it's bad
general 2021-02-05 05:10:32 I mean the company does deliver, so I wouldn't immediately doubt it
general 2021-02-05 05:13:01 Well, guess I'll just have to wait a bit to see if it's just a concept or if it'll be a real product. Though I do have hopes considering Koenigsegg's background.

I also found this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXRIEZ1qGE
general 2021-02-05 05:14:46 so wait you have an actual car
general 2021-02-05 05:16:08 I did a reverse image search

general 2021-02-05 05:19:06 I wonder if anyone how common tuned Toyotas are if used Lexus(es) get that treatment
general 2021-02-05 05:19:51 ~~lolno~~
general 2021-02-05 05:20:41 If there's something I want

It'd probably be a Mercedes, a Lexus or perhaps a Subaru or Holden
general 2021-02-05 05:21:24 Don't really need a full-on off road capable car, but a nice, comfy yet fun car is nice
general 2021-02-05 05:22:18 oh I remember the Mercedes-Benz G-Class 6x6

general 2021-02-06 04:24:16 ok fr I should go eat instead of being distracted by a tamer version of social media (PCC)
general 2021-02-06 04:24:30 So is PCC more like tamer Reddit then
general 2021-02-06 04:25:00 Cado I heard is hell, so it's more valid to compare Twitter to it
general 2021-02-06 04:25:23 I asked
general 2021-02-06 04:25:40 Then the people I asked are snowflakes then
general 2021-02-06 04:25:50 Because I don't even know whatever the hell goes on there
general 2021-02-06 04:26:30 You know what I'm getting from you two
general 2021-02-06 04:26:35 Cado sounds like Tumblr
general 2021-02-06 04:27:36 "if only you'd return"
"it ain't that"

That kinda implies it had changed a bit
general 2021-02-06 04:27:41 Which made me immediately think of Tumblr
general 2021-02-06 04:28:24 Oh I thought you were there a long time ago
general 2021-02-06 04:28:49 Honestly, I'd side with Darkzified since a majority of the people I've seen say it's bad
general 2021-02-06 04:29:28 I already have Twitter for people to be braindead
general 2021-02-06 04:30:47 This also reminds me of Twitter

People rejecting backlash
general 2021-02-06 04:31:27 You sound like you belong in the dump
general 2021-02-06 04:31:47 
general 2021-02-06 04:31:59 Technically he's stil right
general 2021-02-06 04:32:18 People are having a strong reaction
general 2021-02-06 04:32:23 Adverse, I'll let you go think
general 2021-02-06 04:33:08 Honestly Minty why are you aggressively defensive
general 2021-02-06 04:33:43 That also just sounds like people when they're on a losing side, tbh
general 2021-02-06 04:34:27 Go to <#495286269459300364> if you don't want to see two potatoes arguing whether CADO is good or bad
general 2021-02-06 04:35:57 Suddenly, whoever the CADO defender was is gone
general 2021-02-06 04:37:07 Well, it's quiet again
general 2021-02-06 04:37:11 Which is good
general 2021-02-06 04:37:37 Why yes I would like a Dodge
general 2021-02-06 04:38:49 Where may I claim my free Hellcat Redeye
general 2021-02-06 04:38:59 Because why not

Probably suspension
general 2021-02-06 04:39:27 I'm just here to build stuff
general 2021-02-06 04:39:40 The same reason I play Minecraft
general 2021-02-06 04:39:42 Build stuff
general 2021-02-06 04:39:55 And of course, screw around
general 2021-02-06 04:40:07 Another reason I like Forza Horizon
general 2021-02-06 04:41:27 Jokes aside, I'm disappointed, not even a single rope in sight
general 2021-02-06 04:41:50 Not only is it that basic, but it also is gonna end up being pretty bouncy
general 2021-02-06 04:43:02 Polish Pole polish Pole's polished Poland pole

I dunno I feel braindead
general 2021-02-06 04:43:08 Very dumb and braindead
general 2021-02-06 04:43:09 and hungry
general 2021-02-06 04:43:39 why yes that's me
general 2021-02-06 04:43:58 He's gonna add you to his heart
general 2021-02-06 04:44:01 Because he is a femboi cat
general 2021-02-06 04:44:58 your family has a terrifyingly realistic face
general 2021-02-06 13:36:08 Has anyone claimed VungieIek with two i
general 2021-02-06 13:36:44 Capital i looks like an L
general 2021-02-06 13:36:48 Small L
general 2021-02-07 03:07:53 Got the Phantom working, it's just quite buggy
general 2021-02-07 03:08:23 Actually forget about that, I forgot the landing gear
general 2021-02-07 03:13:43 It's amazing how people have flawed logic
general 2021-02-07 03:17:48 What's happening here
general 2021-02-07 03:18:20 gay liberty
general 2021-02-07 03:30:26 With a Super Why OC

general 2021-02-07 03:32:44 no shit sherlock
general 2021-02-07 03:33:03 Now let me get Protogent's mascot

general 2021-02-07 03:33:34 Literally a Super Why OC
general 2021-02-07 03:33:57 ah yes a shitpost in general
general 2021-02-07 03:36:09 I'm getting iFunny vibes from this
general 2021-02-07 03:37:03 Sir, this is why there's a dump
general 2021-02-07 03:37:09 To shit your memes there
general 2021-02-07 04:51:13 mmm motor
general 2021-02-07 04:51:25 they're a good diet
general 2021-02-07 04:51:47 I don't even have a taskbar
general 2021-02-07 04:52:26 
general 2021-02-07 04:52:41 Because I made a knock-off Mac on Windows
general 2021-02-07 04:52:56 Because I can
general 2021-02-07 04:53:04 It's not like there's anything from stopping me
general 2021-02-07 04:53:21 yes
general 2021-02-07 04:53:45 but otherwise, the answer is because I can
general 2021-02-07 04:54:09 the pcc being the pcc as usual
general 2021-02-07 04:54:25 always weird and braindead
general 2021-02-07 04:55:04 ok this is getting old now
general 2021-02-07 04:55:56 About as stale as a wet fart
general 2021-02-07 04:56:26 Let's-a go
general 2021-02-07 04:56:58 That nobody asked
general 2021-02-07 04:57:49 s t e a l t h
general 2021-02-07 04:58:46 Since when did PCC went from ranked braindead to unranked braindead
general 2021-02-07 05:00:23 <@!536803160707170310> You barely did anything other than slightly change the front and gave it a paintjob
general 2021-02-07 05:00:49 Not only that but it's also a tutorial, meaning you had a complete thing to begin with
general 2021-02-07 05:02:23 If you wanna be seen as actually doing effort, try doing without a tutorial. Blueprints are fine if you're planning to recreate a real life vehicle, but not tutorials
general 2021-02-07 05:02:46 People here have done pretty much fine without tutorials, actually even better without them
general 2021-02-07 05:04:01 And that is why people don't like tutorials
general 2021-02-07 05:04:19 this ^
general 2021-02-07 05:04:38 Okay, understandable
general 2021-02-07 05:04:59 That's the A-10 Warthog, it has a deadly gun that go fart
general 2021-02-07 05:06:26 People here can get very detailed with builds
general 2021-02-07 05:08:31 If your build doesn't have an angled <:IntendedFeature:706289545548660746> get off my timeline.
general 2021-02-07 05:09:08 good chaos
general 2021-02-07 05:09:12 better chaos
general 2021-02-07 05:10:38 Motor lock, no I didn't at first
How to build a moving thing? I mean I built a VTOL fighter jet
general 2021-02-07 05:10:57 It's perfectly level, did 500 and honestly doesn't look that bad
general 2021-02-07 05:11:33 This is the PCC, expect chaos
general 2021-02-07 05:12:20 Now it's more like if KSP and Minecraft had a baby
general 2021-02-07 05:12:38 Except instead of going to space, you make military vehicles
general 2021-02-07 05:13:19 And that is why you got inventor
general 2021-02-07 05:13:30 But who made folding
general 2021-02-07 05:14:04 Does it have weird blocky diamond nose?
general 2021-02-07 05:14:27 Nope
general 2021-02-07 05:14:31 I keep forgetting about that
general 2021-02-07 05:15:20 Ngl I personally find those blocky diamond noses to be a bit awkward, as in they don't look so conical, more pyramid like for me.
general 2021-02-07 05:16:21 I kinda wished that there'd be more larger builds
general 2021-02-07 05:16:45 VIP1 is the first place I'd think of when wanting to see something more *spicy*
general 2021-02-07 05:17:24 That looks oddly interesting
general 2021-02-07 05:17:30 I kinda wanna see that on an aircraft now
general 2021-02-07 05:17:44 Not satisfying, more interesting
general 2021-02-07 08:41:29 Anyone have any ideas for surveys
general 2021-02-07 08:42:47 In an academic context, mostly just high school level stuff so it's a bit broad in what I can choose
general 2021-02-07 08:43:11 There's a format I'm following
general 2021-02-07 08:43:28 ```Subject/Problem/Issue I want to discuss:

Particular Area I want to focus on:

Ideas for my research topic:

What Question Do I want to answer in my Research Paper?
(State your research question below.)

My research topic.```
general 2021-02-07 08:44:03 Basically, the Discord's own servers
general 2021-02-07 08:44:13 Which means you don't get harassed by some annoying rando
general 2021-02-07 08:44:55 So basically, a difference piece of crap
general 2021-02-07 08:45:11 Honestly teens are just childen but on hormones
general 2021-02-07 08:46:26 So is that why we're cringy trash
general 2021-02-07 08:46:45 Some are even more confident about that
general 2021-02-07 08:46:57 Just look at TikTok
general 2021-02-07 08:49:10 Being financially responsible?
general 2021-02-07 08:50:21 Actually keeping some compulsive, perhaps destructive behavior to themselves
general 2021-02-07 08:51:03 By destructive, it doesn't need to be physical, sometimes it could be being so irresponsible you let someone take advantage of you for NSFW reasons
general 2021-02-07 08:52:02 I think I'll just make my research topic "The effects of secrets on relationships"
general 2021-02-07 08:52:36 Outside of friends and family, never
general 2021-02-07 08:52:50 I've never got interested in a girl
general 2021-02-07 08:54:16 You? As in someone's username? Or as in the word itself?
general 2021-02-07 08:54:31 What about Hong Kong?
general 2021-02-07 08:54:35 And Macau
general 2021-02-07 08:56:07 O h

When I saw lines, I thought you meant like how much space, not the actual writing itself. I can see how that'll really take up a lot of effort and time
general 2021-02-07 09:00:46 "please help there's weird people everywhere with weird stuff going on"

I mean, if anime stuff were in real life it would be an odd sight to see. Weird stuff is left to your imagination
general 2021-02-07 09:01:16 Like for example, flying fighting people who are demigods and transform into King Kong if they have a tail
general 2021-02-07 09:01:51 And you don't just casually see these fighting monke demigods just casually summon a dragon deity
general 2021-02-07 09:06:43 I have a better Godzilla and King Kong thing

general 2021-02-07 09:09:27 I know why Godzilla destroys cities
general 2021-02-07 09:09:33 Reject humanity, protecc monke (kong)
general 2021-02-07 09:09:42 well for me it works
general 2021-02-07 09:09:50 No, he is not monke
general 2021-02-07 09:38:43 I made the school survey thing now
general 2021-02-07 09:39:02 And ngl, I'm rushing a little since deadline's tomorrow
general 2021-02-07 09:39:07 Would it be fine to post one here
general 2021-02-07 09:39:17 Not the best topic though tbh
general 2021-02-07 10:18:06 Give me some research topics for a simple High School thing, all I could think up of right now is

Effects of censorship
Effects of internet addiction
general 2021-02-07 10:22:28 Guess I'll go for censorship then
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 00:59:14 Why are you responding to a message from last year
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 01:01:54 Oh I remember that
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 01:01:59 Was searching for canopies
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 01:02:32 I still find it more odd to respond to a random message here from last year
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 01:04:54 I still couldn't find the cockpit
general 2021-02-08 01:07:14 Wait why is that screenshot 4:3
general 2021-02-08 01:07:17 Like a CRT
general 2021-02-08 01:07:48 Why try small though?
general 2021-02-08 01:08:27 That's a really bad potato if you do that then
general 2021-02-08 01:09:46 Still can't deny that is objectively bad if you require to go that far though
general 2021-02-08 01:09:55 What kind of hardware are you on anyways
general 2021-02-08 01:12:07 <@!761028678599049277> Open up "dxdiag" so we can get a simplified view of what kind of hardware you're using
general 2021-02-08 01:13:41 It's a component of Windows
general 2021-02-08 01:13:52 Unless you're running some ancient Windows 9x system, it's there
general 2021-02-08 01:15:04 Old PC, now show Display and System
general 2021-02-08 01:15:36 System should show us the CPU and RAM, Display should show us GPU stuff
general 2021-02-08 01:16:25 Intel HD Graphics 3000, integrated with 1 GB of RAM available for it
general 2021-02-08 01:17:01 Now what about System, show us that. Just copy and paste the info related to CPU/processor and RAM
general 2021-02-08 01:17:41 "64 bits"
That doesn't help
general 2021-02-08 01:17:59 64-bit what? A 64 bit Celeron? A 64 bit Ryzen?
general 2021-02-08 01:18:02 Be more specific
general 2021-02-08 01:18:31 Yes and I wasn't asking for the meme
general 2021-02-08 01:18:45 I'm just gonna assume you're on a Core 2 Duo with 4 GB of RAM
general 2021-02-08 01:20:19 Well I guess your CPU and GPU are the bottlenecks
general 2021-02-08 01:20:27 They're just too low-end
general 2021-02-08 01:21:46 haha cassette go brrrr
general 2021-02-08 02:26:20 Football, but you play with hands
general 2021-02-08 02:26:49 Why is it called football anyways if the point is throwing
general 2021-02-08 02:27:07 bombs
general 2021-02-08 02:27:09 you want it?
general 2021-02-08 02:27:21 It's yours my friend, as long as you have enough rupees/rubies
general 2021-02-08 02:28:24 I would say American Football should be called handball
general 2021-02-08 02:28:36 But then that would mean baseball and especially basketball would be called handball too
general 2021-02-08 02:28:52 yes
general 2021-02-08 02:29:12 Baseball makes sense, since you have bases
Basketball is pretty obvious
general 2021-02-08 02:29:27 British Football makes sense, since you use feet to kick a ball
general 2021-02-08 02:30:10 
general 2021-02-08 02:30:13 The hoops are called baskets also
general 2021-02-08 02:30:53 Base doesn't necessarily mean you have to lift it
general 2021-02-08 02:32:16 "Soccerball"

Even if I'm not interested in sports, does this use of the term like that disappoints me
general 2021-02-08 02:33:26 It's just Soccer, just like how Tennis is not called Tennisball
general 2021-02-08 02:33:52 The Simp Effect does work though
general 2021-02-08 02:34:14 But that's contradicted by the fact they use a furry PFP
general 2021-02-08 02:36:25 <@!265819387498332160> What if I impersonate Vungielek?
general 2021-02-08 02:37:57 crap someone already took VungieIek (the L being an i)
general 2021-02-08 02:38:22 I can't think up of anyone to mess with here
general 2021-02-08 02:38:34 By being a clone of their username
general 2021-02-08 04:39:12 Anyone else been seeing this weird guy in the YouTube comments called "AxxL"
general 2021-02-08 04:40:06 If Justin Y. was a clout chaser dependent on being a weirdo with non-existent girlfriends.

the-dump 2021-02-08 05:26:23 you had a stroke
general 2021-02-08 05:27:12 My brain tried to auto-correct that to the martial art

general 2021-03-31 08:08:11 Any file that can display text can be embedded this way now, just simply upload

So you could use it to share code, or share ASCII art, go beyond the 2000 character limit, rickroll, etc.

You have absorbed too much internet radiation
general 2021-04-25 05:06:52 Now you yourself are a shitpost
general 2021-04-25 05:07:06 Oh, like your mom
general 2021-04-25 05:07:18 Oh hey that's your clown

general 2021-04-25 05:09:27 Damn I didn't even need to go to 4chan when this already is a clone of one
general 2021-04-25 05:09:40 It's just a big piece of steaming shit
general 2021-04-25 05:10:08 Pretty much the only reason you do this is because you're a disappointment. Don't lie to yourself and assert dominance
general 2021-04-25 05:10:15 We already know you spend too much online being a disappointment
general 2021-04-25 05:10:46 I mean how else are you gonna assert dominance to mask your self esteem
general 2021-04-25 05:11:16 Simple, be like `ImTheLastJoshSwain`
general 2021-04-25 05:11:35 Find random people to assert dominance so he can mask his low self-esteem
general 2021-04-25 05:12:09 You'd fit well with the Arch elitists
general 2021-04-25 05:12:35 Nah, what clownery

general 2021-04-25 05:15:07 Good.
Seriously though sometimes this place really just sucks ass
general 2021-04-25 05:15:41 It's like the only personality some people have is to be a shitpost
general 2021-04-25 05:16:08 ok clown
general 2021-04-25 05:16:34 That's your door
general 2021-04-25 05:16:57 Eh, just some weird rando being very aggressive
general 2021-04-25 05:20:12 Probably the one that got paid some fat Adopt Me cash
general 2021-04-25 05:21:08 Then take away the big Adopt Me money
they will become lazy to fix the physics
general 2021-04-25 05:21:49 Eh, that joke's stale
