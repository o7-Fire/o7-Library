creations-chat 2023-07-01 21:33:44 You didn't just say "I dont like your build" you legit went out of your way to make sure that this guy knows his build absolutely sucks. It DOES say a lot about you.

plane-crazy 2023-07-09 21:35:04 The entire plane crazy community when someone doesn't motorlock their build to oblivion:
general 2023-07-12 18:03:57 you hate every build
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 18:04:46 amogus ðŸ—¿
general 2023-07-12 18:07:33 It makes me chuckle every time I see a build getting a lot of upvotes because it tricks the expert designers into thinking its motorlocked
general 2023-07-12 18:09:13 I have just gone to making meme and joke builds now
