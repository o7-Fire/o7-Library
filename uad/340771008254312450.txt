plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:03:04 legit shot an aircraft carrier in half and on his screen he is still the same
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:03:32 will it ever not be?
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:04:52 yeah but i dont get how the arena works
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:04:59 i always spawn with the same old plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:05:02 that i started with
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:05:14 and its unarmed
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:05:47 
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:05:49 i wanna use this op baby ;c
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:07:39 but i got no idea how
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:09:44 yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:09:48 but every time i click arena
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:09:53 it makes me use an old plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:09:57 not the one im currently using
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:11:08 yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:11:10 i did
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:11:20 i see nothing
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:13:25 k i figured it out
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:17:22 nvm
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:17:25 no clue how it works
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:42:57 jets and control surfaces"?
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:43:00 rockets?
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:43:45 i made the ultimate  bomber
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:43:47 500 bombs
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 01:43:59 with a possibility of 3500 small bombs
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 14:46:29 will someone tell me how the arena works?
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 14:46:44 it always spawns me with the same unarmed plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 14:46:49 no clue how to change it
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 14:47:15 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 14:47:20 and guess what i sapwn with
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 14:47:28 either nothing
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 14:47:37 or an unarmed jet that wasnt even built by me
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 14:48:11 well
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 14:48:14 it had no guns
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 14:48:17 but it had plane
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 14:48:20 so i figured
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 14:48:29 KAMAKAZI
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 14:48:41 but sadly
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 14:48:44 did not work
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 14:48:50 now how do i switch my plane
help 2018-11-04 18:16:31 still no clue how arena works
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 18:17:03 k so
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 18:17:10 still trying to figure out how arena works
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 18:17:36 i have a thing carrying 500 bombs
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 18:17:40 but it can be used as one
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 18:18:19 so can someone be a human and tell me how to spawn something in arena
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 18:19:05 well
plane-crazy 2018-11-04 18:19:23 i guess im just gomnn always spawn with with nothing in arena
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:50:41 k so i invented this thing that can go up into space, and rain down 500 massive pillars that can go up to 2000
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:50:52 but
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:50:55 i have no idea
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:51:00 how to get into the arena to use it
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:51:19 N0
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:53:38 wait
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:53:46 why do some people have like 500 roles
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:54:19 well what is the bombardier role for
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:56:04 HOLY CRAP
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:56:07 I GOT THE ROLE OF BOMBARDIER
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:56:29 ive dropped over 50000 bombs on people
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:56:55 you can ask them if they've heard of "im gonna drop an orbital bomb in 2 minutes"
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:57:00 no why
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:57:06 kewl
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:57:11 how is a land carrier useful
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:57:29 i can just land on ground
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:58:06 true
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:58:09 but
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:58:16 i made a propeller driven fighter
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:58:19 a jet fighter
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:58:26 a 4 engined attack vehicle
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:59:00 no its honestly just a gigantic crankshaft
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:59:25 with a propeller attached
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:59:30 and some gigantic wings
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:59:49 i did also make a jet/propeller hybrid
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 02:59:54 if thats what your talking about
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 03:00:16 now
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 03:00:19 i need to know
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 03:00:22 how to get into arena
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 03:00:31 **WITH** my vehicle
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 03:00:45 cuz every time it just goes poof
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 03:01:10 also
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 03:01:19 ping me if you have an answer
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 03:01:22 im closing discord
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 04:58:52 k so
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 04:58:57 how do i use the arena
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 04:59:01 never spawn with my plane?
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 05:00:51 thank you man
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 05:01:20 oh okay
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 05:01:32 cuz ive never spawned with my actual creations
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 05:01:46 so i do like
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 05:01:55 "Arena slot:" **2**
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 05:02:06 that did not work
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 05:02:17 i spawned with my autosaved
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 05:03:19 ima go to offtopic
general 2018-11-06 05:03:43 remember the good old days when you were into supercars
general 2018-11-06 05:03:56 then you figured out what a v20 was
general 2018-11-06 05:04:04 one thing leads to another
general 2018-11-06 05:04:08 BAM spitfire fan
general 2018-11-06 05:04:14 then one thing leads to another
general 2018-11-06 05:04:15 BAM
general 2018-11-06 05:04:22 messerschmitt me 262 fan
general 2018-11-06 05:04:31 the most lit of all jets
general 2018-11-06 05:04:34 and the first >:)
general 2018-11-06 05:04:51 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RWygbsaJMg&t=15s
general 2018-11-06 05:05:01 and the only reason you got into the me 262 was this weird music video
general 2018-11-06 05:05:07 with that one song by bastille
general 2018-11-06 05:05:16 that dude who made pompeii
general 2018-11-06 05:05:21 it is a lit mv tho
general 2018-11-06 05:07:01 
general 2018-11-06 05:07:06 boi im unbeatable
general 2018-11-06 05:18:42 wait replace what
general 2018-11-06 05:19:20 yeah but how on earth
general 2018-11-06 05:19:25 do i
general 2018-11-06 05:19:33 replace it and it still be as effective
general 2018-11-06 05:19:36 reverse?
general 2018-11-06 05:19:43 i honestly didnt know it until now
general 2018-11-06 05:20:04 how
general 2018-11-06 05:20:07 im bad with those
general 2018-11-06 05:20:20 here i will redesign the thing
general 2018-11-06 05:21:11 tbh
general 2018-11-06 05:21:18 the only reason i put rockets on the propeller
general 2018-11-06 05:21:20 was for looks
general 2018-11-06 05:21:25 cuz it spins twice as fast
general 2018-11-06 05:21:37 making it look like you know **an actual propeller when its flying**
general 2018-11-06 05:23:21 
general 2018-11-06 05:23:25 this good?
general 2018-11-06 05:23:28 modified
general 2018-11-06 05:23:58 it looks ugleh now ; -;
general 2018-11-06 05:25:58 
general 2018-11-06 05:26:50 hold up is this one of those servers who absolutely hate the iron cross
general 2018-11-06 05:27:51 Holy crap
general 2018-11-06 05:28:06 i just invented a spinning anti tank missile that is super accurate and effective
general 2018-11-06 05:28:32 what does the 10 mean in ballast?
general 2018-11-06 05:28:35 10 kilograms?
general 2018-11-06 05:30:34 good lord
general 2018-11-06 05:30:36 this is accurate
general 2018-11-06 05:31:20 
general 2018-11-06 05:35:52 control surfaces
general 2018-11-06 05:38:14 same principls
general 2018-11-06 05:38:15 also
general 2018-11-06 05:38:22 i made it the same key
general 2018-11-06 05:38:31 so all i gotta hold down is the same button to release it
general 2018-11-06 05:38:39 also
general 2018-11-06 05:38:42 i have 10 fingers
general 2018-11-06 05:38:48 i only need 4 to control my plane
general 2018-11-06 05:39:32 oh btw what is 10 on the ballast?
general 2018-11-06 05:39:34 100 kilos?
general 2018-11-06 05:39:37 10 kilos?
general 2018-11-06 05:40:10 oh so its
general 2018-11-06 05:40:19 like the weight of 10 pillars
general 2018-11-06 05:41:06 im gonna send my 500 bomb carrying thing into orbit again
general 2018-11-06 05:41:40 i really gotta upgrade it and exchange the 2 sets of 1x7 blocks for 3 sets of ballast tanks
general 2018-11-06 05:42:15 that would give 750 ballast bombs
general 2018-11-06 05:42:21 what's 750 x 10 lol
general 2018-11-06 05:42:46 7500 kilograms of weight
general 2018-11-06 05:43:06 das alot :3
general 2018-11-06 05:43:15 wait will we ever havea ctual bombs?
general 2018-11-06 05:43:18 that explode?
general 2018-11-06 05:43:25 but are heavy af
general 2018-11-06 05:44:12 CRAP
general 2018-11-06 05:44:17 I GOT PHOTOBOMBED BY MY OWN BOMB
general 2018-11-06 05:45:04 
general 2018-11-06 05:45:05 here is the impressive load of 500 bombs dropping, along with a gigantic platform that allows them to "explode"
general 2018-11-06 05:45:41 
general 2018-11-06 05:45:43 this is when i got photobombed and flung into the air by my own bombs
general 2018-11-06 05:46:15 
general 2018-11-06 05:46:20 and this is a picture i tried to take after getting photobombed, if you listen closely, you can hear the scream of the drew that got flung after this
general 2018-11-06 05:46:50 most of the bombs are offscreen
general 2018-11-06 05:47:34 due to roblox physics, after they are dropped from 5 km high, they gain a speed of 2000, and for some reason dont penetrate the ground, but go like 600 feet in the air after detonation
general 2018-11-06 05:47:59 sometimes when i drop it pieces go all the way across the map
general 2018-11-06 05:48:18 like i will be dropping it in the mountains and atleast 20 pieces will end up in the canyons and airport
general 2018-11-06 05:48:29 im making a version twice the size
general 2018-11-06 05:48:58 i legit take notes of this game
general 2018-11-06 05:49:06 and make blueprints
general 2018-11-06 05:49:11 i know i have no life shush
general 2018-11-06 05:49:57 here's my light bomber
general 2018-11-06 05:50:02 it only carries 72 bombs
general 2018-11-06 05:50:10 it has a rear turret gunner and its nickname is the flying brick
general 2018-11-06 05:50:35 
general 2018-11-06 05:50:44 boi
general 2018-11-06 05:50:52 i cant ever make stuff that great
general 2018-11-06 05:51:30 light bomber is slightly more effective
general 2018-11-06 05:51:38 as it gains a speed of 370
general 2018-11-06 05:51:47 while the heavy bomber prototype gets a speed of 100
general 2018-11-06 05:51:53 no
general 2018-11-06 05:51:57 ooooh vip server?
general 2018-11-06 05:51:59 can i joinz?

general 2018-11-06 05:54:26 omg that's a fast boi
general 2018-11-06 05:55:07 lol physics
general 2018-11-06 05:55:12 if an object moves
general 2018-11-06 05:55:28 i thought that if it launched something that object begins with the speed of the object its being fired from?
general 2018-11-06 05:55:30 wth roblox
general 2018-11-06 05:55:35 do you even physics
general 2018-11-06 05:56:20

plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:41:00 
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 02:41:13 When you try to escape after being shot down and your plane is like **if im going down you are too!**
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 23:40:13 well since nobody made my favorite jet the me 262
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 23:40:19 i decided to make a bad version
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 23:40:46 
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 23:40:47 top speed 620
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 04:05:35

plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:17:38 
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:17:43 my attempt at making an me 262 with an ejection seat, full armor and a speed of 600
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:18:11 all of them complete and it does
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:18:17 have the capacity to be launched on wwater
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:18:29 i love what i build ❤

plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:18:55 i wish to see
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:19:33 
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:22:19 hey not everything can be perfect
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:22:33 form over function or function over form
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:22:42 i chose function over form
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:22:49 i want it to keep its speed of 607
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:22:59 and its detachable wings and engines
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:23:08 and its ejection seat
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:23:17 the ejction seat is op btw
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:23:40 idk i want it to look good
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:23:45 TELL MEH

plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:24:30 i have a variant of mine that can be fitted with these gigantic rockets
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:25:05 
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:25:15 i think an openable canopy is just as great as an ejection seat
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:25:45 well they can knock a dude out of the sky
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:25:57 if they hit
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:26:22 thats why it has 10 cannons
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:30:10 
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:30:26 idk

plane-crazy 2018-11-29 03:02:13 but something of that size will take up the whole freakin map due to how gigantic the rockets and the firing mechanism will be
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 21:38:53 k never put folding wings and ball turrets together
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 21:39:03 for some reason the game freaks out and breaks the wings

plane-crazy 2019-01-06 19:19:06 the wya i make them i can only make one GIANT one
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 19:19:12 not two smowl ones
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:11:48 low iq or no iq?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:31:19 i
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:31:23 shall make the faastest car
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:31:37 gonna try and fit 4 magnet drives anything that can get serious speed in there
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:50:42 very fast car cockpit complete
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:51:04 mhmmm
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 01:51:16 what do you want it to be a dang tear drop?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 03:55:50 that one dude who acts like he's the chief executive of boeing just cuz he played war thunder 3 times
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 04:06:00 
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:10:11 BAM
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:10:17 instead of making a really fast car
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:10:33 
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:11:26 its purpose is to fly 19 people onto an unsuitable position at 680 sps
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:11:36 and cover them with the machine gun
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:11:37 😄
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:11:44 terrible concept i know but im running out of ideas
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:12:00 it doesnt accelerate good
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:12:17 mostly cuz i put the spoiler on that actually makes landing way eaasier
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:12:34 i think its cool looking
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:12:44 sloper armor n all that
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:12:58 cuz i had no room
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:13:02 besides its 680 sps
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:13:05 who can shoot that?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:13:36 ima make a purely land version
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:13:42 where they are under 4 blocks of armor
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:13:58 rip wont stop rockets
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:14:22 also i just realized i used ballast tanks
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:14:31 so a fart can make this thing explode
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:14:43 **i have the engineering prowess of a german in ww2**
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 04:20:46 kinda like a higgens boat except way faster and probably less effective
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:32:34 Was suppost to be a main abttle tank, i thought it looked too boxy next thing you know it has 4 flak guns, 6 machine guns, a katyusha launcher, flare launcher, floodlights, a kitchen, seating for 25, etc
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:32:46 its the american thing to do
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:32:51 just strap a ton of guns onto it
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:33:02 oh its missing something
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:35:05 again
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:35:09 i got carried away
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:35:24 its actually really great at destroying pretty much anything that crawls beneath it
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:36:28 
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:36:33 now its a proper andrew creation
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:36:40 #german engineering
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:38:51 oh swastika in a server
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:38:53 is that ok?
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:39:32 a server
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:39:40 its legit a plane made out of a swastika
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:42:00 
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:42:02 this
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:42:16 being german i am kind of offended by it
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:43:02 dude its a swastika
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:43:09 i understand not all germans were nazis
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:43:22 but i mean
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:43:26 kinda killed millions of people
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:44:09 i am detecting IQ levels of -60
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 06:44:56 yes we all know about gulags
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 14:41:31 bam, my version of the flying fortress. finally got it to work 😄
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 14:41:59 my flying fortress vtols for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 01:06:34 craop

plane-crazy 2019-01-14 01:15:06 welp
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 01:15:10 there goes that plane
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 01:15:21 no way to get it back and no way to re create it
plane-crazy 2019-01-14 01:16:01 rest in peace
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 03:07:42 k began working on a new bomber
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 03:07:45 its slightly bigger than the last
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 03:07:58 but basically the same thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 03:08:06 hope i dont be stupid and save over this again!

plane-crazy 2019-01-15 22:11:32 I MAKE A BOMBER
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 22:11:34 SO OP
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 22:11:41 CANT USE IT FOR SOME ODD REASON
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 22:11:48 IT ONLY LOADS IN THE CONTROL SURFACES
bug-reports 2019-01-15 22:13:02 Bomber doesnt load in, all it loads in is the control surfaces
bug-reports 2019-01-15 22:14:33 nope
bug-reports 2019-01-15 22:14:37 not there
bug-reports 2019-01-15 22:14:40 nada
bug-reports 2019-01-15 22:14:41 
bug-reports 2019-01-15 23:45:47 why is this problem only happening to me
bug-reports 2019-01-15 23:46:05 im sick of having to create the same thing over and over again just cuz the game glitches out
bug-reports 2019-01-15 23:46:46 in other words THIS IS BULL
bug-reports 2019-01-15 23:47:23 im not building it again
bug-reports 2019-01-15 23:47:25 im sick of it
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:48:54 rest in piece
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:49:07 my plane
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:49:14 this game just doesnt want me to have it
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:49:16 sick of it
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:49:19 not building it again
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:49:41 lost it a first time
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:49:44 to bugs and glitches
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:49:47 lost it again
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:49:50 to bugs and glitches
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:50:05 LOST IT AGAIN
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:50:08 TO BUGS AND GLITCHES
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:50:14 
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:51:14 so once again
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:51:59 farewell you beautiful bomber
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:52:59 is he asking how to make a ramp?
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:53:36 screw my life
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:54:16 lol moderators
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:54:19 good job!
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:54:37 your totally worth being one
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:54:56 god save this game
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:55:02 sick of it destroying my saves
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:55:07 ima go over to neo warfare
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 01:58:31 how good are huge rocket engines compared to supers?
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 02:00:31 so
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 02:00:42 a block of super engines as big as a huge engine
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 02:00:45 is more powerful?
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 02:01:09 thanks
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 02:05:55 and armor works right?
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 02:06:19 say you build a block
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 02:06:26 but
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 02:06:34 you make said block
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 02:06:37 with so many blocks inside
plane-crazy 2019-02-24 02:06:45 that it doesnt fall apart from a rocket
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:17:48 **i had to up my tank game a small bit so i made this**
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:18:43 but armored
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:18:49 thunk
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:18:54 <:thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:19:20 i just did what the russians did
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:19:26 slapped a big ol gun onto a lot of armor
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:19:33 and hoped it didnt catch fire
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:19:53 son like
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:20:00 i dont see the difference
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:20:07 think about it
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:20:11 sloped armor is good
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:20:12 but
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:20:18 imagine how cramped those dudes were
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:20:33 no wonder like
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:20:43 most of them died crewing them
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:21:18 **tank shows up with like 8 inches of non sloped armor
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:21:38 wait hol on
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:21:59 how do you calculate the armor of slope again?
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:22:32 its not tank nerd stuff
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:22:37 its normal nerd stuff
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:22:47 like trigonometry
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:22:51 im talking about
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:22:52 real
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:22:54 world
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:22:57 physics
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:22:58 and
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:23:03 armor
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:23:12 like 8 inches of non sloped armor
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:23:19 compared to sloped 2 inch thick armor
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:24:11 real engineering
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:24:51 ima just stick to slow
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:24:53 thick

plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:35:55 true
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:36:02 german engineering
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:39:48 however
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:39:54 it isnt true german engineering
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:40:14 unless the underpowered engine breaks down every 5 miles
plane-crazy 2019-03-06 04:40:32 i STOLE

plane-crazy 2019-03-11 01:16:18 the new and improved torpedo bomber
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 01:16:26 basically my version of the g4m1

plane-crazy 2019-03-11 01:20:17 new torpedo bomber basically immune to AA
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 01:21:48 so i am trying a design without a tail wing
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 01:21:55 and it just spins
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 01:21:58 is thaat normal?
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 01:22:18 look at the rafale
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 01:23:06 i will get a tailess design
the-dump 2019-03-31 06:33:18 nvm meme makes no sense
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 00:24:37 it says bugs fixed
plane-crazy 2019-04-01 00:24:54 so parachute dont lag the crap out of creations anymore?

plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:23:33 no
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:23:45 trees grow faster man
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:24:40 so your plane is considered a flying fortress once it flies with one engine, 70% of the fuselage left, and 60% of the wings left?
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:27:41 YAY
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:27:53 i just got my first air kill with my torpedo bomber

plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:52:58 idk
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:53:00 tbh
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:54:06 has anyone made guided bombs?
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:54:27 mine are controllable but they
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:54:32 woo boi are they hard to control
plane-crazy 2019-04-05 21:55:25 is this what a proper guided bomb looks like?

plane-crazy 2020-03-19 18:19:39 just modified an apc chassis i already had and it surprisingly looks like a ferdinand
plane-crazy 2020-03-19 18:20:42 just added a giant box on top and put a gun in it
plane-crazy 2020-03-19 18:20:45 bam tank destroyer lmao
plane-crazy 2020-03-19 20:28:42 ha
plane-crazy 2020-03-19 20:28:57 i laugh at your armored vehicle that does not have sloped armor!
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:11:19 
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:11:24 
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:11:25 im tryna make posty's apc, but it's going very poorly
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:11:41 i should probably girth up the back XD
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:12:04 yeah, it's a first for me
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:12:09 i also got the real sized version
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:12:57 
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:13:00 this one's small, manages to somehow fit more people, but it misses the cupola
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:13:08 it's like a clown car
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:13:28 Plus it can be air dropped
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:14:20 I wish you werent limited to blocks
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:14:56 designs could be way smaller
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:39:44 anyone know a good desert tan
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:39:52 camo paint sheme?
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:53:31 
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:53:34 i managed to make it look somewhat decent
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:53:35 
plane-crazy 2020-03-28 00:58:28 because every pleb here think's the yamato is a god ship
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:00:35 how does restitution work
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:00:49 i have. no idea
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:01:00 already have
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:01:22 i just wanna know what restitution is
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:01:45 i created tank treads
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:01:53 and i wanna know if more restitution is good
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:02:02 before i apply it to every single one of the ropes that are in that system.
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:02:21 yes, i tried using motors
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:02:29 but what i came up with wasnt reliable
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:02:33 so i used ropes instead
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:03:02 when i look up restitution
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:03:07 it legit shows me a law.
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:03:54 english
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:04:16 from my point of view, if you know what that sentence means, you should really get a life
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:04:30 or
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:04:37 so more restitution
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:04:41 is good?
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:05:32 yes, and i love doing manual labor
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:05:38 it makes me feel good inside
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:07:11 given the fact that ive only been using treads for like
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:07:12 30 minutes
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:07:19 i'd say that im pretty advanced
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:07:40 conveyors are where it's at
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:07:43 way easier to armor
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:07:47 in my experience
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:07:55 no, they are pretty good
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:08:09 if you do them the right way
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:08:18 i don't need suspension
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:08:48 and once that mouse guided motor thing comes out im pretty sure everyone's gonna have gyroscopically stable guns
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:09:03 it is?
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:09:13 OH MY GOD I HAVE WORK TO DO
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:09:55 what use does a rocket have?
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:09:57 well
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:10:00 that kind of rocket
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:10:10 In plane crazu
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:10:20 depends on the plane
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:10:24 to shoot down other planes
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:10:30 to bomb ground targets
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:10:44 it doesnt in plane crazu
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:10:57 10 player servers <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:11:19 every single one of my designs
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:11:32 are for successfully eliminating other people's designs, without sustaining damage
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:13:30 to make me feel good inside for destroying things
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:43:50 ive seen people use motors to link treads before
plane-crazy 2020-03-31 01:43:58 but i have no idea how to reverse engineer that
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 08:43:03 which material has the least friction?
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 08:43:05 metal?
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 08:43:19 tanks
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 08:43:40 alright
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 08:43:48 what material has the second least amount of friction
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 08:43:56 xD
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 08:44:16 ima go with metal
plane-crazy 2020-04-03 13:02:15 other than ice
plane-crazy 2020-04-03 13:02:21 what material has a really low
plane-crazy 2020-04-03 13:02:25 level of friction?
general 2020-04-04 04:48:37 What even is that new thing in development?
general 2020-04-04 04:49:41 Is that a sword? What is that?
general 2020-04-04 04:51:16 Oooo
general 2020-04-04 04:51:53 Honestly I build my planes with the cockpit built inside of the nose
general 2020-04-04 04:51:55 So
general 2020-04-04 04:52:04 That is almost completely useless to me
general 2020-04-04 04:52:34 Something like a corner wedge 1x2 or something like that would be cool
general 2020-04-04 04:52:57 Or maybe a 1x2 wedge beam
general 2020-04-04 04:53:00 One day
general 2020-04-04 04:53:16 Yeah it does, but not the way I’m talking about
general 2020-04-04 04:53:29 You know the normal corner wedge?
general 2020-04-04 04:53:38 Like that but 1x2
general 2020-04-04 04:53:46 Not the other corner wedge
general 2020-04-04 04:54:27 No, no I cannot
general 2020-04-04 04:54:42 The corner has to be there
general 2020-04-04 04:54:52 Triangle wedges don’t fill it in
general 2020-04-04 04:55:06 Triangle 1x2s
general 2020-04-04 04:55:17 How useful is a yacht
general 2020-04-04 04:55:42 
general 2020-04-04 04:55:46 Foot revel owo
general 2020-04-04 04:56:05 Yes and 1x2 wedge beans
general 2020-04-07 20:01:58 What does the egg do?
general 2020-04-17 09:11:33 alrighty
general 2020-04-17 09:11:34 so
general 2020-04-17 09:11:43 i should know this, because i used to use it a lot
general 2020-04-17 09:11:52 but does diamond plate do anything special?
general 2020-04-17 09:11:54 does it like
general 2020-04-17 09:11:58 increase friction?
general 2020-04-17 09:23:59 it literally gave a pop up
general 2020-04-17 09:24:05 about what was added
general 2020-04-17 15:19:52 i can't wait
general 2020-04-17 15:19:56 to see
general 2020-04-17 15:20:02 if they do remodel the deep jungle trike
general 2020-04-17 15:20:07 what it would look like
general 2020-04-17 15:20:10 probably
general 2020-04-17 15:20:11 epic
general 2020-04-17 15:20:18 like it was back in the day
general 2020-04-17 15:20:21 i feel old
general 2020-04-17 15:20:30 remember 2015
general 2020-04-17 15:20:34 when the bad models were good
general 2020-04-18 13:41:48 if sloped armor blocked shots in the game this thing would be... perculiar
general 2020-04-18 13:51:15 yeah i thought i was the only one to figure it out
general 2020-04-18 13:51:16 but
general 2020-04-18 13:51:18 im not
general 2020-04-18 13:51:36 <:pain:644301805534183464>
general 2020-04-18 13:53:05 so umm

general 2020-04-18 13:53:07 what
general 2020-04-18 13:53:09 lol
general 2020-04-18 13:53:29 no missiles work
general 2020-04-18 13:55:38 so basically
general 2020-04-18 13:55:39 i get
general 2020-04-18 13:55:41 really
general 2020-04-18 13:55:50 thunk
general 2020-04-18 13:55:54 when im designing stuff
general 2020-04-18 13:55:56 and
general 2020-04-18 13:56:18 the slopes are suppost to reflect any gunfire and redirect it back towards the attacker
general 2020-04-18 13:56:24 but
general 2020-04-18 13:56:27 it's plane crazy
general 2020-04-18 13:56:28 so
general 2020-04-18 13:56:31 that no happen
general 2020-04-18 13:56:43 😭
general 2020-04-18 13:57:42 my missiles go like 8 feet and then they stop
general 2020-04-18 13:57:59 i don't have anchors anywhere on my  creation
general 2020-04-18 13:58:34 yeah but
general 2020-04-18 13:58:39 my internet is fine
general 2020-04-18 13:58:48 literally everything is normal EXCEPT the missile
general 2020-04-18 14:00:37 i do <:pain:644301805534183464>
general 2020-04-18 14:00:43 that's like
general 2020-04-18 14:00:45 how i found this game
general 2020-04-18 14:01:10 i feel old <:Yikes:663181126424330297>
general 2020-04-18 14:18:48 i can't even fathom coding
general 2020-04-18 14:18:50 besides
general 2020-04-18 14:18:53 too boring for me

general 2020-07-08 03:08:20 i have literally no idea
general 2020-07-08 03:08:50 thanks
general 2020-07-13 02:50:05 Kind of a dumb question
general 2020-07-13 02:50:11 But where are the cannons
general 2020-07-13 02:50:20 I can’t seem to find them in my pvp section
general 2020-07-13 02:52:23 When do you think we will get them
general 2020-08-04 04:40:56 i just invented sails
general 2020-08-20 01:40:50 cannons were once a thing
general 2020-08-20 01:40:54 werent they?
general 2020-08-20 01:41:10 i keep seeing pictures in the hall of fame of things with the cannons

general 2020-08-20 01:43:45 this ship
general 2020-08-20 01:44:00 i see cannons
general 2020-08-20 01:44:09 literally right in front of the main deck
general 2020-08-20 01:44:39 how'd he get them so small
general 2020-08-20 01:45:14 any idea of
general 2020-08-20 01:45:20 when they get implemented
general 2020-08-20 01:45:22 the size
general 2020-08-20 01:45:27 and how they will function
general 2020-08-20 01:45:28 ?
general 2020-08-20 01:45:43 yes
general 2020-08-20 01:45:45 i've seen the
general 2020-08-20 01:45:50 remodel
general 2020-08-20 01:45:51 and the
general 2020-08-20 01:45:53 original model
general 2020-08-20 01:46:02 i don't understand why you would remodel something that isnt even in the game
general 2020-08-20 01:46:05 but they did
general 2020-08-20 01:46:27 however
general 2020-08-20 01:46:28 that doesnt
general 2020-08-20 01:46:29 tell me
general 2020-08-20 01:46:32 the size
general 2020-08-20 01:46:37 and the way they work
general 2020-08-20 01:47:28 i already voted i believe
general 2020-08-20 01:47:33 like
general 2020-08-20 01:47:35 2 months ago
general 2020-08-20 01:47:49 well
general 2020-08-20 01:47:52 i am a fan
general 2020-08-20 01:47:54 of giant
general 2020-08-20 01:47:56 sailing ships
general 2020-08-20 01:48:05 and i've already created functioning sails
general 2020-08-20 01:48:19 however before
general 2020-08-20 01:48:20 i create
general 2020-08-20 01:48:27 the ultimate sailing ship
general 2020-08-20 01:48:36 i need to know how many cannons he will also make
general 2020-08-20 01:48:56 like
general 2020-08-20 01:49:00 i know that he might
general 2020-08-20 01:49:07 only make like 4 per creatioin
general 2020-08-20 01:49:08 like
general 2020-08-20 01:49:12 he always does
general 2020-09-01 05:56:03 when you decide to add cannons like
general 2020-09-01 05:56:07 a year from now
general 2020-09-01 05:56:12 make them super heavy
general 2020-09-01 05:56:19 i need something to balance out my ships
general 2020-09-01 05:59:33 
general 2020-09-01 05:59:49 a ship that is designed for those
general 2020-09-01 05:59:51 cannons
general 2020-09-01 05:59:54 hopefully
general 2020-09-01 05:59:56 eventually
general 2020-09-01 06:00:09 i tried to do a dutch fluyt
general 2020-09-01 06:00:21 not a
general 2020-09-01 06:00:25 idk whatever you call those
general 2020-09-01 06:00:27 sloops of war
general 2020-09-01 06:00:30 victory bois
general 2020-09-01 06:00:35 man o wars
general 2020-09-01 06:00:44 you guys should sail in tandom
general 2020-09-01 06:00:56 i've already mastered turrets
general 2020-09-01 06:01:03 except i'm designing proper sailing ships
general 2020-09-01 06:01:29 
general 2020-09-01 06:01:34 \
general 2020-09-01 06:01:55 it's square because i ran out of room
general 2020-09-01 06:01:56 lol
general 2020-09-01 06:02:31 i'm waiting on like
general 2020-09-01 06:02:34 the cannons
general 2020-09-01 06:02:41 so i can have a super fast boi
general 2020-09-01 06:03:51 
general 2020-09-01 06:03:52 i think i did a good job on the
general 2020-09-01 06:03:54 rear thing
general 2020-09-01 06:04:00 the place with the wheel
general 2020-09-01 06:04:50 i still havent figured out
general 2020-09-01 06:05:08 like i've figured out how to propel a ship without any form of propellor
general 2020-09-01 06:05:18 but my
general 2020-09-01 06:05:20 ships
general 2020-09-01 06:05:23 can't stand the sheer force
general 2020-09-01 06:05:33 of the sails
general 2020-09-01 06:05:42 i didn't expect you to.
general 2020-09-01 06:05:45 however
general 2020-09-01 06:05:50 you don't need to point that out
general 2020-09-01 06:05:52 i already know
general 2020-09-01 06:05:57 i'm just bored
general 2020-09-01 06:06:10 what's your problem with me exactly?
general 2020-09-01 06:06:38 well
general 2020-09-01 06:06:40 regardless
general 2020-09-01 06:06:45 i'm going to speak about it
general 2020-09-01 06:06:48 if you have a problem.
general 2020-09-01 06:06:53 deal with that on your own, lad
general 2020-09-01 06:07:01 i can's help you
general 2020-09-01 06:07:02 sorry
general 2020-09-01 06:07:11 can't
general 2020-09-01 06:07:12 oops
general 2020-09-01 06:07:57 i mean my ships are a far cry compared to what they used to be
general 2020-09-01 06:08:06 
general 2020-09-01 06:08:10 the infamous floating brick
general 2020-09-01 06:08:53 i can't seem to ever kill a t-34
general 2020-09-01 06:08:57 no matter
general 2020-09-01 06:09:03 how many times i fire at it
general 2020-09-01 06:09:10 THAT SHOT BOUNCED
general 2020-09-01 06:09:37 it's been a while since i last played that game
general 2020-09-01 06:09:55 what's  the name of that giant german 105 gun carrier
general 2020-09-01 06:10:03 strurer emil
general 2020-09-01 06:10:05 or something
general 2020-09-01 06:10:34 like i'm pretty sure you know the one i'm talking about
general 2020-09-01 06:10:37 sir
general 2020-09-01 06:10:54 i'm not a very smart person
general 2020-09-01 06:10:55 but
general 2020-09-01 06:10:58 i don't understand
general 2020-09-01 06:11:11 what is basically
general 2020-09-01 06:11:17 a flying bomb
general 2020-09-01 06:11:24 gets deflected by a t-34
general 2020-09-01 06:12:30 but i'm not one of those 14 year olds who watches simple history and plays world of tanks and is all of a sudden a tank ace
general 2020-09-01 06:13:03 war thunder was never realistic
general 2020-09-01 06:13:28 it's always gonna be a buggy game
general 2020-09-01 06:13:40 using code and numbers
general 2020-09-01 06:13:47 instead of like in real life
general 2020-09-01 06:13:48 where
general 2020-09-01 06:13:49 you know
general 2020-09-01 06:13:54 it's not coded
general 2020-09-01 06:14:52 like
general 2020-09-01 06:15:05 war thunder is a far cry from most other games with that kind of thing
general 2020-09-01 06:15:12 but still
general 2020-09-01 06:15:21 instead of a shell being fired at steel
general 2020-09-01 06:15:25 it's basically
general 2020-09-01 06:15:51 coded object with a set penetration against other object with coded resistance
general 2020-09-01 06:16:30 real footage of an me262's engine overheating and exploding
general 2020-09-01 06:16:36 1945 colorized
general 2020-09-01 06:17:12 lol you just reminded me of my first creation
general 2020-09-01 06:17:21 i still have it
general 2020-09-01 06:17:46 
general 2020-09-01 06:17:48 my first ever plane in this game
general 2020-09-01 06:18:21 corner wedges werent a thing so it's boxy af
general 2020-09-01 06:19:34 highest speed i've ever achieved in this game
general 2020-09-01 06:19:37 was in that 262
general 2020-09-01 06:19:45 with a top speed of i think 640
general 2020-09-01 06:20:07 well yes but i was using rockets and wing power lol
general 2020-09-01 06:20:14 WAYYYYY too much lift power
general 2020-09-01 06:20:41 i looked at my 262 and i was like
general 2020-09-01 06:20:47 you know what this is too big
general 2020-09-01 06:21:01 so i've just been focusing on making my vehicles smaller and smaller
general 2020-09-01 06:21:22 i am sped
general 2020-09-01 06:21:58 and since i like having small builds with only like 200 or 300 parts
general 2020-09-01 06:22:12 i've grown a disliking for builds with like
general 2020-09-01 06:22:16 4000 parts
general 2020-09-01 06:22:39 this is true however my pc doesnt care lol
general 2020-09-01 06:22:52 i feel like it can only handle a set amount of parts in any server
general 2020-09-01 06:22:53 so
general 2020-09-01 06:22:58 i do my best to have as little as possible
general 2020-09-01 06:23:12 you might as well call me ww2 russia
general 2020-09-01 06:23:17 because my builds are simple
general 2020-09-01 06:23:20 yet
general 2020-09-01 06:23:23 kind of effective
general 2020-09-01 06:23:57 i wish they would add hollow circles
general 2020-09-01 06:24:05 ones that you don't need to build
general 2020-09-01 06:24:12 my tank builds would be so tiny
general 2020-09-01 06:24:26 i've actually figured this out as well
general 2020-09-01 06:24:27 however
general 2020-09-01 06:24:28 i use
general 2020-09-01 06:24:31 hover jets
general 2020-09-01 06:24:36 and just paint the inside black
general 2020-09-01 06:25:09 my favorite creation has to be the carronade
general 2020-09-01 06:26:45 
general 2020-09-01 06:26:46 doesnt do anything
general 2020-09-01 06:26:55 but i enjoy watching a roundshot bounce of a tank
general 2020-09-03 19:00:54 "that's got to be the best pirate i've ever seen!"
general 2020-09-04 07:10:55 can i ask
general 2020-09-04 07:10:59 in dead man's chest
general 2020-09-04 07:11:06 why are they lifting up a cannon
general 2020-09-04 07:11:11 like
general 2020-09-04 07:11:17 i just wanna know why
general 2020-09-04 07:11:23 ever since i saw that movie
general 2020-09-04 07:11:32 in dead man's chest
general 2020-09-04 07:11:36 pirates of the caribbean
general 2020-09-04 07:11:42 the crew is lifting up a cannon
general 2020-09-04 07:11:44 with rope
general 2020-09-04 07:11:56 like literally just for the sake of lifting a cannon
general 2020-09-04 07:12:00 and it bugs me
general 2020-09-04 07:12:02 so much
general 2020-09-04 07:12:19 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0JbaZtoKAs
general 2020-09-04 07:12:23 there's the scene
general 2020-09-04 07:12:28 can someone tell me why
general 2020-09-04 07:13:18 but the thing is
general 2020-09-04 07:13:36 i wouldn't want to put a cannon on the damn crow's nest
general 2020-09-04 07:13:37 like
general 2020-09-04 07:13:52 where would they be putting it 😆
general 2020-09-04 07:14:01 the cannon is like
general 2020-09-04 07:14:06 at least 11 feet in the air
general 2020-09-04 07:14:17 and there's nowhere you would want to put it
general 2020-09-04 07:14:22 im boutta go to reddit
general 2020-09-04 07:14:25 or something
general 2020-09-04 07:14:27 this is bugging me
general 2020-09-04 07:15:01 but a ship
general 2020-09-04 07:15:03 despite
general 2020-09-04 07:15:05 being so big
general 2020-09-04 07:15:28 all of the cannons are generally where they would be during a battle
general 2020-09-04 07:15:30 except
general 2020-09-04 07:15:31 not loaded
general 2020-09-04 07:16:08 i'm about to go film theory on this
general 2020-09-04 07:20:17 
general 2020-09-04 07:20:18 my war junk
general 2020-09-04 07:20:20 the vanguard
general 2020-09-04 07:20:54 the best ship
general 2020-09-04 07:20:57 i've ever made
general 2020-09-04 07:21:01 because i suck at making ships
general 2020-09-04 07:21:32 my ship has mines
general 2020-09-04 07:21:36 so i can run from yours
general 2020-09-04 07:21:38 >:)
general 2020-09-04 07:21:57 i have a question though
general 2020-09-04 07:22:00 does that thing even work?
general 2020-09-04 07:22:15 i'm looking at the rudder
general 2020-09-04 07:22:16 and
general 2020-09-04 07:22:21 i use wings to turn
general 2020-09-04 07:22:22 but
general 2020-09-04 07:22:26 those arent wings
general 2020-09-04 07:22:47 i think mine is pretty effective
general 2020-09-04 07:23:36 well mine uses the rudder and the forward sail to turn
general 2020-09-04 07:23:39 REALLY TIGHTLY
general 2020-09-04 07:23:52 110
general 2020-09-04 07:24:41 
general 2020-09-04 07:24:42 Damn it
general 2020-09-04 07:24:45 i went into a turn
general 2020-09-04 07:25:27 fastest speed i've ever gone is like
general 2020-09-04 07:25:29 600
general 2020-09-04 07:25:31 then again
general 2020-09-04 07:25:36 i know none of the glitches
general 2020-09-04 07:25:39 or fancy tricks
general 2020-09-04 07:26:01 however i can confidently say that my war junk
general 2020-09-04 07:26:05 would flatten that man o war
general 2020-09-04 07:26:37 well
general 2020-09-04 07:26:45 the 16 mines that i have
general 2020-09-04 07:26:50 and all of those rockets
general 2020-09-04 07:27:29 yeah that's the point of where
general 2020-09-04 07:27:33 you come to what is called
general 2020-09-04 07:27:38 style over function
general 2020-09-04 07:28:16 my war junk
general 2020-09-04 07:28:17 is
general 2020-09-04 07:28:20 the ultimate
general 2020-09-04 07:28:23 junk ship
general 2020-09-04 07:29:15 aight there's the top speed
general 2020-09-04 07:29:15 
general 2020-09-04 07:29:27 
general 2020-09-04 07:29:30 and there's the rough
general 2020-09-04 07:29:34 draft of how fast it turns
general 2020-09-04 07:30:15 well it is suppost to be a war junk
general 2020-09-04 07:30:21 junks are very unusual ships
general 2020-09-04 07:31:10 oh and what do water jets do?
general 2020-09-04 07:31:16 are they like flamethrowers?
general 2020-09-04 07:31:22 i've never used them in combat
general 2020-09-04 07:31:52 remember boys and girls
general 2020-09-04 07:31:56 if you wanna turn faster
general 2020-09-04 07:32:00 use your sails
general 2020-09-04 07:32:07 and hope your ship doesnt fall over
general 2020-09-04 07:32:19 when you list like 15 degrees
general 2020-09-04 07:34:33 everyone talking about broadside cannons on ships of the line
general 2020-09-04 07:34:42 me and my ship designed to stern lock ships
general 2020-09-04 07:34:49 😆
general 2020-09-04 07:36:07 literally the uncountable amount of battles lost due to the enemy ship getting on the rear of the enemy ship and destroying the rigging
general 2020-09-04 07:36:50 victory has rear guns right?
general 2020-09-04 07:37:04 like 4 rear guns?
general 2020-09-04 07:38:03 
general 2020-09-04 07:38:06 idk i just wanna see my ship more
general 2020-09-04 07:41:18 when someone hits your magazine
general 2020-09-04 07:41:30 (the bridge is on top of the magazine)
general 2020-09-04 07:41:37 *team rocket blasting off again!*
general 2020-09-04 07:42:37 armor?
general 2020-09-04 07:42:39 what's that
general 2020-09-04 07:42:41 lol
general 2020-09-04 07:42:53 i've experimented with armor
general 2020-09-04 07:42:54 however
general 2020-09-04 07:42:58 i've found out that
general 2020-09-04 07:43:09 it's better to not get hit than to get hit and survive it
general 2020-09-04 07:43:48 an ap shell would go right through my ship and out the other end lol
general 2020-09-04 07:50:36 wait we're still using the iowa?
general 2020-09-04 21:22:17 air brakes are best brakes
general 2020-09-04 21:22:40 no for drag cars
general 2020-09-04 21:23:43 i've played plane crazy for a total of 17 days, 7 hours, and 6 minutes....
general 2020-09-04 21:23:47 what am i doing with my life
general 2020-09-04 21:23:56 that's
general 2020-09-04 21:23:58 a lot
general 2020-09-04 21:24:02 that's 500 in game hours
general 2020-09-04 21:24:06 yes of course
general 2020-09-04 21:24:18 like just imagine
general 2020-09-04 21:24:24 500 hours
general 2020-09-04 21:24:38 join me in pvp
general 2020-09-04 21:24:45 my name's the same as it is here

general 2020-09-08 11:01:06 add sails
general 2020-09-08 11:01:07 like
general 2020-09-09 02:43:10 Add wind
general 2020-09-09 02:43:23 Make it the same as the gravity slider if you need to
general 2020-09-09 02:44:05 You can make wind, you should just make it the same as the gravity slider
general 2020-09-09 02:44:10 Where it only affects your build
general 2020-09-09 02:44:47 Hah seaweed
general 2020-09-09 02:44:52 420 H20
general 2020-09-09 02:45:15 Well it kinda sucks because
general 2020-09-09 02:45:25 I know how to make some really cool sailing ships
general 2020-09-09 02:45:33 But because wind isn’t a thing
general 2020-09-09 02:45:41 Hey end up being powered by engines anyways
general 2020-09-09 02:48:12 Your a big no no
general 2020-09-09 04:18:49 I wrote it down in my server so I could use it later, sadly they removed it, this was back in pre alpha, when you had to pay to get into neo
general 2020-09-09 04:19:56 I have my own ship
general 2020-09-09 04:20:11 Her name is The Gilded Eagle
general 2020-09-09 04:20:22 I also have another ship named the vindicator
general 2020-09-09 04:20:38 It’s in a different game
general 2020-09-09 04:20:42 Both
general 2020-09-09 04:20:51 And the photos are on my computer
general 2020-09-13 05:03:51 that tank actually doesnt recoil that bad in game
general 2020-09-13 05:03:56 not bad at all
general 2020-09-13 05:04:10 it has an ear destroying sound and literally everyone on the map can hear you once you fire but i mean
general 2020-09-13 05:04:13 it's a good trade off
general 2020-09-13 05:04:20 for a shell that is essentially a bomb
general 2020-09-13 05:04:48 i can't seem to get a SINGLE hit at long range with that though
general 2020-09-13 05:04:54 i use it as a shotgun in the game
general 2020-09-13 05:05:22 being a howitzer
general 2020-09-13 05:05:28 the bullet drop is garbage
general 2020-09-13 22:57:39 the soviets
general 2020-09-13 22:57:44 as they were making the kv-2
general 2020-09-13 22:57:53 they wanted a heavily armored bunker buster
general 2020-09-13 22:58:15 so they essentially took a kv-1 (biggest tank chassis) and beefed it up
general 2020-09-13 22:58:28 And i might add
general 2020-09-13 22:58:32 they did a really great job
general 2020-09-15 01:32:01 i'm so good at dive bombing that sometimes i don't even pull up out of the dive
general 2020-09-15 01:32:30 **insert kamkazi fail videos**

general 2020-09-21 10:25:18 is there a material that bounces?
general 2020-09-21 10:25:35 like
general 2020-09-21 10:25:38 does grass bounce
general 2020-09-21 10:25:50 i understand that
general 2020-09-21 10:25:54 materials have different frictions
general 2020-09-21 10:26:01 but do they have different bounciness
general 2020-09-21 10:27:11 yeah
general 2020-09-21 10:27:22 don't try making a gun that reloads using suspension
general 2020-09-21 10:27:29 like
general 2020-09-21 10:27:34 i can make repeating cannons
general 2020-09-21 10:27:37 with magnets
general 2020-09-21 10:27:45 but i tried to do the same with suspension
general 2020-09-21 10:27:47 using kinda like
general 2020-09-21 10:27:51 a pinball
general 2020-09-21 10:27:55 type of
general 2020-09-21 10:27:58 mechanism
general 2020-09-21 10:28:06 you know where it pulls the spring back
general 2020-09-21 10:28:09 and when you let go it fires
general 2020-09-21 10:28:12 well yeah
general 2020-09-21 10:28:20 i figured out that pistons can bend
general 2020-09-21 10:28:59 yes but i don't make my weapons that way
general 2020-09-21 10:29:34 so i have a canister gun and a roundshot launcher
general 2020-09-21 10:30:15 the reason i'm looking for a material that bounces is because
general 2020-09-21 10:30:26 my cannon is not powerful enough to cause the roundshot to bounce on it's own
general 2020-09-21 10:30:58 yeah i use suspension
general 2020-09-21 10:31:10 it isnt any more powerful than magnets for me
general 2020-09-21 10:31:14 it just takes up less space
general 2020-09-21 10:31:40 
general 2020-09-21 10:31:47 it bounces like
general 2020-09-21 10:31:50 once or twice
general 2020-09-21 10:32:05 unless it hits something
general 2020-09-21 10:32:11 then it just flies back into the air
general 2020-09-21 10:32:27 i shall try springs
general 2020-09-21 10:35:48 springs arent even half as powerful as suspension
general 2020-09-21 10:35:56 so i filled the same gun
general 2020-09-21 10:36:02 with springs instead of suspension
general 2020-09-21 10:36:07 and it barely left the barrel
general 2020-09-21 10:36:26 disconnectors
general 2020-09-21 10:36:29 it's a one shot
general 2020-09-21 10:36:30 lol
general 2020-09-21 10:36:50 in the end
general 2020-09-21 10:36:56 suspension is the better
general 2020-09-21 10:36:57 well
general 2020-09-21 10:37:06 i guess if you wanna be able to fire multiple times
general 2020-09-21 10:37:10 so
general 2020-09-21 10:37:10 but i don't
general 2020-09-21 10:37:24 yeah but i've already used magnets
general 2020-09-21 10:37:31 and besides they lag my game a bit for some odd reason
general 2020-09-21 10:37:35 sus doesnt
general 2020-09-21 10:38:31 red looking kinda sus tho
general 2020-09-21 10:40:57 suspension also gives it realistic recoil
general 2020-09-21 10:41:01 it actually
general 2020-09-21 10:41:09 goes backwards when an object exits the barrel
general 2020-09-21 10:41:36 i tried making a cocking mechanism
general 2020-09-21 10:41:49 i have several designs that normally would work
general 2020-09-21 10:41:56 but the physics of plane crazy are a bit odd
general 2020-09-21 10:42:02 so i've settled on this design
general 2020-09-21 10:42:38 
general 2020-09-21 10:42:52 the black part is where the disconnectors are
general 2020-09-21 10:43:06 mounted on the outside of the barrel
general 2020-09-21 10:43:22 
general 2020-09-21 10:43:51 oh by the way
general 2020-09-21 10:44:06 if you have an issue about your balls falling out of your barrel in your railgun i have a solution for that too
general 2020-09-21 10:45:18 
general 2020-09-21 10:45:19 i also have one
general 2020-09-21 10:45:36 that keeps it in place
general 2020-09-21 10:46:00 and if you use ice in the barrel and for the wadding it doesnt interfere with the firing of the gun
general 2020-09-21 10:46:52 the cyclinder of sand is there
general 2020-09-21 10:46:55 because it looks cool
general 2020-09-21 17:32:31 
general 2020-09-21 17:32:32 Uhh what lmao
general 2020-09-21 17:32:37 Scam website
general 2020-09-21 17:33:22 Tbh i had no clue what kind of questions iq tests gave you and i just wanted to find out
general 2020-09-21 17:33:49 Literally like
general 2020-09-21 17:34:19 Well thats just common sense
general 2020-09-21 17:35:09 I want to find like a
general 2020-09-21 17:35:14 An actual iq test website
general 2020-09-21 17:35:31 Not some indian scam site that you get 100% on everytime
general 2020-09-21 17:35:58 Well how do i figure out my iq?
general 2020-09-21 17:36:01 Anyone here know
general 2020-09-21 17:36:06 Tell me if so.
general 2020-09-21 17:36:46 To you, maybe
general 2020-09-21 17:36:49 Not to me
general 2020-09-21 17:37:11 I love how your trying to point out what i already want to figure out lmao
general 2020-09-21 17:38:09 Well to be honest its because i kicked the shit out of someone but got outsmarted immediately afterwards
general 2020-09-21 17:38:41 So yes
general 2020-09-21 17:39:08 I want to figure out my IQ because im currently in an argument of which i am physically stronger but not mentally stronger
general 2020-09-21 17:39:36 Of course
general 2020-09-21 17:39:58 I dont really see anything wrong with that
general 2020-09-21 17:40:38 Most of the people who say “its just a number” are either pedophiles or smart, and you dont look smart to me johnny boy
general 2020-09-21 17:41:25 Big wordswow
general 2020-09-21 17:41:28 How about
general 2020-09-21 17:41:37 You keep pointing out your opinion
general 2020-09-21 17:41:53 And in return
general 2020-09-21 17:42:07 I will be my foolish self
general 2020-09-21 17:42:40 Gunpowder update pls
general 2020-09-21 17:43:08 Nailed it
general 2020-09-21 17:43:19 Like i really want them to add gunpowder
general 2020-09-21 17:43:40 Make it kinda like magnets that only move loose objects but like 5x as powerful
general 2020-09-21 17:44:24 Well so far i have concluded that
general 2020-09-21 17:44:37 Guns that use magnets are inferior in firepower
general 2020-09-21 17:44:50 To those that use springs
general 2020-09-21 17:45:02 No im talking literally about like a block of gunpowder
general 2020-09-21 17:45:29 It explodes, and when it explodes it moves loose objects EXTREMELY fas
general 2020-09-21 17:46:07 Thats cool
general 2020-09-21 17:46:08 But like
general 2020-09-21 17:46:15 Ive had that type of thing for ages
general 2020-09-21 17:46:21 Im sure everyone
general 2020-09-21 17:46:32 Has the imfamous explosive ball shotgun
general 2020-09-21 17:47:16 I feel like im one of the few people to realize that mortars are an even better form of magnet shotgun
general 2020-09-21 17:48:15 Its 25 when your brain stops developing
general 2020-09-21 17:48:33 Then it slowly gets worse
general 2020-09-21 17:48:55 Nerves start losing the power they once had
general 2020-09-21 17:49:08 Kinda like fried circuits
general 2020-09-21 17:49:22 Thats cool mate
general 2020-09-21 17:49:41 I would really appreciate it if you cut the attitude though
general 2020-09-21 17:50:12 Im of course referring to the fact that i’m not being shitty to you
general 2020-09-21 17:50:19 So why should you be shitty to me?
general 2020-09-21 17:50:41 It just doesnt make sense to me
general 2020-09-21 17:50:45 Out of nowhere
general 2020-09-21 17:50:49 Im not even speaking to you
general 2020-09-21 17:50:54 But stil
general 2020-09-28 05:39:43 if cutter blocks fly really fast
general 2020-09-28 05:39:48 does that do extra damage
general 2020-09-28 05:40:51 
general 2020-09-28 05:41:28 it's
general 2020-09-28 05:41:29 a mortar
general 2020-09-28 05:41:34 it does it's job well
general 2020-09-28 05:41:48 that's actually a motor
general 2020-09-28 05:42:03 the entire bomb is full of explosive balls and cutters
general 2020-09-28 05:42:05 in theory
general 2020-09-28 05:42:14 it's suppost to be like a standard high explosive mortar shell
general 2020-09-28 05:42:23 but i recently found out that cutters don't do anything
general 2020-09-28 09:20:52 paid for the whole speedometer, so I’ll use the full speedometer
