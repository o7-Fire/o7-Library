bot-central 2021-01-02 21:36:40 hey your fault for looking at the whole thing, when it's in pfp form you don't see the butt
general 2021-01-02 21:37:09 any plans to add a setting to pistons for speed ?
general 2021-01-02 21:37:21 i wanna make a Chevy car but the pistons are just too weak
general 2021-01-02 21:38:52 any reason they don't wanna add a speed setting to pistons ?
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 21:39:36 how does one make wheels
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 21:40:38 right i know, just can't get the motors to actually function right
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 21:40:44 i know i'm messing up somehow
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 21:41:12 not locked not unpowered, just can't get the spinning right
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 21:41:49 not sure my man not sure
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 21:42:15 tbh idk if i want to make the wheels like this, i'd have to hide the motors inside
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 21:56:14 i am back
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 21:56:24 still don't know how to make wheels, but at least i can be clueless on a full stomach
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 22:03:12 nvm got it
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 22:36:05 am i just dumb or are the premade wheels garbage
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 22:36:12 literally can't get those to work either
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 22:36:24 i thought so, i try to go forward and it just spins
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 22:36:33 ugh that's more work
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 22:39:28 k someone helped me fix it
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 22:48:19 my manz called it trash
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 22:48:23 also, my car bounces now
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 22:48:27 all i gotta do is decorate it
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 23:18:45 chevy almost done boys
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 23:18:59 gotta finish some more of it then painting
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 23:24:05 chevy mofockin' car, like the ones from every rap video before 2015
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 23:24:14 the ones that bounce
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 23:24:27 wish my springs were stronger, but it works i guess
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 23:28:42 it's called i'm uneducated
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 23:28:58 but thanks how i know ðŸ™‚
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 23:29:03 my manz failed that emote twice
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 23:30:58 ok well after making a critical error, i must start again
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 23:31:02 from the beggining pretty much
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 23:31:04 ðŸ™‚
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 23:34:19 anyway to move a specific group of objects ?
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 23:34:32 so i don't have to delete half my car and rebuild all the hard parts
plane-crazy 2021-01-02 23:37:05 also i found out you can make one of those Spinning Top things with anchor blocks and a jet + 2 motors, so that was fun
help 2021-01-02 23:44:07 can i not select separate bits of my build ? do i have to just delete half of it and remake it
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 00:04:16 this map is tryna show me how to do something, but he has no idea what he's doing
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 00:04:20 and it wouldn't work anyway
help 2021-01-03 00:31:09 any ideas how to make a wind shield ?
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 00:31:38 i cannot make wind shields to save my life
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 01:00:04 i don't understand what you mean by wing panels, i don't see how i can turn these into a wind shield
help 2021-01-03 02:34:54 hooooooold the phone
help 2021-01-03 02:35:03 i needed like.. the tiniest window, and i got it
help 2021-01-03 02:35:08 and deleted the build cuz it sucked
help 2021-01-03 02:35:44 it's actually impossible to make a working lowrider in this game
help 2021-01-03 02:35:50 i used those it worked out in the end
help 2021-01-03 02:36:05 if you make a low rider you either make it look good, or functional
help 2021-01-03 02:36:08 can't be both
help 2021-01-03 02:36:17 and either way it's going to suck ass
help 2021-01-03 02:36:37 i tried springs on the wheels and it worked
help 2021-01-03 02:36:43 but i had to shave 2 blocks off the car
help 2021-01-03 02:36:57 before that it would not even bounce up
help 2021-01-03 02:37:14 go for it
help 2021-01-03 02:37:24 some advice, give up while you still can
help 2021-01-03 02:37:34 it's not like other cars, cuz it has to be decently flat and long
help 2021-01-03 02:38:15 the least you could do is 3-4 blocks tall without a wind shield and shitty wheels
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 02:42:14 love how i tried to make a car in a game about planes and i still got mad when it turned out like shit
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 02:44:12 i made a machine that flings balls across the map like it's nothing, only realized that i accidentally made a lag machine when the entire server crashed
help 2021-01-03 03:02:08 if you do it then ping me with a pic of it, wanna know how others do
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 13:35:16 no
creations-chat 2021-01-03 14:31:29 damn thicc thighs
creations-chat 2021-01-04 23:08:47 aye looks really nice

plane-crazy 2021-01-11 22:34:18 How do yall make so much crazy shit, I had to redo the tutorial to understand the basics of making planes not do 1500 flips at the speed of sound
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 22:38:05 How dare you
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 22:38:15 I understand how 2 plane now doe
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 22:38:28 I like making a 1 block plane with long ass wings
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 22:38:41 It goes ape shit randomly and I love it
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 22:52:08 This game hurts so much on mobile
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 02:22:03 No more saying sus, now we say the Pretender is Mistrustful
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 13:34:01 do you have to use the garbage default wheels to make a car turn ?
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 13:37:27 ok then how do i do it
