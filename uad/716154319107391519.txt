DESC: Repulsors are like jets: They come in
Small, Medium, Large, and Super-sized.
The smallest ones are seen on Iron-Man's
gauntlets, and can be bought from the store.
They are not pay to win, however; You need to
get boots and gauntlets for stable flight on
a single person.

creations-chat 2022-01-20 00:51:56 This is supposed to be a recreation of the S.S. Carl D. Bradley, a steamer that sank in 1958.
creations-chat 2022-01-20 00:59:54 Lemme guess, it ain't as pointy as it should be?
creations-chat 2022-01-20 01:01:57 see, here's a fun fact about all lake freighters.
They all have bluff bows, which is to say that they don't use streamlined bows, like ones you see on modern ships, like destroyers, and SOMETIMES a cruise ship or two. That's why the ship doesn't have a nice bow to look at.
creations-chat 2022-01-20 01:05:06 ight. Quick question, which ship is that?
creations-chat 2022-01-20 01:11:18 it was both of them, actually. many ships have sunk on lake superior
creations-chat 2022-01-20 01:26:28 i did, in fact, read it. However, sadly, due to my capabilities with what i can do, it is impossible to do this.

plane-crazy 2022-11-09 22:39:10 so i have a question
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 22:39:38 if i was to build a 1:1 replica of a ship, particularily a great lakes freighter, how massive would it need to be?
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 22:39:44 as an example, the Edmund Fitzgerald
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 22:39:49 like, in width

plane-crazy 2022-11-19 23:58:52 anyone got a tip for ocean liners?
the-dump 2022-11-20 00:02:32 well, thats not what i expected
the-dump 2022-12-13 02:23:19 that face. that *fucking* ***face.***
plane-crazy 2022-12-13 02:24:00 gimme a source for that tank, im building it now
the-dump 2022-12-13 02:31:28 The specific reason I remember that face is Backrooms Entity 666. Cringe as fuck, i know; but hear me out. Basically, you head onto a website that seems like a cost-free piracy site; download any game for free. Then, an image of that specific face (wide mouth, massive pupils, never-ending smile) chases you; slowly at first, but ramping up enough speed that you can't avoid it, until eventually, you get caught and jumpscared; then, it summons itself (somehow, idk) and kills you; then speaks some holy shit to the last person you talked to.
the-dump 2022-12-13 02:31:35 Then it just leaves.
the-dump 2022-12-13 02:32:05 Thank god it's only fiction; the poor souls that would fall to it today.

plane-crazy 2023-02-26 05:55:16 the halves of the piston tube need to be reconnected into one tube, thus allowing for a reciprocating engine
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 05:55:51 the thing is, i cant get the halves back in place with any technique ive seen so far
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 05:57:31 ok i found the issue

plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:39:15 also, got any anti-air designs I can borrow ||or steal||
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:40:13 I need anti-air designs for slappin onto battleships
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:42:34 fr tho that anti-air design is gonna be imperative to my ships’ survival
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:44:00 I have a good idea for positional blenders tho
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:44:30 Basically a shredder on wheels using a giant 4-bladed motor
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:45:18 Plus, it would have to be used as defense
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:45:31 Smacks away 2-step explosives
