The Tale of frogtier (939960830181642330)
general 2022-03-06 18:08:54 hi
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 05:12:06 what is a good plane speed?
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 05:21:55 PVP, mainly air to air but some bombing of ships
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 14:48:21 I am determined to make an improved version of the shredder bug
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 14:48:25 never gonna use it
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 14:48:39 But gonna show others how to make it because I am evil
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 14:51:13 I am 3 and a halve years old
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 15:22:44 duh. I have killed dozens of shredder bugs in the past. Just wonder how much the design can be improved.
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 16:12:43 my plane always turns to one side even though it is balanced. Why
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 16:13:18 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 16:39:01 I made a plane and now I just need to give it landing gears, paint it, make weight better, add more wings/modify current wings, make it faster, and make a version with fuel tanks. Also weapons
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 17:23:49 are custom missiles worth it and if yes should I motor lock to have tons of them
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 17:39:17 is there a way to make a plane explode on impact or after getting shot once?
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 17:40:01 yah but tnt doesn't look nice
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 17:52:31 I am trying to make a plane with a stall speed of  â‰¤100 and a max speed of 1000. I also want it to have actual fuel in it
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 17:52:51 why
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 17:53:20 idk. Just for fun. I want to see if I can do it
general 2022-03-07 18:34:20 did the game update?
general 2022-03-07 18:34:36 me to
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 18:49:04 I made my plane ice and now its balance is off and it is way too light. Now it is light enough for me to add fuel to it

plane-crazy 2022-03-07 18:51:59 I am on a new discord account because I don't like getting pinged 1000 times a second like on my other account

help 2022-03-08 13:01:00 yes
help 2022-03-08 20:14:38 it still doesn't work anymore
help 2022-03-08 20:14:43 it did that that one time
help 2022-03-08 20:15:00 And I don't think it is lag because I have a good computer and internet

help 2022-03-08 20:39:17 like they disappear like they have been shot out
help 2022-03-08 20:39:21 but nothing is shot out
help 2022-03-08 20:40:45 I have tried while going fast and slow
help 2022-03-08 20:41:45 https://youtu.be/2at2Emo-ozs
help 2022-03-08 21:10:36 no, because mine doesn't appear at all and work while landed.
help 2022-03-08 23:40:35 progressions, now they spawn just very late. Not good but an improvement. guess I just gotta wait for plane crazy to fix itself
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:56:58 I found that the best amount of fuel for a small to medium-sized jet is 5000. It is the lowest amount were you can have. long sustained flights without to much weight issues. My jet goes 1000 speed
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:07:42 infinite fuel, infinite cringe. Cope/Ratio
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:09:04 fuel is cool because it make you battle wisely
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:09:34 You must choose if you should engage and it puts more pressure on you to get better bombing runs if you are a bomber
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:09:54 It is good for practice
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:10:11 trying to be competitive I keep a version with no fuel blocks
general 2022-03-09 14:11:59 is roblox down?
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 18:16:50 do we know if plane crazy 2 will have motor locking?
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 18:22:35 Just gotta repaint it, change some stuff with the wings, and add landing gears. I can't wait to be done.
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 18:22:43 idk
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 18:22:56 the ground is cosplaying as a smurf
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 18:23:38 ballast block at lowest setting is light but trapdoor is lighter
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 18:24:08 only new players use helium
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 18:31:28 littlebird
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 18:32:08 Actually do this thing
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 18:35:49 
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 18:50:46 I don't need a replacement. I don't do anything anyway
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 18:51:29 I just make dumb Minecraft videos, do homework, make planes in Roblox, and sleep
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 18:52:21 I'm not like everybody else, I am not depressed
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 18:53:18 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 18:54:26 nobody chooses to be depressed
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 18:57:02 you piss me off
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 18:57:55 you can't just stop being depressed
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 18:58:47 no you can't
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 19:00:00 I'm not talking to you anymore
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 19:01:05 you are delusional.
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 19:01:58 This banannazara guy is saying that it is someone's choice to be depressed and that you can just be happy
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 19:02:34 have you been depressed?
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 20:03:33 if you have a custom plane and put a tutorial missile onto it is it still a custom plane?
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 03:14:23 I am trying to use lights to decrease plane visibility in the day
help 2022-03-10 05:34:49 A rainbow circle that kept getting bigger appeared in the sky and now it works
help 2022-03-10 05:51:11 yah
help 2022-03-10 12:59:56 I found the issue. Apparently to make it work I have to set my time zone 1 hour ahead. weird
help 2022-03-10 13:00:22 and I did that for some reason before fighting the circle thing in the sky
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 18:19:27 I painted my plane [didn't change material] and now it goes 10 speed fast and turns quicker. why

plane-crazy 2022-03-29 14:01:24 I'm gay + you shut up
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 18:40:04 I can make decent build but can't paint anything good
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 18:40:17 what are tips for coloring a build
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 18:40:35 ?
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 18:41:15 I know what anti aliases is
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 18:41:23 but how does that help me paint something in plane crazy
general 2022-04-04 16:48:59 I use the xp-pen artist 13.3 pro. You have to connect it to your computer though
general 2022-04-04 16:49:55 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 17:18:50 Some kid got super mad at me because I attacked his boat which was already fully deystroyed and just stray blocks in the water
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 06:38:44 I just won a dogfight like this
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 06:38:56 My plane was still somehow fully functional
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 06:39:03 just slighty turned to the right always
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 06:47:05 this is what is keeping me alive
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 06:47:39 how do you still fight so well!!!
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 06:48:08 this is what I see
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 06:48:38 yah
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 06:48:46 sure
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 16:17:12 my plane is smooth at landing
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 16:17:24 only at 58-60 speed though
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 16:17:41 otherwise it just stalls
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 16:17:52 and fall out the sky
plane-crazy 2022-04-17 16:18:23 then I wont be going down smoothly
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 18:07:18 
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 18:07:27 I go fast and turn fast
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 18:07:29 also am op
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 18:18:27 it is very powerful
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 18:18:59 I don't actually shred anything with it
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 18:19:11 the shredders keep me more stable
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 18:19:27 I don't use the build often because it is kinda toxic
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 17:51:10 I found a way to make the missiles lay closer to the wing.
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 17:52:07 why can't I just share my progress in building
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 17:53:01 my plane is flat
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 17:53:27 landing gears are uneccesary
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 17:53:42 just repair the bottom of the plane after landing
plane-crazy 2022-04-19 17:55:07 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prmTbdovmQE video of how smoothly I land

plane-crazy 2022-04-21 15:56:48 Not a real plane [Based on a SU-27 and  Saab JAS 39 Gripen]

Hover Engines. [3 modes. 40 speed for landing, 700-800 for normal stuff, 1000 for fighting fast stuff]

Average to above-average maneuverability

Super short landing gears, bottom of plane must be repaired after every landing

7 rockets, 2 fireworks, 10 guns

Status: Still a prototype, not on sale
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 15:56:58 I am working on this, any suggestions to make it better?
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 15:57:58 bro. You really just said make a new plane
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 15:59:49 can you give actual feedback besides everything sucks
plane-crazy 2022-04-21 16:19:40 that doesn't help me improve at all. Making another plane probably will but that is just a given. Saying it sucks does nothing
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 18:55:51 Do I look nice
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 18:56:06 why not?
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 18:56:45 how do I look like a slender
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 18:57:07 my outfit isn't edgy
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 19:11:00 really, did you just say I look like a rogangster
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 19:11:17 no
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 20:46:31 why does everyone think it is edgy
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 20:47:43 which ones
plane-crazy 2022-04-24 20:48:10 that is true
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 04:07:53 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/962047136554434611/967999928129421312/unknown.png I hopped into some ones build and started acting like I made it to the person who made it lol
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 04:08:35 we moved to the next plane lol
plane-crazy 2022-04-25 04:09:52 they're just going along with it lol
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 02:10:57 The most "meh" cobra manuever ever. [Still a wip plane so it isn't fully balanced]

plane-crazy 2022-04-27 02:11:31 kinda?
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 02:12:19 That isn't a channel I use anymore. I have a different one
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 02:15:39 why you calling it a helicopter
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 02:33:06 why you so mean
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 02:33:14 there is a whole in my right wing
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 02:33:34 ðŸ˜¦
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 03:32:01 If you have a tutorial plane but change every part of it. Is it even a tutorial plane anymore? You couldn't have built it alone, but nothing is left of the tut....

This is deep
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 03:32:19 did you draw that?
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 03:32:58 I know
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 03:33:18 I'm not doing that, just wondering peoples opinion
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 17:40:18 I finally did it.
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 17:40:37 This took me way to long
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 17:40:49 BRO SHUT UP
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 17:41:09 Every time I say anything on this server someone is like "That is easy or that sucks"
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 17:41:24 why can't you just let me be happy
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 12:53:41 my plane uses mouse and wasd at the same time
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 13:08:40 I use it in hidden places you can't see
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 13:08:55 it is for the more fine movements
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 13:09:34 useful in a dogfights against small planes
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 13:24:48 my wings have trapdoors on them which acts as armor and to hide the control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 13:25:10 a lot of the time they get shot off
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 13:25:16 but they save the wing
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 13:25:24 which shows it works
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 13:25:39 yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 13:26:28 helicopter blades are just tons of small wings that spin
creations-chat 2022-05-02 11:55:24 what's so bad about my build
creations-chat 2022-05-02 11:57:06 is it the exposed motors?

plane-crazy 2022-05-13 22:17:59 can someone ping me please
plane-crazy 2022-05-13 22:18:11 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 16:23:49 how do you know when to stop improving one plane and just make another one

Not good, but not UwU
creations-chat 2022-05-18 21:03:11 why. I am getting rid of the UwU
creations-chat 2022-05-18 21:27:43 I just realized that since I added trapdoors now when I join a server everyone will call me a namnam tut when I am not instead of just 1 person.
creations-chat 2022-05-18 21:30:16 why?

general 2022-05-18 21:59:14 **What would be the best for a light bomber in Plane Crazy?**

.A few very big bombs

.A lot of small bombs that release at one and scatter across a large area

.5-10 medium-sized bombs released separately
general 2022-05-18 21:59:53 ok
general 2022-05-18 22:00:10 Imma make bouncy cluster bombs
creations-chat 2022-05-19 01:31:30 lol
creations-chat 2022-05-19 02:00:53 at least the thing works
creations-chat 2022-05-19 02:12:49 it works pretty well actually. I killed like 15 things in it. Mainly tanks but also an a10, a few bombers, and a few ww2 planes.
creations-chat 2022-05-19 02:14:31 mostly yes. And after every kill I said "UwU" in chat
general 2022-05-19 02:17:27 My creation is finally berried enough so people aren't voting on it

plane-crazy 2022-05-19 02:38:13 if I just add yaw control and change to using super rocket engines I can get the aeronautical engineer role

plane-crazy 2022-05-19 15:45:20 the planes I make are actually pretty functional

f**k this sucks and took 
16 hours to make
the-dump 2022-05-19 19:52:04 lol
creations-chat 2022-05-20 00:57:01 it wasn't originally an f16
creations-chat 2022-05-20 01:00:30 I would rather have a trash f16 than an UwU plane. At least the f16 doesn't make you want to commit self oof on sight
creations-chat 2022-05-20 01:03:45 It got 1 engine thing in the back and 1 vertical stabilizer. basically an f16

And it was built with no references in way to short of time. Close enough for me considering the circumstance

If I started making an f16 from the start [and planned it out] it would be better
creations-chat 2022-05-20 01:07:10 All of these are because the plane wasn't really starting as an f-16 and I wanted to finish the built and not waste time on it.

Also, the first point is wrong, my plane has no intakes
creations-chat 2022-05-20 01:09:17 I get more downvotes calling it an f16. Less downvotes than UwU  though ðŸ˜¦
creations-chat 2022-05-20 01:11:11 im gonna take a shower now.

creations-chat 2022-07-30 04:13:54 *Posts build that I am proud of in creations*

*Puts cringe Japanese text saying "Random ###### Name"  but vertical*

*Instantly gets multiple downvotes*

What is so bad about the build? https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/384025409945337856/1002788953293848656/AeroFoil_Cruise.png?width=655&height=655

creations-chat 2022-08-06 22:41:48 A few questions

can I see it?

Does it wobble?

Does it go straight?
creations-chat 2022-08-06 22:45:33 if something really goes over 1 million speed and not because the game glitches out I don't care what it is like. I will not be disappointed

creations-chat 2022-08-06 22:52:46 It looks like a tall and reskinned namnam jet.....

My best guess with the issue is some weird glitch with the motorlocking
