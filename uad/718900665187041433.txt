plane-crazy 2021-07-31 13:06:06 question has anyone suggested a 3x3x3 explosive block yet thats 30x more powerful than the normal one
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 13:06:35 nukes
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 13:06:40 dropped nukes
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 13:06:54 if you could increase the blast radius that would be better too
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 13:07:38 i think i used the wrong word
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 13:08:28 would it be op if you could edit the blast radius of explosives
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 13:10:02 i currently have 37 bombs in my mortar round lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 13:10:14 actually no hold on
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 13:10:25 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 13:10:35 i couldve extended it to the entire length of the plot
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 13:10:37 but im too lazyh
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 13:11:06 kinda
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 13:11:06 i am

plane-crazy 2021-07-31 13:32:06 dang
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 13:37:10 have tnts explode nearby tnts too when one explodes
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 14:08:47 i think i just broke explosives
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 14:08:56 theyre not blowing up when i press the keybind
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 14:09:10 oh
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 14:09:11 im an idiot
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 14:09:23 yeah my bad
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 14:09:25 im justdumb
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 15:14:19 hey guys any tips on what to use to make this thing turn
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/837082838599335946/871048053929439322/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 15:14:38 not sure if propellors would work unless i put like 5000 of them
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 15:15:39 last time i tried that they went apeshit
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 15:16:44 oh fair
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 16:51:19 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/837082838599335946/871072421808046100/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 16:51:21 I DIDNT SAVE
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 16:52:13 i was making a nuke
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 17:34:45 hey i successfully made a nuke
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 17:34:47 kind of
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 17:34:52 i used all 150 explosives so
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 17:35:36 i havent tested it out that way
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 17:35:38 it kinda just
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 17:35:39 drops
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 17:36:19 its just like a 3x3 compressedpack of explosives
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 17:38:18 should i try and make it steerable
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 18:06:11 i made a nuke but
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 18:06:17 i think we need more than 150 explosives
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 18:06:42 no like
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 18:07:06 i just have a 3x3 atom bomb
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 18:07:09 thats on a car
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 18:08:48 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833347699720978432/871091975242280980/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 18:08:49 it doesnt look pretty but it explodes
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 18:09:44 shush
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 18:09:49 ill do a better design next time
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 19:00:20 <@!837694608094789653> i made it look better
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 19:00:32 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/833347699720978432/871104582695145492/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 19:26:25 im gonna try and make a chinook to carry the nuke
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 19:29:23 well
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 19:29:31 its an atom bomb tbh
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 21:27:29 how hard is it to make helicopters jesus
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 21:27:39 i just want a chinook to carry my atom bomb
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 05:31:35 hey guys
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 05:31:42 i figured out a way to drive my atom bomb
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 05:34:37 hover thrusters to make it float
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 05:34:51 then a hover engine for back and forth
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 05:34:55 and super engines for turning
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 05:41:57 this is the best thing ever
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 05:42:03 i get to drive a literal nuke
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 05:42:14 that if you explode when its touching someones build it just vaporizes them
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 05:47:54 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:41:45 should i make more nukes in the game
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:42:20 wtf
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:42:43 is it made out of those sneakers that change color when you heat it up or something
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:44:38 also i saw someone earlier this day with an ICBM missile ingame
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 10:44:41 so that was pretty cool
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:21:55 i finished the fatman nuke
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:22:10 it has 82 bombs https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718904729085673593/871351998484717598/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:23:11 i think this one is gonna be easier to carry too
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:23:17 than the atom bomb
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:23:29 that thing was basically impossible to carry for me
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:23:33 since i dont know how to properly make helicopters
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:30:07 now does anyone know how i can lift this thing and be able to drop it on someone
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:30:52 heli i dont think i can make
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:31:07 a giant balloon probably tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 11:53:46 i just saw the toppat clan ship dive into the crevase of the canyon filled with lava
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:21:41 
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:21:46 came back to this in game
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 13:39:32 why is someone in game with a racecar circling my plot while blasting eurobeat music
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 13:39:40 im literally here making a plane carrying a nuke
creations-chat 2021-08-02 01:10:28 yeah I shouldn't have opened this chat
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 01:48:46 has someone made a battle bus yet
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 01:49:10 it'd be funny though
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 01:49:20 Especially if you add a nuke in the bus that you can drop on peopke
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 01:50:05 would it be possible though
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 01:55:15 can someone make a kamikaze battle bus
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 01:55:39 I don't even play fortnite
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 01:55:58 It'd just be funny to drop an exploding bus on someone
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:03:10 fabric wheels lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:03:49 fabric wheels for me worked even on my basically plot sized mortar on a car
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:05:43 put a doorstop on the front wheels
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:14:17 I have a nuke
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:19:24 I still don't know how to do cars properly
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:20:14 I'm gonna try making a cybertruck later
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:50:45 has it been suggested yet to add an option for explosives to detonate other nearby explosive blocks when one blows up
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:52:30 someone is having a mech fight
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:52:33 they have battle music too lmao
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:18:16 i did it
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:57:17 spam ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:57:25 motorlock ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:23:43 trying to learn how to make a guided missile from scratch with no tutorials
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:24:01 idk why there arent any tutorials that actually explain you why its built like it is
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:24:08 would help a lot more in understanding it
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:25:24 i just wanna learn the tracking part
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:25:48 if you know the tracking part i think you can just add motorlocked tnts attached to disconnectors
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:25:58 im talking about custom guided missiles
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:26:04 trying to learn how to make them
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:35:46 what the hell is a pontoon
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:58:19 and im here getting around 4 - 8 shredders in every server i join
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:58:41 and its probably why i make a lot of exploding builds
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:58:53 no i literally have a nuke
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:59:01 an atom bomb that has all 150 explosive blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:59:04 and some explosive balls
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:59:11 shredders will attack anything
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:59:38 i just have a turret on the bomb to annoy them and bait them
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:01:23 ill only be impressed by a shredder if you make it look like a giant flying death worm
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:02:33 LOL
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:08:23 should i try and put this thing on a car
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:10:11 a mortar
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:10:36 the mortar round has 62 bombs
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:10:50 
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:12:41 wheres shin godzilla
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:40:59 w
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:44:27 if i put a shredder on a nuke
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:44:34 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:44:35 cutter
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:44:37 iif i put acutter on a nuke
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:44:48 will the flying parts of cutter be dangerous
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:45:02 its like a frag grenade
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:45:03 but a nuke
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:45:47 dang
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:45:56 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:45:59 what if i make a machine that like
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:46:11 springs a wall of cutters forward with suspensions
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:46:32 dude i can make a car that can violently punch other things
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:46:44 what
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:47:20 when i fire my mortar usually the round is able to bounce someone when it htis them
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:47:45 what if i did that but it its just a wall that springs on you
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:47:46 with cutters
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 07:13:10 isis the metal material tougher than the normal one or does it not change that?
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 07:57:07 im bored
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 07:57:09 what should i make
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 07:57:48 i only have like
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 07:57:58 
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 07:58:53 should i try making a boat
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 08:00:39 i stll have a lot less
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:46:22 i still dont know how you can properly turn this
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:46:29 atleast without having each wheel turn separately
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:46:35 because it doesnt like that when i do it
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:51:22 because i dont know how tank steering works
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:51:27 ive never made a tank before lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:51:41 i did try using rockets and propellers
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:51:48 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:52:24 wait so wouldnt this make going forward holding both left and right
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:52:53 huh
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:52:57 wait is that why tanks have 2 motors
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:52:58 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:53:05 makes sense
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:53:13 aight ill try that out later
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:55:41 wad movement lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 10:55:56 i wanna see a game that has wad movement
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:13:44 you reminded me of one of my first builds
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:14:03 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:14:12 
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:14:13 this
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:14:30 i should remake it at some point
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:14:33 it drove pretty badly
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:14:49 actually
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:14:55 i think i just need to
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:14:56 change the wheels to fabric
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:17:07 it worked kind of
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:17:16 the wheels still jitter
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:18:15 just needed to set the torque higher
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:18:20 now it works like a charm
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:19:36 its kinda ugly
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:27:42 welp
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 11:27:53 time to recreate an actual irl missile
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 12:12:40 i done it
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 12:14:56 k-13 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 12:22:50 im sad
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 12:22:50 it doesnt fly properly
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 12:23:22 nevermind
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 12:30:39 i am happy with this missile that i made
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 13:21:31 do you think i can put an ap round on my k-13 missile
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 13:21:38 the one that prototrode did
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 13:23:31 wheres shin gojira
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 13:25:23 laser
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 14:42:24 left this guy a present
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 16:03:05 i made a funny
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 16:03:40 its funny if you get destroyed by this thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 16:03:44 because its your fault
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 16:03:54 the thing moves at 45 speed max
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 16:04:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 16:04:26 cause i used a simple conveyor thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 16:04:34 it was before i knew how tanks worked so yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 17:42:58 hey guys
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 17:43:12 how deadly would it be if i made a cannon that launched a rotating cutter
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 17:45:31 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 17:49:26 should i make a steam roller
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 17:49:32 but with cutters
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 20:59:00 how effective of a camoflauge is it for submarines to be colored black
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 20:59:27 for my basic tutorial sub i colored it green
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 20:59:41 specifically the same color as the floor of the ocean
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 20:59:55 a train
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 21:00:12 idk but this is pretty cool https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/871847514385547264/Screenshot_2021-08-02_151025.jpg
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 21:00:46 but uh
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 21:01:00 is black color for subs really the best camo for them
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 22:28:16 i finished my first custom sub
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 22:29:29 
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 22:32:06 not yet
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 22:35:56 changed the color
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 23:03:53 🤨
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 12:34:34 i successfully dropped a nuke one someone
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 12:34:45 using hot air baloon
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 12:36:38 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 12:36:43 WAIT
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 12:36:46 you jus gave me
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 12:36:48 the best idea ever
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 12:36:59 im gonna remake the Balloon fromclash of clans
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:18:57 what does restitution do
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:18:58 in ropes
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:19:10 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 14:16:48 im gonna make a steam roller
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 14:16:53 with cutters
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 14:17:36 another person who made a nuke?
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 16:37:31 is it possible to make treads out of cutters
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 16:37:37 ithat would be cool for a chainsaw
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 16:38:27 at the outside of the treads?
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 16:55:13 man magnets are so much more easier than what i was doing
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 16:55:26 im gonna make a new cannon that uses magnets to launch nukes
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 20:37:48 first set of weapons done for my new sub
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 21:10:12 are rocket engines slower inwater
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 21:12:44 aight
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:06:41 though i wish they had a 2x2 triangle wedge
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:07:28 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:07:31 like how i did with my nuke
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:07:48 that i managed to succesfully make it so you can drop it from a hot air balloon
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:07:59 wym scatter bomb
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:08:08 all the sides are made out of compressed motorlocked explosives
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:08:19 and all of them are set to detonate on impact
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:08:30 its hard to get a perfect hit
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:08:36 but if you get a proper hit with it
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:08:45 it genuinely vaporizes whatever it touches
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:09:11 though
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:09:16 i did make a scatter cannon earlier
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:09:41 tnt
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:09:49 shredder users will attack anything
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:09:56 even something that obviously looks like a giant nuke
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:09:58 trust me
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:10:33 ^
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:10:53 do what i did and attach a turret to an atom bomb
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:10:57 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:11:17 or go in the water
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:11:37 you cant say that it wont work
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:11:42 because when i did it
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:11:44 it did work
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:12:10 and?
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:12:18 i have an atom bomb here
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:12:39 all of the shredders that attacked my atom bomb
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:12:43 got slightly stuck
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:12:49 which gave me a chance to blow them up
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:14:37 i cant find a picture of the actual atom bomb one but i have this one https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718904729085673593/871351998484717598/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:14:46 this one has 82 explosives
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:14:59 but the other one has all 150 explosive blocks and some explosive balls
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:28:47 someone should remake the weird giant flying tictac ufos
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:41:39 has someone remade the giant flying tictac ufo yet?
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:44:17 how powerful do you guys think shin godzilla is
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 15:25:45 for some reason my submarine suddenly became insanely laggy
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 15:25:57 no its not
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 15:26:10 yesterday right before i got off
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 15:26:13 it was just fine when testing it in the water
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 15:26:20 i just joined ingame right now and made no changes at all
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 15:26:31 and for some reason now its butchering the physics lag
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 15:26:40 aight
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 15:32:18 what should i make
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 15:32:22 im bored
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 15:32:24 should i make more nukes
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 15:37:43 im going to make a death worm
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 15:46:14 probably because i cant build what they want me to
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 15:46:24 so i just build something that i come up with later on
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 15:51:10 use wedges
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 16:53:19 decided to be an asshole an deliver a nuke on someones plot
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 16:53:28 this is what happened to them
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 16:57:26 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 18:12:15 hey guys
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 18:12:23 how the hell do i make suspensions not go apeshit
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 18:13:32 thanks but what kind of configuration
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 18:13:42 changing stiffness nor damping doesnt do anything
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 18:15:37 damn
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 18:15:43 cant insult the suspensions
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 18:16:50 god
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 18:16:58 this is why i hate making cars
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 18:17:38 im just gonna do tank steering
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 20:28:51 yay
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 20:46:35 hey guys i made a cool robot arm
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 20:46:45 it can yeet things
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 07:03:05 and here I am making a giant mining drill for people that wants their builds crushed
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 16:26:54 how are people talking like this
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 16:27:37 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 17:33:48 🤨
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 00:44:24 why isnt there a corner wedge 1x2
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 00:44:47 not that kind
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 00:45:18 the left one
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 00:45:24 but longer on the point
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 00:46:02 yep
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 00:52:04 somehow i made this shape work
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:06:00 someone did it
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:06:25 i cant
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:06:31 im busy working on my build
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:08:45 testing is the most painful part for me
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:09:03 it took me a whole day to do movement maintenance on my submarine
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:09:06 and its still not even good
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:21:56 man i do *not* know how to stabilize things at all
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:25:21 i used helium blocks for mine
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:25:37 it flies pretty straight when taking off but then tips on the tail
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:28:02 ok i made it kinda stable
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:28:14 started tipping when being in the air for too long anyway
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:35:16 is it ok that i made the rotors rotate back and forth for turning
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:35:24 or is that a something thats gonna be problematic
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:36:03 helicopter gods bless me with knowledge
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:40:23 Counter rotating?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:40:52 I mean I already tested it and it works
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:40:59 And its straight to when turning
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:41:18 My main issue is it still tips on the tail when flying up
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:54:32 what do pilot seats do
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:54:34 the normal blue ones
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:56:41 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:57:09 dang its not configureable
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:57:46 is it not possible to like
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:57:57 say have the main pilot seat control  the aircraft movement
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:58:06 and have other pilot seats control guns and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:58:21 dang
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 01:59:03 cringe
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:08:02 this thing is still not stable
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:08:11 i suck at helicopters
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:09:33 i made the stablizers able to move
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:09:47 when i point it down while moving the heli up
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:09:53 the heli just kinda
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:09:54 turns
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:16:01 alright
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:16:02 i need help
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:16:11 on how to properly fly my helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:16:53 i did watch destroys heli basics
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:17:09 but i dont think thats gonna be the end all be all solution to heli issues
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:17:13 especially when mine is custom
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:41:56 this helicopter is giving me immense amount of pain
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:50:59 screw this helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:51:38 im just gonna make a battle ice cream truck
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:01:15 im gonna kill someone
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:06:36 i got blacklisted after calling this malaysian airlines flight 370
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:06:43 i didnt even go to their plot
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:18:40 gonna try to remake this heli
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:24:34 how am i supposed to do this
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:24:40 send help
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:25:46 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:25:47 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:25:53 yucky
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:26:45 which one
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:27:11 theres like 7 half block wedges
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:28:09 this kinda works
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:28:11 just put a normal wedge
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:29:15 <@!739369649971527720> youre in my server
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:29:30 youre right beside me actually
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:29:35 i didnt realize
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:29:48 i was probably either too irritated at the helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:29:51 or looking at images
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 06:26:28 can someone make a shredder but make it a giant flying freddy head
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 06:26:40 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 06:55:58 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 06:56:01 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 06:56:03 decently accurate?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 06:56:31 do i look like i know how to do frames
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 06:56:42 this is my first time making a helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 06:56:54 probably because im gay
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 06:58:07 i would keep using this instead but its so inconsistent on flying
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 06:58:34 a what
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 06:58:47 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 06:59:03 it does
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 06:59:22 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 06:59:39 not sure if that'd change the consistency of its flight
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:00:27 the how straight the thing is when hovering depends on the speed of the rotors
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:00:37 which ig would actually be fixed if i removed the hover engines
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:00:40 hold on
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:01:21 what
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:04:34 removed the hover engines
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:04:39 basically now it cant fly
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:05:48 nah
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:05:56 i dont wanna use fake rotors since the actual rotors are used when turning
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:06:38 rotor spin but they dont actually lift your build
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:34:37 <@456226577798135808> i found something funny
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:34:49 apparently i can move forward by just moving the stabliziers on the back up and down
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:35:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:35:38 if i make the stabilizers straight
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:35:41 it move forward
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:35:46 at the cost of constantly going down too
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:41:00 ice cream truck
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:41:52 damnm
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:21:25 anything i can do to make this thing stop constantly turning to the left when just hovering?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:21:51 everything is perfectly even
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:22:21 no like
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:22:27 im not pressing a or d
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:22:32 but it veers to the left
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:22:59 the actual wing panels?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:23:10 they spin inwards opposite
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:23:42 nope
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:23:46 there are swashplates though
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:23:51 i think thats the term
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:24:02 or not
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:24:37 the rotor blades rotate from motor 2s
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:28:00 unsure if i can because of my crappy pc
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:28:07 but i do have a private server that i can send
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:30:05 https://www.roblox.com/games/166986752?privateServerLinkCode=20090103927855094870010720437721
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:30:06 here
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:31:25 yeah dw
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:49:57 has anyone suggested a 1x2 corner wedge yet
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:50:03 and im not talking about the one that we already have
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:51:28 okay but
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:51:30 2x2 triangle wedge
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:51:53 with it we can finally make builds look circular length wise
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:51:59 instead of either a semi circle
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:52:02 or a diamond
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:52:36 thats the issue
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:52:43 im talking about like
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:52:47 hold on
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:53:21 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:53:22 this
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:53:46 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:54:03 if it existed i could make the giant flying tictac ufo
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:55:54 also would be able to make more shapes other than this
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:55:58 or this
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:58:27 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:59:55 what kind of aircraft is this called anyway
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:00:47 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:00:54 i dont know honestly
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:01:05 i took inspiration from the SA-2 Samson
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:01:34 type
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:01:45 it cant be a model name its i made it from scratch
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:01:46 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:01:52 bruh bruh bruh
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:01:56 it has one issue right now
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:02:11 it keeps constantly turning right
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:02:12 even without me turning it
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:03:00 i can turn joins on i think
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:03:28 joins on everyone
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:03:29 names GrapeLeaf
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:09:03 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:10:07 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:49:13 welp
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:49:18 atleast we fixed my aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:50:08 what should i even call it
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:50:58 its inspired by the SA-2 Samson
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:51:02 well
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:51:08 the rotors are
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:51:40 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:55:10 how many species of spiders are there
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:55:42 im gonna settle for naming it over a snake actually
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:01:28 <@!237943056643522561> i think i found out the issue
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:01:36 lower the torque helps but
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:01:39 unless the aircraft is going forward
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:01:47 its gonna turn regardless
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:01:59 that or it was because of the stabilizers
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:16:59 did you not see
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:17:12 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:17:17 i dont think this help much at all though
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:17:30 it does help straightening out the aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:17:37 buut the veering is still there
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:19:05 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:19:16 the main idea for the thing was a helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:19:17 not really a plane so i count those as stabilizers
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:19:32 Python-10
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:20:10 i think this game just hates me
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:20:10 but uh yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:20:49 stabilizer?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:20:54 or the whole aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:23:17 any changes in particular?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:23:26 the fuck
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:25:38 ok yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:25:41 i hate this thing now
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:25:55 aircraft i tried to make
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:26:05 for some reason any time of thing i make in this game barely functions
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:26:08 unless its missiles
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:26:20 missiles and bombs are the only things i can do correctly for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:27:13 being in charge of making bombs and explosives can be boring though
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:27:15 :sadge:
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:27:18 like man
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:27:27 i just wanna make an aircraft that drops a bunch of explosive balls
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:27:44 hell i cant even an adequate submarine
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:28:43 <@!237943056643522561> wanna know why im 99% sure the game hates me?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:29:06 even if i follow tutorials
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:29:07 and do it the same way they do
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:29:11 it still breaks
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:29:24 like bruh its the same thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:30:02 its been 3 days for me
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:30:05 ive built 2 subs
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:30:09 both dont work
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:30:13 atleast not decently
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:30:16 no not really
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:31:04 the issue with mine is
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:31:05 its too slow
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:31:09 cant balance it properly
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:31:13 turns too slow
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:31:26 cant properly balance pitch
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:31:33 it sinks too slow
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:31:40 and thats an unarmed submarine
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:32:06 basically
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:32:12 if i use normal water propellers
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:32:13 its too slow
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:32:17 if i use something like a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:32:18 its too fast
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:32:29 too fast that the pitch balancing fails
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:32:54 yeah a jumping submarine is cool and all but that would get me bombarded by every single battle ship in the ocean
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:34:59 should i just try to recreate the actual SA-2 Samson?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:35:37 did an attempt of ti earlier
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:35:40 but it pretty much looks like shit
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:35:49 its like the actual helicopter on ultra low graphics
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:35:51 poly even
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:36:16 its the helicopters from avatar lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:37:01 what about the dragon assault ship
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:37:27 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:37:33 this behemoth
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:37:59 the real pain is
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:38:06 thefact that i dont even *know* how to do frames
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:39:03 might just stray away from vehicles for the time being anyway
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:58:01 <@!755389462443458611> i made the main body
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 11:58:54 heres the barely accurate body of the heli
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:25:36 its a fucking sheep
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:26:06 you cant handle the truth
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:32:30 what should i try to build
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:32:38 so far submarines and helicopters dont work
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:33:18 unarmed or
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:34:00 i made this custom aircraft earlier https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/873155981448728596/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:34:02 but
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:34:14 its flight is atrocious
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:35:43 the aircraft veers to the right
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:35:48 i thought putting a horizontal rudder would help
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:35:55 it didnt
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:35:56 but i just decided to keep it
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:36:50 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:42:49 i still dont know how to fix my aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:43:21 veering to the right when not even turning
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:43:26 i already got 2 people to help
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:43:30 nothing worked
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:45:26 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:45:33 i didnt turn once to get here
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:54:35 should i try building a floating carrier
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:54:56 surely with propellers on all four sides wont cause it to go apeshit and veer everywhere
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:57:14 fuckit
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:57:21 ill just make an armed ice cream truck
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:58:49 it already has a retractable missile on top
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:59:03 im im gonna add guns and have the entire bus split open on the sides
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:59:07 to reveal a bomb inside
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:59:43 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:59:44 bomb inside
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:59:53 bus splits in half
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 12:59:56 ot truck
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:00:02 then ram into someone
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:00:06 explode bomb
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:02:15 or i can just have the entire casing of the truck pop off
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:02:20 so you'd just be driving a bomb
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:14:23 hey guys what kind of suspension settings to i need to not make it go apeshit
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:17:16 https://gyazo.com/41655534c6c9a2d69a374e615a43e9a9why do suspensions do this
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:17:27 https://gyazo.com/41655534c6c9a2d69a374e615a43e9a9
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:17:35 load gif
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:18:20 the torque is default
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:18:24 ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:21:19 https://gyazo.com/5ee61cb1e31e990180038bc180fc19ba?token=dae6a4912b87204925eba8e8493fb988 ayo it can drift
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:21:49 i pushed the person on my plot off the map with the thing too
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:22:06 idk probably custom guided missiles
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:22:39 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:30:13 is this too big
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:30:35 dang
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:32:52 this new era means no motor lock = bad build
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:32:57 i think
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:35:20 does it count as a shredder if it only functions in the water and it has a jaw that you use to chomp on boats and subs
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:35:36 it was a joke
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:35:38 mostly a joke
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:36:40 how would you rate this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/873155981448728596/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:36:43 atleast the shape
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:36:52 idk
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:36:53 something i made up
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:37:22 ok so
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:37:28 imagine this thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:37:33 but put the propellers on a plane body
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:38:10 <@!582834773773254656> will you rate my armed ice cream truck after i made it
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:38:13 make*
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:39:15 im gonna try making it a pretty build
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:39:17 key word
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:39:18 try
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:39:21 also dont worry
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:39:28 im not posting it in creations
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:39:29 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:48:56 <@!737466938279591946> what about my plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:48:58 do you like my plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:49:28 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/873155981448728596/unknown.png <@!737466938279591946> do you like my plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:49:49 no its not
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:49:50 its bad actually
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:49:58 stabilization is horrible
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 14:13:01 sawed off tank barrel
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 14:15:07 make a plane that flies like a helicopter with the parts of a plane and functions on the water like a boat
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 14:15:28 and looks like a train
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 14:15:44 what the fuck are pontoons
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 14:16:22 when will someone make this ship https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/873167887102275644/latest.png
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 14:16:43 it should be 2x3 plots big
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 14:17:05 controlled by multiple people
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 14:17:15 each rotor is one plot each and controlled by four people
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 14:20:01 holy crap its malaysian airlines flight 370
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 14:20:33 more players would be fun though
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 14:20:36 you could do a proper war
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 14:21:01 guys i think he meant the size of the plot
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 14:24:46 oh jesus ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 14:34:04 HELP GUYS
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 14:34:06 oops caps
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 14:34:13 help guys i dont know how to make an ice cream truck
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 14:52:42 is there a plane crazy group for Manufacturing Explosives and shit
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 15:08:26 bomb inside of the ice cream truck
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 15:09:54 the bomb is a last resort
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 15:10:04 since you have to disconnect the hull of the truck
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 15:10:35 i dont wanna spam this truck with a thousand motorlocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 15:11:27 🤨
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 15:14:20 windows vista
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 15:31:00 i have an idea on how to make my ice cream truckdeadlier
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 15:31:03 cutters on the front
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 15:52:15 its coming together
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 15:52:26 the ice cream truck of impending doom is coming together
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 16:18:20 prop armor
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 16:58:53 guys the ice cream truck of impending doom is close to being done
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 17:22:53 guys
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 17:23:07 the Ice Cream Truck of Impending Doom is done
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 17:25:33 when the truck gets beaten up you can eject the hull for this bomb
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 17:30:44 should i post it in creations
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 17:31:25 wanna know how i can describe it even worse
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 17:34:00 When the truck is in poor shape after battle, it can shed its skin, exposing its most deadly weapon before ramming at the opponent and detonating, killing off the truck and its opponent
creations-chat 2021-08-06 18:35:42 how many blocks does it take up including the motorlocks lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 18:54:23 wym
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 19:22:08 theres a bomb inside too
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 19:22:30 and well
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 19:22:35 basically the whole truck is a bomb
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 19:22:40 since it has tnt armor
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 19:28:38 or they get shot by the minigun right at the stall opening
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 23:38:19 if you're gonna make a shredder make it look cool
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 23:38:26 idk make a giant flying space worm shredder
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 23:38:43 Devourer of Gods shredder
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 08:15:24 <@237943056643522561> vmon
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 08:15:29 Did you see what I made last night
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 08:15:51 what
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 08:16:44 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 09:38:53 the ice cream van of impending doom
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 09:39:46 <@!237943056643522561> https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/873265162226901063
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:28:44 why does that ship looks like if you even put a single penny on the either side of the boat its gonna capsize
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:29:24 im p sure because he cant test explosives in non pvp
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:30:40 and i thought spawn killing was hated from how many times people said it ingame lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:32:18 so the same thing for shredders minus the strongest players part
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:33:21 i have a shredder thats a giant worm
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:33:41 if this even count as one
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:33:49 i left
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:33:50 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:34:08 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:34:14 the mouth part doesnt spin
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:34:17 it opens on all 4 sides
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:34:42 
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:34:47 btw it can roar
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:35:25 id say its too slow to be one
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:35:27 like trust me
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:35:28 its way too slow
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:35:51 its also doesnt have the same maneuverability as a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:36:00 since its steered by wasd its a lot harder to aim
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:37:52 missiles
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:38:00 my ice cream truck of impending doom is more for looks
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:40:11 my submarine uses a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:40:20 which can make it fly in the air
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:44:04 this is mine
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:44:24 it has a bomb inside it
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:45:25 
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:46:04 
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:46:07 no but theres this
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:46:35 actually the entire truck is a bomb
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:46:49 the ejected hull can blow up too
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:50:17 tip
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:50:18 make missiles
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:50:37 the best way to fight people is by blowing them up
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:50:56 One time is all you need
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:51:06 I have a missile with all 150 explosive blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:51:20 its highly ineffective because those explosives are spread across the body
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:51:27 instead of focused on the head
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:51:34 though
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:51:36 i do have a mortar
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:51:52 with a 3x3x5 round that has 62 explosives
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:52:03 a proper direct hit vaporizes builds
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:52:05 and thats not a joke
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:52:10 its happened multiple times
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:53:02 your server is laggy as hell lmao
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:53:22 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:53:30 getting a direct hit like that though is p hard
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:53:49 im in non pvp
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:53:51 cause i just joined
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:53:59 when i join another pvp server i just join the same laggy one
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:54:00 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 11:16:16 
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 11:28:43 is there a rockremix of an ice cream truck jingle i can use for my armed ice cream truck
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 11:49:56 should i try to make a big build
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 11:50:16 not sure how well its gonna go considering i cant even make a custom bicopter build hover correctly
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 11:53:44 imma try building afloating carrier
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 11:53:47 since thats probably easier too
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 12:09:59 amazing
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 12:12:00 its disc stal
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 13:54:59 this is fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 13:56:53 still
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 13:56:59 fun thing to fly
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:08:29 fold
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:08:49 no really
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:09:00 ive seen an actual commercial plane in game thats just fold
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:09:13 wouldnt say 4 plots exact
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:09:18 but i do remember visually
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:09:33 
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:09:35 it was this big
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:09:53 do you see the red circle
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:10:02 thats how big it was
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:10:05 from what iremember
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:10:09 gamma
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:10:13 5 plots are literally outlined
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:10:17 are you blind
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:10:49 how is a plane thats almost a 1/3rd of the base size
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:10:50 tiny
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:11:14 what
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:11:30 it wasnt that long from what i saw
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:12:00 not including the tail
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:12:00 from what i saw i think it was this long
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:12:43 its literally a 1 plot difference
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:12:52 i didnt even count the wingspan
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:13:19 also wouldnt motorlock technically make it harder
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:13:25 since you're gonna need a tower for it
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:16:31 so my ice cream truck
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:17:41 yknow im curious now
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:18:08 how many professional builders would be annoyed or struggle while building if there was a building contest at which you cant use and motorlocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 14:19:41 what are you gonna make it be though

plane-crazy 2021-08-08 03:20:27 i can make an actual ufo
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 03:20:37 question mark
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 03:20:43 no i mean like
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 03:20:57 one that doesnt perform using normal laws of movement
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 03:21:08 it can stay perfectly still in the air
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 03:21:16 and then move at a constant rate
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 03:21:24 and then come to an immediate dead stop
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 03:21:30 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 03:21:51 ok let me just show you an example
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 03:22:40 https://youtu.be/SpeSpA3e56A?t=413
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 03:22:43 flying like this
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 11:50:00 has anyone made a b2 yet with real life accurate wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 11:51:06 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 12:01:32 shredder but the cutters are rockets
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 12:05:06 cutters are but rocket the shredder
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:36:05 i will make an airship for my first folded build
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:36:47 aight
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 16:27:28 you know what would be really useful
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 16:27:47 if you could edit the properties of all blocks of the same type
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 16:27:53 like the bucket tool for painting
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 17:01:18 should the tail be longer
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 17:03:14 custom bi-copter bomber thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 17:03:16 idk
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 18:17:02 <@!237943056643522561> you there?
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 18:17:12 i redid the craft i made but in a smaller scale
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 18:17:16 for some reason it still has the same issue
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 18:19:23 apparently it was the stabilizers
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 18:19:25 not sure why
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 18:19:35 man i hate making planes
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 18:20:47 ok so basically
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 18:20:52 you know the plane that i made?
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 18:20:55 that was giving me a lot of shit
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 18:21:34 redid it to be smaller and found out that the veering was the stationary stabilizers fault
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 18:21:46 since i removed them from the smaller version it doesnt turn anymore
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 18:52:40 i found out how to make my airstrike cannon go past the map with one angled shot
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 18:52:44 can we make the map bigger
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 18:57:22 oh god
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 19:05:41 i made something reat
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 19:05:52 great
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 19:05:53 https://gyazo.com/03d5bf0d1a13c0edd9e322da1bb2c506
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 19:10:32 its an airstrike now
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 20:43:00 you know they can just set a different spawn point right
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 20:43:37 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 20:43:52 i too like to instantly teleport to the airport while i was waiting for them at their plot
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 20:52:38 change your build
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 20:52:42 build some time else
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 21:26:23 is it possible to keep the wings near the bottom but still have it be able to fly
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:27:01 anyone in here can help with angle lock?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:27:07 or well custom angles
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:28:58 trying to make a tail like this but when the motors lock after the tnt the wing panels just kinda glitch
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:29:26 on the rotating motors?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:29:30 no since i used motor 2s
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:29:37 but it still glitched when i tried using normal motors
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:30:12 it wasnt
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:30:19 i had it binded to quote
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:30:27 but ill try it again using normal motors
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:30:32 give it a few tries to see whats wrong
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:30:42 or see if it still breaks
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:30:46 then how am i gonna
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:30:48 rotate it
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:00:39 should i not use tnt for custom motorlocked angles
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:19:55 https://gyazo.com/88e2a4c5b92fcd3ce07e1939d6fcc9a9
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:20:06 ^why i dont like making planes
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:20:59 i dont think i did
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:21:10 this is my first time trying to custom angle
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:21:33 yeah thats a lot better now
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:26:31 this looks like shit
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:26:52 was supposed to be this but smaller
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:26:58 but i do not know how to make planes
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:27:00 or any aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:28:28 is it bad that i have 5 days in this game and i cant build even an adequate plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:30:48 most crap i make are missiles or bombs
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:34:25 no like
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:34:27 i only have 2 planes
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:34:30 1 tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:34:38 and one is a custom jet
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:34:51 both of them i basically never use
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:36:19 this is my only proper good build
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:36:26 and this build is a joke
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:37:13 inside the truckj
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:37:35 theres a bomb in the truck
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:39:17 i just counted and i have 7 bombs
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:39:29 3 are missiles and the rest are nukes
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:50:55 fuck sleeping
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:50:58 im gonna make a zero gravity bomber
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:53:04 no im just gonna make a ship that goes ontop of peoples plots
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:53:11 release a warhead
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:53:14 then send it flying down
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:53:24 or i could leave a trail of floating tnt balls
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:53:27 then set grav to normal
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 02:03:16 perfect
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:01:01 idk why i did this
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:01:29 satellite/spacecraft that launches a warhead
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:02:53 boredom
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:03:45 question
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:03:48 will magnets work in zero gravity
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:04:16 Who knows
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:04:21 perfect
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:04:28 time to attach a scatter cannon to a satellite
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:16:26 i found the cart titan
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:43:07 apparently a jawed shredder moving at 500 speed is somehow deadlier than a normal one
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 05:27:31 my Orbital Warhead Launcher right ontop of a bunker
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 06:23:03 ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 06:46:46 what do you call a tank that weighs 32,000 tons
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 06:46:57 i was gonna say that
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 06:48:19 what do you call a satellite that launches a plot sized spinning platform full of cutters
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 06:48:48 correct
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 06:48:58 your mom
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 06:51:11 just like your mom
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 06:51:28 i your mom'd you first
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 06:51:34 so youre the most your mom'd
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:34:15 my armed shredder is like 600 speed
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:34:22 any faster and it decides to have a seizure
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:34:28 a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:34:29 but with missiles
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:34:41 just think of it as a fighter jet
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:34:45 but it looks like a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:35:24 i mean technically my worm counts as a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:35:53 just go fast
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:36:48 wanna see my kind of shredder

plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:34:04 is that why your giant amogus boomerang was made of ice
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:35:08 arc
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:35:09 now the whole plane has a seizure
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:35:16 is it because the wingpanels has a material
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:37:02 weeell
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:37:03 https://gyazo.com/be3177e5daa9dd56c94f6039c630b99d
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:38:24 weird
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:38:28 aight
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:40:26 that worked
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:40:27 well
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:40:29 temporarily
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:40:35 and it still doesnt take off
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:41:10 well
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:41:21 earlier when i tested
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:41:28 before i put the giant ass covers
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:41:35 it was able to fly
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:41:40 of course not properly
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:41:48 but since i put those covers it couldnt take off
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:42:04 and now it just glitches since i changed it to ice
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:42:12 weird bc i never changed the settings after it was able to fly
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:44:16 20
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:44:25 tried setting it higher and that broke it more
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:44:37 low
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:44:39 like 2
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:44:49 the motors that make it spin yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:45:45 still no lift
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:46:26 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:50:25 <@!262097738169188362> no lift
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:50:29 50 speed
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:51:41 ok question
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:51:49 do the top and bottom ones need tobe reversed
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:52:42 i just change them so they do that now
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:52:42 well
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:52:44 but earlier they werent
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:53:01 though
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:53:03 theres still no lift
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:53:09 and it just violently shakes
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:54:40 ive built like 2 iterations of this plane now
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:54:47 https://gyazo.com/415f42569ac5599ac5db552a1236f213
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:54:53 it just has crippling anxiety
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:55:18 wert
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:55:23 its a bicopter
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:55:31 earlier it was able to fly
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:55:46 earlier it was able
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:55:47 to fly
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:55:51 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 09:56:11 plus its not heavy
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 10:02:32 <@!262097738169188362> ok so apparently im just stupid
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 10:02:42 since i actually didnt set the motors to spin the same way
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 10:02:43 i wrong
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 10:26:40 claustrophobic cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 10:27:27 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 10:27:39 wym
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 10:27:46 the top is just motorlocked
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 10:27:51 thats why its not there
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 10:27:55 im in build mode
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 10:28:09 are you telling me to add a ceiling?
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 10:28:38 because theres a ceiling
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 10:30:22 still dont get what you want me to do
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 10:33:37 i just did this instead

plane-crazy 2021-08-10 13:01:21 oh it does work
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 13:01:26 the lower motor part is just
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 13:01:27 broken
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 14:42:08 <@!262097738169188362> basement time

plane-crazy 2021-08-10 14:46:39 have a more powerful blacklist thats toggleable
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 14:46:43 you cant hurt their builds and they cant hurt yours
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 14:53:30 nuke block
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 14:54:23 depends
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 14:54:37 does having 3 missiles, one of which is 5 missiles in one count
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:23:38 is it normal to spend 6 hours trying to stabilize a bicopter hover
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:23:42 *just* the hover
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:24:32 pain crazy
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:26:21 im gonna make some coffee
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:26:32 and take a break from making this bicopter that drops 97 explosive balls
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:38:31 ok but is it actually normal to spend like
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:38:36 6 hours or more on stabilizing hover
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:39:38 lemme show you mine
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:40:15 
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:40:27 me and arc has been going at this thing for 6 hours
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:40:35 just to stabilize hover
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:41:02 wym
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:41:20 its currently packed with 97 explosive balls and two motorlocked bombs
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:43:09 cross section of the bomb unit of the bi copter
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:49:49 i made the bomber like that because
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:49:55 i like my carpet bombing cannon
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:49:58 and i wanted to do it from the air
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:50:01 make it actually rain bombs
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:54:15 i never talked in general
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:54:15 what even happened
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 16:54:16 lmao

plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:25:14 even the flying sus was no match
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:25:31 the bombs landed so hard on the flying sus
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:25:35 it just disappeared from existence
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:25:36 LOL
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:28:05 LOL

plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:30:05 FUCKING PLANE TRIED TO MISSILE ME
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:30:10 THEN GETS VAPORIZED
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:33:02 ok yeah this cannon is super ineffective against grounded targets
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:33:14 probably because im chuking 139 bombs
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:33:21 at mach 10
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:36:26

plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:37:40 
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:37:46 front of this got vaporized
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:49:39 <@!262097738169188362> i have an idea
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:49:43 doomsday cannon

plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:51:13 literally point blank
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:51:32 i think i made the most powerful thing ever
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:51:35 even worse than lag machines
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:51:56 wait
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:52:06 did i
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:52:09 im gonna try joining
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:52:26 no no i joined a pvp server
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:52:32 also
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:52:36 Lets do innovation time
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:52:40 take the doomsday cannon
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:52:47 take out all the explosive balls
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:52:49 replace them all with cutters
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:53:13 dang
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:58:41 this is the best thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:58:42 ive made
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:58:43 ever
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:58:56 its so deadly it can crash servers
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 17:59:10 sure as hell lives up to the name
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 18:00:49 <@!262097738169188362> also
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 18:00:54 i can aim it straight up
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 18:01:00 so i can literally make the Rain of Death
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 18:23:29 <@!262097738169188362> i have decided to start my first fold project
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 18:23:59 a giant satellite that rains down all 300 explosive balls/blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 18:25:27 wont happen
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 18:26:01 wont happen
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 18:26:10 itll all come raining down when i turn on gravity
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 18:26:13 and lock my satellite in place
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 18:33:10 nope
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 18:33:16 if that was the case
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 18:33:26 my doomsday device would go tearing down
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 18:33:27 but
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 18:33:32 it fires the bombs so fast
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 18:33:39 and the bombs are set on impact
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 18:36:45 i wonder how painful this is gonna be to fill up
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 19:17:38 this looks like the virus from animation vs animator
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 19:18:14 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 19:21:27 first wip of my first fold build and also my Orbital Calamity Storm Initiator
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 19:21:29 long ass name
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 19:35:06 not bad
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 19:36:21 wym
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 19:55:55 doesnt need any
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 19:56:01 its supposed to rain all 300 explosives
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 20:18:28 i like how you ignored the other person that started it
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 20:22:44 is this adequate for a first fold build
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 20:23:16 its a satellite
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 20:23:29 a satellite that rains down all 300 explosives
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 20:24:08 no one but since its the main feature about the build you'd think it would be an important detail
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 20:24:22 why wouldnt i say it
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:03:28 they should add more explosives
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:03:38 300 is barekly gonna take up space here
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:03:45 and this is just half of the barrel
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:06:29 not sure what kind of dimension you live in but a lot of people in this chat wants it
general 2021-08-10 21:07:59 has this been sent here before https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/837082838599335946/874760872738832424/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:10:25 i think
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:10:34 you would need bigger propellors
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:10:38 if its gonna carry aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:11:14 pain crazy
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:11:50 yeah but thats unrealistic
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:12:25 fair enough
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 21:12:32 still would be good attention to detail but you do you
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 06:23:05 <@262097738169188362> I have started my first big project
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 06:23:17 a satellite that rains down all explosives
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 06:23:24 
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 06:23:28 all 300
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 06:24:47 who knew the first fold build I would make is one to end all humanity
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 06:25:57 I wonder how much worse this one will be
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 06:26:16 Considering my doomsday cannon with only 97 explosives managed to crash a server
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 06:27:57 It crashed the whole server
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 06:28:19 and I think temporarily unplugged pvp servers because arc and smiley couldn't join pvp servers for a short amount of time
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 07:10:51 thicc
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 08:11:01 
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 08:15:47 
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 08:54:07 made the most annoying tank treads ever
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:26:39 chainsaw treads
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:27:15 the right treads are having issues for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:27:23 trying to figure out whats wrong
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:28:31 this is the tissue
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:28:55 i think its caused by the suspensions
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:28:57 which is weird
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:29:05 since the left suspension is the same as the right one
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:30:40 https://gyazo.com/32bd8f760207b9b0e08300572eaba6b8
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:31:15 the left side is practically the same as the right side
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:31:20 but the right side decides to do that
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:32:34 you think i havent done that very obvious solution
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:32:42 none of the tread motors are on
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:32:52 and i said before i suspect its because of the suspensions
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:33:05 the left suspension stretches less than the right one
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:33:12 evne though they have the same settings
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:33:29 Yeah no
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:33:49 I already said its completely symmetrical
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:35:08 its not materials
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:35:15 the wheels and the chain links are fabric
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:35:25 and yes ive done pretesting before i added thecutters
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:35:26 it worked perfectly before
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:35:30 and no its not the cutters
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:35:36 because theyre also symmetrical
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:36:48 arc
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:36:50 the right track does not want to cooperate
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:38:09 https://gyazo.com/b0dc43b59a0ac8387ef901f7a4ef4339
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:38:18 weird ass suspensions working differently
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:38:25 even though they all have the same settings
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:38:29 i think this game just genuinely hates me
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:41:33 wym back motors
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:41:47 they arent
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:41:47 just checked
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:42:23 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:42:34 did 3 loops on checking the outer motors that control forward and backwards
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:42:36 theyre all the same
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:42:54 therye all the same too
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:42:59 all four of them
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:43:07 do you see why i say this game hates me
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:45:18 thats weird
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:45:24 why does it work on the left then
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:45:31 but not on the right
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:46:00 if this was the case wouldnt this mean it wont work for the left side too?
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:49:19 i hate everything
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:50:18 i think im gonna delete the cutters
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:50:26 way too laggy
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 09:50:26 theyre too laggy

plane-crazy 2021-08-11 11:47:58 its just a worm
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 11:48:03 but since it has cutter teeth
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 11:48:07 its kinda  a shreder
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 11:53:21 what
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 11:55:05 slower
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 11:55:07 and it dies easier
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 11:55:12 a single rocket kills it
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 12:43:21 yeah

plane-crazy 2021-08-14 01:03:39 probably because its an abbreviation and not a shortened word
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 01:03:57 all you had to do was search up inb4 in google

plane-crazy 2021-08-14 01:21:39 its missing the turd
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 01:21:54 you should make a weaponized toilet that fires turds
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 01:22:09 make it bigger
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 01:22:11 make it tank sized
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 01:22:22 make a toilet tank that fires shit
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 01:23:51 electroshock therapy
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:04:05 my man's made the most ineffective shredder ever
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:04:57 if you think cutters is gonna help your defense then I feel sorry for you
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:05:18 you're gonna get bombarded by tnt from every single direction
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:06:08 That doesn't do anything when you get blown up by everyone AND yourself
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:06:48 and then you get blown up again
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:06:56 and then your blow yourself up again
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:07:08 same thing happens
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:07:35 or get this
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:07:49 Someone could stand in front of your cube, just barely touching the cutters
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:07:55 And melt everything with lava spitters
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:08:31 it moving doesn't work
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:08:57 have you seen the abundance of missiles, bombers, kamikaze planes or cars there are
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:09:08 you would just get nuked over and over again
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:10:16 
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:11:03 It looks like a fucking amongus pancake
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:11:12 And is that a tut tank
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:12:02 if you're trying to make a joke build either its not funny
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:17:59 then cry
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:20:32 <@404632014189494293> you know what's probably the most cursed part of that jet
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:20:42 He has a super rocket to pitch him up
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:21:06 probably becuase you're only using control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:21:23 instead of motor 2d wing panels as elevators
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:21:42 Motor 2 isn't motor locking
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:22:03 Then why didn't you just
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:22:11 Put more control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:22:46 Yeah no it's not
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:22:50 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:22:58 nah

plane-crazy 2021-08-20 09:30:42 since i just looked up how to do thin treads
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 09:30:49 the treads were originally normal ones

plane-crazy 2021-11-03 03:23:23 my seat goes to a random direction

plane-crazy 2021-11-03 03:56:02 a b2 crashed into me and our builds got destroyed
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 03:56:06 rickje will this come true

creations-chat 2023-05-20 09:13:07 maybe
it cant fly anymore because i tried making it mouse aimed but issues occured
mainly that when i unanchor a physics anchored block the part inside becomes too lose because everything else is heavier
creations-chat 2023-05-20 09:19:52 brain of cthulhu with eye shredders
creations-chat 2023-05-20 09:42:42 not sure how thats gonna fix anything since the main issue is that the part that makes everything mouse aimed is too light compared to the rest of the build so instead of the build rotating around that control point, the control point is the one that rotates, this doesnt happen when the control point is physics anchored though, but if its unanchored then i cant mouse aim it

general 2023-05-20 13:48:49 oh
