bug-reports 2021-09-05 09:27:19 I have a report!
bug-reports 2021-09-05 09:27:36 Motor 2 is bugged.
bug-reports 2021-09-05 09:31:48 When you put 180 degrees on motor 2, it will make F and R randomly have the same or different directions, I was building a giant spaceship with folding, and use motor 2, I apparently need to assist the mechanism to fold easier with rockets, yet I do not want any or all kinds of propulsion devices on my ship till I finish the design and other parts first, please try and fix it.
help 2021-09-05 09:48:34 How to send a picture to creations chat?

bot-central 2021-09-05 10:25:18 Huh.
help 2021-09-05 10:26:45 Oh and, Mee6 says we should use "/rank" not "!rank", that is a sign of lazyness.
bug-reports 2021-09-05 10:40:24 The thing is it will be looser than motor 2, I cannot use regular motors they can easily unfold, motor 2 keeps a constant so when it unfolds by a some glitch or being hit, it will slowly come back to the normal position.

general 2022-01-28 13:57:23 I wonder how far they got with remodeling in PC2, like how much is left?
creations-chat 2022-01-28 14:15:08 What do you guys think of my builds I posted in <#384025409945337856>?
creations-chat 2022-02-01 16:23:46 This boi is about to go on a rampage, it will destroy.
creations-chat 2022-02-24 21:29:42 I need some feedback, is this a good car, it can drive and it can drift, it is loosely based on the Ae86.
creations-chat 2022-02-24 21:38:35 Maybe a bit farther away, and add a T section to the body to attach the engines.
creations-chat 2022-02-24 21:41:44 Make an extension to the side of the body like a sideways T for the engines.
creations-chat 2022-02-24 21:44:45 See the OG image, and how the body is made for the engines to attach, well add a sideways T frame, then put the engines, then build the shell around them.
creations-chat 2022-02-24 21:46:57 Sometimes when building a ship already made, you gotta make the frame then the components and last the shell, but make the components strong to lift with the shell on.
plane-crazy 2022-02-24 21:48:10 Ok, but I am not gonna be on for too long, I might get off soon.

the-dump 2022-03-02 23:43:59 Yes, why?
the-dump 2022-03-02 23:44:38 Well, do it, but if the build is not a lag machine, but a foldable build, then no.

the-dump 2022-03-02 23:50:19 Still cannot call me a weeb, since I did nothing to prove that, other than just posting a simple harmless gif, then you coming out of nowhere to call me something I am not, and not the slightest shred of reason for doing so, stand by your word and make yourself happy by calling someone a weeb without cause.
the-dump 2022-03-02 23:51:27 Ok...

creations-chat 2022-03-28 16:13:25 And am I missing something that I need to add so it does not glitch or break, like the build flexing wrong so I cannot move?
creations-chat 2022-03-28 16:21:45 I need something that can help the wheels not fold into the body.
creations-chat 2022-03-28 16:24:32 I need something to prevent that.

creations-chat 2022-03-28 16:48:25 I need something to prevent the wheels from folding.
contest-chat 2022-04-05 14:43:00 I have many ideas for spaceships, I have made my own book of basic shapes that I can build as a frame then make it into a basic form for my ships external greebling, engine placement, and even some interior work, the shape I chose was an H shape, I hope to finish in the next few days though or before the dead line.
contest-chat 2022-04-05 14:46:23 That or I might go for a knife shape, one of the 2, and by knife, I mean a vertical knife that has the seat at the top, or middle, half way down the hull.
contest-chat 2022-04-06 14:49:07 Its been 2 days since I have started working on my ship, and I love it, more needs to be done.
contest-chat 2022-04-07 10:49:16 RIP the AN-225 Antonov.
contest-chat 2022-04-07 10:52:17 Also I think I know how a shield bubble works.
contest-chat 2022-04-07 10:52:35 Its possible to build in real life.
contest-chat 2022-04-07 10:56:42 All we need is some powerful magnets that repel and attract, magnetic velocity gel that hardens on impact, and a lot of power to sustain such a structure, like fusion cores, the gel will be pushed to a certain distance while also being pulled back, so it will be locked into place.
contest-chat 2022-04-08 14:45:21 I am almost done, I cannot wait to show you guys the ship, I went for an H shape, if you look at the ship from a top down view, and draw a sort of skeleton of the ship, or an H, you will see it, just need some wings, rockets and landing gear.
contest-chat 2022-04-08 14:49:14 Is there a restriction against zero gravity?
contest-chat 2022-04-08 14:49:40 And hover engines?
contest-chat 2022-04-08 19:10:57 A contest can also have restrictions, and event usually will not have that many restrictions.
contest-chat 2022-04-08 19:11:52 I also asked if there were more restrictions not listed, I know this is a contest.
contest-chat 2022-04-09 14:33:35 Just finished my ship, wanna see it?
contest-chat 2022-04-09 14:34:21 Its a small ship so it was fast to build.
contest-chat 2022-04-09 14:36:34 The Helix Scout, manufactured by Helix.
contest-chat 2022-04-09 14:42:32 The ship has four rooms, the interior is done, but I mostly focused on the outside, there are more seats for those who want to ride, and it has working landing gear turning, no roll or any other kind of movement sadly, it can operate in low to zero gravity, and is fast going at 332 studs per second.
contest-chat 2022-04-09 14:44:17 I also have another ship to show soon, I also have the basic shape/frame ready to be used to build, cannot wait.
contest-chat 2022-04-09 14:45:23 I am using the triangle shape as the inspiration.
contest-chat 2022-04-09 14:50:18 Star Wars used the triangle shape for ships, because the shape was to give off the feeling of power.
contest-chat 2022-04-09 14:50:46 The Star Destroyer Class was the best example.
contest-chat 2022-04-09 14:54:30 Then you get one of my favorites, the best space yacht, the 890J from Star Citizen. I gotta say, its a beautiful ship.

contest-chat 2022-04-16 02:43:22 The newer show is just perfect, though I wish I could recreate the full Voltron combined mech and just fly around in Plane Crazy, maybe in PC2 I can do just that.
contest-chat 2022-04-16 02:46:44 Huh, at least if I did make it fly and even walk, it would be more of a monument to my hard work, but since things like the Lion is right now impossible for now, it will just have to wait.
contest-chat 2022-04-16 02:48:11 Still do not need you input, sorry.

help 2022-06-02 14:46:56 I posted my mech after I built it, also no one ever called me a white name, since for the first few days of not posting and I got Expert Robotic Specialist.

help 2022-06-02 14:48:35 Also I have not forgotten about you, what is your real answer?
help 2022-06-02 14:49:13 Ok, what have I ever done to you HMMMM?
help 2022-06-02 14:49:52 ITS A POD RACER, it is supposed to look like that.
help 2022-06-02 14:50:43 Ok, what do you think a pod racer is fundamentally?
help 2022-06-02 14:52:36 It hovers, it is fast and also has to have two engines that are connected by a coupler, a design is dictated by the components and aerodynamics, this pod racer is not to look like a specific one.
help 2022-06-02 14:54:11 This is not an answer that I asked for, I asked what a pod racer needs fundamentally to be called one.
help 2022-06-02 14:55:48 Fundaments, functions of a thing, and item with basic functions can be called fundaments that can be shared between different looking things that are classified the same.
help 2022-06-02 14:57:05 Well, I cannot make something look like it was welded with such details, nor scratching, carbon scoring on something that is made of blocks, since it is small.
help 2022-06-02 14:57:43 You try motor locking something like that and keep its balance.
help 2022-06-02 15:01:19 A lot more effort and difficulty, since motor locking with hover engines can be a balancing nightmare because the model design could be a problem, and also just to be clear, my pod racer is perfect anymore newer components could mess it up.
help 2022-06-02 15:02:16 What a solution that would do NOTHING.
help 2022-06-02 15:03:07 Ok, just let it be, all I cam here for is to classify it, you had to start this whole thing.
help 2022-06-02 15:03:39 You keep telling me to do more work with the build when I can fly it perfectly the way it is.
help 2022-06-02 15:05:47 Like when you are building something and you need help with classifying it, I will just be as rude and blunt about it, and say oh it is bad, even if you are still building it, I would not add a note saying when you finally finish it.
help 2022-06-02 15:06:52 Not yours, mister blunt block head.
help 2022-06-02 15:09:23 You weren't. [Grummn88} "What would my pod racer be classified as?" [vykmr}"bad"
help 2022-06-02 15:09:43 Is this helping me?
help 2022-06-02 15:12:36 Starting now, I am blocking you, since you said first time it was bad, and keep saying it is through out the whole time, and here and there you would follow what TheSmartFishy said, and nothing of your own volition.
help 2022-06-02 15:14:39 Yeah after you said something that could help me, and kept saying it was bad, so is saying something is bad and then following what someone else is saying and not something more constructive helping?
help 2022-06-02 15:16:14 I know that is why I came here to classify my pod racer and not get it called bad.
help 2022-06-02 15:17:40 As something of the real world, like a plane, a spaceship, a boat, or an experimental vehicle.

help 2022-06-02 15:18:09 What?
help 2022-06-02 15:19:24 You came up with something to help me, but the other guy just followed what you said, agreed to what you said, and did not say something else to help but still said he helped, like really?
help 2022-06-02 15:20:26 What part of helping does calling someone's build bad first be considered be helping?
help 2022-06-02 15:21:15 I read, and when someone never respond, I said someone who is not an a$$.
help 2022-06-02 15:22:03 Well, I try not to.

help 2022-06-02 15:24:38 Well, when no one else responded, I said someone who is not rude basically.
help 2022-06-02 15:25:39 And do I need to repeat myself on why some specific person was not helping me at all while another was?
help 2022-06-02 15:29:39 TheSmartFishy came up with something to help me, but the vykmr said my build was bad a second after me posting, asking "What would my pod racer be classified as?" and vykmr just followed what TheSmartFishy said, agreed to what TheSmartFishy said, and did not say something about what I should do to help but still said he helped, like really?
help 2022-06-02 15:30:47 One from someone I am not gonna enjoy.
help 2022-06-02 15:32:43 A list he never asked me first before TheSmartFishy did, the one who was nicer to me, and not calling my build bad right away.
help 2022-06-02 15:34:42 Well Ima forget vykmr said anything now.
help 2022-06-02 15:37:19 Oh yeah the list that you suggested one by one, and totally not TheSmartFishy who was actually helping me, you just quoted everything TheSmartFishy said.

help 2022-06-06 15:38:09 I forgot how to suggest.
bot-central 2022-06-06 15:38:43 ?help
bot-central 2022-06-06 15:39:09 ?suggest Ion and Hydrogen rockets, a new area outer space to use the new rockets, Ion works best in space, hydrogen works best in atmosphere, this can also be a good update to add the gravity boots/block idea, for the ball joint idea, add timer, and, or, X or, repeater, comparator gates so we can make the ball joints move at full potential, sensors for color and proximity, ball bearings to allow a build to have better configuration without using any glitches.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 09:26:55 B1-Sentry is getting a new pair of legs, and so far it is looking great, the legs that the mech will use are called digitigrade legs, most notable for their speed and jump force.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 13:35:53 My mechs legs are now built, time to put some functionality and paint it.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 13:41:25 Vykmr thinks he is giving "good advice" or "helping" others, but really he only just agrees to what someone else says that is actually helpful and says he is the one who said all of those helpful things, when really he calls someone's build bad or ass the second it was posted.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 13:45:31 Like me building a fun little pod racer as a side project with no real goal, and asking what I would classify it as one of the many vehicle classes, I never asked for help but vykmr just insisted.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 13:47:49 Because it is a good build? Dude tried his best, and honestly I do not see both of you doing something like that.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 13:51:14 In Plane Crazy, you really do not have much to work with, and even so, with motorlocking you still would not get any better than that.
creations-chat 2022-06-07 13:53:31 It looks the same, just at a different camera angle.

help 2022-06-08 15:40:48 86 - 90 Score, just a little more, but since then, I was able to make a completely new change to my mech. First image is the old version, second image is the new version.
help 2022-06-08 15:53:16 Whatever.
help 2022-06-08 15:54:59 I said, it is gonna get a paint scheme, and some details, did I ever say it was completely finished?
help 2022-06-08 15:57:01 You really do not need to say that, it is no use, since I am still working on it, and when it is finished completely, then I will post, you probably do not have skill at all to build a mech as fast as I did when making this one.
help 2022-06-08 15:57:39 Let alone making a mech like it.
help 2022-06-08 16:01:02 You just need to accept it that you are jealous that I have a mech with digitigrade legs, that can walk, and had more effort into it while still needing to be worked on, and if you say it is bad, just say something else other than "bad, ugly, low effort" or you will prove me right.
help 2022-06-08 16:02:47 Why? Because you called it bad, and I said nothing to you, never asked for you to say anything, and yet here you are, acting like Vykmr.
help 2022-06-08 16:03:43 Then act better then him, be useful.
help 2022-06-08 16:04:24 I have Expert Robotic Specialist.

help 2022-06-08 16:06:27 But you forgot one thing, you have to add more blocks.
help 2022-06-08 16:08:11 Big legs to me = low effort no detail or any parts like a head, or different types of legs.
help 2022-06-08 16:09:35 This is digitigrade legs, they help make my mech fly, jump.
help 2022-06-08 16:10:27 Relevant to what we are talking about?

creations-chat 2022-06-26 06:08:52 Ok, since no one knew what the mech was supposed to be, from the unique shape, or design, the character/mech I am making is General Franky, the Iron Pirate of the Straw Hats, from One Piece.

The mech is SUUUPER.

creations-chat 2022-06-30 20:51:41 Man it sucks that you have no skill to recreate a character or vehicle so you talk trash about others to drag them down, what a waste of my time to even type this out.
You cannot make a paragraph always sound like a joke, and using the troll face does not help either since a lot of other toxic people uses it too.
creations-chat 2022-06-30 20:56:19 " man it sucks that you do not have skill because you suck yes  and you are shit at thsi game "  Are you blind? The reason I said "Man it sucks that you have no skill to recreate a character or vehicle so you talk trash about others to drag them down" is because there are so many toxic, hate everything players in this server, who uses troll face, and cannot say something else other than bad, ass, crap, trash.
creations-chat 2022-06-30 21:00:29 Did you not see what I said? Why I took what btd_bad10TrainsAcc said seriously? There are too many players who say, the standards for builds have gone down, or when someone posts a new build, another would hop over to see and instantly say its bad, so in that case I took it seriously since he could have been one of them, using the troll face, and saying nothing else but trash.
creations-chat 2022-06-30 21:05:41 Bruh.

bug-reports 2022-08-02 07:54:04 THIS CHANGE TO HOW HELIUM BLOCKS WORK IS A PAIN!!!

help 2022-08-02 08:37:02 Because those who built mechs and other vehicles using helium blocks have to go through fixing their builds that were already perfect, and the devs made a dumb choice for changing the system, when they can add a new setting for helium blocks to make it easier for me and those who are having the same problem.
bug-reports 2022-08-02 16:33:33 Omg, are you gonna fix it?

bug-reports 2022-08-02 16:53:46 Nope.
bug-reports 2022-08-03 08:39:49 Its not just ballast blocks, I think its an overall glitch that happens to a bunch of blocks, like wings, helium and ballast.
bug-reports 2022-08-03 08:41:43 Also if Rickje139 cannot fix this glitch, its better to assume he could try and release PC2 and ask that we all just be mindful and understanding of the situation.

bug-reports 2022-08-13 17:40:43 So I was walking around in my mech, and sometimes the legs do not want to lift up, even though there are rockets trying to lift it up, I think it most be the ballast blocks, or it could be the fabric material, and the way fabric reacts to the environment, like the fabric blocks are rubbing against the air, or each other, that and also maybe the something is happening between both the fabric material and ballast blocks.

bug-reports 2022-08-13 20:48:18 And I was building a new vehicle, can you not understand?
bug-reports 2022-08-13 20:53:54 Its either I do one or the other, looking up a site to use it, or building a new vehicle, one or the other, and both can take time anyway since I would have to keep walking in my mech, just to see the legs acting up, all while recording it, just so I can make the video fit so I can upload, just to only be blocked by the bot for uploading a vid that PCC server does not support, or I just spend less time overall building something that is worth more time to work on since its so complicated.
bug-reports 2022-08-13 20:55:41 Spending less time on a build that is worth more time, meaning, I could be done with it faster than me getting a video, and editing it.
bug-reports 2022-08-13 20:57:23 Calling me a nerd, wow, so much simpler than I am.
bug-reports 2022-08-13 21:02:24 At least I am less miserable than you, and I have glaucoma, my eyes are slowing losing peripheral vision, and I am still having more fun with the short amount of time I've got, I came here to tell someone what is happening short and simple, and that someone is a helper/dev and you do not seem like a dev to me.
bug-reports 2022-08-13 21:03:52 Shredders are not bugs, they are builds that are annoying.
bug-reports 2022-08-13 21:05:37 At least you can see the world, while I am gonna soon be completely blind, meaning I will never get to finish my stuff I will have then, I have it worse, because I can see now, but going blind will ruin everything for me.
bug-reports 2022-08-13 21:07:27 Me not having to do something that I did not ask for directions to, and how I just said what I experienced about my mech being short and simple, seeing if someone else has the same problem.
bug-reports 2022-08-13 21:09:02 Seems like a lot of people will be doing that, since I am not used to having to rely on someone else for walking, or some stick I have to wave around in front of me for the rest of my life.
general 2022-08-20 23:30:04 Dude has anyone seen this video, its an engine simulation, the simulation produces highly realistic engine sounds, the only thing is if you want it to sound like any car, you change the engines layout, here is the video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKT-sKtR970
general 2022-08-20 23:30:46 Like its freaking uncanny to how amazing it is!
general 2022-08-20 23:31:44 One day, if possible, we need an engine block, and use the same technique to simulate engine sounds.
creations-chat 2022-08-21 02:59:10 I just tested out a way to steer my car, and this is how I made it look like IRL steering, almost, instead of turning the wheel from the end of the suspension closest to the inside of the frame, we put the steering motors over the wheels.
creations-chat 2022-08-21 03:01:55 If anyone knows a way to fix the steering while keeping the way it does, that would be nice, though it would be really complicated to make.
creations-chat 2022-08-21 03:03:59 When you make a car, the engine is usually above or behind the steering mechanism.
general 2022-08-21 17:31:15 How come Innovation INC Discord server is harder to get into?
general 2022-08-21 17:32:17 Dude, I had done everything I can to get in, and I did not get the roles I need to access the other channels.
general 2022-08-21 17:32:44 There is not skill in getting into a server.
general 2022-08-21 17:33:12 Its a simple process that was just made more complicated for that server.
general 2022-08-21 21:30:49 So you have chosen, Death.
general 2022-08-21 21:31:46 In this server, they just do not want to be pinged.
general 2022-08-21 21:32:30 Yup, and its a big problem.
general 2022-08-21 21:33:14 He gets a day off of being pinged lol.
general 2022-08-21 21:34:36 Yes, and also since they are busy working on the server or on something else, its kind of not worth it.

general 2022-08-29 03:00:57 
general 2022-08-29 03:02:47 Nope, they do not have that, you have to use inspect element, because they did not plan for that, and was patched but then was allowed again, though sadly no official/easy way of doing it.
general 2022-08-29 03:03:11 Shut up.
general 2022-08-29 03:03:57 A lot of people are using it, since there are tutorials of how you can do it.
general 2022-08-29 03:04:23 You are really not funny, get some help.
general 2022-08-29 03:05:05 No, I just do not like unfunny people.
general 2022-08-29 03:06:47 Oh I know I am not funny, and I do not like myself either, I live just to wait to go completely blind.
general 2022-08-29 03:07:40 I type like that because that is how I was raised, do not question it.
general 2022-08-29 03:08:21 Maybe I should question why you have your entire profile like that hmmmm?
general 2022-08-29 03:08:52 Still unfunny.
general 2022-08-29 03:10:32 Maybe the reason you act like this it to get my attention, which I am not gonna do past this point, so if you feel like you are being ignored, maybe do what you keep saying, cope, cry about it and so on.

creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:27:43 Can you really back that up, when <@883063424614006878> was doing their best building a jet, whitenames really need to get expert roles and colored names.
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:30:13 Whitename says wha-???

<@883063424614006878>, understandable, since you were probably busy with something else?

<@876288263386714163>, yep.
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:32:41 Not that, its that a lot of whitenames without expert roles, or no roles at all, keep coming in, and just says the dumbest things ever about decent builds, without a shred of proof of their own skills being shown.
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:34:43 Most of the time, since we spend more than a day or so making builds.
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:36:52 Use your brain, and think about about what you just said, I did not mean days in a row, I meant builds having days spent on it, and other days off game.
Plus I spend more than 6hrs helping my dad build his dream cabin in the woods.
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:39:53 Oh yeah it does, time is like something of a currency you spent on something new, and sometimes had to go through rigorous testing on something that can at best be complicated.
Sure its a game, but it still took time to make.
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:41:56 For not having any reason for making some stupid remarks of a persons build, decent ones at that.
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:44:12 I ask of all whitenames to at least have an understanding of an artists perspective of a creation.
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:46:18 Pretty darn realistic, keep up the good work man.
Can you add a custom livery?
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:48:49 That is if you want so many other players hating your builds you receive a creations blacklist because you do not realize you have made your impression as a rude builder here, and once you have a bunch of Expert roles, and post some of your creations in the server, you will have the same problem as I and so many other do, well that is it for now, Ima hop off.
creations-chat 2022-09-13 06:17:50 For real, I use proper grammar, because that is how I want to be, and how I was taught, it is like questioning the way you look with some disease that deforms the face.

general 2023-06-30 23:40:14 Before, it used to be taken off when you spawn in your build, but now it doesn't and it also duplicates itself on your character and if you try flying up your would slowly move upwards, take it off too many times, and you would just die.

general 2023-07-07 02:32:01 Just when you think you have fixed a bug in a game, you have more bugs, game breaking or benign.
general 2023-07-07 05:26:58 I guess Rickje139 struck the iron when it was hot, and got a new update out.
general 2023-07-07 05:41:05 My move build tool is broken!
general 2023-07-07 05:42:42 # what is going on in this chat?
general 2023-07-07 05:47:16 The mass orb/move tool is broken, it doesn't detect the blocks, or at least the 1x7 and 1x4.
general 2023-07-07 05:47:57 Rick should just have a team of bug hunters find them and report them.
general 2023-07-07 05:48:42 Lazyness, pure lazyness.
general 2023-07-07 05:49:26 Originally jetpack.

general 2023-07-07 05:55:06 Non, please fix the game.
general 2023-07-07 05:55:25 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/975477847869239306/1015850281604481096/tenor_1.gif?width=864&height=480
general 2023-07-08 01:10:56 So, I guess this server is making a full circle, the game got fixed, and now the chaos from back then came back.
general 2023-07-09 04:31:41 I wish this was the Motor Hat, I would have bought it the second I saw it, but I already have the hat.
general 2023-07-15 09:12:44 I have a challenge for you Plane Crazy, make a trebuchet and launch yourself to the floating island.
Rules:
Does not have to be historically accurate.
Must stay in your plot.
You can aim the trebuchet.
Your pilot seat is the projectile.
No rockets on the pilot seat.
No wings on the pilot seat.
No glitches.
No low effort trebuchets.
If this challenge goes official, I would love that.
general 2023-07-15 09:13:27 It is possible.
general 2023-07-15 09:14:33 I didn't say you cannot use rockets to swing the arm.
general 2023-07-15 09:15:18 
general 2023-07-15 09:15:53 I aimed and then launched, it is possible.
general 2023-07-16 02:34:54 Focusing, exactly as you do.
general 2023-07-16 02:37:45 Nah this server has those who think that motorlocking and folding is so easy.
https://tenor.com/view/crazy-plane-roblox-gif-26076979
general 2023-07-16 02:38:34 Not simple motorlocking, and folding.
general 2023-07-16 02:40:08 # Plane crazy? I was plane crazy once. They locked me in a server. A public server. A public server filled with shredders. And shredders make me go plane crazy.
general 2023-07-16 09:03:01 In light of the challenge I have made, I want to ask, is anyone else wanting to take part?
general 2023-07-16 09:03:51 Have you read the message?
general 2023-07-16 09:04:18 I said it has to be a trebuchet.
general 2023-07-16 09:05:26 No rockets or wings.
general 2023-07-16 09:07:21 Here is proof I have made it onto the floating island, though with low effort trebuchet, I only wanted to prove it is possible.
general 2023-07-16 09:08:46 Ha!
You only get A+++.
Nah, you gotta crank that up, and get a A+++++++.
general 2023-07-16 09:09:51 I forgot a few plus's.
general 2023-07-16 09:10:12 How many you ask?
general 2023-07-16 09:10:16 Hmmmmm.

general 2023-07-19 05:10:01 Bruh, gravity is broken right now.
general 2023-07-19 05:10:50 I swear, him working on the game has not been so good lately.
general 2023-07-19 05:12:10 Like just get more devs, find more devs who aren't burnt out from developing the game.
general 2023-07-19 08:04:48 Don't you guys like it when you see someone cheating in a competitive game get caught, and they start talking out their ass, calling someone scared, when they have a fragile ego, and they are scared of being beaten in a game?
general 2023-07-19 08:05:29 Wrong, but ok, I saw that happen in Rust.
general 2023-07-19 08:06:09 I don't cheat, but I like to see idiots who do get banned.
general 2023-07-19 08:06:31 I play Rust.
general 2023-07-19 08:06:59 That is so true.
general 2023-07-19 08:07:39 Funny enough, you are wrong, just shows how over reactive you are, since I am not over weight.
general 2023-07-19 08:09:16 Also, why are you over here assuming I am crying about something I was not involved but observing?
general 2023-07-19 08:09:49 Do you really expect I will just lash out at you?
general 2023-07-19 08:10:41 Do you think that by assuming something I am not, will make me just leave?
I know what you were trying to do.
general 2023-07-19 08:12:11 Nah, you are denying it, since I just pointed out what you said was wrong, and then you kept on saying I am something else.
general 2023-07-19 08:13:43 And your Ego makes you think that all Anime fans are all the same, bro I can tell you without a doubt that, no 2 people are the same.
Neither both of us which proves my point.
general 2023-07-19 08:15:06 This guy is out here trying to start an argument with everyone, just gonna I am not going to respond after this.
general 2023-07-19 08:16:27 I only check off one of those, I have a disability.
I am not gay.
I watch anime, I don't have anything but Pfp's and some figurines and that is all.
general 2023-07-19 08:17:26 When did I say I don't have a disability.
general 2023-07-19 08:18:06 If I didn't say I don't have a disability, then I do have one.
general 2023-07-19 08:18:54 Not to you.
general 2023-07-19 08:20:40 Also, as much as you don't like anime and you make fun of people who watch it, I can say confidently that all cars running on gas is bad, and that I should just laugh at you for being a clown and defending something that made the Earth lose more than half its O-zone layer.
general 2023-07-19 08:21:59 I do, but at the same time I also recognise that most electric vehicles and equipment cannot do as good as gas.
general 2023-07-19 08:23:10 And I knew it, you wanted to start and argument from the beginning.
general 2023-07-19 08:23:48 That is you right now, trying to tell me that anime fans are bad.
general 2023-07-19 08:24:13 My Eyes are to blame.
general 2023-07-19 08:26:49 Funny how I say this, and some egotistical person comes along and assumes the wrong things, without thinking for once, there are so many different types of people out there, and he chooses the ones that are much worse than I am.
general 2023-07-19 08:27:15 And you are on the wrong side.
general 2023-07-19 08:28:31 Take one good look at that reply and see the message I sent, and then you go down, and see how this person just lashes out starting an argument, and not asking questions, and instead stating things about me that are wrong.
general 2023-07-19 08:29:36 No, you just want to start an argument, next thing I am gonna learn about you, is that you are homophobic, and you hate LGBT.
general 2023-07-19 08:30:04 I know that too well.
general 2023-07-19 08:30:25 Who or what the hell is that?
general 2023-07-19 08:31:42 Ah yes, I go around and start calling people builds crap, and after someone states that they need to do something in a whole other conversation, then I would say "idgaf" or "who asked" or "who cares".
general 2023-07-19 08:32:18 What, me saying something smart stunned you?
general 2023-07-19 08:33:57 I do, I don't care what they think, I watch whatever I want, and oh yeah guess what, at least I am not saying that whatever they watch is bad.
general 2023-07-19 08:34:26 Yeah, everyone does, but I don't care/
general 2023-07-19 08:34:46 It would take an entire tragedy to make me sad.
general 2023-07-19 08:35:00 Nice try clown.
general 2023-07-19 08:35:36 Basic joke of the book, or is it just you reflecting what you went through to others?
general 2023-07-19 08:36:21 Dude, I am not, when was I projecting?
general 2023-07-19 08:36:50 Before you came in?
general 2023-07-19 08:37:01 Nope.
general 2023-07-19 08:37:29 I like the number 8.
general 2023-07-19 08:38:05 I can handle being in this server too, I just don't like taking rude comments and staying dormant.
general 2023-07-19 08:39:11 And that is how I build up my resistance to them.
general 2023-07-19 08:40:18 Its kind weird, I do, but I don't at the same time.
general 2023-07-19 08:40:56 If you cannot beat em join em, seriously dude?
general 2023-07-19 08:41:39 And how do you do such a thing huh?
general 2023-07-19 08:42:00 I already left once.
general 2023-07-19 08:42:40 I blocked a lot of people here.
general 2023-07-19 08:43:09 What?
general 2023-07-19 08:43:37 If I were to greet someone, I would say "I'm" not "I".
general 2023-07-19 08:45:53 I had some few once message me in DMs and being all "friendly" while still being toxic.
I had to block them but I didn't want to since I just could not care much.{I did block them]
general 2023-07-19 08:47:37 Trust me, all of us are fools.
general 2023-07-19 08:49:02 I admit that I am a fool for arguing over a game and a few personal choices, but at least I am stand my ground.
general 2023-07-19 08:49:23 Everyone does.
general 2023-07-19 08:53:06 If I am destroying myself, then why is it from when I start talking about something funny, and then someone comes along and starts and argument.
<@920117944736940064>
general 2023-07-19 08:54:04 Look at the message I am replying to first.
general 2023-07-19 08:54:29 On Discord.
general 2023-07-19 08:54:44 A few hand movements and boom.
general 2023-07-19 08:56:10 Bruh, that is what everyone probably said about you when you had to leave.
general 2023-07-19 08:56:28 You are just like that other guy who also was assuming something about me.
general 2023-07-19 08:58:11 If I am a weeb to you, oh well, at least I don't go around saying that whatever you watch, and I quote from what I said before, I don't try to stop you from watching whatever you want to, nor do I care.
general 2023-07-19 09:01:45 Projecting your self is a bad thing, too.
I don't assume anything of you, and if I did before, they were used as examples, to other people, and the fact that you have the goal to prove yourself better than someone else, even though you are not, you have your own skills, I have my own, and you disproving such, is an evil, rude thing to do, I don't see myself tearing down your personal likes and dislikes.
general 2023-07-19 09:02:32 Brain dead then.
