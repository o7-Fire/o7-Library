bug-reports 2023-04-19 22:46:40 if you get 2 cameras and point them at each other (it should say blockstd) it makes them connected, additionally, after experimenting with cameras I noticed the reselect option is really buggy causing items to vanish occasionally.

general 2023-04-21 02:00:08 You’re and asshole go screw yourself
general 2023-04-21 02:00:33 “Ashoel”
general 2023-04-21 02:01:17 You are*
general 2023-04-21 02:02:19 Bros resorted to stalking my page to pull out a rookie insult
general 2023-04-21 02:05:43 Anybody is cool until they aren’t
general 2023-04-21 02:10:08 Better than taking a boat though
general 2023-04-21 02:10:34 It’s so much cheaper and more convenient
general 2023-04-21 02:10:55 Plane
general 2023-04-21 02:10:59 It’s also safer to fly
general 2023-04-21 02:11:38 I fact checked it
general 2023-04-21 02:12:28 It’s not fun, takes days, and usually 10 times more expensive
general 2023-04-21 02:12:40 Prove me wrong
general 2023-04-21 02:13:01 It takes way too long and a hotel is better quality and cheaper
general 2023-04-21 02:13:27 Oh and your going to be looking I put the window 24/7
general 2023-04-21 02:13:47 Picture this
general 2023-04-21 02:15:28 Okay but you probably didn’t pay for all of it right?
general 2023-04-21 02:18:29 If you were trying to visit your grandparents in Russia let’s say, are you really going to prefer taking a 4 day or longer cruise that costs over $1000 and then proceed to drive in an Uber or taxi for 200ish miles for probably an additional $400, if your lucky enough to find a cruise near your destination
general 2023-04-21 02:22:00 that can be transatlantic travel depending on where you are
general 2023-04-21 02:24:15 yes
general 2023-04-21 02:24:30 russia is in europe (or asia) and you can get their from crossing the atlantic
general 2023-04-21 02:25:01 for example new york to russia is transatlantic
general 2023-04-21 02:25:09 you literally can't say nuh uh it's a proven fact
general 2023-04-21 02:25:56 yeah but cruise isn't for travelling it's for "fun"
general 2023-04-21 02:26:15 mostly for people willing to cough up a ton of money
general 2023-04-21 02:28:01 stop saying nuh uh it does not make you look cool
general 2023-04-21 02:28:09 bro ferries are literally for crossing rivers
general 2023-04-21 02:28:29 Just drive around god dammit
general 2023-04-21 02:29:03 I am not paying the $50 fee and parking tickets for some slow boat to take me to the other side of the lake when I could just drive around it.
general 2023-04-21 02:29:44 like you said you don't have a job and don't pay for it so you would not know
general 2023-04-21 02:29:50 yes it sucks
general 2023-04-21 02:30:11 stop the fricking lying 15 minutes ago you said you were not old enough
general 2023-04-21 02:31:32 you're immature for sure tho
general 2023-04-21 02:31:44 But tbh I can relate to that in some ways
general 2023-04-21 02:34:00 I'm done arguing with you <@740790456182636595>, I have already stated that (in my opinion) boats are obsolete ways of transportation and only travelled on for fun or to get your car across a river.
