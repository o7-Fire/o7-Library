general 2021-01-29 09:52:15 I tried making a Graf Spee
general 2021-01-29 09:52:24 although I made an old one last year
general 2021-01-29 09:52:49 Tennessee?
general 2021-01-29 09:53:05 That's nice
general 2021-01-29 09:53:14 But my ships are a bit smaller and has motorlocks
general 2021-01-29 09:53:21 Like my Scharnhorst
general 2021-01-29 09:53:31 Until I reach Level 3 to post images of it

general 2021-01-29 09:54:15 Ah
general 2021-01-29 09:54:24 So some of my battleships have motorlocked turrets
general 2021-01-29 09:54:48 I go for the much more complex designs...

general 2021-01-29 09:56:53 I saw an M36 Jackson in Korea
general 2021-01-29 09:56:59 The Jackson is like a Wolverine
general 2021-01-29 09:57:07 But Wolverine is much more different
general 2021-01-29 09:57:18 It was my first time seeing a WWII tank in my life
general 2021-01-29 09:57:23 It is a sight to behold
general 2021-01-29 09:57:42 Looks like it's made of Lego Pieces, though
general 2021-01-29 09:58:18 Its not a Hellcat
general 2021-01-29 09:58:21 Its a Wolverine
general 2021-01-29 09:58:39 M10 Wolverine
general 2021-01-29 09:59:19 Ah yes the master of motorlocks
general 2021-01-29 10:00:02 Then what was your first build using Motorlocks
general 2021-01-29 10:00:38 I stopped making Jets, and resorted to Baytleships
general 2021-01-29 10:00:50 Same here, at a Military Camp for a School Event
general 2021-01-29 10:01:06 I saw a P-51 Mustang in Korea when I went there last year

general 2021-01-29 10:04:56 it is deployed by glider
general 2021-01-29 10:05:02 based on my knowledge
general 2021-01-29 10:05:11 How about the Tetrarch
general 2021-01-29 10:05:18 It has a same purpose as Locust
general 2021-01-29 10:06:18 Sir, the 17 Pounder won' fit!

creations-chat 2021-02-05 03:52:49 What do you think of my WIP Andrea Doria? Do I need any changes? DO I need to add something?
(I usually paint my creations gray so I can further see the blocks clearly, or maybe it's my style of building to simulate metal or primer to the ship)
creations-chat 2021-02-05 05:08:25 I'll be doing that later
creations-chat 2021-02-06 05:56:25 Andrea Doria is almost Complete... Any comments?
creations-chat 2021-02-06 07:21:22 Yes, and I'll add it soon. More details will be added first before the coloring

creations-chat 2021-02-09 08:44:18 I've stopped working on Andrea Doria for a while, but she's 95% complete with the paint job and all. I'll be building a Sloop of War for the Contest. Is there any suggestions on this build which I can improve or add?
creations-chat 2021-02-09 08:46:29 yes
creations-chat 2021-02-09 08:50:41 Let's say its custom-made...
creations-chat 2021-02-09 08:53:51 okay. I'm in the process of shortening the vessel. I'll take your word.
creations-chat 2021-02-09 08:59:07 I see.
creations-chat 2021-02-09 09:04:58 ah, I see. To give a little update, I've already shortened the vessel, and now its starting to appropriately look like a Sloop of War.
creations-chat 2021-02-09 09:23:09 Update:
The Vessel is now shorter to appropriately have the appearance of a Sloop of War
creations-chat 2021-02-09 12:09:20 UPDATE:
My Sloop of War now has a name: HMS Black Rose.
It now has masts, but the yards and sails will have to be added. Also the remaining details of my ship will be aded on the following day. Shall I add rigging? Are there any suggestions? If so, add them below.
creations-chat 2021-02-09 13:48:12 Update on my Sloop of War, HMS Black Rose
The Ship now has a stern lifeboat. Rigging and sails will be added. The rest of the ship will be finished tomorrow.
creations-chat 2021-02-10 02:49:45 She's 60% complete... Any comments?
creations-chat 2021-02-10 03:06:52 Ok.
The sails are gonna be added...
creations-chat 2021-02-10 03:11:27 Not yet... I gotta be as thin as possible.
creations-chat 2021-02-10 03:18:45 Shall I change the shape of the sails?
creations-chat 2021-02-10 03:20:51 I'll color the ship and the sails once the entire build is finished. I treat them like those Model Kits that I like to assemble and paint.
creations-chat 2021-02-10 05:20:26 Ohh yeah... HMS Black Rose is coming together... Shall I add more sails and rigging?
creations-chat 2021-02-10 05:25:55 thanks
creations-chat 2021-02-10 08:23:39 This is a huge problem... My sailing ship keeps tipping to the left or right whenever I spawn and fold it on water... are there any ways I can fix this?
creations-chat 2021-02-10 08:25:40 okay
creations-chat 2021-02-10 08:38:05 Problem solved... I used <@!660019099430289418> 's advice...

creations-chat 2021-02-17 12:33:06 It's a little too stretched for a 170V, but least you tried...
creations-chat 2021-02-18 07:39:42 Attempted to recreate HMS Belfast's turret. Also, it's another WIP... and I dunno if I should finish Andrea Doria or not...
creations-chat 2021-02-18 09:25:54 Aye
creations-chat 2021-02-27 04:49:44 Skill and Experience...
creations-chat 2021-02-27 13:04:00 Attempted to reconstruct Z-23's Forward turret. I'll be planning on making the entire destroyer, but due to limitations on some parts, the barrels of the guns looked ugly. I'll manage those limitations on the final build of the Warship.

   Inside the turrets are Rocket Launchers to portray the shells of the Destroyer. I will also use rockets to portray the ship's torpedoes. But limitations should be met on the final build of the German Destroyer.

   If there are any comments on the creation, you can put them down to further improve the appearance of the ship's turret.

creations-chat 2021-03-07 16:32:50 <@!773287769488752653> Actually the BV-38 is a *Fictional Design* for *Raiders of the Lost Ark*. Also, BV stands for **Blohm und Voss**, an aircraft/ship company. No evidence of the BV-38's blueprints exist. Only made up from the idea of one Steven Spielberg.

Still it's a nice build, but you better research the plane of there are any actual blueprints made by Blohm und Voss.
creations-chat 2021-03-08 00:18:59 Should have noticed that...
creations-chat 2021-03-18 12:54:08 Work in Progress on an Austro-Hungarian Dreadnought. It's the*** SMS Szent Istvan***. I'll even try to recreate the image of the ship sinking once completed.

I used a 3d model of her sister ship, *Viribus Unitis* from *Sketchfab* as the reference. Taking a break from WWII and Early cold war era ships... It's time for Dreadnoughts.
creations-chat 2021-03-18 12:58:29 thanks for the feedback.
creations-chat 2021-03-20 05:22:37 My Szent Istvan is 90% complete! Now I need to add the colors and the ship's rigging...

creations-chat 2021-03-27 02:20:15 A WIP on *Scharnhorst*. It;s basically a *remake *of my old one which looked TERRIBLE in my opinion bc of the hull structure. I might get the title of Shipwright if I finish this vessel. If there are any comments that will help improve this ship, put 'em down so I can improve the vessel.

creations-chat 2021-04-02 08:19:16 A Work in Progress on a Folding rifle I'm currently making. It's an ***M1 Carbine*** with a ***Folding Stock *** used for Paratroopers.
creations-chat 2021-04-02 08:24:49 Here's the reference of my next project
creations-chat 2021-04-20 13:36:22 Hey guys! I haven't been active in a long while due to my College classes and heavy amounts of boredom. 

I'll just leave this WIP of my latest project, the ***USS Wichita***. 

I have completed the ship's bow section, and now I'll have to finish the mid and stern section of the one of a kind American Cruiser which became the basis for the *Baltimore*. If you have any comments about this bow build, you may put them down. The ship will be colored once the entire structure has been finished. I wanted to treat my build style as if I'm building a Plastic Model. 

If you're asking about that Wichita Model I use for reference, its from Sketchfab.Com. There are World of Warships models if you wanna use 'em for reference.
creations-chat 2021-04-20 14:10:07 Secrets...
creations-chat 2021-04-21 10:26:21 The Mid section of ***USS Wichita*** is almost complete. The bridge and the funnels are almost complete. What is missing are the rangefinders and radar systems above the bridge.
creations-chat 2021-04-28 01:36:07 Lets say its like a gigantic "Chain" of some sort....
creations-chat 2021-04-28 04:13:01 My next train project ever since the 20th Century Limited. This time its the legendary **Henschel-Wegmann Zug** of the *Deutsche Reichsbahn Gesselschaft*. Right now, I am finishing up the touches of the lead locomotive, and then work for the passenger coaches will start afterwards. 

The Locomotive presented before you is the *DRG Class 61 001*. I tried my best into replicating the locomotive in player scale form. 

If there are any comments you wanted to give out so I can make changes on the Train, drop them down if you want to.
creations-chat 2021-05-16 03:18:48 Any thoughts of my **VK 100.01 Mammut**? 

I tried mimicking the color schemes of some tanks that were rushed out of the factory in 1945 like this E-100 that you see on the right. I tried matching the colors on the tank's turret and suspension bars. Any suggestions to further match the colors?
general 2021-05-19 14:34:03 Nostalgia eh?
general 2021-05-19 14:34:10 Time for 80's...
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:19:02 Yes, My Gepard really is inaccurate bc of some limitations.
general 2021-07-23 12:38:38 Why not Schwerer Gustav?
general 2021-07-23 12:39:38 Schwerer Gustav can make a good coastal artillery
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:41:13 Is it supposed to be a **Panther** or a **Königstiger**, or a mashup of both?
general 2021-07-23 12:42:08 Indeed.
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:43:24 Nice attempt, anyway. You can do better. It nearly reminded me of the King Tiger because of that camo.
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:45:50 Yeah, hehe. And the positioning of the wheels also made me remind of the King Tiger too.

creations-chat 2021-07-27 15:52:46 Oh poop. Just realized that the T-72 was *never used* in the *Soviet-Afghan War*... 
but I just wanna put it in to reference **Metal Gear Solid V** and their fictional TT77 Tank
creations-chat 2021-07-27 15:56:16 Oh bugger me... but I decided to add it in as a reference to **Metal Gear Solid V**, since it takes place in Afghanistan in 1984, and had tanks resembling a T-72 (TT77 Nosorog).
creations-chat 2021-07-27 16:41:19 Agreed. Only the **US Navy** operated the Skyhawk. Not in both branches at the same time.
creations-chat 2021-07-27 16:48:29 Oh, okay.
But it resembled the Navy Livery

general 2021-07-27 23:33:23 **Top 10 Weapons Banned for War**
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 00:10:17 I see.
general 2021-07-28 00:15:12 You have a Hole in your right wing!
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:22:43 Tested it in PVP mode
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:31:28 The Survivability Rate is calculated with how many minutes this thing has survived. 

30 Seconds - 10% 
1 Minute - 15%
1.5 Minutes - 20%
2 Minutes - 25% 
2.5 Minutes - 30% 
3 Minutes - 35% 
3.5 Minutes - 40% 
4 Minutes - 45% 
4.5 Minutes - 50%
5 Minutes - 55%
5.5 Minutes - 60%
6 Minutes - 65% 
6.5 Minutes - 70%
7 Minutes - 75% 
7.5 Minutes - 80%
8 Minutes - 85%
8.5 Minutes - 90%
9 Minutes - 95%
9.5 + Minutes - 100%

Reason why my T-72 is at 40% is because there's Shredder Bugs, Rockets, Aircraft, and stupidly OP creations, making the vehicle almost impossible to survive.
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:33:31 If I were to build Aircraft, then the survivability rate increases.
If Ships, then its as low as tanks or ground vehicles bc of Shredders, planes, and OP builds.
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:36:14 Hmm... maybe I should use that as a new form of calculation. Or maybe add a "Kill Rate" on my creation. or at least try an damage any enemy vehicle in PVP Mode.
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:39:19 Hmm... I'll be damned... Maybe I'll put TNT Armor on my Warships to accurately portray how strong they were. After all, Deck Armor is weak. The Belt Armor and Turret Armor will be invincible. Also the Bridge and Conning Tower as well...

With that, I can survive any Naval Battle in PVP mode.
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:41:25 Yeah, like irl. But WWI Dreadnoughts have "Torpedo Nets" to prevent them from hitting the ship.
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:46:22 Okay. But I wanna accurately portray Ship's Speed. And the whole Armor Thing can be managed.
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:48:45 Yeah Indeed. Manually Detonated and Controlled Torps (if those things are possible to build) are a big problem in Naval Warfare. Especially **Dive Bombing tactics** and **Kamikaze Attacks**. And if possible, if the enemy ship has a **Battering Ram**, then I'll prepare for the worst.
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:51:45 But AA Defenses are required for a Warship. Especially **American Vessels**, since they are **LOADED** of them. 
I'm more of a **European Warship builder**, and they have less AA so thats a big problem when it comes to aircraft like that.
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:54:58 Problem is that there are only 10x Guns in the game. I'll have to use everything wisely in the most convenient way possible. Also, there's a limitation of armament in the game. And most ships of WWII follow the **Naval Treaties of Washington and London**, which restricts the gross tonnage and armaments on any warship to be designed. Also, it is even cost effective.
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:57:54 The **Admiral Graf Spee** of Germany is what I will build. Yes it will have Working AA Guns, and yes it will have TNT belt armor. Also, my third Graf Spee to ever be built.
general 2021-07-28 01:58:31 I misread that as **Garlic** phone

plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:24:20 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:27:03 Least I made a V1 Flying Bomb
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 15:48:26 SEPECAT Jaguar? Panavia Tornado?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 15:51:31 Ah, I see
creations-chat 2021-08-10 10:24:42 Overpowered, it will be. Be careful of Shredder Bugs, you must.
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 10:26:41 KSI, who is he!
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 10:26:50 Never heard of him
creations-chat 2021-08-10 10:26:55 Indeed it will. Reinforcements, you must need. Impossible to acquire, it is. Since most are... uncertain, or remain independent.
creations-chat 2021-08-10 13:29:46 Love your wip on your King Tiger. Can't wait to see the finished product!
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:40:43 That would be impossible
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:44:46 Yes, since at that point you might run out of blocks or limited space
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:45:22 
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:45:23 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:45:35 Problem is u cannot fit any parasite fighters
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:46:12 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:46:35 Or maybe ask ur friends (if u have) to copy and build your sample of the parasite fighters.
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:46:46 Exact dimensions, exact scheme, exact color
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:47:37 damn...
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:47:38 Ouch
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:48:09 I mean, America made Airships that carry Fighter Planes in the 1930's...
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:48:13 That would be deemed too IMPOSSIBLE to achieve
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:48:21 Since ur plot size is smol
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:48:26 Or make tiny planes
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:49:14 Yeah,
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:49:20 So we can make BIGGER builds
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:50:40 Maybe...
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:51:59 Add more islands, make bigger oceans for naval scenes, and build a "City" for city themed creations. And also... MOAR EASTER EGGS
plane-crazy 2021-08-11 01:54:13 Yeah, at least build a castle as an easter egg or for medieval themed builds
general 2021-08-11 02:41:02 Rick is here

creations-chat 2021-08-11 09:18:01 Update on my AAT. I tried making it hover like in Ep 1 and The Clone Wars, but keeps on tipping over due to the complex designs of the machine itself.
creations-chat 2021-08-11 09:24:02 ok I think I made up a solution but thanks for the advice
creations-chat 2021-08-11 09:30:11 she almost done

creations-chat 2021-08-11 10:55:27 Add Diamond Plate texture to the tracks to make it more unique, as if to capture the texture of the tracks.

creations-chat 2021-09-02 12:05:18 If I was him, I'd have the engines stick the the fuselage with Cameras so thatit wouldnt be noticeable.
creations-chat 2021-09-02 12:31:15 I suggest you to set the text size to 1 to hide the "Configure to Edit" on the sides of your plane. Or simply just add a "-" to make it completely "invisible". I did that to some of my creations.
creations-chat 2021-09-02 12:34:34 I don't see any SAAB Drakens with that paint scheme. Is it Custom? If yes, continue it.

creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:07:06 BruH THAT IS Slave 1. And also, HE MURDERED IT like how Disney renamed the Slave 1.
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:14:19 Too far to look like an Abrams... 
and the name of your so-called "A Land Vehicle" is THE TUMBLER from the Batman movies.
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:16:24 "Offending?" OFFENDING!? BRUH!
The Slave 1 is the REAL NAME of Boba Fett's Spaceship. You're just an SJW like those fuckers at Disney who murdered Star Wars. Also. Slavery is a theme in Star Wars. Anakin Skywalker was a Slave to Watto, and Leia became a Slave to Jabba the Hutt. You sir, are also ruining the true spirit of Star Wars. The ship is named "Slave 1", and will forever will be called that.
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:18:31 BUT THAT IS THE TUMBLER. 
BrUh! Just use the actual name of the vehicle you made.
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:20:54 You should have said "Custom-built Tumbler" instead. 
Since the shape of the vehicle itself resembles the Tumbler.

general 2021-09-10 02:24:01 Why is Roblox censoring names of famous people...
creations-chat 2021-09-10 02:26:13 Well guess the gear would have to be angled vertically in order for it to fit in the cockpit. Compared that to the B-52, which has two legs that fold upward towards it.

Challenger I

Challenger 2 - Iraq War 

Basically Challenger 1 and Challenger 2 fought Saddam in different decades, still going to Challenger 1
creations-chat 2021-09-14 15:13:07 Oh, but did the Challenger 2 make the world's longest tank-on-tank kill? No it didn't. It is credited to the Challenger 1 back in 1991 in Operation Desert Storm. The tank destroyed an unknown Iraqi tank (possibly a T-72) in the range of three miles on 26 February 1991.

creations-chat 2021-09-17 09:16:18 First of all, the Kriegsmarine was renamed into the DEUTSCHE MARINE or BUNDESMARINE in post-WWII Germany. There was also the Nationale Volksmarine in the DDR. since Germany was divided into two countries after WWII, there are two German Navies - the NATIONALE VOLKSMARINE (DDR) and the DEUTSCHE MARINE/BUNDESMARINE (BRD)
creations-chat 2021-09-17 09:20:10 Arleigh Burke Destroyer + German Flag = German Ship
Iowa-Class Battleship + Malaysian Flag = Malaysian Ship
Bismarck-Class Battleship + Indonesian Flag = Indonesian Ship
---
This is why I don't like some players in Plane Crazy, just adding their national flag on the wrong ships/vehicles. This is why Historical Accuracy is needed for the game. At least the Soviet Union received the Nurnberg and renamed it to Admiral Makarov after WWII, and Germany received some M47 Pattons postwar to build up the Bundeswehr.
creations-chat 2021-09-17 09:28:13 Historical Accuracy examples: 
Tanks
T-34 - Poland (Export/Lend Lease), Soviet Union, Germany (Captured)
Leopard 1 - Brazil (Export), West Germany, Italy (Export)
M4 Sherman - USA, Soviet Union (Lend-Lease), United Kingdom (Derivatives)

Warships

plane-crazy 2021-09-18 11:47:48 once the creations channel is reopened, legit everyone will post their creation
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 11:48:10 we need two or three bots
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 11:48:20 Three is recommended
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 11:48:23 or several
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 11:49:00 keep it that way
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 11:49:04 dont remove the slowmode
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 11:49:23 and I recommend that the Slowmode on da creations channel would have to be one day.
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 11:51:42 no. only to avoid the broken bot incident, where people abuse the creations channel by posting unrelated stuff
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 11:51:47 also

general 2021-09-19 01:15:03 Guess so
help 2021-09-19 01:22:06 
creations-chat 2021-09-19 01:25:02 Inferior... compared to this.
creations-chat 2021-09-19 01:40:46 Try hiding it on the ship's waterline. It won't be noticable.
general 2021-09-19 02:20:11 Loogat this dood tryna copy my Tirpitz turret
general 2021-09-19 02:20:29 yeah

general 2021-09-19 02:21:41 Wow
general 2021-09-19 02:22:05 and now he just straight up blacklisted me
general 2021-09-19 02:22:16 this is how dumb some players are
general 2021-09-19 02:22:19 who copy builds
general 2021-09-19 02:24:53 I did
general 2021-09-19 02:24:58 but he keeps building ir
general 2021-09-19 02:25:08 and I even added in anti copy blacklist
general 2021-09-19 02:25:11 he wont see anymore
general 2021-09-19 02:25:18 but still he continues to build it WRONG.
general 2021-09-19 02:26:15 And now he deleted his ripoff turret\
general 2021-09-19 02:26:20 lack of skill
general 2021-09-19 02:31:36 wow what a smart move he made.
general 2021-09-19 02:31:40 he saved his ripoffturret
general 2021-09-19 02:31:44 and then continues it
general 2021-09-19 02:38:46 And then he does the barbette area WRONG.
creations-chat 2021-09-19 02:38:58 I used to, i guess
general 2021-09-19 02:53:34 oh great...
general 2021-09-19 02:53:40 now there are two people copying
general 2021-09-19 02:53:55 nope
general 2021-09-19 02:54:46 aight am out
general 2021-09-19 02:54:56 dream speedrun
general 2021-09-19 02:55:01 fail
general 2021-09-19 02:55:07 am outta here
creations-chat 2021-09-19 07:43:46 This is better.
creations-chat 2021-09-19 07:45:53 then he better look at it as inspiration.
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 07:52:28 lovely
creations-chat 2021-09-19 07:59:13 try enlarging it and add two more seats for passengers, so that it would feel like a Reliant Robin.
creations-chat 2021-09-19 08:21:39 then at one point in time, he'll build this:
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:02:46 Might as well build this drawing I made.
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:02:49 And here's what its based on
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:04:10 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:04:42 And if a tank like that were to be built, it would be a nightmare, and a very hard one to maintain.
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:04:57 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:05:04 Two guns = more weight
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:05:10 Two guns = less armor
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:05:18 One gun = more armor
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:05:44 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:05:47 y e s
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:06:05 Y E S
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:06:40 -3 nearly impossible to kill
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:07:22 What if... 
Tank with no armor, but with hidden MISSILE LAUNCHER
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:07:43 "We're Immobilized!"
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:08:23 Weapon: MANPADS
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:08:30 or RPG-7
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:11:46 They would have turned this into a 2-in-1 tank. A tank that can kill other tanks, and a tank that can kill Aircraft.
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:11:55 The Coelian is one.
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:12:45 It's in Portuguese
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:12:48 Or Brazillian
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:28:43 Could be used for Metal Gear Sahelanthropus or any Chicken Walker.
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:52:09 tiny
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:52:12 tiny tonk
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:52:37 I will build this.
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:52:39 Drawing by me, btw.
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:52:53 Based on this
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:53:22 Nope. That's the GROTTE.
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:53:36 Similar to the Apocalypse Tank from Red Alert 2
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:54:29 That's the Object 279.
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:54:41 But this is a nightmare.
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:54:45 Both to Enemies and the Soviets themselves
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:54:52 Because its expensive to maintain
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:54:59 And could have lots of Faults.
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:55:15 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:55:35 Experimental tank
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:55:40 Blueprints
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:56:02 
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:56:19 I'd picture Faster Firing + More Firepower...
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:56:35 Except the two guns are autoloaders similar to that of the AMX-13
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:56:54 Gonna have 4 Shells in the Magazine each gun
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:57:11 hey weepinhijay
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:57:24 I'm still tryna finalize my fictional tank design
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 14:58:47 Meant for river boats
creations-chat 2021-09-19 15:00:47 Why does this tonk remind me of Mann vs, Machine?
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 15:03:30 Vesally is a War Criminal, and should be sentenced to Life Imprisonment.
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 15:03:47 Flak Cannon superior
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 15:03:54 Flugzeugabwehrkanone
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 15:03:59 Panzerabwehrkanone
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 15:04:21 Oh, ok
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 15:04:26 So not a Custom made
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 15:04:32 Real terrible
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 15:04:40 Imagine if he made a Wyvern torp bomber
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 15:04:59 I'd expect Torpedoes to appear in Plane Crazy II
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 15:05:10 And Cannons
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 15:05:13 aswell
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 15:05:28 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 15:05:31 But I want it smaller
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 15:05:37 Guess sacrifices are made
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 15:06:27 Umm, ok
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 15:12:29 my trash A-10 Warthog I built months or 1 year ago

plane-crazy 2021-09-19 15:16:32 I made a Building, the Reichstag Parliament
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 15:16:36 but got deleted

creations-chat 2021-09-20 13:54:15 maybe try to add some lights to make nighttime shots, and have the ability to puff out smoke
creations-chat 2021-09-21 06:09:48 inaccurate gear
creations-chat 2021-09-21 06:14:07 
creations-chat 2021-09-21 06:16:37 correct landing gear of Bf 109.
creations-chat 2021-09-21 06:19:04 They retract outward, rather than inward. Only the Fw 190, Zero, P-51, and some WWII and early to mid cold war fighters have the Inward landing gear configuration.

plane-crazy 2021-09-22 12:12:58 I'm still in the process of drawing my custom tank
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 12:13:08 it gonna be based on the Tank of Extreme Parameters
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 12:13:58 what if I made this
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 12:14:00 i'll build this
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 12:14:04 but my own design
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 12:14:43 I'll base the entire design from this
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 12:14:48 then slap in two guns
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 12:14:55 and add VVSS type suspension
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 14:59:45 I’ve been drawing plans for my fictitious Cold War Soviet tank.... I’ve done numerous designs with one based on a T-72. And one based on Pike nose soviet tanks
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 15:00:17 My final design would be based on piked nose vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 15:00:30 So that I could have the feeling that it’s from Red Alert 2
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 15:01:33 here. Im tryna have my fictional tank the feeling that its the apocalypse from red alert 2
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 15:01:41 would be impractical to see a tank like this
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 15:01:50 since red alert 2 takes place in the 70's
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:49:53 Did he?

and also, this is what my Jaguar was supposed to look like originally.
creations-chat 2021-09-24 14:06:45 And yes I've tried with the headlights because I wanted to add the "Glass" part of it. Also, since the Pontoons cannot be textured into glass, this was a limitation to my Jaguar.

plane-crazy 2021-09-25 07:09:15 I made a concept map for Plane Crazy 2.
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 07:09:17 It's quite big, and it will feature few new places. Also, Boss Battles in PVP mode, and more easter eggs
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 07:09:54 I know, but this is the main map
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 07:09:59 The other islands will be up to them
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 07:10:54 Roads, and cities for car pics
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 07:11:09 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 07:11:21 There' tunnels
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 07:11:28 And more easter eggs

plane-crazy 2021-09-25 07:14:39 hi gammarad
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 07:20:48 Indeed.
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 07:20:59 Boss Battles in PVP mode is what we really need
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 07:21:12 Because aside from free for all, why not cooperate to defeat the boss?
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 07:39:14 Imagine if someone made the **Buran**. They'll just say "ooh its a space shuttle, nice build bro". And then you'll say that "THIS THING ISN'T A SPACE SHUTTLE, IT'S A BURAN, A SOVIET SPACE SHUTTLE."
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 07:39:38 Lemme see
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 07:40:40 I saw it
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 07:40:43 Awesome

plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:11:31 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:11:45 now I'm tryna finalize the design of my fictional soviet tank
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:11:53 it'll have a pike nose
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:11:59 and eight roadwheels
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:12:04 and two guns in one turret
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:12:11 n o i c e
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:12:21 and try doing the 0.5 cylinder technique
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:12:35 good
creations-chat 2021-09-25 12:20:07 looks like that T-90M sure did have a facelift... and weight gain
creations-chat 2021-09-25 12:22:30 BOI... those two cargo jets dont look the same
creations-chat 2021-09-25 12:25:21 yeah, misuse.
creations-chat 2021-09-25 13:43:12 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 14:57:08 Ok, Drawing Finalized. I'll build this tomorrow.
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 14:57:09 It's a nightmare of a tank. Sporting 2x 105mm Smoothbore Guns. Heavy in Weight, and it has the Pike Nose of some Soviet Tank Designs.
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 14:57:20 I made this a while ago.
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 14:57:40 It'll be slow as hecc
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 14:57:44 Slower than the T-72
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 14:57:53 But powerful like a Naval Gun
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 14:59:01 The design is actually based on this.
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 14:59:11 The Tank of Extreme Parameters of Nikolai Shashmurin
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 14:59:24 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 14:59:33 Guess I better lessen the Armor
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 14:59:39 Less Armor = Lighter
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:00:09 Looks good enough
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:21:19 The T-10 has got to be one of the World's longest serving heavy tanks. from 1953 - 1996.
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:23:46 7.41m (Hull), 9.87m (plus Gun)
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:24:41 Maus - 10.2m 
T-10 - 9.87m
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:24:58 There's two maus tanks that still exist
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:25:06 The turret of one prototype, and the hull of another
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:25:17 You'll find THAT in the Kubinka Tank Museum in Russia
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:25:22 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:25:55 Hard to replace components, Slow, Heavy, and it cannot cross bridges.
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:27:11 E-100 - 11.07m 
Maus - 10.2m 
T-10M - 9.87m
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:27:18 E-100 is longer

plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:32:33 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:32:37 "White Tiger"
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:32:45 Britain had a Working Tiger I

plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:33:03 When Hans steals your Vodka
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:33:17 Tiger 131, Bovington Tank Museum
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:33:48 This is what the movie was supposed to use. The replica tiger.
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:33:51 film got rushed
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:33:55 they had to use an IS-2
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:34:08 Replica Tiger for the movie
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:34:11 but was scrapped
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:34:19 now used for re-enactments
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:34:36 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:34:48 A BRIDGE TOO FAR
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:34:54 TAKE COVER! BRING UP THE PIAT!
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:35:01 Make sure its within range!

plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:36:41 Least Kelly's Heroes used real authentic Sherman tanks. also, they're Yugoslavian.
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:36:55 At least Marshal Tito was kind enough to borrow his shermans
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:37:12 Then they got to this...
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:37:28 lend lease
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:37:34 no.
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:37:38 T-34 Tiger I
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:38:08 Jagdpanther from Band of Brothers
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:38:11 looks convincing
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:38:16 but the wheel arrangement...
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:38:36 T-54/55
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:38:45 Leopard 34
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:39:46 Then they have this. an M46 Tiger II in the 1965 movie, The Battle of the Bulge.
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:39:48 Omar Bradley didn't like it
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:40:05 and those are Spanish Patton tanks
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:40:09 Franco agreed to share
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:40:15 oh, ok

plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:41:06 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:41:13 Although fake, its still a practical idea
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:41:19 To make a Waffentrager E-100
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:42:05 Sherman Tank of the JGSDF
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:42:48 Syrian Panzer IV

plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:48:41 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:49:03 Imagine if Operation Valkyrie was a Success, then the Prinz Eugen would have been in service until 1975
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:49:22 Then Tirpitz serving until 1965
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:49:31 And Gneisenau raised, and converted into a BBG.
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 15:49:59 And served until 1975, then reactivated in the 1980's, then served again until 1991 bc of the Kirovs

creations-chat 2021-09-26 02:36:05 <@!359613171495075842> The turret placement on your custom battleship immediately reminded me of that one boss from **Metal Slug 2**. Still an excellent Warship you've built. Perhaps you should name it "**ORION**", since I felt that should be its name.
creations-chat 2021-09-26 02:42:43 I searched up "Bismarck" in Creations. And boy oh boy this has got to be the best one so far. It immediately made me say "Holy Shit" when I saw it for the first time. Wonder how many folds did he made for this... and also, I might build Tirpitz, which looks similar to this. 
This has got to be the most decent build I've ever seen. Really beautiful!

creations-chat 2021-09-26 15:15:51 <@!767387057286021160> Seeing an M60 with side skirts and winter camo is very unusual. The only M60 with side skirts could either be the Israeli **Magach tanks**, the **M60 2000** project, and even the **M60 AMBT**.

creations-chat 2021-09-27 10:08:24 Looked like an unlit cigar rather than an external tank...
creations-chat 2021-09-27 10:10:38 what was this supposed to be? I know thats an external tank, but to what vehicle?
creations-chat 2021-09-27 10:13:27 perhaps try to brighten up the colors a bit so it won't look like an unlit cigar. make it more orange in appearance. 
Try grabbing the colors from this picture that I found online.
creations-chat 2021-09-27 10:15:35 to me, their choice of coloring made it look like a Cigar. 
You wouldn't want a cigar to act as the fuel tank of your Space Shuttle. Also, Cigars burn out.

Also, one of the worst mods in my opinion. But the Challenger 1 is a record-breaking tank. Worst part is, he downvoted it. I hate people who show off.

creations-chat 2021-09-29 09:46:35 It is. But he even told me that "Challenger 2 Better", until I told him that the Challenger 1 is more historic and valuable because it had made a Record Breaking Kill on Operation Desert Storm. I even made this just to show that the Challenger 1 is a record holder. Also, I felt that he was taunting me because I couldnt make tanks that have tracks. I never built any tanks with fully functioning treads in my life, only fake treads.

- T-62 (Ejection System and some of the storage bins) 
- T-64 (Toolboxes and storage bins) 
- Object 277

- Char Leclerc (Autoloading system, never seen, meant to as reasonable functionality)
- T-90 - ERA Armor

general 2021-10-05 05:08:37 its you
creations-chat 2021-10-05 05:25:02 Thoughts of the paint scheme? I tried to match the paint scheme of Cruella's car from the 1961 film.
creations-chat 2021-10-05 05:29:16 The little string is the Horn. Also, there's two versions of Cruella's car.
LEFT - 101 Dalmatians (1961)
RIGHT - 101 Dalmatians (1996), 102 Dalmatians (2000)

I dunno which color scheme to choose from... either the left one or the right one... 
and the Mercedes-Benz 540k does not have horns like that. Only applicable to vehicles from the 1910's. Cruella's Car and the 540k are 1930's vehicles.

creations-chat 2021-10-07 14:09:51 same, like the time that mod (Purifiedwater14) plastered that Challenger 2 in front of my face when I was building my Challenger 1. I viewed it as a mock. Also, he legit said "Challenger 2 better" which I viewed it, in my opinion, "offensive" or "shameful". Worst part is, he downvoted it. 
I guess that's like a "mockery" he did.
creations-chat 2021-10-07 14:12:13 now that is beautiful. Keep building to further improve your builds. The more you build, the more improvements you make. 
Thanks <@!723940197456281640>.
creations-chat 2021-10-07 14:15:30 that I don't know.
creations-chat 2021-10-07 14:18:01 Yes. Challenger 2 **Hotter.** Challenger 1 - **more important**.
bc That is the **tank [Challenger 1]** that scored the **world's longest tank kill** back in **1991 **during **Operation Desert Storm**.
One good reason why **Challenger 1 **is **MORE IMPORTANT** than Challenger 2.
creations-chat 2021-10-07 14:20:14 this was my attempt at making a Blackhawk. Looks terrible. I might as well remake this or keep on practicing until I become pro at helis.

Also, this was built in 2020.
creations-chat 2021-10-07 14:23:29 I understand. but still he downvoted it, which made me feel that I was "mocked". 
Here's evidence.
creations-chat 2021-10-07 14:31:12 something I'd see in War Thunder... One tank, three helis/aircraft.
creations-chat 2021-10-07 14:34:54 well I did build an SPAAG (**Flakpanzer Gepard**), and i dunno if it did get kills or not.

creations-chat 2021-10-11 15:15:44 Tu-4 is basically a B-29 Superfortress.
creations-chat 2021-10-11 15:18:24 I UNDERSTAND. I know. But what if one plans to make the TU-4, then they'll just copy Mad Vulpen's build and plaster the RED STAR on the tails, wings, and fuselage of the fucking plane. I'm adding another Tupolev plane that is really easy to build and get away with. 
Many tutorial builders can easily get away with Vulpen's B-29 and plater on some Soviet Stars and call it a TU-4. Therefore, the TU-4 is still a B-29.
creations-chat 2021-10-11 15:20:31 No one has built this...

I tried doing the .9 Cylinder technique that Boxness made. It ended up failing and destroying the gun. I'll also try to fix the tank's turret since the sides look real bad, especially the edges on where the turret starts to slope down.
creations-chat 2021-10-27 05:21:29 yes
creations-chat 2021-10-27 05:25:40 Sure it does, and I tried replicating the Tiger I's somehow complex mantlet shape.

plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:52:15 I think I see the problem. The wedge is interfering the elevation of the gun.

creations-chat 2021-10-30 17:29:19 <@!420713956231872521> Your **USS Lexington (CC-1)** is utter dogshit. You have harassed a *Battlecruiser that never was*. I have only one word to say to you: **COPE**.
creations-chat 2021-10-30 17:35:55 I don't know if he's new or not. and if the player is new to the game, then he better learn from the experts and this constructive criticism to improve his build. 

Also. If you looked up the **history of the Lexington-Class Aircraft Carrier**. It's true that the Lexington was **supposed to be a Battlecruiser for the US Navy**. But due to restrictions imposed on the **Naval Treaties after World War I**, the Battlecruiser was converted into an **Aircraft Carrier**. Two carriers were built (Lexington and Saratoga).
creations-chat 2021-10-30 17:39:02 I should have gone easy on him... My biggest mistake. I was being a "perfectionist" when I wrote that essay.
creations-chat 2021-10-30 17:42:20 lol that will be considered "cheating". It should be you who will be doing it. Try reading some Essays so you can be inspired when making one.
creations-chat 2021-10-30 18:36:43 I know the current situation of Roblox. The Lexington Battlecruiser was never built (but converted into an Aircraft Carrier), so only images of models, paintings, or blueprints of the Battlecruiser are available online. Also, I thought he built it days/months BEFORE the Roblox Server Shutdown.
Below you is the blueprints for the never were Lexington-Class Battlecruisers (one of the designs)
creations-chat 2021-10-30 18:41:16 Yes. Also some of the sources are of low image quality. There's even 3d models of the Lexington in 3d Warehouse. One has the several funnels design variation with the other being the final design based on the image that I uploaded.
creations-chat 2021-10-30 18:43:52 Here are some of the Lexington Battlecruiser models that I found in 3d Warehouse.
creations-chat 2021-10-30 23:42:17 Yeah. I didn't know he was new to the server

general 2021-11-03 14:54:08 yess
general 2021-11-03 14:54:37 In broadcasting and radio communications, a call sign (also known as a call name or call letters—and historically as a call signal—or abbreviated as a call) is a unique designation for a transmitter station. A call sign can be formally assigned by a government agency, informally adopted by individuals or organizations, or even cryptographically encoded to disguise a station's identity.

creations-chat 2021-11-06 13:59:48 overall, your T-90 doesnt look like one. This is (almost) a T-90 (image below). 
Learn how to get the shape of the tank right, and look up **reference images** and try to **overlay a blueprint** to your build to **keep the proportions right**. I use **Photographic Imagery** to get the proportions of my T-90 correct. 

If you look at **blueprints **and overlay them to your build in progress via **Photoshop**/**AutoDesk Sketchbook **(*required to download*),  you'll get the correct proportions of the object you desire to build.

This is not meant to shame you in any way, I'm just giving you tips on how to build things in the correct shape and proportions. If you get easily "*offended*" in this little essay I made, you're a pillock.
creations-chat 2021-11-06 14:02:46 Okay you're a pillock, you got easily offended by it. 

This, Gentlemen, is an example of a guy who doesn't know how to listen to the essay that I made. He's just carefree and doesn't give a shit about the words I make. If and only if he could listen to my words, he would cope with the skill issues he has. 

So **Mr. Booger**. You sir, are a Pillock, and you sir don't know how to **learn **from the essay that I, myself, have constructed. and I give you this simple remark. You have **Skill Issue**.

creations-chat 2021-11-06 16:44:53 If it's inspired from the Dunkirk Movie, I think you based it off SS Paris. I'm guessing the ship was built in around somewhere in the 1910's. The shape of your ship looks unidentifiable.

creations-chat 2021-11-08 10:18:11 <@!426983148342083594> Your Su-76 looks out of shape. Try to add in the other details on the tank and improve the shaping of the vehicle for it to look better. Darken the colors too. And try to improve the tank' suspension.
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 10:21:57 How about T-72?

plane-crazy 2021-11-08 10:27:03 But your idea having an Sr-72 as a Drone is great. I'd give your rendition of the Sr-72 a good 8/10.
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 10:27:11 Size of the plane can't be determined

plane-crazy 2021-11-09 01:32:39 Shall be missed
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 01:32:45 Poosuf has to ruin it
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 01:33:52 Yuro called Admiral Hipper that.
general 2021-11-09 02:43:04 Did it?
general 2021-11-09 02:43:08 Did it reach 200?
general 2021-11-09 02:43:16 Damn!
general 2021-11-09 02:43:27 Guess his upvotes will have him a very good career ahead.
general 2021-11-09 02:43:38 He'll further cope with the problems he's faced
general 2021-11-09 02:43:46 Holy fuck... It did.
general 2021-11-09 02:44:17 For real though. He will have to cope with his problems (the creations blacklist) to improve his builds.
general 2021-11-09 02:44:22 A step in the right direction.
general 2021-11-09 02:44:51 So real
general 2021-11-09 02:45:39 Yeah...
general 2021-11-09 02:45:48 He would have done Better if it weren't for Poosuf
general 2021-11-09 02:46:24 You should be in Rank 3 to gain access to Photos.
general 2021-11-09 02:46:39 Check your rank in <#384027830192832513> and do !rank.
general 2021-11-09 02:46:42 It's easy.
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:47:30 That takes plenty of time and effort doing this kind of motorlock.
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:47:47 Daaamn....
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:48:04 Dunno how many days does it take to build an F-14.
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:48:16 Yo- what the fuck happened to that Tank?
bot-central 2021-11-09 02:48:33 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:50:55 Maybe he made it realistic as if to pay homage to Ace Combat...
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:51:08 Custom livery? Homage livery?
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:51:13 Guess so.
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:51:17 Homage Livery.
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:51:25 A little homage to Ace Combat.
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:51:52 You can even get into tunnels
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:51:59 Wouldn't happen in real life
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:52:05 Like that Plane Scene in Indiana Jones
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:52:36 Wait
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:52:41 A Redbull Stunt Plane...

plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:55:49 He actually did it...
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 02:55:56 He actually freakin' did it!
general 2021-11-09 02:57:37 Tiger I Early Production
general 2021-11-09 02:59:00 Agreed. Can be seen in Saving Private Ryan and Kelly's Heroes.
general 2021-11-09 03:01:41 I think a Panther replica used a T-55 chassis.
general 2021-11-09 03:03:13 ooh
general 2021-11-09 03:03:33 yeah
general 2021-11-09 03:03:43 This is a near convincing Jagdpanther
general 2021-11-09 03:03:55 featured in Band of Brothers\
general 2021-11-09 03:04:06 very strange seeing variants change
general 2021-11-09 03:04:30 just like how many coaches the Polar Express gets in the Movie.
general 2021-11-09 03:04:34 the train has 5 coaches
general 2021-11-09 03:04:44 but then in some scenes the train gets 20 coaches
general 2021-11-09 03:04:49 yeah
general 2021-11-09 03:05:00 like that girl said to the boy
general 2021-11-09 03:06:16 "It's a Magic Train"
**Nerd Kid:**
"It's a bAldwin tYpe S2 cLass sTeaM LocOmoTivE"
**Me:** 
"Beat it, Nerd. It's a Pere Marquette Berkshire manufactured by the Lima Locomotive Works. Get your identification right."
general 2021-11-09 03:06:27 and Santa's Sleigh when it zooms out
general 2021-11-09 03:07:25 yeah
general 2021-11-09 03:07:31 and Chris Van Allsburg grew up with it
general 2021-11-09 03:07:42 because the Train was owned by the Michigan State University
general 2021-11-09 03:07:46 Christmas
general 2021-11-09 03:07:49 12/25
general 2021-11-09 03:08:44 yep
general 2021-11-09 03:08:55 would be very awesome if the real 1225 used Sierra No. 3's whistle.
general 2021-11-09 03:09:01 Robert Zemeckis.
general 2021-11-09 03:12:01 Also, that Ice Scene may not be logical
general 2021-11-09 03:12:19 better if the train were to stay on tracks that had been flooded
general 2021-11-09 03:12:22 yes
general 2021-11-09 03:12:40 yeah
general 2021-11-09 03:13:44 Big Boy is faster
general 2021-11-09 03:13:56 The train would have stayed on a bridge that had been flooded
general 2021-11-09 03:14:08 and lets say the ground clearance of the train would be four to five feet deep.
general 2021-11-09 03:14:21 and the train would have to plow through thick ice at a slow rate
general 2021-11-09 03:14:25 like an Icebreaker ship.
general 2021-11-09 03:14:33 I don't speak Svenska
creations-chat 2021-11-09 06:27:38 <@!712137110827565117> Nice Oil Tanker. Fix the Stern, add a few details on the ship, and give it a name!

general 2021-11-12 12:46:22 wait
general 2021-11-12 12:46:32 is it because I submitted two builds?
general 2021-11-12 12:46:43 dm's

creations-chat 2021-11-12 13:31:23 Now it's time to make him scream... (is currently building Admiral Hipper)
creations-chat 2021-11-12 13:56:32 agreed, but why does he dislike so many decent looking builds?
creations-chat 2021-11-12 13:58:35 goddamn... build that creation he downvoted better then show it off to the guy who got downvoted by him? If that's the thing, then I don't like him.
creations-chat 2021-11-12 14:01:15 I dunno if the feedback he gives is negative. I have a feeling he's like that Drill Sergeant in the military only to teach the light-hearted man how to be a soldier in the most... "disciplined" way possible.
creations-chat 2021-11-12 14:04:18 now the use of words is a bit too... strong... in the eyes of some guys who are easily affected by it. like me. 
<@!610461229856849920> Good luck with the Apache.
creations-chat 2021-11-12 14:07:12 Gordon Ramsay... is much more worse than him (the fact he yells at and straight up insults everyone in Hell's Kitchen). Hars is like a toned-down version of Ramsay. so, guess I am not gonna speak anything negative about him. gotta cope with that and start thinkin that Hars is **Gordon Ramsay**, but toned down.
<@!610461229856849920> My opinions on Hars.
creations-chat 2021-11-12 14:09:34 funny thing is my mom has a French Boss... She works for an International Construction Company with Foreign Bosses and team members.
general 2021-11-12 14:09:52 explain the breakdown
general 2021-11-12 14:10:02 is it going bad as shit levels?
creations-chat 2021-11-12 14:11:39 least Hars is kind for everyone in the office. Shows concern for the workers with serious concerns... <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
general 2021-11-12 14:12:13 "I can assure you, there are no women in this army."

general 2021-11-12 14:13:15 the song fits this well

general 2021-11-12 14:14:43 *Listens to "Nikita" by Elton John*
creations-chat 2021-11-12 14:29:52 least I'm experienced. Was new to the game in 2019.
creations-chat 2021-11-12 14:43:12 add the extra details for Hars to be impressed
creations-chat 2021-11-12 14:46:02 T-64 just mad cause it hates capitalists
the-dump 2021-11-12 14:54:46 
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 15:24:52 sides of the tank reminds me of a churchill.... basically a modified and enlarged churchill...
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 15:27:45 would call that historically inaccurate since the churchill was in production in around the 1930's. I'd call that a "what if" tank if World War I hadn't ended with a truce and went on until 1945.
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 15:29:28 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 15:29:39 That would be really menacing
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 15:29:52 And Austrian Man replacing the Kaiser once he dies
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 15:42:27 **Cromwell Tank** with the *quadruple mount guns* of the **King George V-Class Battleships**.
general 2021-11-12 15:43:36 What is that?
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 15:43:56 How about Missouri's sister ships?
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 15:44:03 That applies too.
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 15:44:28 Oh. **Challenger 2** Turret on **HMS Belfast**.
general 2021-11-12 16:01:51 Watch a Herrguggi tutorial
general 2021-11-12 16:01:57 he made thin tracks
general 2021-11-12 16:13:29 same
creations-chat 2021-11-12 16:43:42 <@!693508083145769101> You are absolutely **correct**. **Lend-Lease Program** is the reason why the Soviets used Spitfires. Not just them, even the P-39 Airacobra, M4 Sherman, Churchill Tanks, and many more.
general 2021-11-12 16:44:59 least I met rickje in game
general 2021-11-12 16:45:31 you did?
general 2021-11-12 16:45:33 How?
general 2021-11-12 16:46:04 noice
creations-chat 2021-11-12 16:48:47 Least you got the plane model correct. Your build looks pretty good. Gotta commend you for Historical Accuracy.
general 2021-11-12 16:48:56 once.
general 2021-11-12 16:49:13 goddamn...
general 2021-11-12 16:49:36 how did he respond?
general 2021-11-12 16:53:42 same here
general 2021-11-12 17:04:20 more like "Did I zip my pants?"
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 17:51:23 Would recommend using HerrGuggi's tank treads... looks off seeing a Sherman woth thicc tracks.
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 17:52:11 Agreed
creations-chat 2021-11-13 01:16:31 Exceptionally good. Brilliant. And is that the Main Armament I see in front of it?
creations-chat 2021-11-13 01:18:37 <@!414359638302130176> I've designed my own car too, but it's in the style of the 1950's. I might make one based on this Kennedy-inspired Limo that I made in 3d Builder.
creations-chat 2021-11-13 01:23:10 Noice

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 09:08:27 That's enough for an epic badass diorama. Do not add more
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 09:09:05 No more angles
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 09:09:08 They look good
general 2021-11-13 09:10:11 Cephalopod Game
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 09:12:31 This is a perfect angle.
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 09:13:36 Really shows the menacing and powerful stature of the Tiger Tank
creations-chat 2021-11-13 09:15:09 What is that large gap on the nose of the plane? Better patch that up and fix it.
Also, better make those engines completely cylindrical to hide that nasty exposed motorlock.
creations-chat 2021-11-13 09:17:44 Very strange to see a door mechanism like that. Usually Pilots enter the plane from underneath.
~~(am seriously not trying to cringe very hard on how you made the door that way)~~
creations-chat 2021-11-13 09:24:14 Afterburner where?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 09:25:05 More like "Ardennes Assault".
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 09:25:19 Ardennes Assault is better
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 09:25:26 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 09:26:13 umm what
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 09:26:46 The chances of that being in the HoF are... 50-50
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 09:27:14 Yeah.
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 09:27:22 70% wont make it
30% will make it
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 09:27:52 Yeah.
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 09:31:44 Only three would do...
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 09:32:02 I dunno...
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 09:32:07 Make a decision
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 09:32:20 I'll be the third, since I was supportive of the Project.
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 09:32:44 Just say "I'd like to thank Everyone who supported this Project"
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 09:33:30 Ok why not 
"I'd like to thank the people who helped me - Me, Weep, and YT - and Everyone else who supported this project."

Make the masts and tower a little higher (maybe 10 blocks taller) and rework the hull and the ship itself.

plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:54:19 In today's standards, not good. By 2019's standards, looks pretty decent

plane-crazy 2021-12-14 05:24:30 It's impossible to have him reported.
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 05:24:42 There should be a Watch on people doing illegal things.
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 05:24:55 And if they are in the PCC, an Insta Ban.

plane-crazy 2021-12-14 10:53:18 I wanted it to be as real as possibl
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 10:53:24 but it is challenging
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 10:53:32 guess I'll have to sacrifice it
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 10:53:35 for once
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 11:21:19 I think I have found the solution to my problems...

plane-crazy 2021-12-14 12:14:18 I'd cut their heads off
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 12:15:27 I'd cut them off like Frank Costanza, when he's decapitated the head of a doll that looks like his own wife.

creations-chat 2021-12-14 14:33:45 <@!620688670105534476> Domino Squadron would have been better, since those dots remind me of those from a Domino or a Dice.
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 15:56:37 Should have painted it green to match armata's color
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 15:57:07 ah, ok
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 15:57:26 I have finally made the window frames.
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 15:57:30 problem solved
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 15:58:09 I remember doing one last year, it was low effort and shit.
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 15:58:21 I might redo it after this one.
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 15:58:28 I'll make a Mercedes collection
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 15:58:44 The G4, 70K Grosser, and the 600 Grosser once owned by Jeremy Clarkson
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 15:59:02 they're all signs
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 00:55:39 That's an even better looking front compared to my Tiger.
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 00:57:52 I don't have that screenshot.
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 00:58:13 I'll be adding it to my collection of Best (Joke) Creations of Plane Crazy.
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 00:58:43 Yeah

plane-crazy 2021-12-15 01:07:29 Finally
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 01:07:32 I have the screenshot
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 01:09:04 The Tiger is there in my collection.
creations-chat 2021-12-15 01:12:19 <@!748315167460425788> Make that headlamp smaller. Train overall is good, but that comically huge headlamp must be smaller.
creations-chat 2021-12-15 01:15:00 Understandable. But looks like the one from the movie poster though.
creations-chat 2021-12-15 01:20:56 Now that looks movie accurate, but the bigger light one looks better.
creations-chat 2021-12-15 01:24:58 Bigger light is better, changed my mind with the smaller one.
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 01:26:50 Don't.
creations-chat 2021-12-15 01:42:54 Working Radar... I can't see any radars on the conning tower of the U-Boat. 
Also, it's quite less detailed and the colors appear to be oversaturated. Try to add the side rails near the conning tower, and those two objects on the stern of the ship. 
The deck should be gray, not a wooden texture. And that naval gun on the front of the ship isn't an AA Weapon.
creations-chat 2021-12-15 01:45:44 Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman...
general 2021-12-15 01:48:28 Too bad, I enlisted in the Navy to prevent this draft...
general 2021-12-15 01:48:49 Only way to dodge the draft is to just enlist in the army or Marines
general 2021-12-15 01:48:54 Or get into an accident
general 2021-12-15 01:49:06 GREAT GOOGLY MOOGLY, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT
general 2021-12-15 01:49:25 What happened to it
general 2021-12-15 01:55:11 I dunno if that is actually intended to be part of a script for a Fourth Wall break.
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 01:56:18 The tank front is good, but Astolfo inside of it... it scares me.
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 01:56:43 Wittmann or Carius would be weirded out to see a trap as part of his crew.
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 01:59:05 **Otto Carius:** A pink-haired girl? 
**Michael Wittmann:** Astolfo's a Boy. Didn't you read "In the Matter of France", Otto?
**Kurt Knispel:** We have a Crossdresser inside this tank. Can't remember seeing them since my last sendoff party. 
**Johannes Bölter:** Hey guys, look! She's with the Panzer Division!
**Everyone except Bölter:** Send him to the Wehrmachthelferinnen!
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 02:07:21 There is no exact blueprint on what the Ratte actually looks like, in my opinion.
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 02:08:21 Ah, okay. Show me.
creations-chat 2021-12-15 02:10:26 <@!690727914521493504> Looks like that He 177 is intercepting that Fr*nch plane...

general 2021-12-15 02:26:53 The Living Daylights (1987) 
That ice chase scene...
general 2021-12-15 02:26:56 Watch it
general 2021-12-15 02:27:19 James Bond uses his car to cut a hole to sink a Police Car.
general 2021-12-15 02:27:33 Wait you know the James Bond movies?
general 2021-12-15 02:27:45 Then what movie is it with the car chase scene in the ice?

plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:31:44 It's not yet finished
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:31:54 I'll post the final product either tomorrow or Friday
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:32:17 Also, There's like SEVERAL Piston Locking on that Mercedes.
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:32:36 Door handles are in the wrong position, but still looked okay to me
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:32:50 Any casualties in the crash?
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:33:09 Guess we'll have to try again
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:33:14 until you succeed
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:34:04 good.
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:34:16 Your ideas are good, but some need revision.
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:34:27 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:34:29 yet tricky
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:34:34 time it right
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:34:51 yep
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:35:20 dunno who discovered piston locks
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:35:43 yeah.
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:35:58 I use the same key to angle lock everything
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:36:05 you better set the speed of the motor
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:36:15 so you can get the angle lock at the EXACT position
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:36:26 be sure to set the speed of the motor
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:36:34 so you can get the desired angle
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:36:42 I did that once on that Mercedes.
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:36:56 but sometimes glitches
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:37:25 umm, okay
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 17:37:58 why, because you miss his voice?

Learn how to get the proportions right to make it look like a Chaffee. Looks are what we're looking for, so that's why it's being downvoted.

creations-chat 2021-12-17 10:32:08 use motorlocks. that way the cowcatchers won't make contact or touch with the tracks when the train goes on sharp curves.
general 2021-12-17 10:33:17 maybe they just used it by the force of their bodies
general 2021-12-17 10:33:30 they just pushed themselves to make the craft go down into earth
creations-chat 2021-12-17 10:37:23 I'm no expert of trains, and I'll try to explain it with the best of my ability. 
There should be wheel bases that turn independently on the two idler wheels on the front and end of the locomotive.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 10:43:21 <@!628210942231969802> "Added some Details"... Where are they?
- Add more Decals, Markings, and numbers on the plane.
- Paint the plane in any existing paint scheme such as the one presented before you below. One color planes, in my opinion, look bland to me. Paint it in a unique scheme. 
- Rockets and weapons underneath the wings are too bland. Try making them look like bombs, external fuel tanks, and Sidewinder missiles (Use sparklers, if you have, and try your best to turn them into Sidewinders with Delta Wings and motorlocking). 
- Try removing those exposed motorlocks with the best of your ability.
<@!682147422218223616> I meant text decals. There's no sign strapped or taped on the plane that say "Don't shoot me, I'm a Pilot in Training".
creations-chat 2021-12-17 10:45:56 "Firearms"... I think you meant PAYLOAD.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 10:48:21 Understandable. And somehow, the way you said those words remind me of that one builder who made a *less-detailed F4 Phantom* built ONLY for PVP and said that "*I don't care how it looks*"... Someone give me the *link to that guy's creation* if you can still remember.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 10:51:32 Here's a quick lecture for you.
**Firearms** are *Handguns used by People*. (Ex. of *Firearms*: **Mauser Kar98K**, **FN Five Seven**)
**Payload** are the *cargo/bombs stored inside/on the wings of an Aircraft or Fighter*. (Ex. of *Payload*: **SNEB Missile pods**, **External Fuel Tanks**)

creations-chat 2021-12-17 11:03:43 maybe move the wheels a bit further from the cowcatcher. Three or four blocks away, perhaps. ||Why did Rickje made sharp curves... I hope in PC2 they would make thinner gauge tracks and less sharp curves..||
creations-chat 2021-12-17 11:06:02 If my expectations are correct. I think it won't reach the Hall of Fame. 
If I were to be in the position of those people in the VIP room, then I'd say it won't make it in because the design is "too simple" based on high standards and opinions from the "council".

creations-chat 2021-12-18 15:25:55 Hang on. I've made a Do 18, but it's for passenger service with Deutsche Lufthansa. Might build it again soon. Looked decent. Least I made the plane's rigging.

Also, a little advice. if I were you, I would have made a quick sketch of your G-107. Always draw your plane first before building it in game. Treat it as if you're an "Aeronautical Engineer" of some sort. Nice custom plane though. Reminds me of German Designs. Might even draw or "improve" your custom plane. It's missing some things that most German aircraft inherit.

Perhaps try to add in some external fuel tanks and bombs aside from just all rockets. And the shade of gray is a bit dark imo. Lighten it up by +5 or +7. And try to add the numbers, decals, and markings on it. Use US Navy or USAF pictures as reference.
creations-chat 2021-12-21 05:37:09 Use Emojis. Motor lock them, and you will get those USAF insignias.
creations-chat 2021-12-21 05:42:35 Did you try adding a letter M next to the emoji? Oh, and also set the size to 80 to cover up the M.

And also, if you're building a German Cruiser, take my advice on this constructive criticism I've made.

*1.5 Look at some reference images of tanks (any era in which you prefer, ex. WWII, Cold War, Modern) and sketch them out.* 

2. Once finished, start building your custom tank. There is no time limit on finishing the build. You have plenty of time to make some corrections here and there. Take your time.

creations-chat 2022-01-01 02:52:46 <@!678986403153182772>  Let me give you a quick review on your Tu-160. 
- The Tu-160's tail should be shorter. You made it look like it was malnourished or it had been into the Gulag.
- The tail wings too should be a little bit shorter.
- Afterburner dimensions are wrong. Extend the engines a bit longer, and the jet itself has FOUR engines, not two. 
- Engine intakes should be a bit wider. 
- The shape of the Tu-160's Wings are so out of proportion that the front of your plane made it look like a Space Shuttle hybrid.

Verdict: **3/10** Uncool, Historically Inaccurate. 

Notes: Follow the blueprints and try to analyze the plane itself. Try to get the shaping of the plane right so it will actually look like the Tu-160 Blackjack. I am not hating you or anything (not yet), I am trying to help you build better with the best of my ability.

creations-chat 2022-01-02 04:12:50 <@!678986403153182772> There are so many things wrong with that "Panzer III Ausf. K" of yours. Allow me to tell you the many faults and errors. 
- Entire tank is too far from the real Panzer III K. Although the variant did not exist physically, it only reached its Design stage. Never made it off the drawing board.
- The turret shape just so reminds me of the British Cruiser Mk. II. 
- Panzer III K's have six road wheels. Not five. Only applicable to the Panzer III A. 
- The rear of the Panzer III K is too far off from the real thing. 

Overall score: **2/10** Seriously Uncool. Historically Inaccurate. 

Please look at the vehicle and get the components and characteristics right.

general 2022-01-05 13:32:12 Watch The Hunt for Red October
general 2022-01-05 13:32:14 a real kicker

<@!495210490172014612> Nice hybrid you got there.
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:37:29 because of its nose, it is reminiscent of a Lancaster.
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:37:36 but still its an Ace Combat thing
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:37:43 haven't played some of the games yet
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:37:51 but I did see gameplay of Ace Combat 7
general 2022-01-05 13:38:23 Don't Watch the movie I mentioned.
general 2022-01-05 13:38:29 I can't think of any good films
general 2022-01-05 13:38:38 well I did watch Saving Private Ryan
general 2022-01-05 13:38:53 nah, just forget what I said. Go watch it
general 2022-01-05 13:38:57 Suspenseful scenes
general 2022-01-05 13:38:59 great acting
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:41:43 1. You see a really good build
2. You see a good build, but with some of the details omitted
3. You see a build with a familiar shape, but the proportions are off-hand
4. You see a build that's deemed too cursed and dubbed as a certain object (i.e. "Bismarck")
5. You see a build so bad that it was built by a child.
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:42:11 this a Hangar?
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:42:17 nice interior
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:43:15 I don't or have not watched Breaking Bad yet.

plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:46:21 yeah
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:47:22 Nice reaction, and to be serious, I hope EDP would find something better. Face the consequences, and get some help from the crimes he has committed.
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:47:39 It is
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:47:44 and he is in serious trouble
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:47:54 I feel a bit bad for him as to he's getting fired all the time
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:48:14 He is not, according to SomeOrdinaryGamers
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:48:25 EDP should be jailed and should face the consequences.
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:48:31 And then get some help from a counselor
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:48:48 and yep Mutahar showed us a clip of him eating tiny bits of cupcakes
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:49:01 yeah
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:49:25 EDP better be arrested, and then get some therapy during his time in the slammer
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:49:37 he's admitted to his crimes, and he should turn up a new leaf
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:50:11 but damnit why does it remind me of a Lego Game.... Something something LEGO Star Wars...
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:50:37 I can already picture the character selection screen and life on the top left and right corner
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:50:43 and then the stud count if you are a True Jedi
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:51:20 Let me slide into your DM's, since the crimes he has done are clearly against the guidelines of this community.
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:52:13 oh damn, okay

the-dump 2022-01-05 13:52:23 no he isn;t
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:52:31 EDP is not a member of the community
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:52:39 he just makes videos
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:52:44 often associated with memes
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:53:17 well its some serious stuff. This community does not allow any... how do I put it... sensitive topic about Crimes and all.
the-dump 2022-01-05 13:53:28 so I DM'd you so you will see it for yourself
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:54:34 sort of reminds me of a four wheeled farming vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:56:05 the log up front is used to get the vehicle unstuck
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:56:12 or to prevent it to get stuck with somethinf
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:56:28 or maybe the same thing that Clarkson used in his car in the Africa special of Top Gear
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:56:58 It is an APC in your view. But to me, looked like a farming vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:57:00 or road repair
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:57:24 or maybe build Mine rollers
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:57:25 or a mine plow
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:57:47 BAD IDEA
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 13:57:53 scratch that mine plow idea
creations-chat 2022-01-05 13:59:57 Sad thing is it's minutes before the plant exploded.

plane-crazy 2022-01-25 11:39:22 Oh damn whats the name of this design?
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 11:39:31 I made a 3d model of a similar plane like that
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 11:39:52 Ah, okay
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 11:40:03 Not real judging by the roundels on the wings
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 11:40:17 Looks like that would appear in Ace Combat or Grand Theft Auto
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 11:40:31 But the first image made it look real.
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 11:40:40 Since its painted gray like most American fighters
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 11:40:52 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 11:40:55 An Experiment
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 11:41:13 JSchlatt loses a Chess Game after two moves.
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 11:42:57 Go ahead and watch it and see it all.
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 11:42:57 Was gonna send the link
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 11:42:57 Damn...
general 2022-01-25 11:43:14 Wait toxic furry where?
general 2022-01-25 11:43:44 Did he leave the game?
general 2022-01-25 11:43:50 Was he an unde or newbie?
general 2022-01-25 11:43:54 Good.
general 2022-01-25 11:45:03 "Take her to sea Mr. Murdoch. Let's stretch her legs."
general 2022-01-25 11:46:03 What did ya do
general 2022-01-25 11:46:17 Oh damn...
general 2022-01-25 11:46:28 Female Spiders live longer than their male counterparts
general 2022-01-25 11:46:37 The male spider dies after mating
general 2022-01-25 11:46:52 Okay now this is turning into BBC Nature
creations-chat 2022-01-25 11:48:36 He means everything to me. In reality. ||He means nothing to me. Just an annoying fly buzzing around people's business. ||
general 2022-01-25 11:49:24 Thanks for the words, Sir Attenborough
general 2022-01-25 11:49:56 Wonder what pic is it?
general 2022-01-25 11:50:04 Good idea
general 2022-01-25 11:50:06 Send to dms
general 2022-01-25 11:53:47 Until he makes us completely deaf
general 2022-01-25 11:55:19 Why did I read that in Squidward's voice
general 2022-01-25 11:55:59 Also a reason why I deleted Asspalt 9
general 2022-01-25 11:56:15 Yeah
general 2022-01-25 11:56:23 Least I deleted it before I experience the pain
general 2022-01-25 11:56:33 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 11:57:04 Better make adjustments to the ship. Good luck finishing the Savannah!
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 11:57:14 Oh, and try to build the Otto Hahn.
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 11:57:26 Hello nightchaser
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 11:57:59 hello chestnuts
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 11:59:54 Yeah.
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:00:22 But Otto Hahn's first captain was Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock,  a U-Boat Captain.
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:00:26 How ironic.
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:00:40 A man tasked to sink freighters becomes the captain of various.
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:02:10 This is very hard to explain.
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:02:53 Okay.
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:03:13 I am thinking of overlaying the blueprints over a Checkerboard to simulate the block count
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:07:16 
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:07:18 Right here
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:07:28 One tile is equal to one block.
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:07:47 Some of them require the use of half blocks
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:07:52 No worries
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:09:02 I dunno how many studs
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:09:27 The dimensions are always calculated by studs
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:10:25 Finish the rest of the ship. The progress is looking good. Try to add variation of the colors and sort of "weather" the ship.
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:10:44 It's impossible to make a full interior on a ship like that.
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:11:19 Perhaps a mini Nuclear Reactor?
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:11:34 Good luck, Shipwright.
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:11:55 You will if you wish to get them
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:12:03 You're a good candidate for Shipwright.
general 2022-01-25 12:13:07 That CSL Homage... My God... Looks like a Pig.
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:15:13 A swimming pool...
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:15:42 Is that a Swimming Pool?
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:16:23 Hope it's not radiated
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:16:47 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:16:57 Aquariums
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:17:05 Probably
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:17:07 Dunno
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:17:15 Water Blocks for Aquariums
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:17:29 I dunno about the Savannah
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:17:32 Its a Nuclear Ship
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:17:41 I think its a Freighter
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:17:45 Not a fishing vessel
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 12:18:02 Least I got the Freighter part correct ig

plane-crazy 2022-03-01 12:43:14 I'm excited
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 12:43:32 Is it from Bernard Hermann?
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 12:44:22 Don't tell me it's from Thundercats
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 12:44:32 Panther
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 12:44:35 It's a Panther

plane-crazy 2022-03-01 12:47:15 Kuromorimine tonk
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 12:47:22 I see.
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 12:47:25 Limitations
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 12:47:29 It's okay
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 12:48:39 Just hope that Panther won't catch fire on random...
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 12:51:52 Beautiful
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 12:52:11 Does it have a hand crank?

general 2022-05-04 11:47:25 dunno if that the yb-49
general 2022-05-04 11:47:53 oh am wrong
general 2022-05-04 11:48:02 yb-49 is grandpa b-2
general 2022-05-04 11:49:14 If the B-29 and the B-47 and then the XB-35 had a child, this would be the result.
general 2022-05-04 11:50:43 I forgot the name of that plane that has a huge wingspan like arsenal bird...
general 2022-05-04 11:52:27 So it needs JATO/RATO assistance.
creations-chat 2022-05-05 02:39:16 I'm crossing my fingers for your Gustav build...
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 02:40:13 Thats a nice battleship. Even though design is old
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 02:40:25 USS Tennessee?
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 02:40:40 Correct guess for me
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 02:41:44 Thats a baltimore
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 02:43:01 My Admiral Hipper has 12K blocks
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 02:43:41 Learning is better than copying
plane-crazy 2022-05-05 02:43:53 Or use copying as a little study
creations-chat 2022-05-05 02:45:00 👍
creations-chat 2022-05-05 02:49:47 Its complicated...
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 09:41:41 You shouldn't have done that. You spoiled my surprise...
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 09:41:48 Now everyone's gonna not like it.
creations-chat 2022-05-17 09:43:47 eurotism
creations-chat 2022-05-17 09:53:08 This config would have been better imo. Still, nice floatplane, though.
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 09:55:14 Should have told ya earlier, but it's somehow different compared to the final product
creations-chat 2022-05-17 10:11:32 Looks okay, but I suggest you to make the funnels (and the ship) thinner. The funnel placement is quite asymmetric and tricky to pull off. At least I made a spacing scheme for the blocks as a guide.
creations-chat 2022-05-17 10:13:16 His hull ain't finished yet. We'll tell if the stern is complete.
creations-chat 2022-05-17 10:49:30 They look good. But you still have to thin down the funnels and make them a wee bit taller.
creations-chat 2022-05-17 10:52:43 https://tenor.com/view/youknow-you-gif-19056787
creations-chat 2022-05-17 10:57:24 At least 3x3 thin.
creations-chat 2022-05-17 12:14:14 Keep it.
creations-chat 2022-05-17 12:23:22 Yeah, I should have spent more time fixing the bridge, since that's one of the problems. 
Sort of looks off, but still I made an excellent effort in making the Louisiana.
creations-chat 2022-05-17 12:30:26 Me too, when I looked at the blueprints.
creations-chat 2022-05-17 12:34:53 Yes, and I know how did you find out my age.
creations-chat 2022-05-17 12:37:13 15 years old, you are. Correct, you are, <@658778901463564309>.
creations-chat 2022-05-18 01:54:31 Maybe I'll fix the kingfishers, make her main guns turn, and fix the bridge.
creations-chat 2022-05-18 02:50:45 Now what's missing is New Hampshire and Maine. 
Someone's built Louisiana, Montana, and Ohio...
plane-crazy 2022-05-19 05:42:26 thanks pal
general 2022-05-31 15:03:47 10 minute slowdown?
creations-chat 2022-06-17 11:22:26 The Motorlocks on the ropes are meant to be those things. Dunno what they're called.
creations-chat 2022-06-17 11:24:56 Wing Lights would do.
<@721103577380159490> exactly, like I said.
creations-chat 2022-06-18 09:19:24 <@251821807181627392> I recommend you to try and use motorlocking to make your Vintage Bugatti look better. I used heavy motorlocking on my Mercedes-Benz 770 to make it look phenomenal. 

It took me days to finish my Mercedes-Benz because of Motorlocking, somehow similar to restoring an old and vintage car which takes around years to restore. 

Motorlocking makes things look better. Trust me.
creations-chat 2022-06-18 09:56:48 What did he admire?
creations-chat 2022-06-18 09:59:36 At least try to make the nose cover by adding another layer of Motorlock.
creations-chat 2022-06-18 13:10:20 <@594118415384313856> Thanks. Good luck on the modifications.

creations-chat 2022-06-21 04:59:35 <@915471910991720499> I'm sorry to give you a negative remark on your Yamato Battleship. 

   The way you built the ship made the final product look like the Yamato got a Tumor. Please follow the blueprints and try to make an exact copy of the ship that you are building. **The colors look okay**, but the ship itself is... really questionable. 

   Next time, please try to copy what's in the blueprint/picture, so people will get a positive impression into your ships. Even I make mistakes in building stuff, but at least I did an excellent work because I have time and patience. **Time and Patience is what you need**. Shipbuilding takes a long time.
creations-chat 2022-06-21 05:05:41 <@466141758468915210> Fantastic work on your late 1930's Destroyer! 

   I really liked the way you added a custom camo scheme that can potentially be seen in World of Warships, and the portholes you've added are the Piece de Resistance to the vessel itself. I have a few words regarding with the waterline and the portholes near it. At least make the lower portholes very close to the waterline to make it more realistic, if you wish to do it. 

Another thing: I bet you based this ship from a Type 1936 A Destroyer.

creations-chat 2022-06-24 03:21:40 <@456226577798135808> The Engines on your Alekseyev KM are a bit small. Perhaps make them bigger by using larger jet engines. The lower wing parts should be extended a bit by three or five blocks. Tail wings need to be a bit longer by two or three blocks. The canopy needs a rework, and some antennas should be added at the top of the plane (ignore the ones in the bottom, its a model).

creations-chat 2022-06-26 09:24:42 <@385421093969854465> Have the forward mast of the Jackdaw a bit higher by four to five blocks. Also, have the waterline and draft of the ship a little rework, it looks like its sinking stern first.

plane-crazy 2022-06-26 09:39:38 Should have a few stalls with fruits,
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 09:39:43 ye
creations-chat 2022-06-26 09:42:37 Hmm, I see. But the rear mast is a bit taller by one block If you look closer.
Also, the masts look really close together. Better spread them out.
creations-chat 2022-06-26 09:46:48 Yes. But you got the masts a bit close. Thats one reason it sort of looks off.
creations-chat 2022-06-26 09:48:58 Seems valid. Least you got a lot of upvotes, gotta give you credit.
plane-crazy 2022-06-26 09:50:34 Just add emojis of fruits instead of those colorful blocks. Make it as if the fruits are in barrels or crates.
general 2022-06-26 09:55:33 Quicksand better

creations-chat 2022-06-26 11:38:15 Yes he is, but the way he interacted with me was very rude and disrespectful. Ask some people who encountered him.
creations-chat 2022-06-26 11:41:07 And it aint look like the real type 21. It's a mutation.
creations-chat 2022-06-26 11:44:09 Look for his interactions with me. Scroll back up.
creations-chat 2022-06-26 11:47:31 Your Ship's a waste of time. We're looking for the looks, and deal with it with the slow mo.

creations-chat 2022-06-26 11:57:14 Also, how the hell did your "Type 21 Frigate" get LOTS of upvotes, although it doesn't resemble the real thing?
creations-chat 2022-06-26 11:59:39 I know. I upvoted it too since I thought it was custom too. He did good on the hull, but his explanation with the build looks confusing. 

He said its a Custom version of the Type 21. Least he did good work on the hull and the ship.

plane-crazy 2022-07-06 07:53:37 Here's my explanation of angle lock, got confused with all this explanation of locking or smt
creations-chat 2022-07-06 07:54:55 This runway and airport sure does remind me of the times that I travelled to Boracay for vacation... Those were the good 'ol days.
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 07:55:37 Well he can save my image, and I know he's struggling. 

Is he trying to angle lock?
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 07:56:18 Im confused whats with the "lock it" thing
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 07:58:47 I would suggest angle locking to add those panels and rivets (use text to achieve the effect)
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 08:00:33 That way, you can achieve okay results if you use angle locking.

creations-chat 2022-11-13 06:32:28 Reasons why they suck: 
- your avatar's arms are exposed 
- less detail 
- built by amateur players 
- overrated because of omnomnom_ch 

Recommendation: 2 block wide planes to add more detail... and to conceal your avatar's arms

creations-chat 2023-01-14 07:00:18 The both of you better keep on building until you can get the hang of it. 

Experience is what makes your builds look better. 

I've been playing Plane Crazy since 2019, and my builds look better because of those years of experience.
creations-chat 2023-01-14 07:07:41 It's really difficult to explain.
creations-chat 2023-01-14 07:18:55 Here's one explanation done in drawing.

Some of the motorlocks cannot be seen because its underneath the vehicle, in the hood, and in the trunk.
creations-chat 2023-01-14 07:27:20 My builds are mainly warships, trains, firearms, and cars, but rarely aircraft. 

After all, the game is called "Plane Crazy", and everyone is literally plain crazy about it.
creations-chat 2023-01-14 07:38:56 Now that's something more unique.

I'm also considering building SAM 26000 (JFK's Air Force One) since it's a less-known version of the President's Plane.

Air Force One is associated with a Boeing 747.

plane-crazy 2023-01-14 13:42:34 I made one before, but had six coaches.
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 13:44:45 I tried it and it was terrible
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 13:44:55 You have to fix it again before spawing your build
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 13:45:20 Angle locking is better
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 13:45:31 And ya need camera stoppers or motor 2's to set 'em in place.
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 13:45:35 Easy as that
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 13:46:48 I'd prefer making that thing a lot bigger

For those wondering who the President is, it's **Charles de Gaulle**. 
He swore to never ride on any other car other than the Citroën DS, and a special version was made for him, the **DS Présidentielle Chapron**, seen below.

It's a one-of-a-kind jet that you made, and the BEA livery suits it well. 

The only problem to the build are the gaps of the wings, but still, you made a great effort to build this underrated British jet.

No pressure, but **you did well**.

creations-chat 2023-01-18 03:46:12 <@1018940961310658600> I just have to say that's one helluva beautiful train you've made. Does it have any sound effects, including the whistle and foghorn?

Oh, and how rude those people who knock your train off the map.
creations-chat 2023-01-18 03:48:15 Here's the video of the SP4449 using her **Foghorn** on a level crossing. You've probably missed this interesting feature. https://youtu.be/xHW1Q8WmxPo

The reason why she also uses a foghorn is to guide her through the thick smoky fog of **San Francisco**.

It's there. It' near to the train's number board.

general 2023-01-18 06:13:54 I would always make a list of things that are worth building, then choose the object that I really want to build.

general 2023-01-18 06:17:34 And when I finish it, I check them off on the checklist.

creations-chat 2023-01-18 09:19:00 Exactly.
creations-chat 2023-01-18 09:21:15 I thought it was a spaceship because of the black circle emojis on the side of the turret. <:ElonHMM:715614569430515783> 
I would suggest using wing lights to act as the little notches used to hang spare tracks or other tools used for repair or getting the vehicle unstuck.

I can see the E-100's turret with the gun. Better add that to make it an E-100 turret. 

Impressive work 👍
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 09:25:50 That random kid was being narcissistic.

creations-chat 2023-01-23 03:25:26 Looks like I've picked the wrong week to quit making criticisms.

There's a few things missing to this Planet Express ship. 
1. The Turret
2. The Portholes and emergency escape door
3. That grill thing near the fins and engine. 

The tail colors need to be more dark and saturated 

Even better if the entire build is a bit bigger to show off those missing features.
creations-chat 2023-01-23 03:28:23 yeah, seems about right.
Not to pressure you, but the lower tailfins are angled down. 
You can make a second and "improved" version **if you want**, and it is only to see the big improvements compared from the first.

Try hiding the propeller engines from underneath the vehicle to make it less obvious that you used them to steer the RV. 
Also, it's better if you use half cylinders (or maybe Hover Thrusters) to use as the tires of the RV.

But still, pretty nice RV design.

And yet, it would be risky because the size of the vehicle is so big that the USAAF would bomb it to pieces.

plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:43:08 But that Motorized hinge idea is exactly what a Piston in game functions.

plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:44:47 I did, and I made a mistake here.
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:45:46 You basically described a Tank destroyer, where the gun is completely mounted to the hull.
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:48:34 I don't even get the function what you're saying. But I thought it to be similar to a Tank Destroyer.

creations-chat 2023-01-26 15:29:10 No it does not, sadly.
creations-chat 2023-01-26 15:42:53 I would agree that interiors are the best part of trains. It's just impossible to pull it off with all the motorlocking to achieve the windows of the coaches. Though it IS possible to do that. I'll try it on my next train build. 

Although, I have made an interior for my older train build (which can barely be seen).
general 2023-01-27 01:03:43 ok. ok.

creations-chat 2023-01-28 14:46:30 Try making the Pulkzerstörer 

I made one, and I hope yours better than mine.
creations-chat 2023-01-29 02:03:45 ~~Is this based on a British Tank Engine? Looks familiar to me.~~ 
nevermind, I already saw the basis of the locomotive.

You did a fine job. I'd recommend you to use half cylinders for the wheels and motorlock them. They look a bit too wide. 

Locomotive wheels are supposed to be thin, and add a little more brightness to the gray color, it bothers me.
creations-chat 2023-01-29 02:07:15 That Me 262 of yours looks even better than mine! Good Luck finishing it!
creations-chat 2023-01-29 02:10:50 Looking good! Time to give her a paint scheme.
creations-chat 2023-01-29 05:20:18 It's to get the right dimensions of the train wheels. They're usually thin. (Look at Blueprint)
I motorlocked half cylinders to get the right dimensions, like what I did on my Steam Locomotive.
creations-chat 2023-01-29 05:22:21 Well I was only trying to help you anyways...
creations-chat 2023-01-29 05:24:24 It all takes a little practice until you get the right stuff.

That's why he builds things so fast.

plane-crazy 2023-01-29 13:06:38 There's only one three-letter word that I'll have to say:

Also, if we happen to meet on the same public server (or private), maybe we can take pictures of our trains and make a little photoshoot of two PRR locomotives.
creations-chat 2023-02-01 01:54:24 If you want Streamlined, go for the Norfolk & Western 611, built in 1950.

creations-chat 2023-02-01 05:53:18 It better be bigger, because it actually is. 
No pressure, but it's your choice if you want to make another one or not. 
And is the Paint Scheme is based on the Blackbird?

creations-chat 2023-02-01 06:05:52 That don't look like no ordinary bomber...
It looks like it's been designed by an alcoholic crackhead
creations-chat 2023-02-01 06:10:01 By "Best", it doesn't look like a Bomber because of its fuselage shape. 
We at the Plane Crazy Discord Community have such high standards, and therefore, your jet isn't the best. 
Here is a Proper Bomber compared to yours (Martin B-57 Canberra).
general 2023-02-01 06:10:25 Same here too, we've been baited.
creations-chat 2023-02-01 06:12:11 He doesn't need to remodel it. He has to be better in building.

creations-chat 2023-02-01 16:27:25 Make the wings thicker, then make the front landing gear a bit smaller (use half cylinder 1). 
And don't forget that Canopy Frame... and the Navigation Lights to make it realistic.
creations-chat 2023-02-01 16:29:27 I see. Next time, listen to <@684812219040792628>'s advice of making the frames first.

plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:48:30 Least its like modernizing your tank
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:48:35 ooo
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:49:01 Better upgrade that T-55 into a T-90 or T-14 Armata.
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:52:14 cursed
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:52:24 why does it have the Tiger I suspension (interleaved)
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:52:36 Better make a new one.
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:53:04 Exactly
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:53:15 What's this supposed to be?
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:54:08 Mhm the jet osprey. 
The wings look fine to me.
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:54:23 I'm guessing you used half blocks for the wings
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:54:47 It's fine.
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:55:25 Its wheels made me think of the T7 Combat Car.
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:56:09 The T7 is an easy tank that new players can make
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:56:12 Really simple
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:56:21 It's okay.
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:56:31 There are really good tanks that have no tracks
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:57:06 such as my Tiger I that I built like last year.
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:57:41 At least you can make fake tracks by using signs or disconnectors, like most RoScale tanks.
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:58:51 Yes. At least it's okay to me.
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:58:58 Its a T95
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:59:21 slow as shit doom turtle tank
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:59:40 look it up, it's REALLY slow.
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 15:59:48 even your grandpa can outwalk it
general 2023-02-02 16:00:22 its hyperbit
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:00:35 At what speed is the tank?
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:00:38 like 9 sps?
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:01:08 Make it slower.
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:02:11 It's like... a few minutes to do it
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:02:24 just copy paste the settings on the left and right motors
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:02:31 thats less time consuming
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:03:06 looks easy for me, because I use copy paste
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:03:30 Try looking up actual blueprints.
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:03:34 then try it yourself
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:03:40 a little experience doesn't hurt
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:04:50 Least you have your choice not to do it.
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:05:13 if you really want to do it. Say to yourself that you CAN do it
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:05:41 Start off with an Inline Engine. The easiest to build
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:06:05 Is it an Sd.Kfz 222?
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:07:58 Yeahhh... looks like it, but I always thought that it's an Italian armored car (2nd image)
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:08:45 it shows
general 2023-02-02 16:10:35 It could be any one of us who will get it.
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:10:54 SU 85?
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:10:57 probably
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:11:12 layout
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:11:17 I agree.
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:11:22 really sucked so bad
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:11:49 SU 85 should be   W I D E R , not thinner
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:12:55 You have an opportunity to make another one and improve it. 
Just follow the blueprints until you get a good result.

plane-crazy 2023-02-03 06:28:22 yeah, but people will confuse it with a Nimitz, because CVN-69 is Dwight D. Eisenhower.

It's best if you make it CVN-78. It's your choice to make that change or **leave it be for the funni**

general 2023-02-03 08:35:37 You

general 2023-02-03 08:37:01 That's just a fantasy so okay
general 2023-02-03 08:37:40 Still single and no relationship.

general 2023-02-03 08:40:04 Are you an Archer? Because if you are, I'll be your target.
general 2023-02-03 08:40:14 I thought of that one
general 2023-02-03 08:40:24 Indeed.
general 2023-02-03 08:40:44 I'm the apple, and you scored.
general 2023-02-03 08:41:14 Okay... there goes some pretty questionable pick up lines
general 2023-02-03 08:41:39 That's mind blowingly good.
general 2023-02-03 08:42:16 Where's the Lincoln one?
general 2023-02-03 08:42:27 The Garfield, and then the William McKinley

general 2023-02-03 09:06:18 Ship's Cats are much more better.
general 2023-02-03 09:09:19 well yes
general 2023-02-03 09:09:27 they can even catch mice on board the ship
general 2023-02-03 09:09:29 and eat it
general 2023-02-03 09:09:49 and all the crew will have a massive morale boost
general 2023-02-03 09:09:56 because of the ship's cat
general 2023-02-03 09:26:41 Welcome back.
general 2023-02-03 09:26:51 I was just making the blueprints for my next build.
general 2023-02-03 09:29:40 
general 2023-02-03 09:29:57 Basically this Submarine
general 2023-02-03 09:30:20 It's a rarity to see submarines like that
general 2023-02-03 09:30:51 British, actually.
general 2023-02-03 09:30:58 That's HMS M1
general 2023-02-03 09:31:13 I'm also considering building le Surcouf.
general 2023-02-03 09:31:36 Ended up disappearing like dad.
general 2023-02-03 09:31:39 getting milk
general 2023-02-03 09:31:43 never to return again
general 2023-02-03 09:32:23 It will be.
general 2023-02-03 09:33:04 But you gotta reload its gun surfaced
general 2023-02-03 09:33:13 that's the only downside of M-Class
general 2023-02-03 09:33:19 <:nooo:787097964946259978> <:nooo:787097964946259978> <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2023-02-03 09:33:56 Least Britain learned their lesson with this goober submarine
general 2023-02-03 09:33:59 The "Kalamity Class"
general 2023-02-03 09:34:07 because its steam powered
creations-chat 2023-02-03 09:37:30 **Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992)** - Left
**Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (2022)** - Right 

The plane in the movie is basically a Boeing Stearman with an engine cowling.
general 2023-02-03 09:38:05 Last resort if the guns jam
general 2023-02-03 09:38:14 and a SEAPLANE
general 2023-02-03 09:38:28 Baby come back...
general 2023-02-03 09:38:37 SURCOUF, PLEASE COME BACK
general 2023-02-03 09:39:14 Least Surcouf is more interesting
general 2023-02-03 09:39:46 Really is
general 2023-02-03 09:39:56 You just don't know where did those damn planes came from
general 2023-02-03 09:40:54 "Hans, where did those planes come from?" 
"I don't know. I see no aircraft carrier in the distance!"

"FRITZ! Where did those 230mm shells come from?"
"I HAVE NO IDEA FRITZ! NO WARSHIP SIGHTED!"
general 2023-02-03 09:41:36 Sinking? As in submerging?
general 2023-02-03 09:41:59 Like... around an hour or so
general 2023-02-03 09:42:02 all planes
general 2023-02-03 09:42:11 u still need the catapult

general 2023-02-03 09:43:38 Shiver me timbers
creations-chat 2023-02-03 09:44:02 Try motorlocking. That will work.
I saw planes with decals on the tails and wings, and it's basically just motorlocking signs.
general 2023-02-03 09:44:44 "ALL ON THE MAIN BRIDGE, MAKE READY FOR BOARDING!"
general 2023-02-03 09:44:51 Steal their loots and resources!

like a cake without frosting
general 2023-02-03 09:46:45 Good question.
general 2023-02-03 10:05:02 Put an "N", and then make the crew a bunch of Zombies.
general 2023-02-03 10:05:11 RUSSIA

general 2023-02-03 10:37:34 got bored so I'm drawing an old man based on Christopher Walken

general 2023-02-04 15:59:45 man...
general 2023-02-04 15:59:49 what a heated argument
general 2023-02-04 16:00:27 no one gonna care about my rough sketch of a "panther" tank.
general 2023-02-04 16:00:29 its a literal rough sketch.
general 2023-02-04 16:00:45 Needs improvement.
general 2023-02-04 16:01:00 Better trace the shapes first
general 2023-02-04 16:02:02 Leave him be
general 2023-02-04 16:03:00 Leave it at that. Just the angles
general 2023-02-04 16:03:19 better find reference pictures
general 2023-02-04 16:03:24 3d models are a good source
general 2023-02-04 16:03:32 take a screenshot then trace out the shapes
general 2023-02-04 16:03:52 if u trace out the shapes lots of times, you'll begin to memorize the proportions of the object
general 2023-02-04 16:04:11 It's easy if one traces it until they get the hang of it
general 2023-02-04 16:05:45 It's drawing I'm talking about.
general 2023-02-04 16:05:55 for the beginners
general 2023-02-04 16:06:42 This is a rough sketch

general 2023-02-04 16:36:17 **Artist Protip:** Keep your drawings even though they're shit. Keep on drawing until you see BIG improvement.
Even though you want to draw to amuse yourself.
general 2023-02-04 16:37:43 Read the dictionary so you can see new words that are similar to the ones that you commonly use. 
Example: Queer = Strange/Odd.
~~or Queer = gay~~

general 2023-02-04 16:39:04 Ya even do GOUACHE
general 2023-02-04 16:39:11 which is EASIEST to do
general 2023-02-04 16:39:19 Light water load = brighter color
general 2023-02-04 16:39:34 Only in oil paintings you can
general 2023-02-04 16:39:51 I used to do them

creations-chat 2023-02-05 05:16:15 If you hear a sound in your laptop, you better clean it. Because there's dust on the ventilation, and the fan may be rusted. That can be the cause of the blue screen.

Also, remove unecessary files to save your storage space. I did that last year, and I prevented a thing like that from happening. 

I've been using a Lenovo laptop for 2 years and it's still running smooth even though it was repaired for ventilation maintenance.
creations-chat 2023-02-05 05:18:21 But do you hear like a buzzing sound on the fan? If there is, you better have your laptop repaired

This is the American T95E1 Medium Prototype Tank.
creations-chat 2023-02-06 16:23:14 But its wheel configuration and turret shape reminded me of that tank.
creations-chat 2023-02-07 00:41:39 Make the front landing gear a little bit smaller. Use half cylinders as the wheels.
creations-chat 2023-02-07 00:49:03 I think I get your point, but still, make the front wheels smaller since it looked too big for me.

That's the fifth time I've seen that dastardly Chinese spy balloon...

creations-chat 2023-02-11 08:10:50 Why does your carrier look out or proportion… 

Yep, I am ACTUALLY critiquing your build, and sadly, the way you’re doing the carrier is wrong, especially with the hull. 

For reference of a Carrier hull, take a look at this picture of the USS Gerald Ford (CV-79). 

Also, it is impossible to make RoScale carriers because lack of space. only thing to do it is to use ALT ACCOUNTS and assemble the damn thing like you’re building an actual Aircraft Carrier.

The more they make engines, they might become car mechanics or automotive engineers once they graduate College.

But there’s some people who just want it for fun.

creations-chat 2023-02-17 15:14:13 The only thing good about this subpar A-10 Warthog is the minigun effect, gotta give it to this guy to make a "functioning" minigun. 

It should spray out bullets if its in PVP mode.
creations-chat 2023-02-17 15:17:05 Well at least he used Hover Engines as the minigun barrels which is a little bit clever, and it SPINS if you look closer.
creations-chat 2023-02-17 15:20:43 Would have to agree on that bc you get moar barrels. 
<@434843195025653762> yeah... and it makes the A-10 look like it has a gun pod instead of a built-in one.

general 2023-02-18 03:47:39 then it narrows down to 1 block

general 2023-02-18 03:49:30 yeah

After all, the term Dogfight was once coined in World War I because of the sound the engine makes; because it sounded like a Dog panting.

creations-chat 2023-02-28 09:47:48 The only time I made updates to a build was K.I.T.T., in which I made some changes with the tires and headlights and added some if the tire detail.
creations-chat 2023-02-28 09:49:51 I can’t think of any, but the build quality of any WWII German Fighter Jet would vary, because the Forced Laborers would sabotage the engine parts causing them to go crashing down from the sky or burning up like a meteor entering Earth.

general 2023-03-01 07:06:43 ok bye
general 2023-03-01 07:58:01 That 1950 "muscle car" disappoints me... 
Muscle Cars appeared in the 1960s. 🤓
plane-crazy 2023-03-01 07:58:24 This is something outta Wolfenstein
creations-chat 2023-03-01 07:59:51 <@742233126746587136> The term "Muscle Car" came out in 1966. Muscle Cars are typically 1960's - 1970's vehicles such as the Ford Mustang, Dodge Challenger, Pontiac GTO, and to name a few.

Naming a vehicle from the 1950's a "Muscle Car" is very anachronistic. It's best if you just call it a "Sports Coupe".

Nice INS Vikramaditya aircraft carrier! though I would like to give out a few words about your Aircraft Carrier. 

**1.)** I would recommend you to try and use **Angle Locking** on the Aircraft Carrier's ramp deck. This will make it more smoother instead of making the ramp look completely rough and bumpy. You wouldn't want to have your aircraft take off disastrously with a bumpy ramp.

**2.** Try to add those **antenna or wire things** seen on the sides of the carrier and on the ship's superstructure by using Wing Trails (i don't know what those antenna things are called).

**3.)** The ships **yellow lines and markings** are sometimes **broken lines**, so try to fix this to make your aircraft carrier more accurate to the real thing. The Helipads are not present on the landing strip of the carrier. You may add them if you wish (though I guess you're running out of space on your plot). 

**4.)** You are missing out the **AA Defenses and the rest of the radar systems** that are present on the ship. Look into the blueprints or 3d models of the Vessel so you can find the other missing details on your ship (like I mentioned earlier, you're probably running out of plot space to fit the whole ship). 

In conclusion, your Aircraft Carrier is great, though there are a few components missing on the final build. I know you might not make changes because you have no more space to place them. I wish that you'll follow my recommendations so you can improve your excellent aircraft carrier. 

 <@733471655392968906> I'm making a constructive criticism, sheesh...

I usually do that when I build Airships.

creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:43:01 Downvote means that something is very wrong with your creation, and try to motivate yourself into building better. 

Plenty of people slander and berate other people due to their quality of building, so you better build better if you don't want to get beat down.

You're behaving like YouTube and their stupid decision to remove the number of dislikes on the dislike button. Just build better, so you won't get downvoted. It's the only way, literally.

plane-crazy 2023-03-19 08:36:57 Well done. Start building the main guns now.

Though I have some words with your rendition on the Richelieu overall. It sort of looks *cartoonish* with a larger tower superstructure, and the way you did it makes me want to think of the Star Destroyers from Star Wars Rebels (ISD’s have shorter “necks” in live action). 

Also, the stern looks completely weird with how you built it. 

I hope you’ll build better ships in the future like me. But still, you did good in trying to make a Battleship.

general 2023-04-20 16:30:20 fun fact: there was gonna be a third one built to target LONDON via Calais, France.
general 2023-04-20 16:31:03 The caliber was lowered to 52cm (instead of 80cm) and had a longer barrel.
general 2023-04-20 16:31:38 The gun was named “Langer Gustav” (Longer Gustav) due to its barrel length.
general 2023-04-20 16:32:38 If built, its potential targets would be Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament (plus Big Ben), Westminster Abbey, 10 Downing Street, and St. Paul’s Cathedral.
general 2023-04-20 16:33:15 nope. her parts were already manufactured, but the gun was never assembled.

Your **CH-53E Super Stallion** is okay, though there are some problems that I would like to point out that make this build a bit not good. 

The **helicopter blades** are sort of messy in terms of the way you built it, but it gets better if you find a different way in constructing Heli blades. 

The **colors** are a bit too dark, so I would highly recommend you to make the gray tones brighter… UNLESS if it’s a specific paint scheme that has the colors on the final product. 

Try to have the **landing gear** retract like in the real thing. 

You’re even missing some **windows** on the sides of the Helicopter. Not only that but lots of the **details** are missing as well…

…and the Helicopter is **out of shape** when you view it from the sides. 

Overall, you did… ***okay-ish*** <:YouTried:559530066258821131> on the Super Stallion, and I hope you’ll learn new techniques in building things. 

*Sincerely yours,*

creations-chat 2023-05-09 06:22:13 Hello <@794418633577070615>. 

There are many reasons as to why your rendition of the German Battlecruiser (or Battleship) Scharnhorst is literally crap and I'll be brutally honest to give you the many reasons why. 

First off is the entire hull of the ship itself. The shape of Scharnhorst's hull is quite *curvy*', not boxy like what you did. On some of my Battleships that I made, I would always make my hulls curved to stay true to the Blueprints. What you did was pretty much outdated and incompetent. It almost felt like a *Tutorial Scharnhorst*. 

You did fine with the Main Guns of the Battleship, though there are some details missing. I didn't like the way you did the Secondary Turrets of the Battleship because they are sort of thick in my perspective, whereas in the real ship, the secondary guns are quite small due to their caliber size. 

You didn't finish the camo scheme which is the *Baltic Camouflage* Paint Scheme. Also, the way you did Scharnhorst's Paint Scheme is completely ***TERRIBLE***. 

You're missing a LOT of components that were present on the Scharnhorst, a **LOT** of them. 

Those are some of the reasons why your Scharnhorst is ***UTTER CRAP***. 

Overall, there are so many things missing from your rendition of the Battleship Scharnhorst. You didn't put any time and effort in building a warship. I would highly encourage you to ***IMPROVE YOUR BUILDING SKILLS*** to make things better. 

*Sincerely yours,*
*the_mechanic2001*
*Plane Crazy player and Build Connoisseur*

Your build is quite rushed. Patience is what makes good builds.

creations-chat 2023-05-14 03:43:41 <@831675577828245555> Hello DevenTIE. 

I really appreciate your custom English Estate, though it does not feel 18th Century to me. I am quite impressed and unimpressed with the entire build to be honest. I’ll point out some problems on why I am quite disappointed with the build. 

First off. It doesn’t feel 18th Century. The 18th Century are the years 1700 to 1799. Your architectural style is too far off from that of the period. The White House even is an 18th Century building, so you better take inspiration from that or any buildings built in the 1700’s (18th Century). 

Second of all, the windows felt like you have built a custom jailhouse rather than an estate. The colors too are quite Jailhouse-ish, so it kinda felt that way. 

Overall, I really like the effort you did on your “18th Century British Estate”, but I advise you to look up the architectural style of the period and get the proportions right in some areas. 

*Sincerely,*
*the_mechanic2001*
*Plane Crazy Player and Build Connoisseur*

Below here are images of 18th Century English Estates.

creations-chat 2023-05-14 07:18:23 <@981570974568837160> Jesse L. Brown’s death saddened me. They weren’t able to save him due to the lack of materials, short time, and horrid weather conditions. 

His friend, Thomas J. Hudner Jr. tried to save him, but failed. He tried again many years later, but wasn’t able to due to bad weather. Now that Hudner had passed away, he’s able to see his Wingman in the afterlife. 

It would have been more appropriate to have the plane be destroyed into pieces, since the US Navy don’t want the wreck to be captured by the enemy; and also gave Brown a “Viking Funeral”.

Also, there’s two planes on the wreck site.

general 2023-05-16 10:53:33 on gog
general 2023-05-16 10:54:20 I see. It probably might happen, but to me the diorama reminds me of those Riots in L.A.. that happened over 21 years ago.

general 2023-05-16 10:55:20 not good

general 2023-05-16 10:56:20 yeah.
general 2023-05-16 10:56:23 that caused it
general 2023-05-16 10:56:39 Just like what happened in GTA San Andreas
general 2023-05-16 10:57:32 You mean GTA San Andreas?
general 2023-05-16 10:58:11 San Andreas was released in 2004. 12 years after the 1992 Riots.
general 2023-05-16 10:58:31 Vice City took place in the 80's and is like a parody or based on Scarface.
general 2023-05-16 10:59:05 More realistic.
general 2023-05-16 10:59:28 You said the diorama is based on a fictional Civil War.
general 2023-05-16 10:59:39 Artillery was used in the first US Civil War in the 1860's.
general 2023-05-16 10:59:48 So add it to make it really look like a civil war.
general 2023-05-16 11:00:12 Oh, okay.
general 2023-05-16 11:01:03 All the buildings are just burned, broken into, and there are wrecked cars and debris everywhere if it's based on the '92 L.A. Riots (GTA San Andreas).
general 2023-05-16 11:01:52 Make them burned
general 2023-05-16 11:03:55 Remove them, and replace them with boxes, oil drums, and crates.
general 2023-05-16 11:04:33 Oh, and I advise you to name your creation "The Los Santos Riots".
general 2023-05-16 11:05:06 Yeah. The 1992 L.A. Riots was the basis for GTA San Andreas.
general 2023-05-16 11:06:31 turn it into fresh meat
general 2023-05-16 11:07:33 Guess don't base it on the L.A. Riots. It's just me saying that it felt like it.

creations-chat 2023-06-21 09:37:41 Hello <@1074832981488836748>  

   I am pretty much appreciative with the effort you made with your custom warship. 

Although I can see the resemblance between that thing and an Admiral Hipper Class Cruiser in which you didn’t specify, I’ll give you a little word of advice when making Cruisers. 

The hull looks a bit too narrow for a cruiser, and it looked really silly to be one. I would advise you to make the hull more wider to make it more appropriate for a cruiser hull. 

I know you’ll run out of space if you try to widen the cruiser, and I appreciate the ffort you did in making a good-looking Warship. 

Sincerely Yours 
the_mechanic2001

Have fun building, and hope to see some improvements in your builds.
