plane-crazy 2018-11-11 16:46:07 After this update, my airship can not get around, I've tried everything.
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 16:46:43 can anybody help me?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 16:46:53 No
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 16:47:08 No
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 16:47:57 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 16:48:40 the guns shoot, the motor spin, the turbines also
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 16:50:04 Ok, thx
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 17:02:00 I saw a person who did a tank track that actually worked, he made a tank look like a KV-2
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 17:02:23 Do you know how to track?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 18:17:56 Can I make a suggestion here?
bug-reports 2018-11-12 18:17:36 The missiles are not working, even as I enter and exit the game. (I'm not using anchor block)
bug-reports 2018-11-12 18:22:40 seconds ago me and many people were launching missiles
bug-reports 2018-11-12 18:23:08 This in the area of construction
bug-reports 2018-11-12 18:25:02 Hm, ok
bug-reports 2018-11-12 18:25:19 Thx
creations-chat 2018-11-12 21:35:20 My heavy tank with functional track and tower
creations-chat 2018-11-26 15:05:01 My aircraft carrier
creations-chat 2018-11-26 15:06:22 I can control the plane and the aircraft carrier at the same time.
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 15:19:35 I've seen some larger boats than the building areas, how do I do that?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 15:22:41 <@456226577798135808> Thx, I think that's it
creations-chat 2018-11-26 15:35:06 wait until the end of the day, I'll make a bigger
creations-chat 2018-11-26 15:38:06 Or I'll finish until tomorrow.
creations-chat 2018-11-27 21:30:52 
creations-chat 2018-11-27 21:31:05 As I promised, I made a huge aircraft carrier
creations-chat 2018-11-27 21:31:44 
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:02:49 Even with the option "paint all" unchecked, it paints the entire construction
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:16:33 When I uncheck the option to "paint all" it still paints everything, and when I saved the thing, the save was extremely huge
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:16:58 Noo
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:17:22 When I changed color, I passed the limit of saved
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:18:13 was at 247K, when I changed color and salver went to over 300k
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:18:29 Ops 257*
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:20:31 I went back into the game and look, it's back to normal, but when I change color and save happens these two errors
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:22:20 I'm not lying, if you want I'll send the prints showing the computer time
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:27:21 And every time I save different colors, the value used goes up
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:29:40 Yes
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:32:08 Ok
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:36:29 An interesting thing that I discovered, when you save with black the save gets smaller (because black is the absence of colors), when I save with white the save gets as large as possible (all colors junction). In case when I save with a color and then save with it again, the save is the same size, each color has a save size
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:39:07 Do you want me to delete something I did?
bug-reports 2018-12-02 05:41:10 ok
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:22:36 repair the painting bug as quickly as possible, I want to play :c
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:27:38 <@!217336009455566848>  I explained above how the bug works, was talking to James
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:31:17 So would it be possible for you to increase the save? For it took me five days to do a construction and I calculated according to what is available
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:36:36 I deactivated the RGB, however the color that appears is totally different from what I had saved and this is very bad
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:38:43 So this problem is no solution, is it to be so?
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:44:20 I understand that part, but that means there is no solution to that, right?
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:47:06 I suggested increasing the available space to save, but James said that it was not possible
bug-reports 2018-12-02 14:51:03 Ah :/
creations-chat 2018-12-02 15:42:34 I did not want to do this, but I'll have to exclude that aircraft carrier. R.I.P :c
creations-chat 2018-12-02 15:44:30 one more photo on the sea so I can say goodbye :,c
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 15:47:48 I do not want to delete a build I took days doing, but I'm being forced to be able to save another aaaa
bug-reports 2018-12-02 16:04:05 I managed to circumvent the problem temporarily, I painted my other constructions with the black color without the RGB, then I was putting colors above the one I wanted, until a color appeared that I liked (even with the RGB option being false). Thank you for your support
bug-reports 2018-12-02 16:04:30 If you have someone with the same problem, you can suggest this
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 18:08:58 I made a German L30 with a horizontal expansion mechanism (which I invented)
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 18:09:57 150 blocks in length
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 18:10:29 If I had a gyro, it would have saved me two days of my life, but it was fun.
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 18:11:53 the mechanism is this
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 18:12:12 
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 18:13:20 <@!264769733021270016> I sent the GIF how it works
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 18:14:22 wait
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 18:55:59 Can I earn some rank with that airship?
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 19:09:24 nvm :v
general 2020-04-14 19:46:24 I wanted to make a suggestion but I can't, could someone help me?
general 2020-04-14 19:48:34 I wanted to make a suggestion but I can't, could someone help me?
general 2020-04-14 19:48:51 Hmm
general 2020-04-14 19:49:45 Could you make this suggestion to me: "Option to decrease the graphic quality of the water, it would be static blue"
general 2020-04-14 19:50:09 Okay
general 2020-04-14 19:54:47 <@!430739561690431489> The game's graphics are at a minimum and I don't see that option you said, the water is rippling
general 2020-04-14 19:56:54 Is there a video on youtube explaining this method?<@!221496030355521536>
general 2020-04-14 19:57:38 Because my PC doesn't work well, it doesn't have a video card
general 2020-04-14 19:59:16 <@!430739561690431489> Okay, but the graphics are at least there too
general 2020-04-14 20:00:24 Generally, I build things that have more than 7k blocks, but hangs a lot even on the minimal graphics
bot-central 2020-04-14 20:01:26 &suggest
general 2020-04-14 20:05:11 <@!505835349889777685> Want to see my park at Theme Park Tycoon 2?
general 2020-04-14 20:06:57 Add gamesabiobr
general 2020-04-14 20:08:21 Okay
general 2020-04-14 20:09:08 Ok
general 2020-04-14 20:10:02 full
general 2020-04-14 20:12:30 <@!505835349889777685> full server
general 2020-04-14 20:37:21 LOL
bug-reports 2020-04-17 05:16:24 Every time I try something that has a piston with "lock" it appears on my screen and I am thrown off the server.
general 2020-04-17 05:34:44 Every time I try something that has a piston with "lock" it appears on my screen and I am thrown off the server. Does anyone know how to explain why this happens and if it is possible to solve it?
general 2020-04-17 05:47:34 <@!321489477367496704> This says: You were kicked out for unexpected client behavior
general 2020-04-17 05:48:33 Yes, and this only happens when I lock the piston
general 2020-04-17 05:49:23 <@!321489477367496704> 12-15
general 2020-04-17 05:50:20 But in other larger buildings where the ping reaches 2-5 this error does not appear
general 2020-04-29 18:34:53 <@!332615504315416586>
bug-reports 2020-07-21 14:34:21 When I build a missile on a simple base it works quickly, but when I place the same base on my 5k block submarine, it works extremely slow. It is as if the mass of the submarine was part of the projectile, I believe it could be some kind of bug.

Note: The FPS in both cases is the same
bug-reports 2020-07-21 15:07:10 But i have same FPS 60-40
bug-reports 2020-07-21 15:43:16 I understand, so this will never be solved?
