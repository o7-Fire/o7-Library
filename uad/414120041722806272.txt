general 2020-01-08 20:30:50 where do i get fireworks
general 2020-01-08 20:31:25 gas pumps are wverywhere and at tthe docks is snow machine
general 2020-01-08 20:32:14 yes for me it was snow machine
general 2020-01-08 20:33:30 sparkler?
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 20:54:02 it flies heavy but it has damage potential
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 20:55:25 tbh people dont know how to aim when i use it
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 20:55:42 and adding proppelors can make it dfaster
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 20:56:04 its entirely propellor controlled
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 20:59:23 rocket lock on player so they cant hit propellors likely and it can fly with few blades missing just fine
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 20:59:55 as long as it stabilizes itself its fine
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 21:00:43 servers will enjoy its unfinishing
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 21:01:47 propellors create cover for motors
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 21:02:24 i can cover the motors and it wont affect its flight
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 21:03:34 ive seen plenty of tanks and less experienced players like faster planes which means its them making it complicated for themselves
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 21:04:05 using motors is easy
plane-crazy 2020-01-08 21:04:55 idk i just added wepaons on a stunt drone i made
