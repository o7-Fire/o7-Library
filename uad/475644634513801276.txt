creations-chat 2019-09-23 23:14:29 thats because im used to building small things, not big ones
creations-chat 2019-09-23 23:14:44 and ranking is based around part-count
creations-chat 2019-09-23 23:15:03 which is odd

First time using motorlocks
creations-chat 2021-08-01 21:54:41 Here's the internals, packs all 12 rockets and all 10 guns because it's somewhat intended for pvp
creations-chat 2021-08-01 21:58:31 The mantlet is pretty scuffed because the rockets had to be fit there and hidden
creations-chat 2021-08-01 22:08:27 does this look better?
creations-chat 2021-08-01 22:14:55 Rockets reload in a different position, which is kinda annoying
bug-reports 2021-08-01 22:16:59 Rockets reload misaligned

help 2021-08-01 22:37:31 alternatively, copy-paste image of french fry into image editor, pick color, view rgb of color in color picker
help 2021-08-01 22:39:42 just did that, and i got 247, 191, 61
creations-chat 2021-08-02 00:01:50 kinda pathetic how being a white name means instant downvotes
creations-chat 2021-08-02 00:06:32 add the door, rotor, and rest of engine
creations-chat 2021-08-02 00:25:34 though worse builds can get more votes somehow
creations-chat 2021-08-02 00:31:19 i suppose it's the bigger=better philosophy at work
creations-chat 2021-08-02 01:17:53 this is pathetic
creations-chat 2021-08-02 01:23:33 someone else asked
creations-chat 2021-08-02 01:25:35 you know how a picture is worth a thousand words?

this is exactly that
creations-chat 2021-08-02 01:34:50 how mobile it be
creations-chat 2021-08-02 01:38:25 sounds like it'll get killed by shredder bugs

wait nvm, tnt armor
help 2021-08-02 15:15:54 Is there a way to rotate parts fused by motorlock
general 2021-08-02 15:25:00 Ppl just downvote white names that don't have top tier quality and upvote any non-white name builds even if they lack detail
general 2021-08-02 15:25:30 it can occur in select situations at the very least
general 2021-08-02 15:25:37 not a hard and fast rule, but a general tendency
general 2021-08-02 15:26:46 some things are upvoted because they're funny, but others are just bad and get upvoted anyway
general 2021-08-02 15:30:49 i think it is fair to say that https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/871532118403088386 lacks detail yet has an overwhelming majority of upvotes
general 2021-08-02 15:32:13 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/871756982665748540 has a similar level of detail and similar scale, but gets downvoted because of the white name
general 2021-08-02 15:34:16 isn't the shipwreck build bad too?
general 2021-08-02 15:39:44 i'm not saying that build was good, i'm saying the build I compared it to is similarly bad
general 2021-08-02 15:43:24 how'd you motorlock that cylinder at the end?
general 2021-08-02 15:43:28 curious
general 2021-08-02 15:44:26 does it use servos or what else to rotate the wedges?
general 2021-08-02 15:44:54 wait, you can rotate motorlocks
general 2021-08-02 15:46:21 for the record, I never said good builds by white names get downvoted. I said bad builds by non-white names get upvoted
general 2021-08-02 15:46:57 i agree with the ranks of my builds
general 2021-08-02 15:48:17 already verified
general 2021-08-02 15:49:12 oh weird
bot-central 2021-08-02 15:49:26 -verify Nubliux
general 2021-08-02 15:50:47 i think it's because i once was in this server like two years ago to post my trash builds and left
general 2021-08-02 15:51:01 and the rank sticked around
help 2021-08-02 15:56:38 actually, there is a way, as demonstrated by quite a few builds, just curious how it's done
general 2021-08-02 15:56:55 ouch

plane-crazy 2021-08-03 21:24:18 ...
