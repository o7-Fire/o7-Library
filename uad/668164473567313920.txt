the-dump 2021-01-21 22:46:04 bruh that's not even a main battle tank
the-dump 2021-01-21 22:46:57 only 30mm of armor and yes i now that's an armored vehicle
the-dump 2021-01-21 22:49:41 also
most things that are required to be considered a tank are:
more than 250mm of armor on the turret
a cannon larger than 30mm and at least 230mm of penetration
the-dump 2021-01-21 22:50:27 i am trying to say what most modern tanks have
the-dump 2021-01-21 22:50:55 as the age of the tank is older there is usually less nominal armor thickness
the-dump 2021-01-21 22:51:31 alright, i get your point
the-dump 2021-01-21 22:52:12 true.
the-dump 2021-01-21 22:52:39 alright, i get your point
bug-reports 2021-01-22 02:03:32 turn down the torque and see if they act like that

general 2021-01-22 19:38:57 mariokart 7 exploiters really are bad at hitting me lol
general 2021-01-22 19:40:16 i encountered some exploiter in mariokart 7 and he barely hit me because #mariokart3dsdriftphysicsftw and i used snake drifting to avoid him
general 2021-01-22 19:40:56 mans had no skill against snake drifting
general 2021-01-22 21:03:38 refresh the page it might help
general 2021-01-22 21:05:17 it isn’t opera it’s fucking microsoft edge

the-dump 2021-01-25 18:36:40 if y’all were to post this shit in another roblox server i am in you’d get banned

the-dump 2021-01-25 18:37:15 not gonna get banned

the-dump 2021-01-25 18:39:27 mario disapproves of this
the-dump 2021-01-25 18:40:28 yoshi is literally a furry if you think about it
the-dump 2021-01-25 18:42:04 is rule one a joke in this channel or is it just me?

plane-crazy 2021-01-26 19:58:40 true
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 19:59:25 the tracks cause a lot of strain on roblox physics, causing a bit of lag on the way they preform

plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:27:55 they're utter shit at tailgunning
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:28:16 while i actually know how to hit a moving target by looking at my **tracers**
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:29:23 they break a player's serverside position
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:30:16 no that's just outdated scripts usually
the guns can break serverside positions

plane-crazy 2021-02-08 21:58:44 do you think it is possible to
1: make a working t-72 style autoloader with tnt as ammunition
2: make it more compact
3: put it in a tank
4: have the autoloading system rotate with the turret
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 21:59:36 agreed

plane-crazy 2021-02-10 22:53:31 funny thing was mariokart told me that connection with my controller was interrupted as soon as i looked at that
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 23:13:55 **laughs in covering a build with 5 layers of cameras**
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 23:14:43 **laughs even harder in covering build in tnt**
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 23:15:33 tnt is anti bullet
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 23:17:01 so if you cover a goddamn build in a layer of tnt you're basically unkillable unless there's a firework spammer or any other explosive
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 23:17:53 i know
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 23:18:04 any explosive can destroy tnt
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 23:18:17 however tnt blocks gunshots
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 23:18:22 they can

plane-crazy 2021-03-05 07:43:55 shredders are no more
the-dump 2021-03-05 07:47:43 can we all agree on the fact that the world of tanks kv-2 is overpowered while the kv-2 in war thunder is a glass cannon that betrays you so fucking hard if you miss a single shot
the-dump 2021-03-05 07:51:25 the 48 second reload with the war thunder kv-2 kinda just makes it useless in battle, as usually the time it takes to engage in a 1v1 in war thunder is around 27 seconds

bug-reports 2021-03-05 23:03:29 medium pvp bug involving guns
despite a fix coming out fixing the issue with pvp, the guns can sometimes glitch out any build that is hit by it, this only happens when the amount of gun hits you've delivered to a single target are more than 75-100 hits, the effects of this bug do not effect the person being hit, it only affects the person who delivered the shots
the effect of this bug is that a majority of a build (not the whole thing) would freeze midair for the player delivering the hits, the other person who got that amount of hits still remains unaffected.
i believe that guns are possibly client sided and will tend to bug out when trying to make the hit register for both the server and the client, which may be the issue
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 05:12:53 thats why i made my propeller blades for my single rotor long as fuck

plane-crazy 2021-03-12 04:35:52 yeah but it'd require a complex motorlock
the-dump 2021-03-12 18:39:45 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-03-12 18:44:22 a good way to dismantle a shredder is to use a gatling gun with 5 speed on the motor
plane-crazy 2021-03-12 18:44:33 makes it so that you don't have to aim so fucking hard
plane-crazy 2021-03-12 18:44:48 and you just let the spread do the job

plane-crazy 2021-08-08 01:39:33 also make them explode on contact
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 01:39:41 and not manually activated
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 01:39:56 are they explode on contact?
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 01:40:16 put ignore self and explode on contact on
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 01:41:11 ignore self makes it impossible for them to blow up if they touch any parts placed by you

the-dump 2021-10-31 19:57:24 i've made a dollar store missile in bad piggies once
hard as fuck to hit things
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 18:40:02 dont let any more in
nor let anyone else become a furry
its a pain once you become one
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 18:40:50 hate to say it but half of the furry community is very sensitive to the smallest things
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 18:40:51 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 18:42:20 furries are like that sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 18:43:17 they're just oversensitive

go back or go outside
the-dump 2021-11-11 19:39:04 either works
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 19:24:46 killl!!!!
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:59:39 so uh in plane crazy it feels like explode on impact has a horrible delay and bounces off the ground before exploding in certain situations
any way to make it so that i dont hit my targets because of the bounce
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:59:53 i know
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 23:01:14 any way to counter the latency
such as like
a way to get the bombs to bounce less or stick to the ground in one way or another
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 23:43:27 looks like my first build that i eventually repurposed into an attacker/bomber but way shorter and underwinged
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 23:45:27 my first build with like
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 23:45:40 more than 50 2x1 wing blocks
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 23:45:47 and a large ass fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 23:46:04 you need a LOT of engines for it to even take off
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 23:48:47 now i use it for anti-shredder because i put a rotating gun with a bunch of spread, rockets, a vertical trim system for when im tailgunning and rudder with a motor on the bottom of it so i can make very sharp turns
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 23:48:59 you cant anymore
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 23:49:03 explode on impact has a delay
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 23:49:19 so it explodes in the air because it bounces off the ground
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 23:51:11 i made an attempt to make a guided missile with the controls of a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 23:51:32 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 23:51:37 explodes instead of shreds
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 23:52:17 and i actually made a mini guided missile that **can** kill things
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 23:56:25 video of it
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 23:57:16 also the vehicle was made in less than 20 minutes so it looks quite shit
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:08:37 stop
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:09:22 please no
the-dump 2021-11-24 02:07:15 thank you for reminding me to beat the shit out of myself

plane-crazy 2021-11-24 02:17:31 plane crazy in a nutshell when you take out more than half of an aircraft
tis but a scratch
the-dump 2021-11-25 02:50:54 they cant stop it
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 22:13:53 if its without motor lock it looks decent
if with motor lock then make it sink into the fuselage a little more
plane-crazy 2021-12-10 03:59:14 i've built like one good looking build and thats about it
plane-crazy 2021-12-10 03:59:31 rest of my builds look shit but perform quite well
plane-crazy 2021-12-10 04:00:36 also i have the stupid and i do not know how to motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 06:24:51 what would be more annoying
shredderbug classic
shredderbug movement system with the shredder being replaced by a gatling gun
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 06:25:52 same

the-dump 2021-12-12 22:08:06 why does it
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 22:21:12 i have one build that looks good and somehow it isn’t even motorlocked
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 22:22:30 im not on my pc at the moment so i dont have the images for it 💀
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 22:24:56 mirror mode would be hard to make
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 22:26:16 it would be better to have a way to select a bunch of blocks and then place the center of them on the other side
the-dump 2021-12-12 23:55:17 it actually looks rushed ngl

the-dump 2021-12-13 02:03:10 but i do hate anime

the-dump 2021-12-13 02:04:08 true
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:05:04 honestly i dont truly support furries nor hate them and dont want it to get any larger
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:09:35 seems like a you issue
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:09:50 talking about the server or the actual game
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:10:25 theres less furries in the actual game so you may enjoy it more in the actual game
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:11:41 you cant really leave the furry community once you join it
so please dont let any more people join it and become part of the dumbass club
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:12:42 furries tend to be biased toward eachother
its annoying at somepoint
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:13:03 im not biased toward the community
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:13:31 this server?
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:14:37 i wont leave the server
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:15:31 your harassing doesn’t have an affect on my lifestyle

its more accurate
the-dump 2021-12-13 02:49:04 the nono
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:50:18 the way you kill shredder bugs and shredder balls is by using a gatling gun
more spread and makes things that move quickly in all directions easier to hit
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:50:56 i have used it against shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:51:03 it does actually work if done right
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:52:02 this also works but my only build capable of doing this is hard to aim with
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:52:14 i literally cant aim infact
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:52:19 its button operated
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:52:47 and it is small af and impossible to hit
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:52:55 its a decent tradeoff
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:54:47 i actually made one of the smallest aircraft (no motorlock) capable of quickly changing directions and having a top speed of 560 sps
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:55:39 its ugly af but it is impossible to hit if i use it right
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:56:24 its performance based only
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:58:47 the entire plane is somewhere between 30-50 objects
i used 5-8 blocks for the fuselahe
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 03:59:06 rest is engines and wings
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:01:16 my building skills are shit
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:01:49 best i could do was a tank
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:04:32 with a bunch of attention to detail stuff
e.g interior, it blows up, gun that has a missile as a shell (its mounted behind the gun and is supposed to be where you load the shell) and even a gunner sight and seat
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:05:08 i know
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:05:38 its the most shitty thing
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:05:44 about this server
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:05:49 it looks ok
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:06:00 the tank doesnt look perfect
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:06:35 its more so of a concept based off of the t-44 with a
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:07:04 longer cannon
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:07:54 i might motorlock missiles together if i learn to motorlock so i can cause more than a single block of damage
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:29:32 lies
usually 250+
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:30:19 my shitbox mini-plane can outrun a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:30:34 its just above 560 sps
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:31:54 glitch drive?
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:33:33 my mini-plane is glass because of its size
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:34:53 once every 3 servers
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:35:52 my large attacker/bomber is shredder bait
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:36:02 they go after large shit
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:36:29 same
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:36:57 thing is i have a gatling gun for a tailgun
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:37:25 and its easy to hit them even if they’re all over the place
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:38:29 shredders ruined the game
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:38:52 true
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:40:24 i know how to make it less likely to get attacked by a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:40:34 M O T O R
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:41:59 ground shredders are the less annoying variant of shredders bugs
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:42:18 no
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:42:49 cutters on a motor 2 on wheels
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:43:02 is a ground shredder
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:43:34 it makes decent shredder traps
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 04:44:18 because they dont have the braincells to know its a trap

the-dump 2021-12-13 06:48:44 is it possible to make a good looking build without motorlock
the-dump 2021-12-13 06:49:27 while its still reasonably small enough to not be more than 1 plot in width or length
the-dump 2021-12-13 06:50:04 not talking about pixel art
actual builds
the-dump 2021-12-13 06:50:43 i also did that because i’m a lazy ass
the-dump 2021-12-13 06:51:22 i made a tank with 0 motorlock and for me it looks ok
the-dump 2021-12-13 06:52:00 i dont have ref pics because im not able to get on my pc rn

the-dump 2021-12-13 07:02:15 i sometimes do it to rickroll shredder bugs

the-dump 2021-12-13 07:09:54 ok so basically
would motorlocking a shit ton of rockets into a single spot do any more damage than a single one

the-dump 2021-12-13 07:25:44 how would it work?
does the explosive range pile up
the-dump 2021-12-13 07:26:37 yeah
the-dump 2021-12-13 07:27:48 im going to assume there’s a slight delay between each rocket exploding/launching which would chip away more material for each explosion

the-dump 2021-12-13 07:29:15 https://tenor.com/view/not-funny-gif-23034477
the-dump 2021-12-13 07:30:05 as a furry i can relate
the-dump 2021-12-13 07:31:55 also how did the rockets change in the new update
the-dump 2021-12-13 07:32:04 i heard they now track differently
the-dump 2021-12-13 07:32:45 trolled
the-dump 2021-12-13 07:32:48 you tried
the-dump 2021-12-13 07:34:14 but really, how did rocket tracking change
the-dump 2021-12-13 07:34:47 i think they track more smoothly?
the-dump 2021-12-13 07:35:50 im not even saying anything that would ruin the community 💀
the-dump 2021-12-13 07:36:33 im asking how the rocket tracking changed in the new pc update
the-dump 2021-12-13 07:37:32 i know how badly rockets tracked before thebupdate
the-dump 2021-12-13 07:37:53 didnt even play the video
the-dump 2021-12-13 07:38:23 the update i assume made missile tracking not bullshit
the-dump 2021-12-13 07:39:26 have you ever heard of a thing called “coping”

the-dump 2022-01-04 18:31:26 and said attack aircraft is literally a fucking brick
the-dump 2022-01-04 18:31:54 in terms of shredder bait
the-dump 2022-01-04 18:32:05 its worthy of shredder bait
the-dump 2022-01-04 18:32:25 and it can somewhat be half-effective against shredders

general 2022-01-04 21:11:08 what
general 2022-01-04 21:11:33 sir
general 2022-01-04 21:11:46 you cant make something fly without wings or control panels
general 2022-01-04 21:12:00 unless you make something that only flies straight up
general 2022-01-04 21:12:23 ~~which is still impossible due to tiny issues with weight distribution~~
general 2022-01-04 21:13:00 <@!579410525595893770> you got the gravity slider gamepass?
general 2022-01-04 21:13:52 then no
general 2022-01-04 21:13:57 you need wings and control panels
general 2022-01-04 21:14:11 just put them inside of your build so they're hidden <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-01-04 21:15:27 i think he's trying to do it without anything that is considered a wing
general 2022-01-04 21:16:21 <@!579410525595893770> do this
also show me the build in dms
general 2022-01-05 07:24:53 you’re fucked my man

general 2022-01-05 07:25:24 👍
general 2022-01-05 07:26:08 red in sights=no penetration at that area
general 2022-01-05 07:27:11 fuck yall i use luchs
solves all issues
general 2022-01-05 07:27:44 speaking of the luchs
anyone remember when the luchs was still buyable
general 2022-01-05 07:28:31 luchs doesnt need to ram
general 2022-01-05 07:29:11 it has autocannon+*ok armor*+tiny
general 2022-01-05 07:30:02 although i dont play wotb anymore
general 2022-01-05 07:30:17 i still remember the older game
general 2022-01-05 07:30:32 snep=snow leopard
general 2022-01-05 07:31:29 from what i know when i last played
YE FUCKING P
general 2022-01-05 07:31:38 impossible
general 2022-01-05 07:33:06 not THAT realistic
if you hit it right shrapnel irl can slap the gunners in the face
general 2022-01-05 07:34:04 joke: luchs is secretly a tier x
general 2022-01-05 07:35:03 you mean the fact that penetration at shooting the same area is inconsistent?
general 2022-01-05 07:36:42 i remember killing somewhere around 3-4 tanks with a luchs max
you’re damn good at the game if you did 8 with an underpowered tank
general 2022-01-05 07:38:58 hetzers are like the slightly less annoying at 2 user
general 2022-01-05 07:39:46 the tactics are essentially the same but with the hetzer you can take higher ground
general 2022-01-05 07:40:39 looks like it
general 2022-01-05 07:42:38 isn’t the t95 like a resized hetzer but the gun takes up half of the front now?
general 2022-01-05 07:44:03 former hetzer user speaking
it does have pen without heat
you just gotta hit your shot properly
general 2022-01-05 07:45:08 proper tatic with hetzer is to take the high ground
general 2022-01-05 07:45:37 i haven’t even touched wotb in 2 years
general 2022-01-05 07:45:50 and haven’t actually played it in 4

general 2022-01-05 07:47:10 you drive an ms-1, kill a t-28 for some reason, then kill a fuckin panzer or something with it

plane-crazy 2022-01-06 05:22:23 tnt armor is mostly used so that when they get damaged the body doesn’t split apart so damn easily

plane-crazy 2022-01-14 05:13:27 your shredder is more so a speed showoff then it is an actual shredder
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 05:14:21 try hitting a 10x10 (or lower in area) aircraft with it at near top speed
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 05:16:02 going above 1200 sps is useless in the first place because you go across the entire damn map in less than 15 seconds
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 05:17:21 and theres a reason why shredders are called shredders
they are called that because they use cutters to shred builds
not to shoot down builds

the-dump 2022-05-04 04:22:07 its moreso speculation based on what i saw
the-dump 2022-05-04 04:22:22 there was infact an ad that redirected you to the premium page

the-dump 2022-05-04 04:22:48 it was made right as it started to go down

plane-crazy 2023-04-17 06:10:32 ah, block
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 06:11:14 thing is, they're weak against guns because when 1 goes you take 7 blocks worth of your build off
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 06:11:34 replace the circled motors with blocks
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 06:12:03 also if it ceases up after that fix
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 06:12:27 decrease the length of the connected arms to those circled motor
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 06:12:37 then place the block to connect them
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 06:13:18 since from what i can see the stroke lengths don't match up which would probably cease it up with the proper I4 mechanism
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 06:14:54 if it STILL ceases up, reduce the arm length of this, too
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 06:18:03 also, if you do a full remake, try making the entire crank a single peace as ice material, then loose mount the connecting rods to the crank (this may cause some play in movement and might spas out because roblos)
