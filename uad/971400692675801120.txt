help 2022-11-23 16:26:53 Okay so I'm having issues
help 2022-11-23 16:27:03 I'm trying to build a wheelchair
help 2022-11-23 16:27:14 But I can't find a good propulsion method
help 2022-11-23 16:27:34 Everything is either too fast and impossible to control (such as the aeronautical motors)
help 2022-11-23 16:27:45 Or sticks out of the back (like conveyors)
help 2022-11-23 16:28:31 My build is only 3 blocks wide and I can't hide the conveyor underneath because that's where the motor lock that puts the wheels at an acceptable level is

creations-chat 2022-11-23 17:34:49 The fuck is m2m
general 2022-11-23 17:35:31 Ro thunder
general 2022-11-23 17:37:48 The ghost of kyiv is an example of the telephone game in effect
general 2022-11-23 17:38:12 It was originally meant to refer to various ukranian pilots who provided air support to the counter offensive at hostomel
general 2022-11-23 17:38:34 It spread and the idea got started that it referred to a single pilot because of some misinterpretatiob
general 2022-11-23 17:38:50 When that rumor got out people started making fanart and fan creations
general 2022-11-23 17:38:59 Eventually some guy made a rendition in DCS
general 2022-11-23 17:39:21 This spread, too
general 2022-11-23 17:39:57 And eventually the misconception popped up that this was real footage
general 2022-11-23 17:40:55 And that's how we ended up with DCS footage of the ghost of kyiv shooting down 15 enemy fighters when it originated as simply a reference to air support
creations-chat 2022-11-23 17:42:28 The fuck is an m2m
creations-chat 2022-11-23 17:44:30 Nvm found it
general 2022-11-23 17:45:25 What if pc2 had fly by wire mouse aim
general 2022-11-23 17:45:59 Orbit may do
general 2022-11-23 17:46:22 Orbit for rockets
general 2022-11-23 17:46:40 Mouse aim like in wharf blunder
general 2022-11-23 17:47:02 In pc your mouse is more of a joystick and less of an aiming reticle
general 2022-11-23 17:47:29 So your plane can explode?
creations-chat 2022-11-23 17:48:38 What's NSFW
general 2022-11-23 17:49:42 I know radar was suggested
general 2022-11-23 17:50:05 But I'm pretty sure it was only rejected because of a pay wall in the suggestion
general 2022-11-23 17:52:07 <@456226577798135808> I'm 15
general 2022-11-23 17:52:31 Just because I pretend not to know what NSFW stands for for the sake of a simple joke doesn't mean you need to interrogate me
general 2022-11-23 17:53:04 Mee6 being lame again
general 2022-11-23 18:13:09 Biden comes on the television with an announcement
general 2022-11-23 18:13:54 "I am sad to announce that as of 2 minutes ago, on this day, November 24, 2022, the Russian Federation has launched missiles at the United States of America. God help us all."
general 2022-11-23 18:14:11 People gather on their lawns eager to watch the destruction
general 2022-11-23 18:14:17 They hold their kids close
general 2022-11-23 18:14:23 While standing outside you see it
general 2022-11-23 18:14:33 A large object falling towards the earth you stand on
general 2022-11-23 18:14:44 You prepare for the end mentally.
general 2022-11-23 18:14:59 The object opens up at the last moment and the abject horror is revealed
general 2022-11-23 18:15:13 There is no bright flash
general 2022-11-23 18:15:21 Simply tons of parachutes opening up
general 2022-11-23 18:15:35 And falling right into the ocean
general 2022-11-23 18:16:05 The missiles were full of VDV soldiers
general 2022-11-23 18:17:24 Much of value was lost
general 2022-11-23 18:17:34 Historical Mosin rifles lost underwater
general 2022-11-23 18:17:53 WWI Era maxim guns never seen again
general 2022-11-23 18:18:28 Thr last examples of soviet missiles from the 1960s either crashed into the ocean, split open and released VDV, or remain in their silos
general 2022-11-23 18:18:49 What a coincidence
general 2022-11-23 18:18:55 I'm in the bath writing this as we spewk
general 2022-11-23 18:19:38 Quite the opposite
plane-crazy 2022-11-23 18:21:11 Why
general 2022-11-23 18:21:28 Pick it up then
general 2022-11-23 18:21:33 Make haste
general 2022-11-23 18:22:35 Chickens can be really fucking dumb
general 2022-11-23 18:23:12 I'm not a chicken dipshit
general 2022-11-23 18:23:25 Furthermore I have a life outside of this server
general 2022-11-23 18:23:56 Happy now?
plane-crazy 2022-11-23 18:25:16 I need an s-500 in a maid outfit and an f-35 with a whip ASAP
plane-crazy 2022-11-23 18:25:20 No I will not elaborate
plane-crazy 2022-11-23 18:25:35 Did you motorlock that shit into existence
creations-chat 2022-11-23 18:26:26 <@1037630224378109994> nice boat.
creations-chat 2022-11-23 18:43:23 The fuck is a nam
creations-chat 2022-11-23 18:45:49 Not really new
creations-chat 2022-11-23 20:02:07 <@907408760253857812> it's good but it could be improved.

For one it's a bit short compared to the real thing. The colors are also very off. You can get more accurate by using a color picker app.
creations-chat 2022-11-23 20:05:23 Either way it does show some deficiencies that could be helped in later builds. You should consider using fireworks blocks for cylindrical prop hubs, and using delta wing panels or normal wings for the props themselves.
creations-chat 2022-11-23 20:07:41 I'd probably stop giving it for this build. Nothing more to say.
plane-crazy 2022-11-23 20:08:21 Get a rank and then suggestions

general 2022-11-23 20:15:21 That shit served as late as the Korean war
general 2022-11-23 20:15:47 It was so good Stalin made his engineers copy it down to the letter
general 2022-11-23 20:15:57 The tu 4 literally had Boeing logos on it

general 2022-11-23 20:23:51 Cas in general is just mostly shitty
general 2022-11-23 20:24:14 With the exception of the occasional heavy bomber coming to take a fat dump
general 2022-11-23 20:24:37 They do, but there should be AI SPAA implemented for more balance
general 2022-11-23 20:25:18 It looks pretty good
general 2022-11-23 20:25:32 SPAA exists in air RB and recently got buffed

general 2022-11-23 21:17:39 Crush
general 2022-11-23 21:17:48 With a rock
general 2022-11-23 21:18:18 Furries aren't zoophiles
general 2022-11-23 21:19:03 Furries don't like animals
general 2022-11-23 21:19:10 They like cartoon animals
general 2022-11-23 21:19:27 Which are closer to humans with animal features
general 2022-11-23 21:19:56 Read the rest shuttlewad
general 2022-11-23 21:20:20 Think of it like weebs
general 2022-11-23 21:20:28 They're not attracted to the drawing because it's a drawing
general 2022-11-23 21:20:38 They're attracted to it because of its human features
general 2022-11-23 21:21:10 If furries were really zoophiles their ""art"" would be a bit more realistic
general 2022-11-23 21:21:14 And also very illegal
general 2022-11-23 21:21:28 Are you rarted
general 2022-11-23 21:21:45 I'm not saying they don't make nsfw
general 2022-11-23 21:22:06 I'm saying the subjects of their NSFW are closer to humans with animal features than animals with human ones
general 2022-11-23 21:22:30 No furry looks at their pet dog and begins licking their lips like a white girl would in the same situation
general 2022-11-23 21:22:39 Why is there so much NSFW of humans?
general 2022-11-23 21:23:17 You clearly know more about furries than I do
general 2022-11-23 21:23:22 I never heard of such a civil war
general 2022-11-23 21:23:35 Humans are engineered to be attracted to other humans
general 2022-11-23 21:23:49 If a drawing is basically a human with animal features what's the difference
general 2022-11-23 21:24:15 Humans aren't attracted to eyes or mouths
general 2022-11-23 21:24:22 They're attracted to the bits we cover up
general 2022-11-23 21:24:36 (Unless they have some sort of kink but that's another conversation altogether)
general 2022-11-23 21:25:12 If a drawing of an animal has the same objectionable bits what's the difference
general 2022-11-23 21:25:22 Culture isn't inbuilt biologically
general 2022-11-23 21:25:35 The one universal thing is that the bits we cover up are attractive
general 2022-11-23 21:25:45 You don't get aroused at the sight of someone's kidney
general 2022-11-23 21:25:51 (Unless you have a kink)
general 2022-11-23 21:26:12 The drawings of furries have the exact same attraction bits
general 2022-11-23 21:26:36 They usually look just like people with the exception of the head and hands and feet
general 2022-11-23 21:27:04 Nobody's attracted to the tail dmh
general 2022-11-23 21:27:15 I'm dhaking my head
general 2022-11-23 21:27:34 It's 4:27
general 2022-11-23 21:28:13 I'm going to break you
general 2022-11-23 21:28:59 I am a highwayman
general 2022-11-23 21:29:14 Along the coach roads I did ride
general 2022-11-23 21:29:55 I asked Google to play highwaymen and it played hot women
general 2022-11-23 21:30:11 Fishbed
general 2022-11-23 21:30:28 Pasqualli pfp
general 2022-11-23 21:30:41 Opinion respected
general 2022-11-23 21:31:19 Fulcrum has a shitty k/d
general 2022-11-23 21:31:25 Fishbed better
general 2022-11-23 21:31:35 It's an interceptor dipshit
general 2022-11-23 21:31:42 Why would it turn
general 2022-11-23 21:32:05 Fishbed is a nato aircraft and is therefore automatically better
general 2022-11-23 21:32:18 Just ask Croatia
general 2022-11-23 21:32:49 Why is building rockets a rank
general 2022-11-23 21:33:01 Rockets are just vertical planes
general 2022-11-23 21:33:11 Just stick some canard on and you can control it easy
general 2022-11-23 21:33:34 In plane crazy yes
general 2022-11-23 21:33:59 I like the fishbed
general 2022-11-23 21:34:14 I like how a derivative of it makes up the backbone of the modern Chinese air force
general 2022-11-23 21:34:25 It's probably the longest serving fighter currently extant
general 2022-11-23 21:34:51 Then what crashed into that american P-8 due to an inexperienced chinese pilot?
general 2022-11-23 21:35:25 Symptomatic please stop being insufferable
general 2022-11-23 21:36:13 At least the mig 21 is actually useful
general 2022-11-23 21:36:30 And isn't getting shot down by manpads en masse over ukraine
general 2022-11-23 21:36:45 They threw it into a fighter role even though it's an interceptor
general 2022-11-23 21:37:04 The fact it has the 1:2 kill ratio it does is an indicator that it's somewhat devent
general 2022-11-23 21:37:17 Did the f14 ever fight a plane of its same era?
general 2022-11-23 21:37:58 Yeah. That means you can't judge a plane based purely on its performance in numbers
general 2022-11-23 21:38:33 It was a 2nd gen interceptor ffs
general 2022-11-23 21:38:45 Putting it against the F4 as a long range fighter is a skill issue
general 2022-11-23 21:39:04 If we're going by age then is the f4 bad because it's ass in Iranian service?
general 2022-11-23 21:39:17 Fair argument
general 2022-11-23 21:40:01 The F105 was good because even though it was overloaded with bombs it still managed to get some kills
general 2022-11-23 21:40:05 The issue was overuse
general 2022-11-23 21:40:17 Communist pilots and maintenance
general 2022-11-23 21:40:41 The su-75 isn't a joke because a joke needs to actually be told
general 2022-11-23 21:40:58 The su-75 is a figment of putins imagination
general 2022-11-23 21:41:05 Fucking hate pakistan
general 2022-11-23 21:41:13 They ruined the reputations of many good planes
general 2022-11-23 21:41:21 Epitome of "bad pilot"
general 2022-11-23 21:42:14 Mig-25 was good because even as a shitty interceptor it got 6 kills on actual fucking fighters
general 2022-11-23 21:42:30 1:1 KDR
general 2022-11-23 21:42:49 My brother in christ the f15 was designed in response to its goofy look
general 2022-11-23 21:43:18 Jets don't even use gas
general 2022-11-23 21:43:23 They use the tears of Pierre sprey
general 2022-11-23 21:43:50 It's literally named after it
general 2022-11-23 21:43:53 The foxbat effect
general 2022-11-23 21:44:01 Didn't look goofy
general 2022-11-23 21:44:08 Not saying the mig25 is on par with the f15
general 2022-11-23 21:44:15 But it definitely didn't look goofy
general 2022-11-23 21:44:50 Mig 25 was a great interceptor and a decent fighter
general 2022-11-23 21:45:11 1:1 kdr is decent
general 2022-11-23 21:45:24 And the thing is just a piloted cruise missile with tiny missiles on it
general 2022-11-23 21:45:31 Of course it's a good interceptor
general 2022-11-23 21:45:37 Iran Iraq war
general 2022-11-23 21:45:42 1:1 kill ratio
general 2022-11-23 21:45:46 6 kills were on fighters
general 2022-11-23 21:46:02 2 on slow targets which mig25 was meant to deal with
general 2022-11-23 21:46:11 It's a great interceptor
general 2022-11-23 21:46:38 What would work better against a bomber than a piloted cruise missile with tinier missiles glued to it
general 2022-11-23 21:46:42 Nothing
general 2022-11-23 21:47:01 If the mig25 was flying in its intended capacity then something was already melting
general 2022-11-23 21:47:05 Probably several cities
general 2022-11-23 21:47:26 It served against Iran who had f14s and phoenixes
general 2022-11-23 21:47:35 I don't recall it ever getting hit with a phoenix
general 2022-11-23 21:47:49 It was perfect at this
general 2022-11-23 21:48:22 By the time the f14 gets high enough 5 cities are already radioactive dust
general 2022-11-23 21:48:27 Plus it's a naval fighter
general 2022-11-23 21:48:35 How the fuck is it going to intercept a bomber
general 2022-11-23 21:48:56 For fleet defense
general 2022-11-23 21:49:18 And the fleet isn't getting hit with nuclear bombers
general 2022-11-23 21:49:35 The Russians aren't sending tu-95s to nuclear bomb a carrier
general 2022-11-23 21:50:12 How is it going to get to the continental us and stop a bomber
general 2022-11-23 21:50:18 Explain
general 2022-11-23 21:51:04 And they would launch f14s fast enough to stop a tu-22 en route to the US?
general 2022-11-23 21:51:34 And these f-14s would then gain enough altitude to stop the tu-22?
general 2022-11-23 21:52:00 It's a nuclear bomber
general 2022-11-23 21:52:12 Are you expecting the Phoenix to shoot vertically?
general 2022-11-23 21:52:32 If we're talking interceptors then they're already obsolete
general 2022-11-23 21:52:41 F14, mig25
general 2022-11-23 21:53:14 No bombers, no interceptors
general 2022-11-23 21:53:16 Simple
general 2022-11-23 21:53:21 And bombers aren't obsolete
general 2022-11-23 21:53:47 The B-52 can just sit outside the border and launch cruise missiles while Russia watches in horror
general 2022-11-23 21:54:08 The argument was about interceptors in general
general 2022-11-23 21:54:34 It's called the nuclear triad for a reason
general 2022-11-23 21:54:38 Three elements
general 2022-11-23 21:54:43 Bombers, missiles, subs
general 2022-11-23 21:54:54 Bombers are an essential element
general 2022-11-23 21:54:57 And not obsolete
general 2022-11-23 21:55:49 B-2 says hi
general 2022-11-23 21:56:00 The US maintains cruise missiles for a reason
general 2022-11-23 21:56:08 Superpowers all have bombers in service for a reaspn
general 2022-11-23 21:56:14 It's cruise missiles
general 2022-11-23 21:56:47 Mfs out here really think the US is just throwing money at the B-52 for no reason
general 2022-11-23 21:57:30 My brother in christ the b52 is just icing on the cake for conventional warfare
general 2022-11-23 21:57:46 It literally just shits out dumb bombs
general 2022-11-23 21:57:55 It's a role anything can do
general 2022-11-23 21:58:04 Have you
general 2022-11-23 21:58:16 Why do we still have B-52 exclusive nuclear arms
general 2022-11-23 21:58:33 In a nuclear context sure
general 2022-11-23 21:58:50 Thighmangler has clearly never mangled a thigh
general 2022-11-23 21:59:23 I'm not reformer I just think cruise missiles aren't just completely stoppage by air defense
general 2022-11-23 21:59:44 Russia still uses mostly s-300
general 2022-11-23 21:59:58 But nuclear cruise missiles would be usable
general 2022-11-23 22:00:13 There's a reason we have nuclear capable and actively nuclear tipped ones in service
general 2022-11-23 22:00:27 The b-52 can launch these
general 2022-11-23 22:00:32 That's its purpose
general 2022-11-23 22:00:57 Those were for bombers
general 2022-11-23 22:01:02 And they were based
general 2022-11-23 22:01:07 Hornet > tomcat
general 2022-11-23 22:01:28 I don't recall the b52 ever crashing due to a malfunction
general 2022-11-23 22:01:55 Ah yes, when that happened 5 times
general 2022-11-23 22:02:05 In its entire service career
general 2022-11-23 22:02:15 "It's purpose is to crash and burn"
general 2022-11-23 22:02:37 It definitely happened
general 2022-11-23 22:02:51 But not frequently enough to bug out about it

general 2022-11-24 00:14:03 After an engine failure in flight, the most important course of 
l
action is to continue flying the airplane. Best glide speed as shown 
in Figure 3-1 should be established as quickly as possible. While 
gliding toward a suitable landing area, an effort should be made to 
identify the cause of the failure. If time permits, an engine restart 
should be attempted as shown in the checklist. If the engine cannot 
be restarted, a forced landing without power must be completed
general 2022-11-24 00:14:44 both the vacuum pumps fail in flight, the directional indicator 
and attitude indicator will be disabled, and the pilot will have to rely 
on the turn coordinator if he inadvertently flies into clouds. If an 
autopilot is installed, it too may be affected. Refer to Section 9, 
Supplements, for additional details concerning autopilot operation. 
The following instructions assume that only the electrically powered 
turn coordinator is operative, and that the pilot is not completely 
proficient in instrument flying.
general 2022-11-24 00:15:14 Neither is true

general 2022-11-24 00:19:32 ALCOHOL 
• 
Do not fly while under the influence of alcohol. Flying and alcohol are definitely • 
a lethal combination. FARs prohibit pilots from flying within 8 hours after 
consuming any alcoholic beverage or while under the influence of alcohol. A pilot may still be under the influence 8 hours after drinking a moderate amount 
of alcohol. Therefore, an excellent practice is to allow at least 24 hours 
between "bottle and throttle," depending on the amount of alcoholic beverage 
consumed. 
Extensive research has provided a number of facts about the hazards of 
alcohol consumption and flying. As little as one ounce of liquor, one bottle of 
beer, or four ounces of wine can impair flying skills, with the alcohol consumed 
in these drinks being detectable in the breath and blood for at least three 
hours. Alcohol also renders a pilot much more susceptible to disorientation 
and hypoxia. In addition, the after effects of alcohol increase the level of 
fatigue significantly. 
There is simply no way of alleviating a hangover. Remember that the human 
body metabolizes alcohol at a fixed rate, and no amount of coffee or 
medications will alter this rate. Do not fly with a hangover, or a "masked 
hangover" (symptoms suppressed by aspirin or other medication). A pilot can 
be severely impaired for many hours by hangover.

general 2022-12-10 01:18:12 Like hes gonna manifest bullets out of thin air or some shit to sell to the somalians
general 2022-12-10 01:19:17 An american citizen was freed in exchange for an arms dealer who is so heavily monitored that having him as a member of a crime group would be a liability
general 2022-12-10 01:19:58 He was arrested in the 90s and barely knew about the internet. He probably doesnt even know what a bitcoin is, let alone how to make transactions to sell guns.
general 2022-12-10 01:20:06 And then theres the problem of sourcing
general 2022-12-10 01:20:20 Where can he even get these weapons
general 2022-12-10 01:20:27 Balls
general 2022-12-10 01:20:48 I like the pun in your name
general 2022-12-10 01:21:23 True but its the currency modern illegal transactions take place through
general 2022-12-10 01:21:37 If he cant do crypto he cant deal guns
general 2022-12-10 01:21:45 We are in 2022
general 2022-12-10 01:22:31 Arms dealing today is an entirely different game from what it was in bout's prime
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 01:36:18 Im aware
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 01:36:34 That and the fact the airframe was not built for more than 2 gs and will literally snap
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 01:36:47 But in plane crazy anything can happen
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 01:38:34 Could it outmaneuver a namnam jet? Maybe

<@527653676022628353> but are you insufferable
creations-chat 2022-12-10 01:43:30 I was never the exception. Im the rule exemplified. 

You are the exception here. The one we should all look up to. Youre not a complete dipshit like half the people here
creations-chat 2022-12-10 01:46:22 Because its a rare concept and well made
creations-chat 2022-12-10 01:48:40 Pretty good tbh. Slap on some steering for trolling purposes
creations-chat 2022-12-10 02:15:45 Upload a video to the channel to humiliate sopro and also prove him wrong.
creations-chat 2022-12-10 02:23:18 I berate everyone equally
general 2022-12-10 02:29:19 Im not gonna get banned for being a suspected terrorist right?
general 2022-12-10 02:29:37 Good
general 2022-12-10 02:30:02 Likely yes or likely no
general 2022-12-10 02:31:01 Luckily my profile statement is a joke and not real

general 2022-12-10 02:33:01 Plain vaporware 2?
general 2022-12-10 02:33:06 You gotta be kidding
general 2022-12-10 02:33:37 When is thr alleged pc2 being released?
general 2022-12-10 02:34:00 Or the sequel is hard or impossible to access compared to the original and dies in its infancy
general 2022-12-10 02:34:14 If it has a paywall its dead
general 2022-12-10 02:34:24 Remember armored patrol
general 2022-12-10 02:35:10 Most of the kids who make up the pc2 player demographic will leave if there is a paywall
general 2022-12-10 02:35:15 And never come back
general 2022-12-10 02:36:17 We do a little bit of fearmongering
general 2022-12-10 02:36:32 For you maybe
general 2022-12-10 02:36:38 For development it shrinks the money pool
general 2022-12-10 02:37:14 Kiddos are more willing to pay for a gamepass after theyre hooked than pay a big sum for a game they cant experience
general 2022-12-10 02:37:32 Why else would gamepasses cost money
general 2022-12-10 02:37:45 It shrinks profit then
general 2022-12-10 02:37:56 As well as pay for other devs
general 2022-12-10 02:38:18 Shrunken profit means less attention into the game compared to the original
general 2022-12-10 02:38:47 Why waste timd developing pc2 when pc1 fills your pockets faster
general 2022-12-10 02:39:21 Amount of popularity of the game correlates to profit
general 2022-12-10 02:39:34 Good

general 2022-12-10 14:11:14 I get that it started off as a glitch but it would be cool if they cleaned it up a little
general 2022-12-10 14:11:39 Or just made it entirely unnecessary
general 2022-12-10 14:11:47 In pc2
general 2022-12-10 14:12:09 What target?
general 2022-12-10 14:12:28 The bottom one is launching an aim 9
general 2022-12-10 14:12:33 An air to air missile
general 2022-12-10 14:12:45 Which one is better depends on the target
general 2022-12-10 14:15:42 True and based
general 2022-12-10 14:16:05 F-14 fans mald more
general 2022-12-10 14:16:47 It just kind of looked like one. My mistake.
general 2022-12-10 14:16:59 Anyway, the F-14 is ugly as fuck
general 2022-12-10 14:17:20 F-111 > A-10
general 2022-12-10 14:17:47 I dont ogle ordnance for 5 hours every day (clearly blind)
general 2022-12-10 14:18:04 F-18 > F-14
general 2022-12-10 14:18:37 All I really noticed was the fins
general 2022-12-10 14:18:48 It looked kimd lf like an aim 9 to me
general 2022-12-10 14:19:05 Fin placement especially
general 2022-12-10 14:19:14 And they have served the same role at least once
general 2022-12-10 14:19:30 An F-15 once got an air to air kill with a bomb
general 2022-12-10 14:20:01 Its desert storm and this F-15 is attacking an iraqi airfield
general 2022-12-10 14:20:31 I didnt look up reference photos to compare it too
general 2022-12-10 14:20:47 I dont stay awake all night looking at pictures of ordinance and staining my sheets

general 2022-12-10 14:21:58 I didnt feel like looking up a reference photo
general 2022-12-10 14:22:11 It just kind of looked like one because front fins and back fins
general 2022-12-10 14:22:21 Missiles drop out of planes in a similar way before ignition
general 2022-12-10 14:22:39 The mald is my favorite ordinance
general 2022-12-10 14:22:52 They killed more ground vehicles than the a10
general 2022-12-10 14:23:14 This is only desert storm
general 2022-12-10 14:23:38 In the *one* confrontation the two aircraft both played a role in the f111 performed better
general 2022-12-10 14:24:07 Im not ordinance

creations-chat 2022-12-11 23:13:02 Stylistically that battlebot is actual doodoo
creations-chat 2022-12-11 23:16:55 Thanks to the lack of treads, suspension, or even a simple conveyor system, it probably also performs like doodoo offroad.

The main issues I have are the full scale realistic radar and CWIS glued onto what looks like a carboard box. 

I can't really give any good advice on how to make a better battlebot specifically, but I think maybe plane crazy isnt the best place to do it.
general 2022-12-11 23:18:07 Does plane crazy even have ground effect
general 2022-12-11 23:18:09 Or
general 2022-12-11 23:18:15 Will it need hover thrusters
general 2022-12-11 23:18:18 It will
general 2022-12-11 23:18:58 Hover thrusters are probably the only way to simulate ground effect flight
general 2022-12-11 23:19:37 This does free up the wings to be made out of blocks instead of actual wings which will definitely assist realism
plane-crazy 2022-12-11 23:20:21 You cant really make a missile without at least 4 control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-12-11 23:25:26 How do you motorlock all 4 control surfaces into one space along with the explosive and propeller
creations-chat 2022-12-11 23:28:05 <@456226577798135808>
general 2022-12-11 23:36:07 **Reason:** Bad word usage
creations-chat 2022-12-12 00:01:21 Suspension is a block in the gears tab. It allows a block on your build to move up and down (within reason), which makes it easier for said build to move across rough terrain (since the wheels can adapt to the height of the terrain)

general 2022-12-12 19:46:10 And we lost thousands of american lives when we finally fixed the saddam issue
general 2022-12-12 19:46:47 The only reason nobody has abolished it is because the last guy who tried spilled all pver his convertable
general 2022-12-12 19:47:53 Not to mention
general 2022-12-12 19:48:20 Do you remember what happened to the man who killed jfk?
general 2022-12-12 19:48:27 Shot right in the middle of the courtroom
general 2022-12-12 19:48:47 You think its a coincidence?
general 2022-12-12 19:49:05 Or that someone would ruin their life like that to ensure their president never got justice?
general 2022-12-12 19:49:13 No
general 2022-12-12 19:49:33 That was the cia keeping the secret in
general 2022-12-12 19:50:16 Literally indeed
general 2022-12-12 19:50:28 That jfk was assassinated by the cia is the only sane theory
general 2022-12-12 19:50:47 No communist would kill an american president and bring themselves under more scrutiny
general 2022-12-12 19:50:58 They learned that after the one guy burned the reichstag
general 2022-12-12 19:51:30 Im not a very conspiratorial person
general 2022-12-12 19:51:33 But
general 2022-12-12 19:51:53 Its just basic logic that the cia would kill the man who tried to end them

plane-crazy 2022-12-16 11:56:54 They're going to learn eventually. It's better that they learn from someone who knows what they're talking about like a parent or teacher than from the internet.
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 11:57:41 It's been shown that not teaching people about this stuff will result in more accidental pregnancies as misconceptions are spread thanks to the information vacuum in the child's mind
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 11:57:50 So they have a solid foundation
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 11:58:54 However they are talking about human baby-making in a children's game and, in practice, likely contributing to the problem
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 11:59:41 Teach people how babies are made from a young age
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 11:59:52 Or else they'll get the wrong idea from places like the internet
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 12:00:41 It's better you as a parent teach your kid about this than someone getting paid to present a misleading picture in order to create more viewer engagement
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 12:01:09 Although this being said talking to random kids over the internet about it probably contributes to the problem

general 2022-12-17 17:38:31 That way we can wipe them off the map and use the resulting ocean as an american port
general 2022-12-17 17:39:01 Femboys are a growing portion of the slovenian populatiob
general 2022-12-17 17:39:17 When it reaches critical mass the birthrate will collapse
general 2022-12-17 17:39:35 Slovenia will become a country with no purpise to exist
general 2022-12-17 17:39:56 As all the people there are femboys and do not offer anything american or british femboys cannot also do
general 2022-12-17 17:40:05 Slovenia is forgotten on the world stage
general 2022-12-17 17:40:40 Part 2 is a series of nuclear strikes on slovenia and a canal being dug through croatia to the mediterranean
general 2022-12-17 17:40:56 Slovenia becomes an american mediterranean military base
general 2022-12-17 17:41:03 I told you why
general 2022-12-17 17:41:18 The how is simple
general 2022-12-17 17:41:38 Turn slovenia into a naval base with minimal international resistance
general 2022-12-17 17:41:45 The how is simple
general 2022-12-17 17:41:57 Estrogen is added to food and water supplies covertly
general 2022-12-17 17:42:20 Femboys elsewhere are the result of femboyization pilot tests

general 2022-12-17 17:44:13 Just like in falklands 1982
general 2022-12-17 17:44:27 This lack of soldiers demotivated the team players
general 2022-12-17 17:44:35 Resulting in subpar play and a loss to croatia
general 2022-12-17 17:44:42 Who is a member of NATO much like britain
general 2022-12-17 17:44:52 Britain therefore has a reason to help croatia
general 2022-12-17 17:45:15 Moreover they have reasoning to hate argentina
general 2022-12-17 17:45:24 Falklands 1982 killed some british youths
general 2022-12-17 17:45:33 This makes britain sad and hold a grudge
general 2022-12-17 17:45:59 Therefore helping croatia and ruining argentina in the world cup simply makes sense

general 2022-12-17 17:47:21 He was killed by the mob
general 2022-12-17 17:48:18 This alsp explains why the guy who shot jfk was killed
general 2022-12-17 17:48:40 Astolfo was a CIA invention

general 2022-12-19 22:31:41 Fig bungus

the-dump 2022-12-19 22:33:14 Ewww
the-dump 2022-12-19 22:33:18 Homophobia
general 2022-12-19 22:33:56 🦤
general 2022-12-19 22:34:13 Too soon
general 2022-12-19 22:34:33 I dont think any of us own f-4s
general 2022-12-19 22:34:54 No rich person with a real F-4 would bother playing a roblox game
the-dump 2022-12-19 22:35:18 Why
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:47:15 thats clearly satire
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:47:19 you cant tell me thats real
general 2022-12-19 23:47:27 ok
general 2022-12-19 23:47:49 people will get addicted to what gives them dopamine
general 2022-12-19 23:47:57 different people have different things that make them feel good
general 2022-12-19 23:48:12 I think this would be cool
general 2022-12-19 23:48:18 if you shoot civilians you get kicked from the match
general 2022-12-19 23:48:50 what the blurb literally says is
general 2022-12-19 23:48:52 "it wants military-themed video games to adhere to real-life international laws, punishing player characters for war crimes. Is this feasible?"
general 2022-12-19 23:49:09 I think it would be cool if players were punished for doing dumb shit
general 2022-12-19 23:49:22 people have had short attention spans for a while
general 2022-12-19 23:49:30 millenials were called the "now" generation
general 2022-12-19 23:49:47 society will likely just adapt
general 2022-12-19 23:49:51 yeah
general 2022-12-19 23:49:59 if you strafe houses in war thunder you get an SL penalty
general 2022-12-19 23:50:12 shit like that makes players more careful and adds another layer of gameplay
general 2022-12-19 23:50:28 war crimes in games are easy
general 2022-12-19 23:50:42 making players need to be careful would be an interesting gameplay mechanic
general 2022-12-19 23:50:52 where's the fun in that?
general 2022-12-19 23:51:12 boogie
general 2022-12-19 23:51:39 I just want to see players punch their monitor because their bomb hit a civilian convoy
general 2022-12-19 23:52:20 the male fantasy is blowing up enemy players while respecting civilians, and drinking the salty tears of said enemy players
general 2022-12-19 23:53:41 I dont think video games were made specifically to blow up houses
general 2022-12-19 23:53:57 I know 90% of video games where war crimes are even committable dont reward you for doing as such
general 2022-12-19 23:54:13 hell, I'm pretty sure cod ends the mission if you shoot civilians
general 2022-12-19 23:54:15 like the baby
general 2022-12-19 23:54:34 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HlClCoOqPg
general 2022-12-19 23:54:41 where
general 2022-12-19 23:54:56 I dont recall getting SL for turning houses into rubble in war thunder
general 2022-12-19 23:55:38 my brother in christ that was a sound glitch
general 2022-12-19 23:55:43 killing the child usually ends the mission
general 2022-12-19 23:56:02 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUFrOl-34fo
general 2022-12-19 23:56:05 this is how it usually goes
general 2022-12-19 23:56:12 no reward
general 2022-12-19 23:56:41 that doesnt mean you always get to do such things
general 2022-12-19 23:57:05 you could be a fighter pilot irl if you didn't spend your entire teenage years sitting behind a computer playing games
general 2022-12-19 23:57:23 had you actually gone to college and gotten a degree, joining the air force as an officer would be in the cards
general 2022-12-19 23:57:31 and from there, flight
general 2022-12-19 23:57:49 so then dcs isnt the best example
general 2022-12-19 23:58:00 you don't know what they're going to assign you to
general 2022-12-19 23:58:21 does dcs prepare you to fly a C-130 halfway across the world with no threats?
general 2022-12-19 23:58:35 nobody
general 2022-12-19 23:58:38 but you have to start early
general 2022-12-19 23:59:06 you have to get into college before you can fly
general 2022-12-19 23:59:07 so yes
general 2022-12-19 23:59:10 start very early
general 2022-12-19 23:59:34 DCS isn't going to prepare you to fly IRL planes
general 2022-12-19 23:59:40 there's more to it than sight and sound
general 2022-12-19 23:59:53 but they're not going to accept someone with no college performance
general 2022-12-20 00:00:04 and to get into college you're gonna need to prepare in high school
general 2022-12-20 00:00:15 physiological cues
general 2022-12-20 00:00:40 I never said you had to go to flight school at 14
general 2022-12-20 00:00:48 just that you had to start preparing early
general 2022-12-20 00:01:03 sitting behind your PC all day isn't preparing you for the air force
general 2022-12-20 00:02:47 okay but you can be a fighter pilot
general 2022-12-20 00:02:51 we all agree on that
general 2022-12-20 00:02:55 nobody here is too far gone
general 2022-12-20 00:03:02 so is DCS really doing something you can't?
general 2022-12-20 00:03:17 moreover, in the context of doing war crimes in a game
general 2022-12-20 00:03:25 is using DCS as practicing for a real pilot a good example?
general 2022-12-20 00:03:50 If you were doing it to prepare you'd probably want some realism
general 2022-12-20 00:03:52 like idk
general 2022-12-20 00:03:56 punishment for bombing civvies
general 2022-12-20 00:04:23 thats the context of this whole conversation you dingus
general 2022-12-20 00:04:43 literally this
general 2022-12-20 00:05:10 civvies
general 2022-12-20 00:05:12 not cities
general 2022-12-20 00:05:22 you're the stupid one here
general 2022-12-20 00:05:24 civvies
general 2022-12-20 00:05:25 civilians
general 2022-12-20 00:05:32 the people who are protected under international law
general 2022-12-20 00:05:39 perhaps the game should punish you for bombing them
general 2022-12-20 00:05:44 just like your chain of command would
general 2022-12-20 00:06:00 it adds an extra layer of gameplay and means players have to be more careful
general 2022-12-20 00:06:19 why are you so obsessed with color
general 2022-12-20 00:06:45 we are having a discussion
general 2022-12-20 00:06:48 and you joined the discussion
general 2022-12-20 00:07:03 therefore I can give you my opinion regardless of whether you're a developer
general 2022-12-20 00:07:16 I'm just saying it'd be funny if there were in-game consequences for in-game war crimes
general 2022-12-20 00:07:28 take 5 seconds to read the FUCKING BLURB
general 2022-12-20 00:07:49 you're telling me I'm malding when I'm sitting behind my computer chilling
general 2022-12-20 00:09:04 meet me in vc
general 2022-12-20 00:09:29 hangar
general 2022-12-20 00:09:58 wow thats a conversation
general 2022-12-20 00:10:03 what the fuck are they doing there
general 2022-12-20 00:10:49 whats an operation speechbubble
general 2022-12-20 00:11:14 I am deranged
general 2022-12-20 00:15:16 its absolutely the fucking jet
general 2022-12-20 00:15:25 if you're in a biplane and the other guy is in a YF-17
general 2022-12-20 00:15:39 you're dying
general 2022-12-20 00:15:45 the amraam flies fast
general 2022-12-20 00:16:15 did you hear about the F-15 that got an air to air kill
general 2022-12-20 00:16:18 with a fucking guided bomb
general 2022-12-20 00:16:25 fabric still reflects radar
general 2022-12-20 00:16:48 you're a whitename
general 2022-12-20 00:16:51 I'm a whitename
general 2022-12-20 00:16:56 therefore they think you're dumb
general 2022-12-20 00:16:58 and I'm dumb
general 2022-12-20 00:17:04 and together it's a "whitename meetup"
general 2022-12-20 00:19:02 thats not how radar works
general 2022-12-20 00:19:16 ok but use protection
general 2022-12-20 00:19:39 a radar emits electromagnetic waves at a certain frequency
general 2022-12-20 00:19:58 these waves bounce back off of a target towards the radar receiver
general 2022-12-20 00:20:25 this receiver takes any differences in the signal from the one initially emitted and uses them to calculate distance and direction
general 2022-12-20 00:20:37 this is how tracking works
general 2022-12-20 00:45:13 I cant wait to get expert
general 2022-12-20 00:45:33 what waiting?
general 2022-12-20 00:45:38 you gotta take action to get expert
general 2022-12-20 00:45:47 and that's why I'm acting right now
general 2022-12-20 00:46:12 not the
general 2022-12-20 00:46:16 I dont

general 2022-12-20 15:24:08 Russia is not the only gas supplier in the region
general 2022-12-20 15:24:28 I could see them invading kyrgyzstan to enforce a monopoly
general 2022-12-20 15:24:36 And blowing apart CSTO in the process
general 2022-12-20 15:25:00 Ofc
general 2022-12-20 15:25:02 Who else
general 2022-12-20 15:25:42 Talking about gas isnt political
general 2022-12-20 15:26:09 Russia invading kyrgyzstan to enforce a monopoly would be an economic war
general 2022-12-20 15:26:15 Not a political one
general 2022-12-20 15:26:23 Therefore its not politicql
general 2022-12-20 15:26:40 It wouldnt be a political war
general 2022-12-20 15:26:51 Therefore its an apolitical topic
general 2022-12-20 15:26:59 **a r g e n t i n a**

general 2022-12-20 15:28:29 Theyre still invading ukraine after they shelled all the infrastructure to shit
general 2022-12-20 15:28:37 Im the imposter
general 2022-12-20 15:28:47 I swam down to nord stream and loosened a bolt
general 2022-12-20 15:28:53 Then I lit a lighter
general 2022-12-20 15:29:18 Poland would love to invade russia
general 2022-12-20 15:29:45 So slovenia did it?
general 2022-12-20 15:30:49 Theyre not wondering
general 2022-12-20 15:30:59 Also calling russia a superpower is a bit off
general 2022-12-20 15:31:06 Theyre less powerful than india
general 2022-12-20 15:31:32 Im sure the t-90 is not good shut
general 2022-12-20 15:31:46 You think they have a stockpile of T-14s ready and raring to go?
general 2022-12-20 15:31:56 Or they secretly ramped up su-57 production?
general 2022-12-20 15:31:58 No
general 2022-12-20 15:32:39 Nato was already able to shit on them conventionally
general 2022-12-20 15:32:48 But its not outdated shut
general 2022-12-20 15:32:54 Theyre sending S-400s
general 2022-12-20 15:33:11 Theyre sending T-90s
general 2022-12-20 15:33:16 Thats good shit for russia
general 2022-12-20 15:33:39 The only better equipment they have is the mythical T-14
general 2022-12-20 15:33:49 And the Su-57 of which only 6 production models have been made
general 2022-12-20 15:34:20 They can and they will
general 2022-12-20 15:34:35 90% of aid to ukraine is old shit that would have rotted in a warehouse before being used
general 2022-12-20 15:34:48 A lot of munitions we send them are close to expiring
general 2022-12-20 15:35:19 Airpiglet started it

general 2022-12-20 15:36:26 Its clear theyre dedicated from putin's 500000 corpses remark
general 2022-12-20 15:36:46 No reasonable army would go up to that point
general 2022-12-20 15:36:54 We pulled out of vietnam at 58,000
general 2022-12-20 15:37:04 Airpiglet apparently

general 2022-12-23 03:44:43 The water boils away
general 2022-12-23 03:44:53 The carbon hardens into a black crust
general 2022-12-23 03:45:47 If youve melted the easiest melted part there is still solid parts of it
general 2022-12-23 03:46:05 If youve melted the hardest to melt part (the carbon) everything else is likely vapor
general 2022-12-23 03:46:34 You cant entirely melt human skin
general 2022-12-23 03:46:57 Burning away skin still aint melting it
general 2022-12-23 03:47:52 Outside temperature and directly applied temperature are two different things
general 2022-12-23 03:48:05 Your brain stops functioning at 110 degrees celsius
general 2022-12-23 03:48:19 But I used to live in 29 palms and during the summer it went up to 114
general 2022-12-23 03:48:35 Skin is a mixture
general 2022-12-23 03:48:52 You can't melt one part and keep the other
general 2022-12-23 03:49:19 Just like you cant truly vaporize lemonade since there will always be the dissolved stuff still in there
general 2022-12-23 03:49:31 Yeah
general 2022-12-23 03:49:38 I love melting skin

general 2022-12-23 03:53:40 It looks like a weird ass map
general 2022-12-23 03:53:53 Kids are cruel jack
general 2022-12-23 03:54:48 And Im very in touch with my inner child
general 2022-12-23 03:54:57 Its just a sundowner quote

general 2023-03-18 18:53:48 Whatever the hell russia has doing has led to vietnam scale casualties in about a tenth of the time it took for vietnam to end
general 2023-03-18 18:54:43 I dont see how you can simultaneously declare NATO as terrorists for the 1999 bombings and then proclaim russia is somehow freeing the ukrainians unless youre completely blind
general 2023-03-18 18:54:53 To be fair most vatniks are completely blind

general 2023-03-20 01:22:16 Huh? Veterans? Playing bootleg simpleplanes?

general 2023-03-20 01:25:00 Yes
general 2023-03-20 01:25:06 Which is my point
general 2023-03-20 01:25:15 PC and simpleplanes serve about the same niche
general 2023-03-20 01:25:23 Build vehicle with blocks

general 2023-03-20 01:28:52 I've used chatgpt, it's not that bad
general 2023-03-20 01:28:57 Or maybe I have it confused with gpt3
general 2023-03-20 01:29:15 Either way one of those is better than <@318892614378061824> at flinging insults
general 2023-03-20 01:29:36 Once saw GPT-3 generate a plot about a pilot and a femboy dogfighting

general 2023-03-24 03:41:44 MODS ARE LITERALLY ORWELL
general 2023-03-24 03:42:06 In orwells novel 1984 the practice of intimate physical relationships was banned
general 2023-03-24 03:42:25 Because love (and consequently those relationships) formed bonds the party could not control
general 2023-03-24 03:42:50 It is clear to me at least being unable to post bee ass is in pursuit of a similar policy
general 2023-03-24 03:43:12 PCC mods are likely going to drag me to room 101 for speaking out about this pressing topic

general 2023-03-24 09:36:12 Furry content is obviously higher in the bait department than gay content
general 2023-03-24 09:36:17 Aggravates more people
general 2023-03-24 09:36:29 Also spreads the pathowogen farther
general 2023-03-24 09:36:45 Leads more people down that path
general 2023-03-24 09:36:58 Makes more furries
general 2023-03-24 09:37:32 I'm running for mod

general 2023-03-24 09:37:40 Im silly
general 2023-03-24 09:39:45 I say fuzzy should be removed from mod positon
general 2023-03-24 09:39:54 A mod should not be allowed to turn off pings
general 2023-03-24 09:40:03 At the same time, rule proposal
general 2023-03-24 09:40:11 Don't ping mods unnecessarily
general 2023-03-24 09:40:20 Some of you fuckers like to ping mods randomly
general 2023-03-24 09:40:31 Or in response to things you dont like
general 2023-03-24 09:41:09 Mods get alarm fatigue
general 2023-03-24 09:41:24 When most of the pings they receive are bullshit its reasonable for them to turn off pings
general 2023-03-24 09:41:29 But this leads to
general 2023-03-24 09:41:36 Situations like whats going on in the dump
general 2023-03-24 09:41:53 It would be best if just pinging mods for no reason was banned
general 2023-03-24 09:42:39 I can't make suggestions
