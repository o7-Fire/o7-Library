general 2021-08-13 01:50:05 ...
general 2021-08-13 01:50:08 just joined
general 2021-08-13 01:50:12 hello
general 2021-08-13 01:50:16 greetings
general 2021-08-13 01:50:25 bonjour
general 2021-08-13 01:50:36 no just wanted to check roles
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:15:25 by the way
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:15:32 are the devs gona update the map?
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:15:36 and make it bigger?
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:16:04 cause naval battles with friends could be quite fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:16:13 if we had more water
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:16:37 if everyone agrees only to use tnt as weapons
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:16:41 subs vs ships
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:16:45 it's very fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:17:02 also larger ships can't really fight since there's no space
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:17:12 a battleship takes up a good chunk of the ocean
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:17:22 and it's such an easy thing to implement
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:17:28 that too
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:17:34 but we need more water
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:17:50 carrier battles too
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:17:56 not enough space
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:18:53 the entire map design isn't very good
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:19:14 just do a competition
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:19:19 for map design
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:19:30 and the winner gets a role
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:19:32 boom
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:19:37 fun game
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:20:09 btw
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:20:17 does anyone have the crazy scientist role?
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:20:37 O:
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:20:45 hope I get it first then
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:21:01 it is tough though
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:21:16 I've managed to land a single stage while it's manned
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:21:21 but unmanned is tricky
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 18:32:08 hey does anyone know the official definition of land propulsively for the crazy scientist role?
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 17:39:36 does anyone have a way to deal with cutter bugs?
bug-reports 2021-08-26 17:36:54 For some bloody reason I can't use any engines, anything in the engines tab does not work for me, rockets, propellers, none of it will work, I can't figure out why
bug-reports 2021-08-26 18:33:43 yes other blocks work, I can get a heli to work if I only use motors
bug-reports 2021-08-26 18:33:54 I haven't checked much other stuff
bug-reports 2021-08-26 18:34:21 but weapons work
bug-reports 2021-08-26 18:34:33 its just rockets propellers and the like refusing commands
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:52:15 so torpedoes are limited to 1x1 studs?
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:52:31 why?
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:52:51 you can easily make it guided
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:53:52 is there a reason why the devs don't make a larger map?
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:54:56 it would be insanely easy to make a quick update
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:55:16 giving us a decent ammount of water so we can have actual sub v sub duels
events-chat 2022-01-09 01:56:11 it's roblox, how hard is it to expand the map?
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:05:53 just waiting to see some of the ship designs people come up with
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:09:11 why no subs?
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:11:09 gun subs are maximum cringe
events-chat 2022-01-09 02:11:26 but they are vulnerable to a literal block of glass
events-chat 2022-01-09 18:34:36 damn the last few boats look awesome
events-chat 2022-01-09 19:20:36 can we put disconnectors around torpedoes for aesthetic reasons
general 2022-01-11 00:20:38 whenever I use disconnectors anything I release gets bugged
general 2022-01-11 00:20:46 how do I fix it
general 2022-01-11 00:20:57 parts either just stay in the air
