general 2023-07-07 11:23:23 I get that with freecam it would be like getting rid of the fun of trying to straggle problems like motors being dumb but at the same time it saves soo much time to not have that kind of problem at all
general 2023-07-07 11:24:24 I swear, i always see people argue here ðŸ’€
general 2023-07-07 11:25:25 God

general 2023-07-07 11:26:21 Dont get why instead of a script they could do tutorials on yt

general 2023-07-19 07:00:26 It doesnt do that
general 2023-07-19 07:01:04 Everytime i try to lauch my build it forces me into a first person camera view
general 2023-07-19 07:01:21 Nope
general 2023-07-19 07:01:40 And it removes my Movement Joystick aswell when i dismount
general 2023-07-19 07:01:57 It havent done things like this
general 2023-07-19 07:02:22 Im on mobile, but yes
general 2023-07-19 07:03:34 I see, im going to bind a camera to a button for it to force me out of fp
general 2023-07-19 07:04:02 Oh yea btw you need to talk alot to get img perm right?
general 2023-07-19 07:04:05 I forgor
general 2023-07-19 07:05:02 It does force me out of fp but my joystick aint appearing

general 2023-07-19 07:06:28 Why own a CBR or CBX 150 when you could modify a SupraX to have a 150 Engine
