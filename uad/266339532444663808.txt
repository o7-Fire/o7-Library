creations-chat 2020-03-08 03:57:05 What's the problem
creations-chat 2020-05-15 23:24:17 Four-banger moment.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:20:39 In what way does it suck
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:20:47 It can actually be an advantage given I've fought laggy people before.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:21:14 Yo.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:21:21 I'm not actually gonna sign up.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:21:35 Hope you win though.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:22:04 Do people freeze for you
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:22:06 Do you have bad ping
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:22:22 There are 3 types of laggy people I've fought in the past.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:23:01 Even though I've heard it's a double-edged sword.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:23:43 A lot of cutters for a weapon that has barely any bite.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:24:06 And it can't self-right either.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:24:59 Gamma 9 but with flails on the sides and exposed wheels.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:25:44 Yeah.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:25:54 If it's not in the rules, feel free to exploit it in one way or the other.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:26:09 It's faster paced than you think.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:26:46 Thwackbots or meltybrains such as Nuts 2 (Robot Wars) will benefit more from flails if the bot is 2-wheeled rather than 4-wheeled.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:27:01 You'll essentially be spinning in place hoping the enemy runs into you.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:31:23 I'm assuming people don't really use cutters that often around here.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:31:28 Also, that's false.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:32:03 I guess.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:32:14 But other than shredders and using cutters as ranged weapons via magnets.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:32:40 1x7 beams can stall if placed perpendicular.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:32:53 Are you making something for <#917397949938548736>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:33:18 There's only a size limit so I don't see why you'd use 1x7 beams.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:33:38 Though a blockier bot would be more frame heavy.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:34:53 I think it's 1v1s.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:35:06 Yeah, 1v1 tournament.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:35:13 I dunnoi.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:35:15 dunno*
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:35:19 Is it single or double elimination
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:35:24 That's my question.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:35:32 If it's double, you get another chance.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:35:43 What kind of bot are you going for
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:36:22 Drills is pretty nasty from my experience.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:36:28 Some people dislike them.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:36:39 Though drums can a good counter.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:36:42 can be*
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:36:54 I'm aware.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:37:06 If the bot was faster, it'd do more damage.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:37:10 Does it have any ballasts
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:37:28 Is the flip tool allowed in <#917397949938548736>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:37:40 Add in ballasts.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:37:48 My bots are usually around 3% ballasts.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:37:52 3-5%
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:38:04 Since your bot has a shredding weapon, it'd be best to use ballasts.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:38:11 So you can shred better and have more pushing power.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:38:35 Less resistance = Better for shredders
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:38:49 I call it "resistance"
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:38:51 But eh.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:38:56 What's the weapon
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:39:09 Bar spinners are really easy to make since they're just rectangles.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:39:21 Drums are also easy to make.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:39:37 I haven't seen a sword BattleBot so far in PC.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:39:47 It's just mostly spinners.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:40:19 Bots with a weapon like a hammer or hammer saw can double as a weapon and a self-righting mechanism.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:40:25 So you can use the sword idea to your advantage.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:40:34 Though, I wouldn't strike the sword directly into spinners.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:41:57 lmfao
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:41:57 Me and Tub probably.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:42:08 Though my bots aren't your standard type of BattleBot you'd see.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:42:26 Like Don Luciano is legit just a work of art at this point.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:42:44 Don Luciano 2 was only made because I wanted to make a magnum opus.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:42:49 Nah.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:43:04 I'm gonna stall and talk to people related to BattleBots I suppose.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:43:31 Everyone's opting for wheels and I'm not surprised in the slightest.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:44:10 People aren't considering wheelguards or srimechs.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:44:17 But hey, we're one of the only few people that do this.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:44:37 Motors are legit weakpoints in every bot.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:44:46 Strength in what way
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:45:04 Why not both
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:45:23 I have a good amount of configurations that take both into account.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:45:29 Wait.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:45:35 Speaking of configurations, are they even allowed here
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:45:59 People are gonna have one type of weapon and one type of bot for their opponent.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:46:01 And vice versa.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:46:28 It'd be nice to see Bombshell or Ghost Raptor versatility.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:46:32 Yup.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:46:46 My biggest bot's armour is around 9 blocks thick but I have an entire ribcage sticking out.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:46:56 I was hoping for Bronco to be in Season 6.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:47:07 Too bad Inertia Labs dropped it.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:48:00 For a 25x25x30 bot, I'd say ~1600 blocks is a good count.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:49:09 As in how long the rounds last.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:49:26 Typically, Plane Crazy BattleBots fight on the rails.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:49:45 Rails is currently the best.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:49:47 Nah.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:49:57 Rails which is like a good amount from the airport.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:50:03 It's ride by spawn.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:50:05 "ride"
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:50:06 right*
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:50:16 It's to the left if you're facing the canyon.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:50:34 You guys might be fighting there.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:50:36 Might.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:51:22 Yup.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:51:28 But getting stuck on the rails is..
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:51:31 Something else.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:51:36 Yo I got image perms.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:53:18 Usually, bots tend to go as low as possible.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:53:28 So having big wheels typically isn't the problem.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:53:32 Unless it's a bot like HUGE.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:53:38 Where the wheels are well, huge.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:53:58 I can legit submit a bot rn in <#917397949938548736> but I won't.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:54:02 That is true.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:54:07 But durability is gonna do you well in the long run.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:54:22 Most of the weapons so far aren't shredders.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:54:30 I might be wrong on that but eh.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:54:56 Who do you think is gonna win so far in <#917397949938548736>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:55:13 I'd say maybe the Tombstone one if its bar was thicker.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:55:23 Good shit.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:55:41 Yours can win if it had ballasts and if it were faster.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:55:49 And forks maybe.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:56:12 Here's a bot I built like 4 months ago.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:56:16 It's decent.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:56:24 I build big too.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:56:29 I got smaller bots though.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:57:05 This is what I mean by forks.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:57:11 Those pointy things at the front.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:57:25 Because they have exposed wheels, you can take advantage.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:57:38 I don't think I have a bot with exposed wheels.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:57:50 You can use Motor 2 to force it downward.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:57:57 With Servo and Toggle.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:58:45 If they don't allow flipping, make sure to have a self-righting mechanism.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:58:59 The Flip tool is typically banned in Plane Crazy BattleBots leagues.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:59:23 I guess we can use it if they didn't say anything about it. <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:59:37 No rule about Gravity Slider either.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:59:44 Or ballast tanks.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:59:45 Or.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:59:53 Yeah, those rules are easily exploitable.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:00:07 Sinks I think.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:00:14 If you have a lot of ballast tanks, you basically have something immovable.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:00:18 Well, nearly immovable.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:00:28 It's gonna fling the other person a mile.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:00:31 That's for sure.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:00:50 YEAHHH
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:00:54 DRAGGIN HAS ENTERED
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:00:56 Let's get it.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:01:09 An underwater BattleBot event would be really creative.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:01:10 ngl
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:01:39 Y'all are really gonna struggle with Draggin.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:01:49 I needed bullshit to win against it.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:02:24 It is stated that folding is allowed so go nuts.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:02:43 <@!297120728342331392> I like your BattleBot concept.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:02:44 Good shit.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:03:16 Yikes.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:06:59 I'm legit gonna have to talk to the person who made these rules bruh.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:07:17 No ballast limit, no ban of ballast tanks, etc.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:08:04 Your bot doesn't scrape the ground so it's not gonna have that problem.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:08:27 But your bot will struggle against horizontals.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:08:31 *cough*
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:08:34 Like Draggin.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:08:49 It is scary.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:09:07 Me winning against it is like 50/50
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:09:12 Its wheels are gonna be hard to reach.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:09:19 Plus if you do scrape at them, they're durable.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:09:22 Nah.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:09:23 Just wide.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:09:29 Like really wide.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:09:34 Baseplate wide.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:09:46 And none of the bots come close to its size.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:10:21 Also to mention it's giant bar spinner.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:10:25 its*
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:10:40 This bot of mine is in the same size class as it believe it or not.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:10:51 Yeah.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:11:19 It is.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:11:22 It's 9-1.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:12:09 I'd make use of the 25x25x30 space.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:12:11 You're gonna really need it.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:12:15 Like actually.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:12:18 No.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:12:29 I beat Draggin before with a much bigger bot.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:12:35 But I only beat it because it was unfairly flung.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:12:37 Like 3 times.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:12:44 15 cutters is a lot.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:12:49 Just make a drum.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:12:52 Or two drums.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:13:10 I wouldn't use wheels.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:13:11 imo
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:14:55 He can.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:15:09 But I'd use blocks for armour since they're way thicker than a ladder.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:15:44 There are a lot of things I would change on that bot but I'd be nagging you.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:16:02 It's his bot. I can't force him to do anything.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:16:22 I can see that working.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:17:04 Orange, are you rooting for a bot in S6 or nah
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:17:09 I'm rooting for Gigabyte and Fusion.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:17:27 That's a'ight.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:18:09 There are two bots irl in BattleBots that have exposed wheels but the wheels don't get punctured or destroyed.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:18:35 Whiplash and Black Dragon.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:18:44 Nice.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:19:09 Yes. Those would be wedge flippers.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:19:18 Like Apollo or Eruption from Robot Wars.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:19:47 But they'd have a lot of surface contact with the ground so.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:20:32 Hopefully someone rolls up in this.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:21:01 So are you making a shuffler? A walker?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:21:19 Are thrusters banned
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:21:39 These rules <:OkBuddy:652567204453154816>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:22:30 You know what to exploit.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:22:46 Is someone gonna have a bot filled with ballast tanks
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:22:50 That's technically allowed.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:23:04 Immovable bot.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:23:11 Obese.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:23:16 600 pound life.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:23:39 <:thoink:657279634563399720>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:24:09 I don't know if ballast tank bots can move.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:24:12 I never tested it before.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:24:27 A'ight.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:26:10 Mad lad.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:26:17 Aw shit.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:27:22 Usually they're eliminated when they're unable to show controlled or translational movement.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:27:29 Or if they're just out of the arena.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:27:51 Hopefully the host knows what he's doing.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:28:03 'Cause after 10-15 seconds and if you're not seen moving, the countdown starts.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:28:47 His plan: have a giant spinner filled to the brim with ballast tanks.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:28:56 ez win.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:29:18 Dog, who made these rules <:OkBuddy:652567204453154816>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:36:04 If it didn't have ballast tanks, it would be way way weaker.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:36:16 Also no self-righting mechanism.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:36:26 -1
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:36:45 What weapon are you using
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:37:36 <#621452102618578964>
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:37:45 hyperbit posted them.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:39:52 >asks for suggestions
>avatar get shit on
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:40:26 This gotta be the strongest one.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:40:52 Too strong
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:41:03 Wing adds 9e9 downforce.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:41:14 Impossible to be flung.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:42:46 Nope. Just a size limit.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:43:04 Cube solos.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:43:06 Trust.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:43:47 This is about to be your BattleBot.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:43:49 lmfao
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:44:01 Cutters are the only PVP weapon allowed.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:44:23 Chaos.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:44:37 It's his hat probably.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 22:59:33 Invincible to flippers? When the ballast beam limit is 1?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:00:41 That's called driving inverted.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:00:55 It doesn't make you necessarily immune to flippers, it just makes an srimech useless in your case.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:01:31 May we see so we can clear the confusion
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:01:52 A hammer or an axe isn't gonna counter flippers.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:02:02 If anything; a drum would be the most fit for countering flippers.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:02:09 No.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:02:24 In what way
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:02:41 So you're gonna be grounded against a flipper?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:02:54 Does your bot even have low ground clearance
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:03:05 Or will it have low ground clearance
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:03:12 A'ight you're done.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:03:14 Legit.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:03:37 If you're not lower than a flipper, then what do you think would happen
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:03:50 What design did you see
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:04:08 Nuts 2?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:04:22 So like a thwackbot?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:04:40 Ohhh
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:04:43 He's talking about Gabriel.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:04:57 Nah he said two large wheels.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:05:11 Is this it
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:05:51 So it was a blue bot, two large wheels, bar
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:05:53 Wait.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:06:05 This one?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:07:23 All I know is that he's talking about a torque reaction bot.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:09:59 Hmm.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:10:07 So you saw it on UK, right
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:11:35 Will the axes serve as the legs
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:11:50 Like this?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:12:16 A'ight.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:12:29 Ohh.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:12:30 I see.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:12:40 So it'll double as a weapon and a leg?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:12:47 Good concept.
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 23:13:51 Nah he said it was bigger.
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 02:23:45 <@!609921899585077296> Dope Comedy Central Nightmare.
general 2021-12-09 06:32:57 What type of rap
general 2021-12-09 06:33:09 'Cause boom bap rap slaps.
general 2021-12-09 06:33:11 Oh.
general 2021-12-09 06:33:16 Never heard of that.
general 2021-12-09 06:33:25 You don't know MF Doom?
general 2021-12-09 06:34:00 Gang Starr does boom bap if I recall correctly.
general 2021-12-09 06:34:05 What do you even listen to
general 2021-12-09 06:34:27 Shouldn't take too long to name some artists, right
general 2021-12-09 06:35:00 Who's the person btw
general 2021-12-09 06:35:13 And what type of Eurobeat
general 2021-12-09 06:35:33 🧢
general 2021-12-09 06:36:10 What
general 2021-12-09 06:36:30 A'ight. I think it's time to stop talking to you ig.
general 2021-12-09 06:36:54 Status symbol.
general 2021-12-09 06:37:12 There are actually good NFTs other than the typical monkey or lion ones.
general 2021-12-09 06:37:59 You don't say
general 2021-12-09 06:38:32 "guys, things come in different colours"
general 2021-12-09 06:38:33 No way.
general 2021-12-09 06:38:39 Such a discovery.
general 2021-12-09 06:38:56 Funny number.
plane-crazy 2021-12-10 20:52:49 Warhead moment.
plane-crazy 2021-12-10 20:56:19 4
plane-crazy 2021-12-10 20:59:31 9e9
general 2021-12-12 19:36:34 Hammers aren't hard to counter.
general 2021-12-12 19:37:20 You don't say
general 2021-12-12 19:38:00 The cutters on the hammer itself are stationary which is a bad thing.
general 2021-12-12 19:38:12 It's possible he could have had motors inside of the hammer to make it more AIDS.
general 2021-12-12 19:38:28 But a low torque spinner with good bite should disarm it.
general 2021-12-12 19:39:45 Like there are so many counters to his bot it's insane.
general 2021-12-12 19:40:14 And I'm talking about practical means.
general 2021-12-12 19:42:10 It was a single-elimination and only one round.
general 2021-12-12 19:42:21 It was pretty anticlimactic.
general 2021-12-12 19:42:32 If only Draggin participated. 😔
general 2021-12-12 19:43:52 No. That's literally what the bot was called.
general 2021-12-12 19:47:40 That's a hammer saw.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 00:50:18 It's terrible.
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 00:50:55 Why are there springs coming from the engine bay
creations-chat 2022-01-02 21:50:50 Why are there so many cutters on the spinner
Also, keep the wheelguards unless you want a horizontal swiping them.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 21:53:52 Plus, the ears are pointless if the bot can't drive inverted and the wedge is also pointless since it can easily come off, hinders the spinner's opportunity to hit and provides little to no ground game against other bots.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 21:57:19 If you want to have good ground game but still have an armoured wedge, I'd recommend using half wedges (wedges) and half wedge downs (half blocks). I'd also recommend using triangle wedges and triangle wedge blocks.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 22:00:00 For the part of the wedge that touches the ground, use Ice as the material. Does your bot have a self-righting mechanism of any kind
plane-crazy 2022-01-03 01:24:36 A crossbow?
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:02:30 S2 Bombshell is a modular bot S4 isn't.
events-chat 2022-05-04 03:27:45 Did you make Switchback's arm thicker yet
events-chat 2022-05-04 03:29:01 Tombstone might or might not be comp.
events-chat 2022-05-04 03:29:28 It always sucked in a competitive setting.
events-chat 2022-05-04 03:29:45 In PC that is.
events-chat 2022-05-04 04:06:46 How big is the buff
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:26:22 Saws were never designed to punt unlike discs.
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:26:46 In what way
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:27:02 Them spinning doesn't equate to them working the same lmfao.
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:27:18 Bars = Disc because cutters!!!
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:27:39 Hey guys. If something has cutters on it, then that means they function the same way.
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:28:09 LOL
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:29:16 Uh, no they won't. The cutters on a disc are less as opposed to a saw.
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:29:52 Have you ever done BattleBots in Plane Crazy
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:30:15 Because it's obvious you haven't because "oh my god cutters means a saw and a disc are the same"
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:30:46 ^
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:32:41 Imagine using "whitename" as an insult.
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:32:59 You pull zero girls with that yee yee insult
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:34:16 By your logic, these are the same, right
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:34:47 Because they have cutters doesn't mean they're the same weapon, bro.
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:35:28 Mr. Obvious chimes in, woo
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:36:14 Playing PC doesn't equate to BattleBots knowledge.
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:43:20 One has less bite and was meant to cut. Not hard to comprehend.
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:44:07 You're not even situated with PC BattleBots 🗿
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:44:33 Never have I seen a saw be used as a ramming weapon. 💀
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:45:03 When was the last time I saw a saw on a PC BattleBot? Never
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:45:27 Not really. The league I'm in mostly uses it as overhead weapons.
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:45:44 I meant stationary saw. mb
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:46:33 So you said the Tombstone guy was allowed to break the rules, right
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:46:51 How far can he break it
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:47:30 Imagine if he works with 12 beams while everyone works with 1 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
events-chat 2022-05-04 17:51:47 That's literally the point. You basically just summarised it.
events-chat 2022-05-04 17:52:10 Who
events-chat 2022-05-04 17:52:32 He literally just proved us right by pointing out that saws do more DPS.
events-chat 2022-05-04 17:53:12 asked for your input
events-chat 2022-05-04 18:01:08 He's probably gonna have half of his bot be ballast beams or something
events-chat 2022-05-04 18:03:22 It'd probably be a shitpost if he started flinging <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
events-chat 2022-05-04 18:04:46 The submissions are like decent so far.
events-chat 2022-05-04 18:05:10 The Bite Force is really good imo
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:21:39 Season 5 Mad Catter.
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:21:56 The one you posted is Season 6.
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:30:13 Is that the Judge
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:30:36 Didn't it get bodied by Tombstone
