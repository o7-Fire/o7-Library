general 2020-06-26 15:51:08 why a block
general 2020-06-26 15:51:23 why not add the actual torpedo instead
general 2020-06-26 15:51:39 ok that works
general 2020-06-26 15:51:52 but wouldnt it be kind akward
general 2020-06-26 15:52:12 bc u would have to make the torpedo deploy a specific way
general 2020-06-26 15:52:57 yeah
general 2020-06-26 15:53:07 why not add a block with a torpedo mounted on it
general 2020-06-26 15:53:19 that would be way easier to work with
general 2020-06-26 15:53:31 since the torpedo is under the block like the rockets
general 2020-06-26 15:54:20 why not make both types
general 2020-06-26 15:55:12 Im wondering what to do since I have no more train ideas
general 2020-06-26 15:55:34 nah
general 2020-06-26 15:55:42 i mean as in a type of locomotive
general 2020-06-26 15:55:50 like idk a FL9

general 2020-06-26 15:57:56 bruh
general 2020-06-26 15:58:25 chuggington doesnt have an FL9
general 2020-06-26 15:58:35 Wilson is an EMD F7
general 2020-06-26 15:59:08 bruh
general 2020-06-26 15:59:22 idek why they made the F units originally for freight
general 2020-06-26 15:59:37 like what was the point if Santa Fe was around
general 2020-06-26 16:01:22 No
general 2020-06-26 16:01:32 Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe
general 2020-06-26 16:01:44 Which they also made a catchy song for it too
general 2020-06-26 16:01:59 Just like Cargo Moving People for N&W
general 2020-06-26 16:06:36 Actually imma make a GE U50
general 2020-06-26 16:06:50 It's the easiest out of the 8 axle locomotives
general 2020-06-26 16:10:13 U shouldn't be surprised
general 2020-06-26 16:10:24 Ethan made a drifting tofu delivery train
general 2020-06-26 16:10:38 And yes that is how we deliver tofu in alabama
creations-chat 2020-06-26 23:40:41 WIP Train idk what type of GE loco to put on it
creations-chat 2020-06-26 23:41:51 Surprisingly it doesn't lag
creations-chat 2020-06-26 23:42:08 And its pretty simple
creations-chat 2020-06-26 23:42:34 It just looks complicated bc I used disconnecter peices
creations-chat 2020-06-26 23:42:56 Besides that he thanorb is right
creations-chat 2020-06-26 23:43:54 It takes corners surprisingly well too
creations-chat 2020-06-26 23:44:59 It's bc of the distance between each wheel per truck
creations-chat 2020-06-26 23:45:27 If I used solid blocks while having 3 block distance between each wheel I would derail
creations-chat 2020-06-26 23:45:55 If I use suspension I can corner better and tackle hills way easier

general 2020-12-14 18:03:37 Or pack more punch that a P47?
general 2020-12-14 18:03:58 The A10 only attacks ground targets actually
general 2020-12-14 18:04:04 And It destroys tanks
general 2020-12-14 18:04:33 Then theres the AC 130 that has A FUCKING ARTILLERY CANON IN IT
general 2020-12-14 18:05:25 Then theres the F82 that has 14 BROWNING MACHINE GUNS
general 2020-12-14 18:06:04 Actually the B29 is most modern

general 2020-12-14 18:10:02 The YMC 130 is the X Cub on Steroids
general 2020-12-14 18:10:44 Actually the B29 can carry heavier payloads and fly faster than a Lancaster
general 2020-12-14 18:10:50 Plus its more durable
general 2020-12-14 18:10:55 Has more GUNS
general 2020-12-14 18:11:31 Your Limey guns wont beat Browning 50 calls

general 2020-12-14 18:12:14 True true
general 2020-12-14 18:12:47 But not only that is the fact the B29 could fly higher but bc it was rushed into action It didnt really reach the full potential
general 2020-12-14 18:12:55 Yep
general 2020-12-14 18:13:38 XB70 says other wise
