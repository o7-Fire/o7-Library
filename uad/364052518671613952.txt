general 2021-09-30 09:18:04 hello
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 11:10:06 is the map going to updated?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 11:10:24 when? how?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 11:10:57 crazy plane 2?!
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 11:11:15 is there an official announcement?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 11:11:27 can you please send a link or something to it?
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 11:11:32 amazing
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 11:11:52 alright
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 20:40:48 how do you get the blue fire looking thing on the vehicle?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:52:04 imagine you could make builds and give it to your friends
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:52:14 i would 100% do that and fly around together
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:52:24 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:52:52 maybe even sell builds for money to buy cosmetic upgrades?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:53:07 maybe a currency can be introduced
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:53:46 bought creations should have their own section in loading saves and can't be overwritten
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 11:53:56 in my opinion
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:04:45 does anyone know if gamepasses are also transferred onto plane crazy 2?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:05:15 has it been officially announced anywhere?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:05:21 the transferring of gamepasses
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:05:41 "things" includes gamepasses?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:05:52 if the new game has the same or similar gamepasses i hope they get transferred too
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:06:01 great
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:06:23 space???
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:06:31 so you can enter orbit and leave the atmosphere??
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:06:48 that's so cool
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:08:43 teleporting border?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:09:07 that would be cool if the infinite distance didn't lead anywhere
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:24:13 does gravity slider work in public servers? and does it affect only your build?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:24:50 ok
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:27:42 should i buy jetpack gamepass
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:29:08 is the jetpack gamepass worth it? is there any down sides to it?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:29:55 what?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:30:14 okay
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:32:13 wow
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:32:23 i just need it to fly around tall builds and the map
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:32:41 how fast does the jetpack go?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:33:46 alright, thanks
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 16:35:20 i basically need the jetpack to move around easier
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 16:59:19 hello
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 16:59:28 will our game passes be transferred over to plane crazy 2?
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 16:59:30 does anyone know?
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 16:59:48 100%?
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 17:00:13 yep, i was just asking
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 17:00:17 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 17:04:09 hey where in <#529858892075761694> does it say that
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 17:15:00 does gravity slider only work in private servers
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 17:26:38 or public also
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 17:27:53 so public and private
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 17:28:02 i thought it was only private
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 17:28:42 so in private it is free
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 17:28:54 in public you need the game pass
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 17:29:06 is that correct
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 17:52:39 how is that possible
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 17:56:58 so should i buy the gravity slider
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 20:31:49 hello
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 20:32:21 does it say anywhere if game passes are being transferred to pc2? i can't find it written anywhere
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 20:45:17 i forgot i asked this question a year ago
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 20:45:19 my bad
