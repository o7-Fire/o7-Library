plane-crazy 2022-09-12 03:19:08 ong
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 12:55:36 does it turn well and dont wobble? it looks like there are too many control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 12:58:41 try doing the classic motor2 wings for turning and delete the control surfaces you dont need, maybe it could work better
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 12:59:13 the wings with it are easy
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 12:59:47 LOL
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:00:54 keep some control surfaces that you can control with mouse so that they keep making the plane fly straight
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:01:29 oh, it usually works with my builds
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:02:01 then put the mouse a bit more down or up
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:02:21 200 IQ moment fr
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:03:08 just move the mouse based on the situation
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:03:58 pull down then
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:04:20 as i said, move the mouse based on the situation
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:06:48 using both mouse and keyboard is not such a big deal
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:07:36 depends on how big the plane is and how many control surfaces it have
plane-crazy 2022-09-12 13:07:52 wait
