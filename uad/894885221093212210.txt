plane-crazy 2022-12-27 13:34:46 ?
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 13:36:03 Pc2 suggestion: Crash physics so I can commit
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:31:06 Gyroscope+ body thing with thrusters:
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:32:51 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:33:09 true,
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:33:21 Plus itâ€™s fragile.
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:33:54 So you kinda need to hide the folding around blocks
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:34:54 Bruh I already have an outdated spaceship and I am planning to build another one using gyroscopes
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:35:42 how to send photos
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:41:48 True
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:41:52 nvm
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:41:55 some may abuse it
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:43:02 We just need rotate, resize and a block that acts like motorlock but easier.
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:43:07 Not PC2
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:47:14 Damn
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:47:47 Instead of having a goddamn new game, why not just add the features that are going to be in pc2 in pc ðŸ’€
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:47:55 Like wtf is the logic behind this?
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:48:02 It couldâ€™ve been done by now.
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:48:44 I mean, if you donâ€™t mean to offend anyone then sure
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:49:17 Of you donâ€™t mean to offend 9/11 then sure
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:49:31 But itâ€™s you mean it your just rude.

plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:51:00 I am started to use motorlock in my builds
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:51:17 But mostly ro-scale or small builds

plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:52:01 Is that a 9/11 replica?
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:52:38 Bro Most of my builds are just trash
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:52:55 Only a few looks decent or use motorlock

plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:53:27 Concept on a new spaceship design

plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:53:55 Motorlock is mostly useless
plane-crazy 2023-06-03 16:54:09 I use motorlock for details or compact designs
