plane-crazy 2021-12-20 01:42:30 Oh god
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 01:47:55 Imagine being warned
general 2022-01-21 01:44:32 none
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 02:11:49 Random Question: What kind of building should I build? (Like houses or skyscrapers, no planes, boats, or thing of that sort, I have too many of them already.)
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 02:12:50 why not. I might make the bunker in it too.
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 02:13:08 neither do I
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 02:14:06 I'll suffer and die but maybe so
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 02:15:31 it has to be 414 blocks tall
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 18:19:28 I need ideas
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 18:19:30 Give now
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 18:35:09 amazing

plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:17:06 Roblox physics is just weird
general 2022-04-06 03:33:17 what
general 2022-04-06 03:34:51 Random question, (Context: Some friends of mine would like to mess around and have our own "UN" for Plane Crazy.) Do you think people would actually join a discord server for it?
general 2022-04-06 03:35:34 United Nations?
general 2022-04-06 03:36:08 We're just planning it, but maybe so
general 2022-04-06 03:36:23 Oh sweet, it isn't a stupid idea.
general 2022-04-06 03:37:22 More like an alternate universe of plane crazy nations.
general 2022-04-06 03:37:46 respectable.
general 2022-04-06 03:38:08 good point, more or less 20.
general 2022-04-06 03:39:06 somewhat i guess
general 2022-04-06 03:40:50 lol true
general 2022-06-11 14:42:36 heheheha
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 14:43:28 personally, I'd say that 0.5 cylinders would be nice, but they wouldn't have too much use.
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 14:43:48 Closest thing to that would we the sparklers
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 14:44:13 and those fulfill the job just as well as a 0.5 cylinder would.
bot-central 2022-06-11 14:44:27 !rank
bot-central 2022-06-11 14:44:32 nice.
bot-central 2022-06-11 14:44:49 almost there
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 15:02:01 I know, thats true, I'm just talking to Rajendra. But, 1.5 cylinders would be nice to tell the truth.
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 15:07:09 I guess he’s got a point there
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 15:07:57 Yep
general 2022-06-12 15:10:08 Good question, idk. I can’t really talk but good point
general 2022-06-12 15:10:52 Ya’ll listening to New Vegas tunes?
