plane-crazy 2018-09-25 22:33:26 Question, for the bombardier role can your plane be converted from another one of your builds.
plane-crazy 2018-09-25 23:22:22 Some of the water in the game is missing, i know because my submarine was sucked into an underwater air bubble
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 00:48:07 And trees
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 00:48:22 And maybe even a destroyable bridge like in simple planes
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 02:20:28 Ive dropped at least 30 projectiles since i converted my recon plane to a bomber
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 13:50:57 Apparently only three people have been able to make a submarine

plane-crazy 2018-09-26 15:00:53 And it actually tilts when diving/rising
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 15:02:50 (The original version of the sub was able to fly)
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 15:03:03 (I still have the save for it)
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 15:07:10 And my robloxian doesnt drown on the outside of the sub when underwater
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 15:19:56 I know how to make a workinng steering wheel using a normal wheel, a bit big tho
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 15:20:26 I made an old style jeep using that
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 16:38:06 <@252094891448860673> "before disconnectors" Were you able to submerge when the lake was just a smol swamp?
plane-crazy 2018-09-26 16:38:47 And my submarine is able to sustain a submerged depth for 10 minutes without touching the seafloor

plane-crazy 2018-12-06 16:19:37 When i got my new computer and tried out the ratte on it, i saw noticable differences. It was way faster than on the old computer, the main turret turns a bit too fast, and the scout vehicle exits faster

general 2018-12-10 14:38:22 Chaos
general 2018-12-10 14:39:05 If i hadn't have grabbed the enemy flag and captured it my team would have lost

general 2018-12-10 14:40:16 I mean, it was just chaos everywhere
general 2018-12-10 14:41:03 The enemy only capped our flag once, but we werent able to cap it because the people on our team who had the flag would just stay at the enemy flag post
general 2018-12-10 14:41:36 When i got the enemy flag i ran like the wind to our flag, paying no attention on the battle happening around me
general 2018-12-10 14:41:51 I got it that time, causing the match to be a stalemate
general 2018-12-10 14:43:02 And the enemy team had all the op dudes
general 2018-12-10 14:44:07 If you are wondering what my loadout was: it was a stock mac 10, no attachments and no skin, glock 18 suppressed with half ring sight and g stock, with a machete
general 2018-12-10 14:44:58 That was my most competitive match of all time, i think i even went insane mode for a bit
general 2018-12-10 14:46:29 No aimbotters were involved, but i found a glitch where if you reset by your flag post when the flag is still there, you get free xp for recovering the flag for some reason
general 2018-12-10 14:46:55 I had tried it twice more to confirm if it wasnt someone stealing the flag, and it was a glitch

plane-crazy 2018-12-23 20:54:51 can you guys imagine how hard it is to make a roadrunner in the game?

plane-crazy 2018-12-27 18:10:39 when ski's are removed, do the creations that have them get removed too?
plane-crazy 2018-12-27 18:11:12 that will be useful for making X-15s
plane-crazy 2018-12-27 18:11:32 wait, you can't build with skis once they are removes?
plane-crazy 2018-12-27 18:11:38 removed*
plane-crazy 2018-12-27 18:13:14 question, why do you have to look for the skis instead of automatically getting them?
plane-crazy 2018-12-27 18:16:20 guys
bug-reports 2018-12-27 18:16:59 you can't build with wheels or any other item thats not in a sub-menu

plane-crazy 2019-01-12 23:32:26 is the tips jar just a decorative thing?
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 23:32:32 or does it do something
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 23:34:39 what are special guns?
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 23:35:16 thats not technically true
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 23:35:26 if you can aim high enough they can shoot pretty far
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 23:35:39 i tested it with the old tankbuster
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 16:26:52 Did anyone build a boat that can go faster than 100 sps?
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 16:27:29 Im talking about in the water
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 16:27:57 Naval max speed, not airbourne max speed
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 16:30:00 I built a hydroplane that can go 200 before it starts to try and dive into the water
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 16:30:07 I even got it up to 220
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 16:32:39 When trying to turn it at high speed, it acts realistic where it actually tries to flip itself over (although this was an unintentional feature)
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 16:46:46 I put a tailfin at the back of my hydroplane, it is considerably more stable
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 16:47:01 Can go up to 300 before flipping now
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 16:47:11 And it can turn better
creations-chat 2019-01-13 16:54:36 https://youtu.be/b94tSA-IZjM Not the first test run, but it is currently the most successful.
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 16:57:04 https://youtu.be/b94tSA-IZjM currently the latest test run of the hydroplane
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 16:57:23 not my fault
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 16:57:27 blame youtube
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 16:57:33 no its not
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 16:57:41 i did earlier
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 16:57:57 stop quoting my typos
plane-crazy 2019-01-13 16:58:27 and i fixed the title typo, youtube just doesn't want to load

general 2020-11-19 04:37:29 which is rare
general 2020-11-19 04:38:06 me
general 2020-11-19 04:38:18 i was the second person ever to make a sub in the game i believe
general 2020-11-19 04:38:44 it was one of the old color roles
general 2020-11-19 04:39:02 i also have floating fortress
general 2020-11-19 04:39:09 too bad i don't have the ship i got it with
general 2020-11-19 04:55:00 i look in contests info and i see that two of the three winners are subnautica creations
general 2020-11-19 04:55:08 and only one of them is identified
general 2020-11-19 04:55:22 the second one should be identified as the precursor quarantine enforcement unit
general 2020-11-19 04:55:37 aka big gun that fires laser more powerful than nuke
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 05:36:23 i just though of a possible weapon that could work really well with submarines in naval combat
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 05:36:27 rising charges
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 05:37:09 it could because just about anything else doesn't work underwater
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 05:37:16 torpedoes have to be brick built
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 05:39:34 i think submarines will actually be pretty decent in naval combat now
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 05:39:58 the only way to counter them is with depth charges as missiles and fireworks don't travel underwater and only explode
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 06:14:29 that moment when your sub gets torn in half by an incident involving testing of a new weapon type be like: "Guess i'll die"

the-dump 2020-11-19 08:24:37 ah yes, polishing the bread
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 08:32:20 sneeky peeky of my latest creation
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 08:33:14 look really closely and you can make out a shape under the periscope
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 08:35:25 fine since you want to argue i'll give you a better image
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:42:01 I was about to post my most recent creation but apparently i can't post more than one image per post.

creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:57:22 should i change the slate floor for a metal flooring?
creations-chat 2020-11-19 10:02:11 if anybody wants some context as to how old the sub i based it off of is: its older than the paint tool, and would need two rack mounts on wheels to be able to move it into the water, due to there being no ability to spawn there at the time.
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 11:11:39 the sub waits silently under the waves of the deep for its prey, ready to pounce at a moment's notice. any wrong move will spell doom for the powerful, but weak predator.
creations-chat 2020-11-20 23:03:32 I kinda like the effort you put into it, the rear turrets look extremely ugly though
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 23:10:07 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/516982083416227840/20181126_184423-1.jpg i can bet you nobody here even remembers this thing
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 23:11:06 its the second turbosub after I had saved over the first one due to there only being eight save slots at the time
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 23:17:04 keep in mind both this
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 23:17:27 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/516982083416227840/20181126_184423-1.jpg and this are the same creation, in the same save slot, with only minor modifications.
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 23:17:58 the most notable of the modifications being the replacement of the old downwards thrust diving with ballast tanks.
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 23:19:32 this sub can go to around 35 basic speed units underwater
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 23:20:09 which is slower than the current turbosub, which i based off of this sub, current goes up to 40 basic speed units underwater.

general 2020-12-02 02:14:19 i had my color role for a really long time
general 2020-12-02 02:14:27 a REALLY long time
general 2020-12-02 02:14:37 like i got it back when color roles were first added
general 2020-12-02 02:14:57 there is more proof that i'm an old user as i have the floating fortress role
creations-chat 2020-12-02 02:16:29 should i keep the default material cockpit or replace it with a glass one?
creations-chat 2020-12-02 02:18:15 yes moment
creations-chat 2020-12-02 02:20:06 the fighter built out of a missile lore is actually based off of the fact that the original craft was built to be a missile, not a fighter, but i built a variant of it to be a fighter because of how manuverable it was
creations-chat 2020-12-02 02:28:07 i see shelly and i can only think of polnareiff
creations-chat 2020-12-02 08:16:36 I wanted to build a vehicle that looked like it could actually have a useable lava gun on it, basically building a vehicle around the gun, so that it looks actually plausable
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 17:42:36 i remember playing in a private server when someone tried to get us to dogfight and destroy his "drifting plane"
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 17:42:47 and it turned like it was drifting
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 17:42:53 i figured out WHY it does this
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 17:43:00 its the lack of a tailfin
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:07:19 these aren't shredders
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:07:44 what about the kids who don't have VIP servers
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:07:54 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:08:06 they don't even turn, they just change directions
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:08:16 they are built to have omni directional movement
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:08:19 hence the name
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:08:37 i first encountered him with his prototypes around a month ago
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:08:44 i didn't think much of it then
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:09:09 but now its gotten too late, as he's turned it into an almost uncounterable combat vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:09:35 AND it has multiple configurations
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:09:52 it can have configurations to allow it to act as a submarine
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:10:08 as well as a flight capable killing machine
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:11:01 almost can be hit
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:11:41 you're right
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:12:03 but that thing can move as fast as a low tier conveyor drive, without having one built onto it
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:14:40 imagine if the noobs take that into account
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:14:47 and actively change direction
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:15:10 i think so
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:25:06 project habakkuk would die so fast to lava spitters lol
general 2020-12-02 20:57:17 stalkersanta381
general 2020-12-02 20:57:37 he's been working on it for at least a month or two
general 2020-12-02 20:58:10 omni bug
general 2020-12-02 20:58:48 no hover drives or conveyor drives
general 2020-12-02 20:59:18 i've estimated it to be between 2000 to 4000 basic speed units
general 2020-12-02 20:59:37 yes
general 2020-12-02 20:59:49 super rockets
general 2020-12-02 21:00:30 its gonna be almost impossible to take out an omni bug
general 2020-12-02 21:00:43 we need a physics change now
general 2020-12-02 21:01:45 ah
general 2020-12-02 21:02:03 you can kill it
general 2020-12-02 21:02:19 its just almost impossible to do so due to how its capable of moving
general 2020-12-02 21:02:32 it doesn't have wings
general 2020-12-02 21:02:43 and yet its capable of hovering
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 22:07:13 i just had a nostalgia overload
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 22:08:21 i managed to rebuild the tankbuster mk-2's earliest form from scratch all from the memories, and i uncovered some later memories of the tankbuster's form before the catastrophic save that caused me to lose it, till now
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:29:40 i managed to dig up a picture of the original tankbuster mk.2 and all i can say is, **i was pretty close**
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:30:13 to clarify the tankbuster in the bottom picture was posted in september 2018
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:31:45 i also found... this
apparently the original turbosub was capable of flying at one point in time
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:32:52 blocks used to have outlines on them
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:34:03 <@720891502108344360> you're right, the big extension of the water with the ramps was not present at that time
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:34:19 it was just the area where the swamp used to be
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:35:22 before the ocean was added, there was a swampy area between the mountains and the lunar area
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:36:21 also this is what got me my floating fortress role, i kid you not the name of the carrier is the leeroy jenkins
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:37:07 yea my early building skills havent aged well
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:37:20 it is lol
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:38:22 you had to get somebody to land on a carrier you built, and that carrier had to be 500-1000+ blocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:38:58 nope
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:39:11 i had sub commander too thanks to the original turbosub
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:39:20 idk why they removed it
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:39:51 also, i made this like a month later
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:40:06 literally just thanos car
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:40:35 yup
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:40:58 i've been in this community for a long time
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:41:41 i've seen things change, i've seen people come and go, i've seen the rise and fall of pvp metas
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:41:56 in fact the fall of another pvp meta is occuring right now
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:42:11 shredders are being replaced by omnis
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:43:13 this was my first attempt at a proper car. its supposed to be a trans am
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:43:30 it doesn't even look like a trans am
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:43:35 nope
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:43:46 that was before i got my own computer lol
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 03:44:54 i made an updated variant, that could fly, once the half blocks got released
the-dump 2021-03-01 02:04:15 dude i posted that image over 3 years ago
the-dump 2021-10-10 00:05:28 i have been summoned
the-dump 2021-10-10 01:58:04 i still hate that i didn't report the guy who made the original omni bugs for having nsfw + filter bypassing pixel art
but at the same time he hid his name under some blocks making it impossible to prove that it was his builds
the-dump 2021-10-11 05:24:10 You ever just

creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:18:01 what the hell is going on here
creations-chat 2022-05-09 01:26:58 doesn't vanilla in plane crazy terms mean the lack of motor locking?
creations-chat 2022-05-09 02:01:29 a few early steamships had sails
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:05:00 actually no
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:05:06 not using motorlock presents a challenge
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:05:18 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:06:23 trying to find the perfect wedge combination for a sloping surface is just as equally of a challenge
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:08:29 ^
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:08:35 that too
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:08:58 wouldn't that count as you know... motor locking?
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:11:20 y'all are literally proving our point with these comparisons
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:12:16 ^
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:12:25 both have an equal set of challenges
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:12:38 did i?
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:12:41 no i didn't
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:13:49 imagine questioning how someone got good
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:15:56 yea this is why i rarely participate in this community
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:15:59 man i miss the alpha days
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:18:38 yea but i really do miss the alpha community
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:18:42 was less toxic
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:18:52 actually felt like an accepting community
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 02:19:07 instead of instantly downvoting newcomers into oblivion
general 2022-05-09 04:59:58 MY BRO PLAYIN THE PIANO
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 05:31:39 holy shit
plane-crazy 2022-05-09 05:35:02 ITS GOT THE SOUND EFFECT TOO
general 2022-05-09 21:25:20 I have decided to disable ping notifications for the dump because people keep looking up memes using "has:image in:the-dump" and sorting by oldest and they end up replying to my fucking meme about the SR-71 on the highway, literally the first meme in the channel, and it annoys the heck out of me.
general 2022-05-09 21:25:41 literally anybody who does this
general 2022-05-09 21:25:48 i care
general 2022-05-09 21:26:22 doesn't stop pings from appearing in-app
general 2022-05-09 21:26:30 it only stops notifications from appearing on your computer
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:24:11 heck it ima try and make a sprint car (props to you if you know what that is lol)
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:32:15 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:32:28 its gonna be funky trying to get the asymmetrical appearance
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:33:27 sprint cars aren't symmetrical
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:34:01 its a sprint car
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:34:14 oh no wait wrong image
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:34:25 you're talking about the lancaster
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:35:24 he's talking about your lancaster
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:35:34 not the sprint car
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:35:36 lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:36:22 yea the sprint car is prolly gonna have to be my first proper motor locked vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:36:25 because of the wings
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:44:55 i'm definently gonna have to go bigger than this lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:45:57 because its a sandbox game
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:46:12 although i'm fine with tutorials as it helps people learn the ropes
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:46:35 but if they build only tutorial vehicles then they really should be thinking about building their own vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:46:49 and *god forbid them if they build a shredder bug or omni bug*
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:55:30 its something...
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 23:00:30 i know you can use half blocks in conjunction with normal wing panels to make it look thick
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 23:00:37 or to make hardpoints
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 23:00:39 but uh
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 23:00:55 making delta wings with that strategy might require motor locking
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 23:07:16 i experimented and got something that looks half decent while also being somewhat driveable
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 23:07:22 and its completely vanilla
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 23:07:26 no motor locking involved
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 23:07:54 the back is a bit big though
creations-chat 2022-05-11 01:04:08 its a sprint car
creations-chat 2022-05-11 01:12:11 for you its cringe
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 06:24:31 be warned there's a guy with an exploit that allows him to copy other people's builds instantly

the-dump 2022-05-11 13:08:32 its not a cosmetic it was an in-game glitch
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 14:37:57 tis just a scratch
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 14:38:30 gun
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 04:33:53 SO GUESS WHAT I WANT TO MAKE AGAIN
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 06:14:55 YOU UTTER FOOL!!!!!
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 06:20:55 its flying (may or may not have used gravity slider)

creations-chat 2022-05-13 03:01:53 bye
general 2022-05-13 03:02:12 i am completely suprised the floating fortress role still exists

plane-crazy 2022-05-26 22:14:46 its the rocket that welds the canopy to the seat
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 22:15:06 and not that much room for a parachute
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 22:15:18 wait i have an idea
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 22:26:05 i'm not gonna go through the pain of finding a way to detach the seat from the canopy so instead i found a way to make the entire thing more compact and just slapping a parachute onto it

plane-crazy 2022-05-27 00:13:40 no its not
plane-crazy 2022-05-27 00:18:33 i mean i'm still here
plane-crazy 2022-05-27 00:18:47 i think it was late 2018 or early 2019 when i joined

plane-crazy 2022-05-28 00:11:57 stat cards for pvp creations
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 00:26:31 yeah but the bad idea part is the fact that they work like the funny stand stats from jojo combined with trading cards
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 00:26:42 lemme get out an example i made with my own aircraft

plane-crazy 2022-05-28 14:55:18 even though i got basically a direct hit with all of my missiles it essentially only destroyed some of his tail and left him flying around in an almost invisible plane on my screen thanks to haha funny desync
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 14:55:44 when it should have destroyed about half of his plane and left him plummeting
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 15:02:59 its just like rockets and guns
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 15:03:21 you know how guns do that weird thing where you spin them on a cyllinder and they suddenly get inaccurate?
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 15:03:35 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 20:35:20 ^
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 20:35:28 i encountered someone with a similar script
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 20:35:32 lucky he didn't go for me
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 20:35:39 as i had my pvp plane out
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 20:36:08 almost improvements
the-dump 2022-05-28 21:07:33 its a pepperoni secret
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:16:41 yea this server is toxic
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:16:45 ^
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:16:56 and they downvote newcomers to hell
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:17:19 it is
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:17:25 that's what makes it toxic
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:18:05 it is actually
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:18:18 this
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:18:47 a newcomer can't make the most of the building system in a single second
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:19:07 this, you literally do not provide criticism
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:19:26 instead you just go ahead and say "oh its bad its bad because the creator is stupid blah blah blah"
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:19:44 i've seen entire trains of this crap in creations chat
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:19:54 i miss the old plane crazy community man
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:20:16 creations chat in a nutshell
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:20:44 a guy literally pinged me because i was mentioning the fact that my fire stingray replica was lockless
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:20:50 and i used "vanilla" as the term
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:21:13 and instead of providing criticism he literally complained about my use of the word "vanilla" to mean "no motorlock"
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:21:16 ^
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:22:33 ^
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:22:45 this is the only major plane crazy community server that i know of
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:23:14 ^
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:23:38 if i had a time machine and could choose when to go back in time to
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:23:48 i'd go back to 2018 back when the pcc server just started out
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:24:24 "a community will always be toxic regardless of who runs it"
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:24:38 yea a community will always have toxic members
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:24:46 but the toxicity of a community differs
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:24:52 we literally can
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:25:11 ^
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:26:05 yea
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:26:13 arguments everywhere
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:42:22 believe it or not my fire stingray replica even when subtracting dislikes managed to get more likes than my submarine
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:42:24 i am suprised
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:48:26 want me to join so i can discombobulate it?
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:49:46 this is probably the best my sprint car is ever gonna get lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:52:19 thanks lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:53:09 they are literally just text 1x2s on some half cylinder 2s

plane-crazy 2022-05-29 00:44:28 yea
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 00:44:33 this game needs proper moderation
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 00:44:45 aka a proper mod team
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 12:25:45 Maverick AGM my beloved
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 12:53:08 also where did my sub commander role go <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 12:53:23 please i had sub commander where did it go lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 13:29:36 very minor improvement (moved the main propellor from the back to the front to be more hidden) and a different paint scheme for my sprint car
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 13:30:00 sprint car
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 13:30:25 me who already has a racist car (see above)
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 13:34:39 also forgot to mention i changed the material from the default material to ice to give it that glossy fiberglass look
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 14:36:42 the old plane crazy arena map on its way to have the most unforgiving terrain for ground players
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 14:44:55 basically it was a large map half the size of the original map size for plane crazy, all of the plots were laid out around the edges of the map, and it was mostly grassy with ridges and trenches that were too hard for ground vehicles to traverse, and no water other than thin streams flowing through the hills so ships were essentially out of luck in terms of pvp. Oh and you couldn't respawn your vehicle or build in the arena if you died in the arena your only option was to head back to "build mode" (fancy word for non-pvp that they used before we had proper pvp servers)
general 2022-05-29 14:45:43 you guys know wikipedia's featured articles?
general 2022-05-29 14:46:01 yea today's featured article is fucking everywhere at the end of time aka ***ITS JUST A BURNING MEMORY***
general 2022-05-29 14:46:38 you guys know that its just a burning memory song that went viral
general 2022-05-29 14:47:23 no the sentence was talking about the album
general 2022-05-29 14:47:34 everywhere at the end of time is the name of the album its a part of
general 2022-05-29 14:48:05 ik
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 14:49:48 it was mostly because of the fact that you couldn't build in pvp
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 14:50:06 and once you died you can't respawn so you essentially had to go back to non-pvp
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 18:53:01 so this is my first time using motor hinges
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 21:42:55 holy shit i need to try this
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 23:52:49 i'm gonna copy this sprint car

plane-crazy 2022-05-30 01:46:05 still doesn't beat this one out god i wish that one actually registered since it is gonna be hard to beat

general 2022-06-01 15:22:33 Fun fact: Winnie The Poo is public domain now; as long as you don't make him wear the red shirt you can do anything with him, use him as a mascot, make a movie (there's a Winnie The Poo horror movie coming out without Disney's involvement) and no matter how much you use him as long as he's not wearing his iconic red shirt Disney can't do anything about it.
general 2022-06-01 20:21:22 it does connect to steam, however idk because the one i have is third party

general 2022-06-02 01:16:15 imagine using a website when you can just download the image and do it with paint.net
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 17:25:12 from this image alone i want you to guess the size of this omni swarmer
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 17:26:22 wrong (actual size of this thing compared to my drill
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 17:27:37 ***comically large omni swarmer***
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 21:17:36 quick warning watch out for this dude
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 21:17:51 
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 21:17:58 he's creation stealing
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 21:19:28 its a copy script
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 21:19:35 however not very good
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 21:19:50 it misplaces so many parts
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 21:19:57 puts them in the wrong rotation
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 21:20:52 yea look how bad its trying to copy my plane and failing
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 21:22:46 HE EVEN STOLE THE NAME LOL
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 21:24:54 oh yea fun fact when i encountered this guy in pvp he was in a really snappy omni although my conveyor drive allowed me to turn just as fast, guess what he did as soon as i engaged him
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 21:25:15 he respawned and started faking admin
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 21:25:20 to try and get me to leave
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 21:25:27 only for me to call him out as soon as he started
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 21:25:37 that is the most cowardly thing i've seen
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 21:26:37 no
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 21:26:53 the R0ust guy encountered with the copy script
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 21:27:50 no he had a massive omni
the-dump 2022-06-03 01:01:36 i don't like jaystation
the-dump 2022-06-03 01:01:47 its this crap that he pulled with his gf
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 02:05:52 when lady whiplash goes faster than 1500 it doesn't even do the wavy movements it just fucking ***spins*** in place so god damn fast if you turn it too hard
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 02:06:39 its literally the reason my conveyor drive is so slow
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 02:06:49 its so that i can somewhat control it
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 02:07:37 yeah my plane has the same thing
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 02:07:51 dual conveyor drive in a 5x1 space
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 02:14:08 r u n
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 02:14:40 its the gun truck
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 02:15:00 specifically the one from sonic generations with the sawblades

the-dump 2022-06-03 14:33:29 oh and btw he is an omni user that resorted to faking admin as soon as i used my conveyor drive to boost my manuverability
the-dump 2022-06-03 14:33:47 he literally despawned and started faking admin using /me commands lol
the-dump 2022-06-03 14:34:00 because he found an equal opponent

plane-crazy 2022-06-03 14:39:47 i don't think so without using the blacklist trick
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 14:40:03 as plane crazy physics just doesn't support it
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 14:40:08 even if you use a cutter block
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 14:40:13 you will just bounce right off
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 14:40:20 or get stuck
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 14:41:56 i know it is possible to make a proper fragmentation bomb like a grenade would be
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 14:42:02 because of cutters
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 14:42:54 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 14:43:15 because cutters aren't that good when moving in a single direction unless you're a noob blacklisting
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 14:43:41 cluster bombs too i think

general 2022-06-03 14:52:59 and i've got mario land 1 and 2
general 2022-06-03 14:53:33 for n64 i have a bunch of games that i can't even count but i do have a working copy of star wars: rogue squadron
general 2022-06-03 14:53:48 nice

general 2022-06-03 14:54:10 i forgot about that
general 2022-06-03 14:54:18 a bunch of beta mario world stuff got leaked too

general 2022-06-03 15:04:33 at least gamefreak is getting somewhat of a start as they uploaded the entire sound library of pokemon diamond and pearl with a free download on the official pokemon channel
general 2022-06-03 15:05:42 <:pogey:651848693842182144> yes i fucking love both this and eladard's themes to death

creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:01:12 Man rickje really needs to gather a proper moderation team for in-game moderation to help prevent this stuff
creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:04:49 This is where a chain of command comes in. Essentially he should get people that he trusts the most to use moderation powers and puts them at the highest level so that they can oversee lower ranks and prevent abuse among said ranks.
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 18:12:20 because its june
the-dump 2022-06-04 14:12:35 props to the guy who translated a literal classified document of that one chinese shell
fucking warthunder community literally commiting esponiage better than most governments
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:17:13 since we're posting cockpit images now
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:17:53 only some emotes are actually tagged
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:18:14 i know some of them are tagged for good reasons like the no smoking emote and the swimsuit emotes
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:18:15 huh
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:18:20 i know the black square isn't tagged
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:19:29 because these can reference stuff that are against ToS (smoking is essentially drug related and swuimsuit emotes are self explanatory and i am not going to explain any further)
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:19:48 but yeah i know some of the emotes are tagged by safechat
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:19:59 and because signs are automatically forced to use safechat
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:20:03 they will get tagged
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:21:58 yes and no. Beams (both 1x4 and 1x7) although not completely invulnerable against rockets, are incredibly resilient
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:22:36 the main way to deal with these are with guns
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:22:50 unless they are broken in your server
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:23:48 yes do that
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:23:55 since boats are easy targets for rockets
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:24:15 eh its decent
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:24:24 unless you're making a sub try making it wider
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:26:34 idk about that one but they could be considering that beams themselves are resilient
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:26:46 but its mostly the 1x7 beams that are resilient to fire
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:28:10 although this is the better looking canopy design thanks to the triangle wedges, i cannot actually use it since it welds the canopy to the fuselage and basically disables both the ejection and canopy opening mechanism
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:28:56 so i am forced to use this design to keep it fully vanilla
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:29:28 no because that actually makes it look worse
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:29:49 instead basically the entire canopy barring the two wedges at the front and back raises up
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:32:04 this is what i mean basically
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:32:37 i'd use a design similar to this but it would require motor lock to shrink my plane down to roscale and i'm a vanilla builder
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:33:51 again i'm a vanilla builder
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:34:11 huh
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:34:20 yeah another problem this is my pvp plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 19:31:28 ^
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 19:31:41 they literally would not work without it
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 00:35:09 the bram
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 00:41:50 SOMEONE QUICK CALL OHIO
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 00:56:07 its time
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 00:57:59 you can't
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 00:59:58 they must be hacking because normally you can't go through land
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:13:54 yeh its one of the drifty planes
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:14:35 trust me fox isn't the only one with a plane that can survive rocket hits
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 01:18:37 chris tank my beloved

plane-crazy 2022-06-05 14:47:08 RICK WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:11:18 some better looking ailerons
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:17:37 ah yes egg island
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:17:47 aka came out like a full day before the egg hunt started
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:18:12 i honestly hope it stays in PC2 even with the new map
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 18:18:27 it just feels like something that could only exist in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 20:25:30 so i tried a thing
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 20:25:49 its low res but
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 20:26:26 you need to weld it with something like cameras or trails
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 20:26:34 as it doesn't weld on its own
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 20:27:28 it should work i think
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 20:27:41 i forgor if sparklers can weld to the sides of things or not
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 20:27:48 ah
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 20:27:53 yeah you need motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 20:27:59 if you want to weld sparklers
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 20:30:24 quick fix
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 20:37:00 ah
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 22:07:05 i literally mentioned cams
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 03:08:48 PHINISH!!11!!1111!!!1!1
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 18:08:54 or you could use metal like i do
plane-crazy 2022-06-06 18:09:15 it is until you have to build something metallic

plane-crazy 2022-06-14 00:10:00 sneakie peekies
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:14:10 almost roscale ratte is tiny <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 15:37:53 because of how small the 1-1 scale ratte turned out to be i decided to go for a single room single floor interior over the old ratte which had a labrynth of rooms
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 15:39:16 however this brings 2 problems: 1: there's no space to put a vehicle bay which is a staple of the design and 2: the turret interior is crap due to the limited space
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 15:42:29 also
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 15:42:41 why are there no 1x4 corner wedges?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 15:47:49 yeah
half triangle wedge up
half wedge 1x2 (the wedge category one)
corner wedges L and R 1x4
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 15:50:05 basically yes however i built it around the interior so that i wouldn't have that many problems with it
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 15:53:16 this is the current exterior
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 15:55:58 yeah because of either one of two reasons
reason 1: i just haven't added it yet
reason 2: it would require motor lock and as a vanilla builder i don't do motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 16:29:48 classic daytona hands down
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 16:31:36 oh yeah the new turret interior looks 👌 even though its not final
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 16:34:52 yeah i scaled it at 1 block = 1 meter
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 16:39:06 i don't think i can considering i just raised the turret's height by a full half block and the turret has an interior
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 17:23:51 added some guardrails
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 17:40:38 i haven't made them yet
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 17:51:49 did you read what i said
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 17:53:29 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 17:54:34 yeah if i wanted my ratte to be 1-1 scale it would have to be 20 blocks wide which i think my old ratte is already 20 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 17:55:31 i originally intended it to be 1-1 scale but i forgot what the scale was so i just scaled it at 1 block per meter
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 17:55:50 its too late to delete it now
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 17:59:17 although now i know how big a 1-1 scale ratte would be so i can properly build one
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 17:59:42 since my old ratte isn't really that good
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 18:08:30 i have the scale setup and it is actually significantly bigger than my old ratte excluding height because my old ratte was extremely disproportionate
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 18:09:24 however because i'm a vanilla builder i am going to have to make a sacrifice and either trim down 1 block or add 1 block to the width to keep the turret centered
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 19:20:01 massive engines
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 19:24:15 roscale ratte
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 19:32:36 1-1 scale
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 21:39:00 working on the interior
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:15:48 💀 "Everybody must use outdated planes against my modern mbt so that i get an unfair advantage against them"
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:18:10 "Its not fair that people are using modern planes against my modern tank they need to be more realistic by being unrealistic using outdated planes"
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 23:09:48 I mean doing the same thing in a conveyor drive doesn't shut off the drive it just straight up deletes the vehicle with you in it
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 23:12:31 F A S T
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 14:00:34 current look of the roscale ratte's exterior, might change the maus turrets for AA turrets and i might change the 280mm cannon barrels for smaller barrels
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 14:05:07 it is exactly 50 blocks long, 19 blocks wide, and 17 blocks tall, meaning it is roscale
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 14:05:24 as it lines up with the ratte's actual planned size
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 14:08:25 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 14:17:47 war mech by chris
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 15:27:32 which one should i use on my ratte
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 15:28:31 yeah i couldn't figure out which one looked better
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 15:29:16 so i guess i'm going with number one
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 15:48:00 here is where i take liberties with the weapon placements
instead of having the machine guns in the front on the armor protecting the tracks or above the hull, i placed them on the sides where they would be most effective
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 16:11:41 i think the treads would loop around below the deck
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 16:12:02 you know how the treads are on the tiger? imagine that but on a larger vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 16:13:51 HOLY SHIT I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS TO LOOK THIS GOOD DEAR GOD
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 16:14:08 THE BARREL CHANGE IS MUCH BETTER THAN I EXPECTED
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 16:17:02 that's the problem
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 16:17:28 if i use half wedges then i can't use fireworks or detail the sides of the blast bags
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 16:18:01 i won't use motor lock solutions out of personal preference
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 16:18:36 and I can't use 2x2 wedges because it just looks goofy and disproportionate
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 16:21:19 the only decent solutions are to either just keep it the way it is or to narrow the hatches down to just one block
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 16:31:25 the funny
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 19:55:15 i tried to make new decorative motorcycles for my ratte and uhh
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 19:55:47 *do comically large handlebars count as handlebars*
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 20:52:49 looks nice but at the same time it doesn't look right
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 21:20:36 yeah too bad it don't work
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 22:04:24 quick AA turret i whipped up based off of the wirbelwind's turret for the ratte
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 22:43:17 
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 00:47:48 YOOOOOO
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 00:47:50 HE RETURNS
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 01:20:36 the tangle
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 02:13:35 LOOK GUYS LOOK!!! I DID A FUNNY!!!
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 02:22:39 oh no
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 02:22:58 *please i'm just a silly little crow tengu*
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 02:30:21 aaaaa
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 02:35:28 wirbelwind style AA turret i built for the ratte
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 03:04:43 i thought magnet drives were nerfed to the ground
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 03:55:29 also why do i not have sub commander
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 03:55:32 i used to have it

plane-crazy 2022-06-16 20:11:35 two roscale tanks looking at each other
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 20:14:01 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 20:14:06 its mine lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 20:14:22 i forgor who the spg is
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 20:35:22 yeah i honestly feel like my ratte is basically done at this point
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 20:35:45 all i gotta do is make a collage for the interior
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 21:12:17 should i keep the massive iron cross or should i remove it?
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 21:14:05 k lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 21:15:45 because its a triple turret with the center cannon removed
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 21:46:16 although not possible if you want to change the color of the rocket flame itself, you can do this with trails
general 2022-06-16 22:09:03 is there a limit to how many images you can send in a single message?
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 23:03:23 turrets are bad but not for being tryhardy but from a pvp standpoint as they are literally some of the most vulnurable pvp "vehicles" out there
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 23:11:53 to that i'd say just spawn at the airport lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 23:12:08 then he's prolly smart
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 23:12:17 considering most people spawn at the main area
plane-crazy 2022-06-16 23:12:29 that or targeting

plane-crazy 2022-06-17 00:53:36 this was literally the basis for most of my rattes for like 3 years until i straight up saved over it with my new one and i do not regret it
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 00:54:14 no
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 00:54:23 the closest we have to it is half block wedges

plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:35:18 exactly
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:35:25 i can't
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:35:28 its 1-1 scale
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:35:31 with a full interior
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:36:34 man really is criticizing my 1-1 scale ratte for not having treads when i literally built it for the interior lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:37:16 yes cope
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:37:33 yes i made a roscale ratte
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:37:35 deal with it
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:38:34 yeah this is why i hate the plane crazy community
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:38:36 its so toxic
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:40:09 yeah people take their opinion so seriously lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:40:17 its your opinion
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:40:22 i don't have to listen to it
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:40:36 i agree
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:40:47 again
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:40:49 no room
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:41:50 yeah because a good creation is a good creation
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:43:17 honestly this is why i ***fucking despise*** this community
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:43:21 its so toxic
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:44:53 its not a fact its an opinion
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:45:26 yeah its a statement
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:45:34 where's the proof that makes it a fact
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:45:50 because a good creation is a good creation regardless of if its roscale or not
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:46:56 even if its a fact you shouldn't hate someone's creation just because its not your standard of perfection
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:47:11 even then you don't have to
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:47:16 its your choice
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:49:22 people can't take a joke lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:49:32 another reason why this server is so toxic
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:50:35 no the toxicity comes from taking jokes too seriously
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:54:06 ok i see multiple flaws with this evidence
1: the builds have been posted 4 months apart
2: the build at the bottom is a work in progress build and posting WIP builds in creations is warnable nowadays
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:54:11 so its not really a good comparison
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:54:39 it does

plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:55:13 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:55:23 not only that
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:55:30 but the bottom build isn't even complete
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:55:42 which is actually against the rules nowadays
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:56:02 you can't post wip builds in creations anymore
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:56:07 as its warnable
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:57:33 sometimes mods don't see them
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:03:31 seriously i don't get why people get so mad over people building something how they want it to be
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:03:44 if someone wants to build something roscale then let them build roscale
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 20:56:58 me omw to live in a suburban environment with car based infrastructure so our child develops an anime addiction to escape forced loneliness caused by said car centered infrastructure
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 21:07:26 no motorlock was used
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 21:07:54 no
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 21:08:09 because no
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 21:08:21 but no
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 21:09:07 so does my ratte look like shit because it doesn't have motorlock in it?
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 21:09:22 cope then

plane-crazy 2022-06-21 14:54:49 yo what server you in lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 14:54:57 ah
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 14:55:10 yeah that monster is definently twice as big as 1-1 scale
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 14:55:22 -servers
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 14:55:41 uhh, *what*
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 14:56:01 *how does that work*
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 14:59:02 yeah i have expert designer and expert terrain specialist, *yet i am somehow not ranked?*
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:14:53 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:15:06 funny thing your interpretation going by the screenshot is twice as big as it should be
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:15:18 as a 1-1 scale hull should be around 50 blocks lon
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:15:20 long
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:16:02 its based of of another tank design of similar proportions, the ratte
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:16:10 heck its literally a ratte hull with a gustav gun
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:16:22 and his monster is like
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:16:26 twice as big as my ratte
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:16:38 even though they are around the same size
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:16:43 in the plans
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:17:04 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/988816242867580969/unknown.png just jeez look how big this is
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:17:15 that's like 2-1 scale
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:18:31 compare it to my 1-1 scale ratte replica and it is nearly twice as big as it
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:18:51 CR-90 the project stardust sleep paralysis demon my beloved

plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:21:48 but still nice monster
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:22:13 i measured it
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:22:18 using the in-game scale
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:22:26 0.7 meters = 1 block
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:22:37 50 blocks long = 35 meters
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:22:44 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:23:14 yeah you should really measure things by using 0.7 meters = 1 block
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:23:25 i mean that's due to the gun i think
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:23:31 but yeah its built out of a ratte hull
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:23:47 yeah makes sense
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:23:59 its too late to completely redo it from scratch
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:24:53 also how fast is it
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:25:48 my ratte with a top possible speed of 307 almost outrunning my fire stingray replica: AMATEUR
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:25:56 yeah my ratte is fast
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:26:10 i actually had to limit the speed of the motors that propel it
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:27:00 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/986407821753081896/Roblox_2022-06-14_17-54-10_Trim.mp4
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:27:24 let me check
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:27:50 just a reminder that could be the total length and it could very much include the gun
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:27:58 as the hull is a ratte hull
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:28:08 yeah makes sense
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:28:20 69 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:28:47 for reference
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:29:05 the in-game build plot is 51 x 51 x 51 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:31:22 i mean
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:32:06 177 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:32:12 also
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:32:41 my avatar on the top deck of the ratte
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:33:05 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:33:07 but remember
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:33:22 roblox avatars are slightly enlarged if you compare them to a person
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:33:27 of the same height
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:33:51 i literally just took the dimensions off of wikipedia and used that
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:34:09 including the ground clearance
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:34:33 which gave me probably my favorite version of any ratte that i have built
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:34:48 as it has all of the necessary rooms for a ratte
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:34:58 ah
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:35:13 man i hate dyno
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:35:56 i mean that yeah
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:35:59 but uh
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:36:32 probably the best way to measure the ratte is to measure the gustav first
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:36:35 i mean the monster
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:36:41 since the gustav was actually built
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:36:45 it has a defined scale
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:37:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:37:37 but i suggest using the gustav as a baseline
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:38:04 yeah you keep your scale lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:38:20 it doesn't even matter how you build it
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:38:26 just as long as you build it
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:40:46 yeah i can see
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:40:56 but yeah it doesn't matter how big you build it lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:42:51 i mean yeah the ratte is kinda the more famous brother of the monster
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:43:07 and it has a bit more documentation
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:43:20 so yeah
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:43:25 i can see your problems lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:47:58 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:48:09 i just scaled my ratte off of the wikipedia's scale
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:48:44 but yeah the ratte mostly has a more uniform scale because most people portray it with a scharnhorst turret that has the center gun either removed or replaced with something else
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:49:41 and because the specific turret that is often used to portray it (the gneisenau's casar turret) still exists irl at normandy its quite easy to get a good scale for the ratte
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:50:16 lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:50:40 yeah my ratte isn't truly 1-1 scale as it is 1 block narrower and one block taller
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:50:54 1 block taller so i can fit in all of the details for the turreet
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:51:05 and 1 block narrower so the turret can actually be centered on its mount
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:51:08 let me check
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 15:51:26 67.9 meters
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 18:14:36 it could either be this or a paid access deal
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 18:15:09 where you pay robux for early access
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 18:15:27 i know apoc rising 2 is using this approach
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 03:46:55 YF-23 Disagrees
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 03:48:00 YF-23 is the big one
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 03:48:20 that too
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 03:48:48 but the best example is the YF-23
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 03:48:55 as they act as both elevators and rudders
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 03:50:34 not to mention
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 03:50:38 YF-23
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 03:50:45 look at it
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 03:50:54 take a good look at the tail
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 04:15:06 by definition the ones on the YF-23 are ruddervators
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 04:15:34 otherwise the YF-23 wouldn't have elevators or rudders to use
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 16:49:54 i don't feel too good

plane-crazy 2022-06-25 19:38:44 i anti-copy blacklisted him once i realised he was copying it and now i've server hopped so he has no chance of copying it any further and is now restricted to using his memory
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 19:40:15 and its too late
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 19:40:22 because now everybody in the pcc knows about it
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 19:40:37 so if they see him claiming its his they can call him out AND provide proof
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 19:45:57 nah i left the server
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 19:45:59 even better
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 19:49:45 literally just use one disc
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 19:49:50 with max size
creations-chat 2022-06-26 19:35:32 that's not criticism
creations-chat 2022-06-26 19:45:29 Yes, this server is so toxic because some people want your creation to be their standard of perfection and anything less is considered "trash" and then they don't even provide criticism for you to improve your build they just make fun of it with an insult because they don't want your build to be better than theirs (dave is an example of exactly what I mean.) Although I'm not against sharing your opinion about a vehicle, you shouldn't need be selfish and make fun of their creation just because you think you're better than them and that their creation doesn't appeal to your standard of "perfection".
creations-chat 2022-06-26 19:50:48 i don't really think harsh critics would be a good thing
creations-chat 2022-06-26 19:53:14 at the same time there's a limit to how far one should go, you should actually provide examples of what needs to be improved and ways that you can improve it instead of being vague and saying "this is trash"
creations-chat 2022-06-26 19:57:32 No, because "harsh critics" are literally the problem with this server. I shall not continue this further to prevent it from getting too heated
creations-chat 2022-06-26 19:59:47 "THIS IS TRASH YOU'RE BAD" is not criticism it is toxicity
creations-chat 2022-06-26 20:35:03 TLDR: Having too many harsh critics is worse for the community as a whole because they alienate new players by being overly toxic to them and their builds due to their low skill, without providing actual criticism. What this does is it creates a hostile environment that drives new players out of the community instead of providing an opportunity for them to improve.
creations-chat 2022-06-26 20:42:15 I'm literally an advocate for constructive criticism over harsh criticism as it makes the community much friendlier
creations-chat 2022-06-26 20:44:26 although i hate to continue this any further, care to explain how its wrong?
since constructive criticism takes the bad points of a build provides examples of how to improve said points (aka literally the correct form of criticism)

plane-crazy 2022-07-01 16:40:40 i thought the front of the turret was a little bland so I put the gunner's seat where the third gun would usually be at as well as a viewport similar to the one the driver's seat uses

plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:23:47 i've won against a single one more times than i died to any encounters with them
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:24:28 in a conventional plane that doesn't even have good manuvering
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:24:38 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:25:15 they try to use pure brute force to counter their lack of skill and it shows
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:26:19 like my pvp plane which doesn't even have good manuverability
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:26:41 yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:26:56 they ruined the server browser
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:27:19 its literally an airbrake
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:27:58 i have my control surfaces at 25 degrees to retain as much speed as possible when turnfighting
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:31:15 i don't want my plane to do cobras as it makes it more vulnurable to actually getting hit
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:34:26 1: it slows you down making you more likely to get hit
2: it makes your visible profile bigger as you are essentially going perpendicular to a tailing plane also making you more likely to get hit
3: to fully take advantage of the manuver you need the enemy jet to fly in front of you, which may not happen all the time
plane-crazy 2022-07-06 03:37:06 i've literally taken out a guy 10 seconds after he took off because his plane essentially drifted

plane-crazy 2022-07-10 22:43:14 before the lake existed there was a swamp so boats were effectively impossible to make

plane-crazy 2022-12-03 18:37:30 run
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 18:37:43 i am now a fumo
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 05:04:45 so uh
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 05:04:50 earlier i was in a server
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 05:04:59 i blew up someone's giant turret with my plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 05:05:07 and they got mad at me for being a jet user
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 05:05:14 now guess what vehicle they spawned next
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 05:05:16 take a wild guess
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 05:06:08 no
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 05:06:15 a fucking ***broadsword***
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 05:06:18 from ***halo***
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 05:06:50 that is the last thing i would have expected a player having that reaction to spawn
plane-crazy 2023-01-24 05:07:06 and i swear it turned like a fucking omni
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 18:42:14 you ever just turn around and see BATMAN!!?!??!???

creations-chat 2023-03-25 16:51:13 can people learn to ***TURN THE PING OFF***
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 05:46:24 can anybody explain to me what the hell is "void tech" and why is this shit not banned from pvp
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 06:09:45 materials don't affect durability
only friction
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 06:09:51 and only fabric and ice do this
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 06:10:02 fabric and ice both have high and low friction respectively but are extremely light
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 06:10:19 1x7 beam
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 06:10:33 yeah but 1x7 beams have a tendency to survive missiles like they are nothing
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 06:11:06 exactly
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 06:11:20 so it doesn't completely unweld the beam on the first hit
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 06:11:26 yes
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 07:10:17 now make a v8
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 07:10:31 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 20:26:46 actually really cool lol
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 20:27:13 although the angle is a bit closer to that of the side pistons of a W engine rather than a V engine
the-dump 2023-05-11 03:03:33 THE ONE PIEEEEECE
THE ONE PIECE IS REAAAAAL
plane-crazy 2023-05-11 03:08:40 i found a person using a really fast build in pvp that isn't a meta
plane-crazy 2023-05-11 03:08:52 it just so happens to be a UX-01 dimensional submarine
plane-crazy 2023-05-11 03:09:02 so i decided to do a funny
general 2023-05-11 03:11:08 i join pvp
general 2023-05-11 03:11:19 i see a really fast build that isn't some skeletal abomination
general 2023-05-11 03:11:25 you guys will not believe what it was
general 2023-05-11 03:11:39 a fucking ***ux-01 dimensional submarine***

plane-crazy 2023-06-20 03:03:14 don't you just hate it
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 03:03:36 when some dude thinks its ok to have the funny windmill on their build
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 03:03:55 and then calls YOU the problem for pointing out its wrong?
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 03:26:35 
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 04:55:17 just found this dude
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 00:42:35 just encountered someone
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 00:42:41 who threatened to lag bomb the server
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 00:42:46 all because i showed up in my jet
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 00:42:51 and started doing jet things
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 00:43:06 (shooting at ground targets, one of them was his monstrocity of a hover tank)
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 00:43:58 they left almost immediately after they loaded the lag bomb
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 00:44:05 didn't even bother to use it

general 2023-06-21 02:08:06 god damn i just realised my P-1000 is almost eligible for the hall of fame lol
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 19:20:13 landships are underrated tbh
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 19:54:53 was it really a W?
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 19:55:37 or was it a V?
general 2023-06-23 03:00:47 i have something similar to this in my plane
general 2023-06-23 03:01:16 except its magnet - magnet - suspension - target part
general 2023-06-23 03:11:05 >conveyor drive

plane-crazy 2023-06-23 03:26:27 by a bacon army
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 03:27:03 apparently i stole a plot from a friend of theirs
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 03:33:49 man you were in the server around the same time too you could have rescued me
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 03:34:06 <:MarisaWah:1030811823953428481>
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 04:09:26 ***they were there as soon as i joined i couldn't do anything about it***
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 04:10:57 i don't think security would have saved me from the fact there were three of them
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 04:44:07 because people are edgy
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 05:30:12 blacklisting
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 05:30:23 they have to
plane-crazy 2023-06-23 05:30:49 because the air has the consistency of fucking ***maple syrup***

plane-crazy 2023-07-10 05:25:13 is it spawned?
plane-crazy 2023-07-10 05:25:58 it was a glitch that allowed you to fling people
plane-crazy 2023-07-10 05:26:04 and break larger creations
plane-crazy 2023-07-10 05:26:19 no like
plane-crazy 2023-07-10 05:26:24 ***is it spawned in that image***
plane-crazy 2023-07-10 08:19:28 i am witnessing someone
plane-crazy 2023-07-10 08:19:33 try to make a shark tutorial
plane-crazy 2023-07-10 08:19:43 ***even though there's already a shark tutorial***
plane-crazy 2023-07-10 09:20:36 they did
plane-crazy 2023-07-10 09:21:03 i watched
plane-crazy 2023-07-10 09:21:04 someone
plane-crazy 2023-07-10 09:21:07 M A L D
plane-crazy 2023-07-10 09:21:21 because his precious half piston glitch got patched and he was unable to grief my build
plane-crazy 2023-07-10 09:44:18 yes
creations-chat 2023-07-10 22:26:00 ayo <@483065358530510848> you finally decided to post the oil tanker
creations-chat 2023-07-10 22:44:47 you've never seen the tanker in-game before
its got so much detail he can't put it all in a single post
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 04:11:21 but uhh
i may have encountered two people harassing this one dude and constantly trying to say that he said extremely horrible things
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 04:12:53 no like its gotten really bad they are ***constantly*** harassing him
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 04:13:08 saying they are doing it for fun over a joke he made
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 04:15:51 this is one of them
i normally hate posting usernames because it can start witch hunts but like they straight up accused the dude of saying that he drowned a fish in hydrocloric acid (not even joking)
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 04:16:22 and now he's alting
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 04:16:36 to bypass the guy's attempt to block them
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 04:16:41 i did
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 04:18:14 someone called synxify is also a part of the harassment campaign
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 05:01:51 update they accused the guy of being a groomer for simply talking to them
