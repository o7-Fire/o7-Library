bot-central 2021-02-14 05:53:13 &suggest [Rescalable Wedges]
[Building]
Make it so you can rescale wedges like triangle wedges, traingle wedgeblocks, etc. With this feature, you can make triangle wedgeblocks 2x2, 2x3, 3x3, 3x3, etc. It can be in any shape up to 5x5. This feature will help people who are having trouble filling in gaps on plane noses.
Links - https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/710220929204224183/810387165233545256/unknown.png - In this case, I want to make a triangle wedge 2x2, but it would be tough to figure out a way to fill this gap. Link 2: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/710220929204224183/810387318652403732/unknown.png - There would be a scaling menu on the bottom of your screen, you can increase the height, width, and breadth, but you cant go any higher than 5x5x5. This will make it easier to fill in gaps.
