general 2021-04-11 03:22:01 Hey guys, i'm new to the server (so i basically have no idea what i'm doing) and i wanted to show my creations on <#384025409945337856> but it didnt let me attach the images, what do i do?
general 2021-04-11 03:22:41 Ok
general 2021-04-11 03:24:20 Some people say i'm above average/pro so i think i'll basically be average on this server
general 2021-04-11 03:27:42 Wow, thats bad stuff!
general 2021-04-11 03:28:22 Its annoying when your recording a yt video, because you have to edit it out all the time, and takes hours!

general 2021-04-11 03:39:16 Ik
general 2021-04-11 03:40:17 Finally it got deleted!
general 2021-04-11 03:41:06 I think it was against the rules
general 2021-04-11 03:41:41 But i don't think you can report right now
general 2021-04-11 03:42:12 Against the rules...
general 2021-04-11 03:42:49 Read the description on the channel your posting on
general 2021-04-11 03:43:15 Rickje is too busy for reports
general 2021-04-11 03:44:00 Everyone makes mistakes
general 2021-04-11 03:45:34 Just looking at my flashing cursor on my screen waiting for someone to talk lol
general 2021-04-11 03:45:43 Since i have nothing to do
general 2021-04-11 03:54:03 Well that must be annoying

general 2021-04-11 04:03:31 Ik, its annoying
general 2021-04-11 04:03:47 You forgot to save?
general 2021-04-11 04:04:04 I think roblox studio autosaves every 5 minutes
general 2021-04-11 04:04:55 Just crashes when theres too many models loaded
general 2021-04-11 04:05:29 Or sometimes if theres a script doing some strange stuff
general 2021-04-11 04:06:21 Because my friend was making a game with free models but it started lagging all of a sudden and he told me to try and fix it, turns out it was some kind of script
general 2021-04-11 04:06:22 Oh no
general 2021-04-11 04:06:31 Maybe you forgot to save it before you started modeling
general 2021-04-11 04:06:37 Then it will autosave i think
general 2021-04-11 04:06:57 Since thats how Adobe Premiere Pro works
general 2021-04-11 04:07:56 Well that was a big change in subject
bot-central 2021-04-11 04:08:49 !rank
general 2021-04-11 04:09:03 ...
general 2021-04-11 04:09:18 And a very big change in subject again
general 2021-04-11 04:13:37 Because you have to be at least level 3 on mee6
general 2021-04-11 04:14:23 I don't have image perms yet, but someone told me you have to be at least level 3 on mee6

general 2021-04-11 04:19:04 OK

creations-chat 2021-04-11 04:35:57 <@!655087990418309140> I like the wheels design on your M5 Sherbert
creations-chat 2021-04-11 04:37:59 When i was very bad at the game, my friend let me copy his car, which has similar wheels, but instead of those wedges, they were half blocks, but they glitched out sometimes when it went downhill, and got flung up into the air, i think it could've been the suspention config, i'm not sure though
creations-chat 2021-04-11 04:40:49 Why does everyone think my zeppelin is a blimp...?
creations-chat 2021-04-11 04:43:12 Actually a zeppelin works by multiple cells of helium/hydrogen, so its not even a balloon, its actually a frame allowing it to be streamline but my one doesnt really copy the inner workings
general 2021-04-11 04:44:26 Uhhh ok?
general 2021-04-11 04:44:42 Sorry if i overworked your brain
general 2021-04-11 04:45:20 I'm probably even younger then you lol
general 2021-04-11 04:47:47 I remember when i was really young, playing Minecraft, and i thought of a game exactly like Plane Crazy, and it being a dream game... And now i've found it a few years ago
general 2021-04-11 04:48:36 Well i'm dumb
creations-chat 2021-04-11 04:52:11 Actually i was just correcting someones statement
general 2021-04-11 04:57:41 Ok

the-dump 2021-04-11 05:44:24 I think my computer hates me at this point
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:46:27 ..What?
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:46:43 Nope
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:46:46 Actually coded it
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:47:12 I used the snipping tool though
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:47:43 I used a vbs file
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:47:47 With msgbox
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:48:06 `x=msgbox("Could not copy files because NO!!" ,0+48, "HA HA!")` is the source code, only one line
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:48:55 It turned into that quality because thats the quality of the icon in windows
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:49:27 I used vbscript
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:49:32 So i did make the error myself
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:50:06 Ok, but i can't be bothered to learn a whole knew language
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:50:56 What i could just type "Make an error message that says Ha Ha! Cannot copy files because NO!!"
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:51:03 I don't think macros work like that
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:53:42 Excel is your way of doing it, writing code is my way of doing it...
the-dump 2021-04-11 05:54:06 It will come up with a similar result in the end so it doesnt matter

I like the motor locking
creations-chat 2021-04-11 14:13:24 Maybe compare its size with your character, or something else
For proof
help 2021-04-11 14:18:21 Yeah, it looks decent
creations-chat 2021-04-11 14:18:58 Hes probably building a bigger version lol

The image is pixelated so it might be a normal sized tutorial plane
bug-reports 2021-04-11 14:24:12 Well something that fixed that when i had that problem is getting a faster computer
bug-reports 2021-04-11 14:24:16 But that is costly
bug-reports 2021-04-11 14:24:39 Its mainly from the CPU being too slow
bug-reports 2021-04-11 14:24:54 Maybe upgrade your CPU and it will be faster
bug-reports 2021-04-11 14:25:20 Just check task manager
bug-reports 2021-04-11 14:26:23 Roblox likes to limit its CPU utilisation at 50%
bug-reports 2021-04-11 14:26:40 And if its going to like 56% thats a clue you might need a new CPU
bug-reports 2021-04-11 14:26:56 If your GPU is going like 95% then you'll need a new GPU
creations-chat 2021-04-11 14:27:41 <@456226577798135808> Lol look at all those propellers
I'm gonna join you and see if for myself lol
creations-chat 2021-04-11 14:31:22 I think its because expectations are quite high on this server
Don't be sad about it, you will get better
creations-chat 2021-04-11 14:37:22 Well its actually a tutorial plane but bigger lol
creations-chat 2021-04-11 14:39:29 Ik
creations-chat 2021-04-11 14:41:47 In my opinion, yes
creations-chat 2021-04-11 15:00:18 Make it heavier on the back
creations-chat 2021-04-11 15:06:42 Move the wings forward
creations-chat 2021-04-11 15:09:05 Yeah, its decent

creations-chat 2021-04-12 07:49:34 Not sure, not really experienced in motor locking, would you like me to test?
creations-chat 2021-04-12 07:51:39 Ok, takes me a while to load on roblox with my internet, i'll come back soon with results. I will also provide a picture if it was successful.
creations-chat 2021-04-12 07:53:42 Finally my internet will let me load, let me think of a design of a tower
creations-chat 2021-04-12 07:57:32 Sorry, i can't come up with a 1x2 design without all the motors breaking apart, the 3rd and the 1st part of the tower links them together, 1x3 is the most compact design
creations-chat 2021-04-12 07:59:40 But i think a 2x2 design is possible, i'll go and try and make that
creations-chat 2021-04-12 08:02:17 Nope, not possible, again, i am not really experienced in motor locking, so i will struggle making up my own design

general 2021-04-13 01:31:57 Ik!
bug-reports 2021-04-13 01:35:03 I think you just need lower ping/higher internet speed and that will fix the problem, since thats what happens to me when my internet slows down
general 2021-04-13 01:37:41 That is quite big
general 2021-04-13 01:37:55 No, sorry
general 2021-04-13 01:40:01 Because i'm bad at telling people how to do stuff
general 2021-04-13 01:40:40 Me?
general 2021-04-13 01:40:53 Ok, but my internet is slow

general 2021-04-13 01:50:55 Go onto a PVP server
Use left click to shoot
general 2021-04-13 01:52:29 Step 1: click gamemodes
general 2021-04-13 01:53:01 Step 2: Click PVP mode
general 2021-04-13 01:53:17 Use the left button on your mouse to left click
general 2021-04-13 01:54:03 By applying forse onto the button, you will hear a click, when it is pressed down, after that, stop applying that forse
general 2021-04-13 01:54:50 Sorry, but particle accelerators are not in the game at the moment
general 2021-04-13 01:55:02 Actually, apply a push forse
general 2021-04-13 01:55:50 If there is no button, you dont have a mouse
general 2021-04-13 01:56:03 Broken the chain
general 2021-04-13 01:57:19 Ok that pinging could be annoying
general 2021-04-13 01:58:02 Nah idc
general 2021-04-13 01:58:16 I can just mute the server
general 2021-04-13 01:58:46 Nah i'm already on there, i won't get a ping
general 2021-04-13 01:59:06 Well its just motor locking, so it wont be super complex
general 2021-04-13 01:59:47 I won't copy
general 2021-04-13 01:59:52 I'm too lazy to
general 2021-04-13 02:00:29 Also i'm not the type of guy who copys
general 2021-04-13 02:01:08 Same
general 2021-04-13 02:02:29 I remember i was gonna build something then i just deleted one of my save slots and then just did nothing about it
general 2021-04-13 02:03:01 Because i'm lazy, most of the time i build something, i just give up
general 2021-04-13 02:04:24 Probably the profile picture, but i'm not 100% sure what "furry" means
general 2021-04-13 02:04:55 Idc tbh
general 2021-04-13 02:06:17 It must be annoying
general 2021-04-13 02:07:16 Idk if your a furry or not...
I'm fine about your profile picture and username... anyway its only just some infomation stored on a hard drive
general 2021-04-13 02:07:56 The chat has gone loud

general 2021-04-13 02:10:35 Also you can get warned for that
general 2021-04-13 02:10:48 Sometimes it does
general 2021-04-13 02:11:04 I got warned on roblox before, when someone reported me
general 2021-04-13 02:12:00 Idc if someones a furry or not, its just another human being
general 2021-04-13 02:12:21 No, it doesnt work that way
general 2021-04-13 02:13:20 Rickje said it himself in <#623337136267067393>
general 2021-04-13 02:14:09 What is wrong with furries, i don't understand
general 2021-04-13 02:15:09 Everyone is talking about furries
general 2021-04-13 02:16:47 Also <@!177219221309095936> sent an inappropriate image saying that he is trying to report someone
general 2021-04-13 02:17:51 What is wrong with furries!?
general 2021-04-13 02:19:51 I'm pretty sure thats against the rules, all memes should be posted in <#495286269459300364>
general 2021-04-13 02:22:29 What is wrong with furrys!?
general 2021-04-13 02:23:01 Well it doesnt mean they are all annoying
general 2021-04-13 02:24:11 Doesnt mean all of them are
general 2021-04-13 02:26:19 Nah, i wont
general 2021-04-13 02:26:47 I literally don't know what "roast" means
general 2021-04-13 02:27:03 I'm stupid
general 2021-04-13 02:29:06 Idk what is wrong with people just looking at the profile picture and just thinking of them being a furry
general 2021-04-13 02:30:40 Saying that is against the rules
general 2021-04-13 02:32:04 You were advertising
general 2021-04-13 02:32:20 About your server
general 2021-04-13 02:38:03 My computer is offbrand because its a custom built
general 2021-04-13 02:39:14 I said mine is custom built
general 2021-04-13 02:39:57 Asus is a company that makes PCs and laptops
general 2021-04-13 02:40:46 Why is everyone purposefully making typos?
general 2021-04-13 02:41:40 ...
general 2021-04-13 02:43:05 Why do i have passport.mid stuck in my head
general 2021-04-13 02:44:12 The chat has gone quiet
general 2021-04-13 02:44:15 Nvm
general 2021-04-13 02:45:09 Must be annoying to live there
general 2021-04-13 02:47:03 I've seen people on reddit mess up more then that
general 2021-04-13 02:51:38 Should've blurred it out before you sent it
general 2021-04-13 02:53:55 Also can happen if you post an image with location metadata
general 2021-04-13 02:54:32 You should've blurred it out before posting it
general 2021-04-13 02:55:38 Great idea
general 2021-04-13 02:56:29 Doesn't matter, you posted the image, that means people can see it
general 2021-04-13 02:56:39 A VPN will do nothing about it
general 2021-04-13 02:58:27 A VPN wont help, what that does is it connects your device to a server, and encrypts your data towards it, that means that your IP will be based in a different location, but it doesn't mean you can post an image revealing your location and you change your IP location
general 2021-04-13 02:58:57 Well.. thats annoying
general 2021-04-13 02:59:45 Pictures can have location metadata
general 2021-04-13 03:01:43 WHY DOES ROBLOX DO THAT?!

general 2021-04-13 04:38:32 Hi
general 2021-04-13 04:38:43 How are you doing
general 2021-04-13 04:38:54 Oof
the-dump 2021-04-13 18:59:26 Autoclicker, i think you need to learn how to spell
bot-central 2021-04-13 19:01:21 !rank
bot-central 2021-04-13 19:02:05 !help
general 2021-04-13 19:05:46 Maybe use an adapter to use a keyboard and mouse and plug your device into a monitor
the-dump 2021-04-13 19:06:40 No, its not a virus, i coded it myself just for that purpose
the-dump 2021-04-13 19:11:42 The autoclicker that spells things wrong has updated, it still doesnt know how to spell
the-dump 2021-04-13 19:14:49 You'll be violating this rule if you do
You can see it in <#533294912586645521>
the-dump 2021-04-13 19:15:10 So probably a good idea not to
the-dump 2021-04-13 19:15:39 You can't rn
the-dump 2021-04-13 19:16:07 Plane Crazy doesnt have enough moderators
the-dump 2021-04-13 19:16:22 It says in <#623337136267067393>
general 2021-04-13 19:23:42 No, he left himself
general 2021-04-13 19:24:09 Not sure, i just looked at the chat and he said he was leaving
And said he'll come back another day
general 2021-04-13 19:25:28 Inline of the centre of mass, but also the centre of mass has to be in the middle
general 2021-04-13 19:26:18 The plane will tip backwards

bug-reports 2021-04-13 20:06:20 I'm pretty sure <-- scammer is roblox anti scam
Because i think i seen it in other games
general 2021-04-13 20:13:32 Probably so it isnt hardcoded
general 2021-04-13 20:13:40 So it would be easier to update
general 2021-04-13 20:14:53 Nope, hes busy
general 2021-04-13 20:15:44 Too lazy to submit rank requests
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:05:16 It clearly looks fake
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:07:19 Ok, i'll say some reasons why it is fake
1. The gui is not fitted to the screen properly
2. The gui is pixelated
3. The lighting is wrong
4. Some of the GUI is missing
5. Some of the GUI is stretched out
6. Where is the roblox and chat and ... icon?
7. It shows him in build mode when the build is outside the plot
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:09:21 Lights are available the blocks catagory
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:11:45 I said that in 7.
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:13:57 HA! Jetpack was available on the other one but its not available here!!!
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:16:09 Also, his jetpack gamepass can't randomly disappear!
And the gui is a bit pixelated but upscaled
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:21:08 Ok, because everyone doesn't believe your build is real, make your friend take a video of it WITHOUT SHADERS
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:23:12 The friend was on build mode, thats what he said
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:25:18 Wait, on that picture, Parachute is in English
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:27:20 But, that picture is in spanish! on this message: https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/831714828438601749
Also the slowmode is sooo long!!!!
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:31:19 Maybe everyone should carry on the converation in <#384021699466756107>
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:34:14 Hes on a full server, i tried using rosearcher to join him
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:40:32 Ok i'm in the server with him to prove if the build is real
I can't see his build anywhere but i am as laggy as ever
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:44:58 Yep, hes right, it is real
creations-chat 2021-04-14 03:18:49 Same

general 2021-04-14 05:42:57 I'm pretty sure rickje is rewriting the code
general 2021-04-14 05:43:51 So it can possible be added if rickje was rewriting all of the code
creations-chat 2021-04-14 08:27:35 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 06:10:21 Motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 06:14:16 But only have it on servo mode, because mouse control won't work, unless if its a rudder or pulling up/down
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 18:36:02 Has anyone else noticed the typo done on the winter/summer event items gamepass?
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 18:36:17 It says "acces" instead of access
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 18:38:00 
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 18:48:52 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 18:48:57 Its all over roblox
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 18:49:03 Even on the group wall
general 2021-08-07 01:50:29 That happened for me for a few minutes and i kept refreshing but then it came back
general 2021-09-18 09:32:19 I didn't do that, i told you you took it on IOS 10.2 on an IPhone 7
general 2021-09-26 22:54:41 Makes sense, a lot of people shorten it down to pc anyways
general 2021-09-26 22:55:15 Sun???
general 2021-09-26 23:02:07 Could've used inspect element
general 2021-09-26 23:03:36 And also could've been inspect element
general 2021-09-26 23:03:54 It's easy to fake someone sending a discord message
general 2021-09-26 23:05:07 That's better proof then an image which can easily be faked
general 2021-09-30 22:57:30 Do any of you guys know if Plane Crazy 2 will have early access?
general 2021-09-30 22:57:52 Ok
general 2021-09-30 22:58:37 "noob" yeah i guess you can call me that because i didnt verify for any role
general 2021-09-30 22:58:42 I'm just too lazy to

general 2021-09-30 23:02:36 Not nooby
general 2021-09-30 23:04:05 Yeah but comparing it to the rest of the community it's average or a bit above average

general 2022-06-11 04:55:05 I guess i won't say anything about it then
general 2022-06-11 04:56:44 Joy stick or A and D buttons
general 2022-06-11 05:05:19 He's probably trying to get a moderator to ban him
general 2023-02-26 07:32:25 The game is called Stormworks
general 2023-02-26 07:32:53 Stormworks is underrated tbh :/
general 2023-02-26 07:32:59 People need to know what it is

general 2023-02-26 07:44:07 Apparently
general 2023-02-26 07:44:17 And the "hacked photo" part
general 2023-02-26 07:44:21 He left in the metadata
