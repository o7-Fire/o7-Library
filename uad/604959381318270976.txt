general 2020-07-25 23:44:04 I just love simple planes and I just felt upset because it made me feel like someone was taking somebodys game that he spent time making, and making it free
general 2021-04-21 14:02:37 Sorry about the time I came here and assumed that this was copy of Simple Planes, I shouldn't of done that to this game, this game is very good, and because they are similar, I understand it very well. Again, sorry.
