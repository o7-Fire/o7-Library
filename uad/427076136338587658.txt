plane-crazy 2019-08-25 01:35:37 can someone suggest hitmarkers for when guns hit? I need a rank to suggest but I dont have one
bug-reports 2019-08-26 17:01:53 I've had a few battles in pvp and gun damage only seems to be on your own side, I've shot someone out of their guided missile and they were just a floating seat, on their end however, they didn't take any damage. after being strafed by someone, I was supposedly down 1 engine (I was in a 4 prop bomber) but on my screen I wasn't. When I spawned in a warship and the guided missile guy attacked, the tnt did break my creation, so TNT seems to work but guns don't (guns do work but its client side and results in ghost machines if you break a chunk off)
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 10:48:30 unintentional fleet? i mean i did try to shoot his aircraft down
bug-reports 2019-08-31 13:42:34 seriously, fix pvp, when i shoot someone their vehicle sometimes freezes but they are somewhere else and would just shoot me and all i would see are their bullets
bug-reports 2019-09-02 00:25:18 gun damage is still local, i think its just that on your screen you done enough damage to break a part, but on their screen you didnt quite break it. but we still got flying wing sections or invisible planes. pvp is still broken
bug-reports 2019-09-02 17:13:04 no
bug-reports 2019-09-02 17:13:18 
bug-reports 2019-09-02 17:13:35 though before the last update, i did
bug-reports 2019-09-02 17:13:39 but same issue
plane-crazy 2019-09-02 23:44:31 
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 11:53:15 could someone suggest laser pointer blocks? "laser pointers would produce a near endless beam, this can help aim weapons"
plane-crazy 2019-09-05 11:53:27 im unable to suggest so
bug-reports 2019-09-19 18:55:08 reasons why pvp needs to be fixed:
bug-reports 2019-09-19 18:55:15 what i see
bug-reports 2019-09-19 18:55:28 what my friend sees
bug-reports 2019-09-20 23:43:45 sometimes motor 2 just spins around rather than aim at the courser
bug-reports 2019-09-21 09:42:38 https://gyazo.com/e11a902edcafebe3605e3ca7f6ea68df sometimes it happens when you spawn in with a vehicle using motor 2, im always in pvp so i dont know if its just in that
bug-reports 2019-09-21 09:43:13 not sure if this is the debug menu tho
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 15:00:32 R 15 is a good update because you can Tpose on people
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 15:00:33 change my mind
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 15:26:09 ja
general 2019-10-14 20:22:37 whats new?
general 2019-10-14 20:22:47 i joined just as teleport so i couldnt see the popup
general 2019-10-14 20:23:16 ooo
general 2019-10-14 20:23:34 
bug-reports 2019-11-27 23:36:31 not motor 2, but motor 1 and conveyors, if you use the conveyors to move then you turn the motors, then the 2 conveyors collide they fling you around
bug-reports 2019-11-27 23:37:08 proof
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 23:24:58 
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 23:25:43 too bad i couldnt blow their plane up, was the non pvp server ðŸ˜¦
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 23:29:47 also the signs are kinda half useless since roblox puts practically anything i put in a hashtag
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 23:30:08 try putting like V . 01 and its like, well, you saw what happened to the chat about an hour ago
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 23:33:12 it lowkey looks like Gru's Car
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 23:39:08 made a vtol and it somewhat works :D
plane-crazy 2019-12-03 23:48:34 when the vitamin gummies kick in
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:36:33 how am i even ment to deal with these?
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:36:42 player mouse guided missiles
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:36:59 i like pvp just those things are in every server
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:37:14 should just be a banned design since it renders literally all other weapons useless
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:37:41 well i like pvp
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:37:43 just not those things
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 14:39:01 but i aint les
help 2019-12-12 20:33:00 it auto puts lift in center of mass
help 2019-12-12 20:33:22 but if the plane like, dips forwards, put 1 slightly infront of COM
help 2019-12-12 20:33:24 ect ect
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:03:31 rocket pod?

plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:03:57 looks like a rocket pod so yea
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:04:19 i mean he added a cannon so this is probably a weapons update so

bug-reports 2019-12-30 19:53:12 pvp is still broken, you sometimes break a part or many parts on your screen and somtimes it makes the whole enemy vehicle freeze, but on their screen its completely fine, please fix this bug, it has been around for ages and you have not fixed this pvp gamebreaking bug
bug-reports 2019-12-30 20:10:20 yea that pvp bug is ruining the game for me, i was hyped for todays update only to lose interest when i hit a guy with missiles and suddenly im being hunted by some ghost plane. **very fun indeed**

plane-crazy 2020-06-22 13:18:31 so what exactly does water jet do?
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 13:19:06 i was thinking like some sort of water cutter / push back
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 13:19:51 10,000 psi water jet vs foldable battleship  gone wrong!!1!
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 13:23:35 tested water jet, it does nothing to builds but hurts players and pushes them back
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 13:23:56 so its more anti boarding / sfx

the-dump 2021-07-26 16:18:22 thats also true
the-dump 2021-08-07 20:26:06 not really good because theres a moderately large gacha life game on roblox, most of the users of GL would likely migrate to roblox instead...

the-dump 2022-03-30 01:33:25 of all the things on that, the most unrealistic is how they called it 'reliable'
the-dump 2022-03-31 22:45:56 "let people enjoy things" also includes letting people hate others , thus the statement targets itself
the-dump 2022-04-14 00:19:42 you can make an entire short story composed entirely of every variation of that word, and people who dont know welsh wouldnt have a clue that its just a dictionary for 1 word
