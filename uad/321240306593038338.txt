plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:34:29 we win because we're better
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:36:33 thats propably because you can only make custom
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:37:26 a toy
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:37:50 thats still custom on some level
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:37:53 because theyre not real
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:38:25 *it was a joke*
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:39:08 does that even work?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:39:33 also i barely see any mechs which arent custom
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:39:40 maybe 1/1000 isnt custom
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:40:11 i have never seen a boston dynamics robot in this game
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:40:46 and i was talking about ingame?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:40:50 so whats your argument even
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:41:17 so are mechs
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:41:25 theyre just moving clumps of metal with arms and legs
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:42:27 neither are planes?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:42:37 its only copy paste if they are the exact same block to block
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:43:07 ok mig-21 and a10 and f4 is overmade
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:43:15 thats very untrue
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:43:29 theres thousands of different planes
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:43:43 not everybody makes a f18
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:43:52 thats just wrong
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:43:54 very wrong
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:44:07 not everybody makes a a10 either
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:44:11 i was making a example
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:44:33 bro what?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:44:44 same goes with planes
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:44:56 so goes with planes too
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:45:27 they also have different block choices
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:45:39 ok so?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:47:37 same thing goes with planes
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:47:41 you have no point here
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:48:07 thats because mechs are less built
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:48:12 cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:48:34 the contest wont change much
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:49:07 no?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:49:12 theres different cockpit styles
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:49:28 cylindercockpit
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:49:57 no?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:50:02 its not about piston lock
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:50:08 its just basic motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:50:31 and every mech i've seen looks the same
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:51:38 i could pull up 3 pics of plane that are wildly different in wings, body shape, cockpit etc
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:53:30 and a plane builder will use his style on it
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:53:45 plane building isnt just about blueprint realism
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:54:50 like adding a wedge on a headðŸ¤£
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:55:13 planes?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:55:15 thank you
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:55:28 whats complex about a mech
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:55:34 your 2 motors which move the arm?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:56:08 planes are just as complex
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:56:16 have you seen motorlock?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:57:03 im just imagining mods viewing us right now waiting for a person to start saying slurs
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:57:26 -
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:58:02 no moving parts?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:58:06 do you have a brain
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:58:24 elevators
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:58:25 rudders
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:58:48 i can count on my fingers what moves on mechs
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:59:12 legs, arms, head, cockpit opening stuff
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:00:00 ok feet arms
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:00:04 thats all left
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:00:14 i didnt say that
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:00:17 that was another guy
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:00:31 also does it matter what moves during flight?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:00:36 what matters is before
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:00:54 arms, legs, legs.
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:01:57 oh so my 7 moving parts to motorlock doesnt count as complexity?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:04:15 they dont need them
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:04:56 they need legs joints and arms joints
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:04:58 boom done
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:05:03 and you put way more
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:05:09 which are just for luxury
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:06:24 and theyre are several things there
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:07:15 you mean you are a vulnerable opponent
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:07:36 you cant defend against jets
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:07:47 you just get yeeted off the map
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:08:07 thats a lie
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:08:16 most super engine using jets can go above 450
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:08:48 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:08:50 there arent
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:09:13 i have flown away from several shredders going 450
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:09:45 imagine not having a 2700 speed jet
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:10:05 haha warcrime go brrrrrr
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:11:45 i like people who make mechs, i know it takes skill
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:11:52 but i specifically hate spaceship builders
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:12:06 i have never liked a singular person who builds spaceships as the only thing they do
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:13:00 r/Braincels
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:13:32 bro what?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:13:41 the contest topic isnt just ''plane''
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:14:10 kind of like how the contest topic shouldnt be just ''mech''
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:14:29 did you read what i said
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:14:48 and you can make a boat/plane/car/mech
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:15:48 ofcourse they changed the topic to the most boring one
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:17:04 they changed it to ruins
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:17:11 this is gonna be a boring contest
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:17:19 i dont think a singular person actually wants ruins
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:17:55 i'd prefer mechs
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:19:10 i'd want mechs over ruins
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:19:12 that says alot
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:19:24 because i've sworn to myself to never make a spaceship or mech
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:19:57 i hate spaceship builders
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:20:18 have you ever checked the downvotes of very good planes?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:20:26 its always only spaceship builders downvoting them
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:20:46 theyre literal beta males
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:20:50 they have a phobia of wings
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:21:21 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:21:23 theyre that bad
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:24:50 what?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:25:38 are you trying to diss my plane from 2020?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:27:39 why did you put this?
