plane-crazy 2021-11-08 05:52:47 idk
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 05:53:06 zeppelins are bad for pvp but that doesnt mean they cant fight off a horde of planes

plane-crazy 2021-11-10 04:24:44 his bot still looks better than any bot ive ever created
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 04:25:29 i tried to copy some gen lock bipedal but miserably failed
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 04:28:14 are you using motors to spin the rotors
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 04:28:23 or are you using engines to spin them engines
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 04:28:51 might wanna use rockets or propellers to spin the blades instead
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 04:29:32 the best use of making a motor-powered spinning blade is on a build with two or more rotors
plane-crazy 2021-11-10 04:35:44 if i count all of the super rockets ive used on all 35 builds i have id say i only have about 14 in those builds

plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:14:38 the bug is that when the game autoloads the sparkler always faces a certain direction
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:14:56 its small but for me its kinda annoying

plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:20:01 boopies
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:21:08 that think looks like hell
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:21:33 if you gonna replicate that in plane crazy id estimate it would have to be at least 20 blocks high even when highly compressed
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:22:02 or if you just gonna add those wheels in for detail but theyre not gonna move you can just use propellers
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:22:10 and shorten it to at least 7-10
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:25:36 or just like what he said
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:25:57 build a big wheel using blocks, then put snow or regular wheels inside
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:36:26 how do you use disconnectors for barrels
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:36:46 do you like keep the long part
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:36:56 ohhh
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:37:02 i didnt know that was a technique
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:37:08 just thought its a bug
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:37:38 speaking of blocky
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:37:47 i wonder what plane crazy 2 looks like

plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:41:15 and if theres a highway theres a place where we can drift
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:41:37 where
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:41:52 /how do you know this
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:42:00 oh
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:42:05 the moon surface thingy
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:42:17 yeah i only use that for testing rovers
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:42:27 kik
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:43:21 if i ever made a map it would have some more polygons
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:43:38 yes
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:43:44 private server is very worth it
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:44:01 dont really get it but ok
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:47:24 some pvp servers dont really have alot of fighting going on
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:47:31 so its not as bad as back then anymore
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:49:06 there is such thing as an anti shredder
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:49:31 yes
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:49:57 i dont even know how that works
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:50:02 i only work with steampunk
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:50:24 you try it with simpler prototypes before you make a detailed ship
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:50:57 ok
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:51:07 lets see if my dumb brain can figure out some problem
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:51:47 to hide the motor underwater, that means you gotta build one part of the boat upside down
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:52:21 im assuming the main pilot seat will be on the part that stays up so when you deploy it, the folding part touches water?
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:52:46 that can work
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:53:06 oh yeah if youre building a small ship you can do that
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:53:41 i spawned a carrier with that technique, the folding piece went underwater and never came back up again
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:53:52 rip 3000 block builb
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 08:54:06 wat design

plane-crazy 2021-12-15 09:45:59 you've advanced too far into technology to go admire the simpler builders
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 09:46:13 and yes exposed motor lock is ugly but still useful
creations-chat 2021-12-15 09:47:32 its like a war of the worlds design, think of it as a tank designed by a guy in 1921 who saw them mark Vs
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 09:50:45 my 1 year old build do be getting downvoted
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 09:54:41 what do you mean by build area reduced
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 09:54:48 i was hoping for a much bigger plot
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 09:55:14 i can never build a 1:1 carrier because im limited by the technology of my brain
creations-chat 2021-12-15 09:56:13 build was a year old, might remaster it some time

plane-crazy 2021-12-15 10:53:06 for some reason the blacklist box is the perfect test building
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 10:53:23 i used blacklist boxes to test my robot's climbing abilities
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 10:53:44 and also to test naval aircraft since the big box is as long as a carrier deck

plane-crazy 2021-12-15 12:02:33 engine should not include: pre-made engines
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 02:18:32 thankfully those buildings in the background are made out of military grade chobham lego armor

plane-crazy 2021-12-16 07:56:21 can you imagine that
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 07:56:32 we started working on planes because we dreamt about flying
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 07:56:47 and one hundred years later everyone is making planes to destroy everyone
creations-chat 2021-12-16 07:59:34 it looks like a green flying stingray with  malnourished wings
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 08:00:08 people do be downvoting my second tank
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 08:00:18 what do you mean no way
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 08:00:37 just put a cylinder tube thing on the window part
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 08:00:50 and yes its only been 5 hours since i made that
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 08:01:31 then theres literally no way to make a fully functional turret
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 08:01:37 you may have to redesign
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 08:01:52 dunno
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 08:01:59 build a tank around the tank gun
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 08:02:02 like the A10
creations-chat 2021-12-16 08:03:15 i dont know how to compress it to look like that
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 08:04:16 time to build
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 08:04:22 a fucking m24 platoon
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 08:04:34 i mean an m24 platoon
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 08:05:07 or maybe just a scorpion tank
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 08:05:17 brb gotta watch some red vs blue
creations-chat 2021-12-16 08:06:33 i guess i gotta uncheck the "as small as possible" box in my brain
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 08:31:08 why are you using full blocks btw
creations-chat 2021-12-17 02:15:44 a process of trial and error
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 02:17:36 something is definitely wrong with my brain
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 02:18:08 im making tanks with simplified building skills
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 02:19:08 imagine making a simple tank design because youre also considering its ability to be mass produced
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 02:19:20 i can never make a detailed m24
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 02:20:03 anything can be mass produced but everyone does not have the time to wait
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 02:20:31 T-34s were super simplified because they needed to send tanks to the frontlines everyday
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 02:20:57 use engines to turn
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 02:22:12 speaking of snow blasters
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 02:22:25 i only discovered yesterday that snow blasters are a thing, and that theyre engines
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 02:22:58 i guess i kinda forgot because i didnt really see a use for it
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 02:23:27 am currently building anti aircraft using it
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 02:23:46 why did they ban snow blasters
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 02:24:26 stuff

plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:15:28 its originally supposed to be a KV-2
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:15:44 but the turret looked like an m60/m551
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 10:16:08 instead of 1942 i advanced it to 2254

creations-chat 2023-01-05 06:22:44 how do you define 'Good Creations'
creations-chat 2023-01-05 06:36:34 A good creation? something fun, something glitchy, a machine that either simulates physics or breaks it. Something you can pull out of your saves and have a fun roleplay, or something you can reproduce with ease.
creations-chat 2023-01-05 06:39:36 even with the given complexity we can have in this game, we must not forget that Rickje's intetions were to give us a game for fun, and fun wont be achieved with looks alone
creations-chat 2023-01-05 07:23:57 why does that guy hate roleplay
creations-chat 2023-01-05 07:30:27 you never had a simulation tank combat roleplay? i had fun with 6 friends in european and soviet tanks

creations-chat 2023-01-09 12:05:15 
creations-chat 2023-01-09 12:13:09 my detachable f1 wheels were made with the intent to have the ability to replace the wheels, thus needing pit crew. i hit a wall, the wheel flew, and next thing i know i was heavily invested in flying wheels
creations-chat 2023-01-09 12:15:43 everything can look like a tutorial
creations-chat 2023-01-09 12:18:21 i definitely did a senna into a wall <@551376778552410113>  my F1 is a Benetton-Renault B195, i think the rope you were talking about was not present in this type of chassis (94-95 grand prix)
creations-chat 2023-01-09 12:23:13 there are lots of good things about Formula one in the 90s, one of them is having a V12 engine. You cant master a 'V12 Monster' in today's F1 games, for that you'd have to go back to the PlayStation and play F1 96
creations-chat 2023-01-09 12:28:38 that is true, the only Codemasters F1 game that i think feels realistic is the first one <@773474989751664640> whats ip log

general 2023-04-17 02:04:42 Is that he cant build a single thing that has no motorlock
