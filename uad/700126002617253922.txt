The Tale of Captain_Ravioli (700126002617253922)
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 05:52:57 Bruh I have made 2 boats, 1 big one small, and neither are balanced
help 2022-02-09 03:59:12 I made a bomber and when my cursor went up it went up but I added a bomb bay door and bombs and now it's inverted, anyone have this happen and know how to fix it? I don't want to replace the wings because it's more wing than bomber and will take forever
help 2022-02-09 12:44:15 I spawn at my plot but it worked before, I didn't mess with the wings after that test flight
help 2022-02-09 12:46:19 Same place. I start at my plot when testing my builds so I can know it's not where I am that's the problem. First time it worked. Rest of the times it was inverted and I haven't messed with the wings
help 2022-02-09 13:01:25 Friend had a similar problem and just redid the wings but I don't want to do that because there's a lot of wing
help 2022-02-09 14:06:58 "Sorry for the late reply" then say what you were going to. That's what I do (idk if this is the best thing to say but it works for me)
