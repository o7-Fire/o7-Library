bug-reports 2020-03-03 06:51:40 Hi, I joined this discord server to report a problem or bug design aircraft, yesterday I tried to make a plane with the half parts, and although they had a small design that counted as half a block, their space occupied an entire block, making the plane ugly, could you fix this bug please?
general 2020-03-03 06:53:39 FIX THE LATEST UPDATE >:v/
general 2020-03-03 06:54:29 :,v

general 2020-03-03 06:59:07 FIX THE LATEST UPDATE >:v
general 2020-03-03 07:00:40 What is the need to be toxic?
bug-reports 2020-03-03 07:14:19 but the game was not like that before, I let you put a half block on top of another half block, and so on, but now take that half block as if it were a complete block and leave nothing stuck to that half block
bug-reports 2020-03-03 07:15:59 but I can't make better airplanes anymore, I just have to settle for a cube and the other planes I made before
bug-reports 2020-03-03 07:16:37 but that problem is since the last update
bug-reports 2020-03-03 07:16:44 ok
bug-reports 2020-03-04 06:52:40 I'm still waiting for them to fix this bug ... lol
bug-reports 2020-03-04 07:28:37 <@!217336009455566848> ok
bug-reports 2020-03-04 07:30:21 As I was showing in the video, the block does not get there, not because of logic, but because the game takes the half block as a complete block. although now in less than 1 hour I could make a plane, something ugly.
bug-reports 2020-03-04 07:32:02 no, before I could create without that bug, but in the last update everything was complicated.
bug-reports 2020-03-04 07:32:19 ok

bug-reports 2020-03-04 07:38:00 ok
bug-reports 2020-03-04 07:38:14 wait i'm looking for something

bug-reports 2020-03-04 07:39:39 look the green lines
bug-reports 2020-03-04 07:50:32 somehow, or maybe bugged, but before the update it wasn't like that.
bug-reports 2020-03-04 07:51:41 but, pls, fix it.
bug-reports 2020-03-04 07:53:44 I did that, but it didn't work. Although I do not remember.
bug-reports 2020-03-04 07:57:19 No, it didn't work to get the arrow out, I think it's bugged.
bug-reports 2020-03-04 07:58:39 It works the same with ALL blocks, none is saved. (among the half obviously)
bug-reports 2020-03-04 07:59:27 ok
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:00:22 
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:03:37 No

bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:06:07 Once I was about to make a plane with the half blocks, but I stopped because the frame had gone out of place, I was with that thing for 2 days until I entered the discord and complained.
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:08:08 yes, a little more upwards, making it impossible to place another half block to complete a block.
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:08:56 yes
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:09:26 
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:09:27 ._.
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:11:16 turning it twice would not help, and if I switch to a normal block, what would half block entonses do? If it counts as a normal block, it would not be fulfilling its purpose.
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:12:17 I'm talking about that, I can't put ANYTHING exactly above, just another block above, but NEVER above
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:13:42 watch again the video that happens, and see the green frame of the half block, those are the frames of the previous update.
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:15:28 if that change, you can not put something on top of a half block, only above, now I can not build a good plane even with cheats.
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:16:01 ?
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:16:03 no
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:16:39 The only cheat I have is the cheat engine, and not much can be done in that game with the cheat engine.
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:17:07 no
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:19:37 Yes, but if I have to put a half block, in the middle of where only that fits, then it would not work, it would only be bugged by making it go one way.
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:20:05 That was the main reason I complained.
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:21:10 that I wanted to make a plane, but I could not put the blocks well, and it was horrible.
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:23:10 
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:23:51 Then, what? Am I the only one to whom this problem happened? If you want, I ask others.
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:24:51 That is my complaint
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:26:08 and then why did they change that?
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:26:35 Why change something that was already great? Do they do the same thing they did with robocraft?
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:27:22 Well what you say.
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:28:36 i have a one plane
bug-reports 2020-03-04 08:35:05 Well, neither of you had anything I said, maybe if you're right, wasted hours talking to you.
