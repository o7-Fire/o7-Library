plane-crazy 2018-09-30 13:00:17 <@!217336009455566848> Are you able to rank? In <#384025409945337856> I posted a Rocket Build with a launch platform.
plane-crazy 2018-09-30 13:02:38 Okay
plane-crazy 2018-09-30 18:44:51 Aye
plane-crazy 2018-09-30 22:18:08 Currently making a submrine that doubles as a VTOL because why not
plane-crazy 2018-10-01 00:21:24 Welcome
help 2018-10-01 01:29:56 Technician rank is for vertical takeoff vehicles, and a copter would be included <@163143541160148992>
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 21:17:39 Yeah you really can't make rail guns.
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 21:32:10 How did you make it <@!339519624968404993> ?
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 21:32:29 I probably did something wrong with the magnet strength
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 21:34:42 Ah I see.
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 21:34:47 Can you show me a pic?
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 21:37:35 Oof
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:29:07 I'm currently trying to replocate this
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:29:08 
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:29:20 Replicate*
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:29:36 It will have a rail gun powered Missle Launcher
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:31:37 Would I get the Inventor role if I were to make a submarine with a rail gun power missle launcher since nobody has made it before?
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:32:01 I said Submarine with rail gun powered missles
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:33:33 Hmm
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:33:53 Okay
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:33:56 Let's see
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:31:10 Heh
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:36:52 Yeah that would be a good idea.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:39:20 By make, do you mean make one yourself or go to the one in announcements?
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:40:36 Hotness
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:41:05 Just a few months ago the average players on the game was like 50
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:41:46 Yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:43:19 Well that is one way to introduce yourself.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:45:42 I think he expected to be respected for saying the N word and trying to claim superiority?
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:49:29 Icy.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:51:06 I just realized. After a long time of thinking, September is before October. Crap.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:11:56 Woah.
