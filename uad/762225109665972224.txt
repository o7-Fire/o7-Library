contest-chat 2022-03-17 04:10:55 IFV: "an armoured combat vehicle which is designed and equipped primarily to transport a combat infantry squad, and which is armed with an integral or organic cannon of at least 20 millimeters calibre and sometimes an antitank missile launcher"
contest-chat 2022-03-17 04:11:05 it fits the definition
