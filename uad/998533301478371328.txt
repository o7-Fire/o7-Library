plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:17:17 Funny animatronic
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:17:52 I can see why
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:18:16 build mode ^^
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:19:45 Aint "He" a she though.?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:21:58 The rules are kinda harsh yet also reasonable
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:23:11 I agree.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:23:53 Damn bro shredder ball 💀
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:25:21 Lmao imbalance
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:35:36 Yeah maybe making the red part a little bigger
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:35:45 possibly like 3 - 4 blocks bigger?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:36:00 M i n e c r a f t .
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:36:37 By depth you mean..?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:37:22 Not really much you can do that doesnt need motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:37:37 Why? Does your Prop plane/Jet have large wings?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:37:58 Then i have suggestion if you'd like, but its quite heavy.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:39:09 Ive built an MQ-101 before
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:39:47 but heres my suggestion if you'd like to build it
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:39:58 Its pretty heavy
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:40:20 Just make sure you have room for it haha,
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:40:24 Cutters are to large
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:40:43 they take up a full block space and sometimes you need half blocks
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:40:56 Not really
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:41:03 once locked they turn into halfblocks
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:41:27 I only usually use it for larger jets
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:41:49 Lol.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:44:07 Honestly i don't really like cutters for the front part of wings due to their size but you can do whatever you want anyway.
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:48:01 Thats some pretty damn good reverse thrust
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:48:30 Oh shit your jet is big enough for a conveyor engine??
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:49:03 Bullshittery!
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:51:12 I finished the other eye for my animatronic, now i have to figure out how to make the mouth
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:52:12 I have a big keyboard so its kinda hard to press the buttons without pressing another
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 15:54:13 If they were i'd have women swarming me 😭

general 2023-01-02 01:38:32 There are already cybernetic furries, they're called protogens or as I like to call them. Toaster brains.
