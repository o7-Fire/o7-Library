bot-central 2021-04-03 13:12:06 nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 13:14:32 Maybe just make a Vehicle out of Explosive block then explode when they swarming you
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 13:15:11 Also Golden Bars together can resist the cutter
plane-crazy 2021-04-03 14:33:47 To get Aeronautical Engineer rank you can set Control Surface to Manual and Automatic right?

Just add a Motor 2 and set Speed and MaxTorque at maximum

creations-chat 2021-04-12 13:10:31 light and gun are at the left wing
there is nothing at the right wing
creations-chat 2021-04-12 13:12:32 Yes on the Mk.IV but there are 7 variants of Blenheim so maybe?
creations-chat 2021-04-12 14:43:51 After I put custom propellers on my Blenheim my speed from 400+ came down to 228
