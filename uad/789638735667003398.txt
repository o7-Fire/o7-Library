plane-crazy 2022-09-13 01:40:03 les hope it wont get delayed
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 01:40:19 ye
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 01:40:30 I'm used to things being cancelled by now.
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 01:40:38 game released dates, celebreties
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 01:41:00 we can still hope >:/
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 01:42:39 cockpit is too gradual in the frojnt
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 01:42:57 and that flat bit before the nose cone doesnt need to be there
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 01:43:03 try that
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 01:45:11 B-1 lancer reminds me of the russian concord
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 01:50:43 Looks a bit better ye
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 01:50:59 you'll only know once you have a little bit of it built
general 2022-09-13 19:11:01 SLS does look cool but you're going to have to accept the fact starship will be superior
general 2022-09-13 19:11:21 just stating facts..
general 2022-09-13 19:11:54 Starship will be fully reuseable, Cheaper, It uses liquid methane for its main fuel.
general 2022-09-13 19:11:59 I never said sls was overbudget btw
general 2022-09-13 19:12:27 lsls
general 2022-09-13 19:14:28 Another thing, When the sls program  is finished, the US Government will be relying on Space X anyway
general 2022-09-13 19:14:54 Potato Potato
general 2022-09-13 19:15:15 Thats ur tone
general 2022-09-13 19:15:26 10 years of development
general 2022-09-13 19:16:06 Its also Nasa's Only hope
general 2022-09-13 19:17:04 If Nasa had atleast a quarter of the Militaries budget, They would be leading in Rocket development most likely.
general 2022-09-13 19:18:24 They arent.
general 2022-09-13 19:18:45 Except for JWS, That thing is COOL
general 2022-09-13 19:18:59 That doesnt mean they're leading in Development
general 2022-09-13 19:19:02 PFFF
general 2022-09-13 19:19:08 same thing
general 2022-09-13 19:19:32 You know what I meant.
general 2022-09-13 19:19:36 its a habbit
general 2022-09-13 19:20:20 They are leading with their Space telescope tech, but they dont have many rockets in development
general 2022-09-13 19:20:35 I'm not a nasa fanboy
general 2022-09-13 19:21:03 I would be in violation of the discord TOS, no I am not.
general 2022-09-13 19:21:15 I know they aren't competing.
general 2022-09-13 19:21:43 They have a contract with SpaceX for their moonlandings
general 2022-09-13 19:22:53 Are you talking about the booster or the 2nd stage?
general 2022-09-13 19:23:23 Suicide landings are much more efficient, since you already have the fuel to burn.
general 2022-09-13 19:23:35 Plus its 8 years in development.
general 2022-09-13 19:23:45 maybe not
general 2022-09-13 19:27:41 Simming
general 2023-03-15 23:38:36 PC2 development dead?
