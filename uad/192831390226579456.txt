help 2019-10-19 02:57:13 Whenever I decide to put my very first folding vehicle into play mode, it decides to just freeze halfway through the fall and stop functioning entirely.
help 2019-10-19 02:57:31 It just hangs out in the air above the water, nothing working, with one half of it descending half a block before stopping
help 2019-10-19 03:00:30 Apparently I have to jump in and out of my seat for the ship to update
help 2019-10-19 03:10:15 no not motor lock, like the whole vehicle itself just freezes
