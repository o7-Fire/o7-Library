plane-crazy 2022-11-12 04:28:58 I might make the hood next
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 04:29:14 Although I have no experience in that area
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 04:32:24 I started a few days ago so I’m clueless
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 04:34:01 How would u make a destroyer
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 04:34:13 I mean, when it’s cut in the middle

general 2022-11-12 05:27:38 But it does look cool <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-11-12 05:29:06 O thx! I’m thinking about making some kind of destroyer bc cruisers can’t do PvP lol- I made the same mistake when making my sr-71, it’s a recon plane.

creations-chat 2022-11-16 20:23:19 <@691799323926855719> that’s a pretty damn accurate ship, I have an idea of which one you based it on. I would put more detail onto the deck, and perhaps on the side hull. When it comes to the front, make it look a bit more smooth.
creations-chat 2022-11-16 20:27:16 These are pretty damn similar, good job <@691799323926855719>, although curving that front of the main tower thing might help
creations-chat 2022-11-16 20:29:18 I’m just trying not to be a piece of shit to people lol

plane-crazy 2022-12-07 02:19:59 perhaps i could make it so it turns, but that's pretty much it.
