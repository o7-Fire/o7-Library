The Tale of lbozoisnowthefrontier (693858288910991370)
general 2020-10-13 16:35:26 hello
general 2020-10-13 16:36:08 i made the most cursed plane ever
general 2020-10-13 16:37:04 yes i did
general 2020-10-13 16:38:00 imabout to show u the ucursed thing ever existed
general 2020-10-13 16:38:30 ok what the fuck i didnt expect any swearing
general 2020-10-13 16:39:46 
general 2020-10-13 16:40:03 wronng plane
general 2020-10-13 16:40:05 XD
general 2020-10-13 16:40:40 eee nvm YOU KNOW WHAT FINE
general 2020-10-13 16:41:18 just go do whatever the fuck you were doing'
general 2020-10-13 16:41:43 STOP HITTING Me this guy is ruining my space shuttle
general 2020-10-13 16:44:46 BRUH SOME DDE CRASHING INTO ME AND I BLACKLISTED HIM **why**
general 2020-10-13 16:45:44 i have 700 bobux
general 2020-10-13 16:46:06 im saving up money to buy more **bobux**
general 2020-10-13 16:47:02 my space shuttle looks like someone shit on it
general 2020-10-13 16:47:27 ***hahaha very funny**
general 2020-10-13 16:48:50 whats the most powerful engine and if so how much force can they exel
general 2020-10-13 16:49:10 is the super rocket engine the most powerful?
general 2020-10-13 16:50:02 i slapped like 30 super rocket engines on a 40 block plane and the max speed was 800
general 2020-10-13 16:50:28 ok
general 2020-10-13 16:50:43 the problem is mine is a space shuttle
general 2020-10-13 16:52:01 does it need to touch somerthinng to move the object/plane
general 2020-10-13 16:52:21 we are like eggs, brown or white, we are same on the inside
general 2020-10-13 16:54:46 if you could modify the super rocket engines and make them more powerful. my space shuttle would be sonic
general 2020-10-13 16:55:14 **my space shuttle is noob and i didnt finish the build**
general 2020-10-13 16:55:54 
general 2020-10-13 16:55:59 its not finished yet so it look uugly
general 2020-10-13 16:56:11 oom in?
general 2020-10-13 16:56:13 k
general 2020-10-13 16:56:47 
general 2020-10-13 16:56:56 not zoomed in yet. oo[
general 2020-10-13 16:57:23 **cooperate mouse roller**
general 2020-10-13 16:57:35 there is a tutorial to make a space shuttle
general 2020-10-13 16:57:59 but i didnt follow it because im a noob :  )
general 2020-10-13 16:58:55 i like how my rocket boosters cant even pull themselves up
general 2020-10-13 16:59:20 did u guys know that **the large rockets are weaker then the super rocket engines**
general 2020-10-13 16:59:41 and that became a huge problem
general 2020-10-13 17:00:07 because the rocket boosters that are supposed to provide 80% of the thrust, does 1%
general 2020-10-13 17:00:37 i was talking about my space shuttle
general 2020-10-13 17:00:56 now my cat is mad
general 2020-10-13 17:01:45 **why the fuck is my space shuttle going downwards the center of gravity and lift is **ALLINGED**
general 2020-10-13 17:02:13 the easiest role to get is verified
general 2020-10-13 17:02:44 if they make a moon planet if you go 100000k feet then im gonna go away pretty fast
general 2020-10-13 17:03:11 that rocket looks like it has the power of an amoeba
general 2020-10-13 17:03:45 > since when <@!693858288910991370>
<@!163143541160148992> since i found out how to lie
general 2020-10-13 17:04:50 > test it
<@!527653676022628353> i believe its 40
general 2020-10-13 17:05:02 > how many blocks does super thruster lift
<@456226577798135808> i believe its 40
general 2020-10-13 17:05:24 **i quoted the wrong guy oh shit**
general 2020-10-13 17:06:00 a large rocket engine lifts arund a measly **20**
general 2020-10-13 17:06:42 
general 2020-10-13 17:06:53 **my shuttle is stuck oh fuk**'
general 2020-10-13 17:07:18 theres some guy speaking poopoo idk why
general 2020-10-13 17:09:07 **did a parachute just stopped me from 800 mph**
bot-central 2020-10-13 17:09:41 ?av
general 2020-10-13 17:10:17 nobody:
general 2020-10-13 17:10:31 america: **football fileds per cat**
general 2020-10-13 17:11:15 ????????
general 2020-10-13 17:12:55 its called **mirrur**
general 2020-10-13 17:13:43 do you guys know how to change it so that my space shuttle doesnt fall apart whenever i go to fast
general 2020-10-13 17:15:42 i swear insted of saying "lifftoff, space shuttle atlantis" i said "lifftoff, space shuttle obligers"
general 2020-10-13 17:16:18 rememberm sts 52
general 2020-10-14 05:13:45 i like how the huge jet engine is the most powerful jet engine and yet it cant even lift its own weight
general 2020-10-14 05:15:01 Hey guys, how would you recommend me balance the center of gravity and the center of lift on a space shuttle?
general 2020-10-14 05:15:26 Is it because they weigh the most?
general 2020-10-14 05:15:47 Oh ok
general 2020-10-14 05:15:48 Thx
general 2020-10-14 05:16:23 Now im just replacing the stupid jet engines that cant even lift they’re own weight
general 2020-10-14 06:24:43 whats the density of a normal 4x1 beam
general 2020-10-14 06:25:25 because i want to know how much weight can 1 super rocket engine lift
general 2020-10-14 06:27:41 yes....thats pretty obvious
general 2020-10-14 06:28:02 a ballast block you can change its weigh
general 2020-10-14 06:28:39 so by using that density scale you can show how much force is used to ush 1 block by setting the weigh to just the right ammount
general 2020-10-14 08:59:53 **officially unnoficial server**
general 2020-10-14 09:01:19 ur name in roblox is planecrazybelike?
general 2020-10-14 09:06:47 plane crazy is like the fuckin opposite of motion blur
general 2020-10-14 09:11:58 i just put 80 super rocket engines on a 120 block plane
general 2020-10-14 09:13:10 YO I JUST CLIPPED THROUGH THE GROUND AND RAILS WTFFFFFFF
general 2020-10-14 09:13:41 
general 2020-10-14 09:13:45 GUYS LIKE WTF I CLIPPED

general 2020-10-21 02:18:09 i didnt lose my data 😄
general 2020-10-21 02:18:25 otherwise i would have lost like 30 hours of work
general 2020-10-21 02:18:39 i had a heart attack'
general 2020-10-21 02:19:07 was it a problem in the code or something'

general 2020-10-23 09:58:46 YO MY WHOLE SHUTTLE DISSAPEARED IN THE WATER WTF
general 2020-10-25 13:23:24 LMAO SOME KID GETTING MAD BECAUSE I BLACKLISTED HIM AND NOW HE REPORTING LOL
general 2020-10-25 16:05:25 they should make it so that if you go higher then 60000 there will be a moon
general 2020-10-25 16:05:57 it would make the game 6000% better
general 2020-10-25 16:06:15 oh yes
general 2020-10-25 16:06:34 make it
general 2020-10-25 16:06:38 idk how to im new
general 2020-10-25 16:07:13 oh ok
general 2020-10-25 16:07:53 &suggest make a moon once we reach higher then 50000-100000 feet, it doesnt have to be round it just has to be like the moon
general 2020-10-25 16:08:04 bruh i need a role
general 2020-10-25 16:08:30 you guys do the suggestion'
general 2020-10-25 16:08:34 i dont have a role
bot-central 2020-10-25 16:09:09 what is this
general 2020-10-25 16:09:38 creatuions?
general 2020-10-25 16:09:46 i guess ill do my space shuttle
general 2020-10-25 16:15:56 **downvote if you want cheese chicken**
general 2020-10-25 16:35:11 what rank shoudld i get to do suggestion
general 2020-10-25 16:35:47 **what rank shoudld i get to do suggestion**

general 2020-10-25 16:36:26 please be fuckin serious mod?
general 2020-10-25 16:46:24 my rocket wabbles but doesnt flip over
general 2020-10-25 16:46:32 does that mean i fail the rocket role
general 2020-10-25 16:56:31 **SUGGEST A MOON AFTER 100000 FT**
general 2020-10-25 16:56:35 REEEEEEEEEE
general 2020-10-26 12:19:49 School: kids needs socialization

also school: puts kids for 6 hours in a classroom and tell them to not **talk** to eachother
general 2020-10-26 12:35:49 That looks like my first boat in plane crazy
general 2020-10-26 12:36:20 funfact
general 2020-10-26 12:36:26 the picture of my pfp is my cat
general 2020-10-26 12:36:43 
general 2020-10-26 12:37:20 i said my cat
general 2020-10-26 12:37:24 Not a cat
general 2020-10-26 12:37:26 Potato
general 2020-10-26 15:18:51 nfife
general 2020-10-26 15:18:54 chicken
general 2020-10-27 17:17:14 according to my research a normal rocket engine can lift 37 blocks and a super rocket engine can lift 63
general 2020-10-27 17:18:02 i said a normal block
general 2020-10-27 17:18:10 the standard block
general 2020-10-27 17:18:25 how do you not know the normal block
general 2020-10-27 17:18:29 the generic one
general 2020-10-27 17:19:11 do aerodynamics even exist anymore
general 2020-10-27 17:19:24 so it doesnt mean anything
general 2020-10-27 17:19:32 AND THAT IS WHY IM TESTIG
general 2020-10-27 17:26:57 so here are my final answers
general 2020-10-27 17:26:59 37 blocks : normal rocket engine
[01:16]
63 blocks : super rocket engine
[01:21]
74 blocks: large rocket engine
[01:26]
112: huge rocket engine
general 2020-10-27 17:27:51 so the myth that the huge rocket engine is weaker then the super rocket engine isnt real
general 2020-10-27 17:28:11 according to my tests
general 2020-10-27 17:29:13 well, it lifter more blocks tho
general 2020-10-27 17:29:40 yes\\
general 2020-10-27 17:29:48 i can agree to that
general 2020-10-27 17:29:57 but it is still most definetly stronger
general 2020-10-27 17:30:16 > huge rockets barely have enough thrust to weight to lift itself
<@!448505589983739914> you mean, and extra 112?
general 2020-10-27 17:30:40 however thhe smaller rockets are more efficient
general 2020-10-27 17:31:29 because 2 small rockets take up 4 blocks but can lift over 120, while the huge rocket engine takes up over 12 blocks but can only lift 112
general 2020-10-27 17:31:41 np
general 2020-10-27 17:31:43 no
general 2020-10-27 17:32:39 the weight ratio of the huge rocket engine is 36 to 112
general 2020-10-27 17:33:10 you waste 36 blocks of energy to get an extra 112 blocks moving
general 2020-10-27 17:33:39 do you guys want me to test the propeller
general 2020-10-28 10:42:59 i made a cetrifuge that makes you go 3500
general 2020-10-28 16:52:59 
general 2020-10-28 16:53:03 fastest centrifuge
general 2020-10-28 16:55:59 it can go 6000
general 2020-10-28 16:56:10 it loterally glitched me into the ground
general 2020-10-28 16:56:36 i can try to make it even  longer hence, faster
general 2020-10-28 17:00:12 with my extemnsions, my centrifuge can now go 12k
general 2020-10-28 17:06:49 OH FUCK I WENT 120923823 SPEED
general 2020-10-28 17:06:53 HAHAH LOL]
