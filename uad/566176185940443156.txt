bug-reports 2019-12-21 12:26:35 Why does my motor move by itself? It’s like it is haunted by a ghost and it will move around even though I’m literally not touching the keyboard and it also will fly around going the direction the motor isn’t suppose to go. For example: if the motor is facing right, the motor should be able to ONLY moving the block up and down or something( I don’t know the word for it but hope you understand), BUT it goes for example left and right! Please fix this, it will help making mech motors that will go every direction easier

bug-reports 2020-07-09 01:24:23 I found this bug where if you type in ":" in a text, and load it, it will become tagged. The tagged word is actually a 2, I know that because the first time I encountered the glitched, it wasn't tagged. I tested this with every sized text, all of them does the same thing except for 1x1 text. It seems to make the text's size 1, but keep the word in but not the ":" in the text.

help 2020-08-11 13:30:01 The lock motors are connected to each other
help 2020-08-11 13:31:16 The red part on the motor above is connected to the motor in the yellow circle
help 2020-08-11 13:31:36 And it can’t work like that
help 2020-08-11 13:31:48 It works just the same as a half block
help 2020-08-11 13:32:19 You have to have the flat part on the motor in yellow circle connect with the red flat part
help 2020-08-11 13:33:24 Although it still won’t work since the motor in yellow won’t be connected to anything so you might have to redesign it
