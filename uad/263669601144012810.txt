The Tale of ajora (263669601144012810)
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 08:20:55 How do I make a suggestion?
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 08:22:17 Okay, I think It is good.
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 08:29:46 I don't know if I did it right..
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 08:30:27 Idk.
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 08:36:34 I think I have advanced engineer.
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 08:36:44 I think I can get it more of.
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 08:37:11 I meant the second one...
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 08:37:17 I think I can get it.
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 08:37:31 The advanced engineer.
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 08:37:49 I just need to check my planes.
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 08:43:25 Who is technically staff
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 08:43:26 ?
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 08:43:49 Okay.
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 08:45:06 Do I just do this here? : /
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 08:51:14 I'm on do not disturb for a reason.
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 08:51:56 Also, <@314383347214319616> I sent you proof for the advanced engineer role.
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 08:53:49 Your both dumb. : /
plane-crazy 2019-03-18 08:53:54 For your own reasons.
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 07:49:39 <@!442494071768875037> You want someone to make the ratte but in Roblox each "stud" is a centimeter and each regular block in plane crazy is 2cmx2cmx2cm so to make a 1:1 replica would be almost impossible unless you got some serious BM up your sleeve. Or you could make it to scale like a Roblox character is a normal sized person.
plane-crazy 2019-03-19 07:50:17 Bad Manners
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 07:46:27 Can someone build this please?

bug-reports 2019-10-15 06:15:07 I am unsure the exact reason but I had the helium blocks seem to cause my creation to get flung at Mach 12 into the upper stratosphere.
bot-central 2019-11-14 11:51:31 &Suggest  Icicle launcher that could stick into blocks and terrain. Another could be some sort of cryo-flamethrower that can slow mechanical blocks that get hit.
creations-chat 2019-11-28 00:19:37 My Halo Pelican, took so long to be happy with it, with working read door, landing gear, rotatable engines and tunable gun on the nose. (an amalgamation of multiple games designs.)
