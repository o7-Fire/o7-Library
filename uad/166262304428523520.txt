The Tale of yurinullification (166262304428523520)
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 14:37:41 made a simple "quad"copter, really hard to steer though. Any of y'all had luck with them?
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 14:38:14 easily unbalanced otherwise
tried with just 4 but immediately veered backwards
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 14:39:47 top propellers are tied to shift/ctrl
rest are opposites of eachother
front is W to increase, S to slow down, back is S to increase/W to decrease etc
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 14:45:56 Anyone know if it's possible to change steering from constantly being on to just, tap
As in, engines are active for as long as you hold in
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 16:24:39 if only there was a gyroscope or something
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 16:24:52 or just in general some way to stabilize myself
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 16:27:41 are they though?
what am i missing here
is putting propellers on every available surface not the correct way
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 16:28:03 do i just need to make it heavier?
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 16:28:57 üëç
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 16:45:29 ah it's fine
i'll just experiment a bit on my own
quite fun tbh

plane-crazy 2020-11-23 22:43:49 question, how do i actually fire guns and such
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 22:44:18 oki
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 23:56:00 is there a more effective way to get 360 degree turrets than just having 2 motors tied to 4 controls
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 23:57:18 tbh what's motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 00:01:35 waitwaitwait can motors be cursor steered
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 00:01:54 tell me 
please
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 00:02:20 is it just automatic
or in settings
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 00:02:23 somewhere
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 00:02:30 ok epic
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:48:55 so whenever using motor 2 for turrets i pretty much have to look at it from the side, for it to face forwards. Is there any way to fix this? being able to properly aim would be nice tbh
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:50:01 wait i just realized what the issue was nvm
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:50:03 sorry
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 08:50:33 had the right idea but didnt realize it was the right idea
or something
idk
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:05:29 is there any way to make this more defensive while keeping 360 degree movement?
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:05:49 talking about the main turret
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:05:54 body i can obv just make it larger
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:06:32 hm
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:19:01 
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:19:42 i like it tbh
had a retractable fence on the front
for whatever reason
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:20:19 
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:25:10 is there any way to make motors spin in the same direction
kinda want to make something like a crawler
dragging itself across the ground with poles
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:25:36 ü§î
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:26:37 
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:27:43 b t w
can i, like, stretch blocks? or does everything have to be placed individually
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:27:54 i see
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:50:38 is there any way to make rounded cylinders?
like, say, a head shape
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:51:05 ah
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:51:06 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:51:53 oh nvm it's not large enough rip
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:52:59 will just make the head a square
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:56:07 corner blocks, in general
will get images
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:56:08 1 min
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 09:59:05 
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:00:53 that's just robocraft lmfao
only game i knew with them
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:02:18 eh
they fixed some of the issues 
stopped the playerbase decreasing atleast
currently sitting at around 500 players per month
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:02:37 or day idk how statistics work
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:04:11 was about to say contact the devs but probably wouldn't be that great an idea
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:27:28 
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:27:50 
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 10:28:28 still not entirely sure how its capable of flying
midsection being almost entirely helium might have something to do with it
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 16:34:37 tried making a vtol, ended up with a hovercraft. pretty much just glides across the ground
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 16:36:06 is there something wrong with vtol craft or what
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 17:16:12 what are these things and why are they screaming while homing into me
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 17:18:06 guessing they're controlled by motor 2s or something?
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 17:19:35 eh
made a semi successful vtol
too tired to work on anything else lmao
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 17:19:45 happens to be both extremely slow and hard to maneuver
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 17:20:30 kinda??
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 17:20:58 have played the game on and off for quite a long time but only recently figured out how to actually do anything
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 18:49:30 is there a mirror build more somewhere?
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 18:52:25 will take that as a no
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 18:54:58 as in
set a line somewhere
and what you build on one side gets duplicated to the other
symmetry
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 19:14:39 
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 19:15:36 no? just thought it looked neat
and wanted to share lmfao
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 20:56:39 just out of curiosity
is there a name for these things
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 20:56:57 apart from just, steered missiles
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 20:57:23 
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 16:43:47 keep seeing all these boats
but, like, how do you get them to the water in the first place
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 16:44:44 ah
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 16:44:49 right
i'm stupid lmfao
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 16:54:59 do ladders weigh anything
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 17:27:36 something in this hellish creation makes me turn slightly sideways while trying to lift up. And it's just, pain. Atleast 20 engines if not more. Have checked all of them and found nothing
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 17:30:02 do rocket engines have more thrust than jets? or what's the difference between them
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 17:31:01 ah yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 17:31:03 ofcourse
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 17:36:08 
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 17:52:27 honestly a feature i'd love to see is directional thruster control
like, with a setting engines set to on/off only mode would activate and deactivate depending on where you're facing
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 17:52:44 probably too hard to implement though
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 23:43:57 how do y'all manage to make those weird angles while building
like honestly curious
since i havent found anything besides cubes and wedges myself
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 23:44:30 ah
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 23:44:32 right
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 23:44:52 really need to figure out how that works at some point tbh
plane-crazy 2020-11-26 00:00:51 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyiPBQZOZF8&feature=emb_logo
have watched this video several times by now
trying to figure out motor lock
and it's just, like
plane-crazy 2020-11-26 00:00:58 what
plane-crazy 2020-11-26 00:01:57 my brain is too small for this
will just give up tbh
