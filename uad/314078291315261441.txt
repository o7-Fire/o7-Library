general 2021-11-07 00:19:00 mountains
general 2021-11-07 00:19:10 graff
general 2021-11-07 00:19:23 it do the go up and the go down
general 2021-11-07 02:07:16 but how will you handle the hands
general 2021-11-07 02:07:34 understandable
general 2021-11-07 02:08:39 drowning people are technically breathing too
general 2021-11-07 02:08:42 they're just not breathing air
general 2021-11-07 02:09:26 disappointing
general 2021-11-07 02:09:28 we could use more plants
general 2021-11-07 02:10:07 I find the smell of tires pleasant
general 2021-11-07 02:10:45 do you eat shit and crap out shit too
general 2021-11-07 02:11:11 maybe?
general 2021-11-07 02:11:26 good
general 2021-11-07 02:12:40 the former is my roblox username, yes
the second is my discord username, yes
the third is my description, yes
I did get verified, yes
i knew all that already yes
general 2021-11-07 02:14:37 I did not know
general 2021-11-07 02:14:46 I also do not know if your keyboard is broken
general 2021-11-07 02:16:53 good
general 2021-11-07 03:06:42 oh wait I don't have image perms
general 2021-11-07 03:11:41 (number of nuclear weapons detonated within civilian population centers, too)
general 2021-11-07 03:11:53 (nobody has had the balls to surpass that record since)
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 03:16:27 trying to build the JAM type-1 from yukikaze RN
this is painful I should not have tried
general 2021-11-07 03:21:04 you would've regretted it much more
general 2021-11-07 03:21:14 source: I speak chinese
general 2021-11-07 03:21:39 literally any asian language is not really worth it unless you learn it from like
birth
I guess if you're into persevering through sheer mental agony it's cool
general 2021-11-07 03:22:55 how unfortunate
general 2021-11-07 03:22:58 you must be in great pain
general 2021-11-07 03:23:43 this build might actually be impossible after all
since I can't find a way to have wedges end up flush with each other
general 2021-11-07 03:23:46 crap
general 2021-11-07 03:25:46 I know precious little about the EU
general 2021-11-07 03:26:06 I do have a romanian friend but he's like never traveled (haha funni post-soviet hellhole)
general 2021-11-07 03:31:21 are you sure it's not working perfectly and only looks wrong
general 2021-11-07 14:49:40 as in le skyhawk?
general 2021-11-07 14:53:16 _ _
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 14:53:46 back to wasting another day on failing to recreate the JAM type-1
general 2021-11-07 15:42:33 oh. unfortunate
general 2021-11-07 19:45:50 deeeeee

plane-crazy 2021-11-07 20:04:24 mostly done with JAM type-1

help 2021-11-07 21:12:08 how does one build a basic conveyor drive
general 2021-11-07 22:06:34 blasdajasda
general 2021-11-07 22:06:40 oh cool I can post images now
help 2021-11-07 22:08:15 I have grappled with this thing for 3 days now
Okay, so - there's like an underslung tail-like structure on this thing, like a keel, except putting control surfaces on it really seemed to do jack shit for keeping this thing stable
Replace with a motor-driven control surface?
help 2021-11-07 22:08:46 (Also, the source design is supposed to be launched on a giant rocket booster, but fuck that I'm not making that thing)
help 2021-11-07 22:10:47 dammit
so the design wasn't possible after all
help 2021-11-07 22:14:13 hmmmmmmm
actually, I don't know if the rudder is the problem anymore
I had to use a really dense ballast block to get the thing to fly because it's so front-loaded and I couldn't fit enough helium
does distribution of mass affect turnrate?
help 2021-11-07 22:14:45 and apparently - testing it now - it *does* fly, just sluggishly
help 2021-11-07 22:15:07 tends to get stuck in turns
help 2021-11-07 22:18:40 lemme see
okay, so it *is* the rudder - getting rid of the ultradense ballast block at the back didn't make it turn any faster
guess I'll dismantle that and work on it
thanks
general 2021-11-07 23:54:42 Gottem
general 2021-11-07 23:55:25 Hooters is a restaurant that nobody goes to because of the food
general 2021-11-07 23:58:43 Ew. The first, please.
general 2021-11-08 00:01:36 Technically the wings aren’t very big because the fuselage is flattened and acts as a lifting body
If you need the extra lift for it to fly then it’s not necessary to change anything but otherwise they technically shouldn’t be that big
general 2021-11-08 00:02:25 Yeh
general 2021-11-08 00:03:07 Strangereal moment
general 2021-11-08 00:04:09 ~~you do it for attention and desperate validation isn’t that right~~
general 2021-11-08 00:04:36 It was a generalized statement not directed at you
general 2021-11-08 00:06:16 F
general 2021-11-08 00:07:27 Rephrase attempt: didn’t mean to be rude and I see where I messed up
It seems cool I was just joking about how my friends worldbuild and like need each other to feel validated because their RL sucks
general 2021-11-08 00:08:23 Yes story making good
general 2021-11-08 00:09:42 No sidewalks, pedestrian unfriendly concrete hellhole or some other situation
general 2021-11-08 00:12:23 What languages aren’t complex
general 2021-11-08 00:14:50 太可惜了
general 2021-11-08 00:15:48 That’s like asking if a grenade or a rocket launcher is better: like, sort of, but for what purpose?
general 2021-11-08 00:16:10 120 is more based tbh
general 2021-11-12 03:57:45 it's easier to define boats as "everything that isn't a ship"
general 2021-11-12 03:57:52 than to define ships as "everything that isn't a boat"
general 2021-11-12 03:58:03 tldr; ships are big important things for big sea stuff
