plane-crazy 2021-05-18 22:54:07 thanks..
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 22:55:18 KK 1 sec lunyro
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 22:58:41 <@!386274857668706314> not finished but yea
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 22:59:03 supposed to be making an RAH-66 Comanche
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 22:59:34 I have forwards set as W and back as S
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:00:14 Kk
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:02:22 It lifts up and down but it keeps spinning like crazy cause the back rotor is sideways
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:02:27 And it's like
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:02:29 Very small
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:04:11 <@!386274857668706314> does the size of the back rotor matter
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:04:18 what
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:05:16 huh
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:05:28 kk
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:05:57 <@!386274857668706314> so I need to make it less torque and unpowered?
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:06:12 Wouldn't I need to use the w and a keys tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:06:18 to move it
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:06:47 so
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:06:56 I'm confused
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:06:58 which one
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:07:13 unpowered yes torque change no?
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:08:34 you there lunyro?
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:10:46 kk
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:17:13 let's say theoretically I wanted a perfect tail rotor
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:17:21 That Is sideways
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:17:34 and kinda tilted
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:17:40 Like the actual heli
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:17:46 what would I have to do
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:19:01 oh
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:19:13 well then
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:20:41 What about adding a swashplate
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:20:50 wouldn't that fix the issue
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 23:20:57 of it spinning out of control
