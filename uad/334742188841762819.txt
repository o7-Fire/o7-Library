The Tale of Ton√¨ (334742188841762819)
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:05:01 Is there a good way to make small gears?
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:05:22 I am having trouble getting enough teeth in a small area for my ornithopter I am building
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:05:33 it is taking up like a 5th of my plot
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:05:37 and doesn't even work
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:06:28 
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:07:07 the gears?
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:07:19 they are on the back
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:07:29 I will do another screen shot with them in a different color
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:08:53 idk
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:09:10 I am using anchor blocks until I get the flapping system working
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:09:29 I got a picture with the gears in red
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:09:38 
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:10:38 no
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:10:40 actual gears
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:11:05 smaller and/or more teeth in the same area
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:11:18 because as is they don't work right
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:11:39 even just more teeth is fine in a larger area
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:11:43 but preferably smaller
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:12:00 not thinner
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:12:04 smaller diameter
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:12:58 I can't use more gears
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:13:02 I have to use 4
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:13:07 and they need more teeth
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:13:15 otherwise they skip and don't function properly
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:13:36 and then it's off sync
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:13:39 and it gets stuck
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:14:00 I can do that
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:14:01 but
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:14:06 4 teeth is not enough
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:14:48 That is what I am going to do
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:15:13 but I just need to get more teeth in there
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:15:20 otherwise this won't work
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:16:14 I know how gears work
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:16:20 I just need more teeth on the gears
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:16:29 because they are skipping and not working right
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:16:35 especially the middle 2 gears
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:16:50 only 2 are powered
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:16:54 the center 2
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:17:01 and they are going opposite eachother
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:17:03 I can unpower one
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:17:19 but then that side just kind of limps and doesn't work right
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:17:31 because there are not enough teeth
creations-chat 2018-11-30 01:17:34 to keep it there
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 01:29:57 how did you get that fast?
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 01:35:11 the respawn button works but after you die it stops working
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 01:36:49 @nuclearman06
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 01:38:44 <@456226577798135808> I built the design that you posted but it just sits there, is there anything else I need or just the suspension and ropes?
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 01:46:30 <@456226577798135808> So I got it to work somewhat but it doesn't do much, it just makes my vehicle flail around
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 01:46:55 ocasionally is spazzes out
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 01:47:25 here you go <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 01:47:49 oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 02:03:35 Pook, I broke the warp machine and it didn't even say the speed any more
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 02:04:05 so to use it do you extend or retract the ropes?
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 02:04:32 k
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 02:13:57 <@456226577798135808> do you just have to wait and hope that it glitches out or is there something you can do to make it do the glitch
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 02:25:51 I got it to glitch
help 2018-12-01 17:34:02 what does the reset function on the motors do?
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 21:21:20 I entered polygon land
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 21:22:41 I activated the parachute in the polygon thing and went flying into oblivion, then my screen just turned white
bug-reports 2018-12-01 23:38:37 I got this speed with the parachute which actually could be used by itself to do this, jumping on it repeatedly sends you flying and if you are lucky you can deactivate and reactivate it for this to happen
bug-reports 2018-12-01 23:39:05 btw, that number is ten quadrillions of sps
bug-reports 2018-12-01 23:45:49 what did you do to the game?
bug-reports 2018-12-01 23:46:09 I have seen it come apart a little on the corner before but not that much
bug-reports 2018-12-02 04:59:14 It's under settings
help 2018-12-02 23:35:06 I can't move my creation up for some reason, it just gives me an error message, I can still build upwards but I need to move the creation upwards, any idea why it would do this? this has happened on other creations as well
help 2018-12-02 23:36:22 there is nothing nearly high enough up to be colliding with the top
help 2018-12-02 23:36:45 I am trying to find a way to check underneath
help 2018-12-02 23:37:59 there appears to be nothing underneath
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 00:58:02 has anyone made an ornithopter in this game before?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 00:58:23 it's a plane that flaps like a bird
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 00:58:31 instead of using jets or turbines
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 00:59:13 I am working on one and it is almost working but I can't quite get it off the ground
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 00:59:53 I think most of the reason is that I can't get the center of gravity behind the center of lift easily
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:00:51 strange, I got the center of lift infront but now it just is nosediving into the ground
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:03:18 no
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:03:22 there are plenty of them
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:03:41 just search youtube for ornithopter and you will find videos
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:03:53 yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:03:59 working perfectly fine
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:05:27 I am basing mine off of the one used by the smallest ornithopter in existence because the standard one requires gears which can't be made easily
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:06:36 actually, I just got it to work
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:06:43 I just spammed control panels on the back
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:13:38 is there a block that acts like suspension but doesn't shrink past a certain size?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:14:37 I need something that can expand but not contract
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:14:49 but a piston wouldn't work because it's powered
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:36:44 k
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:38:02 <@480090143307595786> the spring is overpowering the piston
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:38:43 instead of the spring expanding it pushes the piston in
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:39:16 I will send you a clip in a DM
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:41:52 Theta, I sent you a quick video of my piston issue
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:42:28 oh
creations-chat 2018-12-03 02:57:56 Tommy5015 | Boeing 747 | 598 Blocks | Willing to take any rank, preferably replicator
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:01:11 idk, that was the inspiration for it
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:01:22 some sort of commercial airliner
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:04:42 they have some resemblance, I was limited by build space for everything
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:05:11 Tommy5015 | Ornithopter/Bird/Bat | 197 blocks | Unsure if I could get any roles with this as it seems like most of them require 500+ blocks
creations-chat 2018-12-03 03:05:57 this one flies without the use of any propellers, jets, or rocket engines
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 02:22:37 how often is the autosave?
the-dump 2018-12-05 02:26:07 test
help 2018-12-05 02:28:25 how often is the autosave?
help 2018-12-05 02:29:03 I was building a carrier for the carrier ranks for 2 hours, got almost done, left and came back and roblox had broken so I got into a new server and apparently it never autosaved
help 2018-12-05 02:29:15 is this a bug or does autosave just not save very often?
help 2018-12-05 03:33:09 oh
help 2018-12-05 03:33:14 that makes sense, I never spawned it
