creations-chat 2019-08-01 13:35:20 First post on this server... Let's see how this goes.
creations-chat 2019-08-01 13:35:36 Go-karts in Plane Crazy!
creations-chat 2019-08-01 13:35:53 I wanted to start with a simple track. A lot of testing and 5 folds later, here it is. There's not much to it apart from the track itself, but I did make working start lights and bleachers for spectators.
creations-chat 2019-08-01 13:36:08 The track on my plot:
creations-chat 2019-08-01 13:36:22 And the kart. It's strikingly similar to the one posted above... hm. If you want to race, you have to copy the kart yourself and bring it to the track. It doesn't handle too well, and you have to be light on the gas or you'll flip over or out of the track. But it's small and simple, which is important!
creations-chat 2019-08-01 13:36:53 A full lap on the track. It's stupidly hard to do a flawless lap (either I'm garbage at driving or the karts are). This is the best attempt out of way too many.

creations-chat 2019-08-01 13:38:00 I'm in game right now if you want to join me <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2019-08-01 13:38:15 And thank you!
creations-chat 2019-08-01 13:51:08 Ty ty! I'm thinking of making a longer, more complex one (Maybe even have hills instead of just flat track?) but not sure how I'm gonna work out the folding yet
creations-chat 2019-08-01 14:06:46 I could, but there's a whole other league of problems there, too... Like finding people to do it with me and joining them all together (though I guess I might be able to just, like... put the track on wheels)

plane-crazy 2019-08-26 05:59:08 Allo <@!461743274013753344>, it is fairly bendy, yes

creations-chat 2020-03-04 04:55:05 A vision came to me in the middle of the night, and so I took and hour and made it. A unicycle with no helium or camera tricks, balancing instead with hover thrusters.

Pros:
-Can move at astounding speeds (62)
-Has moving pedals
-Can breakdance
-Can fly if you believe hard enough
-Has one wheel

Cons:
-Can't go off-roading at all (racetrack when???)
-Is afraid of players, other creations, and literally everything in the world
-Has one wheel
