general 2020-10-11 19:56:58 Ok so Roblox died again
general 2020-10-11 19:57:11 Are the data centers still up
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 19:58:35 Are the data centers still down
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 19:59:04 Because Roblox died right as I was finished with a really important part on a massive build
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 20:45:44 So I’m guessing the data basses are fine
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 20:45:50 I don’t have to worry
the-dump 2020-10-14 02:00:40 So... the prophecy is true...
general 2020-10-15 14:01:51 agreed
general 2020-10-15 14:02:25 I think WW2 planes might be better, I like their style
general 2020-10-15 14:02:46 I would say not a bos

plane-crazy 2020-10-15 21:47:15 So someone earlier told me that in order to have a motor be controlled via mouse movements, I had to use Motor 2
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 21:47:18 Correct?
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 21:47:34 What would I set the settings to?
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 21:47:46 Because I tried a couple

plane-crazy 2020-10-15 21:48:41 but how would you control the movement with your cursor if possible?

bot-central 2020-10-27 19:38:08 ?rhelp
creations-chat 2020-11-16 04:03:59 Beginning my DC-3, what do you think so far?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 04:06:54 closer picture, that one's a bit far away
creations-chat 2020-11-16 04:09:10 thank you, first attempt at an airplane with 1:1 scale (I try to make it full scale)
creations-chat 2020-11-29 02:19:27 So I originally Abandonned this B-25 project 5 months ago because it failed and I sucked at building, but I rebuilt it, anything I should add?
creations-chat 2020-11-29 02:21:38 right I was thinking about adding a top turret
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 05:30:41 oh no
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 05:30:44 oh no no no
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 05:30:51 oh no
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 05:30:52 I disconnected
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 05:30:55 and it didnt save
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 05:30:58 oh no
creations-chat 2020-12-17 06:13:09 took a while to get the correct pitch, what do you think? I had to correctly pitch two speakers to different pitches to get it correct. Yes, this is the SS Edmund Fitzgerald, her horn was identical to what I've made here
creations-chat 2020-12-17 06:16:16 Look up Edward L. Ryerson to listen to the horn I tried to identicate, they had the same horns, Leslie 300 and 450
creations-chat 2020-12-18 02:09:27 better paint now?
plane-crazy 2020-12-23 02:23:49 God how long did that take

the-dump 2021-03-15 12:13:59 I just woke up
the-dump 2021-04-09 14:36:43 There’s two elevators on the tail end, as well as a rudder. From what I could see yours doesn’t have those, it might help it fly if you added them
