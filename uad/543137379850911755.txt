plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:00:26 font

plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:03:04 I can't find the creation that gave me the role <a:PensiveWobble:858472237114720257>
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:06:48 is the submarine role not able to be acquired now?
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:08:28 a
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:09:40 OK so I tried making a ship that has a car in it, a submarine and a plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:09:43 but it failed
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:10:34 the submarine is a YT one cuz I was testing it out

the plane didn't work

the car is just a 1x4 with wheels

and the ship is like 6 months old
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:10:46 oh no, they all work together, they just suck
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:11:10 the submarine can attach and detach from the ship
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:11:26 the car just gets put in a special area
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:11:33 and somehow doesn't move
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:11:41 and the plans goes on top
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:12:21 plane*
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:12:33 I'll ramake it completely tomorrow
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:12:56 maybe having a car dangle from rope is a bad idea
