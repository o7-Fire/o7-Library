general 2022-07-21 16:40:48 its the game being a fucking dumbass
general 2022-07-21 16:40:56 and deciding
general 2022-07-21 16:41:00 oh hey look at this dude
general 2022-07-21 16:41:04 he played for 4 hours
general 2022-07-21 16:41:08 lets go delete his progress!
general 2022-07-21 16:41:24 this has been the 4th time
general 2022-07-21 16:41:35 arleigh burke
general 2022-07-21 16:41:39 I have to redo everything
general 2022-07-21 16:42:51 Destroyer
general 2022-07-21 16:42:55 which is gonna take me
general 2022-07-21 16:43:02 6 hours to get all the progress back
general 2022-07-21 16:43:09 since I definitely dont remember
general 2022-07-21 16:43:11 a single thing
general 2022-07-21 16:43:12 I did
general 2022-07-21 16:44:22 no its because theres a certain part on the arleigh burke
general 2022-07-21 16:44:29 which is basically a massive clusterfuck of wedges
general 2022-07-21 16:44:41 that need to be correctly placed or its gonna look like a fucking butt plug
general 2022-07-21 16:45:37 It's pretty easy to make if you actually know how to fucking make it
general 2022-07-21 16:45:54 But it took me 2 hours alone to get it right
general 2022-07-21 16:46:10 Without it looking like its supposed to be in something else
general 2022-07-21 16:49:06 Do you want me to vent my anger on the small children trying to build a aircraft that currently looks like a massive white brick instead?
general 2022-07-21 16:49:17 Lost 4 hours of work
general 2022-07-21 16:49:22 Since the game didn't save it
general 2022-07-21 16:49:27 I saved it in 3 slots
general 2022-07-21 16:49:30 But it didn't register
general 2022-07-21 16:50:11 Now that's just fucking sad
general 2022-07-21 16:50:32 No fucking thank you
general 2022-07-21 16:50:50 Alright villain arc time, 40 fucking shredders
general 2022-07-21 16:51:43 I wish this game had a copy paste feature
general 2022-07-21 16:51:54 Makes making large amounts of builds lots easier
general 2022-07-21 16:52:24 It's probably gonna come in pc2
general 2022-07-21 16:52:31 Which will come in 700 years

plane-crazy 2023-03-20 10:58:45 F22
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 12:10:56 In terms of modern "dogfighting"?
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 12:11:15 Heavy emphasis on those quotes
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 12:11:27 Since dogfighting is literally shooting a sidewinder at a dude from 5 miles away
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 01:59:50 its very situational
general 2023-07-02 10:05:33 AINT NO WAY THEY SELLING 2 PARTS TAPED ONTO EACH OTHER FOR 99 ROBUX
