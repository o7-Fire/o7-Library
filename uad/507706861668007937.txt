help 2020-08-10 04:55:52 <@461644261566185503> sorry if you already found it out, and that this is very late, but the helium needs to be at the top for it to not roll when turning, or if it gets rammed by something. it's not gonna just gonna completely stop rolling, but it will automatically correct itself after a little while
help 2020-08-10 04:57:35 Don't know, and i can't test it because my laptop broke abt a week ago
help 2020-08-10 04:58:15 But yeah putting the helium at the top is the best option other than manual correction via rockets
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 05:27:04 so a levitating object?
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 05:28:31 I'm not really into helis, but maybe make the engines move in order to make it go forward
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 05:28:44 And the secondary rotor for turning

plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:32:59 are we just gonna wait it out for roblox to come back online
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:34:31 last time i tried to join one of the literal 3 servers still up
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:34:37 it literally just kicks you instantly
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:35:48 that's also waiting
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:36:18 i hope this doesn't mean my savedata is deleted
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:37:03 yeah it says that but remember that one time before where people had to have their saves reverted
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:37:53 I wasn't even online when it happened
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:38:34 if my savedata is deleted im just gonna start making ships i am not rebuilding my 1300 block wyvern & morgan
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:38:51 + whatever other garbage i have saved
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:39:15 because i make it semi realistic in size
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:39:22 plus i have lots of motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:40:12 i was gonna build a ship anyway
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:40:38 thats nice
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:41:02 i've literally last made a ship like a year ago
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:41:06 a proper ship
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:41:24 i know its lasted like a few hours atleast
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:41:34 probably gonna last a lot more
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:42:13 considering that they found out what happened 2 hours ago
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:42:22 i dont trust that they'll fix it anytime soon
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:43:14 suing roblox, false advertising
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:43:18 free money
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:43:32 100% proper argument in court
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:46:00 i was gonna build the tanager from ac04 and then the ijn yukikaze if i actually finished the tanager
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:08:48 
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:09:56 its a reply to the other one
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:10:02 not whoever srthebox is
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:10:36 different sizes too
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:10:52 why would you do that to a morgan
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:10:55 poor morgan
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:48:43 when exposed motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:49:27 the size of your plane is completely inaccurate
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:50:01 hes talking about accuracy
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:50:20 it literally does
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:50:31 the nose is angled
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:50:35 the spine is angled
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:51:43 it's not that big of an angle
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:51:57 i was going to fix it when i remade the underside of the engines
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:52:23 does it make it look like a completely different aircraft?
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:52:58 this is exactly why i never like posting my builds here
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:53:07 you people will cry about the smallest of things
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:54:30 your canards are too high of an angle, your engine intakes are too small
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:54:38 
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:54:51 your vert stab isn't even attached
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:55:27 no the engine intake is bigger than the nose
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:55:53 the nose in a 2d sense would be able to fit inside the engine intakes
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:56:59 they really are
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:57:14 they morgan would have extreme drag with zoisite
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:57:20 they would need some gigantic engines
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:57:49 
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:58:22 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:59:11 this one has big intakes
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:59:16 this one
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 00:59:29 this one
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 01:10:46 according to acepedia there is no real physical/appearance difference
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 01:11:04 only performance/weaponry
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 01:11:50 Ace Combat
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 01:11:55 that's how
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 01:12:11 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 01:12:16 arcade flight game
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 01:12:22 not very realistic
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 01:12:36 1 plane can carry near 100 missiles
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 01:12:50 more than 100 in multiplayer
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 01:13:24 the flying stingray
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 01:14:27 mihaly does that too technically
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 01:14:36 but he really just psms
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 01:15:17 welcome to bandai namco

plane-crazy 2021-11-11 01:16:36 
general 2022-06-05 00:41:37 see if it can handle motor 2 underwater
creations-chat 2023-01-09 20:15:24 yes
