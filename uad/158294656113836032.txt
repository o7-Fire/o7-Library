The Tale of madattak (158294656113836032)
plane-crazy 2018-09-17 17:38:27 Might as well be üòõ
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:23:09 So yeah, the code is total junk
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:23:22 Tried to change a few things and now the whole game broke and I have no idea why
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:26:47 see, this is why I hate working on it
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:38:49 Not using filtering is dumb
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:39:10 Having it off as an option was dumb
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:39:31 It just teaches people to learn wrong and makes it harder in the long run
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:57:20 I managed to make the game work again
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:57:29 Added 2 save slots
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:57:32 Disconnector
plane-crazy 2018-09-19 20:57:47 and ballast but the ballast mass wont be reflected by your center of mass
plane-crazy 2018-09-22 20:13:08 Oof
plane-crazy 2018-09-23 12:40:19 I'm having no lag issues
plane-crazy 2018-09-23 12:40:29 The console isnt reading any issues
plane-crazy 2018-09-23 12:40:38 If its laggy Roblox messed something up
plane-crazy 2018-09-23 12:53:07 I had about 10 engines bound  to shift in my helicopter and it didnt cause an issue

bug-reports 2018-10-09 12:53:24 Sounds like the extra slots exceeded the data limit, unsurprisingly

Although rick has been the only one working on it pretty much for the last month, I do feel obliged to point out the games framework took me 8 month of hard work üò¶
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 21:02:31 ugh fastbucks.me? I'd hope we wouldnt have that s**t in roblox
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 21:03:40 but rickje is awesome, I'm not denying that üòÉ
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 21:04:19 <@!327499289595084800>  I mean, I dont get paid for Plane Crazy either
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 21:04:42 So I've been thinking about this stuff, but I wont put it here
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 21:07:45 Was it becuase of a lag machine?
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 21:08:00 Sorry XD 
I have banned someone once for abusing random players

plane-crazy 2018-11-24 21:14:02 Full time jobs suck
plane-crazy 2018-11-24 22:59:59 *wheeze
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:51:24 how broken is at atm
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:51:44 roblox broke a bunch of things
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:51:49 it caused problems
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:52:26 Good enough!
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:53:30 <@!118113664636157953>  I actually checked with the engineers and there was an update today
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:54:08 They said they published a small fix, so it might not have needed a full update thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:54:20 But whatever it was broke the WASD keybindings
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:54:43 And then parts of the game deleted themselves for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 23:54:45 I have no idea
bug-reports 2019-02-24 00:19:09 Most of the issues are roblox screwing things on their end, I think its just coincidence

plane-crazy 2019-09-27 16:19:22 <@!322970944303923200>  Was your autosave off?
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 16:19:51 Dang. Hopefully won't need to turn it off soon
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 16:20:28 Ye <@!327499289595084800> ?
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 16:20:43 I dont know anyone to make one
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 16:22:42 <@!327499289595084800>  Terrain, more efficient
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 16:23:43 A flat baseplate is more efficient than flat terrain, but hilly terrain is more efficient than hilly parts
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 16:23:54 Depends what people one
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 16:23:56 *want
general 2020-06-25 12:04:01 Found him
general 2020-06-25 12:05:15 > make the game soft coded
<@456226577798135808> if only it was as easy as just doing that
general 2020-06-25 12:06:54 > mad can we ping you
If you ping me and I had it muted, was I really pinged?
general 2020-06-25 12:07:37 What is it good for?
general 2020-06-25 12:07:56 Who microwaves bread
general 2020-06-25 12:10:32 But I didn't get a chance to down vote the mess üôÅ
general 2020-06-25 12:13:53 > he will return in another 8 months
Kinda like a solar eclipse but worse
general 2020-06-25 12:14:39 I am not sure how to feel about madattak chan üòÇ
general 2020-06-25 12:16:20 Remember to remote the quote pings kids, or the mod bot will come for you too!

general 2020-06-25 12:21:24 Madattak.Exe has stopped reaponsing
general 2020-06-25 12:21:58 > reaponsing
<@271299269984518155> that's the scientific spelling
general 2020-06-25 12:22:22 Oh no
general 2020-06-25 12:22:43 Yes
general 2020-06-25 12:23:26 > hey mad, is there actually an explanation for not talking on this discord server
<@456226577798135808> the 21 other servers
general 2020-06-25 12:24:23 I can only image how broken pets would end up being
general 2020-06-25 12:26:12 Tbh the reason I don't do plane crazy much is because the code is now only comprehensible to rickje and no one else, so any plane crazy work means making a while new game. But making a whole new game is very difficult and time consuming and normally doesn't work, so I'm not too keen on adding another project to my work pile
general 2020-06-25 12:27:09 > that's understandable, though what are you currently working on?
<@296280922771292170> primarily REV which I've been trying to do for about 3 years now
general 2020-06-25 12:27:34 > madattak my friend sent you his regards
<@456226577798135808> hello friend

general 2020-06-25 12:29:57 > <@158294656113836032> is it possible for the owner of this server to get ingame mod/admin to manage reports ? rick doesn‚Äôt have the time to do it
<@327499289595084800> I saw the post thing, I don't know. Rickje has a better knowledge of what's happening with plane crazy than me at the moment and so I don't really want to  ovveride his decision
general 2020-06-25 12:30:28 Brb banning myself
general 2020-06-25 12:30:47 ? Warn mad noob
general 2020-06-25 12:33:42 > mad are you proud of what rickje has done
 <@456226577798135808> Yes, although as mentioned I can't do anything with the code, that he picked up a badly documented complicated game and did so much work and updates, without expectation of any payment for a lot of it, is quite amazing
general 2020-06-25 12:34:01 > OMG HE PINGED ME IM SO COOL
<@456226577798135808> you shall never be cool!
general 2020-06-25 12:35:52 > mad any opinions ?
<@308156968550268928> I voted against signs because of being too easy to abuse ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
general 2020-06-25 12:36:11 Why did it include the image again
general 2020-06-25 12:37:21 I wouldn't be against adding a log system, but I don't actually know how to program it
general 2020-06-25 12:37:43 Why does rickje not want it?
general 2020-06-25 12:38:02 Maybe I will, maybe I wi
general 2020-06-25 12:38:14 Be back in 8 months
general 2020-07-10 14:12:21 Oh no
general 2020-07-10 14:13:21 I want to go back to my pokeball, it has wifi
general 2020-07-10 14:15:39 I recommend lasers, lasers solve all our problems
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 18:27:15 My apologies for any lost data, but there's nothing we could have done
general 2020-10-20 18:34:52 Ok, looks like we can open up again
general 2020-10-21 08:26:34 > oh no
<@456226577798135808> Any roll-back would just be optional to those who lost data, dont worry!
general 2020-10-21 08:28:48 > do i get warned for pinging mad
<@!671156550546751550> No warning
general 2020-10-21 08:28:52 JUST LASER
general 2020-10-21 08:28:56 LASER OF DEATH
