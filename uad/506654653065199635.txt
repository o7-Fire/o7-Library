general 2021-01-05 06:12:12 <@!644377285746622494>  ikr
general 2021-01-05 06:12:19 tutorials kinda annoy me
general 2021-01-05 06:12:31 i used literally 1 tutorial in my entire 2 years of playing
general 2021-01-05 06:12:34 (almost)
general 2021-01-05 06:12:56 the firebird mech, (which i proceeded to just upgrade to the point where it doesn't work anymore)
general 2021-01-05 06:13:21 wonder if i should flex...
general 2021-01-05 06:15:42 i only needed to figure out how to make a mech
general 2021-01-05 06:15:51 from there i just made my own 8000 block mech
general 2021-01-05 06:15:56 and it works
general 2021-01-05 06:16:01 works alot better than most
general 2021-01-05 06:16:33 thats what i wonder if i should flex
general 2021-01-05 06:16:45 because i already flexed on one of my friends, traintime_me
general 2021-01-05 06:17:07 yeah im not in roc
general 2021-01-05 06:17:25 my own government or whatever is somehow more advanced in mech building than most in ROC
general 2021-01-05 06:17:51 using tanks, planes, etc
general 2021-01-05 06:18:03 i only use 3 types of builds for battle
general 2021-01-05 06:18:09 my Falken X
general 2021-01-05 06:18:20 (fast as heck and very stable)
general 2021-01-05 06:18:54 my jet (some people say its a fishtank turtorial but i never found a video after searching youtube for like 5 hours)
general 2021-01-05 06:19:23 actually that happened to me
general 2021-01-05 06:19:28 i saved a 6000 build
general 2021-01-05 06:19:34 and i came back a few days later
general 2021-01-05 06:19:37 and it wasn't in the save slot
general 2021-01-05 06:19:41 idk if its a bug
general 2021-01-05 06:19:46 but its kinda common for me sometimes
general 2021-01-05 06:20:03 in addition i always rename AND double save my files incase
general 2021-01-05 06:20:09 so idk..
general 2021-01-05 06:20:12 prob a bug
general 2021-01-05 06:20:59 sometimes when i make a build that took me a few days, i always save it like every minute, then when its finish i spam save like 600 times (exaggeration obviously)
general 2021-02-07 01:07:28 if i could report, id report this guy who used a script or hack to copy my build that i spent so long on, and then claimed it as his own.
general 2021-02-07 01:07:58 nop
general 2021-02-07 01:08:13 just watched this guy copy a 6000 block build in an instant
general 2021-02-07 01:08:45 very happy that he is taking my build and hopping to servers claiming its his own ;-;
general 2021-02-07 01:10:54 i like how this kid took my XVI typhoon and then started flying it, then immediately crashed cuz he can't use it right.
general 2021-02-07 01:11:03 using an exploit btw*
