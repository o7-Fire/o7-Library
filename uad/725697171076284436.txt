plane-crazy 2020-11-23 07:11:27 So, I'm building a helicopter but when I try to fly it, the helicopter spins, how do I fix that
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 07:13:47 Ah, thank you
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 07:14:30 I'm not in game atm, I got off for a bit to be productive
plane-crazy 2020-11-23 07:14:57 XD
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 02:48:40 I finally finished the blackhawk : )
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 10:04:51 It's 2 am for me
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 07:16:58 I have built a device to keep ppl off my lot. It is 2 helicopter rotors and an anchored block and it spin and when ppl come on my lot I launch them into orbit (I also put guns on it for pvp)
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 07:19:50 But launching them is way more fun
