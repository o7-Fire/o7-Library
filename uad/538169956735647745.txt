plane-crazy 2019-08-25 22:51:23 you wouldn't expect a flying toaster in a random server you join
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 22:52:20 you also wouldn't expect, is a toaster with a rocket launcher
plane-crazy 2019-08-25 22:53:06 hmm
creations-chat 2019-08-25 22:59:35 this is a toaster, as you can see, it is not a normal toaster, it has an internal rocket launcher which slides out to shoot, it has 811 blocks
creations-chat 2019-08-25 23:00:16 i have many more of these, don't question me for it
creations-chat 2019-08-25 23:00:18 please
creations-chat 2019-08-25 23:01:32 once the rocket launcher is away, it looks as if there were no weapon there
creations-chat 2019-08-26 22:27:19 sneaky
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 22:29:22 you know its not big enough till you can't fit anything else in
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 22:29:27 like this toaster
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 22:29:50 don't ask why its a toaster, its just a toaster
creations-chat 2019-08-26 23:09:06 ever enjoy when a toaster shoots bread up in the air very high? well now you can aim at people, like in this image, this toaster is launching bread at someone, it is a good one to pull on people because it looks like a normal toaster when put away, and when it come out they won't expect it, i'll put an image of that below this one
creations-chat 2019-08-26 23:09:33 heres the one before it aims and fires bread
creations-chat 2019-08-27 19:22:02 hold on lemme get a photo of my turret

plane-crazy 2019-08-27 19:51:10 you know the one thing we are missing? blade blocks
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 19:51:23 that you can stab other blocks with
creations-chat 2019-08-27 20:41:43 this, is a toaster with tank tracks, why? **WELL WHY NOT**
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 20:46:32 !pineapple
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 17:54:37 it just gets better and better
creations-chat 2019-08-28 19:00:30 you know, i was thinking of making a tiny tank, but i gave up on making it small and made this, this 959 block tank treaded beast has 2 main tracks, and a ladder that extends (next picture), thats really it, i'll soon arm it but for now heres the prototype
creations-chat 2019-08-28 19:01:18 and heres the back view with the ladder
creations-chat 2019-08-28 19:01:58 finally something that i submit that isn't a toaster
creations-chat 2019-08-29 19:11:31 its a flying toaster, yes, it can fly, and yes, i have gone crazy
creations-chat 2019-08-30 14:43:04 this.. this is huge. 1557 blocks of.. whatever i should call it, its got a big cannon (which i will soon make it shoot) and a sweet watch tower, why add a watch tower? because it looks sick, and you can't really see whats in front of the tank without it, you know what they say, go big or go home, its also fun to drive in first person
creations-chat 2019-08-30 14:44:58 i dunno
creations-chat 2019-08-30 14:45:08 i was lazy with the turret

creations-chat 2021-02-22 02:05:28 alright
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:17:11 i've been working on a large combat drone for a while and decided it would be funny to put a massive claw on it
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:18:02 there aren't any thrusters other then those hoverpads incase the drone cannot produce lift via the propellers when (trying to) carry anything
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:20:04 it has yaw, pitch, and roll using extra motors
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:21:12 and the claw uses pistons to move because i've found it produces more torque, which gives it more of a grip on things when it matters
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:21:55 what it looks like
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:23:26 only using motorlock to ajust the claw without it breaking into the 15th dimension
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:23:57 it'll take me with it
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:25:45 gonna see if i can find the other mechanical terrors i've attached to this drone
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:33:51 well i didn't find ones that had that body but i did find this one, this is one that has loads of little propellers to keep the size done, 1 group of motors keeps it in the air, and the 2nd group speeds up or slows down the rotation of the big boy propellers under the cage i made for it
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:34:02 it was intended that way
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:34:21 i put cutters all over it to give it contact damage too
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:38:39 and here is my most powerful creation, a turret that can fly
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:39:26 this proved to be an absolute unit in a fight due to its speed and maneuverability (this is an old one i have not updated it can't strafe)
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:40:10 i also can fly it upside down for some wacky movements
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:42:08 it has a top speed of 210 going in a completely straight line and the mounted gun is a work of art, if you're the devil
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:42:29 rockets, and as many guns as i can put on it
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:42:37 along with water jets because they look cool
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:44:05 and when i'm knocked out of the air, guess what i am now
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:44:43 oh wait that was you LOL
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:45:46 yeah i might work on a new drone that has a massive chainsaw on it
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:47:05 i do have a chainsaw...
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:47:19 fun story about this one
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:47:42 this bad boy can cut through 6 block thick armor in under 5 seconds
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:48:04 due to how fast the blade spins
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:48:37 i also made one fly
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:48:43 but thats something i'm not willing to show
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:49:20 oh lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:50:40 the locking mechanism may have broke
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:51:22 on my screen you teleported
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:53:05 no we're just in the same server
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:53:47 i cannot see you
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:54:10 the invisible jet
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:54:26 i can hear you though
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:55:38 this is one of my favorites
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:56:26 i remember what i thought before 'shredders have weird drill things up front and those cut real good, so what if i stick a bunch of those on one line?'
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:57:41 'and what if i make said like vibrate like a high frequency blade'
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:58:52 it just goes back and forth very very fast
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:59:07 wicked fast, a bit too fast maybe
plane-crazy 2022-10-15 23:59:50 hmmmmm
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 00:00:03 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 00:00:06 i said

plane-crazy 2022-10-16 00:02:01 yes
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 00:13:32 jets used to be birds
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 00:13:47 birds fly and jets fly
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 00:14:04 my source is that i made it up
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 00:16:29 birds are government drones
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 00:36:14 send help
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 00:52:18 does anyone else use drones in combat?
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 00:53:38 yes

plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:21:15 fr
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:21:33 i could post the saw and 50 people will immediately downvote
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:21:52 even though it took forever to work properly
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:23:20 800+ blocks and cuts through anything like butter, a work of art even
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:26:16 i think this could get some up votes but thats really it
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:27:52 probably the most fun to work on tbh
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:28:11 no thrusters to rotate the drone
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:28:29 its all with the 4 propellers
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:28:37 you know like an actual drone
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:29:21 hover blocks are for extra lift when stealing houses
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:29:55 if i took off the claw and hover blocks (along with the helium blocks) i bet it would get a better score
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:30:02 ..maybe not
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:30:04 i don't know
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:36:21 still large
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 03:36:31 and much more stable

general 2022-10-16 20:25:23 i'd tell you but
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 20:27:36 at least i got this, a kind of complicated mess of motors and has no engine blocks
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 20:30:01 the drone itself is perfect for being weaponized, i added one turret on an earlier model and was a match, i just suck at aiming so it didn't work out for me
general 2022-10-16 21:14:30 bear moment

general 2022-10-16 23:45:21 all i know is caffeine got me good i made like 4+ models i've gone mad
general 2022-10-16 23:45:37 gonna post some funnies in plane crazy and you guys can look and see
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 23:46:40 ok
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 23:46:58 gonna take a bit longer since roblox won't let me copy paste snips i take
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 23:48:08 heres my most recent drone body, its stability is unmatched compared to the others and does not use any small engines for flight, this is all motors doing the work
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 23:48:32 i added some cage like bits to keep stuff from hitting the props
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 23:48:48 yes
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 23:48:55 it is a weapon with movement
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 23:49:34 its a more function over form thing, but i made a weaponized one that looks better
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 23:50:46 heres the weaponized one built for pvp
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 23:51:02 added a weird dome to see out of
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 23:52:43 the pov
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 23:53:26 
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 23:54:09 the seat is angled so i can get a better view of the ground
plane-crazy 2022-10-16 23:58:36 and here are the combat benefits of using the angled seat, i can see more
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 00:00:29 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 00:03:44 rip
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 00:06:14 heres a smaller form factor one, this one does use engines to spin
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 00:06:26 i added lots of cage structure
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 00:07:30 so nothing can get into the props
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 00:07:32 and well
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 00:07:34 jam it
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 00:08:24 it also works as armor
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 00:08:50 i am not making excuses to cover the fact that it looks sick as hell
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 00:10:27 also upside down flight lets go

plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:51:10 i made an demon once, made a shredder bug but *large*
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:51:53 i’ve made a flying chainsaw
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:52:57 its very easy, construct a railgun
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:53:16 who is this owner
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:53:48 i will find them
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:53:52 i will capture them
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:53:56 and no one will ever die again
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:54:49 take a guess
||its like 2k+ probably||
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:55:18 1k can outrun the weird swarms and the classic shredders
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:55:55 outrun them
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:56:47 add a second monitor
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:57:27 and they probably use the 50k to charge at people, there ain’t no way you can control that thing otherwise
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 14:00:23 indeed
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 14:01:14 i’ve fought a piss yellow shredder ball and was able to shut them down with a cracked up attack drone
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 14:01:45 i was fighting this guy at 200 ish speed
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 14:05:10 however i was pulling some wild turns so take that as you wish
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 14:08:03 also fireworks might do something since they’ll be charging at you
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 14:08:49 or missiles but the spinning tends to fuck up tracking if you use lock ons
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 14:11:47 most drones i have can send a group of missiles away without any movement, just idle
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 14:12:19 due to the spinning props
general 2022-10-17 14:12:42 not worth it

plane-crazy 2022-10-17 20:57:09 it doesn't use any wacky stabilization stuff on it, it just does that itself, center of mass is below the wings so it doesn't fly all around
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 20:58:06 this kinda distance
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 20:58:46 its how far down you want the center of mass to be
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 21:00:52 interesting things i must say
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 21:01:40 thats the fun part i have no idea lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 21:03:03 its 2 lines of trails with some motors i think
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 21:03:25 ..that can fly
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 21:03:50 
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 21:05:10 
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 21:06:08 ejector seats are cool
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 21:06:39 interesting indeed
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 21:07:00 oh damnit someone played bumper cars with my drone
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 21:07:27 huh, not a ball
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 21:07:47 ig
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 21:08:34 by the looks of it he doesn't

plane-crazy 2022-10-18 13:33:52 someone make this bike
plane-crazy 2022-10-18 14:23:42 applause
general 2022-10-19 14:35:15 ‘Have one to sell? Shit yourself’
general 2022-10-19 14:35:57 i fear whatever that circle thing is
creations-chat 2022-10-19 14:36:22 a second channel
we have one for everyone and then one for expert ranks
general 2022-10-19 14:37:03 oh those are cutters
creations-chat 2022-10-19 14:40:33 i think this is a great idea and would love to see it happen
general 2022-10-19 19:54:14 i know the word
general 2022-10-19 19:54:16 its among
plane-crazy 2022-10-19 20:04:32 i have made a bad decision
general 2022-10-19 21:01:26 why do some vehicles become invisible whenever i shoot a large chunk of something off them
general 2022-10-19 21:01:48 and sometimes enemies just regen health
general 2022-10-19 21:01:53 for some fucking reason
general 2022-10-19 21:02:28 like this guy was on the ground when both of us had been basically reduced to potato status
general 2022-10-19 21:02:52 i had 1 gun working (4 turrets, how do i do it) at the tie so i shoot at him
general 2022-10-19 21:03:04 thats bullshit
general 2022-10-19 21:05:23 why'd you get it
general 2022-10-19 21:06:49 LOL
general 2022-10-19 21:07:02 was it worth it
general 2022-10-19 21:37:05 i'm sorry you made what in minecraft?
the-dump 2022-10-20 14:50:06 what in the god damn
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:09:17 nowhere is safe
the-dump 2022-10-20 15:10:25 among us was among us since the beginning
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 20:11:17 i love driving under the map
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 20:13:33 it was too late
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 20:13:55 no i died due to unnatural causes
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 19:23:09 enemy drone has appeared
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 19:26:17 dude upgraded his to try and defeat me too, we're still going at it
plane-crazy 2022-10-21 19:59:34 the spreading begins
general 2022-10-21 20:00:27 can you speak ant
general 2022-10-24 17:19:41 watermelon
general 2022-10-24 17:21:03 good one
general 2022-10-24 17:22:02 i mean bullets have explosives in them
general 2022-10-24 17:25:27 best game of 2022
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 19:26:18 i refuse
general 2022-10-25 19:28:10 you know who else has dementia?
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 19:29:04 send 50 shredder balls after this man immediately
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 19:29:36 also works
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 19:29:39 wait
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 19:29:53 i haven't shown you guys the **horror** yet
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 19:29:58 hang on i gotta get it
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 19:32:24 ok so, this is a giant chainsaw (not the horror), what is something this heavy overbuilt funny machine cannot do?
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 19:33:15 thats right, it can't fly
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 19:36:19 thats right, i took shredder bug designs, made the spinning blades wider, and mashed it all together to make this horror
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 19:38:03 it's blade is weaker due to not spinning as fast (50 speed motor in the back with a 5x5 cylinder) compared to the grounded saw (**100** (yes, i added 2) speed motors for the front and back)
general 2022-10-25 20:36:29 it was all sus in the beginning
general 2022-10-25 20:39:04 is among us the meaning of life
general 2022-10-25 20:43:56 caffeine is in my bloodstream
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 20:50:30 its not as effective as you think it is
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 20:51:21 shredders will not go away
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 20:51:27 they will find a way
general 2022-10-25 21:06:18 i cannot
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 21:08:00 something doesn't seem right..
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 21:08:52 well lets think of it like this
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 21:08:56 do you want to get the rank?
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 21:09:19 oh
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 21:09:30 i mean yeah they do
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 21:09:57 just make sure its ready for... *creations*
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 21:13:15 yes this is dyno
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 21:29:28 nah bro you gotta go further
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 21:29:40 they will tear you appart with something like that

general 2022-10-25 21:56:21 uh oh it happened again
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 22:05:57 i've made a quad copter, but now its time to take off one of the rotors, i'm making a tricopter
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 22:25:51 yo
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 22:26:22 i do
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 22:26:39 we just gotta wait
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 22:27:05 which will release first? the heavy update or plane crazy 2???
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 22:28:36 lets ask the other 37422 people here
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 22:35:35 heeheeheehaw i fly
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 22:36:00 i absolutely did not use anything to get up here
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 22:46:21 your eyes trick you
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 22:46:58 also still up here
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 22:50:14 in about 20 minutes of idle flight (just waiting) i've moved 400 studs
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 22:50:23 around that
general 2022-10-25 22:50:59 he what
general 2022-10-25 22:51:36 nitro is a scam
general 2022-10-25 22:52:35 que the clown music
general 2022-10-25 22:54:29 if you guys are gonna yell at each other take it to dms
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 22:55:04 perfect honestly
general 2022-10-25 22:57:16 oh no
general 2022-10-25 22:59:21 i have no fucking idea whats happening anymore
general 2022-10-25 22:59:51 confidence at it's finest
general 2022-10-25 23:01:19 the jet
general 2022-10-25 23:02:12 whats messed up is that will get a 20 to 234 like to dislike ratio
general 2022-10-25 23:02:27 because creations chat
general 2022-10-25 23:02:44 do not go to creations chat
general 2022-10-25 23:02:49 it is not real
general 2022-10-25 23:02:55 it cannot hurt you
general 2022-10-25 23:03:27 orange
general 2022-10-25 23:03:54 i must lose my whitename status and ascend
general 2022-10-25 23:04:19 but no way in hell do i want to go in creations
general 2022-10-25 23:04:29 i fear no man
general 2022-10-25 23:04:34 but that thing
general 2022-10-25 23:04:38 *it scares me*
general 2022-10-25 23:05:56 among us
general 2022-10-25 23:06:34 plane crazy if motor lock never existed
general 2022-10-25 23:07:38 spooky
general 2022-10-25 23:09:29 this was during ww2 right?
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 23:11:46 i'm still up there
general 2022-10-25 23:14:09 i saw an embed fail
general 2022-10-25 23:14:30 💀
general 2022-10-25 23:15:24 the motor 2 struck back
general 2022-10-25 23:16:55 this man, nerd react him
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 23:28:01 more layers
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 23:28:52 also, i'm delivering a gift to the underground lab right now
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 23:29:03 i think this one will blow their socks off
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 23:42:40 4 direct impacts from missiles and i can still fly
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 00:24:42 they'll never find me here
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 00:26:45 guys i think they know
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 00:27:31 oh no one absolutely saw me i need to move
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 00:27:55 its great because i move at 2 speed
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 00:29:05 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 00:30:09 theres this one guy here trying to recreate the titanic
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 00:30:16 and he keeps getting shot
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 00:30:47 he didn't even get to it
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 00:31:28 someone put a turret under their jet and made it work 💀
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 00:31:37 which is why i sit underwater
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 00:32:01 you'd be surprised how much its been working
general 2022-10-26 00:34:58 imagine plane crazy but with no motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 00:36:36 heeheeheehaw (i left)
creations-chat 2022-10-26 01:59:50 the pc map is not round so you’re right
general 2022-10-26 10:25:36 there is an imposter among us
general 2022-10-26 10:44:02 the
general 2022-10-26 11:04:32 that ones british
general 2022-10-26 11:04:50 hope you got your stabbin’ license
general 2022-10-26 11:06:00 wyoming is not real
general 2022-10-26 11:06:26 there are only 2 escalators in wyoming from what i heard
general 2022-10-26 11:07:58 reverted to stairs
general 2022-10-26 11:08:39 lets hope they don’t puff up and explode like the real thing
general 2022-10-26 11:09:03 thats
general 2022-10-26 11:09:11 thats not what i was aiming at
general 2022-10-26 11:09:52 i was going to say ‘because i don’t want to breathe in fumes from blown up lithium ion batteries’
general 2022-10-26 11:10:56 the industrial revolution and its consequences
general 2022-10-26 11:11:18 mental instabilities take many forms
general 2022-10-26 11:18:14 💀
general 2022-10-26 11:19:48 mental instabilities/held at gunpoint
general 2022-10-26 11:22:02 they might soon if they fuck up again
general 2022-10-26 12:32:08 other then the winter map change, no
general 2022-10-26 12:32:37 some ice which is cool
general 2022-10-26 12:32:41 ig
general 2022-10-26 12:33:52 good, thats one less loose end
general 2022-10-26 12:34:33 ocean pylon but its on the other ocean
general 2022-10-26 12:34:54 are you a mage
general 2022-10-26 12:35:15 do you intend on becoming mage
general 2022-10-26 12:35:37 do you have the mana
general 2022-10-26 12:36:01 then ascend and become the bee god
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 12:38:39 mfw someone spawns a jet with custom sound effects in pvp (they will destroy us all) (i died)
general 2022-10-26 12:39:03 the hive pack
general 2022-10-26 12:39:12 it makes your bees **better**
general 2022-10-26 12:40:04 stronger bees
general 2022-10-26 12:40:07 more bees
general 2022-10-26 12:40:27 construct a giant beehive in your base NOW
general 2022-10-26 12:41:23 all of them
general 2022-10-26 12:42:01 also put the largest beehive in the jungle
general 2022-10-26 12:43:39 the numbers
general 2022-10-26 12:43:44 what are they saying?
general 2022-10-26 12:44:05 time to turn general chat into a courtroom
general 2022-10-26 12:44:38 kill
general 2022-10-26 12:44:54 you are not ready for ascension
general 2022-10-26 12:45:47 they gave me a 450 character limit
general 2022-10-26 12:46:15 for context
general 2022-10-26 12:47:15 i thought it would be funny to calculate how powerful of an explosion a banana made from antimatter would create
general 2022-10-26 12:47:43 and then compared it to a thermonuclear bomb
general 2022-10-26 12:49:33 pretty sure its me calculating how many megatons while also snorting at least 6 lines
general 2022-10-26 12:49:57 a funky number indeed
general 2022-10-26 12:50:15 i need to check my math
general 2022-10-26 12:50:28 but i do know it was a pain in the ass to figure out
general 2022-10-26 12:50:47 i have no memory of what that number was
general 2022-10-26 12:51:06 but i do know it was very important
general 2022-10-26 12:52:18 i know you need to multiply the mass of the antimatter by the speed of light (squared)
general 2022-10-26 12:52:34 ok i remember now its the energy of the explosion
general 2022-10-26 12:52:56 and then i had to divide it by a big number
general 2022-10-26 12:58:49 thats what i use to take energy and turn it into megatons, or at least what google told me
general 2022-10-26 12:59:50 yes
general 2022-10-26 13:00:22 because annihilation is very goofy
general 2022-10-26 13:01:07 i asked google how i turn energy into megatons
general 2022-10-26 13:01:17 there ain’t no way i could do that myself
general 2022-10-26 13:03:48 i was feeling rather smart and also silly so I decided to figure out the tnt equivalent of an antimatter banana, because that was a great use of my time
general 2022-10-26 13:04:06 i also wanted to see if it would surpass a thermonuclear bomb (**it did**)
general 2022-10-26 13:04:20 i also did one for a pineapple but i forgor
general 2022-10-26 13:05:48 how the hell did this guy join on the 28th its the 26th today
general 2022-10-26 13:06:07 oh
general 2022-10-26 13:06:11 i misread my bad
general 2022-10-26 13:07:09 anyways the math i did for this funny explosion is simple
take the mass of the object and multiply it by the speed of light
general 2022-10-26 13:09:42 then you take this big number (the energy of said explosion) you get and divide it by 4.14e+9, and just like that you’ve calculated how many megatons of tnt you’d need to match it
general 2022-10-26 13:10:54 so for shits and giggles i’m gonna calculate how big of a boom a pineapple (antimatter) will make on contact with regular matter
general 2022-10-26 13:11:29 i’m talking explosion
general 2022-10-26 13:11:36 not speed
general 2022-10-26 13:12:34 when antimatter comes in contact with regular matter it undergoes annihilation
general 2022-10-26 13:13:37 banana
general 2022-10-26 13:15:25 what i’m seeing is the impact of a banana going at fuckin uh, i dunno, a speed that is impossible to achieve, but that also works too
general 2022-10-26 13:15:43 banana gun
general 2022-10-26 13:16:08 ok
general 2022-10-26 13:17:58 backstory and lore for this, i was watching a funny youtuber play ksp (i bet you’ve heard of him but the channel name is martincitopants) and he was talking about an antimatter bomb
general 2022-10-26 13:21:13 it doesn’t matter you won’t have anything
general 2022-10-26 13:22:06 the super banana
general 2022-10-26 13:22:50 depleted uranium sounds like something you shouldn’t eat
general 2022-10-26 13:23:13 only bananas in this equation
general 2022-10-26 13:23:30 heavy metal moment
general 2022-10-26 13:25:05 they should
general 2022-10-26 13:26:12 the long barrel
general 2022-10-26 13:26:52 -1 what
general 2022-10-26 13:27:57 right i’ll just go with the 2430m/s
general 2022-10-26 13:31:39 so this weird metal banana is going at 5435.755 miles per hour, thats 7 times the speed of sound
general 2022-10-26 13:32:48 in this scenario we have a banana covered in titanium and depleted uranium, i’m gonna not add air resistance as that would get horrifying
general 2022-10-26 13:34:23 just vacuum
general 2022-10-26 13:35:09 so without any air resistance this mach 7 horror will obliterate that T-63, banana shaped or just straight
general 2022-10-26 13:36:11 well then whats the point of calculating how hard a banana would hit it
general 2022-10-26 13:36:20 we’re doing normal banana
general 2022-10-26 13:36:21 not
general 2022-10-26 13:36:22 uh
general 2022-10-26 13:37:27 uuuuh
general 2022-10-26 13:37:43 lets go for ‘pointy end’
the-dump 2022-10-26 13:38:40 dear god
general 2022-10-26 13:40:01 mach 7, no air resistance
general 2022-10-26 13:40:12 it may be shit but its moving
general 2022-10-26 13:40:29 this all started with bananas and its ending with bananas
general 2022-10-26 13:41:04 and bananas
general 2022-10-26 13:41:50 idea: make a banana out of tungsten, lift it into orbit and drop it
general 2022-10-26 13:42:46 at least its a result we can get
general 2022-10-26 13:43:13 rather then: heeheeheehaw mach 7 depleted uranium titanium banana
general 2022-10-26 13:43:49 thats a great idea, just use a gun
general 2022-10-26 13:45:36 there was this thing i heard of, its called kinetic bombing, basically you drop really heavy objects from high up, using potential energy from being high up which will turn into kinetic energy
general 2022-10-26 13:45:42 LOL
general 2022-10-26 13:46:06 its just dropping a heavy object from high up
general 2022-10-26 13:46:30 💀
general 2022-10-26 13:46:43 cat break
general 2022-10-26 13:47:48 there ain’t nothing we can use to get that banana to mach 7, even in vacuum
general 2022-10-26 13:48:03 uuuuh
general 2022-10-26 13:48:18 10 minutes sounds good
general 2022-10-26 13:48:37 actually give it like an hour
general 2022-10-26 13:49:20 here i got an idea
general 2022-10-26 13:49:44 yes
general 2022-10-26 13:50:25 traffic pole sized rods of tungsten dropped from orbit, isn’t that terrifying
general 2022-10-26 13:50:50 anyways back to the bananas
general 2022-10-26 13:51:18 ok
general 2022-10-26 13:51:27 i’m gonna do some math
general 2022-10-26 13:52:55 if gravity pulls down on objects at -9.8m/s (and no air resistance) we would need a looooooong time to get to mach 7
general 2022-10-26 13:54:20 this is not apart of it please don’t make it more complicated
general 2022-10-26 13:58:53 ok so if this giant tungsten pole were to start accelerating from rest at 9.8m/s/s it would take roughly 247.924 seconds to achieve mach 7 assuming theres no air resistance and its in space
general 2022-10-26 14:00:06 space as in it won’t bump into shit like earth or anything else
general 2022-10-26 14:00:37 just the pole and an unknown reason for acceleration other then math
general 2022-10-26 14:01:42 congrats, you got it
general 2022-10-26 14:01:54 i forgot to add constant 💀
general 2022-10-26 14:03:07 but what about in earth’s orbit? assuming the military did actually drop a tungsten pole from that far up it would be very complicated
general 2022-10-26 14:03:15 to calculate
general 2022-10-26 14:03:45 we’re not talking how it gets there
general 2022-10-26 14:03:58 this is freefall
general 2022-10-26 14:04:12 let it go and watch it fall gracefully
general 2022-10-26 14:06:50 it gets weaker the further you are away from it
general 2022-10-26 14:07:10 which is also something we need to account for and something i am too tired to do
general 2022-10-26 14:07:56 all i know is this mf is gonna make a big impact
general 2022-10-26 14:08:21 and that i don’t want to be near said impact
general 2022-10-26 14:10:50 i love how we went from a banana to a giant tungsten pole getting dropped from orbit
general 2022-10-26 14:11:12 giant tungsten banana from orbit
general 2022-10-26 14:11:24 uuuuh
general 2022-10-26 14:11:49 what about the karman line
general 2022-10-26 14:21:17 sorry for the slow response i think it is
general 2022-10-26 14:21:37 the shape
general 2022-10-26 14:22:23 memory bad
general 2022-10-26 14:22:36 💀
general 2022-10-26 14:43:21 its been 2 hours god damn
general 2022-10-26 14:44:25 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-10-26 14:46:34 ok so, 12 gauge buckshot, but we replace the lead balls in it with tiny tungsten bananas
general 2022-10-26 14:48:40 intrusive thoughts made me write my discord bio
general 2022-10-26 14:49:11 the thing that caused physics in the chat for 2 hours
general 2022-10-26 14:49:23 this was during summer
general 2022-10-26 14:49:50 i thought it would be funny to calculate bananas
general 2022-10-26 14:49:52 so i did
general 2022-10-26 14:50:03 and that was the result
general 2022-10-26 14:51:34 it spreads
general 2022-10-26 14:54:26 i had to type it out
general 2022-10-26 14:54:45 you can it would just be bad
general 2022-10-26 14:58:21 i wanna make a 2x3
general 2022-10-26 14:59:05 no for a jet

general 2022-10-26 15:20:53 break each alter you can find (leave one for crafting) and then skip the first 2 metals (make only pickaxes and the anvil) to get the funny red metal i forgot the name of and titanium
general 2022-10-26 15:21:31 this
general 2022-10-26 15:21:55 only make armor out of titanium or the other one

plane-crazy 2022-10-26 18:18:49 might try robotics expert but i do not want to step into creations
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 18:19:00 only thing stopping me
general 2022-10-26 18:35:58 good times
general 2022-10-26 18:38:54 i'm gonna make an actual hand of god
general 2022-10-26 18:39:56 its true
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 19:56:03 i know the top looks like absolute shit but i don't care, this is the only way i can lift the massive projectile off the ground
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 19:56:30 that thing is filled to the brim with ballasts that are maxed out
general 2022-10-26 19:56:46 that sounds like fun honestly
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 19:57:15 yes
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 19:57:21 this is something you drop on someone
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 19:59:45 no they will not survive either
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 20:02:42 god its so fucking unstable
general 2022-10-26 20:15:42 he smells the blood in the water its too late
general 2022-10-26 20:16:04 actually yeah why do you even have blacklist

general 2022-10-26 20:16:38 was it worth it?
general 2022-10-26 20:17:24 you wanna see my progress on trying to recreate the rods from god
general 2022-10-26 20:17:59 gonna post in <#384021699466756107> because i don't have image perms
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 20:20:18 this overweight shitter machine can now fly properly (yes, those are the biggest propeller engines turning this trash heap)
general 2022-10-26 20:21:07 💀
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 20:22:54 i also need to be careful as the big main propellers can actually struggle under the weight of the thing on the bottom if i let it drop (i maxed out the torque, they still slip 💀)
general 2022-10-26 20:31:32 every time i try to make a plane i always end up with a high speed missile, like 'oh man i did it again'
general 2022-10-26 20:34:42 i tried to use hover engines on my new creation 'the rod', which is a drone holding a giant rod full of ballasts to just crush someone
general 2022-10-26 20:34:54 safe to say i added like 50 and it did not lift
general 2022-10-26 20:35:14 i did
general 2022-10-26 20:35:27 the drive
general 2022-10-26 20:35:48 this isn't like 1 ballast beam
general 2022-10-26 20:35:54 this is.. i think 30
general 2022-10-26 20:36:01 all of them are maxed
general 2022-10-26 20:36:06 uh oh
general 2022-10-26 20:36:56 ..is tha amongus
general 2022-10-26 20:37:51 are you saying you're overweight

general 2022-10-27 15:12:26 how
general 2022-10-27 15:12:42 💀
general 2022-10-27 15:13:32 multiply but in reverse
general 2022-10-27 15:13:50 i’ll explain this one
general 2022-10-27 15:13:51 so
general 2022-10-27 15:16:02 2x + 2x = 4x
you can combine these numbers because both numbers share an x
2x + 2y ≠ 4x
you cannot combine numbers because they do not share the same variable (the x and y)
general 2022-10-27 15:16:18 i am a horrible teacher and this could all be wrong
general 2022-10-27 15:16:28 x is just there
general 2022-10-27 15:16:34 in this scenario
general 2022-10-27 15:16:55 ok in that problem you gotta find x

general 2022-10-30 02:41:46 ayo reeses puffs
general 2022-10-30 02:43:47 i had to take a second
general 2022-10-30 02:43:53 and i don't know how to feel about that
the-dump 2022-10-30 02:47:09 some people laugh at bread falling over
general 2022-10-30 02:47:45 see theres the flaw they might not appear on radar but they always appear on the media
general 2022-10-30 02:48:42 sr71 is fast
general 2022-10-30 02:48:45 so fast
general 2022-10-30 02:48:49 and so fuckin high
general 2022-10-30 02:49:09 absolute chad move
general 2022-10-30 02:49:24 who needs funky radar blocking shit when you can go past mach 3
general 2022-10-30 02:50:19 i can only wonder how that would go
general 2022-10-30 02:56:14 what
general 2022-10-30 02:57:00 that sounds like a liability
general 2022-10-30 02:57:10 it shouldn't
general 2022-10-30 02:57:32 you're telling me
general 2022-10-30 02:57:39 you're launching nukes at other planes
general 2022-10-30 02:58:16 but instead of bothering to add guidance systems so the thing wouldn't miss (or at least make an attempt to hit) the target
general 2022-10-30 02:58:32 you **didn't add one**
general 2022-10-30 02:58:48 so these things would fall and end up in bumfuck nowhere below the fight and probably go off
general 2022-10-30 02:59:20 the concept is great
general 2022-10-30 02:59:28 i love it
general 2022-10-30 02:59:35 i would love to launch nukes at other planes but
general 2022-10-30 03:00:25 i don't want other casualties until i **hit** my target first
general 2022-10-30 03:03:59 well at that rate take a 747 and add more powerful engines (speed) to it, and then you take your missile, size that bitch up and remove every jet from the sky
general 2022-10-30 03:04:21 also the nuclear blast might fuck with shit below so thats good too
general 2022-10-30 03:05:21 i hope hes got insurance

plane-crazy 2022-10-30 04:22:14 5 blocks tall, 6 for the combat drones with extra caging and extra shit to secure it
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 04:22:42 i have no idea how to make it smaller other then CRRRAAAZZYY motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 04:23:08 motorlock so complicated i’m certain my head would spin just looking at it
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 04:25:13 i know its technically possible and i’ve used motorlock only 1 time for a stupid 1 off joke (it was an among us joke)

plane-crazy 2022-10-30 19:16:24 yeah it can
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 19:21:22 ok heres an example, so on a normal quadcopter, you have 4 props, 2 spin clockwise and the other 2 spin counter clockwise to cancel out the rotational bs
plane-crazy 2022-10-30 19:23:03 basically just

general 2022-11-01 14:22:49 Hi
general 2022-11-01 14:27:02 that would be very funny
general 2022-11-01 14:27:28 best ones creations blacklist

general 2022-11-01 19:01:04 planned for summer
general 2022-11-01 19:01:09 died during summer
general 2022-11-01 19:01:45 my question is how did you find out it was cancelled
general 2022-11-01 19:06:44 this is general
general 2022-11-01 19:07:42 super strength, weld
general 2022-11-01 19:08:38 stick the magnet on and give it a second
general 2022-11-01 19:09:52 maybe a weld **button** would be a good idea
general 2022-11-01 19:11:07 view a camera through a display?
general 2022-11-01 19:11:16 those would be cool
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 19:34:42 gonna try and make a missile defense system
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 20:04:09 they will kill you
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 20:04:40 just get ready for the <:Downvote:490311668556103700>
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 20:33:21 gave up on normal missile defense
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 20:33:38 but the good news is i think i just figured out how to make a 'force field'
general 2022-11-01 20:37:54 cat real
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 20:41:46 this force field might actually work
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 20:41:58 (its a spinning block)
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 20:45:05 looks like this just way more complicated, but the motors on the ends of this rod start to float away, I gotta balance the speed very carefully otherwise it won't stop
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 20:51:12 it did take a missile
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 20:51:21 so it might be worth investigating
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 20:56:10 i've found that spining objects confuse the fuck out of missiles
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 20:56:19 yeah they do
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 20:56:29 you haven't witnessed it
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 20:57:16 mine took a missile, so i might come back to it if i can get it more under control
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 20:57:26 (i won't that shits annoying)
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 20:58:21 they reversed
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 20:58:28 180 turn
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 20:58:45 thats on a perfect occasion, but sometimes they go off in a random direction
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 21:01:33 sometimes they don't get the missile away
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 21:02:21 but thats why most of my PVP vehicles have caging (made of ladders, might be why)
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 21:03:47 the vehicles that actually reflect missiles are the drones, quadcopters specifically, usually shit like this happens (light blue is the missile path)
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 21:04:44 maybe its because it tries to go for the prop (theres like 8 propeller blocks incase some break)
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 21:06:28 it does a good job, and even if a missile gets past this bullshit theres still shit in the way
creations-chat 2022-11-01 21:08:41 creations chat moment
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 21:09:15 almost like i built it for war
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 21:11:57 it works great too, always wonder why people don't use quadcopters in pvp
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 21:15:47 i have no words for what i am seeing right now
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 21:22:10 the chances of them hitting a flying target with an unguided bomb is incredibly low, and if it was a custom missile, well, i can do some wacky movement until they give up
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 21:22:42 even if they do hit, sometimes the damage won't even register
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 21:23:04 lag bs
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 21:23:36 well it hasn't happened to me
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 21:27:14 i mean easier to get results for survivability when people are actively trying to kill you
general 2022-11-01 21:46:02 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 21:47:45 decided to make a thing for shits and giggles
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 21:48:49 i don't expect this to be useful in any way possible other then scaring people
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 21:49:03 because ooo spinny spin
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 21:49:21 (i switched to suspension because doing this shit with motors was impossible)
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 21:50:05 this is a mistake

the-dump 2022-11-01 22:19:44 i see it
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 22:40:10 well the caging can take a missile with the props taking minimal damage (like 2 of 8 propellers, it still flies just fine)
plane-crazy 2022-11-01 22:45:50 and its a very rare example

general 2022-11-04 01:33:25 nuclear ramjet
general 2022-11-04 01:33:31 that sounds like a wonderful idea
general 2022-11-04 01:33:47 i couldn’t possibly wonder why that would be a bad idea
general 2022-11-04 01:35:31 but dude your plane is powered by nuclear power, that sounds cool as hell
general 2022-11-04 01:36:35 until you remember that that’s probably a horrible idea as you’ll be flying a nuclear bomb
general 2022-11-04 01:37:24 just don’t crash it 👍
general 2022-11-04 01:38:16 or land too hard
general 2022-11-04 01:38:20 or sneeze on it
general 2022-11-04 01:38:40 LOL
general 2022-11-04 01:39:21 didn’t the russians make an engine that emits a very toxic gas
general 2022-11-04 01:40:13 which is designed like shit because they sized up the original one and spewed out incredibly toxic gas into a nearby neighborhood?
general 2022-11-04 01:41:41 i think it was something to do with the blades causing vibrations
general 2022-11-04 01:41:56 due to super sonic aero bullshit in the engine
general 2022-11-04 01:42:53 because gassing everyone behind the plane was a good idea
general 2022-11-04 01:45:07 quailer to the rescue
general 2022-11-04 01:50:58 you ever hear of the line ‘use a gun, and if that don’t work, use more gun’

contest-chat 2022-11-04 02:56:37 bro if i submitted the drone too (i had just fucked around with one i built already which means no go) the pumpkin i would have actually gotten somewhere
contest-chat 2022-11-04 02:57:10 the pumpkin i submitted looks like ass
contest-chat 2022-11-04 02:57:26 i could recolor it to red and make the stem green
contest-chat 2022-11-04 02:57:27 boom
contest-chat 2022-11-04 02:57:30 apple
contest-chat 2022-11-04 02:58:00 btw the reason why the stem is a box is because i orignally had the drone pick up the pumpkin with a magnet
contest-chat 2022-11-04 02:58:09 i did not change it
contest-chat 2022-11-04 02:58:18 that was probably a bad idea

general 2022-11-05 02:01:58 depends on how the steam is used
general 2022-11-05 02:02:10 like if its to spin a turbine for electricity
general 2022-11-05 02:02:58 just using the steam like normal would be a questionable choice (radiation), but it probably would be considered nuclear

general 2022-11-07 23:05:38 oh no, i came up with something even worse
general 2022-11-07 23:06:15 i use a spring to launch them and then whack them like a baseball
general 2022-11-07 23:06:45 actually, let me try a simple one first
general 2022-11-07 23:12:47 
general 2022-11-07 23:13:07 and god taketh away

general 2022-11-07 23:15:30 perfect
general 2022-11-07 23:15:37 no one would suspect a thing
general 2022-11-07 23:16:03 the springs are not working <:empty:794431705070174238>

general 2022-11-07 23:33:24 here we go
general 2022-11-07 23:34:04 don't forget 'cry harder', 'mic up', and 'bad'

general 2022-11-11 03:10:47 like if someone mugged me in an alleyway in somewhere god knows where, and if they came up to me with an airsoft pistol which locks deceiving like the real thing i will think its the real thing

events-chat 2022-11-11 15:17:17 yes
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:17:52 also i have built a drill, might also incorporate some other spinning bits into the design
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:18:12 also minibots would be cool
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:20:30 i’d rather go for 7x7x5 build space with the same rules as the normal bots since we were given like 55x55x36 or something
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:22:03 mine eclipses this 10x10 rating
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:23:18 mine is a heavyweight with a giant arm to lift others and impale them
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:23:27 because drills are good
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:24:32 and right now i only see tiny bots
events-chat 2022-11-11 15:25:37 i know mint is going to make a horror like no other which will probably hurt big time

plane-crazy 2022-11-11 16:14:16 i’m currently engineering a new combat drone similar to my current mvp drone which uses a conventional rotor setup, with a stack of motors controlling yaw, pitch, roll, and lift
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 16:14:24 to combat these jets
plane-crazy 2022-11-11 16:15:08 well when they see a very large destructible object

events-chat 2022-11-12 01:03:35 hey rbk, i  got a question
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:04:58 <@466793357318815744> i have an 'unconventional' bot idea, but first I want to ask you whats the dumbest idea for a bot you've heard of since the first event
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:06:56 wow
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:07:01 wait you're kidding right
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:07:16 💀

events-chat 2022-11-12 01:08:34 dude
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:08:40 you don't need to LAUNCH them
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:08:43 you just gotta drop them
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:09:14 ok, brilliant idea for you
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:09:31 all you gotta do is spin around
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:09:34 really really fast
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:09:50 and things will spill out in a circle
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:11:02 true
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:11:38 also, that silly and goofy idea of a drone swarm? well you wanna hear something even more funny?
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:12:32 i've given up on a flipper, a drill, and another flipper for this one stand out idea

events-chat 2022-11-12 01:31:52 rbk can i possibly use a suspension block as a slider (its for the sword so it doesn't fall out of place)(yes i know its against the rules)

events-chat 2022-11-12 16:56:44 we tried
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:57:28 vertical flipper?
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:57:44 oh
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:57:47 yeah uh, fun fact
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:58:11 bro i don't know man i just woke up
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:58:25 anyways some of the vertical spinners
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:58:49 were **too** powerful despite the 10 torque requirement
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:58:59 wait no its 5 mb
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:59:08 doubt? oh boy
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:59:15 here let me get the clip
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:02:38 ok i can't get the clip my laptop won't let me at the moment so i'll just describe it to you
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:03:23 yeah that
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:03:39 but the one for this event was considered legal
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:05:06 and it was quite strong, able to toss large bots (keep in mind, only 2 ballast beams or 6 ballast blocks, this is for later), so i had the wonderful idea of dropping something heavy on the spinner
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:06:12 something like this, a giant ballast beam filled kinetic bomb that i made to drop on people for shits and giggles because dropping shit is fun
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:06:49 i know
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:06:54 it was just for testing
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:07:24 i'm not using this in the competition, relax
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:07:52 buddy can i fucking continue the story
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:08:45 anyways i drop this on him and it gets launched at mach 2 away from the map
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:09:01 i absolutely agree, those suck
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:29:13 heres an example which has haunted me since the beginning of this challenge, the saw hammer, or as i call it, the swammer
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:31:03 other hammer bots can swing like a pro while mine lifts with the speed of a skeleton
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:33:01 torque stacking isn't allowed from what i've seen
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:33:34 on the rules
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:33:57 oh, yeah that you can do
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:34:01 mb
events-chat 2022-11-12 19:51:18 hey rbk i have a goofy idea
events-chat 2022-11-12 19:53:59 so you remember the saw hammer idea?
events-chat 2022-11-12 19:54:12 well uh, that went bad so i decided to make a
events-chat 2022-11-12 19:54:38 a giant blade
events-chat 2022-11-12 19:54:51 forgive the motorlock, i made a ton of it for redundancy
events-chat 2022-11-12 19:56:19 red sun
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:04:12 but why i'm showing you this funky idea is that the 5 torque motors can **barely** lift it
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:04:17 or swing it
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:04:48 its like giving a skeleton a sledgehammer and telling him to swing it
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:17:14 if we really wanted to do bots
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:17:21 lets complicate things then
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:18:32 lets simulate batteries too by using fuel blocks + 2 small rockets or 2 super rockets (they both cancel each other out)
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:19:50 i wanna hear about the ban actually
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:42:21 <@466793357318815744> can i have more torque on these back motors (currently set to 5 (under-performing)), i'd recommend like 10-15 for a stronger swing (or the ability to swing in general)
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:24:53 yes, because this is what happens when you place 1 block incorrectly
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:25:21 it is undergoing metamorphosis
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:26:12 
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:27:52 how
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:28:14 8th
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:28:15 if i know
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:28:17 knew
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:28:19 i'd say it
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:28:29 i have no genuine idea 💀
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:28:35 nor do i wish to find out
events-chat 2022-11-13 01:29:07 i mean, its a spinner

events-chat 2022-11-13 02:15:03 alright

events-chat 2022-11-13 02:16:12 i've only done that once
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:16:54 and plus the one rbk is using is modified, the stabilizers are stronger
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:17:33 and also lets not forget this is roblox physics
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:17:59 also plane crazy
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:18:43 whatever you THINK is going to work will not work
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:19:14 it took 4 people to get rid of a wheel
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:19:20 **4**
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:19:36 actually, we have yet to prove that one
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:19:48 oh
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:19:55 well i didn't know <:clueless:942802644043464734>
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:20:51 i'm still trying to get a good design 💀
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:21:13 this is the **3rd** time i've had to start from the ground up
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:23:47 i started with a large custom with a very big bucket type thing you'd see on heavy industrial machinery (BIIIIIIIG BIG PISTONS) which worked well on hard countering mint
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:26:54 heres v1, big and chunky
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:27:09 designed like shit, preformed decently
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:27:33 to be fair
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:27:37 no one had a spear
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:28:23 they couldn't get in there and if anything was going to swing at me from above i can block the attack
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:28:46 and did i mention the drill?
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:29:32 i just wanna build something that works
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:29:56 hey rbk, you got a visitor
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:31:04 yeah so after i decided against moving on from the drill and used a long drum to actually flip
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:31:37 that failed due to unknown reasons (the bullshit torque requirement)
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:32:06 so i ditched the whole thing and said 'sword robot'
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:32:25 so i tried to make a bot with a robotic arm mounted up top holding a sword
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:32:35 no
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:32:41 it just sucked
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:33:05 well berry
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:33:17 my plan was something like this
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:33:22 https://tenor.com/view/katana-robot-sword-fight-robot-fight-gif-6148194
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:33:27 take one of these
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:33:29 slap it on top
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:33:32 dominate
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:33:44 **it did not work at all**
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:33:57 torque requirements killed it
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:34:01 of all things
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:34:51 but the big claim to fame was the blade itself
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:35:19 it was suppose to be an HF blade
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:35:31 where the cutters on it slide back and forth incredibly fast
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:35:40 and just shred anything it touches
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:36:18 **however, for that amount of speed, i would need a suspension block to keep the thing together, oh boy**
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:36:28 ***i wish i had one***
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:36:38 so i gave up on that
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:36:56 kept the base because it was decent
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:39:59 and then ended up with a saw hammer thing
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:40:39 it failed because the saw hammer on the end of an arm was too heavy (**the torque requirement**)
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:42:46 mine is named big nuts...
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:43:04 fuck it, i'll make chains
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:43:13 i will
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:43:16 but wait
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:43:21 **how do i stay upright**
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:43:43 ok
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:43:47 no stability
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:44:12 true..
events-chat 2022-11-13 02:44:23 how the fuck did i forget i could do that

events-chat 2022-11-13 03:26:36 the cons is **everyone knows what you're doing**

events-chat 2022-11-13 03:27:25 nuts 2
events-chat 2022-11-13 03:29:09 the executioner robot was suppose to work well

events-chat 2022-11-15 03:56:23 despite what suri says
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:57:58 its because you designed your drive system stupid
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:58:12 your bot is **glitching out**
events-chat 2022-11-15 03:58:52 your wheels are spinning so hard and so fast that the game struggles
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:00:10 yes

events-chat 2022-11-15 04:13:14 you think it doing THIS is fine
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:14:11 and you’re fine when someone gets launched a quarter of the way to the sun when it eventually does this
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:14:25 because it happened to me
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:17:52 all i’m saying is 200 torque per motor would fix your problems, but if you wanna be stubborn about it sure, be my guest
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:19:26 guess what a 200 torque limit would fix?
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:20:04 because less force, you gotta experience it to understand it
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:21:26 with 1k your wheels slide
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:21:51 there is not enough traction in this game to put that power to the ground
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:22:07 and you’re using 5x5 cylinders
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:22:30 thats a lot of spinning
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:22:50 but also theres 32 wheels, each 2 blocks wide
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:23:12 looked like 2 mb
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:23:41 but also you’re using 2 motors per wheel
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:23:54 not counting the unpowered one
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:24:07 which means you have 64 motors to drive your bot
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:24:50 you have a grand total of 64k torque from all the powered motors combined
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:25:49 i’d like you to take a wild guess how much of that is getting down to the ground to move you  forward due to the wheel slipping
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:27:26 i’m fairly certain its well under that even with fabric wheels
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:27:44 yeah you’re using a 2 motor setup, i can only wonder
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:28:22 i’d say you’re getting around 10-20% of that power to the ground
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:28:52 the 2 motor setup
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:28:57 unless one is locked
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:29:09 is one locked
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:29:22 ok
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:19 you have 2 motors
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:23 one for forward
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:25 and back
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:32 one for turning
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:52 yeah
events-chat 2022-11-15 04:30:54 thats true

events-chat 2022-11-15 19:39:02 what actually happened is you turned pvp back on when shit got to obvious
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:39:25 and then your bot broke because its built like a  knockoff
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:40:23 with blades having a similar fragility to your ability to lie
events-chat 2022-11-15 19:41:03 no

general 2022-11-26 01:15:13 it took an hour for the arena wall to get set up
general 2022-11-26 01:15:35 berry
general 2022-11-26 01:15:44 unsurprisingly
general 2022-11-26 01:16:06 i didn't get my shit kicked, but i did lose to a chat vote
general 2022-11-26 01:16:50 even though i did more damage and clearly was intact i still lost, i can look through that vod and see it again, but its not worth making a big stink about it, i'll probably have to sub in tomorrow

general 2022-11-26 01:19:42 there was no WAY
general 2022-11-26 01:20:07 no it got morfix 💀
general 2022-11-26 01:20:24 that guy would have made me bounce out of the arena due to contact
general 2022-11-26 01:20:39 and my incredibly shit design which is dumb
general 2022-11-26 01:20:49 i think so

general 2022-11-26 03:00:04 you are not entitled to that, he stopped development due to stress or something

plane-crazy 2022-11-29 04:38:07 do you need to talk to someone? is there something wrong with you to the point where you have to feel superior over some random on the internet

plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:16:24 oh wait is this for shredders
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:17:01 if i can make a flying chainsaw then i say otherwise
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:17:45 its built to survive
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:19:16 weren’t the original shredder bugs built to be assembled by even a no brainer
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:19:50 oh wait
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:19:55 it was you
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:21:25 rather then telling you to painfully drive a bamboo stick through your heart like the next guy i would actually like to thank you for giving me the chance to make the dumbest aircraft of all time
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:22:25 that is why some people would want to drive a bamboo stick through your heart
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:22:47 ok first question why did you make a tut for it
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:23:01 thats how it was back then 💀
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:24:26 did you think it would cause any future problems at all at the time?
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:25:09 what was your first reaction seeing some toxic dimwhit using it in pvp servers
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:27:10 did you see anyone at all take bits off the shredder bugs (the original with the ‘tail’ or shit)
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:27:16 to like
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:27:19 inovate
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:27:29 well
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:28:21 i am one of those, i took off those odd tails seeing potential and stuck 2 of them on the back of a weird frame and put some smaller inverted ones on the front
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:28:55 i built one that had jaws
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:29:07 2 walls of cutters that make a V
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:30:11 and a bonus, the ‘jaws’ moved back and forth in a reciprocating motion making them more effective
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:30:35 i learned this goofy technique after building an HF blade
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:31:22 and this jaws shredder was built to combat the smaller og shredders, it failed due to my bad piloting
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:31:39 it also used magnet engines
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:31:57 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:32:02 they’re just uh
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:32:07 **situational**
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:32:22 complex builds do not like them
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:32:37 mine was simple enough for this to work
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:32:56 and it needed bursts of speed, silent and deadly
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:33:42 i used mine as a charger, go far away and fly at your target at mach 2, if it worked out the HF jaws on the front would evaporate one bug
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:34:15 i later decided to be a little bit goofy
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:34:30 let me get a screenshot
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:37:31 <@834898687959367751> rate this monstrosity **(yes thats a flying chainsaw)**
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:37:50 benifits
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:38:07 i built it for shits and giggles
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:38:21 and to prove that i can make a chainsaw fly
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:38:44 but believe it or not, the chainsaw sucks in the air
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:40:10 the grounded chainsaw has cutting power unmatched by conventional shredders you’d normally see in a public server, able to chop like no other in record pace
general 2022-12-16 03:41:19 whitename activity
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:41:30 hey i know that guy
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:41:32 wait
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:41:38 no i don’t, theres simply too many
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:42:47 i love the dome
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:43:01 i cannot focus on anything but the dome 💀
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:43:10 the dome look a little funny
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:43:41 i just don’t see glass domes on the fronts of planes
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:43:51 i think its a little funny looking i like it
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:45:11 glass professional
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:45:50 it has its purpose though
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:46:40 fun fact: roblox glass can mess with vision
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:47:27 depends on the angle
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:48:24 yes, and thats why if i’m making a window to see in combat i’ll use legacy
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:48:56 decals, water, and slightly transparent objects disappear
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:49:18 i have abused this in the past it was fun
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:50:28 you can make blocks like so very little transparent to make it look fully visible, but with glass you can see right through
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:50:55 i planned on using this goofy technique for some sort of puzzle game
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 03:51:09 never came around to it sadly

general 2022-12-18 23:22:48 ARE YOU STUPID
general 2022-12-18 23:23:11 YES AND YOU'RE SAYING IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT
general 2022-12-18 23:23:29 LIKE THE ONE FROM FALLOUT
general 2022-12-18 23:23:54 you did
general 2022-12-18 23:24:30 this is true
general 2022-12-18 23:24:45 but also why did you turn this into not being viable
general 2022-12-18 23:25:44 ok so why are you telling mire that like its suppose to always be viable
general 2022-12-18 23:26:18 FR
general 2022-12-18 23:26:37 thats what i'm trying to say thank you vip
general 2022-12-18 23:27:05 ok so now we're going to no value
general 2022-12-18 23:27:13 ok suri
general 2022-12-18 23:27:30 that is entirely your opinion, and i do not agree with you **at all**
general 2022-12-18 23:27:53 wrong
general 2022-12-18 23:28:38 you saying the vertibird has no value is your opinion, and i disagree
general 2022-12-18 23:29:18 you saying its not viable also doesn't really have any point, since we're not in a combat zone trying to make something to fight people
general 2022-12-18 23:30:56 didn't you point out that its not viable to try and make a point off that and fail miserably
general 2022-12-18 23:31:33 you are illiterate
general 2022-12-18 23:31:40 read it
general 2022-12-18 23:31:57 i can give it a go after i tell suri to shut the hell up
general 2022-12-18 23:32:08 and its bad
general 2022-12-18 23:32:27 i uh
general 2022-12-18 23:32:33 alright then
general 2022-12-18 23:32:52 have fun with that then
general 2022-12-18 23:33:27 your point is invalidated by the fact that it doesn't have to be viable
general 2022-12-18 23:33:41 actually lets get specific
general 2022-12-18 23:33:49 viable in what?
general 2022-12-18 23:36:17 you're expecting a virtual aircraft from a 'lego game' based off the one from fallout to preform as good as a real v-22?
general 2022-12-18 23:37:07 if thats the case i'm gonna need to give you a round of applause
general 2022-12-18 23:37:43 holy shit suri you've done it, you've gone insane
general 2022-12-18 23:37:51 https://tenor.com/view/bravo-applause-round-of-standing-gif-20790999
general 2022-12-18 23:39:38 i have never felt more mentally stable hearing someone think a vertibird made in plane crazy, which is a roblox game, should preform as good as a v-22 which the vertibird probably took inspiration from
general 2022-12-18 23:42:44 ok but looks aren't the only factor to performance
general 2022-12-18 23:43:31 you eyeballing it might work sometimes, but most of the time get ready to be wrong
general 2022-12-18 23:44:38 for the record this was not ironic
general 2022-12-18 23:45:10 i still haven't forgotten your topic change btw suri
general 2022-12-18 23:46:44 but does it have to work?
general 2022-12-18 23:47:14 last i checked roblox or plane crazy does not count as reality

general 2022-12-18 23:50:37 also from a glance you don't see how the vertibird may be working, it could have a center of mass moved up a bit to make sure it doesn't spin over, you don't figure this shit out by just **staring at it**
general 2022-12-18 23:50:56 with a static image no less

general 2022-12-22 03:57:59 we’re talking about poland
general 2022-12-22 03:59:25 anyways after plenty of research, i found out, the men in poland become less masculine due to very good healthcare and living conditions (so i’ve heard), thus dropping testosterone levels
general 2022-12-22 04:00:32 and in america it may seem like it doesn’t make sense, but remember that all the femboys here come from california

general 2023-01-03 01:33:24 thats what i'm saying
general 2023-01-03 01:33:37 so you don't have a radar
general 2023-01-03 01:34:20 ok, can you post what you have?
general 2023-01-03 01:34:46 mf says functional and then says its not done
general 2023-01-03 01:36:01 so its functional, but not done, and  you need to work more
general 2023-01-03 01:36:05 ok can you like
general 2023-01-03 01:36:11 show us what you even have so far
general 2023-01-03 01:36:39 its a hover engine and a suspension block
bot-central 2023-01-03 01:37:06 -servers
general 2023-01-03 01:38:20 right can we see proof of this though
general 2023-01-03 01:39:13 on god at this point just use your eyes
general 2023-01-03 01:41:06 **ok but can we get proof of it**
general 2023-01-03 01:48:48 💀
general 2023-01-03 01:49:45 (guys its radar i swear!!)
general 2023-01-03 01:52:07 it is literally a hover engine and a suspension block spinning around
general 2023-01-03 01:57:19 'guys look at my real radar its only god like a 8ish block range wow let me get my dictionary to sound incredibly smart even though someone else could recreate it in under a minute'
general 2023-01-03 01:58:12 bro literally what i did
general 2023-01-03 01:59:56 for the record i did not see that
general 2023-01-03 02:00:40 none of the above
general 2023-01-03 02:02:30 didn't he say a bunch of shit like about how light and waves are in roblox or plane crazy and that you can recreate gas like bruh what the hell do i do what am i suppose to  say
general 2023-01-03 02:02:53 whats with all the complicated bullshit
general 2023-01-03 02:03:09 just say its decorative or not so that we don't go down that route
general 2023-01-03 02:04:29 (paper)
general 2023-01-03 02:09:43 tilted wings
general 2023-01-03 02:10:39 which one will make lift
general 2023-01-03 02:11:01 BINGO
general 2023-01-03 02:12:42 suri the wings are literally a rectangle
general 2023-01-03 02:13:27 ok lets try this again, assuming these were moving in a straight fuckin line to the right, which ones gonna go up?
general 2023-01-03 02:13:36 which one will have lift
general 2023-01-03 02:13:51 yes, and what about the one on the left? does that one produce lift?
general 2023-01-03 02:14:21 (this was for suri but you are correct)
general 2023-01-03 02:22:30 why the fuck are we talking about lift again
general 2023-01-03 02:26:53 the only block that mimics lift aerodynamically is the propeller block
general 2023-01-03 02:28:37 this is true
general 2023-01-03 02:29:38 fast moving air below, and slow moving air on top
general 2023-01-03 02:30:11 wait shit
general 2023-01-03 02:30:17 it is below fuck
general 2023-01-03 02:30:21 my bad
general 2023-01-03 02:31:17 HOLY SHIT WINGS ARE RACI-

general 2023-01-03 02:36:16 i call it switching the 2 around
general 2023-01-03 02:36:27 because i forgot the order
general 2023-01-03 02:36:45 ok
general 2023-01-03 02:37:17 so are you gonna copy paste another essay to prove i’m wrong because you just have to prove you’re right?
general 2023-01-03 02:38:08 we knew it was wrong before i realized my mistake
general 2023-01-03 02:38:15 i’m waiting
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 02:38:45 i know it was incorrect now thank you suri
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 02:38:52 you didn’t have to go grab a diagram
general 2023-01-03 02:39:24 no suri is just built like a 🤓
general 2023-01-03 02:40:15 i literally did

general 2023-01-03 02:41:02 brother i doubt you even have one
general 2023-01-03 02:41:52 well can you show us it?
general 2023-01-03 02:42:14 no it just pushes the suspension
general 2023-01-03 02:42:50 hover engines break the laws of physics, and newton himself
general 2023-01-03 02:43:08 correct
general 2023-01-03 02:43:49 literally this
general 2023-01-03 02:44:29 whats it gonna do
general 2023-01-03 02:44:33 look at me?
general 2023-01-03 02:45:27 most of the time i’m going to see the target before they strike with my own 2 eyes
general 2023-01-03 02:45:46 it is true
general 2023-01-03 02:45:56 on god
general 2023-01-03 02:48:24 but what if i **see them**

general 2023-01-03 02:52:18 hi can you prove you have a functioning radar in plane crazy with actual evidence
general 2023-01-03 02:52:28 rather then just saying you have one
general 2023-01-03 02:52:59 whitename
general 2023-01-03 02:53:40 hi please show us the radar
general 2023-01-03 02:54:13 amazing

general 2023-01-03 03:05:42 post it in action
general 2023-01-03 03:06:53 he has no proof
general 2023-01-03 03:07:29 no prooooof
general 2023-01-03 03:07:52 it is useful you’re just not doing it
general 2023-01-03 03:08:56 this is about you not posting proof not me making a functional one
general 2023-01-03 03:09:16 i’m not doing it for you bro
general 2023-01-03 03:09:33 on god
general 2023-01-03 03:10:19 who is gonna use radar with that short of a distance
general 2023-01-03 03:11:04 if its 1 plot of range i might as well just use my eyes
general 2023-01-03 03:12:07 yeah but like
general 2023-01-03 03:12:24 those will probably get to you before you pick it up
general 2023-01-03 03:12:39 later when
general 2023-01-03 03:15:27 literally what i was about to say
general 2023-01-03 03:15:59 why the fuck do you have 2
general 2023-01-03 03:16:22 
general 2023-01-03 03:17:27 alright lets talk about the thing again
general 2023-01-03 03:17:56 how the hell did you fit a radar into that box, which from what i see is like a 5x5x5 space inside
general 2023-01-03 03:18:40 other then it being a block on a motor that you control
general 2023-01-03 03:20:42 wait
general 2023-01-03 03:21:00 we have no idea
general 2023-01-03 03:21:18 but i bet i could find out based on how it acts
general 2023-01-03 03:22:11 (the power of how to basics)

plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:32:52 nvm i found it
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:33:11 yeah dude showed what was happening on the inside but not what was happening on the outside
general 2023-01-03 03:33:50 what about the car batteries i throw in the ocean as sacrifices
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:35:21 magic
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:37:08 what i did <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:37:24 but it actually works
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:38:15 it detected a person
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:38:21 and responded
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:39:42 there are 2 people there
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:40:11 hover engines react to characters and other blocks
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:41:33 that would just be a hover engine but complicated
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:41:54 i agree
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:42:32 we need better proof then it just moving
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:42:55 actually
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:43:03 i can prove you’re faking it
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:43:14 hang on let me check it again
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:44:51 hmm
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:45:32 if this were really working, we’d have a different result
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:46:28 green is where the little red thing should point

plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:47:23 pcc moment
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:48:27 ^
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:49:47 yeah its because its a motor you’re controlling
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:50:17 you won’t show us how it works so we won’t believe you
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:51:10 how do we prove it when we don’t see whats outside
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:51:24 and even then whats outside DOESN’T MATCH UP
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:51:49 thats inside perspective
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:52:01 ^
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:52:36 those buttons don’t change color when you press them
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:52:56 meaning we either have to take your word for it or call it fake
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:53:09 and on god we’re calling it fake
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:54:40 not to mention that it moved in a rather fixed manner, like it was only 1 motor doing the work
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:55:02 we need both outside and inside
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:56:49 he won’t
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 03:56:55 doesn’t have the balls

plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:19:09 give me proper evidence and i can assess it from there
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:19:40 for now though, its unable to be proven real
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:19:56 you could just be pressing buttons

plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:22:48 THATS WHAT WE’RE SAYING
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:23:28 he has suspicious evidence
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:23:40 that are very questionable
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:24:13 but we need an outside perspective to see what it could be detecting
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:24:32 is it detecting bullshit?
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:24:43 FR
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:25:16 but you don’t give us evidence to say ‘oh wait, thats real’

plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:53:07 bring a shovel <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:53:42 brilliant
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:54:58 does body slamming the cow count
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:55:13 like you jump up from the same height
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:55:21 while the cow is on the ground
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:55:36 and you drive your elbow into its neck and split it open
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:55:50 or just be overweight
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:56:20 just be the rock
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:56:55 give the head a good many twists back and forth to wear out the joints and give it a pull
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:57:15 into a wall
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:57:53 punch the cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:57:57 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:58:22 if i had the strength the rock i could level that cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:59:09 you are the weapon
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:59:30 man i’ma beat up that cow with you in just a second
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:59:42 boat
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 04:59:59 calm yourself
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:00:36 if you swing fast enough you can
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:01:13 if you can get your fist moving fast enough you can punch through the cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:01:26 in theory <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:01:56 assuming your hand doesn’t break either
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:02:18 from impact or the speed up
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:02:31 just use a shovel
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:02:51 on god if i had to fight a cow i would not do it bare handed
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:03:18 do any of us have experience with side stepping cows
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:03:59 thats what i’m saying
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:04:37 i can dive out of the way of a cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:04:57 pig why are you repeating everything i say
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:05:13 or are we just thinking the same
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:05:42 but like what if i see them coming from a bit farther away
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:05:56 normal cows can do that too
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:06:03 fr
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:06:45 i approve
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:07:14 bacon why did you ask us this
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:07:27 are you getting challenged to fight a cow bare handed and need advice?
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:08:29 top gun the cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:09:08 learn to fly 2
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:09:31 become a penguin and by a ballistic missile
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:09:40 because they can do that
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:10:13 are you going to fight a cow bare handed
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:10:26 ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:10:30 brilliant idea
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:10:37 don’t fight the cow bare handed
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:10:41 bring a shovel
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:10:57 now hear me out
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:11:12 with this shovel you gotta knock out the cown
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:11:22 hit it over the top of head
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:11:41 actually go for a stealth strike
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:11:56 hit the knees and make the cow fall over
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:12:30 I’M GETTING TO THAT
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:12:38 ok so then you position the head of the shovel over the cows
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:12:43 head
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:12:47 i mean neck
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:13:05 and then pound on the head of the shovel to drive it through the neck
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:13:23 hopefully shearing the bone
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:13:50 why a cow and why bare handed
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:14:04 man just jump the fuckin fence
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:14:11 yes its fair
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:14:25 ok in that case bring a gun
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:15:05 bring a nice shotgun loaded with 12 gauge slugs and penetrate the skull
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:15:25 blast that stupid cow’s brains out
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:16:01 just stab the cow with a knife and let it bleed out
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:16:19 maybe 36 times to be safe
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:16:38 safe is like
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:16:41 572
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:16:52 for fun is 3057
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:17:37 confident is 500 thats the number you use when you are wondering how to kill a cow bare handed
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:17:51 ok then get more people
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:18:04 jump down and stab
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:18:46 assuming the spear didn’t break you could easily drive it through the cow
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:19:25 with the weight of a person behind it and the speed from the fall, it’ll impale like butter
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:19:55 if you climb the tree you have an advantage
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:20:24 theres good leather and theres bad leather
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:20:54 we’re talking about a long sharp rock on a stick
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:21:33 is this with mechanical advantage though
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:21:38 or just them
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:21:56 if i had enough mechanical advantage i could lift this earth
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:22:44 i forgot about that part that is completely true
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:23:23 fr
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:23:31 pig can though
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:23:34 i bet
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:24:16 hes built different
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:25:08 distract it and then go for the knees
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:25:23 use a tripwire
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:25:31 maybe a gun
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:25:45 maybe just use a shovel
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:26:25 bru use a ROCK
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:26:41 hit that bitch with a stone
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:27:07 enrage the cow by calling it gay
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:27:24 thats a bull
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 05:28:00 ain’t no cow from around here gonna do that

plane-crazy 2023-01-05 15:53:41 just snip the tail
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 15:56:38 the tail looks a bit fragile
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:01:25 what i mean is if i cut here
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:01:49 because theres 1 motor keeping the segments together and it’ll come apart quick
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:02:12 lemme look a bit
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:02:50 add another motor at the bottom for redundancy i think
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:03:00 wait
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:03:03 no you can’t nvm
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:04:14 you’d have to make a whole new tail
general 2023-01-05 16:04:25 bread
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:09:33 hmm
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:11:11 i’m just gonna say you gotta make it go faster
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:11:23 replace the propellers with super rockets
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:12:08 
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:13:02 not like that just move them in a bit
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:13:23 check the hover thrusters and see how much drag they make
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:13:56 settings
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:15:28 remove all drag from the hover thrusters since that *might* be whats limiting you
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:15:50 damn
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:17:18 you need speed
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:17:21 more speed
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:17:53 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:18:04 if you go faster you will do more damage
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:18:28 tf you on
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:18:42 alright well clearly i can’t convince you
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:19:30 its literally that simple, if the cutters move faster, they will deal more damage
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 16:19:39 to a point

general 2023-04-21 01:19:26 the roads in my area are either ok or dogshit
general 2023-04-21 01:19:47 up in PA
general 2023-04-21 01:20:35 this place is a dump and i’m not even in the big city areas
general 2023-04-21 01:21:15 my state neighbors are new jersey and ohio, theres no wonder why it ain’t good
general 2023-04-21 01:22:25 30-40% of the cars i see here have jersey license plates
general 2023-04-21 01:22:55 a godless land with nice beaches if you get there at the right time
general 2023-04-21 01:23:15 i see just about any car
general 2023-04-21 01:23:49 not really a pattern with the cars but there are a ton of trucks here since my area is further from the city
general 2023-04-21 01:24:35 back to roads, oh my god
general 2023-04-21 01:24:44 we never get roads repaved
general 2023-04-21 01:25:21 i think i’ve seen a road get paved again 1 time
general 2023-04-21 01:26:01 want to know how the potholes are *’fixed’*?
general 2023-04-21 01:26:41 we fuckin half ass it by filling it in with new pavement and say ‘yeah seems good enough’ and then when winter comes around everything fucking breaks
general 2023-04-21 01:27:06 no you see
general 2023-04-21 01:27:10 because they half ass it
general 2023-04-21 01:27:18 theres still air under the pavement
general 2023-04-21 01:27:41 moisture gets in there and then CRACK
general 2023-04-21 01:27:58 i like pigeons
general 2023-04-21 01:28:18 but i hate being around them because they are bombers
general 2023-04-21 01:28:50 i’ve almost punched one once after it tried to take a fry from me
general 2023-04-21 01:29:06 this was in jersey so go figure
general 2023-04-21 01:29:15 had to blend in somehow
general 2023-04-21 01:30:07 decapitated by what
general 2023-04-21 01:30:15 oh righth
general 2023-04-21 01:30:18 those bastards
general 2023-04-21 01:31:02 i have chickens at my place that we take care of, and we have a pellet gun just for shooting hawks
general 2023-04-21 01:31:27 pellet gun is not giving it justice
general 2023-04-21 01:31:46 that bitch looks like a gun, is made by a company that makes real guns
general 2023-04-21 01:32:03 and shoots metal projectiles called **destroyers**
general 2023-04-21 01:32:11 those things are heavy
general 2023-04-21 01:32:45 the reason we don’t use a shotgun is to avoid attracting attention, wanna know why?
general 2023-04-21 01:33:02 we technically aren’t allowed to shoot the hawks
general 2023-04-21 01:33:16 indeed
general 2023-04-21 01:33:29 so if one comes by and finds out
general 2023-04-21 01:33:42 we all have to stop what we’re doing and put that mf in the ground
general 2023-04-21 01:34:00 literally
general 2023-04-21 01:34:07 stop and dig a hole
general 2023-04-21 01:34:22 damn bro you’re lucky
general 2023-04-21 01:34:35 my backyard is smaller then my house
general 2023-04-21 01:34:49 we just go behind the fence
general 2023-04-21 01:35:10 we haven’t had to actually bury a hawk yet
general 2023-04-21 01:35:17 but we have shot one
general 2023-04-21 01:37:24 oh we have foxes here too
general 2023-04-21 01:37:32 so thats something else to worry about
general 2023-04-21 01:39:58 too much

general 2023-04-21 01:47:43 (street baseball is a term i came up with to describe trying your best to decapitate someone with a baseball bat by hitting them in the head as hard as possible)
general 2023-04-21 01:50:01 and don’t mention sleeping on the floor

general 2023-04-21 15:55:18 all the health insurance does is negotiate for a lower price on the bill which you can do yourself from what i've heard
general 2023-04-21 15:56:33 amazing
general 2023-04-21 15:57:33 the reason the prices are so high is because they're sick of getting low balled by the insurance companies (greed)

general 2023-04-30 02:24:56 damn
general 2023-04-30 02:25:05 i had to wait till 16
general 2023-04-30 02:25:34 wait
general 2023-04-30 02:25:34 thats something a robot can do
general 2023-04-30 02:25:40 right they're already doing tha
general 2023-04-30 02:26:11 the chatGPT in question
general 2023-04-30 02:27:22 make a gun that shoots a rocket, and then the rocket bit snaps off like a 2nd stage and continues to gain speed
general 2023-04-30 02:30:56 co2 is more scary in my opinion, one canister does all that work for you
general 2023-04-30 02:31:40 and the ones i've seen have some crazy muzzle velocities similar to actual guns\
general 2023-04-30 02:32:04 hi tech
general 2023-04-30 02:34:20 co2 canisters are tough as fuck, you'd have to go out of your way to make it pop and most systems that use co2 cans are tough enough to hold those pressures if you take good care of them
general 2023-04-30 02:35:44 coil guns are cool, railguns sound cooler
general 2023-04-30 02:36:28 you're more likely to get shot in the body then in the hand
general 2023-04-30 02:39:01 well if we're gonna be realistic, who is going to bring a co2 powered weapon to a battlefield
general 2023-04-30 02:39:59 true
general 2023-04-30 02:40:31 but i don't think anyone in their right mind would know that its basically certain death if they dare try that
general 2023-04-30 02:43:21 i think if you drop one on the nozzle it can launch off at a ridiculous speed
general 2023-04-30 02:43:40 assuming you break the thing keeping sealed i forgor the name
general 2023-04-30 02:44:06 rocket launcher
general 2023-04-30 02:44:40 you know.. a weapon that shoots co2 canisters like a rocket launcher seems like an interesting idea
general 2023-04-30 02:45:12 i wouldn't want to do it though the government would kill me 💀
general 2023-04-30 02:45:44 i'm pretty sure you can buy like huge packs of them at airsoft related stores
general 2023-04-30 02:46:36 you'd have to find a way to ignite it so that you can start the reaction
general 2023-04-30 02:46:38 air
general 2023-04-30 02:46:39 i mean
general 2023-04-30 02:46:57 you need something like air to get it to ignite and actually cause that explosion
general 2023-04-30 02:47:04 like if you just pull the trigger in space
general 2023-04-30 02:47:14 yeah i did i sound dumb as fuck
general 2023-04-30 02:47:15 but
general 2023-04-30 02:47:23 if you pull the trigger in space
general 2023-04-30 02:47:29 **what happens**
general 2023-04-30 02:47:46 no??
general 2023-04-30 02:48:08 hang on, gotta look this up

general 2023-04-30 02:48:58 bullet
general 2023-04-30 02:49:52 now i gotta see someone shooting a gun in space
general 2023-04-30 02:50:15 of course the russians tried it first
general 2023-04-30 02:52:37 railguns (if some of the major flaws can be fixed) or coil guns will be in use, maybe if you're breaching a space station yeah

general 2023-05-07 01:38:41 i hate scripting
general 2023-05-07 01:44:32 i need a script that increases player movement speed like pizza tower

general 2023-05-07 01:53:36 shift as well, i want this to be a 'while holding' type of thing

general 2023-05-13 23:39:18 the problem in question <:untroll:837379341868335145>
general 2023-05-13 23:40:30 i was trying to make a whole ass game around a cool momentum system i thought of, but of course i can't script so i had to figure something out
creations-chat 2023-05-13 23:41:35 actually really good so far, keep it up and you'll be able to get a good rank
general 2023-05-13 23:42:09 hey thats the same exact wet floor sign i used in slip and fall
general 2023-05-13 23:43:06 i've considered doing that, it might work
general 2023-05-13 23:43:20 but it'll be **painful**
general 2023-05-13 23:44:04 well its more painful when you have to keep asking something to fix it
general 2023-05-13 23:44:14 1394189 times
general 2023-05-13 23:44:31 i'd rather learn lua then prompt it 100 times
general 2023-05-13 23:44:54 because then i'd be able to get a good result
general 2023-05-13 23:45:18 i don't hate talking to it i just fuckin hate wasting my time when there are other methods that work
general 2023-05-13 23:45:58 i always start the prompts with 'hi i'm developing a roblox game' (yes i say hi to it shut the up)
general 2023-05-13 23:46:09 and then put the question after it
general 2023-05-13 23:50:19 this is the script i use for testing some of the basic movement, and this is the **only** successful one
general 2023-05-13 23:50:30 (yes, it tells me what things do)
general 2023-05-13 23:55:41 i hope you are ready break the skill ceiling
general 2023-05-13 23:56:26 master rank is something else
general 2023-05-13 23:56:57 the skill gap is 20 times bigger then the one between expert designer and any of the other expert ranks
general 2023-05-13 23:57:27

general 2023-05-14 02:01:49 well if its the obvious reason i'm thinking of, they're dumb as shit and are probably an npc
general 2023-05-14 02:01:59 actually, we can figure it out
general 2023-05-14 02:02:08 are they in an anti furry group

general 2023-05-14 02:03:34 yeah thats uh, odd
general 2023-05-14 02:04:29 i know something similar to that, but i haven't been on pc in a while
general 2023-05-14 02:04:56 yeah uh, fun fact: pc is not coded correctly
general 2023-05-14 02:05:01 well
general 2023-05-14 02:05:06 theres no 'correct'
general 2023-05-14 02:05:10 but what i can say is
general 2023-05-14 02:05:14 holy shit, this makes NO SENSE
general 2023-05-14 02:06:52 if you mess with 1 thing, theres you can break a bunch of scripts
general 2023-05-14 02:07:02 something ingame that should not be connected to it at ALL
general 2023-05-14 02:07:11 which makes NO FUCKING SENSE
general 2023-05-14 02:07:52 no the method i know only effects scripts that applies things upon joining

general 2023-05-14 02:24:47 beter
general 2023-05-14 02:24:56 also i might not be replacing the npc dialog system
general 2023-05-14 02:25:14 mostly because i remembered that all the npc kill events rely on it
general 2023-05-14 02:25:24 so
general 2023-05-14 02:26:22 does it stay that way forever?
general 2023-05-14 02:26:26 wait
general 2023-05-14 02:27:11 so its just a denial of service attack

general 2023-05-14 02:33:33 actually
general 2023-05-14 02:34:01 since plane crazy has innovation inc roots (proof in the damn loading screen) it makes a bit of sense in my eyes
general 2023-05-14 02:34:58 or food

general 2023-06-04 01:13:08 i'd say crashing
general 2023-06-04 01:13:20 other then that i blame roblox
general 2023-06-04 01:13:43 every time i've been pissed off using studio is because of a change roblox made or my own stupidity
general 2023-06-04 01:14:06 first off, the new icons
general 2023-06-04 01:14:18 everyone has an opinion on it
general 2023-06-04 01:14:21 i do not like it
general 2023-06-04 01:15:06 i am one for 'clean' UI and it not being a huge eyesore, but adapting to it was an annoyance
general 2023-06-04 01:15:22 **its a pain in the ass when all the icons are the same color**
general 2023-06-04 01:15:58 like yeah completely wonderful can i have the old icons back this is annoying
general 2023-06-04 01:16:11 and this
general 2023-06-04 01:16:13 this.
general 2023-06-04 01:16:16 i hate
general 2023-06-04 01:16:30 i have to go in here and fuck with it every time roblox decides to push it
general 2023-06-04 01:16:40 for the 2nd god damn time
general 2023-06-04 01:17:49 the way roblox messes with my settings is like if you've ever shared a car with someone and they ajust the seat to fit them better which makes your back hurt while driving
general 2023-06-04 01:18:02 its like ajusting the god damn seat over and over
general 2023-06-04 01:18:05 i fucking hate it
general 2023-06-04 01:25:50 ..hmm
general 2023-06-04 01:26:42 nah more like just fucking around with the shifter
general 2023-06-04 01:27:13 your 6 speed manual? now its a 4 speed manual and you gotta scream a racial slur to move up in gears
general 2023-06-04 01:27:39 not even a 4 sspeed
general 2023-06-04 01:27:42 fuck the gearbox

general 2023-06-04 01:28:43 you don't have to
general 2023-06-04 01:29:15 your gas and brake pedals now steer the car
general 2023-06-04 01:29:30 clutch is your wipers
general 2023-06-04 01:29:48 the steering wheel now is your gas and brake
general 2023-06-04 01:29:51 turn left to go forward

general 2023-06-05 00:19:15 up and down, and now left and right
general 2023-06-05 00:22:42 you have no idea how easy this was
general 2023-06-05 00:23:26 the script is only like 7 lines to make the thing move
general 2023-06-05 00:47:50 the reason its so short is that it controls prismatic constraints
general 2023-06-05 00:48:54 like this
general 2023-06-05 00:49:11 it is super simple
general 2023-06-05 00:49:47 only 1 value i need to worry about for each moving bit
general 2023-06-05 00:51:18 its 2 target position values that i have to change
general 2023-06-05 00:52:19 each button interacts with both, basically on off, either 0 or some other random value
general 2023-06-05 00:52:26 no inbetween
general 2023-06-05 00:53:01 i can easily take apart another script to make it more analog but like

general 2023-06-06 19:47:15 **sand gets everywhere**
general 2023-06-06 19:47:53 water is mostly the most 'clean' method

general 2023-06-06 20:13:58 the tower is down too low for the boat to properly get under it
general 2023-06-06 20:14:06 so i just

general 2023-06-14 04:48:32 the one i’ve been developing for..
general 2023-06-14 04:48:37 a while
general 2023-06-14 04:48:39 i forgor
general 2023-06-14 04:48:45 i think its been a month
general 2023-06-14 04:49:16 why are you answering for me i need to 💀
general 2023-06-14 04:49:27 you slip and fall
general 2023-06-14 04:49:34 you also explore but you slip and fall
general 2023-06-14 04:50:12 it used to be a gimmick game, only being the slip and fall element with some hangout shit slapped on for some appeal
general 2023-06-14 04:50:42 i wanted to make ragdolls for the slipping
general 2023-06-14 04:50:57 i actually tried to use the scripts from ragdoll engine which has gone public
general 2023-06-14 04:50:59 however
general 2023-06-14 04:51:04 no luck
general 2023-06-14 04:51:31 my intelligence is far too weak to comprehend that many lines 💀
general 2023-06-14 04:51:47 especially when it looked like a mirror room of text
general 2023-06-14 04:51:57 thats funny because
general 2023-06-14 04:52:03 it does work sometimes
general 2023-06-14 04:52:07 **sometimes**
general 2023-06-14 04:53:00 i’ve tried scripting using chatgpt and ended up becoming so tired of prompting it again and again that i began learning to script myself 💀💀
general 2023-06-14 04:53:20 it can code the simple things
general 2023-06-14 04:53:34 and thats all i was able to get working
general 2023-06-14 04:54:30 but being lazy i overcomplicated the problem and took a detour so bad i ended up at my destination a bit smarter
general 2023-06-14 04:55:18 instead of learning to script using funky ai tech wizard bullshit i learned to code myself because it failed almost every prompt i gave it 💀
general 2023-06-14 04:55:30 yeah
general 2023-06-14 04:55:45 turns out you need to know how to code in the first place
general 2023-06-14 04:56:03 the ai just does a big chunk of it and after that you gotta iron it out
general 2023-06-14 04:56:54 its not always perfect either
general 2023-06-14 04:57:04 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/497142796961054721/1117854163431346196/brick_magic.mp4 and sometimes you end up with some game breaking bugs
general 2023-06-14 04:58:28 it’s incredibly annoying
general 2023-06-14 04:58:30 but
general 2023-06-14 04:58:37 sometimes its very funny
general 2023-06-14 04:59:35 giving me the opportunity to create endless bricks, this was later solved via a shopping cart and an item giver with a proximity thing
general 2023-06-14 04:59:43 in a basement
general 2023-06-14 05:00:26 an ocean of brick

general 2023-06-14 05:08:27 being in creations chat turns you into a new yorker on bath salts
general 2023-06-14 05:08:44 like 5 minutes and the rot consumes
general 2023-06-14 05:10:26 you are more likely to get bitten by a new yorker then a shark

general 2023-06-20 17:42:42 i modified the brick, now i can make walls like this and break them

general 2023-06-20 17:43:23 that on the other hand
general 2023-06-20 17:43:25 i have no idea
general 2023-06-20 17:43:36 i believe its a.. uh
general 2023-06-20 17:43:46 this
general 2023-06-20 17:43:58 don't see it? its an invisible floor
general 2023-06-20 17:44:10 right there
general 2023-06-20 17:44:31 this is for the boats to travel along, and it just so happens that the bricks collide with it
general 2023-06-20 17:45:19 you wouldn't know that though because if you tried to stand on it you would fall to your death
general 2023-06-20 17:47:06 a script and a collision group
general 2023-06-20 17:47:45 it don't work like that
general 2023-06-20 17:47:58 they just go through
general 2023-06-20 17:48:17 now there is something funny
general 2023-06-20 17:48:44 whenever a player 'slips' they for some reason gain the ability to collide with this invisible floor
general 2023-06-20 17:49:16 once they regain control though that effect is gone and they fall
general 2023-06-20 17:49:18 yeah gone
general 2023-06-20 17:49:29 no idea why
general 2023-06-20 17:50:16 i don't care though because you will 99% of the time regain control during your unfortunate descent
general 2023-06-20 17:50:34 the exception is this door
general 2023-06-20 17:50:39 the <:trollface:775024642104229898> door

general 2023-06-20 17:51:26 i uh
general 2023-06-20 17:51:33 i have no idea how it even works
general 2023-06-20 17:51:53 the limbs aren't frozen, you still have a movement animation
general 2023-06-20 17:52:01 last one before you get launched
general 2023-06-20 17:52:23 if you ran into the puddle you would still be in that running animation
general 2023-06-20 17:52:55 like this, this isn not a ragdoll this is just me running in the air

general 2023-06-30 05:06:06 the known true fix is to make a whole new desktop just to play roblox

general 2023-06-30 05:07:25 its not worth it
general 2023-06-30 05:07:49 and likely you won’t be able to do it, but i’ll explain it anyways
general 2023-06-30 05:08:29 use steam link to remote into a second computer (assuming roblox opens) and play it that way
general 2023-06-30 05:08:39 yeah
general 2023-06-30 05:08:49 i thought you’d say that
general 2023-06-30 05:09:06 anyways if you want to play you gotta make a new user and desktop
general 2023-06-30 05:09:36 until they unfuck their shit thats the easiest way if nothing else works
general 2023-06-30 05:11:36 whar

general 2023-07-10 07:39:16 uuh
general 2023-07-10 07:39:32 debate is a funny term
general 2023-07-10 07:42:35 strength in numbers because their all frauds who want the benefits ('you're transphobic' card) without making the effort or dumbasses who thing the fraudsters are actually legit
general 2023-07-10 07:44:21 they all are fragile because their pride made them so weak
general 2023-07-10 07:44:34 mentally and physically
general 2023-07-10 07:45:14 every time i met a trans person irl they had the integrity of a weakling or skeleton
general 2023-07-10 07:46:04 because believe it or not, if you aren't suppose to have estrogen in you, that means it'll fuck you up
general 2023-07-10 07:46:41 female hormones
general 2023-07-10 07:47:49 i am becoming gammarad
general 2023-07-10 07:48:28 i met one in class and some weirdo guy who was uh..
general 2023-07-10 07:48:30 i forgor
general 2023-07-10 07:48:43 too many colors on that guy's gender flag or whatever the fuck its called
general 2023-07-10 07:48:45 so and so ace
general 2023-07-10 07:48:48 i think
general 2023-07-10 07:49:20 these guys were in a tech class of mine, 2 of them
general 2023-07-10 07:50:55 yeah this was a robotics class, the ace guy recommended  we make a *sylveon animatronic* for one of the projects we'll make as a group since we chose our projects
general 2023-07-10 07:51:06 that fucker had an aura
general 2023-07-10 07:51:10 **a bad one**]
general 2023-07-10 07:51:28 something something pokemon
general 2023-07-10 07:51:38 the other guy wore a dress for a presentation
general 2023-07-10 07:51:44 'nothing bad'
general 2023-07-10 07:51:50 but he was a peice of shit and a hoarder
general 2023-07-10 07:52:17 why yes how did you know? oh wait, I KNOW
general 2023-07-10 07:52:55 yeah its almost like steriotypes make themselves
general 2023-07-10 07:53:10 also for referance, this is PA, so take everything with a grain of salt
general 2023-07-10 07:54:04 anyone here who goes by some wacky gender is either a chicken shit coward or a threat to society (or both), ok thats wrong some were actually decent people
general 2023-07-10 07:56:08 that trans guy got told to 'find god' by one of the dipshit truck guys (actually really funny guy but he was dumb as fuck) and told teach, dude got sent to a room or something
general 2023-07-10 07:57:09 also took like 5 monitors from the other computers while we were doing project work and refused to give us any, so we stole like 2 or something
general 2023-07-10 07:57:43 5 plus the 1 they already had
general 2023-07-10 07:57:59 no idea
general 2023-07-10 07:58:09 yeah
general 2023-07-10 07:58:15 we didn't like that asshole
general 2023-07-10 07:59:52 also whenever i looked them in the eyes their gaze did not seem human at all
general 2023-07-10 08:00:13 always something **off** about it
general 2023-07-10 08:01:06 and that other guy with a very strong interest with pokemon, he was basically an outcast and for good fucking reason
general 2023-07-10 08:01:34 the fucker was a creep and almost everyone avoided being near him
general 2023-07-10 08:02:01 trans guy and someone else i forgor who
general 2023-07-10 08:02:11 actually i think he avoided him too
general 2023-07-10 08:02:42 that or the guy was just like so out of touch he just stood away from everyone
general 2023-07-10 08:02:52 oh wait i know
general 2023-07-10 08:02:57 the uh
general 2023-07-10 08:03:20 the guy
general 2023-07-10 08:04:20 he had several screws loose (super sped) so he didn't know any better, poor guy
general 2023-07-10 08:05:35 also when the ace guy realized he can't make a slyveon animatronic with the lack of parts in our shop needed for the project, and in about 7 months, he did something else
general 2023-07-10 08:05:46 he made a 3d printed hand
general 2023-07-10 08:05:59 with servos btw
general 2023-07-10 08:06:19 likely because the fucker would never see the warm embrace of any human being ever again
general 2023-07-10 08:06:39 a creep from school
general 2023-07-10 08:07:25 that guy was an actual threat to society though 💀
general 2023-07-10 08:07:35 when i said before that he had an aura, i mean it
general 2023-07-10 08:07:55 just looking at him told you everything
general 2023-07-10 08:08:11 and listening to what he said supported it like steel
general 2023-07-10 08:09:01 no photos, because i wouldn't want to see his face in my photos
general 2023-07-10 08:09:04 anyways uh
general 2023-07-10 08:09:54 beard, long hair of sorts thats curlly with a fucked up manbun, timid stance, what else..
general 2023-07-10 08:10:10 fanny pack, and sometimes a purse
general 2023-07-10 08:10:25 always wore hoodies
general 2023-07-10 08:10:52 i think the guy wore a shirt instead once because it was unbearably hot
general 2023-07-10 08:11:04 and jeans
general 2023-07-10 08:11:21 not torn, so some respect there

general 2023-07-10 08:15:11 like he downloaded opera gx on the school computers
general 2023-07-10 08:16:09 then again some of us decided to download a streaming service and played fortnite, lan party style, fucked shit up too those guys were good
general 2023-07-10 08:16:56 the computers didn't have anything in the way of blockers so you could just install shit
general 2023-07-10 08:17:18 2 guys installed roblox for shits and giggles
general 2023-07-10 08:17:31 played a bit and cleaned the evidence
general 2023-07-10 08:18:21 because the fucker was apart of the gx cult
general 2023-07-10 08:18:31 name i just came up with on the spot
general 2023-07-10 08:18:48 he had it on his phone too
