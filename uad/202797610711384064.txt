plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:23:00 should I give this bomber a turret in the back with motor 2? I fell like it will be able to take down fighters if I can aim properly(the magic of motors 2)
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:23:20 cilinder
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:23:31 I was going to build a nuke at first
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:23:50 oh yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:23:53 I forgot about that
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:24:09 but tbh its hard to control any plane without key bindings
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:24:13 so im not losing much
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:26:44 this might work
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:26:48 that was easy
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:48:13 proven. With motors 2 turrets on planes are actually usefull
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:48:49 motors 2 are so usefull i can see so many things being possible
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:49:29 you can aim
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:52:54 No blue indicator bug. It happens when I use a lot of blocks before I plane any wing. If I load the bug goes away. Pls fix this one its rly annoying and sometimes I dont want to use save slots just to solve the bug
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:53:16 <@!217336009455566848> do you know about this bug?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:54:24 just saying its quite an annoying bug what has been in the game for years
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:55:36 I already reloaded
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:55:40 but if that solves it nice
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:58:06 look at this
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:58:10 oh I found a way to make counter rotating props without space between
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:58:24 can this power a plane?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:58:47 Idk
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 14:59:04 for real

plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:01:47 still no answer, CAN I USE PROPELLOR BLADES AND MOTORS TO MOVE A PLANE?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:02:00 OK TY
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:02:14 it would be fine to build props with motors 2
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:02:29 so you have to move your mouse around the screen to move
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:02:33 interesting gameplay

plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:10:04 sweptback wings or normal?
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 19:51:11 wait, tnt doesnt take damage at all from guns or rockets? Why is that? you can just make a tank out of tnt blocks and it cant be destroyed. oh and btw 7block beams also dont take dmg from rockets
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 19:54:45 "Explosives explode with other explosives. So, making a tank of explosives and just having a ball of TNT roll and blow you up is bad. " ok nice I didnt know that
plane-crazy 2019-09-15 19:55:04 "7 block beams take damage from rockets, just very randomly." From my experience my tank side turret is imune to rockets
creations-chat 2019-09-15 20:02:38 Small U-boat.  Can reach the bottom of the ocean
creations-chat 2019-09-15 20:02:59

bug-reports 2019-09-18 19:06:40 not sure if this is a bug but motors 2 cant stay on target. if I try to build a tank with motors 2 controlling the cannon it just dances around without me moving my mouse
bug-reports 2019-09-18 19:06:53 I just cant aim with those
bug-reports 2019-09-18 19:08:07 why cant motors just ignore weight
bug-reports 2019-09-18 19:08:34 I expected motors 2 to be usefull
bug-reports 2019-09-18 19:08:43 but I cant build nothing with them
bug-reports 2019-09-18 19:09:23 I will keep my tanks guns on qe,xz until those actually work
bug-reports 2019-09-18 19:09:30 what a waste
bug-reports 2019-09-18 19:11:26 btw
bug-reports 2019-09-18 19:11:41 how do you stop regular motors from moving with weight?
bug-reports 2019-09-18 19:11:53 does it have anything to do with max torque?
bug-reports 2019-09-18 19:14:07 nvm its lock
bug-reports 2019-09-18 19:14:09 I forgot

plane-crazy 2019-09-29 18:00:23 are these turrets good looking?
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 18:01:36 Its hard to fit a 3*3cannon(in half blocks so 2*2, 3*3 in practice)
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 18:01:44 oh this thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 18:01:47 I meant *
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 18:01:55 what I was saying
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 18:02:01 is that the cannon is too big
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 18:02:04 for a small turret
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 18:05:07 when it comes to taking rockets
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 18:05:11 7 block beams
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 18:05:14 are more than 1805991738096810926
plane-crazy 2019-09-29 18:05:18 they just dont die

creations-chat 2019-10-07 18:02:12 but this guy is just here calling builds bad
creations-chat 2019-10-07 18:04:11 my tower looks better
help 2019-10-17 17:41:00 Are cutter blocks useless or is there some trick to make them deal real damage?
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 20:58:50 Does this tank turret look good?
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 20:59:01 I made it to be good not to be pretty but still I think its cool
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 20:59:24 the tank will be big
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 21:00:00 The tank will be the replacement for this one
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 21:00:17 similar but a lit bit longer
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 18:31:28 I just build a 1300 block build just for it to crash when I spawn. I dont know it if the motors 2 or not but its cool to not be able to build because everything bugs if you dont build a 100block tnt car
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 18:33:09 ok its the motors 2 I already tested, you cant build with those it seems
help 2019-10-27 20:30:39 does anyone know what maxtorque does?
help 2019-10-27 20:32:42 man for real cmon
help 2019-10-27 20:34:09 joe who
the-dump 2019-10-27 20:40:35 
help 2019-11-05 20:39:22 rickje saying we can use suggestions chat but no one will give me a rank to use it
help 2019-11-05 20:39:41 I've tried several times but nothing
creations-chat 2019-11-05 20:47:16 Requesting Shipwright II
creations-chat 2019-11-05 20:48:14 Here is the block count. I just want to use suggestions channel pls give me a rank
creations-chat 2019-11-05 20:48:46 Oh there's a surprise for submarines
creations-chat 2019-11-05 20:50:28 Another surprise. tnt cannons
help 2019-11-13 20:10:16 Is there anyway you can explosions work at high speed
help 2019-11-13 20:10:27 tnt takes a while to update its position it seems
help 2019-11-13 20:11:00 I cant use bombs or rockets with "on impact" on because they explode where they were not where they are
help 2019-11-13 20:12:06 I bomb people and they just dont take damage thats so nice
help 2019-11-13 20:12:54 I've tried to make tnt like pudate its position with an archored block set to the same key as the explosion but nothing xD
help 2019-11-13 20:16:56 only 7 block beams
help 2019-11-13 20:17:14 but I thihnk the developers should actually try to fix the tnt thing
help 2019-11-13 20:17:18 it really hurts the game
help 2019-11-13 20:18:11 look the issue is the explosion not being on the same spot as the tnt
help 2019-11-13 20:18:17 you can work around that
help 2019-11-13 20:19:02 ok just imagine
help 2019-11-13 20:19:09 instead of the explosion being on the tnt
help 2019-11-13 20:19:17 it is teleported to the tnt when it explodes
help 2019-11-13 20:19:23 you can make it like freeze into the air
help 2019-11-13 20:20:08 im not saying its that easy
help 2019-11-13 20:20:37 you can make it a asset itself
help 2019-11-13 20:21:50 even if the explosion is inside the tnt you can teleport it to the tnt
help 2019-11-13 20:21:56 I mean I cant be that sure
help 2019-11-13 20:21:59 you can do it on unity
help 2019-11-13 20:22:22 yes but you only need coordinates
help 2019-11-13 20:22:29 and the teleport command I supose
help 2019-11-13 20:23:12 isnt that how funtions work?
help 2019-11-13 20:23:20 if(someone) calls it
help 2019-11-13 20:23:25 something*
help 2019-11-13 20:23:48 ok look at it this way
help 2019-11-13 20:23:52 it detects the colision
help 2019-11-13 20:23:56 thats all you need
help 2019-11-13 20:24:14 after it detects the colision you can make anyway happen after it
help 2019-11-13 20:24:26 you can make a flying orange appear when it colides
help 2019-11-13 20:24:49 yes I know it would kind of increase lag
help 2019-11-13 20:25:03 but explosions are rare
help 2019-11-13 20:26:33 this is the only game explosions have this problem
help 2019-11-13 20:26:36 I can believe that
help 2019-11-13 20:26:41 but it doesnt make sense then
help 2019-11-13 20:28:08 so you're saying other games use like the roblox default explosive system
help 2019-11-13 20:28:11 if I got it right
help 2019-11-13 20:29:03 ok I wont be arguing about the specifics of how you make them work
help 2019-11-13 20:29:04 but look
help 2019-11-13 20:29:09 roblox has tons of games
help 2019-11-13 20:29:12 with explosions
help 2019-11-13 20:29:15 fasts bullter
help 2019-11-13 20:29:21 some very high quality
help 2019-11-13 20:29:31 and plane crazy is the one that cant have the lag
help 2019-11-13 20:29:37 or it just ruins the gameplay
help 2019-11-13 20:29:42 you cant make cutter cannons
help 2019-11-13 20:29:47 you cant make bombs
help 2019-11-13 20:30:13 in the end
help 2019-11-13 20:30:16 what can I build
help 2019-11-13 20:30:22 without being affected by lag
help 2019-11-13 20:30:30 I shoot cutters simple
help 2019-11-13 20:30:36 like a bullet
help 2019-11-13 20:30:51 the new ones dont lag as much
help 2019-11-13 20:30:59 but when it is shot the lag goes away
help 2019-11-13 20:31:44 well I need loose parts
help 2019-11-13 20:31:52 bullets are loose parts
help 2019-11-13 20:31:56 cant work around that
help 2019-11-13 20:32:23 ok I know nothing will work
help 2019-11-13 20:32:25 I had a build
help 2019-11-13 20:32:27 like 50 blocks
help 2019-11-13 20:32:31 it was just a cannon
help 2019-11-13 20:32:36 that had 3 cutter bullets
help 2019-11-13 20:32:43 flying with an anchored block
help 2019-11-13 20:32:44 no motors
help 2019-11-13 20:32:56 I got someone to stand in front of it
help 2019-11-13 20:33:01 only 1 time it dealt damage
help 2019-11-13 20:33:46 cutters were meant for rams too
help 2019-11-13 20:33:59 also cutter spiners work by lagging inside your vehicle
help 2019-11-13 20:34:05 otherside they dont do much
help 2019-11-13 20:34:32 This design cuts my 1500 block tank in hald in 1 seconds
help 2019-11-13 20:34:34 wait
help 2019-11-13 20:34:50 here it is
help 2019-11-13 20:34:58 
help 2019-11-13 20:35:05 the suspensions cause the lag you need
help 2019-11-13 20:35:12 to lag inside my vehicle
help 2019-11-13 20:35:16 and just cut everything
help 2019-11-13 20:36:06 it doesnt do much
help 2019-11-13 20:36:11 unless you spin it really fast
help 2019-11-13 20:36:17 but anyway
help 2019-11-13 20:36:19 the point is
help 2019-11-13 20:36:27 cutters dont need to hit multiple times to cut
help 2019-11-13 20:36:33 they shouldnt*
help 2019-11-13 20:36:39 what happends with cutters spinners
help 2019-11-13 20:36:45 is that you hit so many times
help 2019-11-13 20:36:48 It cuts
help 2019-11-13 20:36:54 but if you just ram into someone
help 2019-11-13 20:36:58 high speed
help 2019-11-13 20:37:00 it doesnt work
help 2019-11-13 20:37:07 even fast cars
help 2019-11-13 20:37:11 im not saying a bullet
help 2019-11-13 20:37:20 even fast cars someone dont do anything with their cutters
help 2019-11-13 20:38:15 but what was I talking about?
help 2019-11-13 20:38:20 oh yes
help 2019-11-13 20:38:25 how lag just ruins the game
help 2019-11-13 20:38:34 cutters and another example
help 2019-11-13 20:38:36 are*
help 2019-11-13 20:39:14 You can destroy this thing (in 1 second) if you lag inside me with cutters
help 2019-11-13 20:39:15 but sometimes they dont do anything
help 2019-11-13 20:39:17 so yeah not cool
help 2019-11-13 20:39:56 well I guess I'll just have to live with it
help 2019-11-13 20:40:04 but its sad cause i really like this game
help 2019-11-13 20:40:17 and lag always ruing my builds
help 2019-11-13 20:40:51 oh I cant make rockets guided with motors 2 because they freeze into the air when they are not connected to the main pilot seat
help 2019-11-13 20:40:53 thats another one
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:42:13 Motors 2 in action
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:42:22 no anchored blocks
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:42:32 I mean
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:42:41 motors 2 are anchored blocks it sems
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:42:50 simple
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:43:06 if a motor 2 is not connected to your pilot seat
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:43:14 it does that
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:43:38 unless the motor 2 is loose( if you destroy the 7 block beam it falls)
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:46:24 Before motor 2
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:46:45 After motor 2
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:52:57 what?
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:53:00 thats wrong with it
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:53:08 its a normal tank
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:53:56 I only shoot oncer
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:54:02 the bombs are inside the cannon
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:54:23 ~the guns are on the sides of the mantlet so they dont hit the rockets and destroy them
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:54:26 for firepower
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:54:29 to kill people
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:54:42 yes
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:55:14 If It was built for non pvp guns wouldnt make sense
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 18:55:21 they are not pretty in any way
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 19:01:05 does this look good? (its unpainted)
plane-crazy 2019-11-14 19:06:47 lol
bug-reports 2019-11-29 20:30:48 So some reason motos and disconnectors only work when the anchored block is off
bug-reports 2019-11-29 20:31:17 its a 1500 block build I dont know if it has anything to do with that
bug-reports 2019-11-29 20:31:22 but it worked before this update
bug-reports 2019-11-29 20:34:00 btw on my server there is a guy with a battleship that gets lauched into the sky when he spawns(he uses motors 2)

help 2020-02-26 14:21:48 if someone builds a car that lags a lot so they can go inside me with cutters, because lag stops the collision
help 2020-02-26 14:22:03 is that reportable?
help 2020-02-26 14:39:20 that depends
help 2020-02-26 14:39:44 there is the weight and the distance to the rotor factors

help 2020-03-01 15:15:19 <@!314383347214319616> Requesting terrain specialist [II]
help 2020-03-01 15:15:25 
creations-chat 2020-03-01 15:28:38 Not the best looking tank, but has a lot to it. The cannon has rockets and guns but is also a tnt cannon ( shoots 8 tnt balls), the black and blue thing is used to aim(can be ajusted for distance). On top of the turrer there are also 2 "MGs" (1 gun 2 fireworks each) controled by motors 2. The grey camera is used to look up and enables me to shoot up. The turrer uses 1 layer of tnt armor(for some reason tnt can only be destroyed by tnt). The entire build uses only 1006 block which is nice since I built it for pvp.
creations-chat 2020-03-01 15:31:45 for some reason I wrote turrer instead of turret, also the camera is used to look around not just up.

help 2020-04-07 19:01:56 is there any reward for getting the egg?

help 2020-06-27 02:45:16 What is the WaterJet suposed to do? It is a pvp weapon that doesnt hurt anyone
plane-crazy 2020-12-23 18:12:41 are there new items? ones that werent in the last winter update?
general 2022-03-13 02:24:27 Wow, I see a few experienced players fighting to make the game boring for every person ever that joins it. Being able to build even crazier stuff without folding isn't worth killing the game. You can be sure no one(except this 0.1%) joins a game that looks empty and stays to make use of the increased space.
