general 2022-12-20 06:30:39 one block in pc is .7 meters
general 2022-12-20 06:30:40 so
general 2022-12-20 06:30:46 for example
general 2022-12-20 06:30:58 if an aircraft is 20 meters long
general 2022-12-20 06:31:04 divide 20 by .7
general 2022-12-20 06:31:13 and thats how many blocks long it should be in-game
general 2022-12-20 06:31:22 you can use that for other dimensions
general 2022-12-20 06:31:40 nah other people figured it out

creations-chat 2022-12-24 21:19:47 youre goign to have to use wing panels or parachutes as those are the only sources of drag in the game that would give your desired effect
you could probably motorlock a crap ton of wing panels into some bomb blocks or just shove a parachute on them
help 2022-12-24 21:35:38 only solution i see is making the control surface smaller by bringing the motor 2 out further away from the cover its getting stuck on

help 2022-12-27 07:02:40 idk if thats the case cause i cant see everything
help 2022-12-27 07:02:48 but it incase it is there you go
help 2022-12-27 21:45:05 1. dont fill ur wings with wing panels, in other words fill them with disconnectors or trapdoors instead of wing panels(keep delta wing panels though)
2. add a lot more weight(ballast blocks at max weight work well)
3. turn down speed and/or max angle on motor 2s that are being used for elevators
help 2022-12-27 21:47:38 np, also forgot to mention this: if you remove a lot of wing panels and ur plane gets too wobbly or uncontrollable, add some back until it flies as you want it to

creations-chat 2023-07-13 22:25:39 If it gets censored then add a bunch of spaces and then a random letter. Then change the size of the text so that you can only see the decal/emoji
