plane-crazy 2021-01-04 17:29:02 My helicopter takes off fine going directly up without any deviations but when i make it go front it moves front then randomly jerks back
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 17:29:07 any solution to this??
general 2021-01-30 13:51:26 hi
general 2021-01-30 13:51:29 wait uh
general 2021-01-30 13:51:42 am i not supposed to be nicked?
general 2021-01-30 13:51:46 with my roblox account
general 2021-01-30 13:51:54 eh
general 2021-01-30 13:52:03 also where can i find help for my builds?
general 2021-01-30 13:52:20 ty
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:52:40 im tryna make a c-17
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:54:02 when i made the skeletal body without the wing panels etc, it folded and unfolded properly but the moment i added wing panels and motor locked them to be flush with the wing blocks my plane just started flying everywhere when i turned off the anchor block
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:54:11 i realized that adding weight made it get less freaky
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:54:22 but it also slowed my plane down
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:54:30 so wanted to know if their's anything else i can try?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:54:32 its done
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:54:35 the body is done
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:55:23 which ones though
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:55:32 i have motor2 which i use for the unfolding
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:55:35 which was working fine
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:55:42 it only started getting crazy
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:56:03 after i made the wing flaps moveable
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:56:12 to move left and right
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:57:12 increasing the planes weight seems to be making it less crazy
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:57:29 but i doubt ill be able to make it leave the ground with the amount of ballasant blocks im using
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 13:57:59 and ive seen other people with bigger c-17s which worked fine and fast
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:10:04 this is my plane b4 unfolding

plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:10:23 how do i get it?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:10:41 so i cant get help until i reach level 3?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:10:51 wack :\
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:11:05 aight
general 2021-01-30 14:11:18 i need
general 2021-01-30 14:11:21 to get level 3 mee6
general 2021-01-30 14:11:23 so hi
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:17:15 whats the best way to make ailerons not glitch out in big planes?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:17:32 whats the best way to make ailerons in general?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:17:46 so how do i make my plane roll?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:18:12 how wil they tilt though?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:18:43 oh u mean control panels
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:18:49 mb i read them as wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:18:53 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:19:08 will control panels work on big planes too?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:19:54 oh like keep propellers on wings to make them roll?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:20:12 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:20:33 how do i make it fit in with the design? instead of just having a rocket stickking out of the wing?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:20:41 can i motorlock them into a block somehow?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:21:02 oh
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:21:04 rip
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:21:08 aight thanks
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:21:29 another question
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:21:40 what do u use to make retractable landing gears?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:21:45 like not the default ones
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:21:57 not the bending part
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:22:12 like how do i make the cover
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:22:22 to cover the landing gears after they are retracted in
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:22:24 ye
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:22:52 im working on a c-17 rn
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:23:01 can i dm u?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 14:23:08 aight 1 sec
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:21:51 wuts the best rocket to use in planes?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:21:55 super rocket?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:26:15 aight ty
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:27:56 i mainly want power
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:27:58 ty
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:32:34 if i was to increase the torque on my motor 2 which i use for my ailerons would that decrease the wobbling?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:33:53 so will they never be fixed or is it just upcoming?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:34:31 wait were they always broken or did the recent update mess it up?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:35:10 thats a lot of pink <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:35:26 aight
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:36:14 O.O
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 15:37:15 or they're under government hunting restrictions which is even worse
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 16:56:59 how do the ailerons work in this?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 18:15:38 how do i stop my creation from freaking out after unfolding?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 18:16:14 how do i turn on lock in motor 2?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 18:16:30 if i do 180 it keeps going in wrong direction though
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 18:16:36 so i put it at 179.9
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 18:16:53 then what do u mean by this?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 18:17:09 im using motor 2 but it still freaks out
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 18:17:19 wait how will it move if its locked?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 18:17:34 i dont understand
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 18:17:44 oh...
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 18:17:48 ye lol mines at 1000
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 18:18:08 what should the settnig be for motor 1?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 18:18:21 should powered be on?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 18:18:42 and cameras right?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 18:18:46 to connect the 2 parts

plane-crazy 2021-01-30 18:47:43 wut do i do?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 19:14:52 this is my plane when it is folded
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 19:15:07 it unfolds pretty neatly now
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 19:15:15 but
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 19:15:22 when i try to use move it with rockets
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 19:16:00 ye...

the-dump 2021-02-05 17:23:08 <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:23:11 lesson learnt
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:23:25 <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:27:11 i tried making it realistic
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:27:41 which made it have shit maneuverability
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:27:42 so said fuck it
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:27:55 and went for more maneuverability than realism
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:28:09 it works fine looks shit <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:28:24 motro lock what in what?
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:28:35 i like your funny words magic man
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:28:54 yall speaking chinese or something tf
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:29:08 im new to motorlockings
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:29:12 lol
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:29:26 did
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:30:20 could u elaborate??
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:30:42 yes ik how that works ree
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:30:58 im tlaking about all this
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:31:17 oh
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:31:28 so u mean make it in multiple layers
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:31:33 and then motor lock them
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:31:34 hmm
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:31:38 aight ill try that ty
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:31:48 wait but wont they collide?
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:32:01 like if a moving part has a solid piece motor locked into it
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:32:06 or no?
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:33:02 but control surfaces dont have much effect though
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:33:27 then again i lose the realism
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:33:31 wait
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:33:39 do multiple control surfaces on top of each other
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:33:44 have more effect than one?
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:34:17 like multiple control surfaces motor locked together will be more effective than just one?
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:35:07 oh...
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:35:30 that practically shouldnt work but oh well
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:36:28 what exactly does multiple wing panels motor locked together do?
the-dump 2021-02-05 17:36:33 does it just make it more heavier?
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 17:57:54 poor kid deleted his pic from <#384025409945337856> after he got spam downvoted <:elon:637632355636346880>
