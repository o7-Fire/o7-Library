The Tale of M8 (491979146629611523)
creations-chat 2020-11-19 21:25:13 Got like 10 downvotes on my A-10 and 4 upvotes on it and ingame i was told that it looks dope
creations-chat 2020-11-19 21:26:59 That is understandable
creations-chat 2020-11-19 21:29:21 guess ill just send the mig-23 and not upvote this time
creations-chat 2020-11-19 21:32:32 i wont self upvote this time
creations-chat 2020-11-19 21:34:07 wait my mig-23 is shitty?
creations-chat 2020-11-19 21:36:06 > <@!491979146629611523> in my opinion, yes, and for many of the same reasons why i downvote other planes
<@!489910972946055172> breh. welp i respect your opinion
creations-chat 2020-11-19 21:38:31 im only trying to be nice i dont find a reason to start a dumb keyboard warriors fight over some blocks

creations-chat 2020-11-19 21:54:14 i like how the moderators are decorated like North korean generals and trying to enforce law
creations-chat 2020-11-19 21:56:31 > its vildebeest!!!!
<@!489910972946055172> Just like this
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:12:56 You all really have high expectations for builds
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:14:28 > <@!491979146629611523>  no not really its jus that urs is jus....not the best to b nice lol
<@!755602284615958649> Does that mean that my build sucks or?
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:17:55 > <@!491979146629611523>  nah it jus means is not the best I’ve seen worse so dont worry 👍
<@!755602284615958649> nah its weird cause i saw builds that were kinda bad with lots of upvotes and i was confused
general 2020-11-22 09:26:49 https://tenor.com/view/discord-epstein-log-off-logging-off-log-gif-18779246
creations-chat 2020-11-23 17:20:48 im so confused about creations: how did my mig-23 get only 16 upvotes and my I-16 got 26
creations-chat 2020-11-23 17:23:44 That looks complex for my little brain
creations-chat 2020-12-01 14:31:53 Im surprised how the server liked my YF-23 lol
creations-chat 2020-12-12 12:24:17 cause if it wasnt it wouldnt work. i could make the turret look like it was the real one but if i did that i would sacrifice the ability to move it up and down and i made it to do minigames with my friends where we just shoot our tanks.
creations-chat 2020-12-12 12:28:18 yea thx. i spent around 4 hours to try and find a solution but it would look worse and the turret would just glitch out which ruins the whole point of a tank. And i make all of my builds for minigames.
creations-chat 2020-12-12 13:02:38 what vip 2?

creations-chat 2020-12-18 17:15:17 are snow pipes like a thing in the game?
creations-chat 2020-12-18 17:17:48 i dont have them. Are they old items or just smoke pipes?
creations-chat 2020-12-18 17:20:14 ok
creations-chat 2021-10-14 18:59:51 can i get some feedback on my mig-23? its in creations
creations-chat 2021-10-14 19:09:13 this is the closest i got to the blueprints. and i tried thicker wings and they look awful on a realistic sized mig-23. and the swing-wing mechanism wouldnt work
creations-chat 2021-10-14 19:17:26 that is a good idea but sweeping the wings more in the back isnt really possible because of the mechanism. its a very old build so my motor locking skills were still kinda bad
creations-chat 2021-10-14 19:29:27 ill probably use piston motor lock then so i can lower just a bit to slide the wings smoother
creations-chat 2021-10-22 11:06:30 i remade the mig-23 adding second picture after cooldown
creations-chat 2021-10-22 11:08:55 the criticise i got is that proportions werent right so i fixed the intakes thickness of wings and overall dimensions of the plane. Ill put the camo soon too
creations-chat 2021-10-22 11:11:13 you can give feedback on it
creations-chat 2021-11-17 20:10:42 the door to the unfunny universe
creations-chat 2021-11-17 20:13:50 act like it 😚

creations-chat 2021-11-17 20:22:00 rate my build please😫
creations-chat 2021-11-17 20:25:41 <@!719168864705052802>  can we build together? 👉 👈 😳
general 2021-11-17 20:37:42 <@!719168864705052802>  what's the deal with this guy amirit'e🚶
general 2021-11-17 20:40:19 if you cant handle me at my worst 😈  you dont deserve me at my best 💯 🏆
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:18:45 the A-10 is obsolete its only used against insurgents not tanks. Maybe it can kill some tanks with thin armour from the top. And its very slow so its easy to shoot down
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:24:51 The retirement is already coming in form of the F-35. The us air force rather prefers a high altitude infantry support aircraft instead of a low altitude one. And most of the times it has been used against people not tanks that would mostly have anti aircraft guns.
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:30:55 the F-35 barely entered service in 2015 and the C version in 2019 and it was said that the airforce was planning to retire the A-10s starting with 2022
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:34:00 oh yea the F-35 is prohibited in flying during storms or near them cause of that
general 2021-11-18 17:22:11 <@!719168864705052802>  how well do your planes perform?
general 2021-11-18 17:22:15 cause they do look good
general 2021-11-18 17:22:24 but performance is sometimes sacrificed for looks a lot
general 2021-11-18 17:24:17 yes
general 2021-11-18 17:24:21 thats the real question
general 2021-11-18 17:25:17 so does that mean they are shit in pvp
general 2021-11-18 17:25:43 thats a poor excuse for underperforming planes
