bot-central 2020-02-28 04:03:40 &suggest Add a engine block it will increase the range of the speed and power of things like wheels propellers jet engines and motors. The bigger the size the engine the more range of power it lets you choose but they will take up a lot of space. if damage the motors and wheels will decrease in power.
bot-central 2020-06-14 22:59:28 &suggest The rope block
Building
The rope block is a block were it creates a rope between 2 rope blocks that have the same letter or number ( you can change the number or letter with the config tool ) it will have the same options as the normal rope
bot-central 2020-06-14 23:22:53 :/
bot-central 2020-06-14 23:24:27 the normal rope is only 2 block tall very hard to use it when your decorating
