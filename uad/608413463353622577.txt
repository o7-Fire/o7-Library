GET THE GODDAMN PITCHFORKS BOYS
creations-chat 2020-12-04 19:26:58 it isnt round first of all

its also kind of flat

The landing gear dosent make much sense

The dome around the cockpit is not circular either

The propellors on the end should be hidden

Paint job is lazy

It is under detailed in general

Happy?

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 21:57:05 its for big things like ships
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 21:57:19 motor locking is to make all the blocks rick didnt add
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 21:57:33 i trust his word that it is not a tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 21:58:16 so to create all the blocks rick didnt add?
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 21:58:22 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 21:58:35 you creat new blocks by connecting old blocks

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 22:07:48 im not completely sure what yyou mean by that but what I use motor lock for is to add more detail to smaller areas
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 22:08:13 a good example would be the checkered windows of the cockpit on my pe 8
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 22:08:23 it is impossible without motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 22:16:31 an f4 is a good choice
