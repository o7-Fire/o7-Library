help 2021-08-29 21:12:57 extra width to acount for the blocks sorounding the thrusterse
help 2021-08-29 21:40:10 likley its the motors deciding that they are going to spin the main helicopter instead of the rotors my only sugestion would be to make it heavier in the parts you dont want to spin
help 2021-08-29 21:40:45 might not work becuase sometimes motors be like that atleast in my experience
help 2021-08-29 21:42:19 nice
help 2021-08-29 21:43:17 this may sound like a stupid answer but did you press the button for turning the speakers on (also to hear the speakers the sound is based off your camera so if you have your camera far away you wont be able to hear it)
help 2021-08-29 21:45:54 maybe the song id is incorect/ nonfunctional? try another song id

general 2021-09-09 23:57:40 im doing a plane crazy chalange with my freinds does anyone have a top down map of the plane crazy map ?
general 2021-09-09 23:58:21 like an image of the map from a birdseye veiw
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 03:03:39 if a base type build was placed at each spawnpoint and they all battled eachother would it be fair with each spawnpoint?
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 03:04:08 like not spawnpoints as in plots along the thing but like ocean, tracks, airport stuff like that
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 03:05:20 like say the tracks and main spawn platform bases died, and the two bases left are of equal power but one is at the airport and the other the water would one of them have an advantage?
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 03:06:54 so the spawn points of the bases dont matter too much even though some have much more distance between them than others?
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 03:08:04 ok so it will be a fair battle for the asorted bases that people will build
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 03:08:42 ok thanks for the help
