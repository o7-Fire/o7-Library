plane-crazy 2020-04-14 22:02:35 Is it just me or is the plane camera movement control really annoying to use?
plane-crazy 2020-04-14 22:04:00 I used to be able to right click and change the angle smoothely.
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:20:03 Made an aircraft based on the event.
general 2020-04-15 18:33:12 Can somebody please explain these sounds??
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:34:10 Can someone explain these sounds??
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:38:11 Okay, now can somebody explain what the hell these sounds are? https://youtu.be/I_V59I0N9vg
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:39:09 What is the easter egg?
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:39:48 God I wish you could just toggle whether or not it can possibly show up.
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 18:40:15 Most annoying thing I've heard.
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 19:19:10 How to I change the camera angle again?

the-dump 2020-05-05 02:23:25 And like the people that use them act like it's original because ThEy HaVe DiFfErEnT CoLoRs and they add some extra section.
the-dump 2020-05-05 02:28:20 I use an basic helicopter (the annoyingly small one) But I actually added a few improvements and a weapons system. Like I added changes in ballast and helium blocks. The only thing that is the same is the helicopter blade/motor system and a similiar overall base appearance with the heli.
the-dump 2020-05-05 02:28:57 I mean I did actually add quiet a few improvements.
the-dump 2020-05-05 02:32:37 The plane crazy meta is sort of stale but sort of not...? Like the best builds are off of YT and the without a doubt, best and most powerful aircraft are those small fighters that are in a group with cutters on them. The more of them there is, the more powerful, especially if the control person is riding one.
the-dump 2020-05-07 17:37:42 Made in china: Sub Nautica cyclops!
the-dump 2020-05-07 17:39:13 What?
the-dump 2020-05-07 17:39:21 This is my own build..
the-dump 2020-05-07 17:39:37 Okay.
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 18:18:42 Hanging on for dear life
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 18:20:40 Although this glitch is kinda cool I hope they fix it.

plane-crazy 2020-05-08 00:26:49 I hope they make a thing called torpedo's that can't be fired in the air, but can be fired in the water. The torpedo's should be a lot slower but as a result, are a lot more powerful.
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 02:54:07 I hope there is some update that indirectly makes shredder bugs really bad or unable to work. Lol that's honestly what I think deep down.

plane-crazy 2020-05-11 03:01:11 No, I'm not going to suggest to ban shredder bugs.
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 03:04:22 Most shredder bug users, specifically the tryhards, so yeah most, put their man pilot seat ON a shredder bug.
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 03:04:36 Which is godanm infuriating.
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 03:05:35 Yeah shredder bugs are unbeatable and utteraly unstoppable if the main pilot seat is on the shredder bug.

plane-crazy 2020-05-25 21:21:23 What a single rocket did to my speed boat
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 02:01:28 Too the person who posted the shredder bug tutorial, please eat rat posion.
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 02:13:27 https://youtu.be/m-u5g_sSwXY  A simple boat yet quite intresting,
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 02:14:15 You might need to read the description of the video for context, so I pasted it here.
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 02:14:59 This speed boat I made in Plane crazy has the unique neashe of jumping in and out of water to protect it momentarily whilst its underwater from guns and even rockets. It's dive ability also allows it to go underneath a large ship's field of view and start attacking. The front facing wedges are actually cutters that slice through ship hulls.
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 02:15:36 It's terrifyingly effective at aircrafts.
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 02:15:50 Too bad a single rocket absolutely murderers the boat.
plane-crazy 2020-05-26 02:29:38 https://youtu.be/s2cZ_MvmScI Here's a demonstration of the combat tactics, strongpoints, and weak points of that speed boat I showed earlier.
