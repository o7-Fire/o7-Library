plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:54:01 Why not use the magic button <@584977877762572289>
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:54:08 **block**
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:54:24 B)
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:54:41 Well true
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:54:56 The best is say you blocked em and go kill em but see their reactions
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:55:02 Pretty beast
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:56:08 I like people to hate me, makes me feel at home bc it reminds me of my parents
<:thoink:657279634563399720>
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:56:53 I want to make my submarine faster but I can't ae
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:57:36 I did try a conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:57:42 Was too fast tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:58:06 My prob is not really forward speed its more turning speed
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:58:09 Noted tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:58:25 Will surely lag less than 10000 rockets
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:59:35 They can kill you easily the first time
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:59:39 Yeaash totally
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 22:59:50 They blacklist you and they got you
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:01:05 Oui
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:01:32 Pvp tanks are cool until you realize you can not fit tnt in yours bc of it shape
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:02:40 Its not bc they are tut I don't mind, it just ruins a whole pvp server
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:03:09 exposed
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 23:08:49 Btw how many messages for a level up
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 08:27:05 Lookin good
bot-central 2021-08-21 08:27:20 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 08:35:09 Hmmm yeah
general 2021-08-21 08:40:26 ðŸ˜€
general 2021-08-21 08:40:33 +1
general 2021-08-21 08:40:42 Want roles to do an epic suggestion
general 2021-08-21 08:40:53 But can't cuz no perms
general 2021-08-21 08:41:02 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 09:11:13 Bad reasoning
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 09:11:22 Was making a b29 and the happened
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 09:11:49 The guy legit put a propeller on it and make a b29 cockpit converted an helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 09:11:58 Maybe this one does a jet out of that
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 09:12:08 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 09:12:22 That was funny tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 09:12:46 So either way you'll have a fairly different build I guess
general 2021-08-21 09:33:30 Plane crazy
creations-chat 2021-08-21 11:44:58 <@389756407483990028>  i suggest you make the engines shorter so they don't take all the whing but only the front
The rest is beast, keep it up
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 14:18:05 Whaat is that
bot-central 2021-08-21 14:18:41 !rank
general 2021-08-21 14:21:17 t a o B
general 2021-08-21 14:22:08 I mean its not the clearest design ever but you can tell it's a tiger II easily
general 2021-08-21 15:42:30 I think it could work can't be that hard to optimize
general 2021-08-21 15:43:06 im finna get a rank to suggest *cannon blokcs*
general 2021-08-21 15:43:33 you can maje it stop at the end of the render distance
general 2021-08-21 15:43:39 end of the problem
general 2021-08-21 15:43:53 render distance has a mx ammount
general 2021-08-21 15:44:09 yeah probably not that easy but doubt one laser can crash the whole thing
general 2021-08-21 15:44:22 if it's made by an advanced coder that is
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 15:45:06 bizarre
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 15:47:05 you prob need some motorlock to d that
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 15:47:18 what was the original intention tho?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 15:47:27 heard a lot that it was accidental but don't know that
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 15:52:49 ooh
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 18:49:15 hello bois
bot-central 2021-08-21 18:49:18 !rank
bot-central 2021-08-21 18:49:26 hehe image perms
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:26:33 
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:26:36 Lookin good?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:27:01 Didn't paint ye thats a stock thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:27:13 Interested bout the shape
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:27:22 Wdym
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:28:58 Hmm
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:29:07 It kinda is similar to the actual thing tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:29:17 Maybe the turret is oversized
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:29:23 And makes it look small
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:29:35 A waffentrÃ¤ger
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:31:18 Ok thanks for the advice
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 19:33:17 Its a bit of an hybrid
general 2021-08-23 01:01:26 Oh right, i got 0.7 extra bullets
help 2021-08-23 15:56:03 How can I make this more realistic / complete? Feel like the shape and clockwork is going well but don't really know what details to add
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 16:00:36 Hey what details can I add to this, feel like the shape is pretty okay and the clockwork too but ehhh needs details and dunno what to add
bot-central 2021-08-27 18:38:11 a
bot-central 2021-08-27 18:38:57 &help
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 20:47:12 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:12:55 how do tutorials ruin the game tho
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:13:07 if anything it encourages new players to play
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:13:25 otherwise they would make a flinger and leave to never return bc they re bad
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:13:47 the only prob I have with tutorials is that some ppl claim it's their build when it's not
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:13:55 but the rest is ok
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:17:42 well yes these are bad
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:18:05 but there's nothing bad with someeone making the toppat spaceship even if overused and old
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:18:11 if the builder likes it it's ok
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:18:41 if  a random with no experience in similar games comes in
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:18:48 and starts experimentating
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:19:04 he will make an ugly looking plane and leave the game
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:19:10 to never return
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:19:20 because he is no expert in building
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:19:29 no of course not
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:19:45 if the game you are playing doesn't have a mechanic to encourage ppl to play
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:19:55 people don't play and the game dies
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:20:07 you can not improve without seeing how stuff is made
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:20:36 i learn how to build by making tutorials, then modifying their mechanics, then their looks, then started making stuff on my own
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:20:58 learnt*
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:22:00 yeah but they phisically can not even get close to your builds unless they either watch a tut or are really good at other building games
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:22:39 tutorials are not illegal and do not harm anyone, if someone wants to make tutorials and pvp with them because they do not like to be creative that's fine too
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:22:53 you can make a jet out of a tutorial to pvp with it that's okay
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:23:13 mechanics tutorials are always good
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:24:07 the point of the game is to make stuff and fight with it or show the stuff off
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:24:24 if you don't like to build you can skip tht with tuts and there's nothing wrong you can enjoy pvp like the rest
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:24:39 instead of seeing the game as a building and fighting game you see it as a
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:24:42 lego making then fighting
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:25:00 that is how you see the game
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:25:07 but it has no specific rules
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:25:12 people are free to do what they want
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:25:21 some people like to make the ultimate flinger instead
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:25:28 and they put effort into it and like it
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:25:39 some people just like to make tutorials just as some people like to mount legos
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:25:49 yeah or show them off or use them to fly
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:25:54 whatever it doesn't matter lmao
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:26:27 it's also good for pvp since instead of fighting  10% of good builds and a 90% of abobinations
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:26:33 you fight a 20% of good builds even if tuts
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:27:03 literally the only moment tutorials are bad is when they bring in cringey mechanics such as shreders or whhen people take credit
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:27:30 you see that's the prob
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:27:38 most fliying sims are quite expensive
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:27:50 plus pvp in pc is really cool bc it has got its own mechanics
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:28:01 so if you wanna enjoy that you can do it
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:28:39 but none have the same mechanics than plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:29:05 what you are doing by hating tutorial users is shaming people with less skill and creativity than you for trying to make cool builds like everyone else
you're a meanie!!!!
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:30:51 yeah and?
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:31:00 some people do not want to put great effort into making builds
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:31:25 which is great considering it's a roblox game and what some people think is that they prefer to not put excesive time on it as the roblox game it is
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:31:36 what
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:31:53 how does that answer to what I said ðŸ˜‚
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:33:44 and why kick someone out of the game when you can encourage them to try and play with other people so they can learn
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:34:03 tutorials only help new players experience what the game is before taking it seriously
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:34:34 people gradually make tutorials, then start making small changes, attaching bombs or weapons, start locking stuff into them, and finally they give a try to make their own thing
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:34:51 I learned how to make stuff by building tutorials and gradually improving
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:35:22 i speak with  a pvp sided vision because that is what i like bout the game
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:35:36 just like you like people making their own stuff
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:35:42 how is it annoying
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:36:09 is it annoying to have people have fun? are you annoyed because the tutorials come haunt you in your dreams?
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:36:23 otherwise i'd say someone is a bit buthurt because doesn't like people to have fun
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:36:44 the game doesn't have a point
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:36:49 the point of the game is playing
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:36:57 and you can do whatever you want
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:37:09 as long as the build is not annoying like shreders I don't mind
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:37:24 but well there's no point in discussing this honestly you have your opinions, and I have mine
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:37:32 yeah and?
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:37:52 so they are shittier because they applied creativity
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:38:01 which means without the tutorial and only their creativity
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:38:08 their build is gonna be pure shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:38:24 once again you take away the tool new players have to learn and improve
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:38:32 and to get the trial of the game
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:38:56 if you watch them well they surely do
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:39:07 telling ya, learnt how to build that way
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:39:26 i mean if you have to build them
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:39:59 why do people buy legos
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:40:12 to be creative? no, to have fun building and have a final result
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:40:33 plane crazy is a game with no set purpose of course they are the same
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:40:35 and also
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:41:00 tutorials if anything keep new players from leaving which is only beneficial to the game
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:41:20 is it fun to build a lego placing blocks one by one? some people will say no and some people will say yes, this is the same
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:41:24 some people like it some do not
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:41:57 each people has a way of enjoying the game and if it doesn't annoy you directly you shouldn't boycott them because that is what they like to do
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:42:11 there is no point in discussing it as I sid
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:42:12 said
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:42:24 I mean it is fun
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:42:29 I enjoy making my own stuff
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:42:44 but when I was newer and sucked at design it was also cool to make your own things
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:42:52 i mean to make tut things*
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:42:58 but yes this is taking us nowhere
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:43:18 there's no point in trying to change your opinion and there is no point in trying to change mine
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:43:36 plane crazy doesn't have a fix purpose
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:43:43 it doesn't have rules
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:43:50 yeah i
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:43:52 corrected that
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:44:02 because I had an aneurysm while writting
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:44:10 no I simply typed it wrong
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:44:25 what I meant to say was that I enjoyed making tut builds
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:44:47 no I didn't I simply misstyped this and if you are going to use that to prove your point there is no point in continuing
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:45:13 as you do not appear to be rational and interested in learning and debating only in proving yourself right over the others
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:45:24 so yeah bye bye got more stuff to do, was nice talking to yall
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:46:09 the point of debate is not to prove someone wrong, what matters is the way you follow and the path you take, not the place you will get to
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:46:10 but yeh
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:46:14 bye got other stuff to do
plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:46:18 yeah please do xd
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 19:04:38 awesome

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 18:44:02 omw to making a decent guided underwater anti sub torp
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 10:54:05 made this heli how to make it fly lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 10:55:22 just wot
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 11:02:55 ?
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 07:46:54 Actually in ww2 guns didn't fire while the prop was in the middle due to reliable fire systems
In ww1 tho they would just not fire too much or too quickly bc it would eat the propeller little by little lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 07:50:35 Ww1 moment lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 07:50:58 I need to get my shit together and finish my helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 07:51:23 I just had that one good idea for underwater torps but the thing wont fly
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 07:51:38 Yeah lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 07:51:49 Going to class
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 07:51:55 Bravo 6 going dark
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 18:23:24 remade an old frigate I had
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 18:23:56 r e a l
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 18:24:05 its the kriegsmarine flag
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 18:24:17 didn't make a swastica cuz I don't want to be ban hammered
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 18:24:47 would look good yeah you're right
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 18:39:50 thanks for the constructive critizism really appreciate it
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 18:41:50 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
the-dump 2022-05-06 19:27:56 
creations-chat 2022-06-23 09:14:48 with some twists it could look rlly cool
creations-chat 2022-06-23 09:18:53 that's some insecurity problems you got over there man
just like you never were at a point where you were starting like this man right here
you can be a bit more constructive and less rude and still transmit the same, don't u think
gotta say harsh has also had quite the response lol
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:09:26 making the iron lung sub does this look decent for a 10 min prototype
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:41:07 no in game its a bit darker
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:41:17 but if I make it darker the rust texture looks too bright
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:41:18 so ehh
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:41:21 makes it weird
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:41:29 exactly
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:41:50 close
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:41:50 the viewport is gonna
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:41:53 with a piston
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:42:05 which is gonna be pain to make
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:42:26 a trapdoor is not half as cool tho
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:42:36 I have given up on makin an exterior
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:42:58 ill have to hide all this shit :c
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:43:22 it has no exterior in game
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:43:27 nothing stops me from making one
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:43:34 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:43:36 like a simple one
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:43:47 that too
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:44:00 I made o2 and depth indicators tho they are decent
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 16:44:12

the-dump 2022-07-25 10:40:24 Yeah game I'm working on 
Vid by my amazing head dev who made the guns
Just sending here bc it's a large archive  and the server has nitro ðŸ˜Ž
the-dump 2022-07-25 12:58:58 Sure
the-dump 2022-07-25 18:27:03 we know mp34 is an smg
it's a placeholder model because otherwise we would have to showcase with a bLOCk
we made the scripts and actual 3d models for us are on their way but it's not as fancy
the-dump 2022-07-25 18:27:11 appreciate the other inf
