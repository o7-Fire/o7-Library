general 2021-02-19 16:03:49 I mean it is interesting in the fact that it just dosen't hit for me
general 2021-02-19 16:04:45 and now I'm forgetting how to spell and how to make comprehensible sentences
general 2021-02-19 16:08:33 cheese wedge

general 2021-02-19 16:10:14 do seagulls need wires to live
general 2021-02-19 16:10:44 oh so they can't fly more than 10 feet away from where their wire is plugged in
general 2021-02-19 16:11:18 that must be a sad life to live if you are constrained to just a circle for your entire life
general 2021-02-19 16:11:39 **man's about to take the gull off of life support**

general 2021-02-19 16:18:45 you have almost achieved comedy
general 2021-02-19 16:19:14 all you need to do is go to the chimp zone to get validated by the funy gods
general 2021-02-19 16:19:23 and you shall be considered a worker of comedy co.
general 2021-02-19 16:20:11 nice view

general 2021-02-19 16:22:54 tire
general 2021-02-19 16:23:25 when you fail to pay taxes
general 2021-02-19 16:23:36 and when you fail at being funny
general 2021-02-19 16:24:19 it is funny when you commit tax evasion and the police have to look for your clownery
general 2021-02-19 16:24:39 I am confusion
general 2021-02-19 16:24:52 soup

general 2021-02-19 16:27:08 alternatively you could have smashed your head on it
general 2021-02-19 16:27:55 I do not have time to do the funy
general 2021-02-19 16:28:05 yay I have image perms now
general 2021-02-19 16:28:28 off to the creations center I go to post my shit builds
the-dump 2021-02-19 16:32:22 who decided to land a plane in the middle of active railway tracks bruh
creations-chat 2021-02-19 16:38:34 so uh

once more based off of the upvote to downvote ration on my train in <#384025409945337856>, what could I do to potentially fix it or make it notable to those who didn't like it

EDIT: It appears to be doing better now but I still want to know where I potentially went wrong.
creations-chat 2021-02-19 17:13:09 thats nice to know
the-dump 2021-02-19 21:00:51 and it was at this moment that Nathan knew he screwed up
the-dump 2021-02-19 22:21:51 you are never safe from the train

not even in the air are you safe
the-dump 2021-02-19 22:22:37 only works on rail unsurprisingly
the-dump 2021-02-19 22:23:29 I also just realized that I could use the landing gear to realign my train if it derails so long as at least one part of it is still on the rails
help 2021-02-20 20:50:03 so I'm not having problems with my build necessarily but I do want to know how to overlap blocks like in this image here
creations-chat 2021-02-20 21:20:26 what kind of bomb detonated here that caused all this shit
creations-chat 2021-02-20 21:23:01 yeah we're just circling around
general 2021-02-20 21:24:18 uh
general 2021-02-20 21:24:22 can you try returning her
general 2021-02-20 21:24:35 she's been trying to screw the townsfolk I don't know why
general 2021-02-20 21:25:43 also are you guys watching <#504436696021204992> go to all hell
creations-chat 2021-02-20 21:30:18 at this rate the channel's gonan become a warzone
creations-chat 2021-02-20 21:32:20 well I guess it's probably reaching its climax or has already ended
help 2021-02-21 03:25:41 thank
help 2021-02-21 03:25:58 also  i s  t h a t  a  m i a t a  p f p
creations-chat 2021-02-23 03:17:30 so yeah basically this train is doing well in <#384025409945337856> but I’d still like to know how to make it better regardless of the vote count

<@!572411935669354528> I’d like to but its real life counterpart is as flashy and eye burning as this recreation
creations-chat 2021-02-23 03:19:49 this channel just fluctuates between being a dumpsterfire to being somewhat helpful to being an even worse dumpsterfire to a highway pileup to a meme hell and back into a dumpsterfire again before turning into a war zone

cool
creations-chat 2021-02-23 03:22:59 “COUSIN WHY’S THE CAR TOPPING OUT AT 35?”
