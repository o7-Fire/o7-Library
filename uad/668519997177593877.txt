general 2021-11-13 04:11:16 I just got an Air-to-Air kill on a B17 by bombing it with my $5 carpet bomber mid air
general 2021-11-25 04:02:33 Question, how do you get the Image role? Or just being able to put an image in Creations?
general 2021-11-25 04:03:35 Oh, I'm stupid

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 04:19:40 Everyday, I feel scared because everyday, I come across a new kind of shredder, each one even more wackier than the last. First the Shredder Bug, then the Shredder Bug Kamikaze Edition, then the Shredder Cube, then the Shredder Tentacle, and now the Shredder F22 Raptor...
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 04:20:17 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 04:20:36 just a long stick of shredders strapped to the front horizontally
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 04:22:25 I don't know, but it's so scary, so I made my own
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 04:22:41 the Shredder Bug LightSaber Edition
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 04:22:56 I know
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 04:23:22 I've also come across Shredder Bug Guided Missiles

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 04:25:41 The most effective measure against the rope-storm-smoke-and-trail things is to put glass in front of your face... And start spamming fireworks from a $5 CIWS
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 04:27:24 I once witnessed a legendary battle, my friends army of Shredder Bugs, vs a Shredder cube
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 04:28:30 no, the lag machine guy next to my plot
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 04:43:00 I'm scared now
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 04:43:09 I'm in a server with a noob
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 04:43:19 and a guy with a giant shredder bug
bot-central 2021-11-25 05:11:38 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:01:08 I found out that my $5 Rip-off Attack Helicopter annoys children greatly
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:02:45 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:02:53 its a rip-off heli Imade myself
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:02:57 1 block thick
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:06:48 Watch out for the Shredder F22, I didn't think anything of the long stick strapped on it, turns out, its a bunch of cutters.
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:07:15 Exactly, Shredder F22
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:07:42 You've heard of the Shredder Bug, now get ready for the Shredder F22
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:09:16 I mean, I have to use onplot flingers because mine travels at 8 MPH
bot-central 2021-11-25 12:10:15 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:12:39 Shredders can't get near me, the second they do, they just get cut up
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:12:51 Unless tthey use rockets or guns
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:15:32 I once saw someone make the Twin Towers, but filled with explosives... You can guess how that went...
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:16:54 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:16:58 a ship did
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:19:00 :0
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:19:29 The real reason Twin Towers went down!?!?!?!? Decepticons bomb autobots!?!?!?!?

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:20:24 Anime girls...
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:20:26 mechs?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:21:02 I question existence
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:22:51 I mean, have you seen my builds? Most of them are basically $5 stuff
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:24:13 mech is mech, if person make mech, that walks without doing a 180, it mech
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:24:48 And I spent 4 months researching how to make a heli
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:25:07 only to make a $5 one
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:26:27 I just experiment with new stuff
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:26:39 I got like 6 actual builds
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:27:12 I mainly mess around with replicating real-world tech into the game
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:27:25 Typically doesn't end well
creations-chat 2021-11-25 12:29:46 I accidentally deleted the screenshot
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:34:48 This thing has gone through literal hell, everyone decides to fire rockets/guns/guided missiles/shredders at it
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:35:10 This is the the life of a guy who makes $5 stuff
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:37:09 To me, just one with no effort
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:51:44 What is that jet?
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:52:37 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:52:56 the one in the image you put in
creations-chat 2021-11-25 12:55:27 I actually thought that was a Foxbat at first, but pretty good

plane-crazy 2021-11-26 18:49:24 How do you get the speakers to work?
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 18:50:24 I tried that
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 21:31:39 I have been thinking
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 21:31:41 flares
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 21:32:12 So you know how modern military aircraft deploy flares to counter heat seeking missiles?
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 21:32:38 Rockets in PC lock on the nearest part of a foreign build (I think)
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 21:33:43 So theoretically, releasing groups of loose parts in the direction of oncoming rockets will at least lessen the chances of you getting hit
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 21:33:58 If my assumption about how rockets track is correct
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 21:34:12 if not, I just wasted my time theorizing
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 21:37:13 I suspected that someone already tried it before me
general 2022-05-30 21:53:53 I have no idea what I even create in PC
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 21:55:23 I have no clue what I'm even doing
bug-reports 2022-10-09 21:21:47 I'm actually about to fight Roblox
bug-reports 2022-10-09 21:22:15 The one time I decide to test out something new, Roblox decides to make the servers buggy af
bug-reports 2022-10-09 21:23:09 I forgot I had robux, thx
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 21:16:49 out of all the things I ever considered strange on this game
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 21:16:59 Never did I think I would find a giant tut plane
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 21:17:20 Why is this my first time witnessing it
