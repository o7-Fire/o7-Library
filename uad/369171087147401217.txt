plane-crazy 2021-02-19 14:26:09 i'll just explain the image by words that always works
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 14:27:00 the front of my turret goes out into the sides at an 120 degree angle
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 14:27:27 but because i am using corner wedges to make my angle not look like an abomination it goes at a 135 degree angle
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 14:27:34 so it's thicker and shorter
