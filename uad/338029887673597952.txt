general 2021-02-11 00:54:12 also this game looks dope and I wanted to play it with my friend blaze, we are kinda like, both getting the error t-t
general 2021-02-11 00:54:36 I dunno thats what I'm askin
general 2021-02-11 00:54:43 I wan play the gaem dangit
general 2021-02-11 00:54:47 I did say I was on xbax lol
general 2021-02-11 00:55:08 I have done this
general 2021-02-11 00:55:17 Why are you copy pasting I'm not a dumb
general 2021-02-11 00:55:41 Well I said I went through the steps!
general 2021-02-11 00:56:13 Everything else I have sucks lol
general 2021-02-11 00:56:24 and I'm like a bajillion times more used to xbox controls
general 2021-02-11 00:57:06 Rip, well, I tried, I'ma stay here though cuz' this game looks nice.
general 2021-02-11 00:57:50 like, you know, with the $120 controller I bought because, you know, I like my xbox?
general 2021-02-11 00:58:32 Why am I getting hounded by an elitist about *roblox*
general 2021-02-11 00:58:53 Anyways, I'm gonna keep an eye out, if this becomes supported on xbox I know like ten bajillion people who will play lol
general 2021-02-11 00:59:00 Because I like my xbox, lol.
general 2021-02-11 00:59:33 I can literally hook a mouse and keyboard to my xbox and it works on roblox.
general 2021-02-11 00:59:39 shut
general 2021-02-11 00:59:58 Yeesh, what a warm welcome.
general 2021-02-11 01:00:34 Ok, lol.
general 2021-02-11 01:01:34 You aren't trying to help, from the very beginning you've given me steps I have already gone through to fix the problem and then you've said stupid things like "nyeuh, heuheu you're on console"
general 2021-02-11 01:01:41 Bruh
general 2021-02-11 01:02:40 How about you stop being an elitist, pc is too expensive to maintain and becomes obsolete in five minutes and roblox on phone has arguably LESS controllability than that of an xbox or a ps4 even.
general 2021-02-11 01:02:55 Read what I wrote.
general 2021-02-11 01:02:57 Then reply
general 2021-02-11 01:03:37 Well, I mean I got my answer at least. I legit didn't mean to start a flame war D:
general 2021-02-11 01:05:02 I prefer console lol.
general 2021-02-11 01:05:32 yeah they did lol.
general 2021-02-11 01:05:48 I got mine when it came out, like $500
general 2021-02-11 01:06:28 I said shut because they were being elitists about it.
general 2021-02-11 01:06:35 I didn't tell them to stop trying to help lol.
general 2021-02-11 01:06:48 But they've been hostile from the very beginning, as soon as I said xbox I broke some sacred rule.
general 2021-02-11 01:07:06 Incredibly bad at helping. :/
general 2021-02-11 01:07:15 Pc is better, I do agree, but wew
general 2021-02-11 01:07:38 I did no such thing.
general 2021-02-11 01:07:54 Do I have to keep saying *why* said shut?
general 2021-02-11 01:08:00 and why are we even arguing about me saying shut
general 2021-02-11 01:08:29 `Then I'm getting told I'm apparently the one who started being rude`
general 2021-02-11 01:08:46 >:l
general 2021-02-11 01:09:07 Yeah I was just askin if it was supported, I got my answer, so I'm good.
general 2021-02-11 01:09:54 I'm not gonna shut up simply because you told me to, and i got my answer, you're putting words in my mouth and saying I'm rude.
general 2021-02-11 01:10:50 I do hope one day the game gets console support. :)
general 2021-02-11 01:11:13 I thought we were supposed to stop talking about it and move on.
general 2021-02-11 01:11:45 Are you people this toxic to everyone you meet? Jeez.
general 2021-02-11 01:17:31 Man this game looks fun
general 2021-02-11 01:17:45 I bet
general 2021-02-11 01:17:51 I wish my pc could run it lol.
general 2021-02-11 01:17:58 or my old ipad
