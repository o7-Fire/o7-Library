plane-crazy 2019-09-20 20:15:46 Thank you.
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 20:19:04 How much something is allowed to stretch.
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 20:20:34 My favorite thing to build on here is rockets.
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 20:21:39 I made one so far, and I am working on another. I just need a way to bypass the height limit. I probably could use a motor to rotate the second half into position? Any opinions?
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 21:02:18 Hm.
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 21:02:32 lol

help 2019-09-20 21:22:46 I was just making sure so I don't ask in the wrong channel.
creations-chat 2019-09-20 21:25:09 <@310863132727836672> What are you using to move that top part onto the lower part?
creations-chat 2019-09-20 21:25:29 I was just curious. Thanks.
creations-chat 2019-09-20 21:26:47 I think there are a few people that just go to <#384025409945337856> and just downvote everything they see.

plane-crazy 2019-09-22 00:49:36 Okay.
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 00:50:23 Uh ih
help 2019-09-22 18:37:02 I'd like some help. I am making a rocket that is *way* too big for the barrier I am given. So, what I am *trying* to do is rotate other areas of the rocket into place, bypassing the height barrier. I would love to keep the motors hidden. Any advice?  I simply can't find a way to hide the motors and make the motors rotate the other parts of the rocket. Is there any other ways to rotate the pieces into place?
help 2019-09-22 18:49:32 Darn.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 20:41:36 ***the engines are making odd sounds***
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 20:42:17 Yeah. Last time I got this, it scared me. Bad.
