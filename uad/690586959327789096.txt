plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:33:08 *potato pc*
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:36:18 cool
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:36:23 can u show us the other side
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:37:43 ye
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:37:47 wait
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:37:53 does it count
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:38:13 if i use engines to go up forward and down and turn?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:38:16 in my heli?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:38:24 it dosent use it to fly
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:38:34 the main is the rotor
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:38:43 and it hovers witgh only the rotor
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:39:07 i could set motor to unpowed snd put jet engines
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:39:16 /but its techically using jet engines to fly
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:39:48 even swahplate is not capable of going up and down
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:39:51 so.....
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:40:08 how do we even do it without jets or engines to fly totally
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:40:15 kk
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:41:08 what is the definiton of "fly"
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:41:12 without engines
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:41:21 like just in the air?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:41:25 move?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:42:06 • Takes off and lands vertically.
• Uses only propeller blades (not propeller engines) to fly.
• Is at least 100 blocks.
• Is able to hover in place without the use of anchor blocks or using other engines.
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:42:11 this is the criteria
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:42:22 i can take off and land vertically but with engines
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:42:39 i can use propellor blades to fly but not move
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:42:45 i have 193 blovks
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:42:58 and i can hover without engines or anchor blocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:43:02 so....
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:43:06 does it count?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:45:19 insides of my heli
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:45:23 i was hovering then
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 03:45:36 as u can see none of the engines were actiavted
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 04:16:36 thicc
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 04:39:37 is it that hard?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 04:39:42 maybe it is.
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 04:39:47 idk
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 04:40:17 how hard is it to make a good heli?
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 04:40:24 rate from 1 to 10
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 04:40:49 ohhh cuz u use like 20 million motorlocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 04:40:53 kk
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 04:41:02 i only use motorlock for weapons in heneral
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 04:41:17 much easier to keep track of the weight distribution
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 04:42:02 kk
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 04:43:04 unmotorlocked heli
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 04:43:11 still looks fine
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 05:07:16 ouuu
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 08:00:15 doesent seems cusom
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 08:00:29 still looks like the tiny landing gear
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 08:00:42 can you show a top view too
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 08:00:55 ohh
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 08:01:36 ummmmm
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 08:02:44 dosent seems quite realistic

plane-crazy 2022-12-24 08:54:24 maybe bro is building a falken
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:02:03 
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:15:41 for me its easier to put in stuff
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:15:45 also also
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:16:02 i dont have to slave away doing 20 million detailing stuff
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:16:08 also looks cool in my opinion
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:16:16 do have to agree
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:16:26 not rlly
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:16:56 mini builds are more uh annoying than difficult
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:17:11 they arent hard to make per-se just anooying
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:17:42 you mean 3x1x2 cuz 2 of the sides will have the motor part sticks out
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:18:32 i prefer camera lock over angle lock but cam lock will lock the thing to the main seat and its harder to include parts that flow smoothly without collsion
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:19:31 for the canopy part i use cam lock but sometimes i have to use motor lock cuz the game doesnt allow for cam lock sometimes
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:19:32 such as
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:19:35 rotation
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:20:05 along the axes
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:20:30 and also
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:21:14 idk
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:21:19 feels nice ig
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:21:30 but i dont like the tweaky part about it
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:21:46 plane crazy isnt HARD its just finnicky and very tweaky and micro-adjustments
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:21:57 thats why i sometimes hate plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:22:55 i mean its just annoying
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:22:56 not hard
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:23:02 alot of micro-adjustments
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:25:30 ok
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 09:25:41 they told you to stop flexing your car

plane-crazy 2022-12-24 16:53:29 when fat amy not fat
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 16:58:33 happens alot
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 10:28:36 how does this mini f-35c look 65% done just needs the landing gear the belly and the details and also functionality
(ignore the hole in the canopy that can be fixed its just removed temporarily)
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 10:29:39 i see
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 10:29:56 anyways how does it look
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 10:30:38 the only exposed motorlock is the rear abit will stick out but it will be fine with some touch-ups
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 10:32:59 took inspi from some mini f-35s I saw on yt
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 10:33:13 Maybe that’s why it looks somewhat similar
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 14:53:22 how does this look
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 14:56:54 
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 14:57:32 
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 15:02:57 i took inspiration from some mini f-35s i found
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 15:03:07 possibly leading to the similarity
creations-chat 2022-12-25 16:14:58 it isnt

plane-crazy 2022-12-25 16:19:15 here
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 16:19:25 i can show you a plethora of differences
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 16:19:43 kk.
creations-chat 2022-12-25 16:27:16 good for beginners ig

but doesnt help with giving the person original ideas and room to experiment

i think guides and like tutorials on parts such as afterburner tutorial or like plane basics series is good
creations-chat 2022-12-25 16:29:20 but copying fully isnt good for the player like a full f-18 tut isnt gonna help with building skills
creations-chat 2022-12-25 16:46:23 the sound caught me off-guard
creations-chat 2022-12-25 16:48:26 very inaccurate the fuselage is longer than the wings and the extensions so not roscale downvote grr
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 17:12:50 bonk
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 17:41:34 increase the height of the engines
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 17:41:35 like
plane-crazy 2022-12-25 17:41:40 move the engines up
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 16:16:27 f-35 cosmetic ASRAAM yay or nay

plane-crazy 2022-12-26 17:21:52 yay or nay
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:18:01 F
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:18:12 The feel should be wider I feel
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:18:35 I think add more torque and weight
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:18:39 Add some weight
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:18:53 Yea
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:19:00 Like a ballast on max or sum
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:19:03 It can help stabilise
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:19:58 The colour scheme is ass
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:20:13 Also it doesn’t look like a F-15 STOL ngl
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:20:33 Oh lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:24:54 
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:25:12 earlier version of my f-35:
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:33:40 was the sword made of wing panels
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:33:41 if so
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:33:48 thats prolly why
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:33:57 cux wing panels have like
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:34:02 a helium-y effect
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:34:08 causing a feedback loop
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 05:34:15 just use half blovks mayve
