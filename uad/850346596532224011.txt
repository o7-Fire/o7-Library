plane-crazy 2021-06-06 15:39:10 if you scale a robloxian to the scale of an average male adult(~175), 1 block is 0.9 meters.
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 17:48:28 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 17:48:37 completely wrong

plane-crazy 2021-06-07 18:35:27 i said USE 1X2 DELTA WINGS
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 18:35:36 brain damage <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 18:36:14 you are actually stupid
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 18:36:26 i said USE **1X2** DELTA WINGS
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 18:37:23 brain damage
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 18:37:43 im going to try to explain it very slowly for the 4th-or-so time
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 18:39:54 replace the 1x3 delta wings that you have installed on your aircraft as wing elements, with the 1x2 delta wings,(the ones that are 1 block shorter than the current ones) on your aircraft's wing rather than the 1x3 to make it look better and more accurate.
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 18:40:05 that doesnt mean i havent built aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 18:40:22 ???
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 18:40:51 is he implying that i have never built a plane before?
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 18:41:27 if anything i should be questioning him if he ever has, judging by the fact that he cant even follow a blueprint.
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 18:42:14 have you even tried 1x2 delta wings?
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 18:44:05 looks fine on mine
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 18:44:46 the ye-8 is literally based on the mig 21
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 18:45:58 would actually be kind of nice of you stopped talking, you clearly have some sort of mental handicap and every time i speak to you i get a little closer to your level
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 18:48:08 you literally dont understand basic geometry
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 19:11:35 i hate it when i try to help people but their brain doesnt work
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 19:14:16 if it doesnt matter then why do you even ask?
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 19:14:19 who cares?
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 19:14:23 why should anyone care?
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 19:14:29 afterall, its not even real
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 19:14:47 its an illusion of rapidly changing coloured circles
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 19:15:14 hypocrite

plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:11:01 why would you use jets instead of super rockets?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:11:04 waste of space.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:12:05 whatr
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:12:28 thats just a video game physics issue
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:12:59 any stiff object with physics will fling if getting hit
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:13:34 yeet? damn, i thought 2016 was 5 years ago
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:13:47 must've been my computer saying the wrong date
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:14:01 and i must have a bad perception of time
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:14:58 the meme is "Both, both are good."
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:14:59 smh
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:15:13 not *is*
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:16:22 correct, you are approximately 10 years away from your 20s
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:16:58 <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:17:16 alright then

plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:26:45 why not 500?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:26:55 fuck it, why not infinite?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:28:34 no
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:28:38 it is not sentient
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:28:44 it does not feel anything at all
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:29:03 yes?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:29:22 i dont think you realize how thin a banana peel is
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:29:33 just imagine driving over a ruler
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:30:01 not everyone has claustrophobia though
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:30:17 and not everyone is afraid of the dark
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:30:52 this?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:30:52 ?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:31:57 but that typically only happens if something actually happens to you
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:32:42 i dont think you would develop claustrophobia by just driving around in a p50
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:32:54 but maybe if you had a life changing accident in a p50
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:33:31 could just be a low speed crash
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:33:48 i dont think you need much to get seriously injured
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:33:58 also, why does it even exist?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:34:06 just drive a motorcycle
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:34:12 probably safer too
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:37:54 whattt????
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 14:37:57 really????

plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:44:56 what
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:45:15 kind of?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:45:26 certainly related to plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:46:41 but most people use general as plane crazy chat because they have a brain cell deficiency anyway and nobody comments on it
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:48:04 you dont know the difference between a little white tube with a turbine labeled "small jet engine" and a rocket engine with a giant blue exhaust flame labeled "SUPER ROCKET ENGINE"?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:50:37 this doesnt even have anything to do with plane crazy anymore bruh
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:50:43 this is just common sense

general 2021-07-19 10:15:19 i think its because ive seen so many videos of those fighter pilot centrifugal g machine things
general 2021-07-19 10:16:34 you know those hydraulic racing sims?

general 2021-07-19 10:19:27 in denmark we have a coaster with the option of wearing a vr headset
general 2021-07-19 10:19:47 so you're in the coaster but you're wearing a vr headset
general 2021-07-19 10:21:11 its the same coaster so you dont get motion sickness, but with dragons and shit
general 2021-07-19 10:21:22 never tried it but people tell me its awesome

general 2021-07-20 11:02:43 why does it have small wheels ontop?
general 2021-07-20 11:03:52 why would you upvote?
general 2021-07-20 11:03:58 it still sucks lmao
general 2021-07-20 11:11:03 why would you want gears in plane crazy?
general 2021-07-20 11:11:35 why though?
general 2021-07-20 11:11:52 it probably doesnt even make you go faster
general 2021-07-20 11:12:02 its powered by a small wheel
general 2021-07-20 11:12:21 ( that means that the big wheel thats touching the ground goes slower )
general 2021-07-20 11:12:29 why do you need more torque
general 2021-07-20 11:13:02 your car must suck if it cant drive without 34295372610 torque
general 2021-07-20 11:13:16 my car has 4 torque
general 2021-07-20 11:13:30 acceleration
general 2021-07-20 11:13:40 but that doesnt matter in plane crazy
general 2021-07-20 11:13:46 it goes 300+
general 2021-07-20 11:14:13 the speed is at 50 so that means 500 rpm
general 2021-07-20 11:14:37 i could just add a second motor to my wheel and go 600 too lmao
general 2021-07-20 11:14:51 maybe even a third and go 900
general 2021-07-20 11:14:57 yes you do
general 2021-07-20 11:15:03 nevermind
general 2021-07-20 11:15:09 but why?
general 2021-07-20 11:15:40 mine has quite smooth acceleration and a perfect top speed
general 2021-07-20 11:15:48 its a dakar car so its offroad
general 2021-07-20 11:16:48 why not just vip1?
general 2021-07-20 11:18:13 you are ranked

plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:24:43 this build is so bad
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:24:50 its made with garbage motorlock :///
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:25:12 show us your great amazing builds then
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:26:00 
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:26:01 wow dude

plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:26:14 this is the best build ive ever seen bro
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:26:20 you're so talented
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:26:27 i way underestimated your skills bro
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:26:31 i am so jealous
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:26:57 why isnt this awesome train in hof???
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:27:33 he got the inspiration for his proportions when he looked down lmaooo
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:28:25 woahh awesome tornado bro
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:28:53 all of your other builds is recreations of classic roblox stuff
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:28:59 so its supposed to look like shit
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:29:08 
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:29:10 nice train bro
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:29:46 they're like less than 50 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:29:53 anyone could make them
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:30:26 cope harder
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:32:16 40 times better
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:33:16 then why do your builds suck?
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:33:35 > then why do your builds suck?
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:34:15 your builds *do* suck
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:34:26 and motorlock *does* improve builds
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:34:31 (most of the time)
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:34:56 some people forget when to/not to use it and mess their builds up
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:35:05 and sometimes its very exposed etc
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:35:09 but mostly it helps
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:35:32 then make something good without motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:35:35 i dare you
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:35:53 i would also qualify that as shit
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:36:03 running away because you're wrong?
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:36:14 still shit
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:36:26 just like if you motorlocked phantom's builds it would help
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:36:46 it'd be like putting a bandaid on an amputated arm
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:37:22 3000
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:37:33 conveyor?
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:40:27 my guess is 700 speed
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:40:35 120
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 21:42:19 ok but why

general 2021-07-26 20:35:18 not worth it
general 2021-07-26 20:35:39 6/10 ignoring price
general 2021-07-26 20:35:52 3/10 including price
general 2021-07-26 20:36:54 they kind of taste like crab but with less taste imo

creations-chat 2021-08-01 19:11:36 plane crazy having a crappy selection of wedges is this build's downfall
creations-chat 2021-08-01 19:13:37 still, the front is slight disaster, as someone who almost only builds in 1:1 i feel you

also blocky camo fardtd
creations-chat 2021-08-01 19:15:39 paint would be better without camo imo, but the front is impossible
creations-chat 2021-08-01 19:17:42 yeah but that doesn't really work in plane crazy, like this maybe?

plane-crazy 2021-08-02 19:46:11 no thats just because the nose sucked which made it look obese
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 19:46:14

plane-crazy 2021-08-02 19:53:31 better than
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 19:56:19 pretty accurate tbh
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 19:56:29 only thing is that the rear is a few blocks too short
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 19:57:14 like in brick rigs
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 20:02:45 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 20:02:49 he kind of right
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 20:03:11 you might not be the best designer, that doesnt mean you are bad at building though
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 20:03:28 yeah

general 2021-08-03 17:03:53 <:this:735210701945307388>
general 2021-08-03 17:04:34 do you even have any motorlock on it actually?
general 2021-08-03 17:05:12 the turbine is literally on the very edge of the engine

plane-crazy 2021-08-03 20:06:06 at the very least one of
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 20:06:55 imo thats just a disadvantage that you pitch so fast
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 20:07:20 far more difficult to aim
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 20:07:26 wasnt talking about airspeed

plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:46:27 do a crj 700 with a gun
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:46:39 any particular reason bro
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:47:39 so you dont like any plane except for modern fighters?
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:48:09 but they are cool
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:48:24 
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:48:29 
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:49:44 its just another grey tube with wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:50:18 ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:50:41 i was just saying that all planes are tubes with wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:51:07 except fighters tend to be grey and airliners tend to be white
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:54:41 almost as if your own argument contradicts with what you like in an airplane
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:55:08 look bro, grey tube with wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:55:21 then why is it your only argument?
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:55:31 for what reason?
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:56:45 idk man, i think a 34019kg can of people going 876 kmh 12.49km in the air is kind of cool
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:57:11 > do a crj 700 with a gun
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:57:13 smh
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:57:21 then what makes it a fighter jet
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:58:03 nimble and agile are synonyms
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:58:59 tbf the yf12 is the ugliest plane possibly ever
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:59:27 looks like something batman would own
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 11:59:45 except very slightly more curved
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 12:00:04 actually no, the batmobile is curvy
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 12:00:14 batman definitely owns this plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 12:00:39 it looks like an rc plane in every single photo
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 12:00:48 
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 12:01:05 except for the 2nd photo
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 12:01:40 in terms of plane crazy, id actually say that fighter jets are boring
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 12:01:46 they are far more common
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 12:02:53 however commercial jets are rare af in terms of ones that are well built
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 12:03:38 ive seen like 5 custom jets within the 3 days ive been back home from italy
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 12:04:23 theres at least 1 or 2 fighter jets in every server in this entire game
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 12:07:12 theres the 6th one
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 12:07:36 actually the 7th because sr said he was making one
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 12:08:27 a lot of fucking people have an f/a-16
