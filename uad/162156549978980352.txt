The Tale of edzactly (162156549978980352)
creations-chat 2020-03-30 09:12:45 Half-Life: Alyx just came out a week ago and I decided to recreate the iconic Combine Gunship that you find in both HL:A and HL2.
creations-chat 2020-03-30 09:15:35 To be honest I could've made one main rotor but since idk how to make swashplates, I used two to stabilize and make it flyable lol
creations-chat 2020-04-01 06:41:35 Stryker ATGM and Stryker LAV. Both have separate controls. I move the Stryker ATGM with WASD (which is my main) and the LAV with TFGH. The Stryker ATGM can fire up to 9 missiles while the LAV uses guns for support.
creations-chat 2020-04-01 06:42:19 The Stryker LAV can also carry eight other people (and possibly another driver to control this one using the secondary pilot seat).
creations-chat 2020-04-03 09:21:34 Been destroying my Apache build a lot of times now. It's just really satisfying to see helicopters crash lol

plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:42:30 The blocks of the turret and the floor blocks being literally close together usually is the problem because of weird roblox physics.
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:42:42 You could either use half blocks so there's space between the floor and the turret
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:42:52 or you can use wedges facing inwards so it looks like a full block.
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 05:45:01 I am aware lol

creations-chat 2020-04-08 06:45:05 I could make it wider but I might have problems turning it because of whack roblox physics
creations-chat 2020-04-08 06:51:59 The barbette is a bit visible on the second naval gun behind the first one though. But same thing: I can't make it wider due to whack roblox p6
help 2020-04-08 06:56:46 Any suggestions as to how I can prevent this gap from widening?

creations-chat 2020-04-12 14:33:05 Also, the naval guns can turn yayy (they sometimes break due to motor 2's being gay)

the-dump 2020-04-21 06:56:53 anime is Gate
the-dump 2020-04-21 06:57:09 it won't be surprising if their military is composed of otakus
the-dump 2020-04-21 06:57:22 so much for self-defense force
the-dump 2020-04-21 06:58:37 speaking of self-defense, I remember there were talks of having an article in them that is being abolished or something. basically that article prevents Japan from going into wars, thus their *Self-Defense* force
the-dump 2020-04-21 06:58:45 people are debating over it though
the-dump 2020-04-21 07:01:40 smh there are still a lot of stuff that Japan didn't acknowledge
the-dump 2020-04-21 07:01:49 just like the shit that they did in my country back in WW2
the-dump 2020-04-21 07:03:10 Not sure if it's ok to talk about this here but some of them are war crimes that Japan did, such as the Bataan Death March
the-dump 2020-04-21 07:03:23 literally hundreds of PoW Americans and Filipinos were forced to march under the sun

creations-chat 2020-04-24 05:52:40 epic
help 2020-04-24 06:19:20 Yeah because the speedometer is showing the top speed of the engines or propellers on your build, but due to how water affects builds, it moves slow.
help 2020-04-24 06:20:21 Can you show a picture of your build?
help 2020-04-24 06:23:29 Hmm
help 2020-04-24 06:23:47 Yeah it moves slow because of friction from the build and the ground.
help 2020-04-24 06:24:04 What you could do is either put wheels on it or set the blocks at the bottom to ice material.
help 2020-04-24 06:24:26 Yeah but you said it also moves slow when not in water lol
help 2020-04-24 06:24:29 Oh I see.
help 2020-04-24 06:25:34 Oh when it's on the surface of the water
help 2020-04-24 06:28:36 I'm not really sure what to say about this, but comparing both builds doesn't matter since they're differently built. One thing I could say, the reason why the shark moves slow out of water is because of roblox physics.
help 2020-04-24 06:29:08 Or maybe I'm not really just the right person to ask about that <:GWchadMEGATHINK:366999806343774218>
help 2020-04-24 06:30:19 Yeah lag also affects the speed of your build
help 2020-04-24 06:30:34 Though if a big build moves with high speed, it tend to lag
help 2020-04-24 06:32:08 ?
help 2020-04-24 06:33:15 Either add a lot of rocket engines or add a conveyer engine
help 2020-04-24 06:33:29 My 1706 block A-10 uses 48 super rocket engines to fly lol
help 2020-04-24 06:33:51 You'll need a lot of power to move bigger builds
help 2020-04-24 06:34:15 How many rockets does it have
help 2020-04-24 06:35:06 super rocket engines?
help 2020-04-24 06:35:28 Wait so it moves slow but it can still fly?
help 2020-04-24 06:36:08 Because to be honest, if you wanna fly faster, you can straight up use a conveyer drive
help 2020-04-24 06:36:19 Conveyer drives moves really fast
help 2020-04-24 06:36:42 bruh
help 2020-04-24 06:46:54 I don't exactly remember how to build one though but it comprises of two conveyer blocks and a piston
help 2020-04-24 06:47:08 Also it shouldn't interrupt it
help 2020-04-24 06:47:29 There's tutorials on how to build one
help 2020-04-24 06:47:34 It's a relatively small module
help 2020-04-24 06:50:11 Not really, as long as you keep the speed of the conveyers slower, because speed of 5 alone is already fast.

help 2020-04-29 14:31:03 iirc the planes should not be mini ones
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:33:02 their filter is run by a learning bot

plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:33:47 They thought that the AI can handle anything
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:33:53 thus it lead to bullshit filtering
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:34:24 The bad filtering system is the reason why "lmao" got filtered

general 2020-05-07 11:20:24 Although the weapon creator tool will lag out because there's a lot of parts if I make it more detailed.
general 2020-05-07 11:20:51 It's better compared to these ones

general 2020-05-10 05:37:58 Maybe simple cylinder blocks as casings would work. Maybe you can fit many of them too.

plane-crazy 2020-05-10 13:23:32 .. if I buy the radio gamepass in the development build, will it transfer to the actual game?
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 13:23:47 because I don't really want to waste 600 robux, one for the dev build and one for the actual game :/
general 2020-05-10 13:27:24 How do you claim ownership?
general 2020-05-10 13:27:57 oo
general 2020-05-10 13:28:35 there's only this :/

general 2020-05-10 13:45:01 to join an empty group
general 2020-05-10 13:45:07 and claimed it
general 2020-05-10 13:45:15 so yeah you don't need premium.
general 2020-05-10 13:45:21 just make sure no one's in the group
general 2020-05-10 13:46:19 as long as they're not "owner" yeah
general 2020-05-10 13:46:58 I found a group
general 2020-05-10 13:47:06 with an announcement dating back from 2012
general 2020-05-10 13:47:30 group's locked tho

general 2020-05-10 13:52:58 I only managed to find one empty group
general 2020-05-10 13:53:05 The next ones I find are already taken :/
general 2020-05-10 13:55:36 also when did roblox change the group limits for each account?
general 2020-05-10 13:55:45 There used to be like 5-maximum groups you can join
general 2020-05-10 13:57:39 damn

general 2020-05-11 09:01:35 you kind of want to start with a circle first
general 2020-05-11 09:01:50 use a shape tool or something
general 2020-05-11 09:02:13 then you draw a line like this
general 2020-05-11 09:02:20 that depends on what angle of the face you'll do
general 2020-05-11 09:02:26 this one's like your standard 3/4
general 2020-05-11 09:03:17 and then you draw the curve that resembles the chin and cheeks
general 2020-05-11 09:03:25 the chin basically is located at the end of your mid line
general 2020-05-11 09:04:05 and then on the edge of the chin on the left, draw a line upwards. that should be where the ear is placed
general 2020-05-11 09:04:40 and then a line across which would be where the eyes are located

plane-crazy 2020-05-12 00:42:00 I've been building without outlines the past 3 weeks lel
general 2020-05-12 00:44:01 good morning
general 2020-05-12 00:44:52 quak
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 00:45:14 I removed the shader files from roblox directory
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 00:45:31 And then upped my graphics quality so i have more render distance lel
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 00:45:47 So high render distance with lowest graphics
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 00:46:02 Definitely
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 00:46:32 Some colors tend to blend well with blocks behind it if it has the same color.
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 00:47:11 It's pretty much worse with me and low graphics but I'm already used to it
plane-crazy 2020-05-12 00:47:20 Bright colors tend to do that

general 2020-05-13 14:58:15 > To be honest, a lot more people will abuse it because it costs
This is the most hilarious statement I've ever heard in my entire life.
general 2020-05-13 15:00:01 > Because they pay = no rules. Having it for free = fear losing it
<@!318699736448106496>  
It's the opposite lmao.
general 2020-05-13 15:00:15 Here's the thing:

general 2020-05-13 15:00:56 But yeah that's not how it works.
general 2020-05-13 15:01:13 The mods can easily ban people abusing something behind the paywal
general 2020-05-13 15:01:26 So the devs themselves are the ones who benefits.

help 2020-05-15 08:57:05 <@!290002582276014082> I can't really provide an example right now, but what you can do is motor lock a bunch of blocks with one disconnector each and when a rocket is near you, activate the disconnectors.
general 2020-05-15 08:58:47 <@!296280922771292170> Depends on the quality and how much episodes there are in a season. I think a 24-episode season with 720p quality will give you somewhere around 2.5 GB to 5 GB.

general 2020-05-15 13:48:40 bye
bug-reports 2020-05-15 14:26:08 Odd. I use a conveyer drive (1 conveyer + friction block) to accelerate my aircraft. It used to be able to do perfect barrel rolls without tilting to the sides. It also used to not wobble unless I use rockets instead of the drive. Conveyer speed is 22, and I can hit a stable max speed of 800-1000.

Now, I put it on speed of 5, it accelerates slowly, but then it gradually increases up to 2k and I lose control of the aircraft build :c

bug-reports 2020-05-16 02:51:39 <@!217336009455566848> This may or may not be of interest to you regarding the conveyer drives. I did some testing again today this morning and I found out the reason why my aircraft is so janky when using a conveyer drive.

Turns out that small landing gears are the root cause of this. Here's a video clip of the aircraft **without** the small landing gear doing a full barrel roll. Conveyer speed is at 22 and I press E to roll the aircraft.
bug-reports 2020-05-16 02:52:23 And here's a clip of the aircraft **with** the small landing gear. Again, same conveyer speed at 22, same keybind. All I do here is roll but the plane seem to fly in another direction even though I'm just rolling.
bug-reports 2020-05-16 02:53:19 I'm not holding other directional keys on the second video, only my right-roll key "E"
bug-reports 2020-05-16 02:58:00 Conclusion, small landing gears literally makes the aircraft build uncontrollable and unstable. That's why the plane keeps spazzing out when doing turns last night on your server :l

creations-chat 2020-05-22 10:58:37 You can use TNT if you have enough.
creations-chat 2020-05-22 10:59:33 Basically what it does is that the motor locks pull the treads into the wheels. Once it is fitted, you activate the BreakWeld on the springs (or det the TNT) so it unwelds from the treads.

I'm not sure where to start specifically, but if you want to draw people, you can try and look for poses as reference
general 2020-05-31 12:39:09 In addition
general 2020-05-31 12:39:44 You could draw some basic geometry over the poses to see the basics as to how they're posed like that
general 2020-05-31 12:40:13 yeah you can simply look for a walking pose and use it as a reference
general 2020-05-31 12:40:23 well uh, it's kind of hard to put this into words
general 2020-05-31 12:40:36 I'd go draw an example but im not using my laptop rn

general 2020-06-07 02:04:47 Seriously what's wrong with save data? Mine decreased from 230k down to 206k. Well it may feel like not much but most of my builds are huuuuge.
general 2020-06-07 02:05:23 Shadow, I think a mute would be more better option.
general 2020-06-07 02:06:23 The ladders are useful for decoration it's not entirely useless lol
general 2020-06-07 02:06:57 People are just mad and are jumping on the bandwagon of asking for more wedges.
general 2020-06-07 02:08:45 Can people like, chill the fuck out?
general 2020-06-07 02:09:39 Like come on I just woke up and the first thing I saw in Discord are people spamming downvotes because they disagree with an update lmfao
general 2020-06-07 02:12:04 I just can't have a proper though process on this shit.
general 2020-06-07 02:14:39 I'm fucking losing my nerves over this stupid shitshow. Can ya'll just fucking chill.
general 2020-06-07 02:15:50 Can you guys just stop :(
general 2020-06-07 02:16:07 It's just a fucking update for fuck's sake
general 2020-06-07 02:16:50 And people are rioting because a simple react is being removed. That's just stupid.
general 2020-06-07 02:17:55 <@!280162718961631234> There's nothing wrong with not liking an update. What's wrong is spamming and going crazy because you want to get clout for not liking an update.
general 2020-06-07 02:18:21 You people hate the update? No need to fucking announce it to everyone like jeez
general 2020-06-07 02:19:22 <@!280162718961631234> My save data went from 230k to 206k after the update lol.

general 2020-06-16 14:06:26 aeugh I remember drawing Toriel a lot of times on a sketch pad
general 2020-06-16 14:06:37 ok it's actually the worst combo

general 2020-06-16 14:21:51 Also I doubt it's that curvy
general 2020-06-16 14:22:00 Refraction is causing the straight lines to be curvy
general 2020-06-16 14:22:30 assuming that it's not curvy
general 2020-06-16 14:22:31 
general 2020-06-16 14:22:33 it should look like that

plane-crazy 2020-06-18 12:12:32 <@!380926327210901506> I yeeted that huge T-90 build

general 2020-06-18 13:41:39 e
general 2020-06-18 13:41:48 I don't even know how that will work
general 2020-06-18 13:42:08 oh all it does is compress
general 2020-06-18 13:42:16 but we kinda need it to rotate
general 2020-06-18 13:42:21 since some builds do illegal angles
general 2020-06-18 13:42:40 <:GWchinaSakuraThinking:398950680217255977>
general 2020-06-18 13:42:55 Compression block with options for both half or full block compression
general 2020-06-18 13:43:14 As well as an option to set what angle it turns when spawned
general 2020-06-18 13:43:40 Rewrite probably gonna take more time
general 2020-06-18 13:44:21 <@!435864400235200522> Bet PC will be rewritten before I can even finish 50% of my artworks
general 2020-06-18 13:46:08 Because it was a side project?
general 2020-06-18 13:49:36 Doubting on wedge
general 2020-06-18 13:49:50 I don't see much builds using wedges on the public servers I join
general 2020-06-18 13:50:02 It's either builds spammed with rockets and guns, and engines
general 2020-06-18 13:50:06 or blocky builds
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 13:50:39 toe
general 2020-06-18 13:51:12 Instead of new blocks, can't we just have a resize tool?
general 2020-06-18 13:51:16 Or is that too much to ask for?

general 2020-06-21 04:41:21 This one says it's used by the JASDF
general 2020-06-21 04:41:33 but didn't go into detail as to what fighter it is

general 2020-06-21 04:49:54 no
general 2020-06-21 04:50:02 I have no idea how to do 3d modelling
general 2020-06-21 04:50:50 If I had taken animation during my senior high school I could've been able to learn how to do so
general 2020-06-21 04:53:00 <@!409676438682206218> Even if I learned 3d, I still have to figure out how to import to Clip Studio Paint
general 2020-06-21 04:53:22 CSP being a Japanese product originally, it'll probably take me time to do it
general 2020-06-21 04:53:35 DUde I don't want to go around websites Google Translating Japanese text just to see how people do it
general 2020-06-21 04:56:06 I have Yamato should I join
general 2020-06-21 04:56:11 no wait I wanted to draw tho
general 2020-06-21 05:03:19 ok so uh
general 2020-06-21 05:03:25 the problem with these models
general 2020-06-21 05:03:48 is that I can't render the 3d models into layer because I use a standard edition of CSP
general 2020-06-21 05:04:07 
general 2020-06-21 05:04:20 > draw by hand
exactly what I had in mind

general 2020-06-21 05:13:31 I honestly can't tell if the artist used 3d models or traced the vehicles
general 2020-06-21 05:13:43 There are bits of copy-pasted parts
general 2020-06-21 05:13:48 Probably a mixed
general 2020-06-21 05:26:01 <@!409676438682206218> nvm they have a software available for free that lets you import models from various 3d softwares to clip studio paint

general 2020-06-25 04:20:07 i thought firearms in the catalog are not allowed to have triggers <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
general 2020-06-25 04:20:32 The trigger is the reason why the pink Barrett got yeeted
general 2020-06-25 04:21:25 <@!435946988559925248> iirc, no trigger = gun can't fire; it's a dud and useless, something along the lines of that
general 2020-06-25 04:21:51 and that is why most firearm accessories in the catalog have no triggers
general 2020-06-25 04:22:28 currently there's three of these and I bought one just in case roblox might remove it again lol
general 2020-06-25 04:25:45 wait wasn't there a slowmode a while ago

general 2020-06-25 13:56:48 
general 2020-06-25 13:57:09 tfw modern military rekts fantasy medieval military
general 2020-06-25 13:57:11 😎
general 2020-06-25 13:57:19 I like it because of its theme
general 2020-06-25 13:57:57 Basically, a "gate" opens in Ginza in modern day Japan, which leads to a fantasy world
general 2020-06-25 13:58:45 Is Gate even considered isekai?
general 2020-06-25 13:58:59 Our MC didn't even died nor reincarnated though
general 2020-06-25 13:59:07 ^
general 2020-06-25 13:59:12 that's the problem with Gate
general 2020-06-25 13:59:14 the anime
general 2020-06-25 13:59:59 I heard the animation company behind Gate JSDF is planning for a third season but the problem is there's less material yet on the manga for them to plan out
general 2020-06-25 14:00:05 and the second season ended differently
general 2020-06-25 14:01:21 we're talking about how the Japanese Self Defense-Force went to another world to rekt medieval military
general 2020-06-25 14:01:22 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-06-25 14:02:00 Apparently there's a fanfic of Gate where the gate opens in Russia instead
general 2020-06-25 14:02:05 sadly there's no english translation
general 2020-06-25 14:02:21 Well they considered the other world as part of Japan
general 2020-06-25 14:02:25 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2020-06-25 14:02:47 And our main protagonist is an otaku military dude
general 2020-06-25 14:02:49 <:GWnoneMeguDed:384871020735102978>
general 2020-06-25 14:02:51 like bruh
general 2020-06-25 14:03:13 I kinda want to write my own doujin of Gate where our MC is not an otaku dork
general 2020-06-25 14:03:22 Like, PMC dudes sneaks into the Gate
general 2020-06-25 14:04:48 mocca chan
general 2020-06-25 14:04:50 😳
general 2020-06-25 14:05:09 Use OBS
general 2020-06-25 14:06:11 <@456226577798135808> the most bullshit thing about Gate is that they had a part where a bunch of spec ops from USA, China, and Russia raid the group of our main characters and apparently the JSDF spec ops managed to beat them
general 2020-06-25 14:06:43 Because, the other world contains resources
general 2020-06-25 14:06:50 And Japan is keeping it to themselves
general 2020-06-25 14:06:57 Not letting even UN enter the Gate
general 2020-06-25 14:07:22 because nationalism
general 2020-06-25 14:07:23 also that
general 2020-06-25 14:07:37 900 year old shorty beat spec ops guys

general 2020-06-30 07:59:19 when you see it
general 2020-06-30 08:01:09 i don't know how to draw furries
general 2020-06-30 08:01:14 let alone a protogen or a synth
general 2020-06-30 08:01:24 well to be honest, I forgot HOW to draw furries
general 2020-06-30 08:01:28 i used to do some back in high school
general 2020-06-30 08:21:27 this darn magazine is soooo annoying to clean up
general 2020-06-30 08:21:58 well these parts are messy
general 2020-06-30 08:22:32 bro the holographic sight is cleaner than that magazine
general 2020-06-30 08:23:02 why that image tiny
general 2020-06-30 08:23:09 i thought that's an emote

general 2020-06-30 08:24:10 cleaner compared to the magazine
general 2020-06-30 08:24:43 probablu
general 2020-06-30 08:24:48 but there's a lot of white gaps on the magazine
general 2020-06-30 08:24:50 that I have to manually paint on
general 2020-06-30 08:25:17 the canvas BLEEDS
general 2020-06-30 08:25:19 through the mag
general 2020-06-30 08:25:29 so annoying to fix
general 2020-06-30 08:25:30 askfjkasfkahfwlkflawf
general 2020-06-30 08:26:11 well to be fair the "blood" effect on the mag looks nice
general 2020-06-30 08:26:19 but thats not what im going for
general 2020-06-30 08:26:29 if I put a background, it will bleed through the magazine
general 2020-06-30 08:31:35 i fucking hate this so much

general 2020-06-30 08:31:55 <:GWczoSayoriDed:393085184985268234>

general 2020-06-30 12:53:02 starting to think some mangas uses tools like these 🤔
general 2020-06-30 12:53:10 instead of manually drawing it
general 2020-06-30 12:53:26 i've seen brushes where it literally paints background people for you.
