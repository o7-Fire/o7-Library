plane-crazy 2021-10-17 17:27:21 There is a big difference between them
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 17:27:46 So “not sure” is worrying 👍🏻
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 17:28:13 Rick probably has no idea what he has done
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 17:29:05 I kinda like the update tbh
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 17:29:40 You can tweak them for whatever kind of fight your in
plane-crazy 2021-10-17 17:29:52 Which is nice

bot-central 2022-01-01 00:43:05 -servers
creations-chat 2022-01-22 23:49:18 You literally said “just need to paint it” so technically it’s not finished
creations-chat 2022-01-22 23:51:24 Sounds like your the one making a big thing about it, but that’s just me <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2022-01-22 23:55:59 But he literally said he needs to paint it
creations-chat 2022-01-23 00:01:43 Reasons why you can’t get upvotes: 
1: no paint 
2: you post it when no one is on
3: no one likes it
events-chat 2022-02-05 15:33:49 He is definitely not 13 yet
events-chat 2022-02-05 15:39:55 He says no bombs but classifies it as a bomber
events-chat 2022-02-05 15:55:24 Everyone forgot build pics
events-chat 2022-02-05 17:53:10 Pick me
events-chat 2022-02-05 17:55:07 Yes, me<:trollface:775024642104229898>

events-chat 2022-02-05 23:39:42 I wonder what hars would say
events-chat 2022-02-05 23:41:06 We don’t have 99999 rockets on tracking
events-chat 2022-02-06 16:11:01 You know it’s gonna be good when Gj is picked
events-chat 2022-02-06 16:13:50 Also whatever happened to the mega a10<:empty:794431705070174238>
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:13:54 Well that was predictable
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:17:13 Too ez
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:18:16 WWi planes have rotating guns
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:18:34 And fixed
events-chat 2022-02-06 21:20:56 I don’t think they would do another event just like this one
events-chat 2022-02-07 23:39:53 Did the guy who had the mega a10 ever actually show up to the event
events-chat 2022-02-08 00:10:41 I have a question
events-chat 2022-02-08 00:11:29 Can the controls of the plane change (like wasd or glitched mouse) or does it have to be regular mouse
events-chat 2022-02-08 00:14:41 <@!466793357318815744> answer
events-chat 2022-02-08 00:40:05 It’s already on my plane <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:22:11 Put a conveyor engine on a tank and ram him<:empty:794431705070174238>
events-chat 2022-02-08 01:25:30 I have a feeling the majority of the planes are gonna be do335’s
events-chat 2022-02-08 04:54:49 He made it too good lmao
events-chat 2022-02-08 04:56:57 Yeah, and the biplane only has like a 50% chance of getting a rocket
events-chat 2022-02-08 04:59:27 Plus an extra stabilizer
events-chat 2022-02-08 05:01:29 I use wasd
events-chat 2022-02-08 05:03:06 I made the doof pretty maneuverable though
events-chat 2022-02-08 05:03:26 He has one
events-chat 2022-02-08 05:04:16 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-02-08 22:14:45 No motor lock + you have room on the engine for it
events-chat 2022-02-08 22:31:08 You used wrong engine!!!!!111!!1!1
events-chat 2022-02-08 22:31:50 Your supposed to use the regular prop engine
events-chat 2022-02-08 22:33:28 That’s giant prop
events-chat 2022-02-08 22:33:59 Oh
events-chat 2022-02-08 22:38:32 Yeah we discussed that
events-chat 2022-02-08 23:40:54 Maybe his brain just stopped developing at age 5

creations-chat 2022-03-04 05:12:48 I had to question wether I was going blind or not
