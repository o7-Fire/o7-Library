The Tale of tnsquid (338747388061548556)
creations-chat 2018-11-20 18:35:32 My boat saved as 'Huge freaking boat'. Consists of 2888 blocks so far, and can travel at a speed of only 23 even tho i have about 30 large jet engines. It is capable of landing one small plane (comes with a launchable one) and a small helli. Also features a retractable man overboard ladder and a rotating radar disk at the top. Left side main lounge interior is fully furnished with more furnishing to come in the right lounge (will be a cafe) and the top floor.

creations-chat 2018-11-20 18:45:22 Next up is my working VTOL airliner. It uses 909 blocks and has a fully furnished interior. It flies very well despite of a slight weight imbalance that i am yet to fund the cause of. It works using slow motors attached to vertical facing Super rocket engine for initial lift then can be turned for forwards thrust. This plane is capable of relatively high speed and looks epic when flying. More images coming up.

creations-chat 2018-11-20 19:06:15 This isnt a plane just wanted to share a speed glitch. my avatar flipped out XD
creations-chat 2018-11-20 19:07:29 XD
creations-chat 2018-11-20 19:09:28 technically that's a rank of **Escape velocity** because it says to reach a speed of 226,380 SPS by any means possible
creations-chat 2018-11-20 19:09:58 nope
creations-chat 2018-11-20 19:10:24 for what?
creations-chat 2018-11-20 19:15:36 that wasnt a plane, that was me glitching out like hell because of the high speeds
creations-chat 2018-11-20 19:16:38 this can only end well... a pillar of max speed motors with a huge proppelor
creations-chat 2018-11-20 19:17:24 oh

Request Floating fortress, sea marshal, modeler (has retractable man overboard ladder and spinning radar disc) , lag machine, adept, master engineer.
creations-chat 2018-11-21 16:09:17 I have
creations-chat 2018-11-21 16:10:56 'Modeller | Build a creation that has a unique design. Creation must be 500+ blocks in order to qualify.' The boat has a unique design does it not? and 'Floating Fortress | Build an aircraft carrier capable of landing up to 2 planes on it. Entire flight deck must be above water in order to qualify.' It is capable of landing 2 small planes or 1 med plane and 1 helli
creations-chat 2018-11-21 16:11:23 how :p
creations-chat 2018-11-21 16:11:58 what is not unique about it?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 16:12:20 <@!354786846049566720> jeez that burn
creations-chat 2018-11-21 16:12:43 someone tell me how it isnt unique
creations-chat 2018-11-21 16:13:00 so?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 16:13:46 its 2 boats nailed togeter with a glass lobby, a modern bungalow above that and a runway and hellipad above that.
creations-chat 2018-11-21 16:13:54 ever seen that before?
creations-chat 2018-11-21 16:14:42 if your going to call something not unique for being a boat, then everyone who has a plane isnt unique either, or a sub, car, blimp or most things u can make in this game
creations-chat 2018-11-21 16:15:38 fair enough i need proof that it can land 2 aircraft
creations-chat 2018-11-21 16:17:03 but do i get ranks for sea marshal, engineer and lag machine, as it is a boat consisting of 2888 blocks?
bug-reports 2018-11-21 16:37:00 should i be able to access commands? I wont say how i brought this up just in case its a glitch

help 2018-11-22 15:59:58 I have a question about the  'Inventor' rank. Does the 'unique mechanism' mean is hasn't been done in the game, or doesn't exist irl? I have an idea for a thing that is in real life but to my knowledge hasn't been built in plane crazy
help 2018-11-22 16:03:15 (plz reply with <@!338747388061548556> so i can see the comment)

bug-reports 2018-12-04 16:44:08 I cant do anything but build. When i spawn anything it builds itself in the spawn location as normal, but rather than going in the seat i go one block lower. If i try to get back in the seat it doesn't sit me down and when i click the return button the game has a huge lag spike for about 2 mins before sending me back to the base. When spawning at water it builds itself high above the water and never falls down
