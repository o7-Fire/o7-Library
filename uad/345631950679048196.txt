help 2018-12-01 21:15:06 Can I get ideas on how I would make the frame of a jet that is capable of doing supersonic speeds.
help 2018-12-01 21:19:24 What kind of engines would I use.
help 2019-01-04 03:52:11 I need a good floatplane design to where it doesn't nosedive into the water when you try to fly it out of the water.
help 2019-01-04 03:54:23 
help 2019-01-04 03:57:26 With this plane it's super hard landing in the water without it's front diving in the water and if I do manage to land it in the water it cant fly out without it doing the same.
help 2019-01-04 04:04:46 Still nosedives in the water when I take off in the water
help 2019-01-04 04:09:52 Any seaplane ideas?

help 2019-01-04 08:12:38 I labeled the Ice In blue.
help 2019-01-04 08:26:43 Okay Putting some of the engines in the bottom will keep me afloat when I hit the throttle but it wont necessarily push be out of the water into the air.
help 2019-01-04 08:40:31 I figured it out
help 2019-01-04 08:41:05 Strap 4 super rockets with on/off and you can boost yourself out of the water when you need to.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 03:22:50 How do I make a wheel that has no power but can steer and turn by making contact with the ground?
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 03:23:31 Like a rear-wheel drive car.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 03:25:23 Will it still turn?

plane-crazy 2019-11-18 03:46:34 U wot
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 03:46:44 I that that just changes the texture
