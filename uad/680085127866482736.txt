The Landing gear especially
creations-chat 2022-09-17 20:52:30 It‚Äôs both by default, the gear doesn‚Äôt fold properly into the wing normally but if I try to motor lock it, the wheels are not free, so it just nosedives on takeoff
help 2022-09-18 14:18:32 I‚Äôm trying to build a 2-wide fuselage but I don‚Äôt know how to make this section of the plane flushed as the gap is 0.5x0.5, and the only thing that fits is the small half wedge.
help 2022-09-18 14:25:56 Yeah‚Ä¶.could you maybe elaborate on that? Because I have no idea how to make it fit in a 2-wide space.
help 2022-09-18 14:28:52 Hold on a minut
help 2022-09-18 14:30:12 
help 2022-09-18 14:30:17 There
help 2022-09-18 14:38:13 Well I mean, I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd need a *complicated motor lock for the roof
help 2022-09-18 14:54:09 It kind of works‚Ä¶
help 2022-09-18 14:55:17 Yeah it works
help 2022-09-18 14:55:35 <@733552827342782474> thanks mate
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 19:40:58 Why does every creation that isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶motorlocked to hell and is at least decent get down voted to oblivion?
plane-crazy 2022-09-18 19:42:14 I think you could make pretty decent without a lot of motor locks
creations-chat 2022-09-19 09:57:49 I am in my own hell
creations-chat 2022-09-19 11:52:28 How‚Äôs this for compact landing gear, is it good or bad?
creations-chat 2022-09-19 11:56:34 I don‚Äôt know yet, but in theory it should. This is after all a test rig which should simulate how it works on the aircraft I‚Äôm working on
help 2022-09-19 16:47:00 I‚Äôve been trying for a couple hours now but I have no idea how to make this work
help 2022-09-19 16:49:34 If I make the doors open, the landing gear will look a bit scuffed, but the doors don‚Äôt exactly work because the 1/2cylinders are trying to trying to become one
help 2022-09-19 16:53:07 And well, I did get it working at one point but  uh there‚Äôs quite a substantial gap in the fuselage
help 2022-09-19 16:53:45 Should I just give up
help 2022-09-19 17:09:54 Screw it I‚Äôll go with the scuffed 1-wheel per-side  setup
creations-chat 2022-09-20 00:00:06 I was looking through Supermarine‚Äôs designs and accidentally found some truly weird designs.
The 559 looked pretty cool to me.
creations-chat 2022-09-20 00:09:04 I found it to be a good way to practice multiple motor locks since this build needed a lot of them.
‚Ä¶..Since almost none of you seem to like it, some critiques would be great‚Ä¶.regarding the accuracy. ~~Go complain to vickers if you don‚Äôt like the actual design~~ <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-09-22 00:50:21 I‚Äôve seen worse‚Ä¶
But the centre mounted ailerons are blasphemous, the cockpit could do with some glass and the canards could do with (at least) a slight redesign. Other than that I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs just decent
