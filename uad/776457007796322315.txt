general 2021-08-24 17:46:31 hello
general 2022-12-21 23:43:12 Talking about tanmk I see
general 2022-12-21 23:43:19 Dont get the ATDU
general 2022-12-21 23:43:37 ATDU is bad
general 2022-12-21 23:43:43 Type 90 is the best
general 2022-12-21 23:43:49 Not really
general 2022-12-21 23:44:06 Other than the fact that the ERA on everything is overperforming right now
general 2022-12-21 23:44:29 No longer
general 2022-12-21 23:44:30 I quit
general 2022-12-21 23:44:45 One moment
general 2022-12-21 23:44:48 Im in a wt match
general 2022-12-21 23:51:22 I return
general 2022-12-21 23:51:31 Ill honestly never get people who say CAS is balanced
general 2022-12-21 23:52:19 Its 9.7
general 2022-12-21 23:52:33 Drones, helicopters
general 2022-12-21 23:52:42 Both stupidly overpowered
general 2022-12-21 23:52:49 I play sweden
general 2022-12-21 23:52:52 I am the hellfire user
general 2022-12-21 23:53:20 You see familiar
general 2022-12-21 23:53:34 Ok
general 2022-12-21 23:53:39 I talk a lot there
general 2022-12-21 23:54:00 I went 247 once
general 2022-12-21 23:54:13 R3 with the Oerliken shooting backwards
general 2022-12-21 23:54:24 On the desert map
general 2022-12-21 23:54:26 Left side
general 2022-12-21 23:54:44 You wanna see real speed?
general 2022-12-21 23:56:46 This is speed
general 2022-12-21 23:56:59 Why cant I paste images
general 2022-12-21 23:57:29 I believe this is like George Orwells book 1984
general 2022-12-21 23:58:36 I have full Type 90, Abrams, ATDU, OTOMATIC, T-72A and T-72B3, Challenger 2, and Rooikat
general 2022-12-21 23:58:41 You wanna know what I dont have?
general 2022-12-21 23:58:52 A life
general 2022-12-21 23:58:56 I have that
general 2022-12-21 23:59:10 I also have the Ferret
general 2022-12-21 23:59:17 Then I quit the game because it was boring
general 2022-12-21 23:59:20 And it sucks to play now
general 2022-12-21 23:59:25 Its more unreliable
general 2022-12-21 23:59:34 I missed it because of garbage teammates
general 2022-12-22 00:00:00 I also have all the T10 guns
general 2022-12-22 00:00:19 I used to be good
general 2022-12-22 00:00:26 I would dominate every match
general 2022-12-22 00:00:30 During cold steel
general 2022-12-22 00:00:33 With the type 90 larp
general 2022-12-22 00:00:43 Now? Faux ruined the game
general 2022-12-22 00:01:11 He nerfed it too hard
general 2022-12-22 00:01:18 The reload is now 5.8 seconds
general 2022-12-22 00:01:26 It should be between 2 and 3.8
general 2022-12-22 00:01:32 And the T-72 reload is wayyyyyyyy too long
general 2022-12-22 00:01:52 The T-72 reload is about 9-10 seconds ingame
general 2022-12-22 00:01:56 Realism
general 2022-12-22 00:02:00 Im a type 90 main
general 2022-12-22 00:02:08 The T-72 reload should be 7.5
general 2022-12-22 00:02:38 Its a copy simply for being realistic?
general 2022-12-22 00:02:42 Does that make GHPC a copy?
general 2022-12-22 00:03:01 Realistic =/= war thunder copy
general 2022-12-22 00:03:25 Im so close to my beloved 2A4 in war thunder
general 2022-12-22 00:03:28 I love playing Sweden
general 2022-12-22 00:05:58 They should add the Stridsvagn 122B PLSS to tanmk
general 2022-12-22 00:07:06 It’s literally a better 2A5
general 2022-12-22 00:09:28 I want the Leopard 1A5
general 2022-12-22 00:10:09 If faux prioritized realism over balance the XM274 would be meta
general 2022-12-22 00:11:06 It should technically reload faster
general 2022-12-22 00:11:07 Also
general 2022-12-22 00:11:15 It has 2 APFSDS
general 2022-12-22 00:11:29 XM885 Delta 3 and XM885 Delta 6
general 2022-12-22 00:11:37 Delta 3 is on par with M774
general 2022-12-22 00:11:50 wabble dee
general 2022-12-22 00:12:05 Delta 6 is even more powerful
general 2022-12-22 00:12:14 It also has XM884 HE-VT shells
general 2022-12-22 00:18:54 That’s the Foch
general 2022-12-22 00:18:57 It’s French
general 2022-12-22 00:21:07 I apologize
general 2022-12-22 00:21:12 That’s clearly an M60
general 2022-12-22 00:21:45 What gun does the M1 have I forgor
general 2022-12-22 00:26:13 M1
general 2022-12-22 00:26:17 I think its the M68

general 2022-12-22 00:43:39 10k rp away from the T-72M1
general 2022-12-22 01:05:31 War thunder is almost unplayable
general 2022-12-22 01:06:48 Repairs arent the problem as I am currently maining 2 premium tanks
general 2022-12-22 01:06:54 Its the CAS and Russian bias
general 2022-12-22 01:07:01 Side shotted a TURMS, nonpenned
general 2022-12-22 01:07:22 Earlier I hit a BMD-4, hit the ammo, ammo turned black and disappeared like it shoud
general 2022-12-22 01:07:27 It did not kill him though
general 2022-12-22 01:08:01 Also those goddamn rooks eating 40mm HE-VT shells
general 2022-12-22 01:09:09 Man, playing SPAA is kinda boring
general 2022-12-22 01:21:24 Is that war thunder bro
general 2022-12-22 01:21:43 I wouldnt say war thunder is the most accurate
general 2022-12-22 01:21:52 Especially after what they did to the HSTV-L
general 2022-12-22 01:22:22 I dont think they are even classified
general 2022-12-22 01:22:36 There is public information on the performance of Delta 3 idk about Delta 6
general 2022-12-22 01:22:51 Eugene Stoner even did an interview on the XM274 autocannon

general 2022-12-25 21:34:21 Hey guys, I just want to wish you all a merry Christmas. Discord is full of copy-pasted holiday-themed messages that people don't even read and just forward to other servers. I don't like that. I like to write what i deeply wish and what comes from my heart. Our friendships, from the most deep ones to the most virtual ones are very important and will never be represented by a simple message copied from elsewhere. This being said, I would like to thank all of you. You are the best hockey team I've ever been on.

general 2023-03-26 01:23:13 >”it’s not a tank!”
>”missile tank”
general 2023-03-26 01:23:25 Isn’t that Israeli
general 2023-03-26 01:23:35 All tanks are meant for battle
general 2023-03-26 01:23:36 !!!!!
general 2023-03-26 01:23:38 Idio
general 2023-03-26 01:23:47 Abrams best tank
general 2023-03-26 01:24:08 Abrams better
general 2023-03-26 01:24:15 Well yeah
general 2023-03-26 01:24:20 That’s why the SEP program exists
general 2023-03-26 01:24:28 SEPv3 and v4 are good
general 2023-03-26 01:24:39 v4 gets trophy APS I think
general 2023-03-26 01:25:21 Merkava mid
general 2023-03-26 01:25:23 !!!!!
general 2023-03-26 01:25:40 It’s Israeli so it’s automatically bad
general 2023-03-26 01:26:10 It’s like a Bradley but
general 2023-03-26 01:26:13 Weird
general 2023-03-26 01:26:22 What did they do to it
general 2023-03-26 01:26:35 AbramsX not cool
general 2023-03-26 01:27:05 “Low profile” with a massive RCWS turret
general 2023-03-26 01:27:18 It does look like a Bradley
general 2023-03-26 01:27:22 But it’s all messed up
general 2023-03-26 01:27:46 Get real
general 2023-03-26 01:28:09 Cased telescoping ammo????
general 2023-03-26 01:28:38 The shell is entirely in the casing
general 2023-03-26 01:28:50 Unlike typical ammo where it sticks out the front
general 2023-03-26 01:28:54 It’s easier to store and load
general 2023-03-26 01:29:01 America
general 2023-03-26 01:29:03 Is cooler
general 2023-03-26 01:29:09 And so is Sweden
general 2023-03-26 01:29:29 America made the F-15
general 2023-03-26 01:29:38 It’s a tech demonstrator
general 2023-03-26 01:29:58 How so
general 2023-03-26 01:30:37 Wdym
general 2023-03-26 01:30:46 All those tanks were eastern design
general 2023-03-26 01:31:01 What is your point
general 2023-03-26 01:31:05 That’s russia
general 2023-03-26 01:31:14 Which makes empty promises with its military
general 2023-03-26 01:31:29 AbramsX has APS
general 2023-03-26 01:32:47 America has a history of good tanks
general 2023-03-26 01:32:50 Russia doesn’t
general 2023-03-26 01:33:01 Russia is also crippled since 1991
general 2023-03-26 01:33:35 It is hard to compare tanks
general 2023-03-26 01:33:41 Merkava is the best tank for Israel
general 2023-03-26 01:33:46 Abrams is the best tank for America
general 2023-03-26 01:33:59 Why do they have pizza on their heads
general 2023-03-26 01:34:48 Is it so the Italians don’t eat them
help 2023-03-26 01:36:34 Smelly
general 2023-05-14 17:33:20 Hello
general 2023-05-16 00:19:38 Hello did you know the T-62 was the first production tank to be fitted with a smoothbore gun
general 2023-05-16 00:20:03 The T-64 was the first tank to incorporate composite armor
general 2023-05-16 00:20:38 The Swedish Stridsvagn 103 was the first tank with a gas turbine engine
general 2023-05-16 00:21:10 That’s it for this episode of tank facts
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:27:49 I’m trying to make an IT-1 but every missile design is HUGE
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:30:49 Is that fictional or based off of something
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:33:28 Kinda looks like a T-90 ngl
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:33:50 Like the Maus?
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:33:54 Or the T28
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:34:02 Maus garbage
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:34:12 Germans trying to make a decent tank (they can’t)
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:34:33 I said decent
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:34:45 King tiger was mid
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:34:54 Sherman was the best
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:35:10 You know what else could one shot?
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:35:14 The IS-2
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:35:19 That thing hits a tiger II
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:35:21 It’s out
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:35:29 Which is a terrible idea
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:35:33 They can’t afford pairs lol
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:35:48 Sherman was cheap, light, VERY reliable, decently survivable, and very effective
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:36:45 Some variants had armor that could stand up to the Panther or Tiger
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:36:56 Also Shermans weren’t deployed in pairs
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:37:02 They were deployed in columns
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:37:09 Which where 4 or 5
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:44:37 B-29 in question
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:44:54 The Sherman was ass in less ways than the konigstiger
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:45:00 So slay bestie
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:45:20 So true
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:45:22 Sherman >>>>
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:45:26 (They had crew)
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:45:33 Tiger was slow an unreliable
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:45:49 Sure, it was armed and armored
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:46:14 That’s a bad comparison that skews it for the tiger
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:46:21 1v1 is unrealistic
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:46:28 1v5 is more likely
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:46:57 What if there was an IS-2 with them (the king tiger dies)
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:47:30 That Russian quad color camo
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:48:09 Su-57 drippy as hell
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:49:25 Su-57 vs F-15 who wins
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:49:40 Radar cross section of a normal fighter vs radar cross section of a battleship
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:51:01 It would be cooler if the felon did a cobra in top gun maverick
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:51:17 Instead of a bell maneuver
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:53:59 It would be cooler if the Su-57 exploded for zero reasons
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:55:47 Su-57 pilots when the thing with the radar cross section of a bee launches an AIM-120
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:57:51 Ground or air
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:58:15 Sweden ground is fire
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:58:38 Just don’t play 10.7 and above
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:58:42 Simple as
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 22:58:46 Sweden 10.3 goes hard
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:00:26 My 2060 is still working

plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:05:03 It’s a single player tank game based around like 1985
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:05:05 No
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:05:33 There’s the M1, M1IP, Bradley, BMP-1, BMP-2, T-72M1, and T-55
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 23:05:38 I pirated it
