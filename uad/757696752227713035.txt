general 2023-07-01 21:04:26 alr but fr, new update but, signs are still broken since last year i think, been so long i cant remember anymore, landing gears are also still broken, wheels are still broken, motors still are really weak to the point that all big builds with motors get the little motor wobble, jetpacks are still broken, parachutes are still broken since 2020 if not earlier, and the map still looks the same, the only new thing is that motor hat that cost so much for no reason
general 2023-07-01 21:05:26 thats just 1 bug in the countless others in this doomed game
general 2023-07-01 21:12:05 whats the point of that tho
i thought jetpacks were supposed to make building easier
general 2023-07-01 21:14:33 still happens with the build menu open
general 2023-07-01 21:15:21 jetpack still doesnt come off
general 2023-07-01 21:16:44 exactly
general 2023-07-01 21:16:59 good question
general 2023-07-01 21:17:18 take into account the lack of updates, the only recent update was just a popup telling people to buy a hat
