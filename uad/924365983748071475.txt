plane-crazy 2023-07-18 18:23:45 and perhaps what is thius
creations-chat 2023-07-18 18:24:59 so some guy <@1049435556687380551> was using this to fling people and he could control it, is this a new glitch or just exploits
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 18:28:48 üëç
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 18:37:06 theres this guy in my server and when he spawns in his avatar holds up its hand like its grabbing something and he can fling whatever he built around in any direction
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 18:37:24 like he can just make a mound of cameras and it looks like you are getting flung by an invisible object
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 18:41:15 is that some new glitch or is it just hacks
