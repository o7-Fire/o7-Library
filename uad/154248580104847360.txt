general 2020-03-02 15:02:25 when building
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 19:06:50 does anyone know here
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 19:07:02 if putting two separate winged aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 19:07:10 on a different vehicle on the ground
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 19:07:26 if the weight of the vehicle etc affects the flying characteristics of the plane  itself
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 19:07:35 had two separate missiles on a boat
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 19:07:44 and compared to using the missile singularly
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 19:07:48 they are sluggish
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 19:08:23 this is what i got
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 19:08:23 
plane-crazy 2020-03-10 19:08:29 big difference vs having only one missile
