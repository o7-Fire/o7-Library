general 2020-12-08 08:40:50 abcdef best
general 2020-12-08 08:41:30 Then why are we sticking to qwerty when we got digital keyboards
general 2020-12-08 08:41:40 Modern*
general 2020-12-08 08:42:37 I heard that old telegram uses qwerty because abcdef style would jam it
general 2020-12-08 08:43:26 Hang on imma look at google
general 2020-12-08 08:45:01 Google says that people switch to the qwerty partially because the abcdef would result in a jamming issue but its also to increase typing speed
general 2020-12-08 08:45:24 Wiki
general 2020-12-08 08:45:35 What?

general 2020-12-08 08:47:46 I can't, I'm too stupid
general 2020-12-08 08:48:31 Look it also says that its partially due to jamming issues
general 2020-12-08 08:48:55 Omg
general 2020-12-08 08:50:01 If I remember that capital letters and non capital get jammed on each other while using abcdef configuration but I might be wrong, I forgot the video explaining it
general 2020-12-08 08:51:05 I'm used to abcdef a bit more
general 2020-12-08 08:51:23 Not that greatly tho
general 2020-12-08 08:51:40 No
general 2020-12-08 08:51:48 I'm just sticking to my preference

the-dump 2020-12-08 13:58:01 Thomas isnt what he used to be, he is a completely different man or *entity*
the-dump 2020-12-08 13:59:40 Man cartoons are falling out this year, first butch Hartman desperate for views and now thomas
the-dump 2020-12-08 14:00:25 We are having a conversation about the fall of Thomas the tank engine
the-dump 2020-12-08 14:01:15 Alright continue, who is leading Thomas the tank engine now
the-dump 2020-12-08 14:01:26 Because thats gotta be a different guy
the-dump 2020-12-08 14:03:50 He is a bit cartoony even for a kid above 9
