plane-crazy 2020-10-04 04:51:30 very cool
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 04:52:30 i'm trying to make it smaller so i can make my t-90 actually look nice
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 04:56:28 why, what would motor locking help with the suspension?
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 05:27:11 i'm still trying to figure out how to make my suspension smaller
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 05:27:54 i mean, could you give me an idea on how motorlocking would work with tank suspensions?
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 05:28:10 cause right now, it's super bulky

plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:21:27 pain
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:22:14 i'm building a very big tank
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:22:24 the thermals are the giveaway if you guys are smart enough
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:30:42 that doesn't help
