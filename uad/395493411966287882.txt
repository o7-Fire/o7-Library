creations-chat 2019-11-08 19:10:47 true, but I still like to build big

help 2020-04-04 17:32:55 i would just like to ask one question to anyone who is familiar with the rules. 
So, i have built the german P.1000 ratte. I am planing to put the German cross (not the other German symbol which i know is illegal in this server) but i'm not sure if it is appropriate.
