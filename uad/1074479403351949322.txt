creations-chat 2023-06-12 22:13:08 Not sure if this is going to embed or not but I'm working on a Boeing 707 with the American Airlines livery

Edit: removed the photos cuz they were old and it was when my plane was a wip
plane-crazy 2023-06-12 22:26:13 I can relate, I once joined a server where after some time the majority of the people in the game left and were replaced by both Korean and Arabic users

plane-crazy 2023-06-18 20:03:06 What plane should I try making? I've already made a Boeing 707-123 and a Douglas DC-9-10
general 2023-07-05 19:52:30 breeze through the competition
general 2023-07-05 19:52:48 exactly
general 2023-07-05 19:53:36 My first serious build was a 707 although the cabin isn't 100%  accurate and the landing gear is just as bad
general 2023-07-05 19:53:45 How about you ppl
general 2023-07-06 16:59:28 I downloaded the photo before you deleted it
general 2023-07-08 05:12:12 We're gonna be able to convert creations to PC2 ðŸ˜¨
general 2023-07-08 05:12:19 This is going to be cool
general 2023-07-08 05:12:36 I only just found out, don't be hard on me :/
general 2023-07-08 05:12:58 Hopefully the build plots in PC2 will be bigger idk if anything about that was said

general 2023-07-12 15:40:49 Carnival Sinkage
general 2023-07-12 15:42:36 ðŸ˜¢
general 2023-07-12 15:43:08 But I am
general 2023-07-12 15:44:01 I don't identify as an animal...
general 2023-07-12 15:46:15 If you have a problem with me, then you can simply ignore my account or block me. It's that simple ðŸ™‚
general 2023-07-12 15:58:02 I hate them too.
general 2023-07-12 16:00:54 I'm pretty sure that's not going to resolve anything.
general 2023-07-12 16:03:59 They'll just make a new account with a VPN.
general 2023-07-12 16:04:07 They always come back.
general 2023-07-12 16:07:05 Sell for parts
general 2023-07-12 16:15:37 I really want the map to be open world
general 2023-07-12 17:25:02 Maybe
general 2023-07-13 03:42:11 wtf is that plane
general 2023-07-13 03:42:50 looks like the tutorial plane
general 2023-07-15 03:44:06 Some of the people in here are fucking assholes
general 2023-07-15 03:45:45 I just ignore people who try to fuck with me because I don't give a shit about how funny you think you are, nobody's laughing but me because you idiots look dumb as hell
general 2023-07-15 03:49:41 I tried building an A300 but I fucked up the length and it looks really short 
Gonna fix it tomorrow, might post, idk how long it will take though.
general 2023-07-15 03:51:41 My first few passenger planes were BAD...
general 2023-07-15 04:02:53 what
general 2023-07-15 04:03:29 I thought that was your thing...
general 2023-07-15 04:17:26 I hate how the motors on my A300's wings glitch out and make my ping reach 50k

The plane isn't even done yet and I'm still adding flaps to the jet
general 2023-07-15 04:17:31 Anyone relate to this
general 2023-07-15 04:19:54 Pretty sure that's not a good thing to do
general 2023-07-15 04:20:53 imagine someone just spams antisemitic stuff on his account and he gets ip banned oml
creations-chat 2023-07-16 00:52:11 Your mini modding is annoying.
creations-chat 2023-07-16 00:54:14 Neither do I.
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 00:55:44 Rate the current progress on my Airbus A300-B4
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 00:55:52 Is it good or is it mid
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 00:58:22 This is the livery it's supposed to have

The plane isn't finished so I'll definitely be making adjustments to it.
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 00:59:03 It's missing part of the back which is why I took a ss from that angle
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 01:00:28 The wings are really crammed and I can't fit large amounts of motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 01:00:51 It's not done
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 01:02:29 Clearly you missed the point of my post
general 2023-07-17 02:25:38 Who's that dude from announcements
general 2023-07-17 02:40:56 Who even likes Deadpool omg
general 2023-07-17 02:43:09 Now please tell me how many people play roblox monthly

general 2023-07-17 02:44:58 <:noway:1021283202561744977>
general 2023-07-17 02:45:58 I'm willing to bet KonekoKitten will lose interest in Roblox by 2024
