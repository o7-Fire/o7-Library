plane-crazy 2021-02-05 00:11:26 *at least it wasnt rick roll*
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 00:43:22 well we do need a limit of all blocks
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 00:43:40 but maybe 2k is a bit much **for literally every single block**
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 00:44:03 ?
creations-chat 2021-02-05 03:01:47 u lads got any feedback on me wirbel?
creations-chat 2021-02-14 01:38:40 well i want everything to be accurate and thats what i could come up with
maybe it may change some time or maybe not. idk
creations-chat 2021-02-14 01:51:20 ye ill agree on that. im not good at taking good pics like u guys are lmao
creations-chat 2021-02-14 01:54:35 *mhm ima try again once i finish consooming f00d*
creations-chat 2021-02-14 02:10:38 wat would u think now?
creations-chat 2021-02-14 02:38:12 welp maybe something with the barrel is the tank's biggest problem then
creations-chat 2021-02-14 02:45:37 yes
creations-chat 2021-02-14 02:48:02 oh.... dang its apparently the same length as the tank itself XD
ima go ahead and decrease the length now
creations-chat 2021-02-14 02:55:44 alr now i plan to remake the barrel but its decreased by 5 blocks this time and it actually looks more fitting
creations-chat 2021-02-14 03:58:44 we need more tanks
creations-chat 2021-02-18 10:10:42 anything i could improve on this type 5 heavy tho?
creations-chat 2021-02-18 10:17:49 did that üôÇ
creations-chat 2021-02-18 10:21:26 welcome aboard
creations-chat 2021-02-18 10:51:52 HOLLYY
creations-chat 2021-02-19 07:21:21 
creations-chat 2021-03-02 06:46:09 -see, i didnt want to replace the main gun with sparklers because i did that with the secondary gun on the side and i dont want them to be the same size
i agree with u on the other suggestions tho. ill get to working on it so it can be as accurate as possible. thanks for these suggestions too
creations-chat 2021-03-03 11:22:05 wat u guys think of my centauro mgs? its still a wip ofc cuz i gotta add the machine guns and crap but i wanna know if i did well enough so far?
creations-chat 2021-03-03 11:31:59 Yeah thats like some of the few things i need to add still...
creations-chat 2021-03-03 23:04:45 ye i have no idea how i can hide some of that motor lock crap in a barrel with limited space...
creations-chat 2021-03-03 23:12:58 yeah ill try to add more stuff although there isnt really alot on the actual tank itself
ill give it a bit of work tho
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 00:09:32 why arent my stuff saving properly?
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 00:10:46 yeah i do
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 00:10:53 but its like stuff is just loading up weird
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 00:11:04 i loaded up one of my tanks and my sparklers on the cannon was sideways
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 00:11:14 then i loaded up another and some blocks werent painted
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 00:11:33 theres no way i couldve done some mess like that...
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 00:11:39 probably.... idk
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 00:11:54 bit weird tho and hopefully, no blocks start going missing :/
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 00:13:04 ye maybe it might just be some temporary glitch..
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 00:54:45 bruh i need more slots already XD
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 00:54:51 i have just 2 left
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 00:55:25 yeee..... but i like to get into all my builds on 1 account
creations-chat 2021-03-09 07:28:50 bill nye the science guy

plane-crazy 2021-03-24 00:53:30 am dum
creations-chat 2021-03-25 22:03:16 so uh.... anyone can explain this new trend in <#384025409945337856> tho..?
creations-chat 2021-03-25 22:23:10 o god...
creations-chat 2021-04-29 20:52:45 hm i could try... i never really use materials like that on tanks tbh
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:04:15 wtf is astrocraft
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 09:33:44 anyone got an idea of wat tank i should create next?
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 09:34:08 hmm sounds like a good idea
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 09:34:29 i may make it then
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 10:51:45 easy
creations-chat 2021-05-20 13:30:07 wats wrong with it?
creations-chat 2021-05-20 13:32:23 lmao i dont even know. child's weird
creations-chat 2021-05-20 13:36:08 ill try... had just got done and wanted to see wat ppl's feedback would be
creations-chat 2021-05-20 13:39:31 dang.. sounds like either i need a re-do or just not make another kv2 at all ig...
creations-chat 2021-05-20 13:43:03 alr ill give that a try then. and ngl, i rly have trouble finding a good color for tanks so yeah... that may explain the trashy color
creations-chat 2021-05-20 13:48:48 o well thanks! thats just how this server works tbh but i barely care for a dislike. i just want to get feedback
the likes i get is also nice to see too
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:07:29 not funny and it rly wasnt even that horrible if it still gets upvotes from some people
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:09:45 again since u cant read, i said i just posted it after i was done with it for feedback. not as a final product....
also u rly dont have to be rude like that tbh
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:11:47 mk but still. just saying u shouldnt have to go as far as saying its a "kaka-v2" its was highly uncalled for and i never said anything bad to u
creations-chat 2021-05-20 16:18:02 ok i gave my kv2 a bit of an upgrade as far as with color and other small stuff.
creations-chat 2021-05-20 16:29:27 anyone wanna provide feedback tho on my kv2 after i improved it?
creations-chat 2021-05-20 16:32:18 ye i try to hide it <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-05-21 15:20:49 ko
creations-chat 2021-05-25 16:36:53 good looking type 59 so far or needs work?
creations-chat 2021-05-25 16:39:09 ph yeah i havent connected those just yet so they fell off but when i do, youll probs see about half of it since theyre like front wheels
creations-chat 2021-05-25 16:52:34 i wonder wat kind of color should i rly go for tho...
creations-chat 2021-05-25 16:59:03 meh that can work then
creations-chat 2021-05-25 22:30:15 well if i did add another wheel, it would make the tank longer and i was thinking by then, itll be too long for its width
also i could agree with that turret problem. may fix it tomorrow though
creations-chat 2021-05-25 22:37:20 *oop rip...* i kinda just do the front first then the wheels here
creations-chat 2021-05-26 01:14:36 hotels tend to be bigger than motels
creations-chat 2021-05-26 01:17:24 basically yeah
creations-chat 2021-05-26 13:35:17 looks better than my type-59 post from yesterday?
creations-chat 2021-05-26 13:38:41 *couldnt think of a better one soo o well*
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 14:12:59 can u actually do resposts in <#384025409945337856>?
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 14:13:24 oof rip then lul
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 14:16:56 also i asked this in the feedback channel too but what u guys think of this tank?
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 14:17:56 Type-59
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 14:18:14 maybe not lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 14:19:16 yeah thats true lol. almost no differences between the 2 either
creations-chat 2021-05-26 22:56:16 un-ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 02:33:44 U guys think i should try and build a bradley next ~~even tho my recents tanks just been trashed on in creations~~?
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 02:34:15 Aight ill give it a go
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 02:35:29 Yea thats true. At this point, i rather let ppl in the game itself tell me if its good or not
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 02:35:58 Expectations are kinda too high here imo
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 02:37:00 Cant. Dont have that type of skill yet where my entire plot is filled with motors or smth
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 02:37:29 It depends
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 02:38:39 Thats true but its more preferred to use it tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 02:38:52 I can see why too but its like wow..
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 02:39:53 Onoo
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 02:39:59 U ping1111
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 11:24:44 POV: ur in a good server
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 11:30:25 thats true lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 11:30:45 the gray one is the best tho ngl
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 11:31:49 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 11:31:51 yes he is
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 11:33:02 the camo one is even more of an accomplishment tbh
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 11:37:28 in the pic i posted
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 11:41:53 nope
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 18:14:29 welp ima take a break but this is my M3A3 bradley so far
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 18:14:39 wat u guys think?
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 18:14:44 or think needs work?
creations-chat 2021-05-28 19:37:29 any thoughts on this future M3A3 Bradley?
also, idk if this paint is good enough. i just tried to copy war thunder's original paint scheme
creations-chat 2021-05-28 19:43:14 makes me wish i still had my guns <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2021-05-28 19:57:53 accurate except not in my case cuz i got no planes
creations-chat 2021-05-29 16:01:02 thats just gonna be harder to work with a smaller turret tbh considering it was a challenge trying to cram a bunch of motors and stuff within my current one and also, that turret kinda looks smaller than what i used
creations-chat 2021-05-29 16:46:11 how do u run that on mobile? lmao
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 04:37:50 hmmm should i attempt to build an m56 scorpion next bois?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 05:01:27 yeh ill give it a go then
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 05:01:35 eh.. too common
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:03:53 any of u ppl know exactly how to make the ERA that tends to be on tanks like the T-72B?
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:04:42 any. doesnt matter as long as they have that ERA thats on the turret
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:04:52 thats wat i wann try and understand
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:05:41 oh thats wat theyre called
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:06:39 how bout say on a B3. how can u do it?
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:07:02 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:07:30 not the entire ofc. just how do u place the cutters or whatever like how it is on the tank
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:08:41 darn.... i thought it may be done by camera locking
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:08:55 hm
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:09:11 i could. the issue is that i dont really have any experience with camera locking
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:09:20 i just know it exists lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:09:56 mhmm stuff like that is wat i wanna do
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:11:04 yeah it looks good too ngl. both of the tanks do
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:11:24 hm i suppose the solution is that i have a skill issue in camera locking
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:12:17 eh same. but i somewhat developed to a point where my builds looks like a literal tower of motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 21:16:37 nope
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 00:52:08 any advice to improve this?
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 00:56:19 ill try to see wat i can do for its color
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 00:56:55 also think i may re-do the front of the turret cuz it seems too sloped
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 00:59:55 its the same on both sides
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 01:03:52 both of the turret cheeks are built basically the same as each other pretty much
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 02:16:05 No <:troll:842209857897758723>
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 20:22:37 someone knows a great vid for talking about camera lock?
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 20:24:30 a video that teaches camera lock
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 20:37:49 alr ill check it out
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 05:27:56 trying to re-do my abrams but its my first time doing custom angles. how's my work?
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 05:29:54 hows mine?
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 05:35:03 oh i didnt notice anything wrong at first
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 09:59:03 ok so this is the re-worked abrams so far
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 09:59:24 thanks for that!
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 08:50:22 guess this is the front so far. any thoughts (yes imma work on the barrel too)
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 08:55:21 yea i said ima get to work on that
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 08:56:51 its just the front for now. wanted some thoughts on it
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 08:57:04 tmr ima do the back, paint, and post in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 08:57:18 yeah same. wish i could fix it
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 09:00:41 nah cuz the control surfaces will only stick to the block under the rockets
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 09:01:41 <:perhaps:691862257990107176>
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 09:02:38 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 09:33:44 eh its a common mispell. i used to say turrent before too lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 09:35:57 cant. alot of my current motors and blocks would block the turret from rotating if i motor lock the entire turret
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 09:37:32 yea he probably just didn't know how to spell it right. idk
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 09:37:46 but ye. correct spelling is turret
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 09:42:22 here ill show ya what i mean
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 09:44:25 so like if i motor lock it even half a block down, all those motors u see rn will block the turret's rotation
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 10:00:20 pretty much yea. its the base of the motor that will screw the entire thing up.
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 10:01:40 how was that even possible
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 10:02:52 yeah its alr. i even did a test run with ur idea and to no surprise, the entire tank just flung itself lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 10:03:08 makes sense
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 10:15:09 yeah this isnt rly quite easy to explain at this point
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 10:34:33 very true
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 10:35:12 itll get to a point where yters will have to start putting (not releasing a tutorial) on the video's title
creations-chat 2021-07-13 19:51:02 its no where near a tutorial. do u want to see it in build mode?
creations-chat 2021-07-13 19:53:11 what should i fix on the abrams tho since it has more downvotes than upvotes?
creations-chat 2021-07-13 19:55:25 ??
creations-chat 2021-07-13 23:45:45 True that boat is super hard to make man
creations-chat 2021-07-13 23:58:14 my plane is pro because it has motor lock üòé

creations-chat 2021-07-14 00:28:07 many questionable things happen in this community...
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 04:04:13 hmm wat is a tank i should make next?
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 04:04:50 preferrably something that isnt too commonly seen
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 04:14:52 honestly i have never heard of that tank
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 04:16:34 good logic.

plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:02:33 yeah ima try. i never even tested trying to do something like this but i have an idea of how to do it
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:30:06 i meant T-80BVM lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:30:24 i get confused by the 2's numbers

plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:32:18 idk. never cared about it tbh
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:32:24 well
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:32:27 ik how u get them
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:32:59 if im not wrong, u need like enough upvotes on a creation related to the role ur going for
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:33:26 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:33:37 it tells u in one of these channels

plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:35:05 hmm its probably in the rank-requests
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:47:18 ahhh alr gotcha

plane-crazy 2021-08-17 00:48:29 im somehow on a noob level for jets but imo, a good level for making tanks
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 01:18:51 hmmm this turret looks a little too small for this hull does it...
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 01:23:22 u suggest i shouldnt make the wedges up top half wedges?
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 01:27:55 wedge 2 made it look ugly so ima try to do wedge 3
