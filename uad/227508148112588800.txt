plane-crazy 2019-09-09 04:56:32 i dont have a rank so im just gonna say it here xd
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 04:56:41 we need engine bloccs in the game
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 04:57:01 makes engines more powerful when adjacent
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 04:57:04 to one
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 04:57:22 and theyre kinda like meshes so you cant spam them
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 04:57:29 and theres a limit
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 04:57:58 so only like two engine bloccs for a propellor
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 04:58:19 good plan yes
creations-chat 2019-09-09 05:02:21 hitlers pool noodle
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 05:03:01 well you see that kind of oofs things up and i dont know about you but i dont like that
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 05:03:45 engine bloccs wont be too powerful maybe theyd add like 30 more studs of thrust to a propellor xd

creations-chat 2019-09-12 20:44:52 
creations-chat 2019-09-12 20:46:06 still figuring out how to get it in the air, the blue and yellow spheres arent very close together and that kinda oofs my build
creations-chat 2019-09-12 20:46:26 though i think having the wings bend down a bit sorta helps
creations-chat 2019-09-12 20:46:50 and the second photo is when i removed the single rudder and added two to the tips of the elevator wings
creations-chat 2019-09-12 20:46:56 also to try to help xd
creations-chat 2019-09-12 20:48:38 maybe i should add a ton of static cargo to the back to try to balance weight ðŸ¤”

creations-chat 2021-07-11 00:12:05 shredder bugs are a cancerous growth that will never die
creations-chat 2021-07-11 00:14:53 maybe next time build something other than a shredder and people might actually like what you make

imagine being unable to handle any sort of criticism whatsoever when you literally post your creation in a place where you can and will receive criticism
creations-chat 2021-07-11 00:18:16 yeah everyone here is definitely racist for giving you criticism

look bro if u cant handle this then dont post at all ez as that

uh oh death threats? sounds like someones not right in the head
creations-chat 2021-07-11 00:21:48 the adurite man has some serious anger issues to be getting this mad over people not liking his shredder bug build
