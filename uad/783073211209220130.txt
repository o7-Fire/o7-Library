general 2021-07-13 17:55:14 Wait what happened?
general 2021-07-13 17:55:25 What happened?
general 2021-09-08 01:58:13 This person is trolling me in PC ðŸ’€
general 2022-02-06 01:11:13 What are those tutorial cars called that fling your vehicle?
general 2022-02-06 01:11:24 One of them just crashed my game.
general 2022-02-15 02:10:55 Is it against the rules to fling people in non-pvp mode?
general 2022-02-19 19:05:10 It's working for me
general 2022-02-19 19:05:52 I AM IN PC RN
general 2022-02-19 19:05:56 IT IS BACK
general 2022-04-02 15:56:37 Oh okay so I'm not the only glitched person then
general 2022-04-02 15:57:13 I have a screenshot of the glitch. I can DM if anyone wants to see it.
general 2022-04-02 16:14:35 Do we know what is causing the issues?
general 2022-04-02 16:16:13 Since when was social privilege defined by name colour?
general 2022-04-02 16:17:52 Since when was complaining acceptable in an argument about something completely different?
general 2022-04-02 16:20:09 I don't understand why you are picking on me. What did I do? I've had this username since I started playing Roblox. Let me check the year.
general 2022-04-02 16:21:28 2016-04-10 is when I joined. I have never changed the username. ALSO THE GAME IS WORKING NOW. YAY.
general 2023-02-25 22:25:44 Are reports regarding people lagging a server allowed?
general 2023-02-25 22:27:51 It says that it matches the criteria though.
general 2023-02-25 22:28:27 damn
general 2023-02-25 22:28:50 okay
general 2023-02-25 22:43:57 Question: is the altitude in plane crazy in studs?
general 2023-02-25 22:44:40 oh so that is why
general 2023-02-25 22:45:03 how long is one sandwich?
general 2023-02-25 22:48:00 I am making a bomb sight so I need to know the altitude units but I am finding that the gravitational acceleration is around 95 to 100 studs/second^2.
general 2023-07-01 20:08:10 I got the hat. I panicked so bad.
general 2023-07-01 20:08:26 Rick just made 100K robux
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 01:48:41 I can't even get the letter C onto a 1x1 text with the game tagging it. It is making me frustrated.
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 01:49:26 Does anyone have advice on how to get around this issue?
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 01:50:03 I'll try, thanks.
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 01:51:36 Thank you so much. I was really concerned that this issue would doom a project I have been working on for 2 weeks.
general 2023-07-07 19:43:44 The hat is too expensive imo
