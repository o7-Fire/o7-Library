general 2022-09-23 12:41:06 Can someone help? My ROBLOX site has almost every image replaced with a yellow image. (would show screenshot but lack the permissions). This includes game thumbnails, catalog items, website ads, player profile icons etc, it's almost everything. (certain catalog items will load perfectly with no apparent pattern.)
The issue persists on chrome despite turning off all my extensions, reinstalling chrome, restarting laptop, resetting all my data on chrome. This doesn't happen in Microsoft edge however.
general 2022-09-23 12:41:20 (i'm not a bot this is a genuine issue)
general 2022-09-23 12:41:33 It literally looks like that
the-dump 2022-09-23 12:41:52 
general 2022-09-23 12:42:19 I posted a screenshot in <#495286269459300364>
the-dump 2022-09-23 12:43:11 
the-dump 2022-09-23 12:43:29 ^^
the-dump 2022-09-23 12:43:52 I've had these extensions long before this started happening
the-dump 2022-09-23 12:44:02 Tried that
the-dump 2022-09-23 12:44:05 it still persists
the-dump 2022-09-23 12:44:27 I've looked thru task manager for suspicious looking executables aswell
the-dump 2022-09-23 12:48:58 How have I been hacked excusivly on chrome tho
the-dump 2022-09-23 12:49:07 Since it's fine on edge on the same account
the-dump 2022-09-23 12:49:22 
the-dump 2022-09-23 12:49:28 
the-dump 2022-09-23 12:49:45 I flicked them all to OFF
the-dump 2022-09-23 12:49:54 Would I need to uninstall them
the-dump 2022-09-23 12:50:27 from control panel or is there an uninstall executable for it?
the-dump 2022-09-23 12:51:14 
the-dump 2022-09-23 12:51:16 Do I delete browsing data?
the-dump 2022-09-23 12:51:40 <@297120728342331392>

general 2022-09-23 12:56:06 ticking that box did it
general 2022-09-23 12:56:36 far better than whatever I've done
general 2022-09-23 12:57:14 I can't even get my head around folding builds
general 2022-09-23 12:57:22 and I want to be an engineer irl
general 2022-09-23 12:58:05 It'd be either electrical, mechanical or aeronautical
general 2022-09-23 12:58:26 If everything goes to plan I'd be going to ADFA (Australian defence force acadamy)
general 2022-09-23 12:58:35 but I'm leaning towards mech/electrical incase I leave
general 2022-09-23 12:58:52 since aeronautical won't be very high demand in the civilian market
general 2022-09-23 12:59:06 wot
general 2022-09-23 12:59:26 Almost any kind of engineering is LUCRATIVE in Western Australia
general 2022-09-23 12:59:33 since there's shiny rocks EVERYWHERE
general 2022-09-23 13:00:03 (mainly in the north but enough to be the largest exporter of iron ore in teh world)
general 2022-09-23 13:00:40 Australia like
general 2022-09-23 13:00:45 blows everyoen out the park aswell

general 2022-09-23 13:01:27 yeh
general 2022-09-23 13:01:43 7/8 depending on if daylight savings has happened
general 2022-09-23 13:01:47 cause WA doesn't do it

general 2022-09-23 13:04:10 it's iron ore exports by country
general 2022-09-23 13:04:56 Not so fun fact!
general 2022-09-23 13:05:09 Australia is kind of benefiting from COVID and natural distasters
general 2022-09-23 13:05:22 Brazil decided to open a bunch of new iron ore mines
general 2022-09-23 13:05:30 when you ask
general 2022-09-23 13:05:33 Jan 2020
general 2022-09-23 13:05:49 yk who was worst his with covid initially?

general 2022-09-23 13:06:11 it would be Brazil
general 2022-09-23 13:06:24 They spent billions on fancy new mines
general 2022-09-23 13:06:31 then couldn't use them for 2 years
general 2022-09-23 13:06:44 that and it's just better
