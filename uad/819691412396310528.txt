plane-crazy 2021-05-23 19:21:00 I found a bug involving hover thrusters, can someone verify it?
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 19:21:40 yeah, someone confirm it's not just a me issue
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 19:22:42 basically, if you  stack a lot of hover thrusters on top of each other, the thrusters explode and stay in the air for some reason, instead of falling back down (they float much higher than the normal max altitude)
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 19:22:57 I know, very specific
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 19:23:19 but very noticable
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 19:23:53 no?
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 19:24:03 But not intended?
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 19:24:23 Why does it happen?
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 19:24:47 possibly
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 19:25:01 but shouldn't thrusters have mass?
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 19:25:55 nut there is no thrust, sometimes they are facing straight down with the blue side up
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 19:26:03 but*
