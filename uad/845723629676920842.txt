general 2023-03-18 04:44:31 phsyco
general 2023-03-18 04:45:07 yes it is a very relaxing, yet brain teasing game when you get into it.
general 2023-03-18 04:45:39 you havent even played it
general 2023-03-18 04:46:15 because you didnt have the mental capacity to figure out logic?
general 2023-03-18 04:46:51 this is the only person on this server that knows what they're talking abt

general 2023-03-18 05:25:54 interesting
general 2023-03-18 05:26:53 lemme post one of my builds
bot-central 2023-03-18 05:41:27 oo

plane-crazy 2023-03-18 06:52:54 Yuh
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 06:53:16 Hmm
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 06:53:21 Yes show
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 06:53:36 Hm
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 06:53:47 Can you put it any closer to the centre?
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 06:53:53 Of the build
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 06:54:07 How wide is it?
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 06:54:15 The build itself I mean
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 06:54:31 And the motorlock?
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 06:54:51 Hmm
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 06:55:31 Is it a tower? Or is it just a line of angled locks going diagonally
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 06:56:24 One sec
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 06:59:07 
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 06:59:14 Does this help
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 06:59:31 Does your lock look like the top or bottom one
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:03:25 If my ‚Äúterrible‚Äù art is unrecognizable then I can tell you what each of them are
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:03:44 The top one is a diagonal line of motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:03:59 And the bottom one is a basic motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:04:09 And thank you
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:04:29 nope
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:04:37 
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:04:41 Look what I‚Äôm drawing

plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:08:41 Oh haha that‚Äôs cool
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:09:14 Lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:10:03 Isn‚Äôt that just some disconnectors?
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:10:13 Oh I see it now
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:10:23 Sorry bad eyes
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:11:08 Are you trying to motorlock like a door or a side of something on?
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:11:28 Oh haha
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:11:32 Uhm
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:11:51 Put the motorlock back into the build by 1 block
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:11:56 If you can
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:12:28 Then place a cylinder to connect the piece you were trying to the cover the motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:13:03 Np
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:13:23 Oh I see
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:13:32 You‚Äôll get better in time

plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:14:24 Alrighty
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:14:38 Hm?
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:15:06 It will
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:15:08 But
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:15:16 Make that block a 0.9 block
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:15:27 So it doesn‚Äôt touch the motor
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:15:38 And the other side Aswell
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:15:44 I see it touching
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:15:45 Np
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:17:50 Oh that‚Äôs good to hear
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:17:55 Your welcome
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 07:18:51 Did you? Or was that sarcasm. I‚Äôm not good with sarcasm over text

creations-chat 2023-03-18 16:56:22 Hello all
creations-chat 2023-03-18 16:59:46 I helped some person with their build last night, they had exposed lock in the side and were asking around, so I gave them a hand and their build is looking good now.
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:01:52 Hahah, I remember those days, the first jet I built was an F-15e and I wish I still had the build.
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:05:56 Should I post my one wide heli with a very thin tail structure (made of angled trails)?
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:13:57 My 1 wide heli
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:19:19 Thank you so much! The way I make my heli‚Äôs is I add ballast to the bottom and helium at the top (thus the big round thingy on the rotor head)
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:21:27 It flies very well. No roll or anwanted spin, and a tip: if you set the hover engines to max drag it adds a. Lot of stability, very useful.
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:23:30 No no, you can copy it all you want, I‚Äôm here to help the community not to keep secrets.
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:26:32 C ya later!

help 2023-03-22 05:30:31 and if it has motorlock, check that all motors that you want to be locked are locked.
help 2023-03-22 05:31:55 And if it has camera‚Äôs (for an unnoticeable piece) make sure any camera‚Äôs aren‚Äôt pointed to another block, it will cause unwanted camera lock/angle.
help 2023-03-22 05:32:15 If that helps : )
help 2023-03-22 05:41:01 Hmm
help 2023-03-22 05:41:23 Did you try anchoring it with physics?
help 2023-03-22 05:41:41 Try that
help 2023-03-22 05:41:58 Also, does your build fling you before it locks?
help 2023-03-22 05:42:41 Weird
help 2023-03-22 05:44:32 Do you fling up or in a random direction
help 2023-03-22 05:45:22 Yes as in a random direction?

creations-chat 2023-03-23 01:53:00 Nice turrets.    Would give an upvote if I could
creations-chat 2023-03-23 01:55:28 Have you tried a bigger ship before? With locking the deck into the hull to make more room, very useful
creations-chat 2023-03-23 01:59:54 I‚Äôm working on a 1:1 scale IJN Kongo battleship
creations-chat 2023-03-23 02:02:11 This is the progress so far, got all the folds for the hull.      222 blocks long and 31 wide
creations-chat 2023-03-23 02:04:24 It will be the older config, 1920‚Äôs. I think it looks a lot better, and I dont know how people don‚Äôt like the ‚Äúpagoda mast‚Äù
creations-chat 2023-03-23 02:08:57 Yes that is the one. The rear mast is simple but the main mast will be a little challenging, especially 1:1
creations-chat 2023-03-23 02:11:54 Thanks for your patience. It will be quite a while (maybe 2 months or more‚Ä¶) since I am working on a 3:1 scale EMD SD70ace diesel train that goes on the rails.
creations-chat 2023-03-23 02:15:18 I will definitely have to see that when it‚Äôs finished. Sounds like a fun project. And thanks for the good luck : )

plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:09:05 Set to physics on
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:09:19 And you can move /lock builds
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:10:34 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:10:38 Well*
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:10:49 Sort of
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:11:17 If you have 3 folds and the anchor is on the middle fold then the side folds will fold
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:11:23 But the middle will stay put
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:11:42 Do you not know folding
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:12:01 Do you know motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:12:14 Do you know it
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:12:23 Eh
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:12:32 Sorta
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:12:53 
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:12:53 This is my ship with 5 folds
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:13:16 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:13:31 I have my anchor block in the middle
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:13:37 Middle section
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:13:54 So the front and back fold out
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:15:08 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:15:51 Try making a dual rotor mechanism inside of it with differing rotor angle for a different height
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:16:25 Or even simpler
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:16:40 If you set a hover engine to max drag and 1 speed
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:16:50 You can basically make your thing hover
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:17:06 At any height you float/fly up to
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:17:25 Well you need a few
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:18:04 How big is your ship?
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:18:29 You can tell me the dimensions
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:18:35 They don‚Äôt have to be exact
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:18:47 Is it like 1 plot?
