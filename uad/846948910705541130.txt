help 2022-09-27 23:39:13 try to edit those sharp corners but the second is pretty good
help 2022-09-27 23:42:02 i meant like on the wheel well
help 2022-09-27 23:42:13 looks a tiny bit choppy but the front is pretty good
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 02:54:57 is it just me or did my server crash
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 02:55:19 real
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 02:55:42 isnt it really easy to crash servers in this game

help 2022-10-01 19:37:32 wait do you use motor or motor2 for control surfaces
bit confused on what does what
help 2022-10-01 19:43:47 hmm
help 2022-10-01 19:44:09 guessing motor2 is better for fighter jets then
help 2022-10-01 19:44:31 true true
help 2022-10-01 19:44:44 and i guess the max angle thing is useful
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 00:29:36 what in the
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 00:34:02 is making retracting landing gear worth it
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 00:34:45 i made my planes nose
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 00:34:51 lets just say a bit too thin
bot-central 2022-10-02 00:35:03 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 00:35:24 uhhh i dont have the level yet
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 00:39:20 you take the motor
you only select lock and keep everything off
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 00:40:52 you use motor locks to either get something halfway between blocks or to completely move something from where it is
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 00:41:19 no
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 00:41:48 its how people get blocks to clip into eachother
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 00:42:29 do you have powered on

creations-chat 2022-10-04 06:30:24 i‚Äôm not sure how long the 90 is at this point
creations-chat 2022-10-04 13:54:06 that‚Äôs why i said it was mediocre
creations-chat 2022-10-04 13:56:09 real (i don‚Äôt get this games scaling)
creations-chat 2022-10-04 14:01:39 <@728020153920520213> md90 probably is one of the most confusing variants of the dc9 it looks short at angles but also ridiculously long

also half the diagrams suck on it lol
creations-chat 2022-10-04 14:03:43 yeah i can tell

was it a mistake making a huge cross section to begin with?
creations-chat 2022-10-04 14:07:46 also i think my diagram sucked i used the same on to make this and it looks fine here in this game but oh my god it looks so short on the top
creations-chat 2022-10-04 14:10:03 lol
creations-chat 2022-10-04 14:12:09 minecraft is super easy cause it‚Äôs just a 1x1 grid this has a bit more

<@728020153920520213> i don‚Äôt really KNOW how long a part refers to in like a reference  like feet
also if you didn‚Äôt notice there the wing is def too close the the nose/ it‚Äôs too short

creations-chat 2022-10-04 22:00:32 from the maker itself here
creations-chat 2022-10-04 22:06:10 literally only made that cause someone kept yelling me to play plane crazy lol
general 2023-01-24 23:07:13 for context he constantly talks about this game in the build a boat server
general 2023-01-24 23:07:16 hmm
general 2023-01-24 23:07:32 ok man ill delete it
general 2023-01-24 23:07:53 i was just wondering why cause like 50% of his messages are just that
general 2023-01-24 23:10:59 gonna be honest i much rather prefer the flying physics in this game its actually fun but i suck at building with wedges üò≠
