plane-crazy 2021-10-10 17:54:44 yea
plane-crazy 2021-10-10 17:55:04 they need like hall of fame levels of detail so they wont downvote it
help 2021-10-10 18:11:44 are magnets really so laggy that when I activate one it cuts my frames from 60 to 30
help 2021-10-10 18:13:18 I am trying the opposite, a magnet with many blocks connected to it is trying to connect to something that has low amounts of blocks
help 2021-10-10 18:15:13 would it still be laggy if another persons creation magnetized onto mine
