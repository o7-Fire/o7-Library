creations-chat 2022-09-18 14:30:36 i suggest u dont edit image, try motor locking the guns into fuselage, maybe delete the magnet cannon it makes the build look bad. I also suggest you use custom engines, not the game ones bc they kinda trash. I also suggest u try making the fuselage less sharp.
creations-chat 2022-09-18 14:33:13 put more effort into ur build and it should do... I learned it the hard way. u can scroll my chat history in creations to see how my builds went.

creations-chat 2023-04-20 09:42:16 ikr
creations-chat 2023-04-23 06:22:44 motorlock does exist, you have to config it
creations-chat 2023-04-26 09:42:42 thats not too much, seems average
creations-chat 2023-04-26 10:37:23 most likely an edited pic, where the jets are turned into png images with no background, then added back placed in a formation
creations-chat 2023-04-26 11:21:29 tbh it looks pretty good
creations-chat 2023-04-26 12:21:14 but plane crazy is plane crazy, and not everything is perfect... at least its not a low effort build
general 2023-04-30 08:15:17 the heck is that handwriting ðŸ’€

help 2023-05-10 10:55:20 seems like some blocks are glitched in the plot
creations-chat 2023-05-10 12:26:49 ruh roh
creations-chat 2023-05-13 13:27:24 learn motorlocking, anglelocking, etc, and put 100% effort in the builds you do. If you think it looks good, then it probably does. If it doesn't, then it doesn't look good. however, pcc standards are extremely high, especially for planes
creations-chat 2023-05-13 13:29:34 ur welcome : ). btw note that everyone was a whitename once, so ofc its possible to be pro. you just have to believe in yourself, trust me it works
creations-chat 2023-05-13 13:32:13 its just society... when you have less power less people respect you. more power u have more respected u are. the roles in pcc kinda made some sort of  hierarchy, if u want to think about it that way
creations-chat 2023-05-13 13:35:06 society is just like that for some reason. nobody could do anything bout it tho. every personality you could imagine most likely exists
bug-reports 2023-05-17 09:15:46 u most likely joined the same server

help 2023-05-20 10:49:08 most likely a wing issue
help 2023-05-20 10:49:27 fix your wing design, from what i can see its not aerodynamic and unstable
help 2023-05-20 10:50:13 for me it seems like a private jet, so go with a design more like this:
help 2023-05-20 10:50:28 also, the yellow ball thing should be overlapping the blue one

general 2023-06-03 07:23:53 lolll
creations-chat 2023-06-06 12:19:01 usually not, it depends on what you are copying. if u r copying like some new mechanism that haven't been found yet or smth, then claim it as your own, then thats copying. but if you r just trying to take a small part of a build and use it, then it's ok as long as you don't call it your own
help 2023-06-06 12:20:31 camo could be improved, but then a lot of motorlock would be needed. you could also try hiding the holes of the wings by motorlocking trapdoors into those holes. i dont have any other feedback for it
creations-chat 2023-06-09 08:15:32 then what is it?
