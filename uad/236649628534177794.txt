general 2020-12-03 00:46:19 I can't build for shit in this game.
general 2023-06-14 21:23:57 I sent my graphics card back to get tested for defects, in 5 minutes they found it defective but they lost it for 2 weeks before even testing it, found it. Now they're giving me a new one instead of repairing my old one, and then also making a US based facility for this stuff instead of doing everything in Canada lmao
general 2023-07-03 06:28:21 I love when I catch lies.
