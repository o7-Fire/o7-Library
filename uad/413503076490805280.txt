creations-chat 2019-06-10 19:38:12 My odd looking gunship. 462 blocks, max cruise speed of 491 sps
creations-chat 2019-06-10 19:38:51 i agree
creations-chat 2019-06-10 19:43:47 true
creations-chat 2019-06-10 19:44:35 ok thanks
creations-chat 2019-06-10 20:01:38 This is less shit than the gunship. Granted, thats setting the bar pretty low.
creations-chat 2019-06-11 22:06:32 My first attempt of a circular fuselage. 726 parts, max cruise speed of 574 sps.
creations-chat 2019-06-11 22:06:46 
creations-chat 2019-06-11 22:39:08 here is a less crappy screenshot of the plane
creations-chat 2019-06-12 04:10:13 Name: Block, Blocks: 1, Max Cruise Speed: 0 sps
creations-chat 2019-06-12 04:15:59 the fact that this got 1 upvote makes it my most liked creation
creations-chat 2019-06-12 12:28:47 if i actually posted a block, does it look like i care how unoriginal it is?
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:26:34 well, idk what it considered "good" and what is considered "bad"
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:27:23 the block got 7 upvotes, but the first pic of the train before it got just 4, but the train was so much more complex then the block
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:28:04 i just don't really understand how this works
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:28:45 ik that, but why did it get more upvotes, its didn't deserve them
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:28:56 that train deserves more upvotes than the block
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:30:32 alright
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:34:42 well i guess that throws the yf-12 i was working on out the window...
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:37:21 alright, i'm just concerned because the block got more upvotes than my 700+ block jet, but yeah, it sound better to not care about upvotes
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:38:20 oh
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:39:17 well, i guess i will build the yf-12 then
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:41:30 <:thconking:535171057649188865>
creations-chat 2019-06-12 13:43:25 well if you win in a looser competition, are you a winner of a looser?
creations-chat 2019-06-13 16:20:09 I tried to make a lockheed yf-12 and I somehow ended up with this. It has 588 blocks and cruises at 630 sps
creations-chat 2019-06-13 16:20:17 
creations-chat 2019-06-13 16:20:28 
creations-chat 2019-06-13 16:44:03 the yf-12 was an interceptor based on the a-12
creations-chat 2019-06-13 16:44:12 the program was cancelled though
creations-chat 2019-06-13 16:45:24 in the end, only 3 were built
creations-chat 2019-06-13 17:10:03 idk what the "pain" part of that means but sure i'll paint it
creations-chat 2019-06-13 17:14:55 also it doesn't have any weapons yet because idk where they put  them in real life
creations-chat 2019-06-13 17:26:51 alright
creations-chat 2019-06-13 18:25:59 I'm on a mission to get 100 downvotes
creations-chat 2019-06-13 18:30:03 Thank you
creations-chat 2019-06-13 19:43:17 Here is the YF-12A again, painted this time
creations-chat 2019-06-13 19:43:51 
creations-chat 2019-06-13 19:47:14 if you look at a top view of the yf-12a in real life, you can see that the fuselage really spreads out just after the cockpit. but i kind of struggled to make that on this
creations-chat 2019-06-13 19:59:46 yeah i was thinking the same thing, i definitely built it way too small
creations-chat 2019-06-13 20:03:49 i don't really want to change it now though because surprisingly, it works quite well, making sharp turns are stuff like that
creations-chat 2019-06-13 20:04:47 oof
creations-chat 2019-06-13 20:06:50 next step is to weaponize it i guess
creations-chat 2019-06-13 21:31:38 oof someone thought my yf-12 is a b52
creations-chat 2019-06-13 22:40:01 wow
creations-chat 2019-06-14 02:05:40 why was the heli removed from creations?
creations-chat 2019-06-14 02:06:27 oh ok
creations-chat 2019-06-14 16:19:40 What if you downvote yourself?
creations-chat 2019-06-14 16:20:25 Ok good, reaching my goal of 100 downvotes will be easier than expected...
creations-chat 2019-06-14 18:33:44 it looks pretty good
help 2019-06-16 15:37:10 Greetings. My YF-12A used to fly perfectly. I haven't changed it at all, but now it just pitches down after takeoff. What do i do about this?
help 2019-06-16 15:43:13 Normally when this happens to any of my aircraft, I stop the plane and then spawn it again, and it will then work. This time, even after I do spawn it again, it just can't fly. It immediately nosedives
help 2019-06-16 16:39:04 i built it 2-3 days ago
help 2019-06-16 17:17:22 this is getting more odd, the yf-12a only works sometimes
help 2019-06-16 17:25:52 as in, sometimes after spawning, it works just like it used to, but other times, it will nosedive
help 2019-06-16 17:32:39 well, sometimes my other planes also pitch down at takeoff, so i respawn them and they work fine
help 2019-06-16 18:15:33 Here are the lift and mass nodes, as i said though, it was able to fly perfectly before
help 2019-06-16 18:16:57 well, i've learned how to fix it: I have to leave the server and join another one
help 2019-06-16 18:28:59 sorry, and yes i know that the nodes are far away from eachother, but despite that, the plane could fly before
help 2019-06-16 18:31:22 the picture i showed when i presented the problem proves that
help 2019-06-16 18:32:24 but if that were the case, i wouldn't be pitching down in one server, leave, and have it suddenly work like it should once i join another server
help 2019-06-16 18:34:08 i think we probably won't figure out the cause, but at least i now know that going to another server is how to stop it
help 2019-06-16 18:40:15 alright
help 2019-06-16 18:43:13 Sorry its in the night again, but here is a screenshot of it happening
help 2019-06-16 18:50:00 Alright, I got 2 day screenshots
help 2019-06-16 18:50:08 
help 2019-06-16 18:51:10 no
help 2019-06-16 18:51:27 alright i'll try that now
help 2019-06-16 18:53:40 i understand that, what i don't understand is why it happens only sometimes, and how come i have to leave the server and join another to finally make it work, because it works most of the time
help 2019-06-16 18:55:46 i guess that must be it
help 2019-06-16 19:00:10 with wing panels on the nose, its pretty much the same as when the plane works normally btw
creations-chat 2019-06-16 21:13:25 what a tragedy
creations-chat 2019-06-17 18:27:51 just build what you want to build, don't let downvotes take away your fun

help 2019-06-24 19:27:30 i'm making a boxwing business jet and the control surfaces powered by motors sometimes disappear in flight, causing the plane to become uncontrollable. is that a normal issue with the motors?
help 2019-06-24 19:29:43 i'd assume it is because it happens with my crj as well
help 2019-06-24 20:58:43 oh ok
creations-chat 2019-06-25 01:18:48 you got 7 downvotes against 12 upvotes
creations-chat 2019-06-25 01:18:56 how is that apparently bad?
creations-chat 2019-06-25 18:43:52 Blended Wing body business jet. Cruise speed is about 530 sps, 1115 blocks

creations-chat 2019-06-25 18:45:59 in the last screenshot, the control surfaces broke off
creations-chat 2019-06-25 18:46:01 because motors
creations-chat 2019-06-25 18:46:28 yep, it took a lot of time to get it stable
creations-chat 2019-06-25 18:47:19 alright
creations-chat 2019-06-25 18:47:58 its supposed to be a better version of a terrible boxwing i made a long time ago when i just started playing
creations-chat 2019-06-25 18:48:52 oh i see what your talking about
creations-chat 2019-06-25 18:49:09 thanks
creations-chat 2019-06-25 22:36:34 I managed to stabilize the plane so I could remove some of the wings and all of the ballast blocks, giving some room for retractable landing gear. Now 1116 blocks.

creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:28:39 ok then here is some help: the 747 variants that AC has flown are the 100, 200m, 400, and 400m
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:29:30 777 is better than 747
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:29:40 it is true
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:30:15 it will be easier if you use blueprints though
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:30:37 just search up "747-100 diagram"
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:30:50 or whatever variant you want to make
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:33:20 unless its a 777
creations-chat 2019-07-17 20:33:26 then its good

help 2019-07-26 03:49:15 My CH-148 flatspins to the left after takeoff all the time and I can't figure out what is causing it. What I know isn't causing the flatspin because of test flights: tail rotor, horizontal stabilizer, and the main rotors are exactly like the ones on my other heli which flies perfectly.
help 2019-07-26 03:49:36 also the center of lift is aligned with the center of mass
help 2019-07-26 04:12:25 nvm i just figured out the issue

plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:04:56 i feel like drones with flamethrowers would be an issue for tanks
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:05:45 luckily i don't think there is enough space for the weaponized tutorial planes to mount them without losing some of their pre-existing weapons
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:07:20 i've never seen anti aircraft weapons work that well
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:08:05 <@!251941191463993345>  yeah i mean that the tutorial planes will have to lose some of their weapons
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:09:01 tbh i see aircraft destroying anti aircraft weapons much more than there are anti aircraft weapons destroying aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:09:06 which defeats the point of the aa
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:09:41 because they are normally crappy "turrets"
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:09:59 that are actually cubes attached to motors
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:10:27 i don't see how its hard to rotate the top of the "turrets"
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:10:52 i just see difficulty in actually hitting the target

plane-crazy 2019-07-31 21:07:43 does this seem like a decent a350 cockpit?
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 21:07:57 alright
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 21:09:24 i was looking at this
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 21:09:55 i feel like the nose is the main problem
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 21:10:56 the nose is 2 1x2 wedges
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 21:11:06 maybe i could try 1x2 followed by 1x1
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 21:13:20 its a cessna crj777
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 21:14:07 thats great!
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 21:19:12 I think I just made it worse
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 21:19:36 well now it looks more like a 777 imo
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 21:20:02 should i raise the cockpit by 1 block?
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 21:20:31 alright
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 21:20:44 what is this?
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 21:28:36 i'm considering calling the 350 a 777 instead
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 21:28:37 because it looks a lot more like a worldliner imo
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 21:31:49 23 minutes until the next weeb hour

plane-crazy 2019-08-04 19:22:41 The Smart Fortwo (stylized as "smart fortwo") is a rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive, 2-seater hatchback city car manufactured and marketed by the Smart division of Daimler AG, introduced in 1998, now in its third generation.

Marketed in 46[2] countries worldwide, Fortwo production had surpassed 1.7 million by early 2015.
plane-crazy 2019-08-04 19:23:32 The developments started before 1993 originally as Swatch car of Nicolas Hayek in co-operation with Volkswagen. The idea was to design a modern microcar with an electric or hybrid drive. VW, however, could not decide on whether to produce the car or not, which led to disputes with Hayek. Hayek then turned to Mercedes.

The company MCC (Micro Compact Car AG) was founded in 1994 by Hayek in Biel as a joint subsidiary of Daimler-Benz and SMH SA (Société Suisse de Microélectronique et d'Horlogerie). When MCC abandoned the original concept and the planned electric or hybrid drive, both Hayek and senior development team members left the project. "Today's gasoline-powered Smart is a product from Daimler-Benz and has not much in common with the plans of the former Swatch team."[7]

plane-crazy 2019-08-04 19:59:42 Transmissions
The first and second generation Fortwo models employ an automated manual transmission, designed and manufactured by Getrag, where the clutch is computer controlled, eliminating the clutch pedal. The first generation used a six-speed version, and the second generation uses a five-speed version, model 5AMT130. Input from floor-mounted shifter or optional steering-wheel-mounted paddles controls a servo-operated clutch and sequential automated gearbox. The vehicle may be driven in automatic mode (early models had the option of full automatic mode, or standard "soft-tip" which was manual mode indicated by no button on the gear lever) or via paddle shifters, where the operator controls the shift points but cannot feather or adjust the speed of the clutch.

plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:56:49 well what type of planes and ships should people build?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:57:21 like spaceplanes and cruise ships maybe?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:57:22 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:58:05 no one makes trains because the train ranks are gone
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:58:45 because people likes planes and ships more i guess
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:59:55 i mean
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:00:04 i draw imaginary aircraft all the time
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:00:11 but i tend to make real ones in the game

plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:02:33 it got downvotes because people didn't like it
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:02:42 thats the point of downvotes
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:03:30 you could say the exact same thing about trains
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:03:35 or any vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:03:57 reiii, don't just say "you make planes so you are unoriginal"
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:04:23 making planes is completely fine

creations-chat 2019-08-19 03:26:03 as in, there is no visual propulsion
creations-chat 2019-08-19 03:28:05 planes have their engines on the outside because they inhale air to operate
creations-chat 2019-08-19 03:28:30 so having no exterior engine makes the plane look odd since thats not how they look irl

plane-crazy 2019-08-19 17:54:04 I don't think ballasts work in helis
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 17:56:07 As in, I don't think ballasts blocks really change the result
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 17:56:21 They have never worked from what I've seen with helis
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 17:56:35 With helis specifically
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 17:56:44 They work well with other vehicles

plane-crazy 2019-08-19 18:03:16 Because the center of lift is not with the center of gravity
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 18:04:12 You have to move lift forwards or the center of gravity back
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 18:04:47 Well I think that on helis specifically, ballasts don't work well
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 18:05:13 You just have to use blocks I guess

plane-crazy 2019-08-19 20:24:13 ok but having an engine at the back right next to the tail costs more to maintain and, in the event of an engine failure, it can damage the stabilizers
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 20:24:18 like united flight 232
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 20:28:33 what?
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 20:28:40 no a birdstrike will not break the tail off...

plane-crazy 2019-08-20 00:44:28 tbh i like wasps

plane-crazy 2019-12-07 22:43:40 like the 777 has a lower amount of bad builds for it
