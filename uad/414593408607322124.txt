plane-crazy 2019-02-28 11:43:22 i have a question
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 11:43:41 under the rocket category, it says for "just like elon" we need to land the rocket
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 11:44:10 can we make a space plane that lands vertically?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 11:44:35 it uses rockets, well and also launched by rocket
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 11:44:53 kinda
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 11:45:22 well im asking because i dont wanna get too far in before this
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 11:45:26 i havent started
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 11:47:58 so i looked up the def of a rocket, and it said stuff about fireworks, but the main thing was if it uses rocket engines as only propulsion
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 11:56:40 i might have an idea to make the spaceplane glide down, then detach the rocket, which lands
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 12:16:25 well my idea was a rocket on the plane
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 12:16:33 a rocket launches the plane
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 12:16:38 the plane glides a bit
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 12:16:49 then releases another rocket with me in it
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 12:16:52 and i land
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 12:17:16 or maybe the wings just fall off
creations-chat 2019-02-28 20:27:59 <@456226577798135808> can i have submarine commandeer
