general 2021-12-22 06:42:27 You clicked on the PC2 sneak peek because you didn't know it was a rickroll.
I clicked on the PC2 sneak peek knowing it was a rickroll because the song is good.
We are not the same.
general 2021-12-22 06:43:32 Probably
general 2021-12-22 06:43:36 Just don't post it
help 2022-02-04 07:36:12 So I'm working on a helicopter with 3 sets of 2 blades and I want to figure out how to stop it wobbling
help 2022-02-04 07:55:17 6 rotors
help 2022-02-04 07:55:30 spinning in opposite directions to each other
help 2022-02-04 09:25:04 ignore the fact people could take that the wrong way
help 2022-02-04 09:27:21 That's what it's labeled in the save files
help 2022-02-04 09:27:34 Heli, drone, pretty similar mechanics
help 2022-02-04 09:27:52 Just different executions
help 2022-02-04 09:28:09 I never said they were the same
help 2022-02-04 09:28:27 They both use blades pushing air downwards to achieve lift
help 2022-02-04 09:29:25 That's what differs it from a drone yes
help 2022-02-04 09:29:38 But there's drones with 2 or 3 blades
help 2022-02-04 09:29:49 Or more if you're crazy
help 2022-02-04 09:30:00 I've used 6 blade drones
help 2022-02-04 09:31:27 my problem with my vehicle is the sideways rocking

general 2022-06-01 07:47:47 gotta love the server crashing and you lose your progress on your build
general 2022-06-01 07:49:01 It depends on when it autosaved
general 2022-06-01 07:49:14 Sometimes it crashes shortly after and you only lose a few blocks.
general 2022-06-01 07:49:19 Other times I've lost the entire build
general 2022-06-01 07:50:10 I think I had a blimp I was working on
general 2022-06-01 07:50:21 Reduced to the first layer
general 2022-06-02 07:47:19 aight I guess I won't be doing a big ass rotary gun
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 07:50:45 Or blow up the plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 07:51:16 bruh motor 2 really doesn't like having a regular motor connected to it
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 07:54:05 overused, be original next time
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 07:54:17 Kinda cringe + ratio
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:07:17 You really trynna pull that.
Kinda sad.
Go take a shower or smth.
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:09:46 It's kinda sad that you're the sort of person to trash talk others for no reason like your average reddit mod that has no hygiene.
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:10:16 Bro
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:10:25 You don't know what hygiene is
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:11:36 Imagine caring about rank bruh
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:11:43 so scummy
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:12:13 I don't even care
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:12:16 I haven't posted anything there
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 08:12:27 And probably wont cause why should I
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 09:14:36 motor 2 freaks out and starts wobbling all over the place
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 09:16:46 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 06:03:43 tanks
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 07:16:55 Bombs
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 07:18:05 Yeah and you can drop them on those pvp car things
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:07:41 I'd also do that
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:08:17 I also want to put a conveyor drive in my vehicles but apparently lag makes it horrible to use.
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:08:37 And I'm always lagging because Australia
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:36:26 I'm going for a shipwright rank soon and once I can figure out making a big ass bomber plane or smth I'll go for that.
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 11:23:12 I want to try and hide a motor for turning a platform but I have limited clearance and limited motorlock experience
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 11:24:02 
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 11:24:06 probably
help 2022-06-03 11:26:31 I want to try and hide a motor for turning a platform but I have limited clearance and limited motorlock experience
help 2022-06-03 11:26:37 
help 2022-06-03 11:27:23 I want to rotate it 90 degrees and have it sit flush with the platform on the left
help 2022-06-03 11:27:45 It works here but I want the motor to be below the ocean level
help 2022-06-03 11:28:15 I move it and it doesn't line up with the platform
help 2022-06-03 11:30:55 I have limited space and doing that's not as easy as it sounds
help 2022-06-03 11:31:02 I'm trying to find a simpler method
help 2022-06-03 11:53:17 Try motorlock
help 2022-06-03 11:53:28 I have no clue how to do it but eh
help 2022-06-03 11:55:41 It'll make it flush with the hood
creations-chat 2022-06-04 21:47:41 hmmm
creations-chat 2022-06-08 07:40:47 *wrong channel, ignore*
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 07:41:22 Working on the chassis for a land vehicle build I'm working on. Unstable right now but should work better with more weight added.
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 07:05:11 TIL motors remain busted
plane-crazy 2022-11-07 08:48:31 This game really doesn't want me to have a functional vehicle does it
plane-crazy 2022-11-07 08:49:31 Unfortunately, roblox
plane-crazy 2022-11-07 08:49:49 I work around by dragging across while colouring
plane-crazy 2022-11-07 08:50:05 Then replacing the original colour for affected blocks
plane-crazy 2022-11-07 08:50:18 Fortnite's also got a plethora of unfixed bugs
plane-crazy 2022-11-07 08:51:30 Yeah any time I try to drive this thing it fucking explodes
plane-crazy 2022-11-07 08:51:42 Wheels ascend to the 4th dimension
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 06:43:43 Why don't we just drop giant explosive blocks on everyone
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 07:01:29 I should make a missile launcher sometime
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 02:10:43 Drives my 4500+ block ground machine into the lava
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 02:11:45 I bet I'll spend hours trying to correct this bomber's flight once it's done.
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 02:11:51 Never had any success with flying machines
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 10:39:25 I wanna spawn in a lobby that doesn't have some kind of shredder
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 10:43:16 how tf do i join another PVP server
plane-crazy 2023-03-15 10:51:00 Bro this game will get you a degree in aviation or smth
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 06:58:51 This bomber's coming along nicely
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 06:59:04 Might be the first aerial project that doesn't get abandoned
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 06:52:50 holy smokes this thing actually works
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 06:53:04 time to get 20+ downvotes
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 06:58:44 actually I should put a conveyor engine up front for balance
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 06:58:51 cause it doesn't work properly
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 07:09:36 and?
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 07:09:55 it's a public chat go somewhere else if you don't want anyone to talk to you
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 07:10:29 Oh I'm so scared
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 07:11:32 I'm literally trembling right now
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 07:11:39 Such a creative insult
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 07:14:49 okay
general 2023-03-22 08:18:45 Metal Gear Falling
general 2023-03-27 10:51:34 Yeah I can't use this bomber without everything despawning
general 2023-04-22 07:54:31 Nail them down
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 11:03:42 Welp, can't fly my bomber
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 11:03:48 Everything despawns as I fly it
plane-crazy 2023-07-16 12:10:06 Wait can you kill someone if they haven't spawned their build?
