general 2020-07-05 03:15:28 like im pretty sure theres a way to make a script that can do that
general 2020-07-05 03:15:33 just to see how far up i am
general 2020-07-05 03:16:09 whas vip1

general 2020-07-05 03:18:04 
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:27:38 i wish there was like a gamepass for like bigger plots or something idk
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:28:14 i think it would be easier then like a bunch of motor stuff
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:28:26 no im pretty sure its possible
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:28:40 wait wha
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:28:56 he said its not possible to add bigger plots?
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:29:01 weird
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:29:04 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:29:07 i know it isnt
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:29:19 its not impossible to do stuff like that
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:30:39 make them cost robux and if abusers use them as a lag machine thing he can revoke their gamepass but not give like a refund for punishment or something
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:30:45 no im pretty sure
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:30:47 it wouldnt
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:30:49 data wipe
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:30:58 im pretty sure
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:31:02 i dont really know
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:31:16 oh true true
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:31:53 well cant he like put that in the gamepass description and when you startup the game when you buy the gamepass it warns the player or something
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:32:12 true
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:32:38 like yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:32:47 theres such thing as a script that can detect lag
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:33:26 i have a way better idea just add a freaking cap on blocks that can be used to lag the game
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:33:28 its so freaking simple lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:33:55 i mean the cap is way too large anyway
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:34:26 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:34:33 why would you even need to use spheres like srsly
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:34:40 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:34:54 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:34:59 i just personally think there is 0 use for spheres
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:35:06 i cannot think of an actual reason for spheres
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:35:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:35:41 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:37:15 also ropes need a cap too
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:37:22 those are used alot for lag machines
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:38:29 trail blocks also need acap
