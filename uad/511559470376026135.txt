plane-crazy 2020-04-29 18:07:31 should I just remove the camo thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 18:13:21 ight
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 18:14:18 ight I removed the camo thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 18:37:10 behold the stug
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 18:39:08 yes I did
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 18:39:29 I never say it is not a tutorial build
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 18:39:54 yea
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 18:39:56 its not stable
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 18:40:18 keep bouncing backward and forward
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 18:40:55 stiffness 100 already I think
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 18:42:22 so I did the tutorial stug then stick the flag, side armor, extend the gun and also stick a rocket engine to it
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 18:43:10 quit and rejoin later or something
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 18:55:46 lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 19:08:04 I based the color on this
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 19:08:36 lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 19:09:27 oi dude
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 19:09:35 I'm not ery good at color stuff
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 19:09:56 beside that's the stug iii ausf f
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 19:10:04 and this is plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 19:10:08 nice
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 19:10:33 it changes the color tho
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 19:10:42 the color gets a bit darker
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 19:11:22 but a bit darker color
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 19:11:26 makes the coloring harder

plane-crazy 2020-04-30 02:52:38 Exactly
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 02:53:03 I based the color on the Stug in girls und panzer
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 02:53:42 Sure why not
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 02:53:53 Yes it is modified tutorial stug
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 02:54:03 I never said it is not
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 02:54:35 Tbh the tutorial stug move very badly
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 02:55:25 Well now that I know generally how to build a stug a
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 02:55:41 I can try and make a stug iii ausf f
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 02:55:52 If I have the time and motivation
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 02:56:18 I have a feeling I would be running out of motivation very soon
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 02:56:36 No
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 02:56:41 I lost count
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 02:57:08 I’m still waiting for the motivation to draw to come back so I can draw although I suck at drawing
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 02:58:21 Welp
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 02:58:25 That was idiotic
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 02:58:36 Off to h- I mean sleep
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:17:57 should I make the wheel works first for make the top part first
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:38:34 yes the gun work
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:39:10 just go to materials and do it
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:39:24 or use the paint tool, click on materials on it and turn ur wings into glass
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:39:27 oh ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:39:37 I mean I turned wings and such to metal and it work
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:39:58 this is metal
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:40:20 oof glass don't work
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:41:39 f
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:41:51 so you ca have grass and cloth wings
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:41:53 but not glass
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:41:58 ight fair enough
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:46:41 ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 20:03:41 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 20:03:56 motor moment
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 20:09:34 god dammit what do I put here so it actually move
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 20:13:46 wut

plane-crazy 2020-04-30 20:25:40 still tho my t34 uses suspension and its not as bouncy
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 20:26:14 or is it becuase of the non circular wheel

plane-crazy 2020-04-30 20:28:24 like what the hell should I put in it
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 20:30:25 so how much stiffness should I put
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 20:30:37 and damping too
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 20:31:41 in the suspension
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 20:31:53 oh and that same dude with the small atat again

plane-crazy 2020-04-30 21:47:18 no like
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 21:47:29 it wouldn't be as wide as the part in front
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 21:47:34 it would be too thin or too wide
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 21:47:52 I could try and use ropes
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 21:48:51 wait no that wouldn't work either

plane-crazy 2020-05-01 17:16:40 yeah I based it on that
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 17:16:56 basically I take that tutorial stug and extend it
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 17:17:01 that's one way to put it I guess
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 17:17:52 f
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 17:21:19 that's one rusty plane
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 17:32:00 man it feels weird having to lower the floor to fit the thing in
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 17:38:06 oh this this one can aim further up
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 17:41:17 finally a working ceiling
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 17:42:00 ik
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 17:42:03 that's the design
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 17:42:10 it's flatter
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 17:42:21 tho I think it;s a bit long
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 17:44:56 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 17:45:05 cuz like all the image I found of the stug g

plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:02:54 my a10 only have 24 keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:02:56 that's low
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:03:30 I want more keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:03:36 so there is 12  keybinds for movement
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:03:42 2 for speed
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:03:58 3 to adjust the wings
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:04:02 6 for missiles
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:04:12 and 1 for trail
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:04:30 what else should I put in
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:04:35 there's only 24 keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:05:09 oh and forgot the gun, technically 25 if you count the gun
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:05:21 well thing is my a10 don't have landing gear

plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:07:29 sace
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:07:31 space
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:07:39 I don't have the space to put in landing gear
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:07:40 also

plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:08:30 spoilers?
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:08:50 where and how
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:09:43 how do I go and do that now
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:09:54 I used lock motor on the wing
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:10:12 imma try to add bomb
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:25:08 this is the loest it go
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:25:25 oh I see why
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:26:09 oof so the break isn't gonna work cus spacing
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:26:14 imma make the bomb instead
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:37:31 ight imma use this modified version of the missile I saw yesterday
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:37:46 so 2 bombs
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:37:50 that 4 keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:37:56 2 each bomb
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:44:18 
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:47:57 nice the bomb is the landing gear
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:49:41 now that makes it 26 keybinds minus the gun
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:50:11 yeah I should have make the bomb 2 blocks further aprart
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 16:51:54 nice 26 keybinds minus the gun
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 17:03:37 laughs in 26 (minus the gun) keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 17:06:06 oof I jsut realized I droped the bombs over the coffin dance guys
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 17:56:58 the bomb works nice
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 17:58:23 
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 17:59:35 bruh the bomb jsut frze in place for 3 seconds due to teh lag
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 17:59:39 the dude just drives away
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 18:14:06 wing light
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 18:14:14 I could add 1 more keybind by adding wing light
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 18:14:28 and that will make 27 keybinds minus the gun
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 18:16:19 now how do I add 2 more keybinds so its 30 including the gun
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 18:16:40 wait do droping bomb and denonate the bomb count as 2 different keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 18:17:18 I mean it's teh same button
general 2020-05-22 18:17:47 do dropping the bomb and detonate the bomb count as 2 different keybinds
general 2020-05-22 18:17:52 like they are the same button
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 18:17:57 nice
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 18:18:00 big bote
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 18:25:55 nice
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 18:28:35 if my drop bomb and detonate bomb are the same keys, does it count as 2 different keybinds or just 1
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 18:37:53 
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 18:40:01 f
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 18:43:27 cool
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 19:44:08 that aim
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 19:44:11 what did you do
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 19:44:14 can I copy
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 19:59:40 yea tru
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:04:19 bruh this server
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:04:31 that and there's also the flying squid thing
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:05:12 yea
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:05:35 sadly I don't have speaker to brrrt
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:05:42 the guns move up by itself
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:05:44 I use motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:06:08 looks like it alright
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:06:19 I am proud that I was able to make it fly
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:06:23 and the thing have like
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:06:30 27 or so keybinds including the gun
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:07:02 6 of them are missiles 2 are bombs 14 for moving
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:07:03 what else
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:07:09 well I like it like that so yea
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:07:19 there's also 1 for the trail 1 for the gun
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:07:31 techcnially 12 for movement if you don't count the engine
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:07:44 it's very easy actually
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:08:02 wasdqe is the basic stuff
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:08:28 shift ctrl z x v b is the same thing but smaller so if you want to hit precisely
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:08:37 1-6 are 6 missiles
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:08:47 t and y is to drop and activate each bomb
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:08:57 t is one bomb and y is the otehr bomb
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:09:12 L is the trail and left click is minigun
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:09:19 it's very simple when breaking it down
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:09:46 well technically you can still fly without the shift ctrl z x v b
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:09:51 it's just wasdqe but smaller
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:09:58 R and F is jsut the spead
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:10:05 123456 is for missile
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:10:13 the rockets in game
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:10:30 T and Y drops their bombs and arms the tnt block
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:10:39 pressint T or Y again will make the bomb explode
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:10:55 It's very simple seriously
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:11:02 I cuz I made it duh
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:11:42 I do wish that I have more space for landing gear and wing light
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 21:13:32 but common it's only 27 keybinds it can't be that hard
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 23:05:36 lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 23:11:49 woah, a10 with no engine
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 23:13:47 
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 23:38:34 f
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 00:56:30 you can put in more control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 00:56:48 or just make it with motor and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 00:57:01 get more control surfaces it will control better
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 00:57:26 col?
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 00:57:51 oh
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 00:58:06 can I see the thing again
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 00:58:27 like before you launch it
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 00:59:24 ok
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 00:59:32 show me the plane
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:00:07 on the side too if possible
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:00:21 oh and the wings on the back
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:00:38 make em a bit bigger and add control surface to the small wings on the back too
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:02:23 yea
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:03:11 with vhat
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:04:24 oof
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:23:12 god dammit those tiny planes with a thousand guns on it
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:24:48 the hell is with this dude
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:24:53 oof yea
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:25:03 and those flying squid that rams into stuff too
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:36:22 what;s shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:37:37 oh
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:37:45 wait hol up those are supposed to be snakes?
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:37:51 I thought those are fying squids
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:37:56 *flying squids
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:38:07 huh
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:38:13 they looks more like snakes for me
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:38:17 I mean squid
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:38:31 cuz like they have the tentacle like thingy
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:39:32 yea
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:39:42 at least modify them or something
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:39:54 still tho those
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:39:57 wait I can swear right
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:40:05 I forgot if I can swear in this server or nah
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:40:20 ok you can
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:40:28 still tho those fuckers are annoying as hell
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:42:22 or like cover ur build with cutters or something idk
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:42:49 well yeah either shredder bugs or like all the guns you can put on a tiny "planes" or "car"
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:44:24 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:44:41 I would say the latter I guess
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:45:10 an hidden guided missle and make it go 620 sps
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 01:45:12 that
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:14:27 what else can I stick onto this thing it currently have the gun, 6 missiles and 2 bombs
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:16:31 well thing is
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:16:36 I don't have the money
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:16:39 for them speakers
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:16:51 my mate I have 3 robux and the speakers cost 300
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:17:00 if I had it I would have record the brrrt
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:17:03 sorry
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:19:25 yea that would be too big
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:19:49 good for pvp but it's pointless if it doesn't look somewhat decent
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:20:18 the color of the inside of the jet engine not saving is really pissing me off tho
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:20:38 well the bomb will do the trick so no real need for torpedoes
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:20:49 f
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:21:00 man I want the speakers
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:21:04 the brrrt
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:21:15 I got it saved on my robox ac
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:21:28 I just want to brrrt whenever I use my gun
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:22:08 the bombs work fine
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:22:49 well thing is it have to be very small the missile
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:23:00 cuz if not it would just looks clunky
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:23:15 beside I don't really wanna focus too much on air to air
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:23:17 it's an a10
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:23:45 is it the wings
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:23:59 several people have said that it looks like the tutorial a10
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:24:23 my dude if it is a tutorial plane I wouldn't have to spend 2 days trying to get the thing to fly right
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:24:54 the center of mass is a bit to the back so I can't even add landing gear
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:25:02 the bombs are the landing gear that I use for taking up now
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:25:24 I use bombs as landing gear
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:25:37 yes I already put it inside
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:25:45 cuz 2 huge jet engine isn't enough to move the thing
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:25:52 nah no need
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:26:03 I spent 2 days trying to get the plane to fly right not 3
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:26:11 this is the 3rd day I have the plane
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:26:15 nice
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:26:27 nice
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:26:30 anyway
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:26:42 the plane doesn't fly the best it it will get the job done
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:26:55 I want to make it a bit complicated and hard to fly too so it's perfect as it is now
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:27:00 with 27 keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:27:12 I just want to fill it with  a tiny bit more weapons
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:27:32 yea 27 keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:27:40 14 of them are for movement and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:27:53 technically 17
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:28:05 14 of them are for changing direction
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:28:11 i mean 12
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:28:26 wasdqe is for changing direction
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:28:42 shift ctrl z x v b is the same as wasdqe but smaller direction
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:28:51 r and f is the engine
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:29:01 p [ ] is to adjust the wing
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:29:08 L is the trail
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:29:13 1-6 are the 6 missiles
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:29:25 t and y i to drop and detonate the left and right bomb
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:29:30 that's it I think
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:29:43 kinda want to also add landing gear and wing light but can't really
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:29:59 do you count like
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:30:20 pressing a button to drop a bomb and pressing the same button to detonate it 1 or 2 keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:30:49 cuz if you count it as 1 then my plane have 27 keybinds including the gun if 2 then 29 keybinds including the gun
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:31:03 cuz like same button
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:31:13 ll
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:31:15 *lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:32:09 love it when people react to when I say that my plane have 27 keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:32:40 most of them jsut say yikes
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:32:51 well 6 is enough to steer the plane
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:33:06 the other 6 is the same thing but smaller movement
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:33:12 like if you want to be a little extra precise
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:33:21 I mostly only use 8 of them
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:33:35 the v and b move I use the least
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:33:43 cuz a and d do just fine
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:33:56 lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:34:20 and yeah the only purpose the mouse serve in t=my a10 is to look around and the main gun
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:34:42 *my
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:35:03 that is like my first real complicated build
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:35:08 glad I didn't give u
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:35:10 *up
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:35:24 mine don't either
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:35:28 but the gun do spin
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:35:47 lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:35:58 my first bomber don't even have a turret
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:36:27 it's jsut a heavily modified mouse control fighter plane with a bomb strapped to it
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:36:45 yea that's my first bomber
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:36:54 yea
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:37:24 huh
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:37:31 interesting
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 04:37:48 how would that do in pvp tho

plane-crazy 2020-05-23 23:56:19 do the 3 missiles in the middle looks ugly and should I just make it so only 3 missiles on 1 wing
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 23:56:43 more missile = more keybinds which is a good thing but i don't want it to look ugly
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 00:16:19 
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 00:25:58 any server with oil

plane-crazy 2020-05-24 01:43:44 I did
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 01:43:47 I made the a10
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 01:44:08 it's not the best a10 but it's my a10 and I'm proud
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 01:44:16 and I am proud that it now have 29 keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 01:44:22 oo nice

plane-crazy 2020-05-24 01:45:15 yea I love it when I people reacts to the fact that my a10 have 29 keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 01:45:36 most people just say yikes
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 01:45:51 I still want to stick my thing with more keybinds but 29 is the most I can do for now
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 01:48:25 cool
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 01:48:32 damn
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 01:48:33 nice wings
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:16:13 lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:19:06 bombs are greatest landing gears
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:20:00 f
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:20:21 all 6 of those missiles haev 6 different keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:21:50 it can brrrt so who cares
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:22:53 it's satisfying to hear so who cares
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:24:46 the heavy is dead?
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:25:14 THE HEAVY IS DEAD!
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:26:18 that's kinda big
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:27:23 at least teh a10 is not as overated as ww2
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:27:49 seriously tho why no one talks about ww1
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:29:32 ok
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:29:45 hey everyone xxkokoxx35's keyboard is haunted
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:30:03 man what else could I stick on my plane
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:30:14 currently it only have 29 or something keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:30:23 I want more dammit
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:33:45 self destruct would be nice but where I put it tho
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:34:13 so at the back
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:34:48 what choice of color is better tho
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:35:02 damn
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:48:49 eh idk if this color or better or worse
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:49:10 oh cool it have landing gear
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:49:18 good for you my landing gear are the bombs
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:49:56 do the thing fly well
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:50:03 I'm jealous that it got a landing gear
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:50:12 nice
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:50:24 mine have 29 keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:50:41 14 of them are to change direction
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:50:51 I like my plane to be a little ibt complicated
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:51:16 technically 14 of them are to fly cuz 2 of them are the speed
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:51:25 🧊
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 02:52:51 mostly I only use 8 out of those 12 movement keybinds to change direction
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 03:00:08 oh yeah I was there
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 03:00:16 trying to parkour to the top
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 03:05:27 how many
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 03:05:36 how many my mand
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 03:05:38 I must beat
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 03:05:50 huh
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 03:06:08 huh
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 03:06:10 oof
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 03:06:23 cuz 14 of my keybind is to change direction
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 03:06:34 2 is the speed 3 of them are to adjust the wings
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 03:06:46 6 keybinds for 6 missiles and 2 for bombs

plane-crazy 2020-05-24 03:07:14 there are also trails and 2 for cockpit
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 03:07:20 the gun and I think that's it

plane-crazy 2020-06-16 17:45:22 I made something working for once, although working badly that is
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 17:59:53 how the heck do people make those drones where its so stable

plane-crazy 2020-06-16 18:03:41 imma try to based it off some cameras or something
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 18:08:03 so it have to be balanced
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 18:08:15 imma try making a steady  cam but upside down

plane-crazy 2020-06-16 22:12:00 wut
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 22:12:48 I can't even build a gyroscope
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 22:13:16 and this part of the drone is gone so the whole thing is unbalanced
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 22:14:22 oh and my drone is kind of a gyroscope
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 22:14:26 not fully and stuff tho
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 22:17:22 still can't believe I built this thing without knowing anything about drope gyroscope or steadicam

plane-crazy 2020-06-17 18:58:27 ok
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 19:01:15 the hell is this thing
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 19:11:14 there should be a zoom feature in cameras
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 19:59:22 bruh public pvp server
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 19:59:30 filled with noobs calling each other noobs
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 19:59:33 and shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 19:59:55 very few
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 19:59:58 I've seen like
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:00:07 2 or 3 motorlock dudes in public pvp so far
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:01:47 2 in 3 public servers have shredder bugs
3 in 4 public servers have tutorial planes will all guns on it
2 in 3 public servers have all the guns on a square with wheels
1 in 3 public servers have swarms things with cutters and guns
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:01:58 at least that's my general experience
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:02:58 actually I was wrong about the shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:03:03 its 3 in 4 servers for me
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:03:16 there is a rare chance that there are no shredders
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:03:39 tutorial hover as less common for me
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:03:45 at least less common in pvp
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:04:09 I don't mind getting absolute destroyed by a good build
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:04:14 hell I would have been happy
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:04:28 and yes I did
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:04:29 once
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:04:42 he is actually in this discord
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:04:43 that's why
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:05:09 forgot his name but he made a cool fold flying ship thing
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:05:13 well
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:05:18 not any that I can remember
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:05:32 but I would like to stay somewhat positive and assume so
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:05:53 but damn it just like
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:06:07 even if some of the public server builds are somewhat decent
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:06:13 the control surfaces man
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:06:25 it completely ruined their builds
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:06:33 the whole entire wing is made oout of control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:06:42 yea
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:06:49 just do custom flaps
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:07:08 I don't mind mouse control if the build looks good
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:07:10 or decent
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:07:18 not that my builds looks any good
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:07:43 yea but in my opinion that is just too easy and not fun
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:09:11 I can also combine servo flaps with control surfaces wit hkeybinds on
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:10:04 if I made a plane I would like it to have at least 14 keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:10:21 in which 12 of them are for changing directions
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:11:36 f
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:12:38 will putting in another layer like this help with the balancing
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:12:52 or am I just stupid
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:16:22 ok what the hell

plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:28:20 I was trying to see in third person but then the view acts like I have't launch the thing yet
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:29:21 so yea it looks like a giant wall I can see it now but the thing is not that big
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 20:49:12 pink
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 22:20:39 ah I found the corpse
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 22:20:51 so the bug I found yesterday is confirmed dead
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 22:22:05 I found its dead body on the floor just now

plane-crazy 2020-06-18 18:28:11 I just named it drone
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 18:28:17 its my first drone
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 18:28:22 oh ok
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 18:28:34 plane crazy drone camera test
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 18:31:04 lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:40:15 aye I was in the video
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:40:31 I was the in pvp montage video
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:41:15 that's my a10 getting rekt
plane-crazy 2020-06-18 20:41:21 it dont even have landing gear at the time
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:16:22 I want
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:16:34 to make a super maneuverable plane
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:16:56 that can fly relatively fast and super maneuverable
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:17:01 and no mouse control
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:17:14 man I want that so much but I can't build for crap
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:19:06 how do you make a thing super maneuverable tho
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:19:13 like I used custom flaps and all
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:19:18 but I suck at plane making
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:19:52 it doesn't look good, not very maneuverable, suck at pvp
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:19:57 at least it got a landing gear
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:20:01 yea same
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:20:31 the thing is too filled to the brim with weapons but not manuverable enough to use it
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:20:44 aaaa the control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:21:09 too much control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:21:38 lol yea
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:21:45 tbh I want to make a tie fighter
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:22:00 how should I go about doing it tho
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:22:12 cuz like if I am to make it it have to looks somewhat decent
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:22:15 and not like
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:22:25 having a bunch of control surfaces everywhere
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:23:02 and it have to have a good first person
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:23:25 its easier to make a real plane cuz the custom flaps moving is real
plane-crazy 2020-06-19 00:23:35 kaing a tie fighter I have to hide all those stuff

plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:05:05 rate my pixel art
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:09:00 shoot
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:09:14 no
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:10:13 more control surfaces I guess
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:10:41 not really
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:10:45 about the center of grav
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:11:00 my a10 can fly and the center of grav is at teh back and center of life is near mid
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:11:36 wait no center of lift is also at the back
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:12:24 drill
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:13:11 well I use custom flaps for my a10 tho
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:14:22 lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:15:32 can u show a vid
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:16:09 yea the wing at the back is too small
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:16:17 and no control surfaces at the back
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:16:55 u need control surfaces and the back n stuff
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:19:02 you should really do custom flaps
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:19:23 you can pull off a lot of cool maneuvers with custom flaps
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:19:35 custom flaps is not that hard
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:19:45 well for example a bunch of rolls and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:19:49 i dont know the name myself
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:19:54 just use motor or motor 2
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:20:06 the barrel roll
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:20:10 and do quick 180
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:20:20 just like
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:20:23 wait lemme get a pic
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:20:32 or a vid
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:21:08 https://youtu.be/tvJ9qZKsJys
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:21:14 this is a custom tie I made
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:21:23 its not the best at maneruvering
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:21:28 this is kinda bad
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:21:31 at flying
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:21:38 but it can do some stuff at least
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:21:51 using custom flaps
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:22:12 wait till u see the 180 turn
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:22:20 its not very fast yest but faster than mouse controls
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:22:38 sure
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:23:47 somthing like this
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:24:02 and you can combine that with mouse control
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:24:17 so basically
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:24:24 the back sideway wing is for up and down
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:24:33 the vertical wing is for left right
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:24:37 you wont use that a lot
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:24:44 the bigger wing
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:24:49 is for rolling left and right
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:24:58 that one and the back one is very imortant
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:25:08 the vertical one is important too but you wont use it as much
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:26:07 red is for up down green is for left right (you wont use that much) blue is for rolling left right
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:26:21 thx
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:26:31 people keep saying it looks like a tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:26:40 I spent a day on it and 2 days trying to get it to fly
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:26:46 its an a10
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:26:53 of course it have to look like an 10
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:26:55 *a10
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:27:12 like what do you expect the a10 to look like
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:27:15 not an a10?
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:27:26 wat
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:27:48 as straight forward as possible
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:28:00 just be rude
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:28:05 Im fine with it
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:28:36 yea cuz its an a10
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:28:37 ik
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:28:44 i made that thing a month ago
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:28:52 its not the best at flying either
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:29:03 thats my first time experimenting with custom flaps
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:29:10 so I want to make the thing have like
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:29:13 42 keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:29:19 12 of them are for direction
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:29:38 not fun
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:29:54 also there are like 8 in game rocket and 2 custom rocket
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:30:10 2 bombs and the gun
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:30:13 thats all the weapons
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:30:16 no
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:30:18 not really
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:30:25 I can control it and have a drink at the same time
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:30:28 1 handed
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:30:44 to fly it I mostly need only like 4-6 keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:30:55 but I added 6 more which do the same thing but like smaller
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:31:13 2 for engine 3 or wing 2 for flare 1 for light 1 for trail
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:31:25 the cockpit opens
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:31:38 and the custom rockets I control it manually
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:31:58 bombs can be detonated mid air
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:32:11 as I say at the time I was only experimenting with custom flaps and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:32:14 so I want to go ham
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:32:32 still tho 42 keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:32:35 I wish I could fit in more
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:33:36 yea 42 keybinds in total
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:34:07 and the only thing that the mouse do in the build
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:34:12 is to shoot the gun
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:34:14 and look around
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:34:25 that's all the mouse have to do in those 42 keybinds
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:34:36 the mouse plays nothing in maneuvering the plane
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:39:07 cool
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:39:19 wanna see my first vtol thing
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:40:59 this is an old pic
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:41:13 the thing now have several more blocks and stuff to make it more balanced
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:54:09 add a landing gear
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 01:54:14 that help with taking off
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 02:00:24 lol

creations-chat 2020-06-29 04:57:22 <@!512467907469377539> use motor or motor 2 stuff for moving the plane
creations-chat 2020-06-29 04:57:47 you can also combine that with mouse controlled control surfaced
creations-chat 2020-06-29 04:58:04 or at least make a thicker that hides that loads of control surfaces
bug-reports 2020-06-29 04:59:00 <@!554300932217765888> pretty sure you just miss place the whole entire green platform thing by 1 block or 2, unless thats lock motor
creations-chat 2020-06-29 04:59:13 yea
creations-chat 2020-06-29 04:59:30 itll make the build looks better, less hole and you can pull of cool move

plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:47:28 I didn't even do much research on the plane yet
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:47:48 all I know so far is it's used in vietnam and its called a flying fortress
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:48:13 no
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:48:19 if it look dogshit it's useless
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:49:50 look I'm not aiming for functionality when I build stuff that is based on real life stuff
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:50:08 if I want like op stuff I'd just follow some god knows what tutorial or worse, shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:52:24 ight so the landing gears is gonna be kinda hard
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:53:10 and no I'm not gonna use in game landing gears

plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:54:49 it doesn't look very good you know
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 22:55:08 best thing I've seen people do with landing gear is use it as like the car gear stick thing

plane-crazy 2020-10-12 00:09:47 o just trial and error until it's stable?
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 00:17:43 wait do the speed of the tail rotor matter or no
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 01:13:25 he stare
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 01:18:25 bruh replacing the end of the blade just make the heli a lot more controlable
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 01:18:27 plus it look better
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 01:19:30 
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 01:19:49 d o m i n a c e
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 01:21:08 d o m i n a

plane-crazy 2020-10-12 03:47:44 seems like the name
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 23:24:32 
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 23:25:49 i should really recolor the thing
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 23:41:13 does this look better than the old color
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 20:50:05 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 22:05:11 oh no
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 22:58:26 rate my dumbass doorless blackhawk wannabe
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 23:00:23 it have exposed motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 23:01:06 cool
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 23:29:09 When the
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 23:41:23 ah yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 23:41:24 bote
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:03:23 lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 01:16:47 do some motorlock sorcerry
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 16:16:12 aw that's a cute way to make landing gear
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 16:33:39 lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 17:38:25 oh no
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:10:56 is this kind of rotor blades usable or should the engine be more father apart
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:11:12 like
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:11:23 do having engine at the end of the blades make it easier to control or no
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:12:25 my heli have to swashplates so its kinda trash
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:12:38 i don't even know how to make a normal swashplate let alone a small one
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:15:13 well this is my current heli, it's kinda cringe
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:15:54 that's like my first heli that's actually mine
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:16:06 and yea i really need to improve the design
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:16:25 cuz like it can't even fir the door
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:16:36 motor 2
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:16:43 yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:16:50 if u shoot it or if it goes for too long
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:17:13 noice
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:17:38 trens
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:18:08 this is nice swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:19:01 
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:19:19 he say its not very reliable tho
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 18:31:53 ok how how tf am I gonna build this thing
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 18:33:55 indeed
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 18:34:52 so I should be around as tall as the track if not a bit taller
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 18:36:03 in game real life scale
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 18:36:31 ik
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 18:37:47 ok I might have to upscale just a tiny bit so it would be easier
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 18:40:16 imma just start with the hull first lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 18:48:25 ah god dammit the half block thing
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 18:53:22 motorlock and motor
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 18:53:43 motor spin the thing into the right position and motorlock glue it together
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 18:54:03 ah this look terrible
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 18:59:22 tnt
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 18:59:34 put tnt so the motorlock don't work
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 18:59:43 then angle the normal motor right
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 18:59:46 then explode the tnt
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 19:03:00 man the track look weird
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 19:08:03 oof I can't use propeller for turning the thing is too light
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 19:09:24 nice
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 19:16:38 motorlock magic I did it
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 19:44:30 
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 20:39:18 
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 20:47:55 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 23:21:28 any possible way to get this sign to stay where it is
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 23:22:02 wait i forgot cameras exist
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 23:28:04 ok seriously tho is there anyway to keep this trapdoor in place without using camera and without touching that motor
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 23:28:45 it'll touch the motor
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 23:29:27 the gun will get stuck
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 23:30:06 wait this might work i hope
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 23:30:15 nvm
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 23:30:53 ok I can just put the trapdoor sideway
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 23:31:01 i tried camera earlier
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 23:31:05 but it got stuck to the gun
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 23:31:07 thats why
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 23:31:18 now i just turn the trapdoor and put cameras in different posittion
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 23:32:23 bye
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 23:36:11 time to commit revolution
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 01:27:58 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 01:28:24 all I need to do is to lower the main rotor blades like half a block
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 01:29:20 now this thing is smoother than I could ever dreamt of being
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 12:25:25 nice
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 12:39:56 my project plans:
 - whatever the fuck I feel like making
 - whatever the fuck I can actually make
 - picking a slot to save it in
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 13:19:21 welcome to teh struggle mate
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 13:19:49 use a lot of half block category stuff
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 13:20:24 I should make more ww1 stuff
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 13:20:35 rn i only have a german heavy bomber and the french light tank
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 13:21:13 yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 13:21:28 the pic is from her debut stream
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 14:02:01 use like motorlock to do it
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 14:24:24 lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 14:26:42 what ww1 stuff should I make
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 14:26:52 I can try the a7v u or the british tank
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 14:27:57 this or the brit version
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 14:28:10 which one should I do
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 14:28:19 ah yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 14:28:23 the kv 2 2 2
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 14:28:32 I already made a plane
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 14:28:35 i made the gotha gv
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 14:29:09 and what do you mean that mess of metal
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 14:29:18 ww1 tanks are beautiful
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 14:30:02 except the little willie
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 14:30:39 lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 14:31:04 ww1 is the superior tank
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 14:31:06 i mean war
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 14:31:48 bi planes and tri planes
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 14:32:28 you don't get to hide in the trenches and get gassed like you do in ww1 in any other wars
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 18:53:05 yes it worked
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 18:57:31 the motorlock are no longer exposed
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 20:02:47 o shid this thing can actually climb
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 20:35:27 oh no
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 21:33:52 conveyors
plane-crazy 2020-10-16 23:45:35 nice
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 02:20:18 dude not ment to be rude but
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 02:20:23 ur cruiser look fat
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 02:20:41 no like
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 02:20:46 compared to the source materials
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 02:20:49 it just look short
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 02:21:21 try folding
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 02:21:39 rip steve
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 02:22:08 <@!303637849650233345> try folding, also use that to make the thing have less of an angle if possible lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 03:20:39 https://youtu.be/4-taMNimdoE
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 03:20:41 I made a thing
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 20:55:41 cool
plane-crazy 2020-10-18 21:38:27 man why do I decide to make small tank and tankettes
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 23:31:34 how this possible
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 23:31:36 how this possible
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 23:32:17 ik that
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 23:32:18 but how
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 23:32:36 no no no
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 23:32:41 how I put mouse movement in there
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:27:39 big water and some flat lands too
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:27:54 grassy areas if possible
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:28:39 exactly
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:28:46 hard to camo
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:28:57 lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:29:24 ye alag
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:29:42 maybe the trees are non collidable
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:30:06 well then again it depend on how dense the trees will be
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:30:39 yea true
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:31:51 lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:38:24 tbh
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:38:32 blacklisting people should also disable their pvp
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:38:40 like
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:38:53 if u blacklist someone both of you can't fight
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:39:08 that would prevent shredder bugs greatly
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:40:45 yes ik that
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:40:56 but what if
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:41:02 i want to make realistic ww1 tanks
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:41:11 or planes
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:43:11 blacklsting is a hing
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:44:01 best shredder defense is ususally good jets or fast tanks
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:45:14 but if you want to make slow stuff ur dead
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:46:02 folding is a thing
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:46:36 tf is that
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 19:48:37 ooo
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 20:02:04 fallin be like
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 20:24:14 winter update
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 20:24:18 its in winter event
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 20:24:32 firework, snow stuff and sparker
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 20:24:37 something like that
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 20:25:02 ikr
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 02:09:31 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:31:03 "russian flag"
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:31:21 and how do that tank look anything russian
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:31:32 it is anything but russian
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:32:37 french have the first tank that have a turret on top
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:35:12 nice
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:35:37 now those are the heli worth using
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:40:11 I kinda want to make a cobra but then again I already struggle with the blackhawk so much
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:44:40 man swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:45:02 I wanna make swashplates but as compact as possible
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:45:04 tuff
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:45:54 2 or 3 blocks high is like the perfect height ngl
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:46:11 thing is its wide
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:47:03 how how
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:47:19 swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:49:35 rip
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:50:05 how I make 2 blades swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:50:08 as compact as possible
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:50:58 show me
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 13:51:01 the 2 blades
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 15:44:16 I might try to make the Riesenflugzeuge that would be my first big plane
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 15:44:23 gotha gv isn't a big plane compare to it lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 16:49:11 nice
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 16:58:13 nice tank
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 17:02:03 new map will i think
creations-chat 2020-10-21 18:12:40 lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:39:58 should I remake my a10 or make the Riesenflugzeuge
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:40:17 freedom or glory to zhe Empire
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:41:12 lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:41:23 ok seriously tho what I do
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:41:37 ok
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:41:53 so lemme see
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:42:21 i'll try to reduce the size by 100 blocks, so its at somewhat 400 blocks and make the thing more in scale
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:42:27 mine was a bit too long lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:43:42 im aero engineer 2 lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:43:57 thats my first rank
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:44:11 but this a10 is outdated and people keep saying it look like a fucking totorial
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:44:16 *tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:44:32 it's a fucking a10 it look like an a10
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:44:49 I always have to tell them to look again at whatever tutorial they looked at and compare it
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:45:32 it doesn't look similar, the most similar thing is the wing
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:45:48 the hull is 2 fucking blocks wide
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:46:19 Riesenflugzeuge
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:46:29 the next ww1 thing I'm gonna make is that thing
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:46:46 so far I got the gotha gv and ft 17
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:47:17 no
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:47:20 he made the first plane ever
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:47:23 the wright planes
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:47:27 wrights plane
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:48:08 this thing is from ww1
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:50:52 ww1 is the superior war tho
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:51:09 nothing ever competes to trench warfare
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:51:52 no
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:51:55 as I said
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:52:03 nothing ever competes against trench warfare
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:52:09 nothing ever beats it
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:52:19 that is not related to trench warfare
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 18:52:22 therefore its boring
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 14:26:09 f
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:06:21 b i g
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:14:24 man it feels weird to see pic with outlines again
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:43:43 you seems like ur annoying ngl
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:45:14 camo?
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:45:20 just use something in real life
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:45:37 copy something irl
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:45:45 it's camo
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:46:16 what's teh build tho
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:46:37 ur annoying
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:47:22 imagine using mouse control on stationary object
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:48:39 still annoying
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:49:23 man I'm hungry
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:49:28 another hour and I can eat
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:51:33 ok mouse control
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:51:59 I just dislike it in general
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:52:22 also what the hell is that
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:52:26 are you trying to kamikaze
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:52:39 that tank is not moving at least keep a small distant when shoot
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:53:12 what u mean this is not kamikaze
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:53:35 you even crash to the tank
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:55:44 at least try to keep like a small distant or something this usually work better without crashing the plane
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:56:02 sorry for bad drawing im using a mouse nota drawing pad
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:57:38 u can use the firework thing if you want just set the range to idk further
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:58:31 ik
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:59:28 motors
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 18:00:08 look up a tank thred tutorial then
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 18:01:28 1 block wide thread is not gonna be possible unless its ugly
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 18:01:45 so far thats all I see
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 18:02:16 just use conveyors if u want lol

plane-crazy 2020-11-11 16:16:46 I kinda want to make a tiger 1 but making the thing is painful enough let alone making it to scale

plane-crazy 2020-11-14 03:31:11 why would you want ur tank to be super fast
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 03:31:13 its a tank
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 03:36:53 nice
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 17:32:41 Man
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 17:33:11 My dumbass didn’t even look for a blue print when I made the a10 months ago
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 17:33:35 I just looked at a 3d model and get confused
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 17:34:04 No wonder people thought its sum shitty tutorial or somthin
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 18:17:40 why is there like only 1 panzer 1 in creation lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 18:17:59 panzer 1 look cool as hell
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:04:33 since theres like only 1 panzer 1 in creation imma try to make one to scale
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:05:15 
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:08:53 also I made the front of the ft17 shorter lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:11:23 how wide should I make the panzer 1
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:11:35 the hull of the ft17 is 2 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:11:47 should I make this 2.5 half wide
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:31:06 how how tf do I do the front wheel
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:31:08 
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:31:27 and man conveyor really look bad I might as well just use rocket to push
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:31:55 yes pz1
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:32:00 also this
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:33:33 lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:33:42 man making to scale stuff is tuff man
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:34:14 although this is not really to scale cuz it would need to be even smaller
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:35:24 ik
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:35:33 but thing is I love to scale thing
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:37:53 ok this look kinda very bad
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:38:05 should I just skip the tracks
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:39:25 it look better than normal cylinder
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:41:53 actually I might also make the hull 2 block wide
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:44:42 man
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:44:52 unlike the ft17 the track isn't as wide
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:45:04 ah I might as well just skip the track
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:45:33 A I give up
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:47:22 those thin piece of shit
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 00:53:31 might as well just go back to ww1
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 01:34:10 im not talking about 1 block
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 01:34:23 if I want to build the panzer 1 it should be half a block or .75 a block
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 01:34:43 but thats not possible so I would either need to
a. half block no track
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 01:34:50 b. have track 1 block
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 01:36:03 I might have to go with the later
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 01:43:36 oh bruh is this the only panzer 1 built
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 01:44:54 yea why not
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 01:48:19 I'm trying to make a to scale one
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 01:48:22 hurting me brain
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 01:48:59 o nice
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 01:49:18 I'm trying to make the thing to scale and have the right amount of wheels
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 01:49:33 so its already out of scale
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 01:51:46 man this already look bad
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 02:00:59 yea it's not gonna be to scale
plane-crazy 2020-11-18 13:18:29 nice
plane-crazy 2020-11-18 14:48:18 grate
plane-crazy 2020-11-18 15:18:18 imma
plane-crazy 2020-11-18 15:18:25 im
plane-crazy 2020-11-18 15:18:32 i have failed to make the panzer 1 to scale
plane-crazy 2020-11-18 15:18:38 imma try to make teh tiger to scale
plane-crazy 2020-11-18 15:19:15 yea
plane-crazy 2020-11-18 15:19:24 tiger to scale would be a lot easier than panzer 1
plane-crazy 2020-11-18 15:19:30 its more square so its easier too
plane-crazy 2020-11-18 15:20:06 now I just gotta figure out how big the thing should be for it to be to scale
plane-crazy 2020-11-18 15:24:34 nice
plane-crazy 2020-11-18 15:27:05 man

plane-crazy 2020-11-24 15:04:33 imagine not doing accurate speed
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 15:04:56 300 speed biplane
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 15:05:08 like seriously if ur gonna make a ww1 biplane then make a speed accurate one
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 15:07:09 u could fit more if u want
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 16:11:55 its hard to make anything to scale with plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 16:14:51 I can't make a to scal albatros d5 without it looking squarish
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 17:18:21 they are cancer machine
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 17:18:27 just make a good jet or something and kill it
plane-crazy 2020-11-24 17:19:23 exactly

plane-crazy 2020-11-27 05:34:00 eh im gonna get rid of that anyway
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 05:34:12 gotta make space to make a to scale zeppelin staaken r6
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 05:36:37 zeppelin staaken have engine on both side
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 05:36:41 so i dont have to worry about that

plane-crazy 2020-11-28 03:20:09 man
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 03:20:22 the plane only use 1 rocket engine so its a bit too slow
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 03:20:28 but super rocket engine would be too fast
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 03:30:17 god damn public pvp
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 03:30:29 at least there are no shredder big in this server

plane-crazy 2020-11-28 03:36:21 yea ik that
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 03:36:22 but like
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 03:36:32 sometimes you just want a speed accurate thing from the past
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 03:36:39 idk like an ft17 or a biplane
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 03:36:53 what's the point of having a biplane it it move ath 400kmh
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 03:38:46 oh god the public server box

plane-crazy 2020-11-28 03:50:43 your plane is not a biplane unless you can push it with ease
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 03:53:25 ok is there anyway to put a propeller in this thing
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 03:55:33 aye I did it
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:03:20 is wood any lighter than the default material
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:03:30 also is making the wing wood do any difference

plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:29:42 a powered disconnector
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:29:45 u can disconnect
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:29:51 an unpowered one is just there for show
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:29:54 it cant do anything
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:30:57 how

plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:39:19 exactly
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:39:31 disconnector that wont disconnect is unpowered disconnector
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:39:51 an alternative is unpowered motors
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:39:59 but unpower motor can still be moved
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:40:13 unless u lock them, which will initiate the motorlock thing

plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:51:48 its not a biplane unless u can push it around with ease lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 18:55:09 oh no
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 19:47:41 is there like a way to make this gun half a block lower lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 19:48:11 yea I tried that but like
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 19:48:21 trying not to have anymore exposed motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 19:50:48 cuz this is how the plane is pre launch
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 20:04:34 a
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 20:06:02 the thing can glide very far you know
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 20:06:24 also the ability to lean would be very nice ngl
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 20:16:05 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 20:33:15 it aint perfect but I managed to hide the gun
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 20:33:47 but now its half a block too low
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 20:58:03 who need wings to fly
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 20:58:29 oh wow I landed
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 21:00:01 is there like an altertanive to cutter, like cuz piramid wege cant stuck to the propeller blade thing on the side
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 21:00:46 cuz the cutter cut and the thing act like a shredder bug and I despise that
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 21:04:19 cuz this look kinda bad
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 21:46:48 lol

plane-crazy 2020-11-28 22:21:52 boi the thing really can glide
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 22:22:55 
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 22:33:12 a
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:27:46 prolly cuz of the smoke or the video itself
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:28:26 ok I saw the thing

plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:30:53 I'm not good at all
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:30:56 at building
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:31:03 Im just saying what I think
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:31:07 in other word, my opinion
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:31:57 yea the tail and the front thing is kinda bad
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:32:05 the front thing of the blimb is worse tho imo
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:32:32 this is too sharp my dude
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:32:34 who you gonna stap
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:32:38 no offense
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:32:54 wedge and half wedges
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:32:58 look in the half block section
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:34:07 allow me to elaborate
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:34:14 ur tail look like a water bottle cap
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:34:47 nobody expect you to be perfect
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:34:55 you post the thing in creation and people vote on it
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:36:01 in my opinion the front look a bit too pointy
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:36:20 as I said before
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:36:25 look in the half block section
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:36:29 there are a ton of shit there
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:37:18 half wedge down 1x2, half wedge up 1x2 half wedge down half wedge up
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:37:21 half wedge
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:37:27 wedge from 1x1 to 1x4
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:37:37 triangle wedge from 1x1 to 1x4
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:37:40 all the other shit
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:38:28 ah shit real life call ill take my leave
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:40:10 idk try something like this
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 00:40:11 peace im out
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:46:24 so I made the albatros d5
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:46:32 imma make the fokker dr1 next
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:50:29 what is there to not understand about motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:50:38 you put down a motor, go to configure
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:50:43 and set power off and lock on
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:51:16 idk just
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:51:21 learn it on ur own
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:51:29 like say
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:51:40 if you cant place down something
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:51:45 use motorlock for it
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:51:54 you can do that too
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:52:08 but u need tnt or something spring to stop the motor from locking at first
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:52:18 then you rotate the thing, then activate the tnt or pring
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:52:21 *spring
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:52:25 so the motor will do the lock
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:53:19 so basically like this
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:54:26 so like this
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:54:34 then roate the thing
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:54:35 rotate
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:56:17 like this
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:56:40 just
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:56:45 ok lemme join back to the game
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:56:51 basically
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:56:55 its the same with the tnt thing
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:56:59 but replace thet tnt with spring
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:57:27 so basically this is how normaly it would go
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:57:54 place spring something like this
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:58:45 spring is kinda bad tho cuz there are some piece left drop behind
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:58:53 tnt is better since it just disapear
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:59:11 lemme just go to a vip server
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:59:52 or that could work too
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 01:59:56 nice
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 02:00:37 or just use tnt lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 02:01:05 but spring leave bits behind
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 02:01:10 and that glitches thing sometimes
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 02:01:13 
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 02:01:44 a
plane-crazy 2020-11-29 02:10:23 how

plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:12:50 you have to leave a flyinh plane which could glitch u out and walk to the turret thing whatever you sau
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:13:04 and when ur back at the main seat u have to restart all the engines
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:14:59 not to mention you would leave the plane going on its own if you leave it for the gunner seat
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:15:00 seat

plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:23:28 even if it miss a lot thats how the bombs work it just go down
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:23:36 kamikaze is kinda boring
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:23:40 since you dont die
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:23:44 whats the point
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:24:00 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:24:10 you crash ur plane into a ship or a target
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:24:21 plane usually have explsoive
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:24:42 you dont die in plane crazy by kamikaze tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:24:53 since there is no collision dmg
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:25:03 you cant crash an actual plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:25:12 ik but thats boring
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:25:19 you cant make to scale plane like that
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:29:48 yea but it dont look as good
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 13:30:03 the plane just explode from wherever the bomnbs is

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 18:50:44 yea seriously tho what is it it look wierd
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 18:52:13 a wat
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 18:52:29 this thing?
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 18:52:44 those 2 don't look similar in the slightest tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:06:16 anyway to make me plane roll faster
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:06:35 I know that making ur wing shorter is a thing
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:06:38 but like anything else
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:08:23 explain
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:08:41 cuz its a plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:08:45 a fighter plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:08:48 its a triplane
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:09:08 like the state its in rn is decent but I kinda want it to roll just a bit faster if possible
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:09:19 also I try to make the plane to scale so tehres that
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:09:46 classic control surfaces on the tip of the wings
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:10:14 heres a pic
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:10:42 oh and thats the red baron paint, I could get the normal black paint if that help
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:11:57 no
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:12:00 that would not be to scale
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:12:39 where I add
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:12:52 the tip of the wing is where the control surface work
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:13:12 I could add one more on each of the top wing but that would be half a block too long
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:13:29 the real plane control surface is like that but not that long
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:13:53 yea but like im running out of place to hide the motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:13:59 cuz if I could i would long ago
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:14:12 there are like som a bit exposed already
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:14:17 i dont want extras
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:14:38 cuz i paint it and hide as much as i can
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:15:30 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:15:31 yes he is
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:15:46 nah jk he have jet engine
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:16:16 welp gtg
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:16:25 ill try to motorlock some more control surface later
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:16:37 also the wings distant of my triplane is half a block too tall
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:16:42 so I have to redo the whole plane anyway
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:16:44 great job

plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:26:36 ok where is that
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:27:04 yea ik that
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:27:07 no shit

plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:33:05 is it now
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:33:19 tbh I never use it before but it look very useful to me
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:33:45 yea thats how camera works
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:33:55 nice
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:34:46 motorlock arent raelly confusion tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:35:37 put that in bug report pr something
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:36:31 ?
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:37:05 yid rsdy yho
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:37:09 its easy tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:37:37 im not looking at keyboard
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:39:48 ight im back
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:40:13 also how hard can motorlock be and can you give like some context
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:40:24 cuz like I rarely had any trouble with motorlocking
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:40:40 ok
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:40:47 yea
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:41:16 rarely tho tbh
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:42:02 its faster than motorlock at an angel occasionally
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:42:20 like
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:42:33 u use camera lock to make block go at an angel
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:42:47 angle
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:42:50 however you spell it
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:43:25 tho I don't use camera lock cuz im too lazy to learn how to do it
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:43:50 imagine mobile lol
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:44:03 yea true but that wouldnt be so easy I dont think
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:44:22 its fun tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:44:28 motorlocking
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:44:50 oh yea the thing at the bottom
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:44:57 that can be annoying
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:45:15 I wish I can just make like certain part all all of the motor go invisible
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:45:35 can't really look around in first person in my biplane cuz of that
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:46:23 sometimes it work but most the time it dont
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:46:51 yea
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:47:01 that and being abelt to make the motor base invisible
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:47:10 I dont want a god damn flat thing on my biplnae wing
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:47:15 not on the fokker no
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:48:08 i dont remember
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:48:18 i think last year
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:48:28 yea last summer i thinik
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:48:32 i dont remember
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:48:51 but like i remembering having to move my mouse around to control the plane n stuff
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:48:56 that sucks i hate that
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:49:16 at elast later on I learn to do keyboard only control
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:49:22 why mouse control its terrible
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:49:33 the only thing you should use it for is the gun and looking around]
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:49:47 you cant even look around in first person in mouse control
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:50:00 no
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:50:04 keyboard is good enough
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:50:12 its not even hard to hit
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:50:25 what kind of plane do you even use
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:50:47 also how are you supposed to do big planes with mouse control
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:51:08 mouse control is just annoying
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:51:40 yea i respect ur opinion n all but I just hate mouse control
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:51:50 I prefer looking around
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:52:09 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:52:11 but its trash
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:52:16 and
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:52:19 you cant do that in first person
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:52:26 whats the fucking point if you cant do that in first person
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:52:36 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:52:40 thats how i do first person
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:53:13 you zoom in thats cool and all with mouse only you cant manuever while looking arond
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:53:41 yea mix is good but its kinda annoying in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:53:44 i tried it before
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:54:00 cuz of the god damn fucking mouse control
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:54:21 nice biplane
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:54:58 also that motor is needed but man its annoying
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:55:12 cant look around in first person
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:56:44 how is mouse control any better than ground assault tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:58:13 lemme draw something out real quick
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:59:41 you could just like easily do a ground assult with keyboard control
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:59:53 its a fucking ground target
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 18:59:55 it dont fly around
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:00:09 just do a strafe or how ever you spell it
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:01:18 ok what kind of plane do you use
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:01:45 let me guess modern to ww2 planes
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:01:50 yea show plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:01:57 I use bi and tri planes
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:02:20 imagine not caring about looks
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:02:35 imagine imagining
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:03:01 what's the point if its not tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:03:50 tbh I care more about the scale and accurate speed
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:04:02 so like gotta make sure the plane is not too big or fast
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:04:11 tho the speed is never fucking perfect
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:04:22 and making shit 1:1 is tiring
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:05:08 what you mean u cant kill noob car without style
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:05:24 I have a motherfucking fokker dr1 triplane that look kinda shit ngl
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:05:26 and it work well
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:05:41 this stupid fucker
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:05:48 tbh I rarely use the redbaron paintjob one
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:06:00 it dont even look good
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:06:10 and the wing distant is too far apart
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:06:23 I have to lower them by half a block so its more scale accurate
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:06:30 yea show
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:07:16 ah I'm really pissed about my fokker
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:07:25 the wings are half a block too far apart
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:09:19 real thing was supposed to be something like in the left while look at my shitass
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 19:09:45 thins is like the whole continent of africa apart

plane-crazy 2020-12-09 20:33:44 h8ce
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 20:42:21 ok yea you really need to pull acrobatic moves to manuever the triplane

plane-crazy 2020-12-09 20:44:01 bruh

plane-crazy 2020-12-10 14:59:22 and most exciting of all: trenches
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 14:59:31 that's what make it so good
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 14:59:48 with new technology and old tactics
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 15:00:51 that's what make ww1 so interesting
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 15:00:57 all the new technologies n stuff
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 15:01:28 treaty of verssiles is 1919
plane-crazy 2020-12-10 15:01:44 war end on 11/11/1918
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 13:58:07 what are you making tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:28:07 jsut get something fast and or manueverable
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:28:18 its that easy
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:28:35 nah thats boring
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:28:42 jsut get something fast and manueerable
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:28:48 a slow moving biplane if you have to
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:29:11 most the time I dodge shredders with my triplane that have a max speed of 140
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:30:00 I like ww1 stuff more so fer fast thing is not possible
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:30:26 idk if u want to
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:31:21 ww2 sucks
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:31:25 ww1 is the superior war
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:32:11 then make propellor planes
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:33:54 the only ww2 stuff i have left is a tutorial stug a thats made into a stug g
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:33:59 correct number of wheels n all
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:34:21 might as well just delete that and replace it with a ww1 tank instead
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:34:25 oh thats nice
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:34:40 dude
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:34:49 that look better than most public server lads
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:38:58 I kid you not i'm a terrible bomb aimer
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:39:19 since the bomb go in a straight line if I miss the first one to a side I miss all of them
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:39:26 since there are 6 boms and I drop them all manually
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:39:35 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:39:37 thats what I do
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:39:41 but 6 bombs only
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:39:42 no more
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:39:49 maybe 1 more but like
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:39:57 its a ww1 plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:40:04 its around 6 to 7 bombs only
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:40:09 and I drop each one manually
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:40:31 motorlock the bomb then drop each one manually
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:40:50 lemme draw out the thing i have
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:41:06 like i have a thing like it could work for modern planes with lots of bombs
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:45:39 something like this
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:45:50 like u strap a bunch of boms together with motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:46:01 and like u drop several one at a time or just 1 at a time
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:46:11 look man im using my mouse to do it not a drawing pad
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:46:26 so basically its carpet bombing
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:46:59 so like u can put a bunch of bomb in a small place and drop them one after another
plane-crazy 2020-12-11 14:47:03 making the carpet bomb thing

plane-crazy 2020-12-21 20:20:16 supposed to be this
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 20:20:30 overlapping wheels n all

plane-crazy 2020-12-21 22:47:36 thats an easy fix at least
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 22:47:55 but god dammit it would have an incorrect number of wheel if I make it look bbetter
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 22:47:57 aa
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 22:48:44 something like this rn

plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:32:44 shift and ctrl is honestly the best key for accelerating and decelerating
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:33:08 w and s is best for pitch
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:33:36 ah I ate
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:33:44 time to torture myself trying to make the god damn turret

plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:42:06 ok how do I make these thing stick
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:42:11 cuz i put cameras in and it didnt work

plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:45:53 not interested in pvp
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:46:00 im not making this tank for pvp
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:46:44 tbh pvp have always been the last thing i put in my builds
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:46:53 not saying it look good or anything

plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:51:34 man this sucks idk what to do about the turret
plane-crazy 2020-12-21 23:52:27 in a 1 block high turret is kinda tuff u know

plane-crazy 2021-01-03 20:36:32 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 14:39:47 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 14:45:56 a
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:33:28 you jsut put 4 wheel on a platform what do you expect
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:34:26 seriously what did you expect gonna happen
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:34:41 you didn't even put the wheel on right
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:35:16 can you like tell me what 180kmh is in the in game speed
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:35:48 thx
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:36:20 u need the tail wings
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:36:54 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:37:15 you need this
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:37:33 oh thx
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:37:41 well that help a lot
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:37:47 kmh is easy to understand
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:38:09 im pretty sure thats the opposite way but ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:38:52 yea
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:40:02 aaaaa
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:40:18 my fokker dr1 need to go 40sps faster
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:40:34 to reach the max speed of 180
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:40:50 its imperfect it hurt my brain
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:42:14 ur not supposed to like to full speed in a turn
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:42:21 that's a recepie for disaster
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:42:42 you ever see a train go full speed in a turn
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:42:55 you mean a flipping train
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:43:29 I remember seeing a vid of a bullet train going full speed over a turn and flip or something
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:46:03 yea thats how you fly off the rail
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:46:13 get some thruster to push the thing down
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:46:38 if not the whole thing is gonna fly off the rail
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:47:34 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:49:10 it do be slowing down in the turn
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:49:23 try making a to scale version of some vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:50:00 like seriously
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:50:09 try to make something that is as to scale as you possibly can
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:50:14 its painfuyl to do
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:51:47 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:52:40 how
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:53:01 ok now how do I make my triplane go 40 speed faster
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:53:14 yea as if I can just put one in
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:53:43 the amount of motorlock is already a bit too much for the as much to scale as I can triplane
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:57:23 yea good luck
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:57:39 cool
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:59:15 idk what to make tbh
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:59:40 im too lazy to design a capitol ship, but i want to take a break from ww1 for now
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:59:43 and say no to ww2
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:00:57 nah that design is not my favorite
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:01:56 again that design is not my favorite
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:02:14 tbh im not thinking about making ships
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:02:42 made the smol tiger recently
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:03:13 this thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:03:26 tried to make it to scale but it turn out to be too small
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:04:11 yea
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:04:21 I tried to make it to scale
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:04:25 I tried
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:04:44 but the overlapping didn't really work since I can't motorlock blocks .25 block away
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:04:58 so I can't have actual good looking overlapting wheel
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:05:08 god dammit german why you need to make ur wheel overlap
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:05:17 I just want to make a to scale version of the god damn tank
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:06:33 aaaaa
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:08:59 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:09:03 just don't lock it
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:09:08 then people can just open
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:13:03 I blame overlapping wheels
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:14:00 I can't make actual good overlapping wheel with half cylinder without a bunch of more motorlock then there already is
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:17:02 maybe ill make the to scale stug 3 next
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:17:17 I kinda have an idea of how the wheel is gonna work
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:18:03 what did you expect
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:18:10 that's why I said good luck when you decided to post
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:22:21 existing
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:24:15 heli is not that hard tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:24:34 jsut dont make the stupid heli with the 2 thing on top like
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:24:44 why people make heli with 2 rotor
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:24:56 the thing is just annoying to look at and to control
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:26:19 I kinda want to make something from star wars but what should I make tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:27:33 no rebellion or sequel trilogy vehicles tho since those are boring
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:33:18 dew it
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:44:12 go to the prequels, pick a random vehicle and make it
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:44:59 seriously the prequels have a lot of things to pick from
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 16:45:04 wether it be military or not
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 17:20:42 lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 17:20:46 imagine

plane-crazy 2021-01-05 20:34:09 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 20:55:37 ight i got the angle down at least
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 20:57:54 man
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 20:58:02 having a physical model of what ur making really help\
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:04:06 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:08:27 supposed to be a tie defender
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:08:29 now its better
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:08:46 ah fuwy the angle need to be different
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:10:37 ik
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:10:39 also
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:10:45 i need suggestion here
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:11:15 is this angle good or no
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:13:14 oh nice arquiten
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:15:21 ight thx
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:24:26 ok thats too short
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:24:32 look funny lool
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:27:16 thats a good start
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:29:35 tie defender
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:30:44 the best tie varriant
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 21:33:40 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 22:30:31 i just realized that my tie defender wing is not wide enough
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 22:30:38 time to do some motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 22:44:11 i just started making it
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 22:44:28 wing is a tad too short in width rn
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 22:45:51 since i have a tie defender model
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 22:45:55 i can use that as reference
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 22:46:24 its just the cockpit is a bit too big for that thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 22:53:53 what u mean
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 22:53:56 what is new
general 2021-01-05 23:12:27 SUICHAN WAAAAAA
general 2021-01-05 23:12:34 kou mo kawaii
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 23:23:27 turn out the distant between the cockpit and the wings are a block too short so I dont need to do any motorlock yet
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 23:30:04 there you are
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 23:32:52 how so gimme idea
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 23:33:29 no
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 00:03:37 ok now how the hell am I gonna make the thing fly
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 00:27:03 slow
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 01:45:54 trying to make the tie defender fly is a nightmare
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 01:50:05 anyway to make this thing roll faster
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 02:07:49 a fuck it I give up
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 02:08:35 why does making a tie defender have to be so hard
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 02:11:18 unless you make a speed accurate tank or something you shouldn't need to complain about suicide cars
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 02:11:39 if its not speed accurate then those shouldnt be a problem
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 02:12:56 im not defending it, trust me i hate it but sucide cars are no where near as bad as shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 02:13:10 unrealistic speed is cringe
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 02:13:27 imagine a ww1 tank that move more than 20 sps
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 02:16:52 suicide car? you mean cancer cube with bomb
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 14:22:20 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 14:22:30 triagnle block wedge
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 14:22:36 its in wedge 2
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 14:22:54 cool
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 14:22:59 good luck on whatever u doing
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:29:14 suffering
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:31:04 question
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:31:19 is the base of the disconnector like as thick as the wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:31:31 oh
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:31:43 well that sucks
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:34:03 wait so
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:34:15 which one take less space
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:34:20 conveyor engine or hover engine
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:34:23 oh shit
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:34:28 good luck
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:34:40 ok so hover take less space
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:34:45 rip my man
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:34:48 good luck
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:35:04 ight im gonna try the hover engine on my tie defender later
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:35:38 how many
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:36:14 cuz im trying to make this thing fly
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:37:39 the amount of wing panel on this thing make it unflyable
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:39:31 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:40:44 can u like give an example
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:40:51 since ive never use hover engine before
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:41:13 what next
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:41:31 ight
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:41:50 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:42:13 at least that I know how to do
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:42:18 ight
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:42:55 got it
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:43:00 im not plannig to go that fast
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 15:43:17 ill be happy if it reach 400
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 16:09:12 yes i know it is possible, im just trying to figure out a way to make it possible
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 16:14:13 lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 16:21:02 ah yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 16:26:32 nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 16:31:37 I think his hull kinda broke
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 16:33:53 oh yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 17:27:37 a
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 18:19:32 motorlock is love motorlock is live
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 18:20:10 good luck
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 18:20:17 wait hol up
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 18:20:30 how big or small is it gonna be
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 18:21:01 and do you plan to put tracks on or no
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 18:21:06 yea nobody cares
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 18:21:15 the design look nice thats all taht matter
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 18:21:33 what's the point if it dont look at least some what nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 18:22:14 <@!781206492187590656>

plane-crazy 2021-01-06 18:25:23 now it is perfect
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 18:26:36 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 18:32:40 lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 18:32:50 yea that creeper do look like hw ants to die
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:35:25 ah shit here we go again
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 19:36:47 lol this dude
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 20:02:13 man why can't motor 2 just have lock
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 20:05:16 angle thats why
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 20:05:34 its easier to angle with motor 2 then motor1
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 20:05:48 I want the exact angle to the exact degree
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 20:06:06 I dont want to eyeball the thing that is supposed to be symetrical
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 20:06:15 however you spell that
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 20:11:14 yea but like thats not very easy you know
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 20:11:22 having to make it so it stop at a specific angle
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 20:11:32 not 2 angle off it look weird
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 20:11:40 degree
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 20:12:47 im trying to make a tie defender
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 20:21:56 ok at least it fly now
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 20:44:45 holy shit it can fly
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 21:01:27 ok why is this happening
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 21:06:22 and you call yourself a 7 year old car designer

plane-crazy 2021-01-06 21:42:54 what engine is the fastest engine
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 21:43:02 wait no the most compact
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 21:43:10 conveyor or magnet
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 21:43:15 not those
plane-crazy 2021-01-06 21:43:22 conveyor or magnet which one is smaller
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 02:45:16 nice

creations-chat 2021-01-07 04:22:37 any feedback on this, like anything i can improve on
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:24:59 general kenobi
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:25:19 isnt there llike a channel where u can join the plane crazy communities and what not
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:25:23 like a specific one
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:25:32 o
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 04:25:43 so like anyway to find those communities
creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:02:58 Go ahead, good luck if you decided to make it
creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:49:45 The double main rotor mostly, also the design just look bad imo
creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:52:12 Try basing it off real helicopters it help, also make it so the rotors are more realistic and have one at the front and a small one at the back instead of 2 at the front
creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:54:56 It's not that hard the design, use the stuff in the half block section it helps and it helps a lot
creations-chat 2021-01-07 05:57:36 That's where ballast blocks and helium blocks comes in, also motorlock too
creations-chat 2021-01-07 06:00:20 It is difficult but manageable. Ur not making it to scale now are you, it wouldn't be very difficult, also use motorlocking too it help
creations-chat 2021-01-07 06:03:44 It don't need to be a perfect ti scale, hell it don't even need to be to scale, to scale stuff is just like a thing you do if you want it that way
creations-chat 2021-01-07 06:05:46 Also you don't need to make it a perfect replica either, just use the real thing as reference and to make the general shape better and what not
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 13:10:48 what tank is that tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 13:12:59 ok nvm idk about modern tank so I cant' give a say here

plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:54:51 oh
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:54:56 imperial shuttle
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:55:06 well since I just made the tie defender that might not be as hard
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:55:31 ight imma try to it the next time I want to make something
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:56:03 what u mean
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:56:07 care to elaborate
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:56:25 oh you mean like the missile wont hit my tie defender?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:57:01 if ur talking about the missile kinda always miss I think i know why
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:57:11 its prolly cuz of the odd shape so the missle lock on to the wings or somethign
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:57:28 its like
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:57:36 it prolly targeting the wings
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:57:40 so it miss
help 2021-01-10 03:58:23 do speaker have the same weight as normal block
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:58:51 yea it target the wings that the answer that make the most sense
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:59:01 and yea no close tracking wouldnt definately hit
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:59:17 cuz once I stop moving im a dead man
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:59:37 so that make sense
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:59:46 why missle sometimes just miss my triplane
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:59:54 cuz of one of the thing have an angle
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:00:23 def will hit with no tracking
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:00:40 tbh i wish that missile would turn not as sharp but would track sooner and turn more
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:00:43 you know what i mean
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:01:02 instead of turing 1 meter infront of the thing it turn from further away but slower
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:01:21 yea ik that
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:01:30 but it just dont feel very right
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:01:43 yea
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:01:58 thats one of the best part of the current missle
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:02:04 also do you have speaker
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:02:10 cuz i have question about it
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:02:13 o ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:02:16 its mostly the weight
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:02:25 idk if the speaker weight is any different from a normal block
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:03:26 man making the tie defender alone is nothing
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:03:31 but making it fly is a nightmare of its own
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:03:51 I gotta first use hover engine since its the most compact but the thing only move at 200 speed
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:03:54 making it a turtle
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:03:58 for the size
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:04:13 so I switched to the conveyor engine and the real nightmare begin
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:04:28 trying to make the thing can actually go straight is man i dont think im gonna ever forget that
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:04:48 it work for me now
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:05:02 it can move at 500 sps to msot teh time
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:05:09 600 if i just go straight i think
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:05:16 and it do go straigjht
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:05:21 no up or down or anything
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:05:35 really
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:05:44 cuz my thing fly smooth
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:05:51 it dont manuver as well but it is smooth
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:05:56 wanna see ill try to record
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:06:12 ight wait a bit lemme record
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:08:38 do you realize how wrong that statement is

plane-crazy 2021-01-10 18:05:24 i think u can just max out the torque
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 20:11:56 this is gonna take a while
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 20:20:09 https://streamable.com/cwpjdh

plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:24:26 ok I managed to get the thing to walk now I have to design the walker itself
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:24:29 this is pain
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:26:18 public pvp is just chaos
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:27:28 how was pvp before
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:27:38 yea still abusable
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:28:04 elaborat
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:28:06 e
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:28:17 ok I can see that that is actually fun
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:28:41 sounds fun
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:28:50 but mouse control
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:29:15 to be fair if you have friends its usualyl always more fun
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:29:50 tbh pvp just get boring after awhile
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:30:33 unless you have frieds with you its just you against someone you dont know that either have tutorials or shredders
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:31:02 and dudes with tutorial plane with all the possible guns strap on it
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:31:08 o that sounds fun
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:32:14 public pvp starter pack:
tutorial planes with all guns strap on
lag machine
shredder bugs
spam cars
youtube tutorials
that one dude that want to enjoy the game
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:32:40 those are more rare on pvp
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:32:52 yea they are nice but very rare on pvp
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:33:03 good for you man
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:33:28 at least there are still some sane people that would gang up against shredder
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:33:57 for me the pvp is just a second thought
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:34:03 i mean after thought
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:34:13 can it pvp? if it cant strap a gun somewhere that is not visible
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:34:47 at least the reason i play pc is just to make something
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:35:07 cuz tbh i hate making meta stuff
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:35:16 i just make whatever im in the mood for
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:35:23 and im not making the fokker dr1 go 400 sps
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:35:52 lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:36:04 yea seriously tho tryhards are just annoying
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:36:28 i dont mind the all guns one shot you if im going to be honest but like it just dont suit the game for me
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:36:39 if ur gonna make all guns one shot almost then make the game realistic overall
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:36:43 like standard issue
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:36:48 that game is nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:37:01 i cant remember the last time playing that game
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:37:50 suit urself I guess but tbh i dont mind those
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:38:22 yea thats how i feel
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:38:39 yea
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:39:09 although tbh i never liked the old combat system of minecraft
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:39:26 i get why people like it but like the post 1.9 combat is just better for me
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:42:15 yea thats why i dont like the combat its just spam click
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:42:41 yea
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:43:41 yea lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:43:55 like for example dream stans they are just plain annoying
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:44:12 like i understand enjoying his content cuz i do occasionally
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:44:18 but like his fans
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:44:59 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 21:45:43 yea

plane-crazy 2021-01-11 18:14:10 lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 18:22:24 o shit i just realized that i can make the whole atte turn using just the leg, since there are only 2 motor that actually do the rotating to make the whole walker move
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 18:22:31 im gonna do that before making the frame
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 19:37:35 blessed tank
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 19:45:23 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 19:59:48 is there any block that have like this kind of thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:01:06 oof that sounds like a pain so im not gonna
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 23:44:34 this is the back I guess
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 23:44:46 man i gotta do the angles n stuff too
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 23:44:52 thats gonna be tough
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 00:03:56 occasionally yea
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 00:04:10 if you post a meme build that is not high effort its a 50/50 cahnce

plane-crazy 2021-01-12 16:17:39 the first several seconds sound like part of the doom ost ngl
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 16:18:39 im talking about the sound of the propeller

plane-crazy 2021-01-12 21:24:59 thats just the back
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 21:25:09 i've spent the last 2 hour trying to make that back

plane-crazy 2021-01-13 01:03:05 this is a certified clone wars moment
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 02:09:01 oh I feel bad for vip 1
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 02:09:08 they about to crash it
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 02:17:28 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 02:30:03 how
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 02:30:39 lol
the-dump 2021-01-13 02:38:55 
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:06:53 
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:07:49 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:07:56 it is painful making the angle go right and not mess up the walking mechanism
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:08:08 the walking mechanism is based off a lego video so it work perfectly
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:08:34 well it dont turn with motor tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:08:38 cuz the timing is hard
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:08:46 turning with motor is possible and it do that very well
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:09:00 but I have to use 2 key for forward 2 keyfor backward
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:09:04 like a ttank
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:09:33 but unlike a tank this doesnt work as easily because I have to make the timing of the leg right
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:09:37 get a rank
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:11:26 you said we

plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:12:18 go through those 2 channel it tell u
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:13:58 ight fair enough, now if you excuse me imma run before you shoot up another school
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:15:01 ight ill show you
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:16:15 I use this design
https://youtu.be/cZa-IWwk36s?t=93
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:16:19 this walking mechanic
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:16:26 thats how my walker walk
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:17:01 it might be confusing at first but once you know how that work its easy
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:17:45 like legit its very easy once you understand
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:18:17 its one of those things that are a lot more simple than it look
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:21:11 https://youtu.be/wTH3Y0FFVPc?t=155 this will help, thats what I use
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:21:51 slow the vid down if you need or watch the whole thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:22:01 but like that latter vid is the one that I use
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:22:07 and the walking machanism is basically that
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:22:22 so i just need to press a button and it just walk or reverse automatically
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:22:32 yea cuz the second one is the build vid
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:25:39 you can but I just use propeller for turning since I don't need to time the thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:25:55 cuz for turning with the legs alone you need to time the thing which is kinda tuff sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:26:00 so I just use propeller
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:26:07 but it is possible to turn the thing with just hte legs
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:26:25 not tricky
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:26:27 just hte timing
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:26:46 yes thats what i said
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:26:51 its easy to mess up the timing
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:26:55 yea exactly
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:27:08 so thats why I just use propeller for unified walking
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:28:03 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:28:25 welp imma go sleep i have midterms tomorrow
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:28:26 bye
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:35:09 If ur talking about the walker than you only need 2 motor that have power to move the whole thing if not the my bad bye
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 13:47:01 the
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 14:15:13 progpress so far lool
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 14:15:59 smh
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 14:58:38 imagine if lag isn't a thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 14:58:59 that would be the dream man
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 14:59:05 no lag ever
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 14:59:30 like imagine tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 14:59:41 everyone in the server with a 5kblock builds and no lag

plane-crazy 2021-01-13 15:48:07 every time you spawn in anything that have any kind of in game engine it make that noise
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 15:48:16 and its god damn loud
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 16:21:44 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 16:22:34 nothing wrong with that tho its not even a big wobble
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 16:32:45 no angle
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 16:34:20 thats not very green tho its more grey than green
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 16:34:51 yours is just pure green
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 16:35:05 yea do that also make the green a bit different
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 16:35:09 urs is a bit too green

plane-crazy 2021-01-13 17:50:09 yea but im trying to like put a cylinder here
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:01:26 god dammit i hate using sparklers as barrle cuz of the square base
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:01:33 wish i can just make that invisible
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:02:23 but cylinder are too big
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:02:32 like boi I wish tehres like smaller cylinder
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:05:47 oh boy the square bsae
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:07:05 how
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:07:38 and how long did it take to put all taht cameras in
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:08:37 lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 19:06:28 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 19:13:09 ik but its just annoying

plane-crazy 2021-01-13 19:49:36 wait where is the random blocks?
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 19:49:49 are you talking about the cityscape?
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 19:53:20 oh yea I see that now
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 19:53:31 yea instead of the blocks put in half block half wedge and all that
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 19:53:37 go into the half bloc ksection and use that
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 00:56:23 that is one funny looking self propelled gun
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 01:54:35 nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 12:51:41 idk just make the general shape of it first i guess
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 12:53:08 look in the half block and the 2 wedge section theres plenti of thing there
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 12:58:30 yea red do look better
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 18:50:34 control surface moment
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 18:51:06 oll
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 18:52:06 imagine using motorlock bomb
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 18:52:18 this post is made by the dropping 1 bomb at a time gang
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 18:52:36 nah
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 18:52:39 ww1 plane dont do that
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 18:52:45 only up to 6 or 7 bombs
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 18:52:54 drop each at a time to carpet bomb
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 18:52:59 imagine not using ww1 planes
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 18:53:11 bi planes are superior to all planes
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 18:53:21 imagine jet
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 18:53:24 kinda cringe
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 18:53:50 you cant even take out a pistol and shoot the enemy plane with a jet
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 18:55:48 prossessing video
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 18:56:36 why do that biplane look like some kind of tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 18:57:39 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMZQ328YZeI
it look like this
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 18:59:41 jets are just boring tbh
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:00:22 nah its just boring in general, I don't hate it but I don't love it either
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:00:50 yea if you like it
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:01:14 I just find the look of modern jets kinda boring
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:01:31 im not trying to make it go 2400
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:01:47 if im gonna make a biplane or any plane im gonna make it speed accurate
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:01:57 no way in hell im not making a biplane go anywhere near 400
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:02:02 or 300
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:02:13 I hate making stuff that are not speed accurate
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:02:56 that is the point
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:03:32 not if urs is a biplane
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:05:33 
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:06:18 because i try to make it as to scale as I can
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:06:24 i dont want it to be over scaled
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:06:51 its eitehr that or too big
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:07:11 i tried that
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:08:21 its around the right size, tho the angle is not right at all sadly
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:09:09 2 block tall its not as tall as the dude
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:09:18 the thing that make it higher is the wheel
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:09:44 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:09:55 now that i think about it i gotta fiz the landing gear
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:10:03 its not tall enough
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:05:21 there is no such thing as too much motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:06:23 i dont think so
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:06:26 but ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:07:10 with some complex motorlock and angling you can
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:07:31 I didnt read that tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:07:52 so like u know how you can change the angle of the stuff with toggled motorlock right
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:08:13 so the same concept but change the angle so that it perfectly allign so it move .25 blocks away
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:08:20 in theory it should work
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:09:01 pog
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:09:23 more motor to change the angle like how you would do it
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:09:32 like you can make custum angles with motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:09:42 do the same thing but allign it so it move .25 block back
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:09:48 same thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:09:57 it is
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:09:58 like
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:10:04 a god dammit im taking out ms paint
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:11:05 something like this the red thing is motor
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:11:43 it do
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:11:54 im not saying you move the moor upward
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:11:57 its the same way a leg work
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:12:33 im hoping on the game
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:15:25 something like this
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:15:50 but more accurate since I did that in a minute or less
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:16:05 its exactly the same thing I did in the diagram
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:16:37 the accuracy could be improve but then again this is a half minute thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:16:57 so now its not just in theory it work for real
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:17:23 I'm not even some kind of mechanic and i figured it out its that easy
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:17:56 its bound to happen since since they are donators
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:18:39 they either chill or karen
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:19:55 lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:20:24 then do it
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:30:24 cool
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:36:47 jet moment
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:37:01 ah yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:37:36 me waiting for crazy in plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 21:39:30 me wating

general 2021-01-15 04:42:16 
general 2021-01-15 04:42:35 same ^
general 2021-01-15 04:42:41 oh bruh you ruined it
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 20:16:43 cool
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 02:16:49 yea that chair look better than that fokker dr1 no offense
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 02:17:35 lots of inaccurate things
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 23:56:06 almost there
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 23:56:10 now I gotta finnish the front
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:01:51 bruh mouse control
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:02:08 e
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:03:05 glitched mouse control
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:04:02 so like basically u put a normal polit seat in the plane and have the main pilot seat outside connected to an anchor block
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:36:10 is there a way to like
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:36:23 wait lemme just make the thing its easier to ask that way
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:39:10 ok so this
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:39:15 https://streamable.com/365xv6
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:39:21 is there a way to make that but like
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:39:26 its connected
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:39:32 like
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:40:00 yea basically
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:40:05 yes yes exactly that
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:40:08 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:40:19 so its always in perfect sync
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:40:26 thats what i tried
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:40:36 it doesnt stay in sync forever
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:40:58 but what
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:41:02 o ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:41:34 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:41:44 since like with real gear and motor it would be easier
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:41:51 but i cant do that in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:42:42 so like
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:42:50 i want the thing to go perfectly in sunc
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:43:03 it work but like when put into a walker it go off balance
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:43:17 i tried to lock the motor
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:43:21 doesn't help
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:43:53 so like
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:44:01 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:44:06 since im making a 6 legged walker
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:44:26 i mean if that dont work the last reseort would be just control both leg individually
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:45:06 no so like
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:45:14 the 6 leg thing is not the problem
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:45:31 since only 2 leg move and the other 4 just move thanks to the other 2 legs
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:45:32 its just
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:45:40 those 2 need to be in sync
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:45:56 lemme just record
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:46:08 so wait 3 minutes
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:46:18 go back to 90 degree
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:47:34 ight its loading
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:47:46 yea i tried that trust me
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:48:12 https://streamable.com/07ty88
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:48:14 there
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:48:45 the one in the middle is the one
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:49:42 that's what im trying to do\
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:49:54 that is exactly what I am trying to do
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:50:30 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:50:52 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:50:55 or just like 2 way motor
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:51:03 god dammit that would be very useful man
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:51:51 maybe ill just control each side individually
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:53:01 yea but like at least i control each side individually so i can fix it
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:54:03 yea thats what i did its just painful for walker tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:54:10 for tanks its no problem but for walkers
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:54:30 pain
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:54:49 lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 01:30:28 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 01:33:23 seriously what is wrong
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 01:48:44 bruh i figured out the problemn
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 01:48:51 its 2 cylinder that cause teh whole mess
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 01:48:57 2 cylinders
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 01:49:34 this is caused by 2 cyl
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 01:51:06 no it gotta stay unsync cuz controling both legs undividually is kinda tuff to time
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 01:51:41 look at the leg
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 01:52:12 
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 01:52:14 i already fixed it
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 01:52:18 its 2 cylinders that cause it
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 01:52:27 i remove those and its all fine now
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 01:52:30 o tell me

plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:28:59 I base the thing off a lego video I watch
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:29:54 I based the walking mechanism off a lego video I watched months ago

plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:47:14 here's a tip for you, suffer
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:47:39 building a walker is already painful enough and now you want to make a mech
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:48:00 god damn im still having ptsd from that at te and i havent even finished it yet
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:48:32 just slap 2 sticks and call it a day
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:49:30 ok send ur mech
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:49:55 how can i jsut get a design if idk what ur mech look like
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:50:43 where picture
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:51:19 what is he a bionicle?
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:52:06 
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:52:33 kinda looks like one
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:53:06 cool
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:56:07 so maybe like do the same thing with ur leg idk
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 20:56:22 and one hand is a weapon and the other is a normal one

plane-crazy 2021-01-27 19:30:22 imagine making herrier lmao
plane-crazy 2021-01-27 20:59:20 it look good so far
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 02:37:05 nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 02:37:17 disconnector
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 02:37:23 looks more like that
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 02:38:15 e
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 02:38:32 lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:48:54 isd don't have point defense thats why
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:49:07 also that star destroyer bridge is too big
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:49:50 no seriously tho its not supposed to be that big
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:50:05 its hurting my eyes
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:50:54 if ur gonna make a star destroyer at least make it proportionally correct
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:52:00 my dude jsut make the shape and proportion right or something its not that hard
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:52:24 its not like ur making a walking at te with 6 legs and it gotta go smoot hand the design have to not touch the motherfucking walking mechanism
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:52:45 that is based of a mechanism that I based it off from a lego video of an at te that i found interesting
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:53:09 that I for some god forshaken reason decided to build it based of the motherfucking god damn mechanism from real life to fucking plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:53:11 fuck me
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:53:53 the mechanism work perfectly fucking fine but I gotta have to build a motherfucking phrame around that so that it can actually work and look like a mother fucking atte  for god fucking sake
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:54:36 so ur motherfucking star destroyer dont even have a semi level 2 complex not very hard walking mechanism what is ur fucking excuse for not having the thing to be at least proportionally correct
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:56:04 sorry i just still a bit stress about the unfinnished at te that I gotta fucking finnish at some point that means I gotta have to fucking complete the phrame around it and make it so the leg could actually move in sync cuz theres no 2 way motor
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:56:54 walking mechanism is easy to understand
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:57:13 https://youtu.be/cZa-IWwk36s
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:57:18 this is the walking mechanism
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:58:23 only 2 motor is on
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:58:32 each motor control the middle leg
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:58:43 and that leg is connected to the back and front leg
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:59:05 yea its simmilar to that
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 16:59:39 yea i wanna do that to but thing is gotta make it so its not gonna be in the way
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:00:36 biplanes are more beautiful imo
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:01:12 imagine modern plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:01:24 you cant even take out a pistol and shoot the other plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:01:33 cool
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:02:50 doesn't matter its boring
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:02:59 bunch of missiles and rockets
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:03:37 doesn't matter which one is better in combat also im a bad pilot
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:03:42 biplanes are just superior
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:04:29 ew control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:04:46 also that biplane look like a youtube tutorial ngl
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:04:55 fair enough
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:05:05 yea im pretty sure thats supposed to be a bomber or something
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:05:12 its not even big enough
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:06:04 yup that is a tutorial bomber
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:06:12 they have bombs on fucking wing
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:06:15 thats just bad
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:07:01 modern planes are just boring
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:07:06 also why that dude just flying straight
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:07:14 dudes not a bomber
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:07:32 hes not even lifting off
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:07:50 yea but they slower
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:08:11 so like
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:08:18 they would go straight more than say a fighter
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:08:34 no, speed accurate is the only way
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:08:39 im not making a ww1 plane that go at 500
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:09:09 these are the bombers im talking about
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:09:20 the cool one
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:11:27 nice ship
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:17:15 I think im gonna make this next after im done with the at te
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:17:20 something simple
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:17:23 a Fokker D7
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:17:53 sould be easier than the Fokker Dr1
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:17:58 since biplane not triplane
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:19:58 cool
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:47:36 something from ww1
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:48:27 dude about to die of g lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:48:41 ah yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:51:11 yea thats cool and all but can you fly in first person
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:51:17 and by that i mean zoom in first person
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:51:22 not the in game one where u cant look around
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:52:34 wasd qe just work for me tbh
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:52:46 like mouse control is cool and all but i just hate it
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:52:59 I might learn glitch mouse control but I hate jets so i doubt i will do that
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:53:39 yea but you always find a way around that
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:53:53 yea that is true
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:54:21 then you roll to aim, or use the rudder, there are plenty of way around it
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:55:50 e
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:58:39 glitched mouse works better with jets and what not imo
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:58:52 nic
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 17:58:55 nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 18:00:16 my tri plane cant do a barrle roll cuz  of physics sadly
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 18:00:25 the biplane can do it if i pull a bit of manuever
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 18:01:17 since triplane is slower than biplane and all
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 18:04:29 lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 13:08:32 maybe hide the guns and what not
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 13:08:40 it look decend I guess
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:47:29 man my tie defender was slow back then
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:47:35 it can barely roll
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:47:36 https://streamable.com/0k917o
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:47:46 this a tad better
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:48:14 tho i gotta really learn to fly i suck at it
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:48:58 i mean just look at this speed, this is supposed to be a tie defender
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:48:59 https://streamable.com/lu4o53
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:50:01 oh yea I did
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:50:08 it use hover engine before
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:50:23 im pretty sure thers some design that use wing panel or control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:50:50 well hover engine was too weak until i finally was able to fit in the conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:52:35 cant find the gif
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:52:51 did you see the amount of wing panels and what not on that thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:52:54 its a motherfucking tie defender
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:53:07 thing look like this
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:53:13 wing panels and what not create drag
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:53:16 a lot of drag
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:53:27 that slow down the thing a lot
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:53:47 yea i know but the general shape make it harder
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:53:53 also show example
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:53:58 ofthe thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:56:21 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:59:07 yea but the surface area is very small
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:59:23 my thing have like 6 wings taht are bigger tahn teh cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 16:59:39 and it doesnt help taht the cockpit is a circle at the back
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:00:01 I never said that block produce drag
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:00:17 what i say is like there are 6 wings which each of the is bigger than the cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:00:27 and I gotta keep the engine somewhat compact too
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:00:37 engien thats why
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:00:58 I gotta keep the cockpit at least some what empty inside so i can get out
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:01:04 oh that make sense
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:01:12 3 hover would stick out my my thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:01:15 2 is the max
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:01:34 also i gotta make sure that the thing fly smooth
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:02:21 and also make sure that the amount of blocks is devidable by 5
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:07:30 that is the one?
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:07:54 that is like the same amount of surface area for the wings as the other one
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:07:56 just a tad more
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:08:12 that only cover like 2 of my wings
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:08:15 at best
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:08:20 in which tehre are 6
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:10:04 legit tho the amount of wing surface area is small on that plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:10:21 it is tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:10:25 just look at the thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:11:07 its pretty small
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:11:31 some super rocket will make the thing fly
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:13:02 not to mention u only have 2 wings not counting hte rudder
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:13:20 only 2 wings
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:13:46 i have 6 that are longer
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:14:00 each is like 4 blocks wide and at least 12 long
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:14:09 didnt meassure how long but at least 12 im pretty sure
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:15:03 yea i thought so
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:15:24 the rectangular part in each wing is 5x4
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:15:48 so like the surface area of the rectangular part is like 120 block
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 17:15:58 not mentioning the triangle part
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 18:24:43 e
creations-chat 2021-01-29 18:29:12 yes, if its gonna look better
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 18:30:35 could you switch to day time
creations-chat 2021-01-29 18:44:40 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 19:04:55 man i should have tried to make an at st or at at instead of the at te
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 19:05:05 god damn 6 legged motherfucker messed up my brain
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 19:05:18 the mechanism is easy but I have to make teh fucking thing dont touch it
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 19:05:59 the frame keep touching the god damn walking mechanism its makign me want to die
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:51:09 ok wtf is that
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:52:03 yea seems cursed alright

plane-crazy 2021-02-01 06:55:03 i think imma make a ship
plane-crazy 2021-02-01 06:58:07 i think im gonna make the Junk class ship
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 16:23:39 rip
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 01:07:35 step 1: give up
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 01:40:22 so that is how it feels to drink acid
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 01:40:26 better get some
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 14:47:25 why must you torture the pilot this way
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 14:47:33 dude just wanna go home to his family man
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 14:48:09 yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 15:19:35 well depend on how heavy you are
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 15:19:58 i dont think a man weigh 1 ton can stand
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 15:20:50 well ur pilot decide to be obease
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 15:25:17 nice
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 15:25:23 man i wish i can do something that cool
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 15:26:04 this is the coolest thing I've ever made
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 15:26:34 yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 15:29:22 yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 15:33:07 nice
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 15:40:39 this is a certified gravity moment
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 15:48:54 imagine using missle or bomb
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 15:48:59 just make a laser beam or something
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 15:49:38 like just make a laser beam so you can re use it
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 15:50:07 <@!514333972189151233> nice suisei pfp
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 15:50:26 also guns are just point defense weapon make a laser beam as like the main weapon
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 15:50:41 oof
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 15:50:50 o yea speaking of magnet
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 15:50:53 u can make raygun
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 15:56:50 pain
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 16:37:16 sky
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 16:37:25 the sky is filled with cancer
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 16:38:04 at this point just re build the map and send it 10k blocks up the sky and re start from there]
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 16:38:10 rip ship
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 16:47:11 its not the same pfp but ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 16:47:12 sui
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 17:08:36 i can smell the lag from here
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 19:07:13 just go to google
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 19:07:20 and type copy paste circle
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 19:07:21 or something
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 19:07:42 http://www.i2symbol.com/symbols/circle
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 19:07:45 this might help
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 19:14:11 man
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 19:14:24 seeing jets do close quater dog fighting and what not just dont look right
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 19:51:34 tf is that
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 19:53:34 im not the guy that make that tho
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 19:53:42 so how am i supposed to know what it is
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:10:28 <@!625224427369660416> the thing is great but like the proportion is off, especially the front part
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:12:29 like basically the gap should be very thin, but man i like the interior, great job man 🙂
oh ok so about that you can use some folding and motor lock to get the angle right
but tbh i think u got the angle quite right its just a tad too short
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:14:30 yea like maybe make it like 2 1x4 wedge longer, so like basically 8 blocks longer that should look way better by then

fair enough
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:16:31 maybe I should start to make an arquitens light cruiser too
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:18:51 o ok fair enough
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:20:53 o man thats very nice
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:22:55 <@!625224427369660416> I think you misspelled Arquitens
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:25:17 lol
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:29:12 man i wish we can just make the base of hte sparker invisible, better yet, if only theres the smaller cylinder that is the size of the sparkler, life would be so easier
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:31:16 the hetzer, give pain and ptsd to that maus commander
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:33:21 oh yea the tank in the show have a slightly darker color
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:35:37 color way darker =
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:38:08 yea that would be useful
the-dump 2021-02-03 20:41:22 yes
the-dump 2021-02-03 20:41:42 which vid is that from again i know its a tank fish vid but like forgot the context
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:47:39 people really do be making the tiananmen square meme without making the right tank smh
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:49:40 gameoing
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 14:01:14 at least you can color the thing
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 14:01:21 its decent tbh
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 14:22:32 better than most recreation tbh
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 14:22:46 the other one just use like cutter to make it
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 14:22:51 and the scale was too small for that
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 14:24:30 how do you not know of our lord and saviour best tank Bob Semple
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 14:25:38 you have to get it right tho
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 14:25:42 some people just make it flat
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 14:26:05 or too big of a gap
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 14:26:13 yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 14:26:18 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 14:26:24 thats how most people do it
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 14:31:53 i dont mind the color scheme but why the proportion is all wrong
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 14:32:14 why does it have to be wrong proportion
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 15:24:25 rip
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 19:30:27 i want to see the full video
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 18:28:29 wait did the game get like an optimization update recently or something
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 18:28:39 i just noticed that my tie defender fly a lot faster and smoother
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:12:26 very pog
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:32:54 so I just tried out the glitch mouse control thing
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:33:07 I like how it go tbh but man one thing really bug me
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:33:24 the fact that you have to move the cursor up to go up instead of down
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:33:26 like
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:33:35 how am i supposed to aim like that
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:34:47 thats what i mean
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:34:50 like legit
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:35:01 the normal glicthed mouse thing
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:35:06 i like the roll but the pitch man the pitch
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:35:15 wish I can reverse that some how
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:35:19 so I can actually aim
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:36:51 yea
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:37:01 or press s to pitch up and w to pitch down
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:37:04 its easy and make sense
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:37:57 why would use use s to pitch down
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:38:12 that is just confusing
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:38:31 magick moment
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:41:58 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:42:27 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:42:53 you pull the stick back when you go up not down
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:42:59 so you pull it backward
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:43:20 when i play something that require flying yea
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:43:35 well still
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:43:40 i wish i have like a
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:43:47 like a legit joystick for flying games
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:43:53 but again that cost monet
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:43:54 money
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:44:29 in plane crazy i also use reverse pitch control
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:44:35 it just work better for me
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:45:04 like it just make sense
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:45:11 thats how real plane work to if im correct
creations-chat 2021-02-05 19:52:09 what a fucking chad, he even did the white flag
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:58:40 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 20:20:14 SA
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 20:57:40 yes yes yes we should, finally about time theres some ww1 stuff
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 20:58:11 ww1 time
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 20:58:13 when

plane-crazy 2021-02-08 02:37:13 unless its a simple build
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 02:37:38 like if they can screenshot it from all angle and re create the best they can then that's dedication
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 02:37:52 o well that make sense
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 02:39:00 well that jsut make stuff useless now aint it

plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:47:59 it hurt my brain those gaps
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:49:15 same
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:49:45 also the y axis of the mouse control and glitched mouse control is reversed so when u pull down the plane go down instead of up
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:49:49 find that annoying
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:50:18 dude there is
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:50:22 its motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:50:32 that is like normal motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:52:04 yea
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:52:29 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 20:56:21 ight
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:06:20 couldn't you jsut put a max angle on it
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:06:37 like dont go pass this angle
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:07:17 o ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:08:32 test what

plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:11:32 well just paint the rest glass and make all it same color as sky
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 21:11:43 harder to see is better than standing out
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 01:21:10 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 14:40:01 mouth look a tad too long tbhh, like make it thicher or something
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 17:35:51 oh god is that the 1998 godzilla
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 17:36:07 it looks like it
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 17:38:09 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 17:51:20 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 17:58:42 just spam spawn i guess
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:15:47 yea
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 23:20:20 phat\
plane-crazy 2021-02-12 23:18:47 id say keep the shield
plane-crazy 2021-02-12 23:18:50 it look nice
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 04:59:32 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 18:45:25 the shape overall is kinda weird and yea turret is too far back
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 18:46:44 well this is plane crazy so cannon have to suffer
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 18:47:00 its either too big for u have to use the sparkler
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 18:47:12 but sparkler have the base thing so that look ugly
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 18:48:38 seriously tho the cylinder is painful man
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 18:48:52 like common cant we just have a thin cylinder man
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 18:49:03 we already got sparklers so its not impossible
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 19:03:54 you could use trail or like smoke or snow pip thing
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:26:30 is that a zeppelin staaken
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:26:35 r6
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:26:51 use like
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:27:04 trail or half wedge for the propellor
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:27:08 it look better that way
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:27:42 motorlock in some more engine
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:27:57 wing og in the way?
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:28:15 put engine inside plane
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:28:20 o nice
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:28:27 how fast it go
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:29:01 well that is acceptable speed
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:29:07 the real thing go a tad faster
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:29:09 35kmh more
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:29:21 yea do that id look better
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:29:29 tru
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:29:39 so around 100 is perfect for the thing
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:30:10 also use lighter color
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:30:13 good job tho
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:31:13 do it like this
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:31:18 not mine
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:31:33 oh and for the mg
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:31:41 ik what ur going for but thats oversize
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:31:47 tho its ur choice on that
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 05:32:15 id prefer to make it to scale if i can

plane-crazy 2021-02-25 21:00:32 when u make it
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 21:00:45 bottom have to be heavy and on top add helium
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 21:00:57 so the boat stay and not justflip
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 21:01:49 base it off a real ship
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 21:02:31 cuz thats what i did for mine
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 21:02:50 like it dont have to be a specific ship just a specific ship class
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 21:03:01 like a frigate, galleon or man o war
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 21:04:17 o thats big
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 21:04:33 id recommend starting with something smaller so u get used to it
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 21:04:41 like no need to be too small just like
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 21:05:15 like a brigantine
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 21:05:40 or if u wanna go a tad bigger do a galleon
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 21:06:23 like mine's a galleon
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 21:07:05 not that big
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 21:28:26 idk i dont do modern jet

plane-crazy 2021-02-25 21:39:01 I use half wedge, you could use whatever u want depend on how big the ship is
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:33:27 hey that look decent, id recommend using wood not wood plank for the hull of the ship
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:33:35 use woord plank for the part where u walk on
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:34:09 yea but they a pain to make
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:34:38 well yea depend on what it is
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:34:41 and how complex
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:35:01 lik i build a walkable at te based on a lego video that thing is  pain to make right
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:35:32 the leg have to go in sync and the mechanism have to not hit the very angled armor
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:36:27 well its different when you power a 6 legged walker with only 2 powered motor
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:36:36 and gotta make the thing fit into the frame
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 22:37:01 the pay off kinda worth it but the thing cant even go backward

plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:19:36 Oh it's me
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:21:26 Try using motor 2 set to servo
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:22:01 Same category
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:22:06 You see motor
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:22:12 Click it

plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:22:45 On the top wheel
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:22:56 Cuz that one will turn
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:23:30 Or just use engine to turn
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:23:48 It work
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:24:04 Well depend on the weight and all that
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:24:34 Yea that depend on how heavy the build is
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:25:10 Uea

plane-crazy 2021-03-15 19:26:57 25 or 30

plane-crazy 2021-03-17 01:15:30 its cool
plane-crazy 2021-03-17 01:15:38 cooler than global warming
plane-crazy 2021-03-17 16:23:41 if you talking the <:SoonTM:501066468629413916> kind of soon then yea
plane-crazy 2021-03-17 16:23:45 but the actual soon is no
plane-crazy 2021-03-17 16:28:34 couldnt you just
plane-crazy 2021-03-17 16:28:41 use an color picker thing online
plane-crazy 2021-03-17 16:29:16 https://html-color-codes.info/colors-from-image/ use this or something to get the color
plane-crazy 2021-03-17 16:29:21 good luck
plane-crazy 2021-03-17 16:30:22 nothing smart about it that is just better than write down the color till u get the right one

plane-crazy 2021-03-17 17:23:53 lol
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 16:58:28 is there like a way to make this thing turn aside from using engine
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 16:58:59 i mean like turning when not moving back or forward
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 16:59:03 so like i can turn on the spot
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 16:59:16 like how the actual tank turn
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 17:01:36 thats what i said
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 17:01:44 any other way to make it turn aside from using engines
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 17:02:43 where tho
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 17:03:02 where should i put the wheels
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 17:03:57 <:sus:805543105428193301>

plane-crazy 2021-03-19 14:43:39 pain
plane-crazy 2021-03-19 14:45:56 either make it follow ur mouse or make it a servo
plane-crazy 2021-03-19 14:46:01 or specific angle stuff
plane-crazy 2021-03-19 14:46:16 u can use it as control surface for plane
plane-crazy 2021-03-19 14:55:17 glass moment
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 17:51:07 cool
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 17:59:30 ok
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:25:56 ok
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:35:44 you ever just spent a whole 20-30 minutes trying to get that one detail and then find out that its not really nessessary
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:35:53 or it would not look good
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:36:33 so u go and wasted ur time for nothing and now u gotta get rid of that one thing you did without destroying the whole entire build cuz u missclick a delete on some other important block
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:36:57 man
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:37:00 i just did so too
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:37:47 man
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:37:50 im trying to make a mark 5
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:38:22 and in the middle of testing it some dude decided that it would be a good idea to spawn a 6k block ship in a public server
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:38:37 while another dude is having a mellenium falcon that is prolly alrady 2k+blocks
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:38:50 im surprise i managed to save
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:39:18 what kind of tutorial tho
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:40:01 yea
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:40:07 yea
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:40:30 that u just gotta do it urself like trial and error
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:40:37 just get the basics
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:40:43 thats how i did mine
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:41:36 depend on what u tryna do with it
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:42:11 some baic stuff are easy and all but if u tryna fit it in small space and what not its hard
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:42:36 yea
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:42:40 just keep doing it
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:42:52 ok show me ur build or something
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:43:12 yea but its not always the detail that need motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:43:32 fair enough
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:43:45 yea or sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:44:07 the builder like me decided to be a fucking idiot and use like a fucking mechanism from a motherfucking LEGO VIDEO
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:44:14 to make a SIX LEGGED FUCKING WALKER
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:44:27 AND I HAVE TO MAKE A FUCKING FRAME THAT FIT
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:44:36 AND STILL MAKE THE FUCKING THING WALK\
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:45:12 just do it man you dont need to pull off like the most crazy shit ever
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 19:45:19 what important is u enjoy what ur doing

plane-crazy 2021-03-26 01:16:06 people
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 01:53:14 Hans why did you cut the plane in half
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 11:43:00 Somehow
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 12:07:43 it will go up slowly and go out of control, i can speed that process up by attemping to turn
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 12:17:47 im pretty sure a lot of people make that
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 12:56:40 ejecting moment
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 12:57:11 i spent a whole 5 minutes trying to make the ejecting work
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 13:02:17 these are the wings lol look kinda funny when not connected
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 13:02:29 send a pic of the heli or something
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 14:56:33 👏 dude is having character development right there
plane-crazy 2021-03-27 19:43:32 man what a great time to join public
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 03:48:39 god dammit why did i decide that making the seat on the side like how the plane is in real life a better idea than just putting it in the middle and call it a day'
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 04:17:34 perfectly balanced

general 2021-03-30 01:02:05 engine moment
general 2021-03-30 01:02:15 that engine are consist of 5 pieces
general 2021-03-30 01:03:16 also today's progress
general 2021-03-30 01:04:41 lol
general 2021-03-30 01:04:58 man i made like several plastics models before but this one is hard
general 2021-03-30 01:05:14 the pieces are very small and i had to do surgery to the plane
general 2021-03-30 01:05:34 Gotha G.IV made by Roden
general 2021-03-30 01:06:14 and just in case i forgot how to read i looked up a guide and yes i gotta do surgery to the plane
general 2021-03-30 01:06:27 the brand is Roden
general 2021-03-30 01:06:34 its a Russian brand i think
general 2021-03-30 01:06:37 yea its Russian
general 2021-03-30 01:06:58 tho gotta say the details on this one is pretty good
general 2021-03-30 01:07:10 never had a Tamiya model so cant compare those tho
general 2021-03-30 01:08:26 yea they look cool but like Roden is the only one that make ww1 models that i can see
general 2021-03-30 01:08:34 o nice
general 2021-03-30 01:10:12 this engine in which it is consit of 5 parts, will get covered up mostly
general 2021-03-30 01:10:59 this is where it goes into
general 2021-03-30 01:12:43 you ever just have so bad wifi that a youtube video play on 144p
general 2021-03-30 01:15:57 lol
general 2021-03-30 01:16:11 nah dude the wifi bar is at 1 bar today
plane-crazy 2021-03-31 13:02:12 oppai

plane-crazy 2021-03-31 15:51:20 im kinda dreading continue by Gotha g4 bomber
plane-crazy 2021-03-31 15:51:36 remaking it to scale is tuff
plane-crazy 2021-03-31 15:51:50 ill prolly make it so there is no weapon or functional weapon
plane-crazy 2021-03-31 15:51:53 cuz the scale
plane-crazy 2021-03-31 15:53:30

plane-crazy 2021-04-02 06:58:41 except for the fact that u gotta re do the sparkler every time cuz that shit just wont save the position
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 02:27:06 should i make a torii gate
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 02:32:27 wait did roblox get new water or something

plane-crazy 2021-04-06 22:56:18 it suspend

plane-crazy 2021-04-06 22:57:38 het thats pretty good
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 22:58:06 idk maybe hide it better
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 22:58:13 unless you want it showing
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 22:59:16 o
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 22:59:22 well thats a problem
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 22:59:28 decrease the damping
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 22:59:41 make it 20
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 22:59:45 if that dont work
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 22:59:50 add weight to the bottom
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 22:59:55 so the bottom stay down
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 22:59:59 like a gyroscope
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:00:22 either that or ad a block of helium on top
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:00:27 *add
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:01:09 just try adding a block of helium on top first
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:01:15 see if that work
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:02:52 if helium then on top of tank, if ballast then on bottom of tank so that the tank is not top heavy
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:03:26 or just make separate suspension on both side
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:04:09 m nut
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:04:54 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:08:26 just do it, idk man trial and error i guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:09:36 you could build a whole entire plane with the purpose of landing or something
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:09:47 idk just for a good looking video
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:10:14 well thats not that hard
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:10:21 you dont even need to make it to scale
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:10:30 just base of a real plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:10:36 and dont use mouse control
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:10:39 its ass
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:10:55 mouse control is good for nothing
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:11:37 either make it big or use motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:12:35 look in the wedge and half block category or just motorlock or both
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:13:34 look at this piece of shit walker that for some reason i decide to use a walking mechanism from a lego video to based it off on
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:13:39 it was a fucking nightmare to make
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:13:43 the mechanism is easy
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:13:47 but the fucking frame
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:13:53 i fucking hate myself for making it
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:14:19 make it faster and increase the amount of control surface, but you better hide it
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:14:43 how long control surface
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:14:59 decrease wing panel amount
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:15:12 it create drag
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:15:15 a lot of drag
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:15:33 or
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:15:38 just make custom control surface
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:15:45 those are always better anyway
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:17:14 motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:19:27 use motor 2, set to servo and set keybind for it
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:19:56 A to roll left D to roll right, S to pitch up W to pitch down, Q to yaw left E to yaw right
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:20:08 way better than mouse control
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:20:42 yea but glitched mosue is this annoying to use
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:20:47 u cant do first person with it
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:20:52 and not the in game camera first person
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:21:00 i mean the zoom in first person where u can look around with
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:22:09 someone help with this case I give up
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:22:53 trial and error figure it out my dood
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:23:05 imma go stare at a wall for 2 hours now bye
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:25:38 ok first of try not to make it metal
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:25:43 just the default material will do
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:46:28 add like some vertical wing
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:46:35 to balance the thing out or something
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:46:43 also for heavens sake hide the control surface
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:47:29 also why does it look like some kind of star destroyer
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:47:59 fair enough
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:49:37 motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:50:11 wait a bit
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:50:56 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyiPBQZOZF8

plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:52:39 like you dont need to do anything crazy
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:52:44 just use it to hide control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:52:50 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:53:00 ur not trying to pull off crazy shit
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:53:12 ur just hiding control surface into some very thick wings
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:54:24 bruh just
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:55:49 
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:56:12 just like that
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 23:56:49 ur just hiding seom stuff with it, not trying to make a frame and deal with angles
plane-crazy 2021-04-07 00:03:09 yea
plane-crazy 2021-04-07 00:03:11 just do it
plane-crazy 2021-04-07 00:03:23 once you did your first one its not so hard anymore

plane-crazy 2021-04-07 22:46:05 hide the motor or something ,if needed be use motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-04-07 22:46:34 motorlock is good for life
plane-crazy 2021-04-07 22:46:44 ok and yea hte color is bad

creations-chat 2021-04-09 01:33:45 pretty good
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:29:33 support beam thing for plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:30:46 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:31:10 ok now how the fuck do I put the wing on top
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:32:21 im trying to figur out how to motorlock it on
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:32:40 best way would be just to add another level of motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:32:50 thing is i gotta add more to the engine to or it wont fly
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:34:05 be more specific where i use it
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:34:17 ah now the thing is top heavy agaub
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:34:26 gonna add the landing gear in some times
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:35:32 nope wing gonna fucntion
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:35:39 plane have to be at right speed
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:36:13 weight distribution gonna be just fine
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:36:26 plane gotta be able to ply somewhat straight without adjustment needed
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:36:34 keyboard control is the only way to go
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:36:45 theres no way in hell im using mouse control
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:38:10 a dammit i might have to put hte landing gear on the top wing
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:38:28 there arent enough space to add it here
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:38:33 so the plane gonna have more weight
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:38:41 what you mean what
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:38:49 u put the landing gear on the top wing
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:38:53 the thing motorlock down
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:39:00 and the landing gear gonna be on the bottom
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:39:28 like this
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:39:46 
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:46:23 oh wow it flew
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:56:06 
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 20:18:27 the wing is done
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 20:22:06 thx
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 20:22:18 yes it is
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 20:22:19 gotha g4
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 20:22:24 now i gotta make the landing gear
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 20:22:28 and make it so the plane can go straight
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 20:22:55 i should
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 20:22:56 but not yet
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 20:22:59 that one is huge
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 20:52:26 ight now I gotta make the thing actually fly
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 20:52:37 cuz now it fly like shit and pitch up a lot
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 20:56:52 yes, gotha g4
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 20:57:36 its not a functional build
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 20:57:40 i just wanna make the thing to scale
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 20:58:29 holy shit its actually flying
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 20:59:46 yea im also making it to scale
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 20:59:53 thats why it have no bomb and guns
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 20:59:58 cuz to scale
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:00:31 well just making the pilot seat like this is hell
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:00:38 cuz the pilot seat is on the left on in the middle
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:00:57 how imma check the speed if its accurate
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:01:09 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:01:40 top speed is 15kmh slower than the actual plane but its good
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:01:48 dude i think u are mistaken
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:01:57 i used that before i rant about the top wing
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:02:06 its alwaus tjere
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:02:16 today for me
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:02:19 but that was unrelated
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:02:22 you say to use it to make the wing
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:02:27 i didnt use it to make the wing
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:02:37 just the radiator on top of the wing
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:02:43 wood and fabric yea
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:02:49 all ww1 planes are
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:03:19 thing is
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:03:22 its covered in fabric
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:03:37 and the most fabric looking material in game is the normal material
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:03:43 cuz its the smooth kind of fabric
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:04:11 <@!627576011927846952> yea thats what you say
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:04:29 and the top wing are made entirely out of wing
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:04:37 that disconnector is added via motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:05:11 its a biplane
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:05:14 its supposed to be slow
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:05:19 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:06:12 i am making a biplane that have a wingspan of 23.7 meter, that was made during ww1, out of wood and fabric except for engine and bomb and those stuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:06:25 how fast do you thing fabric covered wood frame can go
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:06:44 its a biplane dude its supposed to be slow
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:06:59 and the engine in ww1 is shit
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:07:40 the top speed of any plane in ww1 is like 200 something kmh
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:07:56 if the ww1 biplane was made out of metal it wont even move
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:08:06 cool
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:09:39 405 blocks thats less than i expect the thing to be
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:09:43 but the less the better
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:10:01 less block = less lag
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:10:36 mine go at 120 for max speed
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:10:51 i could add more engine but not today because right now the plane fly perfectly
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:11:00 drive?
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:13:16 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:14:04 yea looks like it
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 21:14:44 pain
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 23:30:27 I colored it
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 23:31:03 winter give u firework, sparkler, ski and snow blower
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 23:31:15 summer give u plotoon and water gun
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 23:31:42 yea see u in several months
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:49:54 I feel the same thing making this
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:50:11 i messed up the proportion before so i have to remake half the thing
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:51:08 Yagoo
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:53:26 
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:54:00 basically u set motor to turn off power and lock on, the thing will go back .6 block, u can use that to compress blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:55:26 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyiPBQZOZF8
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:57:28 work fine for the basics
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:57:45 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:47:31 dude the turret dont even look like a tiger 1 turret
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:52:25 i mean you could start by looking at actual tiger turret
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:52:44 the hull is pretty good all thing considered
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:52:54 track too big but if u want track its good
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:53:08 yea
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:53:31 make the front flat and make the turret at least like 1 block wider in total
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:53:36 
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:53:50 i would take a pic of my tiger model but im too lazy so heres a pic from the internet
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:54:07 sparklers are a pain tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:54:10 they never save the position
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:54:17 so u gotta redo it every time
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:54:21 but the size is better
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:54:25 but the stupid base thing
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:54:27 aaaaaaaaaa
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:55:29 ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 05:55:57 make it bigger

plane-crazy 2021-04-17 19:57:43 already regret the decision, should have start with the head instead of neck
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 19:57:49 i made the god damn thing too big

plane-crazy 2021-04-17 22:10:57 using half wedge down i gonna use some motorlocking to get it in, might try that later
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 22:11:08 making it bigger would be problem cuz the size of the thing
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 22:11:17 i wanna make the full thing and im trying to make it fit
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 22:11:22 and theres the tail too
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 22:12:20 ight ill try that in a bit
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 22:12:30 that ill do
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 22:12:37 should i make the tail moveable tho

plane-crazy 2021-04-18 05:41:12 oof 40 block tall
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 05:41:22 ok that might work some motorlocking will save it
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 05:41:34 wait nvm the leg is not that tall im good
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 06:12:52 ok does this look anything like godzilla so far

plane-crazy 2021-04-18 06:13:36 i put some stuff there to stop it from locking earlier
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 06:14:15 yes

plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:04:21 oh well that sucks
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:04:23 no offense
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:04:32 try making the wing split like that
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:04:46 a bit of mind torturing and a day or regret and you'll get it done
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:06:24 oh wow you didnt suffer like I wanted
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:06:31 then why did I spent a whole day suffering on it
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:06:41 I wanna die
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:06:51 I want to delete that yea old a10
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:07:02 that for some reason i dewcided to make it run with 40 keybinds back then
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:07:12 now its only 16 or something i think
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:08:21 wut a ss
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:08:43 oh dont have any right now imma look at creations
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:08:49 also its prety shitty just so you know
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:09:27 this old pic
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:09:44 ik, very shit
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:10:19 i removed like all weapon except the gun and add recoil to it and thats basically the end of the a10
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:10:34 like after that i dont even touch it anymore
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:10:40 i think i updated the hud once but thats about it
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:10:52 it lags like hell
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:11:15 i mena it doesnt lag as much as a 1k+ block build but still
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:11:29 motors and motorlocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:11:41 at least 10 motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:11:57 3 motor for the landing gear
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:12:03 motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:12:11 that lag
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:12:31 like 13 or 14 of them
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:13:00 and i made the gun spin cuz i can
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:13:15 but the gun have to be apart so i made it so it cant spin but are closer together with motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 23:43:17 that is why you dont have a bridge a building tall and
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 23:43:32 and 1 single bridge
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 23:43:53 venator got it right

plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:25:42 Oh it's colored blue so I can see better
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:25:56 Cuz it's really hard to see in all white
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:29:39 Elaborate?
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:30:20 Like thick winged or camo or what
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:31:16 Ah
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:31:23 I know what you mean
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:32:12 That's not really my expertise done most of the motorlock I do are just to put stuff together
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:34:14 
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:34:18 This is last plane I made
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:34:35 I use motorlock to put the support bar and top wing in
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:35:13 Im not o laptop rn so gimme a few more minute imma try to find a build pic
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:35:38 I hide them in the body of the plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:37:47 <@637206552381751326> this is all the img I can find
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:37:51 That's when it's in finished
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:37:56 So top wing is not there
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:38:42 What I did is just towering up
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:38:47 It's just that
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:38:58 Like just tower up to add details in
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:39:15 And torturing my brain too
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:39:21 It we don't talk about that
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:40:49 The fact that camera reset on reload is annoying
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:41:31 I don't use swapping camera mode so it's not a prop for me
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:41:58 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:42:07 Oh ok fair enough
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:42:27 I just zoom in with scrolling for first person lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:43:04 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:43:20 
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:43:34 Oh no no no
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:43:47 If cam got remove a bunch of builds would be gone
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:43:51 Big builds too
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:44:17 Folding, floating stuff, hotbox stuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:44:57 U can use camera to aim and bomb on bigger bombers
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:45:37 Yea
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:46:03 It's literally an invisible block
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:46:16 Heli is a vtol
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:46:27 Vtol stand for vertical take off and landing
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:46:51 I'm talking camera in general
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:47:03 Lol

plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:03:53 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:04:03 ill go back to that later but now to adress the most important problem
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:04:09 how tf do i make this foot
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:04:19 
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:04:38 3 block wide if possible
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:04:40 or maybe 4
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:05:09 the current leg look something like this
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:09:46 
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:11:53 thx
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:12:01 also got any idea about the foot
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:13:57 it kidna look like that
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:14:16 but like it cant be too big so wing panels would be too big for claw
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:14:34 got this for the 2 outer claw now the inner one
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:15:30 gotta fit 3 block wide tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:15:46 liek the base of the feet
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:15:52 the claw can go out a block or something
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:17:58 maybe
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:18:00 but how fit
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:19:01 yea
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:20:47 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:20:50 3 claws
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:20:54 3 block wide base
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:25:36 4 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:25:38 4 claws
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:25:41 3 block wide base
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:30:57 well this look shit
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:32:29 no it gotta touch first
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 21:56:07 I guess this is good enough
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 22:04:36 tbh i might just make it so the leg is jsut one piece instead of 2
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 22:04:45 itll walk like shit prolly
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 22:04:57 but frankly i dont see any other option to make it walk good
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 22:05:05 ncie turret
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 22:22:29 this dude
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 22:24:31 man we really need this but faced the other way
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 00:00:18 ok is it possible to get this thing to walk when there is no knee or foot joint
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 00:00:21 like stick man leg
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 00:00:29 cuz i havent figure out a way to fit the foot in yet

plane-crazy 2021-04-20 01:35:54 should i walk to see if it move as fast
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 01:37:26 ok after a bit of walking i think it should stay the same for now cuz human walking is more than just 3 joints
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 01:38:50 I jsut go outside my room and walk back and fourth dude

plane-crazy 2021-04-26 23:51:12 tail too heavy, give up lifting tail
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 23:52:42 twice as tall as body
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 23:52:58 smooth tail is no more
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 23:53:04 return to neca shin godzilla tail
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 23:53:24 
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 00:05:46 no
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 00:09:06 what u mean, show screenshot
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 00:24:24 ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 00:44:39 once i finish painting the shin godzilla maybe ill make a copy to make the frozen version
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 00:45:07 and make the tail as humanly detailed as I possibly can
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 00:45:13 that or I jsut make the tip of the tail as 1 build
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 00:54:22 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 00:54:50 each of those humanoid thing is prolly 2-3 times as big as a human
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 00:54:51 or more
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 00:54:57 considering the size of shin gojira
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 01:16:34 its gonna be a pain to make but ill try
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 01:16:43 prolly just the tail tip alone in a big scale
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 01:18:01 yea
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 01:18:04 what scale should i do
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 01:18:06 1:1
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 01:18:14 cuz that would be like
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 01:18:22 its just the tail tip
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 01:18:31 actually u right
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 01:18:34 that would be too big
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 01:18:39 the tail tip contain a whale skeleton
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 01:19:02 that would be impposible since the whole whale skeleton is like half the tail tip or something
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 01:19:15 no way id build something twice as big as a whale skeleton
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 01:19:29 i know its a small whale and all but hell nah
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 01:22:53 i do that just about everyday

plane-crazy 2021-04-27 23:51:12 trust me i would if I could
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 23:51:21 the head design cant do that
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 23:51:42 if i could i would use light as the purple versio and make the head move mouith split

plane-crazy 2021-04-29 12:42:43 The only unit of time shorter than a zeptosecond is a yoctosecond, and Planck time

plane-crazy 2021-05-07 13:45:16 lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:07:40 should i like build a town or something
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:08:13 no like a replicate of one either irl or in a game
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:08:19 im thinking kamurocho from yakuza
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:08:45 thing is what scale
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:09:08 cuz this is the map
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:10:50 yea ill prolly make it small scale
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:11:00 if im done with that and it turn out well maybe ill make sontenbori too
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:11:04 but important question is
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:11:19 do i do kamurocho from yakuza 0, 1 or 2
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:12:10 biggest different is the north part of yakuza 0 is just a park, and in the middle of the town is a small urban kind of place
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:12:34 in 1, the north park is still a park but like more concealed and only a small entrance and in middle of a town is a big tower
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:12:46 in 2 the north part is a building under construction
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:13:39 im currently playing yakuza kiwami 2 so since i have the game 2 would be somewhat easy cuz i can just walk around town
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:15:15 prolly only build a small part of town
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:15:22 or make the whole thing but in really small scale
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:15:29 like fit the whole thing into a plot

plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:53:08 gimme a sec
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:53:18 o so u want it to face down
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:53:26 well just motorlock it in dummy
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:54:27 
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:54:38 u take a motor, u turn off power and turn on lock
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:55:01 simple
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:55:48 that is half wedge
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:55:55 the red thing are half wedge
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:56:09 
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:56:36 half wedge

plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:57:29 <@!294623306601201665>
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:57:46 this
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:57:52 the motor is right there
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:57:53 u do that
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:58:23 if u lock a motor and have power on it cannot move unless u use hte keybind to make it move
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:58:28 if power is off there is no way to move it
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 23:58:40 and since locked motor spawn in it retract by half a block
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 00:00:02 so for example i have this
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 00:00:16 it bebome this when launch
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 00:00:36 make sure that
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 00:00:42 wait gimme a sec imma try to explain
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 00:02:25 so like the green and blue part cannt touch each other, the red part mean dont place stuff there
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 00:02:35 ik i suck at explaining

plane-crazy 2021-05-09 00:03:28 if u do it wont lock
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 00:03:58 if its at where the yellow is its fine

plane-crazy 2021-07-02 02:53:05 if they look good that is
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 02:54:30 most pvp focused build dont look that good
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 02:54:56 like in my opinion the cheese grater winged plane that the people who use it with glitched mouse control look terrible

plane-crazy 2021-07-27 09:54:41 scale
how articulated
how articulated: tail
how to design
color
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 09:54:49 yea that seem pretty reasonable

plane-crazy 2021-07-27 09:55:26 scatman
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:56:08 didn't watch the movie yet so i don't have much of an opinion on him yet

the-dump 2021-08-05 16:36:16 u could roll by doing some big brain manuver
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 08:27:48 facts
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:03:34 yea
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:03:47 seriously its been months since i play the game, lost all the motivation to build shit
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:03:52 all thats left is some ideas
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:04:00 nothing really to do
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:04:21 i somehow managed to finish the shin godzilla
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:04:24 that was months ago
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:04:41 thats boring for me
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:04:56 like in public you just get box cars and shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:05:07 no fun in that
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:05:33 like you get some brain activation when you kill some of these but like u gotta do the meta stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:05:41 like good plane with rockets and those shit
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:06:11 and i kinda refuse to do planes with cheese grater for wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:07:08 yea i got accused of copying his a10 by some comments
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:07:10 kinda funny
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:07:16 always tell them to go look closely
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:07:26 and most of them just come back and go oh sorry my bad
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:08:02 now that i think about it my old a10 is shit
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:08:30 to think its my pride in the game back then
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:08:40 not that my builds get any much better but still
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:10:19 wait is gamer thailand still a thing

plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:33:07 because
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:33:40 man i keep wanting to build a godzilla on plane crazy but always lose the motivation to do so
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:33:55 the first one i made took me a week
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:35:07 yea
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:35:19 like seriously motivation in plane crazy is something else
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:35:33 its been at least like what 4 months now
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:36:00 just wanna build this fucker
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:36:24 yea i love that anime
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:36:26 and the design
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:36:38 the tails man
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:37:06 shin goji and ultima goji are my favorite designs and a big part of why is the tail
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:37:41 but then everytime i wanna build it, i get reminded of how painful it is to build one
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:38:03 the shape is one thing, i gotta make an almost fully articulated tail
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:38:26 tho this one dont have to be as specific as shin goji, its not getting any easier cuz its a more natrual shape
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:38:31 pointy tail too
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:38:55 this one's tail is even longer which is great but a greater pain to make
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:39:06 honestly i dont know if ill ever even start on making it
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:40:10 got some nice ideas like separating the body and connecting them by joints like a figure and all but god damn its a pain to even think about starting the thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:43:04 i would say it is somewhat good if we travel back in time where plane crazy is very new
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:43:40 get in the robot
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:44:30 where arm
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:44:34 got bit off?

plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:24:03 what does it have to do with being good or bad this is not a fighting game
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:24:35 yea but theres also non pvp mode
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:24:39 not every build gotta be a pvp build
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:24:46 most of my builds arent
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:25:04 that is true
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:25:15 but thats why you try to get better
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:25:38 sometimes u just get bored of pvp shit u know

plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:29:35 just because you work ur ass of to make something and proud of it doesnt mean its automatically good
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:29:38 if its shit its still shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:29:42 but its shit ur proud of
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:29:55 thats all my build, shit im kinda proud of sometimes

plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:31:25 like sure it suck if something u work so hard on get a shti ton of downvote but at the end of the day if ur proud of it then ur proud of it

plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:18:18 when he reach 0 hp the fucker reverse time and heal himself
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:18:23 the head is also the torso
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:18:30 
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:18:58 tho he got wheels for feet
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:19:02 so instead of walking around
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:19:04 he be zoomin
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:19:51 the fucker fucking roller skate to you and beat your ass
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:19:56 no its honkai
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:19:59 same developer
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:20:02 or company thing
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:20:04 mihoyo make
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:20:26 yea
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:20:36 his gaming chair so good he litterally reverse time to avoid dying
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:20:46 and u gotta destory that shield thing before he heal too much
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:20:52 make it green
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:21:08 nah he doing bites the dust
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:21:14 reversing time not stopping it
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:21:44 
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:21:49 ok but how the fuck do I build that mech
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:22:01 yea
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:22:44 looks like for spring locking, isntead of using tnt u use spring so u can do it in public server
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:23:16 just search up honkai impact, it also have a pc version if you want pc
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:23:30 i reccomend pc version cuz ur phone will melt if you don't
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:23:39 free
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:23:56 the story do have a slow start but it get really good
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:24:39 how do I even begin to make a mech to begin with
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:24:50 like should I start with marking where the joints are and what not
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:25:45 well good luck\\
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:26:31 hope you like it
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:26:56 no sadly
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:27:01 i dont think theres a console version
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:27:15 if u play on pc u can plug in a controller to play yes but there isnt a console version
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:27:27 no its honkai not genshin, same company make it
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:31:34 whats the general thought process when making a mech in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:32:47 ok structure
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:33:16 ight i think ill start with the torso/head
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:34:13 its from honkai impact
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:34:20 hes one of the hardest boss imo
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:34:42 fucker is hard to kill, plus when his hp reach zero he reverse time to heal and u gotta destroy the shield before he heal too much
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:35:04 can you head pat a clock tho
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:35:16 nah dio only stop time this fucker reverse it to heal
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:35:28 mihoyo please send him to genshin, I want the genshin players to suffer
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:35:49 cuz it is

plane-crazy 2021-09-24 13:36:47 and he got wheels for foot so dont even need to fucking walk, he be zoomin

plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:46:10 can you help
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:46:55 something like this
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:48:19 the red line gotta be 6 blocks long
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:48:34 how do I make one like that
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:48:46 preferably half a block thick but if it gotta be then 1 block thick will do
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:48:55 theres no space to hide the motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:49:04 the mecha dont have a thicc body
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:49:14 the whole body is litterally a ring and an engine
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:52:32 sure
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:53:47 the red is how big the circle gotta be
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:53:55 6 blocks wide basically
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:54:01 maybe 7
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:55:32 this
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:56:00 like this kinda look like shit
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:56:12 liar
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:56:56 thats a fake nokia
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:57:30 this is the circle that i need to make, the bigger circle shouldnt be as hard
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:59:26 i would love motorlock but problem would be theres no space to hide it
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:59:40 unless you can hide it in a tube
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 14:59:48 wait lemme see how thick would the body be
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 15:00:35 5 block wide tube for a body basically
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 15:09:47 man turns out the circle is a bit too small
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 15:10:01 this mean later on im gonna have to do some folding
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 15:10:35 its a head
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 15:11:13 I know
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 15:11:25 if I could I would make it half a block thick
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 15:11:45 but i cant make it very circle-y like that
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 15:11:50 no where to hide it
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 15:12:29 this is the full thing, it dont have a chonky body where I can hide the motorlock in
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 15:12:34 only 1 engine looking thing
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 15:13:46 imma go eat and come back to continue later
the-dump 2021-09-24 16:01:28 
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 16:16:53 wow I actually somewhat finished the head
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 16:17:47 it look nothing like the source material
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 16:18:58 well its better than nothing so ill save now

plane-crazy 2021-09-24 16:33:38 honestly idk if I want to make it have a functioning neck or not
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 16:33:48 ill prolly keep it for now and if it doesnt work then no neck for you
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 16:37:53 its block at an angle
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 16:40:27 ok it now have a functioning neck, dunno if im gonna regret making this or not
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 16:48:40 fuck
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 16:48:49 ths thing is gotta have to be bigger than i planned
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 16:49:28 how the fuck am I gotta make a 40-50 block tall mech that use basically roller skate the foot
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 16:49:39 i mean at least i dont have to make it walk
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 16:49:44 but how the fuck am I gonna balance it
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 16:50:54 oh yea i forgot about that
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 16:51:31 lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 16:58:36 the front part is comming along, now i just gotta make that part go up and add the eyes on the torso
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 17:03:43 this
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 17:04:29 the head and neck so far
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 17:05:05 the leg and arm part is gonna be the biggest pain to make

general 2021-11-19 11:50:04 tank seem a bit too fast tho

plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:20:35 honkai actually have a combat system lmao
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:22:41 yea tbh i prefer small open world to big ones
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:23:07 rather a small open world packed with details and people
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:23:29 or if ur gonna doa big open world game either do a milsim kind of realism or make it so you can look at the world all day
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:25:34 tbh i prefer open district type games to open world type games
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:25:37 you know yakuza
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:25:51 the map is very small but it got a ton of people and shit to do
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:26:00 depend on the world i guess
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:26:04 dont want it to be too big either
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:26:09 but that too depend on what kind of game it is
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:30:41 imma post this pic here for reference
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:30:46 need a place to put it
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:53:24 is there a way to make this motor not do the motorlock until i press a button, tnt wont cut it cuz public server
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:53:58 that would make a mess
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:54:10 wait
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:54:10 disconnector wont do
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:54:13 unless i work around it
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:54:16 yea ill do that
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:54:46 yes but not in the way i wanted, so imma work around that
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 13:56:20 there you go
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 14:18:06 ok this look decent so far, just gotta make this shorter with motorlock and add in details to hide that gap
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 14:50:39 ok next is the big wing
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 14:50:48 *ring
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 14:51:03 gotta build a bigger ring
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 14:55:02 i might be thinking too far ahead but i need some opinion
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 14:55:55 which version should i make the one with 1 big sword or the one with 2 small sword
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 14:56:34 so far i got 1 vote on 1 big sword and 1 vote on 2 small sword
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 14:56:55 you got a point too, 2 small sword would be easier to control
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 14:57:23 one can kill you with 1 sword, the other can kill you with 2
plane-crazy 2021-12-17 14:58:00 its gonna be a while dude, i might give up half way through like i did 3 months ago

plane-crazy 2021-12-18 04:10:20 its college so i just take the time between class to do the work and what not
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 04:10:32 its winter break now and my sleep schedule have not get any better
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 04:11:40 i used to be able to sleep at 7, then it go to 9 and so on so fourth
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 04:11:49 at first i managed to wake up at 2pm
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 04:11:53 then it go to 3pm
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 04:11:59 recently it got as far as 5pm
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 04:12:25 welp that shouldnt matter anymore tho since its winter break now
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 04:12:38 got some times to fix the sleep schedule and im going to america for spring anyway
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 04:19:33 bruh I somehow left a block in here and now i gotta go look for where it is in build mode
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 04:20:21 how the fuck did you know and how did that happen
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 04:20:59 damn
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 04:23:00 well thats the body and head, time to make the arm i guess
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 04:36:23 wait how should I make a mech arm tho like just make it flailing around or something
plane-crazy 2021-12-18 04:36:42 all the stuff i built have no arm and the one that do the arm is so small that it doesnt matter
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 13:22:21 oh perfect i can go to training mode to get a good 360 view of this fucker
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 13:23:40 trying to make that
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 13:30:24 ok I think i got enough footage
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 13:38:11 https://streamable.com/xty07w
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 13:38:18 I think this is good enough footage
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 13:39:04 yea
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 13:39:22 and i gotta select the lowest difficulty for the training mode so he attack slow
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 13:39:54 yea except honkai actually have a combat system lmao
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 13:41:49 oh holy shit i made the side thing too small
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 13:42:22 aparently in genshin you have a lot of health and shield instead of dodging
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 13:42:37 cuz from gameplay i saw you would have over 10k health and a bunch of shield
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 13:42:46 no ultimate evasion or time slow stuff
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 13:43:20 oh so the whole shape was different, man i gotta remake that
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 13:43:52 yea
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 13:46:08 ok so the leg is basically like this
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 13:47:05 imma use this shot too cuz it help
general 2021-12-28 13:51:48 what the fuck roblox wheres the recently played shit
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 13:57:35 now how the fuck do I make it this shape
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 14:05:14 man longer wedges would be nice lmao
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 14:13:51 bruh turns out the outside circle was too big
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 14:23:44 better now
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 14:29:33 now how the fuck do i make hat cut up tube shape in a 2x2x2 space
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 14:31:03 yea thing is i gotta know where to motorlock it in
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 14:31:10 like where to hide hte motor and all that
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 14:32:40 I want to at least make this cylinder go where the back one is
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 14:32:45 like half a block in
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 14:33:08 but how
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 14:35:34 actually
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 14:35:55 I could use camera to make these 2 stick
plane-crazy 2021-12-28 14:38:20 it worked
general 2022-01-08 01:43:22 ebic
the-dump 2022-01-13 22:12:00 
general 2022-01-19 21:09:20 Look what I got lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 03:01:40 maybe i should build a heisei godzilla some days
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 03:01:52 its way better than monsterverse godzilla anyway
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 23:15:40 A
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 18:38:33 man its been several months
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 18:38:45 maybe its time to get back to plaen creizy in for a bit
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 18:39:07 *plaenean cureizie
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 18:39:39 https://tenor.com/view/watch-yo-tone-fnaf-fnaf-memes-gif-24043137
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 18:40:28 ah fuck
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 18:40:36 I gotta continue building this dude
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 18:41:45 when you built the head and body of a mech
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 18:41:49 what do you do next arm or leg
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 18:42:09 ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 18:42:37 also I gotta look at the fucker's ass
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:03:00 aye nice I got the shoulder done
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:06:08 man I should remake my godzilla someday
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:06:17 it should stand straight up instead of leaning forward
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:19:26 well tahts the shoulder joint
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:19:38 now where do I start with this giant fucking arm
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:27:59 fighting the fucker is a pain
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:28:18 it would have time related ability
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:28:22 cuz the thing is literally a clock
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:28:32 even its theme music have the clock sound on it
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:29:17 the ost name is literally kcolc
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:29:24 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io9_bWcXNdg
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:29:27 kcolc
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:29:45 dude show up out of nowhere bea the shit out of you
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:30:25 what you mean
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:31:35 fair enough
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:31:41 but what im most worried about os the motor
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:31:49 like what do I keybind it to
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:31:55 Ive never make a mech with arm before
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:32:15 yea
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:32:28 all the shit I make either have no arm or have t rex arm
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:33:44 it do have a 2 smaller sword version
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:34:13 yea that would be easier
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:34:22 but like the 1 sword would be more iconic bascially
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:34:33 plus that and the sword would be easier to make it so it look good
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:35:12 cuz I wanted to do the 1 sword version and thing gotta move fast
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:35:21 at least I dont have to worry about walking tho
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:35:29 cuz if you look carefully at the foot
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:35:33 thats not a foot thats wheels
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:36:17 seriously idk what to bind the arm to in term of motor
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:36:25 its not like a figure that you can adjust by hand
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:36:41 no swivel here
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:37:12 ill prolly do q e
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:37:16 those are empty for now
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:37:50 i think the left hand will just do nothing most the time
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:37:52 unless
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:37:58 I can make it move back when I move forward
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:38:06 
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:38:08 +like this
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:38:32 thats a problem for later
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:41:20 I think the arm is gonna be 3 blocks thick
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:44:03 yea this looks about right
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:50:36 damn now I need sideview pictures
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:51:42 o this is a good shot
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:52:06 welp thats all I need
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:55:27 wait where the hell would I even sit once I finish the mech
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:56:14 where to put the chair then
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:56:18 it gotta be hidden
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 19:57:29 i prolly gonna have to hide the chair in the crotch area
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 20:02:31 oh damn
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 20:02:49 the shape of the arm of this dude is the same shape as the arrow head from jojo
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 20:02:52 almost the same
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 20:03:55 how the fuck do I build this shape tho
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 20:04:18 fair enough
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 20:04:25 wait its only the top half that needed to be like that
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 20:04:43 o nice bottom half is empty so i can put the holding clock hand thing
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 20:28:23 how the fuck do I build this yellow shit and make it half a block thick
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 20:29:01 either that or a block thick idk
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 20:33:33 fuck I gotta look at how to do that
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 20:36:22 wait but dont you have to redo the camera angle every time you log in if you do camera lock
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 20:36:26 or do camera position save
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 20:37:20 oh then nvm that would be useless
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 20:38:00 and there are no space for angle lock
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 20:39:29 man I wish we have this but 2 blocks long
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 20:49:34 welp this look like shit but shit will do for now
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 21:01:55 
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 21:02:06 now to the fidget spinner looking part
plane-crazy 2022-01-28 21:38:29 man I should make a keybind board for each of my build
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:37:34 man
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:37:41 time to continue building this piece of shit
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:38:08 yea that suggestion is fucking dogshit what the fuck
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:38:23 
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:38:43 that motherfucking clock is a pain in the ass
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:38:58 so imma build the fucker and drive him off to the volcano
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:40:27 I mean to be fair I love the design too
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:42:26 oh yea and I have to somehow motorlock this fucking cross to its body
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:45:03 idk do it again
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:45:45 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:45:57 the fuck do that have to do with anything
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:46:30 how what
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:47:04 no
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:47:18 no
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:49:33 is it possible to like
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:49:52 to make the motor thats highlighted green still do the motorlock but still can rotate
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:50:13 fair enough
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:50:19 is there a way to put a rotation over there tho
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:50:55 cuz I want the rotation point to be here
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:51:25 rip
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:55:31 its already locked
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:55:40 and rotation right here it doesnt look right
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:56:01 cuz its not
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:56:06 yup
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:56:28 like the joint should be on top of the circle not on the bottom
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:56:54 it retract 1 block
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:57:29 all the motor here are locked
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:57:50 yea thats gonna be a problem tho
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:58:12 I need the circle position to be right here
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:58:18 wait unless
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:58:24 imma try something else
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:58:32 this prolly gonna expose even more motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 19:04:29 holy mother of exposed motorlock\
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 19:04:54 the exposed motorlock is ugly as fuck tho
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 19:07:26 this dude
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 19:19:55 nice
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 19:32:26 rip
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 19:32:43 wait how the fuck did you get rid of the text thing so fast, dont tell me ur motorlock is not messy as fuck
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 19:33:40 motherfucker ur motorlock is clean
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 19:35:49 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 19:37:49 what
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 19:38:37 the fuck
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 19:41:39 how the fuck am I supposed to build this
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 19:43:05 a shit I jsut realized something
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 19:43:21 I made the whole entire arm too small
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 19:43:34 the shoulder alone is supposed to be twice as big as the head
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 19:43:35 fuck
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 19:43:51 I made it the same size as the head instead
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 19:44:06 imma quit for now
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 04:40:55 got some new shot of husk nihilus
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 04:41:03 imma use this as reference for the build
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 04:41:04 but man
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 04:41:10 gotta remake the whole entier arm
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 04:41:13 this fuckign sucks
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 04:41:45 man the way its going I might as well just remake the whole entire thing
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 04:42:02 its in the first category i think
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 04:42:41 aaaa fucking hell I made the shoulder too small
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 04:43:10 at least now I can make it more accurate I guess
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 04:44:00 man if anything I wanna remake the whole thing but make it bigger
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 04:44:05 but will there be enough space
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:10:45 
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:10:54 its a clock
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:11:02 literally
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:11:07 even the theme music have clock sound in it
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:11:19 hell teh fucker reverse time to revive on death
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:28:43 bruh this is not even a pvp server
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:30:01 cuz its fun
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:30:22 just die and bring a shit ton of people down with you
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:30:27 what better way to go out than that
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:33:09 yea but thats not something you kamikaze with
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:33:41 like I get trying to build something that look good hell im trying myself
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:33:56 but sometimes you just wanna become a missile
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:34:05 no way
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:34:35 oh i already upvoted that lmao
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:35:01 yea thats the thing sometimes you just wanna go do that, but fuck shredder bugs tho
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:36:35 cuz like kamikaze is cool as fuck you literally die to kill a bunch of people
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:36:54 but just driving into the enemies ship while just sitting there doing nothing is fucking boring as fuck
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:38:26 not me
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:40:27 ight the scaling is much better now
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:41:00 a clock
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:41:20 wait how the fuck am I gonna motorlock that cross into the body
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:41:30 theres no fucking space
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:42:49 nah its quite literally a clock
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:43:06 anyway
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:43:31 the shoulder might still be 1 block too small but ill see if i wanna deal with that another day
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:44:23 a cross but yes
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:44:34 heres a close up
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:45:01 
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:45:15 theres not enough space to stick a cross in there
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:45:33 motorlock is a thing but I also gotta find a way to hide it
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:45:42 plus getting the angle right and everything
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:45:49 hell where am i gonna even put it
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:46:19 yea but hte thing is
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:46:24 the torso isnt big enough
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:46:41 also with the way its going the thing prolly wont be able to look up and down once I put the cross in
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:46:59 I already made it bigger than 1:1
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:47:07 any bigger idk if I can fit it
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:47:21 hell I want to make it even bigger
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:47:25 but i dont know how to make it fit
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:48:04 if anything I almost double the size
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:48:35 yea thing is my dude its been months since i play and I was never that good at motorlock to begin with
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:49:54 he is bigger in cutscenes so theres that but if I compare the scale to the boss in game the dude would be like 3:1 scale or something
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:50:43 dudes kinda huge in cutscenes
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:50:50 well most big enemies in the game are
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:51:52 yea but motorlocking is one thing the fucker also gotta move
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:51:58 how else am i supposed to make it commit die
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:52:11 fuckers a pain in the ass so im making him so I can drive him to lava
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:52:18 also did I mention dude got wheels for foot
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:52:35 its great that i dont have to make him walk yea
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:52:52 but I gotta now balance the fucker in a way that it can stand and roll without falling over
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:53:04 nah i wanna see the thing drown in lava
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:53:19 i think its my at-te walker
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:53:22 6 legged
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:53:25 gimme a sec
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:54:02 it can walk and everything, i got the walking mechanism from a lego video
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:54:24 yes thats literally what it is, well except the wheel can move so dude dont have to push himself
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:54:38 which one
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:54:46 ok lemme get some angles
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:55:06 
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:55:10 
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:55:14 
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:55:25 oh the build?
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:55:27 gimme a sec
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:55:47 a you know what
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:55:51 might as well get on the game
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:56:32 yea dude like holy shit I saw a fucking lego video and i use that walking mechanism to make the mech walk in the game
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:56:37 its a motherfucking pain
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:56:44 A GOD FUCKIGN DAMMIT
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:56:52 the amount of time I messed it up
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:57:02 gotta get the angle and position right so it actually work
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:57:10 and the fucker cant even walk backward
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:57:17 well it can for like 2 steps
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:57:33 why the fuck did I pick a walking mechanism from a lego video
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:57:39 the whole walking mechanism
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:57:45 only require 2 moving motors
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:57:49 the rest are unpowered
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 05:58:02 using propeller engine
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:00:00 here
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:00:14 
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:00:36 
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:00:37 there
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:00:42 from teh side, front and back
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:01:06 oh and from the top too
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:01:18 there you go
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:02:25 the big pillar thing behind is to change the center of gravity thing so I can actually see what im building
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:02:54 cuz like its hard to focus on the small parts when you have a yellow circle right where you wanna build
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:04:02 theres plenty of mech design in honkai
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:04:16 hell try this
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:04:28 I wanted to try that but for soem reason I picked husk nihilus instead
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:04:51 just search up honkai titan mech, theres an official model kit so you can see the thing from several differnt angles
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:05:51 or if you want more just look up honkai mechas on google
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:05:55 plenty of good design
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:06:11 the one I showed you just now is just like a basic mecha
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:06:17 the kind you can actually pilot
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:06:24 and isnt a fucking clock
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:06:55 thats what ive been thinking too
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:07:05 right now im thinking the crotch area
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:07:27 or maybe inside this, but if I do that I cant get out
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:07:43 at least with my godzilla build I can get out and in the chair
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:07:53 I usually like to get out and back into the pilot seat
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:10:43 that would be comedic yes
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:10:54 fr fr
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:11:10 yea but you can only bind motor to 2 keys
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:11:15 you cant do specific command
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:11:48 yea enough
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:11:56 but i recond thatd be even more of a pain lol
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:12:10 imagine you trip or something and the whole ass mech just have a seizure
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:14:30 wait who?
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:15:05 damn
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:15:07 rip
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:15:12 he is a legend
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:15:14 anway
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:15:31 that is a good idea, however, no vr headset
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:16:01 imagine husk nihilus walking tho lmao
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:17:54 imagine tho
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:18:03 imagine if motor can do more than just normally
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:18:26 like if you hold w or something it would do a specific movelike like rotate this way a certain degree and back a certain degree
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:18:44 mech builders would have a field day
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:19:45 yea
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:22:29 thats true
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:22:40 but like imagine the same thing bu with thrusters too
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:22:41 like
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:22:44 you can time everything
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:22:49 and make like a perfect loop
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:23:06 tho still manual movement would still be important
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:23:13 i guess it depend on which part we talking about
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:23:22 ok but dude imagine
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:23:34 fully transformable transformer in a push of a button
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:27:48 yea
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:31:24 I just realized the highest upvoted build I got have 96
plane-crazy 2022-02-05 06:31:45 anyway imma sleep bye
plane-crazy 2022-02-07 20:59:43 do it
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 08:09:26 good for him
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 08:09:34 he need to take a break from you
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 08:10:09 rip
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 08:10:35 no breaks for him then
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 08:10:52 man I should sleep its 2am
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 08:10:55 bye
general 2022-02-19 06:02:37 
general 2022-02-19 06:03:28 What
general 2022-02-19 06:03:31 O thats this one
general 2022-02-19 06:04:07 
general 2022-02-19 06:04:13 Thats this one
general 2022-02-19 06:04:40 Lol
general 2022-02-25 23:45:40 I did some panel lining
general 2022-02-25 23:46:16 no
general 2022-02-25 23:46:25 I bought it
general 2022-02-25 23:46:37 like 10usd
general 2022-02-25 23:54:08 idk nothing
general 2022-02-25 23:54:12 its not lego
general 2022-02-25 23:54:38 sure if you throw hard enough some pieces prolyl will break or pop off
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:01:06 should I remake this motherfucker
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:01:56 wut
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:02:55 or should I try to make this motherfucker instead
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:03:01 the tail is gonna be a pain tho cuz it gets smaller
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:03:46 cuz its a pain making them
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:04:20 yea most of them also look like shit
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:04:24 like low polly shit
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:04:29 not saying that mine is any better
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:04:39 just saying that most of them look like absolute shit
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:05:08 what you mean
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:06:28 ok but if im gonna make another godzilla in plane crazy i gotta ask myself the most important question
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:06:34 how will teh articulation be
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:06:40 especially the fucking tail
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:08:57 which one should I build
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:09:09 I feel like making one for some reason
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:09:18 ight
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:09:23 remaking shin it is
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:09:37 should prolly make him bigger than this lmao
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:10:08 and leg with actual joints and walking this time around instead of fucking sliding with ice
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:10:28 wait hol up
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:10:31 is it possible to like
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:10:40 use helium and stuff to simulate like zero gravity
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:10:51 what byou mean
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:11:17 wait what you mean hover engine, how would that work
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:11:30 yea i know that
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:11:33 but like how would I position it
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:11:43 like should there stuff blocking it
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:12:27 yea I plan to make the long ass tail basically weightless so I can move it around using propellor
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:13:01 ok thx
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:13:10 also since imma *try* to make the thing bigger
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:13:15 the tail is gotta be even more posable
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:13:23 last time I only did 15 or something moveable joitns
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:13:27 only 15
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:13:33 disgrace
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:13:49 gotta make at least 20 joints this time if I actualy have the motivation to finish the build
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:14:19 whats the point of building a godzilla if your not gonna give him a posable tail
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:15:02 seriously I never get why people would buy a godzilla figure with like little to no articulation
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:15:11 at that point just buy a statue kind of figure
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:16:01 like I get that the fully articulated ones are expensive but if ur gonna bbuy a figure with like 6 joints, might as well just buy a statue kind that have no joints and look infinitely better
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:19:38 ok that might actually worik
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:20:05 prolly gonna put helium and shit like that for every segment of the tail and use rope to connect the tail instead of motor
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:20:24 should I use rope tho
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:20:31 a whatever ill figure it out when I get ther
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:22:10 wait but like
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:22:19 with hover engien you can only go so high
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:23:14 ill prolly just use helium and use propeller to drag the tail around
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:23:24 in theory it should work
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:24:59 im still in the planning phase
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:25:18 like thinking of how everything should work
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:25:54 and thinking of how Im gonna do the articulation
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:26:06 ill prolly try to draw it out
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:28:36 idk something liek this
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:28:48 mostly focusing on the tail rn cuz thats one of hte most important part
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:29:54 
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:30:02 better example is with like an actual figure
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:30:21 but for each segment of the tail id put helium in it to make it basically 0 gravity
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:30:41 and put like propeller at the end or something to control the direction of the tail
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:32:02 and then theres the question of how many joints, and how posable
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:32:14 of course it would be as posable cuz built in game and not an actual figure
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:32:23 and how im gonna make the look and everything
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:32:56 cuz the last one I make look very shit
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:33:15 somehow it got 9k views on youtube tho
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:33:22 idk how the fuck
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:33:30 lobster is op
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:33:36 oh yea pc2 release
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:33:53 is the plot gonna get bigger in pc 2 anyway cuz thats gonna help a lot
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:33:58 what
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:34:23 nah i dont believe you
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:34:25 theres no way
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:34:29 nice
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:34:45 yea it should be bigger I dont wanna have to fold hte body thats gonna be a pain in the ass
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:35:51 ok where do I begin with building
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:35:57 prolly starting from the headf
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:35:59 head
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:36:18 heres hoping I actually folow through and finish the build
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:39:05 man the old head is fucking horrid how did I think this was passable
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:39:31 that look nothing like this
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:39:37 gotta make it bigger
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:40:01 didnt build yet im just looking at the old build first
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:40:16 this time im prolly gonna make it so it can open the mouth
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:40:33 question is how big should it be
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:40:42 old head is 3 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:40:57 yea but like
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:41:09 i dont think i can make it look right being that small
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:41:12 maybe 5 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:41:32 yea i know im terrible good for nothing piece of trash
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:41:49 but im a terrible good for nothing piece of trash with some resemblance of hope
bot-central 2022-03-04 02:42:25 !servers
bot-central 2022-03-04 02:42:29 -servers
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:43:39 prolly wont be able to make the mouth split open like it does in the movie sadly
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:44:22 fr
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:44:33 maybe but it gotta look good too
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:45:21 lol im not a god or a genius
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:45:39 also how the hell am I gonna do the teeth
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:45:45 prolly text but like
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:45:49 the fuck do I use
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:46:24 nah it gotta resemble something like this
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:47:26 i mean in the movie its the same but with less teeth
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:47:53 screenshot from teh movie
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:48:03 brighten up of course
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:49:00 i wont make the bottom of the mouth split
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:49:08 but I wanna make it open at least
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:49:21 and get the shape right this time
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 02:53:06 lean
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 03:00:44 shit I forgot I gotta add the eyes
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 03:00:57 motorlock is gonna be needed for the top of the head
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 03:02:02 nah I already got the eyes AI built this fucker before
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 03:03:10 ◦
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 03:03:14 I used ◦ for the eyes
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 03:03:53 most fitting  considering  this is how it looked like
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 03:04:17 I just gotta find a way to put it in
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 03:13:12 yea the shape dont look right
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 03:15:26 maybe I should go bigger
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 03:15:29 idk
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 03:18:52 imma risk it all and make it bigger
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 03:18:59 cool
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 03:19:07 keep it up with ur brother man
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 03:46:12 damn man best ft-17 build I've ever seen
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 03:46:33 nah obviously its the french Ft-17 from ww1
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 04:01:29 you
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 04:22:38 this doesnt really look it either
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 04:22:57 looks nothing alike really
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 04:23:31 I wanna give up
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 04:23:40 welp time to do bottom jaw
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 04:30:10 this doesnt look it either but ill jsut go with it why not
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 17:27:19 Yea ik, why do you think I complain
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 22:35:59 oof the shape isnt right
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 22:36:04 just looks like wing lmao
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 22:37:07 should I just make it go straight up
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 22:38:34 the red part
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 22:38:43 now I just gotta find a way to fit it in even taller
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 22:41:54 it doest get the same effect
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 22:43:26 the part is exposed when I open the mouth very wide
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 22:44:01 wait hol up
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 22:44:06 I forgot to close up the hole
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 22:51:55 this is the root of all my problems
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 22:55:08 these part touching prevent hte mouth from closing
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 22:55:25 can't, cuz  there will be a big gaping hole in the head
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 22:56:02 I gotta find a different way to add the mouth thing in
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:02:46 wing panel save the day
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:03:05 except not really I gotta fix the positon and shit
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:06:20 mouth can only open a tiny bit or the red part look off
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:06:22 sad
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:06:31 but at least it can close now
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:07:19 it can still open wider but mold breaking
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:07:44 I should write down the control so I dont forget in the future
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:11:37 welp time to move down to the neck
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:13:09 fuck

plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:13:28 why the fuck did I decide to make this one more poseable
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:13:42 im playing plane crazy not making an articulated figure
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:16:14 cant make the mouth split sadly
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:16:27 or can I
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:16:34 or should I suffer through making it split

plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:23:57 godzilla
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:24:51 build a fully articulated mecha
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:24:59 and when I say fully articulated I mean it
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:25:28 you ever build a gunpla or have figma or sh figurarts figure you know
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:25:33 then learn to make one
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:25:50 then dont build anything
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:26:26 ok nope im not gonna do the mouth split thing cuz i gotta have to redo the whole entire lower jaw for that
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:26:30 and fuck not im not doing that
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:28:36 ok where should I connect the neck to the head those are the 2 spots im thinking about
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:29:02 actually yea base of the head to the neck would make more sense
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:29:50 damn
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:49:48 nice
plane-crazy 2022-03-06 23:49:48

plane-crazy 2022-03-07 01:24:43 I base most of the articulation and stuff on the sh monsterarts figure, the pain is I dont own that figure or the shin godzilla figure
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 01:24:51 so I have to base most of the stuff off pictures and videos
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 01:26:20 did, too laggy plus pictures are more relyable
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 01:36:33 now how the fuck do I build this gill part thing
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 01:42:31 good idea balast tank
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 01:46:02 what the fuck this shit again
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 05:42:32 ok
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:04:52 holy shit, look at the amount of views this shitty ass build got

plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:33:58 dont want to be egotistical man
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:34:57 nothing wrong with that, but you cant just say ur build is perfect when its not
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:35:54 except for when my build look nothing like the source material
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:36:54 these 2 looks nothing alike
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:37:06 you would but everything is wrong
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:37:16 head shape, proportion, and especially the spine
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:37:28 the only thing im proud of in that build is the semi decent tail
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:38:54 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:41:48 once im finish with remaking the dude, imma be somewhat proud of it
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:42:00 then future me will continue to shit talk it
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:42:45 at least the mouth can open on this one
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:48:01 motor
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:48:07 add extra motor
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:49:01 where the base of the legs are
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:49:14 just some locked motor so you can maunally fix the position of hte leg
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:49:19 and make him not michael jackson
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:49:43 like add a pair to adjust the body not the legs
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 23:50:20 ok

plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:15:12 I dont want to redo the whole entire lower jaw

plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:45:07 no its not that
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:45:19 I just dont like teh build that I made
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:45:25 its like
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:45:36 look at this shit, I could have made that better
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:45:48 its literally my build
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:46:02 I was literally talking about my own build
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:46:35 cuz its something I made
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:46:41 its not something other people made
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:46:48 if I make it I gotta shit on it to get better at it
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:47:35 yea thats the thing
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:47:41 I just see it a bit differntly
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:47:49 like I hate my own shit so that I get motivation to get better
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:49:43 lol
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:50:10 cuz fr the only way I get motivated to build some shit is to shit on my own shit
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:50:30 cuz like if I dont hate my own shit im not gonna learn from it, thats how I see it anyway
plane-crazy 2022-03-09 00:51:50 like I can be proud of my own shit and hate it at the same time

plane-crazy 2022-03-10 00:04:34 a weapon of mass destruction can be a great monument
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 00:06:41 that does not mean the weapon could not be there
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 00:06:46 its jsut not used in a long time
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 00:06:58 if anything when the weapon is revealed it should look old and rusted, some of them broken even
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 04:27:03 fix the head and mouth
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 05:01:22 thx

general 2022-03-26 13:37:41 That’s the last shooting version you gotta pay extra
general 2022-03-26 13:37:48 Plus its harder to find

general 2022-03-27 06:36:22 
general 2022-03-27 23:15:22 
general 2022-03-27 23:19:05 ok
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 05:08:49 man I wanna build some new shit but I know im not gonna finish it like 2 of the things im building rn
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 05:12:10 a "mecha" and a godzilla, now I want to make a mobile suit
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 05:12:52 at least this fucker got no legs, unless I build the perfect Zeong
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 05:13:02 wait the fuck am I on about I got shit I didnt even finish
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 05:14:28 tbh I prefer it without the legs anyway
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 05:14:59 it just works man
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:41:49 with so like with mech builders that build mechs with arms and shit
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:41:55 the fuck do they do with the hands
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:42:07 do it usually have articulation or does it just be in one pose
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:42:27 that is a good solution however plane crazy cannot
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:43:13 if I set the key to a, then when I press a whether on my laptop keyboard or the keyboard I got, its still a
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:45:48 ok so from the videos I saw the hands got some basic movement, only several keybinds
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:46:04 if im going to make the mecha lets see
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:46:20 the head would prolly have 4-6 keybinds maybe 7
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:46:35 since the one I want to build have no legs but thrusters instead
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:46:44 gotta find out a way to balance it and still move the thing
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:47:07 do I want to add mechanical details like the RG kit or do I want to make it animation accurate and make the whole lower half skirt thing not move
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:47:20 hands and arms are prolly gonna have like lets see
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:47:40 prolly 8-10 keybinds per arm
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:48:07 8-10 keybidns that mean 16-20 keybinds for both arms
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:48:37 im not gonna articulate the fingers
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:48:44 16 keybinds for both arms fucking hell dude
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:49:32 the shit is prolly gonna have 30 something keybinds to control the whole thing
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:49:45 maybe but man im not a fan of that
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:49:49 or I could like
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:50:05 make the shoulder joint and the elbow joint of each arm have the same keybinds
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:50:13 that would save 4 keybinds in total
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:50:23 I dont care about pvp so
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:50:36 lol
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:51:17 ill try to draw it down
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:51:53 also theres the problem of how complex do I want the build to be
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:52:40 simple and animation accurate
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:52:48 or try to recreate the rg kit
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 05:53:57 also its not gonna be able to detach the arm like it does in teh anime and in the model kits cuz fuck that im not keybinding 18 more keybinds to both arm
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 06:01:25 oh oh oh or
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 06:01:39 I could just set the elbow joint to like not move at all only at an angle and thats it
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 06:01:47 that will save in total 4 keybinds
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 06:02:03 then still 12 keybinds left
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 06:02:36 man I dont wanna have to set both arms to the same keybinds
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 06:02:47 cuz if one got offset for some reason you cant fix that
plane-crazy 2022-03-30 06:02:51 and that shits annoying
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 03:08:45 Make an AT-TE where all 6 of the legs are connected to one or two motor, that one or two motor rotation is what control all 6 legs
plane-crazy 2022-03-31 03:09:07 Suffer the same way I did
general 2022-04-01 08:46:18 I just spent 5 hours drawing this on a game that doesnt have saving just because I thought id be fun
general 2022-04-01 08:46:20 fuck my life

plane-crazy 2022-06-20 15:13:53 you dont need more weapon if you can dodge all weapons
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 15:14:53 you dont need more weapons when people cant hit you, just have a singular rocket

general 2022-11-27 15:44:09 my dude the thigh parts look like it only spin forward and backward
general 2022-11-27 15:45:35 I just watched a review, from the looks of it the thigh can only go forward and back, not out and in
general 2022-11-27 15:46:10 articulation is way too limited
general 2022-11-27 15:47:01 sculpt looks great dont get me wrong
general 2022-11-27 15:47:06 lost me at the articulation tho
general 2022-11-27 15:47:17 also the ankle
general 2022-11-27 15:47:28 it doesnt look like the ankle move at all
general 2022-11-27 15:48:10 yea just saw, thank god thats there
general 2022-11-27 15:48:59 tho look at this man, the thighs
general 2022-11-27 15:49:01 it doesnt go out
general 2022-11-27 15:49:10 makes it look so stiff
general 2022-11-27 15:49:26 like a cheap action figure, even tho the sculpt looks great
general 2022-11-27 15:49:40 if im gonna buy that imma have to modify the hell out of it
general 2022-11-27 15:49:57 that doesnt means it cant look dynamic
general 2022-11-27 15:51:39 tho I will give them props for giving the big guy waist articulation, barely any dinosaur figures do that
general 2022-11-27 15:52:15 i don't care if it can't if im gonna own a t rex figure I'm gonna pose the hell out of it
general 2022-11-27 15:52:27 whats the point if I dont have at least a few cool looking pose
general 2022-11-27 15:53:02 id pic the later if the first can't pose
general 2022-11-27 15:53:16 hell id pick anything that can actually pose
general 2022-11-27 15:53:45 even if the possibility is limited there are some key parts
general 2022-11-27 15:54:02 like thigh swivel and spread, like it gotta at least do a bit
general 2022-11-27 15:54:18 dont have sd but I do have a couple of hg  and rg
general 2022-11-27 15:54:30 id get rg god gundam if I can afford it rn
general 2022-11-27 15:55:40 look at sh monsterarts, hell even neca godzilla figures have some swivel and spread at the thighs
general 2022-11-27 15:55:47 it dont even gotta be much
general 2022-11-27 15:55:57 just having a bit there makes the thing looks way more dynamic
general 2022-11-27 15:56:11 shrek is shrek
general 2022-11-27 15:57:00 exactly, like look how much more dynamic a figure can pose if it just have some of that
general 2022-11-27 15:57:25 with just forward and backward movement its gonna look like a cheap action figure doesnt matter how beautiful the sculpt is
general 2022-11-27 15:57:35 at that point you might as well just buy a statue figure
general 2022-11-27 15:59:54 I can feel that honestly, like when a figure is so good but if it could just have that little bit change itd be way more amazing
general 2022-11-27 16:00:04 hi
general 2022-11-27 16:00:12 I just build plamo now
general 2022-11-27 16:00:46 nah I dont feel like coming back to the game recently, maybe some day
general 2022-11-27 16:01:23 ill get back to the game then lmao

general 2022-12-05 09:25:21 yea tracing can help with knowing this and that but im way too lazy to trace man
general 2022-12-05 09:27:25 aaa man
general 2022-12-05 09:27:36 imma go workout for a bit
general 2022-12-05 09:27:38 then after that

general 2022-12-05 09:27:49 im not gonna stop till I get it right
general 2022-12-05 09:28:10 thats the trick I havent played this game in a year
general 2022-12-05 09:28:29 plus I dont workout to get muscles or anything
general 2022-12-05 09:28:42 I just want to kill any possibility of me getting fat no matter what
general 2022-12-05 09:29:31 tried that, doesnt work
general 2022-12-05 09:29:39 it just looks like random wavy lines
general 2022-12-05 09:29:54 can you send me an example
general 2022-12-05 09:30:06 cuz like I mostly draw short hair and what not
general 2022-12-05 09:30:39 doodles I did yesterday as example
general 2022-12-05 09:30:48 the kind of hair I draw the most is the one on the bottom left
general 2022-12-05 09:31:14 what

general 2022-12-05 09:31:54 yea ive always drawn neck slim
general 2022-12-05 09:32:59 but yea this is the only kind of hair I can consistently draw lol
general 2022-12-05 09:33:28 doesnt work
general 2022-12-05 09:33:34 it only work for a while
general 2022-12-05 09:33:49 when it gets into long territory it looks way off
general 2022-12-05 09:34:55 thats why you dont join a school thats focused on the thing you like
general 2022-12-05 09:35:26 no that dont really help, its better to know why things are the way they are instead of just how to do thing
general 2022-12-05 09:35:40 grow a mustache first
general 2022-12-05 09:36:00 its long overdue for a third world war
general 2022-12-05 09:38:07 its alright
general 2022-12-05 09:38:14 ill prolly cram overnight until I get the hair right
general 2022-12-05 09:38:31 https://tenor.com/view/bocchi-bocchi-the-rock-anime-mental-breakdown-cringe-gif-27026754

plane-crazy 2023-02-26 07:31:16 woah wacky motor
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 07:50:17 I remember there was a thing like you use an anchored block or something with the main pilot seat
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 07:50:32 and it can make you control the plane's roll using mouse control
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 07:50:35 is that still a thing
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 07:57:26 did some digging apparently its called glitch mouse control or something

plane-crazy 2023-05-17 16:30:39 yes
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 16:31:18 its like the first thing you see in the first gundam show
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 16:32:56 to drop a colony you would need
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 16:33:02 some mobile suits
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 16:33:05 gas
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 16:33:18 and some pilots
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 16:33:25 first you gas said colony
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 16:33:37 its best to bring several mobile suits in case someone fights back
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 16:33:54 then you take over it and drive it to destroy sydney, australia
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 16:41:06 Have fun lmao ur in for the long run
plane-crazy 2023-05-17 16:41:25 That is if you’re watching universal century
general 2023-05-23 06:34:21 they going over 100gb for a fucking fighting game
general 2023-05-23 06:34:33 what in fucks name
general 2023-05-23 06:35:22 at this point just give up on modern game lmao
general 2023-05-23 06:35:43 like its a fighting game
general 2023-05-23 06:35:54 if its a simulator or something then yea id understand
general 2023-05-23 06:36:01 but a fucking fighting game? really?
general 2023-05-23 06:37:25 yea and the optimization of the newer games are dog shit
general 2023-05-23 06:37:59 look at jedi survivor lmao, shits 150gb or something
general 2023-05-23 06:38:27 yea real
general 2023-05-23 06:38:56 and from what I heard, part of the reason why games are so heavy now is cuz all of the files for different languages or something
general 2023-05-23 06:39:05 like just make that downloadable if you want a specific language
general 2023-05-23 06:39:15 dlc exist
general 2023-05-23 06:39:22 yea ik its only part of it but like
general 2023-05-23 06:39:34 they could have soften the load a bit
general 2023-05-23 06:39:37 but they didnt
general 2023-05-23 06:40:07 155gb to be exact
general 2023-05-23 06:40:16 like sure the game looks nice and all
general 2023-05-23 06:40:26 but id rather play in ps2 graphics than have a game that  can barely run
general 2023-05-23 06:40:43 cuz ps2 games are legit amazing
general 2023-05-23 06:40:57 hell those fuckers can be better than ps3 and modern games
general 2023-05-23 06:41:11 yakuza 2
general 2023-05-23 06:43:01 like man
general 2023-05-23 06:43:03 games back then
general 2023-05-23 06:43:10 if you could turn on your computer you can play it
general 2023-05-23 06:43:23 and now you need like thousands of dollars of equipment to even run the thing
general 2023-05-23 06:43:40 hell them crappy graphcis can be charming in its own
general 2023-05-23 06:43:49 honestly yea
general 2023-05-23 06:44:08 like would still understand some games want their style to be realistic and all
general 2023-05-23 06:44:19 but if you do that at least make it beautiful
general 2023-05-23 06:44:24 and not so heavy
general 2023-05-23 06:44:46 liek ghost of tsushima is realistic and beautiful
general 2023-05-23 06:44:55 and the file size is like what
general 2023-05-23 06:45:00 39.4 GB for PlayStation 4, and 63.9 GB for PlayStation 5
general 2023-05-23 06:45:04 acording to google
general 2023-05-23 06:45:06 not that bad
general 2023-05-23 06:45:28 yea like if ur gonna do realistic at least stylize it someway thats appealing
general 2023-05-23 06:45:53 yea but it got the artstyle
general 2023-05-23 06:45:59 so it would still look good
general 2023-05-23 06:46:23 yea thing is those games arent that heavy right
general 2023-05-23 06:46:32 sure its on the heavier side, 50gb and all butb its not too bad
general 2023-05-23 06:47:16 hell I prefer games that do trickery to make shit looks realistic rather than actually make shit looks realistic
general 2023-05-23 06:49:27 yea
general 2023-05-23 06:49:31 trickery is the name of the game
general 2023-05-23 06:49:59 like how the spider man game have like fake windows on buildings
general 2023-05-23 06:50:28 like sure ray tracing looks cool and all but dude just put it in a dlc or something
general 2023-05-23 06:50:50 then fuck that lmao im diving back into the past
general 2023-05-23 06:50:55 either that or just indie games
general 2023-05-23 06:51:06 hell even the yakuza series are pushing their graphics up
general 2023-05-23 06:51:22 the early dragon engine games are like 40gb or something
general 2023-05-23 06:51:27 and not its like going up to 70
general 2023-05-23 06:51:34 I really hope it dont go further than that
general 2023-05-23 06:51:45 but considering they say that yakuza 8 is gonna be the biggest game yet
general 2023-05-23 06:51:48 Im worried
general 2023-05-23 06:52:51 we need more games like that honestly
general 2023-05-23 06:53:00 40gb is already pretty big
general 2023-05-23 06:53:16 60-70gb for a realistic style game is more than enough
general 2023-05-23 06:57:29 the sims latest installment
general 2023-05-23 06:58:12 the game is also playing in real time
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 09:59:41 Pvp is kinda boring anyway
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:00:07 True
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:00:15 Like the pvp meta is just
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:00:26 Being super fast and maneuverable
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:00:32 And shredder
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:00:37 Like those are lame as hell
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:01:27 I want fucking heads to heads nuts to butts mech with giant weapons going at each other iron blooded orphans style
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:01:42 It is
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:01:49 But then again its kinda eeeeh
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:02:00 Yea but jets are boring man
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:02:16 Like at least make something ww1 or fictional
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:02:22 Ww2 is overrated
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:02:28 Ww1 is where its at
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:02:46 Nah, ww1 is peak war
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:02:55 Exactly
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:03:04 Its constant suffering
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:03:13 It got tention
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:03:52 And ww2 they got like better tech so its lamer
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:04:09 Planes have some armor, bruh thats lame
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:04:24 Fair
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:04:40 But man ww1 dogfights man, those guys are like right next to each other
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:04:55 Like what 50 meters is like max shooting distant if you wanna actually hit
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:05:10 And your plane is literally a wooden frame with some cloth
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:05:21 If it rips youre a dead man
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:05:35 There are but its not exactly protective yknow
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:05:51 Depends
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:06:04 Cuz then again thing catches on fire easier prolly
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:07:07 True
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:07:33 Iirc at first pilot just salute each other or taking potshots with their pistol
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:08:17 Yea and planes can’t fly low to the ground cuz of how dangerous it is
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:08:29 Glorious
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:09:16 ?
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:09:34 I haven’t played this game for a whole ass year
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:09:49 And I’m not some very good builder either
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:10:00 Have you seen my track record its shit
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:10:11 And I have a bunch of unfinished builds
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:10:50 Like I had plans to remake my shin godzilla
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:10:57 I only made the head and neck
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:11:01 And thats it
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:11:18 I was making husk nihilus
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:11:25 And I realized the proportion was off
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:11:32 So I practically put off the project
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:11:55 I got to the shoulders yknow
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:12:02 The SHOULDERS
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:12:10 then I realized the head was too big
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:12:21 But the head is actually pretty small
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:12:31 So that means everything but the head is too small
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:12:41 Well except maybe the bottom part of the torso but eh
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:12:58 The head is already very small
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:13:56 Here
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:14:14 The whole ass shoulders and biceps are no longer there cuz I messed up the scale
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:14:37 Practically gave up
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:16:21 I did build one thing that I’m kinda proud of
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:16:27 A walking at te from star wars
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:16:35 The walking mechanism is powered by 2 motors
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:16:47 I based it on a design I saw someone did with lego
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:16:59 And I decided its a good idea to recreate that
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:17:03 Took me a whole week lmao
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:17:15 And it can’t walk backward
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:17:19 True
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:17:35 The mechanism just doesn’t work in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:17:41 Like it work going forward
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:17:46 But not backward
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:17:54 Its cuz the legs are at an angle
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:18:06 Like
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:18:23 With the lego you can just do the technique pieces and it work
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:18:32 I gotta use wedges in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:19:29 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/813227987977633832
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:19:34 Here you can see the legs
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:19:41 The video link doesn’t work anymore
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:19:51 But like you should get an idea of how it work
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:20:17 And I based it entirely
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:20:19 https://youtu.be/wTH3Y0FFVPc
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:20:22 On this video
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:20:27 ?
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:21:01 Im in college rn
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:21:06 And honestly no idea lmao
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:21:17 Kinda still in the first year and all
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:21:24 Just gotta see where this takes me
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:21:47 Cuz honestly as long as work isn’t too bad or physical I’m fine with anything
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:21:59 As long as I get paid enough to survive and buy model kits
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:22:17 Yea
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:22:30 Hell I don’t even need to eat much to survive lmao
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:22:37 A meal or two a day is good enough
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:22:51 Lol
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:23:05 Then you better eat lmao
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:23:17 Cuz physical stuff like that you need a lot of food
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:23:30 You’ll get used to it
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:23:56 True but you’re still gotta bulk up a bit
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:24:04 Yea that
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 10:24:16 Like I said, you’ll get used to it
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 03:39:52 Good luck with the build
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 03:40:07 And good on you for using the good burning godzilla design
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 20:26:19 Not much people build ms from gundam here
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 20:26:31 And when they do its always the gundam instead of a zeon suit
general 2023-07-19 16:41:20 theres still black on the outside thigh and silver on the inner thigh left to paint
general 2023-07-19 16:41:36 all using gundam markers
general 2023-07-19 16:41:52 hand painting is no joke
general 2023-07-19 16:42:02 respect to all the warhammer guys out there
general 2023-07-19 16:42:12 I dont even have a brush lol I just go in with markers
general 2023-07-19 16:43:43 And hes small so painting is a bit of a pain
general 2023-07-19 16:43:57 But then again it is easiser cuz no huge surfaces to mess up
general 2023-07-19 16:44:38 I don’t paint them either man but I spent 53 dollars for this guy so I’m gonna give it my all
general 2023-07-19 16:44:50 Oh btw just for the record thats only like 25% of the whole thing
general 2023-07-19 16:45:00 Gridman alone doesn’t cost 55
general 2023-07-19 16:46:01 Yea its a whole combiner
general 2023-07-19 16:46:41 Lol
general 2023-07-19 16:47:47 I prolly wont be doing much or at all any color correcting for the vehicles lol
general 2023-07-19 16:48:00 aside from maybe gold for the fist but i dont have gold rn only yellow
general 2023-07-19 16:48:14 oh yea and there are several prepainted parts in this kit
general 2023-07-19 16:49:49 I get the feeling
general 2023-07-19 16:51:24 hence why I only limit the painting to some specific color corrections
general 2023-07-19 16:51:29 but this is gridman, so I gotta go all out
