contest-chat 2022-08-19 15:46:24 so does it have to be a steampunk version of something from the 20th century, or could you add a little fantasy to a build

contest-chat 2022-08-19 19:38:10 tzar tank is already steampunk looking

Though some improvements might be to not make so much motor lock showing, and make the back flow better instead of just being a delta wing and a 1x1 wing <@848336285550772255>
