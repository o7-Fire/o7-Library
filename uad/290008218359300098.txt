general 2022-10-14 14:36:25 guys, u know what this game needs?
general 2022-10-14 14:36:28 oil
general 2022-10-14 14:36:47 yesyes but hear me out
general 2022-10-14 14:37:13 my 8 cylinder engine keeps halting, cus it hits the walls in an otherwise airtight room
general 2022-10-14 14:37:25 if i just gave it a bit of oil to make it go smooth
general 2022-10-14 14:37:53 i also tried experimenting with building a chain... well i cant build chains, because it wont flow smoothly! i need oil
general 2022-10-14 14:38:34 im a nerd because i talk about oil, mmm yes
general 2022-10-14 14:39:20 cool
general 2022-10-14 14:42:32 do you like crickets

general 2022-10-14 14:52:31 i felt something weird was in the air...
general 2022-10-14 14:52:33 then it hit me
general 2022-10-14 14:53:06 ping dev role
creations-chat 2022-10-14 15:54:42 well uh if i had a timing belt, i would
creations-chat 2022-10-14 15:56:54 can i just ask... why the hell is there a 2 minute cooldown on creations chat, but a 10 second on creations... shouldnt it be the opposite?
creations-chat 2022-10-14 15:58:56 yes, 2 minutes feel like way too much. i cant have a proper conversation about my stuff, and answer questions on the get go. its seems like way too much. its a chat afterall
general 2023-03-25 19:32:35 how does one make a worm gear
plane-crazy 2023-03-25 19:35:15 how do i make a worm gear
plane-crazy 2023-04-24 16:16:39 belt powered 4 cylinder inline (180 degrees) i will probably end up making the 2 middle pistons parallel
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:11:37 chain and gears
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:11:52 little slower
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:14:24 hmm u should be able to do that without props
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:14:41 i can hear the propellors
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:15:05 .......
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:15:09 how have u not heard of OBS
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:15:44 yeah well they all say that
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:16:25 reminds me of the embarrasing moments ur sitting at family dinner, and they ask the gamer in the family (me) what i play, and i quietly avoid roblox, even though i spend 95% of my time on pc, on roblox
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:17:34 "oh yeah i know what it is"
*googles what it is*

plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:23:09 chain hangs on at 50 speed, wow
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:23:21 it do be looking kinda funky but... hangs on
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:23:53 idk.. its a chain
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:23:56 on gears
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:24:42 1. cus i love doing experiments in this game, its basically the only thing i do
2. im trying to build an engine, and the fabric cylinders didnt work very well
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:25:32 ill show u how it looks with the fabric cylinders
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:27:14 this is powered by 1 motor (located in the tower ontop)
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:27:54 easier said than done
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:28:26 im sure some smart people could make it like 50% smaller, but meh
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:28:32 still not small enough ig
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:29:25 either way, my idea was also to add camvalves, which requires me to have an additional gear in there. it has to be 1:2 with the crankshaft though
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:30:06 what would power the wheels
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:30:29 i dont have a gearbox nor driveshaft
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:31:13 its not that easy lol
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:31:18 if it was, it would be done irl
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:33:35 heres one without gears or chains. these are powered seperately
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:33:41 but still in sync
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:34:05 plane crazy suspension be funky
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:34:59 i dont mean suspension like that
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:35:11 i mean the cam valve's suspension
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:38:41 solar system
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:39:19 calculating the accurate orbital periods was a bit of a pain in the butt, cus i had to work with pi
plane-crazy 2023-04-26 19:42:04 is that a lufthansa or SAS
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 05:41:43 1 full rotation in 1 sec (60 rpm) is pi*2

I made sure 1 earth year was 1 second
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 05:42:53 I had to find the orbital periods relative to earth, then multiply by pi*2
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 05:45:39 I couldnt find many reliable websites either, so i had to work with DAYS, not decimals of years
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 05:55:06 e.g. Venus' equation looked like this:
365/225*(pi√ó2)

dividing earth's orbital period (365) by venus' orbital (225) you get about 0.62 which is the fraction of an earth year (1)
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 06:14:37 But thats not it. Cus multiplying it now would make Venus slower, so you gotta reverse the numbers.

225/365√ó(pi√ó2)
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 06:20:40 Not too sure if thats how i did it. Im at school rn... But it was fun calculating it regardless
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 10:26:13 Didnt ask you to read it. I replied to someone

plane-crazy 2023-04-27 13:06:48 The amount of people making swassies is concerning
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 13:08:28 Ok the amount of people making swassies is not concerning, and totally normal behavior
general 2023-04-28 21:09:30 is there any way of reporting malicious builds?
general 2023-04-28 21:09:46 lovely
general 2023-04-28 21:09:53 so the game is anarchy now
general 2023-04-28 21:10:31 someone got creative and made a hitluh doing the hand gesture, with a big swassie flag
general 2023-04-28 21:11:00 if theres no way to report it anyways, i dont care
general 2023-04-28 21:11:37 so indeed the game is anarchy
