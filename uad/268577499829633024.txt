plane-crazy 2018-12-30 00:34:07 i think contact detonation would be too overpowered
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 00:34:16 what category are the explosives under?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 00:34:35 is there a whole new category?

plane-crazy 2018-12-30 00:50:45 i made a guided missile awhile ago, it ended up not working but i kept it anyway
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 00:50:56 now with this update i can actually have it work
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 02:32:11 oh

plane-crazy 2018-12-30 02:33:17 the name origionated from my schools bacon, where you can slap it ont he table at mac 4 and it wont break
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 02:34:00 anyway, i have some strategies to make designs stable, though of course it depends on the plane's design
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 02:35:08 btw do you guys like my supply drop?
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 02:35:45 its full of explosives lol
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 02:36:24 got somebody's attention
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 02:36:33 anyway ill tear it apart to show you if you want
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 02:38:10 i used disconnectors to make the outside, a thingy to fly it above people, and had t connected by a camera chain to prevent the other disconnected parts from falling
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 02:38:16 helium blocks carry the rest into the sky
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 02:38:54 on the inside is the pilot's seat, some helium blocks, and explosives
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 02:38:56 thats a supply drop

plane-crazy 2018-12-30 02:39:43 cameras dont weigh  anything but connect on every surface, including other cameras
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 02:40:02 badly worded but i think i got the point across
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 02:40:27 and they go invisible when you test, so it just looks like this
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 02:40:41 
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 02:41:19 btw a few nights ago i think i made the smallest possible plane

plane-crazy 2018-12-30 04:02:24 and ye explosives arent as devastating as you'd think
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 04:02:53 but making a hit in the right place can be pretty bad

plane-crazy 2018-12-30 22:47:18 like your computer will problably explode right when you hit the acceleration key
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 22:47:25 then your house will explode
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 22:47:32 then the planet
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 22:52:09 its not against the rules to swear

plane-crazy 2018-12-30 22:53:02 *the d word..*
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 22:53:06 :(
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 22:53:12 D:
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 22:53:16 im calling my mom
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 22:53:54 sup, i have a possible fix for your thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 22:54:13 <@!219175600609296394>
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 22:55:38 comere
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 22:55:51 ye
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 22:56:53 speed is determined by the settigns you put on the engine
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:25:11 <@!219175600609296394> found out how to weld
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:29:58 you just need weld and magnets only
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:30:01 still testing though
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:30:03 also jesus
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:30:07 its 4:30 here
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:30:10 PM
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:33:11 looks like to weld you just bring the magnets close to eachother and press any key that isnt linked to the magnets
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:33:48 both magnets need to be set to weld and magnets only
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:34:14 i wanna join
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:34:51 hm
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:35:01 no
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:35:27 figuring out how to break a weld
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:35:30 if its possible
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:38:54 like how backward and forward ar R and F
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:39:03 press any other key on your keyboard
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:39:06 /or space
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:39:11 at least from what ive seen so far
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:39:39 maybe you just hold it there and eventually it welds
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:43:03 actually i think you just hold the magnets together and they connect
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:46:20 i dont see why you wouldnt
plane-crazy 2018-12-30 23:46:43 and if you can it should be even more reliable than motors
plane-crazy 2018-12-31 00:14:32 oh no
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:21:08 which kind of terrain do you want it to handle?

plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:20:00 holy moly
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:39:05 you'd have to fold it somewhere else
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:39:08 maybe here?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:39:22 
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:39:35 or further down
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:14:33 are you in PVP?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:20:20 an explosive one
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:20:43 ^
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:29:34 making fast trains is hard >:(
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:32:51 make it more heavy on the bottom?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:32:57 helium on top?

plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:34:40 nice
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:35:25 oye
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:35:46 you could also make a platform on the bottom of it
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:35:51 but
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:35:55 dunno about that
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:36:29 how'd i level up so much?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:36:49 last i checked it was like lvl 3
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:37:25 is the top of it hollow?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:37:32 hollow it out
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:37:41 it will
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:37:51 it'll bring center of mass lower
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:38:27 that too
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:38:31 do the guns shoot btw?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:39:13 well a better question is, are you building it for pvp or just a showcase? <@!216371990959882241>
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:39:21 woah
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:39:25 nice carrier
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 04:02:16 Ssssshhhhhhhh

plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:49:04 whats good krusty krew
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:49:09 ganna be active for a bit
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:50:06 i took a break from plane crazy the past 2 days so i didnt feel like it'd be fitting for me to be active in the disc druing that time
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:52:38 what des x represent?
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:53:22 no
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:54:08 this is BaconFlapper/Furious, i dont have my old pfp to revert and i dunno what else to change my pfp to so
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:54:11 i just kept it
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 01:54:30 this pfp is also a bit more scuffed compared to orange's
help 2019-01-05 01:55:15 from what ive seen, its like
help 2019-01-05 01:55:28 if you bump into it, it will shake back and fourth
help 2019-01-05 01:55:43 if you have 0 dampening it will keep shaking / take a long time to stop
help 2019-01-05 01:56:15 go ahead and test it out to amke sure you know how it works too
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 02:01:01 the only reason i'd want ranks is for people to know that im qualified to help them, i really like helping people but, understandably, you may be skeptical of somebody that only has few to no ranks trying to help you
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 02:17:30 uhh
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 02:17:36 id take that to <#497142796961054721>

plane-crazy 2019-01-05 05:51:24 i recommend the mods and admins do this too, its a nice way t watch over chat and play the game at the same time
general 2019-01-05 05:51:48 
general 2019-01-05 05:52:05 you can set the overlay lock to whatever key you want
general 2019-01-05 05:52:08 i chose -
general 2019-01-05 05:52:34 it wrks
general 2019-01-05 05:52:36 works
general 2019-01-05 05:53:12 
general 2019-01-05 05:54:53 then this button is what key you want to use to chat
general 2019-01-05 05:55:37 for me - is to adjust where chat and such is (youll figure that part out) and * is to talk
general 2019-01-05 05:56:22 ye you need the app
general 2019-01-05 05:56:27 
general 2019-01-05 05:56:49 
general 2019-01-05 05:57:18 oh that little notification up there

general 2019-01-05 05:58:13 go to overlay, scroll down, and the settings are here
general 2019-01-05 05:58:53 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xvpcXvNwJs
general 2019-01-05 05:59:11 heres a video from discord about it too
general 2019-01-05 06:00:13 its a bit outdated but you should still be able to figure out how to make it work
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 06:02:47 i think having a toggle for it would be better
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 06:03:50 rest in pepsi
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 06:12:21 why is a jet engine heavier than a rocket engine>
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 06:16:24 guys i thought of a great idea
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 06:17:21 you'd have a ragdoll built of blocks and ropes, then drop it into a giant magnet cannon
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 06:17:51 thats pretty much it
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 06:17:57 :)
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 06:30:46 let the kiddo have fun

help 2019-01-05 19:24:51 dunno but i could show you how it works
help 2019-01-05 19:25:08 do you mean for welding?
help 2019-01-05 19:25:21 i feel like the best way to learn is to experimenting youself
help 2019-01-05 19:25:23 oh
help 2019-01-05 19:25:59 
help 2019-01-05 19:26:22 make sure uoi have magnets only and weld on
help 2019-01-05 19:27:29 ive goten it to be reliable by attaching it to a rope
help 2019-01-05 19:27:33 red on red
help 2019-01-05 19:28:56 after theyre close to eachother for long enough they'll weld
help 2019-01-05 19:29:28 but im sure you dont need to use the rope
help 2019-01-05 19:29:34 ye, just experiment and stuff
help 2019-01-05 19:32:42 oh i ment only welding
help 2019-01-05 19:32:49 if yure able to use motors use those
help 2019-01-05 19:33:33 hes an admin so me might not like that

help 2019-01-05 21:01:44 you cant unweld magnets
help 2019-01-05 21:03:03 dunno, but i think i like it that way, it forces you to make a design to take it apart
general 2019-01-06 01:02:32 i think innovation should invest $24M into adding smart-fridges to their cores, this would help prevent meltdowns and system failures
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 01:28:33 is it just me or did orange's pfp get deformed?
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 01:28:34 also hi
