plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:57:54 No, you cant avoid cutter spam
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:57:58 they still hit you
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:58:27 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:58:45 Bruh, cutter missiles arent that common

plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:05:02 > a lot of people play pvp <@!613433888773242922>  you just play passive mode since clearly your a roleplayer so you wouldn't know how toxic they really are.
<@!318291033626771457> What? I'm no roleplayer mate
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 10:05:16 Kind off, not all servers have annoying players in them
