general 2023-04-16 11:54:55 yoooo
general 2023-04-16 11:55:02 hello guys
general 2023-04-16 11:55:31 had to verify another acc of mine because parents set up a pin,bro i hate that
general 2023-04-16 11:55:44 or i forgot my own pin i forgor
general 2023-04-16 11:55:55 mine is worse
general 2023-04-16 11:56:06 my handwriting is literally enchantment table
general 2023-04-16 11:57:19 anyway
general 2023-04-16 11:57:24 im tryna make project thor
general 2023-04-16 11:57:33 an abandoned us military kinetic weapon
general 2023-04-16 11:57:39 a tungsten rod dropped from the orbit
general 2023-04-16 11:57:48 idk about the dropping mechanism though
general 2023-04-16 11:58:03 should i just make it a disconnector and a rocket engine?
general 2023-04-16 12:34:23 how do i view my roblox purchase list?
general 2023-04-17 10:08:28 average ODer
general 2023-04-27 12:46:52 what game
general 2023-04-27 12:47:05 and uhh i may have done something to counter shredders
general 2023-04-27 12:47:44 i call it the S.A.C
Shredder Annihilation Complex
a bunch of guided missiles and one with a camera
with cutters
general 2023-04-27 12:47:53 yes i just made a bunch of mini shredder nukes
general 2023-04-27 12:48:05 they explode and make a zone of cutters
general 2023-04-27 12:48:13 incase anyone comes for backup
general 2023-04-27 12:48:18 also annihilates shredder orbs
general 2023-04-27 12:48:32 no bro i cant even think of a ball rocket
general 2023-04-27 12:48:53 no
mini shredder nukes
general 2023-04-27 12:48:58 they explode releasing cutters
general 2023-04-27 12:49:01 in an area
general 2023-04-27 12:49:20 there is tnt underneath
general 2023-04-27 12:49:25 to release them into the air or water
general 2023-04-27 12:49:45 **mini shredder nukes**
general 2023-04-27 12:49:59 shredder nukes are explosives that make cutters fly around
general 2023-04-27 12:50:20 and shredders are machines with cutters in place
big difference
general 2023-04-27 12:51:03 and they are not annoying like shredders, they are easily taken out
only shredders cant counter it
general 2023-04-27 12:51:36 trust me i tested it on my friends tank and it did nothing, all other builds besides shredders are invulnerable
general 2023-04-27 12:52:03 ye mini shredder nukes,i detonate them near a shredder and the flying cutters cripple it
general 2023-04-27 12:52:30 and then they are forced to respawn
general 2023-04-27 12:52:46 a bit smaller and less cutters
general 2023-04-27 12:53:09 the S.A.C consists of 20 mini rockets that outmaneuver a shredder or shredder orb
general 2023-04-27 12:53:43 then that swarm of 20 rockets encircle it leaving no space to escape
and then they detonate crippling the shredder
general 2023-04-27 12:54:15 and bro putting a cam on one of these was a great idea, the view is fantastic
general 2023-04-27 12:54:49 but the S.A.C is pretty weak, it only damages shredders well
general 2023-04-27 12:55:04 any other piece of tech is literally immune to it
general 2023-04-27 12:55:21 i sent the whole swarm on my friend for a test
no damage
general 2023-04-27 12:55:27 ye there is tnt
general 2023-04-27 12:55:41 20 tnt blocks
20 rockets
4 cutters each
general 2023-04-27 12:55:55 thats what im sayin
it only hurts shredders enough
general 2023-04-27 12:56:19 nah it can pierce it
general 2023-04-27 12:56:33 can you show a pic
idk what that is
general 2023-04-27 12:56:54 ah yes they invincible
general 2023-04-27 12:57:22 what about your movement tho/
general 2023-04-27 12:57:34 your movement will be disabled from one swarm
general 2023-04-27 12:57:36 k
general 2023-04-27 12:58:07 lol
general 2023-04-27 12:58:17 so yeah your movement will be severely crippled tho
general 2023-04-27 12:58:38 what are you doing step plane
general 2023-04-27 12:59:15 Mother Of All Bombs
the strongest non nuclear conventional explosive
general 2023-04-27 13:00:04 veritasium says its MOAB
general 2023-04-27 13:00:13 i watched that kinetic weapon vid

general 2023-04-27 13:00:24 an abandoned kinetic weapon
general 2023-04-27 13:00:52 i tried making an orbital kinetic weapon
it failed
general 2023-04-27 13:01:25 i tried making project thor
an abandoned US military kinetic weapon project
general 2023-04-27 13:01:35 basically a sattelite full of tungsten rods
general 2023-04-27 13:06:58 ye
have you heard of project thor?
it was an abandoned US military kinetic weapon project
general 2023-04-27 13:07:20 a satellite packed with tungsten rods that could intercept a ICBM in 15 minutes from orbit
general 2023-04-27 13:10:22 k i will work on it this weekend
the-dump 2023-06-01 14:54:07 now you need a super powerful tnt
