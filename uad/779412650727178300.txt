The Tale of Ace {Debug Alt} (779412650727178300)
general 2020-12-06 01:30:58 Hey everyone, I'm a bit of a scientist, I found some odd things. I've broken anchor blocks with impact force, split motors in half, passed the death barrier alive and found out how to turn a creation into a two dimensional fractal pattern. How do I document this insanity? is there a channel where I can ramble with someone else who knows more about mechanics like these?
general 2020-12-06 01:32:40 I joined like 5 min ago, that's why I'm here is because I've been doing some weird crap
general 2020-12-06 01:34:14 Im not proclaiming its new, Im just looking for people who know about any of this so I can harness it better
general 2020-12-06 01:35:24 so just because you haven't done anything with it you assume I and others can't?
general 2020-12-06 01:37:26 Im not trying to build a plane with the null zone, those were examples, I was reaching out to someone who could help me get better with *any of these odd mechanics*
