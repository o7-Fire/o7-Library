plane-crazy 2022-05-15 09:11:30 anyone know how to reduce the insane wobbling on a single rotor heli?
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 09:52:17 Yea ik it's a pain to make one but I fixed the wobbling slightly by using some wing panels but it's really unstable on the pitch and sometimes yaw
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 12:08:41 anyone know how to stop a heli from yawing and rolling to one side?
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 12:08:57 where do i put the helium?
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 12:09:21 my heli is balanced the center of mass is perfectly in the middle
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 12:09:40 so i guess ill go witht he helium but idk where to put it
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 12:11:51 oh like that
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 12:12:15 ok ill try doing this
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 12:13:23 with the helium its really hard to pitch the heli
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 12:13:31 and i use pitch mainly to go forwards
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 12:14:58 alr
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 12:17:01 that just goes up and spins fast and it makes my heli wobble alot
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 12:17:54 not the endo skeletons lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-15 12:27:31 yea i found a way to fix it anyways thx for the help ðŸ™‚

general 2022-09-13 20:19:57 I mean the toxicity from some people In pvp mode can be considered violence lol
general 2022-09-14 20:20:54 I hope pc2 comes out today and that the leaked release date was the actual release date
general 2022-09-14 20:21:32 ?
plane-crazy 2022-09-15 06:32:21 Same amount of time for geometry dash 2.2 to come out lol
general 2022-09-15 14:52:21 I swear the leaked release date was fake or smth
general 2022-09-15 14:53:14 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 20:35:51 who else is annoyed about the fact that the leaked release of pc2 wasnt the actual release date
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 20:36:30 well at this rate it probably wont
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 20:36:45 the game was 70% coded in like december 2021

plane-crazy 2022-09-17 20:37:07 ye ik
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 20:37:30 fair enough
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 20:37:44 i mean its easier to add updates to pc2 since its not hard coded
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 20:37:57 true
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 20:38:21 i quit for a bit because it got too boring flying some massive airbus above a tiny map
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 20:39:00 true but what are the chances it will come out then?
plane-crazy 2022-09-17 20:39:13 yes
