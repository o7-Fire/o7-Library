plane-crazy 2022-06-03 17:49:10 Anyone know how I can prevent things on motors from "bouncing"?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 17:49:50 
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 17:50:03 Motor 2
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 17:50:09 I have an anchor block yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 17:50:50 Normal motor doesn't have specific angles which is what I need
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 17:51:14 I'll screen record one sec
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 17:52:34 
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 17:53:07 Yep motor 2
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 17:53:15 It's gonna be a spaceship
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 17:53:23 Ah, I will try some weight reduction
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 17:53:40 What is the lightest material other than glass?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 17:55:29 Ice helped a bit
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 17:55:42 Just gotta shave off as much as I can weight-wise now
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 17:55:57 I like to think of torque as "strength" if that helps
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 17:56:30 Already got 2 motors
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 17:57:50 Only issue with this design and adding a counter weight is: I have used literally all the space I can use already lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 17:58:59 Could try that
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 18:00:51 Ballast made it bounce more, weight reduction worked better
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:17:01 I have a ship controlled by hover engines over motors, but my engines stop working as I reach 20k speed, is that an intentional thing that is built into the game or is it a glitch?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:18:30 I also have jet engines and they work just fine even after all the hover thrusters stop
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:20:38 The thing is when I stop (anchor block) the hover thrusters still do not work after that
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:22:41 
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:24:41 No
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:25:04 I don't even need to use the anchor block for the issue to occur but I will try
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:26:55 One sec casually in hyperspace seeing if anchor fixed it
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:28:59 
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:29:19 There are other engines scattered around the ship that are motorlocked into the walls, basically smaller versions of that to control the ship
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:29:49 I can stop at any other speed and be fine but the 20-22k region immediately renders all hover thrusters useless
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:30:53 Instead of motors?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:31:03 Alright I will try it
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:31:11 Does it matter if both ends of the piston are touching a block?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:31:18 Alright
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:31:24 I'll give it a try rq
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:36:07 Moment of truth
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:38:38 Same issue occurs, and is a bit more glitchy lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:38:51 Same speed, 21k
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:39:50 I don't feel like that is the issue, I can go any speed below 21k and it is fine, but once I go over I cannot use the engines, even after slowing down
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:40:14 Which is why I feel like it could be a built in limitation
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:43:11 Gonna stop at 19k speed
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 22:44:16 Everything works fine after stopping with the anchor block, 21k is just the limit I guess
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 23:08:57 So it turns out I am just reaching the borders of roblox itself
