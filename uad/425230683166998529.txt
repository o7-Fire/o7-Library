general 2020-08-07 13:12:37 People’s reaction to durian is either “EW WHAT IS THAT GET IT AWAY FROM ME” or “oh this actually tastes so good”
general 2020-08-07 13:12:47 There’s no in the middle-

general 2020-08-07 13:15:02 Well if it’s closed then yes but once you open it up the smell just x2
general 2020-08-07 13:15:23 But it is a painful process to get to eat durian
general 2020-08-07 13:15:29 Cuz of the spikes

general 2020-08-07 13:15:57 It’s not just in Indonesia
general 2020-08-07 13:16:32 It’s banned from train stations and airports and stuff because of how it smells
general 2020-08-07 13:16:41 It can sometimes smell like gas leak
