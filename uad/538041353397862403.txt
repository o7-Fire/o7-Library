general 2020-04-14 18:25:31 How do people manage to build outside the area for building?
general 2020-04-14 18:26:22 Uh.
general 2020-04-14 18:27:51 I am confused, how do people make those massive builds without violating the building area?
general 2020-04-14 18:30:06 When you are building something which took loads of time but then the wifi fails and autosave only saved a bit of it.
general 2020-04-14 18:31:17 Yeah after that I just saved loads because I couldn't take the wifi's s##t.
