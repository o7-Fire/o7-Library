bot-central 2019-06-04 09:18:01 ?Suggestion
bot-central 2019-06-15 07:11:26 &suggest A weight that can be toggled. You set the weight and the key to toggle the block. It will allow subs to submerge and much more.

Different sized plots
[BUILDING]
Add a new setting to select differently sized plots. Normal, wide and tall allowing for the building of different vehicles. This will also, (thank god) get rid of folding boats, allowing for the creation of **normal** vehicles.
