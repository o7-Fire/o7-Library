The Tale of honse3560 (564979675634335762)
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 01:34:25 Honestly
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 01:34:34 Haven't made a Russian fighter jet in a while
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 01:34:43 Anyone got an idea for what I should try to make?
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 01:35:18 Only one I have left that I haven't accidentally deleted is my Mig-25
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 01:35:28 Ooooooo
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 01:35:31 Hmmmmm
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 01:35:45 I'll think about that one
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 01:35:55 Just those vertical stabilizers that will be a challenge
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 01:41:38 Nato would have single handedly given birth to way too many memes with that name
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 02:42:14 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 02:42:26 Spawning in half my motor lock vehicles
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 02:42:36 only for them to glitch the flying F out
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 02:42:42 and spawn me in the void
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 02:42:52 What a great night I must be having
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 02:44:06 It isn't just a shredder. It has to be an UNDE shredder
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:09:03 Take a missle, but put a bunch of cutters on the front, give it speed, remove any explosives except missles or guns
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:09:06 And there you go
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:09:17 Also they are generally annoying in PVP
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:09:36 Unless you outrun them or make them fly into the giant fans on the island
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:09:42 Which is satisfying
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:10:33 True
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:11:18 Shredders are the reason I build jets or flying vehicles that are capable of one of two things or both: Speed and sheer agaility
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:13:58 Bro using ice as a material and on-and-off engines and aerodynamic insatbility is literally so good for agile aircraft building
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:14:25 Most of my fighters except motor lock builds use most of those things
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:26:04 I just tried to land a boing 737 onto a friend's aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:26:11 Only thing carrying me in the end was the water
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:27:04 Make an M249 LMG or XM10 Auto Shotgun
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:27:32 Meanwhile I'll finish up a cruise missle I made
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:27:44 then probs hop off since this thing is still taking me forever to fix
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:27:57 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:28:46 Wait
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:28:49 I got a good idea
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:29:11 Have you made an MP7 or M4A1-S
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:29:12 ?
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:29:16 Make either of those
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:29:22 if you haven't
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:30:40 Do you got a Deagle (Desert Eagle)?
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:31:27 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:31:41 You're welcome
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:32:23 Make it centered
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:32:28 or 3 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:32:50 I'd say 7
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:58:52 Good morning
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:59:08 Currently building several gunships while giving people rides in my 737
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 19:36:09 You mean the gunship?
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 19:36:12 Or the cargo version
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 19:36:56 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 19:37:01 I can try to help out
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 19:37:16 Hmmmm
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 19:38:28 AC-130 was what i was referring to
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 19:38:56 <@783372848856301588> join the hangar
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 19:39:01 the vc

plane-crazy 2022-08-12 15:52:49 Looks like a good day to add a few more conveyor drives to my Darkstar
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 15:53:49 You sound like your day is going great
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 15:54:46 lmao
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 15:55:31 Imagine walking into an interview with someone who applied for a job and as they answered a question, you just tell them to shut up mid-sentence
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 15:57:23 "So, why did you choose to apply for thise role?"
"Well, I chose this because I-"
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 15:57:31 "GTFO MY LAWN KID!"
