creations-chat 2021-09-27 00:59:25 Since some people didn’t really like my jet I might need to see what the problem is

creations-chat 2021-09-27 01:08:56 The bottom is when it’s in build mode

Is this what you mean
creations-chat 2021-09-27 01:20:51 So I should maybe find a way to make it slimmer to reduce the overall fat of the jet (slimmer blocks) and find a color palette for it
Well back to the drawing board

This is for a machine gun mount
creations-chat 2021-09-29 01:30:29 Idk how 
Should I make it like a marksman (semi auto) turret and use pistons
Like per click it pushes the turret back
creations-chat 2021-09-29 01:32:34 Wait I think I know how I can make it simulate recoil
creations-chat 2021-09-29 01:51:18 So I managed to make it go back and 
forth
Problem is in first person it’s not noticeable https://streamable.com/whgo1b
creations-chat 2021-09-29 01:53:32 I’ll try
creations-chat 2021-09-29 02:26:58 Basic motor locking

creations-chat 2021-09-29 03:12:39 I know what you mean
creations-chat 2021-09-29 03:25:14 My turret has quite a lot of recoil 
I’m not sure if I should classify it as a heavy machine gun at this point
creations-chat 2021-09-29 03:31:17 https://streamable.com/b0g8qq https://streamable.com/kzjsu8
Do y’all see a difference in recoil
creations-chat 2021-09-29 03:33:53 Yeah I’m trying to find a way to reduce the recoil 
I’m thinking about turning down the speed of the motors
creations-chat 2021-09-29 03:41:14 Further back?
And which motors the top ones
creations-chat 2021-09-29 20:59:41 So I’m thinking about removing the upwards recoil gimmick since normally turrets don’t have upwards recoil
What do y’all think
creations-chat 2021-09-29 21:01:53 Alright then
Removing it it is
creations-chat 2021-09-30 00:00:36 Making a turret this time with reciprocating barrel
What do y’all think of these iron sights
creations-chat 2021-09-30 00:04:05 So you know those suspension slingshots?
I’m making the barrel reciprocate by using that but just making the barrel go back and forth
creations-chat 2021-09-30 00:25:34 It’s like the barrel of the M107

Any ideas for the design

help 2021-10-16 02:52:01 Can anybody think of a color palette for this
Having trouble on picking some colors
help 2021-10-16 03:18:28 Hm
Left kind of gives this robust vibe 
Right kind of gives a proud vibe
help 2021-10-16 03:42:49 Tbh I picked the left one
Problem is I might need a secondary color
help 2021-10-16 03:50:25 Im gonna see which of the three matches best with the two

creations-chat 2021-10-20 02:51:29 It’s the front iron sight
creations-chat 2021-10-20 02:54:19 
creations-chat 2021-10-20 03:05:31 The color part
That’s… the point
It’s supposed to be dark
creations-chat 2021-10-20 03:10:07 I’m kinda hesitating to post my thing in creations
creations-chat 2021-10-20 03:16:10 It wasn’t me who picked some of the colors

creations-chat 2021-10-21 02:54:50 That’s better
Painted the mispainted
<@!619312093962829849> how can I fix the rectangular
creations-chat 2021-10-21 03:03:52 That’s a good idea
The problem is is that the wedges could cause friction against the back treads and it could potentially detrack it
I could use ice but the edges could get jammed into the treads
That’s why it’s rectangular
creations-chat 2021-10-21 03:07:22 Speaking of which I might as well come up with a name based off of its rectangular shape
creations-chat 2021-10-21 03:09:28 Alrighty then

plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:42:59 Question
general 2021-10-29 03:43:18 Jawbreaker
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:43:30 Has anybody ever tried to make a transformer and submitted it to <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:43:43 Or any other multi purpose vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:43:53 That can transform
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:44:00 I see
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:44:13 All because of a burrito
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:44:34 It literally crippled the services
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:44:43 Yup
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:45:01 It shut down most of the servers of roblox
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:45:09 From what I’ve heard at least
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:45:44 Once the servers reactivate I’m continuing my transformer thing
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:45:51 But that’s gonna be like
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:45:54 2 days later or something
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:46:27 And speaking of trans🅱️ormers
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:46:32 Were there any that got hall of fame
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:47:17 Yeah

plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:47:28 Only a tiny percentage somehow are still able to play
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:47:50 But according to my brain it’s gonna take 2-3 days possibly to fix the issue
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:48:04 Calculations
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:48:18 3
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 03:48:25 It’s been 3 hours

help 2021-11-18 04:51:35 There’s a bit of bouncing when the long section comes down

Should I switch to the classic chicken legs or just abort this build

Not often you see someone put active spoiler mechanisms on here
Also Ford GTS?
creations-chat 2022-11-23 01:53:13 Hm yes
Also how tf did you manage to make the spoiler motor not get attached to the panel without motor locking 
Along with the signs staying in the same position even when the spoiler’s slanted
creations-chat 2022-11-23 01:56:45 Control panels made sense
Signs I’m guessing you just placed them away from the spoiler a few blocks away, then motor locked them in?
