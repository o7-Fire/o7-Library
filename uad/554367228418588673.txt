plane-crazy 2020-08-29 21:00:13 This game sucks now
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 21:00:24 Frickin shredders have ruined everything

plane-crazy 2020-08-29 21:00:45 Then how do i pvp?
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 21:01:03 I used to love pvp but now nobody builds their own stuff anymore
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 21:01:10 All YouTube blueprints
general 2020-10-12 03:40:48 The parachute is the best thing about this game

general 2020-11-24 19:27:03 and flying vehicles made purely of propellers and hoverpads
general 2020-11-24 19:27:09 i have *nothing* to do
general 2020-11-24 19:27:28 idk
general 2020-11-24 19:27:39 probably depends how toxic

general 2020-11-24 19:28:38 ok i guess ive stubbed my toe before
general 2020-11-24 19:28:51 when i shoot people i miss the hitbox because my wifi is garbage
general 2020-11-24 19:29:03 i think it is
general 2020-11-24 19:29:10 i can play phantom forces just fine
general 2020-11-24 19:29:14 it can be fixed
general 2020-11-24 19:29:16 it just wont be
general 2020-11-24 19:29:18 so i wont play
general 2020-11-24 19:29:34 i know
general 2020-11-24 19:29:46 i still dont like arsenal
general 2020-11-24 19:29:54 id take pf anyd ay
general 2020-11-24 19:30:06 its pretty high speed
general 2020-11-24 19:30:16 idk
general 2020-11-24 19:30:25 i just simply cant hit people
general 2020-11-24 19:30:42 i also dont like the no sprint as well as cant scope with every gun
general 2020-11-24 19:30:46 about 150 avg
general 2020-11-24 19:30:54 i can get to 90 if im by myself on the wifi
general 2020-11-24 19:31:15 when i click and see the crosshairs on them?
general 2020-11-24 19:31:26 its just not worth the effort for me
general 2020-11-24 19:31:32 i prefer pf anyway
general 2020-11-24 19:31:38 i think its nicer
general 2020-11-24 19:31:46 for sure
general 2020-11-24 19:31:54 the animations look goofy
general 2020-11-24 19:31:59 the thighs oml
general 2020-11-24 19:32:04 but its fun for me
general 2020-11-24 19:32:09 thats why people have opinions
general 2020-11-24 19:32:24 wym?
general 2020-11-24 19:32:27 depends on ur server
general 2020-11-24 19:32:48 smaller maps
general 2020-11-24 19:32:57 pf maps are huge compapred to arsenal
general 2020-11-24 19:33:07 idk i like long range snipes

general 2020-11-24 19:33:26 range
general 2020-11-24 19:33:50 feels like awesome to hit those perfect headshots from away
general 2020-11-24 19:33:53 wym?
general 2020-11-24 19:33:57 im pretty sure some do
general 2020-11-24 19:33:58 not all
general 2020-11-24 19:34:04 i like dropping bullets bette
general 2020-11-24 19:34:08 more realistic
general 2020-11-24 19:34:18 plus aiming for trajectory takes skill
general 2020-11-24 19:34:33 thats why the radar has meters and the scopes have numbers
general 2020-11-24 19:34:35 i think
general 2020-11-24 19:34:40 i havent played in 2 months tbh

general 2020-11-27 05:28:12 Doesn't that sound awesome
general 2020-11-27 05:28:37 But then they can't actually copilot
general 2020-11-27 05:28:43 They're just sitting there
general 2020-11-27 05:29:08 But its a challenge i would like to take on if it was possible

general 2020-11-27 05:32:54 Nodn
general 2020-11-28 03:44:09 I think anything tht can cause a block to move can be turned into an engine
general 2020-11-28 03:44:29 Mmm
general 2020-11-28 03:44:33 If u want it to be
general 2020-11-28 03:44:39 It may not be very efficient
general 2020-11-28 03:44:50 But yeah i guess if you're into that
general 2020-11-28 03:45:23 Hover engines, conveyor, magnetic
general 2020-11-28 03:45:29 Pistons
general 2020-11-28 03:45:38 All can be turned into engines
general 2020-11-28 03:46:24 Except wheels
general 2020-11-28 03:46:36 Can't make engines out of wheels
general 2020-11-28 03:46:45 Or *can you*

creations-chat 2022-01-18 02:48:52 <@!806785640015855637> i like the design looks very aerodynamic
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 02:49:49 can magnets affect other ppls vehicles
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 02:49:53 or just your own
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 02:50:19 dammit
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 02:56:09 how do you make something extend and retract quickly
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 02:56:14 like a frogs tongue
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 02:57:12 what parts do i use
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 02:57:25 i tried suspension and rocket engines

plane-crazy 2022-01-18 03:01:43 ok then
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 03:02:21 
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 03:02:35 i only need 2 springs now come to think
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 03:03:22 what is damping on suspension?
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 03:05:14 i like smoother
plane-crazy 2022-01-18 03:05:22 but i cant see either
plane-crazy 2022-04-11 01:59:40 what type of engine is this

plane-crazy 2022-06-27 09:58:15 seemed to fix it
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 09:58:16 thx
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:20:46 Help i have a motor spinning horizontally and a pilot seat completely unconnected that spins with the motor like its attached
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:22:02 Why is the unconnected pilots seat spinning with the motor
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:22:38 Anyone
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:23:14 I have cameras, but they arent connected to the chair by any means
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:23:54 When i put an anchored block under the chair it refuses to spin
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:24:24 I didnt configure them. I just put them there. Theyre on default settings
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:27:33 Hmm
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:28:16 Why did it default to mov. It was an mp4
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:31:22 Is anyone elses discord on pc down
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:31:35 I cant do shit i cant even log in

plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:32:32 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:33:17 What the heck i wonder if its my college wifi. Everything was fine till i got here
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:33:30 Ive even shut down
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:33:58 Mayne all i wanted to know was why my disconnected chair was messing with the motors
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:35:58 Wtf. Ive been temporarily IP blocked
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:36:06 Thats why nothing was working
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:38:00 Idk all i did was open my laptop but i can only assume. It gave me this msg
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:38:54 {"code": 0, "message": "You are being blocked from accessing our API temporarily due to exceeding our rate limits frequently. Please read our docs at https://discord. com/developers/docs/topics/rate-limits to prevent this moving forward."}
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:39:10 I havent used my laptop since yesterday
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:40:03 
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:40:07 anyways
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 13:40:25 i got this to work, so as for my original question. what the heck is this
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 16:27:38 How do i stop my motor with propellers attatched to it from moving to a position where the propellers are flat
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 05:59:29 why do the physics change randomly? i saved and reloaded my helicopter and now it doesent have enough lift to even fly when before it would hover just fast enough to rise.
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:02:38 did all that happen in my quick resave and reload? like in the span of 20 seconds it went from functional to unusable
