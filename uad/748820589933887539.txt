general 2020-11-21 09:10:00 anyone, know which is best walking mechanism for mech
general 2020-11-21 09:10:01 ?
general 2020-11-21 09:10:41 so
general 2020-11-21 09:11:17 you k which is the best for robot?
general 2020-11-21 09:11:56 i k some, but unsure which is the best for both stabilization and fast walking
general 2020-11-21 09:12:28 ;-; i am getting ignored...
general 2020-11-21 09:12:37 sad
general 2020-11-21 09:13:08 oh okay
general 2020-11-21 09:14:33 it's on the hall of fame i think
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:22:21 My saves are weird
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:22:36 the autosave shows that i had saved 3.2k build,
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:22:55 but it shows the another build i have which is 888blocks when i load it.
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:22:58 And also,
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:23:12 the 3.2k build i had is now very broken for somereason,
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:23:16 with a lot of missing blocks
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:23:50 and just by changing the material, the uncolored ladder is now suddenly white
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:24:05 even though i never painted white on it.
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:24:15 due to the missing blocks,
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:24:54 i need to fix all the parts of the 3.2k build that's broken, which is really hard to do, in order to make it functional again
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:25:17 oh in addition,
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:25:35 some of the blocks that weren't there are placed randomly too
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:25:54 and block counts are same as the original one that was functional, on the same save plot...
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:34:56 Please fix this
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:28:27 well
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:28:30 for the color,
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:28:40 the ladder default is grey
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:29:34 and except the ladder, color on any other parts than normal blocks or normal beams were the same
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:29:45 such as motors and ballast
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:30:06 and yes, the problem occurs when i change from
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:30:11 /to glass material too
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:39:08 but what i meant was
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:39:13 the color of ladder changes
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:39:20 to white instead of default
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:39:31 when i changed from glass to defauly
bug-reports 2020-12-01 03:32:12 well i guess so
bug-reports 2020-12-01 03:32:20 tbh, i don't really care about the color,
bug-reports 2020-12-01 03:32:35 but the other problem i described above
bug-reports 2020-12-01 03:32:48 From here
bug-reports 2020-12-01 05:32:23 ?-?
general 2021-01-09 14:06:44 anyone here know how to fix
general 2021-01-09 14:06:49 error 610?
general 2021-01-09 14:07:08 i searched up already,
general 2021-01-09 14:07:12 but all methods didn't work
general 2021-01-09 14:07:28 didn't try making new account method though
general 2021-01-09 14:07:38 and it says server can be down, which i am not sure about
general 2021-01-29 04:10:18 hello
general 2021-01-29 04:10:57 Does people upvote custom mechs?

general 2021-01-29 04:13:20 i guess leo improved a lot recently
general 2021-01-29 04:14:38 aiming for v or x
general 2021-01-29 04:15:04 x would be hard..
general 2021-01-29 04:15:42 2k is easy but upvote, i am not sure people will give

general 2021-02-05 08:11:55 Does anyone know
general 2021-02-05 08:12:06 how to fix the gravity for certain builds?
general 2021-02-05 08:12:17 My build defies gravity for some reason
general 2021-02-05 08:12:22 even on gravity 180
general 2021-02-05 08:12:26 none
general 2021-02-05 08:12:31 also not that many helium
general 2021-02-05 08:12:47 and there are more than 5k blocks
general 2021-02-05 08:12:48 for now
general 2021-02-05 08:13:00 also flip doesn't work
general 2021-02-05 08:13:01 i think so
general 2021-02-05 08:13:13 but due to this, i can't make it walk
general 2021-02-05 08:13:25 every time i spawn,
general 2021-02-05 08:13:30 it happens
general 2021-02-05 08:13:38 yeah it's my build
general 2021-02-05 08:13:46 yes
general 2021-02-05 08:14:12 how does physics lag occur exactly?
general 2021-02-05 08:14:26 like is it due to
general 2021-02-05 08:14:29 the device,
general 2021-02-05 08:14:33 or internet connection?
general 2021-02-05 08:15:12 I do have some numbers of motor locks on it
general 2021-02-05 08:15:45 well i hope there is a way
general 2021-02-05 08:16:07 other people i know of in other discord server doesn't have
general 2021-02-05 08:16:10 this problem though
general 2021-02-05 08:16:16 even at over 10k
general 2021-02-05 08:16:44 yes i was thinking it was hardware,
general 2021-02-05 08:16:49 but i can't afford new one right now
general 2021-02-05 08:16:52 sadly
general 2021-02-05 08:16:57 nice
general 2021-02-05 08:17:21 well i can't put in anyways
general 2021-02-05 08:17:29 for i am using literally macbook air lol
general 2021-02-05 08:17:34 even if i don't want to
general 2021-02-05 08:17:53 nah i wasn't going to buy anything anyways
general 2021-02-05 08:18:04 and i don't even have enough money to do so
general 2021-02-06 05:56:53 if the build that didn't crash me when i spawn suddenly crashes after error 610 is gone, what should i do?
general 2021-02-06 05:57:13 mech with motorlocks
general 2021-02-06 05:57:20 4 or more plots height
general 2021-02-06 05:57:40 i asked
general 2021-02-06 05:57:44 some
general 2021-02-06 05:57:48 but they don't know
general 2021-02-06 05:58:28 well
general 2021-02-06 05:58:43 the build worked well
general 2021-02-06 05:58:52 while i had error610
general 2021-02-06 05:58:58 and while i had it,]
general 2021-02-06 05:59:02 it made me really laggy
general 2021-02-06 05:59:06 but after error 610 is gone,
general 2021-02-06 05:59:21 lag is now gone but
general 2021-02-06 05:59:34 the high number blocks builds crashes me when i spawn
general 2021-02-06 06:00:19 and it's a frame yet
general 2021-02-06 06:00:24 over 5k blocks
general 2021-02-06 06:01:08 well i only have
general 2021-02-06 06:01:13 beams, wedges,
general 2021-02-06 06:01:18 blocks, motors,
general 2021-02-06 06:01:23 and thrusters, and helium yet
general 2021-02-06 06:01:39 i used all 1*1,
general 2021-02-06 06:01:46 and i am now using beams
general 2021-02-06 06:02:07 yeah?
general 2021-02-06 06:02:26 have nearly none
general 2021-02-06 06:02:30 but might add more later

plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:30:22 hm
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:30:34 i am aware that inventor ranks are now unavilable,
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:30:49 but i am curious what people who got inventor ranks made
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:30:54 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:31:03 the concept of making the first idea,
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:31:08 how do you determine if it's
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:31:10 first or not
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:31:25 oh for real?
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:31:29 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:31:42 i know one inventor,
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:31:50 but he usually builds mechs
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:31:52 shinx
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:32:04 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:32:08 or godzila
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:32:30 he usually makes
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:32:31 big one
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:32:37 idk if he makes small one
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:33:13 .?
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:33:44 that's true
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:34:00 maybe violent
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:34:33 my builds nearly all being frames ;-;
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:35:12 well
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:35:20 isn't that rope glitch?
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:35:26 maybe with suspensions?
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:35:34 i see
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:35:36 thought they
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:35:37 fixed it
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:35:41 recently
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:35:49 oh 20 days ago
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:35:58 if so then it might have been
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:36:01 before it got fixed
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:36:12 i think i saw it in the
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:36:15 development?
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:36:19 not exactly sure
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:37:52 i see

plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:47:47 ah
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:48:08 it's historical fact though
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:48:14 and i haven't discriminated
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:48:15 any
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:48:24 it just contained

plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:48:57 i didn't offend
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:49:10 it was rather used to state historical fact ;-;
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:49:37 i didn't
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:49:44 make any german builds
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:49:50 nor did i upload any builds of those sort
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:50:01 ya saw what i wrote voyager?
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:50:20 well it's a fact though
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:50:25 not like general misconception
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:50:42 well if you had done crime,
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:50:48 and you talk about what happened,
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:50:56 is it a wrong thing to say even if it's a fact?
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:51:05 as long as it doesn't go to
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:51:07 privat infos
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:51:26 yeah i know that,
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:51:49 but just felt annoyed even if i know they won't change i guess lol

plane-crazy 2021-04-27 05:59:43 nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 06:01:05 that looks
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 06:01:07 kinda scary
creations-chat 2021-12-06 05:58:11 it's so hard to make that curve
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:02:19 this is older pic so it has some exposed motors
help 2021-12-06 06:04:10 is it possible to make the nose more smooth than that
help 2021-12-06 06:04:28 yeah
help 2021-12-06 06:04:43 i was also working on something similar but it was quite tiring to make it more curved
help 2021-12-06 06:05:02 i see
help 2021-12-06 06:06:53 hm i guess it would take far more space if ya were to make it more curved then
help 2021-12-06 06:06:58 nice
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:09:58 how about angling the prop from inside oneblock at the end of the axle or how should i call it
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:12:02 hm? i am confused
help 2021-12-06 06:13:44 what should i do if the head attached to the body by motor 2 keeps disintegrating, causing the mech to suddenly fly with 1.6 bil speed, and at some point everything disappears and yet i don't die with constant speed
help 2021-12-06 06:13:46 fun
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:14:06 oh i see
well after trial and error, he/she will get it eventually ig
help 2021-12-06 06:15:30 i see
help 2021-12-06 06:15:35 hope it won't lag too much
help 2021-12-06 06:17:43 yeap
help 2021-12-06 06:18:23 this is what i got so far ig
help 2021-12-06 06:18:29 gotta redo the whole bottom part of the nose
help 2021-12-06 06:19:44 has the working landing gear, so hard to get space for now
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:22:23 hm how about first angling and changing the shape of the front wing, change the shape of the wing a bit by adjusting through motor lock by texts, make the canopy and nose smoother, remove mouse controlled wing panels by instead using another mechanism, and etc
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:24:31 yeap i do

btw can anyone help me in what i wrote at help text channel regarding the mech's head
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:27:22 try watching one of the vid of jj or was it diamond's regarding the jet engine part, and try learning about motorlocks ig. by doing so ya will figure out a lot of ways to improve
general 2021-12-06 06:28:00 hello
general 2021-12-06 06:28:38 hello
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:29:24 shutdown does seem to happen often nowadays, but as long as ya save it often, it will be fine
it takes risks to learn new things afterall
general 2021-12-06 06:29:53 don't think they will do it often though ig
general 2021-12-06 06:30:38 looks clean
general 2021-12-06 06:30:57 depends on how much details ya want on it
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:31:33 well there is two ways to learn, which is either learn through tutorial or experiment yourself ig
general 2021-12-06 06:32:02 hello
general 2021-12-06 06:32:54 can anyone help me on what i wrote here: "what should i do if the head attached to the body by motor 2 keeps disintegrating, causing the mech to suddenly fly with 1.6 bil speed, and at some point everything disappears and yet i don't die with constant speed"
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:33:46 idk than ya can try experimenting yourself ya just don't need to make it based on tutorial, but just learn some facts from it to improve
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:34:29 can anyone help me regarding what i wrote: what should i do if the head attached to the body by motor 2 keeps disintegrating, causing the mech to suddenly fly with 1.6 bil speed, and at some point everything disappears and yet i don't die with constant speed
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:36:26 well the mech doesn't have anchor block, nor is the motor 2 torque less than the max. also it rotates, so i can't add unpowered motor ig
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:36:36 looks great, but what ya can try challenge is adding steering system and making wheels motorized ig
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:38:27 oh so in my case, the motor 2 rotates head horizontally for now, and it seems to disconnect there rather than the part ya drew
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:38:56 i guess that's decent, but ya should probably angle the turret, remove all exposed motors, and make sure the rockets aren't exposed ig
the body can be made so it's more curved too by motor locking more
also can try adding tracks if ya have time
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:39:51 well it already defies gravity in default grav
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:39:56 so no need for helium ig
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:40:13 it's around 4 plots tall btw while being proportioned
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:40:50 i didn't have those issues with my other smaller mechs though
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:41:02 but it started once cutter physics became weird
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:41:22 i mean it's connected to only 2d frame of the head though
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:41:32 with width of 1 block
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:41:40 and block count of around 100 or so
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:41:42 for now
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:41:51 it still somehow glitches
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:42:09 try checking out how to do angle lock first then ig
then ya will figure out how to put all of those in more confined space
keep in mind that texts can't collide with blocks
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:42:57 and my mech is only 6.2k block count for now, and it still breaks
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:43:02 a
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:43:12 sad
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:43:26 maybe since i am on macbook air B)
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:43:31 i don't have pc lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:43:53 maybe
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 06:43:55 that's the case
creations-chat 2021-12-06 07:26:36 if so, how about locking horizontally rather than vertically
and other parts, lock it with text signs or disconnector to cover it up more ig
creations-chat 2021-12-06 07:28:59 i see
general 2021-12-06 07:30:42 roblox nowadays
general 2021-12-06 07:30:57 not me lol

general 2022-04-14 20:48:35 another ip grabber
general 2022-04-14 20:48:45 we not watch ip grabber
general 2022-04-14 20:49:07 yes cause you do
general 2022-04-14 20:49:24 epic
general 2022-04-14 20:49:40 if so watch this that explains with proper logic, when you dad will come back home
general 2022-04-14 20:49:41 https://youtu.be/yrZDn1fwgKE
general 2022-04-14 20:50:02 that's the point of ip grabber
general 2022-04-14 20:50:06 no embed
general 2022-04-14 20:50:10 yes

general 2022-04-14 20:50:38 https://youtu.be/yrZDn1fwgKE
general 2022-04-14 20:51:10 no point of ip grabber is to grab your ip, and then due to embed fail, make more people use it
general 2022-04-14 20:51:12 infinite
general 2022-04-14 20:51:12 repeat
general 2022-04-14 20:51:34 yes
general 2022-04-14 20:51:37 i totally do man
general 2022-04-14 20:52:03 all i see is grass on top. is it a new type of rock?
general 2022-04-14 20:52:14 i see
general 2022-04-14 20:52:21 why does it have long thing sticking out
general 2022-04-14 20:52:22 from rock
general 2022-04-14 20:52:35 here
general 2022-04-14 20:53:08 what does it shoot, cavemans?
general 2022-04-14 20:53:29 but won't it destroy the rock while doing so?
general 2022-04-14 20:53:38 how
general 2022-04-14 20:53:41 it has grass
general 2022-04-14 20:53:46 https://youtu.be/yrZDn1fwgKE
general 2022-04-14 20:54:04 i see
general 2022-04-14 20:54:08 that makes sense
general 2022-04-14 20:54:23 so rock has grass on top, with long thing sticking out that shoots
general 2022-04-14 20:54:30 75m shell that
general 2022-04-14 20:54:32 makes the rock move
general 2022-04-14 20:54:39 when it shoots
general 2022-04-14 20:55:04 then what happens to those
general 2022-04-14 20:55:08 cavemans inside
general 2022-04-14 20:55:23 do they die of suffocation
general 2022-04-14 20:56:32 i am white named but i stand porud
general 2022-04-14 20:56:34 for doing nothing
general 2022-04-14 20:56:50 cause they want to break you

general 2022-04-15 23:20:42 i am white name
general 2022-04-18 18:51:08 since this is general, i brought interesting topic to talk about, whether we are real or not
general 2022-04-18 18:51:14 ya guys know of
general 2022-04-18 18:51:21 shrodinger's cat yk
general 2022-04-18 18:51:31 yeah i also think so too
general 2022-04-18 18:51:40 no thx
general 2022-04-18 18:51:53 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlTKTTt47WE
general 2022-04-18 18:51:58 yes we aren't real
general 2022-04-18 18:52:09 cause we are both dead and alive at the same time
general 2022-04-18 18:52:16 hello again lol
general 2022-04-18 18:52:32 you are also not real
general 2022-04-18 18:52:35 if i am not real
general 2022-04-18 18:52:40 hm
general 2022-04-18 18:52:42 no thx
general 2022-04-18 18:52:54 like no joke btw
general 2022-04-18 18:52:59 it's quite scientifically proven
general 2022-04-18 18:53:07 to some degrees
general 2022-04-18 18:53:36 yeah, logically fact, but scientifically, still needs more, but almost proven
general 2022-04-18 18:54:04 i am imagining it so
general 2022-04-18 18:54:32 but then what if we are fake
general 2022-04-18 18:54:35 even if we exist
general 2022-04-18 18:55:03 to what we define as human being that is a living being in which exists,
general 2022-04-18 18:55:07 might not be true
general 2022-04-18 18:55:28 i mean it's a bit confusing ngl but fun to talk about
general 2022-04-18 18:55:52 i mean then why does double slit experiment prove otherwise
general 2022-04-18 18:56:09 that things can be in overlapped state
general 2022-04-18 18:56:23 so for example,
general 2022-04-18 18:57:01 that's because we defined it as a fake being, and everything we humans decide upon are made by fake
general 2022-04-18 18:57:11 that doesn't really exist, but might exist as non living being
general 2022-04-18 18:57:34 there are several possibilities to that
general 2022-04-18 18:57:58 then compare what we created at first, first game pong to nowadays games
general 2022-04-18 18:58:08 and think about what would happen in centuries or more
general 2022-04-18 18:58:29 do you really think it's impossible?
general 2022-04-18 18:58:57 there already are games out there that at least made our solar system in details
general 2022-04-18 18:59:00 with all the physics
general 2022-04-18 18:59:06 do ya think it's not possible in centuries?
general 2022-04-18 18:59:35 wdyamean by that
general 2022-04-18 18:59:56 how do you know
general 2022-04-18 19:00:14 btw if ya are saying
general 2022-04-18 19:00:22 that you think everything is possible,
general 2022-04-18 19:00:28 ya are contradicting yourself,
general 2022-04-18 19:00:32 saying that we could be fake
general 2022-04-18 19:00:39 or not exist too
general 2022-04-18 19:01:02 well it is indeed hard to grasp, but it's worth talking about in my opinion

general 2022-05-01 08:02:42 sad
events-chat 2022-05-01 08:03:12 okay
events-chat 2022-05-01 08:08:00 hello everyone
events-chat 2022-05-01 08:08:38 i am new to these types of event, and i hope we have a great time together
events-chat 2022-05-01 08:11:44 hello fellow computer head
events-chat 2022-05-01 08:12:20 being overly wholesome in social life = morally corrupt inside
events-chat 2022-05-01 08:15:11 btw is there a specific private server for this event
events-chat 2022-05-01 08:16:37 i see
events-chat 2022-05-01 08:17:03 i was wondering since i saw some people together in images of submissions channel
events-chat 2022-05-01 09:01:05 also does the build need to fit in 51x51x36 even after some parts move? or just before anything rotates?
events-chat 2022-05-01 10:56:39 if just in build mode,
events-chat 2022-05-01 10:56:55 it can be a lot larger than that size after spawning?
events-chat 2022-05-01 11:18:42 but if that's the case, i am worried there might be build that reach like 150 blocks width
events-chat 2022-05-01 11:19:10 since some might mototlock it to extend their size
events-chat 2022-05-01 11:27:07 sorry for bothering you again, but i have another question
events-chat 2022-05-01 11:27:32 is it okay to add another feature on a mech other than original features the battlebot i have been chosen to possesses?
events-chat 2022-05-01 13:05:02 i see

events-chat 2022-05-01 15:08:42 that's why i thought of another idea
events-chat 2022-05-01 15:08:58 in addition to this
events-chat 2022-05-01 15:11:53 i may not look like it,
events-chat 2022-05-01 15:12:10 but i have fought a lot with cutters in ps pvp
events-chat 2022-05-02 07:47:29

events-chat 2022-05-02 08:06:41 yes
events-chat 2022-05-02 08:19:44 can i apply custom suspension system if mine is flipper

plane-crazy 2022-05-13 20:06:22 k
general 2022-05-13 20:06:36 sad
general 2022-05-13 20:06:36 meh people mocking me
general 2022-05-13 20:07:11 lol
general 2022-05-14 05:28:27 it looked decent though
events-chat 2022-05-14 17:12:16 joining it tomorrow
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:43:15 sad i lost by vote man
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:43:59 i had all weapon and all functions
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:44:26 just a beam off from top, and he lost weapon and one cutter left with front dmg
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:45:59 i got no vital dmg though
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:47:58 yes ahh
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:26:13 wdyamean
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:27:14 yes so what
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:27:34 explain it got no dmg except one water wheel from it
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:30:06 why does it matter it doesn't make logical sense
mine is a disk not cylinder
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:31:07 but i cut his weapon off
did ya see the match
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:32:56 like i lost by vote even if i got no vital dmg and could function while enemy lost weapon
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:33:17 and flung to sky
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:33:38 i did cut it off so no need
general 2022-05-17 06:48:43 hello
creations-chat 2022-05-20 18:15:24 oh hello mega
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 19:37:29 hello
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 19:37:37 don't ask us
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 19:37:56 we have no idea what's going on exactly, just assumptions
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 19:38:05 mostly due to weight
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 19:38:09 i assume
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 19:38:17 and the point of rotation
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 19:38:25 and torque required to do so
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:27:07 oh hello shin
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:27:14 i am noob here
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:27:22 i see
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:27:48 nah am lazy
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:28:12 let me see
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:28:43 i see
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:28:47 if ya keeping those two,
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:28:56 darker red does fit but hm
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:29:18 how about light green
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:29:20 like mint
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:29:40 well i choose unique combinations ig
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:29:44 if i were to choose it
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:30:21 looks fine but green, maybe nah
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:30:30 green can be
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:30:33 darker blue
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:30:41 or mint
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:31:07 ya can try shading
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:31:12 with red a bit
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:31:25 like getting darker the higher the part is
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:31:31 also for red i mean
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:31:40 hm
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:32:03 how about light purple
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:32:26 for a bit of accent on the shoulder
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:32:28 parts
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:32:35 only small bit
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:32:42 and not use dark red
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:33:30 well you know how i do it
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:33:36 the best is all one color
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:33:38 cause yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:35:00 only white mostly works
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:35:07 i was jking btw
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:35:18 but i indeed do go all white
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:35:23 i see
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:35:37 i might still let my new one be
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:35:39 all white
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:35:58 decrease collisions and motors
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:36:07 also use tnt instead of springs and disconnectors
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:36:08 done
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:36:33 well also use more beams ig?
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:37:29 and sometimes if the physics is not really possible in real life or give strain on something, it might glitch or lag
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:37:34 due to collisions
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:38:30 ig ya can also try
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:38:35 reducing overlapping blocks
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:38:52 like ones that are
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:38:55 not visible
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:39:30 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:39:46 just motorlock wingpanels maybe
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:39:50 and piston lock it
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:40:28 even if i am the one trying to tell ya the tip,
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:40:33 i can't fix lag of my mech lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:41:00 when things goes slowmo but your mech moves fast
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:41:17 it is
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:41:40 like i can spin torso 360 in 3~5 second,
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:41:46 but to go down from 800 alt,
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:41:50 it takes 2 mins
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:42:32 also powered motors are keep going crazy
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:42:34 and bending
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:43:15 they weren't used to
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:43:23 mine,
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:43:26 it just is bent
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:43:43 well before my head went
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:43:47 infinite speed
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:43:54 on speedometer due to motor 2
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:44:37 
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:44:55 well i can't wrap over how it glitches out
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:45:21 i know but like
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:45:22 how
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:45:49 do they have like build up of collisions
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:46:09 well anyways
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:46:27 anything ya need more words on?
general 2022-05-21 20:47:10 hello
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 20:48:37 i see

general 2022-05-21 20:49:26 from bb
general 2022-05-21 20:49:31 at least chat
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 21:14:58 depends on how much motorlock ya doing
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 21:21:25 if ya gonna angle lock the nose,
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 21:21:34 ya probably need 400 for nose for most detail
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 21:21:47 if simple angle lock, ig 100?
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 21:21:51 i see
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 21:21:53 then nvm
plane-crazy 2022-05-21 21:37:00 understand

plane-crazy 2022-05-23 03:04:58 old memories
plane-crazy 2022-05-23 03:05:15 if it can disintegrate and transform, it will be pretty nice
plane-crazy 2022-05-23 03:08:50 cringe

plane-crazy 2022-05-28 18:56:08 drag
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 18:11:05 how does the hip of my mech look so far
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 18:11:24 i meant only the done part
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 18:11:42 a
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 18:11:55 does it look that confusing
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 18:12:09 people tends to say that my design choices are confusing
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 18:14:25 yeah i mostly choose spiky type of design
general 2022-05-30 18:35:06 omg i am not white name
creations-chat 2022-05-30 19:03:07 hm another trash talker
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 19:05:59 another confused person
plane-crazy 2022-05-30 19:06:00 sad
creations-chat 2022-05-30 19:07:24 not a good thing for higher standard = more motivations for higher quality stuffs
creations-chat 2022-05-30 19:09:36 yeah i didn't want upvote for that no joke
cause it really is a low effort build
and why care about being accepted to community
just enjoy building and sharing etc in community
creations-chat 2022-05-30 19:15:29 yes ya are right
creations-chat 2022-05-30 19:17:46 yes
creations-chat 2022-05-30 19:19:49 but low effort depends on standards so ig it's fine

plane-crazy 2022-06-03 23:14:20 if that got inventor rank, i would also get one
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 23:14:28 when did ya discover that
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 23:15:55 ya basically just used the new weird physics of
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 23:16:22 how hover thruster faced closed toward block results in thrust
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 23:19:17 that's why i am saying
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 23:19:23 it's not worth inventor rank
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 01:41:29 
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 01:55:24 bad
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 01:55:34 np

general 2022-06-09 05:47:44 hello
general 2022-06-09 05:48:27 i am so tired from covering my mech
general 2022-06-09 05:48:45 it's a pain man
general 2022-06-09 05:48:55 just get any random role like me
general 2022-06-09 05:49:05 and you will be able to use command
general 2022-06-09 05:49:17 i just randomly made a small plane
general 2022-06-09 05:49:22 and put it in rank request
general 2022-06-09 05:49:30 then done
general 2022-06-09 05:49:35 just meet
general 2022-06-09 05:49:39 requirements

general 2022-06-09 05:50:51 about requirements
general 2022-06-09 05:51:01 i almost never build planes tbh
general 2022-06-09 05:51:05 am mech builder
general 2022-06-09 05:51:17 but plane is simple so i built it
general 2022-06-09 05:51:20 for role
general 2022-06-09 05:52:54 ya need that role to
general 2022-06-09 05:52:59 type command for private server
general 2022-06-09 05:53:05 just any builder role
general 2022-06-09 05:55:34 just make plane
general 2022-06-09 05:55:39 that is altered from
general 2022-06-09 05:55:46 tutorial plane
general 2022-06-09 05:55:47 then done

creations-chat 2022-08-24 09:10:47 nice job
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:57:04 yes it looks so great !!
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:57:27 now the next step to upgrading it is
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:57:30 using 800 motors
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:58:54 too little motorlocks
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:59:00 from what i can see
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:59:16 a
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 21:59:32 tbh i really have used around 800 motors on my unfinished p 40 mustang
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:01:11 i don't really have a motivation to finish nearly all of my builds
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:01:29 
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:01:31 this is that p40 which is unfinished
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:02:41 oh is it too fat
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:02:57 it's around 3 blocks wide though
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:03:44 i see
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:04:25 now make a proper nose of the jet with motorlock 🙂
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:06:25 that was wip
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:06:25 another image of a mech
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:06:43 nah the nose ain't motorlocked, but the cockpit is i think
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:07:05 oh wait maybe
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:07:07 a little
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:07:21 he angled locked it a bit ig
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:07:26 but what i mean is
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:07:33 like make it look smooth
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:07:36 like the real one
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:07:43 lol
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:08:54 yeah it is hard, but i did get close to it before
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:09:22 i used around 6 triange wedges, piston locked it, then angles locked it
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:09:32 that is possible
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:09:37 but that's tiring
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:10:04 that's why using triangle wedge is generally better ig
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:10:15 ya just need to arrange it well
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:10:20 then lock it
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:10:39 for my mech, i don't have enough blocks
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:11:49 how about motorlocking wingpanels for nose
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:11:51 it works well
plane-crazy 2022-08-25 22:14:36 what am i
