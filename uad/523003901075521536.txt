general 2020-09-28 01:17:27 How do you get ranks?
general 2020-09-28 01:26:09 general is less used than other channels
general 2020-09-28 02:04:47 why is there not a road
general 2020-09-28 02:04:53 just a generic asphalt road
general 2020-09-28 02:05:06 there is not a generic asphalt road in the map

general 2020-09-28 02:05:51 oh
general 2020-09-28 02:05:53 well yea
general 2020-09-28 02:06:05 at least it would be nice to add a generic asphalt road from base to airport or sum
general 2020-09-28 02:06:14 fair enough
general 2020-09-28 02:07:39 Mobile support seemed bad from the getgo
general 2020-09-28 02:07:46 Half of devices cant even run it
general 2020-09-28 02:09:23 This old map is square smol boring
general 2020-09-28 02:09:32 But less hard on mobile processors
general 2020-09-28 02:09:41 Would you rather new larger cooler map
general 2020-09-28 02:09:47 Or mobile accessibility
general 2020-09-28 02:10:23 And fighter jets have to turn like every 2 seconds

creations-chat 2020-09-28 04:09:17

creations-chat 2020-09-28 04:11:16 I tried to make it close to life-size in game, for multiple reasons
creations-chat 2020-09-28 04:13:52 Patheticness
general 2020-09-28 04:14:43 Very not controversial, can you agree?
creations-chat 2020-09-28 04:14:57 Yep
creations-chat 2020-09-28 04:15:20 We just don't do it idk, i dont do it because it makes me look like a little kid
creations-chat 2020-09-28 04:15:54 My build is left to other's opinions and so what the result is generally reflects the percentage that liked it
creations-chat 2020-09-28 04:17:32 I agree
creations-chat 2020-09-28 04:22:43 Ew
creations-chat 2020-09-28 04:23:07 They look cool

general 2020-11-04 10:23:34 I think the new update will only be on new servers
general 2020-11-04 10:23:52 So older ones before the update are not updated but new servers come with the update
general 2020-11-04 10:24:05 Maybe restart the vip server

creations-chat 2021-02-07 01:57:41 For the question from before, it wasn't my favourite because of a little bit of inaccuracy. But ive just gotten rid of it since yeah, that didn't have any reason to warrant a downvote.
creations-chat 2021-02-07 02:00:05 Are you going to go on a sob rampage? This is an online forum. You're gonna have people that simply don't like whoever's builds have been plastered on the <#384025409945337856> and that goes for me as well.

general 2021-02-13 10:08:14 It makes the game easier to add features to
general 2021-02-13 10:08:53 If that happened there would be huge negative uproar
general 2021-02-13 10:09:01 so that wouldnt happen intentionally
general 2021-02-13 10:09:20 Hopefully 0.0
general 2021-02-13 10:10:01 But then there is occasional data loss in pvp and vip servers
general 2021-02-13 10:10:04 is that a bug
general 2021-02-13 10:10:22 oh ok
general 2021-02-13 10:11:08 what

creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:50:10 bruh why would you start an argument over some downvotes

1. it's not worth it
2. It's blocking your progress
3. it wastes people's time
creations-chat 2021-03-24 08:54:38 Congratulations (you corrected me, thanks, no cap) and also bruh it's not worth it to start arguing over a trivial mistake. All it does it waste your own time and drains your mind.

creations-chat 2021-06-07 10:07:35 The U2 looks a bit too short. Wings are overdone (simplify a bit, make smoother). Darken the colour, it's a bit light. Those post things on the wings (bombs?) are too small, ***embiggen*** them
creations-chat 2021-06-07 10:20:05 hey dude, if you want to be able to see more angles for a plane you're planning to build I recommend using a blueprint (eg U2 spy plane blueprint) or 3d model (sketchfab is good.)

creations-chat 2021-06-15 06:56:13 A close-in weapon system (CIWS /ˈsiːwɪz/ SEE-wiz)[1] is a point-defense weapon system for detecting and destroying short-range incoming missiles and enemy aircraft which have penetrated the outer defenses, typically mounted shipboard in a naval capacity. Nearly all classes of larger modern warships are equipped with some kind of CIWS device.

There are two types of CIWS systems. A gun-based CIWS usually consists of a combination of radars, computers, and rapid-firing multiple-barrel rotary cannons placed on a rotating turret. Missile-based CIWSs use either infra-red, passive radar/ESM, or semi-active radar terminal guidance to guide missiles to the targeted enemy aircraft or other threats. In some cases, CIWS are used on land to protect military bases. In this case, the CIWS can also protect the base from shell and rocket fire.

creations-chat 2021-06-20 07:31:58 usually when people post a build or ask for feedback they're proud of it (they used their current top skillset) so I think we should mind that

creations-chat 2021-09-02 01:03:44 
creations-chat 2021-09-02 01:06:15 personally, not really, i don't think im seeing your side of the thingo

it might possibly be like that because the thing that juts out of the fuselage that holds the landing gear is too small
creations-chat 2021-09-02 01:09:45 the sides of the fuselage line up with the blueprint lines (besides the landing gear part)

i think that's whats missing

edit: i see now, i thought you said the actual body was thin, but thanks for your insight

creations-chat 2021-09-10 00:42:43 oh what's up with it?
creations-chat 2021-09-10 00:46:29 hmm i see, i think it was the distance at where the picture was taken since there are sharp corners present on the aircraft

creations-chat 2022-01-23 00:43:42 Off topic, but a quick guide to your/you're

You're is short for **you are**. It doesn't make sense in "I love you're build" because it means "I love you are build." It would make sense in " You're such a good builder!"

Your is used for when you are referring to another person's thing. "Your build is great!" "Can I have a look at your plane?"

creations-chat 2022-02-15 23:17:25 Hmmm idk, it looks fine at that angle but the first angle made it look small

I have another suggestion, make the vert stabs look more connected to the fuselage, it could probably be ripped out of the fuselage during some high force manoeuvre

You're is short for you are. It doesn't make sense in "I love you're build" because it means "I love you are build."

Your is used for when you are referring to another person's thing. "Your build is great!" "Can I have a look at your plane?"

creations-chat 2022-03-10 09:38:45 <@!744567798025420831> 

if motor angle locks don't work, use camera locks

Here's my feedback:
1. Nose too long
2. Wing looks like it was angle locked in the wrong place
3. plane looks weirdly long, might just be my perception

i suggest comparing blueprints (resized *to scale*) on three angles of your plane to help you make it better
creations-chat 2022-03-10 09:42:14 angle lock mechanism should be in the spine, not halfway out the wings

You're is short for you are. It doesn't make sense in "I love you're build" because it means "I love you are build."

Your is used for when you are referring to another person's thing. "Your build is great!" "Can I have a look at your plane?"

creations-chat 2022-03-31 01:45:20 it's really easy if you already know basic angle and motor lock

creations-chat 2022-04-24 08:43:47 Your spine curves down, the spine should curve up the opposite way slightly

The vertical stabilisers look too small, either that or the body and "neck" of the plane is too long

creations-chat 2022-04-28 09:59:02 in all honesty even if there are small details I cannot see in an unaltered image i think shaders are artificial leverage over others that don't have access to them

it is more charming in my opinion to see builds like yours that already look epic with just normal lighting

i'm trying to be respectful and not start anything

And what I've gathered from his little explanation is that magnet locking only gets rid of the motors, it doesn't impact the shape of the plane when motor locking either way

I suggest Jordan to do blueprint overlays for maximum realism
creations-chat 2022-06-01 05:26:56 Can find vulpen tutorial i think

But gist of it is find a paint program that u can add layers to, put a blueprint on the first layer then go to the layer on top set it to 50% opacity then put the picture of your plane and compare it and make sure to resize the pictures to scale otherwise it might be too long or too squashed etc

You do not need to retort to a toxic person, you can ignore them and not ignite a conflict

What you must do is be bearable
creations-chat 2022-07-02 05:47:38 If you wish to get better at building I suggest you look at the feedback and do better on a newer build. Ignoring feedback is ignoring a chance to improve

creations-chat 2022-07-11 10:43:40 ok, could've said that first and made yourself not look like an asshat

1. Fix the canopy, the join looks too low and is dumb
2. Don't name it "f16i" it is clearly not an f16
3. It looks super stubby because of lack of low angles in such a tiny build

Better off rebuilding it at a slightly larger scale, incorporating proper angle and motor lock, studying the elegant shape of fighter jets and renaming it to something that is not real
creations-chat 2022-07-11 11:15:33 People when they

"(Name of irl jet)" "custom" 

Completely contradictory and a bad excuse for a failed attempt

They should just own up and ask for ways to improve instead of trying to soften the emotional blow

creations-chat 2022-07-16 10:28:14 lmao
creations-chat 2022-07-16 10:31:19 how many upvotes could this get

i think the standards look lower because of the flood of newbies and the physical increase in the number of ppl that look in <#384025409945337856> 

the number of people that have been here for a while and have high standards are being diluted by all the low-standard kids

<@723940197456281640> that's true, but imo it still inflates the upvote count just because the lighting is more impressive
creations-chat 2022-07-16 10:44:17 i def remember mods saying it was banned (this was a while ago) 

not dissing scout, this tank is really good and im not saying its bad in any way, but this is almost definitely going to get more upvotes because of the shaders

you can click on the link for the tank in the plane crazy lighting

<@849139320106516491>  yeah
and to people that glance at a creation before making their decision, usually the positive impression the lighting makes is enough to make them upvote when they would usually ignore it or dv

creations-chat 2022-07-17 10:07:36 I don't even know what "corvus" is but everything in your creations thing is shit, you know it, and you don't even try to make it better

nobody will appreciate the shit

we will only appreciate good builds that have effort put into them
creations-chat 2022-07-17 10:10:18 that's less shit than the stuff you posted just now, hence you got a mid amount of upvotes

is there any improvement along the line though? your jet is shit, your car is shit. you even try to sweet talk us by "it's not bad to be basic right?"

if you want to get better and if you want to get respect, stop posting shit and start trying to build actual non-shit
creations-chat 2022-07-17 10:12:45 i mean bruh complaining that "basic" isn't recognised in a server full of talented creators is just shortsighted

help 2022-07-18 05:15:23 1. Camera locking is a way of angle locking that doesn't require motors

It's good for parts of a build that would otherwise be overcomplicated by angled components

Camera lock welds to the pilot seat, so you can't connect it with a motorlock tower

2. Piston lock is a way of fine tuning the position of a block or component so it can fill a space effectively

This is good for highly technically complex builds that have many different shapes 

It can be glitchy

Usually these two are used in tandem with motorlocking (especially piston  lock) to enhance the effect motorlocking components onto a build has
creations-chat 2022-07-19 10:11:12 maybe raise the score requirement because theres so many more voters nowadays
creations-chat 2022-07-19 10:13:32 expert designer is supposed to be for the best of the best that arent HOF...

in my honest opinion I think it should be 200 score

it has been reached before by good builders
creations-chat 2022-07-19 10:15:41 most average builds now which would have evened out at probably 30-30 in 2020 are now getting 120-10 

*expert* designer isnt supposed to be for everyone
creations-chat 2022-07-19 10:24:02 the only reason people shit on expert designer now is because the physical amount of voters has increased in this channel, most of which don't have much skill and so automatically upvote anything that looks mid-above (or is a meme build)

it has gotten easier to get a high quantity of upvotes, but the requirements for the ranks havent changed
creations-chat 2022-07-19 10:26:15 maybe there should be a filter for meme builds, because they dont demonstrate skill
creations-chat 2022-07-19 10:31:33 If a meme build is obviously low effort, like a fucken carrot or a chair, it should be denied

the fact your build is a meme has definitely helped it along, but theres no denying that it's not a low effort build
creations-chat 2022-07-19 10:33:53 shaders are a different story

my opinion is  that for creations posts they shouldnt be allowed
builds have achieved high upvote quotas without shaders
they artificially enhance the build without adding anything to it

the same thing applies to actual edits of the image

creations-chat 2022-07-23 04:29:37 mfw people post a build that gets disliked and then say they hate this place
creations-chat 2022-07-23 04:31:41 I know exactly what happened

You posted a build with you and a furry

You got disliked + hated on

that's it

whitenames ngl
creations-chat 2022-07-23 04:33:43 it tends to happen after the few people that build well and patrol the chat a lot have voted, then the whitenames slowly come in and add their opinion (upvotes)
creations-chat 2022-07-23 04:37:18 people need to get used to the fact their effort is not always appreciated and builds can be bad
creations-chat 2022-07-23 04:40:37 I sense another argument starting up

m8 u gonna want to shut your mouth before something happens

the island was bad, having a furry in there only polarised our opinions

creations-chat 2022-07-23 05:02:49 are you saying the ship is bad too?
creations-chat 2022-07-23 05:04:50 Your plane is so fucking bad

What is that nose

What kind of person are you to throw a random person's build under the bus to try and prove something that is wrong

Your build is undeniably worse than that guy's boat

The only thing wrong with his boat is the shape of the hull

The only thing wrong with your plane is EVERYTHING

take responsibility for your own stuff
creations-chat 2022-07-23 05:10:00 You should take your madness elsewhere, there are already enough complainers here

Jets are both built often and have really high standards for quality. Your jet was shit on because it is both trash + does not hold a candle to the best builds here. Ships are none of those things. You should know that the amount of upvotes was deserved and you were lucky not to get hate for it.

creations-chat 2022-07-24 07:51:33 cool but is there a way to make it less wobbly
creations-chat 2022-07-24 07:54:41 rip

I have an idea

Attach ropes to the suspensions

It'll make the springiness less temperamental

Leave the rope settings on default

I know, the ropes will stretch with it

creations-chat 2022-07-24 11:37:09 not bad, gg

one of my personal gripes is the windows, they look large, but there's not much you could do

would earn my upvote
creations-chat 2022-07-24 11:39:35 it depends on your priorities

If you are going to post the 747 in creations, you are probably better off using the smaller text blocks for the windows in the post but just use the regular glass windows in public servers

that's what I would do
creations-chat 2022-07-24 11:41:37 imo Qantas would be a super cool one

or Singapore Airlines if they have 747s, their livery is epic too
general 2022-07-24 12:35:25 imo cockpit shape is super weird

u could improve it by fixing the cockpit shape, making the wings 0.5 - 1 block thick and replacing the engines with a custom built one
general 2022-07-24 12:35:32 and angle the wings slightly
general 2022-07-24 12:35:38 then it will be hipster gg
general 2022-07-24 12:36:39 it is probably the width of the plane that makes it look short yeah

general 2022-07-24 12:46:45 well yes, they are better than the default
general 2022-07-24 12:46:55 I suggest though
general 2022-07-24 12:47:10 that if you were not to use those turboprops
general 2022-07-24 12:47:16 and instead use a jet engine
general 2022-07-24 12:48:05 you could make the turbine (spinny bit) a paddle wheel and make the cowling (engine housing / cover) out of wedges instead
creations-chat 2022-07-24 23:08:21 lmao
creations-chat 2022-07-25 03:55:14 I would ban the noobs who make zero effort to ask for help and get defensive when we tell them something is wrong with their build

creations-chat 2022-07-28 03:38:05 he really is double-wide <:pain:644301805534183464> 

<@927145074867978240>  if you rebuild it consider the angles of the plane and use angle lock. The nose is fine but the wings and the rear of the fuselage on the actual plane taper back. On your plane it's just straight and then boom angle down

Not using angle lock won't help you make a better plane

creations-chat 2022-07-30 06:55:23 There is no reason to out of the blue point out something about somebody that has no relation to you as gossip

It's important to realise there is a time and a  place for these discussions, particularly because they are of sensitive nature

Do you believe it is your obligation to talk about LGTV 4KHD and etc in this server?
creations-chat 2022-07-30 07:17:26 Oh yeah, I see what you mean

Typically, the kind of audience this server attracts is in the 13 - 17 y/o range of people where most openly diss LGTV because of its differences

It is important to, as a person, suppress your anger and accept there is nothing you can do in certain situations (such as these)

Going out and attempting to cause drama (whether intentional or unintentional), however, is a drain on both your mental health and the health of the people in this server

Try to look at what's happening from another perspective and attempt to understand their point of view

Agreement can only be made through understanding

Your is used for when you are referring to another person's thing. "Your build is great!" "Can I have a look at your plane?"

creations-chat 2022-08-08 11:37:14 Suddenly I feel the urge to physically harm you, but I won't + can't bc this is online

The general age level of this server is 13-17, and so some may find they cannot bring their ideas across in an intelligent manner. Usually that causes arguments because the person speaking about their beliefs becomes annoyed by the seeming lack of discursion in that topic.

Soup is not an unde; they just feel a need to speak about their beliefs in a place which may not always be receptive to them.

creations-chat 2022-08-14 06:03:43 remove the camo, it doesn't look like an a-10, more like a scuffed sukhoi at this point

It might look more like an a10 without the camo distracting our perception of the shapes

creations-chat 2022-08-24 14:08:18 Badly proportioned
+ overrated and overbuilt aircraft
+ many extremely well made examples already exist

This is an example of the building meta being pushed to an extreme because of an abundance of skill
creations-chat 2022-08-24 14:10:55 There are worse examples, yes, but this is pcc + what I said before

Anything worse than that would be mass downvoted anyway

creations-chat 2022-08-29 05:07:09 poop i have none yet, interior is a mess

only the exterior is presentable
creations-chat 2022-08-29 05:09:23 literally the whole thing is hollow besides some floors lol

it can move and stuff but there's no interior yet
creations-chat 2022-08-29 05:23:33 don't worry, i will add toilet 🥰
creations-chat 2022-08-29 05:34:40 This specific ship irl does not have a helipad, ikr very dumb design

instead it is a large empty deck for storing whatever
creations-chat 2022-08-29 05:37:31 Might modify it slightly just so users can land their helis on it and stuff, idk

<@984694509772357662>  ikr its so stupid, I remember reading about it and seeing tons of complaints about its inadequacy as a patrol ship

Its armaments are too sparse and too small and there is no helipad
creations-chat 2022-08-29 05:43:22 yeah

They actually revised it and made one new ship called HMS Clyde, which has more higher calibre guns and a real helipad
creations-chat 2022-08-29 05:46:44 Thanks boi

yes I have been considering adding a helipad for a while, I might rebrand it as HMS Clyde, do the according modifications and then EPICNESS

Cool heli
creations-chat 2022-08-29 05:49:44 Rip

You could possibly piston lock the  landing skates down by less than half a block to make it go lower

Yes I'll try and make space to save 2 versions, but eventually I'll have to do the interior for one lol

Ooft

Makes the choice easier

creations-chat 2022-08-29 14:57:35 I'm 15

you are breaking the discord tos FUCK OFF FROM THE SERVER and come back when you become 13
creations-chat 2022-08-29 14:59:39 <@456226577798135808>  maybe you should read the TOS the minimum age for using this platform is 13

PISS the HECK off this server and off discord

dumbass you're still 13 nobody cares if you "will be 13" like bro
 
tos is TERMS OF SERVICE
creations-chat 2022-08-29 15:02:01 so you're a 12 year old too?
creations-chat 2022-08-29 15:04:20 why do you care about "forgive" smh bruh you're too young to be here

What you have to do is delete your discord account and only come back once you are 13 years old no exceptions
creations-chat 2022-08-29 15:06:30 I suggest you stop typing big paragraphs trying to prove yourself "right" before all of us get warned

plane-crazy 2022-08-30 09:27:28 man if u want to try building a good plane then experiment with new things
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 09:27:44 so each build is progress and not a rinse-and-repeat of your current skillset
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 09:28:06 so make new intake designs and compare them
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 09:31:19 opinion: rejecting motor lock is rejecting skill
creations-chat 2022-08-30 09:32:01 in early 2021 that wouldve been downvote bombed
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 09:33:53 alright but not good*

There is no build you looked at and thought "damn, this is really impressive," I assure you (unless it was extremely big)
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 09:34:30 imo motor lock makes plane crazy unique but I still want that block resizing function
plane-crazy 2022-08-30 09:35:06 yep

creations-chat 2022-08-30 11:35:54 <@456226577798135808>  people are gonna downvote your plane for looking goofy even though it's accurate to the irl plane 💀

Not an insult; the irl f16 sufa looks funny and not much like the normal f16 so people will ignore sufa and judge the looks in comparison to a normal f16 and not the sufa variant

creations-chat 2022-09-02 13:54:42 <@291284163762323457>  Yeah, i added some stuff to the bow deck

<@653059099533115423>  i'll try that, ty for the suggestion
creations-chat 2022-09-02 14:24:26 YES I have one, someone told me abt it a while ago

So basically when u finish bending an angle lock to the right place, instead of letting go of the key press and hold the other motor movement key so that both movement keys are pressed at the same time for like 5 seconds so the movement stops

then after that u can let go and it shouldn't lag back
creations-chat 2022-09-02 14:46:53 oh no

wdym corrupts build apart?

hmm I think that specifically could be a lag problem, sometimes it does it to me but it just teleports back into place like it should

does it make the fold unusable like does it just stay oj the ground or something
creations-chat 2022-09-02 14:50:39 hmm I think that specifically could be a lag problem, sometimes it does it to me but it just teleports back into place like it should

does it make the fold unusable like does it just stay oj the ground or something
creations-chat 2022-09-02 14:53:28 if u could send me a clip of that happening, that would be optimal

Rn the only thing I can suggest is repeat it or hold it for longer bc I'm not entirely sure

I've managed to make it work on two of my builds that previously had really bad motor lag problems

Rip

<@657846484397719553>  are you holding it for long enough? u gotta hold both keys down for at least like 5 seconds for it to work
creations-chat 2022-09-02 15:09:59 u don't let go of any key when u want to stop the motor movement, you instead press and hold down both the key u used to move it and the key that counteracts the movement 

For example

Forwards = F, Backwards = R

Hold down F to move to desired location

WITHOUT LETTING GO OF F press and hold down R and hold both keys for 5 seconds

Timing is important

creations-chat 2022-09-06 09:42:29 Inaccuracies abound
creations-chat 2022-09-06 09:45:18 Almost the same + same things wrong

Non motorlocked front area
Half half wedge that really does not belong
You didn't place the tracks

You basically skimped over placing some pretty big details in the front

+ detailless (where's the signs and ladders and whatever?)
creations-chat 2022-09-06 09:47:23 Sounds like you're getting mad over my pretty tame feedback 👻
creations-chat 2022-09-06 09:49:38 Better but those things I said before still stand out too much

If you're going to make the tracks consider using signs instead of full blocks bc signs are thinner

Plus actually consider the shape of the front and combine it with your build

Simply ignoring it won't make it go away
creations-chat 2022-09-06 09:55:11 I wasn't talking about that half block, I'm talking about the front bit where there's two half wedge down 1x2s and half wedges next to them

It's a significant part of the tank and you're better off angle locking those details in for better visual effect
creations-chat 2022-09-06 10:13:00 On the right track (HAH get it, funny.)

creations-chat 2022-09-13 22:56:28 The camera saturation effect is much much smaller than the effect the painted colours have

I would know

If you want to have a natural looking heli, change the colours

Your eyeballs will please you

bug-reports 2022-09-29 14:23:06 Bug with hover drives where you just glitch in the sky when flying (looks like a freeze/build vanishes for a few frames), the hover drive instantly stops working and you fall out of the sky

Happened to one propeller on one of my aircraft which was quite fun. It also happened to my pvp plane at least three times recently

creations-chat 2022-10-01 00:07:40 <@1000875841691078777>  ok here we go

1. Please fix the cockpit it looks like a gjsolo nose

2. Please fix the crazy amount of exposed locks on the wings

3. Wtf are the hardpoints doing so far out on the wing, bring them closer to the fuselage

4. Just delete the custom control surfaces on the main wings theyre super ugly

5. Make paintjob slightly darker and SLIGHTLY bluer

6. Yeah that's it

creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:10:25 ppl forget that technology progresses and the f35 is a multirole plane capable of ground attack, bombing and fighting
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:12:34 ikr, imagine a6 intruder, f22 and b2 spirit when you can have f35

all that functionality in one standard package
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:15:21 that's right but which of those aircraft is the most well-rounded and hence worth purchasing and using

one aircraft for the power of three

future air power
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:18:14 what about the cost of maintenance and separate technologies to manage

how much more would that cost relative to an f35 and hence how much more power would countries with the f35 have
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:21:07 not necessarily for the us but other countries that purchase it in collaboration with the US

the us economy is massive but these smaller countries economies are not and so wish to have a well-rounded, technologically advanced, relatively simple-to-maintain jet

the f35 was built for export markets as well, unlike the f22

<@700761272282775593>  f18 stealth is bad + it is very old
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:23:11 that's where the us government fucked up, it was supposed to be one variant but they changed it because of issues

hence all the media complaints trickled from it
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:25:46 which jacks up the maintenance cost and puts all governments that field the planes in strife

the f35 program sadly diverged because of the aforementioned problems that were the fault of boeing and the govt
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:27:51 yes, that is true

it's good for foreign markets though because only a handful of countries field carriers and so really only one variant is necessary which still doesn't compromise on its ability to do its job well

To the us, it was a failure in its aim but not in its function
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:29:56 14 countries have the f35

seen one in RAAF base near me
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:32:01 not as much as a6 intruder + f22 + b2 spirit combined!!!!!!!!!

1 plane with functionality of 3!!!!!!

usa fucked up with carrier ability tho!!!!
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:34:04 f14 undoubtedly looks cooler let's be real here

but f35 could smoke f14 in an engagement any day
creations-chat 2022-10-03 04:37:15 F35 hurts government coffers tho not as much as a6 intruder + f22 + b2 spirit combined!!!!!!!!!

1 plane with functionality of 3!!!!!!

usa fucked up with carrier ability tho!!!!

u guys see in desert storm they used tons of different planes in different roles that the f35 could fill (besides probably the b52)

creations-chat 2022-10-04 02:58:07 does not change the fact you built it too wide by something like a block

it also looks squashed vertically

plane-crazy 2022-10-04 03:00:42 I know about the engines but I don't care about them as much as I do about the fuselage shape
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 03:00:56 What you have done is exaggerated the squashedness of the fuselage
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 03:01:07 By like half a block at least
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 03:01:20 my man does not take feedback i stg

plane-crazy 2022-10-04 03:03:52 no its too fat because the fuselage is too fat OR it's too squashed because everything is too squashed
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 03:04:16 how is working at 15 illegal
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 03:04:40 im in Australia, we can work from 14 iirc
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 03:05:00 ik so I didn't know the American laws
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 03:05:14 that would make the engines ridiculously small
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 03:05:20 the only way to fix it is to fix the fuselage

creations-chat 2022-10-04 03:18:43 talked to him about it, there is a problem. The fuselage is either too wide by a block or the fuselage is too squashed by a block / half a block. Either way it is too squashed.

plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:44:48 u saying it's good or shitass because realistically it is the latter
creations-chat 2022-10-04 14:45:39 on top of that it's one wide and has those stupid motors on the vert stabs that are so in fashion nowadays
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:46:31 nearly nothing has changed
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:46:42 from the last time you showed us your plane
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:46:58 good to hear you hid those tumours
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:48:23 there is no high motorlock unless you have three thousand blocks for one normal fighter jet
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:49:29 cam locking is easy when everything you have is not either blocked or covered by towers
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:49:42 it's best for small builds  that don't have any space for angle locks
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:49:47 like yours
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:50:35 mhm
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:50:54 So it becomes a science of the perfect distance and angle for your aim block (if that makes sense)
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:52:20 that's almost impossible to avoid with regular angle locks anyway because of human error in timing the release of the button
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:53:33 resetting it every time u reload is also annoying
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:53:57 I always forget to do that for my pvp plane and it aggravates me
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:54:14 I have them all bound to one key lmao
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:54:33 I use disconnectors
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:55:03 insignificant on a big plane
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:55:24 Agree
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:55:43 I found a way to make them use only one column for the tower so that a motor tower is 4 wide not 5
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:55:48 when using disconnectors
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:56:06 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:56:34 fucking swear by it bro, you can't make good looking builds without it that aren't massive af
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:56:55 on god
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:57:00 pistons work so well with angle lock
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:57:22 Whenever something is poorly co figured just edit the piston settings and don't shift around the position  of the motor
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:58:03 Because all the angle locked builds you see are also complex and have lots of detail put into it and are typically not pvp planes
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:58:08 So of course they're laggy
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:58:43 How are you gonna do that with irl physics?
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:59:10 Just motorlock them into the fuselage
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:59:47 5 intakes
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 14:59:49 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 15:00:11 ive seen that literally every person ever with a shitass build in this game uses "I have a life" as an excuse
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 15:00:14 Universally so
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 15:00:57 it's funny, there's basically a 100% chance a person like that will say it
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 15:01:08 in an extended conversation you can bet on it
general 2022-10-04 15:02:10 hof
general 2022-10-04 15:02:16 look at the realism
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 15:02:46 so instead of spending one minute to extend the height of the tower you spend 20 building some intakes
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 15:02:49 gj
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 15:03:03 pretty much
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 15:03:37 use it with angle lock, make a non shitty plane and you will profit
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 15:03:44 piston lock on a shitty plane will just make it worse
general 2022-10-04 15:05:11 beamng <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 15:06:55 Cam locking works fine too in that situation ig

Still no saving your plane though
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 15:07:58 problem is you have to wait for the piston to extend and lock and camera lock does not play ball like that
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 15:08:11 just don't??? It's a personal choice
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 15:10:39 Whatever floats your boat buddy
plane-crazy 2022-10-04 15:10:52 Legitimately sounds like that'll work though

creations-chat 2022-10-08 08:05:44 hello Mortified_AWACS

Full tutorial

Go to www.photopea.com (you can use others but this one is the most convenient)

1. Press "New Project"

2. Set resolution to desired one (not required) and then press "Create"

3. Open an image of your blueprint (use "edit" --> "transform" --> "scale" and resize it

4. Create a new layer and place it on top of the layer you have your blueprint on (Go to "Layer" --> "New" --> "Layer)

Your new layer should be visible on the right hand side of the screen in the layers panel

5. Select your new layer (name is default "Layer 1", change opacity to 50% (this setting is visible directly above your layers)

6. Insert an image of your plane on the new layer and go "edit" --> "transform" --> "scale" to resize it and "edit" --> "transform" --> "rotate" to rotate it

7. Enjoy

Note: do not under any circumstance use "free transform"  because you might mess up the scale of your build

bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:18:41 somebody somewhere on this game used too much data and the servers became unstable thats my guess
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 14:19:15 use a vip server
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 14:19:22 cheap + lag is way less bad
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 14:19:33 still there but its playable
creations-chat 2022-10-09 14:21:23 (hax?)
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:32:41 I've observed the server lag when using builds and spawning them

Ping when builds are despawned is normal

Ping when builds are loading in spikes to about 600

When setting pistons, ping increases by about 300 per second until it reaches a cap and returns to about 500

Angle locking lag is the same except the cap is much higher (in a vip server around 3k, in a public server with at least three big builds it went up to 17k before the server died)

Public servers are incredibly laggy and the characters desync for up to 10 seconds at a time

The lag originated about two days ago and appears to have worsened over time
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:34:35 Possibly

The ping is really bad when the data transfer is going on, which might be related
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:34:42 yeah
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:35:40 Alr
general 2022-10-09 14:36:14 guys omg

bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:38:03 You get zero ping lag at all in public servers?
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:38:18 All public servers I've joined are in the dumps
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:38:23 lol
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:38:58 Bc the lag was playing havoc with my build i left perf stats on for the last couple days and it's terrible

bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:42:42 physics lag becomes horrendous mostly when I use pistons
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:42:57 They glitch back and sometimes kick me from the server with the client behaviour error message
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:43:59 I've seen that too

I think the only reason  why I get the kicked message is because I use so many pistons and it breaks stuff
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:44:07 48 pistons in my plane rn
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:44:27 Rip

bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:46:45 In plane crazy it's possible to crash the server if the pistons glitch back enough
bug-reports 2022-10-09 14:46:52 (Tested it with a friend)

creations-chat 2022-10-11 09:31:59 <@901190057648603177>  the detail where the little turrets are is pretty decent

Id say (besides making tracks for that giant thing) you need to add more detail in the form of slight colour and material variations

Use material sparingly in conjunction with small details i.e. texturing a ladder or the wheels or something along those lines

Don't use it on a large flat surface and don't spam it everywhere otherwise it'll look messy

<@984694509772357662>  yes
creations-chat 2022-10-15 01:09:27 by your logic the f-35 is a one wide (it is 15m long)

And the f22 (19m long)
creations-chat 2022-10-15 01:12:12 you might as well just include a mfing flanker at 22m long

1 wide is an overreaction to a small scale disparity

YT vip servers are generally bad
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:42:16 are you standing up for 1 wide roscale jets
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:43:27 are you advocating for the concept of 1 wide builds being called roscaler
contest-chat 2022-10-17 13:44:18 lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:44:54 g o o d

plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:52:51 most shredder ball pilots I've sean are stupid and barely move
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:52:58 shredders are shit
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:53:31 that's what I'm saying
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:53:38 a good fighter can kill any shredder
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:54:18 a good fighter

one that is speedy, can manoeuvre quickly and the pilot can aim it properly
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:54:43 subjective but 1k+ is redundant when vsing shredder
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:55:05 I said redundant buddy
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:55:28 no dumbass runs away from a shredder in a straight line lmao
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:55:42 these guys are going so fast they can barely control it
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:56:21 what is your point? Fighter jets are clearly better
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:56:27 you keep switching sides
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:57:09 possible to kill meta shredders if you're gjsolo or something
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 13:57:56 other pvpers who kill other jets in pcmg wars would destroy the shitass shredders ez

plane-crazy 2022-10-17 14:01:13 instead of getting good and using a plane
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 14:01:26 most shredders are sitting ducks

general 2022-10-18 23:58:20 Oh ok
general 2022-10-18 23:58:27 maybe su34 was wider idk
plane-crazy 2022-10-18 23:59:45 They have more friction
general 2022-10-19 00:00:03 I know but im relating it to the fact my jet used boxness roscale and the nose is 3 wide

creations-chat 2022-10-24 21:59:46 <@652925710976942100>  that f14 looks wrong

why is there a random one block drop in the back (yes its wedges but that's not the point)

whats happened looks like the whole wing assembly was not angled down, so the fuselage wasn't angled down, which caused the gap

horizontal body proportions are slightly cooked

shame

plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:27:10 I can tell you that you are already off to a poor start

you have not angled the bottom of the nose, and the intake is supposed to be not angled

you need to angle the nose individually, not the entire assembly
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:27:35 also you have made the thing too tall
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:28:07 do blueprint overlays dammit!

plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:28:39 shame :c
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:29:25 you have to angle the nose
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:29:47 I'm sure none of you are doing overlay properly
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:29:59 there's a million things u have to ensure are right before u get it good
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:30:20 like you need to scale when resizing the images and you need to align the horizontal and vertical views in length
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:30:47 view in the very rear and very front is bad bc roblox fov so u need to do custom overlays or mod it
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:31:06 genius i know all this bro
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:31:11 I've done it a billion times
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:31:38 you need them to actually get an accurate plane

plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:32:04 buddy how many jets have you seen with shitass proportions because they either didn't do overlay or didn't do it properly
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:32:29 its like almost no one knows how to *properly* do overlays
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:32:46 they relied too hard on them and never stopped to use their eyes
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:33:29 show your best plane
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:33:42 and I'll see if the proportions are good or not
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:36:40 looks alright to me

not sure if the canopy is too tall but I don't do f-14s
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:37:19 the point is for most people they need blueprint overlay for rough guidance
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:37:34 the photo angles don't show that
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:38:16 I made an su34 and i used blueprints for the nose but I had to modify it to make it look normal

the point of a blueprint is to stop massive proportion errors from materialising
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:38:29 not necessarily to get the fine details
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 02:39:01 for literally any noob 💀

plane-crazy 2022-10-29 05:20:26 spawn it in
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 05:24:58 well my opinion is that it looks terrible
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 05:26:37 1. What even is that nose
2. That spine is disgusting
3. What are those wings
4. The bottom of the intakes makes it look like its obese as fuck
5. You used namnam tut

so yes, it looks like shit
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 05:27:37 restart but use a different save slot
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 05:27:40 and take your time with it
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 05:27:47 don't rush it in a day or so
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 05:27:55 because it'll still end up looking the same
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 05:28:13 use motor and angle lock
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 05:28:41 no idea
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 05:28:43 what plane is it
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 05:29:32 id say don't do freebuilds
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 05:29:36 especially as a noob
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 05:29:44 since you will have no sense for what looks good
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 05:30:06 try an easy real plane like an f-4 phantom or something boxy like that
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 05:30:12 and come back and ask for feedback
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 05:31:00 also do blueprint overlays, they will help you with ur proportions
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 05:31:07 I'll dm you a full tutorial of it

creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:37:01 fix the back engine bit (its not supposed to jump up that far), fix the nose (too short) fix the fuselage (too thin), fix the intakes (too short bc fuselage too thin)

bad
creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:39:05 your choice mr noob
plane-crazy 2022-10-29 23:39:54 mayonnaise and blood camo
creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:41:34 people like you is the reason people like mr noob stay noob and don't get better

you stop them from seeing the negatives of their build and hence what they can do to make it better

you are facilitating stagnation of skill
creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:44:28 There is a difference between being polite and calling bad builds "good"

Countless people here have been encouraged to build better with every iteration, myself included

nobody's going to coddle anybody in the real world

Take criticism, cut out the unhelpful parts and make something useful out of it
creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:48:53 Encouraging someone to change nothing about what they did?

The problem is with most people now is that everybody is full of praise and is scared to offer criticism. Criticism is a reality and nobody can avoid it.

I gave him points to improve in his plane, whereas you did not

On top of that, people need to learn to handle criticism

Everyone here is a teenager who should be mentally flexible enough to do so
creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:51:04 If they are too young, they shouldn't be here anyway

If they are too old, their minds should be developed already

creations-chat 2022-10-30 00:02:25 Stfu buddy, "Mr noob" is ridiculous, you're seriously getting upset over that?

If I really wanted to put someone down I'd do much worse
creations-chat 2022-10-30 00:04:52 the whole point is that the name is ridiculous lmfao

it's not for people to get angry over 💀

Deal with it
creations-chat 2022-10-30 00:07:25 So Mr noob is now triggered because I called him something that's arguably harmless and carries no meaning by itself

creations-chat 2022-11-20 04:40:36 the wheel is there because a double-bogey system exists on the real plane that is basically impossible to attractively recreate ingame

so one wheel is hidden in the landing gear sheath and the other remains exposed

creations-chat 2022-11-20 04:43:21 yeah, one wheel is hidden in that sheath and the other remains exposed since I can't hide it nicely

plane-crazy 2022-11-22 21:54:14 try it on a new plane later or something

creations-chat 2022-12-29 06:30:40 id say the biggest reason is that its one wide

apply that skill onto a proper two wide and youll get a good ratio

also this side profile is cancerous 

try experimenting with blueprint overlays
creations-chat 2022-12-29 06:34:18 it's mostly proportion issues with the side profile as well as the "neck" of the aircraft being about one block too short as well. If you want a full tutorial for how to do blueprint overlays you can dm me

<@705816374462906389>  1 wide worse than 2 wide in most circumstances <:clueless:942802644043464734>

big pvp planes shot by one missile tend to lose a lot of functionality

so its best being as unhittable as possible

like a super annoying fly rather than a big lumbering moth
creations-chat 2022-12-31 08:01:10 when a plane gets that big it tends to stop being a proper pvp plane and more like a bullet sponge

creations-chat 2023-01-02 07:30:14 1x1 is good for pvp jets but if ur gonna make a proper build use a bigger scale

<@900649045813493810>  need decals and paint variation smh

there's a one wide f18 that looks good bc of decals and good scaling
creations-chat 2023-01-02 07:33:03 yes

and 2 wide builds tend to be more complex and more visually appealing

logic scales with ships that have high levels of detail

creations-chat 2023-01-02 10:27:44 Yes it looks a bit less plain now

Now fix the cockpit, currently it arches forward a bit too much, lessen the arch and bring the peak a bit further back

And while you're at it turn it into glass and make cockpit frames
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 10:33:38 that edit tho 🤣

if they are done well, they're good

however the same people that make one wides tend to also be the ones that don't put enough effort into it, leaving it plain and blocky

good one wides do exist, however they have the level of detail that a 2-wide plane necessitates for its design
plane-crazy 2023-01-02 11:11:41 the nose should not droop like that

Jk
creations-chat 2023-01-04 14:02:46 you are correct, it is a monstrosity
creations-chat 2023-01-04 14:04:52 it looks nothing like an f4
creations-chat 2023-01-05 08:59:15 the headass rafale nose cant be done perfectly

you might need to do the angled wing panel one or just do a vulpen and ignore the cone shape entirely
creations-chat 2023-01-05 10:50:10 How many pistons and motors did it take?

creations-chat 2023-01-11 10:22:08 In short - learn how to do blueprint overlays

proportions issues are all over this plane
creations-chat 2023-01-12 08:43:40 i wouldn't call it "bad" but the contour of the black part over the cockpit is wrong and the bottom of the intakes is much flatter on the irl 35
creations-chat 2023-01-12 11:29:51 we can see it smh justneut 🗿
creations-chat 2023-01-13 08:49:51 my friend is addicted to that game

creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:04:35 jealousy plain and simple
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:07:16 furry!??!? Explains the attitude smh
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:17:02 effort is there but proportions are super fucked up
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:12:56 restart (use 2 wide and use blueprints and dont use cylinders because the cockpit is not shaped appropriately for them)
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:14:05 
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:14:14 use blueprint overlays
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:14:16 they help
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:14:29 one sec
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:14:44 Full tutorial

Go to www.photopea.com (you can use others but I will use this one for the sake of demonstration)

1. Press "New Project"

2. Set resolution to desired one (not required) and then press "Create"

3. Open an image of your blueprint (use "edit" --> "transform" --> "scale" and resize it

4. Create a new layer and place it on top of the layer you have your blueprint on (Go to "Layer" --> "New" --> "Layer)

Your new layer should be visible on the right hand side of the screen in the layers panel

5. Select your new layer (name is default "Layer 1", change opacity to 50% (this setting is visible directly above your layers)

6. Insert an image of your plane and go "edit" --> "transform" --> "scale" to resize it and "edit" --> "transform" --> "rotate" to rotate it

7. Enjoy
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:15:05 I can already judge by that that its already out of proportion
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:15:34 people use different methods
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:15:38 I use paint.net personally
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:16:55 im shit at eyeballing :c
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:17:15 shard
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:17:24 ye ppl use paint3d too
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:17:30 its really a matter of preference
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:19:31 i changed my identity
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:19:55 ye but i abuse pistons for them
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:20:45 ima be honest, ive never built a proper heli in my life
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:20:47 but yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:20:52 tail might need it
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:20:55 and engine area
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:21:38 I think you could
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:21:43 Although the angles are really weird there
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:22:07 for nosecones people normally use pontoons iirc
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:22:29 and round wedges
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:22:37 Oh rip
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:22:51 ye wtf is that
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:23:11 do u mean magnets
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:23:29 f
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:23:48 yea
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:24:29 looks like a pebble
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:24:52 so its not really practical to use cylinders for the actual fuselage
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:25:00 Oh ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:25:20 
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:25:38 i can kinda see how thatd work
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:26:26 tbh thats the main reason i was putting off building a heli
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:26:28 the funny nosecones
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:27:05 I suppose youd have to use a lot of half cylinders and some funny locking
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:27:24 
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:30:06 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:31:06 mhm
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:31:17 its got so many angles which makes it really strange to build
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:32:06 Lmao
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:32:10 Yeah true
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:32:24 Btw do you know of a proper way to seriously cut down on piston use
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:32:28 It's the worst thing in a build
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:32:59 j
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:33:20 hmm alr
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:33:25 Basically just decomplicating
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:33:38 yea
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:34:11 Alright
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:34:14 See you later
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:35:00 rip
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:35:46 yea, it would def take a while
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:35:57 Id say try it though, no harm in doing that
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:36:22 ah true
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:36:32 Yeah
creations-chat 2023-01-27 01:37:38 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:37:49 mhm
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:38:01 Very cylindery
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:38:51 true
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:39:13 Pro camos aren't particularly compatible with cylinders <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:39:20 Otherwise id have already put the blue camo on my su34
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:39:50 The wings and nose make up for the lack of space
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:40:56 The way sr did it still looks good so yeah that could work
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:41:10 never heard of that ever tbh
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:41:48 Is that the same as that new type of angle lock summitbuilds put on yt?
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:42:03 Ah alr
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:42:08 well motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:42:17 The one advertised as "good for nosecones"?
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:42:41 Alr
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:42:59 Upgrade to magnet lock 😎
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:43:35 ah ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:43:43 I was thinking like 3 block wide roscale 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:44:20 Makes sense bc of its configuration
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:44:22 Alr
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:44:58 Alr
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 01:45:15 oke

plane-crazy 2023-01-27 02:20:23 hi again
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 02:20:55 first thought would be locking half cylinders or pontoon-like blocks into the gaps
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 02:21:46 pontoons #1 but u don't have them rip
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 02:21:53 I just mean pontoons
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 02:22:18 possibly try round wedges or half cylinders
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 02:22:41 ye that makes it hard
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 02:23:22 yeah u could

either way its pretty nice so gj there
creations-chat 2023-02-03 04:39:40 I went and had a look on the internet, the su25 UB has the funny cockpit that makes it look like the yak 130, and the 25 also has a really wide wingspan to fuselage ratio so I think its fine

general 2023-04-22 04:29:42 okey
general 2023-04-22 04:31:37 well

1. Don't go overboard
2. Use pistons and motors (but try and minimise the use since it'll end up like my plane) (unspawnable)
3. Use 1.5x intakes 
4. use a slightly larger scale so u don't need to do 1.5x engines that require tons of magnet lock
5. If u fuck up spine u fuck up entire plane
general 2023-04-22 04:35:35 ok

creations-chat 2023-05-03 22:52:48 1. Don't post it in creations (it is invariably shit)

2. send build here and actually take feedback but don't start arguments with ppl

3. If u argue u lose automatically

<@577227002759741463>
creations-chat 2023-05-03 22:56:16 usually over there noobs give feedback to other noobs, so u don't get better while u think ur good

help 2023-07-09 14:22:06 make a v2 and actually spend a good about of time on it and try to improve

im talking over a week on and off

if u wanna get good at building u don't just blindly do the same thing over and over, u make an effort to change things

for example you could do a motor angled bow and details, those help a ton but take a while to get right

also do small things with decals, low level details help a ton with immersion as well

general 2023-07-13 08:13:31 all private jet noses seem to be the same
creations-chat 2023-07-13 08:56:49 depends on what weapons ur using but probably 1 wide for one missile (custom or default)

if there's 2 missiles next to each other, 2 wide

you could probably piston lock stuff closer together if theres not enough space
general 2023-07-13 09:21:19 something gives me the feeling that will look incredibly messy unless you angle lock everything so it's in clear stripes
general 2023-07-13 09:32:32 i know but i'm assuming you're going to build it in the game
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 10:48:26 u aren't gonna get inventor

plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:30:36 and also aim since people with super fast manoeuvrable jets nearly always cannot aim
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:30:56 whenever some guy gets mad and spawns a plane that goes 15k speed i just ignore it since i know he can't hit me anyway lmao
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:31:10 i generally don't have issues shooting down jets in pvp

plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:32:10 it's not hard if you have an alright jet and decent aim
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:32:22 jet doesnt even have to look that good as long as you can move it and aim it
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 11:32:35 same

creations-chat 2023-07-14 12:56:32 well it depends on scale but you generally start with length and make it appropriately tall as you go

u gotta search up the height and length of the boat and then use some maths to see how tall the scaled down version will be given a specific block length and that gives u the general height figure

help 2023-07-18 07:31:20 wing shape and fix fuselage pinch
help 2023-07-18 07:33:44 wings too wide remove the edge by one block

also is it just the camera angle or is the plane asymmetrical
help 2023-07-18 08:03:48 yeah I'd have angle locked the leading wing edge but if u don't want to do it just go back to how it was before
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:20:11 Typical crying lowranks
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:20:47 And if they want to prove a point  against some better builder they always go for builds from 2022 or earlier
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:20:51 Like how dumb can they be
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:21:11 💀💀
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:21:44 yeah keep crying

Most people can see past detail spam and that's when you get builds above 200 upvotes
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:22:54 dumbass that's from 2021 and very good for its time

it is in hof for a reason

You should've seen the state of building in that year
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:23:24 you really cannot speak
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:24:40 You do realise detailing is nearly as equal a part in a build as the shape itself
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:24:58 If you're gonna make an artwork you don't just stop at the canvas
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:25:13 <:noway:1021283202561744977> <:noway:1021283202561744977>
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:27:14 If you're gonna detail blank plates on a plane you use text blocks to add pictures and stuff

Again, what's the point making an artwork if ur just gonna stop at the canvas
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:27:38 Its like calling art sponge use invalid cause it's "the wrong kind of detail" 💀💀
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:27:48 like what??
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:30:00 you're like a motorlock rejector wtf lmao

This is in the game for a reason and people use it to add smaller details u can't do with just blocks
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:30:11 💀💀
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:30:17 How are you unable to see that

plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:31:10 you are in no position to comment how a build looks

plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:31:21 2021
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:31:56 He must be a newgen or something I've never seen someone that oblivious to how build quality went over time
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:33:20 its not great by modern standards but back then people were making shit with only blocks and no wedges
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:33:55 Its like comparing a 1990s pc to 2020s pc and saying the specs are incredibly trash
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:34:01 You missed my point
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:34:31 reread
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:34:52 what im saying is back then average build quality was way worse so that one was insane by comparison
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:35:09 cylinders n stuff to fill gaps

creations-chat 2023-07-18 09:39:30 oh so you mean contest

either way it looks deathly white to me so you'd benefit from  making it a bit darker and doing some paint weathering and texture changes in areas
creations-chat 2023-07-18 09:48:57 Im not talking about that much darker im talking about darker tones of the white to make it look like an actual thing and not a plastic toy

No ship in real life is perfectly snow white, it's got colour variation to it that you need to filter out of its surroundings
