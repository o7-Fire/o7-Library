creations-chat 2021-07-18 18:30:55 That was not a very good picture cause I didn't angle everything properly I'll send a picture with my best try with the angles
creations-chat 2021-07-18 19:00:02 Yes but if I fill the gaps it's going to become mega lag and even more of a pain to angle
creations-chat 2021-07-18 19:05:57 Side note: even though there were tiny arguments in this chat this is a lot less toxic than usual
creations-chat 2021-07-18 23:24:30 Hull is done , feedback? T-55
