plane-crazy 2021-12-06 04:29:48 Can someone teach me the basics of merging?
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 04:30:07 Uhh… yes?
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 04:30:27 A friend got me into this game because he dsid it had a similar mechanic an old game used to
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 04:30:43 And we called it merging… where we used motors to “merge” blcoks together
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 04:30:59 Does motor locking merge blocks be
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 04:31:07 Ahh oke
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 04:31:13 How do you do it?
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 04:31:30 Because I was an expert at the other game, and if it’s a similar technique I should excel here
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 04:32:26 Do you set the angle?
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 04:32:38 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 04:32:59 I’ll prolly start with simple stuff to get my bearings
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 04:33:04 Is there a video tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 04:33:58 In the old game I played I basically helped refine serial merge, which is like series locking here I suppose
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 04:34:27 Also, I specialize in naval design
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 04:44:16 I think I’ll start on ships as a good place
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 04:44:31 The scale will be bigger, so I won’t have to have compact motor locking
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 04:53:38 I don’t know anything about anything
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 04:53:52 All’s I know is I know a literal shit load about naval vessels
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 04:54:07 Modern and vintage ships
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 05:00:14 Basically… ships seems easy enough
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 05:00:20 Balancing won’t be too hard
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 05:01:14 I just wanna get basics down
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 05:01:47 Prolly
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 05:02:17 I’ve done it in games with dog shit physics engines
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 05:02:31 Ships are where I do extremely well
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 05:02:58 How do you start in water tho
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 05:03:09 Because if you test drive in the regular place…
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 05:17:14 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 05:19:55 This game has a massive learning curve
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 05:20:04 It ain’t optimized for mobile
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 05:21:14 It seems doable tho
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 05:21:56 In all honesty I’m not sure my phone can even support some of the things I’d like to make
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 05:22:14 I was going to post a pic of something I wanted to remake but Idk how
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 05:22:38 Because the game I used to play quite literally died
plane-crazy 2021-12-06 05:24:22 Txt wall
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:10:22 Folding
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:10:26 Can someone teach me how
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:12:39 Is folding easy?
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:13:54 I’m about to make a frigate
plane-crazy 2021-12-11 02:13:59 So that’s why I wanna learn
