plane-crazy 2022-12-15 18:49:59 How can I make a 1x2 triangle half wedge?
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 18:50:27 I'm making a fighter jet and it has a 1x2 wedge in front
general 2022-12-15 18:50:52 How can I make a 1x2 triangle half wedge?
general 2022-12-15 18:51:22 I saw it in a video
general 2022-12-15 18:51:42 I did not base it but I saw how they made the canopy of the f 4
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 20:17:57 I have a 1x2 wedge on the canopy
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 20:18:13 Could you make a 1x2 triangle?
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 20:19:03 I did not base it on this but how is it?

creations-chat 2023-03-11 01:19:48 How it looks, I keep making corrections 
(I appreciate your opinions and suggestions)
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 23:41:36 As it looks, I will make a correction to that part where there is a hole
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 23:43:06 What plane do you think it is?
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 23:43:30 F 5

plane-crazy 2023-03-11 23:45:09 Very fat don't you think
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 23:45:35 compare it with the real model I have had problems with my prototype for that reason
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 23:45:56 how it looks
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 23:46:02 mine
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 23:47:44 canadian
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 23:48:30 I like this livery
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 23:49:47 but i will use this
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 23:51:20 reminds me of the f8 crusader
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 23:53:09 In my country, combat planes fly unarmed
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 23:53:25 Which brings me to the next question... Why?
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 23:53:48 Nothing but it is a random question that I asked myself
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 23:54:42 They only put them together for exhibitions
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 23:55:19 They apparently fly on patrol and are unarmed.
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 23:56:41 XD
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 23:56:58 And there it is clearly seen how they are unarmed
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 23:57:56 no weapons
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:00:38 it's just an f 5
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:00:51 It is not uncommon to see those old people fly
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:01:21 not in their countries
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:02:03 yea
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:05:32 Why HD?
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:05:43 I like those random letters
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:05:54 Especially when it's OF
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:06:05 or OK
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:06:17 Yes I think it's from the base
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:06:34 Those with OF come from Offut?
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:06:41 Offut AFB?
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:07:09 It is curious because the RC 135 have OF and are not in offout
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:08:12 f 6F
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:08:39 
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:09:39 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:10:29 It is true that the b 52 will be in service until 2050
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:11:23 I wonder what that old man is going to do in 2050
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:11:37 They love b-52
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:12:18 B2 will die first
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:13:13 and never used
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:13:46 I do not support violence or mass destruction but several countries were bombed and the b 2 did not enter that much
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:29:01 i was trying to do that
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:29:29 it was only a prototype
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:30:03 it was 1x2
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:30:15 not 1x1
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:30:26 I am 4 blocks less long
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:30:27 or 2
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:30:59 So I started to think and came back to the same problem...
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 00:31:24 There is no half wedge triangle 1x2
creations-chat 2023-03-12 06:56:05 Hi... I was experimenting looking to remove the motor lock below. I had already thought about this before that moving the motor further away changes the angle and it did and it doesn't stay the same anymore it wasn't what I was looking for but I guess it looks better
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 07:17:57 prototype 1 or prototype 2 ignore the angles of the canopy and the tip of the nose I try to fix that but there is a change between both
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 07:25:01 The first one looks more like a t 38
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 07:52:37 Nice
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 07:52:43 Bad?
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 07:53:06 Looks great
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 19:25:53 <:Upvote:490311647492309004> I couldn't apply a correction there... I tried with delta wings and others and it didn't look good
creations-chat 2023-03-14 01:33:11 Does it look good compared to the real model?
creations-chat 2023-03-14 01:35:16 Maybe if I reduce where it goes down?
creations-chat 2023-03-14 01:37:20 I see the height quite well and the nose too, the only thing I need to fix is ​​that
creations-chat 2023-03-14 02:14:59 Yes I will try. Any other suggestions?
creations-chat 2023-03-17 00:42:11 how it looks I have remodeled the canopy
creations-chat 2023-03-17 02:09:37 What is the point of this? I had an f 5 that I added doors to the front to make the gun bay it was literally square
creations-chat 2023-03-17 02:14:51 The lines must be very thin... I'll try
creations-chat 2023-03-17 02:25:26 yes... I have never worked with trails, rather I have not experienced it, to avoid doing this a month ago I tried to make a helicopter and the result was not bad but it is difficult for me to adjust all the trails to the angle of the circle, ( 
and if you use half cylinder blocks )
creations-chat 2023-03-17 02:31:55 what do you say about that?
creations-chat 2023-03-17 02:35:05 which parts look smooth
creations-chat 2023-03-17 02:46:35 that was his destiny from the beginning it was just to experiment
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:18:04 Those green or gray colors?
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:42:31 How does it look?
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:42:56 I try to delete the line...
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:43:27

plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:52:10 I haven't done it in days
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:52:20 also I go slowly
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:52:55 has some pending corrections
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:53:37 june

plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:53:43 isthelimit
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:54:21 OK
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:54:37 until then i will have the air intakes
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:54:55 it is very unstable
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:55:37 scale
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:56:13 I don't really believe the plans either
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:56:50 but I think they will bring me a good final result
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:57:17 I had something similar
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:58:33 
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:59:01 also the cockpit was longer
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 00:59:34 For the sake of the nose, the canopy could not be lengthened
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 01:00:37 and how does the camouflage look?
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 01:01:13 I only have two prototypes of camo
creations-chat 2023-04-08 23:52:18 Propellers?
creations-chat 2023-04-09 20:18:29 I have stretched the canopy more, ¿How does it look?
creations-chat 2023-04-09 20:22:44 It has a fuel tank below, don't expect much, also with the load it won't look as high anymore I guess 
If possible, I'll lower it a bit, it's the least of it
creations-chat 2023-04-09 21:03:27 Do you think that being able to use that one, I would have chosen a more complex one? It is the same but it affects him cosmetically I suppose it is the same height 
Also, I can't create a compartment because even creating it, the wheel looks like this is better in all respects, it doesn't matter
creations-chat 2023-04-09 21:05:32 And it looks small from other angles, 
Can't be smaller...
creations-chat 2023-04-09 21:09:19 I was about to delete this but decided to try again making it longer and it was very easy but it looks weird from some angles. When I was using the scale model, it looked very similar now, not quite, but it's longer. and it looks better the angle of the camera also influences The second image shows the size well
creations-chat 2023-04-09 21:25:28 F-5E TIGER II
creations-chat 2023-04-09 21:30:34 If we compare it with the real model it looks like this... I had to scale it a bit to make it fit, I guess that depends on the distance from the camera
plane-crazy 2023-05-04 00:58:19 Trying to make F/A 18 Nose
plane-crazy 2023-05-04 01:54:37 How it looks? The last part where you see a motor lock doesn't count, that's where the canopy starts
plane-crazy 2023-05-04 01:55:15 Test
plane-crazy 2023-05-04 01:56:28 In creations not in the other channels it is possible
plane-crazy 2023-05-05 17:33:33 How could I make a perfect sphere like for a death star?
plane-crazy 2023-05-05 17:33:56 with wedges it looks like a diamond
general 2023-05-05 17:35:27 How could I make a perfect sphere like for a death star?
general 2023-05-05 17:39:04 Rather, it should be as perfect as possible like the ones shown here because it comes out in a diamond shape to me
plane-crazy 2023-05-05 17:40:47 
plane-crazy 2023-05-05 17:40:51 like this
plane-crazy 2023-05-05 17:41:14 but how many blocks should
plane-crazy 2023-05-05 17:41:24 I guess I should follow a sequence
plane-crazy 2023-05-05 17:42:27 I won't do it
plane-crazy 2023-05-05 17:42:38 but with how many blocks could I start
plane-crazy 2023-05-05 17:42:48 And what sequence will I follow?
plane-crazy 2023-05-12 02:59:16 How can I make a perfect Windshield from a normal wedge?
plane-crazy 2023-05-12 02:59:46 I was able to make one with a 1x2 wedge but not a 1x1 wedge
creations-chat 2023-05-12 20:25:34 Bruh
creations-chat 2023-05-12 20:37:28 Yea
creations-chat 2023-05-12 20:39:35 I didn't understand
creations-chat 2023-05-12 20:43:37 We have a different thought. I think the RC-135W/V is better because of its nose... I like long-nosed planes like the MC-130
creations-chat 2023-05-12 20:51:24 It is not beautiful?
creations-chat 2023-05-12 20:53:58 That one looks ugly, I like the Original EC-135 better
plane-crazy 2023-05-12 23:11:58 The door near the cockpit has a ladder I guess like the c 130
