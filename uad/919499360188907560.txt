The Tale of watsmyu (919499360188907560)
general 2022-11-13 13:25:21 I only joined because i heard of a battle bot event with controversial rules
general 2022-11-13 13:26:14 Mind if i have a short and sweet explanation of the battle bot event?
general 2022-11-13 13:27:31 ....
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:28:47 WHY CAN I NOT POST MY 
BOT?!
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:30:14 i have 10 entire accounts dedicated to robot combat plane crazy builds
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:30:39 I EVEN OWN A SERVER FOR THE ROBOT COMBAT COMMUNITY THAT PLAYS PLANE CRAZY
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:31:36 Cant send proof without perms to send images
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:34:03 There
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:34:45 My only problem is that my device sucks
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:35:06 I DID
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:35:39 I SENT THEM
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:36:05 need more proof?
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:38:07 Im so irritated that i cant post images here
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:38:28 HO w
general 2022-11-13 13:40:37 I have absolutely no idea whats going in or whys going on
general 2022-11-13 13:40:44 All i know and love is robot combat
general 2022-11-13 13:41:04 I already have no sanity
general 2022-11-13 13:41:38 True!
general 2022-11-13 13:42:18 However i need to level up because i have at least 10 possible bot entries
general 2022-11-13 13:42:58 True!
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:43:18 Red devil, cause m
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:43:50 Valkyrie is good as well but red devil takes more talent to drive
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:43:59 Anyway
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:44:15 Time to put in my complaints about the rules
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:44:45 why the heck do they ignore the existence of Gearing?
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:45:06 There are many types of gearing
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:45:23 Well, types of gearing for spinners
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:46:26 There is Piston Gearing(banned), Motor Lock Gearing, Hybrid Gearing(banned), and the one thats most deadly for THIS event, Stutter Gearing
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:47:32 Motor Lock gearing isnt deadly because of torque limit
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:48:02 Stutter Gearing requires a Half 5√ó5 cylinder and a Friction Block
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:50:17 Ill send an example to you soon
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:52:16 Its called _***Stutter***_ Gearing for a reason
events-chat 2022-11-13 13:55:50 Yes, but who said i wanted to win? I want to make it FUN
general 2022-11-14 22:35:49 ü•ö
general 2022-11-15 07:02:19 I regret coming back here because the first thing i see is a soulless stare of a freaking psychopathic emoji
general 2022-11-15 07:02:39 Its surprising cuz i also see one when i look in a mirror
general 2022-11-25 18:12:38 hehehe weenoor
general 2022-11-25 18:13:28 Im also a furry and im curious what the hell is going on
general 2022-11-25 18:14:23 Im also curious why does this server hate builds that have no motor lock?
general 2022-11-25 18:15:33 What if it's built by a new player?
general 2022-11-25 18:16:40 And not to mention that in robot combat, less complex= less chance of failure
general 2022-11-25 18:16:59 Also, ive seen builds that are high effort without motor lock
general 2022-11-25 18:17:19 Like my friend IB's animatronic build
general 2022-11-25 18:17:47 I realize
general 2022-11-25 18:18:22 As there are still a ton of people with builds of weenors flying around
general 2022-11-25 18:19:06 So anyway
general 2022-11-25 18:19:18 I like all cats
general 2022-11-25 18:19:24 All are cute and fluffy
general 2022-11-25 18:19:31 And portable
general 2022-11-25 18:20:13 I set my cat as my pfp as its the cat i see the most
general 2022-11-25 18:20:33 YES
general 2022-11-25 18:21:04 IM DOWNLOADING THAT AND MAKING IT HAVE NO BACKGROUND
general 2022-11-25 18:21:57 Your definition of degenerate?
general 2022-11-25 18:24:16 Did you miss what i said earlier
general 2022-11-25 18:24:39 Ahem
general 2022-11-25 18:24:43 No
general 2022-11-25 18:24:48 I just like cats
general 2022-11-25 18:25:15 so what is your definition of furry?
general 2022-11-25 18:25:47 We have a different definition of furry
general 2022-11-25 18:27:26 A furry is a term used to describe a person who likes the idea of an anthropomorphic animal, being an animal with human character traits (Bipedal, emotions, and speaking human languages)
general 2022-11-25 18:28:25 I finished my own definition
general 2022-11-25 18:28:43 Undeestandable
general 2022-11-25 18:29:40 Also how do I send images on other channels?
general 2022-11-25 18:29:49 What do i have to do
general 2022-11-25 18:29:53 Level up?
general 2022-11-25 18:30:55 What the hell
general 2022-11-25 18:31:25 Same
general 2022-11-25 18:32:25 Lol
general 2022-11-25 18:32:50 who
general 2022-11-25 18:33:49 Hot
general 2022-11-25 18:34:06 Rip
general 2022-11-25 18:34:24 Too much buff men?
general 2022-11-25 18:34:46 Buff women?
general 2022-11-25 18:35:14 Oh damn your right
general 2022-11-25 18:35:51 Agreed
general 2022-11-25 18:37:12 Lol the 621 site is a bad word
general 2022-11-25 18:37:53 You are an innocent soul
general 2022-11-25 18:39:05 Which one are we talking about?
general 2022-11-25 18:39:14 34 or 621?
general 2022-11-25 18:39:50 Because i live in a basement
general 2022-11-25 18:40:13 Yes
general 2022-11-25 18:40:40 Your just now realizing that?
general 2022-11-25 18:41:17 Oh let me guess, nsfw?
general 2022-11-25 18:42:43 So im not a furry?
general 2022-11-25 18:43:02 3 and 4
general 2022-11-25 18:44:05 I am a furry
general 2022-11-25 18:45:27 YOU LIKE CARDBOARD TOO?!
general 2022-11-25 18:46:01 WHAT THATS BEAUTIFUL
general 2022-11-25 18:46:59 I check out for all of those besides "Not A Furry"
general 2022-11-25 18:47:27 But unlike your definition of a furry, i dont act like an animal or a robotic one.
general 2022-11-25 18:48:22 So based on your criteria for a furry, im not a furry
general 2022-11-25 18:49:43 So essentially, i check out for all of those if you are going off your definition of a furry
general 2022-11-25 18:50:58 Not as much as real nsfw content
general 2022-11-25 18:51:21 Yes and no
general 2022-11-25 18:52:16 I didnt plan on it
general 2022-11-25 18:53:17 Stating your taste in nsfw in a server full of minors is a one way trip for getting banned
general 2022-11-25 18:53:56 Thats why I wont mention the content i watch at midnight
general 2022-11-25 18:56:11 _***and here you'll see the dumpster fire that is <#497142796961054721> for a populated discord server, arguments are constant like a flowing water on a river***_
