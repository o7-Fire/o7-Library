plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:45:07 Why do people get so mad when you use tutorials, it would be like getting mad at someone for listening to music they didnt make themself.
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:46:19 Plus it's good for learning, obviously dont stick to tutorials forever but it's how I learnt what motorlocks are
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:47:02 That's what I'm saying lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:48:16 Alot of the time I look at tutorials so I can learn new buliding techniques
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:49:25 Ofc
plane-crazy 2022-05-10 22:49:58 But tutorials should be treated as a tool when used correctly
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 18:19:15 Why are explosive blocks so delayed
bug-reports 2022-05-12 15:46:22 Explosive blocks are always like a foot behind where you hit something, so if you hit something moving fast on it's back then it wont take any damage. I know this is a lag thing but there probably is a fix
