plane-crazy 2019-02-25 08:51:42 USS Hornet?
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 09:39:22 Is making a tank with an oscillating turret possible? Like the turret on the AMX 13 90.
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 09:39:44 Hold on
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 09:40:46 
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 09:40:52 Like that
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 09:43:09 I can make the oscillating turret, but i cant seem to put it on a tank chassis
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 09:46:21 And a motor to rotate the turret
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 09:51:31 Im not an expert on swedish tanks, but ok
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 10:16:56 What the hell is that on the far right?
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 10:18:47 I have a bad feeling on the tab on the far right
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 10:22:25 <:GWlulurdWaitWhat:402868030918492160>
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 10:23:01 i can see the attention to detail on that
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 11:01:06 That's alot of ropes
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 12:12:35 Are hydraulics possible like the one on the Stridsvagn 103
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 12:25:43 it's just a wooden boat
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 12:37:45 how did you get those materials to build those in the middle of the sea
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 13:01:35 ok
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 13:41:22 You want to change the controls of the control panels?
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 13:51:17 That's a flat front turret
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 13:51:39 Reminds me of the Leopard 2A4
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 13:52:15 add suspension if you dont want your tank to get bumpy offroad
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 13:52:28 so crew comfort +1
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 14:00:11 fattus
plane-crazy 2019-02-25 14:00:13 maximus

plane-crazy 2019-02-27 07:35:35 Why tho?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 07:42:18 I see, but why not make it small or medium sized with some simplicity on it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 07:42:42 Like what new people to building games would do.
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 07:43:10 Well, I mean what about those who just doesnt want to make it shoot?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 07:43:27 Like people who adds cylinders then calls it a gun
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 07:44:29 who knows, he may have some secret mechanics or features in there
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 07:46:56 So it's not a tank
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 07:46:59 it's an IFV
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 07:47:57 <:thonk:509498568982134816>

plane-crazy 2019-02-27 07:49:57 Hold on
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 07:50:40 Oof, Im only wider by 2 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 07:51:41 Also I only have recently made my AMX
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 07:53:13 I just make my tanks simple
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 07:53:23 So I dont have to waste my time detailing the hell out of them
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 07:54:53 rip
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 08:43:27 I only joined the server a couple of days ago
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 08:43:28 So no

plane-crazy 2019-02-27 13:01:07 yes
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 13:11:38 spaced armor = op anti-heat shell armor which doesnt exist in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 13:17:55 By the way, how do i even make something turn on water?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 13:18:41 My creation is too heavy for the control panels to work
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 13:22:26 gg
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 13:22:26 Welp
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 13:22:30 some guy made me crash my game
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 13:24:02 It was some guy with a rather large ship, so eh
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 13:27:21 A jet engine on a motor works, I guess
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 13:38:56 <@456226577798135808> run, it's the police
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 13:39:32 <@456226577798135808> no

plane-crazy 2019-02-27 13:48:06 <@456226577798135808> It kind of looks too blue now though

plane-crazy 2019-02-27 14:00:25 It's also too bright
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 14:00:40 Im looking for the tank to look something like this
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 14:02:37 Yeah, no
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 14:02:49 my initial color looks better for me

plane-crazy 2019-02-28 08:05:39 Instead, why not I just slip into degeneracy and create something more horrendous?
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 08:06:51 Nah
plane-crazy 2019-02-28 08:06:56 I'll just go do something else

plane-crazy 2019-03-04 12:08:36 Though I do like simple builds that has nice mechanics in them
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 12:11:28 It's quite detailed
plane-crazy 2019-03-04 12:11:34 And no, it's not simple. What I mean is, something that looks simple but has quite the features
general 2019-03-06 04:08:39 Dont you love it when you just joined a roblox server and then the game immediately froze or crashes?

plane-crazy 2019-03-10 10:23:48 nyoom
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 10:35:55 delta wings are just square pixels that look like triangles
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 10:39:12 <@!486674992981999648> Do you actually see the black wings?
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 10:39:32 
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 10:39:56 It's pretty much almost invisble
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 10:40:02 But there are delta wings
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 10:40:07 Just look at the wings from below
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 10:42:20 i just make random stuffs that comes up to my mind
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 10:43:28 By the way, how do I make a hovering aircraft turn that has no wings?
plane-crazy 2019-03-10 10:43:36 Like a stable turn

plane-crazy 2019-03-10 11:02:16 rip
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 09:49:25 Where do i report creations that are inappropriate?
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 09:50:09 I dont have permissions lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 09:50:30 but what to do with this?
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 09:50:42 ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 13:14:02 Cant say for sure, it's just a ship hull
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 13:14:39 Looks decent enough, I'd give it a thumbs up.
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 13:15:08 same lol
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 13:16:14 Oh nice
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 13:16:34 I mean it's a patrol boat
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 13:16:35 So sure
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 13:16:38 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 13:17:03 Just make a small one and dont literally place a battleship turret onto it
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 13:23:59 Could probably be longer
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 13:25:44 It could fit 1-2 guns, not as much as other WW2 destroyers, but sure.
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 13:26:39 Whatever works for you, I guess.
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 13:29:07 Is the underbelly too large or is it fine?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 13:31:04 The saga of tanya the evil?

creations-chat 2019-07-21 11:33:55 A pretty much unpainted Me-262 (Not sure how to paint it), it goes about 470 SPS with 229 total brick count.

I had to figure out how to get around the problem of the plane being front heavy, about the engine not having any room for a closed top, and that I cant seem to put the elevators on the rudder
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:36:31 <@210141202698338304> Its not finished yet, but im taking suggestions
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:38:17 <@210141202698338304> Some guy suggested me to add that propellers so it looks like a jet engine
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:38:38 I did that
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:38:45 It looks pretty weird
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:39:37 I think I have a pic of it when it had actual jet engines
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:40:53 This was when it had actual jet engines <@210141202698338304>
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:41:35 Oh that
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:41:48 I think I might be able to do that
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:42:52 Might be hard though
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:43:08 Since something needs to carry all that weight
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:43:42 <@456226577798135808> I have no idea

plane-crazy 2019-07-22 11:28:50 <@456226577798135808> Should I paint it all grey?

plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:32:00 Not sure if I should post it here or in creations, but I'd like some feedback on what I should fix on this ship
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:32:38 lol
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:33:21 Anyways, is there anything that needs to be fixed on my ship?
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:34:18 It's half finished
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:35:18 So far, this is the amount I have finished
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:36:08 And elaborate on making it more realistic? <@!385411356708569090>
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:39:08 <@385411356708569090> The bridge or the hull?
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:39:29 <@456226577798135808> And yes, it is the Shimakaze
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:40:18 I do plan to make the hull higher because it keeps listing
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:40:39 <@456226577798135808> Hold on
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:41:58 Wouldn't this do? Its literally the pic of my shimakaze and you don't need to scroll far up <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:43:23 I question my decision to create this ship, its a lot larger in brick counts than my previous builds
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:43:25 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:43:48 Eh, its not as detailed as I wanted it to be
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:44:10 Who?
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:45:11 I think I started playing somewhere in late 2018
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:45:40 I might be wrong though
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:46:47 <@414778672847781888> sure
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:47:29 I demand that ship to have more dazzle camo
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:48:48 <@456226577798135808> I don't like building large builds
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 13:49:03 I kinda prefer them to be small
plane-crazy 2020-02-22 14:15:51 <@414778672847781888> Can I see how your gun looks?
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 00:05:35 Wait what? 201 blocks in length?
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 00:13:56 What should I improve on this?

plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:21:50 i demand feedback on something
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:23:31 a ship
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:23:34 a destroyer to be specific
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:23:48 i demand feedback on how i should paint it, and what needs to be fixed
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:24:12 kk
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:24:34 My first time making a ship this large, so idk what I need to fix
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:24:51 here's another angle
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:25:06 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:25:12 Here's the real ship
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:25:55 The deck?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:26:06 or the red paint on the hull?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:26:50 Mk
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:27:24 Should I make the hull and superstructure more darker so it looks like this?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:27:32 Mk, what details?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:28:29 I might have to fix the bow so it's a bit more rounder
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:29:03 Ah, those
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:29:05 Mk
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:29:59 Those details on the rear should be fine for me to make, the one on the bow is a bit difficult
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:30:46 Who?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:30:49 Me?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:31:19 I was here before the rank system was revised
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:31:42 And I got the microbuilder rank previously which is gone now
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:32:31 Oh, you mean this?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:33:07 I kinda forgot about it
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:33:36 The only attempts on a rank I requested was on my microplane
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:33:50 Probably got another rank because of the Me-262 I made a while back
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:34:00 Even so, I dont really remember
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:34:24 Im not too committed into this discord to even remember these kind of stuffs
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:40:07 The only big problem I have on the ship isn't the details
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:40:28 But it's seriously unstable since it's a long and narrow ship
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:41:10 Haven't, I did try using heliums so it doesn't fall on its side
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:41:32 I'll take note on that
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:41:45 Well I am new to shipbuilding lol
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:42:02 The only other ship I made was literally a small PT boat and a submarine
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:42:28 Wdym by fold?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:43:34 Oh, I did fold the ship
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:43:43 It was too long, so I had to make it into 2 sections
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:44:10 And I had no idea what pontoons were because I dont live in a country that primarily speaks english
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:46:13 Like this?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:47:03 If you're talking about that, I did fold it when making it since the ship was too long
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:48:29 But anyways, thanks for the feedback
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:51:54 Oh, then what is it?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:52:31 Im not well versed in this community, so grant me your wisdom
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 09:55:02 You mean this?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 10:32:28 Ah yes, the airbus species of birds
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:31:22 You need to make sure that the tail isnt connected to the main creation
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:31:45 Otherwise you'd have a motor that is trying to turn the entire creation
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:34:39 Are you sure its not connected?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:35:21 What about this?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:35:53 What about the blue stuffs next to it?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:35:56 Not the wings above it
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:37:04 Try deleting this one specific half block and try turning
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:38:09 Ah, I see the problem
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:38:16 It's those delta wings
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:39:08 Are they connected?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:39:18 If they are, then that's the problem
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:39:51 If not, try deleting that one specific blue half block I mentioned earlier
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:40:06 Hm, why not try deleting that one specific half block I mentioned?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:41:05 This person cant seem to make his motor turn
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 11:41:24 Im not exactly sure why, since I haven't seen his entire build
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 12:00:28 I see why it doesnt turn now
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 12:04:45 Some of parts were still connected but it wasnt visible to the eye
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 12:05:43 I had to replicate the problem and managed to fix it by deleting the half blocks next to the wings and motor and the half wedge 2 that was under the 2nd motor
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 12:16:35 Basically these circled blocks are the main culprit, though the orange one isn't the main problem to it
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 12:17:47 The half wedge 2 encircled in red apparently made the motor on the rudder attached to the plane, while the half blocks shown in green is still stuck to the tail wing <@!488239293475586048>
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 12:18:34 Try deleting the blocks shown in green and red and if that still doesnt work, try deleting the ones in orange
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 12:29:06 It isnt really anything that reaches the level of genius lol
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 13:05:09 <@!421975189362966538> That's not the reason why it wouldn't turn
general 2020-02-24 13:09:43 hand
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 13:10:01 You mean half cylinders?
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 13:10:30 Because the tail wings wont be attached to the cylinders
plane-crazy 2020-02-24 13:10:42 Or the cylinders won't be attached to the motors
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:22:03 That happens
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:28:43 Very nice
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:28:51 Now make the gravity gun
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:31:11 Can it elevate with each wheel?
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:31:38 I use the magnet for movement for a non-engine aircraft <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:31:54 Its laggy and I dont know if it even works again
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:32:50 Compared to the other forms of engines I've used, the magnet engine is more efficient and accelerates seriously fast
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:33:42 Like you can get up to your top speed in just 1-2 seconds with a magnet
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:36:27 <@456226577798135808> I wonder if its possible to create levitating obbies with those levitation device you made
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:38:28 Hmm, he didnt make it despite being on his plot
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:38:37 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:39:50 How about a hover train or something?
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:42:44 Yeah, it'll probably be useful for like simulating space
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:43:54 No, like space
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:44:07 You never heard what outer space is?
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:44:18 The place where stuffs like rocks float?
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:44:44 I meant the blocks lmao
creations-chat 2020-02-27 16:45:06 Like simulating asteroid belts and stuffs

creations-chat 2020-03-07 17:42:42 What about the body?
creations-chat 2020-03-07 17:43:33 No, I mean like does the body move like a shark swimming?
creations-chat 2020-03-07 17:43:53 Like zig zagging or some sort
creations-chat 2020-03-07 17:47:25 Fairly stiff, but nice
creations-chat 2020-03-07 17:47:50 The only problem I have with the build is the tail design
creations-chat 2020-03-07 17:56:44 Tbh, it gives me those arcade tank game vibes
creations-chat 2020-03-07 18:04:59 If you remove the turret, it become the Goliath
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:15:11 It's the blocks underneath the motor
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:15:44 And did you make the motor keybinds the opposite to each other?
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:16:18 Like try making the left one F and R while the right one as R and F
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:17:05 You don't really need 2 motors for it to turn, but sure
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:17:34 Try changing the keybinds so they're the opposite of each other
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:17:55 Like the left one as F and R
The right one as R and F
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:18:32 Oh I see why it doesn't move
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:18:53 You have a motor underneath the turret that is connected to the hull
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:20:30 One way to fix your problem is to make an oscillating turret
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:21:15 Or just make the gun the thing that elevates and depress while the turret being the one that rotates
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:23:03 
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:25:13 That's the problem I noticed
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:25:46 Or make an oscillating turret
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 18:26:10 Though that's harder than the conventional design

general 2020-03-23 21:58:32 Ah yes, the limitations of game development
general 2020-03-23 21:58:56 Protagonist's cape

plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:30:06 i mean, how else would you do it? make it go backwards?
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:33:28 <@456226577798135808>Change the way those legs move, not by remaking the entire leg itself
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:33:54 Uh, motors

plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:34:41 Well, try it like that for starters and see if it works
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:36:02 Oh wait
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:36:28 Your legs basically dont allow for effective movement from that stiffness
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:36:36 And also design
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:39:27 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 05:39:59 I know how to answer, but I cant seem to get the right word for it

plane-crazy 2020-03-24 06:51:36 That model of the Panzer IV somehow reminds me of PlaneFreak's Panzers
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 06:55:25 And bad stuffs happened
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 06:55:50 It's not even half of the year yet and tons of things went zero to a hundred real quick
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 06:57:13 And that when you realize that the centuries before at the same number has some plagues happened
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 06:57:24 Like the Spanish flu
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 06:57:53 Any year that ends with a 20 is really cursed, isn't it?

plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:07:53 Im not someone who knows anything about yachts
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:08:39 just go to the nearest docks
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:08:45 find one and sail it
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:09:12 then find it

plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:14:51 If you cant have sails, then just dont add it
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:15:01 no
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:21:59 Boom is a term related to sails and masts
plane-crazy 2020-03-24 07:22:17 er

the-dump 2020-03-27 10:32:18 It's also not discussing anything controversial
the-dump 2020-03-27 10:32:47 It's simply an ironic meme from those ridiculous "ethnicity estimate" websites
creations-chat 2020-04-17 11:04:48 <@!471659414575775794> No offense, but that looks nothing like a Panzer IV
creations-chat 2020-04-17 11:06:30 It looks more like a TOG 2 with a sloped front
