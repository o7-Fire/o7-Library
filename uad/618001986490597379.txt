The Tale of .declax (618001986490597379)
general 2021-12-03 15:42:49 Welp I just joined guess I'm annoying now
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 03:15:13 Anyone know how to fix something stuck under the plot in build mode when you're at build height limit?
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 03:26:21 The top layer is motor lock and a deck <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2023-04-06 06:21:42 For a moment i thought that was an actual plane crazy build
general 2023-04-06 06:22:51 I haven't played in a while
general 2023-04-06 06:23:20 So talented people in plane crazy are just making second guess reality and plane crazy 💀
general 2023-04-06 06:23:55 And I forgot some of the controls to my builds
general 2023-04-06 06:24:19 So now I have a big boat with like 40 controls that each does it's individual thing
general 2023-04-06 06:25:17 <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
general 2023-04-06 06:25:51 Word that better please

general 2023-04-06 06:27:43 Should I get back into plane crazy?
general 2023-04-06 06:32:59 You guys ever have that edgy phase where all you built were just ww2 vehicles?
general 2023-04-06 06:34:33 I mean, when I was 12 all I made was ww2 vehicles
general 2023-04-06 06:34:53 Like bf 109
general 2023-04-06 06:35:00 Tiger
general 2023-04-06 06:35:03 Stug III
general 2023-04-06 06:35:36 I cringe at myself everyday
general 2023-04-06 06:36:03 and all I did was just to impress friends
general 2023-04-06 06:36:45 Fair enough
general 2023-04-06 06:37:09 I was probably interested in how they were darker
general 2023-04-06 06:37:39 I meant the scratches
general 2023-04-06 06:37:56 Like you can see the deteriorating paint
general 2023-04-06 06:38:21 Don't get me wrong, some vehicles nowadays do have them
general 2023-04-06 06:38:33 It's just that it's way more common in ww2 builds
general 2023-04-06 06:38:43 And propellers
general 2023-04-06 06:38:51 I love propellers
general 2023-04-06 06:39:47 And the good thing about ww2 tanks are probably the blocks
general 2023-04-06 06:40:04 I love the blocks
general 2023-04-06 06:40:37 The straight vertical lines on old tanks
general 2023-04-06 06:40:49 I guess a lil wedged
general 2023-04-06 06:41:02 Fair enough
general 2023-04-06 06:41:19 Oh I think I know now
general 2023-04-06 06:41:38 Ww2 things are easier to build than modern builds
general 2023-04-06 06:42:18 I can't find modern builds without really weird shapes
general 2023-04-06 06:44:12 True but then again
general 2023-04-06 06:45:37 I still barely understand motor locks
general 2023-04-06 06:45:44 I don't even know half of the mechanics
general 2023-04-06 06:45:52 Everything I build is up to trial and error
general 2023-04-06 06:47:13 I hate how vehicles get slower with lag
general 2023-04-06 06:47:41 I don't have a pc so I can't even move my 6k builds 😭
general 2023-04-06 06:48:32 I love simple builds
general 2023-04-06 06:48:42 Why have angle lock
general 2023-04-06 06:50:10 Go for it
general 2023-04-06 06:50:24 If you can somehow make it
general 2023-04-06 06:51:35 I can't tell good or bad builds
general 2023-04-06 06:51:58 All I see is if it would be interesting to build

general 2023-04-07 07:18:59 Hilarious
general 2023-04-07 07:19:36 Bro gott he whole squad laughing 😐😐😐
general 2023-04-07 08:54:34 You guys have any suggestions on what I should build?
