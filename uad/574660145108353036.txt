creations-chat 2023-06-18 22:43:51 How do y’all create such compact stuff without motorlocking
general 2023-06-18 22:43:58 Bhutan best flag
general 2023-06-18 22:44:12 We had a group called queer teenagers teach us about it
general 2023-06-18 22:44:33 Trans flag is best lgbtq flag imo, pink and white go hand in hand
general 2023-06-18 22:44:42 And the light blue compliments it all very well
general 2023-06-18 22:44:48 😨
general 2023-06-18 22:45:02 Banned

general 2023-06-18 22:47:52 I’m also a medical professional and I can confirm lobotomies do not work
general 2023-06-18 22:48:35 I think it’s just what thing you are born with not sure tho the queer people didn’t talk much about it

general 2023-06-18 22:56:21 L3/33 >>>>
general 2023-06-18 23:00:30 You should see the airforce’s mascot
creations-chat 2023-06-18 23:00:55 Yeah I don’t use it much, I’ve only used it for my 1-1 replicas and then it’s like 2 or 3 towers like my bf-109 and me-163
general 2023-06-18 23:02:35 And a boy
creations-chat 2023-06-18 23:04:12 Should I post my me-163 and bf-109 tomorrow? They’re nothing special but they’re very scale accurate so idk if it’s low effort or not
creations-chat 2023-06-18 23:06:34 Ok, give me like 20 min
creations-chat 2023-06-18 23:12:37 It looks pretty bad on mobile
creations-chat 2023-06-18 23:14:42 IT LOOKS ACTUALLY GOOD ON PC TRUST ME, it doesn’t look so chonky there, the colours on my bf109 are messed up and I found a way to improve it
creations-chat 2023-06-18 23:16:47 THE BF109 LOOKS MORE CORRECT, the main speak of the me-163 is just that it’s actually made for pvp
creations-chat 2023-06-18 23:18:51 I fucked up the size, it looks too chonky :(
creations-chat 2023-06-18 23:21:13 Yes, irl it was 2 meters tall, it’s very hard to make something like almost as tall as a Roblox character have different colours and shape
creations-chat 2023-06-18 23:47:23 Yes it’s what they used to lose the war
creations-chat 2023-06-19 09:53:23 somehow these wheels work really well, i have no clue how to use them tho. they somehow stick to the ground no matter your weight
creations-chat 2023-06-19 09:57:19 yeah but fabric sometimes goes TOO fast if u weigh like nothing
general 2023-06-19 10:35:38 what have you created
general 2023-06-19 10:35:42 why have you created this
general 2023-06-19 10:36:05 why did you make motorlocking in people playground
general 2023-06-19 10:40:00 how else would i describe it
general 2023-06-19 10:40:10 the thingamabob?
general 2023-06-19 10:40:27 oh yeah
general 2023-06-19 10:40:31 how tf did u even make it
general 2023-06-19 10:40:40 did u just disable collision on them?
creations-chat 2023-06-23 11:25:14 like real city?
creations-chat 2023-06-23 11:37:34 i mean oslo is cool, im biased tho im norwegian
creations-chat 2023-06-23 11:41:08 oslo isnt huge either, its a pretty small city compared to others, theres a giant train station tho that may be fun to make
creations-chat 2023-06-23 12:52:18 flåklyppa grand prix better
creations-chat 2023-06-23 18:42:24 whos that
creations-chat 2023-06-23 18:44:26 oh, well hes swedish, flåklyppa is norwegian so it cant be! he'd be a traitor!!!
creations-chat 2023-06-23 19:20:13 NORWAY RAHHHHHHH
creations-chat 2023-06-23 19:26:55 i aint readin allat
creations-chat 2023-06-23 19:33:16 this seems like is what you wanted to make
creations-chat 2023-06-23 19:35:40 these two also work, probably a ton more ways to make a small turn thing tho
general 2023-06-23 19:36:06 sweden...
general 2023-06-23 19:36:08 grrr
general 2023-06-23 19:36:39 they should nuke it
creations-chat 2023-06-23 19:38:23 hes dumb, norway crippled the german navy stopped them from making a nuke and germany lost
creations-chat 2023-06-23 23:07:15 Make it rounder
general 2023-06-24 07:09:07 Norgesveldet is a cool name
general 2023-06-24 07:09:16 No clue what it means considering I think it’s old Norse tho
general 2023-06-24 07:27:01 A gun
general 2023-06-24 09:48:46 Norway, pick me
general 2023-06-24 09:49:06 Near the donbass i believe
creations-chat 2023-06-24 10:46:17 whats the problem? i dont make planes but i may be able to help
creations-chat 2023-06-24 15:26:20 Meanie
creations-chat 2023-06-24 15:29:23 He needs to drill in that tv
creations-chat 2023-06-24 15:37:05 That’s pretty cool tho
creations-chat 2023-06-24 15:49:33 Teach me your ways
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 15:50:40 shredders are fun, they're so easy to fight as long as you fly at above 600
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 15:51:05 even without 600, they can barely aim
creations-chat 2023-06-24 15:51:35 i make shitty cars but they work pretty well
creations-chat 2023-06-24 16:13:48 imo that depends on if you are building the mechanics or a car, like just a chasis can look garbage but if its a full car its gotta look good
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:14:17 you cant do that tho, they're too slow
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:14:45 my planes have never lost a single fight (they have never seen combat against anything)
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:15:46 the fastest ive seen a shredder is 700
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:15:52 the average probably 500
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:16:00 most shredders are just tutorial builds
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:16:14 same i just can estimate it when flying at 600
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:16:30 the tutorial ones ive seen are slow as hell
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:17:02 oh ok
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:17:06 well just out manouver them
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:17:09 they turn pretty shit
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:17:18 but a lot more common
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:17:35 ive not seen many shredder balls
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:17:40 the bugs i mean
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:18:54 i killed one once with the godamn plane from porco rosso
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:19:29 this monstrosity can defeat shredders, at least it has nice colours
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:19:38 but other than that its pretty bad
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:19:40 bored
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:21:30 making heavily motorlocked builds do provide more armour probably right?
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:22:34 rockets stinky
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:22:36 guns >
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:22:48 become an anti air tank
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:24:15 oh
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:25:02 what was i thinking when making this, what the hell does that rope do
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:25:27 palnes
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:26:14 a pvp blimp would be cool
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:47:22 i took it off there was no difference
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:47:50 and then why would it be on the moddle one if there isnt even a motor there
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:47:55 i mean could work to limit it igggg
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:48:57 no it was more recent, i built it at like 2 am while bored i think
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:49:41 when i took it off it did tip over tho
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:49:45 and it didnt tip over without
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:49:58 so somehow rope that doesnt feel like changes anything makes it not able to fall
plane-crazy 2023-06-24 16:50:53 i am a genius in engineering (i do not understand my own builds)
