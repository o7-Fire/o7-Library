plane-crazy 2022-01-21 22:47:42 im trying to make a quad tilt rotor aircraft and whenever i tilt the rotors forward the entire aircraft sort of realigns to face the rotors up

plane-crazy 2022-01-21 22:52:08 an aircraft is technicaly an all terrain vehicle because it just goes over the terrain :troll:

plane-crazy 2022-01-21 23:33:36 Hope u have credit or debit card (yes they got me with that too)
general 2022-01-21 23:36:48 Have u had corona
general 2022-01-21 23:36:57 Like any variant
general 2022-01-21 23:38:05 Corona aint no joke
general 2022-01-21 23:38:30 Healthy 15 year old, no smoking or lung desease and i was on a ventilator for 2 weeks :)
general 2022-01-21 23:39:17 Yeah well playing russian roulette with corona isnt all that great to be honest
general 2022-01-21 23:39:47 Like, take it seriously instead of "oh just the flu" biggest mistake you can make
general 2022-01-21 23:40:17 4
general 2022-01-21 23:40:23 2 jabs and 2 boosters
general 2022-01-21 23:41:11 My country has a 2nd booster for those who got the vaccine early
general 2022-01-21 23:41:59 And i have had corona 2 times before and 3 vaccines and still got leveled on a hospital bed by corona

No joke
general 2022-01-21 23:42:24 Thats not how vaccines work
general 2022-01-21 23:43:08 A vaccine gives natural imunity trough exposure to a severly weakened version of a virus
general 2022-01-21 23:43:39 95% vaccination 75% infection rate :hmmm:
general 2022-01-21 23:43:59 The 5% unvaxxed are 5x as infectious
general 2022-01-21 23:44:38 Wdym
general 2022-01-21 23:45:54 There are more car accedents in a country with more cars. Does that mean that the country with more cars is more dangerous?
general 2022-01-21 23:46:34 6B?
general 2022-01-21 23:47:16 Because due to the vaccines, the lockdowns were less harsh so the economy doesnt drop dead
general 2022-01-21 23:47:29 So more people went out and went to parties and such
general 2022-01-21 23:47:39 So thats the higher infection rates
general 2022-01-21 23:47:49 It does not
general 2022-01-21 23:48:08 Lpl show me your proof first
general 2022-01-21 23:48:14 Your making this up
general 2022-01-21 23:48:35 Vaxxed people infect more and die more BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE VAXXED PEOPLE
general 2022-01-21 23:48:47 And vaxxed people still carry the virus
general 2022-01-21 23:48:58 The vaccine just makes corona less lethal
general 2022-01-21 23:49:21 Either this guy is trolling or has severe brain hemmoraging
general 2022-01-21 23:50:04 No, the vast majority of people are vaxxed so vaxxed people spread it more
general 2022-01-21 23:50:17 Because there is more vaxxed people
general 2022-01-21 23:50:55 No, corona spreads faster trough vaxxed people because they are the vast majority of the population
general 2022-01-21 23:52:54 If you take 10% from 10 you get 1, if you take 5% from 90 you get 4.5, lower percentage but a higher number. That is whu vaccinated people transmit more corona, per person it is low but because there is a lot of vaccinated people the numbers are higher.
general 2022-01-21 23:53:19 FREE flight to mars

general 2022-01-21 23:53:21 It free
general 2022-01-21 23:54:09 Expert aeronautic and shipyard engineer i would expect more braincells tbh...

general 2022-01-21 23:55:19 100% trolling
