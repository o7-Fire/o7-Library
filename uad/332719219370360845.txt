plane-crazy 2020-12-15 19:33:14 can we get a higher caliber gun that does more dmg like 20 or 30mm canons?
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 19:35:56 I dont mean real guns just something that can actually do dmg the only useful pvp weapon are rockets and there slow and only work half of the time
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 19:39:36 ik but when you in a high speed dogfight with a good pilot your only deleting like one block on every pass and thats ok but I was thinking of a different gun that shot explosive like rounds
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 19:51:13 <@!378962393453166592> dont forget the super fast jet that only loops and spams rockets
