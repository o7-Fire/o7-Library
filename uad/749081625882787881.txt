general 2022-03-08 00:57:28 Yeah, keeps happening
general 2022-03-08 00:57:44 Me and many others are having this same problem, continually puts you in an update lobby then kicks
general 2022-03-08 00:57:53 Except now it’s just instant kicks for updates, so
general 2022-03-08 00:58:00 F’d on
general 2022-03-08 00:58:07 Idk
general 2022-03-08 00:58:19 Especially when people are constantly getting thrown around in lobbies

general 2022-03-08 00:59:50 Deal with it <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-03-08 00:59:57 Alright I depart
general 2022-03-08 01:01:02 Only time I come here is when I have issues that need discussing, so
general 2022-03-08 01:04:29 No <:trollface:775024642104229898>
