plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:42:48 God I just lost 5 hours of progress by saving a different craft onto my fav craft
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:43:11 Legit spent all day and insta ragequit
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:43:12 Fml
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:43:30 He needs to wind back time
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:43:36 time to force gods hand
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:43:52 Idc
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:44:01 God gotta work
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:44:20 this game really needs an undo button
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 01:46:00 I made a massive hotel and then turned it into a fast land driving hotel and a cruise ship
creations-chat 2018-12-03 01:49:42 I made a huge and amazing boat/land vehicle with a hotel kinda thing on top that looked absolutely amazing on the inside
creations-chat 2018-12-03 01:49:55 too bad I accidentally saved another creation to it instead of loading it
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 02:26:50 Omg Imagine if there was a way to rewing your account or something to get a save back
help 2018-12-03 16:22:41 Is there a place to submit your own contest along with a vip server link of there are vip servers?
creations-chat 2018-12-03 22:31:31 I created a vehicle that spins and not too fast but it will fling anything that hits it and it is almost immovable aside from it moving itself
help 2018-12-08 17:24:14 So I am making a toothless and the design is okay but it doesn't fly very well. the maneuverability is absolutely trash but I don't wanna shrink the wings and add too many control surfaces bc I don't want it to look even worse. Any ideas?
help 2018-12-08 17:27:03 Also whenever I rotate to the left my creation does it but turns right and when I try to lean right it leans but the creation turns left. Any ideas?
help 2018-12-08 17:35:08 I already kinda messed up the look with the rockets
help 2018-12-08 17:35:14 But the turning is also a huge issue
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 19:55:20 I still can't get over how oddly fun this game is
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 22:17:39 Lol
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:24:24 So it's a cruise ship that can drive on land or in the water, and if you add more helium it can kinda fly. I love taking it over the jumps in the water.
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:24:25 
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:25:18 Idk if this is how you get ranks but I think so
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:25:26 causes a great deal of lag to most
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:45:23 So this is an entirely prop vehicle that can vtol to go up then reposition the props forwards or back to go forwards or back. It is not the best looking nor the best functioning but it works. No helium either.
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:45:57 
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:46:31 Is there anything else I need to do for ranks or do I just post and hope someone sees it?
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:48:27 Oh. Would it be spam to repost so my username is present?
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:48:47 Think I'd get away with deleting then reposting?
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:50:07 Okay thanks.
creations-chat 2018-12-21 22:51:20 yeah
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 23:30:18 Okay
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:15:09 So basically I improved upon my prop vehicle so now you lift up with props, go forwards or backwards with props, and rotate the vertical props where they face opposite directions to rotate the craft side to side.
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:15:15 
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:15:48 And idk if you saw the lag monster cruise ship I posted earlier that can drive on both land and in water and do the water jumps pretty well.
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:17:01 yeah but I wanted to make it complicated
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:17:10 More blocks is better I think
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:18:17 Well it would just be more motors
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:19:27 Plus this still qualifies for the prop master rank. Vtol with no engines or helium
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:20:14 And I fixed the problem of it uncontrollably rotating that I had before lol
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:23:38 Rlly hoping a mod comes on this time to check out my builds before they get pushed too far for them to see.
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:30:20 So this is a two story cruise ship complete with a dining room/bar, a restroom, a top deck, and 8 bedrooms. It is able to drive on land and sail in the water so it is capable of performing the jumps in the water. This should qualify for the roles Sea Marshal and Lag Machine since it is over the 2000 blocks for Lag Machine and it is a ship that can sail and is over 2000 blocks for Sea Marshal.
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:30:27 
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:31:20 If you need proof of it being able to sail I can provide it.
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 00:32:09 Still hoping a mod checks creations chat and sees my 2 creations bc 1 fits the critera for 2 roles while the other fits 1 more role.
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 00:33:05 That's cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 00:33:50 Uhh Imperial, do you mind checking out my 2 creations in creations chat and awarding roles if you see fit?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 00:35:00 Wait how is that furnace spinning? Am I missing something?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 00:35:10 It all seems to face inward
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:37:05 Gladiator, do you have hinges or something that bring those together? I saw the pic in general.
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:37:28 Oh
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:37:49 Are the motors all mirrored in everything?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:38:13 I see how one motor has a block in between it but I don't see the other one having it
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 00:38:34 Ty imperial
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:41:43 Idk
creations-chat 2018-12-22 00:42:20 Is it okay if I join your game?
help 2018-12-22 01:16:52 I'm not at the block height limit but it won't let me move my craft up?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 01:38:18 In the dare devil rank description it says plane, does that mean it can't use helium to hover?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:30:36 Guys can anyone join me? I'm trying to get the dare devil rank. I have a plane that is over 500 blocks that I think can do it but I need someone I can land on in the water. I also have a carrier if you want to get it too. The rank requirement is "Dare Devil | Land a plane consisting of 500+ blocks on an aircraft carrier in the water. Plane must be completely on the aircraft carrier in order to qualify."
Anyone able to join?
I can make a vip server if you're interested.
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:30:49 I posted this in help but deleted it and moved it here so ppl would see it so sorry for the spam
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:31:54 Is anyone willing to help me though?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:32:39 yeah i technically don't have a carrier but I have a cruise ship that I can make into one
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:33:15 I think I should be able to land on most things hopefully. Just probably not first try.
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:34:25 I'm in.
creations-chat 2018-12-22 02:40:41 Made this trying to get the Dare Devil rank. It is over 500 blocks and it landed fully on the "aircraft carrier". It stopped and was landed. I do not know if this counts.
creations-chat 2018-12-22 02:40:44 
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:56:20 Did he crash or leave?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:57:08 Well
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 02:57:44 Is this an improvement? It has color and a bit more physical features.
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:16:44 <@456226577798135808> I think I have a plan but if it doesn't work I'll go with yours
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:16:49 So I'm ready
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:18:10 tryna get a rank but his platform is skinny so I made a slot thing at the bottom of my plane hoping to somehow hook on
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:18:27 
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:18:45 Imperial, could you spawn your plane in so I can give it another shot?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:22:44 Rip
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:22:46 that is cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:27:39 I flew my creation into yours and my game froze
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:28:05 I left and I still hear the sounds
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:28:09 Oh nvm
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:29:25 I rejoined because I froze when I flew into yours
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:29:39 Other than that no lag
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:29:46 Rip
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:31:58 Did you crash?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:32:19 Well
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:32:42 Is anyone else willing to let me try and land on their ship in the water so I can get a badge? I've got a ship you can land on if you want it too
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:32:44 Rank sorry
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:33:38 Anyone got a craft that can float on water and that I can land on?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:34:11 Do you mind joining the vip server so I can try it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:35:39 Oh I guess I might've crashed idk
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:35:56 rejoining
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:38:50 I did it
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:38:53 Dare Devil | Land a plane consisting of 500+ blocks on an aircraft carrier in the water. Plane must be completely on the aircraft carrier in order to qualify.
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:39:06 lemme grab a pic
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:40:25 Also a view from this side
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:40:31 
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:40:53 It wasn't meant to look good lol
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:41:07 but ppl said it was too bad so I gave it paint and a few other details
creations-chat 2018-12-22 03:46:00 Landed it. Over 500 blocks completely on an aircraft carrier. Sky Devil?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 03:46:10 Dare

plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:50:29 I did it finally
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:50:43 yay
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 03:51:02 Oh yeah and I posted a prop master creation earlier but I don't think anyone checked it
creations-chat 2018-12-22 03:56:13 Cool
creations-chat 2018-12-22 03:57:20 turns out it is too wide
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 04:13:53 That looks cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 04:17:21 Wait how do I upload a vid to creations chat? I made a plane that can do a barrel roll [not aileron] at above 300 sps
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 04:17:27 Oof

creations-chat 2018-12-22 05:07:35 Well
creations-chat 2018-12-22 05:07:46 Nobody saw my other speed build
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:21:01 Rip
help 2018-12-22 06:21:29 yeah
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:29:16 Okay, why does control surfaces mean it isn't a heli? Just curious.
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:31:57 
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:32:05 
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:32:08 Some helis have em
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:32:11 Not as much as his
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:33:48 If a propeller is used for liftoff and thrust, wouldn't it at least count at a vtol?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:34:16 Ik what it means
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:34:40 And if his is taking off and landing vertically, doesn't that means it fits the criteria?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:34:47 I did know
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:34:54 But you said it didn't count as a heli
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:35:04 But it should at least count as a vtol in some way
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:35:29 Ik
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:35:45 What's with the ping lol
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:36:19 I'm not?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:36:44 you said that helis don't have control surfaces so I showed some fins on helis lol
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:37:16 Ik what a vtol is and that a heli classifies as a vtol lol
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:38:29 I wasn't arguing with you when I asked if it still counted as a vtol, I was stating my point
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:38:37 Could we not be arguing in general?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:39:36 "Okay, why does control surfaces mean it isn't a heli? Just curious."
"If a propeller is used for liftoff and thrust, wouldn't it at least count at a vtol?"
That wasn't directed towards you. That was just a question in general.
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:39:45 the first one was for you but the second wasn't
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:41:28 But it should at least count as a vtol
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:41:32 So?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:41:43 and I didn't say they said that
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:41:55 I was just stating my question jesus
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:42:04 Win what?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:42:18 ...
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:44:06 I'm confused at this point lol
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:45:11 I know that already
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:45:18 I have a vtol that isn't a heli lol
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:46:18 Exactly
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:46:27 So what's the problem?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:48:31 Someone I saw earlier had a craft that used engines to simulate acceleration and deceleration on motors
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:48:35 What?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:48:38 I was just saying jesus
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:48:50 Why you gotta hate on me so much lmao
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:59:02 Jesus
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 06:59:04 
creations-chat 2018-12-22 06:59:41 Well I made a creation capable of getting me to this speed
creations-chat 2018-12-22 06:59:42 
creations-chat 2018-12-22 06:59:55 I wasn't in the creation at the time of the pic but the speed was from the creation.
creations-chat 2018-12-22 07:00:04 Does that count for orbital?
creations-chat 2018-12-22 07:00:15 It is just above that speed
creations-chat 2018-12-22 07:00:28 Not sure either
creations-chat 2018-12-22 07:01:10 It does say using any means necessary
creations-chat 2018-12-22 07:02:10 wait
creations-chat 2018-12-22 07:02:11 
creations-chat 2018-12-22 07:02:16 hold on lemme grab the shot with my name

plane-crazy 2018-12-22 17:31:01 Can there be a rank for someone who built an aircraft carrier that hovers in the sky that a plane can land on?
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 17:31:08 Wait wrong place to post
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 17:32:03 I was thinking like one that hovers in the sky

Requesting Modeler Rank
I don't think anyone has ever made a forest fly. It can turn right and left, pitch forward and backwards, move forward and backwards as well as side to side, and it can go up and down. I hope this qualifies.
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:05:22 Btw I circled the creation in blue and it has 1049 blocks
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:09:16 Well I've never seen a flying forest



It might not be creative but I think it's unique lmao
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:09:45 It might not really be enough though but I hope it is
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:11:42 lmao
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:16:50 oh
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:17:01 so it has to be creative too lmao

creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:18:29 damn
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:18:39 well nvm then
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:19:16 wait
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:19:42 I thought you meant an apple and a mouse, not an apple mouse oof
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:20:18 thought you forgot the comma in apple, mouse, and aircraft
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:20:27 idek
creations-chat 2019-06-03 04:43:38 does this count as unique? it's wings are on those rotators and they constantly spin so they're kinda just weird wings which probably doesn't count but I thought that I'd test it out and see if it counts lmao
