bot-central 2021-08-01 17:23:26 !rank
creations-chat 2021-08-01 17:29:12 thanks for the kind words
general 2021-08-01 17:30:58 damn creations-feedback is toxic
general 2021-08-01 17:31:05 holy
creations-chat 2021-08-01 17:32:15 nothing wrong your opinion but the trashtalk is insane mate. What you have to show for it?
general 2021-08-01 17:33:45 i can see that haha
general 2021-08-01 17:34:03 is creations like for a prize or something?
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 17:34:38 i was trying to be funny but i failed
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 17:34:58 hell yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 17:35:52 Can i have some constructive feedback?
creations-chat 2021-08-01 17:37:54 Listen im new here i didn't know creations has this unwritten rule that you have to upload a masterpeace. I just made a jet within (as you said) a few minutes.(we can talk in priv if you want to)
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 17:38:56 yeah that
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 17:39:04 i was not thinking about colours
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 17:39:15 in my mind thats a secondary thing
creations-chat 2021-08-01 17:42:59 I thought that creations was where people share builds and just have a great time.Not a place where you upload an image and get critisized for it not being something that you aproove of. I don't want clout i dont want upvotes i just want to share a little jet i put together in a few minutes. I dont see any scummy tactics here...where do you?
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 17:43:26 i could but my own taste came in to play here
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 17:43:36 i dont think the jet looks amazing
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 17:43:57 so i changed it up a bit to suit my own tastes
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 17:44:23 but to be fair to make it realistic i should make it longer. thanks for the feedback
creations-chat 2021-08-01 17:46:15 i have noticed, however you have not noticed that im new around here and i dont know a lot about the server. how about that?
creations-chat 2021-08-01 17:50:16 I get that, what i don't get is why so shallow critsism as "not well made" or "shitty". Feedback is what i wanted what i got was roasted haha. But for real do you beat up an infant bc it cant walk when its born? I hope you get the metafore.
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 17:56:37 woah
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 17:56:41 that looks great
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 17:57:07 well i like it
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 17:57:26 no problemo
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 17:57:46 but for real in what world does that not look good?
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 18:00:12 omfg i didn't know that this server is so hardcore.
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 18:01:00 80% of these build are better then on youtube and they are getting shitted on by critics
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 18:01:47 dammit
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 18:01:57 omfg
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 18:02:09 my mind is blown
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 18:05:27 people don't like micro builds here do they?
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 18:06:15 idk if im good lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 18:06:32 i like to keep my builds simple
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 18:06:40 i dont use motorlocks and stuff
