creations-chat 2019-12-15 19:01:03 I don't find it immediately necessary to tell us on land or water. I may not have 20/20 vision, but I can still tell what was land and what was water.

help 2020-03-22 02:56:37 Is your creation big and folded?
help 2020-03-22 02:56:51 Yeah. I have always had trouble with that.
help 2020-03-22 02:57:16 I'm not sure what exactly it is, but when it is folded you can't have mouse controls.
help 2020-03-22 02:57:18 No.
help 2020-03-22 02:58:10 One thing you can do though is use motor 2's and attach wing panels to them for mouse controls.
help 2020-03-22 02:59:00 I am also pretty sure that it has something to do with not directly being connected to the Main Pilot Seat.
help 2020-03-22 02:59:09 Alright. Good luck!

creations-chat 2020-04-08 20:16:17 üòê
creations-chat 2020-04-08 20:17:55 it‚Äôs alright. i used to be worse than that. but over time you experiment with different things, and you learn more about rounding a plane or adding detail in spots you didn‚Äôt know you could.
creations-chat 2020-04-08 20:18:24 i‚Äôm only on my phone right now, and don‚Äôt have any screenshots of builds I have on my computer sadly.
general 2020-04-09 14:55:29 beats me.
general 2020-04-09 14:55:36 i live in a land of corn and soybeans
general 2020-04-09 14:56:58 I made a stupidly small Phenom with a total of 3 passenger seats and a copilot seat to ferry people up there.
general 2020-04-09 14:57:15 I was bored lol
general 2020-04-09 14:58:09 Well. I had just made a huge 757 and basically finished the airport I had built on a friend‚Äôs account. I had nothing to do
general 2020-04-09 22:33:29 I can‚Äôt find where I was pinged in this channel.
general 2020-04-09 22:34:38 The jetway is I want to say 12-15 blocks long.
general 2020-04-09 22:34:38 <@!610795263992528909> So, the airport is the width of the plot.
general 2020-04-09 22:35:32 It can hold my Boeing 757 easily, just a little wonky cause I have to raise the jetway up by 2 or so blocks which makes it uneven. But it‚Äôs able to hold a pretty large aircraft.

general 2020-04-17 15:31:19 I built a museum for the things that I have made in the past, and a friend of mine decided to make an identical building and use half of my stuff inside.
general 2020-04-17 15:31:26 Do not do what I did.. Lol
general 2020-04-17 15:32:16 But it's fine for a public server, cause I have found that people don't know how to make huge planes, and everything is parts of huge planes.
general 2020-04-17 15:32:26 Yes, you can have a 757 engine, but what are you going to do that?
general 2020-04-17 15:34:05 I got literally kicked from a group once because I didn't like an idea.
general 2020-04-17 15:34:33 I know. It was mobile elevators for an airline with broken jetways

creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:18:54 my 5.1k block, blank white Boeing 757-200. might put a livery on this variant, or keep it white. don't know yet
creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:25:56 i was tempted to make a -300 variant as well. but i don't have plot space
creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:29:40 lol. took me a while to perfect. too many details
creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:30:52 my nose took me a long time to perfect. and i have disassembled and rebuilt about 90 percent of the plane
creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:31:30 so, my opinions.
creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:31:41 i need better screenshots to see the entire plane
creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:32:04 but overall, i think the wings could be straight to the winglets
creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:32:27 there is a change in wedges halfway down the wing or so
creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:33:42 also i think if you had thicker wings it would look a ton better
creations-chat 2020-08-04 20:33:53 my plane flies much better than you would think

creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:37:57 very interesting nose
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:40:09 nose wacky as hell
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:40:37 i am curious how you're planning to add a tail
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:40:57 since that is a 180 degree vertical fold. which i would recommend never using for big plane
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:42:26 where landing gear go
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:44:15 ah. i see. i am the opposite
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:44:36 this massive thing
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:44:58 which has been basically completely rebuilt now, but not much more progress than that has been made
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:45:14 just cameras
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:45:30 we don't talk about the DC-10 and 757 folds though
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:45:51 i don't think i have a picture in build, it's literally just cameras attached to motors
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:46:52 this was first build stages of my DC-10
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:50:06 i have had quite a lot of practice
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:50:23 reference pictures and blueprints are the most helpful thing that i believe you can use
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:51:33 i need a tutorial üòç
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:53:29 yeah, it took me a while to get. i have built around 10 large aircraft, with this being my first motorlocked. i am also working on a motorlocked 787 nose. but i have used lots of pictures, closeup pictures, and many blueprints
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:53:49 feel free to DM me anytime, i can help
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:54:14 anytime. always experiment and try new things!

creations-chat 2020-11-22 06:35:58 hey man, look. i made a DC-10 nose trying to pull it out of my butt in like 30 minutes, not even for my own plane. but then i was told to continue building the plane since I had a nose, and now i have a plane. *story time*
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:43:36 *fricker*
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:45:08 very plain if you ask me. not much detail
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:46:43 go to the excessive level like i do and then people will just judge you even more for it. lol
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:48:28 honestly, i think that you could give it some more shape, and make it a lot shorter. there is a lot of curve on the top of the reference, and your's is just straight. and thank you
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:53:22 realistically, you could just shorten your current airship. just snip the ends off with an autoclicker if you want to go the route of rebuilding. but colors and some tweaks would benefit a lot
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:55:38 honestly, for future builds: when i build an aircraft of any type, i build a very rough outline, with the entire fuselage shape, and then make a vertical view of it, to verify size and proporions, and build out from there. take the advice if you want, i'm just sayin
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:58:21 that's what you'd have to do if you want it to look proportional and be the correct length. how i see it, is if you want it to be proporionate, you would have to do 2 things: either make it fatter, which means you have to delete literally the entire thing except the gondolas, or deleting the front and moving everything back.

creations-chat 2020-11-26 06:02:21 i bit off way more than i could chew when i started building my dc-10
creations-chat 2020-11-26 06:04:21 my brain hasn't worked the same since i built this
creations-chat 2020-11-26 06:06:35 there are like 3 sections that lock off each other. adds a hell of a lot of detail
creations-chat 2020-11-26 06:08:12 this is also the back of my tail engine, when i was first building it. it all comes together nicely, but the unspawned version is hellish
creations-chat 2020-11-26 06:14:38 i use it for aircraft cockpits and details, cause i can't go without details
help 2020-11-26 06:15:28 that's why
help 2020-11-26 06:15:37 motor 2 sucks
help 2020-11-26 06:15:40 never use it
help 2020-11-26 06:15:53 i have never used motor 2 for anything
help 2020-11-26 06:15:59 they're real broken
help 2020-11-26 06:16:14 nah, my stuff is all surface controlled
help 2020-11-26 06:17:36 i build big planes, and motor 2 controls would break the whole plane
creations-chat 2020-11-26 06:45:58 don't the engines go a fair bit forward from the wings? and those wings seem way too far forward. i agree with the cockpit windows too
creations-chat 2020-11-28 00:31:58 die

plane-crazy 2020-12-29 07:30:07 explain
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 07:30:15 make better looking cockpit then
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 07:31:01 you do realize...
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 07:31:11 it's a game
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 07:31:14 with little blocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 07:31:24 can't make a perfect angle, chief
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 07:31:28 can't make it identical
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 07:31:45 pretty good given it has this small amount of motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 07:32:14 i also should remove the entire interior of that plane then too
plane-crazy 2020-12-29 07:32:22 cause it's not a realistic plane üòâ
