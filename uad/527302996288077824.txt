plane-crazy 2019-02-27 19:07:44 there needs to be a way to set all blocks to something like when your changing the controls and there is copy and paste well there needs to be a button next to them saying set all and sets them to whatever you want instead of having to click on every single block and clicking paste it would save alot of time to just set them all to what you want instantly and by that you would have to click copy and then click set all and they would all be what you copied
