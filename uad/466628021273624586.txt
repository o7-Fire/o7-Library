creations-chat 2021-07-19 12:43:47 @everyone Is it fine if I show one last thing. It's not Mustard tho- or did you guys had enough of me posting <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
creations-chat 2021-07-19 12:45:49 Yes. I liked this one. a little bit over engineered on the front, but very nice shaped üòÑ
creations-chat 2021-07-19 12:51:38 I don't see a problem. is it the intake?
creations-chat 2021-07-19 13:21:11 <@!849417848740642826> wtf. I am also good- CAMERA LOCK, yeah now I understand. What I do is like only motor lock. Now I understand why people hate my builds. seems like I am an outdated pro builder, you guys have seemingly moved to a new era of locking builds.
creations-chat 2021-07-19 13:25:18 Guess I am outdated. 3 years of progress, and now I understand why people nowadays says I suck at building. :0, but I understand now. thx <@!849417848740642826>
creations-chat 2021-07-19 13:27:44 <@!739369649971527720> yea I know! but I just- Idk, maybe lazy to take my time to *(research?)* myself angle locking with cameras.
creations-chat 2021-07-19 13:33:22 The only knowledge I have as a pro builder is like. sadly however, the motor lock. which is quite old for some of you guys. But that is what I have been training for like 1-2 years. What i focus on always is fast building. and advanced but simple planning
creations-chat 2021-07-19 13:35:53 <@!718006867808485447> me builder. Lol, okay
creations-chat 2021-07-19 13:50:38 Before I show you guys the results of my own VVA-14 build, I want to know what you guys had in mind of when I showed a picture of the VVA-14 while I was doing a flight test (under progress). Just scroll up a little in the <#384025409945337856>, and make feedback what I have to change. **(reason why I ask you guys about this)** So I don't get instant downvotes for no explanation. And hope if you might like my work. üôè

creations-chat 2021-07-29 09:51:46 I have to develope this engine- I cannot deal with what we have in Plane Crazy, I need to make something like this. One of the best blades I have ever seen üòÜ
creations-chat 2021-08-05 11:45:17 Imagine a VTOL flying boat, I mean. Those exist in plane crazy, and what I am talking about is less than a carrier, and more like an actual Battleship equipped with only missile technology
creations-chat 2021-08-05 11:48:16 Who here is an ambitious plane crazy builder?

- But what about a Supersonic sea vessel? Something that can slice through the ocean which is thought impossible or probably almost never been ... I guess, built
creations-chat 2021-08-05 11:51:24 That works ü§î
creations-chat 2021-08-05 11:57:09 This is not a challenge, but an idea I kept for a long time : Submarine but is Spacecraft themed and can go supersonic speed up to 1000-2000 in Plane Crazy, colours good enough with camoflauge looking. And is almost undetected under water. Can outrun any threats above sea level and from aircrafts

creations-chat 2021-09-27 08:28:26 People who make 2D art in Plane Crazy and earns over 50 ups and 1 down is just fucking confusing. It's just 2D! It's not even difficult to build a platform or white wall and just paint it whilst taking a picture and copying the colours to paint. It's just fucking ridiculous. They cannot possibly earn the "expert" if they only do 2D. Atleast 3D art I suggest would be a lot worth for upvote.

plane-crazy 2021-09-28 05:01:12 Everyone says that Pepsi, Dr Pepper and Coca Cola are competing against each other. In my opinion, Fanta is like the real opponent to Coca Cola
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 12:11:33 I drew up another fighter jet design, I call it F-C25 (Fal-Con25) As you can see, the wings and the intake design is weird.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 12:12:34 . Shut
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 12:12:47 Eh, that‚Äôs what I was trying to think of how to explain
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 12:13:19 It is angled 10-15 degrees vertically
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 12:13:50 It‚Äôs suppose to be like‚Ä¶ a jet fighter that can withstand G-force
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 12:14:27 That is why the wings lets its weight to sort of power up while pulling up
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 12:14:36 -_-
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 12:18:32 Ugh. Again.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 12:19:13 Not like every other jet like F-35, F-22, F-18, F-16 or other.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 12:19:57 This design is like, made to do multiple loops and turns really quick without any chance of wings literally breaking
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 12:20:26 Donut care
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 12:26:21 Hm.
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 12:28:22 I am also designing tons of more aircrafts I want to try build in Plane Crazy, jets that can perform amazingly, great control surfaces, and ofcourse, outrun any threat.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 06:36:36 Drew up another design I designated as the SF-12, but nicknamed ‚ÄúBugFighter‚Äù or ‚ÄúBugHopper‚Äù, as you can see. Many of you might think this as absolute weird design. This concept I made was to have many sorts of abilities, like hover, takeoff vertically, cruise high altitude and harvest the ground effect. This plane doesn‚Äôt hunt submarines like the VVA-14. This one targets warships and helis.

creations-chat 2021-09-30 06:56:20 Wdym ass, shut up dummy. It was great series. I got tears when the main character lost his friends, like. How would I not feel sad about it. And, it was stressful
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 06:58:20 I hate when players get invisible once I shoot them. I cannot even see where they are. However, I am extremely good at hearing and aiming where they precisly are
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 06:58:37 But it‚Äôs still a problem, cuz they tell me to cry about it and that I suck
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 06:59:28 Like, do they even understand the issues of the game, they feel like they are pros without saying it, their attitude and toxic behaviour is really stupid
creations-chat 2021-09-30 07:01:07 Yes leemao, I mean. It is sad dude, they are very good at acting bruh. How can you not try understanding how painful and sad it is to lose your closest friends and families. Sacrifice and all that stuff

plane-crazy 2021-10-08 06:44:47 Alright, so um. Many of you PCC people liked to draw tanks. Here is one, my first attempt. To draw a tank :
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 06:45:10 I call it the T299, me knowing it as ‚ÄùHydraSuperTank‚Äù
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 06:45:17 Lol yes indeed
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 06:50:33 But the reason I made that tank, is cuz uh. I was dreaming, and the world was post-apocalyptic. And then a tank just rolled up infront of me with a speed of 50 mph. An operator opened a hatch and told me to get to the safe zone. Because everywhere was a warfield. Army, navy and airattacks happened everywhere. Zombies was also huge problem. And as you could also see. Fighter Aircrafts taking fire at each other. This is a battle life, survival and death. In my dream this battle was named ApoZ-Force. And most known as the Post-Apocalyptic war between nations and zombies.
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 06:53:06 There are five men operaring that hydro tank. Two people reloading, however. You may thing ‚Äùthat‚Äôs impossible, how are they suppose to reload fast for each gun‚Äù well, they use  some machines that is part of the gun. It‚Äô it‚Äôs just fcking a lot I saw in my dream
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 06:53:09 It was epic madness
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 06:54:32 Two men reloading, one driver, one communicator, and one man that is specially trained to pull awesome strategic operations

plane-crazy 2021-10-13 08:43:31 The possibilities of making such advanced builds is like beyond of what Plane crazy is being think of- How.. is my question
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 08:44:58 Like, can Plane crazy- top off one of the best ‚Äúbuild vehicles‚Äù games there is? If that is an example. Of how plane crazy builds can reach, that should then top between Stormworks, Simple planes (mobile), many other things-
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 08:45:19 This has to be very serious
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 08:46:03 It has to be, I have to bring this up because it doesn‚Äôt make sense if people will start arguing about ‚Äúhow did he do that‚Äù now I am asking ‚Äúis plane crazy advanced like other games beyond roblox?‚Äù

plane-crazy 2021-10-13 08:49:34 Under 13, and that person might be one of the great builders-
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 08:49:42 Like, how
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 08:50:54 Right now because of those, I am planning to upper my game of builds. Using all knowledge I have to push further üò≠, I can‚Äôt stop- Time just rushes by and I am being left behind with old era of plane crazy builds
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 08:53:06 These builds I made, in the past of two years is like. I am feeling like I‚Äôm left behind.
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 08:53:35 They never have a chance to be yet ‚Äúgreat‚Äù atleast ‚Äúnice‚Äù is what I see them
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 08:53:57 Yup.

plane-crazy 2021-10-13 08:54:41 You do understand that
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 08:55:04 Those builds are like the 2019 technology
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 08:55:31 I am far from achieving Motor lock, next stage of idk. Locking
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 08:58:14 Even this I thought I was at the edge of being ‚ÄúPro‚Äù because I tried hard to make an airliner to have it‚Äôs wing really good effort at build. However, I could see that. It‚Äôs like 1/5 fraction in comparison to other aircrafts I‚Äôve seen past multiple servers.

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 12:05:39 So I won't say ur kinda over-exaddurating **wtf I don't know how it spells or what it is called**
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 12:06:22 Wait, if that was possible, you would hire me to make concepts so you could build them?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 12:06:30 O_0

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 12:08:37 bobux to upgrade, because I have nothing but my own skillset-
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 12:10:13 I mean, many people that are gods at building super detailed builds like tanks, stealth planes, and military vehicles. it takes them weeks to make them perfect, for me. I can't even lol, so I decide to draw something up completely unusual to their builds that comes from real life based vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 12:10:27 sheet.
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 12:10:34 yea I can relate to that

plane-crazy 2021-11-21 07:55:27 And Idk what else to say but uh, it worked
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 07:55:33 
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 07:56:18 Idk how, but it can go faster 1k speed even if i t only has around 15 hover engines to pull this giant machine
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 07:56:49 It's my "canoot" heli
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 07:57:09 it is
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 07:57:15 I drew it up on paper
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 07:57:20 Suppose to carry 2
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 07:57:23 but
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 07:57:31 with its super siz

plane-crazy 2021-11-21 08:00:15 anyways
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 08:01:01 the giant heli I built was suppose to carry 2 heavy tanks and 150 troops/or/4-8 ICBMs
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 08:01:34 But when I finished the body it looks like it can carry 4 tanks instead.
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 08:02:06 I will try figur our how to catch up people with a crane
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 08:02:08 but for now
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 08:02:17 I am testing it for performance
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 08:02:29 looks like it can do a barrel roll apparently üòÇ
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 08:05:20 me neither
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 08:05:23 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 08:53:18 CAN ME PLS JOIN SERVER

creations-chat 2021-11-25 13:42:08 Exactly, so what you did is basically Iowa in Yamatos painting scheme 

**edit**: Wtf, still, doesn‚Äôt look good- the bow part is a bit too long. ‚Ä¢Im gonna draw the line of how the shape could have been.‚Ä¢

plane-crazy 2021-11-26 11:20:07 Damn, I didn‚Äôt know this existed. Then I must have made a more complex drawing-
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 11:20:26 Kinda similar of tilting engines-
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 11:21:01 uh yea? Ofc?

plane-crazy 2021-11-26 11:22:28 Idk what I was thinking. Suppose to be a very efficient concorde design-
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 11:22:44 Cylindrical wing-
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 11:22:55 With engines inside the cylinder-
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 11:23:01 Instead of under the wings-
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 11:23:03 uh.
plane-crazy 2021-11-26 11:23:17 Damn

general 2021-11-27 07:30:19 All I can do is just spam ping everyone
general 2021-11-27 07:30:48 or just argue and people will start spamming "attention seeker" or "skill issue"

general 2021-11-27 07:39:02 I don't think it's likely I get chance to rank up
general 2021-11-27 07:39:09 How do I do it?
general 2021-11-27 07:39:21 I know.
general 2021-11-27 07:39:41 But how do I actually prove people that I deserve to have different roles, and ranks
general 2021-11-27 07:39:53 Most of my builds are based on Mustard Content
general 2021-11-27 07:40:01 ?

general 2021-11-27 07:51:10 Ok so I read the ranks. And, It's disapointing that I may not have followed those instructions. One. I use 5-15% helium to most of my giant builds. two. I use HOVER-Drives to go faster than 500 speed without lag in a 3-5k block builds.

general 2021-11-27 08:05:55 OMG OWO CAR!!!
general 2021-11-27 08:07:39 Im gonna show a plane that I will try improve overtime til it's ready to barely reach 50 upvotes
general 2021-11-27 08:08:57 **CANCER DURIFTO!**
general 2021-11-27 08:18:32 Ok to clear this up, It's my A350. It has working flaps, spoilers and all control surfaces, working advanced reverse thrust. The Plane doesn't need rocket/jet thrust to pitch it up or down or roll, the plane can instead balance without me touching the keyboard. it can land smoothly butter without me needing to assist it, idk how it's possible so don't questiom about it. Most importantly in my likings of this plane is, wingflex. 

**I will smoothen all parts of the planes, for example. winglets, rudder, and the tail**. This is what I will try bring me to atleast of the third rank in Aero Engineering. But my dream goal is the master. Because I want this plane to reach it's full realism in Plane Crazy Aviation.
general 2021-11-27 08:20:04 are you ok?

plane-crazy 2022-04-01 12:00:45 Drew a custom car, (I know, weird asf and doesn‚Äôt look bad, just, shit) 

Supposedly I tried to come up with a car that can hover on ground effect, electromagnetic wheels that gets driven by (suspension magnets???? Tf) and at the same time the wheels are also driving the motors inside a tube, which is a fully electric jet engine that keeps the speed of the car when hovering.

The purpose for this concept was to uh, pave the way for 0emission, made to drive fast through American hot landscapes, flat dry surfaces on  some american states. (Also thought this car might as well travel 300-425 mph)

plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:17:04 Trying to keep my sanity when building this thing. it's outragous and painful trying to manage locking.

Unfortunately the wings will need to be thick as a wing panel, I do not know how to make it half block
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:18:23 It's really f*cking painful trying to make a nice wing
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:18:30 that has actual thickness to it
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:18:43 Cuz I have never, ever done a thick delta wing before
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:19:45 yea I already know
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:19:53 I'm just not used to say fucking
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:20:18 even though I have prob said it a couple of times in the past
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:20:20 from rages
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:20:21 lol
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:21:19 Kokamzy, I need your assistance
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:21:39 Need build check from you, Your help to judge if I am still able to make a thick wing
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:21:40 yea
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:22:02 wut
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:22:10 alr
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:24:02 Right now I am having a panic, concerned if I ever will make this complete in 1 week
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:24:27 Normally I build something, and finish it in a total hours of 18-30 hours
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:24:48 My Gabriella took 2 days, 40 hours around
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:25:27 This problem has never occured to me before, because what I worry most is the build space. And it limits me
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:26:25 Lemme just draw of what I have in mind when I started building.
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:30:05 Because when I build, the most effective way for me to build quick and efficiently, or like how could I say this. But I usually am used to patterns, you know? I don't like having a left side front, and right side the tail. I always stack them above each other to folding
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:31:18 When I tried once do one of the more difficult challenegs like making an aircraft fold from next to each other, it always ended up looks like a complete mess
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:39:35 This is the safest way I can come up with, no way can I really make a better wing.
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:39:42 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:44:17 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:44:19 stoopid
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:53:03 XD-70. (<:clueless:942802644043464734> )
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:53:15 nope
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:53:32 Everyone will throw f-bombs when I complete it <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:53:58 It‚Äôs just how it is man <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:54:12 BUT YE ANYWAYS
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:54:17 big project
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:54:48 I need help with wing.
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:54:55 anyone willing to help?
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:54:56 No?
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 14:54:57 Alr.
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:08:34 What do you guys think? accept or judge if this is just terrible as the wing for the XB-70
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:12:29 funny :D
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:12:41 :D
plane-crazy 2022-04-02 15:12:45 nice
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 09:33:56 So I basically drew a custom supersonic intercontinental bomber of my own, I call this : this is the Soviet response to the American XB-70.
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 09:36:05 phew. <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 09:36:09 oh.
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 09:36:29 yea.
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 11:28:24 Then I guess  I will make one basic custom
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 12:08:10 Add multiple Iowa-class main guns around the ship
general 2022-04-04 14:07:06 Guys, is it worth to buy Jetpack gamepass?
general 2022-04-04 14:07:29 Explanation
general 2022-04-04 14:07:41 dumbest shit I have ever heard
general 2022-04-04 14:08:04 No way will I, a typical pathetic little builder have a free perm to get access to Jetpack
general 2022-04-04 14:08:23 A dev like him only talks to the high ranks
general 2022-04-04 14:08:56 What am I suppose to do, how and what should I do to get his attention, and get the jetpack
general 2022-04-04 14:09:17 good idea
general 2022-04-04 14:10:31 is it worth <:thconking:535171057649188865> <:hahaa:773727260539617280> My life savings for this one gamepass. This one little shit
general 2022-04-04 14:10:54 OHOHOH
general 2022-04-04 14:11:00 epic embed fail
general 2022-04-04 14:11:11 half blocks?
general 2022-04-04 14:12:55 U guys have to give a proper reason, I had problems using halfblocks or ladders to builds, but always succeeded. will this improve my building skills? If any of you want to know what things I've built then just dm, and judge if I would get better if I bought the gamepass.
general 2022-04-04 14:13:19 dijadwdsahudw dhuaud hshu hudwa d yes <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2022-04-04 14:13:44 I'm the machine that's talking
general 2022-04-04 14:13:52 oof
general 2022-04-04 14:13:56 Maybe.
general 2022-04-04 14:14:15 I am in full sweat if I should buy the gamepass, it's just not that easy
general 2022-04-04 14:15:10 2 years of demanding jetpack, and finally in this moment, I just can't put my finger on the buy button. What if nothing changes at all, what if I am too pro without jetpack <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
general 2022-04-04 14:16:12 it's fucking, I dunno what to say. It's like choosing to uh
general 2022-04-04 14:16:20 something on something
general 2022-04-04 14:16:50 Boxes
general 2022-04-04 14:16:53 he delivers boxes
general 2022-04-04 14:17:12 School, no. he works with amazon boxes
general 2022-04-04 14:17:31 was that wise said guys?
general 2022-04-04 14:17:48 social media alert
general 2022-04-04 14:17:56 stay safe from sus
general 2022-04-04 14:19:09 oh hell yea, no ice cream for the kids
general 2022-04-04 14:20:07 If you get to be an employee in mcdonalds, that's when you have a chance to play boss. Breaking the ice cream machine is like ruining the russian economy, but with kids
general 2022-04-05 04:41:29 I fucking bought it, this is the coolest fockin shit ever
general 2022-04-05 04:41:36 I feel like ironman after buying the jetpack
general 2022-04-05 04:43:01 Less go
general 2022-04-05 04:43:09 let's take building skills into the next level
general 2022-04-05 04:45:18 holy fucking shit, I can now build how easy as possible
general 2022-04-05 04:45:38 no more will i suffer from falling of blocks when I try to get up when build mode
general 2022-04-05 04:46:00 I have become god (ironman) ultimate
general 2022-04-05 04:46:04 lego ironman
general 2022-04-05 04:47:57 Ok indeed my dude <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2022-04-05 05:10:12 Jetpack was a gift, I underestimated it's capability. It was worth buying it <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 05:16:57 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 05:18:12 dude, u have no idea what I've used when I build before jetpack
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 05:18:44 
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 05:18:58 yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 05:19:26 what?
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 05:20:16 No, but it helps me to NOT suffer from building
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 05:20:33 you know, building ladders, falling down because fat
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 05:20:50 building blocks, but glitches through the blocks when you try to build yourself up
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 05:21:02 or just fail at parkour jump üíÄ

plane-crazy 2022-04-05 08:35:37 Trying to master nose shaping 

With jetpack, less pain
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 08:38:54 So I can see the spots that affect motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 08:39:24 sometimes it's hard for me to see where the motors are and where they uh. ye, already said that
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 08:39:29 so me can see
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 08:40:51 Well, the building technique I'm using is kinda inspired from an old youtuber I used to watch alot
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 08:44:14 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTVHn5J0ZVEsKDtKyf4ct2g Known as "Conscripted Alchemist", a Warship Craft professional builder. And his tutorials were different compared to others, being more distinct when adding/deleting by using diff colours to sort of show where he adds blocks.
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 08:44:46 shortened for Conscripted Alchemist.
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 08:44:49 yes

plane-crazy 2022-04-05 08:47:50 me sad he had to quit due to popularity downfall
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 08:48:07 Cuz the game was stopped from development
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 08:48:21 I hope Plane Crazy does not <:4Weird:709084058721714324>

plane-crazy 2022-04-05 11:33:32 Well I know the nose is wrong, but I'm really trying to fit everything to shape the sides. and unfortunately I realised also that the cockpit, or the body is a bit thick. cuz the cockpit is high when measuring to images
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 11:53:55 Do any of you know how to pro skin for aircrafts? need help
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 12:17:24 How do I even make another line?
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 12:17:52 the windows are a bit off, what I'm trying to do is that missing line, to finish the cockpit window
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 12:18:32 
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 12:20:04 One and only option, do I have to use camera to tilt a trail?
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 12:23:07 **sigh**
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 12:25:56 i tried wingpanels
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 12:25:59 they looks terrible
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 12:26:06 looked*
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 12:26:32 because they peaked out through the black when I had white wedged wing panel
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 12:26:39 I mean
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 12:26:40 shit
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 12:26:44 delta wing panel.
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 12:26:53 or just aka delta wing
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 12:27:03 my brain is fried

plane-crazy 2022-04-05 17:08:56 I mean
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 17:09:04 many people have done it, theirs sucks
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 17:33:32 every person who built their restaurant, fast food restaurant or even a cafe. has said that
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 17:33:41 and they add things like "my restaurant has lights"
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 17:33:48 "look at this, I have good plates"
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 17:34:02 or "look at the drive thru, so shut up. Ur plane noob"

plane-crazy 2022-04-05 19:00:49 That shredder ball guy think he pro cuz he can kill easy
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 19:01:12 he gay, and no family
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 19:01:15 never wife
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:05:09 yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:06:10 This nose was bad, due to being short. and when looking at blueprints it was kinda hot garbage
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:06:44 So I had to lengthen it
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:07:00 yes, totally
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:07:16 Or even better, titanic
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:08:53 now the nose is longer
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:09:05 still kinda bad, cuz it looks more like a ducks beak
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:09:18 
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:09:31 The tip is already perfect, the cockpit window is the only problem
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:10:49 It's going to be very complex with the locking cuz everything is basic, it's like... motor 1 locking, but extreme complex and almost no space to configure/correct the shape
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:11:12 
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:11:30 I don't want to take up more space
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:11:46 Or else I will bump into another problem

plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:12:38 I don't wanna do the same mistake like the engineers did
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:12:54 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:13:25 Uh... the back of the aircraft will be on top half of the buildings space and the rest(wings and engines) at the bottom
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:13:40 they are already black
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:14:12 Do you mean Legacy, is legacy the right windows?
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:14:27 Cuz rn they are already black
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:14:34 they can't get any blacker than black
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 09:14:51 it's already the blackest they can get

plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:24:20 I rate ur creation as ‚Äùuseless‚Äù
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:25:28 Use engine thrust to vector around at the very back, sorta like. Use rocket to control while the wingpanels are not controllable
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:25:39 simple
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:25:48 good
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:25:59 Oh and btw, u have more roles than me

plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:29:34 Hm. I make a task for you : build a missile that is capable to be effective as possible, must be : 3x3 by width and height MAX, 15 blocks by length
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:30:06 Ah wait
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:30:10 I meant.
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:30:14 Well, not about payload
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:30:21 About destruction
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:30:29 You can motorlock btw
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:30:30 Ur alloed
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:30:33 Allowed*
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:30:47 But if spawned, it must be 3x3 on width and height
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:31:48 That is the sexiest Stuka I have ever seen, looks at that thick greenish body.
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:32:01 I say yes

plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:42:41 Idc if exposed, he atleast achieved goal to make the aircraft look good
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:42:50 Ignore exposed motor and then all happy

plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:43:19 I men

plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:44:25 Or else am exposed
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:45:27 I like how he managed to make a good looking toy box for his bus but the bus itself looks kinda bad
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:45:54 What u mean
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:45:59 Oh right forgot
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:46:07 I can see he will motorlock the bus
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:46:10 alr.
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:46:26 This
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:46:44 I underestimated him.
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:46:49 I apologies
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:46:58 Hello?
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:47:13 Nvm
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:47:16 We not friends
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:47:20 Cuz : stupido
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:47:35 True
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:48:05 Cuz that‚Äôs when the mega builder gods are not awake
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:48:18 So that they cannot see our creations and criticise us
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 13:48:52 Only camera locking, but sometimes motors too, cuz uh. 60% is just motor around my building space
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 17:01:10 LETS FAKKIN GOOO, it's taking shape. Everything works, all needed is to fix and work with the wings to make them look smoother. (so fucking hyped even tho I haven't drinked anything)
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 17:33:07 I know.
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 17:33:09 But hey

plane-crazy 2022-04-08 17:46:14 2.0
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 17:53:13 Lets fucking go
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 17:57:07 
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 17:57:20 Those things can really fold, wew
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 17:58:27 
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 17:58:46 shit quality.... perfect
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 18:00:12 Shit... forgot how I should do with the engines, the intakes-
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 18:00:18 How am I gonna fit them
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 18:00:28 nvm got it
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 18:00:34 sike
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 18:01:08 esactly <:clueless:942802644043464734>

plane-crazy 2022-04-08 18:01:21 exactly*
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:15:42 Lol, I tried for the first time to make some kind of a "compare to improve shape" and so I did. well, I am no professional when it comes to accuracy, but this is just how I do things (my way) <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:16:25 Sean Mendes

plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:16:55 B)
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:16:56 wait
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:16:58 shit.
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:17:07 yea I kinda expected that
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:17:17 scratch that
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:17:19 ignore
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:17:25 Pretend I did not exist
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:17:39 no
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:17:41 it not based
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:17:43 am trying
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:17:48 to replicate
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:17:58 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:18:08 It's 65% done
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:18:17 I mean, in progress
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:20:02 EXACTLY
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:20:06 FINALLY SOMEONE SAID IT
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:20:20 Xb-70, looking like some kind of paper plane
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:23:39 wtf
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:23:50 he's doin it on purpose bruh.
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:24:00 fucking cringing to death
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:24:08 Nah, both
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:24:12 trying to be funny
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:24:13 and
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:24:22 flex by his look
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:26:02 
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:26:33 I quick folded, that is why the back looks cracked
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:28:03 
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:28:24 drew yellow line to kinda show the correction.
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:29:03 omgggg
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:29:05 A HIGH RANK
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:29:06 ah yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:29:09 thank you
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:29:35 u are also high rank
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:29:38 but the other
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:29:39 eh
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:29:40 higher
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:29:59 You guys prob see me as a peasant lol <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:31:02 wait what the
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:31:03 how?
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:31:13 expert shipwr.
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:31:20 how tf is that possible
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:31:34 I thought I didn't meet any of those requirements when I requested ranks
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:31:37 I met none
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:32:16 I for example sent these two
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:32:40 And I said "well.. they have helium, around 50 blocks of helium"
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:33:18 and the guy who took care of the request was like "that's shit. Take that shit away, Ima just give you only expert rank"
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:34:09 Cuz they have been extremely fucking critizised before?
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:34:36 Wait, have any of you even seen the pcc reaction when I introduced those ships?
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:34:48 what the fuck
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:34:53 Like, half a year ago
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:35:16 ah yes, I am gonna call this classic (official)
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:35:43 this looks hella clean
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:36:04 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:36:14 Those two ships are mine
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:36:24 Both in one building slot
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:36:29 not two accounts
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:36:55 Ohohoh you should have seen when I showed them in a diff pic (cinematic view)
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:37:05 I got really f-bombed
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:37:16 Death threats almost
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:37:21 but what can I say
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:38:21 For example, getting criticised when I showed a custom concept design I made based on paper
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:38:41 "ugliest canopy design ever, exposed motorlock"
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:38:47 It's not even canopy
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:39:01 It's a nut shell (shield) covering the pilot
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:39:17 and the shell can rotate like a gyroscope
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:39:57 no well
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:40:07 The landing gears were successfully intact
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:40:15 or tuck in (idk how to pronounce it)
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:40:24 yeah..
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:40:30 I am scared bruh
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:40:50 Imagine, Plane Crazy vs Stormworks or any other building game
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:40:59 Plane Crazy must have the most advanced thinkers
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:41:48 I have huge doubt that Plane Crazy is yet to be a lego game, but also contains one of the best people playing the game
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:42:01 Noone even says "I agree"
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:42:11 they just "neh."
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:42:37 Btw
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:42:43 I always think competetive
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:42:50 (can't spell)
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:43:10 Cuz, idk if it's true
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:43:23 but does it really take 2-4 months to build a perfect vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:44:52 many has been building vehicles that takes 2-6 months
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:45:06 I always thought I was among the best out there, to speedrun builds
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:45:10 taking around 2 days
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:45:25 but No, I think quality is more important than quanititty?
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:46:02 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:46:10 no way, that long?!
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:46:27 My Viking Line Gabriella took 2-3 days
plane-crazy 2022-04-08 19:46:38 total 30-40 hours
general 2022-04-09 09:26:08 This guy is mocking and judging deep on my retail lmao
general 2022-04-09 09:26:23 What do you guys think?
general 2022-04-09 09:27:18 My retail is a box, ofcourse he dislikes that. But the interior also he doesn't like when his (over the otherside of my retail) looks worse ._.
general 2022-04-09 09:28:08 
general 2022-04-09 09:28:24 Is a nice **b o x**
general 2022-04-09 09:28:37 I dont have it yet.
general 2022-04-09 09:28:41 am sed.
general 2022-04-09 09:29:27 His retail
general 2022-04-09 09:30:41 Maybe that's why he speaks in a very aggressive way
general 2022-04-09 09:30:56 lgtbq person be like :
general 2022-04-09 09:31:01 lol
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 13:11:18 It fucking works guys, motorlocking. muah, finally mastering over it
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 13:11:36 shit quality, but still, that's the good shit I get
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 13:55:19 
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 13:55:40 testing the bottom half
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 13:55:44 yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 13:55:46 goose
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 14:01:14 Do you guys have any ideas when it comes to custom engine design?
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 14:01:38 I don't want to use basic engines cuz then I will look like a lazy person
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 14:03:04 drawying those circles cuz yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 14:04:18 Anyone?
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 14:05:18 <:EYES:525319504721608705>
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 14:31:07 Alright, the wing design may be terrible because of the gaps. I know many prefer no gaps, but how am I suppose to make functional control surfaces for the wings
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 14:31:25 I can't use rockets to **pull up** or get down
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 14:31:58 Yea, motorlock. but how am I gonna control
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 14:32:03 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 14:33:22 It's just that, I want to have actual control surfaces, panels that moves. But I know some of you knows how to making advanced locked wings that can actually show some control surfaces without them getting stuck
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 14:41:37 ye
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 14:41:57 I can only make smooth wing surfaces if atleast 1 block wide
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 14:44:26 On wings without gaps?
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 14:44:37 Making a gapless wing?
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 14:44:44 gapless working wing
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 14:46:35 Very ineffective, the plane will not be able to move smoothly
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 14:47:20 wdym interesting?
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 16:09:13 *(flying with some piston engined aircraft)*
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 16:09:21 no engines added yet
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 16:09:22 and the uh
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 16:12:01 Aint possible when i try it in a most genius way possible
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 16:12:15 possible doesn't add, if the impossible is impossible
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 16:12:20 impostorous.
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 16:12:56 High standards, I get it
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 16:13:02 I am not good at anything bruh
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 16:13:31 Just so you're aware. don't expect too much from me ;-;
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 16:13:36 thenks
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:16:51 getting it ready by repainting and finalizing touches (engines are not added yet and will soon)
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:17:29 Remaking a little and painting the beak
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:18:22 The motorlocks
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:18:27 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:18:55 painting the motors and disconnectors to, motors as yellow and disconnectors red
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:19:15 so that I can see critical spots when I test fold
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:19:59 And just like the mod demanded
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:20:02 no helium
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:20:12 This is fully no ballast or helium
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:20:52 see
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:21:38 Am gonna mach. 3 this aircraft
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:22:47 And use it in PvP, as my very first (actually 4th) bomber to take place in saving slot, and to replace my previous bomber which was 1-2 years old (a WW2 bomber)
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:22:57 yea I know, chill
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:23:40 wdym
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:25:13 ok <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:49:16 Bruh
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:49:20 Look, the nose is different
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:49:33 It is some kind of rubber?
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:49:36 hard rubber?
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:50:07 It's like concorde...... Instead of retracting a droop snoot, somewhat it can pump from inside?
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:50:40 idk what makes sense of that, I looked at multiple images of XB-70, the noses are all different
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:50:47 I mean, two different shapes
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:50:51 shapes of beak
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:51:11 that looks more aerodynamic.
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:52:45 Hmm..... you're prob right
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:52:50 Two diff proto-
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:52:53 OH RIGHT.
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:52:54 I forgot
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:53:05 he said that the second prototype succeeded on goals
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:53:10 the first was less capable
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:53:28 Meaning that this one. was... maybe the second?
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:54:17 that is a nice looking Mig
plane-crazy 2022-04-09 17:54:20 Mayhbe too fat

general 2022-04-11 12:38:02 U guys do it in smaller complex

general 2022-04-19 09:06:39 <@404632014189494293> Hey koko
general 2022-04-19 09:06:48 permission to join
general 2022-04-19 09:07:50 Nobody questions how it's possible to fit those planes in those small building plots
general 2022-04-19 09:08:05 imagine one piece of a wing
general 2022-04-19 09:08:23 same width/length as the whole box of the plot
general 2022-04-19 09:08:30 and thickness of 1-5 blocks
general 2022-04-19 09:08:44 multiple?
general 2022-04-19 09:08:56 you mean like, different people put their pieces into one single plane
general 2022-04-19 09:09:00 what about the lag
general 2022-04-19 09:10:15 Yea I know
general 2022-04-19 09:10:44 That wing must be in total of 5-7 pieces of flat platforms in building space, same height and length as the building space. and in total they would take 10 blocks wide space
general 2022-04-19 09:12:20 and the main body, the fuselage is like... mid part, and the tail inside the mid part... and the tail wings.... Ok I am fucking losing cells. How is that possible
general 2022-04-19 09:13:19 I could draw a design of how their layout might look in buildmode
general 2022-04-19 09:13:53 Cuz It's just fucking insane of what the sizes of each piece must be, and possibly fold without any miscalculations

general 2022-04-20 14:43:48 ü•∞
general 2022-04-20 14:45:05 but also nightchaser, cuz he mega legend builder
general 2022-04-20 14:45:10 lol
general 2022-04-20 14:45:32 Idk, I followed some of ur steps when it come to advancement
general 2022-04-20 14:46:38 I could make a smol list of people here who helped me to improve over the past‚Ä¶. 1 and a half year, maybe 2 years
general 2022-04-20 14:46:46 But no
general 2022-04-20 14:47:31 Gud
general 2022-04-20 14:48:19 However am still looking for help with the engines, and not a professional who talks like he is reading a bible
general 2022-04-20 14:48:41 Speed of well‚Ä¶ I crossed the 1k speed barrier
general 2022-04-20 14:48:44 That‚Äôs nice

general 2022-04-20 14:49:00 no
general 2022-04-20 14:49:41 Engine in buildmode / how am I suppose to fit a nice custom made engine
general 2022-04-20 14:52:52 Alr.
general 2022-04-20 14:53:08 Two main issues I stumbled upon
general 2022-04-20 14:53:25 I miscalculated the wings
general 2022-04-20 14:53:52 The wings I built was likw 95% of the actual length and width
general 2022-04-20 14:54:25 And the tips the wings cousl fold a full 90
general 2022-04-20 14:54:58 When in Mustard‚Äôs vid, he says it could do a full 65
general 2022-04-20 14:55:20 My can do a full 90. Rip.
general 2022-04-20 14:55:33 Xb-70
general 2022-04-20 14:57:38 That‚Äôs a nice cat, u guys pay attention to the hand?????? üò≥üò≥üò≥‚Ä¶ u gay homo???!?!?!

general 2022-04-20 15:00:10 It‚Äôs atleast better now
general 2022-04-20 15:00:25 Cuz I correc the canards
general 2022-04-20 15:00:30 Fixed the back tail
general 2022-04-20 15:00:35 And reworked the nose
general 2022-04-20 15:00:44 And trying now to pit landing gears
general 2022-04-20 15:00:50 Gtg
general 2022-04-20 15:00:51 I have
general 2022-04-20 15:00:53 Screentime
general 2022-04-20 15:00:59 ü•≤üëåüèª
general 2022-04-20 15:01:04 It will
general 2022-04-20 15:32:53 üò≥
general 2022-04-21 05:07:44 Quick drawing for another concept I had in mind, a full 50-55 degree wing sweep or whatever it‚Äôs called. Reduces more less drag, the whole design allows it to hover, ground-effect. Prioriticed purposes for this aircraft: ground attack against sea vessels and stationary land bases that are located closer to sea and air combat.

*the drawing is a first‚Ä¶ prototype, I am trying to figure out how efficient the aircraft can improve if I redrew the wings*
general 2022-04-21 07:00:46 It may look heavy
general 2022-04-21 07:01:26 But just like coleoptere,  a lot of air sucks into the intakes
general 2022-04-21 07:04:33 the full wing sweep is focused to make the aircraft fly mach 2-3
general 2022-04-21 07:05:01 So the weight of the aircraft will not be something you'd worry about
general 2022-04-21 07:06:53 Not intakes on the coleoptere, but the intakes on my design are suppose to look big, so that they might behave like a long pair set bi-plane/powerful engines.
general 2022-04-21 07:07:15 Hard to say what I mean they are meant to do
general 2022-04-21 07:08:08 that sounds terrible
general 2022-04-21 07:08:12 just.... awful
general 2022-04-21 07:09:24 SES-11 (a new signature?) SES.

general 2022-04-21 13:41:20 An average of the noobest players in this community are like. 2018-2019 style ‚Äùgood beginner‚Äù player
general 2022-04-21 13:41:37 While everyone here are like higher standard
general 2022-04-21 13:42:17 If someone who would post a decent, not so much motorlock build, all shape and control surfaces basic but smooth and correct, everyone would downvote cuz of high standards

general 2022-04-21 13:47:53 The experience I have right now and can compare is closely to KSP2 lol
general 2022-04-21 13:47:59 It‚Äôs like waiting for years
general 2022-04-21 13:48:33 KSP2 and PC2 are like, the same situation
general 2022-04-21 13:48:51 Lol
general 2022-04-21 13:49:02 I will evolve
general 2022-04-21 13:49:06 Become hero myself
general 2022-04-21 13:49:09 And and‚Ä¶.
general 2022-04-21 13:49:11 Gone
general 2022-04-21 13:49:28 Ye
general 2022-04-21 13:54:19 Wait wait from what I understand, before 2020: excellent builders, low to medium standards, respectable players/users, pro people talk nicely to less experienced players

After 2020: popularity rapidly increased, community got filled with many brainless noobs, the pros and god builders in the community turned toxic or left. People get banned for very‚Ä¶ unusual behaviour.

Right?
general 2022-04-21 13:54:31 Cuz I was here since 2019
general 2022-04-21 13:54:39 But joined the game around 2018
general 2022-04-21 13:55:27 Sigh‚Ä¶
general 2022-04-21 13:56:15 And from what I thought, turning 2020 horizontally upside down into a JOJO meme‚Ä¶
general 2022-04-21 13:57:06 I joined as a alone builder
general 2022-04-21 13:57:17 Reason I came here, honestly- to flex <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
general 2022-04-21 13:57:24 But people evolved a lot faster
general 2022-04-21 13:57:33 So I became like a rotten metal
general 2022-04-21 14:01:10 Imagine the future, we can either have the first prediction, people evolve, game popularity is stable, tutorials become less of something u can simply copy of and not learn anything.

**or.**
More noobs join, first thing they do, large box of rocket engines, two, joining pvp, easily gets destroyed and somewhat, no brain at all, knows what a shredderbug is and searches for easy tutorial that their tiny peanut brain can understand. Join in pvp game again, win over other players, and call themselves champs and throw toxic language at everyone
general 2022-04-21 14:03:05 **+** if the toxic noob shredder user loses a argument, he salty and looks at tutorial again on how to make *multiple* shredder bugs, or even worse, **AN UPGRADE..!!!1!1!**, they make shredder ball, or a shredder horde
general 2022-04-21 14:03:34 Lmao
general 2022-04-21 14:03:52 And they say ‚Äùbut It‚Äôs mine, cuz I paint it black!1!1!!‚Äù
