help 2020-08-20 07:47:38 With my railgun I have I set the magnets to lose parts only, so the magnets will only effect the bullet that aint attached to the build

help 2020-08-20 07:53:26 With the railgun I have it uses pretty small ammo
help 2020-08-20 07:53:32 1x1 tnt balls

help 2020-08-20 07:55:43 Sorry I couldnt help
general 2020-08-21 20:28:36 You can simply add another motor litterly
general 2020-08-21 20:28:50 Just put a block or two inbetween so they dont break time and space
the-dump 2020-08-22 05:46:42 This is cursed beyond comprehension
bug-reports 2020-08-22 10:43:34 Looks like your heli had a egg

creations-chat 2020-09-17 16:45:24 Usually ballast

the-dump 2020-09-21 00:17:12 Eeeee
help 2020-09-27 19:53:14 It honestly is, the only thing it actually effects is if your plane flys straight
help 2020-09-27 19:53:20 which is easily fixed with a ballast block
creations-chat 2020-10-21 20:55:31 okay
creations-chat 2020-10-21 21:13:55 I am curious tho, why the hell do people like my damn drink stand more than the actuall APC that houses the drink stand
creations-chat 2020-10-21 21:15:12 or litterly any of my other things
creations-chat 2020-10-21 21:20:55 Makes sense lol, I agree my turrets are pretty crappy at the moment
creations-chat 2020-10-21 21:23:06 Why is people arguing a problem?
creations-chat 2020-10-21 21:24:08 Alright makes sense
creations-chat 2020-10-21 21:25:53 <@!342402058994974730>  A few months, tho I just look at the creations and contest stuff (usually)
general 2020-10-21 21:29:43 Looks delicious
creations-chat 2020-10-24 05:04:03 How does this look for a custom airship frame so far?
creations-chat 2020-10-24 05:05:05 I make it darker so I can see better
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 18:53:50 Anyone else having issues with physics?
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 18:54:06 Ive noticed a heli propeller design ive been using for awhile doesnt work as well anymore
help 2020-11-01 20:19:16 Except for fire engines and things like that do water jets have a purpose?
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 05:59:43 Im curious, has anyone made a mech fully work without helium? or any sort of thrusters?
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 06:10:35 Im doing something similar to that rn and getting it to somewhat walk rn
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 06:10:43 without any helium
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 06:11:18 I was watching the Minator mech from no mans sky and I got the idea to litterly tilt the top of the body so it balances on one leg while moving the other one
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 06:16:34 nvm aint workin lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 06:47:13 Aight
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 07:09:31 ive reached 90 thousand before spinning out
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 07:10:17 when my suspension implodes I reach whatever 16e is
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 07:10:22 17e
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 07:10:27 one of those two numbers
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 07:14:09 without using helium or your build imploding ive reached 130 thousand
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 07:14:19 after 90 thousand it gets redicoulis to control tho
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 07:14:30 like not possible from what I know
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 07:16:58 only 223 thousand?
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 07:17:46 makes more sense lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 07:22:11 okay so I basically go to the next multiverse when I reach whatever 17e is
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 03:09:54 I just found out one density is the same as 4 blocks in weight
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 23:08:50 bro at first I thought that was photoshopped

plane-crazy 2021-01-12 15:10:04 Heres the carcass of my WIP mobile base in a pvp server
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 15:10:48 it used to be 4000 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 07:46:27 if you ever wondered what the inside of the tarmac looks like
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 07:49:37 the part you spawn, litterly inside of the base
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 07:49:57 I just attatched some motor locking to a anchor and bam, tho when I jump I get teleported to the surface
creations-chat 2021-02-20 16:25:58 Opinions on how I blended the thrusters with the rest of the build?
creations-chat 2021-02-20 16:28:04 because yes rotor, it looks better while its actually spinning, and its a heli- sort of <@!705533053740777584> I will think about it
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 16:52:44 Has anyone made a mech that doest need helium or thrusters to move?
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 16:53:09 what in the godamn hell
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 16:55:42 okay what about 2 legged?
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 17:31:37 alright so I was gonna make a new combat airship but this one just didnt fit that, anyone have ideas of what I should do with this?
plane-crazy 2021-02-20 17:40:16 thats actually a good idea
creations-chat 2021-02-26 01:50:01 Anyone want to give feedback on my abomination of a vtol?
creations-chat 2021-02-26 01:52:12 bro I can somewhat understand people downvoting my vtol but that one?
creations-chat 2021-02-26 01:54:15 exatlats "Dragonfly" RDEA VTOL, like whats wrong with that one
creations-chat 2021-02-27 19:24:10 <@!168586098895749120>  Have you live tested it? And if so did it go well?
creations-chat 2021-02-27 19:26:42 gotcha, did you take out many shredder bugs?
creations-chat 2021-02-27 19:28:50 If its the regular type shredder and multiple ive made a tank that can do it, granted its laggy because its armoured with 200 of the 2000 blocks on it being cutters, but ive fought off a group of 3 or 4 before
creations-chat 2021-02-27 19:32:15 Eeeeeee- yeah thats the cost of making something thats anti shredder capable, gotta use mostly 1 x 1 blocks and not too many 1 x 4 so you dont get killed quickly lol
creations-chat 2021-02-27 19:34:36 and thats assuming they dont blacklist you
creations-chat 2021-03-03 23:15:35 Opinions on cockpit? (excluding for the color, will be added later) (also the seat behind me is the most advanced communication system you will ever see)
creations-chat 2021-03-03 23:17:36 First person view
creations-chat 2021-03-03 23:39:08 Alright added a bit more controls and dials and stuffs (sending a picture of improved communications system shortly) <@!719168864705052802>
creations-chat 2021-03-03 23:41:25 The cockpit and then this is the communication seat
general 2021-03-03 23:41:59 <@!553018204625043458>  look further back in creations feedback its my plane cockpit

plane-crazy 2021-03-10 23:59:18 has anyone made a propeller with the total length of the propeller being 21  blocks or less lift 1440 blocks?
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 23:59:22 or more
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 00:41:32 This chat perfectly explains how annoying exactly what we do is
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 00:43:02 things like that is why I prioritize speed in all my pvp builds
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 00:43:09 well usually
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 00:43:59 fair enough
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 01:49:10 not even joking I have littery gotton a headache by making a completely custom propeller in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 01:50:37 look in the settings and it will be named something along the names of camera mode
plane-crazy 2021-03-14 23:49:38 Theres not much too a dice in the first place
bot-central 2021-03-14 23:52:15 !servers

general 2021-03-15 00:14:12 My brain when im trying to focus on ridiculously complicated things:
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 00:27:57 bro why is the damn creations feedback timer so damn long
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 00:28:01 it makes me want to not use it at all
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 00:28:34 Why dont we just ban them from that channel then instead of making it a pain for all the other people
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 00:29:01 I guess
creations-chat 2021-03-15 00:31:57 Should I scrap this thing thats been sitting unfinished in my build area for months or actually attempt to finish it?
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 00:32:14 Still seems like there should be something better we could do
creations-chat 2021-03-15 00:34:46 same thing with this castle wall
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 00:39:42 welp then I will learn to live with it then

plane-crazy 2021-03-25 03:24:52 
creations-chat 2021-04-02 00:15:09 Update on Nuclear Reactor for my totally safe and low block count tank
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 22:57:16 did they remove the reduced lag update?
general 2021-05-18 01:49:58 huh?
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 20:28:02 Is it against the rules to lets say use a glitch contraption to yeet another persons build into oblivion?
help 2021-05-29 00:44:41 anyone else having issues of motor 2s having alot less torque?
plane-crazy 2021-05-30 17:38:35 help my jet looks like a sub and controls like a bi-plane and cant stall
plane-crazy 2021-06-03 22:34:24 aint this just lovely
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:10:30 maybe now that rick has to redo the terrain that they will make a new map
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:11:04 its a theory
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:11:12 I just woke up and had a thought
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:11:18 and hopes
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:11:27 is he actually gonna add a new map? (prob not)
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:12:31 to fix the no clipping
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:12:37 oh
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:12:40 yeah the whole map is uh
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:13:05 for some reason one of my friends isnt effected at all
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:14:00 if you have autosave on theres a chance it saved it
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:14:25 then you prob still have the build saved in the autosave slot
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:15:04 XD
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:16:36 really makes me question what actually broke
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:17:38 most likely code, hopefully made some types of terrain no longer have collision
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:17:53 so he'll be forced to make a new map anyways
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:18:11 oh the broken map
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:18:19 and in what ways its broken
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:18:35 we are hoping its broken in such a way he has to redo the map and he will make a new one
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:20:16 as long as it gets here I dont care too much
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:21:01 better terrain now that I know how to make good suspension
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:22:26 can we knock down the trees?
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:22:53 good, I will knock down a tree then absolutely yeet a tree at them
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:23:47 maybe a large cave system
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:24:02 and a actual mountain with a airfield on it
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:24:22 we dont he just make the new map a island surrounded in water
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:24:38 uh- sure we could go with harem
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:24:54 good sir-
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:25:00 you spelt "haram" wrong
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:25:03 its harem not haram

plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:26:23 yes do it
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:26:36 write down your hopes and dreams for them to be crushed by rick
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:27:19 wait- what if rick put in slowly moving clouds like 10k up
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:27:27 but there was actually things on them
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 13:27:32 and you could land on em

plane-crazy 2023-01-15 23:03:51 specifically in PVP
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 23:04:07 I found out the hard way rockets/firework cannons backfire quickly
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 23:04:10 alright fair enough
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 23:06:06 that shall be my last resort option
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 23:06:15 as of now I'm going to build a large chainsaw riddled with cutter blocks
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 23:06:21 and slap it on a boat
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 23:06:45 LOL
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 23:12:11 Yeah pretty much
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 21:07:20 is higher dampening quicker suspension movement or slower suspension movement?
