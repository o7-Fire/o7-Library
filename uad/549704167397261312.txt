bug-reports 2022-08-04 08:01:47 Ok so,this problem has happened to me recently and to other players,someone made a video about it 8 months ago,and its that when my build is stopped the rockets launch and appear,but once its moving,the rockets dont work
bug-reports 2022-08-04 10:16:52 Ive tried to play on both browser and microsoft store version,doesnt work
bug-reports 2022-08-04 10:17:16 Ive tried changing the places in which the rockets are,doesnt work
bug-reports 2022-08-04 10:17:30 This has happened me yesterday and today
bug-reports 2022-08-04 11:17:49 So i just play the game without being able to shoot missiles,fireworks etc?
bug-reports 2022-08-04 19:42:01 Ok so my problem of being unable to shoot missiles while moving its still there,it seems that it has happened to more people and that it fixes by itself,but i dont know how much time it will take,maybe days,maybe weeks,maybe months,idk

bug-reports 2022-08-05 12:50:59 Same to me,i have seen other with the same problem,they say its gone with time
bug-reports 2022-08-05 12:51:11 Yet there is not any way to fix it except waiting
