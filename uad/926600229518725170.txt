The Tale of cowrekted (926600229518725170)
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 04:28:53 Greetings
general 2022-07-02 04:37:51 Who remembers the days when World War Two fighters were the size of airliners
general 2022-07-02 04:38:30 Before motor lock dimwit
creations-chat 2022-07-02 05:08:35 Why do people go crazy over one or two details
general 2022-07-02 17:20:46 Because vtol fighters have limitations, like the marines are now just retiring the harrier, which I may remind you is subsonic, and you need entirely new control systems for a vtol jet, and a pilot has to know how to vertically land, and vtol jets are only practical on small airfields and amphibious assault ships
general 2022-07-02 17:22:29 And the replacement
general 2022-07-02 17:22:47 The F-35B and F-35C aren’t even vtol
general 2022-07-02 17:22:53 They are stovl
general 2022-07-02 17:23:06 The harrier still has its place
general 2022-07-02 17:23:20 It’s like the Navies A-10
general 2022-07-02 17:23:42 An Harrier can take a huge beating
general 2022-07-02 17:23:50 I’ve heard stories from marines about it
general 2022-07-02 17:24:04 Like in real life
general 2022-07-02 17:24:12 At a military base
general 2022-07-02 17:25:30 Except vtol is complex
general 2022-07-02 17:25:38 Both in real life and in pc
general 2022-07-02 17:25:52 Small airfields and amphibious assault ships
general 2022-07-02 17:26:12 But both can be obtained by Stovl
general 2022-07-02 17:26:25 Battleships have been retired since the late 90’s
general 2022-07-02 17:26:33 Small planes
general 2022-07-02 17:27:04 I mean they can still be practical surprisingly enough
general 2022-07-02 17:27:17 For bombarding the coast and naval fleets
general 2022-07-02 17:28:25 Battleships can do that as well
general 2022-07-02 17:28:30 Modernized ones cans
general 2022-07-02 17:28:40 Not on battleships
general 2022-07-02 17:28:51 Even a World War Two battleship can be super precise
general 2022-07-02 17:29:09 Inside a battleship there is a plotting room filled with computers
general 2022-07-02 17:29:16 CIWS
general 2022-07-02 17:29:23 And missiles
general 2022-07-02 17:29:34 Or modernized BOFORS
general 2022-07-02 17:29:40 Such as the l76
general 2022-07-02 17:29:48 Which is a modernized version of the 40mm
general 2022-07-02 17:30:52 All the people in the turret do are load the shells, the range finding in there is backup
general 2022-07-02 17:32:44 Well yes but no
general 2022-07-02 17:33:02 It would’ve been good if it existed in the early 60s
general 2022-07-02 17:33:54 Not really
general 2022-07-02 17:34:06 Because
general 2022-07-02 17:34:18 16 inch cannons could devastate anything in its path
general 2022-07-02 17:34:27 Even 14 inch cannons could
general 2022-07-02 17:35:05 Hypersonic cruise missiles could be shot down by defense systems
creations-chat 2022-07-02 17:37:17 I agree
general 2022-07-02 17:37:43 Upgrade the defense
general 2022-07-02 17:37:50 Or travel in groups
general 2022-07-02 17:38:01 Two support destroyers could overwhelm attack systems
general 2022-07-02 17:39:41 Hypersonic missiles can be intercepted
general 2022-07-02 17:41:33 Looks like an F8F with a spitfire or p51 engine on it
general 2022-07-02 17:43:10 They’re good for attacking nations without the ability to defend themselves
general 2022-07-02 17:43:21 And they could be a platform for rail guns
general 2022-07-02 17:44:35 F8F bearcat, but why the rocket booster and what happened to the bubble cockpit
general 2022-07-02 17:44:46 Until you add railguns
general 2022-07-02 17:45:13 What’s with Ryan and making weird aircraft
general 2022-07-02 17:45:54 Look at the X-13 vertijet
general 2022-07-02 18:19:05 My name is Gustavo, but you can call me sus
creations-chat 2022-07-03 18:46:17 One block wide planes are fine, it’s better than looking chonky
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 00:18:08 Question
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 00:18:20 What would be considered spam in building?
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 00:22:00 I mean wouldn’t this guys plane be spam
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 00:26:56 I used my iPads screenshot ability
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 00:27:01 Snip and sketch should work
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 00:27:10 For windows
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 00:27:34 Or if your using a full keyboard hit print screen/ system requirements
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:34:53 Tutorials themselves are broken
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:35:10 They honestly should be based on mechanisms rather than whole creations
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:35:18 Or building techniques
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:35:52 Am I wrong?
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:39:05 Tutorials probably slowed down the development of plane crazy builds
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:39:41 https://tenor.com/view/society-when-yuno-is-banned-gif-20948027
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:39:53 Pc without block to block tutorials
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:40:21 We all have
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:44:10 Anyone who uses this as a jet should go to the facility
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:44:49 It’s some crappy fighter every noob uses
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:44:56 It’s a tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:45:59 And if you say it’s good you should go to “summer camp”
plane-crazy 2022-07-11 05:46:34 Siberian summer camp of course
general 2022-07-11 05:55:16 No only the ones that look like Myusernamesthis
general 2022-07-11 05:58:20 If you buy bacon accessories go to papa Stalins summer camp in Siberia
general 2022-07-11 05:58:36 If your just a normal bacon go on
general 2022-07-11 05:58:57 Based
general 2022-07-11 05:59:21 Bacons and slenders should go to papa stalins summer camp in Siberia
general 2022-07-11 05:59:58 No
general 2022-07-11 06:00:27 They should go to my Argentinian grandpas all year around camp in Poland
general 2022-07-11 06:02:15 Hmm. That’s interesting the peoples secret police would like to have a chat about possible relocation now
general 2022-07-11 06:03:20 No, call papa Trudeau
general 2022-07-11 06:04:09 Papa Trudeau will send you to ski camp, with syrup mining
general 2022-07-11 06:06:02 Me: says one piece of criticism to a furry or any other mid group Roblox: **Off to Trudeaus ski camp with you**
general 2022-07-11 06:06:48 Trudeau s ski camp also has syrup mining
general 2022-07-11 06:07:58 Then you will be sent to Serbian summer camp
general 2022-07-11 06:09:25 Ong
general 2022-07-11 06:09:47 The idle animation is ok but every other animation is cringe
general 2022-07-11 06:09:51 For og

general 2022-07-11 06:11:00 Search up trash on roblox
general 2022-07-11 06:11:42 I mean it’s gotten a tad better since parties were removed
general 2022-07-11 06:12:29 True
general 2022-07-11 06:12:54 I mean if you want a family friendly experience play club roblox or adopt me
general 2022-07-11 06:13:41 I only play club roblox to troll at the pizza place and steal everyone’s pay
general 2022-07-11 06:14:06 Who cares about treads

general 2022-07-11 06:18:22 Good job
general 2022-07-11 06:18:42 Cow cow was right, all valk wearers need an 80% tax

general 2022-07-12 17:50:59 The Burberry one I think
general 2022-07-14 08:39:06 Imperial Japanese Army vs slenders
general 2022-07-14 08:39:37 Watch your mouth
general 2022-07-14 08:39:44 The good folk don’t like hearing that
general 2022-07-14 08:40:12 Naw

general 2022-07-14 09:00:50 True
general 2022-07-14 09:01:04 If it uses a normal block
general 2022-07-14 09:01:10 It is based of the plane
general 2022-07-14 09:01:14 IF IT USES ANY BLOCK
general 2022-07-14 09:01:19 it is based off the plane
general 2022-07-14 09:01:28 **clearly**
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 19:56:22 Bruh there’s nothing wrong with looking basic :/ I mean you cant put much on top of a zeppelin
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 20:00:13 
general 2022-07-15 05:06:58 F4 phantom?

general 2022-07-17 17:51:22 Why yes I have no image permission
creations-chat 2022-07-18 08:51:52 Bro why are you so harsh, you expect 1:1 realism on a lego game. And if you are so good make his plane but better.
bot-central 2022-07-18 08:54:13 !rank
creations-chat 2022-07-18 08:57:24 Irrelevant 🤓
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:00:06 Man’s saying I’m not criticizing his plane but I am 💀
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:04:20 Firstly, his pile of blocks is not bad lol, along with the fact that camera lock isn’t reliable, so there will be *slight* differences from its real world counterpart
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:07:03 You were commenting on his build, if that was true I might as well slapped you in the face and said “no offense to you, I am not slapping you”
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:10:10 The point of the conversation now is that you can’t say you didn’t do something in the same sentence you said you did something. End conversation
general 2022-07-18 09:10:44 Greetings
plane-crazy 2022-07-18 09:11:02 
general 2022-07-18 09:11:50 Government healthcare is for dimwits
general 2022-07-18 09:13:10 Why should a government that should be staying out of peoples lives for the most part  be getting into them
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:15:31 The point was that if you can’t build better you shouldn’t criticize other peoples builds, especially if you work in a similar craft to them.
general 2022-07-18 09:16:35 What’s your opinion on pc factions
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:18:54 Harassment and criticism are different things, now go do something instead of waiting for time to run out
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:22:38 Not really, I haven’t been ranked yet although I have a 2400 block battle carrier sitting in my saves file. Creations blacklist is irrelevant for this argument
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:27:53 I mean should a noob be criticizing a mediocre player of all the noob can build is a pile of blocks. Or should a spaceship designer criticize a tank designers work if All he can build is suspension free treads for his launch platform. Criticism can be warranted
general 2022-07-18 09:28:07 You all need to stop chatting about your creations
general 2022-07-18 09:28:10 Do you know why?
general 2022-07-18 09:28:17 Because it’s a lego game

general 2022-07-18 09:28:50 Do you know why?
general 2022-07-18 09:28:53 It’s a lego game
general 2022-07-18 09:29:13 No one cares, it’s a lego game
general 2022-07-18 09:30:20 It’s a lego game, no need to argue bruv
general 2022-07-18 09:30:42 You don’t say?
