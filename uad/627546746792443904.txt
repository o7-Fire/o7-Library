plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:10:34 That is a disconnter

plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:10:55 I'm on phone rn I cant spell
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:11:31 And again, it's not ez hiding that many motors in a small space
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:11:47 But thx for the advice
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:12:01 Il try hide it
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:12:34 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:12:50 It is ez to hide when u do large builds
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:13:07 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:13:52 Yes plus on the Apache I got more space on nose than fuselage as the rotar is in the way
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:14:07 So nose seem the best place
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:14:16 Idk
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:14:24 This is my first heli
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:14:41 I mostly do jets
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:14:51 It probably won't fly
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:15:05 I can get someone to help
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:15:15 Yea I'm all jets
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:15:44 I could
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:16:20 I was hoping to have single blade with only motor power
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:16:45 I have done test and a few work but I'm not sure if they will have the power
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:17:24 Lol same
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:17:58 The funny thing is I started making it smol like really smol andd not hard
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 05:18:36 Sometimes is spend 5 min figureing out how does this work

plane-crazy 2020-11-10 18:25:12 my apache is 700 blocks rn and 297 are motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 18:25:21 well its 706
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 18:25:24 but still
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 18:25:42 
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 18:25:48 there lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 18:26:01 not really
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 18:26:23 there are a smol amount of motors showing thats impressive for the 300 motors im hidding in that smol area
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 18:26:42 the rotor in the back is hollow thats y i was able to lower it so low
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 18:26:49 so i didnt have much space
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 18:27:11 do u motorlock like me
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 18:27:19 to get the most accurate apache
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 18:27:25 show
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 18:28:19 it looks good but like i said again its not as accurate as mine
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 18:28:32 still great though
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 18:30:01 
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 18:30:05 idk what plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 18:41:51 motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 18:41:59 it will solve all ur issues
general 2020-11-20 06:20:01 motorlock is broken they detach them selves like disconnectors
general 2020-11-20 06:20:18 yes
general 2020-11-20 06:20:27 no like motor delay
general 2020-11-20 06:20:30 nope
general 2020-11-20 06:20:58 so normal motorlock when u spawn is fline, its when u angle a motor with lock on they fall like disconnectors
bug-reports 2020-11-20 06:23:00 motors are falling
bug-reports 2020-11-20 06:23:04 
bug-reports 2020-11-20 06:23:14 thats a motor not disconnctor
bug-reports 2020-11-20 06:23:28 its when u turn them
bug-reports 2020-11-20 06:23:38 yea
bug-reports 2020-11-20 06:24:01 yea its motors with the lock setting on

plane-crazy 2020-11-25 17:51:42 confusing
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 17:51:53 also wont let me type
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 17:52:00 i have

plane-crazy 2020-11-25 17:52:56 thrust vectoring like su35
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 17:56:40 use motors and a button to press on off
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 17:56:49 its useful for rockets landing
creations-chat 2020-11-25 18:00:00 lol its not that exposed and its impossible to remove
creations-chat 2020-11-25 18:01:33 try hiding this amount of motors in a 1.5 high and 4 wide area. also there isnt many
creations-chat 2020-11-25 18:03:04 there are only 15 slightly showing and 5 showing a fair amount but non showing like crazy. also when i paint it will be hidden lol
creations-chat 2020-11-25 18:05:03 also rate my attack craft rn, it will have a superstructure soon
creations-chat 2020-11-25 18:06:38 this is my first boat that will drive, i made 2 carriers before but they didn't move lol. also the interior space is 4 wide cause i used wing panels for the walls so its got lots of space inside. and i have to agree with the turret, i didn't want to spend an hour making one that would fit in my motorlock
creations-chat 2020-11-25 18:08:11 lol i forgot that i also used disconnectors so its double sided so the outside is white and inside is blue xd. yea this is it in build mode
bot-central 2020-11-25 18:10:28 ik i asked for designer rank V
creations-chat 2020-11-25 18:10:57 also try hidding nearly 300 motors of motorlock in a 1.5x4 area

plane-crazy 2020-12-03 19:11:41 not really
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 19:11:51 cause when u are on the ground they dont work
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 19:11:57 and when i fly they are super long

plane-crazy 2020-12-03 19:13:51 trails bad
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 19:14:06 yes because they only work at a certain speed
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 19:14:38 only at a certain speed
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 19:14:44 also u dont need to move to have afterburner
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 19:15:23 the turbines suck the air in which is combusted 2 times to give the afterburner effect plus more thrust
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 19:31:44 y not motorlock it

creations-chat 2020-12-28 19:04:04 not that much lock
creations-chat 2020-12-28 19:07:26 its just a tower. not that complex. its also thin so they only motorlocked up
creations-chat 2020-12-28 19:09:36 i guess ur right, i mean im experienced at motorlock so for me that looks simple
creations-chat 2020-12-28 19:17:54 all ur problems can be solved with custom wedges

bot-central 2020-12-31 08:24:01 !servers
creations-chat 2020-12-31 08:26:14 recon this can make it if i paint it and add a little more sign detail
creations-chat 2020-12-31 08:28:41 i used 310 motors lol, overall build size is 1117 blocks and the rotor can barely get it into the air but it hovers nice and works so im happy as this is my first heli
creations-chat 2020-12-31 08:30:47 
creations-chat 2020-12-31 08:39:28 <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
creations-chat 2020-12-31 09:08:02 well, i want an honest opinion cause i can add stuff and change them before painting cause its hard to when all the motors are coloured same with disconnectors
creations-chat 2020-12-31 09:30:57 DAM, noice

creations-chat 2021-01-02 15:37:34 <@!626449107577471012> let me guess i got down voted cause there are a few motors showing as your a perfectionist
creations-chat 2021-01-02 15:39:39 
creations-chat 2021-01-02 16:06:53 xd, it didnt take 2 months of building i stopped 2 months ago then found it in my slot so figured id finish it
creations-chat 2021-01-02 16:09:12 and also this mess doesn't help, god i didn't know how to simplify motorlock 2 months ago, well rip. still one of my fav builds now that its finished
creations-chat 2021-01-02 16:49:43 its 300+ motors and im sad
creations-chat 2021-01-02 20:21:24 <@456226577798135808> , thought u said u would quite, y u still playing xd. attention seeking much
creations-chat 2021-01-02 20:23:25 ok lol, just asking, and yea, 1.5k is like a year only lol
creations-chat 2021-01-03 08:48:49 <@!626449107577471012> try hidding that much motors with that much space and also camera locking can mess the build up very well. they are fairly hidden there are only 4 showing nearly half the motor and the rest are so tiny so, stop being toxic and downvoting people for the littlest things
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 11:17:36 dam
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 11:18:23 with an ocean that big and deep missile frigates and subs can actually be useful in a naval battle

plane-crazy 2021-01-03 11:30:18 as a jet builder that would be very cool
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 11:30:56 also if the rwy on the airport can be alot wider for the larger airliner builds and longer to land on
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 11:31:03 sorry if i sound pushy

plane-crazy 2021-01-03 11:36:37 dont increase the amount of blocks we can place
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 11:36:58 if he doesnt increase the overall amount of blocks we can place then there wont be extra lag
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 11:37:08 it just means we dont need mega folds for larger builds
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 11:37:22 yea we need a higher plot
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 11:37:43 WE NEED MORE

plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:03:24 so lag is reduced alot
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:03:44 cause its all in 2D
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:03:54 it reduces lag alot
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:04:05 nope
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:04:23 we remove everything inside the terrain that u cant see so it doesnt matter
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:04:26 it reduces lag
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:05:04 a cube made of 6 flat 2d sides is alot less laggy than a full cube and they look the same cause the inside u dont see
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:05:07 nope
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:05:28 if that was the case the mining tool when u dig away at the ground u see more ground
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:05:35 if it was hollow that wouldnt be the case
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:05:45 perfect desert
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:05:52 wait
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:05:54 no thats sea

plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:08:18 wdym fol dup
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:08:22 foldup
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:08:53 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:09:07 its hollow
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:09:09 inside
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:09:12 there is nothing
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:09:21 nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:09:33 terrain looks way smoother
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:10:28 OMG imagine we have a normal airport and a airfield for ww1 and 2
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:10:44 nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:10:49 yea dont detail the airport
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:11:08 add hangers for the airport that would be so cool
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:11:58 iam go eat
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:12:55 that would be nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:13:17 no but u can go through it
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:13:23 so its like text
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:13:43 add an invisible setting to motors and make motor 2 be able to lock
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:14:01 custom wedges would be so much easier and motorlock will be fully hidden
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:14:11 for the smaller builds
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:14:32 no keep it
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:14:37 we need that lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-03 12:15:47 nice
creations-chat 2021-01-03 18:58:21 <@!626449107577471012> im only acting like this cause u down voted a good build, either up vote or leave it, i have seen your history and you have done this to a few people for no reason. its being toxic and its annoying. also saying its feedback is BS, you cant get that level of detail at the scale with no motors showing and tbh some motors showing don't ruin a build like you are saying. and don't say you didn't like it cause if you do then u might as well hate your own builds
creations-chat 2021-01-03 19:00:24 he downvoted this cause there are 4 motors showing on the nose, even then they arent that badly showing
creations-chat 2021-01-03 19:02:43 the flaps are to get the colour as there is a black strip plus stabilise the heli and the load out the 100% the same
creations-chat 2021-01-03 19:04:49 i have 4 hell fire on each wing and there is a hydra rocket pod on both wings plus 2 air to air missiles on the ends of both wings shown as the trails, also i remeber that, you used engines to pitch and he downvoted cause a part of a delta wing was over the intakes and calls him self a perfectionist
creations-chat 2021-01-03 19:06:51 no, the hellfire are on the inside and the hydra pods are on the outside, then again that's the way the 3d model i was using had it, i don't think its to much of a difference also neo warfare has it in my configuration
creations-chat 2021-01-03 19:09:10 yes
creations-chat 2021-01-03 19:16:12 looks nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:34:35 just done the maths with lots of controlled tests:

1 speed = 0.6148428475 mph (0.6 mph)

Roblox character runs at 24.5937139 mph (24.6 mph)

Speed of sound in game is 1238.039937 speed (1238 speed)
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:35:25 ur
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:35:27 sure
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:35:41 i can convert the data i got from MPH to kmh
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:35:51 np
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:37:05 dam
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:37:13 1 speed is 1 kmh
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:37:27 this game is in KMH
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:37:50 yea
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:39:10 yea 1 speed = 0.98 kmh
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 15:39:33 so thats bassicaly 1 kmh, most likely the difference is from my testing
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 14:57:10 hot
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:05:05 u mean motorlock it out of the hull as you would have it inside in build mode
creations-chat 2021-01-07 10:00:34 bruh
creations-chat 2021-01-07 10:03:23 <@!419873641229189120> with that nose it ruins the whole build as it is really messy when the rest of your build is smooth and clean. I would improve on the canopy and either change the nose or custom wedge the whole build to match the nose otherwise it just looks off. *i like the intakes though*
creations-chat 2021-01-07 10:05:51 yea its a little odd, i think u have learnt a building technique that your own skills cant keep up with so in some way, building worse for you looks better
creations-chat 2021-01-07 10:15:53 <@!263904179813220353> nice gyro https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/796679537060610069

creations-chat 2021-01-15 10:45:36 defiantly the dark blue. but that's only for that particular build, the orange one may look better on a build that fits the colour orange as that would be your stand out colour if that makes sense, but for that build the dark blue is the better stand out colour if that makes sense

creations-chat 2021-01-15 10:49:20 You went off line but it happened. my friend filming has 1 graphics so it had to be timed well as i didnt know how to screen record back then. so i didnt see the need to put anymore effort trying to get it right if you werent even going to see it.
creations-chat 2021-01-15 10:51:42 i still got my su57 that does it and now that ik how to screen record il send one when im done with school in a few hours if i remember ofc
creations-chat 2021-01-15 10:53:44 also I need building ideas, I haven't made a complete build with effort in a few months and I'm getting bored of being bored and not building, plus I don't feel like quitting this game yet cause I know I can get better still
creations-chat 2021-01-15 10:55:50 tbh at this point I don't care what it is as long as there is a 3d model of it and blueprints would be nice, plus a wiki page saying all its dimension's so I can calculate correct angles and lengths, aircraft is my speciality. something new would be nice to, learning new stuff is always handy
creations-chat 2021-01-15 10:58:18 maybe.
creations-chat 2021-01-15 11:00:40 I have 5 ships and a sub to complete, an assault craft and a carrier plus a ww2 British destroyer, Iowa class sub and an attack craft. so I highly doubt that that will ever work, it will just be another naval build that is half complete. idk il just server hop maybe and if anything catches my eyes il just make that and hope i maintain motivation, I'm such a lazy build lol
creations-chat 2021-01-15 13:00:54 maybe

creations-chat 2021-01-19 12:45:36 What's the size of your cruiser and how big will your carrier be, assuming you will have both ships in the same slot. dam i hate the 2 min wait after sending something.
creations-chat 2021-01-19 12:58:29 I mean, if you want to have both ships spawned in for a formation you can and you have the space so I guess go ahead with it. a lot of key binds you will have to remember though if the carrier will work

creations-chat 2021-01-19 14:27:39 I would like to continue this but due to the shitty 2 min wait for sending messages ima dip and pay attention to my lesson. also <@!518176389975900160> how can we give an opinion to that, there is basically nothing to say about it. its a simple ship hull I'm guessing.

help 2021-01-20 20:34:19 u need to wait for the piston to lock
help 2021-01-20 20:34:46 so what u do is activate the piston then deactivate it then activate it again then wait a few seconds and it locks properly
help 2021-01-20 20:35:24 try it, im new to it to and it makes building things so much better
help 2021-01-20 20:35:58 to get things in the right place

help 2021-01-20 20:36:40 i have a canopy that is completley  custom angled cylinders for my f16 to get a clean bubble but without piston lock there are gaps, with it there are no gaps
help 2021-01-20 20:37:11 also the boundary layer that seperates the intakes from the body is like 0.32 blocks so use pistons
help 2021-01-20 20:37:58 this is old image before i changed the canopy to cylinders but this is an example
help 2021-01-20 20:38:06 without piston lock

help 2021-01-20 20:40:25 or in 2 days
help 2021-01-20 20:40:38 cause piston lock and motolock in general takes for ever

help 2021-01-20 20:41:35 especially the canopy
help 2021-01-20 20:42:11 if u lock a piston into a block then its buggy

creations-chat 2021-01-21 13:31:59 maybe get some more on the floor details if u can but great shape, motors are hidden well to. when its all coloured the motors showing will be harder to see
creations-chat 2021-01-21 13:35:08 a box with wheels holding another box with an attempt at desert camo
creations-chat 2021-01-21 13:37:15 <:IntendedFeature:706289545548660746> *have u tried it*
creations-chat 2021-01-21 13:39:16 yes, not much, of course if your not that good at it it might be challenging, which with that response I'm assuming that's the case. also 30 motors is like a walk in the park
creations-chat 2021-01-21 13:41:17 the missile knows where it is at all times because it knows where it isn't.
creations-chat 2021-01-21 13:45:52 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
creations-chat 2021-01-21 13:47:54 also it wasn't the size that was the issue, its the overall design of it, in short, it looks like a potato build.
creations-chat 2021-01-21 13:50:03 is that missile guided or unguided and if its unguided y is it so BIG *don't say that's what she said*

creations-chat 2021-01-21 13:56:07 what's the width of your hull cause a life sized interior hull width is 4 blocks in game. and 3.5 blocks high and 16.5 blocks long
creations-chat 2021-01-21 13:58:08 tbh that's fine as long as its scaled right, meaning your the right height, length and width compared to each other
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:00:09 wait which aircraft u doing again i might have searched the wrong plane
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:02:14 yea thought so, yea i searched the sizes its 10 feet wide irl interior space and if the roblox character is 5 feet then 1 block is 2.5 so 4 blocks wide is life sized, same with 3.5 high and 16.5 long but like u said, u cant fit cargo and would be cramped
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:04:15 welcome to PCC
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:06:20 no one cares if u spent 8 hours, its whether it looks good or not
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:08:22 8 hours on Godzilla means that u didn't put much effort into it so it didn't look good. therefore people didn't upvote.
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:10:23 my f16 rn is on its 4th day of building and i have just finished the nose and canopy and started on the intakes
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:12:24 L O W   E F F O R T
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:14:27 first that's not a battleship, more like a cruiser and also its tiny and def low effort, no details at all. its potato level
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:16:28 train looks nice, I'm guessing people just downvote cause to them it doesn't look like a train. also did I ever say light cruiser, I just said cruiser.
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:18:29 website is wrong, c-130 is 10 feet wide not 20 like in that image
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:20:30 c-130 is 10 feet wide, 9 feet high and 41 feet long which in game terms that's 4 blocks wide, 3.5 blocks high and 16.5 blocks long. also guggi thx for cleaning that issue up
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:23:20 no u can just search on google for the interior sizes
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:25:46 well it should be 3.6 if the height is 9 feet irl cause the roblox character is like 5 feet so 1 block is 2.5 feet. but then again its plane crazy, no one makes life sized aircraft that looks good or functions well, especially for cargo planes
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:27:52 ro-scale is good, do that, I mean the rules are to fit cargo so make it as big as u want. rn u look like ur doing 2:1
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:29:54 yea sorry if i seem toxic, ur c-130 looks good. gl on it, feedback wise, MoRe DeTaIlS On ThE FlOoR
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:31:56 yea gl it looks complicated and difficult
creations-chat 2021-01-21 18:24:19 opinions?, also those motors at the back are hidden 100% i just havent added the walls there
creations-chat 2021-01-21 18:26:20 the intakes will be 0.25 blocks lower when im done, just need to piston lock on more thing. also i got bubble canopy cause pog

bug-reports 2021-01-24 10:16:50 does rick even know if motor 2 is broken, its been a week
creations-chat 2021-01-26 09:03:46 <@!707588709389697064> that afterburner is nice, was that smokes and lights?
creations-chat 2021-01-26 09:06:55 could u ping it to me
creations-chat 2021-01-26 09:09:00 oh lol it was there ok, yea thought so but the addition with lights makes it nice, i will experiment with it a bit and add some more colours to see how that works
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:10:21 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:10:34 u need to motorlock up the other fold though
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:10:54 id show u my ship that i did it with but i cant get on rn
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:11:35 make a L shape with the motors
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:12:12 so u made it go out to the side of the fold now u need to go up the other fold to the other end of the plot so it connects
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:12:34 not [
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:12:38 its an L
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:12:46 cause u started from the middel
creations-chat 2021-01-26 09:12:53 il see what i can do later cause im making an f16 rn and it has a very long afterburner like the one u made and it will look good
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:13:47 then go up the middle of the next fold to the other end
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:13:56 so its in line with your first fold
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:13:59 when spawned in
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:14:41 u can use cameras to angle things
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:15:02 but it can get irritating sometimes so i dont recommend it
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:15:25 just custom angle with motors and motorlock its easier to use
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:15:53 i just use motorlock and pistonlock to make builds
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:16:27 yea
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:16:34 thge intake was re done yesterday
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:16:37 so its better
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:16:40 but i cant get on rn
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:16:48 i also got the first part of the wings
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:16:59 i got da bubble canopy doe
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:17:10 these are old images so the progress sucks
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:17:28 its better than motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:17:42 it means i can get more accurate
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:18:22 look canopy without pistonlock
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:18:35 canopy with
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:18:51 just saying i replaced this canopy so its better
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:18:56 
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:19:00 its lower down
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:19:11 and the intake was re done as well
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:19:14 so its larger
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:19:26 put toggle and lock setting on the piston and wait for it to lock
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:19:36 it makes spawing in longer though
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:19:44 i would if i could get on
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:19:53 il send them here later after school
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:19:57 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:20:01 think of it like this
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:20:12 normal motorlock allows u to move blocks by half a block right
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:20:29 pistons allow u to move blocks 0.01 blocks or 3.67 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:20:41 so u can get super clean and smooth edges
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:20:46 and more accurate
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:20:50 yea
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:21:02 just adds a little more lag and spawning in takes for ever
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:21:45 i got 11 key binds to spawn in rn and i only got the front part, plus i need to check if all the pistons have locked before i start angling sections cause sometimes they dont lock
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:21:56 so its like a 2 min to spawn in rn
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:22:04 and will take longer as i continue
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:22:08 looks hella good though
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:22:59 yea i re did the intakes so i can fit custom landing gear but motor 2 is still kinda dead so they dont work
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:25:08 i got a engine with working nozzles i will add to it and i got a vid of it spawning in, if anyone wants to copy it from the vid they can
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:25:32 
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:26:04 the afterburner is temporary
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:27:13 thx
creations-chat 2021-01-26 09:27:34 cause looks nothing like one
creations-chat 2021-01-26 09:29:44 this is what an apache looks like. and even mine isn't that good.
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:30:49 np
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:30:57 if u want u can use it
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:32:34 the settings on the motor 2 on the bottom set of nozzles that dont angle is speed 1, torque 1000 and angle 13, the top set that do angle 45 degrees have speed 0.5, torque 1000 and angle 10. the piston that moves the rocket engine is 1 and has toggle and lock
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:32:43 those are the settings
creations-chat 2021-01-26 09:33:07 this is a potato attempt
creations-chat 2021-01-26 09:35:10 idk, maybe u need a rank i think, also the guy who made that apache should try use blueprints and 3d models to help get his build get better, i cant attack a persons build without giving feedback, for example, the gun has a single barrel not 2
creations-chat 2021-01-26 09:37:12 tbh idk, I used to be able to post with just verified, ask in <#478584971670454284> someone who knows more than me might help you
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 09:37:22 yes
creations-chat 2021-01-26 09:39:13 ahhhhhh, makes sense. so u can only post images in <#384025409945337856> if you dont have level 3

bot-central 2021-01-26 09:39:26 oof that suck
creations-chat 2021-01-26 09:41:14 yes u need to be more active, but only a little
creations-chat 2021-01-26 09:43:15 just be active and you will get them every now and again, you only need to rank up 3 times, shouldn't take to long, go in <#384027830192832513> and put in *!rank* and see what rank you got and how much left to rank 3
help 2021-01-26 09:45:05 u can custom angle the nose, ignore my intake this is an old image and the intake was completely re done

creations-chat 2021-01-26 09:45:42 np
help 2021-01-26 09:47:48 also the nose on the f16 drops down a bit like a f4 so add that if u can

plane-crazy 2021-01-26 10:19:47 did u put up the density on the ballast block
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 10:20:08 i think it does
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 10:20:43 oh yea lol the ballast is heavier i didnt see it
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 10:20:53 lol i was looking at the message not the image
plane-crazy 2021-01-26 10:21:05 yea ballast is heavier

help 2021-01-26 14:21:27 ik what that feels like
help 2021-01-26 14:23:48 the tail rotor acts like counter torque if you have a single rotor that is powered by the motor, if you have coaxial you dont need counter torque and same with a single rotor if the motor is unpowered
help 2021-01-26 14:24:10 also if your tail rotor is to high or to low then it will cause you to tilt
help 2021-01-26 14:24:15 when u turn
help 2021-01-26 14:24:27 so dont use it for turning if its not centred

help 2021-01-26 14:26:18 use ballast blocks to stabilize the heli
help 2021-01-26 14:26:34 u can have a small heli at 3k blocks
help 2021-01-26 14:26:45 yes there will
help 2021-01-26 14:26:48 just motorlock
help 2021-01-26 14:27:03 same
help 2021-01-26 14:28:06 motorlock ballast blocks around your heli to stabilize it. for me i was tail heavy so i put a bunch of them on the nose and use control surfaces to counter roll which happens when you try to move your heli forward
help 2021-01-26 14:29:21 not really, i think its the rotation of the blades that cause the heli to want to roll when you go forward
help 2021-01-26 14:29:41 i can image the physics behind it
help 2021-01-26 14:29:49 ik how it works just cant put it intop words
help 2021-01-26 14:30:15 think of it as a graph

help 2021-01-26 14:41:36 do u not know it
help 2021-01-26 14:41:50 its the most cracked form of lock

creations-chat 2021-02-17 17:55:53 how much did you use on those tanks <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-02-17 17:58:10 also thats sentence is so cringe
creations-chat 2021-02-17 18:00:34 also his tank is simple, not much detail and its also a large tank so its easy to have lots of motorlock in it
creations-chat 2021-02-17 18:02:36 yes, for the size of it its simple, answer me, how much motorlock u used on them cause u said u used tons lol
general 2021-02-17 18:04:16 i do lol
general 2021-02-17 18:04:26 im better than u lol its cringe seeing you
creations-chat 2021-02-17 18:06:46 would u down vote this considering that this turret isnt done? pyro your cringe stop
creations-chat 2021-02-17 18:08:55 remember unlike you, this tank is 1 to 1.5 blocks tall 5 wide and 8 long so it is very small and also u didnt answer me, how much motorlock you used cause i can tell you whether its alot judging by the size of your tank
creations-chat 2021-02-17 18:11:29 where is the exposed motor noob. im also super accurate lol
creations-chat 2021-02-17 18:16:09 does your friend know what pistonlock is?
creations-chat 2021-02-17 18:39:55 thats not how pistonlock works lol
creations-chat 2021-02-17 18:44:03 as you know motorlock gives you the ability to move blocks half a block in at most, pistonlock allows you to do that but more accurately, for example my f16 canopy has been lowered by 0.32 block into the body as its more accurate and the intake was lowered by 0.07 blocks to show the spacing for the airflow.
creations-chat 2021-02-17 19:01:41 nope its buggy if you dont wait for them to lock
creations-chat 2021-02-17 19:03:59 its actually alot better than it used to be, now it locks quicker
creations-chat 2021-02-17 19:13:36 no it doesnt. if it does that its cause you didnt let the piston lock
creations-chat 2021-02-17 19:15:38 u need to activate then deactivate them then do it again and it will lock in 2 seconds, also they wont lock correctly if you motor lock blocks into the pistons. also fabric only adds a tiny bit of grip
creations-chat 2021-02-17 19:17:46 what speed do you want to go, cause if its any faster than 150 u might as well go with normal wheels cause they will detrack every now and again due to plane crazy being plane crazy, to make the treads not loose use suspension to push the treads out
creations-chat 2021-02-17 19:19:48 oh thats easy for treads, 50 tbh is slow not fast, anyway use suspension to push out the treads or pistons and make the treads motorlock into the hull from the side so its even more tight, try experimenting with your own custom ones as you know roughly how they work
creations-chat 2021-02-17 19:22:02 if u want to climb hills with treads on a small tank forget them, not happening, treads cant climb unless its got bumps for the tracks to grip onto, and the hills and mountains are smooth
creations-chat 2021-02-17 19:24:20 thats not ture, they can comeoff if someone rams into you or u hit something or go to fast and also the half wedges dont give you grip when you drive, treads are good on rough terrain yes, but climbing up smooth surfaces no, ik cause i have made a terrain test map with all sorts of challenges and treads can do everything but one and thats climbing
creations-chat 2021-02-17 19:26:55 sherman tank

creations-chat 2021-02-17 19:33:43 it could just be the angle at which you took the photo, you cant see anything and also having your Mig-31 painted in one solid colour makes it hard to see any defining features. maybe adding more details regarding colour?
bot-central 2021-02-21 17:58:03 !servers
creations-chat 2021-02-22 15:02:19 urrrr. 1 block wide tracks do exist, they just break a lot easier
creations-chat 2021-02-22 15:04:20 agreed, raw footage looks best for planecrazy
creations-chat 2021-02-22 15:06:41 opinions on f-16 nose?
creations-chat 2021-02-22 15:09:34 it has a bubble canopy
creations-chat 2021-02-22 15:11:37 yes but i cleaned it up a bit. and im working on a challenger tank. im lazy and im on off, i highly doubt i will finish this before summer cause im that lazy and un motivated
creations-chat 2021-02-22 15:13:40 kinda, i also used pistonlock other wise without it there will be large gaps in the canopy. pistons allow you to move blocks around to hide those gaps. Its also 4 sections
creations-chat 2021-02-22 15:15:51 this might be a better angle to see it. also all the motors are 99% hidden * there is the tiniest motor corner showing on the intake
creations-chat 2021-02-22 15:17:54 you can see it to the middle right of the image where the intake merges with the fuselage. pyromaster wont be happy with that motor. the other motors you see are no covered cause i haven't added that part of the fuselage yet or are just clipping so will be hidden when i paint

creations-chat 2021-04-05 11:10:44 that might help with some of the tigers geometry and details, also np <@!723940197456281640>. Also this 2 min wait is killing me

creations-chat 2021-04-05 11:15:03 got a challenger turret that im to lazy to colour and make a hull for, and finish the details around the barrel. cant wait to get a bunch of hate comments on it for little inaccuracy's.
creations-chat 2021-04-05 11:17:14 i would if it would spawn in again, i only got old images cause for some reason the pistons wont work anymore and the turret cheeks wont angle again:(. i an try fix a few things, so it spawns in
creations-chat 2021-04-05 11:19:15 yea it used to work and aim and not die all the time until the pistons vomited all over my account and most my builds dont work anymore :(. also thx
creations-chat 2021-04-05 11:21:17 i would give the hull more life, rn its plain and simple.. and flat. also no worry <@!564231852391661589> im working to fix it
creations-chat 2021-04-05 11:23:18 sure, im in the priv server rn for plane crazy and any help would be nice, i took a 3 month break from planecrazy so its a little hard to continue where i left of
creations-chat 2021-04-05 11:25:25 an example is add the engine vents at the back or what ever they are called (*DONT ATTACK ME TANK NERDS FOR INACCURATE NAMES*) also <@!564231852391661589> he was responding to my feedback
creations-chat 2021-04-05 11:27:52 side view will look something like this cause im following this 3d model quite extensively, and when im done fixing the issues of spawning in i will add smokes and the loaders hatch
creations-chat 2021-04-05 11:32:49 https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/panzer-v-panther-medium-tank-b4693513fec841bbad571fbd0120ce95 panther 3d model, use this to decide
creations-chat 2021-04-05 11:35:07 https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/panther-tank1.gif a blueprint as well. <@!393679134779375616> i scrolled up chat and saw someone has a javelin that is suspiciously similar to yours. lol
creations-chat 2021-04-05 11:37:08 true, they will look similar details wise if your both good enough, but your paint job makes yours look better.
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 11:37:46 pp
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 11:37:53 that def wasnt a flex on my part
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 11:38:00 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 11:38:31 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 11:38:46 for some reason it legit wont spawn in anymore
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 11:39:25 the upper plate armour on the turret wont angle down now cause the pistons decide to vomit over my tank
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 11:39:44 so now it has a massive block in the way and flat top
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 11:39:56 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 11:40:00 they are dead now
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 11:41:10 they spas out for me and dont go the the length i set them to
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 11:41:27 so now my pistonlock just ruins my stuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 11:41:31 no
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 11:41:49 yes probs
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 11:41:53 i mean pistons are on off
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 11:41:56 one day they work
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 11:41:59 the next they dont
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 11:42:15 makes pistonlocked builds unpredictable when spawning in
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 11:42:27 and sometimes when they dont lock you will glitch, die then crash
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 11:42:34 cause thats just plane crazy

creations-chat 2021-04-06 16:30:04 most tutorials are cringe cause they aren't even that good yet somehow new players think they are good and still use them
creations-chat 2021-04-06 16:45:56 true
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:01:28 magically my challenger turret decided to spawn correctly after 3 months
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:04:29 you wanted a side view, here it is. *ik its suppose to start to slope up a little at the back but come on. for a build this size its nearly impossible to do it without any motors showing and keeping the turret from working*
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:08:01 im scared to despawn
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:10:11 as well as the fact that the only way to get good at plane crazy is through experience and FAILING a lot at first. from there you slowly develop your skills, and find your own preferred building style. as well as learning new techniques from others
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:12:22 yes kinda
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:14:46 yea, those tutorials are fine as they help with mechanisms and sometimes people don't have the patience and effort to make their own or literally don't understand the physics behind it *talking in plane crazy ofc*. Relying on tutorials though all the time when you get stuck isn't a good habit though and you should learn to figure things out your self
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:16:51 thx, i still haven't de-spawned. i'm scared that it wont spawn in again like this for another month so i'm just savering the moment until i disconnect or something (like getting bored of staring at it)
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:19:38 thx, pics are boring so here is a vid of it turning
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:22:05 sure you can. like i said a min ago, you will get better the more you play, and even I am no where near as good as HOF players
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:24:06 🇾
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:26:11 ima go push off all the springs in the meantime, they are kinda lagging the server. also <@!461639155911229440> your probs right
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:28:15 🤮
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:31:45 what was the point in this video. it doesn't back up your argument
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:33:49 cause it looks bad. if you want to use control surfaces you can if you want but motorlock another set of wings on top to cover the cheese grater look so no one will hate you for using them. also they are not as manoeuvrable as motor control
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:36:04 who said you use wasd control. mouse control is superior. you can do mouse control on motor 2
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:38:08 you do know people use the glitch mouse control so they can fly like someone with motor control, like flying sideways or upside down, which you can do with motor control, you can also turn hella fast when you want and is more twitchy so in tight dogfights, if you got the skill, its better at turning
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:40:09 and that is where you are wrong. you don't need a camera. you can do 360 views if you put toggle and set it to right click like you would if you used control surfaces. and it is very easy to roll and is a lot more manoeuvrable and faster
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:42:32 who said motor control used keyboard control. there is no camera and only the roll is on A and D. you can do all the manuvers like flying upside down or sideways
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:46:31 its wobbling cause im laggy, that's the only reason why. also im eating so we can talk about this another time
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:53:34 there is a little wobble but that's due to the size of the vertical stabiliser. motor control isn't better or worst than control surfaces. i only prefer it as you don't get the cheese grater look
creations-chat 2021-04-06 17:56:06 you need yaw to be able to aim at ground targets easier
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:06:12 how many blocks
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:10:13 bruh what. this bot is high. i just said 12k is a lot for a boat, any more and it would be impossible to move. why do i get spam warned lol. not only are the mods crap but so are the bots. now i gotta wait another 2 min 😦
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:12:43 i would say that that jet was slow and going in a straight line if i didn't know what I'm talking about. due to plane crazy shitty client lag hitting a moving target is not easy with bombs or custom missiles as you need to blow in front from a certain distance and that distance changes all the time due to lag spikes that happen all the time. nice mid air kill
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:16:52 cobra in my su57. no cheats or engines to assist, literally just speed control/ throttle control and a bit of drifting. *ik i use cheese grater rudder but i made this for a 1 hour build challenge ages ago so i didn't have time to motorlock the rudder in for motor control*
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:19:16 um not a proper cobra. i have seen many attempts. and i can post stall my su30 really well il show. also my su30 has no thrust vectoring, just rudder control
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:22:11 
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:24:11 <@!730808827234091041> ^
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:30:35 everyone gangster till the apache goes into a vertical
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:34:32 
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:36:31 i mean although i don't support cheese grater wings, motorlocking another pair of wings will add to drag, slowing down the aircraft which ofc no one wants that
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:38:39 yes but that causes lag which will just slow down the aircraft even more. and due to extra lag you will experience speed wobbles which will limit your aircraft's top speed even more. so even though its looks dumb as hell and something a noob would do, its not an issue you can just fix like that
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:40:41 wdym lol. is having lag now a skill issue.
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:42:44 its not lol. look at how my camera moves and my mouse xd. thats not in slowmotion. im just good
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:44:50 you can hide them by puting the motors inside your airframe and connecting the wings with text blocks which are invisible and not solid so it wont be in the way
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:46:53 wdym lol, how do you want me to do it, i literally did a post stall
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:49:06 ok let me do it, so you want me moving not just hovering. you can edit on your already sent messages to avoid the 2 min wait
creations-chat 2021-04-06 18:55:00 <@!730808827234091041> happy? angle of attack is not as much as my su30. should i try to get more angle
creations-chat 2021-04-07 05:52:39 that wasnt a cobra, that was a post stall. as you can see in the message i was talking about how my su 30 post stalls fairly well
creations-chat 2021-04-07 05:54:42 ik but you dont see helis doing that much irl or even at all
creations-chat 2021-04-07 05:56:49 <@!523278765825196062>  here is the vid of my su 57 doing a cobra.
creations-chat 2021-04-07 05:58:52 lol your right. all that is, is a green glass wall with lights outside
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:02:20 i did continue forward and i gained 100 alt which is nothing in game. and a real cobra you do gain some altitude but you fall back down after which i did. as i was still moving forward at 80 speed at my slowest. if you look at my speed and altitude gain, its a proper cobra
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:10:12 you gain some altitude and slow down. thats what happened to me. plus this is plane crazy, its the closest you can get without using engines to cheat
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:14:49 that is where your wrong.im currenty going to show you how high 100 alt is. my aircraft is taller than 100 alt. or close enough
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:17:24 i gained this much altitude which is about the same as the vid i sent of an su doing the cobra
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:19:24 this is plane crazy. its a cobra. deal with it. its the closest your gonna get. past 100 then you go into a flip as 99eryaydude said. there is no inertia. its a plane crazy cobra
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:21:31 then thats modifying your aircraft just to do one manuver. i made that su for a 1 hour build challenge and im not changing it. if you can do a cobra why dont you show me.
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:24:23 its a cobra. i went vertical and i was moving forward. if i wasnt moving forward then i wouldnt have been able to drop my nose down. ik cause i do it all the time and when i go to a stop or dont move forward, i go into a post stall. also i didnt gain much altitude
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:26:46 i was going 520 speed, thats not slow. at my slowest i went 80 or and even thats not that slow. plus you do gain altitude. and im not modifying my jet to do that
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:28:55 you might be using websites and stuff to find your facts but im looking at real vids of cobras. and this is what happens. you gain some altitude, you slow down, you go vertical, and you drop your nose. and i was going 80 speed when i was already vertical and not gaining attitude. i didnt go to a stop as i wouldnt have been able to drop my nose
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:30:59 yea, just didn't pull back as much as i would go into a loop cause im not modifying my aircraft but i still went vertical. <@!582834773773254656> ik you dont. i didnt gain much altitude either. <@!447221768520859659> thats cause he dropped his nose to go back down. the aircraft gained altitude. i just didnt pull down to go back down. if i was in formation like that aircraft i would have
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:33:01 yes and so does the one i did <@!447221768520859659> i gained about 4/5th of my aircraft length in altitude which is 100 alt. although yes thats a bit more than that vid you sent, its about the same as alot of other cobras
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:35:03 is it like you mission to put people down and be toxic.
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:37:10 it was a cobra lol and <@!718006867808485447> im not modifying my aircraft. ima do it again like <@456226577798135808> said and do it at low altitude so you have the floor to measure my cobra. at low alt i might hit my tail on the ground a few times so give be a min
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:39:11 first my su57 has like hardly any wings, and how am i gonna do it from another POV
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:41:47 my aircraft is 388 blocks and i only have 44 wing blocks. thats not much
creations-chat 2021-04-07 06:43:48 <@!718006867808485447> i still dont know how i will do another persons POV. unless one of you guys join me and i show you in game then how else will i do it. if you want to join im in private server 1. eeeeeeee i went over 100 degrees, hang on ima try film it
creations-chat 2021-04-07 08:17:37 ik thats why i said you dont see it much.
creations-chat 2021-04-07 08:21:57 looks good

creations-chat 2021-12-12 20:12:36 Looks like ima need to increase the width of my aircraft gear to navigate that deck 🙃
creations-chat 2021-12-12 20:16:05 The definition of engine suggest that it can also be a motor ☺️
creations-chat 2021-12-12 20:18:23 It's the act of transferring one form of energy to a mechanical force which for example an electric motor does that. You can just look up what an engine is. In other words you can call a motor an engine
creations-chat 2021-12-12 20:20:24 <@719168864705052802>  a motor is an engine.
creations-chat 2021-12-12 20:22:28 Idk, <@611251614178869269>  used you as a scape goat when giving of the assumption that a motor isnt an engine. Ask him/her
creations-chat 2021-12-12 20:24:30 https://c.tenor.com/Z6uHH2k0_vEAAAAM/understandable-have-nice-day.gif
creations-chat 2021-12-12 20:27:30 Ima over extend my ego and instigate an argument with this 2 minute chat cool down
creations-chat 2021-12-12 20:29:32 Ain't much motorlock. Especially for a build that size you should be able to hide most of it and the parts showing would be extremely miniscule
creations-chat 2021-12-12 20:33:12 Ok this 2 minute cool down is a bitch. I don't actually care about showing motors, your turret looks good but a little rough in some areas but that doesn't mean it's bad
creations-chat 2021-12-12 20:35:20 Imagine
creations-chat 2021-12-12 20:37:44 it's not bad, just simple. The only thing I could say to you is motorlock it to create custom angles and have a more intricate design with more details and giving it a more 'realistic' look. But that isnt really needed due to us playing a Lego game so I suggest you be proud of your build and show it off to your friends. Looks good
creations-chat 2021-12-12 20:40:01 Tbh not much to look at rn so I'm not going to say anything other than it's looking ok rn. Has potential to be good
creations-chat 2021-12-12 20:42:04 Well you either don't or you motorlock it down which can be up to 9 blocks tall. I haven't done it my self but seen it done on 3 carriers, two 6fold and one 7fold
creations-chat 2021-12-12 20:44:38 Then he would love me cause I over motorlock to the point that I don't actually have enough motors to finish the build. Funny thing is it's not all spam lock cause I compact and maximize all the motors, just get absorbed into getting the exact positions with pistons and angling
creations-chat 2021-12-12 20:49:07 Yea, it's insane
creations-chat 2021-12-12 20:51:24 Nah, I started on a typhoon and because I loose motivation way to quickly I want to at least make it to the wings. I have about 10 uncompleted builds cause of that.

creations-chat 2021-12-12 21:04:52 I mean this is a Lego game. Don't expect the builds to be realistic

creations-chat 2022-01-01 00:42:19 agreed
creations-chat 2022-01-01 01:01:05 i didnt, i spent like 2 hours
creations-chat 2022-01-01 07:55:26 sure
creations-chat 2022-01-01 07:57:29 Sure thing, il try my best
creations-chat 2022-01-01 08:00:35 the nozzels are in the middle and are made of control surfaces that are always angled so you need to keybind them, activate them and press / to get into chat so they stay like that. the afterburner is like so but settings will be secret as they are not mine
creations-chat 2022-01-02 19:28:10 thats a mig31 that image you are comparing it to
creations-chat 2022-01-02 19:38:45 ? you yourself are unable to build at this lvl 💀 *scrolling up <#504436696021204992> is fun* (thats a quote from you)
creations-chat 2022-01-02 19:40:48 uh yes. you are an idiot, this is a mig31 image. and the reason why the mig 25 looks like mig31 is because mig31 was developed from the mig25.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 19:43:07 you have dug ur own grave already. and yes that is mig25 you just sent. you are now half idiot

creations-chat 2022-04-04 20:34:41 idk, you figure it out. cba to play anymore after they prevented sparklers from loosing their base
creations-chat 2022-04-04 20:37:31 i just started a-10 then they fucked up the sparklers and im already burnt out enough from this game so i really dont have the effort to play anymore
creations-chat 2022-04-04 20:39:34 and i cant use use this bmp barrel either which is just perfect
creations-chat 2022-04-04 20:41:53 no, sparklers always had 4 welding points, the base and 3 of the 4 sides. the problem is you cant blow up the base of the sparklers to make clean barrels as you see from the images i posted. although i stopped playing a couple weeks ago so idk if they are fully fucked up now and they dont even weld, but i use sparklers alot personally for barrels and other details so its a massive loss for me so im on a temporary leave from the game lel. atm just crying in WT
creations-chat 2022-04-04 20:44:17 yep, thats literally all my builds using the tnt to blow up stuff. and a few other blocks dont work anyway so i only have old pics
creations-chat 2022-04-04 20:46:39 it is major rip. and WT isnt much of a good substitute to pass the time cause the grind is killing me. and yes thats the cockpit for b2 bomber, i was planning to make the whole thing but now that it cant spawn correctly anymore there is no point
creations-chat 2022-04-04 20:48:45 cause i don't post on creations channel cause only complete builds can go there, and i don't ever finish. anyway, this is the rotary system i was gonna add as well. 32 bombs in a 6.3 wide 3.2 tall areahttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/868583756246700095/944256359451480064/Roblox_2022-02-18_15-17-23_Trim.mp4

creations-chat 2022-04-05 05:40:13 63, 61, 61 for the nozzle
creations-chat 2022-04-05 05:47:15 its not accurate. your canopy to tall, your belly to low, the curve of the belly is to much, ur blocky af, the vertical stab is to short, the wings are to thin, and again, your blocky af. i wouldnt go so far as to say its a shit build because i image you put alot of effort into this and i respect that, but dont go around saying its accurate, especially in a lego game where nothing is accurate unless you are a pistonlock wizard. and ur cockpit is basic so dont go around claiming its overcomplicated
creations-chat 2022-04-05 05:50:53 maybe have landing gear and have the back curve to a point or something at the back like so, but this is just one zeppelin ofc so others might look different ofc. for me this is what a zeppelin looks like stereotypically
*my god i just re-read that and english 100 xd*
creations-chat 2022-04-05 05:52:55 sounds fun, gl on that and the rest of your build.

creations-chat 2022-04-05 06:05:14 
creations-chat 2022-04-05 06:13:34 yea, im already stuck on the barrel xd
creations-chat 2022-04-05 06:15:52 i was going to use this block for the end of le barrel but the smaller cylinder is to thick and i am angy
creations-chat 2022-04-05 06:18:04 plays like a tank in WT. a heavy one at that with its softkill armour xd. and disconnector is to long and not rounded so it triggers my ocd. also i do plan to use text for the side of the barrel to make those holes, i will mostlikely not make it hollow, i might though, the turret is smol so that would be hard to hide the motorlock
creations-chat 2022-04-05 06:20:08 OH SHIT NVM. i managed to remove that thick cylinder xd, ok, time to make le barrel lol
creations-chat 2022-04-05 06:24:13 just no
creations-chat 2022-04-05 06:26:19 ?why. ima just use text and motorlock and pistonlock lel. barrel wont aim up
creations-chat 2022-04-05 06:29:04 how would you go about using ropes? also just no, the f16 is perfect how it is and you just ruined it <:Jahy_Angry:728015184530243604>
creations-chat 2022-04-05 06:31:46 no i was commenting to both you on how to use ropes and that f16/mig23 cause 2min cooldown kinda depresso
creations-chat 2022-04-05 06:35:32 ?,i was asking you on how to use ropes for a barrel, then i also responded to <@!919488183639609435> about that f16/mig23 in the same message cause this 2 min cooldown is annoying
creations-chat 2022-04-05 06:38:04 ok i got the thin barrel piece, and now ima go to college. 👍  hopefully i still have motivation to keep making this puma when i come back
creations-chat 2022-04-05 15:00:50 skill
creations-chat 2022-04-05 15:02:55 ok, but still inaccurate. saying you prioritise function over looks is fine, but its still inaccurate.
creations-chat 2022-04-05 15:06:02 you can build simple if you want, no one cares. but its still inaccurate and doesnt look good, so dont bother trying to say its accurate or as accurate as you can get cause its pretty basic
bot-central 2022-04-05 15:07:45 -servers
creations-chat 2022-04-05 15:08:07 and you can make it 0.8 blocks. its called pistonlock and skill
creations-chat 2022-04-05 15:10:09 tbf, people are being a little harsh on them. i can agree its average. the thing is they talked about how its the most accurate p47 you can get and when they got shat on by everyone, they started to blame their bad hardware as an excuse, like it somehow makes their build better.
creations-chat 2022-04-05 15:17:11 lol my first motorlock build didnt even have working motorlock. my dumb ass connected the 2 pieces and i only realised like a year later when i actorly knew how to motorlock xd
creations-chat 2022-04-05 15:19:12 r3 is tame now. it got heavily up tiered. it didnt even perform that well at 4.7 and now its 5.0. whats cancer is PUMA at 8.3, god dam its a bmps worst nightmare. also gepard cause its fire rate is so high gijin cant register all of them so it just pens and kills with overpressure  👍 .

creations-chat 2022-04-05 17:46:23 no, people hate on your builds cause you say shit like *most accurate you can get* when it clearly isnt and then people harshly criticises your build. also they are things you can fix, your fuselage is 2 blocks wide, so you can make any kind of detail
creations-chat 2022-04-05 17:50:17 
creations-chat 2022-04-05 17:53:00 sorry to tell you bud, it no where near accurate. it lacks details, the fuselage is basic, canopy is way to tall (ik you have "upgraded" it a bit) but still basic. and basically all i can say is that its average. nothing special. not accurate or anything. it looks like a p47 but defiantly not accurate
creations-chat 2022-04-05 17:57:43 idk why they insist on defending their point on how their p47 is the most accurate p47 in game. like bruh, we dont care if you put alot of effort in your build or you wasted your time with a ruler and protractor on blueprints to get "accurate" measurements or how bad your hardware is. we also wouldn't care if you didn't put any effort or have a good PC ect. what we do know and care about is how you try to make your p47 seem like its the best you can get when it quite clearly isnt and you know that. stop buttering yourself by saying its perfect then making shitty excuses to why it cant be better
creations-chat 2022-04-05 18:00:14 Why do you guys put so much effort into criticizing a construction? Like why not eat a burger instead.

creations-chat 2022-04-05 19:38:28 and yes. wing span means wing tip to wing tip, i.e. its both wings and fuselage width together.
creations-chat 2022-04-05 19:43:18 gl, on your f14. those blueprints and 3d models should help and that website is good for payload when you get to that
creations-chat 2022-04-05 19:58:21 looks good
creations-chat 2022-04-05 20:01:39 
creations-chat 2022-04-05 20:06:35 no, they dont fold enough, just have them fold in more, and have the engines bigger
creations-chat 2022-04-05 20:15:07 I did got those values ages ago, it's 62 feet long and 1 block is 2.55 feet, but you then do 50% larger cause roscale so sorry, it's not 1:1, it's 1.5:1
creations-chat 2022-04-05 20:17:18 A block is around is about 75cm just of the top of my head, your avatar is 5.1 feet tall

creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:53:23 add more details to frontplate like those handles or the ring around the coaxial which for example could be done with smoke pipe. only saying cause you are clearly a good builder and i thought it might spice up ur build even more
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:57:55 i mean for me i took an 8 month break and came back better lol so i cant really relate to that xd. i planed to get worst but the opposite happened. cause i got to a point where builds took to long to make
creations-chat 2022-04-07 14:59:39 anyway, good luck on ur sherman, looks clean af
creations-chat 2022-04-07 15:23:59 PUMA atm... i will move those pistons at the top half a block down, just leave it as it is for now
creations-chat 2022-04-07 15:29:18 i got some, but now i play PUBG. i have funny suspension and i need a tank to put it on and the PUMA seemed like the easiest one to make

creations-chat 2022-05-12 19:09:08 its not massive, its average size, and you have plenty of plot space to angle lock and acturly put effort, ur just lazy
creations-chat 2022-05-12 19:10:52 ur barrel is to short looking at the width of ur turret and its also to short, needs to be a bit taller
creations-chat 2022-05-12 19:13:07 nah ur good. english is fine. i would say try make it half a block taller (it might be a bit to tall) but taller looks better than pancake turret <:Jahy_Derp:756971164475195475>.
also make the commander cupla shorter and wider, like 1.5 wide diameter
creations-chat 2022-05-12 19:17:38 yea definatly. also ignore the front part of this old challenger cupla but its a nice 1.5 wide cupla that you could use, its just rotating a motor with lock, ima try find a better version
creations-chat 2022-05-12 19:19:23 nah, this challenger turret is over 2 years old, havent even got it anymore xd
creations-chat 2022-05-12 19:21:21 newer version of cupla, i think i still got this t34, ima send its cupla in build mode

plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:29:58 counter rotate :/
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:30:09 or add control surfaces as rudder
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:30:14 like inside the build
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:30:37 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:30:43 add control surface as rudder
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:30:47 to counter
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:30:48 :/
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:30:58 inside ur build
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:31:19 i use mouse control
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:31:33 u could also have a tail rotor that works
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:31:37 that counters
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:31:45 and to turn u stop countering or add more counter
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:32:08 there are pobaly better heli rotors but thats all ik thats simple and silent :))
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:33:10 its only slight ajustment, helps for doing cas and aiming missiles
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:33:20 then keyboard control for big movements
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:33:30 u gotta be moving forward a bit though
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:33:44 its basicly a mouse control jet that can hover
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:33:52 i just use control surfaces to turn
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:33:56 its on my apache
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:34:01 the wings have control surface
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:34:05 to counter roll
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:34:12 and i got elevator to pitch up and down
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:34:18 and rudder to turn side to side
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:35:06 just motorlocked the rudders and elevators
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:35:23 the wings are the alerons
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:35:37 you can see the black control surface being use :))
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:36:17 rip
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:36:28 took me about 2 months of fiddling to work lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:37:04 im not good with helis xd
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:37:21 i might have heli technician but idk shit about them in game lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:38:30 i use w and s to pitch up and down, a and d to yaw left and right, q to boost foward, shift and ctrl to add collective or reduce, mouse control to pitch up and down and roll left and right
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:38:39 something like 70
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:38:41 on my main
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:38:51 i think about 90-100 overall

plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:40:12 i dont xd
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:40:26 i use shift and ctrl to go up and down
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:40:32 its natural for me
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:40:41 i like lots of controls
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:40:48 means i have full manual control
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:40:54 can do funny manuvers
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:41:24 i have standardised my controls :))
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:41:27 so i never forget

plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:42:53 problem with learning motorlock now is that u try what people have been doing for the past 2-3 years so obviouse you struggle with motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:42:57 but for us its simple
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:43:13 2019 is when it started to kick off
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:43:37 you only really saw motorlock in private servers and stuff, rarely found someone in public with it
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:43:58 someone
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:44:02 now its everyone
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 19:44:21 lol i still rememeber the first time seeing motorlock xd

HOW WAS THAT SPAM it was a normal sentance:/
creations-chat 2022-05-30 12:21:02 i was working out the values as i was typing, i can clean it up and put the values with an image
creations-chat 2022-05-30 12:23:19 cause i can do both at the same time having my phone next to me 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-05-30 12:52:06 1:1 f16 (1 block is 2feet 6.5 inches as your character is 5 feet 1 inch and 1 block is half a character)
creations-chat 2022-05-30 12:54:55 lol, from those values u should be able to work out the rest of the other dimentions
creations-chat 2022-05-30 12:59:57 not really, thats cause a block is 2 feet 6.5 inches as the character is 5 feet 1 inch and 1 block is half a character tall
creations-chat 2022-05-30 13:02:01 oh yea the fuselage is not 2 wide, the leading edge makes its wider though

plane-crazy 2022-10-01 06:06:59 ok :/
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 06:07:17 yes im british :/
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 11:59:27 just use motorlock and pistonlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:00:15 overtime you will get really good at pistonlock and motorlock to do stuff like this
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:12:05 same as motorlock but with pistons. just put the lock setting and toggle on the piston and you can choose how far to push a block
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:12:16 its 100 times more precise than motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:12:51 i think i overuse them the most T_T
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:13:02 yea limit your pistons to under 100
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:13:12 anything more and you struggle to spawn in
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:13:15 mhm
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:13:57 somehow i always manage to exceed that 100 before i even finish a turret on a tank or a aircraft nose :/
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:14:35 well im waiting for pc2 so pistons and motors dont have seizers
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:14:40 yea
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:14:47 then i can finnaly use all 1000 pistons
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:15:02 mhm
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:15:20 i only have half aircraft noses waiting to be completed xd
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:15:41 i just use mutiple keybinds for pistons
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:15:45 so i move like have of them
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:15:50 then the other halve
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:16:35 that does the opposite for me
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:16:48 pistons move different to what i set them as when i do that
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:17:04 i already do that
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:17:05 doesnt work
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:17:10 pistons still spasm
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:17:19 but tbf i do use a crap ton
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:17:44 not for me
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:17:57 they just keep reseting themselves
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:18:20 i build until that happens then i quite on that project and leave it waiting for pc2
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:18:41 no point trying on it if it wont spawn
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:19:06 also when motors move at different speeds to what you set them is very triggering
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:19:21 my mig15 nose isnt smooth cause motors are broken :((
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:20:00 its like i set them all to lets say 0.3 but on of the 8 motors decide to do 0.4
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:20:24 i was making a mig15 but i got to a point of pistons and motors being annoying
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:20:37 and i was making a harrier but the alerons dont want to work so i quite on that
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:20:50 ikr
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:20:58 the inconsistency of this game :/
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:21:42 mhm
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:22:32 yea my mig15 has 105 pistons rn and is already starting to be a bitch
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:22:52 lol 521 motors as well xd
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:23:01 💀
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:25:00 these 2 have the same settings as every other one and are not getting stuck anywhere but they move different speeds
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:25:46 they are 5 blocks behind the intake
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:25:57 so when i add the spacer they will be hidden
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:26:16 it is a fair amount of motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:26:35 and pistons xd
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:27:05 :))
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:27:21 
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:28:47 cheers
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:29:15 i need to upgrade the text though xd
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:29:41 just as good as the interior
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:29:47 just need to wait for pc2
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:30:08 no i wont
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:30:11 its summer 2023
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:30:47 i mean if pc2 doesnt come out il just quite xd
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:30:59 i have taken a 1 and a half break already
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:31:23 i came back now cause the alpha might come out soon so i gotta warm back up into motorlock xd
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:32:35 here is the clusterfuck of motors required to make that cockpit <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:33:11 i have enough motors and pistons to finish
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:33:32 ?
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:33:49 breh
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:33:55 i said fus alag
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:34:10 idk
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:34:12 anyway
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:34:23 those motorlock toweres can be used for the body and wings
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:34:34 i just build behind them
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:34:48 so although i have used more than half available motors rn
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:34:53 its all good
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:34:57 i shouldnt run out
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:37:17 should i build an f16 around one of these?
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:37:51 i mean build the vertical stab, elevators and engine, xd
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:38:01 i did a flight test with these
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:38:41 1 engine is 100 blocks in all
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:38:51 of motor :))
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:39:47 a cool engine
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:40:11 lol it acturly is xd
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:40:18 both engines together ate 924 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:40:21 so just under 500
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:40:47 thats what they were made for
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 12:41:33 that mig 15 is my latest thing

plane-crazy 2022-10-13 16:00:26 well you will have to wait till PC2 for a high effort build lol, im going for mid effort to low so i can finish it
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 16:00:42 ok
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 16:00:53 no
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 16:01:04 i want either typhoon ir eagle

plane-crazy 2022-10-13 16:03:39 should just do the cockpit of the f15 and wait till pc2 to finish when pistons dont die anymore?
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 16:04:03 summer 2023 lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 16:04:16 alpha is most likely start of next year

Its 6 blocks wide :))
What do you all think atm?
creations-chat 2022-12-18 20:54:26 tbf cant wait to make a 4 wide turret at the same level of detail that also rotates <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2022-12-18 21:03:57 yep, its gonna be fun xd, not only that but i have to hide all the motors in a tiny area whilst pistonlocking at same time and have it accurate <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152> . But first i should finish the hull xd
creations-chat 2022-12-18 21:11:06 its not that simple sadly, wish it could be but ima have to use every little braincell to figure it out lol
creations-chat 2022-12-18 21:13:36 il do the turret on a seperate save slot to see if it will work or not, if it doesnt work then i can go crazy ont he turrert
creations-chat 2022-12-18 21:18:07 rip
creations-chat 2022-12-18 21:22:30 motor 2 isnt an issue, il put an explosive block so it doesnt spasm when spawning in, its the fact that the turret will be 4 blocks wide, that wont be easy to do a very detailed tank , if i made my tank 1 block wider then thats a different story, first i gotta finish the hull anyway before worrying about the turret xd, still got a few issues i gotta overcome on the  hull
creations-chat 2022-12-18 21:25:38 im not a fan of cam lock, i prefer to just use motors ngl
creations-chat 2022-12-18 21:29:16 some sfx
creations-chat 2022-12-18 21:31:29 il experiment and see what i can do
creations-chat 2022-12-18 21:35:10 Ima head out but would also be really cool if u guys could ping me images of other peoples Tiger 1 so i could see where i could improve 👍
creations-chat 2022-12-18 21:37:25 Its 2 speakers together to make the "mg34" sfx *volume doesnt matter, depends how much u want to go deaf*
Also if you lower the pitch to 1.25 and 0.82 respectively, you get a dshka sfx for Russian tanks
creations-chat 2022-12-18 21:42:02 this is when you lower the pitch for the 12.7 sfx
A lot more meat to the sound
creations-chat 2022-12-18 21:55:32 This motor lock is my t90 for ages ago 😂
creations-chat 2022-12-18 22:42:42 could use half ball 🤷
creations-chat 2022-12-18 22:52:37 depending on the scale, you could do a half block then around it 4 half wedges to get a cleaner “rounded” look with 0 motor lock if u want
creations-chat 2022-12-19 22:04:20 Just experimenting with an f35b nozzle
creations-chat 2022-12-19 22:07:31 thoughts?
creations-chat 2022-12-19 22:10:59 thx, il make the rear of the aircraft tomorrow xd
creations-chat 2022-12-19 22:36:14 I just learned it 2 hours ago, it's pretty nice
creations-chat 2022-12-19 22:39:32 Rip
creations-chat 2022-12-19 22:42:32 Oh shit, I just realized I could make a super realistic rotor and everything at a small scale with Matlock
creations-chat 2022-12-19 22:45:06 Nice, just to help 1 block is 2feet 6.5inches as your character is 2 blocks tall at 5foot 1 inch
creations-chat 2022-12-19 22:49:29 Lol
creations-chat 2022-12-19 23:15:17 is secret xd, figure it out from what you see if you want it
creations-chat 2022-12-19 23:21:25 no, i remember when that tutorial came out and seeing it in every server was just cringe, 1x1
delta wings existed and this noob put 1x2 💀, was and still is the worst f16 i have ever seen
creations-chat 2022-12-19 23:24:00 -1000000000/10, you cant even tell its an f16 apart from having one engine 😂
creations-chat 2022-12-19 23:33:59 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/813320005331714049/839372202427940884/f16_2.PNG my f16 from same time looks like an f16 😂 and its still not as good as what others did back then
creations-chat 2022-12-20 07:27:26 shouldnt get to much cause there isnt much motorlock, but i would try
bot-central 2022-12-20 07:30:07 -servers
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:08:51 ur leopard looks good, these guys are just salty
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:14:58 you are calling it bad when its clearly not, you can dislike it if you want but you cant go around calling build bad, also small builds cool
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:17:39 its half an opinion, half a fact. you also got to be leanent to the fact that this build is small, so one thats 7 wide would obviously resemble a leopard more than this. this is a good build for its scale
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:20:33 start of rear fenders is finnaly done <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:22:53 thx, also managed to get the turret ring to be smooth lol
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:25:48 lol thx, i got plenty of space to add some pog interleaving roadwheels with suspension but i just realised, i might have been a little to smol for 2x2 wheels, so im praying
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:29:01 turret will be 4 blocks wide, so i have 4 options,
one: make a basic turret with what i can manage in that small of a space
two: dont have a working turret so i put motorlock inside the hull so its really detailed but wont rotate
three: attempt to mag lock the turret which gets both really high detail and it working but is laggy af and im new to it
four: add a panther turret to it (there was a panther turret on tiger hull irl xd)
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:31:29 ohhh porshe tiger? also noice turret, i an see how it was done from here, you just pistonlocked disconnector forward a little on the side of the mantle. il see what i can manage at 4 wide but will take some inspiration from yours
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:34:06 yes but i plan to make the edges cleaner and have a full detailed cupola like my drivers hatch and stuff 💀 . also i dont want any exposed motorlock like you have on the back of the turret otherwise it would look weird ontop of my hull which is super clean. il see what to do when i get to that point, first i gotta finish the hull xd
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:37:16 not at this scale. if i made it 9 blocks wide instead of 6 i might be able to get some basic interior, and 11 wide definitely could have interior, problem with this though is interior is laggy af and soaks up a bunch of motorlock which i would rather use for the exterior. i do enjoy making cockpits for aircraft though xd
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:40:09 
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:42:31 just keep building and trying to make the next build even better and over time you will improve
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:44:49 i havent finished a build in 2 years, i just build sections. this tiger hull i have is the closest i have gotten to finishing a build <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:49:45 PCC in a nutshell ngl
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:52:16 lol thx xd
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:54:19 same xd, ima quickly finish the rear fenders and move onto the ass <a:PepeLaughA:702582895499542579>
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:59:01 only used 506 motors and 90 pistons <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2022-12-20 09:01:05 it is a lot when you consider the fact that im only half way done with the hull 💀 
I plan to make it around 700 motors and 150 pistons so i have 300 motors to play around with the turret. the issue i have a lot of pistons and they produce the majority of the lag

Also doesnt matter cause that nozzle crashes ur game xd
creations-chat 2022-12-20 09:13:09 use control surfaces so they slide nicely with each other. you can also use text but i went for this design cause i like my aircraft to be solid xd

Lol, i dare someone to try make this tank xd
creations-chat 2022-12-20 09:17:43 rotate 4 out of 5 peices, so 0.0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6
creations-chat 2022-12-20 09:22:14 before 11:30am i can spawn perfectly fine at 80 ping. after 11:30 when more people are playing roblox so the servers start to lag, it rises to 1k very quickly and if im not careful 20k within 10 seconds. i have managed to get to 207k already
creations-chat 2022-12-20 09:24:45 its just the servers are cant handle the size of its player base so games like plane crazy have to suffer with roblox lack of wanting to expand their server size
creations-chat 2022-12-20 09:26:48 see at that point i just alt f4 then rejoin cause its faster that way than waiting over 8 minutes for the ping to settle down <:stuff:908917207986208828>

I haven't converted the dimensions into in game blocks
creations-chat 2022-12-20 16:41:26 i just got lazy and did it super simple xd. Dimensions should be similar to the spitfire though
creations-chat 2022-12-20 16:43:28 legacy have smol intakes, you could use control surfaces to get the circular shape like on f16 intake but idk, il experiment with it
creations-chat 2022-12-20 17:53:55 here is a control surface intake for your legacy
creations-chat 2022-12-20 17:55:56 here its in build mode, its really simple ofc but you can upgrade or something if you want
creations-chat 2022-12-20 18:03:12 👍
creations-chat 2022-12-20 18:06:43 lol thx, the motorlock was nice for this one and all stayed roughly within a 1x2 block sized area <:PogU:670373666164572172>
creations-chat 2022-12-20 18:15:04 its an aircraft, not a convertible
add a canopy first lol
creations-chat 2022-12-20 18:18:13 thx, im adding the other side now cause i now feel like making the whole engine peice xd
creations-chat 2022-12-20 18:23:01 <@744591826891046943> wing pannel intake idea already taken, come up with another <:clueless:942802644043464734> <:stuff:908917207986208828> <:trollface:775024642104229898>

creations-chat 2022-12-20 18:29:50 <a:PepeHandSad:796643639366516758>
creations-chat 2022-12-20 18:32:32 intake 👍
creations-chat 2022-12-20 18:42:23 angled them a little inwards cause they do slightly at first, also fits a 2 wide 👍
They are a little chonky compaired to the real things but meh, big intakes = more power <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-12-20 19:02:48 idk maybe 🤷‍♂️ , im not make the aircraft, just did the front part of the intakes. also probably not because the legacy intakes are not cylindrical and my intakes wouldnt be hollow all the way, only this front part
creations-chat 2022-12-20 19:15:34 nah, if ur lazy use rounded wedge, otherwise just angle lock more wing pannels
creations-chat 2022-12-20 19:18:26 more like cd-∞

game?

creations-chat 2022-12-20 20:16:19 you need image role
creations-chat 2022-12-20 20:18:53 yea kinda, you can also angle lock
creations-chat 2022-12-20 20:23:44 you can angle lock the leading edge a little like how this f16 leading edge is angled
creations-chat 2022-12-20 20:27:33 its got thickness to it, you just angle lock wedges
creations-chat 2022-12-20 20:35:31 yes, im thinking about redoing it lol
creations-chat 2022-12-20 22:32:44 Cam or maglocked?
creations-chat 2022-12-20 22:34:48 Which thingy 🤣, I have only been playing for 3 days since a year break and I'm now learning all sorts of things I missed 🤣
creations-chat 2022-12-20 22:38:36 Damn, that's pretty handy, il experiment with it tomorrow 🤣

creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:04:20 magic
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:07:40 pistonlock
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:09:43 no, never have an angling issue cause i keybind them all to one key. pistons can get a little annoying when you reach about 100 but you gotta be going for crazy detail to need 100
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:11:45 not really, standards have dropped since 2021, its so easy to get upvotes now. people used to be stricter before 👍
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:15:25 that has always been the case in this community, although not as often now as it used to be. pretty much every post, even ones with 100 would get harshly judged by some people who i wont name. and getting 100 upvotes then is like getting 200-300 now. that is why you need more upvotes to get roles because its easier to get them now, otherwise most people would have designer rank V lol
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:18:53 you only have one chance to angle, so hold the key down for a certain amount of time then stop and what ever angle it is, you cant change, obviously this is only when you are angling a high amount of motors, small amount of angles are fine
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:21:05 because its bad. if a build is good you get upvotes, if its bad you get downvotes, if its mid you get mixed results. that build would never get upvotes, even when motorlock wasnt a thing,
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:30:18 People upvote builds that they really like, and usally that means that build was made better than what said person can do themselves. because of this, the standard to getting upvotes require you to build above average. oppositely you get downvotes. because there is a large variation of player abilities in this game, there is a large grey area so you see many builds with similar upvotes and downvotes. however, getting upvotes is much easier than before, as long as you build slightly above average.
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:33:18 exactly. right now, if you build a decent build you can get designer rank V pretty easily if you post at the right hours. before it required very high quality builds to get up to 100 upvotes apart from meme builds like that single block. but those need to be original so theres that challenge as well
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:40:00 ima test this out
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:43:31 fair enough, in short, new people joining with no standards, experienced players with high standards leaving... standards in all are getting lower

creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:52:38 how is it to big? you do know roscale isnt the only scale 😂
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:54:44 motorlock it another half a block down again
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:56:46 like this or something
creations-chat 2022-12-21 15:02:32 👍  what were you making anyway?
creations-chat 2022-12-21 15:04:40 didnt you want them next to eachother?, how do you want them
creations-chat 2022-12-21 15:06:43 for a basic f14 intake i would just make a normal rectangle first then angle the whole peice to get that slant. its simpler than what you are trying to do and gets really nice results
creations-chat 2022-12-21 15:15:19 here is a basic example of making it a rectangle then angling the whole intake
creations-chat 2022-12-21 15:17:25 nose looks good but to thin and your canopy is way to short and your intakes are way to thin
creations-chat 2022-12-21 15:20:05 <@760578875163410432> here are some f14 blueprints and 3d model to help if you need

creations-chat 2022-12-21 15:45:21 I'm pretty sure i have seen someone make one a while back. If you want one make it yourself though, you wont get anywhere copying someones build, plus you don't get the satisfaction of completing your own build
creations-chat 2022-12-21 15:49:24 just angle a 1x2 delta wing or something idk
creations-chat 2022-12-21 15:51:28 this section?
creations-chat 2022-12-21 15:54:10 yf23 is relatively flat the belly, and the top part should be to hard
creations-chat 2022-12-21 15:58:15 this would prob look better

creations-chat 2022-12-21 16:19:47 here is something you could do for the shape of the engine 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-12-21 16:32:00 something you could do i guess
creations-chat 2022-12-21 16:40:53 just add a shit ton
creations-chat 2022-12-21 16:51:53 🤓
bug-reports 2022-12-21 17:08:01 high end fighter jet engines produce around 100,000N to 150,000N of wet thrust however the ingame jet engines only dont have afterburner and dry thrust on high end jet engines are around 50,000N to 80,000N
bug-reports 2022-12-21 17:12:00 the jet engine in game is small, the best irl comparison at high end would be the General Electric J85-GE-17A turbojet engines which has 12,000N thrust used on the A-37 Dragonfly
bug-reports 2022-12-21 17:13:20 thats because wings are modelled to drag rather than lift 🤦‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-12-21 17:31:18 so true
creations-chat 2022-12-21 17:36:24 roscale a-10 would be 20.5 blocks long
creations-chat 2022-12-21 17:47:13 ok
creations-chat 2022-12-21 17:53:24 if its 6.5 wide and 9 long and 3.5 tall you could fit the rotary bomb system i made lol
creations-chat 2022-12-21 18:12:15 would be cool if you fit one in ur b2 lol
creations-chat 2022-12-21 18:48:33 that is compared to avatar, a-10 is 16 meters long and 1 block is 2.55 feet as your character is 5.1 feet tall. so a-10 would be 20.5 blocks long, not 23 blocks
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:00:12 no, mathematically its 20.58 blocks long. roblox avatar is 5.1 feet tall, you can search it up. that makes one block 2.55 feet and therefore, the a-10 is 20.5 blocks long, scaled to your character. that is what roscale is. 

The roblox avatar is just modelled of your average american child
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:04:04 depends, because roblox also stated that the avatar is 5.1 feet, therefore making a block 0.78 meters 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:06:16 im also using official measurements given by roblox by comparing a block to your avatar 🤷‍♂️ , we are both right so we wont get anywhere
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:08:45 it is if you scale it to your character 🤦‍♂️ , its both 0.7 meters and 0.78 meters
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:12:24 it is though, because we got 2 official measurements for the block. we got rick saying a block is 2.5 studs which makes it 0.7 meters but we also know that its half the size of your roblox character which roblox has officially said its 5.1 feet, therefore it is both 0.7 meters and 0.78 meters, its relative, depends on which one you use
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:14:29 first google search 🤦‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:16:34 source is roblox, its official 🤦‍♂️, rick could be wrong and its 2.75 studs
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:19:32 its given by amazon which is a trusted site, its not like some sketchy website. they would have gotten 5.1 feet from roblox
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:21:56 hmmm, true that
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:25:35 ever considered the fact that i may dont have studios so i was going of google searches 🤦‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:28:05 you stupid or something? it literally says 5.5 studs in google searches, so how else would i find out its 5 studs 🤦‍♂️
I just need to magically know its 5 studs
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:33:20 ???, wdym eyes <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152> 😂 . im not a fucking computer xd, i search, i get 5.5 studs, i believe character is 5.5 studs until now that there is evidence on studios that your character is 5 studs instead

that has to be the most bullshit response i have seen "jUsT uSe YoUr EyEs"
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:35:31 My point has been proven, its not that hard to get designer rank V, standards have dropped 😂
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:37:34 or mabye, just maybe... hear me out... I dont play other building game on roblox. omg unreal right. I only play plane crazy on roblox instead of other games. crazy right. im so unobservant for not knowing the exact height of your character just from eye balling it<:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152> <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:39:36 me not playing other building games isnt unobservant 🤦‍♂️ , i just cant be bothered to play other games on roblox, there is nothing wrong with not wanting to play other games😂
You just proved to me that you are an idiot
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:42:40 i made this then never played it again, my point still stands
I Favorited it because it looked cool at first, then i saw the block limiter and realised i cant build at this depth so quite the game, i would have moved to this from plane crazy if there wasnt a block limter
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:47:39 i did, idk what you are trying to say 😂
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:51:43 so true lol
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:55:33 bruhhhh, its good but id say should be around designer 3 good, not 5
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:58:01 damn, this is mine in 5 hours rn
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:00:03 you saying its impossible to get designer rank V cause standards are to high, literally just did it with a basic runway with like 3 motorlocks xd
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:03:00 yes i was waiting to get last laugh, i did. and going of your point about decent builds getting bombarded by dislikes, i only got 2 😂 , ur standards are just way to low
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:05:40 that runway is from 2021 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:08:13 never xd, i got a su57, t55, f18, mig15, b2, f5, tiger, spitfire, t-90, f35, f-2, and mi28 to finish off lol
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:16:57 yes, every day
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:25:41 its cool
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:39:42 its cool, although i would refrain from saying its the only one because there has been a lot of unique builds made in this game for the past couple of years
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:42:22 there has been this many posts in creation chat alone, most people here dont post their stuff so the number is much higher. then you also need to consider that a large proportion of people are not in PCC, its doubtful that your the only one. it may be a rare plane but there are people who have made extremely unique builds to
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:44:36 tbf, su57 is a fat aircraft
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:46:37 a lot of scrolling through images, websites and different browsers, sometime vpn is required
creations-chat 2022-12-21 21:22:42 true
creations-chat 2022-12-21 21:30:44 they also used a shader or edited the image
creations-chat 2022-12-21 21:33:06 PCC is a funny place, you will get used to it. my simple runway is at 112 - 2 ratio lol
creations-chat 2022-12-21 21:35:38 my thought process to why its gotten those downvotes could be because the wings and a little rough and the colours are pretty bright 🤷‍♂️ , i like it though
creations-chat 2022-12-21 21:44:02 xd
general 2022-12-22 07:27:49 this a real build?
general 2022-12-22 07:28:10 lol
creations-chat 2022-12-22 07:29:22 just use one instead of 2
bug-reports 2022-12-22 07:32:12 ok, well this is a roblox game
bug-reports 2022-12-22 07:32:23 the game is already breaking as it is and lags so much
bug-reports 2022-12-22 07:32:45 and no one uses jet engines anyway, only new players would
bug-reports 2022-12-22 07:33:06 use hover engine, its faster, silent and less laggy
bug-reports 2022-12-22 07:34:50 its not about their weight, its how much they can produce lift at high aoa
bug-reports 2022-12-22 07:38:22 an A-380 for example has a landing speed of around 130knots-140knots where as a mig21 which is a very light jet has a landing speed of 180 knots. yes weight is a factor ofc but a larger aircraft will have larger wings that produce more lift to counter the weight. also i cant think of any jet aircraft that cant go past 200 knots ngl
bug-reports 2022-12-22 07:40:40 most modern airliners can reach speeds of around mach 0.6-0.9 which is much faster than 200 knots. if you want this kind of detail to a game, play microsoft flight sim or DCS because you will never see it in plane crazy. although just incase you want to feel better, rick already confirmed there will be lift and air in PC2 so you can glide which you cant do right now
creations-chat 2022-12-22 09:04:09 thoughts so far?
creations-chat 2022-12-22 09:07:22 it does, this is my mig31 afterburner, il change the colours to match f16 afterburner but this is how it looks
creations-chat 2022-12-22 09:09:24 It is very possible. its acturly a pretty simple system. you just attach the text block to a helium block above your aircraft and that always stays up so acts as a gyro so your cross hair moves, obviously the downfall is you have a helium block above your canopy 😂
creations-chat 2022-12-22 09:12:17 its dependent on speed, if i fly slow the burner is small, if i fly fast its long, thats just how it is
creations-chat 2022-12-22 09:28:05 you could start by putting some signs
creations-chat 2022-12-22 09:39:31 only when you add an unnecessary amount like this
creations-chat 2022-12-22 09:46:50 it has the warthunder hud 💀
creations-chat 2022-12-22 10:13:41 rip
creations-chat 2022-12-22 10:35:11 motorlocked mutiple text blocks into eachother
creations-chat 2022-12-22 10:46:51 le butt
creations-chat 2022-12-22 10:49:10 i did use signs before to make it cleaner but my game kept crashing so this will have to do
creations-chat 2022-12-22 10:51:18 how does the angle look?
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:00:55 a video of what happens might be best
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:04:39 👍
<@632872815615541250> you can just send me the video through messages, il see what i can do
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:16:28 you could mag lock a prop to have a more detailed one that also spins in that area, but ur corsair looks great otherwise
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:18:50 ngl there isnt much to learn from mag lock, this is my first time doing it, you just lock blocks to the magnet and boom, you can remove the motorlock tower
creations-chat 2022-12-22 11:53:43 not that many motorlock but i am me tbh
bug-reports 2022-12-22 11:59:49 its extrememly laggy, if you were a good builder you would understand
bug-reports 2022-12-22 12:05:42 thats been a thing for years, its a bug that wont ever get fixed
creations-chat 2022-12-22 13:10:10 3 wide, the nozzles also move
creations-chat 2022-12-22 13:12:14 I don't have one but you can use text blocks to get the same effect at 2 wide
bug-reports 2022-12-22 16:45:12 im talking about motorlock and pistonlock, you are clearly not a very good builder so you wouldnt know. the game is extremely laggy and high end builders need to deal with this lag constantly. me for example cant even get a build finished without the game breaking
creations-chat 2022-12-22 16:46:22 control surfaces dont produce much drag so it doesnt affect performance that much, i have already flight tested these nozzles. also that "block" is a 1x1 water prop motorlocked into a 2x2 or 3x3 water prop (i cant remember which one)
creations-chat 2022-12-22 16:51:16 I wont be able to make it to the nose as i have already used to many pistons, I can barely spawn in and i only started work on the body. Probably wont be able to even get wings before the game breaks when i attempt to spawn.
If i was going to do a nose i got this nose design from 2020 which can be improved on
creations-chat 2022-12-22 16:55:14 i have decided to give up on it cause its a dead end making it, i need to build less accurately and detailed if i want to finish cause my piston usage is way to high atm <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152> <a:PepeHandSad:796643639366516758>
creations-chat 2022-12-22 16:57:17 same situation with my tiger hull, i cant spawn it in anymore and im only half way done with it, my mig15 cockpit is same situation and my f35 cant even start cause the maglock crashes my game all the time <:sad:925200553607303179>

Maybe il learn cam lock and make small builds in the mean time, i just want to make something, havent made anything in 2 years
creations-chat 2022-12-22 17:01:33 what the hell, what kind of standards allow this many upvotes???, literally half the builds below it are better xd
creations-chat 2022-12-22 17:03:52 only idiots like me try to make something knowing the game cant handle it
creations-chat 2022-12-22 17:07:50 this has over 500 motors and 90 pistons atm and take about 30 min to spawn in atm, pretty much given up cause its a whole days work to just get a couple new details, not including how many times my game crashes and i have to respawn cause ping rockets to 200k half the time
creations-chat 2022-12-22 17:09:52 actually an underestimate, had a few spawns that take an hour, i watch YT whilst i wait for the pistons to move <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>, if im lucky i can spawn in 10-20 min, thats been timmed lol
creations-chat 2022-12-22 17:14:41 i dont anymore, thats why i gave up on it
I only put up with it to get those pictures and im never spawning it again
creations-chat 2022-12-22 17:17:21 i need to remake my mini apache lol,
creations-chat 2022-12-22 17:19:51 I miss having the ability to remove sparkler base, literally started work on a t80 and next thing ik the barrel doesn't work anymore <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2022-12-22 17:22:04 you cant, they removed it. settings where blast radius 1.4
creations-chat 2022-12-22 17:24:35 lol, i would like to do a joint project with someone but ik i would never finish my part lol

<@569539731088736258> i have only made one runway and both of those are 2 years old <:PogU:670373666164572172> 

<@779482180924997682> you definitely right lol, people with airliners love landing on it as its longer than the plots xd
creations-chat 2022-12-22 17:26:37 you can go up to 1.8 before it starts to break the whole thing, ima just test if they added it back
creations-chat 2022-12-22 17:29:23 i have always done it like this
creations-chat 2022-12-22 17:32:23 it doesnt work, you put blast radius to 1.76 and it does nothing, you put blast radius to 1.77 and it breaks the sparklers

You cant remove the base of sparklers unless there is a new technique but i think the base is now part of the whole thing
creations-chat 2022-12-22 17:35:55 it hasnt been working for a year lol
help 2022-12-22 17:42:19 :((
help 2022-12-22 17:42:44 dont

creations-chat 2022-12-22 18:26:40 you need the image role i think
creations-chat 2022-12-22 19:05:52 lol
creations-chat 2022-12-22 20:57:46 
creations-chat 2022-12-23 09:22:40 lol np, glad they fit, and your welcome for your first pistonlock experience lol
creations-chat 2022-12-23 09:52:08 magic
creations-chat 2022-12-23 10:43:10 no one cares about pvp lol. plane crazys pvp is extremely dull and uneventful, it can only be fun when 2 opponents are pretty equal in abilities and how often does that happen 😂
creations-chat 2022-12-23 10:48:48 you havent, i saw someone yesterday with same thing but explosive blocks, your idea isnt original
general 2022-12-23 10:49:42 warthunder
general 2022-12-23 10:49:50 warthunder better
general 2022-12-23 10:49:55 idk
general 2022-12-23 10:50:04 yes
general 2022-12-23 10:50:13 april fools events
creations-chat 2022-12-23 10:51:37 it used magnets just like yours do and he would yeet them into the air like a shotgun, your idea isnt original calm down bud
creations-chat 2022-12-23 10:54:00 his was suspended in the air just like yours and thats how he was using it, if you flew into it it did the same thing yours does, its no different

they just decided to yeet them into the air
creations-chat 2022-12-23 10:56:02 so did theirs, they used magnets to pick up all their explosives into a ball like yours then they yeeted them into aircraft annihilating them.
Your idea isnt original, calm down
creations-chat 2022-12-23 10:58:43 so did the other guy that would destory my aircraft when i flew near it, you are like a whole couple years behind using magnets lol, you really think no one ha ever made this before, having magnets for the past couple years, he litterally designed it the same, they shoot out because you release the magnets
creations-chat 2022-12-23 11:00:45 😂 , that is def not sophisticated, bruh its simple af, you just activate the magnets and it holds the cutters in place lol
creations-chat 2022-12-23 11:04:55 more traction like making the wheels out of fabric
creations-chat 2022-12-23 11:07:06 also <@908215416990605332> tough, you dont want to drift make it fabric otherwise dont complain
creations-chat 2022-12-23 11:09:13 no, just makes climbing hills harder
creations-chat 2022-12-23 11:25:58 pistonlock, but i could def learn some new stuff
creations-chat 2022-12-23 11:28:01 i dont like mag lock anymore, my game crashes everytime i use it so im not a fan, also cam lock is a pain to reset everything, what i want really is to just make something lol

atm, all i do is motorlock, piston lock and use tnt to remove parts of blocks to get cool details, its pretty basic in this sense, i just motorlock/pistonlock to much so my builds become impossible to spawn
creations-chat 2022-12-23 11:31:36 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1055809618456100884 my guy thinks angling 4 magnets is difficult 💀
creations-chat 2022-12-23 11:34:54 we dont, all you did was angle 4 magnets, put some more magnets behind them, put trails on the wheels and called it "detail" and talk about how adding a helium block is difficult 💀
oh and "hidden pilot seat" like thats never been done before, you are implying that lol
creations-chat 2022-12-23 11:37:49 no, that was my first heli and its not a tut, only tut i have done was some spitfire as my very first build in the game

It heli didnt fly 💀

I have never made a PC vid on YT
creations-chat 2022-12-23 11:40:56 fair enough, without motorlock that was really the only way to make a a littlebird i guess 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-12-23 14:01:35 ??
i mean i build to much motorlock for game to handle, and mag lock is buggy lol
creations-chat 2022-12-23 14:05:17 ik how it works, my issue is i cant finish any builds with effort because the game cant handle it, mag lock works fine, until you add a crap ton of stuff to it

I just need to hope PC2 come out soon and fixes these issues
creations-chat 2022-12-23 17:15:08 anyone got a large hanger door opening sound for plane crazy?
creations-chat 2022-12-24 08:41:24

creations-chat 2022-12-25 18:36:55 it wasnt flying then though <:PogU:670373666164572172>
I just need to make the body
creations-chat 2022-12-25 18:41:08 lol ima hop into vip 1 lol

Nvm no one there :((
creations-chat 2022-12-25 18:45:18 Its one of PCC private servers, you need to be ranks to access it. lower roles give you access to vip1 and vip2, expert roles give you access to vip3 and vip4 and master roles give you access to vip5 and vip6
general 2022-12-25 18:45:28 guess not
creations-chat 2022-12-25 18:47:20 i dont have access to 5 and 6 but if 3 and 4 are never used i doubt they are, occasionally 1 or 2 people vibe in them.
creations-chat 2022-12-25 18:49:49 lol
creations-chat 2022-12-25 18:51:51 people with large builds used to use it for lag reasons, but yea, alot of good builders left so its pretty empty now
creations-chat 2022-12-25 19:04:40 you will get better the more you do it
creations-chat 2022-12-26 19:46:45 you got a lucky shot on the one motor that holds everything <a:PepeHandSad:796643639366516758>
creations-chat 2022-12-26 19:49:10 i had no roll control <:nooo:787097964946259978> , fun dogfight though i was hoping to at least last longer than dark <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2022-12-26 19:52:01 pretty good, could probably smooth the back a little but other than that is alright
creations-chat 2022-12-26 19:54:33 i had 3 min to make the elevators and get controls and guns so i went with what ever i could work lol
creations-chat 2022-12-26 20:01:38 it was a build challenge to make a 50s jet in 1 hour, should have done a mig15 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2022-12-26 20:23:40 someone make this

creations-chat 2022-12-27 21:22:23 probably could have just cam locked the nose instead of pistonlock but meh, got some pretty annoying exposed motors but what can you do at this scale lol
Wings also move
creations-chat 2022-12-27 21:25:44 *closed*
creations-chat 2022-12-27 21:43:58 We gonna look sick in formation when done lol
creations-chat 2022-12-27 22:03:23 Make the blob fish out of water
creations-chat 2022-12-27 22:21:21 i suggest you delete the post in <#384025409945337856> before you get warned for posting a WIP, just a heads up 👍. For the colour add a hint of green so it becomes a little more orange and use the blue to make the colour more “dull” so its not so bright and out there the colour
creations-chat 2022-12-27 22:29:19 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1057020754740379819  not really, i mean this was able to get this many upvotes 😂, there is a fine line between what will get you lots of downvotes and what will get you not so many downvotes, either way standards are much lower than what they used to be
creations-chat 2022-12-27 22:31:35 much better, you could still tinker around with the colours to get slightly more accurate to the image, but you are definitely on the right track
creations-chat 2022-12-27 22:34:27 thank you, its ma t-55a with a custom skin and home made era on the front is plate infront of my ammo stowage, funnily enough since i added them, the chances of me getting ammo racked has dropped cause most people dont shoot them thinking they are real 💀
creations-chat 2022-12-27 22:37:27 tbh would make sense to fly in 0 grav cause apparently aerodynamics and gravity don’t apply in the starwars world lol
creations-chat 2022-12-27 22:40:54 ima need to add the tip of my x-wings  nose tomorrow so i cant wait to spend 3 hours procrastinating how to make the most detailed nose with minimal to no exposed motorlock, completely ignoring the fact that im 30% smaller than roscale
creations-chat 2022-12-27 22:43:10 you have fun making a rounded arrow head nose with a canopy that fits 2 seats at the same scale 👍

creations-chat 2022-12-28 08:42:45 your standards are to low, overall PCC standards have dropped slowly as good builders with "high" standards are leaving and a lot of new players are joining with no standards at all
creations-chat 2022-12-28 08:46:59 nah old looks good, it spices up the interior a bit, it wont take much motorlock though but do what you want
creations-chat 2022-12-28 09:17:04 make it a convertible
creations-chat 2022-12-31 12:46:39 yo, looking good, hows the nose doing after a few days 😂

creations-chat 2022-12-31 14:11:03 Nose looks great, il get back to work on my xwing soon
creations-chat 2022-12-31 14:18:17 Weird contrast with the messy nose and smooth body, I would suggest either rotating more wedges to get a smoother nose or make it even simpler, but the rest looks pretty good
creations-chat 2022-12-31 14:23:34 I wasn't taking about colours 🤦 on the topic of colours they seem a little bright, those colour code Apps aren't as good as using your eyes and messing around manually

And locking more wedges will make your nose much smoother, that's all I have against your nose, just looks weird as it's rough then smooth body
creations-chat 2022-12-31 14:28:47 It looks like you used the middle harrier for your colour pallet, if that's the case then you need to darken all your colours a little

Actually, a lot of darkening and toning will be needed if you are doing the middle one

creations-chat 2023-01-01 20:59:18 your nose looks ok from this angle, cant really tell otherwise. Your wings are way to big compared to your nose and  far to forward, you will need to reduce their size and push them back at least 2 blocks maybe 3. Your elevators are also to big but only slightly, you can reduce them by one block which will also clean up their shape making it look nicer. You should also widen your whole body by 1 block on both sides at least and separate the engines with at least 3 blocks space as su35 have widely spread engines. The overall shape of your wings are fine for no angled lock, but are just far to large for the scale that you're building at.
Because you need to essentially reshape your entire mid and back section of your aircraft, its would probably be easier to just delete everything apart from your nose and canopy and start from there again. You will also be able to add more details and things you forgot earlier. This is only if you want to be accurate to the su35 because right now you are extremely disproportional
creations-chat 2023-01-01 21:02:01 np, gl on the rest of your su35
creations-chat 2023-01-01 21:09:58 to be blunt, those people weren't entirely wrong in calling your su35 shit, but thats not productive for you to improve on, thats why i gave you tips on what to do and to restart from your canopy as you can definitely improve the geometry at least
creations-chat 2023-01-01 21:15:20 you can lengthen your body a bit more, keep it thicker for longer then start angling the tail, or do the tail in 2 angles, a shallow angle for the mid section then a sharper angle for the tail section, front view looks fine and height looks fine, but the tail needs to be a couple blocks longer for sure. Personally i would go for the 2 angles as its more accurate to the blueprint but you also have my first suggestion
creations-chat 2023-01-01 21:18:07 np, gl on the wings
creations-chat 2023-01-01 21:22:28 top down view, your aircraft has correct dimensions, but from side view its to short, so either make your aircraft shorter or longer + a little wider, now that you showed me the over lay

general 2023-01-01 22:39:19 where?
general 2023-01-01 22:41:09 oh yea sorry, not motors but part of motorlock structure, under the side fenders where the tracks go in the middle top corner, half wedge stick out a little sadly

creations-chat 2023-01-02 20:22:45 opinions on nose? i am not really a fan of the corners but meh, its smooth i guess. i was able to keep piston count low this time so i might be able to finish the whole build :))

I will angle the whole nose down dw, this is just it atm
creations-chat 2023-01-02 20:26:43 It is in studs per second however studs per second match kph pretty well. speed of sound in studs per second is only like 40 off speed of sound in kph so might as well call it kph
creations-chat 2023-01-02 20:32:01 the whole nose will angle down dw
creations-chat 2023-01-02 20:55:19 ok i have covered sides lol
creations-chat 2023-01-02 21:00:22 thx, got some smol details atm, will need to add some text at some point
creations-chat 2023-01-02 21:02:45 i plan to use this livery, also im in VIP 1, idk if u can join lacgame

Im just messing around with colours atm
creations-chat 2023-01-02 21:07:36 oh ok, for me its simple, i plan to get similar amounts of detail as this viper gun i did a while back
creations-chat 2023-01-03 06:39:22 idk if they change anything or not but isnt it 90 more than downvotes or just 90?

tbh should be at least 200 for expert, expert way to easy to get lol
creations-chat 2023-01-03 06:41:25 yes thats perfectly fine for HOF, that how many all HOF builds end up getting anyway, some reach 400 or something
creations-chat 2023-01-03 06:46:31 not really, this basic runway i posted a week ago was at a random time, it didnt reach 100 until the next day then 2 days for 200, if it was a high quality build it would be at 300 already
creations-chat 2023-01-03 06:48:47 lol
creations-chat 2023-01-03 06:52:52 the canopy seems a little to large compared to the nose and air frame in general, in height and length and if underneath that's an intake, its to large, but i cant see from this angle, other than that its alright, could be cleaned up in some more areas but that's for you to decide
creations-chat 2023-01-03 06:59:33 it doesnt look hard to make, canopy is pretty basic but thats just me ig
creations-chat 2023-01-03 07:04:01 its a nice idea but you just over complicated it, you wont be able to make it past the wings before the build dies, just simplified the nose a bit and settle for something not as piston demanding, if PC2 ever comes out, then you should be able to build that
creations-chat 2023-01-03 07:07:21 angle lock doesnt affect performance that much, and that idea of "its pvp" is bullshit, i have seen builds made just for pvp, look slightly worst than the builds in HOF, sometimes better and still annihilate every other build around it, also motorlock in pvp build isnt an issue cause you can just put a magnet inside, maglock everything so if your motors break, your build still holds, just saying
creations-chat 2023-01-03 07:10:09 its just weld on the magnet
creations-chat 2023-01-03 07:12:14 wings look good, your body seems to wide though
creations-chat 2023-01-03 07:15:34 that would be your only option if thats how large your body is, how wide is your body anyway?
creations-chat 2023-01-03 07:18:05 if your body is 5 wide, each wing should be 20 blocks long and 6 blocks wide at the root and 2 blocks wide at the tips, overall wingspan is around 45 blocks

Thats just scaling from the blueprint i sent
creations-chat 2023-01-03 07:24:15 gl
creations-chat 2023-01-03 07:26:48 that would make sense, cause you can reach 90 upvotes but also have 90 downvotes
creations-chat 2023-01-03 07:29:43 every t72 at that scale looks the same ngl
creations-chat 2023-01-03 07:40:33 which looks better for the nose, the new one with control surfaces, or the old one with half cylinder corners?

I can probably get the blend to the nose smoother but idk
creations-chat 2023-01-03 07:44:36 yea to bad thats not possible unless u want to create a lag bomb (i already did that)
creations-chat 2023-01-03 07:53:25 thx, i will just stick with the old one, its not rounded like irl but it is smoother so meh
creations-chat 2023-01-03 07:58:25 mig-29, i will angle the whole nose down dw
creations-chat 2023-01-03 08:06:15 control surfaces have little drag so they wouldn't have effected flight performance much
creations-chat 2023-01-03 08:11:43 f22 fulcrum
creations-chat 2023-01-03 08:15:09 yes
creations-chat 2023-01-03 08:22:05 much better yea
creations-chat 2023-01-03 08:26:34 oh for the diamond i just put 4 control surfaces into eachother, didnt require any pistons, for the large back cylinder i used 3x3 water prop and used explosives to remove the fan, the white part at the end is the top of a tip jar and the small black circle in the end is a horn which was fuzzy's idea, in all it only took 4 pistons
creations-chat 2023-01-03 08:30:20 nah, i have been crying and bitching a lot whilst making this, its not the most complex build i have made, in my standards it is fairly simple but i am in conflict with making this super accurate and detailed and trying to keep pistonlock count low so i can acturly finish and spawn in
creations-chat 2023-01-03 08:33:14 anyway, i have just managed to reduce piston count by 8 but increased motorlock by nearly 100 and overall block count by 100 lol, but thats less lag than what 8 pistons produce so good sacrifiece, also complexity increased alot lol
creations-chat 2023-01-03 08:35:51 for example all this extra motorlock in the second picture was all to remove 2 pistons and still be in the right place
creations-chat 2023-01-03 08:38:44 anyway, i got my driving practical today so if i dont rear end someone i will have my license, so wish me luck and il be back in a few hours lol
creations-chat 2023-01-03 18:19:48 canopy frame done
creations-chat 2023-01-03 18:31:46 its SR design, i was unsure whether to do this or wing light canopy frame but then did some math to work out how many motors i would have left and i would be left with roughly 300 motors to do the rest of the aircraft (thats how much i used for this nose already so not a lot)

So i obviously didnt do a wing light canopy frame which would have looked epic, i just would have run out of motors lol
creations-chat 2023-01-03 18:34:31 this nose only uses 26 pistons atm which for me is not much, usually i would be at around 40-50 pistons by now but SR showed me a method to keep piston count low which will help me a lot with lag reasons, in terms of motorlock its mainly towers so not to complex

Time to finish the rest of the canopy
creations-chat 2023-01-03 18:37:06 not really, i cant even finish a build lol
creations-chat 2023-01-03 18:40:00 I think your apache should be around rank III Designer level, not rank V, so unless your apache is a shitpost seyo is correct in saying standards have dropped 🤷‍♂️

creations-chat 2023-01-04 16:34:01 I used 6 pistons for the whole canopy frame and no pistonlock, its SRs design i think but you just rotate 2 trails to 45 degrees, its the simplest thing i got on that build apart from the pyramid wedge at the front lol
general 2023-01-04 16:37:48 you speedy boy, im still working on canopy lol

general 2023-01-04 16:43:42 thx xd
general 2023-01-04 16:43:54 i spent all yesterday removing 8 pistons for 100 motors
creations-chat 2023-01-04 16:59:07 no i have now just decided to give up on the mig29 cause the nose is starting to be a pain and i will only prob make it to the wing before it becomes impossible to spawn, so not gonna continue a doomed project lol
creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:02:31 it has only 26 pistons and 30 angles atm which isnt alot now, but i will be at 100 pistons and angles by the time i reach the wings which will be impossible to spawn, this build mode is just an undetailed nose with start of canopy
creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:05:19 ik all about what this game can handle, all these builds apart from the mig29 are failed cause game cant handle le motorlock
creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:07:40 the mig29 was 2 days in, mostly moving motorlock around to reduce the piston count but making my motorlock count reach 350 for half a nose lol <@773474989751664640> i dont want a low effort build, i want to make something at the best of my ability, il just have to wait for PC2 with the 11 times less lag
creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:10:30 i think il stick with making sections of stuff as a full build is impossible to make
creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:13:55 am i not allowed to make cockpits that acturly look good?

creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:21:11 im thinking of making an airliner and doing a similar cockpit, tbf the b2 i just gave up, it didnt really fail

Thats the idea lol
creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:23:14 Throttle and control stick move as well lol
creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:25:24 The mods dont care about shaders anymore because many players use them, including some of the top builders, so if they enforced the no shader rule, many good builders will be banned from the community and thats not a good idea, so mods kinda just stopped enforcing it and started to use it themselves, shaders do make your build look nicer by changing the lighting but its not actually editing the build or image
creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:27:51 it edits the lighting and makes edges and flat spots look differently, its not just a colour pallet

<@456226577798135808> rip boxness then lol
creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:31:12 nah im not playing rn
creations-chat 2023-01-04 17:33:14 nah all good
creations-chat 2023-01-04 19:39:45 your barrel is to short and your front plate should be more angled instead of flat but other than that its alright, also the roadwheels are a little funky, make them closer
creations-chat 2023-01-04 19:43:41 Although this isnt the t72B3 variant you did, this is the B variant anyway so geometry is the same, just different era package.

As you can see the 125mm is a really long gun and the front plate is much more sloped than what you did, it should be 69 degrees
creations-chat 2023-01-04 19:46:35 how am i being negative lol, i told them what was wrong with their build and gave them resources to help improve it, i didnt pick their build apart, just pointed out the obvious lol
creations-chat 2023-01-04 19:49:23 whats wrong with saying you failed at a build 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2023-01-04 19:51:30 you are good at getting details added and stuff, just got the proportions wrong thats all, at least you know how to build. just try to look more closely at things like blueprints to help get the correct angles then your builds will look better

Also i would put your t72 as an average build, i have def seen worst

I am in VIP1 lacgame
creations-chat 2023-01-04 19:54:25 im in Vip1 if you want to join
creations-chat 2023-01-04 19:56:41 When PCC sees exposed motor <:sadcry:892699033330679809>

Also never seen a very good build be harshly downvoted
creations-chat 2023-01-04 19:58:50 their front plate was nearly flat when it should be sloped at around 70 degrees, its not a minor issue, thats like saying a square the same as a triangle, however, exposed motors are unavoidable half the time, unless you are very experienced at hiding them, but majority of builders are unable to hide all their motors and on small builds, yea not happening
creations-chat 2023-01-04 20:04:18 cylinder canopy doesnt look good on some builds half the time
creations-chat 2023-01-04 20:07:57 **LacgamingALTac** is typing...
creations-chat 2023-01-04 20:10:01 what does it look like when all the trap doors are open
creations-chat 2023-01-04 20:14:27 LOL
creations-chat 2023-01-04 20:16:42 rip
creations-chat 2023-01-04 20:19:54 now we wait 2 min for the images
creations-chat 2023-01-04 20:26:56 would you be mad if i told you that your nose angles down to much
creations-chat 2023-01-04 20:43:21 should i remake this and make a-10 or make an f14?
creations-chat 2023-01-04 20:58:14 mag lock isnt fun so i will stick with the aircraft, il try remake this but use less pistons so it may be a little simpler
creations-chat 2023-01-04 21:00:17 what if i made this
creations-chat 2023-01-04 21:04:02 whats wrong with making popular aircraft? also i kinda want to make a VTOL as well lol
creations-chat 2023-01-04 21:06:08 but i could make the best f14 or a-10 nose in the game 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2023-01-04 21:08:48 i dont understand how they are boring 🤷‍♂️, if its a good build, doesnt matter what it is
creations-chat 2023-01-05 07:17:13 rip, il have to do somthing else then
creations-chat 2023-01-05 07:19:32 looks like a stealth su45 ngl, i was thinking to challenge my self and make a rafale cause in my opinion thats the hardest aircraft to make accurately
creations-chat 2023-01-05 07:28:24 I find roleplay on a lego game pretty cringy unless you can get a large group of friends and just mess around, then it can be fun ig. Personally i get my fun in the game by satisfaction of creating detailed builds 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2023-01-05 07:31:27 thats what i just said, those can be fun when you have a group of friends and its organised
<@773474989751664640> the game is made for all ages 👍 , and its personal preference
creations-chat 2023-01-05 07:34:51 because they are for all ages, they will advertise for parents to get their young kids to play as parents are the limiting factor to getting young kids to play, that is why they target them for advertisement, older people will just get the game or already had it when they were younger and just continue playing

Also i already got friends, i dont need to go friend hunting lol, id rather to a RP in games like squad or post scriptum with large amounts of people and do combat anyway
creations-chat 2023-01-05 07:37:15 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/719914644659109998/1060459109570334730/image.png anyway, wish me luck making this janked nose
creations-chat 2023-01-05 07:42:30 its not even a cone nose, so i cant do the normal cone and i gotta keep it smooth lol, i can prob do something similar
creations-chat 2023-01-05 07:46:34 nope, its curved the nose, not a cone like on mig21, so i cant do nose cone, also seen someone make nose cone rafale and my god it looks horrible, i could do a trail nose like darks f16 lol
creations-chat 2023-01-05 07:48:36 from side view, its flat cone, from top view its curved, not a perfect cone shape, cant do standard nose cone, unlike most people i want those slight details 🤷‍♂️ , anyway i got college, il do it when i get back lol
creations-chat 2023-01-05 09:54:25 I can make a trail nose and angle each trail individually, i have done it before and you get much better results than just rotating delta wing panels
creations-chat 2023-01-05 10:05:49 you need to be lvl 3 to send images i think, so just keep talking until you make it to level 3
creations-chat 2023-01-05 15:08:30 how? they are the best way for these types of noses lol
creations-chat 2023-01-05 15:11:12 trail noses when done properly are the best noses currently in the game, giving you both accuracy and smoothness, rather than the other blocky methods. also <@294980570885390346> thank you for offering help but i only plan to do the nose canopy and maybe intakes, not the whole aircraft so i can go piston crazy on the front portion of the aircraft until the game breaks 😂
creations-chat 2023-01-05 15:13:44 it should look as good as a normal rafale model in studios if done properly soooo, also im not making the whole aircraft, just the nose
creations-chat 2023-01-05 15:42:32 i wouldn’t underestimate what i can do with piston lock 😂, and again, i am only doing the nose, not the whole aircraft because the game wont be able to handle a fully detailed aircraft
creations-chat 2023-01-05 15:44:40 again, i am not making a cone nose, i am angling and pistonlocking each trail individually so there are no overlapping trails that making it unsmooth, i will custom angle everything so it is super smooth and accurate, because of this i am only doing the nose as the game cant handle a full aircraft at this quality
creations-chat 2023-01-05 16:06:00 because i want to make the most detailed rafale nose in game, i would make the full aircraft if i could but the game will probably break before i even finish the nose with what ima try do so, maybe in pc2 when the lag is reduced significantly
creations-chat 2023-01-05 16:08:20 why do you care how i make this nose anyway?
creations-chat 2023-01-05 16:10:34 lucky that i only post completed builds then
creations-chat 2023-01-05 16:20:19 you are bitching about me using trails for a nose design
creations-chat 2023-01-05 16:33:14 i just came back from college and getting all the dimensions lined up and translated into the game, i got alot of irl stuff to do so progress will be slow
creations-chat 2023-01-05 16:36:43 im in the UK, not america, its 16-18
creations-chat 2023-01-05 16:39:17 you have to go to college or apprenticeship, most are free as well but by law, you have to be under some form of education until you are 18, then you can go uni if you want or something
creations-chat 2023-01-05 16:41:54 yes, but its at the same level as our universities or your college. University just takes one of the 3 topics you do at british college and gets you to write a thesis
creations-chat 2023-01-05 16:45:02 even though we only do 3 or 4 subjects, its very difficult as you get into alot of detail on the topic, it was def much easier to do like 14 subjects that are broadly taught than this, but this is more fun because we do the subjects we enjoy
creations-chat 2023-01-05 16:47:43 american college is british university where you only do 1 subject for 3-5 years depending on the course, then you do your masters which is another 2-3 years then phd which is 2 years, ngl i think its stupid to do more than 3 subjects cause then you wont be able to teach each subject to a very high depth
british college is 3-4 subjects, university is 1-2 subjects
and secondary school gcse which is grade 7 or 8 depending on school to grade 10 is only 7-8 subjects
creations-chat 2023-01-05 16:51:08 im doing aerospace and mechanical engineering and might join an aprentaship up north england with bae to design an aircraft which sounds fun

Anyway, i gtg for now
creations-chat 2023-01-05 18:14:14 well tbf, i would prefer to pilot in RAF but piloting isnt available atm, its been closed for 3 years but its expected to open again soon so in the meantime il do engineering for aircraft
creations-chat 2023-01-05 18:17:38 Lucky me i actually want to fly in RAF, idealy fighter like euro of f35 but heli would also be cool
creations-chat 2023-01-05 18:19:44 noobs
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 06:49:45 yooo, you trying to make funny detailed seat
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 06:50:26 looking good
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:46:44 rip
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:47:16 i just started work on rafale nose and gotta do this about 20 times at least with dif angles <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:47:32 hate repetitive building lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:47:35 gets so boring
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:47:53 oof
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:47:57 lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:48:02 i will mag lock the nose
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:48:05 cause why not
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:48:14 i can detach it and have a radar dish inside
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:48:27 lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:48:29 anyway
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:48:31 ima go college
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 07:48:33 later
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 14:54:08 what
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 14:55:04 what so both look like?
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 14:55:40 also it doesnt matter how long a build took, you can spend months and still end up with a crap build 😂
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 14:56:27 i got my expert from an apache nose that would get assaulted if i posted again 😂
creations-chat 2023-01-06 14:59:06 why is the barrel to chonk?
creations-chat 2023-01-06 15:06:36 you could do a disconnector barrel or a jet engine barrel or a water prop barrel or just anything smaller than a cylinder 🤷
creations-chat 2023-01-06 15:09:21 this is a disconnector barrel i made ages ago, obviously it’s square but personally it looks better than a thick 1x1 cylinder, it also moves up and down so dw, the way you would make it is by connecting the disconnectors by a camera so it goes invisible then you detach the base
creations-chat 2023-01-06 15:11:30 yea, its a 5 wide 1.5 tall chally 2 turret that i never finished lol, its from like early 2021 or something
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:10:35 my rafale rn, guess which parts the nose
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:11:08 nah jk its my rafale nose in the works
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:11:14 guess what part is the nose lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:11:52 yas
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:12:38 nose rn
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:13:00 dm my sleep paralysis demon behind it
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:13:10 i need it to be 2 wide, 5 long
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:13:18 we dont have 1x5 delta wing pannels
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:13:21 so i make trail nose
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:13:27 simple
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:13:47 im only half way done with the nose
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:13:53 its gonna e twice the size
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:14:29 i used 965 trails rn lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:15:04 cause there is no otherway to make this rafale nose accuractly
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:15:18 how am i no life lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:15:26 cause i need 1x5
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:15:34 we dont have 1x5 wedges lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:16:00 no but it also needs to be a cone
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:17:04 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:17:06 it does
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:17:18 otherwise it doesnt look like rafale
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:18:25 mig29 is 17 meters long and 11 meters wide
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:18:37 its 2 meters longer and wider than f16
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:19:47 you also forgot the gils
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:19:52 and camera on nose
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:20:20 they are easy details to add
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 21:20:25 gl on the rest of ur build
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 22:01:27 im gonna redesign it to reduce 1000 trails and around 100 motors lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 22:03:11 it was 2 hours of copy pasta
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 22:03:29 its 1800 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 22:03:44 and i was chatting and zoning out
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 22:11:33 there are none hidding
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 22:11:43 it uses explosives to detach the motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:32:01 nose cone complete
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:32:20 the motorlock lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:32:38 4 hours cause i had to re do it do make it more compact
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:32:53 i completly redesigned it
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:32:57 mhm
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:33:03 now i gotta delete this nose
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:33:06 and re do it again
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:33:14 no
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:33:20 i detached the motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:33:25 its not part of the build
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:33:36 see
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:33:41 motorlock is not part of the nose
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:33:46 no i wont
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:33:51 thats why im deleting this
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:33:53 and redoing it
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:33:58 i have 211 motors left
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:34:05 i will try cam lock it
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:34:14 idk
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:34:25 ima wait for rick to get online and ask for 2k motors lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:34:55 nah, i only need around 700 for rest of build
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:35:08 also 0 pistons used
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:35:13 so this has 0 lag lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:35:22 also cause motorlock is removed
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:35:23 no lag
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:35:33 i just have no motors left sadly
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:36:35 glory hole
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:37:27 i can add a radar dish cause its hollow lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:37:57 also im over 3200 blocks already xd
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:38:08 tbh im not the only one
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:38:18 dark is in same situation as me cause we making same thing
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:38:22 just different methods
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:38:25 so he trying cam lock now
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:38:30 ima try urrr
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:38:43 what other building techniques are there?
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:39:15 we have tried relocate lock, this angle lock, now trying cam lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:39:21 mag lock is the best for keeping lag down
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:40:16 cause its mag lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:41:00 also i have
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:41:16 120 angles lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:41:55 rip
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:57:30 You can use one motor, to lock a whole motorlock tower, then detach that motorlock tower, and be left with the single motor holding everything else
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:57:47 its basicly mag lock, but not mag lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:57:54 but its not as compact
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:58:11 and you are limited to certain building styles where as mag lock has no limits
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:58:28 but mag lock can cause your PC to catch fire without warning
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:58:58 like, you make a build with its motorlock tower like normal, but then you connect all the parts to one motor and detach the motorlock tower from the build
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:59:16 its hard to explain
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:59:20 im not very experience at it
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:59:33 i prefer mag lock cause its easier to use and has no limiteds
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 13:59:47 i can build how you would make the motorlock tower for you
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 14:08:42 The normal colour blocks have default settings. The red motors are normal lock but with one keybind which is the same as the blue disconnectors keybind. Activate the blue disconnector and red motor first so you motorlock normally, then activate the normal disconnector to detach the motorlock tower. Springs or explosives are also fine as well <@447221768520859659>
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 14:09:15 but you are left with this little bit, you can prob reduce its size a little but not as much as you can with maglock, thats why i prefer mag lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 14:09:40 but both techniques are handy for removing whole sections of motorlock from your build if you want a detailed moving part
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 14:41:24 np
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 14:41:54 no they are normal motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 14:41:58 you dont activate them
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 14:42:13 then the red motors have keybind same as blue disconnector
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 14:42:23 you activate both blue and red together first
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 14:42:27 then detach the tower
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 14:42:33 using the non coloured disconnectors
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 20:32:08 
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 20:32:20 black smoke doesnt make it the same
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 20:32:38 where is ur mouth and eyes
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 20:33:08 thought it was a massive flying horn at first lol
creations-chat 2023-01-08 12:35:53 ikr
creations-chat 2023-01-08 12:45:24 you need to be lvl 3 to post images so you need to chat for a bit
creations-chat 2023-01-08 12:47:38 seems fine, i mean to make it better you would need to motorlock but looks alright
creations-chat 2023-01-08 12:50:08 1.5 wide xwing engine atm
creations-chat 2023-01-08 20:34:40 who needs wings, still flys in normal grav like a fighter jet lol
creations-chat 2023-01-08 20:51:30 did the funny landing omg
creations-chat 2023-01-08 21:01:42 It's from 2020 xd has like 5 motor lock lol
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:16:28 ngl idk if my nose looks that good on an f16, seems kinda thicc
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:43:23 make Mig-15 with a detailed cockpit cause the exterior is simple and large enough to hide the motorlock
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:48:25 thats why i said add interior :/
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:50:35 this is basic interior, im talking about proper interior, also this is mig15
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:52:52 yes, this is basic interior cause im using emojis instead of adding buttons with small blocks, a horn and some emoji that most people do doesnt count as a cockpit interior
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:55:52 got a new MiG-15 on the way lol, love this aircraft, this is for PVP so no pistonlock xd. Also the yellow throttle block is a 1x1 water prop with its fan removed with explosive
creations-chat 2023-01-09 06:58:01 I should use one of my alt accounts and make all migs from 1 onwards xd
creations-chat 2023-01-09 07:00:38 im not deleted my builds on my main and i already have 8 accounts that i use, might as well use one of them
creations-chat 2023-01-09 07:02:48 yea i just make alt accounts lol
creations-chat 2023-01-09 07:05:35 sounds like skill issue ngl, i still got builds from 2018 lol
creations-chat 2023-01-09 07:09:04 thats a shader, he means to gt 2 builds in one photo
creations-chat 2023-01-09 07:11:39 so close yet so far
creations-chat 2023-01-09 07:18:04 just moving some motors around lol
creations-chat 2023-01-09 07:27:12 this will have to do <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2023-01-09 07:30:52 hold the key down then enter chat
creations-chat 2023-01-09 07:33:15 you just angle motors, and move them around until it fits if u dont want to use pistons, thats what i did, an hour of trial and error and moving stuff around, Yea i connect everything with text blocks
creations-chat 2023-01-09 07:35:26 
creations-chat 2023-01-09 07:45:16 vip 1 but ima head out now anyway
creations-chat 2023-01-09 07:48:48 little messy but got sides
creations-chat 2023-01-09 11:46:38 it comes and goes, usually happens when a popular builder makes an f14 so their fan base all make f14 and other builders just make one because a large group of people are making them, its called herd behaviour and thats PCC in a nutshell
creations-chat 2023-01-09 15:57:07 bruh its the name of the aircraft its not a bypass
creations-chat 2023-01-09 21:27:17 I mean it's to tall, f16 has more of a pancake nose, that's why I don't think my jet engine nose design fits an f16 that well, there are better options
creations-chat 2023-01-09 21:30:27 I mean, it could be because your intake is flat atm which makes the nose look massive ig, I mean, I made that nose for a mig29 which has a conish nose and even they look weird on it, match's aircraft like f14 better

creations-chat 2023-01-10 19:21:13 <@745928932590616656> where ur intake at?
creations-chat 2023-01-10 19:25:00 MiG-15 atm anyway, idk but i just suddenly lost interest in this even though i keep telling my self its for pvp so it can be a little rough <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2023-01-10 19:29:41 nope, I will just maglock the whole aircraft so even if the motorlock is hit, the aircraft holds itself together, and if i add lots of magnets then even more survivable, i also have space to tnt armour the motorlock as well <:PogU:670373666164572172> , it will be more survivable than builds without motorlock xd, i also dont build off one tower, i made mutiple towers so i dont break in half if baddly hit as well

Also its not for the cancer pvp that pcc is, its realistic PVP with friends so we have normal speeds and turn times xd
creations-chat 2023-01-10 19:31:48 help
creations-chat 2023-01-10 19:35:36 love how high i sit xd, max visibility until i add the canopy frame and cant see shit
creations-chat 2023-01-10 19:37:40 best landing gear
creations-chat 2023-01-10 19:50:21 noi need to find the motivation to build this again
creations-chat 2023-01-10 20:00:25 tbh, at least my new mig15 looks a bit better than this old one lol
creations-chat 2023-01-10 20:02:43 <:nooo:787097964946259978>  i didnt knowwwww

But god damn my old mig was a thick boy
creations-chat 2023-01-10 20:09:43 wahwahwah it has no pistonlock and was ment to be an hour build
creations-chat 2023-01-10 20:11:51 https://drawingdatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/mig15-1.gif because i am unable to build without motorlock, it was already hard enough to not use pistons, at least with maglock it doesnt matter if the motors are hit, my build will still hold in place, il prob motorlock the thick wing root half a block or angle it or something idk, it sticks out
creations-chat 2023-01-10 20:16:31 oh yea, i forgot to add the two 23mm and 37mm gun xd
creations-chat 2023-01-11 16:54:34 it doesnt, i have clipped over 3000 blocks together fine
creations-chat 2023-01-11 16:56:39 Its all angled motors, i never use cameras cause they are annoying and im not using pistons cause its for PVP and i dont want to turn my PC into an oven when my build takes damage. They way i angle is by setting everything to one key then set motor speeds, otherwise i maglock and use motor 2 lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 16:57:45 what
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 17:02:19 k
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 17:02:32 how far up
plane-crazy 2023-01-11 17:03:16 ohg

creations-chat 2023-01-11 17:29:33 👍
creations-chat 2023-01-11 17:32:15 all good
general 2023-01-16 06:27:58 depends on the block you want to explode, i usally uses 1.8, 2.4 or 3 depending on the block, a few others need more precise settings but you can find that with trial and error. this is for blast radius, leave the rest default

creations-chat 2023-01-19 07:39:19 deck
creations-chat 2023-01-19 12:13:14 what ever nimitz class that has number 68
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 07:38:58 game speed is in studs per second. **1 stud is 0.28 meters** therefore **1 speed is 0.28 meters a second**. That is **1.008 kph** making speed of sound in game being **1225** speed in game. for simplicity reasons you might as well say speed in game is in kph
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 07:40:03 that makes **mach 10, 12250** speed in game
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 07:40:32 ^
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 07:40:58 idk what you used to get your speed but mach 10 is 12,250 speed
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 07:42:50 you are in the jet :/
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 07:43:33 thats all thats wrong with it to you?
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 07:46:53 omg he said the funny
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:40:40 nimitz rn
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:42:51 everything on deck is angled apart from the white parking thing on the right and number  <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:45:01 no cause im inexperienced in carrier building lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:45:27 this is the last carrier i have made xd
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:45:33 bro got outlines
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:47:20 i would say build flat
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:47:23 or something idk
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:48:27 this is it in build mode, its 6 plots tall in build mode and becomes 14 blocks tall when spawned. If your really good you can do it this compact but make it like 20-30 blocks tall but im new to this type of building so im doing 14 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:50:10 i thought it was big until i saw knights 5 fold lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:50:39 well this nimitz im doing will be 4.3 plots long and a plot wide
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:51:03 its a little smaller than half scale
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:51:14 its 212 blocks long when it should be 475 blocks long
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:51:37 but for first motorlocked carrier i think its fair idk
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:51:45 cant go wrong at this scale lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:51:58 might be able to add hall ways and room interior
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:53:26 i will need to move some motorlock around though
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:58:46 140p
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:59:15 just  gave it a fish eye lens
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:59:39 true lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:26:43 noice
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:27:56 damn gl
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:28:24 nimitz is a fairly easy hull to make
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:29:06 yep, its just these here
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:29:57 i should have enough space in here to add some more details as well
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:30:20 how long and wide?
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:31:20 lol this one tiny section here has 6 moving parts xd
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:31:27 ahh ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:31:41 yea my nimitz is planned to be 49 blocks wide, 212 blocks long
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:31:56 but im mostly winging it so it may be bigger
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:32:10 thats still small though
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:32:18 its only 4.3 plots long
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:32:41 you can build 9 plots long and 15 blocks tall nimitz just with less detail on the deck
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:32:52 and 2 plots wide
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:33:52 and a friend is doing a 6.3 plots long, 1 plot wide 31 block tall assault ship which my carrier will be able to fit inside 2 of his 3 hangers xd
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:34:28 mhm
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:34:44 i wont be able to fit in blubs hanger, i think im 2 blocks to tall
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:34:50 but darks hanger i fit
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:35:00 you can stack 2 of my carriers inside him lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:35:10 if you just shave my sides cause i am 2 blocks wider than him
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:35:29 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:35:36 wait whats volkern lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:36:02 ahhhh
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:36:47 meh, dont really need to join it anyway
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:36:57 the friend group server is active enough
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:37:30 also where has SR gone?
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:37:39 did he just die or something
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:40:36 he doesnt join VC with me for a while as well which is very unusual
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:40:58 bro was always awake and active
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:41:08 prob burnt himself out from being to active lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:44:45 yea
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:44:50 motor 2 lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:45:03 makes spawning in much easier
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:45:27 its also less laggy than normal motors
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:45:43 and you dont get the motor reset issue as long as you keep an eye on your ping
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:46:02 the only disadvantage to it is that its not as compact as motor 1 angling
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:46:17 but for a ship you got plety of space lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:46:20 exactly
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:46:37 for jets and small tanks you are limited on how much motor 2 lock you can do
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:46:42 if you mag lock though its fine
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:47:08 you can also use motor 2 lock to replace pistons with the combo of maglock
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:47:18 which further reduces lag
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:47:29 however your motor 1 count will increase alot
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:48:07 using all these technique for a jet i estimated around 2800k motor 1 for me at least which is a problem lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:48:29 i hope i dont run out of motors
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:48:33 for my ship
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:48:48 whats that?
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:49:13 breh i gotta finish this nimitz first
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 17:49:41 no but i can join
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:02:20 def hall of fame worthy
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:02:30 heck we need a new channel to praise this builder like god
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:02:57 no they didnt lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:03:04 PCC has always been toxic
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:03:14 its just everyone was bad
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:03:31 builds that get praised now will be seen as bad soon as well
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:04:11 thats because back then they were the best you could do
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:04:15 because motorlock didnt exist
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:04:29 people get better so standards get better
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:04:43 so builds like that will eventually get hatted on and seen as low effort
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:04:55 a good example is tanks
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:05:03 they arent really high
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:05:07 but going of my example
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:05:13 the m4 sherman was a great tank of its time
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:05:16 its shit now
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:05:40 motorlock allows for more indepth builds which raised the standards
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:06:17 and when you add things like pistonlock, maglock, cam lock, relocate lock, tnt lock, etc then you can do some pretty good builds
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:07:01 no you couldnt
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:07:05 the tutorials were always shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:07:30 i was playing at this time as well and i can tell you, no one ever liked the tutorials
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:07:44 not really
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:08:11 i wouldnt be playing this game
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:08:19 motorlock was a good thing
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:08:23 you just have skill issue
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:08:56 show a build then
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:09:10 thats not difficult
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:09:17 angle lock is like the basic requirement lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:09:29 not reall
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:09:41 i got it first time in 2020 pretty easy
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:10:05 i still got my first plane on my second account
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:10:51 first plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:11:08 yea im glad motorlock is a thing
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:11:53 lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:12:04 without motorlock you cant do pog stuff like this
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:12:25 sounds like skill issue to me
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:13:26 BIRD OF PREY
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:14:47 its 500 motors and 90 pistons lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:16:06 it is
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:16:10 i cant spawn in anymore
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:16:16 it has to many motors and pistons lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:16:58 not really
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:17:01 i have it on my carrier
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:17:05 ik what you mean
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:17:45 nope, still need angle lock and pistonlock to make top quality builds
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:17:58 you cant make a high quality build without angle lock and pistonlock
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:18:23 that creation is good yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:18:29 but you can make it much better
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:19:23 funny cockpit which you cant do without angle lock or pistonlock
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:19:37 you both just have skill issue lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:19:57 the aircraft is meh
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:20:06 its not smooth
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:20:19 the hanger is lovely
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:20:36 the aircraft is good
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:20:51 but it can be better with the help of pistonlock and angle lock
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:21:32 perfect lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:22:34 that jet is not the min standard
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:22:42 its a good build
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:22:58 but it lacks indepth detail and funny angles
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:23:08 its not though
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:23:46 
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:24:03 its lazy
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:24:28 lazy and doesnt look fine
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:24:42 its just a small detail for the builder to admire but for others, its just a horn
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:25:19 you can still get within PCC standards without motorlock, like this hovercraft which is on like the borderline of the standard
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:26:13 actually il test if that hovercraft is within standard
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:28:06 hovercraft
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:28:23 lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:28:36 you will get better the more you build
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:28:51 just try make the next build better than the one before
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:29:06 and dont fall back to being lazy
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:29:21 the harder you try to make the best build you can do, the quicker you will improve
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:29:33 good start
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:29:42 would be intresting to see a detailed weathered wall
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:30:27 well tbf i took a 2 year break from this game and came back better lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:30:56 the things we do to cure our boredom lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:31:00 anyway
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 18:31:05 ima go eat something
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 19:18:51 no i wont
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 19:19:14 i prefer turret first as you put more detail on the turret
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 19:19:19 and i plan my builds anyway
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 19:19:25 also thats from 2020
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 19:19:30 i dont have that tank anymore lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 19:19:59 i prefer the otherway around
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 19:20:15 mhm
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 19:20:30 turret is hardest part thats why i do it first
creations-chat 2023-01-24 06:59:50 the nose is my design that i did for mig29, i gave it to gent cause its a design that would look better on aircraft with larger nose cones like that and he just changed the angles to fit the aircraft.
creations-chat 2023-01-24 07:02:51 also that nose cone design wont look good on aircraft like f16, you gotta do it on thicker noses like f15 or tornado etc
creations-chat 2023-01-24 07:08:38 mhm, ima come up with a new nose design thats just as clean for aircraft with funny nose like euro or f16 etc
creations-chat 2023-01-24 07:15:05 why so mad??
creations-chat 2023-01-24 07:17:21 me <:nooo:787097964946259978> , im in a WT que for 4 min

Operation timed out <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:44:11 im a gymnast
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:44:32 its when you use motorlock for a build but the motors are showing outside your build
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:45:09 its not part of motorlock as you can avoid it
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:46:48 ngl i think its a problem most people have 😂
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:47:02 best way to avoid it would be towering
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:47:15 but it uses the a crap ton of motors
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:47:29 yea or build ships lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:47:38 tooti
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:47:52 hmmm
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:48:10 ok so dark has demotivated me to make carrier
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:48:22 because he has just made his hanger and its confirmed
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:48:29 my carrier can fit in his carrier hanger :((
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:48:39 so im sad
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:48:50 i mean i can argue im going for detail i guess
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:49:03 hmm
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:49:14 only if there good blueprint and 3d model
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:50:00 was so close to finishing up the basic details on the front before i went ham with the little details but oh well
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:51:05 ok i have now documented some pics incase i never spawn this again
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:56:30 <@527653676022628353>
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:56:38 give me ship names
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:57:22 lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:57:29 ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:57:32 all good
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:57:41 im just not very cultured in these types of ships
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:57:58 if i could get some names and i can find blueprints and 3d models my self
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:58:15 wooden naval ships
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:58:26 or what ever type that tooti wants me to make
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 19:58:47 what should be bigger?
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:01:39 see im slow
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:02:01 NAVAL SHIPS
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:02:52 naval and wooden
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:03:00 what ever one tooti is making
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:03:28 these types of ships
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:03:31 but not hms victory
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:06:54 omg it has alot of ropes
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:12:43 ima do a spanish 80 gun ship
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:12:57 
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:13:10 i have
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:13:21 but i dont like american ships
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:13:28 they are boring
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:13:43 European ships have style
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:14:24 rip
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:15:39 ima one up tooti and add detailed cannons
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:15:51 and add 80 of them 💀
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:16:45 idk
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:17:04 not much i dont think
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:18:30 ask tooti
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:18:37 he was the one who made both em
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:19:56 hang on ima do maths before i waste my time
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:20:15 its not much
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:20:23 running out of motors is easy
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:20:36 anyway i wont be able to add 80 detailed guns unless i want to run out
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:20:49 i need a smaller ship
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:20:55 or less guns
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:21:22 hmm, il make a cannon first then see how many motors it uses
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:43:43 got a basic idea of how to do cannon
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:44:42 i mean i guess this will do
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:44:46 its better than disconnectors lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:47:10 i can make a 6th rate ship with these
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:51:42 i need a ship with 20 guns
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:52:59 i was looking at 6th rate frigates as they are 20-28 guns
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:53:02 let me see
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:53:17 wdym how
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:53:22 why?
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:53:34 im good at small though
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:54:22 k
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:58:02 cam lock sucks and is a pain
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:58:09 you dont use maglock for angles lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:58:33 you dont xd
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:58:39 do you even mag lock xd
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:59:10 you use maglock so you can do funny details with no exposed lock or to make funny details have mechanical functions without a motorlock tower ebing in the way
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 20:59:56 thats so unnessisary
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:00:14 you use maglock for stuff like this
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:00:17 thats not how to use maglock
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:00:18 but oj
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:00:52 maglock doesnt make angles
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:01:14 and detailing in small areas isnt a problem for me anyway
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:01:33 or just use motor 2 lock which is much easier
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:01:39 im heading of to sleep
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:01:43 il start tomorrow
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:01:53 lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:02:28 ik how to angle lol, i am one of the best detailers in game lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:02:49 it welds blocks together so you can detatch motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:03:20 its not that simple
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:03:30 all blocks need to be connected or close to magnet
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:03:43 and you need to update the blocks infront of magnet to weld
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:04:28 move the blocks infront of magnet to weld
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:04:35 thats what makes it a pain
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:04:42 so the magnet cant be inside the build when you weld it
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:04:55 you weld sections of builds then motorlock the whole magnet with the blocks in
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:05:02 you can do something like this
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:05:19 this is before maglock
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:05:48 yea
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:06:00 its really only useful for rotated stuff or repeated patternes
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:06:04 so you can remove the tower
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:06:07 like this
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:06:15 whos build?
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:06:24 send pic
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:06:36 rafale nose actually lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:06:48 its 5 long trail nose
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:07:08 jomans build is perfect
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:07:32 motorlock tower detached lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 21:22:02 lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-26 07:30:15 its american
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 07:45:46 i think you will need to use a motor ngl
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 09:28:24 thats lazy
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 09:28:45 practice and building a lot
creations-chat 2023-01-27 09:36:07 did you make sure to angle the left cheek more than the right?
creations-chat 2023-01-27 09:38:53 you need to be level 3 or something
creations-chat 2023-01-27 09:40:57 you sure about that 😂 the cheeks angle less on the right side so the gunner can be closer to the front to operate the gun manually if the huydrolics fail,
creations-chat 2023-01-27 09:44:10 this is m1a1, the cheeks are not symmetrical, the m1a2 is just an m1a1 with more optics
creations-chat 2023-01-27 09:46:35 you mean your lazy
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 09:46:51 that does help as well
creations-chat 2023-01-27 09:48:37 its not a tiny detail, it’s pretty obvious and is one of the few things you need to add for a good turret. also it doesnt use any more motorlock than just doing it normally, you just change the angle. again, if you dont add this detail ur lazy or not good at motorlock
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 09:49:14 it also depends on the person
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 09:49:28 some people just cant improve in this game
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 09:49:32 its a harsh reality
creations-chat 2023-01-27 09:50:40 then why you making abrams if you dont like the abrams turret?
creations-chat 2023-01-27 09:52:45 wdym makes you die, you just change the angle. its really not that difficult and it wont cause your build to fail or anything, also does your barrel move?
creations-chat 2023-01-27 09:54:54 project flight is just studios with extra steps
creations-chat 2023-01-27 09:57:09 its not plane crazy, its a different game which you painfully place a block to make a triangle to delete the block and repeat. in a year or so it will be good hopefully but atm you can only make aircraft really

you cant detail much though, just get accurate airframes
creations-chat 2023-01-27 09:59:11 plane crazy is still better for detailing, but you build faster in project flight, also you can only choose like 20 different colours and they arent that good
creations-chat 2023-01-27 10:02:27 berry rafale which looks amazing geometry wise but it lacks details which can be done in plane crazy. although this does look amazing 😂
creations-chat 2023-01-27 10:05:12 project flight, the building process is the most repetitive thing ever but you can get cool geometry
creations-chat 2023-01-27 10:08:54 this may help for the hull
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 11:14:13 you could make it smaller and more detailed
creations-chat 2023-01-27 11:15:37 its not called plane crazy 2, its cheese game but ok

Its called **Project flightpoint**
creations-chat 2023-01-27 11:21:08 its project flightpoint
creations-chat 2023-01-27 11:23:18 it has a better wedge system yes, but is lacking in details and you can only make aircraft atm
creations-chat 2023-01-27 11:25:25 i doubt it will improve though, cheese already said he wont fix the flight physics and it’s much buggier than plane crazy. its still a rough game and PC2 will have a similar wedge system anyway
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:34:55 water prop
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:35:33 it is, or only a tiny bit larger
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:36:07 yea
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:36:42 water props are really nice for making barrels as well as you have many different sized cylinders
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:40:01 https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/low-poly-11-usaf-f22a-raptor-ea657ca469424ad68c4b9e013b993c46
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:40:16 here is a blueprint and a decent 3d model
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:40:59 you can use these to check your dimensions to make sure your aircraft has the correct wing span compared to your body or the right sweep or the nose is the correct thickness and length etc
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:41:42 roscale car is like 2-3 blocks depending on the car you make
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:41:53 tall ofc
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:42:33 blueprints are better to use, 3d model is just nice to add details but i recommend blueprint for geometry
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:43:28 whats the name of this car
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:43:39 i can get you its ingame dimensions for roscale
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:46:16 roscale is 7 blocks long, 2.5 or 3 blocks wide and 2 blocks tall
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:47:16 1 block is 0.7 meters so to get a roscale build you just get the size of the real thing in meters, then divide that value by 0.7 and thats how many blocks your build should be
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:48:16 its so basic though
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:50:12 one of the major reasons why most builds are proportionally wrong is because people are to lazy to choose a scale to build at and spend 2 min planning lengths ect to make sure your build doesnt turn out shit
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:50:19 why?
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:50:23 its on google
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:50:48 its like 1.8meters wide, 1.4 meters tall and i think it was 4.8 meters long
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:51:33 irl measurements are 4.8 meters long, 1.8 meters wide and 1.4 meters tall
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:51:59 roscale in blocks is 0.7 divided off those values
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:52:29 a block is 2.5 studs which both mad attack and rick said
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:52:48 1 stud is 0.28 meters given by roblox themselves
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:53:10 2.5 x 0.28 = 0.7 meters
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:53:17 meaning a block is 0.7 of a meter
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:53:33 this is roscale
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:54:28 i would say camlock for this scale as i have seen some really cool cam locked stuff but my expertise are in motorlock so i cant say much, do what you feel comfortable with
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:55:07 no
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:55:17 you do 25 meters divided by 0.7
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:55:53 you will always have more blocks than meters because block is less than a meter
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:56:27 something that is 25 meters will be 35.5 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:56:50 f16 which is 15 meters long would be 21.5 blocks long roscale
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:57:26 however some people dont like roscale because roscale assumes your character is 1.4 meters tall which is tiny
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:57:57 some people like to assume your character is the average height making one block roughly 0.9 of a meter instead of 0.7
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:58:06 that means your build will be smaller
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:58:23 which is more challenging for things like cars, tanks aircraft etc
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 13:58:38 yea
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:00:00 another nice scale is 1 block = 0.5 of a meter which is roughly 50% larger than irl scale which personally is best scale for small aircraft and tanks/cars
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:00:14 yes to some extent, or so i have heard
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:01:35 well i actually make something 2.7 or 3.1 blocks wide because i pistonlock but if you dont want to make something 2.7 blocks wide for example, you can round up to 3 wide and make it like half a block longer to still look proportionally correct
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:01:59 1 stud is 0.28 meters. thats the official value given by roblox
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:03:06 fun fact, game speed is studs pers second confirmed by rick and as we know the time and distance of a stud, 1 speed is 0.28 meters per second which is also 1.008kph so speed in game is basically in kph
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:03:30 make it 24.5 blocks long
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:04:05 nah, its in studs per second but that also basically the same as kph
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:04:28 mhm, you dont need to pistolock for halfblock
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:04:50 rip
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:05:18 i havent seen many mechs for a while
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:05:37 i remember a few years ago there was a massive mech hype
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:05:58 i still got some builds from 2019 in my saves lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:08:23 this is ma f16 from 2019 lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:08:30 nearly 4 years lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:09:42 its all about scale
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:10:46 so 0.7 is roscale, 0.9 is player scale 1 is mini scale, 0.5 is bigger than roscale but not massive scale, then anything under 0.5 is just large scale
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:11:08 you choose your scale
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:11:50 so lets say you want yo make an f18 thats 20 blocks long instead of 24.5, you know the length of it irl so you can then work out the scaler
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:12:09 you then use that scaler value to work out how many blocks your wingspan should be etc
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:12:19 it helps keep your build proportionally correct
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:13:22 using that example, a 20 block long f18 has scaler of 0.855 instead of 0.7
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:13:42 so to work out its wingspan, do the wingspan in meters divided by 0.855
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:14:06 this is very close to playerscale which is around 0.85-0.9 scaler
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:14:11 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:14:20 scale is what you want it to be
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:14:47 so you dont have to make everything 0.7 which is roscale
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:15:04 most of my stuff are around 0.5-0.7 scale
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:15:19 but sometimes i do larger, sometimes i do smaller
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:16:15 the bigger your scaler number, the smaller your build, so a scaler of 1 meaning 1 block is 1 meter is smaller than scaler 0.5 which is 1 block is half a meter or 2 blocks are a meter making your build twice the size
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:17:35 if you do this, your aircraft width, height, wingspan, where the intakes start, how long the canopy is, where the landing gear are, everything will be proportionally correct to your aircraft length if you use a scale instead of eyeballing
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:18:19 and its very simple and easy to do snd doesnt take any time at all
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:18:42 you can write the values down on a peice of paper or save it online somewhere
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:19:09 and at least you now dont have to worry about if your aircraft has the correct shape for its size
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:20:29 also if you end up with values like 2.7, although 2.5 would be the correct way to round, 3 would be both easier to build and thicker looks better than skinny in this game anyway
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:21:06 and for ships, if you get an even number for the width or something, you can just round it up or down a whole block to be odd which is easier to work with
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:21:41 small changes to dimensions are fine but doing this will keep your build relatively correct compared to someone who just eyeballs it
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:22:40 i mean if you go into creations, most of the stuff sent look of a bit and thats because the wingspan is to long or to short or the wings are to forward or back or the canopy is not long enough etc
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:23:39 also people who make tanks for some reason make them super thin and long which wouldnt happen if you did this
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:24:33 bros getting ptsd 😂
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:25:19 rip
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:26:32 why not do an overlay instead?
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:27:46 not really, alot of the good builds dont check proptions but makes up with detail so to majority in pictures they look amazing, when you see them in game its triggering when a highly detailed build has its wings like 2 blocks to back
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:28:07 cough cough boxness
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:28:36 its a hunchback
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:28:55 so the spine doesnt angle down with the canopy unless you do the UB variant
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:30:07 also don’t forget the funny ir camera that all flankers have
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:30:26 magic
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:30:52 you can get a shader thing which removes perspective
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:31:08 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:31:34 idk i dont have it, i use dark to take the screenshots for me and blueprint overlay for me lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:31:41 all ik is that its a thing
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:32:43 there isnt anyway to teach how to build
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:32:58 you learn them overtime
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:33:03 and practicing
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:33:45 also “stealing” other people’s methods is a lazy way to improve
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:34:35 that mig29 nose isnt seen all the time
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:34:59 there are only 3 other builds in this game that have similar design to that mig29
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:35:23 and that’s because they use my nose design which is on that mig29
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:36:19 seeing what others have done
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:36:42 then if one that looks really good works for your aircraft use that
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:37:00 if there aren’t any good designs, mix some together
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:37:39 for that mig29 nose i call it jet engine nose which is made the same as your standard wedged nose but uses jet engine for the corners instead of half wedge making it clean
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:38:15 and that was a design i thought of by first using cylinders because i have seen some cylinder builds thay look good like SR phantom
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:38:35 and then wanted to reduce the motorlock and realised i could use jet engine
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:38:52 this is kinda the process of making “your own” design
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:39:12 nice drawing
creations-chat 2023-01-27 14:39:35 lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:39:47 oh they are bitches to do
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:40:13 from what i have seen, angling half cylinders and half balls seem to be the best design
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:40:44 building 50% larger than roscale isnt massive but allows for indepth builds
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:41:21 roscale f16 is 21.5 blocks long but 0.5 scale makes it 30 blocks long
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:41:33 3 wide is larger scale
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:41:41 roscale is around 2 wide
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:41:53 oh lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:42:01 do 4 wide
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:42:19 4 wide isnt massive but it’s enough to do fancy stuff
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:42:42 5 wide heli isnt bad either
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:42:56 also im pretty sure 3 wide heli is mini scale
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:43:42 roscale chinook is 5.5 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:44:18 chinook is 3.78 meters wide so divide 0.7 and you get 5.4 so chinook is roughly 5.5 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:44:52 roscale stallion is 7.5 blocks wide god damn
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:45:19 its 5.3 meters wide
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:45:34 you are talking about player scale
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:45:47 roscale is larger than player scale
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:46:07 player scale is about 0.9 and roscale is 0.7
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:46:08 of a meter
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:46:18 yea but roscale makes your character 1.4 meters tall
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:46:35 player scale is assuming your character is 1.8 meters tall
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:46:46 its 1.4 meters tall
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:46:55 no they are
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:47:05 but some people prefer to be taller
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:47:08 ik
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:47:29 but playerscale is building at a scale that makes your build look correct for the average adult
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:47:35 i didn’t
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:47:37 its a thing
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:47:50 i use roscale cause you can built larger
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:47:53 its not dumb
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:47:58 ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:47:59 sr
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:48:13 you know how cars are shorter than people normally
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:48:25 in Uk is 1.8 meters
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:48:50 player scale is roughly 0.8-0.9 of a meter
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:49:26 player scale is just a name for the scale in which you assume your characters height, then base the size of your build to that height
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:49:38 roscale is only roscale
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:50:16 if you are 1.8 metres tall, then 1 block is 0.9
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:50:31 no, it assumes any height you choose
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:50:46 its 1.4 meters tall
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:51:11 roblox character is 4 feet 7 inches
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:51:18 no
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:51:24 why you assume that
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:51:38 im just saying 4feet 7 inches is tiny
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:52:06 some people want their characters to have average height
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:52:26 also you wont have a 4feet 7 inch person flying an aircraft
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:52:38 5,6 is world average
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:52:46 5,8 is europe
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:53:05 im 5,10 or something
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:53:14 average in UK is 5,11
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:53:20 im short in uk
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:53:40 its british genes lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:54:02 my height isnt the only thing thats long 😏
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:54:50 ik, but the other half dwarf me and its common knowledge to know that in college, average college student height is 2 feet taller than average so half the people are over 6,1 in ma college
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:55:06 yea
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:56:27 anyway point is roscale stallion is 7.5 blocks wide which is fat but if you look at images of people next to stallion, it should be 6 blocks wide instead, thats why some people prefer to do “player scale”
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:56:41 ma god
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:57:37 roscale f14 is 27 blocks long
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:57:43 yooo
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:57:50 the failed f22
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:58:03 the worst f22
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:58:59 f22 was more manuoverable, had a larger weapons bay, was more multorole even though its an air superiority fighter, easier to fly and more advanced avionics, thrust vectoring which looked cool
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:59:08 no f22 had more
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:59:14 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:59:17 f22 had more
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:59:46 yf23 only was faster super cruise, higher flying by a tiny bit and a little more stealth
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 14:59:53 f22 beat it in every thing else
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:00:07 keyword
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:00:10 could have
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:00:12 it didnt
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:00:17 and it would have cost to much
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:00:29 the f22 was the better aircraft
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:00:54 and f22 had better radar and situation awareness
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:01:16 top speed and max height dont really matter
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:01:24 and it was only slighlt more stealth
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:01:34 but the f22 was still stealth enough
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:02:15 agile was very important
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:02:35 they liked russias super manoeuvrebility and wanted their own
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:03:05 the yf23 was a good aircraft, it just wasn’t what the specifications said apart from stealth and supercruise
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:03:21 the f22 was what america wanted thats why it won
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:03:26 price is also part of that
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:03:43 what the point in making the best thing ever if it cost to much to make
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:03:57 they are declassified
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:04:09 no
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:05:41 the f22 after a decade of development became the same price as uncomplete yf23
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:05:43 if they chose yf23 it would have been even more, bugets always increa
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:06:00 f22 looks better
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:06:11 yf23 looks shit in my opinion
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:06:19 f15 looks cool
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:06:31 still stealth enough
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:06:49 mhm
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:07:02 only a little better
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:07:10 it wouldnt make a difference though
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:07:31 seen the f16
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:08:06 black bird is just a flying fuel tank with 2 turboram jet engines and a pilot strapped on
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:08:49 they saw potential in it so made it f18
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:09:00 they didnt see potential in yf23 so never did anything
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:09:46 lol all the f16x needed was another engine
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:09:59 to best strike eagle
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:10:22 ima head home now, il be back maybe
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:10:35 wait
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:10:38 before i go
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:11:15 f35 can multirole
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 15:11:29 also can VTOL
plane-crazy 2023-01-27 17:08:28 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:10:37 a normal day in PC
plane-crazy 2023-02-02 16:11:23 i was going to say 122 cause barrel is THICC
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 11:54:58 someone make this, MiG-105, the wings fold as well and there are plenty of images in different angles
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 12:11:24 angle them
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 12:12:19 rafale is a copy of eurofighter <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 12:14:39 some days i think the rafale looks cool, most days im like wtf
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 12:15:05 twin seater looks better ngl
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 12:20:52 you just use a motor to angle then motorlock it in
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 12:21:24 you can do it in 4 motors in its most basic form
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 12:24:36 better
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 12:25:18 mhm
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 12:25:47 just motorlock tower it in
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 12:25:57 or something
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 12:26:57 you would be unable to function properly with that amount of sleep for extended periods of time
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 12:27:24 you can get away with it if you do that on week day and sleep 10 hours or something on the weekend
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 12:27:39 but you will feel like shit
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 12:29:18 **Getting only six hours of sleep each night is considered a poor sleep schedule that can result in sleep deprivation and lead to poor mental health and potential sleep disorders. You can survive on six hours of sleep but that would not be good for your long-term health.**
plane-crazy 2023-02-06 12:29:28 copy pasta lel
creations-chat 2023-02-12 07:48:37 ?
creations-chat 2023-02-12 10:09:44 just copy of the images
creations-chat 2023-02-19 17:17:25 what
creations-chat 2023-02-19 17:19:31 its a euro with rights unlike most other countries
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 15:25:29 lol proportions is the one thing you cant fuck up, idc about detail, thats determined by your skill level, mainly in motorlock, but looking at an image and getting the right dimensions is something a 5 year old could do, yet many people still fuck it up
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 15:26:29 xd
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 15:26:32 mhm
