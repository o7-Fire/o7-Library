general 2022-10-10 02:29:56 hey guys
general 2022-10-10 02:30:08 i made and googled a list of why we should hate the french
general 2022-10-10 02:30:27 1. Thierry Henry.
2. The Normans.
3. Irregular verbs.
4. You spend years learning their language, then you go to Paris to practice it and they talk back to you in English.
5. Nice food. Lovely wine. But they still can't make a decent cup of tea.
6. The 2012 frozen pitch.
7. The ugliness of Parisian hotel wallpaper as a contributing factor in the death of Wilde.
8. The French paradox. They eat lots of fatty foods but don't get heart disease. It's not fair.
9. The rudeness of Parisians.
10. They even have a street called Rue Rude and the Irish Embassy is on it.
general 2022-10-10 02:30:52 some of these are from irish artical
general 2022-10-10 02:31:08 shall i continue why we should hate the french

creations-chat 2022-12-28 03:17:04 I feel that the PC community needs to see something exceptionally good to be able to have a positive opinion on any build

unlike the minecraft community that can appreciate the decent builds and still enjoy the really good builds

either shit or if its good since you are a white name its a tutorial build 💀

plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:35:42 it scares me
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:35:49 but nobody can fly them properly
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:35:51 so its fine
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:36:25 i have an omnidirectional hovercraft
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:36:30 it hovers perfectly
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:36:36 even with 180 gravity
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:36:48 and it doesn't drift
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:36:52 at all
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:37:06 it got around 50 speed i think
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:37:08 ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:37:11 ill send pic
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:38:22 
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:38:37 it can fly in every direction
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:38:40 completely stable
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:38:47 and no drifting
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:38:52 and it hovers perfectly
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:38:59 even with normal gravity
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:39:08 no
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:39:15 i just use it for recording
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:39:23 battles between my friends
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:40:27 i put helium on it, and all those rectangles that make up the shape of the fly thingie are wing panels
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:40:41 the wing panels are responsible for making it not drift
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:41:56 
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:42:40 no anchor blocks
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:42:55 anchor blocks are for noobs
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:43:01 😎
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:43:57 i never been successfully attacked by a shredder ball
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:44:08 when i see people load them they can never fly them properly
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:44:13 and only fly them into the ground
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:46:35 good idea
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:46:51 only problem is i need tons of wings to make it that stable
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:47:04 and it ends up looking like an angel from evangelion
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:47:53 and because all those wings are creating incredibly strong drag it requires an extreme ton of rockets
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:48:55 i literally used 108 super rockets on that for only 51 speed
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:49:46 72 1x4 wing panels and 48 1x2 wing panels
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:49:51 to make it that stable
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:50:39 so ill have to make a whole new design for eye of cthulu
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:51:22 anyway wanna see another cool build im working on
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:56:45 its like a bipedal car
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:56:50 so it only has 2 wheels
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 08:57:33 
creations-chat 2023-01-04 08:58:52 OBS
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 09:00:16 i realized that if the wheels spinned using motors it would probably only spin the chassis
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 09:00:26 so i just put a lot of rockets in the wheels
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 09:01:29 bro really actin like a twitter user looking at shit 4 years ago

plane-crazy 2023-01-04 09:05:43 lol
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 09:06:19 the wheels are so big i cant even build the car upright

plane-crazy 2023-01-04 12:46:03 i do not know the name of the parts of a plane...
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 12:46:30 ah the cockpit or the glass part?
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 12:47:00 ok how am i supposed to know
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 12:48:05 make them smaller
creations-chat 2023-01-04 12:50:11 ok
the main reason its so slow is also the reason its so stable; just the sheer amount of wings gives the hovercraft tons of drag
i used 108 super rockets and it's max speed per direction is 51
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 12:53:28 looks like thunder thighs cyborg from teen titans go
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 12:53:52 
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 12:54:24 i wanna build a mech based of a Metal Gear Ray
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 12:54:45 because Metal Gear Rex looks very blocky
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 12:55:13 fast to make or fast walking speed or flight speed?
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 12:56:05 so stable and fast hovering?
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 12:57:10 i would recommend utilizing wing panels along with a slightly tilted engine
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 12:57:22 i would use giant rocket since that would look cool
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 12:58:07 use camera locking or motor locking with a motor 2 to tilt it
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 12:58:54 cutter is the only thing that cuts in plane crazy. if you want something else that will cut you will have to wait for pc2 (pc2 also has a saw)
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 13:00:02 you know how when you click cameras with the 3rd tool instead of showing you the usual menu immediately, it shows settings and *reselect*?
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 13:00:11 go experiment with reselect
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 13:00:31 well there is also explosives but those are 1 time use
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 13:00:36 wait what
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 13:01:06 ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 13:01:17 i got a little confused

plane-crazy 2023-01-04 13:03:40 whats the point
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 13:04:45 question: why not fold ***normally***
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 13:05:48 i use a folding design without cameras
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 13:05:53 and its like 3x2
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 13:06:04 no need for 10 block long chain of cameras
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 13:07:29 @everyone why do you waste 20 blocks of your plot to camera fold instead of just folding normally with half blocks in a 3x2x2 space?
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 13:07:42 bruh @everyone ping not look @everyone

help 2023-01-07 15:19:58 that's just how motors work. technically motor locking halving the length of the motor is a glitch, fixed by using the motor. the original intention to what motor locking is supposed to do, is not move around when not being used.

plane-crazy 2023-01-30 12:54:12 the design is based off of the Master Cycle Zero
plane-crazy 2023-01-30 12:54:22 from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
plane-crazy 2023-01-30 12:54:47 and in my observations of the bike it is pretty much an ancient unicorn bike

creations-chat 2023-02-26 02:06:34 could you explain that design to me please
general 2023-02-26 02:20:36 will rick make actual aerofoil for pc2 as wings or will he just use the same wind drag panels for wings in pc2
general 2023-02-26 02:27:14 ok
general 2023-02-26 02:27:16 but
general 2023-02-26 02:27:22 will it have aerofoil you think
general 2023-02-26 02:27:28 that creates upward thrust
general 2023-02-26 02:29:01 in real life, aerofoil creates upward thrust by using curvature to create low pressure air above the wing, but high pressure air below the wing
general 2023-02-26 02:29:34 thus causing the air to push the wings up
general 2023-02-26 02:29:41 bruh

general 2023-03-23 11:40:41 if i had to choose
general 2023-03-23 11:40:53 i would either go with marine engineering or mechanical engineering
general 2023-03-23 11:40:59 yes
general 2023-03-23 11:41:33 btw
general 2023-03-23 11:41:43 since our schools our so similar

general 2023-03-23 11:42:00 ok
general 2023-03-23 11:42:03 so thats a no
general 2023-03-23 11:42:20 nwea is just some website that does it

general 2023-03-24 00:48:30 shut up white name
general 2023-03-24 00:49:30 anyway guys does this paragraph look good
general 2023-03-24 00:49:34 In Born a Crime, religion plays a big role in Trevor Noah’s life. It is explained that in South Africa, there is a traditional religion and there is Christianity. Both of these religions have sort of mixed together a bit in South Africa. Trevor Noah uses interesting diction to explain why this is. “My mother was—and still is—a deeply religious woman. Very christian. Like indigenous peoples around the world, black South Africans adopted the religion of our colonizers. By “adopt.” I mean it was forced upon us” (Noah 5). This theme of Christianity being forced upon Trevor Noah’s life is also apparent where others force him to pray. “I was terrified. I believed in the power of prayer. So if I prayed to God to kill the thing that left the turd, and the thing that left the turd was me, then God was going to kill me. I froze. I didn’t know what to do. But all the grannies were looking at me, so I prayed, stumbling through as best I could” (Noah 48). Trevor Noah uses humor to explain this situation so that the audience can better understand, while getting a laugh out of it. The reason why Christianity is a religion in South Africa is because Dutch Colonisers in the 1600s brought it to them. These quotes make it apparent that religion is an important part of Trevor Noah’s life, and how he uses literary devices to show how the historical context affects South Africa today.
general 2023-03-24 00:49:34 its about religion
general 2023-03-24 00:50:02 bye
general 2023-03-24 00:50:16 i have 35 mins left lol
general 2023-03-24 00:51:42 i just had a genius idea for my essay
general 2023-03-24 00:51:50 ill make one paragraph about criminality
general 2023-03-24 00:51:56 because the book is literally called
general 2023-03-24 00:52:00 Born a Crime
general 2023-03-24 00:52:08 it will be the best and the easiest paragraph
general 2023-03-24 00:52:19 tell me
general 2023-03-24 00:53:15 offensive word starting with n im in middle school the main thing im writing about is the historical contexts and stuff and
general 2023-03-24 00:53:20 trevor noah born a crime
general 2023-03-24 00:53:39 fair enough
general 2023-03-24 00:53:53 ill try my best to follor your advice anyway
general 2023-03-24 00:54:10 smart idea
general 2023-03-24 00:56:43 yo
general 2023-03-24 00:56:52 better idea than connecting crime and religion
general 2023-03-24 00:56:56 connecting crime and racism
general 2023-03-24 00:57:08 because thats the reason trevor noah was born a crime
general 2023-03-24 00:57:22 and i got a good quote that connects to both
general 2023-03-24 00:58:14 ong
general 2023-03-24 00:58:39 anyway though that was not the point i was tryna make
general 2023-03-24 01:00:17 no
general 2023-03-24 01:00:26 fuck only 25 mins left
general 2023-03-24 01:00:57 anyway is this a good paragraph for criminality
general 2023-03-24 01:00:58 To readers of Born a Crime, it is clear that criminality played a major role in Trevor Noah’s life. One of the most immediately obvious way this is shown is during Trevor Noah’s experience stealing alcohol-filled chocolates at the mall. Trevor Noah describes a scene with heavy imagery when confronted by a mall cop upon attempting to steal chocolate. “And at that exact moment a mall cop came around the corner and saw me with my arm in up to my shoulder. I brought my hand out with a bunch of chocolates in it. It was almost like a movie” (Noah 147). General mischief is not the only way that Trevor Noah’s life is related to criminality though, as there is an even more direct relationship between his life and crime. "Where most children are proof of their parents' love, I was proof of their criminality" (Noah 28). This shows, using compare and contrast, how even just Trevor Noah’s existence is illegal. The reason behind this is that South Africa’s racist regime, Apartheid has made it a crime to have an interracial relationship, and even more illegal to have an interracial child. Trevor Noah is mixed, born of a Swiss father and a Xhosa mother.
general 2023-03-24 01:01:17 i purposefully made the end not completely wrap up because the next paragraph connects to this one
general 2023-03-24 01:01:48 the next paragraph is gonna be about racism
general 2023-03-24 01:01:50 and apartheid
general 2023-03-24 01:02:55 actually i am adding this last sentence at the end
general 2023-03-24 01:02:56 Racism in South Africa has made Trevor Noah’s birth a crime.
general 2023-03-24 01:03:19 to half wrap up while making a good connection to racism for the next paragraph
general 2023-03-24 01:03:41 anyway do i need to improve the paragraph much or nah?
general 2023-03-24 01:04:17 nah my school uses turnitin
general 2023-03-24 01:04:24 it will detect AI apparently
general 2023-03-24 01:04:42 and i only have 20 mins i cant make a chat GPT account
general 2023-03-24 01:05:00 also my class is small and my teacher knows my writing style
general 2023-03-24 01:05:17 hmm
general 2023-03-24 01:05:26 still i dont wanna risk it
general 2023-03-24 01:06:06 turnitin has better grammar checks lol
general 2023-03-24 01:06:17 ill just use turnitin grammar check
general 2023-03-24 01:06:52 yeah but it detects every grammatical error
general 2023-03-24 01:07:00 it tries to make your shit look ai generated
general 2023-03-24 01:07:03 WAIT
general 2023-03-24 01:07:19 💡
general 2023-03-24 01:21:46 ok guys i could not use chatGPT

general 2023-03-24 01:23:22 minimum was 500 words
general 2023-03-24 01:23:34 and the teacher wanted it to be around 750 words
general 2023-03-24 01:23:43 because he didn't want to read a multi page essay

general 2023-07-14 10:39:01 in all honesty though that is one of my few criticisms on japanese culture
general 2023-07-14 10:39:08 work culture is too intense
general 2023-07-14 10:39:14 same with all of the respect bullshit
general 2023-07-14 10:39:52 so to get some bullshit about japan out of the way
general 2023-07-14 10:40:01 japanese food is really good
general 2023-07-14 10:40:23 but as soon as we make food from other cultures we are dogshit at it
general 2023-07-14 10:40:32 pasta sauce here is over sweetened
general 2023-07-14 10:40:45 curry here yall would call sweet curry
general 2023-07-14 10:40:51 tastes like shit
general 2023-07-14 10:41:05 ours isnt
general 2023-07-14 10:41:51 one time i had "mexican food" here and i didnt need to urgently take a shit after
general 2023-07-14 10:41:55 no toilets were harmed
general 2023-07-14 10:42:00 not exactly
general 2023-07-14 10:42:31 shit that is just right in sweetness from other cultures is over sweetened
general 2023-07-14 10:42:44 some shit is also under sweetened
general 2023-07-14 10:42:55 and anything spicy is no longer spicy
general 2023-07-14 10:43:05 also
general 2023-07-14 10:43:17 there is none of that good american candy in japan
general 2023-07-14 10:43:33 like reeses cups are my favourite candy ngl
general 2023-07-14 10:43:38 but they dont have them here
general 2023-07-14 10:43:52 the only doritos i like are the cool ranch ones
general 2023-07-14 10:44:04 and thats the only big doritos flavor they dont have
general 2023-07-14 10:44:09 cheetos is shit here
general 2023-07-14 10:44:31 you cant even have normal flaming hot cheetos instead there is the cheesy version of flaming hot
general 2023-07-14 10:44:57 i also really like the kinder surprise eggs but only time i saw those was outside japan
general 2023-07-14 10:45:09 (one time i went on a vacation to canada)
general 2023-07-14 10:45:29 L america
general 2023-07-14 10:45:49 also
general 2023-07-14 10:46:00 cereal here is boring asf
general 2023-07-14 10:46:10 the most interesting cereal here is like
general 2023-07-14 10:46:13 frosted flakes
general 2023-07-14 10:46:19 chocolate flakes if you are lucky
general 2023-07-14 10:46:35 and like some goofy hershey cereal that barely tastes like chocolate
general 2023-07-14 10:47:28 one time my dad got lucky charms and it instantly became my second favorite cereal
general 2023-07-14 10:47:52 (one time my american friend at school brought cinammon toast crunch)
general 2023-07-14 10:48:15 so in terms of the culinary arts
general 2023-07-14 10:48:27 japan is shit at other cultural foods and candy and cereal
general 2023-07-14 10:48:41 but japanese food is the shit here
general 2023-07-14 10:48:44 its really good
general 2023-07-14 10:48:59 i can get like 3 meals of udon here
general 2023-07-14 10:49:06 for 165¥
general 2023-07-14 10:49:13 which is around $1
general 2023-07-14 10:49:27 and it actually tastes really good
general 2023-07-14 10:50:00 its like
general 2023-07-14 10:50:04 ramen
general 2023-07-14 10:50:08 but with thicker noodles
general 2023-07-14 10:50:15 and uses a different type of broth
general 2023-07-14 10:50:37 normally ramen broth is salty
general 2023-07-14 10:50:44 but udon has a different sort of
general 2023-07-14 10:50:48 idk how to describe
general 2023-07-14 10:50:51 flavor
general 2023-07-14 10:50:56 like
general 2023-07-14 10:50:59 more tangy
general 2023-07-14 10:51:04 and less salty
general 2023-07-14 10:51:20 basically
general 2023-07-14 10:51:34 there is also kishimen which i really like
general 2023-07-14 10:51:42 its like if you combined ramen and udon
general 2023-07-14 10:51:54 the noodles are wide but thin
general 2023-07-14 10:52:14 yeah
general 2023-07-14 10:52:34 also
general 2023-07-14 10:52:40 the rice here on its own
general 2023-07-14 10:52:45 is sort of bland
general 2023-07-14 10:52:55 but they have really good seasonings
general 2023-07-14 10:52:58 for rice
general 2023-07-14 10:53:03 yeah
general 2023-07-14 10:54:25 in japan the rice seasoning here is called "furikake" which just means you add it by shakiing it
general 2023-07-14 10:54:37 sounds stupid in english
general 2023-07-14 10:54:54 but my favorite type of rice seasoning is called yukari
general 2023-07-14 10:54:58 some type of leaf idk
general 2023-07-14 10:55:10 but its powderised and dried
general 2023-07-14 10:55:17 to make a 10/10 seasoning
general 2023-07-14 10:56:38 tf is a schnitzel
