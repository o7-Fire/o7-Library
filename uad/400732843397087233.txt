bug-reports 2020-01-09 22:16:04 I picked up the SparklePop but no matter what, I can't find it anywhere, people told me it was here but it isn't. I can't re-pick it up either since I got the message "You got SparklePop" before

bug-reports 2020-01-10 15:57:39 The SparklePop Hasn't entered my inventory, It's been a week.
bug-reports 2020-01-10 15:58:06 Even though I picked it up
bug-reports 2020-01-10 15:58:30 <@!510867573257273354> I think that's a problem with your computer

bug-reports 2020-01-12 18:33:57 Sometimes you slowly fall when on the Jetpack, sometimes you slowly go up, sometimes you stay in the same place. Sometimes you can't even equip it too.

general 2021-04-12 19:25:27 Oh, okay cool
creations-chat 2021-04-12 21:38:27 Can I ask why you downvoted? I appreciate feedback rather than just trolls downvoting everything they see.

general 2021-04-13 14:41:02 Wass that
general 2021-04-13 16:38:21 Quick question, and please don't get Toxic on me again: Is there a way you can move a single piece of the build without moving the entire thing?
general 2021-04-13 16:38:39 Like a leg of a robot that needs to be 2 blocks back
general 2021-04-13 16:38:52 Oh, okay that's fine, thank you codename
general 2021-04-13 16:39:15 I'll just remake the leg 2 blocks back ü§∑
general 2021-04-13 16:40:04 Oh no it's just a specific leg that needs to be moved away from the robots body by 2 blocks
general 2021-04-13 16:40:09 All good, I'll just remake the leg
general 2021-04-13 16:40:50 I cannot.
general 2021-04-13 16:40:56 Nice rocket
general 2021-04-13 16:41:29 Jesus how do you even make a rocket that tall on such a small plot? Is there a gamepass for bigger plots or something?
general 2021-04-13 16:41:46 I see, ok
general 2021-04-13 16:42:08 So one accout has one half and another account has another? that's interesting
general 2021-04-13 16:42:15 how would it attach? LOL
general 2021-04-13 16:42:23 Attacher...Like detacher but it connects
general 2021-04-13 16:43:08 Wait, the question I was wondering was how he gets a rocket that big. You said folding which I gues makes sense
general 2021-04-13 16:43:29 Foldin'
general 2021-04-13 16:43:57 I coulda used folding on one of my planes, wish I knew sooner. Thanks yall
general 2021-04-13 16:44:13 ^
general 2021-04-13 19:48:26 Hey real quick can someone tell me anything to build...Literally anything I'm bored as heck
general 2021-04-13 19:48:39 UK's anti-gun law?
general 2021-04-13 19:48:48 Sorry, already done. Lol
general 2021-04-13 19:48:59 Yes, ranges. Not CCW
general 2021-04-13 19:49:03 You can have a hunting rifle.
general 2021-04-13 19:49:07 No CCW.
general 2021-04-13 19:49:39 Alrighty, name anything. Like big tank or big plane or submarine LOL
general 2021-04-13 19:50:41 You can, however, don't have to have firearms for self defence in the UK. You can use Crossbows, Bows, Swords, Knives, etc.
general 2021-04-13 19:51:12 You can't have a crossbow in the uk? that sucks
general 2021-04-13 19:51:43 I figured you could..That's why I said you could. Someone said "you can't but ok"
general 2021-04-13 19:51:54 Of course, you can't. LOL
general 2021-04-13 19:53:26 I may be wrong. According to a government official site in the UK, you can't actually own Crossbows for hunting...That might also be for having around the house/carrying but I'm not sure
bug-reports 2021-05-12 03:01:16 Problem. When 3 or more motors are attached to eachother. It becomes a limp elephant trunk  (motor 2's). How do I fix this? Yes, the strength of the motors is all the way up
bug-reports 2021-05-12 03:01:22 Yet when I remove ONE motor. Everything is fixed.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 03:01:27 These are motor 2's
bug-reports 2021-05-12 03:02:54 Oh, I mean't
bug-reports 2021-05-12 03:03:11 When  TWO motor 2's are attached. Then a regular motor on top makes them limp
bug-reports 2021-05-12 03:05:09 And I think it's funny that rickje's old bio said "motors aren't  glitched" xD
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 18:20:45 I made a tank üëç
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 18:20:56 fish
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 18:21:11 WAIT NO NO 

*among us WOOOOMPPP tick tick tick...tick*
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 18:21:39 But the cool part is that it has actual treads
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 18:21:55 Juxtaposed from just wheels
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 18:22:52 I tried to add rotating barrels to the top of the guns...but if you add a motor holding onto another motor holding on to a third motor with a heavy build, the entire gun turns into a limp elephant trunk
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 18:23:18 but the moment you remove the third motor and replace it with a regular block, it's like nothing ever happened.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:26:49 Here I'll explain in more detail now that I have more time. (i appreciate the help btw)

I have a BIIIG tank, and ontop of the tank shell is two BIIIIIG guns. However, the 2 guns are attached onto one platform using a motor 2. So the 2 big guns don't move independently, secondly, each big gun has it's own motor 2 to aim them (independently). That right there is 3 motor 2's. However, that itself works perfectly fine. But the very moment I put any kind of motor PAST the second set of motor 2's...it goes haywire. Even if I only put one motor of any kind (1 or 2), that single gun goes limp, yet the other one without the extra motor is stiff as a- leg. Confusing I know.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:27:34 Okay
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:27:48 That's fine. I was simply explaining in more detail
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:28:11 Alrighty then
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:28:38 I'm on my Chromebook right now, otherwise I would just send a screenshot of the tank
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:29:49 I was just explaining why I couldn't send a screenshot.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:29:59 No, not google play enabled.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:30:03 Or linux enabled)
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:30:24 One of the first models of chromebook, yes.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:30:48 Pshhh. I dunno dude. Tricky question.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:30:58 I would just send a screenshot of the tank if it was gp enabled
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:31:10 God no.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:31:13 Good god no
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:31:22 Barely even YouTube at 1920x1080
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:31:36 The Bluetooth feature just blew out
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:31:40 Yep.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:31:55 Yep, 1gb of ram

bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:32:38 I have an entire windows computer upstairs.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:32:40 No no.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:33:00 I have another computer, I'm simply doing chrome work right now. The windows machine is in use
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:33:24 Lol oh god no roblox on this fossil?
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:33:47 oh and I do have another bug
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:33:50 It's much easier to explain
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:34:22 So I have this V-Tol that works actually really great.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:34:46 I have 4 motor 2's sticking out from a single block that turn a helicopter wing panel exactly 30 degrees
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:35:02 and I have a second regular motor spinning at max speed and strength
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:35:09 However
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:35:47 Once I make the panels turn 30 degrees, they go all the way to the 30 degrees. But when I turn on the SPEED, they lose that 30 and go down to like...10 or 15
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:35:55 Once the speed goes off, it goes back up to 30.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:36:15 The thing is, this Vtol worked perfectly last week, and I load it up yesterday and it's completely useless.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:36:39 and what do you know? there are more than 3 motors
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:37:05 But.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:37:26 It looks a LOT like wind resistance...and it just worked last week. There wasn't some motor overhaul for wind resistance?
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:38:37 I actually have footage of it completely working, then not working.
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:38:49 and yes, I have the footage on me...Do you want to take a look?
bug-reports 2021-05-12 18:38:59 You do not have to if you don't want to
help 2021-05-12 18:42:32 Is that a gun or an entire ship?
help 2021-05-12 18:43:03 Looks like something out of half life alyx...You could make the entire side panel and just attach it using the traditional motor lock method?
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 20:40:35 Hear me out....A mixer gamepass for speakers to avoid copyright-avoided music...likes sped up music or low/high pitch songs
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 20:41:19 But it only has pitch
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 20:41:26 What about speed, echo, reverb, etc
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 20:41:40 My point is: More. Lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 20:41:42 It's just an idea
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 20:42:01 And, they could make a couple R$ off of it
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 20:42:08 <:ElonHMM:715614569430515783>
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 20:42:37 Oh, but
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 20:42:43 I get this idea from Robloxs: parkour
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 20:42:54 They did the same thing, with 2 gamepasses. Speaker and Mixer
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 20:43:34 bruv
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 20:43:43 Just an idea, since I making a concert
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 20:44:01 I found the song psychosocial, but they sped it up and raised the pitch...Which just gives me the idea
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 20:44:02 Just a thought
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 20:44:27 "Anti-Anti-Copyright"
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 20:44:29 lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 01:04:42 Hear me out....Reconnectors
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 01:05:15 It's an extra list called "connectors" Featuring disconnectors and connectors. Or replacing disconnector with "connector" and allowing it to disconnect or reconnect (white boxes)
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 01:05:30 ü§î
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 01:06:23 So,  let's say my rocket can re-land (it can) and I want it to reattach to the dock. I click a button when within a certain amount of blocks with it  (0.1 - 5 or something)
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 01:06:36 It then reconnects
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 01:06:53 Well, it wouldn't be  strong enough.
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 01:07:00 and it would only hold that one spot
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 01:07:33 I suppose if I use another magnet on the bottom it could work, but reconnect would have a bunch of cool features.
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 01:07:58 Like the idea of a motor being able to be controlled with your mouse was soooo cool and weird...yet here are thousands of builds using it for totally different things
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 01:08:03 Just a thought
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 22:09:09 okay, hear me out. Delayed funtions. You set anything can that can be controlled using keybinds to a delay. 0.1 seconds - 10 seconds or something)
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 22:09:23 Almost mimicking a redstone repeater (like that game we all know)
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 22:09:40 You press F, 2 seconds later, motor moves
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 22:09:43 or 1 second or 10
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 22:09:59 Not sure  what that is
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 22:10:00 lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 22:10:24 can't suggest that's why i'm here xD also thanks guys i thought it was another stupid idea
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 23:24:34 Non official suggestion #4: Pistons have an option to "start on launch" so when you launch your vehicle, it automatically turns on the piston. Example uses: You want a plane to hide it's landing gear as it's gun pops out of the plane, press one letter, landings go up, guns go down. Could add a menu for (additional settings) or be able to scroll down.
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 23:25:06 I mean, you could just have both set to a different keybind, but that would take up more of your keyboard for advanced builds.
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 23:26:31 I suppose my suggestion would be a more simplistic alternative, but yeah
