plane-crazy 2022-10-01 01:48:38 is pretty basic but does it fit for an iowa-class
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 01:48:59 
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 02:41:46 Never. Again. AaaAAAAa
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 03:21:47 you wouldnt believe how many times ive redone this bow of my NJ, and now i gotta redo it again because its way too underscaled
plane-crazy 2022-10-01 03:21:50 so i feel ur pain
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:06:41 I really hope PC2 is somewhere near completion, i just found 3 pretty game-breaking bugs since yesterday
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:07:01 lol nice
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:07:24 so were stuck with broken signs, broken disconnectors, and broken explosions?
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:07:28 for like ever?
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:07:30 wowww
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:08:31 where does it say tho
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:08:34 twitter?
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:09:06 ok so then where
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:09:09 did you hear it
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:09:52 shut up kid, its not my fault i dont listen to everything said on the internet without proof
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:10:17 says the guy whose PFP is literally a trollface
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:12:01 i had made a IGBM, but every time i disconnect it just stays there and floats instead of going forwards when i activate the rockets
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:12:08 but when i tried without DC, it moved just fine
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:12:44 yeah i thought so, but my point still stands, it kinda really sucks
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:13:19 bro can you just shut up with ur overused roasts
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:13:31 alr thanks for tip
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 22:18:17 oh and i know this one is known but also the pvp bug where the enemy appears where it isnt
creations-chat 2022-10-14 00:23:26 and why would they do that? Unfinished?
creations-chat 2022-10-14 00:25:30 nah i just forgor ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2022-10-14 00:28:01 wrong chat bro soz
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:02:25 does anybody know a small turret build for a nevada-class battleship? im not very good at small turrets
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 22:39:45 does anybody know a good 2 gun turret that can fit in a 3x3 barbette for a ship
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 22:39:56 
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 22:40:16 i really cant find a good one ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2022-12-24 23:13:23 i did it because theres always that one kid who throws it in your face that you got no upvotes bruh not because im insecure and dumb
creations-chat 2022-12-24 23:15:30 mk thx
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:27:56 yo can someone give me a historical battleship idea that isnt yamato cuz i dont feel like doing a yamato
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:28:12 tirpitz
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:28:14 ok nice
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:28:44 also do ryujo i think its a funny japan loophole carrier
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:28:48 hm yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:28:50 ok
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:30:03 im practicing my battleship building skills, ive done one so far and its kinda cringe but also not bad at the same time
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:31:49 im good at tanks and cars. ive made a whole 1 plane that looked half decent and yet was still cringy
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:33:32 the one tip i have for you that i cant even do yet is to get the size right. i made USS Oklahoma and it did not work because i made it too small scale and i couldnt even fit guns on
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:36:00 do you want me to show you a pic of my oklahoma?
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:36:07 its pretty trash just because of scale
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:36:14 but the actual details are decent
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:37:06 
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:37:43 empty barbettes cuz idk how to make a small enough main gun design for both the 2-barrel and 3-barrel main battery
plane-crazy 2023-01-04 23:40:08 maybe im too lazy to build it big, but im pretty sure its because i dont have any good hull designs to rely on
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 01:34:36 well clearly i cant make a gun design that is small enough
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 01:40:40 oh yes very helpful
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 01:40:44 also i cant seem to get emojis
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 01:40:48 ;-;
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 01:42:30 bruh is writing an entire highschool essay
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 01:42:58 known
