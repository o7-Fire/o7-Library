creations-chat 2020-10-07 06:43:07 The one at the back are just trails
creations-chat 2020-10-07 06:43:44 The front one took some motorlocking
creations-chat 2020-10-07 06:44:23 I guess you can see how it should work here
creations-chat 2020-10-07 06:45:47 
creations-chat 2020-10-07 06:46:16 Yea, I wanted to angle it so I resorted to alot of this crap
creations-chat 2020-10-07 06:46:44 huh
creations-chat 2020-10-07 06:47:27 Motor 2 wont work, I had to use cameras as limiters as you can see in the 3rd pic
creations-chat 2020-10-07 06:47:44 so they just stop it perfectly where it should be
creations-chat 2020-10-07 06:48:23 Now I just need to cover up this gaping hole in the fuselage
creations-chat 2020-10-07 06:49:18 well, the pink blocks are the cameras
creations-chat 2020-10-07 06:49:48 They act as stoppers or limiters so it doesnt over or under angle
