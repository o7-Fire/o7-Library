plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:18:09 my control surfaces freak out whenever I try to fly new builds, how can I fix this?
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:19:07 I'm on mobile
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:19:32 sweet thanks
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:23:10 how would I use it though, because my control surfaces are breaking without me touching the phone
bug-reports 2023-06-02 02:26:19 I still don't know how to fix the issue of control surfaces breaking once I spawn, I place them on a plane and they freak out once I spawn
