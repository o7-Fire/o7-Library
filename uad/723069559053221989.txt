creations-chat 2020-11-21 03:56:02 I also have the space shuttle, although I would say this one is better than mine.
creations-chat 2020-11-21 04:18:21 Yea, that's pretty much why they are under-used.
creations-chat 2020-11-21 04:24:27 because it's at the water. it's for boats btw
creations-chat 2020-11-21 04:28:18 Making it accessible only by plane doesn't sound right for me.
creations-chat 2020-11-21 04:29:50 Never seen an airport by water aside from aircraft carriers, and yes this is stationary.
creations-chat 2020-11-21 04:31:52 It's not at the shore in this case. :\
