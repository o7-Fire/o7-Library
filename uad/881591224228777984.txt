creations-chat 2022-12-12 01:40:43 trash opinion
creations-chat 2022-12-12 01:44:08 The f14 can’t supercruise, the maintenance of the f 14 is ungodly expensive, it was only a success because all the other planes of the other country’s were ass
creations-chat 2022-12-12 01:49:44 also comparing the f14 to the scrap metal pile that is the su 57 is unfair
creations-chat 2022-12-12 01:58:21 real

creations-chat 2022-12-12 02:47:19 someone’s about to get warned <:SoonTM:501066468629413916>
general 2022-12-12 02:50:36 he’s just looking for reasons to hate on it
general 2022-12-12 02:55:38 average Elon fanboy
general 2022-12-12 02:56:42 first of all, he’s just buying company’s to expand his portfolio. He does very little of the science himself. Not to say he doesn’t do anything at all
general 2022-12-12 02:57:20 Also NASA exists
general 2022-12-12 02:58:47 moon landings
general 2022-12-12 02:59:28 they are still doing them today
general 2022-12-12 02:59:40 they didnt do a mars landing yet
general 2022-12-12 03:00:23 and at least 10 years for a mars landing
creations-chat 2023-02-09 02:42:57 I aint reading allat 🤣👎
creations-chat 2023-02-09 02:59:34 doesn’t the su 57 have a radar cross section similar to that of 3rd gen aircraft lol
creations-chat 2023-02-09 03:02:00 idk man a “stealth” fighter having the cross section of a non stealth fighter doesn’t seem ok
creations-chat 2023-02-09 03:04:03 wdym “can you read?”
creations-chat 2023-02-09 03:07:40 
creations-chat 2023-02-09 03:11:51 So you want to edit the text to say 4th gen fighter or what? Plus I was just saying that to exaggerate how the su 57 has very bad radar cross section for being a stealth plane
creations-chat 2023-02-09 03:15:51 F18 is clearly the best stealth platform, if you disagree with me you are simply wrong
creations-chat 2023-02-09 03:25:57 I get it now, Mig said that the su57 and f18 have similar rcs, so that means that the su 57 must have the capability’s of the f18. I am a genius
creations-chat 2023-02-09 03:28:21 You wouldn’t get it
creations-chat 2023-02-09 03:38:42 russia made like 5 billion su 57s and they still gonna find a way to lose them all
