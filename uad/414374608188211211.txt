creations-chat 2022-10-01 19:09:30 How long have you guys been playing plane crazy for?
general 2022-10-02 17:05:28 you have to try for contest winner
general 2022-10-02 17:06:44 i can build a giant mech in less than one day lol
general 2022-10-02 17:06:49 and get more than 70 upvotes
general 2022-10-02 17:08:31 Lack of intakes makes it look weird
creations-chat 2022-10-08 05:17:24 How do I make better pics for <#384025409945337856> ?
creations-chat 2022-10-08 08:02:05 Mechs are really easy to make
creations-chat 2022-10-09 09:39:33 Expert roles are too easy to get
creations-chat 2022-10-09 09:41:46 I saw someone with expert designer V post the worst looking spacex spaceship. They got the expert designer role from a mediocre looking cheeseburger meme build.
creations-chat 2022-10-09 09:45:43 Basically even with low effort builds you can get expert roles (minimum like count is 20)
creations-chat 2022-10-09 09:47:50 And most of those meme builds look terrible
creations-chat 2022-10-09 11:48:22 What shader presets do you guys use for pics?
creations-chat 2022-10-09 11:50:48 Not really I just want to know what stuff people use
creations-chat 2022-10-09 11:55:14 Yeah I just want to know what roshade presets people use
creations-chat 2022-10-09 11:58:06 k thanks
creations-chat 2022-10-09 15:17:30 yeah
creations-chat 2022-10-09 15:35:41 Shaders make getting upvotes easier which is kinda unfair
creations-chat 2022-10-09 15:38:10 Versus actual photos without shaders
creations-chat 2022-10-09 15:42:23 good
creations-chat 2022-10-10 13:12:18 When i post builds with shaders i always post a non shader photo next to the shader ones
creations-chat 2022-10-10 14:08:01 Turning this into a mech is a pretty cool idea, so im gonna do it
creations-chat 2022-10-10 15:15:02 i think people just dont really like small planes (also people really dislike that type of landing gear)
creations-chat 2022-10-10 15:17:37 But its kinda impossible to make custom landing gear that size
creations-chat 2022-10-10 18:43:20 i made a new type of magnet engine lol
creations-chat 2022-10-13 16:49:13 What should i add to this?
