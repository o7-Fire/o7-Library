help 2018-12-21 19:28:40 will fuel/batteries ever be a thing in this?
help 2018-12-21 19:35:03 Not really. There's a few people that like the idea of fuel efficiency, I was just saying because it gets kinda boring with the same old challenges.
help 2018-12-21 19:38:46 Honestly, I hope they add "Infinite fuel" in the menu thats toggled on by default.
help 2018-12-21 19:38:50 
help 2018-12-21 19:39:19 My question was inspired by this. Cuz obviously its been thought about before, so maybe they took it out because of bugs?
help 2018-12-21 19:42:22 Yeah
help 2018-12-21 19:46:34 Well to be honest, if its not a forced update then I'd rather it just be like simple planes.
help 2018-12-21 19:47:12 But yeah, if its not an option then maybe its not the best idea to make it super realistic
creations-chat 2019-01-10 18:34:24 Eco-Corp Airbike. It's lowest flight speed is 70 and lowest flight thruttle is around 20%. It holds two (The driver and one passenger) and is very easy to control despite it only having 17 parts, some even for cosmetic looks. Highest speed is 188, but easily could be higher if I used rocket engines, which I don't use in my builds due to them being Eco-friendly (Just a little task I've set myself.)
creations-chat 2019-01-10 18:43:15 Eco-Corp Duo Airbike. It's lowest flight speed is also 70 and lowest flight thruttle is approximately 12.5%. It holds 4 people (Driver and 3 passengers) and is also very easy to control, but it does pull to one side if passengers are not evenly placed. it has 26 parts.

creations-chat 2019-01-13 19:32:24 <@!295568493166985218> does the seat need to be apart of the craft itself? Or would it still count as a part if its not on the craft
