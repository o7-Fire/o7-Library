plane-crazy 2022-08-02 08:29:15 Very random but i just got some ideas for some suggestions for pc2, im posting this here because yall can say weather or not its a decent idea or not. An idea that i have been thunking about for a while is a type of air layering system and air breathing engines, so if you go too high with the wrong engine then the engine will slowly stall and shut off. Another idea which is kinda pointless is g-force effects; so if you pull up/down for too long the screen will get effected accordingly and some control will be slightly lost, this would help reduce the amount of people that just pull up for 5 min to avoid getting killed and would increase the amount of strategic fighting. One more idea is just aerodynamics, so if you place a flat block it would have similar effects to a airbrake, and would have a significant amount of drag, but if you placed a pyramid it would have almost no drag. Idk about half of these ideas. I just wanted to put the ideas out there.
