The Tale of 333zoe (1006383561718382604)
help 2022-10-18 00:33:34 How can I improve my carrier?
help 2022-10-18 00:35:10 Ok thanks
help 2022-10-18 00:38:45 Motors you can see
help 2022-10-18 02:19:40 Maybe motors?
help 2022-10-18 02:20:24 What do you all like better for the front of my carrier? Ver 1 or Ver 2
help 2022-10-18 02:22:20 I know there already is motors
help 2022-10-18 02:23:14 How do you want it to move?
help 2022-10-18 02:24:27 Like what way?
help 2022-10-18 02:31:42 Ok hm
help 2022-10-18 02:34:05 Yes
help 2022-10-18 02:34:52 But they are motor 2 so you want to switch to regular motor so you can lock it
help 2022-10-18 02:35:12 Keeps it still
help 2022-10-18 03:06:38 You could make another rotor on the tail, if you have seen those types of helis you know what I’m talking about
help 2022-10-18 03:07:46 Oh
help 2022-10-18 03:07:50 One sec
help 2022-10-18 03:09:47 This is a random Lego heli I have, anyway kinda like that
help 2022-10-18 03:11:37 Ok
help 2022-10-18 03:13:13 This is a single rotor heli, you could use that to keep it from spinning (the tail)
help 2022-10-18 03:14:00 I’ll do my best to explain what I’m trying to say
help 2022-10-18 03:14:41 So basically the tail rotor is pushing against the top rotor so it doesn’t spin
help 2022-10-18 03:16:44 I see what’s wrong with your tail now!
help 2022-10-18 03:18:01 In this photo of the back the tail rotor is not made out of propeller wings or control surfaces
help 2022-10-18 03:19:15 I’m trying to help mailashby
help 2022-10-18 03:19:59 Telling him what he could try to fix
help 2022-10-18 03:21:23 He is having trouble with his heli spinning he said
