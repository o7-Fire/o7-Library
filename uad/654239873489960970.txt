bug-reports 2020-03-14 21:15:06 If you get in a seat on a craft by a player you are blacklisted by, and they teleport back to their base, you get teleported inside the blacklisted plot. Just happened for me there, I think a bug fix is in order.
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 08:56:40 because it does so many rpm, its probs gonna spread because 1, Its gonna have so much centrifugal force that it'll get thrown outward and 2, plane crazy physics are dodgy

general 2020-03-18 16:22:53 Ive been messing around on it
general 2020-03-18 16:23:04 its a walkie-talkie app
general 2020-03-18 16:23:29 runs on radio frequencies
general 2020-03-18 16:23:35 so its like
general 2020-03-18 16:23:52 if you don't have someones phone number
general 2020-03-18 16:24:00 or your talking on roblox
general 2020-03-18 16:24:07 you give a radio frequency
general 2020-03-18 16:24:12 for example
general 2020-03-18 16:24:16 49.49
general 2020-03-18 16:24:22 and you both connect
general 2020-03-18 16:24:48 exactly

general 2020-03-18 16:29:30 since we might be closed til' summer hols Higher Students (the highest secondary school grade you can get) might never get their exam which means they might not get the qualification (since you take Highers in 6th year which is your last year)

general 2020-03-18 16:31:38 That would be HO2
general 2020-03-18 16:32:34 Which would be 2 oxygen particles with a hydrogen
general 2020-03-18 16:36:16 This is purifiedwater14's status

Edit - A player called reportmepl3asealt1 was saying he would report me for sending this report. Highly doubt he will though. Also, don't ban the kid. He's only a  small little unde, so I don't think he understands the meaning of it. Just give him a day ban or something.

creations-chat 2020-03-25 19:07:09 The newest boat in the Royal Plane Crazy Naval Fleet, the HMS Hamish (named after my late grandfather) is the best ship I've ever made. This large ship has probably the most detailed interior I've ever made, and it took a few days to build.
This warship has 3 decks; the below decks, the main deck, and the bridge. The below decks is fitted with sleeping quarters, a mess hall and a recreational area. The main deck, pictured in the picture below, has 2 guns and a helipad (behind the bridge). The bridge is fitted with 8 computers, the main ship controls, and a captains quarters.
More screenshots are to follow.

Have a good day! üòÅ

general 2020-03-26 09:06:53 get an expert rank

general 2020-03-26 09:07:25 no
general 2020-03-26 09:07:38 we must leave the gods undisturbed
general 2020-03-26 09:07:53 I have more friends than you have a life
general 2020-03-26 09:10:14 it would be funny tho
general 2020-03-26 09:10:34 You could probably make ball joint engines tbh
general 2020-03-26 09:11:14 yes
general 2020-03-26 09:12:12 > i made a turret
<@263959626804887552> nice
general 2020-03-26 09:12:20 but <#384021699466756107>
general 2020-03-26 09:13:00 I will literally go and make a ball joint right now
general 2020-03-26 09:13:11 It's just 3 motors
general 2020-03-26 09:13:32 it's really not
general 2020-03-26 09:14:06 atleast the ball joint idea in my brain isnt offset
general 2020-03-26 09:18:00 excuse the shitty drawing
general 2020-03-26 09:18:18 that could literally serve the same function as a ball joint
general 2020-03-26 09:18:34 and it's literally recycled from a turret
general 2020-03-26 09:18:42 3x3 is pretty smol tho
general 2020-03-26 09:19:22 It would still serve the same purpose tho
general 2020-03-26 09:20:17 but you're not seeing my point
general 2020-03-26 09:20:30 I'm not saying its gonna be perfect for everything
general 2020-03-26 09:20:42 anyways I was the one saying improvise to you

plane-crazy 2020-03-26 09:29:59 Should I build a bigger ship?
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 09:30:36 cuz I think that ship was only just approaching the 1k mark
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 10:17:17 I might take a break from building battle cruisers and make a cruise ship tbh
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 10:18:04 it would probs be my first tri-fold
plane-crazy 2020-03-26 10:18:14 or maybe just a private yacht

general 2020-04-04 18:16:15 that's an all-time low tbh
general 2020-04-04 18:17:02 jailbreak's event may have accidentally killed Adopt Me
general 2020-04-04 18:17:36 when all the unde's heard that there was a Jailbreak event they all fucking ditched Adopt Me.

general 2020-04-04 18:20:21 unless the devs have fake bots on Adopt Me all the time so it's popular
general 2020-04-04 18:40:02 I may have just accidentally prepared a full-scale attack on adopt me on another server
general 2020-04-04 18:40:21 they were supposed to be doing a raid so I suggested why don't we do adopt me
general 2020-04-04 18:40:34 and one of the mods was like heck yes

general 2020-04-08 09:02:41 I see the box
general 2020-04-08 09:03:52 I estimate we'll get at least 1/4 extra players because of the Egg Hunt
general 2020-04-08 09:04:27 I hated that egg tho
general 2020-04-08 09:04:47 it took me half an hour trying to get the egg
general 2020-04-08 09:06:03 Requirements should be
‚Ä¢Get the EGG
‚Ä¢Play for 20 minutes
general 2020-04-08 09:06:11 cuz for 20 minutes
general 2020-04-08 09:06:20 they would have to build something
general 2020-04-08 09:06:34 because if you ho inactive for 20 mins
general 2020-04-08 09:07:00 it *le kick*'s you

general 2020-04-08 09:07:47 <#495286269459300364>
general 2020-04-08 09:08:27 It forces you to go through the tutorial if your a new player
general 2020-04-08 09:08:34 cuz then they build the plane
general 2020-04-08 09:08:40 then fly it to the egg

general 2020-04-08 17:59:24 But this morning I said we would have maybe double the footfall
general 2020-04-08 17:59:31 Even search it up
general 2020-04-08 18:01:42 I'm *totally* not a time-traveller üòè
general 2020-04-08 18:02:57 I'll tell the secrets to time-travel if Darkz gives Shinji Nitro
general 2020-04-08 18:03:37 Yup we be staying strong on 8.3k
general 2020-04-08 18:03:46 Y'know what
general 2020-04-08 18:03:51 within the week
general 2020-04-08 18:04:24 we will hit 28 million visits
general 2020-04-08 18:04:43 remember these messages
general 2020-04-08 18:05:01 me
general 2020-04-08 18:05:10 I wanna prove that I'm a time traveller
general 2020-04-08 18:06:18 damn ive sent 2k messages

plane-crazy 2020-04-08 18:08:27 So its wednesday
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 18:09:44 if we hit 28 mil by Monday 13th April at 00:00 UTC I am a time traveller

general 2020-04-08 18:15:37 
general 2020-04-08 18:15:59 y'all know its true
general 2020-04-08 18:17:13 that's why is said "by" not "on"
general 2020-04-08 18:17:33 not disclosing details
general 2020-04-08 18:17:58 I could break the space-time continuum if I give out specific details.
general 2020-04-08 18:18:03 like, for example...
general 2020-04-08 18:18:21 say I said "boris Johnson is gonna die within the next week"
general 2020-04-08 18:18:38 Imo
general 2020-04-08 18:18:56 Why is your discord name still Tyrxnt

general 2020-04-08 18:19:36 back to my thing
general 2020-04-08 18:20:05 if I said "boris Johnson will die on --------"
general 2020-04-08 18:20:15 and I was a time traveller
general 2020-04-08 18:20:25 it would split the space-time continuim
general 2020-04-08 18:20:44 because someone from NHS might find out
general 2020-04-08 18:20:49 and then try save him
general 2020-04-08 18:20:57 its a stretch, but yeah
general 2020-04-08 18:21:49 if we hit 28mil by my estimated time Darkz gives you nitro
general 2020-04-08 18:21:58 or I get fonk to force them to

creations-chat 2020-04-11 11:57:49 Now Presenting... the Bluebird K7!
Used by the late Donald Campbell to set many water speed records, this boat was Campbell's final resting place after he crashed it trying to go to 300mph in 1967.
However, since 2002, the Bluebird Project team have been restoring this beast of a machine to it's former glory. Then, in 2018, the came to Loch Fad, on the Isle of Bute, to test her out.
I was fortunate enough to know the bailiff of the Loch, and I got to stand next to the Bluebird, and oh my, what an absolute beast she is. The engine was absolutely massive. Everything about it was... amazing, to say the least.
Then, a few days ago, I was going through my old creations when I found an old rendition of the K7. I realised that she looked like a piece of shit, and for the past few days, I've been trying to fix her up and I finally finished.
She has a top speed of 200, about how fast they were running her on Loch Fad. I realise that not every part of it is perfect, but it's the best I could do.
(PS - I realised that the intakes on the top photo are yellow. That is because those were the intake covers so nothing bad could happen to the intakes)

general 2020-04-22 18:45:45 > Who wants to mess around on Neo Warfare X with me?
HELLO IM TRYING TO CHANGE THE DISCUSSION
general 2020-04-22 18:46:38 stuff that wasnt in development
general 2020-04-22 18:48:00 henk was a decent guy until he leaked
general 2020-04-22 18:48:51 no map until someone make map
general 2020-04-22 18:50:09 I mean I could do it but I would spend months to perfect details cuz I'm majorly OCD
general 2020-04-22 18:51:09 no mad is getting engineering degree
general 2020-04-22 18:52:43 when mad gets his degree and gets a job he will probably fully resign from being Innovation chairman and become "Honourary Chairman" and hand over ownership to someone else.
general 2020-04-22 18:53:24 mad shut or you'll get muted
general 2020-04-22 18:53:45 I bet madspeed is gonna dm bomb me now

general 2020-04-23 08:07:45 I think the dude who said he took down TF2 and CS:GO is bluffing
general 2020-04-23 08:08:18 if he really wanted to do something he should have leaked the source code or whatever of Steam itself
general 2020-04-23 08:08:49 cuz then it wouldn't matter if you were online or not
general 2020-04-23 08:09:11 they could literally take over every account and bring Steam down
general 2020-04-23 08:15:46 üåÆüåÆ

plane-crazy 2020-05-07 17:31:20 Give an honest opinion or say nothing.
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 17:32:39 that's because I had to turn down my game graphics
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 17:32:46 it lagged like hell
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 17:35:45 Well how the fuck is it a low-poly model
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 17:38:03 Exactly.
general 2020-05-07 17:38:42 ye epi
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 17:39:54 Not low poly because I added fucking details
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 17:40:12 and if I had less shitty camera angles it would look better
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 17:40:42 aight
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 17:40:51 see the little side trench things?

plane-crazy 2020-05-07 17:43:30 Thanks
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 17:45:05 The side trenches dip in that slight bit to add some depth, I made the back blue bits of the engines reflective so more of the light bounces off, and I added some more details from the picture I was referencing from

general 2020-05-14 10:11:14 he was chill for a while
general 2020-05-14 10:11:32 and then I started to notice some erratic behaviour

general 2020-05-14 10:13:52 He started going on those weird Poland ball games and doing WW2 german men roleplays
general 2020-05-14 10:14:08 that's when I really got weirded out
general 2020-05-14 10:14:16 and it gets worse
general 2020-05-14 10:14:22 the next day I join his game
general 2020-05-14 10:14:38 *hes on Blox Watch HQ using hacks*
general 2020-05-14 10:14:56 I told him to chill tf down and *he threatened to hack me*

general 2020-05-14 10:50:21 Ik evaera is trying her hardest but they need to get multiple servers fir the bot
general 2020-05-14 10:50:41 it's literally always down for exceeding IP limit
general 2020-05-14 10:51:25 evaera says shes not stopped working on RoVer 2 but I dont see how changing bots would fix it
general 2020-05-14 10:51:35 she just needs to rent out more server spaces
general 2020-05-14 10:51:48 shes running rover from 1 server
general 2020-05-14 10:52:38 I feel like you guys should start letting Plane Crazy servers use Hyperbot
general 2020-05-14 10:53:02 cuz at this rate if we cant get people verified on smaller servers its gonna get hectic
general 2020-05-14 10:54:03 and bloxlink isnt any better
general 2020-05-14 10:54:10 it's going down all the time as well

general 2020-05-14 10:55:52 that's really tedious though

general 2020-06-05 11:57:57 AHAHAHAAHAHA FAKEEEE
bug-reports 2020-06-05 12:33:45 There's a really annoying bug where, if you stop in your creation on the ground, it locks your creation in place and you have to flip to fix it.
Easiest way to fix it without flipping right now is putting a motor that doesn't attach to a block, which updates it, but I think it would be better to have a fix, rather than sticking a random motor to our creations.
(cant get screenshots right now, will try and get them later)
general 2020-06-05 12:34:08 hello

general 2020-06-05 12:38:12 I wanna know what the rifle is
general 2020-06-05 12:38:39 money costs money
general 2020-06-05 12:38:47 you have to pay money to get money
general 2020-06-05 12:38:55 cuz you can buy pennies
general 2020-06-05 12:41:10 yo I was making a logo for a homework project and it looks sick

bug-reports 2020-06-05 12:48:31 Ah ok
bug-reports 2020-06-05 12:49:05 It's usually creations with free-turning wheels (ball wheels, landing gear, etc) that freeze
bug-reports 2020-06-05 12:49:16 So I think its because they dont want it to store momentum
general 2020-06-05 12:50:26 shit

general 2020-06-05 12:53:12 I prefer AP because its got more obstacles and makes it more exciting
general 2020-06-05 12:53:51 I might actually learn to properly code and make shit to make a remastered version of both games
general 2020-06-05 12:54:03 So you can pick between the two maps

general 2020-06-05 13:54:47 all their investors are having second thoughts after Starship exploded
general 2020-06-05 13:55:14 Tesla is a safe bet because there's not much that could go wrong

plane-crazy 2020-06-09 17:17:45 <@456226577798135808> according to your logic, those planes i spedrun that look nice are low-effort, therefore shouldnt be posted

creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:23:04 doe you guys like my costom pickup/
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:23:32 yeah needs more helium or ballast tanks
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:23:45 because you can use ballast tanks to raise its position on the water
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:24:18 also put helium in the highest point of the ship so it stays upright
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:24:26 and is basically unflippable
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:24:42 <@!280393446114590722> make a mini Iowa

creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:27:33 i dont like to upvote on creations that people dislike because i feel like they'll take it out on me
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:27:40 yeah
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:27:48 effort-wise i'd give it 100%
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:28:06 if you took out the "Iowa" part from the name it would get tonnes of upvotes
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:28:14 cuz its a good ship
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:29:47 pancake dude was the only dude who downvoted because he thought it was low-effort

creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:32:09 yeah
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:32:17 My main goal was to make it look nice
plane-crazy 2020-06-09 17:38:05 i feel like Pancake should read this convo ngl
general 2020-06-09 17:38:28 he looking hawt
general 2020-06-09 17:39:09 Hyper draw my avatar (a noob) in the most realistic way possible to mankind

creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:46:38 Yo Jack gimme what you got
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:46:47 I need constructive criticism
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:47:09 no
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:47:14 he upvoted mine
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:48:47 You downvoted my creation so I was asking for constructive criticism
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:49:16 Its only 2, don't get all hot and bothered mate
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:49:54 Yeah thats fine
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:50:04 I wanted to go for a simplistic and clean look
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:50:14 If I put in too much detail it distracts people
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:51:57 *And "Best Name of The Year" goes to.....*
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:52:20 No seriously, that cracked me up.
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:54:10 tbh I think the whole reason my pickup succeeded was because of the caption
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:54:33 its... flat.
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:54:59 I would suggest throwing in some lighter greys and making the cabin taller
creations-chat 2020-06-09 17:55:29 Stick lighter grays on the turrets and stuff, gives it more definition
general 2020-06-09 17:56:16 guys should I make a bus in the same style as my pickup?
general 2020-06-09 17:56:42 im doing it

creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:23:37 Well, I understand the basic principle
creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:23:54 Disc go spinny and pull object
creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:24:33 But that requires real physics, which Plane crazy has none of.
creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:24:39 Except aerodynamics
creations-chat 2020-06-10 10:25:02 So I dont see how that would work

the-dump 2020-06-10 13:41:10 basically is ngl
the-dump 2020-06-10 13:42:42 There was a time where they were trynna find out if the Pyramids were made by aliens because they was symmetrical and shit and they spent about 3 hours talking about crazy shit until they went up to some tired archaeologist and he just said "maybe they used a wheel" and the whole show just bombed
the-dump 2020-06-10 13:43:00 ***They literally forgot about circles***
the-dump 2020-06-10 13:57:47 The only reason there was an extra 5 was because that Earth god woman got 5 extra days off of Khonsu to give birth to her children
the-dump 2020-06-10 13:58:04 Because annoying sun man Ra wouldnt let her give birth
the-dump 2020-06-10 13:58:10 on any of the 360
the-dump 2020-06-10 13:58:20 so she betted with Khonsu and he added an extra 5 days
the-dump 2020-06-10 13:58:32 Todays history lesson is now over.
the-dump 2020-06-10 13:59:18 My memory of it is fading, its been a while since I read about it
the-dump 2020-06-10 14:03:05 yeah
the-dump 2020-06-10 14:03:17 unless we made an "hour" 75 minutes
the-dump 2020-06-10 14:03:51 all these measurements of time are made up by us though, we could easily just change an hour to 75 minutes if we wanted

general 2020-06-12 15:01:27 also you need to pay to access most channels
general 2020-06-12 15:01:42 nah
general 2020-06-12 15:01:48 they raised the prices to 50
general 2020-06-12 15:01:54 per channel

general 2020-06-12 15:02:48 but then to get the rank

general 2020-06-12 15:06:38 the main guitar riff from La Grange is fucking iconic man
general 2020-06-12 15:07:42 I made a shitty Falcon 9 replica
general 2020-06-12 15:07:50 which somehow works
general 2020-06-12 15:07:58 without the full version of the game
general 2020-06-12 15:08:05 so with all the standard blocks
general 2020-06-12 15:08:23 but imma try get my parents to let me get the full version
general 2020-06-12 15:08:32 since its only like ¬£3
general 2020-06-12 15:08:43 Yeah
general 2020-06-12 15:08:54 You can get a goot gravitational launch towards the moon
general 2020-06-12 15:09:04 but landing on it is hard
general 2020-06-12 15:09:19 Once you read the mechanics of the game it gets easier
general 2020-06-12 15:10:04 Once you get used to landing boosters on Earth, it gets easier to land a small capsule on the Moon
general 2020-06-12 15:11:29 But tbh there's no point buying KSP rn
general 2020-06-12 15:11:41 yeah
general 2020-06-12 15:11:45 Imma save up for that
general 2020-06-12 15:11:55 I think 2021

general 2020-06-18 11:32:37 and he hasnt shown any proof that he is 13+

general 2020-06-18 11:33:30 <@456226577798135808>, do you plead guilty or not guilty?

general 2020-06-18 11:34:17 <@456226577798135808>, do you plead guilty or not guilty?

general 2020-06-18 12:06:55 > u sound like unde, u act like unde, ur roblox account is unde, u lie about ur location, u dont know ur birthday.
as <@!670939038999511041> explains

general 2020-06-18 12:07:20 but its 2pm in South Africa
general 2020-06-18 12:07:49 why wuld you lie about that tho?
general 2020-06-18 12:08:12 
general 2020-06-18 12:08:36 we have literally created a full court case
general 2020-06-18 12:08:41 WAIT LEMME SAY A FEW WORDS
general 2020-06-18 12:09:17 The jury and the court find the defendant, <@456226577798135808>, guilty of violating Rule 9 of the Plane Crazy Discord. The mods will now sentence him.
general 2020-06-18 12:09:58 I now pronounce this case ***CLOSED***.
general 2020-06-18 12:10:25 It was democracy though.
general 2020-06-18 12:10:38 Mhm.
general 2020-06-18 12:10:46 Maple is correct.
general 2020-06-18 12:10:53 Anyways, case closed.
general 2020-06-18 12:11:35 We found him guilty of breaking Rule 9
general 2020-06-18 12:12:07 <@!370594904268734464> you have the final say in this.
general 2020-06-18 12:12:14 Ban or no ban?
general 2020-06-18 12:14:17 Guys I made a server for future cases so if y'all wanna migrate to there as so not to spam the chat that would be great ngl (sorry if this is advertising <@!370594904268734464>)
general 2020-06-18 12:14:50 yeah
general 2020-06-18 12:15:00 EVERYONE SHUT UP YOUSUF IS TALKING
general 2020-06-18 12:38:55 yo what hapened to gg?
general 2020-06-18 12:38:59 I was away eating
general 2020-06-18 12:39:04 <@!509641743570829312>
general 2020-06-18 12:39:21 Good.
general 2020-06-18 12:43:30 yeah
general 2020-06-18 13:02:55 I made the courthouse server <@!370594904268734464> so we dont spam chat if this happens again
general 2020-06-18 13:04:44 how to suggest
general 2020-06-18 13:04:48 there
general 2020-06-18 13:04:53 use that in bot central
general 2020-06-18 13:25:07 yesh
general 2020-06-18 13:27:00 I mean with enough time and after Mad ***softcodes the fucking game*** that would be possible
general 2020-06-18 13:31:11 > "hey dev why is thi sfeature not her!?!??!?!?!?!?!??!!?!"
> "we cannot its haradcoded!!!!"
> "just softcode it"
<@!289143255357063169> you realise how long it'll take to softcode the whole game? Rick's been working at it for months, but as soon as we get Mad back we could have it softcoded in about 2 weeks.
general 2020-06-18 13:31:47 we defo need to get mad back
general 2020-06-18 13:46:05 <@!339519624968404993> WOW! 1,000 POINTS TO YOU! Of course i dont know what I'm talking about, but I do know that it is possible to completely redo the game with Mad's help. He is, quite literally, the best coder in the history of Roblox. This man creates data compressors in minutes. This man can do anything if he puts his mind to it. And he is most definitely coming back.
general 2020-06-18 13:47:07 Super, I bet my bottom dollar you dont know what you're talking about either.
general 2020-06-18 13:47:52 And don't even think for a second that because you have junior moderator that I will be discouraged to have an argument with you.
general 2020-06-18 13:49:14 hmmm
general 2020-06-18 13:49:31 i think that they really want some simple starter mechanics
general 2020-06-18 13:50:04 I like using the wedges from Wedge2
general 2020-06-18 13:50:15 gives me quite alot more freedom when building ngl
general 2020-06-18 13:50:54 Anyways, can I point out that we severly need half-block versions of the Wedge2 section
general 2020-06-18 13:51:25 Meh
general 2020-06-18 13:53:02 Tbh, it would be smarter to, when the game isnt hardcoded, completely revamp the build system so it uses a system like Roblox Studio. Or, you could pick between standard building and Roblox Studio style, which would give you more building freedom.
general 2020-06-18 13:54:39 Yeah <@!304977711988867072>  dont feel guilty. We all snap at some point, so its happened to everyone. You're just, y'know, *part of the club now, I guess.*
general 2020-06-18 13:55:31 I mean, should we literally just scrap together a bunch of programmers from this server and make PC2 by ourselves?
general 2020-06-18 13:55:48 Or we could literally just get people who're good with Lua to help rick
general 2020-06-18 13:57:13 Rick should just get a bunch of people who're good with Lua from this server to just work on softcoding the game until we get mad
general 2020-06-18 13:57:32 Yeah but only people we really trust
general 2020-06-18 13:57:44 jesus christ
general 2020-06-18 13:57:49 Super, you need to stop man.
general 2020-06-18 13:57:58 You keep getting angry for no reasons at me.
general 2020-06-18 13:58:12 No, you listen to what I'm saying first.
general 2020-06-18 13:58:23 Ok so.
general 2020-06-18 13:59:09 I loosely use the term "softcode" to mean "have the game not in hardcode, but something that is easily edited"
general 2020-06-18 13:59:18 Which does not mean you blow your head off at me.
general 2020-06-18 13:59:29 Omg.
general 2020-06-18 13:59:48 Y'know what I'm just gonna crack on with homework.
general 2020-06-18 14:00:07 I'm trying to explain this as clearly as possible and you're still not understanding.
general 2020-06-18 14:00:10 > make a new game with non bruh code
<@!308156968550268928> YES
general 2020-06-18 14:00:54 Yeah
general 2020-06-18 14:01:42 I do
general 2020-06-18 14:01:49 So gimme the money
general 2020-06-18 14:02:11 Yeah I use Wedge2 quite alot whilst building
general 2020-06-18 14:02:25 Yeah
general 2020-06-18 14:03:18 If everyone gave, let's say $5, Rick would have enough money to stay fed and watered for a few months so he could focus full-time on getting this stuff done.
general 2020-06-18 14:03:33 And if we kept chipping in, we could keep him going for a while
general 2020-06-18 14:03:45 Same
general 2020-06-18 14:04:01 Im losing interest rn as well, running out of stuff to build.
general 2020-06-18 14:08:05 I **would** go back to building boats, but like Rick I dont really have the motivation to do it
general 2020-06-18 14:08:32 Cuz building boats was fun.
general 2020-06-18 14:08:47 I basically made a self-righting boat without helium.
general 2020-06-18 14:09:04 OMG
general 2020-06-18 14:09:10 MAD
general 2020-06-18 14:09:35 O MIGHTY LORD MADATTAK, PLEASE BLESS US WITH YOUR MIGHTY PRESNECE

general 2020-06-18 14:17:58 You cant get in trouble for it
general 2020-06-18 14:18:08 Do it.
general 2020-06-18 14:18:14 We actually need mad
general 2020-06-18 14:18:21 Its not even funny now.
general 2020-06-18 14:18:33 This has acsended to the level of seriousness.
general 2020-06-18 14:19:17 Everyone go on Twitter and @ him in a post saying how much we need him and hopefully he'll see it.
general 2020-06-18 14:20:13 I say we start a GoFundMe for Mad
general 2020-06-18 14:20:27 All in favour of starting a GoFundMe say aye
general 2020-06-18 14:21:54 Nah, that would make him look bad
general 2020-06-18 14:24:42 No, not Youtube.
general 2020-06-18 14:25:01 Then we would get spammed with cringey edge-lords from the likes of Flamingo and sht.
general 2020-06-18 14:25:44 Leon just DM him rn
general 2020-06-18 14:25:52 He replies to my Dms most of the time
general 2020-06-18 14:26:47 > What if madattack joined discord
<@456226577798135808> look at online people xD
general 2020-06-18 14:27:16 Probably not
general 2020-06-18 14:27:24 He's on studio rn
general 2020-06-18 14:27:31 wait
general 2020-06-18 14:27:41 what game is he working on-
general 2020-06-18 14:28:35 yeah
general 2020-06-18 14:28:48 hold on
general 2020-06-18 14:29:48 maybe me and <@!615876745710534676> could do pixel arts?
general 2020-06-18 14:30:08 im thinking tho
general 2020-06-18 14:30:14 right hold on
general 2020-06-18 14:30:43 no
general 2020-06-18 14:30:45 crinj
general 2020-06-18 14:31:04 yeah
general 2020-06-18 14:31:16 yes
general 2020-06-18 14:31:27 using Unreal Engine
general 2020-06-18 14:32:13 I was joking tbh
general 2020-06-18 14:32:49 Once Roblox dies games will probably move off the platform.
general 2020-06-18 14:33:12 Adopt Me devs are probably already contemplating that tbh.
general 2020-06-18 14:33:32 If they moved off of Roblox tho
general 2020-06-18 14:33:42 Yes, they would have to completely recode the game
general 2020-06-18 14:33:57 But it would probably give them more freedom
general 2020-06-18 14:34:57 I feel like if we gave PC a more minecraft-y feel in the ads we could rope in a lot of players
general 2020-06-18 14:36:31 summer event is on _)+()*()+(_
general 2020-06-18 14:37:19 mhm

general 2020-06-23 19:08:34 here it is
general 2020-06-23 19:08:38 "It was the year 3005, and life isn‚Äôt the same anymore. People live their lives knowing that every movement that they make, every sound, every hair that moves, is monitored by The Legion, the supreme governing body of the Earth. You are never alone. Privacy is a thing of the past. The streets are lined with spies that tempt you with rebellion, and then get you imprisoned for life. The Legion will frame people they don‚Äôt like. They will kill anyone who opposes them. If you don‚Äôt follow their views, you mysteriously disappear in the middle of the night. No one can oppose the leaders of The Legion. Your opinion does not matter. The Legion decides what you say and do. You must follow the orders of The Legion. All hail The Legion."

general 2020-06-24 13:37:05 ok this is a keeper
general 2020-06-24 13:37:06 
general 2020-06-24 13:37:47 but yeah
general 2020-06-24 13:38:08 I've actually had a Spitfire fly over my neighbourhood before
general 2020-06-24 13:38:32 i've also seen them several times at airshows
general 2020-06-24 13:38:34 yeah
general 2020-06-24 13:39:17 I actually think I saw a C-130 fly over the Clyde a few weeks ago
general 2020-06-24 13:39:30 I'll try and trace the flight path on a map
general 2020-06-24 13:41:00 yeah that was the flightpath basically
general 2020-06-24 13:41:10 i might try and see where it waas going
general 2020-06-24 13:41:46 yeah actually I think it was just a test flight
general 2020-06-24 13:41:58 there's no airbases in those directions
general 2020-06-24 13:42:13 also it wasnt civilian aircraft cuz it was too big and too close to the ground
general 2020-06-24 13:42:33 best guess is either a Hercules or a Stratofortress/tanker
general 2020-06-24 13:42:58 well yes, but actually no.

general 2020-06-26 10:18:47 ok here it is <@456226577798135808> 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=en1heHDBf3k SCP-??? ~ Mexican Man


prolonged exposure to SCP-??? can lead to turning you into a taco, obsessive love of sombreros and the immediate skill of trumpet-playing
SCP-??? should be stored in a sound-proof box with no contact to the outside world.
If any human contact does occur, the human host should be disposed of immediately.
Infected humans can also spread the music using their trumpet skills, which could be devastating for planet Earth.
If escaped, lethal force should be used against SCP-???

general 2020-07-19 15:26:07 boutta prank them
general 2020-07-19 15:27:40 yes
general 2020-07-19 15:27:51 remember those arcade games
general 2020-07-19 15:27:57 where it would show a preview of the game
general 2020-07-19 15:28:02 and you would pretend ur playing
general 2020-07-19 15:28:06 just to look cool
general 2020-07-19 15:28:28 oh god
general 2020-07-19 15:28:41 not able to unsee

general 2020-07-19 18:00:00 nice
general 2020-07-19 18:00:05 i mean
general 2020-07-19 18:00:15 if you were gonna properly do starlink
general 2020-07-19 18:00:40 yeah
general 2020-07-19 18:01:19 might play sfs later
general 2020-07-19 18:11:44 send up 50 individual rockets all targetted for each sattelite and blow them out of the sky
general 2020-07-19 18:11:54 or 50 rockets
general 2020-07-19 18:11:58 with grabber arms
general 2020-07-19 18:12:01 and deorbit
general 2020-07-19 18:12:23 a reusable rocket that deorbits decommissioned sattelites
general 2020-07-19 18:12:32 SpaceX do your thing
general 2020-07-19 18:12:56 actually seems like a thing they would do
general 2020-07-19 18:13:04 because then recycle the sat's parts
general 2020-07-19 18:13:17 to make new sat's
general 2020-07-19 18:13:53 put boosters on it
general 2020-07-19 18:13:58 and send to Jupiter
general 2020-07-19 18:14:22 turn of atmospheric drag
general 2020-07-19 18:14:27 and infinite fuel on
general 2020-07-19 18:14:51 uhhh
general 2020-07-19 18:15:07 send people to jupiter
general 2020-07-19 18:15:17 send man to Jupiter
general 2020-07-19 18:15:30 wait no
general 2020-07-19 18:15:37 send probes to jupiter and all its moons
general 2020-07-19 18:15:42 1 rocket
general 2020-07-19 18:15:51 but a ton of capsules
general 2020-07-19 18:16:00 all destined to go to different planets
general 2020-07-19 18:16:11 theoretically it would make sense
general 2020-07-19 18:16:24 because instead of wasting 5-6 rockets
general 2020-07-19 18:16:27 you only use 1
general 2020-07-19 18:16:35 irl
general 2020-07-19 18:16:58 Make me CEO of SpaceX
general 2020-07-19 18:17:17 Feels like something Elon would do tho
general 2020-07-19 18:17:44 Have 3 probes in 1 rocket that go to Mars, Phobos and Deimos
general 2020-07-19 18:17:56 man i only have free version
general 2020-07-19 18:18:05 3 sattelites
general 2020-07-19 18:18:15 all destined for Mars and its 2 moons
general 2020-07-19 18:18:29 no
general 2020-07-19 18:18:40 you wait until pressure inside and outside the car are equal
general 2020-07-19 18:18:50 or else you become human pancake
general 2020-07-19 18:18:53 silly bunny
general 2020-07-19 18:19:18 ok so
general 2020-07-19 18:19:24 for the sake of conversation
general 2020-07-19 18:19:30 you are fully submerged
general 2020-07-19 18:19:45 b u n n y
general 2020-07-19 18:20:27 yeah that makes sense
general 2020-07-19 18:20:40 seems like something SpaceX would legitimately do
general 2020-07-19 18:20:55 ah
general 2020-07-19 18:21:03 make fairing bigger
general 2020-07-19 18:21:26 hmmst
general 2020-07-19 18:21:48 do an apollo-style mission to mars
general 2020-07-19 18:22:00 sfs is that game
general 2020-07-19 18:22:26 oh
general 2020-07-19 18:22:32 same
general 2020-07-19 18:22:44 <:pain:644301805534183464>
general 2020-07-19 18:22:52 yes
general 2020-07-19 18:23:08 dont forget to quicksave
general 2020-07-19 18:23:16 makes it easier to send to both moons
general 2020-07-19 18:28:48 no
general 2020-07-19 18:29:22 niceeeee
general 2020-07-20 10:44:49 happy 51 years since apollo landing
general 2020-07-20 10:47:39 i was today years old when i realised it took a fucking long time to get to the moon and back

general 2020-07-29 18:08:00 ik you said simply maths would be better for guns
general 2020-07-29 18:08:12 but imagine just strapping an M4 to one of your AIs
general 2020-07-29 18:08:27 tf is a nematode

general 2020-07-29 18:09:10 you could try beat elon into making first human-like AI
general 2020-07-29 18:10:26 you need to have a self-learning AI and you fight it
general 2020-07-29 18:10:33 or a good fighter fights it

general 2020-07-29 18:14:21 roblox cant transport files out of roblox
general 2020-07-29 18:14:27 so even if it became rampant
general 2020-07-29 18:14:37 it would only stick to 1 small part of the game
general 2020-07-29 18:14:49 bruhhh

general 2020-07-29 18:17:19 but i mean
general 2020-07-29 18:17:58 just dont, whatever you do, do ***NOT*** integrate the AI into a computer virus.
general 2020-07-29 18:18:09 thats how Judgement Day happened
general 2020-07-29 18:19:29 as soon as an AI is in multiple unsecure locations at once, you're kinda screwed if it becomes suicidal.
general 2020-07-29 18:19:45 like what Skynet did in Terminator
general 2020-07-29 18:19:52 basically got itself into a virus
general 2020-07-29 18:20:02 and became a hivemind across multiple devices
general 2020-07-29 18:22:03 I feel like Terminator movies trynna tell us "make AI, but dont make it too powerful"
general 2020-07-29 18:23:28 borderline nsfw shit tho
general 2020-07-29 18:23:32 should've DMed
general 2020-07-29 18:24:27 Neuralink is set to have an AI that thinks like a human close to about 2025
general 2020-07-29 18:24:31 they saying
general 2020-07-29 18:24:42 that if we dont find a way to integrate AI into human brain
general 2020-07-29 18:24:55 they'll basically treat us like pets
general 2020-07-29 18:25:01 then again
general 2020-07-29 18:25:05 an AI
general 2020-07-29 18:25:09 integrated into brain
general 2020-07-29 18:25:15 if the AI becomes suicidal
general 2020-07-29 18:25:19 then
general 2020-07-29 18:25:23 people get hijacked
general 2020-07-29 18:25:29 and shit goes sideways
general 2020-07-29 18:25:33 imagine
general 2020-07-29 18:25:36 hear me out
general 2020-07-29 18:25:44 they implant the AI chips in soldiers
general 2020-07-29 18:25:56 and then some other country hijacks them
general 2020-07-29 18:26:21 military-grade encryption though
general 2020-07-29 18:26:30 basically nothing can crack it
general 2020-07-29 18:26:41 i mean
general 2020-07-29 18:26:45 i feel like
general 2020-07-29 18:26:56 it would be an extension of their brain for soldiers
general 2020-07-29 18:27:14 basically make them think more tactically
general 2020-07-29 18:27:33 optimise decision-making
general 2020-07-29 18:28:11 i mean
general 2020-07-29 18:28:19 imagine you got shot
general 2020-07-29 18:28:22 SHOT
general 2020-07-29 18:28:24 I MEANT SHOT
general 2020-07-29 18:28:41 imagine you got shot
general 2020-07-29 18:28:49 in la tete
general 2020-07-29 18:29:16 the chip, being an extension of your brain, would theoretically keep you alive
general 2020-07-29 18:29:38 anyways, back to soldier stuff
general 2020-07-29 18:30:08 partner those together
general 2020-07-29 18:30:16 basically renders human soldiers obsolete
general 2020-07-29 18:30:43 hey just putting this out here
general 2020-07-29 18:31:03 death sentence illegal
general 2020-07-29 18:31:36 i feel like clone armies are the next thing
general 2020-07-29 18:31:48 genertically-enhanced human clones
general 2020-07-29 18:32:00 with strength and shit
general 2020-07-29 18:32:19 ok can i just say this rq
general 2020-07-29 18:32:34 how tf did terminators even keep skin?
general 2020-07-29 18:32:44 like
general 2020-07-29 18:32:47 to maintain skin
general 2020-07-29 18:32:54 you need to keep nutrients and shit
general 2020-07-29 18:33:02 they didnt eat or sleep
general 2020-07-29 18:33:18 it would just decay after a few months
general 2020-07-29 18:33:24 meh true
general 2020-07-29 18:34:33 bruhhh
general 2020-07-29 18:34:40 we can already clone humans though
general 2020-07-29 18:34:48 so we've cracked genetics basically
general 2020-07-29 18:35:00 its just genetic enhancements
general 2020-07-29 18:37:24 cant you just make something hover with just high-pressure vacuum cleaner?
general 2020-07-29 18:46:30 what happens if you fly into a black hole?
general 2020-07-29 18:46:49 <#384021699466756107> card
general 2020-07-29 18:47:11 oh god your name
general 2020-07-29 18:49:56 wait
general 2020-07-29 18:50:19 couldn't gravitational slingshot from a black hole technically propell you to insane speeds?
general 2020-07-29 18:50:37 if you got close enougj without getting eaten
general 2020-07-29 18:50:53 that would be cool
general 2020-07-29 18:51:11 even though humans would probably get killed by the immense gravity
general 2020-07-29 18:51:32 because the speed of your craft and the gravity would just rip you apart
general 2020-07-29 18:53:09 we need #technical-general
general 2020-07-29 18:53:18 where we talk about science stuff like that
general 2020-07-29 18:53:46 how exactly?
general 2020-07-29 18:53:52 doesnt make sense
general 2020-07-29 18:54:08 its just a shit-ton of mass in one area
general 2020-07-29 18:54:19 dont really see how it can show you the death of everything
general 2020-07-29 18:55:15 i wanna see some sort of crossover between Universe Sandbox and KSP
general 2020-07-29 18:55:26 just to test the extent of astrophysics
general 2020-07-29 18:55:36 anyways
general 2020-07-29 18:55:55 hows the diamondgen terrain obc?
general 2020-07-29 18:56:05 ah.
general 2020-07-29 18:56:37 bruh so
general 2020-07-29 18:56:49 a gravitational slingshot from a black hole
general 2020-07-29 18:56:57 would take billions of years
general 2020-07-29 18:59:07 so basically
general 2020-07-29 18:59:30 you could attempt a gravitational manoeuvre from a black hole
general 2020-07-29 18:59:34 but if you got trapped
general 2020-07-29 18:59:43 you would only be set free after it exploded
general 2020-07-29 18:59:50 which would destroy you
general 2020-07-29 18:59:57 calm down patricia
general 2020-07-30 16:12:05 guys
general 2020-07-30 16:12:09 does anyone have alexa
general 2020-07-30 16:12:13 if so
general 2020-07-30 16:12:16 tell her
general 2020-07-30 16:12:31 up up down down left right left right B A start
general 2020-07-30 16:13:20 konami code poggers
general 2020-07-30 18:37:57 bruhhhh
general 2020-07-30 18:38:09 "i didnt know homophobia was against the rules"
general 2020-07-30 18:38:12 thats just-
general 2020-07-30 18:38:15 bruhhhhhh
general 2020-07-30 18:39:36 politicsn't
general 2020-07-31 11:26:08 wait
general 2020-07-31 11:26:12 a fucking minute
general 2020-07-31 11:26:17 we can debunk flat earth
general 2020-07-31 11:26:20 with pearl harbour
general 2020-07-31 11:26:23 look
general 2020-07-31 11:26:45 here is earth
general 2020-07-31 11:26:56 im guessing you all know basic geography
general 2020-07-31 11:28:43 nice but look at this
general 2020-07-31 11:29:44 the japs would have probably taken the red route, because of how efficient it was. in the unlikely event they did take the yellow route, they would be burning thousands of gallons of fuel, and would have taken days.
general 2020-07-31 11:30:03 i may have just debunked flat earth
general 2020-07-31 11:32:20 im actually gonna trace the flight path they would have taken if the earth was flat
general 2020-07-31 11:32:30 and see when they would have gotten shot down
general 2020-07-31 11:33:54 ok nice
general 2020-07-31 11:34:01 they were deployed from carriers
general 2020-07-31 11:34:08 so that makes shooting them down easier
general 2020-07-31 11:34:54 aight so
general 2020-07-31 11:36:59 aight fuck it cant be arsed to do any more
general 2020-07-31 12:18:02 hey dont worry
general 2020-07-31 12:18:21 it took me like 3 years to tell the difference between a Spitfire and a Hurricane
general 2020-07-31 12:19:57 i literally stared at this poster for years figuring out which was which
general 2020-07-31 12:20:16 yes i had a spitfire poster
general 2020-07-31 12:20:25 holy shit

general 2020-08-04 12:56:41 i feel like we should do a mass thing where we have to DM staff with proof of age, they dont say anything about 13+ to catch out undes, and anyone who doesnt supply proof (unless they're known to be inactive) gets banned or muted. Basically instantly clears out undes.
general 2020-08-04 12:57:18 also if we wanna be extra-sneaky we could say that we are trying to figure out what kinda age groups the server is made of

general 2020-09-11 17:25:53 because they treated it like it was life or death

general 2020-09-11 17:38:42 but still
general 2020-09-11 17:38:47 kinda borderline
general 2020-09-11 17:39:09 bruhhh i never said that
general 2020-09-11 17:39:22 your pfp goes against the rules, whether its in respect or not
general 2020-09-11 17:39:39 thousands of people died on that day, it could still bring about some sad memories
general 2020-09-11 17:39:52 its better to change it than keep it
general 2020-09-11 17:39:58 yeah
general 2020-09-11 17:40:09 also its literally a picture of the building exploding
general 2020-09-11 17:40:14 yeah thats better
general 2020-09-11 17:40:30 its better to just be a normal picture about said plane crash than the actual event
general 2020-09-11 17:40:59 We aren't ignoring it.
general 2020-09-11 17:41:33 Thousands of people die, we get that. But the pfp still goes against the rules that the admins have set out. We can't just forget about those rules for 1 day.
general 2020-09-11 17:42:11 he had a pfp of the actual crash
general 2020-09-11 17:42:34 <@!435946988559925248> his pfp was of the actual crash, he only changed it a few minutes ago

general 2020-09-11 18:01:30 he's telling us to stop talking about politics and that he was affected by the topic, but he kept talking about it

general 2020-09-11 18:03:28 he's literally trying to get a reaction out of people at this point

general 2020-09-11 18:10:49 he made out that him spending 2 weeks in a mental asylum was worse than jay spending 2 days
general 2020-09-11 18:10:59 and i highly doubt he was even in a mental asylum
general 2020-09-11 18:11:39 yeah
general 2020-09-11 18:11:49 whenever ive seen him he's been starting an argument

general 2020-09-16 17:43:32 but atleast make it good
general 2020-09-16 17:43:55 how is it a real build
general 2020-09-16 17:43:58 its a gun mag
general 2020-09-16 17:44:09 its not a "build" per se
general 2020-09-16 17:44:12 wait what
general 2020-09-16 17:44:15 shit wrong thing then
general 2020-09-16 17:45:17 your bullet mag
general 2020-09-16 17:45:20 there is no boat
general 2020-09-16 17:45:39 
general 2020-09-16 17:45:45 why tf did you say boat
general 2020-09-16 17:46:13 what boat
general 2020-09-16 17:46:16 there is no boat
general 2020-09-16 17:46:38 its low quality aesthetics-wise
general 2020-09-16 17:46:44 could've given it paint
general 2020-09-16 17:46:49 and some details
general 2020-09-16 17:47:17 well if you want it to get upvoted
general 2020-09-16 17:47:22 it needs to look shiny
general 2020-09-16 17:47:29 or else people will just scroll past
general 2020-09-16 17:47:40 wtf were you begging for upvotes then?
general 2020-09-16 17:47:58 
general 2020-09-16 17:48:16 if you dont remember then why the fuck did you beg
general 2020-09-16 17:48:24 if you dont remember then it wasnt importnat
general 2020-09-16 17:48:30 so what was the point in begging
general 2020-09-16 17:49:21 
general 2020-09-16 17:49:23 it wasnt even that long ago
general 2020-09-16 17:49:29 about a week or 2 ago
general 2020-09-16 17:49:38 how
general 2020-09-16 17:50:02 
general 2020-09-16 17:50:26 yes day month year
general 2020-09-16 17:50:30 superior
general 2020-09-16 17:50:37 rather than month day year
general 2020-09-16 17:50:48 month day year is completely illogical
general 2020-09-16 17:50:58 you should do it in order from smallest unit of time to largest
general 2020-09-16 17:52:21 
general 2020-09-16 17:52:28 explain <@!587393222855229457>
general 2020-09-16 17:52:38 no
general 2020-09-16 17:52:57 dd/mm/yy is used everywhere in the world except from USA
general 2020-09-16 17:53:14 and you specifically said
> yeah but then your logic doesnt match with the rest of the world
general 2020-09-16 17:53:23 when it does
general 2020-09-16 17:53:37 you gotta back up your claims with evidence man
general 2020-09-16 17:53:55 like you cant just say "madattak is my wife" without showing the marriage papers
general 2020-09-16 17:54:15 <#495286269459300364> moment
general 2020-09-16 17:54:41 **your
general 2020-09-16 17:55:13 brain tumour time <:PogU:670373666164572172>
general 2020-09-16 17:55:24 also magine calling crisps chips
general 2020-09-16 17:55:30 its a meme
general 2020-09-16 17:55:40 wasnt directed at you mate
general 2020-09-16 17:56:03 nobody
general 2020-09-16 17:57:50 or give the A-10 decent engines
general 2020-09-16 17:58:01 not shitty commercial jet engines
general 2020-09-16 17:58:31 i mean
general 2020-09-16 17:58:54 with the kind of advanced anti air defenses, that thing would be shot down like a clay pigeon
general 2020-09-16 17:59:11 the bullets would store their momentum
general 2020-09-16 18:00:04 tbh i find the A-10 better as a heavy bomber rather than ground support ship
general 2020-09-16 18:00:20 also it being ground support makes their use in Terminator Salvation completely illogical
general 2020-09-16 18:00:46 in TS they literally used it as air to air to shoot down Hunter-Killers
general 2020-09-16 18:00:52 yes it had a boss gun
general 2020-09-16 18:01:04 but it's still pretty shit for air targets
general 2020-09-16 18:01:24 lemme search up Hunter-Killer top speed rq
general 2020-09-16 18:04:08 i mean with it's speed and agility, it's not good for air to air or dodging modern anti air defenses, such as rockets, etc etc
general 2020-09-16 18:04:14 it fits better as a bomber imo
general 2020-09-16 18:04:47 if you were to chuck the a-10 in afghanistan right now, I bet talibs could shoot it down
general 2020-09-16 18:05:13 zumwalt seems to be a waste of money
general 2020-09-16 18:06:08 they literally made a stealth ship that is worse than the Type 45
general 2020-09-16 18:06:20 which is one of the most advanced ships in the world
general 2020-09-16 18:06:44 why not remote control missile carriers
general 2020-09-16 18:07:48 slap a computer on an arleigh burke and send it into the gulf to help cargo ships get through without the iranians stealing them, and it means that if the ship is attacked and sunk no lives are lost. simple.
general 2020-09-16 18:08:52 kilometer long boat when
general 2020-09-16 18:09:09 wait how much is 1 meter in plane crazy again
general 2020-09-16 18:09:11 yes
general 2020-09-16 18:09:16 seawise oil tanker
general 2020-09-16 18:09:25 ok
general 2020-09-16 18:09:38 just make  a thousand block long boat
general 2020-09-16 18:13:30 railguns are still experimental
general 2020-09-16 18:13:55 also how the fuck are they supposed to have turning, they're not self-propelled
general 2020-09-16 18:14:16 its basically like complaining that tanks are useless because their rounds dont turn
general 2020-09-16 18:15:41 a railgun is basically just a magnetic tank cannon
general 2020-09-16 18:15:55 fires the same rounds (i believe) except at supersonic speeds
general 2020-09-16 18:16:22 500km
general 2020-09-16 18:16:28 lets see
general 2020-09-16 18:18:37 500 kilometers is from Empire State to fucking R I C H M O N D
general 2020-09-16 18:19:08 thats really fucking impractical
general 2020-09-16 18:19:25 first of all are we talking it gets shot out the railgun and no rocket activation?
general 2020-09-16 18:19:38 ok lets see
general 2020-09-16 18:20:26 so lets say we were shooting a minuteman 3 from this proposed railgun launcher
general 2020-09-16 18:20:28 
general 2020-09-16 18:20:41 just about 80,000 lbs
general 2020-09-16 18:20:51 apart from the missile exploding, yes
general 2020-09-16 18:21:03 can someone figure out the maths for how much force you would need
general 2020-09-16 18:21:27 WAHT
general 2020-09-16 18:21:32 MINUTEMAN ISNT ANTI SHIP
general 2020-09-16 18:21:36 ITS FUCKING NUCLEAR
general 2020-09-16 18:21:48 ITS MEANT TO DESTROY NORTH KOREA
general 2020-09-16 18:21:51 NOT A FUCKING SHIP
general 2020-09-16 18:22:08 wait
general 2020-09-16 18:22:19 railguns could theoretically launch planes
general 2020-09-16 18:22:34 who needs catapults when you can have magnetic catapults?
general 2020-09-16 18:22:55 WE WERENT
general 2020-09-16 18:23:01 nice
general 2020-09-16 18:23:06 but yeah
general 2020-09-16 18:23:20 why the fuck would you use a minuteman against a su-47
general 2020-09-16 18:23:26 a waste of missile
general 2020-09-16 18:23:33 its fucking nuclear
general 2020-09-16 18:23:54 the whole reasons railguns exist is to advance ground and sea combat
general 2020-09-16 18:24:04 you absolute fucking microbiological form
general 2020-09-16 18:28:56 ok so i did the maths
general 2020-09-16 18:29:04 escape velocity is 11km/s
general 2020-09-16 18:29:28 to reach that speed with railguns
general 2020-09-16 18:29:38 you would need the power of 4 railguns
general 2020-09-16 18:29:42 in 1 giant railgun
general 2020-09-16 18:29:57 and then you need to factor in the mass of the missile
general 2020-09-16 18:32:23 ***aircraft carriers will only become obsolete when aircraft are electric-powered, giving it infinite range. the whole reason carriers exist is to deploy planes in certain locations without the need for air to air refuelling or landing every once in a while. once the need for refuelling is gone, thats when aircraft carriers will server no purpose whatsoever***
highlighted that so people actually read it because its eye-catching
general 2020-09-16 18:33:28 **we have concept electric aircraft, but there is no actually viable electric engine that provides thrust on-par to modern fighter aircraft.**
general 2020-09-16 18:34:13 **until Elon Musk makes the Musk Electric Jet and flies it for the first time, we have no viable electric engine for aircraft that would be actually decent**
general 2020-09-16 18:34:59 yes
general 2020-09-16 18:35:21 <@!271299269984518155> you ever done an unde search on troll? if not, nows the time.
general 2020-09-16 18:36:29 **he's basing his whole argument off of a poorly photoshopped photo depicting a bunch of obsolete missiles blowing a carrier to high heaven. those missiles can just take down a plane, nevermind a highly-armoured boat**
general 2020-09-16 18:38:09 omg im losing fucking braincells
general 2020-09-16 18:38:20 nuclear reactors dont cost tonnes of money
general 2020-09-16 18:38:32 they're mor eefficient than normal generators
general 2020-09-16 18:38:47 mate
general 2020-09-16 18:39:34 <@!454809803223465984> carriers literally exist to extend the range of planes. you dont launch a plane from an airfield in america to a target thats hundreds of thousands of miles away, thats just a waste of fuel
general 2020-09-16 18:40:15 <@!271299269984518155> i think its 10 second slowmode time
general 2020-09-16 18:40:34 ***DMS PEOPLE

general 2020-09-17 17:58:04 bruh
general 2020-09-17 17:58:10 he literally
general 2020-09-17 17:58:12 said
general 2020-09-17 17:58:17 "if you want some designs"
general 2020-09-17 17:58:21 then deleted it
general 2020-09-17 17:58:31 even though it'll show up in mee6 logs
general 2020-09-17 17:59:24 tsar is really fucking overpowered
general 2020-09-17 17:59:47 > <@!328023271721271296> it was never used dumbass
<@!670939038999511041> it was for 1 test but only at a fraction of it's power
general 2020-09-17 18:00:27 if you tsar'd at full capacity bomb you would essentially explode the entire US and decimate the rest of the world for years to come
general 2020-09-17 18:01:20 damn thats not even that big tbh
general 2020-09-17 18:02:00 tbh you would be better just putting uranium in the actual plane that delivered it
general 2020-09-17 18:02:03 more destructive
general 2020-09-17 18:02:24 but no pilots
general 2020-09-17 18:02:49 > Unless they flew in a hazmat suit,
<@!328023271721271296> did you actually just fucking say that
general 2020-09-17 18:02:50 .
general 2020-09-17 18:02:58 what are you on mate
general 2020-09-17 18:03:20 tsar bomba was 60s-70s yeah
general 2020-09-17 18:03:31 actually yeah precisely 61
general 2020-09-17 18:03:54 because the nuclear arms treaty that was signed a few months after tsar test was when kennedy was in office so yeah
general 2020-09-17 18:06:26 what the fuck did you just say

plane-crazy 2020-09-18 18:21:32 i was on snapchat for a laugh
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 18:21:37 and i was watching a thing
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 18:21:54 turns out they found signs of life on ***fucking VENUS***
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 18:22:04 ***V E N U S***
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 18:23:20 ik
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 18:23:25 it was on like
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 18:23:34 wait what is friday - 3
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 18:23:41 brain is poopoo

plane-crazy 2020-09-18 18:24:06 anyways <#497142796961054721> time
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 18:24:13 just realised im in plane crazy
general 2020-09-18 18:24:54 you guys think theres a genuine chance they're right about Venus?
general 2020-09-18 18:25:21 i mean if there's life it'll change our life tbh
general 2020-09-18 18:25:27 screw mars missions
general 2020-09-18 18:25:31 oh
general 2020-09-18 18:26:02 well hey at least it's life
general 2020-09-18 18:26:09 i mean
general 2020-09-18 18:26:16 if we safely transport them to earth
general 2020-09-18 18:26:29 i mean
general 2020-09-18 18:26:33 if there is life
general 2020-09-18 18:26:44 it could change our perception of how life works
general 2020-09-18 18:26:51 it could be a massive breakthrough
general 2020-09-18 18:27:36 seeing how life works on other planets could be a substantial breakthrough in our understanding of science
general 2020-09-18 18:27:43 exactly
general 2020-09-18 18:27:53 life could exist in any way possible
general 2020-09-18 18:27:58 and we dont understand it
general 2020-09-18 18:28:01 wait
general 2020-09-18 18:28:11 if they are single-celled
general 2020-09-18 18:28:19 and they survive on Venus
general 2020-09-18 18:28:26 > So friend, the day has come when you are shifting to your own house. Just let me know if you need any help from me. Till then, congratulations for this new blessing.
<@!287459677611098114> stfu
general 2020-09-18 18:30:05 if the life is on Venus, that means that we could potentially study their biological make-up and find out how life works in more detail
general 2020-09-18 18:30:23 and since genetic modifications are in their baby steps
general 2020-09-18 18:30:40 this means we could genetically engineer humans to live on more inhospitable planets
general 2020-09-18 18:30:54 which is a big-ass potential breakthrough if you ask me
general 2020-09-18 18:31:01 i mean
general 2020-09-18 18:31:10 apart from it being hot as fuck
general 2020-09-18 18:31:30 (kinda like me ü•µ)

general 2020-09-22 17:09:32 wait should i try and make among us in Scratch
general 2020-09-22 17:09:48 my knowledge of scratch coding is pretty basic but i think i could do it
general 2020-09-22 17:10:06 true
general 2020-09-22 17:10:12 that is a barrier
general 2020-09-22 17:10:13 wait
general 2020-09-22 17:10:21 AI characters
general 2020-09-22 17:10:22 yes
general 2020-09-22 17:10:26 thats my plan
general 2020-09-22 17:10:35 because i know how to do walking animations and stuff
general 2020-09-22 17:10:43 just next costume go brrrrrr
general 2020-09-22 17:11:23 im bored so i might actually try and make it
general 2020-09-22 17:14:32 yo leon my g
general 2020-09-22 17:14:42 have you got the animations for the crew
general 2020-09-22 17:14:49 because i need them to import
general 2020-09-22 17:14:52 into scratch
general 2020-09-22 17:14:55 for animation
general 2020-09-22 17:15:28 <@!435864400235200522> send frames for walking anim in dms pls
general 2020-09-22 17:22:37 my boy hovers across the play area now
general 2020-09-22 17:22:53 wait should i stream this in vc for a laugh
general 2020-09-22 17:23:02 just so you can watch me suffer
general 2020-09-22 17:24:20 i have cringe starting rn
general 2020-09-22 17:24:32 i just need to get animations done
general 2020-09-22 17:24:43 which will hopefully take me 5 minutes
general 2020-09-22 17:25:30 walking animation looks cringe atm
general 2020-09-22 17:25:50 im in the hangar
general 2020-09-22 17:26:07 pyro stfu
general 2020-09-22 17:26:36 pyro is just in vc saying "SUB2HADES"
general 2020-09-22 17:28:26 what the fuck is this anim
general 2020-09-22 17:29:49 what the fuck have i created
general 2020-09-22 17:30:25 imagine having school rn
general 2020-09-22 17:34:35 fuck it no motivation
general 2020-09-22 17:35:29 im trying to do the big decent walking animation
general 2020-09-22 17:35:42 but the way scratch works is really fucking poor for fluid animations
general 2020-09-22 17:36:16 its the only programming i can wrap my head around
general 2020-09-22 17:36:21 yes
general 2020-09-22 17:36:43 the thing that pisses me off is the amount of dumb techniques you have to use to get a fluid walking animation
general 2020-09-22 17:37:41 the only way i could get a decent walking for opposite directions is to flip every single costume for walking left
general 2020-09-22 17:37:52 and i cant be arsed to do that
general 2020-09-22 17:38:48 there was a flip function but they've removed that since Scratch 3 was released
general 2020-09-22 17:39:10 at least i think so
general 2020-09-22 17:39:20 they removed a bunch of blocks when transitioning to SB2
general 2020-09-22 17:39:47 which i believe made most ancient games unplayable
general 2020-09-22 17:39:56 the users would have to go back and rebuild the code
general 2020-09-22 17:40:38 ahhhh the days
general 2020-09-23 17:50:34 i finally downloaded Among Us
general 2020-09-23 17:50:40 but I have no idea how to play
general 2020-09-25 18:30:32 may seem a bit out of the blue, but does anyone have access to the PTFS discord and/or knows what the new update is?
general 2020-09-25 18:31:14 i got myself banned on the PTFS discord a few months ago cuz i was bored with the server and was ditching PTFS, but now i need it back
general 2020-09-25 18:31:20 <@!195253906333368320> hey dad

general 2020-09-25 19:36:40 but i clipped the edge of the carrier
general 2020-09-25 19:36:50 and the plane plummeted into the ocean
general 2020-09-25 19:36:52 no
general 2020-09-25 19:36:58 small planes are for losers
general 2020-09-25 19:38:03 but this is PTFS

creations-chat 2021-03-05 14:17:54 <@!348731819350294528> I have one thing to say about your creation.

**~~ POWER ~~SPEED!!! UNLIMITED ~~ POWER ~~ SPEED!!!!!!!**
creations-chat 2021-03-05 14:22:37 yes congratulations. all jokes aside, i like the concept of your vehicle, just maybe if you tried adding a bit more detail to it it would be better, for example if you tried smoothing out the curves and getting rid of the flat surface **here**, it might be a bit better
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/730752520942649448/817401527366844446/unknown.png?width=772&height=406
(edit - look ma! im using <#504436696021204992> for it's intended purpose!)
creations-chat 2021-03-05 14:25:18 if you added the wedges to the nose to make it more aerodynamic, you could probably cut down on the cheese wings
(PS - we should probably take this to <#384021699466756107> lmao)
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 14:27:17 <@!680035569023451146> we should probably talk here lmao
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 14:27:29 no slowmode <:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 14:27:34 but anyways
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 14:27:43 aerodynamics is actually a pain in the ass
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 14:28:13 even a slightly exposed flat surface facing windward will mess up your flight
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 14:28:35 does it kinda flail around in flight like a floppy banana?
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 14:28:39 like wiggling up and down
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 14:28:49 oh damn
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 14:29:17 usually with some of the flat windward surfaces it would turn into whacky inflatable arm flailing tube man
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 14:29:21 but it seems not
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 14:30:17 nice
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 14:30:18 but yeah
plane-crazy 2021-03-05 14:30:46 maybe just touch up some of the wedges (maybe use motors) and add some more detail to it and it'll be good

general 2021-03-08 12:16:50 actually
general 2021-03-08 12:17:02 from what i've heard from my teacher who used to work in customs for a while

general 2021-03-08 12:17:29 so if i wanted to get a scottish flag into the US
general 2021-03-08 12:17:40 without the people at the airport thinking im a smuggler
general 2021-03-08 12:17:46 i would have to mail it to the hotel
general 2021-03-08 12:17:52 and pick it up when i got there
general 2021-03-08 12:18:05 can you even buy a scottish flag in america
general 2021-03-08 12:18:33 no but customs could think it's laced with bad shit

general 2021-03-18 14:36:13 69420 kilometers
general 2021-03-18 14:36:17 ok
general 2021-03-18 14:36:18 so
general 2021-03-18 14:37:23 ok so
general 2021-03-18 14:37:48 Diameter = Circumference / Pi
general 2021-03-18 14:37:59 so if we have a circumference of 69420km
general 2021-03-18 14:38:31 lets just round pi to 3.141 for the sake of simplicity
general 2021-03-18 14:39:10 that means obc's mother has an rough diameter of 22,101.242km
general 2021-03-18 14:40:56 that means her diameter is nearly 3 times larger than Africa

general 2021-03-29 08:54:52 Youtube is showing the entire timeline in the yellow Advert colour
general 2021-03-29 08:55:06 I finished the video anyways

general 2021-03-29 09:30:37 dunno
general 2021-03-29 09:30:43 people must just be fuckin dumb
general 2021-03-29 09:30:53 also there's like
general 2021-03-29 09:31:02 a small amount of people who actually play on mobile
general 2021-03-29 09:31:12 because mobile devices are really fuckin low-end
general 2021-03-29 09:31:41 i tried to run plane crazy at 1 graphics on my phone once and it fuckin broke
general 2021-03-29 09:32:19 wh

general 2021-03-29 09:33:25 what
general 2021-03-29 09:33:40 i still don't understand why grown adults play a kids game

general 2021-03-29 09:47:48 because in games nitrous turns exhaust pipe into rocket engine
general 2021-03-29 09:47:58 because physic no
general 2021-03-29 09:48:10 yeah
general 2021-03-29 09:48:18 anyways that wouldn't even work
general 2021-03-29 09:48:23 because exhaust pipes would like
general 2021-03-29 09:48:25 melt
general 2021-03-29 09:48:34 and also it's not got a nozzle
general 2021-03-29 09:48:51 and some cars only have 1 exhaust pipe
general 2021-03-29 09:49:07 so it would have an off-balance centre of thrust
general 2021-03-29 09:49:29 yes
general 2021-03-29 09:50:25 unless you put it at an angle
general 2021-03-29 09:50:52 because if you face it towards the centre of mass or something it should balance it out I believe
general 2021-03-29 09:50:55 which is like
general 2021-03-29 09:51:03 the whole reason the shuttle stayed straight
general 2021-03-29 09:51:51 2 new racists
general 2021-03-29 13:02:29 because it's actually good
general 2021-03-29 13:02:39 for something that's close to scale it's really fucking good
general 2021-03-29 13:03:00 with only a tad amount of motorlock it actually makes it even better
general 2021-03-29 13:05:10 why not 2 warns?

general 2021-09-20 19:15:26 na crea ill do it
general 2021-09-20 19:15:35 dont worry im gonna leave soon probably
general 2021-09-20 19:16:13 discord doesn't allow you to set your name as everyone
general 2021-09-21 16:12:20 hey guys
general 2021-09-21 16:12:43 it's the 21st night of september <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-09-21 16:13:09 haha poob
general 2021-09-21 16:13:31 pov you play piggy unironically
general 2021-09-21 16:44:33 what if you made a conventional jet / ramjet / scramjet hybrid plane
general 2021-09-21 16:45:28 what
general 2021-09-21 16:46:06 why is manchester irradiated
general 2021-09-21 16:47:23 its in ingerlan
general 2021-09-22 17:15:55 greetings
general 2021-09-22 17:17:42 why is there 25,000 people here yet only 9000 have agreed to the rules
general 2021-09-22 17:18:49 plot twist the other 16,000 people are just bot accounts
general 2021-09-22 17:20:07 was it the thing or iron cross
general 2021-09-22 17:20:30 usually substituting the thing for the iron cross is the best idea
general 2021-09-22 17:20:56 since Luftwaffe still use the iron cross (?)
general 2021-09-22 17:22:31 honestly i have a hunch that PC2 will end up like the roblox version of cyberpunk
general 2021-09-22 17:23:35 honestly if you were to do that you would be better to just get someone to code a target locking function
general 2021-09-22 17:24:41 go use it in <#384027830192832513>
general 2021-09-22 17:25:50 same
general 2021-09-22 17:26:07 welcome back to the fucking thunderdome
general 2021-09-22 17:28:12 its because water physics are dogshit in roblox
general 2021-09-22 17:29:08 since the only way you can map buoyancy is by mapping each block (and not actual water displacement) you can survive an entire destroyer on a few blocks
general 2021-09-22 17:31:03 we need some sort of fucking sensors in PC2
general 2021-09-22 17:31:21 realistic nabal battles with realistic sinking
general 2021-09-22 17:31:35 rig sensor to ballast tank
general 2021-09-22 17:31:41 ballast tank slowly sinks
general 2021-09-22 17:31:46 boat slowly sinks
general 2021-09-22 17:32:15 too in-depth for a roblos game ngl
general 2021-09-22 17:32:54 i mean as much as we hate spammy undes who swarm servers with shredders, they form an integral part of the game monetary-wise
general 2021-09-22 17:33:22 so having a game that makes kids rage quit over not knowing how to shoot people drive down the stonks
general 2021-09-22 17:33:28 i mean look at adopt me
general 2021-09-22 17:33:46 pretty simple game, easy for kids to pick up
general 2021-09-22 17:34:37 but shit like, for example, PC2 had shit tons of in-depth customisables, it would make the game less popular with kids, therefore profits go üìâüìâüìâ
general 2021-09-22 17:36:17 thats not how it fucking works
general 2021-09-22 17:36:38 kids don't simply "learn" like that bro
general 2021-09-22 17:36:55 do you not remember the attention span you had as a 7 year old?

plane-crazy 2021-10-15 11:59:26 well I was playing KSP a while back and i decided to see if i could use an unpowered motor to dampen the torque effects
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 11:59:54 and either the game was glitchy or it actually worked
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 12:00:16 so i wanna see if the same idea applied in Plane Crazy will give similar results?
