creations-chat 2022-05-23 17:48:12 but "i built a block" has over 700 votes
creations-chat 2022-05-23 19:47:57 no one in this server gives any advice without saying something condescending first
creations-chat 2022-05-23 19:56:31 <@822911577849462834> i think the canopy angle should be more acute
creations-chat 2022-05-23 20:00:15 i genuinely think that u should use a more blocky canopy for the eurofighter unless youre gonna do a smokepipe canopy
cylinder canopies arent that good tbh, ik its ironic that im saying this
creations-chat 2022-05-23 20:07:50 facts bro, used it once never doing it again

whats your point? im unoriginal because i tried to remake a real plane?

creations-chat 2022-05-23 22:38:33 <@651361636657135617> it's hard to avoid convergence, there arent really that many ways to go about building planes in this game, especially at higher levels
its like there is an objectively best way to build something
creations-chat 2022-05-23 22:49:36 <@456226577798135808> it does go up a lil...

creations-chat 2022-05-23 23:16:03 ~200, i think its criticism on the build itself i looked at it just now
creations-chat 2022-05-23 23:21:21 <@456226577798135808> im starting to understand why ppl downvote your f117
its mostly because of how messy the side is

creations-chat 2022-05-23 23:48:33 fair
help 2022-05-24 00:42:15 a source from 2012 said a stud is .28 meters
a block is 2.5 studs, so .7 block per meter
but i wouldnt use that
help 2022-05-24 00:43:22 a roblox character is very close to 2 blocks tall
so it's more like .8 to .9 blocks per meter
help 2022-05-24 00:49:58 dont stress over it, theres a huge learning curve
help 2022-05-24 00:50:12 ppl dont just become good at building overnight

help 2022-05-24 00:58:59 u think whatever yall are saying will help <@729396282493501504> become a better builder?
help 2022-05-24 01:29:16 the root of the problem is that the wing and leading edge extension arent swept back enough
help 2022-05-24 01:30:11 other wise you'd be able to put the elevators farther back and still line up properly with the wing's trailing edge
help 2022-05-24 01:32:32 f14 max sweep in flight is 68 degrees, compared to your ~63.4 degrees (assuming that you used the 1x2 delta wing for the LERX)
help 2022-05-24 01:39:25 not the wing, the lerx
help 2022-05-24 01:39:39 wait your wing doesnt even line up with the lerx
help 2022-05-24 01:39:46 leading edge extension
help 2022-05-24 01:40:03 the wing looking thing in front of the wing

help 2022-05-24 01:40:58 yeah but the entirety of it
help 2022-05-24 01:41:08 that goes all the way to the front of the intake
help 2022-05-24 01:42:23 
help 2022-05-24 01:44:05 wing sweep is really hard to manage on a small f14

creations-chat 2022-05-28 02:33:27 no actually the j-10 is more original than the jf17
allegedly they stole f16 blueprints for developing the jf17 and im inclined to believe it's true
creations-chat 2022-05-28 02:40:43 the aerodynamic configuration of the j-10 is still very different from the eurofighter (<@389516889501728779> and also the lavi id argue) considering the different distance between the canards and wings
it's hard to actually "copy" an entire airframe and still make many noticeable differences, and also because those differences require changes in electronics and flight control systems, and the j-10b and c have very advanced electronics compared to early f16 and the lavi (the lavi was from the 70s or 80s so it definitely had obsolete electronics)
the true copies as for china would be the j-11 (and other flankers) and the migs (j-7, j-6, j-5, and j-4 bla blah bla)
creations-chat 2022-05-28 02:43:02 no one does, i think china gets a lot of shit because their military power has only risen recently, and we're just not used to its presence in the world stage
creations-chat 2022-05-28 02:48:32 f22, f18, su27, f15 they all have the conventional wing configuration with large main wings, and horizontal and vertical stabilizers in the rear, it's all the same configuration none of it is new in aerodynamics, only small improvements nothing revolutionary
eurofighter and rafale are both delta wings with canards
mirage series <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2022-05-28 02:52:16 <@389516889501728779> all modern fighters base much of their aerodynamic designs on previously existing aircraft, it's undisputed
but i did realize that "originality" is subjective so im not gonna continue to debate -

"all fighters are copies of each other because they all share some similarities" is stupid, and it's also wrong to say that any plane (even the wright brothers') were entirely original,
nothing about this is objective
creations-chat 2022-05-28 02:56:16 i never said theyre all the same, i said they have similar aerodynamic configurations
creations-chat 2022-05-28 03:00:09 never denied that each have their own innovations, but it's certain that they share more similarities than differences
creations-chat 2022-05-28 03:02:10 <@389516889501728779> before u finish typing
let's just stop, this is all subjective there's no end to this logically
dang it didnt get the timing
creations-chat 2022-05-28 03:05:32 "ur opinion is incorrect"
is this an oxymoron
creations-chat 2022-05-29 21:27:03 why would you even bother to say such a thing, it helps no one
plus look at your own builds 🗿
creations-chat 2022-05-29 21:31:05 this is not "ok," it's this kind of attitude that makes this community so shit
creations-chat 2022-05-29 21:54:44 it probably has almost no wing panels

plane-crazy 2022-05-29 22:44:48 but in comparison to the width of the elevators
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 22:44:57 how it is currently is the closest

plane-crazy 2022-05-29 22:48:29 that
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 22:48:37 since the trail is only 1 block long
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 22:48:50 it does span the entirety of the sloped side of the half wedge
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 22:48:56 so i had to add piston for that
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 22:49:07 but no pistons needed for angle to line up
plane-crazy 2022-05-29 22:49:18 theres no overlay

creations-chat 2022-05-31 15:32:18 how tf does this have so many upvotes its actually terrible
WHY IS COOLDOWN 10 MINUTES
creations-chat 2022-05-31 17:10:24 nah dude wtf is that canopy also the the intake with nacelles design is so incredibly unrealistic, it's literally parallel to the fuselage starting from intakes to exhaust, tiny vertical stabilzer (would probably flat spin more than the f14a if this was real) and the front is so bulky, more so than the f4
creations-chat 2022-05-31 17:12:51 yeah but those dont have 250+ upvotes
creations-chat 2022-05-31 17:15:40 not by a huge margin, imo its nowhere close to boxne's level
a bit better than the mirage milan (i think it deserves around 100 to 150 upvotes)
<@866848584888877077> that's not the expectation, but at least make realistic design choices such as a narrowing nacelle like on the f106 and more realistic proportions regarding wing area and the rest of the plane
creations-chat 2022-05-31 17:18:11 i meant yours should be 100-150
im talking about your build combared to boxne's (i was referring to boxne's ah-1)

plane-crazy 2022-06-05 03:35:38 u tried every plausible combination of wedges and wings??
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 03:35:47 i think it should work...
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 03:35:55 i dont see how it wouldnt
plane-crazy 2022-06-05 03:38:43 its probably better to base the length on the width instead

plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:57:51 what else am i supposed to say
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:58:03 write an entire paragraph like hars?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 02:58:33 dude if i listed the things that are way too inaccurate i would exceed the 2000 characters limit

plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:00:08 <@883063424614006878> the thing that tipped me off is that you accused me of being one of those 1 block wide nose builders who call themselves "roscalers"
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:00:17 that is like an ultimate insult to me
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:01:00 you called me bozo first lo
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:02:18 okay??
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:02:20 is that a big deal?
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:02:34 just saying i actually quit
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:02:47 im not gonna try making another build in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:02:59 like i dont see how
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:03:17 to me theres just no merit in me discouraging you (how it even matters)
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:04:31 <@883063424614006878> a genuine advice that i think is very underrated, slow down the building pace
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:06:12 i cant put in much effort into helping ppl build specific things, but i will tell you that you should measure the angles, and compare
after making a small section of the plane, you should measure the blueprint (use trig if you have to) and make sure everything is on point <@883063424614006878>
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:07:00 imo no1 thing u need to change is the delta 1x2 wings
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:07:13 i custom angled it
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:07:35 the f14 lerx and wing sweep is exactly 68 degrees
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:07:53 use trig
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:07:58 arctangent
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:08:38 <@883063424614006878> im telling you, i used trig, if you do the math, you will know exactly where to place the motor and how long the angled piece should be
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:08:57 i used motor
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:09:03 bro wha
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:09:14 on g
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:10:04 have u taken geometry
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:10:09 genuine question
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:10:10 not insult
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:11:29 <@883063424614006878> you get perfect 68 degree angle if the motor is placed at the wright distance away from the center of the fuselage and the angled piece extends to the correct distance on the intake
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:11:42 BRO
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:11:44 ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:11:48 no thats dumb
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:12:26 measure the blueprint, use a calculator, do some dimensional analysis
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:12:39 bro this is genuine advice
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:12:42 thats how i did it
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:12:54 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:13:11 how does joining vip 1 help you understand this mathematical concept
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:13:24 it's a thing taught in middle school
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:13:31 and it comes pretty handy
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:13:58 imagine the entire lerx as a right triangle
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 03:14:05 from a top down view

creations-chat 2022-07-14 21:43:33 accurate? it doesnt even have the canopy frame

<@294980570885390346> if youre talking about my mirage, just know that i made the canopy over a year ago
creations-chat 2022-07-14 21:48:38 <@294980570885390346>
creations-chat 2022-07-14 21:55:58 these two look nothing alike
creations-chat 2022-07-14 21:57:58 the size and positioning of the canard too 🗿

<@706717603258957864> so what? a roblox build can resemble a real world thing
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:00:06 <@294980570885390346> the perspective

<@706717603258957864> do you know what resemblance means 🗿
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:02:37 <@294980570885390346> it looks short because of the perspective
it appears even shorter in this image for obvious reasons
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:05:25 <@294980570885390346>

oh wait r u talking about the bleed channel
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:07:28 cylinder canopy doesnt solve the problem
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:10:08 my mirage is like an entire block or two too short, valid
but the shape isnt far off at all whereas your builds 💀
creations-chat 2022-07-14 22:13:38 at least its not just a flat edge like yours
help 2022-07-22 17:20:57 yeah definitely
creations-chat 2022-07-22 17:26:45 the audacity
contest-chat 2022-12-06 23:46:11 <@441125486312030221> this is not a rotorcraft lmao
contest-chat 2022-12-06 23:48:25 the blades do not complete a full 2pi rad horizontal rotation to generate lift
contest-chat 2022-12-07 00:08:06 but there arent any rotors in that thing, rotors only rotate on one axis!!!! 😤
general 2022-12-07 04:56:38 
creations-chat 2022-12-07 05:15:10 try unpowering the motor, make sure no rotating section is colliding with the fuselage, and I’d recommend using hover engines
creations-chat 2022-12-07 17:32:00 <:trollface:775024642104229898> I am the perpetrator
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 18:49:41 imagine using the best motor locking technique to make the shittiest build <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 18:50:33 what argumen…
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 18:51:01 that’s the essence of the community
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 18:51:46 
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 18:51:52 aim7
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 18:52:06 clearly a p51h
creations-chat 2022-12-07 18:57:38 not enough torque on the motor, t=rFsin(theta), the longer the radius, in this case the engine, the the more torque is required. it’s unfixable because game bad
creations-chat 2022-12-07 19:02:47 or just reduce mass
creations-chat 2022-12-08 23:08:21 me when nonorthographic perspective
creations-chat 2022-12-08 23:29:54 it means you’re comparing a 2d image with a 3d perspective
creations-chat 2022-12-09 01:22:13 no <@773474989751664640> it is inaccurate
creations-chat 2022-12-09 01:25:39 this mf 💀
creations-chat 2022-12-09 01:29:47 <@781989929076523009> u asked why blueprint overlays are inaccurate (u did not believe it), and gam explained that, hes not crying about it
creations-chat 2022-12-09 01:32:17 more rigorous proof: depth perception
the-dump 2022-12-09 20:58:01 also the fattest I’ve seen
