creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:17:52 Seems like there's no need
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:19:26 **oi diavolo what are you doing here?**

creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:22:41 odin001
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:23:09 Send link let's downvote his creation I guess
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:24:01 Anyone here who built a spaceship?
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:24:19 Oh ok
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:27:31 Like how long
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:27:36 I never built a very big ship ever
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:27:46 Though I have a big tank
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:28:58 Who wanna see my attempt to make a spaceship

creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:43:04 oh ok
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:49:17 My tank also experiences physics throttling
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:49:35 Maybe I need to update it to use beams instead of blocks
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:50:05 No
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:50:18 There's a few parts of it with 1x7 and 1x4 beams
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:50:22 But mostly 1x1
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:51:12 And maybe part of the reason is cuz it uses the motor and wedge tank treads
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:53:36 I don't notice throttling when i use hover thrusters
creations-chat 2020-09-01 13:57:44 oh ok well idk about that

plane-crazy 2021-04-10 13:39:16 Imagine not being designer tier III
~~And I bet a higher level designer is gonna go say "imagine not being designer tier IV-V"~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 13:39:35 I've already seen 3 of those abominations today
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 13:39:43 Seems like they're starting to take over
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 13:40:06 I think blocks should be a bit tankier
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 13:40:18 Wait no
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 13:40:29 Like blocks are gonna become harder to destroy
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 13:41:01 huh?
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 13:41:16 Wait idk how am I gonna test that
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 13:41:40 I have no friend online rn :cryin:
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 13:42:25 Aight thx for very helpful tip
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 13:42:56 Cuz my drone battleship is like plastic product made in china
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 13:43:00 Very easy to destroy
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 13:44:59 BRUH
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 13:45:09 Now there are now 4 of those shredder ball abominations
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:02:11 My shredder used to
but for some reason it can't go anymore without spinning out of control
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:02:20 Anyways I have a drone battleship that is anti shredder sooo
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:02:47 Cool tank
Mind if I uhh
**Explode it?**
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:03:18 :cryin:
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:03:38 Just make a creation and hope it has some anti-shredder properties
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:03:54 Noice
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:04:01 Wait unintentionally or intentionally?
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:04:22 nvm u left
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:04:54 Oh cool
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:05:04 Mine was an unintentional anti-shredder
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:05:18 It's also anti-surface and anti-helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:05:29 But it easily gets destroyed by planes or fast creations
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:06:40 Hey ivan here's a lesson: if pvp weapons didn't hit shredder you're not using enough pvp weapons
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:07:21 You're not using enough then
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:07:45 ~~Use hacks now I guess~~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:07:59 fly near the flying island thing
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:08:13 Got it from a tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:08:21 pcc?
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:08:25 What's that
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:08:40 pinewood computer core or smth idk
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:08:49 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:10:09 Amogus
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:11:30 I built a car out of locked pistons and when I tried presing F I got blasted out at the speed of light and froze my game
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:12:20 Another thing that also got blasted out to the speed of light is my drone battleship
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:12:23 
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:12:28 Look at speed stats
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:13:12 Ye lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:13:18 10 block high?
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:14:06 There's an e+14 at the end
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:14:42 It means it's extremely fast that the stats need to use scientific notation
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:15:13 Ah yes negative speed
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:15:47 here's another photo of my drone battleship at the edge of reality
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:16:08 I use warp drive
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:16:15 A warp drive straight from yt
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:17:17 sps or km/h?
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:17:34 Aight brb lemme do some math
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:18:36 7.7920349e+13 according to my calculator and assuming my formula is correct
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:18:54 (sps) ÷ 20 ÷1000 x 60 x 60
sps to m/s to km/s to km/m to km/h
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:22:03 wingless flying object?
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:22:21 Nvm lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:23:03 isn't the normal suspension already good?
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 15:23:14 e
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 00:24:36 Guys who can come?
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 00:24:43 I need help wasting a shredder bug user's time
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 00:25:53 ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 00:27:01 goldensword301
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 00:28:04 Actually nvm guys
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 00:28:13 <@!699794627095429180> <@!467565971918422017> he finally stopped
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 00:29:05 SUp
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:31:48 I failed to stop someone from making a shredder bug :painandsorrow:
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 09:13:28 Guys is it possible for someone to control your plane in a pilot seat?
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 09:13:38 Or spaceship in my situation
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 09:54:52 Guys anyone know the bunker near the airport?
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 09:55:15 I just glitched in and found out it was the bunker for the summer event
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 09:56:07 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 11:56:11 Guys is metal or diamond plate stronger?
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 11:56:21 The materials
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 11:59:01 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:51:33 Guys what's the formula of converting sps to km/h?
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:51:56 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:52:10 or mph if you're that american
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:52:13 h
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:52:51 Cuz my formula rn is (sps)x0.18 = km/h
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:53:06 ~~I can destroy that with my drone battleship~~
Still doe nice plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:53:54 You're converting it to miles per second then to kilometers per second
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:54:00 Mine directly converts sps to km/h
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:54:36 Wot
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:54:43 Ah alr
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:54:49 No you weren't stupid
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:57:50 Mach 10 travels at 3.43 km/s (1234.8 km/hx10÷60÷60)
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:58:17 How did you know
**h o w**
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:58:32 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:58:52 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:00:14 No robloxians are monke
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:00:26 LIke the small monke not the gorilla or smth
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:00:58 No 1 meter is 20 studs
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:01:22 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:02:10 You said 1 meter is 2.5 studs which is wrong
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:02:25 wait brb lemme research
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:02:32 I might be absolutely wrong
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:03:58 According to roblox robloxians are 5 studs tall which means they're 25 centimeters tall, 1/4 of a meter
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:04:17 e=mc2
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:05:56 Kerbal space astronauts are 1 meter tall
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:06:09 I mean wait no
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:06:21 I mean about 1.2 meters tall
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:06:37 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:07:12 No you're not you made a formula on converting sps to km/h
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:07:24 Different than mine but I believe still works
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:07:31 Wait brb lemme test out ur formula
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:07:52 Wait what's yours again?
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:07:59 I'm testing <@!627576011927846952> formula
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:08:13 which is (sps)x0.28 - mps - kmh
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:08:27 Oh nvm
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:09:01 Btw Ima explain how I got my sps to km/h formula:


1÷20÷1000x60x60
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:09:11 I just made my formula just now .-.
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:09:37 But mine could be wrong doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:09:58 Since you put more time to making your formula I believe it should have less errors than mine
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:10:05 Wait how did you get your formula
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:10:19 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:11:37 According to my formula my drone battleship can travel at 2700 km/h at warp (5400 km/h if I try harder)
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:13:38 Noice
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:14:46 People just hate builds ;-;
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:14:58 I'm just lucky my road roller got 30 upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:15:20 Oofers
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:16:09 Btw to those who wanna know how my drone battleship looks like
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:16:30 Thx
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:17:24 Btw it's a ship from starscape
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:17:32 Wait w h a t
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:17:45 Can you control it doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:17:49 hehe
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:18:09 Ah alright that's good
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:18:29 Same but I have to slow down to 5k sps
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:18:45 Cuz if I stop at like 10k sps my motor 2s will start world war III
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:19:25 Noice
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:19:41 I have a ton because I placed almost all pvp weapons in my drone battleship
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:20:58 Epic
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:21:13 SO apparently I have 56 motor 2 turrets
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:21:26 I mean 56 motor 2s
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:21:35 Not turrets
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:21:38 That's overkill if it was turrets
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:22:20 Eh the actual drone battleship has more turrets
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:22:26 IT's from starscape btw
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:23:03 <@!627576011927846952> This is the actual one
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:23:14 The one with the red neon lights
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:23:26 I see you blasted off to eternity
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:23:35 Keth named it drone battleship soooo
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:23:58 Btw this is my drone battleship at the edge of reality
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:24:16 Ye lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:24:46 Showing it again to those who never seen it
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:24:55 <@!251386335883952129>
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:25:46 And this was my second attempt but instead of going to the edge of reality I blasted off at light speed instead
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:26:29 Laser weaponry when
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:27:06 But like ones that blast bullets instantly and doesn't curve
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:27:16 They deal a little damage but they travel extremely fast
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:27:47 Whoever pings rickje gets free premium
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:28:05 **HMMMM**
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:28:44 I don't need nitro or robux I just want premium so i can upload my blurry innovation inc security trench coat
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:28:57 Oops ping
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:29:16 If you don't know what I'm talking about:
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:29:25 Also very garbage
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:29:47 Wait where is the trash can emoji
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:29:49 Bruv
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:32:21 It tastes like bathroom sink
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:33:43 Oh golly <#497142796961054721> is too active
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:33:51 I'm glad this one is quieter
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:34:41 We are professionals at talking
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:35:38 Rip
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:35:55 Cancer 100
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:36:07 Wait hold on
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:36:19 Why hasn't polonium 210 decayed yet
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:36:27 It's half life is about 100 days
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:36:57 Oh nvm
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:37:51 
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:38:04 Uranium takes a long time before it becomes polonium doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:39:01 We got bismuth and apparently bismuth is bisexual
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:39:40 I just learned now that lead was a metal
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:39:44 bruv
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:40:09 Cool half life
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:40:12 Very cool
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:42:38 Eww imagine using carbon
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:49:03 If white holes exists, I wonder what will to you if you exit it

Will you fix up and return to normal or will you still remain as a spaghetti
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:50:22 White holes themselves are theoretical
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:50:30 Nobody knows if they exist or not
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:51:00 If white holes are the opposite of black holes, they could probably expand or smth
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:53:06 HEy at least the universe lives forever
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:54:08 No we talking about the big crunch theory
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:54:45 Nothing = infinitely weak gravity
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:56:48 But then some materials wouldn't be sucked up
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:57:07 How
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:58:36 Oh yeah right forgot about that
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:02:13 Wait so stuff are made out of atoms right? And inside them are the quarks
So if you touch something you are also touching quarks

I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:07:31 I mean not everyone has heard of it
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:08:55 They just collide with each other
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:09:05 Assuming 2 black holes get close enough
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:09:45 How does nothingness rip out nothingness?
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:14:05 I guess magnets
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:14:19 I mean they are even attracting non-metal stuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:15:25 I tried making a galaxy out of balls and magnets but then I forgot magnets can't have infinite range
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:15:43 :painandsorrow:
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:16:25 Almost every roblox game simulates gravity
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:16:46 Eh some games have gravity turned off
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:16:54 Like very few games
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 03:07:17 ~~Want me to destroy the other half now?~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 03:08:22 H o w

plane-crazy 2021-04-13 11:28:06 Seems like a racist rule to me

plane-crazy 2021-04-13 11:29:49 Rules sometimes need to be questioned
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 11:30:24 Bold of you to assume I have a brain
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 11:30:44 Why though?
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 11:31:19 Then I see absolutely nothing wrong with that
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 11:35:04 Rule 7: if it exists, #### will be made out of it
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 11:35:19 Ah I see now
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 11:36:02 So uhh
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 11:36:12 Who has a wingless plane in here
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 11:36:22 Like plane that uses no wing blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 11:37:45 Was gonna post a creation but I realized I reposted it too much
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 11:37:57 It plannne
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 11:39:50 Ah yes man

plane-crazy 2021-04-13 11:43:32 kars
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:18:29 Build an anti-shredder thing then
Though if you're fighting a shredder ball then just run away
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:18:58 First time I saw one was back in June
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:19:20 No don't youtube
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:19:32 Shredder balls are not in yt yet
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:19:45 WHAT
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:20:30 use a drone battleship if you're like me
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:20:39 Apparently my drone battleship has anti-shredder properties
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:20:50 I'm talking about this
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:21:03 Thx
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:21:51 default speed is 300 sps
COnveyor speed is 15k sps (30k if I try)
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:22:23 Just go wingless and you'll remove the speed cap
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:22:38 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:22:46 Np
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:22:55 But it's gonna be hard to make a wingless plane doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:23:12 
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:23:26 Actually you're faster gg
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:24:07 I did mine by warping while my turrets glitched
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:24:35 I use conveyor lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:24:46 Too lazy to use hovers and magnets
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:24:58 Also I gotta admit I used a tutorial to make the warp drive
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:25:27 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92RnoE2DMfw&ab_channel=Prototrode
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:25:34 This one without the wings
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:25:51 np
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:26:17 Someone taught me how to make a car that can nullify builds
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:26:28 It basically just uses half pistons
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:26:32 Instead of normal blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:27:02 Sorry too noob to build planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:27:09 Though I guess I could try to make spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:27:31 Is it normal that i can make spaceships but I can't make a plane?
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:27:49 I mean I made one before but it was just because of pure luck
Like 1 block off then it could mess up
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:29:11 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:30:53 Oh wait actually I remembered that I actually demolished shredder balls with my drone battleship
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:31:45 So basically my drone battleship can destroy anything since it's main role is a surface wiper (land and water vehicle destroyer)
But it's main weakness are fast stuff and planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:32:07 :painandsorrow:
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:33:52 Nah it's good
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:37:39 Seems possible
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:37:48 But all I need to do is just destroy the core
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:37:57 Idk since we haven't tested it
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:38:16 What I meant by the core is the center of where the ropes originate
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:38:29 Oh e
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:39:06 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:40:26 A perfectly normal player launcher
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:40:53 Looks nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:41:10 Post it in <#384025409945337856> for updoots
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:41:27 Faulty missiles I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:42:42 Go make a skating board that can fly and without wings
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:43:13 MAybe it could take the role of a surface wiper
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:44:59 Wot

plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:56:50 Just one last trick
It's alt+f4
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:57:35 Good luck and don't get exploded by a fighter jet
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:58:47 Idk but shredder balls exist now
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:59:38 :painandsorrow:
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 13:59:49 Check DMS
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:00:13 Actually brb lemme look for it
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:00:19 I'm still finding the shredder ball image

plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:01:24 The noobs in this discord are gonna see
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:02:28 Ok so check dms now to see how a shredder ball looks like
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:11:38 :painandsorrow:
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:13:36 The only thing that makes my drone battleship anti-shredder
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:13:38 and fireworks
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:20:14 We both have warp drive
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:20:17 And I can gun u
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:20:26 Oh wait you're faster than me

plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:22:40 I gotta admit the only tutorial stuff I have is literally a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:23:13 Though I got bored using those pieces of garbage
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:23:20 Also they were glicthy now for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:23:28 Wait I can build
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:23:50 Omni bugs were made in January
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:25:06 I'm bad at plane pvp
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:25:24 rip
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:25:34 It's just too hard to control planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:25:48 With the strange WASD controls
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:27:38 Same
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:28:25 Well, before I got tempted to make shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:28:31 They're sitting in my attic now
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:29:07 Same
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:30:17 Wait can your blimp beat up planes?
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:30:34 Ok yours is better than mine
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:30:43 Idk if I can even 1v1 and beat u up
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:30:58 Nu

plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:32:58 Sort by new and roast it
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:33:14 :painandsorrow:
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:35:22 My drone battleship is effective in surface wiping
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:35:29 By that I mean killing sea and land units
creations-chat 2021-04-13 14:40:50 <@!827990341554405437> Why downvote my creation if yours got downvoted too
Like I didn't even downvote u
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:44:33 How did you create a roast that fast
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:44:37 H o w
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:44:48 I need to increase my brain power

But the description he placed ruined it
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:53:35 :painandsorrow: and 🇫
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:57:12 F MEGA
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 14:59:17 I mean if he didn't placed that downvotes = upvotes thing he would've gotten a ton of upvotes and almost 0 downvotes
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 15:00:06 True
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 15:03:51 Also don't ask why I found that post
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 15:04:44 IF you wanna know why I was exploring if the people who downvoted me had better builds
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 15:04:50 Well some had
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 15:05:50 But I don't get how a literal plane gets more upvotes than mine

Well I guess that's why this game is named plane crazy because planes were supposed to be built and not a spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 15:09:20 Congratulations your carrier got sawed in half
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 15:14:48 Cheese plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 15:31:42 So that more motors exist
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 15:34:02 Hey imagine if for every 1000 blocks in your creation of get 50% more pvp weapons
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 15:34:27 Like you get 5 guns, 6 rockets, 1 lava spitter, etc.
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 15:34:35 Just imagine
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 15:34:42 It's gonna be too op
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 15:34:53 And I like op
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 15:34:56 hehe
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 15:35:58 To match up with the actual drone battleship in starscape
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 15:36:26 Simple way is to blacklist
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 15:36:30 2nd option is run
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 15:36:35 3rd option is fight back

plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:23:52 This was basically me practicing making wingless spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:24:56 It is
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:25:09 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:25:11 Wingless
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:25:13 No
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:25:15 helium
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:26:08 Also has hover thrusters but they're for making the ship more controllable and my slidy slidy
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:26:33 Btw it doesn't need hover thrusters to hover it's just for increased air friction especially when it's drag is maxed out
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:27:47 WIngless flying object

plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:48:23 Oofers
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:48:32 Anyways apparently this server likes planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:48:52 Just noticed that cuz non-plane creations get less upvotes than plane creations
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:49:50 Server do be crazy over sticks with triangles on the sides
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:51:06 They get bigger upvotes if they look fancier than other sticks with triangles on the sides
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:52:20 Did the plane crazy logo just move?
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:53:33 sussy sussus
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:54:04 Sup
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:54:18 Sure
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:54:36 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:54:42 Iz ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:54:51 ~~Iz food for my drone battleship~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:55:32 Too bad you tried making a lag machine
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:57:40 Post it
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:57:51 Apparently planes get a ton of upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:58:30 Well I mean they are the meta of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:58:36 Excluding shredders
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:58:40 They're not valid
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 16:59:09 Ye I'm lucky my drone battleship has anti-shredder capabilities

plane-crazy 2021-04-13 17:00:21 if you're curious about what my drone battleship looks like
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 17:00:30 Also who wants to see my "plane?"
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 17:01:10 
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 17:01:15 :cryin:
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 17:01:34 Yes it's very sick it needs to go to a doctor
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 17:01:54 Lol you'll see better builds than this
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 17:02:21 This is my newer one
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 17:02:42 And this is the best creation I have
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 17:03:41 If it gets too much downvotes delete it
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 17:03:48 It means nobody likes it
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 17:04:38 If the first vote is a downvote, something is definitely wrong here
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 17:05:47 <@!396725710468808705> Aight time to delete prediction tells me downvotes will be higher than upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 17:06:08 rip

plane-crazy 2021-04-13 23:56:54 Nice tonky tonk
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 23:57:13 ?
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 23:57:20 Just use third person
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 23:58:07 :cryin:
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 23:59:52 ~~until I’m in ur server doing some surface wiping~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:17:46 Speed?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:18:19 r u n
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:18:42 Rip speed
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:19:04 My "boat" travels at 400 sps and 600 at boost
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:19:43 Actually it's just a thin gunning platform that can move
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:19:57 It's extremely effective at killing stuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:20:15 In the water
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:20:21 ohno
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:20:24 Wait how fast is it?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:20:42 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:20:49 Only 100 sps slower than mine
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:21:03 Oh nvm
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:21:09 I use a bunch to achieve such power
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:22:00 I use a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:22:21 Like a weaker version of the one used in the drone battleship
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:22:52 No I don't want to suffer
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:24:09 I haven't been killed by a plane yet
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:25:39 My drone battleship has mostly been killed by planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:25:56 A few were from helicopters, shredders, land and ships
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:26:10 Like I assume they make up 10% of the kills
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:26:26 There was an extremely fast heli once
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:26:42 Like it zoomed at like jet speed
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:27:01 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:27:32 It's a jet and heli hybrid
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:27:53 Dorime
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:28:07 Huh it's morning here too
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:28:16 UTC + 8
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:28:56 Why is rule## censored but not f##k
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:29:11 Oh no roblox censorship
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:30:56 Guys anyone here have a wingless flying creation that has turrets in it?
Other than you <@!627576011927846952> I know you have a blimp that can warp
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:31:35 Wait how do you have wings without hitting a speed cap
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:31:39 Or do you have one?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:32:11 I thought you can warp at mach 10 .-.
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:32:38 According to my math you need to reach 68600 sps to reach mach 10
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:32:55 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:33:03 Wait what's your formula you're using again?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:34:06 Here take a reference image
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:34:25 Np
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:34:52 Oofers
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:34:57 Wait what was your formula again?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:35:20 How did you get 0.28?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:35:48 Wait how long is a stud
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:36:20 I thought 1 stud was 20?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:36:31 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:36:39 Lemme go edit my formula now
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:36:48 So it converts it to meters per second ryt?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:37:00 Aight lemme go change my formula now
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:37:48 So 1 x 0.28 ÷ 1000 x 60 x 60
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:37:53 = 1.008 km/h
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:38:02 Something is wrong with my formula
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:38:57 Anyways that means 600 sps means I'm travelling at 604.8 km/h
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:39:02 Normal is 300 sps
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:39:21 Boosted is 15-20k sps (30k if I try)
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:39:34 COnverts meters per second to kilometers per second
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:39:46 Since 1 kilometer is 1000 meters
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:40:10 That's why there is the 2 x 60's
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:40:19 first one converts it to km/minutes
the second one converts it to km/h
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:41:30 Ye my calculation has an error in here
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:42:20 I AM **S P E E D**
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:42:26 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:42:47 I travel 30k sps if I try
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:42:54 40k sps if I try harder
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:42:59 Wot
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:43:24 Sure
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:43:33 My warp drive is tutorial anyways
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:43:43 You probably put some effort in making yours
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:43:56 While mine was straight off from the internet
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:44:32 WAIT BRU
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:44:37 I wanna r e e d
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:45:05 Wait using the other dude's formula?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:45:13 Or my rather faulty one
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:45:36 Post it again
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:46:15 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:46:19 This ain't code for hacking
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:47:01 Anyways can u post the image now?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:47:04 Noice
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:47:39 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:47:48 use a trail block I suppose
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:49:49 Looks like target practice for me

plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:51:11 Pvp is never empty
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 00:51:44 There should be a server system like the one in rise of nations

<@456226577798135808> Not everyone reads the channel decription

<:duck3:652569235587072020><:duck4:652569237143158794>

I guess I'll just build a single block and get a ton of upvotes
*~~(PROCEEDS TO GET GUNNED DOWN BY DOWNVOTE ARROWS)~~*
creations-chat 2021-04-14 01:18:42 Don't worry dude you're not alone I spent 1 hour making this funky spaceship and still got an undesirable amount of upvotes/downvotes
creations-chat 2021-04-14 01:20:44 here
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 01:22:18 Step 1: WHy motor lock when you can make folded creation instead
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 01:22:31 Jk
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 01:22:37 Seriously idk how to motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 01:22:39 and fold

creations-chat 2021-04-14 01:37:05 Those 2 look like target practice for my extremely fast boat
By fast I mean 400-600 sps not that fast :painandsorrow:
creations-chat 2021-04-14 01:42:46 U wot-
Anyways they should probably add a spaceship designer rank that allows helium to be used in builds
creations-chat 2021-04-14 01:45:18 Imagine being that noob that you need grav sliders to make your build work
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:40:35 <@!584416466862866677> Can I see interior of your ship?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:45:58 aight
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:46:06 Btw cool ship
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:47:56 Some people hate builds
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:48:05 They just want to return to monke
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:48:13 Someone that explodes
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:48:21 Like a creeper
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:49:27 pog
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:50:58 WAIT THE INTERIOR ACTUALLY IS GOOD?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:51:25 Dude
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:51:27 post the interior
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:51:33 You'll get more upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:52:31 And I thought my drone battleship was good ;-;
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:52:37 I guess not anymore
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:53:45 Like take like 3 pictures of some of the interior
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:54:00 It's ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:54:24 I suggest using google translate btw instead of trying to speak English
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:54:36 translate.google.com
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:54:42 e
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:54:57 Ye so you don't have to stress yourself out trying to speak a language you don't fully understand
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:55:43 Ah alright
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:56:41 man = 1 person
men = 2 or more people
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:57:03 Oh nu
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:57:38 Also 1 last question btw: How fast is your spaceship? And is it good at pvp?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:58:42 I remember tiktok was the sound of a clock and not a social media app
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:58:53 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 02:59:02 Do it for the motherland
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:00:30 *(Casually gets ~~600 sps shredder bug~~ drone battleship)*
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:01:12 Too bad he couldn't handle the power of Stalinium vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:01:45 
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:02:56 x1
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:04:00 My shredder can do better than that
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:04:07 Rtx patrick
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:05:40 Looks like target practice
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:06:30 Oof
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:07:22 WHy are the cats floating?
I guess only option now is to r u n
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:08:18 Rule 7: If it exists, #### will be made out of it
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:47:56 Like the ones who just use a shredder or those that make their own that is way better than a normal shredder? (or both)
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:48:37 It's basically just a shredder bug and more annoying since you cannot kill them
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:49:32 Kamikaze planes are annoying bruv
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:50:26 W H A T
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:50:49 You use conveyor :chet:
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:51:16 My drone battleship has 1 and it's extremely useful
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:51:35 Without it my drone battleship is just target practice now
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:52:11 magnets :chet:
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:52:15 S l o w
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:52:43 Now put rockets and become **Made in heaven**
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:53:36 Ye that's cool and all but **rockets when**
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:53:56 Slow stuff are essentially target practice creations
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:54:35 can't rn
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:54:37 On friday I can
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:55:10 I thought for a second you called me
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:58:10 ~~Planes~~ boats can't sink in plane crazy anyways
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:58:26 Ah yes
**Planes sinking**
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 03:58:34 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 04:07:19 We should have flak turrets in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 04:07:24 Like the ones in starscape
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 04:07:43 How they work is that they fire a projectile that explodes once they reach a nearby ship
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 04:08:06 They deal reduced damage but are effective on fast stuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 04:08:18 Actually nvm it's too op
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 04:10:10 weliufyseuhifjg,kxdrxhguiers

creations-chat 2021-04-14 05:27:32 Do you wanna eat burger king lettuce?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 09:14:03 ~~That cargo ship is gonna clog up a certain canal~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 09:14:33 Sussy sussus
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 09:59:04 OOF
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 10:15:42 All girls that aren't lesbian are gay
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 10:15:50 And all boys that aren't gay are lesbian
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 10:16:49 Want it to become campfire?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 10:49:49 Btw how did you make so much big creations?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 10:54:08 No like how do you have the paticence to build those stuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 10:54:42 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 10:56:21 Idk when will I convert my drone battleship into a folded creation e
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 10:56:46 It's gonna become extremely messy once more pvp weapons come out
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 11:00:20 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 11:11:59 If I was in the server they wouldn't just be sawed in half
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 11:12:40 They would become shredded paper
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 11:12:51 Same thing would happen to me if a plane was in there
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 11:42:33 Server went still
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 11:42:35 cool
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 11:42:38 **Adios**
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:21:49 nose
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:22:21 Anyways I have an idea for a new pvp block called laser beam block

So here's how laser beam guns could work:

So upon clicking they should be able to fire a 1 block beam at extremely high speeds (I suppose 20k sps)
There's a little 1 second delay and they fire for only 2.5 seconds destroying at least 5 blocks in it's path (less blocks destroyed if the block is like diamond plate or smth)
Once fired they have a recharge time of 20 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:23:36 idk could be a good anti-plane/anti-shredder block
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:25:03 Since planes and shredders are like the plane crazy meta and there should be some balancing
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:25:13 5 blocks at max only doe assuming you aim perfectly at your target
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:25:23 It doesn't burn everything in it's way
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:27:02 Boi I just said 5 blocks at max assuming you aim perfectly at your target
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:27:13 If it still unfair then I guess ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:27:55 I was planning for a block that is effective in small creations but almost useless against big creations
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:28:30 You would also be able to burn down the shredder too if you had that block
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:29:11 Wot
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:29:41 ?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:29:51 I was just explaining an idea not forcing it
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:31:48 Also the more I think about it nvm cuz if that block gets added then big creations like spaceships and big boats will become the new meta
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:32:02 Like almost nothing can stop them
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:32:16 Pvp rocket engine?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:32:23 Too bad I have a blanket
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:33:25 Ah yes shredder missile
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:34:39 Eh just bring a big ship and your base will become g o n
But again it's gonna be too op and would probably make big builds the new meta
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:36:18 It deals a weak amount of damage
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:36:45 There will only be 2 lasers and they can only destroy 5 blocks max each
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:37:24 It's meant to destroy small and fast stuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:37:42 Ye 20 seconds cooldown
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:39:00 Btw forgot to mention too that it's meant to kill small creations
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:39:07 Though big creations can become problematic
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:40:42 True my drone battleship already has like all 28 pvp blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:40:50 except the cutters and bombs
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:41:47 I was tryna think of a pvp block that can easily demolish small builds but can have a hard time breaking up big builds
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:42:08 Though we agreed that it's too op especially since big builds will become the new meta from what I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:42:30 Why doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:42:34 Just wanna hear ur opinion
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:43:46 But how exactly is it cancer?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:46:13 The bullets don't travel fast enough and they drop
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:46:25 A big build can demolish them whike they're far away
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:46:38 I believe
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:46:59 As I said lasers will make big builds too op
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:47:12 I guess lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:47:51 So data reset?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:47:58 Oh ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:48:08 Prepare for city lag hell
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:48:11 :cryin:
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:48:38 Eh remember they only deal a small amount of damage
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:48:49 try using super rockets to make the propellers spin?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:49:04 Like don't set it to on/off
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:49:23 Makes it ineffective against bigger builds
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:49:44 It's also just an idea
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:50:16 Cya
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:50:46 Boi 5 blocks loss is nothing for aircraft carriers or large spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:51:49 Exactly lasers travel fast (like 20k sps) and very far
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:52:05 So you should be able to hit a fast plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:52:08 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:53:13 COuld be a good balance
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:53:28 ~~burn them down with rockets and guns~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:53:37 But yes lasers would just make builds too OP
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:53:49 But you can pop out the blocks that aren't tnt
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:54:02 Like motors and gun blocks aren't invincible too
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:54:21 https://tenor.com/view/starscape-hail-sovereign-ga-fireworks-gif-19220222
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:54:28 Btw beams would look something like this
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:55:21 Enough to disable them
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:55:29 I suppose
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:55:41 Imagine beam tnt blocks now :cryin:
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:58:02 Ah yes rule of the majority
Where-in the 51% rule and the 49% suffers
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:58:14 Though I agree it's a bad idea
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 12:59:41 I know but still the same thing which is tyranny of the majority
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:00:03 Aight let's talk about something else then
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:00:23 So we can stop spraying toxic chemicals at each other
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:01:07 Wait where did you get all that info?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:01:31 Ah alright
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:02:07 Boi I wish I learned you can search for a specific phrase earlier
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:02:09 :painandsorrow:
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:03:39 <@!596741777432510474> I see you know about starscape too
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:03:42 nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:03:49 *Noice*
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:04:13 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:04:17 Wanna uhh
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:04:28 Go murder some Foralkans?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:04:57 Same
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:05:01 Can't play until friday
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:05:14 :painandsorrow:
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:05:45 Anyways Ima go build a Horizoom in Friday too
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:05:49 Heard of that ship?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:06:21 Ah alright
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:06:27 It;s the fastest destroyer
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:06:35 Has 4500 shield and 6000 hull
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:06:46 Btw a normal destroyer has like up to 10k hull
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:08:15 I mean if you have knowledge you know what is the best thing to do anyways
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:09:20 Also btw there are also many more people who probably build a space related thing but never posted it
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:10:01 ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:26:05 Beyblade in the air
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:38:40 I did own shredders but they have a somewhat original design and are better than your average shredder
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:38:53 I don't use them anymore because they got boring quick
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:39:51 So you gonna be autopiloting a bunch of planes then
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:40:05 Ah alright
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:40:59 Will they be able to come back and do they have a dedicated dock doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:41:32 Don't use heavy stuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:41:55 Hey at least it prevent shredders from being too broken
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:44:39 Also will your build be able to 1v1 fast stuff? My drone battleship suffers in that area ;-;
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:45:00 W H A T
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:45:32 sped moment
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:45:45 Also my drone battleship has no wings
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:45:53 Aight cya
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:46:06 propellers, helium, and rocket engines
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:46:11 and a tutorial warp drive
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:46:25 oof
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:46:41 Good luck with the helium part
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:47:02 It's gonna take a ton of trial and error
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:47:28 AH so it's still a WIP
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:47:37 I'm interested in the final product
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:47:55 another *W H A T*
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:49:26 ~~You're an expert you should know this~~ like the small landing gear?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:51:59 Oh like when you try to activate landing gears it retracts in it's own?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:52:58 Oof I guess try playing around with suspension stats? Idk
Like try reducing the stiffness
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:53:09 Idk again never built a plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:53:32 Or go ask in <#478584971670454284>
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:53:33 wot
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:54:39 Oh e
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 14:13:58 trol
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 14:16:15 When new woman comes too
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 16:10:54 Definitely not me but I did say we need lasers

So first of all only 4 laser beams would be available for each player
Basically it fires an extremely fast beam of laser (beam travels at 20k sps) for 2.5 seconds with 20 second cooldown
It deals enough damage to break a maximum of 5 blocks (less blocks if diamond plate or smth)
basically the lasers should be added as a counter to extremely fast and agile planes but we said it was too OP
probably because if that were added then big spaceships/boats will become the new meta
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 16:11:30 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 16:11:45 We need wedge lights and beam lights
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 16:13:01 
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 16:13:17 Since that emoji doesn't exist here
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:31:38 Simple redstone used to make this
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:32:08 Also another question: anyone here who's decent/pro at redstone?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:32:19 oofers
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:33:32 I assume the expert ranks here should know redstone
Cuz both plane crazy and minecraft redstone both have problem solving I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:33:36 oofers
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:34:17 no they don't
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:34:35 tf I still don't get motor locking bruv
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:37:14 battlecarrier when
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:40:11 I believe battlecruisers have a lighter hull and faster speed while the battleships e a tankier one
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:40:14 wait lemme google
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:40:15 I forgot
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:40:24 https://www.google.com/search?q=battlecruisers+vs+battleships&oq=battlecruisers+vs+battleships&aqs=edge..69i57j0i22i30l5.4964j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:40:52 You mean spaceships now, ryt
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:41:36 Guys how many of you have a spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:41:50 Like a small one or even big ones
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:41:57 That's a blimp
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:42:01 Or do you really have a spaceship?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:43:10 Oh lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:43:14 Nah that one's fine
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:45:01 Oh golly I thought you guys were in the starscape discord for a while
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:45:27 Ye we usually say skill issue in starscape
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:45:45 Like everyday
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:46:08 U calling my drone battleship a church?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:46:17 
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:47:14 The most holy church I've ever seen
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:50:40 r a t
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:51:04 I mean if you are even good with pixel art
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:51:34 It just allows for 4 times the density compared to regular pixel art
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:52:06 If the artist is good though
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:52:11 Not everyone is good at making art
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:53:01 Guys how many times have you seen someone making a rather questionable "flesh gun"
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:53:10 That shoots "milk"
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:53:38 One more reason to add votekick
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:54:28 Oh good you don't know what I'm talking about
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:54:48 That's boring
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:55:02 I want to destroy the build too
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:55:39 Assuming you know their location
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:56:05 Why do I go from feeling smart to being dumb
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:57:28 Oh cool someone that actuallly uses 1st person
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:58:16 I do that when I'm in my boat/land vehicle and I need to like try and shoot down something from the sky
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:58:49 But it's impossible to first person in my drone battleship
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 00:58:57 SImply because nothing to see
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:01:23 *"I'M INVINCIBLE AND IMMORTAL!"*
.
.
*"Oh nvm"*
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:02:47 Very epic
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:03:43 WAit you have a dog in your house?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:04:00 AH alright so it simply just reminded you
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:04:04 aight
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:05:10 Btw I thought of a new laser block last night and I wanna know your opinions about the idea
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:05:21 Even though we said it was too op
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:05:31 No I'm asking <@!368581738496131072>
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:06:09 Also it would make big builds the new meta
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:06:23 And extremely broken
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:06:55 There would only be 4 btw
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:07:35 Also another thing: They can destroy 5 blocks max and fire for 2.5 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:10:41 You just got **R O A S T E D**
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:11:05 Also wdym by not exactly
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:11:28 Also imagine having wings
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:12:02 My drone battleship has no sps limit
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:13:23 Oofers
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:14:09 If they don't exist it means they have every limit and have no limits at the same time
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:14:32 And that's why I said nothing
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:14:40 IT's everything and nothing at the same time
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:15:21 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:15:42 So it should be able to burn down some chicken wings
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:15:45 I mean plane wings
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:16:27 I know that's why I never posted it in suggestions
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:17:43 Wait I wonder how much downvotes the suggestions would get doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:17:50 I wouldn't try since I can't delete it after
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:19:52 Yes but how much exactly doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:20:32 Like in a situation where-in nobody is suggesting and the server is extremely active during the time of posting
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:20:51 I ain't trying
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:20:53 Cuz
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:20:58 You can't delete it after
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:21:26 Also possibility of suggestions blacklist
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:24:18 Hey wanna hear another broken idea of mine?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:24:33 For every 1000 blocks you place you get 50% more pvp weapons
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:24:39 Idk if I told u this before
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:25:00 Oh alright
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:25:46 Also this means your Zeppelin and my drone battleship will become lag monsters whenever we fire
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:29:58 wdym international treaties plane crazy is an anarchy game
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:30:15 THe oldest anarchy game in roblox
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:30:51 Except the discord doe there's mods everywhere
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:30:58 The game itself is anarchy
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:31:47 Also your caps lock is on
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:32:55 WAit
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:35:38 I'm seeing a ton of ban screenshots now
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:35:52 Mostly due to person talking about lgbt and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:36:01 And sup
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:36:40 Oh I was talking about roblox bans
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:36:57 I got warned once for saying free robux is scam
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:37:10 Seems like roblox wants people to get scammed
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:39:32 a ton
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:39:35 bot
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:39:35 of
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:39:36 s
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:39:45 I only played adopt me in the start
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:40:05 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:40:43 Like how does that game get more attention than plane craxzy?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:40:49 Plane crazy has better game mechanics
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:40:59 Not just some rainbow golden poop unicorn
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:41:10 Can't rn
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:41:15 tomorrow I can
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:41:31 And yet there are people who support adopt me
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:41:55 We get it it's roblox's server's fault
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:42:02 But the game is taking up all the attention
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:42:11 Other games are hiding in the shadows
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:45:21 Guys let's get some adopt me raiders in <#497142796961054721> ?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:45:27 Rarely visit that place
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:45:32 Sup
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:45:50 I rarely visit general since topic moves on too fast
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 01:45:58 same
general 2021-04-15 01:46:33 huh
general 2021-04-15 01:47:27 Also why are there downvotes bruv
general 2021-04-15 01:47:41 Some people just hate creations I guess
general 2021-04-15 01:47:42 hi
general 2021-04-15 01:49:14 I've noticed but lower effort builds get more upvotes
general 2021-04-15 01:49:23 Well, not too low
general 2021-04-15 01:49:57 Cuz like a drone battleship I built got like 30 upvotes
general 2021-04-15 01:50:04 But then a literal plane got like 80
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 02:40:56 WIngless flying object
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 02:41:00 Like mine
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 02:41:28 kelp
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 02:41:52 *k e l p*
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 02:50:56 super rockets
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 02:53:09 Idk try testing out which place is the best
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 02:53:26 My boat blasts of at the speed of 400 sps
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 02:53:29 600 sps with boost
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 02:53:38 Yes my boat is made for speed and power
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 02:53:40 Not design
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:02:53 Do not fire fireworks when rockets travel slowly
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:03:06 Otherwise you will be the one to become campfire
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:03:33 Oh ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:03:50 Well my turrets are spread out anyways
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:05:16 Guys rate my radix
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:05:31 This was the first wingless creation I had
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:05:39 yes pog
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:06:01 Also the prototype of that thing can only hover in water
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:06:17 But after putting hover thrusters with max drag and no speed I was able to fly now
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:06:25 Without falling
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:19:08 soop
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:22:12 Guys should I try to recreate the shredder ball?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:22:23 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:22:28 No I suck at making music
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:22:58 Though I made this funky star which is not too bad and not too good
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:23:22 Actually doesn't look that much like a star
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:23:23 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:24:16 Oh I was kinda thinking about how the sun looks like
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:24:42 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:24:54 Like big boi Rigel
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:25:07 Or r136a1
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:25:25 Don't ask why I memorized the name of a star with a bunch of random letters
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:25:33 I just like that star
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:26:35 Soyuz nerushimy
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:26:42 The russian flag is too short
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:27:15 Nice fake emoji

plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:31:53 Another perfect
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:32:09 Now I don't have to post extremely big photos
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:34:03 Yes great
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:36:55 Doesn't to me idk why
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:40:03 Just realized now that this is the old version
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:40:11 The one with the hover thrusters at the bottom
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:40:48 The final one has the hover thrusters inside and in the sides all of them have max drag and least amount of speed
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:41:48 Ah yes drifting
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:43:43 ~~Ah yes slav shuts up western spy~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:48:03 I wonder when will there be a temperature system in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:48:14 Actually bad idea
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:50:28 I guess brother?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 03:50:39 or comrade

plane-crazy 2021-04-15 06:59:43 Just run
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:19:14 Bruh this doesn't make sense:

but https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/832121105682268190
**A simple tank gets all the attention**
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:20:19 We know but the time and effort it took making the creation took a while
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:20:43 Also rather detailed too
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:21:12 But some random tank that probably took 3 hours to make gets more upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:22:04 I bet one time someone made a starter plane and got a ton of upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:22:16 Wait lemme search
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:22:26 I'm just pointing out an issue
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:23:20 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/766194045046751242
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:24:21 I just wanted to show that someone made a starter plane and got a ton of upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:24:23 since he said no
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:24:56 Still though it was an example that someone just made a starter plane and got a ton of upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:25:22 Wdym isn't a ton
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:25:29 You rarely see a post that gets that many
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:26:09 Most of the time it's just 10-30
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:26:30 ?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:26:33 Wdym no?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:26:52 Well it isn't all the time you see builds that break the 50 upvote barrier
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:27:10 nice wheel
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:27:41 I'm just pointing out that a random high effort build gets less upvotes than a random tank
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:28:15 What you making?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:30:02 Tbh nice builds lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:31:21 If you like working on several projects at once then do it
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:31:27 No need to work on 1 build at a time
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:31:37 Unless if you like to
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:32:22 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:32:52 Just finish adding everything you want on it I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:32:55 Also idk how to make planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:33:15 I only made one time because I was experimenting with wingless planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:33:36 But then I gave up and placed some wings not expecting it to work
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:34:12 Random stuff about me experimenting with plane crazy physics and small/big spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:34:26 I'm gonna make a new ship on Friday called the Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:34:31 It's a starscape ship
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:34:40 Yes very nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:37:31 Wait guys is diamond plate or metal a stronger material?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:38:29 wdym none I heard diamond plate was the strongest but maybe metal could be stronger
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:38:35 And I can't test
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:38:45 rn
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 07:44:15 It's not that much anyways
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 09:07:41 Idc if it looks good or not if it can beat up people easily then it's good
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 09:08:28 Only exception to this are shredder bugs and shredder balls
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 09:12:00 oh alright
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 09:26:22 Drone fighter or drone interceptor
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 09:26:23 https://starscape-roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Drones
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 09:26:43 The wiki has the images on how they look like for each tiers
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 09:27:13 Also you go make it now me I suck at making planes anyways
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:28:43 Wait wrong one
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:29:18 
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:29:23 Better
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:29:47 How fast does this thing go?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:29:57 Oofers
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:30:22 I can't even make camos
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:30:46 ~~Want me to make a tutroial out of it?~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:31:01 Sky camo
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:31:06 One with white and blues
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:31:14 Since it's gonna be flying in the sky anyways
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:31:43 Wingless flying object
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:32:33 ~~What imagine fucking your own build~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:32:59 
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:33:42 SCP-682
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:33:59 Plane batteship?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:34:12 A huge thing that flies like a plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:34:25 Ye but one that flies I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:36:51 Oh I was thinking about boats
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:36:59 Ships with guns
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:37:39 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:37:55 Bruh
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:37:58 Discord troll me
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:42:23 Why are you mad at someone copying ur build?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:42:47 Wait wrong person I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:43:21 Imagine having realism
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:43:47 I make fictional spaceships that cannot work irl
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:44:38 f;sdlksdkldssdkdkhdkghdgkhdgkhggdkhdgkghdgkdgkhlsglhsglhsglh
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:45:24 Meanwhile me suffering to make a plane that actually looks nice and still works
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:45:28 
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:47:58 Even doe cuz design and function don't mix very well for any planes I make
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:49:37 There should be an another piece of land we can travel to far away from the main one
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:49:44 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:50:04 Since we have warp drives and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:50:18 How fast does it fly?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:50:28 Does it have good turning?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:50:53 Aight then it's a good plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:51:21 It's a smoke pipe btw
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:51:36 
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:52:05 My drone battleship can only take a few beatings before becoming too unstable
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:52:42 Though it deals a ton of DPS
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:52:44 and can warp
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:53:22 And I use turrets the stuff are not in a fixed place
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:53:35 So it's very good at surface wiping
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:53:47 Aka it's good at killing everything that's on land and water
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:54:10 No it flies
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:54:50 Though it's also decent at killing slower builds
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:55:05 Like ones that travel only 300 sps (and isn't chasing me)
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:55:42 Except mine can do it way more quickly
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:55:49 because turret
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:57:45 You respawned doe <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:58:22 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:58:25 "friendly"
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:58:45 I don't use motor locks
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:58:54 And yes it can't survive because helium
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:58:55 oh
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 12:59:33 Though I get the advantage of no warp speed limit hehe
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 13:23:11 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 13:23:17 Make your plane as fast as possible
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 13:35:13 o h n o
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 14:07:08 ?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 14:07:13 What u making?
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 14:07:28 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 14:07:52 Ye I heard of that car because of vehicle simulator
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 14:08:03 Was extremely fast with nitro boost
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 14:15:33 ~~Call an ambulance then nub~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 15:01:16 Self racism
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 15:01:52 I like your kanji text funny japanese man
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 15:02:09 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:44:07 Wdym if it works then it’s good
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:44:35 Pog
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:44:57 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:45:03 Jk
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:45:42 I remember 1 dude got a boat that went 10k sps
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:47:26 Though impressive such a speed is unnecessary especially since the size of the ocean is small (for now, cuz a future update will feature b i g map)
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:47:52 Yes I just woke up
plane-crazy 2021-04-15 23:48:32 Pog

plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:25:09 How fast doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:25:33 That's below average speed .-.
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:25:54 Ok that's fine now
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:26:12 good speed is like 600 sps btw
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:26:45 Boi 1 heli was blasting off at I suppose 600-700 sps last time
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:26:55 ~~Because it was a plane/helicopter hybrid~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:27:18 Good luck with shredders and planes doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:27:29 Though I suppose tanks are nothing
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:28:55 Hey wanna do some surface wiping with me later on?
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:29:01 Aka blowing up land vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:29:06 and sea vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:29:18 And maybe some shredders and other helis
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:29:25 You deal with the planes for me thx
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:45:20 Maybe try pinging an admin for this?
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:45:51 That's how roblox lag works
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:46:06 Also is that pvp?
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:46:31 
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:47:33 The best thing I can make is this
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:48:26 Welp anyways bruh when class e n d
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:48:31 I wanna build the Horizon already
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:48:33 thx
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:48:46 Soon they will
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:49:24 
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:49:39 Ok I'm spamming an emoji too much now
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:50:42 Don't worry I also still suck at making planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:50:50 Due to p h y s i c s
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:51:22 Actually that's a nice plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:51:33 You haven't seen mine yet
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:53:33 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:53:38 For a while only
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:54:19 
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:54:25 Look at my old plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:54:50 And a less older plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:58:10 He used RoSearch
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:59:15 Yes
y e z
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:59:29 Wait I still can't see anything yet
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:59:37 I can't see s t r e a m
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 00:59:38 AAA
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:00:08 Also i gotta admit: I have shredder bugs
Though they're better than the average shredder and I came up of the design myself
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:00:16 And they don't work anymore
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:00:17 cuz lag
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:00:42 lug

plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:01:43 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:01:46 **Plane**
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:02:09 Well if your "plane" can beat up other builds then it's good
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:02:19 If it can't then you need to change it
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:02:31 He's asking you to motor lock because pro
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:02:46 idk
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:03:08 Why do I understand redstone but still don't know how to motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:03:17 
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:03:34 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:10:24 <@!458393019968651265> then stop streaming
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:10:31 You'll need the extra fps during pvp
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:11:19 No u not
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:11:49 Idc if you can make something that works then it's good
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:13:03 Well someone could make the most glorious looking build but it's slow can't even destroy a simple spam car
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:13:30 While someone else can make a build capable of destroying anything in it's path
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:13:53 wot
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:14:10 Sure screenshot it cuz I can't see anything in the stream
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:15:09 Noice
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:15:23 Wait I suggest putting several turrets at different places
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:15:34 So that in case 1 dies you still have turrets
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:15:36 And pog
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:16:27 sup

plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:17:53 And use diamond plate only
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:17:59 Cuz diamond plate is like the strongest block
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:18:03 I mean material

plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:57:40 But it could've been helpful
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:58:02 People only get ranks because of good builds
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:58:32 But people don't get ranks because of functional builds
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:58:44 Yes it is
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:59:16 Boi you need to have some humor
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:59:20 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 01:59:58 It's called humor
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:00:15 Wait how does a gen z not have strange humor?
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:00:54 if you add them you can distract people because of the glamorous feet
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:01:02 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:01:13 Cya
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:01:39 agreed
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:02:03 Have you heard about the different types of quarks?
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:02:37 What about strange and charm quarks?
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:03:01 
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:03:20 Quarks with warp drive
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:03:25 Oh wait that's just photons
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:04:07 ~~No you put a shredder bug~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:04:18 Wait I wonder if there's any IRL build that acts like a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:04:24 You know, shred through ships
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:05:07 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:05:43 They're annoying little builds that go through ships and cut them in half
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:05:50 Not even flex tape can stop them
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:06:13 Wait how you in discord and roblox at the same time in mobile?
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:06:19 **H o w ?**
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:06:34 Nu this blobfishblob dude
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:06:52 Ah yes pc
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:07:05 Why you emulating roblox mobile in a pc
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:09:21 But imagine in the future
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:09:26 Flying chainsaws
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:09:32 in the sky
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:09:50 Shredder bugs irl that can cause maximum destruction
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:10:24 Actually that's a bit more realistic compared to flying chainsaws
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:11:01 Exactly now we're doing it to buildings
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:12:06 imagine not using tnt armor barrel smh
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:13:51 Assuming we don't kill ourselves in this present day then yes they could happen
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:14:26 Though they are smaller compared to the wars in the past
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:15:05 🐒
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:15:52 It's not only cool it's cold
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:16:21 Though the problem is space can't conduct heat because no air
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:18:02 What about lightness though
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:18:05 graphene is very light
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:19:03 What about inertia doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:19:31 Heavier objects are harder to move
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:19:55 Fuel consumption is also an issue
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:20:09 You can't just have infinite fuel source
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:21:07 Idk how centrifugal force causes gravity but yes we need spinny craft
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:22:21 The I guess we gonna do the wall e thing and have chairs that move across the spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:22:30 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:22:47 No without the hover
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:23:33 Not all the day doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:23:50 There should be like activity center in spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:23:53 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:24:30 Imagine spending roux on gravity slider when you can just use helium
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:24:43 person becomes rubber boi
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:25:16 Oh ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:25:28 So I guess spinny thing is the best option
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:26:14 ~~Shredder bug~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:26:33 Anyways but what will be the main power source?
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:26:47 I can't because I suck at pvp
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:26:59 I'm going for a fusion reactor
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:27:03 huh w o t
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:27:10 antimatter
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:27:14 reactor?
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:27:33 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:27:56 I was thinking we could use anti matter for propulsion instead of main power source
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:28:11 Like the waste product of fusion reactors mix with the anti matter
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:28:12 oh
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:28:28 big brain
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:28:45 I mean just make sure they don't touch matter and they don't explode
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:29:04 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:30:03 https://www.google.com/search?safe=strict&sxsrf=ALeKk03d607aQPEwIzIou3dENp9ZS4frzg:1618540172495&q=How+is+antimatter+stored&spell=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi3z6SA3IHwAhXRaN4KHcJUD8EQBSgAegQIARAw&biw=1680&bih=874

Well some smart people figured out how to contain anti matter
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:32:03 Maybe an on-board anti matter generator that converts half of the fusion waste into anti matter?
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:32:17 Then later on they combine in the engine for propulsion
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:32:49 
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:33:05 Assuming the anti matter cat doesn't explode because of our atmosphere
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:34:49 So first we have fusion reactor the gives electricity to the spaceship
Then we have random device that converts half of the fusion waste products into antimatter and stores the other half normally
Then later on the 2 combine in the engine for propulsion
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:35:03 I geuss
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:35:08 And idk how anti matter is made brb
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:35:30 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:36:39 Plus nuclear waste
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:36:42 Wait hold on
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:36:47 lemme look in other websites too
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:37:59 Cool but there's a chance a spaceship needs to last longer than that
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:38:21 bruv
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:39:02 How does the impostor sabotage the nuclear reactor and cause a meltdown
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:39:12 Without being in nuclear reactor
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:39:57 Or fusion
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:40:25 Also fusion reactors can't meltdown unlike their uranium buddies

plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:42:29 huh
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:42:31 wait lemme google
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:43:31 The only way to defeat them is to eject them to outer space
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:43:57 You said impostor was immortal
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:44:04 So gun is useless
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:45:47 The impostor literally has a tummy mouth
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:47:44 So basically the Alcubierre drive has a white hole behind it and a black hole in front of it
idk how to make a better explanation for this
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:48:18 Oh e
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:48:59 sus
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:49:10 Now the Charity is playing amogus irl
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:50:14 Eject them
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:50:31 The police is everywhere
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:50:41 Except in your house
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:51:43 sus
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:53:01 Then that's not the police that's the FBI
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:53:56 Cuz FBI spy not police
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:54:40 ~~Also I accessed the secret information hidden in the pentagon~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:54:54 CIA spies outside the US
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:54:58 FBI spies inside the US
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:55:28 Imagine if their roles are switched or they actually have the same roles
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:55:31 We can never know
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:55:40 Unless we force the entire world population to
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:55:59 Ah yes the Earth
The oldest anarchy server in the world
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:56:19 Yes that was intentional
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:56:46 I would know because I don't smell any vodka
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:56:59 Za warudo

plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:57:31 This chat is non-binary
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:57:39 Actually all chats are non-binary
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:58:17 Using A's and B's instead of 0's and 1's
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:58:29 **Y E S !**
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:58:50 Not my problem their IQ is lower than that of a single bacteria
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:58:58 data
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 02:59:39 Cya
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:00:36 Or am I?
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:00:56 Jojo is jojo not anime
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:01:07 Though demon slayer is jojo reference anime
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:01:31 Exactly
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:01:37 Jojo is jojo anime not anime
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:01:57 Jojo anime specifically
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:02:52 Eh I only know jojo and demon slayer (after learning demon slayer has hamon breathing)
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:02:59 dorime
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:03:20 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:03:25 But they're basically just hamon
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:03:43 It's a way of breathing that replicates the ripples of the sun
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:03:55 That's why it's also called the ripple
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:03:59 Sometimes called Sendo
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:05:10 Idk could be biased but demons cannot even touch Joseph or they get burned by portable sunlight energy
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:05:33 Especially their blood demon arts
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:05:36 Actually nvm
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:05:46 Some blood demon arts don't require physical contact
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:06:00 Y e z
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:07:20 Nu it's impossible unless you do an asspull
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:07:49 Like what Joseph did in the final fight with Kars

plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:09:35 Wot is it
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:09:50 Why not infinite spin
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:09:57 Oh wait that would cause infinite gravity
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:11:52 Does C moon create it's own gravity and replace the old one or does it simply just shift the gravity?
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:11:54 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:12:52 And I only watched demon slayer because it has a jojo reference
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:12:56 *h a m o n*
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:14:13 Side characters are a jojo reference
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:14:31 We are side characters
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:14:43 Pog
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:15:26 He's a new player
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:16:07 Go plan a design in your head
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:16:11 After that build it
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:16:28 After that request for feedback in <#504436696021204992>
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:16:38 After that go teach Tanjiro how to hamon breath
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:17:26 Oofers
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:17:31 But you can request for feedback doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:17:46 Actually you can ask people on what to build
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:17:56 Ask people how to make your build better
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:18:28 Nepal is secretly just a giant spaceship that happens to be dormant for 20000 years
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:18:42 It should soon awaken in never
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:19:07 Also if people say to just delete your build don't listen to them unless they give a decent reason
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:21:11 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:21:13 bad photoshops
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:22:02 Even white avdol can do better than this
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:23:58 remove the y and u in your
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 03:26:53 Age is just a number
Prison is just a place

plane-crazy 2021-04-16 04:16:53 That’s only the case in Alabama
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 05:03:46 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 05:05:27 The lettuce is also sourced straight from burger king

plane-crazy 2021-04-16 08:56:56 oof
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 08:57:24 Anyways it's hard for land vehicles to kill flying stuff anyways
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 08:57:27 except helicopters
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 09:08:14 Aight gonna make this big chonker over here
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 09:30:42 Guys should I go wingless or have wings in my Horizoom?
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 10:56:00 Boi I think my Horizon is gonna be too large it won't be able to fit in 1 plot
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 10:56:11 
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 11:08:32 amooogus
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 12:01:39 Apparently I'm almost done making the hull of the Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 13:47:33 
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 13:47:36 
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 13:47:50 I'm still not done putting the turning and helium stuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 14:14:03 Bruh my ship is so big that warp drives don't work anymore
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 14:14:10 
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 14:18:14 It's 1423 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 14:18:41 Wait maybe if I start putting helium now
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 14:18:48 Oh it's a spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 14:18:52 Not a boat
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 14:19:14 Wait maybe if I start putting helium
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 14:19:18 I'm using grav slider rn
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 14:19:36 Just to see how sell it would work
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 15:42:16 Poggers more people are making sci-fi ships
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 15:42:39 Though creations is still dominated by tanks and boats and planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 15:44:57 Guys I finally finished it: The Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 15:45:24 Though while it's the fastest ship in starscape it's slower than my drone battleship and can't even warp properly
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 15:45:34 
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 15:52:41 Pog
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 15:53:20 Btw this is my radix attempt long time ago
creations-chat 2021-04-16 16:02:02 Shredder bugs

Also another thing: The actual one from starscape has the turrets outside the ship
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 16:14:02 Apparently my horizon is good at killing planes now
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 16:14:08 Compared to my drone battleship
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 16:14:41 Probably because of the major lag reduction
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 16:14:52 Even though it has more parts than the drone battleship
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 16:19:25 Actually nvm
plane-crazy 2021-04-16 17:15:00 Hey who wanna 1v1 with my new spaceship?

plane-crazy 2021-04-17 01:33:43 Well maybe the pros might come up with something very interesting out of a boring idea
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 01:33:48 pog

plane-crazy 2021-04-17 01:36:09 Also another question that you don't need to answer: What makes planes interesting to you?
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 01:36:50 
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 01:37:15 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 01:37:20 Now can we pvp rn?

plane-crazy 2021-04-17 01:45:05 
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 01:45:23 <@!637781561277677582>
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 01:46:30 The green robux hat, the pistola guns, the TBC hat, the salad hat, the bacon hair, and the lady of the federation necklace
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 01:46:46 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 01:52:09 well last time I misread your name as "iFukinGamingHD"
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 02:22:15 because control panel
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 02:23:01 Imagine using wings
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 02:29:47 hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 02:34:26 Bruh i still can't kill planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 02:35:44 Even a starter plane can beat me up :painandsorrow:
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 02:36:06 Boi I aim at the planes themselves but the turrets shoot somewhere else
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 03:24:58 Thing
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 03:32:05 how?
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 11:14:15 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/832910637596147722 3k blocks? Are you using beams or just 1x1 blocks?
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 11:15:16 Also if you don't use beams you need to
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 11:15:23 It reduces lag as well
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 15:43:12 Apparently my Horizon has tier 2 anti-shredder capabilities
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 15:43:20 MAybe even tier 3
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 15:43:21 idk
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 15:45:30 Type of shredders you can kill
From a single fast shredder to an entire fleet of a extremely fast shredders
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 15:46:31 In my own scale tier 2 means you can fend off against an extremely fast shredder or at least 5 shredders while taking moderate to no damage
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 15:48:31 While tier 1 means you can only fend off against a 1-2 shredders while taking moderate to no damage
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 15:49:35 Whatever works better
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 15:54:14 Mobile support came out so it's likely there will be xbox support
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 15:54:59 Also my Horizon is definitely tier 2 anti-shredder not tier 3
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 15:55:31 Yes I don't have nitro so I use images for emojis
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:00:02 Boi it took me 6 hours to make my creation
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:00:08 It only got 30 upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:00:22 But hey at least it has a decent upvotes/downvotes ratio
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:00:34 I know
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:01:14 Aka the fastest vehicle simulator vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:01:45 Just create a plane lmao
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:01:49 Planes get the most upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:01:53 and boats
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:02:07 I guess planes get more upvotes than boats doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:02:13 Well, most of the time

plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:04:00 Boi it isn't

plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:04:53 It's very rare to see creations breaking the 120 upvote barrier
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:05:14 Let alone trying to break the 90 upvote barrier
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:05:22 People like planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:05:41 Even a starter plane got a ton of upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:05:52 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/749884339965395004 also you haven't seen true garbage
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:06:00 Check out my first wingless creation
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:06:52 Wait I guess it's because of activity
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:07:06 More people were around during the posting of that top image
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:07:52 Minor difference especially since the upvote numbers are very big
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:08:42 If it was like 80-160 I guess that's true
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:08:58 But once you're reaching big numbers like 200 or maybe 300 it doesn't even matter anymore
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:09:06 :)))))
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:14:59 A triangle is literally just a typhoon
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:15:37 Nice plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:27:28 Me on my way going to kill shredder bugs and other stuff because I can:
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:27:39 Me when a plane joins the server:
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:28:13 Yes it's absolutely normal
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:29:09 From what I heard blocks are 2.5 studs
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:29:15 1 meter is 20 studs
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:29:20 Wait lemme do the math
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:33:00 According to my math, you are travelling at 2 .25 km/h assuming you travel 5 blocks per second and every block is 2.5 studs

The math behind it: 5 x 2.5 = 12.5 /20 = 0.625 x 60 = 37.5 x 60 = 2250 / 1000 = 2.25

blocks converted to studs converted to meters per second converted to meters per minute converted to meters per hour converted to km/h
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:33:15 It's just multiplication and division
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:33:28 No need for complex algebra that i can't understand
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:33:33 Because I suck at math
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:34:17 0.125 meters
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:34:24 2.5 / 20 is your answer
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:34:52 BUT that is assuming 1 block = 2.5 studs
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:34:55 From what I've heard
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:36:53 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:38:10 True
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:38:20 Even a tutorial plane beated up my Horizon spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:38:42 And the Horizon spaceship is a destroyer class
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:39:01 If you're a plane then yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:39:24 Wot is it
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:39:44 You can't shoot down my Horizon doe :))))
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:39:54 Imagine using inches
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:40:03 Jk
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:40:35 Anyways ye roblox characters s m o l
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:41:50 And literally I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:42:07 You know, change the size of studs and all of that
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:42:44 Well if we will have 1 meter tall robloxians, that will probably make 1 meter 5 studs instead of 20
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:42:55 My guess doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:42:56 idk
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:44:23 ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:44:58 Because yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:45:28 Rate my garbage innovation inc security trench coat thing
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:45:47 Very blurry and low quality
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:45:58 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:46:36 Yes I have done a good job of ruining the security trench coat
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:46:56 I'm dying in the outside
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:47:00 ~~wait holup~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:47:27 I spend the whole day playing plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:47:34 I'm still 14 that's why
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:48:24 Brace yourselves the discord mods are coming
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:49:10 DM me pic pls
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:49:18 You send messages
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:51:14 My best build
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:51:20 It;s only this
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:54:28 Yes plane is the ultimate race
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:54:38 Nothing can beat plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:55:27 Huh how
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:55:46 They should probably add spaceship engineer that allows the usage of helium
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:56:30 Yes new map
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:57:00 We need more biomes
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:57:25 And land forms

RIver deltas, swamps, forest, plains
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:57:34 Oh wait no
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:57:44 Ye it would cause severe lag
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:58:16 True
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:58:27 Huh new physics?
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:58:44 :painandsorrow:
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:59:02 
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:00:03 https://tenor.com/view/sus-gif-20302681
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:00:18 Sussy sussus
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:02:06 It's a tank that can jump ez as that
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:02:45 Lemme guess: You sinked the ship
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:03:13 Oh alright
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:03:30 Anyways Ima convert an old build into a ship sinker
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:03:38 Because i can
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:04:07 Ah yes motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:51:04 Guys what rank can my Horizon spaceship give me?
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:51:17 Other than designer
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:52:26 :spainwithoutthes:
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:52:53 I did
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:52:59 Cuz my ship is wingless
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:53:10 Smart
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:53:32 If it was that easy
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:53:56 Cuz I still suck with wing placement
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:57:05 Wait is a suggestion for starship engineer a good suggestion
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:57:28 Idk if I sound that desperate for an easy way to get a level 5 rank but ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:59:16 Also maybe such rank could encourage players to build more starships (not rocketships)
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 18:00:21 It’s rare to find one in servers
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 00:50:24 Good morning annoying Shredder bug users and plane people
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 00:51:06 A very few amount of people in this server use shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 00:51:23 But like only 1% of shredder bug users in this server talk here
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 00:51:24 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 00:52:05 Well at least my Horizon spaceship can fend of and kill shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 00:52:29 Idk why it can do that but can't even kill a starter plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 00:52:47 wait is that even normal
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 00:53:28 Guys is it even normal I can build spaceships but can't even build a good looking plane that actually works?
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 00:53:55 I mean making the wings are just too hard for me
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 01:01:15 Oof
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 01:03:17 
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 01:04:01 When my warp drive in my drone battleship failed which made my turrets go crazy and because of crazy turrets I got blasted off to eternity
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 01:18:56 Oh lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 01:19:14 Wait do you have a spaceship too? <@!744357097000665088>
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 01:20:05 It's a charged shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 01:20:24 You know like the creepers when tehy get struck by lightning
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 01:20:32 They become more powerful
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 01:21:22 Pog
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 01:21:24 Wait can I see
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 01:21:59 Ah alright
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:31:40 It would also lead to stupid instances of you getting kicked out for stupid reasons like trying to stop a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:32:30 Also could lead to the formation of gangs votekicking everyone out of the server
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:33:46 You haven't seen YBA yet :)))))
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:34:02 Also free draw 2 is a casual game, no pvp combat
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:34:08 Which also means no raging kids
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:34:31 My spaceship but use wings instead of helium
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:35:15 Yes I heard it
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:37:07 But like just have 6 "gang members" join the server and you will have the ability to kick whoever you want to
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:37:41 ~~star wars?~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:38:13 Ok :(
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:39:17 Hey have you heard of the new shredder ball in pvp servers?
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:39:57 Ye the first shredder ball instance I've ever seen was in like back in November
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:40:03 It's only just now it became popular
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:41:13 Wait can you also beat up shredder balls?
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:41:47 I can beat up one but I can't do it without taking severe damage
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:42:03 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:42:26 Oh I'm in my Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:42:28 Not in a plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:43:02 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:43:47 Anyways I upgraded my horizon to have 600 sps max speed compard to 290 sps max
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:44:02 Plus I have a warp drive so maybe next time I could easily beat up a shredder ball?
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:44:22 Haven't tested it yet because I can't find any shredder balls
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:44:46 I mean they would only be going in 1 direction
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:45:21 Oh cool
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:45:44 I choose to **s n i p e**
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:46:26 And lava spitters in case they get too close
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:46:47 Yez
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:47:01 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:47:14 Fireworks don't really work when I travel fast
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:47:18 Like they shoot somewhere else
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:47:26 instead of where my cursor is pointing at
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:48:54 Ye they don't fire where I'm pointing at
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:49:01 They shoot at like the sides
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:49:47 No no that's not what I'm talking about
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:49:56 Like they're shooting at a different direction
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:50:58 Of course they aren't guided missiles
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:52:09 ALso your plane can kill shredder bugs without taking any damage ryt
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:52:32 LIke 0 damage
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:52:38 Not a single block lost
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:52:39 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:53:11 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/771366664293187614
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:53:17 Link to Quinjet
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:53:24 Prototype doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:55:35 Oofers
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:58:46 Don't build it then
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:58:51 FOr now
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:58:55 Build something else
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 03:59:33 Like practice on a smaller plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 04:43:02 Aight I am back from taking 37 minute shower now I'm gonan eat 1 plate of rice and egg for maybe at least 1 hour
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 04:43:14 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 04:43:18 Wot is it
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 04:47:03 Hmm not sure sorry
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 05:09:29 Huh plane crazy factions?
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 08:46:23 Nooo I got killed my a plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 08:46:29 
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 08:47:33 Imagine a gamemode where-in 10 people 1v1 each other to the death and if you die you lose your build
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 08:47:52 While the risk is high, the reward is also high
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 08:48:00 Which is no removed block limit for the winner
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 08:48:31 That means you can have more than 10 guns, 100 magnets, 2k blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 08:52:42 True but I have an anti-shredder build in my mind but idk how to do it

Like it's just gonna be a flying box coated with tnt armor and like a shredder it flies where ever your cursor points at
And since shredder bugs can't break the tnt armor you can just shoot it down while it does it's futile attempt in trying to kill your build
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 08:52:58 In my own anti-shredder tier list it's gonna be tier 4 on the scale
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 08:53:46 Which means it should be able to kill all forms of shredders with little to no damage
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 08:54:14 Why so much speakers
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 08:54:39 Ah yes propaganda now time to brainwash innocent people because we can
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 08:54:49 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 08:58:04 what are you trying to make?
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 09:44:41 FINALLY MY HORIZON CAN KILL PLANES NOW
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 09:45:13 At the cost of the major weakness being to scattered turrets
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 10:14:55 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 10:15:11 Also I beated another one
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 10:15:21 And I got beated by a plane again
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 10:15:40 Warp doesn't work in horizon
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 10:15:44 the new ship I have
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 10:15:53 I mean it does but it's weak
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 10:16:01 Compared to the one in the drone battleship
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 10:16:29 But at least it's better at killing shredders doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 10:16:31 idk
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 10:17:08 No it takes entire map to go 3k
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 10:17:30 Hey wanna 1v1 rn or can't
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 10:17:37 e
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 10:17:47 Your pvp one
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 10:17:59 Yez
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 10:18:14 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 10:18:36 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 10:18:47 What's up with fabric
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:09:21 https://tenor.com/view/epic-embed-fail-win-discord-gif-20242609
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:11:44 Actually nvm my Horizon still tier 2 anti shredder
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:12:32 basically adds friction to your build
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:12:43 Very effective in small wingless creations like my radix
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:12:57 So it doesn't just go slidy slidy
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:13:22 You never were
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:13:35 Also anyone here who has an anti-shredder?
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:13:53 People love planes that's why
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:14:28 
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:14:44 Guys who has an anti-shredder
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:14:50 Intentional or unintentional
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:15:13 They're ineffective
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:15:22 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:15:56 Boi I standed near a cutter nuke and I came out unscathed
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:16:30 Shredder gets shredded
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:16:38 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:17:23 Or just build a spaceship and somehow discover that your ship has anti-shredder properties
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:17:57 Actually big builds seem to be rather shredder resistant
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:18:28 Then why can my drone battleship and Horizon beat up shredder bugs while taking minimum damage
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:18:54 Gotta have that high DPS hehe
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:19:08 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:19:48 Though design kinda matters like my Horizon has like a few gaps that trap and immobilize some shredder therefore allowing me to shoot it
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:19:57 Idk how to explain it
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:20:15 Wait lemme send screenshot
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:20:23 
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:20:35 Actually they are e
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:20:44 But I doubt they have the ability to kill them doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:21:31 Unless it's a shredder ball
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:21:58 Ye by then speed is more important than size
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:22:41 Wait can we go in a pvp server
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:22:46 I wanna test out my shredder
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:22:48 on you
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:22:52 To see
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:22:57 Oofers
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:23:45 I mean just remove the lag and they're gonan be f a s t
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:24:43 Yes and ~~Chinese CIA members are now coming to your location~~ Whinnie the pooh is gonna share some honey
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:26:28 ***(Clicks deny but still proceeds to share location)***
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:26:57 Which of course isn't epico and I need to get ready
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:27:05 Wait brb someone's knocking in the door
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:27:10 AFK

plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:30:09 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:30:40 Anyways so ye small stuff are basically shredder resistant but not anti-shredder
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:31:27 Maybe
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:31:39 Wait I'll join and test it rn
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:31:43 if you are in game
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:31:57 Aight

plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:40:07 sports
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:40:41 I guess nobody else has spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:42:01 Also spaceship engineer rank when
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:42:10 Not rocket scientist rank
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:42:33 Spaceships are like the futuristic ones with strange design choices
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:42:58 Rocket ships are basically fast cylinders
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:45:16 ~~spaceflgiht simulator~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:45:37 But ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:46:24 Wait idk what the general requirements should be for spaceship engineer e
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:51:35 Try setting a keybind for that
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:51:48 since there are keybinds for literally everything
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:52:34 It's the fastest vehicle in vehicle simulator, 10/10
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:53:24 Idk never tried to open doors using click
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:53:36 And yes let's test out your anti-shredder
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:53:48 And I'll give out my rating after that test
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:54:08 tier 1 anti-shredder to tier 5
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 12:54:34 oofers
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:12:56 Bruh now I have to build my Horizon again
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:13:08 There goes another 6 hours of pain trying to get the thing to work
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:13:48 No I very broke
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:14:02 Wait there's a build transfer system? Cool.
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:14:33 Just go wingless and use helium and propellers to turn
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:14:44 Wings are too complex anyways
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:15:17 rocket propulsion
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:15:39 How fast?
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:15:54 pog
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:17:49 Yuz
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:17:55 Idk sorry
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:17:59 I'm very garbage at planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:18:12 Nu idk
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:18:25 Why am I good at making spaceships but so trash at making a simple plane?
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:19:00 Like i can't even make a good looking plane let alone make it work properly
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:19:13 Sup
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:19:29 Does it have tix inside it?
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:19:51 "Chinese finger"

plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:21:54 Wait screenshot us what happened

What if you wanted to get designer rank V

But 10 people said: **Daga Kotowaru.**
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:29:28 
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:38:09 Like it loads a different save instead of the one you want to load?
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:38:30 I think it's because you didn't name them properly
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:38:54 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:39:04 I don't even know how to motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:39:33 Apparently motor locking is easier than minecraft redstone :/
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:40:11 I don't get the mechanics
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:40:23 Yes I mess around with redstone
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:40:32 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:41:23 ~~**DO IT OR I KILL YOU AND STEAL ALL YOUR PERSONAL BELONGINGS**~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:41:35 There some very nice motivation
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:42:46 But hey when you finish it you might accidentally make a very OP land vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:42:49 <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:42:59 Maybe even create an anti-shredder by accident
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:44:12 At least a tier 2 anti-shredder build should be good enough to discourage shredder attacks on your build
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:46:11 That means you accidentally saved your boat into the helicopter slot
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:46:14 happened to me once
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:46:18 
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:52:42 Now put a pole in the middle and donut yourself
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:54:16 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 01:55:36 You could expand your brain but are you getting more neurons? Or are you just increasing it's volume
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 02:04:22 You also need Myelin so nerve impulses can't jaywalk for no apparent reason
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 02:04:33 Sup
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 02:11:45 Nah it ain't weird
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 02:59:56 🅱️lane 🅱️razy
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 03:02:12 I mean you did make an assumption too early soooo
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 03:02:13 ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:04:49 YOu're not alone
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:05:00 I can't even make a good looking plane without sacrificing function
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:05:24 Actually I can't even make a good looking plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:05:41 
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:08:45 Calm down he's just a kid
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:08:56 He'll learn it soon
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:09:03 Oh oof
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:09:33 Ye just have some patience lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:18:01 Yep it's good

plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:19:41 Let's talk about borders
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:19:47 And ideologies
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:19:58 and get warned for being a chinese activist
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:20:27 Pog
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:21:33 I guess it's safe to unleash the r u d e now I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:21:41 Also your builds aren't bad
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:21:48 You haven't seen my builds yet
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:22:31 Like my builds are soo bad that the Horizon and drone battleship are the only good builds I have
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:23:07 At least you know how to make a plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:25:21 water godzilla
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:25:36 Rip your fps
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:25:47 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:29:29 motor rock
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:30:09 Can I explode your build?
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:34:14 A very fitting name with a very fitting video
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:35:54 ~~Do you want me to go make a lag machine and lag the server?~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:36:22 t u r r e t s
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:36:28 Like scattered turrets
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:36:32 Not like 1 big turret
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:37:42 We need to make a dedicated anti-plane build now
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:39:55 Cameras seem useless
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:40:02 For viewing stuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:40:09 not for like folding and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:40:33 Ah yes the power of 10000 WPM typing
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:41:13 Ye but imagine if you can actually type that fast
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:41:24 Actually who wanna do a WPM race for no reason lmao
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:41:38 **gun sounds intensifies**
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:41:41 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 04:42:11 <@!155149108183695360> Go away you're ruining the fun

plane-crazy 2021-04-19 05:44:24 What's that for
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 05:45:32 Ye ik basically the stuff that reduces most of the friction but I mean I don't see any purpose of it in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 05:45:43 Cuz I haven't built anything other than fictional spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 05:45:53 
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 05:46:01 Can't rn, later I will
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 05:46:12 Motor 1 isn't frictionless
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 05:46:58 I mean like it stops way too quickly
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 05:47:19 Pog
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 05:47:33 **Now screenshot proof**
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 05:47:39 Later

plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:24:45 jk
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:24:51 I suck at planes anyways
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:25:57 <@!200793484053970944> You aren't streaming or you forgot to leave voice call
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:34:38 Oh I see
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:35:06 No wonder why a ton of planes basically just obliterate my Horizon but I can't even kill anything in my plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:35:07 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:35:20 or maybe the turning is too much
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:35:56 Because yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:38:10 The plane crazy collective consciousness has decided your fate
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:39:08 Which is you don't get designer IV or designer V
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:48:20 Quiet down mortal, reality can be whatever I want
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:48:30 Anyways I believe he just spammed the flip button lmao
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:49:29 ~~Because you use emojis~~ have you checked the "explode on impact" property?
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:49:53 Maybe it's turned off
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:49:55 Oof
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:50:00 Maybe try slowing it down a bit
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:50:11 I have 14 days lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:50:30 I have around 4.67 times more playtime than u
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 07:51:26 We need flak turrets
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 11:26:13 Hey who has an anti-plane build in here?
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 11:26:20 if you do, can you get online?
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 11:26:24 While I deal with a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 11:26:43 I hate it when non-shredders kill me while I'm murdering some shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 14:45:51 lokk
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 14:51:51 I thought this was the starscape discord server for a while
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 15:06:26 MAKE IT NIGHT
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 15:06:29 Oops caps
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 15:06:31 But still
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 15:06:40 make it night so we can see the details
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 15:14:05 Don't you like it when you forget to clear your old message in roblox and now the message you've sent is almost incomprehensible?
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 15:14:57 *"Hello guys I made aOH MY THERE'S A SHREDDER"*
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 15:15:44 Wghen the impostor is sussy sussus
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 16:20:29 8/10
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 16:22:09 You spat out facts which can't be argued with but it doesn't have that little "burn" essence that one of best insults have
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 16:22:12 idk how to explain it
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 16:22:16 I suck at explaining
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 16:25:28 Idk I've played in plane crazy alpha for like 1 day and then played the game again the next year
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 16:26:11 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 16:31:18 ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 16:32:03 But just maybe doe since he blacklisted which means I can go through his dart bullet looking shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 16:32:20 <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 16:51:31 They're too scared to touch my Horizoom
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 16:52:32 Idk but piston lock allows you to be very energetic that just simply touching your build will fling your victim to the abyss
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 16:54:24 Basically half pistons have a ton of energy
plane-crazy 2021-04-19 16:59:36 Ah yes budget mumbo
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 01:36:52 GOOD MORNING gays and lesbians
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 01:37:12 Nice gun does it actually rapid fire?
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 01:37:57 Welcome back to your house
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 01:38:03 <@!511559470376026135>
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 01:39:33 Oh lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 02:42:17 (SPS) x 0.18
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 02:42:23 COnverts it to km/h
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 02:42:34 To convert it to mph go do it in an online converter lmao
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 02:42:52 Np
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 02:43:38 You should be travelling at 17150 sps
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 02:43:55 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 02:48:53 Also btw how I got 0.18:

1/20/1000x60x60
sps to m/s to km/s to km/m to km/h
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 02:49:07 Forgot to place that there
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 02:56:48 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 02:57:04 Roblox studs are bigger than lego studs
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 02:57:56 EH since robloxians are 25 centimeters tall and 100 centimeters is 1 meter
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 02:58:06 I guess 5 studs would be 1 meter instead
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 02:58:08 instead of 20
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 02:58:19 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 02:58:33 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:00:00 https://www.google.com/search?q=average+human+height&oq=Average+human+height&aqs=edge.0.0l7.3805j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:00:17 Average height for both men and women is 165.25
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:00:19 cm
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:00:53 Ah alr
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:02:13 Ok so 170 cm / 25 cm = 6.8
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:02:31 so 20 /6.8 is about 2.95
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:02:45 Actually it's just a bunch of decimals at the end
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:02:47 https://www.google.com/search?q=20%2F6.8&safe=strict&sxsrf=ALeKk03i8VJBZZ7_jdwpbthGH3R1DbV08g%3A1618887673164&ei=-UN-YMnYCY3emAXpuI34BQ&oq=20%2F6.8&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yAggAOgcIIxDqAhAnOgUIABCRAlDmIViCNmC0OWgBcAB4AIABoAGIAZ4FkgEDMC41mAEAoAEBoAECqgEHZ3dzLXdperABCsABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwiJucLF6ovwAhUNL6YKHWlcA18Q4dUDCA4&uact=5
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:03:01 But rounded off it's 2.95
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:03:09 Actually
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:03:10 2.94
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:03:37 Wait brb
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:05:30 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:05:32 It is
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:05:37 <@!200793484053970944>
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:07:56 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:08:04 <@!582834773773254656> What's your formula?
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:08:17 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:08:26 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:08:54 Oh we're using average human height (170 cm)
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:09:21 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:11:34 2.5 studs from what I've heard
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:11:45 You're not alone
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:12:00 I also suck at math don't worry
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:12:44 Also I think I had an error

Cuz when I try converting mach 1 to life sized sps we get 857.5 sps
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:12:54 formula is sps / 1.44
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:13:08 Search online I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:13:59 Yes we're converting km/h to sps assuming a robloxian is 170 cm tall compared to 25 cm
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:14:09 ez
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:14:15 Hmm
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:15:47 Oh huh
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:15:53 I was using km/h the whole time
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:16:11 1/20/1000x60x60

Also assuming that robloxians are life sized you just replace 20 with 2.5
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:17:08 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:17:52 Also the simplified version of my formula is sps x 1.44
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:18:05 assuming robloxians are 2 meters tall
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:18:25 Wait I forgot the simplified formula for 170 cm tall robloxians brb
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:19:30 Ok so it's sps x 1.2245
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:20:39 For the 170 cm tall robloxians ryt
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:20:50 Aight lemme try
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:22:50 Ok so idk if I did it correctly but mach 1 is equivalent to 419 sps
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:23:36 Wait can you try it yourself too?
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:23:44 Aight cya
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:23:56 cya
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:34:21 Just looked at my messages and I've noticed I become very active when the discussion gets rather mathematical or theoretical
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:34:55 Try motor locking
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:35:09 Idk how to do it because I"ve never needed to but just watch a yt vid
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:35:41 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 03:36:06 But motor locking crams a ton of blocks too .-.
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 04:39:53 Don’t you hate it when people who aren’t using shredders till support shredders?
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 04:40:12 Like they kill stuff even though they aren’t shredders even when a shredder is in the server
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 04:41:45 Like my spaceship alone can beat up a ton of shredders no problem
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 04:42:12 But then just add a plane or any stuff that’s very small and agile and I basically die
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 04:42:30 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 05:25:23 Nice

What if you wanted to get designer IV

But the plane crazy hivemind decided to say: **Daga Kotowaru.**
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 05:34:00 <@!673476681159147540> You have an unclaimed level IV designer rank
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 06:49:24 Pro
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 09:26:21 I think I know why my Horizon is so anti-shredder
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 09:26:28 It's not because of sheer size
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 09:26:34 but because of it's design
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 09:26:49 Like there's a ton of places in my Horizon that shredders can get stuck in
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 09:27:13 and places for step brother to come in :))))))
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 09:31:03 FINALLY SHREDDER GAVE UP
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 09:31:34 thx
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:00:31 Guys I need help
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:00:42 I wanna use a shredder even if i don't want to
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:00:47 pls send help
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:05:43 no pls
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:06:54 Still thought I can make a new one but my Horizoom will suffer
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:07:06 Also btw I am capable of actually building stuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:07:18 
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:08:01 As long as you're not using it for trolling purposes then it's fine
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:08:41 ***Do you want me to kill ur shredder?***
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:09:26 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:10:23 sup
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:10:34 Guys who has anti-shredders?
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:10:39 Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:10:42 From starscape
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:11:49 Anyways wanna see my anti-shredder ranking system?
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:13:09 Tier 1 (Suicidal anti-shredder): Be able to kill a shredder bug at the cost of your ship (severe damage)

Tier 2 (light anti-shredder): Be able to kill 1-2 shredder bugs while taking moderate to no damage

Tier 3 (heavy anti-shredder): Be able to kill 1 fast shredder bug /an entire shredder army while taking moderate to no damage

Tier 4 (dedicated anti-shredder): Be able to kill everything tier 2 can, explosive shredders, and a shredder ball while taking little to no damage

Tier 5 (Shredder obliterator): Be able to kill all forms of shredder bugs (including blacklisted) and everything that could stop your shredder killing operation while taking absolutely no damage (nearly impossible)

Tier 6 (Shredder's bane): Be able to stop the usage of shredder bugs for the entire duration of the server even after leaving the game (Impossible)
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:13:56 My Horizon is tier 3 in the list
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:14:03 My drone battleship is tier 1.5
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:14:17 A typical kamikaze plane is tier 1
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:14:33 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:15:22 A typical dedicated anti-shredder should be tier 4 on the list
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:19:26 Shredders have to touch their opponent so a tnt armored vehicle with lava spitter should be good
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:19:36 Since they have to get close
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:19:53 https://tenor.com/view/epic-embed-fail-gypsy-crusader-caption-joker-meme-gif-20224902
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:20:04 <@!744155395315990539>
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:20:31 Yep it's a cool creation
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:20:35 Anyways <@!717269153840496661>
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:21:13 Another thing is that you should have a build with gaps small enough to trap a shredder but big enough to let them in around your build
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:21:22 Like in the case of my Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:21:37 That's how my Horizon is so good at killing them
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:22:22 You scared of my anti-shredder mate?
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:22:38 And surface wiper
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:22:47 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:22:56 Wait you have a dedicated anti-shredder?
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:23:02 Mine is an accidental anti-shredder
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:23:20 I didn't intend my Horizon to do that job but still does it anyways
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:23:36 
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:23:54 There's like small gaps everywhere that can trap and kill a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:24:02 Thx
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:24:25 Oh boy that will make my ship very laggy
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:24:53 Yep even the people from starscape itself noticed
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:25:02 Idk where my weak spots are
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:25:33 Oh this uses no motor locks at all
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:25:50 Just uses a conveyor drive, some boost rockets, helium, and ballasts to float
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:26:05 14 days
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:26:09 Since alpha
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:26:33 I don't need to I just camp and watch the shredder get stuck and suffer
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:27:10 The shredder's weak spot*
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:27:16 There's a lot of gaps in there
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:27:23 for the shredders to get stuck and be immobilized
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:27:48 e
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:28:13 interesting
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:28:57 Oh no I die to that
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:29:06 My weakness is basically everything that if fast and agile and flies
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:29:31 Wot happened
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:30:09 **You pinged rickje, now get rick rolled**
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:30:35 <@!717269153840496661> If this was the starscape server you would've gotten in a worse situation
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:31:15 Says the very same person that pinged pickle rick
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:31:32 In starscape server you get 12 hour mute
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:32:15 hey <@!682147422218223616> wanna go play plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:32:23 I wanna see your anti-shredder capabilities
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:32:31 They want to rick roll you
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:33:32 **You pinged Rickje, now get ready to become pickle rick**
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:33:44 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:39:35 Guys who has a dedicated/accidental anti-shredder
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:39:38 Can I test it
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:39:51 I wanna explore how others made their anti-shredders
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:39:55 and how effective they are
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:40:16 Other than my anti-shredder method which is shredder "trapping"
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:40:24 What
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:41:27 Oh so nothing too special?
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:41:40 e
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:46:24 IN starscape you get muted for 12 hours for pinging mods for no reason
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:49:34 *[Writes 4000 word count article on why starscape is a good game and that how people who say starscape is bad should go ram their own creations into a shredder ball]*
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:50:58 *"SO basically starscape is good game because it's space. And the reason people who say starscape is bad should go ram their creations into a shredder ball is because their opinion is trash. Thank you for coming to my TED talk."*
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:54:58 Lmao no
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:55:19 Besides almost no shredders can beat up my Horizon in 1 respawn
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:55:53 Like they need to do it 3 times then that's the time I took too much damage that I need to respawn myself
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:56:11 if the shredder user is that trash they need to do it for liek 5-6 times
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:57:30 Wdym slow you're literally moving at 500sps
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 11:59:29 What if I remove the plot armor generator?
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 12:00:14 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 12:00:26 Anyways I have yet to kill a plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 12:00:39 You use fireworks :chet:
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 12:05:22 
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 12:13:26 Wanna brick it again?
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 12:14:14 Hehe
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 12:31:10 I want the old disconnect screen back
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 12:31:39 Like if roblox brought back the red disconnect bar thing in the top then I would've reconnected to the same server
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 12:31:53 I mean can it actually pvp doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 12:32:11 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 12:34:31 I'm gonna join your server now
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 12:34:48 e
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:06:36 My drone battleship got some downvotes doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:07:19 Also I have upgraded my blacklist breaker build
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:07:34 Now I can break those annoying blacklisters that blacklist for no reason
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:07:42 They're basically the shredder bugs of non-pvp
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:07:56 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:08:11 Want to copy my blacklist breaker?
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:08:15 Get out of here
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:08:29 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:09:32 I mean a good reason is because they're really annoying (they just ram their build to your plot while you're building, they spam parachute, etc.)
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:09:51 But like blacklist for no reason
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:09:59 That just triggers me
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:10:28 Just say that before you blacklist me and I'll leave you alone mate
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:10:43 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:11:01 #mod-logs
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:11:04 :))))
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:11:15 :trol:
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:11:26 Ah yes I don't have nitro
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:11:30 very epic
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:12:19 
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:20:28 No thx it's kinda sus
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:37:27 I diagnose my lag machine with possible tier 6 anti-shredder
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:37:38 tested it on private server
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:38:02 And will only be deployed if the shredder situation gets out of hand
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:38:53 I know but sometimes you gotta fight fire with fire
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:39:33 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:40:15 <@456226577798135808> But remember yesterday where-in the shredder didn't stop?
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:41:12 ye basically there's no need to use a lag machine until something like that occurs
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:42:38 Actually lag machines are tier 5
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:42:44 anti-shredder
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:43:13 FOr tier 6 you stop the usage of shredder bugs even after leaving the game
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:43:21 making it an impossible rank
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:44:06 :trol:
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:46:19 I just created one recently and I plan to use it if shredder situation gets out of hand
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:46:23 Like if the shredder won't stop
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:47:01 nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:48:16 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:49:34 I still can't join plane crazy bruv
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:49:39 lag machine testing gone wrong
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:50:00 1 more reason to only deploy it at the last minute instead of every shredder encounter
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:51:40 Actually nvm it was just that i was already in roblox
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:51:50 I didn't realize I was already in roblox
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:51:51 bruv
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:54:57 Does it look like it can totally stop all shredders from using a shredder bug?
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:55:25 Like they were very persistent in using it and not even killing them would work
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:56:50 In theory yes
The physics throttle would be too much and too long that it would either make whoever is using the shredder either leave the game or use a different creation
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:58:14 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:58:15 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:59:20 Welp it's gonna be sitting in the attic then beside my shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:59:50 There goes my tier 5 anti-shredder attempt and my finger
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 15:04:22 Wing
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 15:08:25 How do I beat up planes?
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 15:08:31 Like the fast ones
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 15:33:22 ez
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 15:33:33 ez suffering :spainwithoutthes:
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 15:39:45 Death
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:33:31 So lag machines are not allowed but shredders are? Bruvv
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:36:37 OR ACTUALLY
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:36:53 I'm calling backup
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:37:47 They're basically self explanatory
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:37:58 Thing is the shredder situation got out of control
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:38:04 Abominations
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:38:23 The shredders won't stop and a missile is making it difficult to kill shredders]
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:39:17 Wait I'll show you a pic of the advanced variant of the shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:39:25 I see nothing wrong here
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:40:56 Do you want to see my shredder?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:40:58 Jk
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:41:14 It's original and decent
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:41:18 I mean
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:41:20 actually
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:41:26 No shredder bugs are decent but ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:41:55 Except 1 can't fly
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:42:03 Which means you can't easily die
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:42:40 ah frick forgot to drink water before drinking chocolate
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:43:05 
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:43:11 I have 3 spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:43:22 fictional spaceships from starscape
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:43:36 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:43:44 Wanna see them?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:45:01 Starting off we have the Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:45:32 Fun fact: The reason why it's good at killing shredders is because of the multiple gaps everywhere
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:45:35 In the engines, near the turrets
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:45:53 Hey at least I suck at making planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:46:11 Second of all we have the drone battleship
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:46:31 Mine don't work properly
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:46:42 This is the only ship capable of entering warp in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:46:53 And now lemme find my radix I misplaced it e
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:47:12 ykw I'm just gonna steal the image from myself
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:48:16 Finally we have the radix
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:48:32 This was my first wingless ship too
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:48:44 Actually tbh all my ships have no wings
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 00:49:07 All my spaceships are wingless and use rockets/propellers to turn and move around
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 01:23:27 Oh it's an old creation so it won't be fixed anytime soon
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 01:24:07 Wingless flying object
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 01:24:34 So this is my first time making a plane that will actually look good, how do I make the cockpit thing now?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 01:33:31 It do be like that
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 01:34:14 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 02:33:04 Actually I gave up
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 03:39:37

plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:13:45 Roast my Horizon now
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:14:05 
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:14:59 How much faster btw
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:15:10 20% faster? 50% faster?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:15:36 **Apply water on burned area**
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:16:05 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:16:27 Also the citadel is getting revamped soon
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:16:33 Maybe after that the ships will be of high quality
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:16:38 Comparable to galaxy ships
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:16:41 Wot
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:17:03 Starscape citadel
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:17:18 It's gonan become fatter than the current citadel
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:17:30 My Horizon sucks at beating up planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:17:39 But if you go slow on my Horizon you basically die
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:17:49 Or if you touch it and get stuck
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:18:40 zeppelin yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 06:18:51 idk why people call my drone battleship a blimp
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 07:22:34 huh?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 07:22:48 If it can kill people effectively then it's good
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 07:23:24 then it's good
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 07:23:56 Bold of you to assume you can hit me while I'm in warp
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 07:24:37 Why do planes have weird names?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 07:24:54 I mean like some of then
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 07:24:59 Cool plane name
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 07:35:02 scape
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 07:43:44 Should I make my horizon have cat ears and have a pink skin?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 07:43:50 Wingless flying object
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 07:44:25 Then make tank
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 07:44:31 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 07:45:01 I guess you can try custom
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 07:45:07 If you usually do reference tanks
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 07:45:58 rip
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 07:46:14 I guess you can do reference then
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 08:40:03 Use helium
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 08:40:20 Or try putting ballast at the bottom
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 08:41:29 Eww wings
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 08:41:49 ~~*Says me who uses shreddesr up to now*~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 08:42:11 Well at least i have a shredder obliterator so I'm fine
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 08:58:33 Guys who wanna 1v1
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 08:58:45 Am bored
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 09:51:12 Aight lez 1v1
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 09:57:58 pvp server ofc
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 09:58:05 Tell me when you're ready
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:17:22 Also I had an idea for a new block: shield generator

It will be a rather big block, it's as big as a 4x4x4 block cube. You can only have 3 shield generators.
It will also be rather heavy, weighing as much as a ballast block with density set to 80.

So basically how it works is that it will absorb all the damage dealt to the ship. Basically all blocks are immune to damage until the shields reach 0. Shields regain 5 points every 2 seconds and if the shields are destroyed it takes 1 minute for them to reactivate again but only at 50% of their original value

The max amount of shield you get is the number of blocks attaches to the build the shield generator is mounted x 0.25
So if you have like 1500 blocks attached to your build you will only have 375 shields. if you place 2 shield generators in the same build, the max shields will be doubled and regen rate is increased to 7.5 shield points per second (10 shield points per second if 3 shield generators)

Each pvp weapon deals a certain amount of shield damage. Guns deal 1 damage, cutters deal (sps)÷10 damage, fireworks deal 5 damage, rockets deal 10 damage, and lava spitters deal 20 damage/s
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:18:03 Another broken idea I have
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:20:38 Why not?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:20:58 How is it bad idea?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:21:19 It isn't a bad idea until you give some valid arguments
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:23:50 They called me a hacker for using a glitched car
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:23:54 You know the one that flings
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:24:19 Bruv
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:24:24 Probably salty
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:24:39 Anyways what do you think about my shield generator idea?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:24:46 this one
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:28:27 Short version: 
It's a big and heavy block. Size is 3x3x3 blocks and weight is as much as 2 ballast beams with 40 density.
Only 3 of them can be used. Absorbs damage until shield down. 
Shield regen rate = 5 points per second and increases by 2.5 for every shield regen added to the build. 
Shield value = (blocks connected to build) x 0.25. 
Pvp weapons deal different amounts of damage. With gun dealing the weakest amount to lava spitter being an absolute shield destroyer.
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:32:32 Why nobody reply to my idea
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:33:32 Super rocket engine with conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:34:01 Conveyor drive is the least laggiest warp drive out of all the warp drives
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:34:48 Now reply to my idea or I beat up your plane with ~~shredder ball~~ a  highly classified method
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:35:47 I wanna know people's opinion in my idea
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:35:54 With valid arguments
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:36:14 Not just "bad idea" or "good idea" like what <@!389017069540081664> said
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:36:46 This is what he just said, no explanation to his opinion
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:37:34 
general 2021-04-21 10:38:16 Cool
general 2021-04-21 10:38:30 ~~Ah yes jojo is dating game~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:42:15 ***Why you using bold text***
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:42:23 ***WHY***
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:42:26 ***W H Y***
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 10:43:11 ***W  H  A  Y  I  E  ?***
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 11:07:44 set it to 1.25
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 11:08:09 A piston can push a block by 1 block if you set the distance to 2.5
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 11:16:43 Why not?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 11:16:53 How is it garbage?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 11:17:24 Bruh I'm trying to find that 1 trollface emoji brb

plane-crazy 2021-04-21 11:17:40 Ok there we go
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 11:18:12 I mean we got hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 11:18:32 We also got magnets that even attracts non-metal objects
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 11:19:32 Boi you haven't seen how useless air blocks are
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 11:20:12 Anyways how does it sound dumb?
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 11:22:20 They're used for blasting off random explosive balls and for docking
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 13:38:32 I had an idea for a new block: shield generator

It will be a rather big block, it's as big as a 4x4x4 block cube. You can only have 3 shield generators.

Another broken idea I have

plane-crazy 2021-04-21 13:42:04 I don't wanna just straight-up post a suggestion and then suddenly get downvoted to hell
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 13:42:26 My spaceship would benefit from it
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 13:43:07 I mean we have hover thrusters doe

plane-crazy 2021-04-22 05:35:33 Hey wanna hear another broken idea of mine?
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 05:35:46 Hold on lemme copy paste
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 05:36:06 I had an idea for a new block: shield generator

plane-crazy 2021-04-22 05:37:34 So uhh
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 05:37:38 What do you think?
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 05:38:36 <@!368581738496131072>
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 05:40:05 Train
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 05:40:58 Ye like if max shield is 100 points once it gets reactivated it only get 50 shield points back
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 05:54:09 Ok that's now the best train to ever exist
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 10:23:12 Anyone online?
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 10:23:30 Who wanna go play *plant crazy*

plane-crazy 2021-04-22 14:00:10 That moment when your radix at 600 sps travels faster than your Horizon at 2k sps
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 14:21:08 Me building stuff: 68421 upvotes
Some dude just s###posting: 69420 upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 14:51:05 Overengineered text
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 14:57:53 Aight I am back to asking who here has an anti-shredder and what method/s does it use to kill shredders?
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 14:58:59 I just anchor and watch them miserably fail trying to attack my Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 14:59:19 They only deal a scratch to my Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 14:59:31 Different story when you fight me with a plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 14:59:36 I become campfire
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 15:00:55 So if you wanna shred people and don't wanna die 
get a person with a plane and you'll be fine
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 15:02:38 ik
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 15:02:49 But my Horizon is big and so it lags
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 15:02:59 Which makes it slower than it's supposed to
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 15:03:07 Like 1k speed travels like 500-600 sps
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 15:03:36 I mean planes are basically the meta of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 15:04:05 Like nothing can beat a thing moving at 108 km/h (600 sps)
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 15:04:36 sure
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 15:04:48 Will a spaceship do?
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 15:05:03 It's as big as a destroyer
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 15:05:19 in plane crazy not irl destroyer
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 15:10:45 Like it''s probaby the sieze of a corvette irl
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 15:10:55 Wait no
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 15:10:57 speed boat
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 15:36:15 They're not really insults for me they're failed attempts anyways
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 16:02:04 Because plane crazy hivemind decided your fate
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 16:02:27 Anyone here I can join
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 16:02:30 am pretty bored
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 16:02:46 Also how do people even aim with a plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 16:03:16 I literally use a stable and fast wasd plane and still can't hit anything
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 16:03:34 Turning is also good
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 16:04:07 :))))
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 16:04:18 Don't worry you'll get on my level
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 16:04:21 even higher than mine
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 16:04:48 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 16:04:57 Wait that's a gun?
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 16:05:10 Looks like an engine
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 16:05:36 How can something be a gun and an engine at the same time

Cuz what I did to get 0.18 was 1/20/1000x60x60
sps to m/s to km/s to km/m to km/h
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 18:55:36 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 18:55:43 I mean I did but
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 18:56:29 ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 18:56:41 Wait hold on
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 18:56:46 How did you get 2.23693629
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 18:56:50 and 100
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 18:56:55 and 5
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 18:57:02 <@!811482241238302720>
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 18:58:42 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 18:59:26 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 18:59:40 ye ik
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:02:50 interesting
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:03:20 Too bad my boat floats and is extremely fast
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:03:54 Btw also another question: why is 0.111846815 more accurate than 0.18?
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:04:03 If you don't mind doing the explaining for that
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:04:10 Also I'm about to sleep anyways sooo
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:04:56 Average robloxian height
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:05:26 But then we have the height slider doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:05:40 That can change your height from being small to big
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:06:09 Ye I was doing km/h
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:06:22 Ye I'm A s i a n
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:07:53 Because why not
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:08:06 superposition moment
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:09:08 Also according to that to convert sps to km/h you do (sps) x 1.008
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:09:24 Making sps a bigger unit
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:09:30 for measuring speed
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:09:43 Unless I screwed up my math
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:09:45 I suck at it
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:09:54 1 x 0.28 / 1000 x 60 x 60
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:10:21 just replace /20 with x 0.28
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:10:41 Ye good way to simplify the formula
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:10:53 you get meters per second then
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:11:02 I want kilometers per hour
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:11:40 Anyways according to some funky math 600 sps is 604.8 km/h
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:11:53 Boi roblox planes are really fast
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:12:16 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:12:32 0.18 seems more realistic
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:13:12 1000 sps is roblox mach 1
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:13:37 My drone battleship can do better than this
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:13:46 1234.8 km/h is mach 1
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:14:58 Plot twist: White name dude was actually an expert rank
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:18:01 Ye I was
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:18:09 roblox's mach 1
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:18:21 Actually
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 19:18:33 Sound in roblox trave,s instantly
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:04:16 keybinds with logic gates I guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:05:14 I think there should be keybind delay too and maybe sensor activated actions?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:05:36 Like when a block gets too close to another player's block something occurs like missiles launch or smth
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:06:28 Ye I've had them in my mind for a while now
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:07:22 Hey wanna hear a broken idea of mine?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:08:08 I've heard of a suggestion where-in you can make your own block and wedge pieces
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:08:30 Like You can make a 2x2 block, a 1x10 wedge, etc.
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:08:54 Motor 2 needs to be bug fixed it keeps glitching me out during 1v1
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:09:04 had an idea for a new block: shield generator

It will be a rather big block, it's as big as a 4x4x4 block cube. You can only have 3 shield generators.
It will also be rather heavy, weighing as much as a ballast block with density set to 80.

So basically how it works is that it will absorb all the damage dealt to the ship. Basically all blocks are immune to damage until the shields reach 0. Shields regain 5 points every 2 seconds and if the shields are destroyed it takes 1 minute for them to reactivate again but only at 50% of their original value

The max amount of shield you get is the number of blocks attaches to the build the shield generator is mounted x 0.25
So if you have like 1500 blocks attached to your build you will only have 375 shields. if you place 2 shield generators in the same build, the max shields will be doubled and regen rate is increased to 7.5 shield points per second (10 shield points per second if 3 shield generators)

Each pvp weapon deals a certain amount of shield damage. Guns deal 1 damage, cutters deal (sps)÷10 damage, fireworks deal 5 damage, rockets deal 10 damage, and lava spitters deal 20 damage per second
So uhh
What do you think?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:09:16 Not the best time to copy and paste but ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:09:51 When you go at a very fast speed and suddenly anchor motor 2's become annoying flies
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:09:53 Why not
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:10:27 Boi it would be useless if your opponent is extremely fast and skilled
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:11:23 Ok I haven't thought of that
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:12:31 WHy not add both and become OP
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:12:43 This is something everyone can agree on
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:12:57 Whether you're a plane builder, spaceship builder, shredder bug builder
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:13:12 Solution to all block type suggestions: add block creator
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:13:36 Like you can make your own wedges
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:13:53 1x7, 1x15 wedges,
3x3x3 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:14:19 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:15:18 Just lure the shredder towards me and I'll beat them up
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:15:32 Someone made one before
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:15:44 Nope not in creations
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:15:50 Like in a server I joined before
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:16:32 Just use gap trapping and brute force method and you'll become an OP shredder obliterator
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:16:51 Most of them are kids and you can't stop it
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:17:36 But why remove it it's an essential part for my ship
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:17:40 So I can obliterate shredders
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:17:51 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:17:58 Effective against shredders
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:18:38 Eh at least shredders can't touch you without becoming a campfire
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:18:59 e
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:20:14 Am I a spammer? I used all pvp weapons other than tnt and cutters
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:20:18 In my horizon
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:20:23 and my drone battleship
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:20:33 
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:21:20 oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:21:54 
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:22:41 Anyways I need all the pvp weapons since my ship thrives on warp speed and high DPS
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:22:59 Cya
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:23:03 Wot
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:23:50 We need a longer ship immunity timer because I hate getting spawnkilled
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:23:56 And your immunity timer will break
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:24:00 when you shoot someone
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:24:03 or fire a weapon
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:24:19 I suppose a 20 second timer will be good
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:24:39 Random spawnpoints?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:24:42 Maybe that's better
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:25:13 We need the whole map
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:25:27 At least battleships can float on it
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:25:38 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:25:42 We need bigger map overall
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:25:48 But it would probably make the lag worse
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:26:06 Probably making the lag too bad I can't get out of spawn without getting obliterated by some random tank
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:28:44 I think we should have seperate maps for pvp and non-pvp
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:28:53 And I am back from going in the restroom
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:29:56 Like non-pvp has like a small village and more player bases
pvp mode has npc builds across the entire map, a small base with working turrets you need to destroy and less player bases
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:30:22 Guys are npc builds good?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:30:24 ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:30:38 Like npc planes, boats, etc.
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:31:00 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:31:15 MAybe a seperate gamemode where-in you need to fight npcs
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:31:18 oh
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:31:26 But how is it garbage
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:31:49 Then what exactly is plane crazy style?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:32:20 Not a storyline, just npcs to fill the void when player count drops too low
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:33:34 Was the AI too garbage or were they too pro?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:34:31 Why not I wanna go dynamite fishing
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:36:04 Wait lemme list accepted/rejected/neutral suggestions in here:

Accepted:
Multiple keybinds, sensors, bigger map

Neutral:
Corals

Rejected:
Shield generators, lasers, npc builds
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:36:44 They literally kill my Horizon sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:36:56 Like it makes me get flung out of the world
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:37:08 try shaking your mouse to reduce the time
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:37:26 No need to fight it just eject it
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:37:28 It's already sus
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:38:31 tiny mod
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:38:49 Huge modding when
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:39:06 **~~Actually bans everyone from using discord~~**
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:39:41 game is hardcoded bruv
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:39:59 motor 2 locking when
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:40:20 Btw guys what does the reset button mean in motors?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:40:30 It's lock button
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:41:59 :))))
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:42:07 Wait until I spawn my Horizoom
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:42:13 Oh wait it's just 1k blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:42:16 no big deal
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:43:13 Brain damage more relevant
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:43:33 Comedy 100
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:43:44 Or maybe motor 2's have a smooth brain
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:44:22 Why not stay in the thermosphere and melt to death because it's too hot?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:44:44 It's joke btw you don't melt in thermosphere
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:47:21 Wait so uhh why aren't npc builds getting added again? Other than because it doesn't fit plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:49:17 six nine
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:49:53 Why u scared of losing designer III
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:50:33 True other servers get too active
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:51:10 ~~Yes I am admin now I shall mute you because I can~~
(Hopefully claiming to be an admin even if you're not is not against the rules)
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:51:45 Who needs pp when you have brain
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:52:27 A word
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:55:14 What
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:55:45 Here borrow my horizon
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:55:48 Now go raid it
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:55:56 And hopefully you don't encounter a plane
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:56:12 Actually
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:56:38 raid the school with shredder bugs the only legal use of shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:56:44 Send it in dms
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 03:07:40 Did you show him a flashing video?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 03:07:55 or her
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 03:07:56 or it
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 03:08:16 Anyways why did the troll face get revived just now
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 03:26:22 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/529858892075761694/834934907187888188 What are rope storms?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 03:39:35 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:38:08 Cool plane crazy map
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:38:38 YEs and now I have to waste another 6 hours making my Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:38:42 **Very epic**
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:39:42 And it's gonna be more pain for people who made folded creations
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:47:58 Oh cool
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:49:34 OH GOLLY
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:49:38 1k speed is now actually fast
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:49:39 pog
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:56:59 rps?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:57:43 anyways some random dude kept spawnkilling everyone
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:57:52 So I spawnkilled him until he left
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 05:58:36 That feeling of power when you're the only big build in the server and there's no planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 06:52:21 Woah the performance rn is very great
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 06:52:37 My warp drive acceleration is actually fast now
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 06:53:13 I still can't beat up planes doe
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 06:58:12 Anything wrong with that?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 06:58:23 The faster you fold, the more chances you can escape and not get spawnkilled
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 06:58:35 
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 06:59:24 If starscape adds a carrier I'm gonna make a folded build
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 06:59:39 And some shredders to assist it
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 06:59:42 It's a carrier anyways
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:00:53 Then pog
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:01:03 Like carriers with docking bays?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:01:14 Or basically just a glorified aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:01:21 Oh wait
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:01:27 Nvm
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:01:41 Ye true
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:02:14 I mean that;s normal
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:02:22 All 3 of my spaceships fly in 0 gravity
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:02:24 No hiccups
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:03:31 Anchor blocks :troll:
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:03:54 No like you fold then you fly somewhere high up
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:03:57 Then you anchor
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:06:02 Anyways do you guys have dedicated anti-shredders?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:06:09 Or accidental ones?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:06:34 Basically a build that wasn't intended to kill shredders but still does it anyways
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:08:49 OH GOLLY THE LAG
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:08:58 Seems like the ultimate anti-shredder
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:45:30 Interesting
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:47:59 OH GOLLY
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:48:09 My drone battleship has never been this fast
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:55:48 Roblox performance improvements do be great
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:55:53 Why not
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:56:11 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:56:23 also I can actually beat up planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:56:29 If the pilot is bad enough
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:56:40 
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:56:55 Wait is this your first time building wingless creations?
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:57:08 Practice on a small one first
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:57:12 Don't do big stuff yet
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:57:35 Oh nvm
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 07:57:44 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:20:45 I think I'll pass the opportunity to make a spaceship carrier
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:27:45 Boi I can beat up planes now
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:28:22 Or maybe the pilots are just trash
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:30:58 Actually nvm planes can still beat me up
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:31:06 But they aren't that much of a problem now
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:33:43 Guys who wanna do spaceship vs plane combat
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:34:46 tnt blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:34:49 They are unbreakable
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:34:53 Until you blow them up
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:34:59 Next on the list is diamond plate
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:35:18 Despite being lighter than normal blocks, they are the tankiest material in the gam,e
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:35:25 Making them a good material choice
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:35:31 In theory that would work
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:35:49 But it wouldn't
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:35:50 Because
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:35:51 blacklist
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:36:11 Also use diamond plate in every build please
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:36:35 In the colors panel
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:36:39 Then click on materials
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:37:33 pls
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:37:33 Guys who wanna plane vs spaceship combat
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:37:43 I wanna test out the limits on how good my Horizon is
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 08:40:33 with no boost: 270
with boost: 670

plane-crazy 2021-04-24 07:42:32 lølîpøp
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 07:43:10 Maybe cuz of the word "łołî"
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 07:59:00 Had a similar situation a while ago
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 07:59:19 Except dude told me to die in hell cuz I killed his box car

plane-crazy 2021-04-24 08:44:28 Idk but at least they're less effective now
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 08:44:34 They can't lag everyone now
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 08:46:07 I mean some laptops are powerful enough to handle lag
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 08:46:21 Your laptop has skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 08:47:03 problem? <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 08:48:20 Oh I replied to the wrong person
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 08:48:30 I hate it when chat gets too active I reply to the wrong person
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:37:40 Bro I forgot how 60 fps feels like
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:37:47 I can feel the motion blur
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:38:17 That's because you didn't upgrade it to have flight capabilities like mine
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:38:28 w h a t
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:38:35 Btw may I join you
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:39:23 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:39:32 Oh nvm e
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:39:57 Back then motor locking and shredder bugs weren't a thing
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:40:35 And most planes I've seen were using mouse control
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:40:54 Nah they ain't that big of a problem for me
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:41:22 They're so much not of a problem I just anchor and watch them miserably fail to kill my Horizoom
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:41:36 Ok you have a point
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:41:48 Still a problem then
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:41:53 
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:42:15 Also sometimes the shredder situation gets soo bad I just wanna use a lag machine to disable the shredders
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:42:27 Like when a shredder won't stop killing everyone
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:42:56 Or when there are too much shredder supporters (people who aren't shredders but still kill non-shredders even though there is one in the server)
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:43:12 Ultra high resolution
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:43:44 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 18:46:20 Epic embed fail

plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:01:55 Dude how do I kill planes without using planes
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:02:26 Bomb would miss anyways but ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:03:46 Ye I think anything on land that has concentrated gunfire like a tank would be good AA weapons
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:04:02 The planes can't go under you anyways
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:04:12 You haven't seen my creations mate
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:04:21 Mine is even messier
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:05:09 Nice

plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:06:55 "Some shitty island I made"
Hmm yes
"shitty"
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:08:09 Rule 1 of being a creative: Always assume your creations are bad until people say they are good
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:08:49 Good way to expect for the worst outcome which is everybody hates your creation
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:11:00 Designer V posts starter plane: 69420 upvotes
no rank dude posts gigantic and very detailed flying space carrier that flys well and is extremely good at pvp: 68419 upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:11:43 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:12:26 Well the price you have to pay when you want detailed stuff is lag sooo
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:13:30 I think there should be a role you need to get before you can access creations channel
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:13:44 Like you need to chat just enough to get the role
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:14:22 No like
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:14:30 To even view the channel
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:16:35 I think the role should come alongside image perms
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:16:39 YE
plane-crazy 2021-04-24 19:16:42 Oops caps

plane-crazy 2021-04-30 07:19:25 Bruv
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 07:21:48 Wait shall we put the people who called him gay on KoS list
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 07:22:06 Several people did
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 07:22:11 Kill on Sight
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 07:22:20 That means whenever you see them in pvp you kill them
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 09:10:33 A miniscule amount of course
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 09:43:37 We need a wedge maker
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 09:43:44 And a block maker
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 09:43:57 So we can make like 2x2x2 blocks or 1x10 wedge
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 09:44:03 depending on what the situation requires
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 11:29:39 How do I build upside down now that I am making the first folded creation?
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 11:30:14 Hmm yes bismarck
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 13:36:43 Because why not
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 13:39:09 ~~Imagine using motor lock~~
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 13:41:14 Well tbh I still don’t use motor locks (also I just learned how to fold just now because my creation required it
plane-crazy 2021-04-30 13:41:38 Tomas
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 12:40:53 I'm almost done with the hull of the Lycentian Federal Battleship, will color later
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 12:41:06 Thx
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 12:41:21 I have 4 starscape ships now :)
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 12:43:16 Who said it was too big?
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 12:43:40 Nothing is ever too big
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 12:47:25 Everytime you find someone who lags a server (especially one that doesn't talk) put them in a list
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 12:49:49 oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 12:50:23 (Kinda thought I got a ping complementing/critiquing my WIP build)
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 12:53:02 Step 1: you can't
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:26:58 Bro the Lycentian Federal Battleship is still in WIP and it can still 1v1 shredder bugs easily
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:27:02 Without even resetting
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:30:44 Step 1: Get a big creation
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:31:01 Step 2: use a ton of pvp weapons
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:31:05 Placed in turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:31:14 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:31:26 Exactly
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:31:29 Use a ton of pvp weapons
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:31:42 Also the bigger your creation is the better it is in shredder 1v1
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:31:56 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:31:59 I have 3 big creations
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:32:08 You may also need to place turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:32:23 You may also need to work in your aim
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:32:31 What tier level
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:33:02 Oh nvm I forgot it's just my own anti-shredder rating that nobody else knows about
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:33:12 ANyways moving on
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:34:04 1.5k vehicles will do
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:34:30 1k vehicles also work but they're also kinda weaker in shredder 1v1s
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:34:50 SOmething as big as this would work
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:35:24 Yes good
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:35:36 Oh mine is actually a battleship too
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:35:39 It's still WIP doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 13:39:52 Sup
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 18:19:12 End result of the Lycentian Federal Battleship was very trash
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 18:19:19 Should I still post a pic of it doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 19:20:17 The Lycentian Federal Battleship from starscape
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 19:20:23 At night
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 19:20:30 Guys whaat do you think lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 19:29:12 Bruh I disconnected before I could make a shredder ball rage quit
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 19:29:32 Yes my new ship is now capable of destroying shredder balls
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 19:29:44 At the cost of my ship
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 19:32:01 Nice
creations-chat 2021-05-01 19:34:22 Lycentian Battleship from starscape. What do you think?
creations-chat 2021-05-01 19:37:28 That’s as much guns as the actual one in starscape. It’s a battleship anyways. Any suggestion other than that?
creations-chat 2021-05-01 19:41:15 Welp gonna post the big creation I have
creations-chat 2021-05-01 19:48:29 Thx
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 05:25:59 Good afternoon fellow asian gays and lesbians
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 05:26:21 Cuz the straight boys are lesbians and the straight girls are gay
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 05:27:27 <@!368581738496131072> Wanna see my new battleship from starscape?
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 05:27:34 Haha p i n g
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 05:28:05 Car
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 05:28:20 
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 05:28:50 Iz gud?
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 05:29:32 It’s also my first folded creation
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 05:57:33 I wish there was a “rejoin last server” option in roblox
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 05:58:13 I hate it when I disconnect and I was having a good time with people I haven’t friended yet
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 06:06:07 Use ice blocks and place helium on both ends of the zeppelin
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 06:06:08 Also mind making me a katana
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 07:02:41 <@!671207394436448296> What’s wrong with my battleship? And how can I improve it?
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 07:02:47 Since you downvoted it
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 07:41:27 Bro it’s a battleship
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 07:41:41 How can I fight without turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 07:44:12 Corporate tower
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 07:45:54 Like a bunch of small vehicles or even big spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 07:46:38 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 07:49:25 Realism? What’s that? I just use spam cars
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 07:51:55 That makes the shredder bug a decent build. It’s capable of destroying stuff with and is still easy to use. It’s just that they’re really annoying creatures that can’t even 10v1 my spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 07:52:17 Good luck with l a g
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 07:55:49 Check ballasts
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 13:43:30 Bruh how did my creation that took 2 days of making get less upvotes than a creation that took 6 hours of making
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 13:44:10 If it’s gonna be trash at pvp then I have wasted 2 days making a battleship
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 13:45:32 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 13:47:50 Ik but like I’m hoping that at least it should be good at pvp if it won’t give me designer V
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 13:48:03 Gonna log on in a bit
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 13:50:18 Like even a spaceship one?
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 13:50:22 Mine’s a spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 13:50:45 I guess mine is mostly composed of beam 1x7
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 13:50:55 Wait lemme do the math later
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 13:51:28 I used to believe that blocks are better than beams
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 13:51:48 For durability not lag performance
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 13:52:16 Cuz like even if you destroy 1 block you still have a ton of blocks to destroy
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 13:52:53 Tnt beam when
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 13:53:53 Cuz I seriously need to reinforce the middle part of my battleship cuz fold
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 13:57:05 Or use 2 motors in a fold so that if 1 dies you still have 1 extra motor keeping the ship intact
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 13:57:53 And maybe add a folding lock so that your spaceship wouldn’t split when you anchor while travelling very quickly
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 13:58:29 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 14:16:46 She uses gun/firework combo to make it work
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 14:17:34 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 16:10:28 What does it say then
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 16:10:54 <@!489806344388345857>
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 16:11:17 sussy
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 16:12:18 Welp that's 1 way to inrease server activity
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 16:12:20 for a short time
plane-crazy 2021-05-02 16:12:52 j
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 03:46:40 Guys is it legal to break blacklist barrier?
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 03:47:01 oh alright
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 03:47:16 Cuz I usually do it when someome blacklists for no reason
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 03:47:29 pls lemme pass
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 04:12:19 Kinda has the color scheme of a typical shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 04:12:29 p
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 04:17:27 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 04:26:00 The most logical comment about logic in the world
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 04:26:27 What does it mean doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 04:26:41 Like just use google translate for this thing
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:16:41 Want me to annoy him until he leaves?
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:16:52 Or did he left already?
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:17:01 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:18:13 Some people just blacklist for no reason and it gets annoying too
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:20:28 karan

plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:35:00 sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:35:07 My "boat" travels at that speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:39:36 Ima go join a random person in here
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:39:39 I'm lonely
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:40:06 
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:42:14 Bro some boats even travel at 1k sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:42:30 Conveyor drive + super rockets
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:43:10 
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:43:18 It's also not exactly a boat
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:43:23 But rather a gun platform
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:43:45 That's why I put "boat" instead of boat
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:45:22 Also another thing: May I join you
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:45:25 Cuz I'm pretty lonely
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:45:50 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:46:56 I used to have 1 waifu named speedwagon
Too bad he died from heart attack
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:47:57 Why not jojo is pog anime
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:48:39 Weeb is life
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:49:24 I mean without emotions you don't experience too much suffering now
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 05:50:50 So that you can outpizza the hut
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 08:25:27 Ah yes the OG tnt launcher
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 08:25:53 minceraft
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 09:07:24 Abogug
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 09:27:07 plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 09:29:53 Bruv why is my Horizon still better than my Lycentian Battleship
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 09:32:08 I mean in paper it should be better. It can travel extremely quickly, turn quickly, is big and tanky, fine turret placement, etc.

but because of lag, the game freezes when I get shot, it travels extremely slowly, and I need to stay still in order to aim properly
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 09:53:38 Sussy sussus
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 10:53:54 hmmmm
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 10:54:01 sussy
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 15:43:39 Where did you learn this stuff
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 15:44:16 Also what did you use to simulate the aerodynamics and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 15:44:45 o h
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 16:13:04 How is air seperating ungood though (if you don't mind doing the explaining)
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 16:26:46 Oh alright
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 17:09:39 Just use the 5x5 cylinder ez
plane-crazy 2021-05-03 17:10:46 That's basically a 5x5 wheel doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 03:40:02 cool
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 03:40:02 Basically <#384021699466756107> became a place to mock the group wall of the plane crazy group
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 03:40:44 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 03:41:08 Also may I join you?
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 03:41:14 Thanks
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 03:42:31 How many alts do you even have
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 03:42:48 W h a t
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 03:42:55 Seems very sus
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 03:43:01 oof
the-dump 2021-05-04 04:22:10 huh
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 05:55:36 What timezone?
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:44:58 Never needed such a complicated system
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:45:34 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:47:01 The best thing I got is a gray and white spaceship capable of destroying everything that can't fly/stuff that fly but aren't very agile
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:47:27 o h n o
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:47:35 Hey anyone here I can join?
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:47:53 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:48:23 My weakness are planes
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:48:29 Motor towers are ez
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:49:41 gyro
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:50:06 Or a flying spaceship with 8 turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:50:17 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:50:27 Normal is 290 sps boost is 690
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:50:34 But it's acceleration is high enough
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:50:46 Very high actually
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:51:01 Requires anchor block to turn but it's also very high
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:51:17 Since it's wingless and uses helium
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:52:00 Actually I can turn without anchor blocks but I will just go sliding in the atmosphere with little control
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:52:39 I just anchor near them, shoot a rocket, and go get out of there quickly
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:53:19 rip
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:53:54 Turn up graphics to level 8
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:54:07 rip
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:55:09 Same here
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 06:55:11 I'm in the middle
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 07:03:34 Whatevery you think fits better
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 08:05:37 Eternity
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 08:06:00 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 08:06:36 I got designer 3 role within 5 minutes
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 08:06:48 Back then when you only needed 30 upvotes to get designer 3
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 08:07:06 Wait when were the requirements raised again?
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 08:08:51 I kinda wish there was a spaceship engineer role (like the futuristic strange abominations that can travel at the speed of light)
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 08:09:29 :)))

plane-crazy 2021-05-04 08:22:24 true
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 08:22:46 All shredder bug users would have downvote designer V
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 08:23:10 Also I use the message search thing at the top right corner in discord
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 08:24:29 Anyways who wanna 1v1 am bored
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 08:27:11 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 08:27:56 Or literally anything that isn't a plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 08:30:05 Aight thanks

plane-crazy 2021-05-04 09:07:09 I still suck btw
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:04:19 So yes I still get demolished even with the acceleration and turning speed upgrade of the Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:04:40 I probably need to add wings now like what you said but idk where
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:05:51 ~~Motor locks are for tryhards~~
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:08:37 Bro I was joking if I wasn't I wouldn't have placed the strikethrough effect
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:08:50 ..
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:22:06 This is goldensword301, I'm asking for backup
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:22:15 1 shredder user and 1 shredder supporter
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:25:11 Even so there's a shredder supporting plane in the server ruining my shredder destroying operation
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:25:46 I remember an image of someone spamming "hmm" after losing an argument
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:31:39 Convinced the shredder supporter to stop attacking me and shredder user stopped shredding
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:37:08 ello
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:40:25 decor
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:41:29 It's because of our collective effort
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:41:39 At making stuff that can kill shredders
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:42:13 Join a random pvp server keep hoping from pvp server to another pvp server
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:42:36 then if you find shredder tell us
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:43:06 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:43:34 They have rabies that's why
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:44:47 they don't explode but their systems malfunction cuz
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:44:50 water damage
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:45:11 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:45:49 My shredder bug is probably waterproof model (yes I used to be a shredder user don't explode me pls)
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:47:02 how do you have the skill to not touch the void
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:47:33 void trapping might be a rather OP trap
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:50:00 Imagine not using 2 motors in 1 fold
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:50:21 for durability purposes
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:50:32 and for balance
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:51:04 yes but like even if 1 motor dies, there is another
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:51:53 Magnet welding I suppose
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 10:51:58 But magnets are too laggy
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 05:41:03 Guys should I make a space station?
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 05:41:10 Not an irl one but like a futuristic one
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 05:41:19 Ones with docking bays, guarded with turrets, etc.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 05:41:37 and escape pods
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 05:44:27 It wouldn't move though
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:11:51 ~~Now call her step brother to come over~~
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:11:59 Dead meme but who cares
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:13:17 Hey at least you got expert rank before you got creations blacklist
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:13:50 Ah yes alpha plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:14:31 Back when the ocean part of the map was just a bunch of lakes close to each other
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:15:33 make it fly
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:16:11 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:23:51 me making a spaceship that took 2 days: 24 upvotes
Me making another spaceship that took just 6 hours: 44 upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:24:02 Smaller = better
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:31:40 Seems like more and more people are starting to build spaceships in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:31:41 cool
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:32:11 Like futuristic box abominations that shoot lasers and travel at the speed of light
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:46:05 aogus
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:50:47 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:51:58 true
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:52:00 Maybe when a large number of people in the plane crazy community creates enough spaceships maybe a spaceship engineer rank might be nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:52:48 Cuz I'm just sitting here with my Lycentian battleship suffering because there's no rank I can get with it cuz
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:52:50 helium
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:53:49 Wait people actually waste 10 robux just to roleplay in get shredder bug'd simulator?
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:54:18 Nope lemme search that dude
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:56:13 Well the only paid thing you get in VIP servers are gravity sliders and the ability to shoot even when pvp is off
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:57:11 I mean it's only good when you need to test something with the least amount of lag as possible
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:57:16 true
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:57:36 Since other people's builds can lag
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:59:15 oofers
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:02:41 I guess lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:03:00 Since most of the stuff I see are WW2 german planes thingy
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:04:20 I know about Borschuna (cuz trailer which got 100k views)
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:05:02 Also I belong to a spaceship building group which fights other spaceship building groups
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:05:23 ye
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:07:09 same here
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:07:39 I only built the docking bay which isn't even finished or detailed yet
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:07:55 
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:08:01 When no nitro
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:08:07 Oh nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:08:11 Same here too
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:08:29 Like when spaceships are too big to fit in the internal docking bay they can dock outside
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:08:37 (Took that idea from starscape hehe)
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:10:51 pog
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:11:51 Mine is gonna be rather starscape-ish
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:12:01 But hopefully I can get it to be detailed enough
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:13:22 nothing, I'm just flying my Lycentian Federal Battleship across the sky
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:13:29 It's a rather recent build anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:13:59 
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:14:02 ye
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:14:15 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:23:59 I mean if it can fly and kill stuff easily then it;s good
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 04:08:45 a
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 04:16:18 Definitely just kidding
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 06:51:19 Guys who wanna participate in a little trolling
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 06:51:42 So this dude called izulqayyim123 thinks my Horizon is causing the lag even though it's not
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 06:52:03 (Plus it can even fly on an empty server in 60 fps)
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 06:52:06 So uhh
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 06:52:36 haha spaceship go f l y
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 06:52:48 All we need to do is just get our biggest creations and keep joining him with out biggest creations
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 06:53:41 Supposedly 3k+ blocks will do
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 07:04:54 Nvm I got him out
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 07:09:09 he's still playing plane crazy <@!651361636657135617> if you still wanna do a little trolling
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 07:09:44 rip
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 08:48:39 Guys I need help
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 08:48:53 Cuz like everyone is targetting my Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 08:49:01 I mean yes I did say I can deal with spawnkillers but
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 08:49:10 Basically the whole server is targetting me
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 08:53:53 Cuz it's rather big
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 08:54:02 You know the gray spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 08:54:41 Actually nvm I left server
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:43:10 Is it just me or is plane crazy laggy again?
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:43:21 aight
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:43:40 Cuz I can't fly my Horizon at 60 fps anymore
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:46:58 Hold on lemme try removing the hover thrusters in my spaceship and see if the lag is gone
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:12:06 Anyone noticing the decline of new submarines being built?
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:12:22 Like I haven't seen any submarines in plane crazy recently
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:17:12 I do like spaceships more but I agree we need better water physics
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:18:55 maybe there should be an option for rockets to have a "torpedo" check box
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:19:09 That allows them to be fired underwater but can't go on land
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:19:43 rip
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:20:12 People hate explosive water rockets
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:23:28 I kinda have an expalnation on how conveyors work but idk how to explain
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:23:32 I am terrible at explaining
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:23:58 Wait lemme try to put it into words
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:24:26 Magnets are the laggiest among the trio
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:24:27 anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:25:00 You know what I give up tryna explain
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:27:16 Same here when i was a noob and had this gigantic "plane" abomination I thought 500 speed was poggers
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:27:29 Wait I think I have a photo of the abomination I made brb
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:29:10 
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:29:12 here's the plane abomination
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:29:48 Its a plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 14:30:59 ~~Do you like my abomination?~~
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 17:09:54 I mean, it works
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 17:10:18 No need to spend too much time tryna fix an aesthetic problem
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 04:22:23 boat
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 04:24:48 Hmm yes definitely a piston engine
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 04:46:17 There's nothing illegal in plane crazy it's an anarchy game
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 04:46:29 With no rules to follow
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 06:50:52 Apparently I was just trying to fix some wing parts and suddenly my Horizon gained the ability to warp
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 06:52:03 :)))))
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 06:52:25 And I can now beat up AAnubis's flying zeppelin thing
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 06:52:35 probably
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 06:58:18 Another thing to note: I can't warp for too long or it will get unstable
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:11:08 Also this still makes my drone battleship superior in warping sadly
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:11:41 yes my drone battleship is killable
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:11:58 And way laggier too so it can never reach it's full speed potential
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:12:42 35k before it starts to uncontrollably pitch down
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:12:49 But theoretically it's infinite
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:12:52 Since it has no wings
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:13:32 A conveyor tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:14:21 hmm yes a car travelling at the speed of sound
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:15:10 True
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:15:17 sps x 0.18
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:15:26 = km/h
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:15:29 np
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:17:06 nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:17:53 I mean at such speed it's basically impossible to fight anything
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:18:30 At that point it's like trying to catch a speck of dust
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:18:41 As long as you slow down before anchoring
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:18:49 They will be fine
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:19:14 hm?
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:20:04 I'm not sure
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:20:15 Hold on lemme test it with my Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:21:20 Actually no need to test
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:21:24 No there is no limit
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:38:59 Indeed
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 07:39:38 If you say legos are trash how about you step on them first before you trash talk about them
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 08:33:44 You mean viruses
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 08:34:01 Actually i think they're bacteria
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 08:34:05 Since they replicate
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 08:34:40 Though they can be viruses as they can "infect" other people that get attacked by a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 08:34:56 Like someone could be amazed by the destructive power of a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 08:35:09 And so they would copy a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 08:35:22 In washing machine?
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 08:35:58 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 08:36:07 Np
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 08:36:41 Best thing I have is a funny spaceship that has been heavily upgraded to be more pvp ready
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 08:36:55 It's only 1.5k blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 10:18:34 I think one solution to pvp servers would be that players would need to play more than 3 days
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 10:20:15 Lmao
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 10:20:29 Wait wanna annoy him with blacklist breakers and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 10:21:12 Screenshot it
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 10:21:41 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 10:23:45 Wow a ton of builds are getting downvoted
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 10:24:07 I guess tanks are the best way to get a ton of upvotes with the least amount of effort
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 10:28:25 Guys who has a spaceship here? Who wanna 1v1?
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 10:28:31 I’m testinng my upgraded Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 10:28:47 Rip
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 10:28:56 But is it pvp capable already?
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 10:29:30 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 10:30:16 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 10:30:22 I’ll tell you when I’m ready
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 10:33:44 And yet they still build shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 10:34:02 <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 10:34:12 Oh nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 13:56:43 When wing too big
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 13:57:31 Anyways would a red/yellow/blue color scheme be nice for my Horizon? I'm tryna match the colors of the Philippine flag
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 13:57:41 I'm not recoloring yet
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 14:00:02 oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 14:00:04 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 14:02:09 What if I use anime color scheme now

plane-crazy 2021-05-07 14:13:58 
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 14:18:04 Breaking roblox
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:20:27 Ok hopefully this color scheme looks nice to you guys now
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:21:12 The Horizon from starscape
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:21:46 I'm reskinning it to match my plane crazy faction logo colors
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:26:42 **King crimson**
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:40:58 Thx
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:41:51 Ok here's the full recolor
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:42:36 Original
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:42:52 Thx

plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:46:52 Actually nvm I won't
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:51:37 Bro was physics update reverted
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:51:43 My Horizon is laggy again
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:52:05 Hello
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 18:52:22 Like the Physics throttling is too high
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 19:06:29 That was a nice accidental bypass
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 19:07:17 Step 1: get a conveyor drive
step 2: Warp into gatinsir
Step 3: Get pie ratted
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 19:20:39 Amogus mushroom
creations-chat 2021-05-07 19:37:24 Guys what do you think of the Horizon recolor?

I recolored it to have the colors of my faction
creations-chat 2021-05-07 19:48:03 Oh alright, but other than that, is it good?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 03:07:11 Bruv why are rockets so hard to color
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 03:08:15 Not good enough, needs more motor locc
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 03:10:05 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 03:11:38 Guys is the reskin of the Horizon good enough? (No motor locks here, cry about it)
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 03:12:06 The Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 03:12:16 Original colors
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 03:14:59 Wait I'm gonna ask more people in <#504436696021204992>
creations-chat 2021-05-08 03:15:37 Ok I attempted color fix for the turrets now, is this good enough?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 07:34:53 I wonder why people use 5-9 year old as an insult lmao
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 07:35:03 Shows how they can't come up with a better insult
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 07:35:26 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 07:35:50 I never needed to make insults anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 07:36:24 I insult u
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 07:37:02 What if I'm actually gay?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 07:37:08 
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 15:23:48 Bruv Physics throttle is too much
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 15:24:14 i just want custom blocks maker now so that I can reduce the amount of blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 15:24:23 And have less lag
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 15:26:08 And maybe other options such as symmetrical building mode
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 17:01:38 BOI I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD A TON OF UNNESSECARY BLOCKS IN MY HORIZON
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 17:01:47 Well at least I removed 100 of them already
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 17:04:19 deth
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 17:05:10 Actually 121 unnessecary blocks have been removed
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 17:05:19 Now I only have 1386 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 17:08:49 And now the first stability issue I encountered is that I accidentally deleted the helium
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:02:57 BroAre they spheres?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:03:05 Or are they sticks
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:03:14 They're normal shredder bugs then
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:03:45 true even camping them won't work
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:04:32 yep my Horizon is excellent at doing that job
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:04:52 
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:05:00 Starscape ship
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:05:06 Thx

plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:08:24 Especially this one
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:08:37 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 19:08:51 Well true it's too big
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 05:10:33 bruv I think I reached the maximum potential for my Horizon but it needs more lag reduction and maneuverability upgrades
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 05:10:39 Should I make a new ship now?
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 07:19:23 Anyone here I may join?
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 07:20:08 why are lag machines banned but shredders aren't
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 07:20:14 Seems unfair
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 07:21:01 It's a lag bomb not lag machine
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 08:27:23 Bruh lag update fully reverted
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 08:27:36 Noe servers are too laggy to even 1v1 in
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 08:27:43 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 08:28:01 And there aren't evven any big builds
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 08:28:53 I mean like I'm fine with low fps but if I'm getting physics throttle then that isn't poggers
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 08:29:05 Cuz then my opponent would have an advantage
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 08:29:08 In speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 08:49:10 Bruh
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 08:49:17 Even in an empty vip server
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 08:49:20 I still lag
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 08:49:22 hard
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 08:50:17 What is roblox even doing
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 08:51:12 
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 10:29:40 Chat moderators are becoming braindead
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 11:04:48 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 11:50:09 Should I make my Horizon amogus
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 11:50:29 Send image in DMs
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 12:12:13 
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 12:13:01 sus
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 12:13:52 Realism never existed in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:17:59 Guys do you have any tips in handling with physics throttle lag?
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:18:18 Like not fps lag
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:18:31 It's easy to get used to that
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:18:46 But physics throttle basically gives your enemy an advantage in speed and maneuverability
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:21:24 I use a spaceship btw
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:22:12 It just has 1.3k blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:22:15 Not that laggy
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:22:26 Like before roblox reverted physics throttle
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:22:51 Bro I can move around easily before physics update got reverted
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:23:10 But now It's like 700 sps is now like 300 sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:23:16 Bro even so
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:23:21 All my other builds are slow
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:23:55 Unanchor and reset
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:37:21 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:55:07 Use ice
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:55:14 It's very light
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:55:31 
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:56:04 Anyways my Horizon should be travelling at 700 sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:56:17 But it's like it's trsvelling at 200 sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:56:22 Cuz roblox dum
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:56:51 Also it has 4 conveyor drives that accelerate the ship to 10k within seconds
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:57:36 
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:57:43 Starscape ship
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:59:06 :))))
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:59:19 Oh I made my ship amogus
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:59:22 colored
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:59:24 a while ago
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:00:04 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:00:15 because I reduced part count that time
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:00:24 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:00:34 Welp it's no longer optimized now
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:00:54 cuz boblox removed physics update
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:08:09 <@!586404274477596682> Sup long time no see

So uhh, may I have link to VIP server if you have it please
bot-central 2021-05-09 14:08:58 !servers
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 15:57:53 Amogus
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 15:58:56 What's wrong with jojo
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 03:04:16 Does it function well?
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 04:45:55 
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 04:46:18 When the spaceship fleet is sus
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 05:56:28 Mortal I use both hover and conveyor drives in my spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 05:57:03 Hover drives to increase maximum speed and conveyor drives to escape from combat/dodge missiles
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 05:57:58 True I have to go down to 10k sps because if I anchor at like 15 or 30k sps my turrets die
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 06:00:13 Pilots kill people especially the ones that fly military jets or smth
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 06:00:19 That's what's wrong
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 06:02:07 He's a troll
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 06:02:17 Don't feed him attention
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 06:53:48 <@!723940197456281640>
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 06:54:07 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:22:16 Pvp server I'm in in a nutshell
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:22:42 We got:

Confused underage dude
Person who thinks a tower of tnt is a reactor
Spam car that isn't stopping
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:31:37 People hate creations they want destruction
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:33:44 
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:34:01 Guys do you have tips on how to get in the head of an annoying underage online?
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:35:08 It's rather persistent and he won't stop
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:35:14 Like he thinks lagging the server is funny
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:35:29 But I kinda found a solution I;m not sure it works
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:35:39 Basically he asked everyone to shut up so
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:35:50 One thing that should work is to spam his PMs
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:36:11 He should get annoyed enough to leave the server
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:36:28 <@!651361636657135617> <@!723940197456281640>
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:37:52 We spam his DMs
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:37:58 He hates people talking
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:38:02 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:38:38 Ok so
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:38:41 Type goldensword301
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:38:45 And click join friend
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:38:59 Also I will give the signal on when to start the spam attack
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:39:10 Or who will give the signal?
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:39:40 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:39:46 Accepted
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:39:51 I was removing inactive friends
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:40:02 Anyways wanna give the signal on when to start?
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:43:10 ok brb
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:45:46 What is it
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:46:03 He's really annoying doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:46:11 We basically use the annoying to get rid of the annoying
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:46:19 Nono he'd lagging
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:46:21 Using a lag machine
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:46:34 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:47:27 Also he said shut up a couple of time meaning he gets annoying from too much talking
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:47:59 Btw guys don't fire the warhead yet
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:50:40 Join us and be on standby cuz we're about to spam someone
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:50:53 But we're waiting for some other stuff
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:51:11 Use 2 saves mate
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:51:46 rip
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:52:05 Go melt some gold and drink it
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:52:13 Good luck btw
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:52:38 Sounds. Very sus
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:55:22 Spam attack cancelled
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:55:42 Everyone left
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:57:07 Also another reason: Roblox might see the spam attack as "malicious"
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:57:18 Last time I got warned for saying "free robux is scam"
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:58:15 Another reason: dude seemed to calmed down now
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 07:58:20 By not too much but its getting less worse
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 08:17:19 Even so you could be able to help
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 08:17:24 If you don't mind
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 08:17:58 Also I'm not gonna sabotage your tank with my very sus spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 08:39:06 Ah alr
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 08:39:37 Aogus
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 09:24:41 Is it absolutely fine to fly your spaceship like a plane?
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 09:24:52 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 09:32:49 Questionable image in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 09:33:07 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/841228884413644810
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 09:33:54 This dude is between underage and teenage I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 09:34:05 A 12 year old
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 09:35:27 I wonder how many downvotes would my Horizon with amogus skin would get
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 09:35:57 That’s sus!!1!1!1!1!1
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 09:42:44 Plane crazy hivemind be like:

**You will never reach expert designer**
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 10:07:30 You can make planes?
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 10:07:45 H o w
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 10:08:38 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 10:08:49 But can you actually kill stuff with planes?
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 10:08:53 I can’t even aim
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 10:48:21 For speed control
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 10:48:38 It's not within the 1-10 range though
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 10:49:36 Everytime you think you suck, remember my "plane" abomination
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 10:50:15 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 13:09:40 ~~Needs more motor lock~~
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 13:10:21 Tip 1 in plane building: Add a ton of motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 13:10:30 Preferrably 500 motor locks
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 13:11:25 There are tutorials about motor locking btw
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 13:11:33 Also I don't need to motor lock anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 13:11:43 I don't wanna lag that hard
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 13:12:48 It's not a God pc if you can't run games at infinite frames per second
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 13:19:10 Why are pvp servers absolutely braindead
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 13:19:24 bruv
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 13:19:51 I can easily deal with shredders if the whole server wasn't attacking my amogus spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 13:19:55 :
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 13:30:29 sussy
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 03:11:20 It looks like a tank
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 07:34:32 Guys what do you think of this suggestion?

Different materials have different levels of toughness to different weapons. 

Diamond plate and metal would have the highest resistance to guns and rockets but normal resistance to lava spitters, glass could be very resistant to guns and lava spitters but easily dies to explosions, ice would be resistant to lava spitters but easily dies to guns and rockets, etc.
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 07:34:40 Before I post it in suggestions
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 07:50:13 Bro pvp servers have become even more braindead than before
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 07:50:36 Ye I'm now avoiding that hellhole now
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 07:50:54 They were braindead before yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 07:50:57 But not this much
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:04:51 A tnt scatter cannon user keeps exploding my spaceship even doe there is literally a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:05:03 Tnt cannon user just wants to get shredded
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:05:55 Guys is this a fine creation? This was made back in 2019
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:06:02 One of my old creations
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:06:09 The other being the fat plane abomination
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:07:01 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:07:26 It's not decommissioned now because I have better pvp creations
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:08:02 Not only that it performs badly in combat. Used to be a decent pvp weapon before
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:10:09 Plane crazy tech has really become advanced now
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:10:54 Probably due to conflicts such as the 2019-present shredder war
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:16:24 Well there are a few helicopters in plane crazy that are actually decent
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:16:27 Well, 2 of them
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:16:50 1 is an extremely fast helicopter and the other is a helicopter with a pro pvper
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:17:09 I think the helicopter I fought was flying at 600 sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:19:05 Same here with my old BM-13. Used to be able to decimate planes and other stuff (cuz planes back then weren't very agile and were rather slow)
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:21:01 I think we should make big boxes coated with tnt armor in all 6 sides
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:21:14 And inside them are the propulsion and turret system
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:21:18 Idk how doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:21:24 I still suck at plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:21:51 Actually nvm blacklist exists
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:22:17 Hey wanna helicopter vs spaceship 1v1?
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:22:25 I wanna see how good this helicopter of yours is
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:22:50 or helicopter vs BM-13
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:22:53 rip
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:23:34 I'll wait for you to change the controls to something you would be used to
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:24:15 ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:51:24 Makes shredders OP
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:52:41 It allows them to pass through your builds, tearing up it's essential components and splitting it in half
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:59:24 So basically anti-shredder straight from 2b2t
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 08:59:25 cool
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 09:52:20 Guys who wanna do some shredder hunting
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 09:54:57 That's normal
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 10:21:41 Helium + ballasts
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 10:22:10 Nono
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 10:22:13 Put the helium on top
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 10:22:37 Huh Ima join u
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 10:24:15 rip
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:01:57 A discord user
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:08:23 Then my Horizon would exist and I would basically just camp shredders
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:08:44 Imagine needing to move to kill shredders
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:10:12 Ima go to the autonomous region of pcc called <#497142796961054721> for the first time
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:10:45 Plane crazy already has missiles
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:11:01 So it cannot be
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:11:27 Maybe flying small objects with drills in the front could be the closest thing we get to having shredders
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:11:56 They're not cancer cells they're viruses
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:12:47 In the future we can use genetic engineering to basically make cancer cells actually deal physical damage
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:14:44 I mean humans are basically space orcs
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:14:55 So we will probably making something like that
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:15:01 The Scientists specifically
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:15:16 Not us dummy dums who basically play plane crazy everyday
general 2021-05-11 13:16:32 uhh hello chat
general 2021-05-11 13:16:38 Just visiting <#497142796961054721> for the first time

plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:17:25 ~~(next thing you're gonna do is ignore this text)~~
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:18:15 Another thing to note is that the topic moves on too quickly
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:19:14 You basically just become another person in the endless crowd of other people
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:19:18 Who

plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:22:59 Wait lemme join u
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 13:33:20 sus
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 17:40:05 Guys do you have any reliable turret designs?
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 17:40:20 You know, ones that don't become inaccurate when you travel fast enough
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 17:41:06 Oh no my turrets turn fast
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 17:41:14 But like it falls short on accuracy
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 17:42:04 soup
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 18:09:14 Tbh I find rope machines beautiful
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 18:22:09 Guys what should be the primary and secondary colors for a soviet themed skin for my Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 18:23:36 Rn I chose yellow as main color and red as secondary
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 18:24:45 Something like this
creations-chat 2021-05-11 18:26:49 Guys I need help in makaking a soviet themed skin for my Horizon. Is this color scheme good enough?
creations-chat 2021-05-11 18:33:09 My Horizon becomes McDonalds now <:pain:644301805534183464>
creations-chat 2021-05-11 18:37:12 Oh I see so you're tryna match the colros of the soviet flag ryt? I was tryna make the primary color almost similar to the color of soviet tanks and then the red basically symbolizes the Soviet Union's lean towards communism

edit: oof
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 18:58:43 Imagine not being able to fly
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 19:10:35 Nice carrier
creations-chat 2021-05-11 19:20:31 He hates creation he wants destruction
creations-chat 2021-05-11 19:24:41 Also curious but what do you like and dislike? Also what is considered under detailed?
creations-chat 2021-05-11 19:27:17 Cuz you downvoted these and they aren’t even underdetailed (unless your definition of underdetailed is by not enough motor lock)
creations-chat 2021-05-12 03:25:17 So basically he pretty much has high standards that are hard to meet
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 05:13:19 Yep definitely more like a floating christmas present rather than a glorious soviet spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 09:05:58 ~~Space battleship Yamato > Yamato~~
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 09:06:21 rick > you
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 09:06:42 agreeed
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 09:06:47 Stickbug already died
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 09:06:58 But rickroll is still living
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 09:07:24 Shows how superior rick astley is compared to a small moving stick
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 09:08:32 Y pose when
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 09:09:39 <@!723940197456281640> Btw you forgot to lock your door and now I'm inside your plot
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 09:10:06 That works
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 09:14:20 Add the white part of the iron cross at the sides now
the-dump 2021-05-12 11:28:42 How is plane crazy educational lmao
the-dump 2021-05-12 11:29:08 Oh wait this is <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:45:48 Bruh what is this recommendation list
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:46:19 Well I mean build a boat is fine but
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:46:26 **Why adopt me**
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:48:02 ~~Also the very reason why roblox removed physics update~~
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:48:07 ~~since it didn't benefit that game~~ incorrect, check https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384021699466756107/842322494202445845
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:48:08 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:48:36 From what i heard forgot to add that
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:48:41 I'm not sure
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:48:58 Oh alr nvm
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:49:05 what exploits though
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:49:40 How can people exploit with improved physics
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:49:51 Well let's calm down now
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:50:05 I don't know that's why I said calm down
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:50:15 Ah alr
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:50:19 Btw where did you heard this?
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:50:30 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:51:08 So faster physics higher instability
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:51:09 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:51:56 ice
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:52:00 Lightest material
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:52:56 Maybe an option in roblox studio to turn on/off the "improved" physics
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:53:06 Since the better physics seemed to benefit plane crazy a lot
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:53:36 It especially reduced the effectiveness of lag machines (totally didn't use one)
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:56:30 Welp gonna play noob army tycoon
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:57:44 As if they don't break everytime you launch it
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 08:58:20 Of course they break everytime they explode that's what they're supposed to do
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 09:01:11 It's not man it's monke
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 09:01:17 ~~Oh wait monke superior~~
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 09:01:26 I mean monkey
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 09:01:40 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 09:06:58 
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 12:46:06 rip
plane-crazy 2021-05-13 12:48:14 
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 06:18:02 The whole cube is covered in cutters
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 06:23:07 Shredder bugs aren't automated doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 06:23:30 w
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 06:24:50 Imagine not being able to camp shredders ~~And imagine being an easy target for planes~~
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 06:25:23 Idk how do you guys even aim in a plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 06:25:57 I tried
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 06:28:25 huh camera locking?
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 06:28:30 Haven't tried that yet
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 06:29:33 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 06:30:24 aogus
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 10:07:50 I can travel 330k sps if I remove my turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 10:08:12 Oh golly
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 10:08:35 What's it's maximum speed then
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 10:09:19 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 10:10:23 Rip
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 10:10:27 Well mine is stable anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 10:10:54 Also the internal wings is what's keeping my ship stable
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 10:11:06 If I remove them I suddenly shift to like the right or smth
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 10:11:15 Glitcheey
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 10:11:53 My conveyor is too overclocked
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 10:12:21 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 10:13:05 Like it's too overclocked it makes me blast off beyond the safe speed limit within seconds (safe speed limit is 10k)
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 10:13:32 What's wrong with tentacles
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 10:14:21 steel ball
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 10:14:42 https://tenor.com/view/epic-embed-fail-embed-fail-nikocado-nikocado-fail-gif-21206120
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 10:15:00 Where did you get this information?
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 10:15:33 If plot size issues didn't exist then yes I could probably make that abomination
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 10:17:33 So is the new trend in plane crazy gonna be eldritch creatures?
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:21:37 There is but there's only 2 new species in the evolution tree
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:22:38 Shredders are actually decent builds, easy to control while still doing a fair amount of damage
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:22:56 They're just annoying
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:23:05 And easy to multiply
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:23:28 They're probably more related to Bacterias rather than cancer cells
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:23:53 Actually nvm both bacteria and cancer cells do damage to the body
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:26:10 That's objective. some may find shredders a work of art (well only kids do lol) some may be in the neutral zone, and most people like you find it to be an abomination that must be eradicated
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:27:07 Why not?
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:27:25 Seems fair that the vehicle should stop working after being severly damaged
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:28:38 Like how can a vehicle that has it's internals destroyed and chopped into 6 pieces still shoot guns and move around?
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:31:32 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:33:03 I hate the feeling when I feel smart and then a moment later I feel dumb
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:33:11 
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:34:10 true
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:36:34 What about different materials have different resistance levels to different pvp weapons? Like Metal and Diamond plate could be the toughtest in everything, Ice would be resistant to lava spitters but weak to guns and missiles, grass would be decent at guns, but normal durability to missiles and weakest at defending against lava spitters, etc.
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:37:01 But of course diamond plate and metal would have weight issues
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:37:31 Not all builds are made out of default
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:37:52 Spaceships in general are made out of ice so that they can have extremely high acceleration
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:38:17 It would be annoying at first but you can always fix it with ballasts
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:38:41 Btw different materials already have different weights
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:38:45 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:39:57 Let the dude dump all his ideas
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:42:04 monke
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:42:57 What about planes?
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:43:35 Then just use all ice
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:43:46 It's not like you're forced to use diamond plate or smth
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:44:25 Ik but even on non-spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:44:39 ice is good when weight is a big problem
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:46:30 **Want me to add more to the list?**
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:46:48 Ok

plane-crazy 2021-05-15 13:37:29 pro
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 13:41:38 More pr
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:31:34 Guys did physics lag get reduced for you guys?
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:32:06 Ok maybe it's because I turned on the air conditioner
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:32:20 Nono physics lag
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:32:21 Not fps
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:32:47 nope
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:32:51 rip
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:33:01 Thing is we're talking about physics lag
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:33:12 The one that gives your opponent an advantage in speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:33:23 Just kill them then
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:34:40 traink
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:35:53 Well if you can catch my Horizon which speeds up to mach 1 in a fraction of a second
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:36:14 goes up to mach 43 without turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:37:04 Because your level is too low
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:38:11 land train
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:38:47 Guys do you have tips for talking in <#497142796961054721> cuz that place is too active
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:38:54 And topics there move on too quickly
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:39:21 Yes
general 2021-05-16 01:56:09 What did the dude say?
general 2021-05-16 01:56:24 Oh alr
general 2021-05-16 01:56:54 When discord logo is sus
general 2021-05-16 01:57:14 Anyways Ima head out topic moves on too quickly
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 01:57:41 Hello westerners
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 06:41:01 Because half piston
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 06:55:48 Hello gamer gays and lesbians
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 06:56:11 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 06:57:04 Just use Mee6 or carl bot
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 06:57:08 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 06:57:17 Dank memer if you’e dank enough
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 06:57:28 Oh alright
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 06:58:47 How many of you have already made a spaceship?
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 07:02:18 Bold of you to assume you can catch me once I use my warp drive
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 07:03:24 Mine can do it in half a second
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 07:03:30 Even more actually
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 07:03:55 Ok you’re faster
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 07:04:31 Wait what’s your max speed?
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 07:04:49 110k with turrets and 340k without turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 07:05:32 Safe speed limit is 10k speed for me
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 07:05:44 That’s when I can anchor without my turrets dying
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 07:05:59 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 07:06:03 Conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 07:06:54 Helium and ballasts to make ship hover mid-air without falling, conveyor drive to make my ship go z o o m
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 07:07:19 I also use hover drive to increase max non-warp speed to 720
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 07:07:44 Basically my spaceship is made for speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 07:36:19 A war drive looks like a Panzerkampfwagen
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 07:37:13 A warp drive looks like a bunch of conveyors and motors arranged in a specific way that it allows a creation to blast off at speeds beyond 1k
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:16:46 Don’t worry it’s just another hater who can’t handle jojo
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:17:49 The anime? Yes. The person? Yes.
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:18:28 We have women in jojo
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:20:02 Yes but it’s too generalized. Not everything in jojo is gay
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:20:07 But yes we do have gay moments
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:21:02 How exactly lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:21:36 Otherwise let’s stop expending energy over a stupid argument
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:23:25 <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 11:14:58 Spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 11:31:25 Imagine not having warp engines
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:05:51 Not everyone has Asian IQ
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:06:21 same
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:07:47 They could've relabelled it to clockwise and counter-clockwise
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:07:53 Makes more sense
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:08:09 Wait should I put that suggestion in <#507673335816126509>
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:08:30 f
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:09:04 You can make planes
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:09:12 I can't
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:09:37 The best stuff I can make are spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:10:35 Thx for tip
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:10:51 Now I don't have to do more trial and error when it comes to motors and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:11:55 I mean I also will but there's 1 less thing I have to deal with now
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:14:26 rip
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:15:17 Well I mean spaceships are easier to make compared to planes since you don't have to deal with wings and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:15:55 Bro how do you even get the wing placements right
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:16:11 Also on how I make spaceships, just use helium and ballasts
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:16:15 Oh alright
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:16:25 Also use wings
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:16:33 Yes spaceships also use wings but we don't have to deal too much with detailing the wings
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:16:50 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:17:52 What about tonk
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:19:29 epic
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:48:49 Why not
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:49:21 It's not like I would get an in-game advantage other than better graphics
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:50:07 They could probably add a script whitelist feature or smth
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:50:53 Like whitelist different roblox mods, I'm not talking about plane crazy (just making it clear)
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:52:11 ah alr
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 16:24:31 Kinda looks like a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 16:24:50 Amogus
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:12:09 I just said it kinda looks like a shredder, never said it’s a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:21:13 No it’s a dude who’s in a tight situation rn
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:21:43 He’s tryna get out of this situation
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:22:51 What about give him a second chance. Only when he does it again shall we actually ping moderator
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:23:36 Well if someone pinged moderator then nvm there’s no turning back
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:24:41 Btw we aren’t gonna get mad at bad builds we just dislike tut copiers
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:25:13 Why get mad at him making an original creation if you get mad at him making a copied build
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:25:39 Oh alright
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:27:11 Kinda related to argument but cool status
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:29:15 Then how were they made in the first place
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:29:31 You said you copied them
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:29:35 Ah alright
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:29:41 I see what you mean by copying
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:30:00 Guys we got it all wrong or probably
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:31:36 He was using blueprints mate not copying from a person from what he said
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:32:29 Guys lets make a temporary server so moderator doesn’t use ikfin’s plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:36:11 Add wings that can turn in 90 degree angles I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:36:34 Wait lemme join u I wanna see it fly
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:36:49 I’m out of this server for now
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:48:57 What's the yt tut video for that then
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:49:29 Since you said it's copied
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:49:56 I mean we don't have enough proof to say that it's copied
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:50:37 Nvm
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:51:48 Though he did say he was copying blueprints
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:51:56 Not people
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:52:29 Probably the concept he used
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:52:54 True
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:53:10 So basically the answer whether he copied of not is: Yesn't
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:57:01 I wonder why a ton of people get mad for someone saying they copied. At least they were honest and not like the other kids that claim "they made it"
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:57:25 People just wanna start arguments I suppose
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:57:29 And fuel it
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:59:37 I mean I do that too
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:00:06 Wait Ima go ahead and leak the insides of my spaceship for no reason
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:00:23 
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:00:41 rocket is rocket
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:00:59 You can have a launchpad
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:01:14 They care more about how your rocket functions
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:01:35 Oh they weren't glass wings
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:02:08 I don't have any wings on the outside only inside lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:02:16 
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:02:19 See no wings
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:02:43 Just do a little turning I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:02:55 yep
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:03:00 also ballasts
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:03:07 It also makes the auto flipping system work too
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:03:28 No like the helium and ballasts keep the ship stable
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:03:41 And make sure it doesn't fall
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:03:45 lemme check
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:05:05 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:05:24 But the wings make sure the ship doesn't just slide uncontrollably in the atmosphere
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:05:44 Also discovered that it played an essential role in keeping the conveyor drive stable during warp
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:06:01 Bruv I forgot where I placed the 2 front ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:06:38 Nvm found it (and it's only 1 actually)
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:07:07 front ballast: 4.3 density
back ballast:2.5 density
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:07:10 <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:07:53 Yes thx
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:08:20 Maybe one day I might actually have to use the value 6.9 for the ship to work
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:08:49 Like without wings I cannot turn properly as I keep going in the same direction
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:08:58 Unless I anchor to force the direction to turn
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:09:52 Also I find spaceship building to be easier cuz like
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:10:02 You don't have a ton of problems with wings
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:10:14 Ah it's alright
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:10:31 It's just the drag
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:11:03 True I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:11:15 Though destroying my helium is a big problem
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:11:47 From that angle it looks more like a plane now
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:12:23 Rather than a plane pretending to be a shredder to scare people
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:13:40 To go 300 mph you need to travel 2678 studs per second
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:13:46 you would need to use hover engines now
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:13:58 Yep I just activate my warp engines
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:14:22 You need to travel 6860 sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:14:32 Ah alr
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:16:02 I think that if big map is gonna get added the small one should be kept rn
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:16:15 It should so that less lag
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:16:21 Especially during battles
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:16:41 Actually I agree
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:17:28 safe speed (minimum speed so that turrets don't die): 10k sps

max speed with turrets: 110k sps

Max speed without turrets: 340k sps

Max speed without wings: infinite
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:18:03 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:18:23 I can travel 340k sps and still be stable
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:18:30 4 conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:18:36 in case 1 dies I still have 3 other drives
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:19:09 I can put a lot in my bigger spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:19:15 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:20:00 Put wings to stabilize the warp
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:20:25 idk make the center of lift align with the center of mass
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:20:40 rip
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:20:45 Probably design
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:21:00 Cuz without my wings my ship just turns to it's sides for no reason
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:21:26 
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:21:40 Helium and ballasts so that your spaceship stays stable in the air
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:21:47 Wings for controllability
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:22:07 conveyor drives to basically just blast off at very high speeds
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:22:20 Hover drives to increase max speed /and turn as well
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:22:28 Rockets to turn and move foreward
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:23:09 Also I suggest using a moderate amount of wings for your spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:23:18 Too much wings make your drag too high
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:23:57 And too little wings make your ship basically act like there weren't any wings at all
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:24:16 In special circumstances I use magnets for docking
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:25:03 
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:25:06 sure
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:25:30 Behold my overly detailed docking clamp with motor locking
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:27:12 At least it's armored
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:27:30 Btw does it have good speed or smth
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:31:28 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 03:33:36 Scatter tnt cannons yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:01:54 Guys how do you even aim with a plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:02:09 I can't even aim at an average spam car
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:02:21 or any stationary small stuff
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:02:26 I can only hit big builds
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:03:43 And yet Ikfin is basically dominating the landsxape
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:04:16 Ikfin is using wasd
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:04:35 bom
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:04:45 omg ban!!!111!!!!!1!
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:04:52 I use wasd but I suck
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:05:20 I tried using mouse controlled pitch but it only improved a little
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:06:02 hak
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:06:41 j
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:08:01 I dare you to kill a shredder ball without using your anti shredder thing
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:08:12 Just with your plane alone
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:08:18 h o w
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:09:12 Who's megumin
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:09:38 That's expected
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:09:43 The game was still learning to build
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:15:32 pro
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:56:44 coming
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:58:01 nvm server full
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 04:58:02 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 05:30:41 I disconnected <@!651361636657135617>
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 05:31:08 I'm rejoining
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 05:52:44 Kinda unfair we can't make lag machines when the server is already chaotic
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 06:19:20 Pog
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 08:48:23 Except in this server there were more "braindead" players compared to normal players
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 08:51:06 I removed the anchoring problem long ago
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 08:51:52 No I'm talking people who are using shredders and people who just spawncamp everyone
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 08:53:02 
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 08:53:17 Also I do gotta admit I also have a turret problem
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 08:53:22 They get inaccurate the faster I go
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 08:53:31 And when I anchor at high speeds they get mad at me
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 08:54:36 I have 3 issues now with my spaceship compared to 6
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 08:54:43 And idk how to resolve the 3 other issues
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 08:56:34 Yes and I forgotten to turn on afterburner
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 08:57:48 fish
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:00:09 So basically you like shredders
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:00:33 Anyways let's stop arguing over why shredders and lag machines shouldn't be used as nuclear fuel
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:05:39 I mean there were too many and it's too chaotic that even just killing them wouldn't do the job
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:05:56 Ah alr
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:16:25 ok back
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:16:54 hover cars that spawnkill
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:17:05 From my perspective
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:17:58 Wait you referring to the multicolored ones?
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:18:04 Those are peaceful
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:18:22 But the others are just attacking everything that moves
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:19:18 It's only 1 person that's peaceful compared to like a bunch shredder supporting turrets and tanks
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:19:21 true
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:21:18 Unless someone is really dedicated at spawnkilling and spawns where ever you spawn
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:21:30 Happened before but at least the dude was not a plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:23:29 true plus I have good maneuverability and speed if it weren't for physics throttle
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:24:14 On an empty server I nearly have the same maneuverability as a plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:31:15 Flying panda fish
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:31:56 But if your maneuverability is too much then you won't be able to aim anything at all
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:32:15 Unless it's mouse control
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 09:39:34 Aight coming
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 08:00:20 Nice warp drive
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 08:00:52 Never
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 08:02:26 motor loccing
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 08:04:36 lcok
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 08:11:23 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 08:11:23 Someone do be lagging a server and there aren't any shredder bugs in the server at all
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 08:11:46 Well at least he crashed himself
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:18:04 Why do turrets get more inaccurate the faster I go
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:18:25 Like when I travel at 600 sps I can't hit anything properly
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:27:27 Guys should I make the Shroud from starscape?
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:30:00 Perhaps my sense of humor has seriously degraded
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:30:20 And it started to degrade even before Quarantine
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:33:59 Yes we've seen it already
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:34:05 But it is a cool concept
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:34:15 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:34:17 Just use text
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:35:13 I just said that I've seen it already
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:37:02 <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:38:46 
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:42:31 Topic moves on too fast too
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:44:30 Oh alright
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:45:47 I just said hi
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:45:50 Nobody responded
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:47:39 ~~China bad USA good~~
~~USA bad China good~~
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:48:57 Incredible
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:49:28 Guys who wanna watch the chaos in <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:50:21 Actually this is one of the rare occassions when <#384021699466756107> is more active than <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:51:18 What about we reverse engineer it
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:52:19 Why should I touch grass out of all the different stuff I can touch in the world
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:55:22 Then you're sus
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:56:44 "Straight to Hell. To the boiler room of hell. All the way down."
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 13:57:11 IF you are Atheist I am monke
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:47:14 What even is a death cube
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:48:57 What if I fling you first
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:50:10 Ima go ahead and then remove my turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:50:14 And then speed up to 340k sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:50:37 conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:51:05 oof
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:51:22 I also use hover drives to increase my ship's maximum sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:51:37 From 640 to 720 sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:52:02 
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:52:23 Imagine using variable speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:52:39 It's not boi
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:52:52 wdym unstable
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:53:39 Also another thing: I use hover drives to turn
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:53:46 Specifically change my pitch
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:55:02 speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:55:36 It's not a plane it's a spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:56:26 oof
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:56:37 Anyways I don;t use control panels to turn too
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:56:51 I use rocket engines and hover thrusters as I said a while ago
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:57:08 Spam as many shredders as you would like
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:57:15 They will all die if you try to attack my ship
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:57:45 He's not dumb, he's underage
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:58:08 He uses haxx
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:58:49 It's you
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:59:25 Btw I suggest using a hit and run tactic when deling withshredder balls
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:59:34 Though you need a warp engine for this
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 15:59:51 Mate my shredder flies at 600 sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:00:10 620 is more precise
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:00:23 True
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:01:12 How is vanilla illegal
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:01:29 (Sponsored by google translate)
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:02:21 Tbh my shredder is lacking in maneuverability soooo
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:02:25 Also I don't use it anymore
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:02:34 It's sitting in the attic
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:02:53 Wait you made good stuff as a new player?
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:03:12 No
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:03:55 **You're new to plane crazy and you're already making these kinds of stuff?**
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:05:43 Ah alright
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:05:57 Anyways my old creations are really garbage
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:06:05 delete that
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:06:25 Actually nvm he doesn't have the required brainpower to recreate that with an image alone
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:06:56 He's an underage
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:07:11 How old are you?
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:10:04 Hello

plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:12:44 It's anthro not rthro
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:13:56 ok mate
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:15:44 not all doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:15:55 Now lemme go back to spamming all the keys in the keyboard
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:17:03 They will be normal in infinite years from now
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:20:43 WHen you played for 21 days and still suck

general 2021-05-18 16:29:49 Because gamer
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:30:35 As you can see I am getting ignored because my social skills suck
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:30:44 
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:31:22 lag moment
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:31:46 Could be lag too
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:31:53 Too much lag slows down the player
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:32:43 
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:34:01 Could be done better
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:34:07 But it isn't bad
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:35:06 Remember.

If you think your build is trash, you clearly haven't seen this thing yet
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:35:40 Abomination yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:35:55 nono yours is more fine than this
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:36:04 It's literally wing spam
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:37:04 barn god
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:37:40 dabebe
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:49:00 Even metal is less dense than water
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:49:45 Ice is the least dense out of them all
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:49:59 Also a good material if your build is focused in speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:50:35 Wayy less dense I tried using ice for my "boat"
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:50:53 ended up becoming an uncontrollable spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:52:39 Ok shredder user
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:53:28 This isn't fully tested yet but hit and run may be a good strategy in killing shredder balls
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:53:35 Make a pyramid first
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:54:14 I will if they add more lava spitters
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:55:20 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:55:32 But what about aircraft pvp
plane-crazy 2021-05-18 16:56:19 oof
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:04:35 Imagine needing to use emojis when you can use downscaled images that look like emojis
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:05:18 :chet:
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:06:23 Or if you put too much emojis in one line
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:06:45 Like: 🤣🤣🤣
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:06:50 FOrgive me
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:08:12 coconut
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:10:46 Then unstroke
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:11:48 Because broken physics. This used to happen to my Horizon before I put wings in it
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:12:11 I guess reduce the amount of hover thrusters?
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:12:13 <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:13:45 That's a lot of wings e
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:15:22 perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:16:50 np
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:22:24 Use ice I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:22:32 very light
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:22:44 
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:24:13 Isn't that like the most unstable wing material
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:24:15 bruv
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:24:37 fabric wing panels.exe
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:25:02 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z93yjiEtgoshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z93yjiEtgos
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:25:25 Ima go ahead and use fabric horizon
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:26:27 
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:26:41 It do be very dark now
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:27:25 Straight out from the abyss
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 08:27:33 It also do be edgy now
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 10:18:34 anyone here who has some effective turret designs?
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 10:21:59 1st problem of my turret: It gets unstable when I anchor at high speeds (like 30k sps)
2nd problem: They get inaccurate when i go faster
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 10:28:47 I'm in the server
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 12:41:38 ?
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 12:42:02 I am sailing in the skies for the 1000th time
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 12:58:56 Good fish to eat if you wanna sleep early I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 13:01:36 Ok now I understand what you meant
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 13:01:42 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 13:11:18 What's so weird about Dihydrogen Monoxide?
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 13:16:09 What we're just talking about this interesting substance called Dihydrogen Monoxide
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 13:17:49 Bro mathematics is way harder mate
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 13:20:15 Heart attack moment
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 13:28:49 Spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 13:28:57 Futuristic spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 17:49:30 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 17:59:22 You just make rocket ez as that
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 17:59:52 Just make a long 3x3x3 cylinder and put a huge rocket engine below it
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 18:00:19 What is this
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 18:00:48 trol
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 18:01:18 On the top
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 18:01:31 The very top part
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 18:01:37 front top
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 18:01:44 yes

plane-crazy 2021-05-19 18:04:46 Idk why am I looking at old messages
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 18:05:32 Yes very cool plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 18:18:36 turet
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 18:24:45 Basically an anti-shredder
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 18:24:55 Can it beat up shredder balls?
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 18:25:10 Or perhaps shredder balls are just too OP
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 18:26:00 Also do your cutters take any damage or does it beat up shredders without a single scratch
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 18:26:33 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 04:48:52 Guys what was the longest battle you ever fought in? I fought a gray plane for 20 minutes straight no respawns
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 04:49:38 What about my dad
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 06:44:19 Not all tuts doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 06:44:37 DOn't tell me you learned how to motor lock without a tut
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 06:44:38 or fold
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 06:44:46 or make a conveyor or hover drive
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 07:28:59 Lag had been reduced again pog
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 07:30:33 Try it out
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 08:57:30 Imagine having a glitchy conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 08:57:55 ~~Says me to uses a tut conveyor drive~~
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 08:58:30 Huh strange
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 08:58:54 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92RnoE2DMfw&ab_channel=PrototrodePrototrode
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 08:58:54 Don't you use this doe?
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 08:59:00 use this
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 08:59:11 Put wings it should fix the issue
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:01:26 Idk how to explain this but conveyor drives like produce it's force across the whole build rather than stuff like hover thrusters and super rockets which only does it in a certain part of the build
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:01:30 Chat
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:01:33 Just keep chatting
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:02:16 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:02:37 And I figured out just now on how to explain how they work
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:02:45 Because my speech skills suck
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:03:58 I use conveyor drives to escape combat situations I can't win and I use hover drives to increase maximum speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:04:25 From a terrible 640 sps to an average 720 sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:05:15 Cuz I spammed rockets
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:05:38 
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:05:45 Look at the back of the ship
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:05:50 A ton of super rockets
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:05:58 The Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:06:04 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:06:08 Motor lock is for tryhards
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:06:48 grammr
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:07:14 It's a plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:07:35 You haven't seen my abomination yet
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:08:23 dms
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:09:29 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:09:53 Before I knew how to actually build this was a masterpiece
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:10:33 But now it's nothing more than wing spam and boxy interior
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:11:29 Oh no my first plane was smaller than this
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:11:38 This was my 2nd plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:11:46 You aren't wrong
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:11:57 Everyone's first plane is a tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:13:44 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:43:01 Ima just
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:43:09 Go ahead and join
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 09:43:25 Because I'm bored
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:02:21 It doesn't
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:03:05 Try to find some solutions to fix the lag if you can't buy a better pc
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:03:12 Or try getting used to low fps
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:04:25 Like what plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:16:53 He just discovered now that other planes also have a rudder
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:17:16 The concept of planes isn't new to him
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:18:25 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:19:14 Anyways m4cey1 has calmed down after getting annoyed by the lag caused by my spaceship for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:19:32 Why are people so pissed of at lag
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:22:32 It's just a donator tag, it doesn't give you an advantage anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:23:11 How exactly does it give you a mental disorder?
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:23:34 Nono I want to know how exactly
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:24:45 Then why do you think buying the donator tag  gives you a mental disorder?
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:25:20 That isn't a mental disorder mate
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:25:37 That is just me asking why are you so mad at my spaceship causing lag
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:25:40 Ok I'll stop
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:26:37 No I suck at aiming
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:27:08 Turrets get more inaccurate the faster I go
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:27:51 Perhaps it's because my turrets are too light
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:29:38 AT least rickje gets 70 bobux
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:30:23 Braindead wasn't the best word to use
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:30:32 I get it sorry about that
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:30:58 In your plane not your spinning cutter thing
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:31:43 Also it was a terrible shredder design anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:32:03 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:32:17 I mean at least I don't use shredders anymore
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:32:42 I did
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:32:48 But then I unbecame later on
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:33:30 Nope that was just me testing my shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:34:19 Of course I ain't gonna use it anymore I got a better creation
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:35:18 Starscape ships are plain anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:35:30 But at least they aren't overly detailed that they cause tremendous amounts of lag
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:36:36 If only I had 1k bobux
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:36:40 
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:36:49 Anyways it's also a fragile material to use as well
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:37:18 Nah I refuse to use display names
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:38:14 Actually my blue ship does cause lag
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:38:20 Because it's a folded build
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:40:41 Though it isn't a heavy creation doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:41:09 It uses ice, 2nd lightest material in the game
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:41:57 Though the true lightest material is actually wood (smileyhats told me also was tested)
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:44:02 blue bird thing moment
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:49:35 Not killing actually
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:49:42 But defending from shredders
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:50:08 It's more of a shredder resistant ship rather than an anti-shredder ship
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:51:04 *nu pls*
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:51:46 Btw don't linger here for too long this place got nuked recenty and the radiation levels here are very high
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:52:27 spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:52:44 pog
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:53:39 
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:54:38 Uhh you're talking to a wasteland wanderer
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:54:48 Wot battle
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 10:55:35 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:00:47 would work
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:00:56 And then throw random details everywhere
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:01:41 you know, stretch the tube, add some fins, commit neon spam, etc
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:03:39 The wasteland has become silent again goodbye for now
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:05:41 Legal lag machine
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:05:47 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:10:20 Open your autoclicker
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:14:57 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:15:53 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:16:04 Pog
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:17:23 Welp seems like the toxicity levels here has lowered already
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:17:55 <@!723940197456281640> Just curious but was my spaceship really that laggy?
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:18:11 Like during the times I joined your server
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:20:07 Ah alr
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:20:25 Lag momentum
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:29:00 I know
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:30:39 I wanna see if you can explode my spaceship especially when lag has been reduced a ton
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:42:32 speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:45:33 Guys does anyone have a good pvp server?
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:45:44 Not too chaotic but not too dead
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:48:08 Ah alr
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:48:51 thx

plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:53:25 coming
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:59:04 Because i hate shredders
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 11:59:59 probably you
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:00:05 Server isn't lagging at all
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:00:29 Try cooling down your pc
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:01:03 You know, turn on the air conditioner, make the fan blow air at your pc, etc.
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:01:52 so you don't rage like m4cey1
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:07:11 Use motor locking I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:07:15 and motors to adjust the wheel angle
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:07:42 If you do it you may get a bunch of upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:07:54 You can also try to do fine meshing
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:08:02 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:08:08 But I just refuse to swear
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:08:29 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:10:57 Though magnets are better for docking
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:11:55 Use conveyor or hover one instead
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:12:33 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:13:54 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:14:26 nope
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:14:38 You guys are pro if you can go below the void
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:15:48 Conveyor drives do the job better
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:15:59 I can go 340k sps in a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:16:02 without turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:16:08 within a minute
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:16:58 But if I put turrets then the max speed of my spaceship is 110k sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:17:29 safe speed limit is 10k sps (15k when lag update had been reimplemented)

plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:40:37 I kinda wish my road roller got more upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:40:43 so I can get designer V
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 12:41:04 Oh well that was back when you needed 30 upvotes to get designer III
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 13:40:43 People hate lag machines more than shredder bugs btw
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 13:41:13 Idk why even doe lag machines are the only effective counter to shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 13:42:17 It's like chemotherapy. You kill the cancer cell (shredder bug) but you also affect other rapidly growing cells (innocent players with toaster pcs)
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 14:06:57 Which dude and what drama
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 14:08:22 Dude do be casually pinging mod
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 14:08:28 delta wings
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 14:08:54 If you're that tryhard anough you can use motors and wing panels only
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 14:17:42 I would use it if it provides better advantages compared to ice
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 14:18:00 It's very lightweight
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 14:18:08 Making it good for big builds
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 14:18:42 I just changed from diamond plate to ice and my spaceship's acceleration and turning greatly increased
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 14:19:18 Like I accelerate from 0-690 within seconds
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 14:22:11 Wood is lightwr but for some reason ice is better on my conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 14:22:16 and wings
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 14:38:56 google
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 14:57:41 Bruh why do I think of stuff to say wayy later when the discussion has ended
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 14:57:51 argument in my situation
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 15:53:17 You literally made one
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 16:08:56 What's the topic of the build
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 16:09:41 Do spaceships count?
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 16:09:56 Or like an actual boat
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 16:09:59 water boat
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 16:10:23 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 16:11:44 Aight

plane-crazy 2021-05-20 17:05:52 aimbot ofc
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 17:20:48 When you're able to dodge attacks with ease but can't even land a single shot
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 17:20:53 
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 17:21:01 ~~totally not me~~
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 17:21:24 Spaceship-jet combat actually
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 17:22:26 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 17:23:05 Guys anyone here who have high accuracy turret designs?
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 17:23:57 But I wanna move in all 3 dimensions e
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 17:38:45 Spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 17:38:48 Build a spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-20 18:20:58 Z
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:20:23 Hello gamers
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:20:41 smort
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:20:50 20 studs is 1 meter
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:21:01 an average robloxian is 25 centimeters
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:24:41 It gives you colored name
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:45:37 Cool boat
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:45:43 Now make it fly
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:45:54 Oh cool
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:46:57 What's wrong with space boats
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:48:10 Because roblos
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:50:47 I wish I can make planes
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:51:56 If it's an original build I just say "cool build"

But if it's a tutorial then eh
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:53:09 Which one? The one in space or the one in water?
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:53:23 glorious
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:54:22 They're just kids, they'll learn soon
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:55:23 He may be exploiting but that exploit in particular sounds cool
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:55:33 if the exploit didn't cause lag
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:56:24 Guys should I remake my "plane?"
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 06:58:01 
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 07:00:52 ok back
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 07:01:47 probably but if it's functionality is better then ship is better
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 07:02:35 It's still a boat since it moves like a boat
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 07:02:43 Wait lemme search up the definition of boat
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 07:03:39 
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 07:05:02 I kinda miss outlines
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 07:07:56 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 08:32:16 trol
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 08:53:42 Roblos momentum
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:06:13 Lemme just reply to the messages in the argument about laggy spaceships from yesterday
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:08:42 Just gonna let you know that out of the 4 times we encountered you also joined me 2 times as well so if you think I'm joining you because I'm a "simp" then you're also probably simping for me (also why would you simp for me lmao)
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:08:57 Not my problem that's occuring blame roblox for that
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:09:52 I'm not the one who made the original model
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:10:06 I simply just recreated it in roblox
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:11:23 My ship uses ice, the second lightest material
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:12:24 I would've tried harder if that was the case
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:13:58 And seems like that's all I need to reply to I ain't the fastest thinker under pressure anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:15:42 https://www.roblox.com/catalog/6711806832/Brollge
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:16:14 bruh wrong reply
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:28:17 What's wrong with g l a s s
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:29:09 glos
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:30:06 Anyone here who's in a pvp server with some good creations?
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:30:53 By good I mean stuff that can actually destroy stuff rather than just spam cars
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:31:36 There are especially when I join my german friend's pvp server
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:32:02 smh just make a stick with wheels on the side and add a turret on top
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:32:03 ez
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:48:25 Hmm yes black holes shoot out matter
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:49:16 How do I improve my spaceship my turrets glitch out when I anchor at high speeds
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:50:15 Ok thx
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:50:26 Will replacing the turrets with hands work?
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:52:23 Ew shredder
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 09:55:23 Perhaps I have autism
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 10:22:43 When the lag machine is sus
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 10:23:10 Also there weren't any shredders on sight so he was intentionally lagging to crash the server rather than discourage shredding
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 10:24:00 Thing is it should only be deployed when the shredder is really getting annoying
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 10:24:07 To the point that everyone gets spawnkilled by shredder no matter where you spawn in
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 10:24:49 rails, airport, water, base, you will get demolished
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 10:25:00 Ah the tnt scatter cannon?
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 10:25:19 Doesn't work when the shredder is speeding at 500 sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 10:25:37 It looks like firework
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 10:26:54 Rickje should also fix the issue with motors getting glitchy when anchoring at high speeds (30k sps)
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 10:27:16 That's literally like the main issue with my ship
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 10:28:29 motor 2 with infinite torque
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 10:29:16 
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 10:30:13 10k if you dare
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 10:32:28 ~~locked motor2~~
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:24:31 kamikaze moment
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:24:33 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:25:06 Sleep
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:25:13 He is asleep
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:25:16 I meant
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:25:56 H o w
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:26:03 It's literally 8:26
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:26:28 Ah alr
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:26:37 We're in the same timezone btw
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:27:16 Cool bus
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:43:21 I mean the point of pvp is to kill people not build good planes
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:44:43 If they keep destroying your build then ye it gets really annoying
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:45:43 Wait you actually use fireworks to destroy moving stuff?
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:47:18 <#497142796961054721> is a hellhole
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:47:32 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:47:54 I've only ever used fireworks to fully destroy immobilized builds
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:48:38 Especially when server is laggy
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:48:45 They don't travel far enough
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:49:52 Guys anyone here I can join
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:49:59 I'm lonely again
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:50:13 All I see are just a bunch of spam cars
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:50:27 Aight thx
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:51:26 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:51:44 Also what build you using rn
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:51:52 So I don't accidentally kill you
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:52:25 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:53:30 docking clamp for my spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:53:36 Was too lazy to make a detailed one
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:53:41 Wait I'll show you how it works
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 12:53:57 nvm shredders
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:06:21 I like how the shredder bug isn't trying to attack my spaceship anymore it just gave up
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:06:56 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:07:08 Btw this shredder bug is seriously powerful
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:07:21 Compared to typical tutorial bugs
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:07:46 Also it's an original one so it does have a minor exception
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:07:53 True
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:08:00 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:08:04 I'll try
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:09:50 The shredder bug below my spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:10:23 Wedge 1x4
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:10:55 Half wedge 1x2 up
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:11:00 if you dare
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:19:42 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:19:57 Anyone here who has a spaceship and wanna 1v1
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:22:01 oof
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:22:06 Wait I'll use my older spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:22:21 Aka the one which isn't too fast
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:23:21 Helium, ballasts, and wings
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:23:26 Helium and ballasts to float mid air
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:23:34 Wings for drag and controllablity
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:23:48 True
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:24:12 It took me a long time to get the ballast values right
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:25:51 oof lemme join your server so I can see how bad it really is
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:26:06 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:37:55 Suggestions?
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:38:05 Sure
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:38:11 Can you send invite link
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:39:06 if people say it is then it's advertising
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:39:35 Is your computer hot?
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:40:05 Idk then e
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:50:03 Why not there's clearly shredders on sight
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:53:58 hmm yes vertical conveyor drives
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:54:37 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:57:54 anchr
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 13:59:57 Low angle of attack
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:00:03 idk what angle of attack is but
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:00:06 ye
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:02:41 glidur
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:05:15 birb
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:06:53 My Horizon used to have no wings before, it didn't spin and wobble
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:07:02 Same goes with my 4 other spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:07:34 u h
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:08:06 Anyways my spaceship did start wo wobble once I placed wings
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:08:19 Like when I travel at like 10k sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:08:24 I started to wobble
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:08:40 If you want to randomly pitch up/down then yes remove your wings
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:09:57 pysiks
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:10:08 All wings gone
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:10:18 Not a single wing block in your build
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:10:59 Lemme copy paste my terrible attempt to explain it
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:11:03 Since my speech skills suck
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:11:29 Idk how to explain this but conveyor drives like produce it's force across the whole build rather than stuff like hover thrusters and super rockets which only does it in a certain part of the build
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:12:37 Like when you place a hover drive on the left side you start to turn towards the right but with a conveyor drive, it doesn't really do much at all
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:12:41 Assuming your build is big
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:13:08 Also this theory of mine hasn't been fully tested yet
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:13:30 Basically evrything connected to the conveyor drive becomes the engine itself when you use one
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:18:05 Wait do you agree with my explanation
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:18:08 on how conveyors work
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:19:19 Like if your build is like very big then it shouldn't have that much impact
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:19:54 Ima test tomorrow because I need to sleep early and join an event
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 14:20:00 Good night gamers
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 22:49:19 What is that thing again
plane-crazy 2021-05-21 23:20:42 Anyone here who has a good pvp server

plane-crazy 2021-05-22 01:18:37 Idk how does it even aim that accurately
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 01:19:30 ye but some A10s are better in combat than others
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 01:19:39 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 01:20:27 Thing is Ikfin's has extremely accurate aiming
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 01:20:40 Something other planes don't have

plane-crazy 2021-05-22 03:55:34 Also can you DM UAV
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 03:55:42 g i b
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 03:56:10 I just wanna see how it looks like
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 03:56:19 Unmanned Air Vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 03:56:25 I believe
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 03:56:42 Actually IT's Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 03:56:55 I just searched it up
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 03:58:02 You wanted to know what UAV stands for ryt
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 03:58:39 It probably taste like every other metal
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 04:03:09 You'll end up with having to deal with cancer
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 04:03:20 But if radiation is high enough then probably
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 04:05:17 Sure what Uranium isotope do you want
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 04:05:34 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 04:20:06 Agreed
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 04:20:20 Though I prefer to call it symmetry mode
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 04:20:35 We know
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 04:20:44 All of us here know actually
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 04:21:12 Still it's fun to watch small aircrafts fail to shoot an obnoxiously big target which is me
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 04:24:21 Boi VIP server 1 is so quiet rn
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 04:32:25 Why did Mickey mouse turn into a tank
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 04:33:41 Tell us
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 04:36:47 Hello
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 04:38:34 "Dyno is the best moderation bot"
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 04:39:38 mouse
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 04:42:44 Wait what country are you from
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 05:42:35 I suppose you can make something you never made before
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 05:42:39 LIke a mech or a boat
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 05:44:01 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 06:10:54 It could the the strongest gate but the lock probably isn't
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 07:06:24 Guys is this a fine color scheme or smth
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 07:06:58 Tbh it kinda looks like a shredder with that color scheme
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 07:20:09 Has it been thoroughly tested?
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 07:20:14 Or you just testing it rn
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 07:21:34 It could just be shredder resistant but not anti-shredder
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 07:26:12 sure
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 07:26:37 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 07:27:25 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 07:48:38 Black holes don't eject matter doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 07:48:54 Ye that's more fitting
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 08:12:07 Ima join u
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 08:12:43 Public servers?
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 08:12:53 We do a little trolling there
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 08:15:00 Accepted
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 08:18:07 Joined a server already
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 08:21:10 oof
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 08:28:38 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 08:54:47 Ok I suck so much at 1v1 without turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 08:54:53 
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 08:55:25 Even with better wasd controls in my spaceship I can't hit anything without turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 08:55:49 missiles better guns second
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 08:56:23 In case your aim was slightly off the close tracking feature will allow missiles to still hit you
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 08:56:48 It isn't it helped me kill stuff with it
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 08:57:32 idk I never used tanks
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 08:59:00 Doesn't matter doe since if you're in a plane or spaceship you can always go close to your enemy and fire the missiles
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 08:59:11 And then your enemy explodes
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 09:00:39 Though I guess that isn't possible with slower planes
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 09:00:52 In that case just slap on some super rockets and hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 09:39:22 Why need designer rank when you already have an expert rank
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 09:39:34 Anyways I suggest making a cool house or smth
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 09:39:55 Sure
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 09:40:04 But thing is you're not gonna get any more rank benefits doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 10:04:00 Oh cool
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 10:04:03 Lemme 1v1 you later
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 10:04:09 Rn I'm easting fish
the-dump 2021-05-22 10:06:33 
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 11:45:39 Omg dream
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 11:48:14 What hole doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 11:48:22 There are a ton of holes I can die in
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 11:48:44 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 12:04:54 We should probably make an anti-shredder response team or smth
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 12:05:04 With occassional shredder hunting patrols and all those stuff
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 12:10:07 So those kinds of groups already exist
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 12:10:10 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 12:14:17 Shall we make a new one
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 12:14:50 rip
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 12:29:08 Void
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 12:58:59 Has anyone noticed how planes are getting faster and faster everyday?
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 12:59:11 Like 600 sps isn’t the standard speed anymore
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 12:59:15 It’s 1k sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 12:59:30 Bom
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 13:56:25 True
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 13:57:04 Like my drone battleship used to be fine enough but now it’s garbage in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 13:57:40 But I believe my Horizon should be future proof as I seriously upgraded it a ton of times
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 13:58:02 With a few weaknesses other than me having bad aim and my turrets glitching out at high speeds
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 14:00:05 Ok so uhh I just tested it now by removing the conveyor drives in the right side of my ship
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 14:00:13 And no there wasn’t any impact
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 14:00:27 It’s trash
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 14:00:40 Ok fine
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 14:01:06 
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 14:01:14 Here
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 14:02:44 Also this proves that conveyor drives basically turn the whole ship into 1 big engine I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 14:03:09 Rather than exerting it’s force in 1 part of the ship
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 15:45:27 Guys should I make this ship and make it fly
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 15:45:46 It's a Horizon class frigate
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 15:46:01 And since I'm a starscape fan I wanna make it and make it fly
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 15:46:15 Aight Ima do it
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 15:46:17 tomorrow
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 15:46:25 I need to sleep rn
plane-crazy 2021-05-22 15:54:24 You still end up with less productivity as you wouldn’t be able to focus properly
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 00:56:20 You can always replace the blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 00:57:05 Reduces block count doe which reduces lag
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 00:59:25 Speed is usually better than tanking power btw
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 00:59:42 Assuming you can deal damage
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 01:27:14 That's a rare jet to find
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 01:27:23 A jet that focuses on tanking rather than speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 01:27:36 True
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 01:27:52 Also jets aren't a major weakness anymore
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 01:28:06 My major weakness is garbage aim now
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 01:28:46 nooo
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 01:30:32 gamer
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:19:32 nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:20:11 How effective is it compared to a typical engine system?
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:20:56 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:21:06 My "boat" travels at 400 sps and 600 sps with boost
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:21:25 By boat I mean a floating diamond plate gun platform with high speed and maneuverability
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 02:21:46 lol

plane-crazy 2021-05-23 03:21:41 true
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 03:22:14 But my spaceship is only capable of travellihng at mach 49 without turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 03:22:41 That's basicallya  tremnendous amount of speed compared to what I can do
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 03:23:22 You used haxx >:(

plane-crazy 2021-05-23 03:37:30 Other than this shredder bug below me
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 03:37:39 It's an original build
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 03:37:46 And it's really powerful
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 03:38:09 It's not even a shredder ball but it's almost as destructive as one
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 03:38:30 <@!521642260228472833>
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 03:40:06 1 tip when that occurs: r u n
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 03:44:49 Shredders aren't even annoying anymore they're just a joke now
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 03:45:02 The real threat are the shredder balls and omni shredders

plane-crazy 2021-05-23 04:01:26 :Painandsorrow:
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 05:06:37 But it's painful when you're already 2 days into building something
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 05:06:53 I needed to rush to end the build quickly
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 05:11:05 Lag hell

plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:34:19 Looking fine
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:34:37 Coming from a person who doesn't even know how to put motor locks into practical use
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:37:01 In discord
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:37:21 Idk what is the server source doe

plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:40:27 Some no
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:40:38 But they all have 1 thing in common
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:40:44 They have no servers or mutual friends
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:41:07 It's like they joined a server, friended me, and then left
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:41:28 Have you tried accepting 1 friend request?

plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:44:02 nope
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:44:08 Guns don't damage your builds
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:44:25 Though fireworks and missiles can if they explode too close to your build
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:44:42 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:45:44 Just keep moving
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:45:50 And then make sudden stops and then explode them
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:46:13 Though you would need a build with high acceleration and speed doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:46:15 And with turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:46:54 No wonder why ground builds are so ez to clap
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:47:11 No add turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:47:51 Doesn't occur for me
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:48:10 Oh alright

plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:52:14 Anyways gonna go to public pvp alone
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:52:44 Sometimes it gets boring when almost no builds can kill you
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:53:20 Space superiority
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:54:27 Ah yes infinite death from planes
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:55:12 Assuming you can hit my 800 sps spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:55:46 Private servers have togglable pvp
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:56:04 You can turn pvp on and off in there
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:56:07 No problem mate
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 13:59:13 And maneuverable too
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:00:17 A real threat to my spaceship is Ikfin's anime jet
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:01:18 Perhaps he could also be lying
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:04:00 Why am I losing to a small and slow fighter plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:05:08 FInally murdered the small mosquito
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:05:26 In your bottom left
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:05:47 Like he says it's all skill
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:06:00 But there's probably some secret tech behind it
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:06:31 Not me because I am gonna warp out
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:07:22 front left, front right, back left, back right
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:07:26 I have 4 warp engines
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:07:50 2
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:07:53 1x1
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:08:13 What monster engine
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:08:15 Lemme come
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:08:40 Nvm
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:08:54 nope
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:09:07 Otherwise I would be blasted beyond safe speed limit of 15k
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:09:34 Beyond that speed anchoring is dangerous
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:09:48 anchor
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:09:53 Also helium and ballasts
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:10:03 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:10:05 Anchor block
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:10:16 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:10:31 I unanchor them
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:10:45 used to
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:11:03 Actually I still use them to full stop
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:11:22 for full stops
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:12:23 yep
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:12:57 Warp moment
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:13:13 Also I guess my spaceship is semi-autonomous
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:13:29 Like docking is automatic, rolling is also automated
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:14:39 For the docking, it's only automated when I dock in my own docking clamp. If I wanna dock somewhere else I still have to do it manually
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:14:52 For the rolling it's controlled by ballasts and helium
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:15:10 Prevents my ship from flipping upside down too and if it does, it flips it right back up
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:15:34 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:15:52 Though the only down side is that you can no longer be beyblade
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:16:33 LIke what flip
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:16:38 Like flip upside down or smth?
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:17:13 I guess I can do that
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:17:49 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:18:00 Rolling is fully automated
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:18:33 Not even a single bit
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:18:48 thx
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:19:03 Wait lemme check but it isn't a ton
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:20:10 Around 20 wing parts inside the ship
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:20:39 Both
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:21:03 Though it's more for drag and controllability rather than flight and stability
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:22:09 Oh they're so that I don't basically slide uncontrollably in the sky
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:22:26 Also eliminates the need for anchoring to turn
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:23:19 Idk probably because it's so big that the weight of the ship prevents it from shaking
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:23:37 But it does shake in warp if I let go of the warp key
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:23:49 Due to high speeds
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:24:20 Issue wasn't there before I added wings
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:24:49 True
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:25:04 Also wasd is different in spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:25:24 Like the A and D keys are used to turn left or right
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:25:48 And for spaceships that don't have automated roll control, Q and E
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:26:32 I've seen a couple of TiE fighters in public pvp
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:26:53 Also probably not gonna make one soon because
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:27:01 As I said before I suck at plane pvp
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:27:17 Unless I give it spaceship controls rather than plane controls
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:27:39 Ye probably
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:28:06 
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:28:39 Also the TIE fighters in public pvp actually look like TiE fighters and not made in china fighters
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:29:12 True
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:31:10 Also continuing this, how can it just be pure skill when he's literally using plane WASD controls
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:31:22 Aim is too godly
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:31:32 Something WASD can't achieve
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:32:15 da wat
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:33:16 Add more wings I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:35:19 plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:35:37 Hold on lemme screenshot my "plane"
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:35:46 By plane I mean stick with delta wings
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:37:55 Shows how bad I am with planes
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:38:04 
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:38:40 Look at it the center of mass and center of lift aren't even aligned
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:40:03 At least it's better than my other abomination
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:40:38 Ah it ain't the best looking but it's decent in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:40:52 Brb lemme get a better photo
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:42:47 
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:42:49 The Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:45:25 Unless the lag machine is used during severe shredder attacks
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:46:54 Why reinforce wings when your a 10 is already OP
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:47:22 Like to the point that getting out of spawn is impossible
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:48:17 I can dodge his attacks
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:48:25 He said he moves at 500
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:48:38 But he probably secretly upgraded it to 1k
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:48:58 In that case even dodging attacks is impossible
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:49:43 That won't work sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:50:23 Probably
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:50:29 wrong reply
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:50:33 probably
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:51:19 Good luck
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:52:15 When the RafailiNuu is mad
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:53:17 Several people are typing
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:54:11 I wanna join
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:56:11 doom
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 14:59:47 When toddler plays plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:25:48 Just wait 1 year my friend don't worry
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:26:48 hax
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:27:19 But at least he was honest to tell that he wasn't above 13
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:28:48 Also if you get banned you're probably gonna have to do a ton of stuff to get unbanned
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:28:54 So it's best to leave rn
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:29:08 <@!793873104039968798>
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:30:10 Guys does anyone here have good turret designs?
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:30:18 I need to fix my made in china turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:30:37 Cuz what's the point of going fast and dodging multiple bullets if you can't land a single shot
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:30:49 Too big
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:32:13 this big
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 15:33:42 Send in DMs
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:20:33 <@!605952678459342858> You have an unclaimed expert rank award
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:42:58 Nah wouldn’t take that long
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:43:16 It took me 1 hour to get rid of 120 unnessecary blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:44:03 hh
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:44:31 Hmm yes another OP plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:46:26 That’s
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:46:29 A ton
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:46:32 Of blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:46:42 Can you show me how it looks like?
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:47:41 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:47:48 Why so much blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:48:58 Used to have I believe
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:49:06 But then <#623337136267067393> died
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:52:23 “Dyno is still the best moderation bot by far”
- pepsimanrequiem
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:52:57 No shredders on sight?
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:57:41 How do you even do a combo in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-05-23 16:57:58 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 02:09:22 What’s wrong with that doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 02:09:44 True
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 02:15:24 B r u h why does my photo mode keybinds keep reverting
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 02:15:48 <#498473314445033472> I guess
bug-reports 2021-05-24 02:16:26 Idk if this is intentional but photo mode keeps reverting back to default
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 02:16:47 pickle rick roll
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 02:23:02 Amogus
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 04:33:38 Oh cool after getting update turrets my safe speed limit increased to 50k sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 04:33:58 I don't have to suffer from angry turrets now
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 04:34:44 ?
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 04:36:05 Plug in your speakers
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 04:36:11 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 04:57:36 Neon
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 04:58:03 Can I see
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 04:58:16 Also what are the modifications compared to Dam's elevator
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 04:59:22 pog
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 04:59:32 I tried to make that too but
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 04:59:33 I gave up
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 05:00:08 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 05:01:41 Bruv even with enhanced wasd controls and better turrets I still can't hit planes
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 05:28:49 at high speeds
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 05:28:58 Also planes are too fast
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 05:29:35 pain
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 05:29:39 
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 06:08:50 Bro why sacrifice speed for looks
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 06:24:51 But then you go slower doe .-.
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 06:24:59 But ok I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 06:26:26 True
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 06:27:03 I'm more about function rather than looks anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 06:27:39 motor locked hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 06:31:19 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 06:59:00 Guys how do I fix bad aim
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 06:59:07 The only final issue I have
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 06:59:18 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 06:59:36 Thing is FPS games have like instant travel bullets
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 06:59:38 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 07:04:07 Hmm yes recoil
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 07:08:05 <@!651361636657135617> Where are you
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 09:53:46 OK I am back
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 09:53:57 Make ship fly
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 09:54:13 I promise you won't regret making your ship fly
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 09:58:19 ye
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 10:19:59 speed and agility
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 10:57:25 Helium and ballasts
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 10:58:02 aogus
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 11:02:39 Guys how do you even align the center of mass and lift together without having to sacrifice looks or smth
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 11:02:49 In a plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 11:06:08 hello
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 11:24:13 Like what's the best speed to fire rockets
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 11:25:36 Bold of you to assume we have pro aim
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 11:25:48 death
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 11:37:03 So Ikfin uses mouse control
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 11:37:10 Probably mouse control + wasd
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 11:37:12 pro
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 11:38:04 See? I told you it's not just pure skill
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 11:38:47 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 11:39:04 Well it's no longer secret
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 11:39:20 
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 11:39:47 Your pvp skill
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 11:39:50 and tech
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:10:23 1 tip: get speedy plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:10:46 And run
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:11:07 There's no way you can fight that pink jet
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:12:21 kamikaze
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:14:28 Tnt has infinite HP
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:14:31 ofc
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:15:33 Fireworks are the most powerful weapon in terms of brute power
Missiles are in the middle zone
Guns are the most powerful weapon in terms of range
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:15:50 pain
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:16:16 Also what's so special with VTOL doe
the-dump 2021-05-24 12:19:35 This is why I rarely chat in <#497142796961054721>
the-dump 2021-05-24 12:19:39 Well the second reason
the-dump 2021-05-24 12:20:02 bom
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:22:37 I like how <#384021699466756107> is less toxic than <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:22:52 Despite the 2 being both general channels, just with different names
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:23:30 OH golly
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:23:49 Also actually <#384021699466756107> can sometimes get chaotic doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:24:19 Go read the chat from here
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:24:35 All started when some dude complained about my laggy spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:24:43 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:25:04 And then later on I started to get roasted
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:25:16 Luckily I was in a tnt armored bunker that time
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:25:34 amogus
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:26:35 Also this is where the argument truly started to get heated
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:27:31 super jetpack
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:27:42 when super jetpack gamepass
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:28:13 Truly the fight of the history
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:28:24 Imagine if you can have handheld guns in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:28:51 Just a bunch of noobs in the ground shooting your gray spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:29:36 Armor increase but speed decrease
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:29:39 
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:30:04 base speed is 300
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:30:12 Speed with afterburner is 700-1k
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:30:37 Also I call base speed maneuverability mode
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:30:44 As my turning speed increases when I slow down
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:31:01 It's a myth
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:31:10 Wait actually
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:31:15 Let's test it out
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:32:16 vip
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:32:21 Ok so here's how we do test
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:32:29 just shoot each block 5 times
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:32:39 guns
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:32:44 Just guns
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:32:51 true
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 12:34:57 rip
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 13:25:11 That's why they're hackers
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 13:25:20 They basically cheat their way to the top
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:11:57 12
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:14:26 
general 2021-05-24 14:25:08 fireworks are the closest match to this
general 2021-05-24 14:25:32 But imagine true flak turrets
general 2021-05-24 14:25:38 plane death
general 2021-05-24 14:26:09 Imagine tractor turrets now
general 2021-05-24 14:26:53 I can finally create the manifestation of fear with my plane crazy Horizon
general 2021-05-24 14:27:03 yes
general 2021-05-24 14:27:09 ~~But you white name~~
general 2021-05-24 14:27:51 (also one of the rare instances when I don't get ignored in <#497142796961054721>)
general 2021-05-24 14:30:43 I usually get ignored here
general 2021-05-24 14:30:57 Which is why I chat more in <#384021699466756107>
general 2021-05-24 14:31:12 Not to mention the higher toxicity levels and the topic randomness here
general 2021-05-24 14:31:36 Yes
general 2021-05-24 14:32:21 Good
general 2021-05-24 14:32:29 Finally upgraded my turrets today
general 2021-05-24 14:32:40 And got rid of the made in china turrets I had before
general 2021-05-24 14:32:48 My spaceship turrets
general 2021-05-24 14:33:09 They're the only part of my Horizon that isn't starscape-like
general 2021-05-24 14:33:20 Oh I was talking about plane crazy
general 2021-05-24 14:33:24 And yes I use beams
general 2021-05-24 14:33:31 
general 2021-05-24 14:34:17 Thx
general 2021-05-24 14:34:27 He hasn't seen it
general 2021-05-24 14:34:35 And I wanted to show the new turrets
general 2021-05-24 14:35:22 Oh I see
general 2021-05-24 14:35:25 Ok I'll stop warping into people
general 2021-05-24 14:36:14 Lag machine?
general 2021-05-24 14:36:19 <@!552959304647442433>
general 2021-05-24 14:36:44 I also have one and no I won't. It's needed especially during severe shredder attacks
general 2021-05-24 14:36:57 When the shredder makes the game unplayable
general 2021-05-24 14:37:27 So you're saying that shredders should be left alone?
general 2021-05-24 14:37:33 And just destroy everyone?
general 2021-05-24 14:37:36 bruv
general 2021-05-24 14:38:07 I'm also talking about situations where-in pvping normally is impossible
general 2021-05-24 14:38:39 SOmetimes shredders get really persistent
general 2021-05-24 14:38:47 And if they're an omni bug
general 2021-05-24 14:40:08 So basically just leave the shredder alone then
general 2021-05-24 14:40:24 bruh
general 2021-05-24 14:40:36 Ima head out
general 2021-05-24 14:40:48 An argument is starting rn
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:44:43 It's strange how the rules don't allow lag machines to be used but shredder bugs are
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:44:58 Especially omni bugs
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:45:14 They're as equally as disruptive as a lag machines
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:45:57 You have a point
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:46:17 Well at least you do compared to the people in <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:46:43 They tell me to stop using a lag machine but they don't give a reason why
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:47:08 hax
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:47:49 Maybe give a better reason?
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:47:53 Other than it's just worse
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:48:29 We're talking about advanced ones
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:48:31 Omni bugs
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:48:42 Not the flying sticks
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:49:51 Well unless they stop
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:50:07 If it's a fast one and it's like an omni bug it's impossible to hit it
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:50:12 Unless you're ikfin or smth
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:50:17 With godly aim
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:51:12 I already agreed with <@!447221768520859659> 's reason btw
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:51:18 But I wanna know your reason too
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:51:42 I did read back
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:52:07 How about we stop arguing over why we shouldn't use mayonaise for nuclear fuel
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:52:52 Idk I just thought of it
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:54:27 I use a big build but I can still evade
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:54:35 You just need to be faster than the shredder
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:54:42 And maybe average maneuverability
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:56:10 Perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 14:57:05 Boi people in pcc get really aggressive when arguing
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:00:05 Hmm yes bomber plane tutoril
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:07:57 Also <@!404632014189494293> You spent 4 months on a plane?
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:07:59 h o w
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:08:53 rip
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:09:00 But you have 1 thing: motivation
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:09:18 I'm the blue spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:09:38 true
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:09:46 Has a really unique design
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:10:01 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:10:41 One time a shredder ball was so persistent nobody could escape spawn
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:10:51 Not even airport
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:10:53 or water
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:10:55 or train
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:11:01 Every spawnpoint is death zone
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:18:18 game froze
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:18:43 doom
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:19:03 You basically made a lag machine
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:19:10 Or rather a game crasher
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:19:32 Ultimate anti-shredder weapon
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:19:36 But illegal
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:20:03 rejoining
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:53:35 You’re not alone
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:53:55 But what do you specialize in doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:54:20 Boat? Tank? Spaceship? Train?
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:54:29 ~~Shredder bug?~~
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:55:37 My best build is literally a gray and white speedy boi
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:55:45 With little detail
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:56:03 I haven’t made a detailed build yet
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 15:56:34 Smok
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 16:05:32 what
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 16:06:03 *optimiz*
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 16:08:16 People want to ride my build all the time
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 16:08:27 like bruv
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 16:09:18 what is
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 16:09:21 what is that thing
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 16:24:30 It shares the same trait: cutters
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 16:24:46 It's just a recent shredder species
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 16:58:57 But it should probably come in a nerf. I guess it could be 1.5x heavier than normal
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 16:59:13 Or 1.25x actually
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 16:59:25 Ice is ridiculously light anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:04:34 Perhaps rockets should start slow but then their speed slowly ramps up
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:04:56 To a maximum of 1k sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:05:35 Or spamming all 10
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:06:15 We definitely need armor blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:06:53 long gun
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:07:31 Imagine not using tnt armor
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:08:00 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:08:04 Tnt blocks are invincible
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:08:29 But if your build is fast enough tnt armor is useless
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:08:39 Assuming you only have 150 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:09:18 Though you can armor your vulnurable parts
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:12:45 Guys how do I improve plane crazy aim
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:13:11 Since my trash aim is basically making my spaceship bad
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:13:48 send help
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:15:56 Spaceship ofc
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:15:59 Plane pvp is hard
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:16:58 Wasd and turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:17:47 I like to call it enhanced WASD because of how the controls are easier to use compared to plane WASD
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:18:22 But the problem really is on my aim
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:19:02 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:47:30 "bc i am not a coward like you"
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:47:32 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:47:44 Check the chat
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 17:49:03 Same
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 19:39:41 Make magnet drive
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 19:40:05 Trust me magnet drive is faster than conv and hover thruster no scam 100% legit
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 19:40:39 Wait seriously?
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 19:40:45 I never used magnet drives
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 19:41:21 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 19:43:26 Also yes you can
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 19:44:14 
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 19:44:28 oh e
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 19:46:49 Well this works
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 19:50:04 In fact I use hover drives and conveyor drives in my spaceship too
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 19:50:28 Also hover drives isn't that fast
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 19:50:33 or magnet
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 19:50:39 Actually nvm they are
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 19:50:49 Just make conveyors ultra fast
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 19:51:05 The conveyor drives literally send me at 10k sps within 1 second
plane-crazy 2021-05-24 19:51:50 True
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:39:24 Cool looking sight
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:41:29 So my abomination but small
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:45:18 POG
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:45:26 That actually looks pog
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:45:52 Wait huh
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:46:08 How did you do a collab with someone without whitelist
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:47:23 Oh I see
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:47:52 Oh I see
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:48:27 Oh I see
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:48:31 Ok I'm in my laptop rn
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:48:40 Internet is so slow in my iphone
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:49:06 <@!155149108183695360> Not my problem my iPhone had bad internet
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:49:29 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:50:35 Definitely
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:51:48 Eternal pain
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:54:03 Also is my turret on the right good?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:54:17 It's slightly more accurate, pop resistant, and wobble proof
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:54:35 And can carry more guns
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:54:41 ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:55:07 spare me pls
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:55:56 Just give it some time and it will obliterate
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:56:03 Stats?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:56:24 What's it's sps? Does it turn good? How much bombs does it drop?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 03:56:33 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 04:08:33 It’s literally in the daylight right now .-.
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 04:08:42 Pog
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 04:57:18 pain
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 04:58:33 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:01:23 I wonder how good my spaceship would be in pvp if I gave a copy to someone with good aim
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:06:47 Actually not only with good aim but with good skill overall
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:08:20 Well tbh piloting my spaceship requires like minimal skill due to "enhanced WASD controls"
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:10:03 Better and easier controls
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:10:13 Rolling controls are automated due to helium and ballasts
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:10:24 And A and D turn left or right
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:10:34 Rather than roll like in a plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:10:43 So I don't have to do the work
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:10:56 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:11:53 But what's the point of rolling when you can turn left or right already
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:12:32 Cuz rolling makes left/right easier anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:12:35 Yaw is very slow
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:12:57 Also do you have good aim and time to recreate my spaceship?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:13:10 I wanna see how good it performs when someone with good aim gets a hold of it
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:13:40 Ah alright
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:13:53 After all it has like 1422 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:14:43 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:14:58 Also another reason not to make my spaceship is because it has like 19 keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:15:26 And it's gonna be time consuming to get used to them all
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:16:03 pro
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:20:36 And then I would have a major weakness because another spaceship with the same speed would be chasing me and I can't easily get out of combat
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:21:52 Gamer
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:28:55 Amogus
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:31:44 Yorue
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:32:45 Also this hasn’t been thoroughly tested yet but Ikfin cannot destroy my spaceship if I am using afterburner
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:32:53 No conveyor used
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:33:16 No u
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:33:31 Best insult I can make because I suck at making insults
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:33:55 Gamer
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:36:04 Jojo
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:38:27 He would be too busy killing slower targets
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:38:58 My spaceship is just too fast for it’s size
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:39:10 ~~cuz I use hover~~
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:39:34 True
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:39:50 Also to achieve 300k sps I need to remove my turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:39:58 Even with the pop resistant turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:40:06 Safe speed limit is 80k
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:40:19 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:40:44 Delete them
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:41:54 Rip
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:42:19 So do you have good aim and have time to recreate my spaceship?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:42:28 Should just take 4 hours or so
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:42:29 Nvm
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:43:43 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:44:05 OH GOLLY
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:44:34 Rapid fire shotgun
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:46:38 This is a really decent scatter cannon thing
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:47:00 I might mount that in my spaceship I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:47:11 True
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:49:27 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:52:54 Is anyone here in a decent pvp server?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 05:53:22 
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 06:15:04 I can't aim at anything
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 06:19:15 It's 2pm here
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 06:19:38 *Asia moment*
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 06:29:29 You getting expert rank?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 06:34:26 How do you get the modeler and inventor role e
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 07:16:06 Inventable
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 07:22:02 Hey do you have good aim and time to recreate my spaceship?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 07:22:14 I want to see how good it is when someone with good aim gets a hold of it
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 07:32:37 But iz gud at pvp?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 07:42:04 Screenshott
creations-chat 2021-05-25 08:10:14 <@!642524491439800330> What are your plane stats (sps, turning, guns and rocket amount, etc)
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:21:48 Want a picture of the internals?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:22:05 Or you gonna do everything yourself
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:24:00 Oof I’ll be right back!
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:24:08 Oh wow
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:24:21 I forgot I added keyboard shortcuts in my iphone
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:33:03 Normal picture
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:33:06 Internals
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:33:20 Front ballast position and value
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:33:31 Back ballast position and value
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:33:47 Reports don't work
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:34:19 Actual Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:35:05 Thx
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:37:03 <@!651361636657135617> Here are most of the pictures you need to recreate my Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:37:33 starscape ships*
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:38:15 ono
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:38:28 Also if you're pro enough you can do some serious motor locking to make it resemble more closely to the actual one
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:39:03 Mine was made for pvp, not looks anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:43:36 True which makes them good for pvp
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:43:41 They're not overly detailed
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:43:48 Which means not a ton of lag
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:44:45 Also another thing: starscape ships have a ton of internal space inside
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:44:58 If you are good at optimizing builds
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:45:01 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:45:10 For mechanisms
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:45:22 Warp drive, afterburner, turning
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:45:31 That
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:45:42 Motor lock causes a lot of lag
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:45:49 Well
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:45:51 If you use a ton
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:46:14 If you use a ton I said .-.
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:46:28 But just 1 motor lock should be fine
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:46:33 or 10
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:47:02 Oh cool
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:48:40 :WeeWoo:
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:53:24 Imagine a starscape ship that's actually very detailed
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:53:41 soon ™️
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:54:42 pee
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:59:28 
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:59:34 Sup
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 08:59:46 Big oof
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:00:17 Wait can you appeal blacklists?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:00:47 It's like 1 way to get expert rank rather easily I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:01:00 A lot of freedom in choosing what to build
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:02:50 A book is something with a lot of papers containing text connected together. Usually contains information. Best explanation I can make.
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:04:09 A text is basically a bunch of letters arranged in a specific way in order to form a word. 
Another best explanation I can make because I suck at explaining.
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:06:41 A letter is a symbol that's part of a certain language like English or Filipino. They're used to form words in a language.
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:07:00 This is getting harder and harder
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:07:03 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:07:08 æ
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:08:01 A symbol is basically uh
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:08:05 You know what I give up
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:08:26 But they're basically drawings or doodles that contain meaning
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:09:19 W H A T
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:09:33 Bruh I'm gonna have a harder time destroying shredders
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:09:36 Lemme check
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:10:03 Why not use bait and run
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:10:16 Seems pretty effective
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:10:49 More like a ball in a haystack
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:11:08 Then why you designer III and not designer V
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:12:11 Actually I misread the message
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:12:18 bruvuh
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:12:51 Have you tried optimizing the build?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:13:09 Like remove unnessecary parts and replacing blocks with beams and stuff like that
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:13:16 Ye optimize it
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:13:31 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:13:53 Oh golly
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:14:00 Also why did you fold too early
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:14:19 Wait is that build folded
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:14:32 You seem to have a lot of space in the front doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:14:51 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:16:09 Wot
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:20:56 overhaul
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:21:16 It's ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:21:25 Grammar doesn't exist here
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:21:48 Only eternal shredder pain
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:23:30 Maybe we could have some futuristic weaponry?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:23:33 idk
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:25:31 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 09:45:49 Bruh roblox physics is starting to slow down again
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 10:55:55 Eternal pain
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 10:56:30 Actually nvm it's just me hitting the island propellers but surviving
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 10:57:03 All it did was cut off my center right turret
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 10:57:28 After that physics throttle became rampant
general 2021-05-25 11:25:02 Who is this dude
general 2021-05-25 11:25:12 Who is this deleted user dude
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:31:17 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:31:38 I actually go to pvp and just hope I find a powerful build
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:31:49 Not just another braindead spam car
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:33:08 Later
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:33:24 What about we do catfight
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:34:04 Mickey mouse armor

plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:43:51 Highest DPS in the game I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:44:21 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:44:28 Nah
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:44:34 I want *speed*
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:45:06 Use moderator perms and just chat in suggestions
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:46:36 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:46:42 I just don’t need armor
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:46:52 I need 0 weight blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:47:34 Perhaps I’m prioritizing speed too much
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:48:43 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:48:59 Perhaps we’re polar opposites

plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:50:16 Guys should I upgrade my average maneuverability?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:50:40 I don’t sacrifice speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 12:50:46 Maneuverability is part of speed

plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:34:11 The anti-air plane
the-dump 2021-05-25 14:46:36 
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:47:47 Where's the typhoon I don't see any storm clouds
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:47:55 The skies are clear
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:48:52 Sounds like a pog idea
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:49:06 Anchor and run
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:49:09 Just anchor
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:49:14 And then once they're close you shoot and run
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:49:43 A TON of motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:49:55 You need to make your build extremely detailed
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:50:25 Of course lag
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:50:51 You'll need to get a speedy plane then
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:51:11 So you force the shot to come from behind
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:52:44 I ain't adding 1 motor lock to my spaceship just so that I can have details
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:53:36 Family friendly plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:54:08 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:54:47 Also at least there isn't a rampant spaceship population
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:54:59 Otherwise my spaceship would run into trobule like your plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:56:08 Oh no not a 2k sps space fighter
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:56:13 s h o w
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:56:34 My spaceship is both the targeter and the targetted
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:57:28 Looks fine
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:57:50 My spaceship is lacking both in details and in armoring
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:58:03 But at least I don't have to deal with absurd weight
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:58:38 Ice better
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:58:49 I did
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:58:56 It's extremely light
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:59:05 Pog
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:59:23 At least I have the power of speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:59:25 glass
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:59:41 Also I did
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:59:47 My spaceship is mostly beams
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 14:59:58 But at least my acceleration is really high
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:00:04 I go from 0-700 in 1 second
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:00:06 no conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:00:21 o no
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:01:46 I also have below average/average maneuverability
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:02:20 Since it turns slower than an average plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:03:12 It takes 5 seconds to turn 360º without having to pitch for higher turning speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:03:55 Like enhanced WASD?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:04:03 Since it's a spaceship of some sorts
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:04:08 Space fighter actually
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:04:19 It's basically easier controls
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:04:26 A and D turn left/right
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:04:29 And rolling is automated
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:05:19 You can't have automatic and manual rolling at the same time
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:05:26 doe

plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:22:05 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:22:23 Also you basically upgraded your plane a ton of times?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:22:28 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:51:30 Reduce torque
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:51:56 Makes car go slower
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:52:21 Unless if it's because of unequal weight distrubution then yes ballasts is effective
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:56:54 Exactly
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:57:07 I've been trying to search for pvp servers with powerful builds
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:57:42 then unbored
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:57:51 I sleep late anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:58:22 For a newbie like you (I assume you are)
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:58:53 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:59:00 is
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:59:12 Exactly
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 15:59:14 My bad
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:00:13 This is my best build back then
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:00:20 Back in 2019
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:00:27 Recent photo and a little editing
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:01:03 It could've gone differently doe if I played the game after shredder attacks became rampant
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:01:16 I would've probably stayed as a noob
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:01:47 I'm also still noob
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:01:51 In terms of designing
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:02:14 But when it comes to like adding function and making stuff good at what they do I guess I'm decent at that
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:02:20 Probably

plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:05:10 Gonan see what the popular kids there are up to
general 2021-05-25 16:05:48 pixl
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:08:51 What are these people up to
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:09:05 Pixelattak moment
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:10:09 Wrong reply]
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:10:32 Idk but thing is periodically save your build especially if you're making a big thing
general 2021-05-25 16:14:16 Thermal power plant moment
general 2021-05-25 16:14:30 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:17:39 Idk why do I miss the first time I encountered a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:17:47 Well, a species of shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:18:29 Explosive shredder bug I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:22:19 There's no point in having so much dmg when you can't hit your opponent
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:22:37 Plus 1 gun can do a ton of damage if you give it some time
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:24:04 Sounds good
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:24:21 And then when a block of someone touches it when you they despawn it just gets teleported to the front of the plot
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:24:40 And maybe anti-spawn camp measures?
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:25:01 Like any build on the front of your plot gets flinged when you spawn
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:25:32 Why fling? Cuz it's fun
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:25:55 Ik
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:26:51 Actually that anti-spawn camp measure is a bit too brutal
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:27:29 Maybe your blocks stay invincible for 30 seconds but if you shoot someone any pvp weapon within that time frame your immunity immediately ends
general 2021-05-25 16:31:58 Imagine not havijng 3 backups of a creation
general 2021-05-25 16:31:59 smh
general 2021-05-25 16:32:37 I mean my spaceship is rather decent at pvp I can't just let that die
general 2021-05-25 16:33:35 Also what do you guys usually talk about in here topics are so random
general 2021-05-25 16:34:17 Doesn't matter
general 2021-05-25 16:34:29 I once ate cereal without milk
general 2021-05-25 16:34:55 Yes
general 2021-05-25 16:35:41 <@!567757737912565760>
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:36:08 5 seconds is too short
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:36:23 You'll still be at spawn base when timer ends
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:36:28 And you'll get spawnkilled
general 2021-05-25 16:38:11 uhgyfiofxzcuytfrdeswad
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:40:19 True
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:40:40 At least I have powerful turrets and sheer speed to back me up
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:42:18 You travel wayyy faster than my spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:42:24 I only clock at 800-1k sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:42:44 Though you can't beat me once I activate warp :))))
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:42:53 
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:42:59 80k sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 16:43:04 340k without turrets

plane-crazy 2021-05-25 17:50:42 Roblox is fixed
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:50:34 Imagine if that existed
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:51:13 Also try using a camera at night mode
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:51:20 preferrably in a plane or flying object
plane-crazy 2021-05-25 18:51:41 Game feels rather different for me for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 03:37:30 Gamer
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 03:38:33 Can I join and see how good your upgraded A10 truly is
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 03:38:45 Especially that increased accuracy thing
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 03:38:58 Amogus
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 03:40:41 gamer
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 03:42:21 Bruh every pvp server I join
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 03:42:31 I find nothing but weak enemies
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 03:42:35 Nothing worth fighting
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 03:43:05 I mean how is fighting a spam car fun? It can't even destroy or run away from you anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 03:43:07 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:35:18 BOI SPELL ALT'S PLANE IS POWERFUL
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:35:33 The aim is more accurate than Ikfin's
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:35:42 And the only plane to ever damage me while I have afterburner on
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:36:15 Pink jet
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:36:45 It's Spell_alt
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:37:01 Also idk how it looks like
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:37:04 It looks like jet
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:37:46 Also not even dodging attacks would work because the aim is deadly
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:38:25 The only confirmed way to get out of the fight is to use a warp engine
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:38:40 Because you are never going to win that fight
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:38:56 Makes you go extremely fat
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:39:00 Mine can go 50k sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 06:39:24 Compared to my afterburner which only has 800-1k sps

plane-crazy 2021-05-26 15:05:46 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 16:38:14 Imagine using tnt
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 16:38:21 To armor your plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 16:39:04 When planes literally depend on speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 16:53:33 dimensional vietnamese tree
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 17:12:54 How much of the creation is copied?
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 17:13:09 Total copying of the creation?
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 17:14:02 Well most of the time they only make like a made in china version of your build
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 17:14:26 But like a total copy of your creation with 80-100% block accuracy
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 17:16:00 Lmao that dude

plane-crazy 2021-05-26 18:49:30 gamer
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 18:49:54 It’s literally a minor issue if your ship is gonna be big
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 18:50:13 Nobody’s gonna notice it
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 18:50:28 Or you can try to make the fold slower and add a folding lock
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 18:51:51 Use more motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-05-26 18:52:02 Amogus

plane-crazy 2021-05-27 05:53:24 Pain
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 05:53:47 Ah they basically turn off when you send a redstone signal at it
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 05:54:18 They’re useful for like sticky piston doors <@723940197456281640>
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 05:54:31 Simplest redstone thing that uses torches
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 05:54:46 I got into minecraft because friends
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 05:55:49 Most complex thing I ever made in minecraft is a reactor core with working temperature system

plane-crazy 2021-05-27 10:53:06 Which should take infinite years from now
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 10:53:24 Why not
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 10:53:51 Well adding a spaceship specialist role is easier than making an entirely new map
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 10:54:12 Aight

plane-crazy 2021-05-27 13:20:03 Totally not a spaceship but with wheels below
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 13:21:12 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 13:35:39 Pro
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 13:37:45 cool
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:04:30 y not
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:04:46 I believe they were visible back then
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:05:15 You can already do that
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:05:32 Maybe advanced keybinding?
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:07:23 How do you activate afterburner in large and huge rockets
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:07:42 Complex keybinds should be a thing
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:07:53 Like you need to press 2 buttons to activate something
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:08:09 Or You can only press one of the 2 buttons to activate something
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:08:21 If 0 or 2 buttons are activated the thing will not work
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:08:37 Sensor blocks too
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:08:58 radar OP
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:09:34 Yes fix close tracking
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:10:01 It can really help in fully automating my docking
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:10:16 If sensor blocks are added too
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:11:05 Once soft coded plane crazy gets added
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:11:26 bias
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:11:38 piston
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:12:11 when automation update
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:12:41 Maybe action sequencing should be a thing?
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:13:09 unpowered motors
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:13:25 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:19:04 Unioning builds when
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:19:14 I guess that could reduce the lag of my spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:19:27 Never
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:20:04 They were a thing since January
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:20:13 But they only became rampant in pvp servers recently]
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:20:47 They started to get rampant mid april
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:20:58 Judging from my old reply
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:21:09 A monster
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:21:28 Though shredder balls aren't a problem for my spaceship anymore
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:21:31 get some speed nub
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:21:32 jk
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:21:47 true
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:22:02 Wdym they're powerful
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:22:25 Shredder instances drop to 0
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:22:31 Lava spitter instances rise
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:22:35 As well as spammers
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:22:52 Also whoever called my spaceship a spam vehicle, it isn't
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:22:56 It has 1.4k blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:23:09 Mostly beams
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:23:14 And internal mechanisms

plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:25:27 Also like the actual Horizon, it's ridiculosuly fast
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:25:32 800 sps for a huge chonker
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:26:06 Pain
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:26:24 Starscape ships have infinite fuel
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:26:54 pro
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:27:49 Also standing in the air block makes the water fogging invisible
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:30:35 Why is the actual starter plane worse compared to the one shown in the picture
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:31:16 Same here
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 15:31:37 Nothing can obliterate my spaceship other than me being an idiot and spell alt's plane

plane-crazy 2021-05-27 16:03:44 Yes spam jet engine pro
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 16:13:59 Because roblox is block
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 16:30:45 Guys who wanna do something called find your own old messages and reply to them as if they were a seperate person
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 16:31:13 Actually sounds dumb
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 16:31:51 some of my old messages are in <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 16:32:44 Very nice
creations-chat 2021-05-27 16:35:17 A ton of downvotes. You might even earn designer tier -5
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 16:35:31 ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 16:36:33 Maybe
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 17:44:12 ANyone here who has decent pvp server? Can't find any
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 17:44:26 Is this what I get for having bad aim
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:00:44 He's waiting for you to leave
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:01:35 He gave up waiting
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:01:37 lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:06:10 It's just a cloud nothing to worry about
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:06:30 *It just cloud*
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:08:07 Finally a chaotic pvp server
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:08:25 All the pvp servers I've been to are just silent for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:08:58 Perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:44:33 *Me casually cruising at 1.2k sps*
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:44:43 50k sps if I dare
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:45:07 Problem fixed
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:45:27 Problem fixed as well
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:46:30 I use hover engines to speed up and turn
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:47:00 Seriously I use hover engines for turning
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:47:15 Idk if that isn't a new concept to you guys
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:47:43 Same here
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:48:06 Also forgot to reply to this, yes I can do that
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:48:13 0 wobble
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:48:21 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:48:32 cya
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:48:32 It's what I call "enhanced WASD"
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:49:03 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:49:18 Hover engines and super rockets
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:49:25 And conveyor engines
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:50:08 Also that
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:50:20 I use a Stalinium reactor too to provide the speed bias
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:53:30 I guess I use pure WASD
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:53:36 BUt my rolling is automated
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:53:47 And A and D is for turning left and right
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:53:58 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:54:08 Yaw and pitch controls are still manual
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:54:29 Pro
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:54:48 basically my plane too
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:54:52 My plane sucks anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:54:57 And it;s not even a plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:55:02 It's just a stick with wings
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:55:51 Most planes are overdetailed rectangles with wings doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:56:29 Some planes do be like that
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:56:36 Anyways my spaceship should be future proof
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:57:17 800 sps travelling, high maneuverability and enhanced WASD
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:58:14 pain
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:58:28 I use CoreSec technology
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:58:52 You play starscape ryt
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:59:02 I already do
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:59:05 50k sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:59:27 Hm yes plaen
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 18:59:53 Also I do not have such problems in a spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:00:04 The only problem I have is my terrible aim
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:00:31 Yes but the fastest
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:00:54 Pro
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:01:23 Especially starscape ships
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:01:32 Low detail, large interior
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:01:35 Why not
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:01:50 Basically a warp drive
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:02:35 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92RnoE2DMfw&ab_channel=PrototrodePrototrode
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:02:50 VAriable speed sucks but I'm forced to use it
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:02:58 I just want togglable rockets and hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:03:46 I mean
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:04:03 I men my maneuverability is fine
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:04:13 I can do full 360º in 2.5 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:04:22 basically the maneuverability of a low end plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:05:09 Is it WASD + mouse control?
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:05:15 Or pure WASD
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:05:34 No wonder why you have precision
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:06:18 Super slow = death
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:06:57 Also what's up with turning circle
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:07:10 Also I'm not an experienced pvper as well
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:08:11 Wanna 1v1 or smth I wanna see how superior your plane is compared to slower gray chonk
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:08:13 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:08:43 Not only die
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:08:48 You're gonna get blocked reported banned
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:10:30 so uhh <@!489806344388345857> wanna 1v1 or smth
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:10:50 You might be the 2nd plane to be able to obliterate my spaceship when afterburner is activated
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:11:00 the other being spell_alt
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:11:26 Looks fine
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:13:16 Shortest they can do it is like 5 minutess
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:13:25 I got designer 3 within 5 minutes of request
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:14:45 That wasn't pvp
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:14:49 Ima join pvp rn
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:15:36 Ok join me
plane-crazy 2021-05-27 19:43:29 Hmm yes lag machine lagging the server even doe no shredders
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 03:31:20 1 tip: Don’t make a medium sized/big spaceship early on
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 03:31:35 I suggest starting with a small one first
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 03:31:37 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 03:31:54 *mobile keyboard moment*
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 05:56:39 Why would I go in that hellhole
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 05:59:52 What if I use spell alt’s plane?
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 06:53:02 Use sheer speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 06:53:49 
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 06:53:53 Spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 06:54:12 Intercontinental ballistic missile
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 07:04:49 50k now btw
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 07:05:06 more wings
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 07:05:10 For more controllability
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 07:05:27 But at least I have higher maneuverability now
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 07:05:59 Anyways I use warp drive to escape combat situations I can't win
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 07:06:17 And back then before I made the Horizon, dodge attacks
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 07:06:58 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 07:07:14 I'm never gonna use tnt armor
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 07:07:19 armor bad
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 07:07:25 Play doh hull good
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 07:07:57 idk it's hard to check since my interior mechanisms is even more cramped than before
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 07:10:24 Possible
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 07:10:34 Nope not too much
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 07:29:44 Laggiest too
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 07:30:13 The magnets for my docking clamp thing for spaceship make my fps go *adios*
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 09:42:59 Don't you hate it when you try to modify your spaceship a ton of times, have to deal with a ton of problems and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 09:43:27 Only to have the end result no more different from when you started upgrading
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 09:43:47 NO maneuverability upgrades, sps, controllability upgrades
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 09:44:00 Every stats remain unchanged
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 09:44:06 Now with more blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 09:47:30 Pro
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 10:45:58 The bots are controlling us
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 12:05:01 Bruh VIP 1 is so empty
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 12:05:19 Only 1 person was in there
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:36:42 Everyone that gets attacked by you rages for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:37:27 Pro English
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:37:47 Bro I spawnkilled people and only a few raged
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:38:37 What's wrong with testing
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:40:42 What about wasd-altf4
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:41:29 Hold on lemme do some experimenting
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:43:30 <@456226577798135808> make your motor speed 6
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:43:37 So that it can do 1 rotation per second
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:44:53 Boi you make planes capable of decimating entire servers and yet you can't figure out a simple motor problem
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:45:04 Well I mean this doesn't really matter sooooo
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:45:41 My spaceship too (for now)
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:47:38 How fast can you do a full 360º turn?
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:48:15 Fastest I can do a 360º is 1.25 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:48:24 With afterburner it's 2 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:52:33 pro
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:53:26 It's a plot long and a plot wide
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:53:41 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:53:53 Less maneuverable plane gets demolished
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:53:56 me
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:53:59 And hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:57:29 When plane so powerful it repairs itself
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 13:59:17 Ima join because yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 17:42:53 Damn you beat me to it
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 17:44:58 No this is an alternate reality where-in an anti-shredder group eradicated all shredders
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 17:45:24 Only a few pop out but when they do they get instantly wiped out
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 17:46:00 Guys wanna make the ultimate anti-shredder?
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 18:16:00 
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 18:16:22 Me when no more shredders in server
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 18:23:05 *Casually warps out to avoid damage*
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 05:44:10 Smart copycats screenshot a build so even if person blacklists they can still copy
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 05:44:21 And then just figure out the mechanisms later
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 05:44:35 But I’m too lazy to attempt to copy
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 05:44:56 Pro
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 05:45:08 Looks fine
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 05:45:11 Stats?
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 05:45:41 No not design stats
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 05:46:19 Function stats (sps, time to do a 360°, durability, skill level required, lag impact, etc.)
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 05:47:08 Oh golly
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 05:47:16 Low lag impact then
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 06:06:21 Wdym you can’t
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 06:06:32 Turrets get extremely inaccurate by then
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 06:06:46 Me
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 06:29:22 Sure
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 06:29:39 I’m also gonna develop some sort of rope anchoring system for pvp
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 10:51:19 Thing is <#497142796961054721> is too cluttered
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 10:51:30 Everybody ignores you there
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 10:51:37 And topic changes too quickly
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 10:51:58 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 10:52:11 <:pain:644301805534183464>
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:52:47 A moderator sent me here
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:52:55 So uhh what we discussing about
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:53:33 pro
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:53:44 What lower energy state
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:53:59 cool
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:54:16 No we're talking about *siense*
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:56:03 Time also caused creation
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:56:19 Time is both creation and destruction
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:57:03 How can we prove such thing?
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:57:20 Then nothing happens
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:57:42 No pain, no joy
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:57:47 Just nothingness
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:58:30 The very reason why I believe in God
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:59:07 pro
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:00:32 Basically what I picked up in this conversation: Everything is nothing and nothing is everything. Both occur at the same time.
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:01:52 Not fun, I certainly don't like getting an existential crisis
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:01:56 But it is interesting
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:03:11 Yes because <#497142796961054721> is too overactive
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:03:20 Say something and you'll get ignored
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:04:07 yes
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:05:18 We need memes
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:06:03 When the person decides it is
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:06:16 True
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:06:47 They never existed before humanity did
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:07:02 Oh huh
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:07:05 Nvm
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:07:20 When the t rex is sus 😳
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:07:53 *Organism: become human*
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:08:00 Idk
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:08:23 Thx
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:09:12 They do have a purpose and you just said it
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:09:17 Reproduce
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:09:28 Yes
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:10:16 We have 1 problem now: Other humans
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:10:39 No not united states
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:11:15 Same
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:11:32 amogus
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:13:56 I don't have anything else to say rn Ima just watch the convo now
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:15:05 Wdym it's not like the laws of physics change like every minute
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:16:15 Also reality doesn't have a physicsal form so it cannot be a solid, or other states of matter
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:16:28 Perhapsn't
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:17:39 Aight discussion has ended I shall go to <#384021699466756107>
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:17:48 nvm
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:18:05 From what we perceive no they don't
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:18:10 But perhaps they do
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:18:38 True
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:20:15 True there are like a ton of sun like stars with earth like planets
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:20:25 Not just in the milky way but also in other galaxies
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:20:29 Like the Andromeda Galaxy
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:21:24 Most of them
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:21:52 But there should at least be 1 sentient species out there
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:21:58 nope
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:22:41 Sure
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:22:45 I'm interested
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:22:51 aight
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:25:49 truen't
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:26:50 Well it's nice to sometimes take a break from plane crazy
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:27:05 I'm rather busy in overpowering my spaceship
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:27:11 To make it the ultimate combat ship
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:27:15 anyways
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:27:53 But what caused the end of almost all species across the galaxy?
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:28:36 Nvm there's too much possibilities on what happened
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:29:08 But I have a feeling that we are the first sentient species in the galaxy
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:29:13 If not, one of the first
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:29:42 There could be like 20 other planets with the same technological level as we do
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:30:19 more or less
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 11:30:31 the universe
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 11:30:35 <#495286269459300364>
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 13:07:54 <@!673380896375570462>

plane-crazy 2021-05-29 13:09:00 In terms of design
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 13:09:25 The people in <#384025409945337856> don't care about how fast your ship goes, how maneuverable it is, it's combat readiness
plane-crazy 2021-05-29 13:09:30 They only care about looks

plane-crazy 2021-05-30 16:04:39 And both of them were in the server when I joined

plane-crazy 2021-05-30 16:08:47 <@!335599526414909451> There's a white name dude in VIP 2, his name is CroSSCT. 
I believe the dude who leaked the link code was zXxprodismoxXz was the one who leaked the server link as both of them were on the server when I joined. The latter dude's rank is Shipwright III.
plane-crazy 2021-05-30 16:09:17 *Proceeds to get all save slots deleted*
plane-crazy 2021-05-30 16:12:11 more evidence that zXxprodismoxXz could possibly leaked the link to CroSSCT: Both of them are friends

plane-crazy 2021-05-30 16:23:11 m4cey1 specifically

plane-crazy 2021-05-31 10:36:48 Bigger waters too
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 10:37:08 My warp drive is useless when there's no need to travel such great distances
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 10:37:20 Well there's only 1 use and that is escape

plane-crazy 2021-05-31 10:37:38 Yes

plane-crazy 2021-05-31 10:38:17 People hate stuff anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 10:42:04 True
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 10:47:43 Try making a spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 10:47:48 I suggest make a small one first
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 10:47:54 Then when you're ready make fat one
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 10:52:25 **Show me all of them**
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 10:52:28 In dms
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:18:22 Helium is the answer. I guess. COuld also be sheer size.
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:18:24 Also use ice
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:18:28 lightest material
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:18:59 Idk I don't have all those complex wing stuff. All I have inside my spaceships are w i n g
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:19:02 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:19:10 bad idea
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:19:38 Just put helium at the 2 ends of the spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:19:50 Oh nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:20:13 Btw my spaceship starts wobbling at 1k too but not a ton for it to be extremely unstable
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:20:37 Wobbles more at like 2k too
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:20:58 5k basically makes my ship roller coaster
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:21:09 Poor choice of words, not a bad idea
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:21:29 You can also do it but I believe just putting helium at the front and back part of your spaceship is better
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:21:51 So you can control your ballasts more or smth
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:22:29 Btw I can now travel beyond 2k sps with stability because I implemented a new system called lightcruise
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:22:39 Basically warp drive but not very powerful
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:23:20 Nope just modified 2 conveyors to have 5 speed instead of 60
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:24:21 Also Idk how it prevents wobble but probably has to do with it being able to turn the whole creation into 1 big engine
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:24:28 Not adding, changing
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:25:02 Not only that but it also removes drag
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:25:40 Doesn't for me doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:25:58 Btw I use prototrode's conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:26:03 The best conveyor engine out there
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:26:22 (Also the only tut part of my spaceship)
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:26:30 probably
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:27:10 Idk it should fit

plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:27:21 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:27:48 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:27:55 Also you in game rn
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:27:57 I'm lonely
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:28:42 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:29:01 Oh nvm again you're back
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:29:08 Pain
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 11:29:21 
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 12:16:26 Male boats when
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 12:17:04 **amogus**
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 12:57:42 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 12:57:48 Make jet
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:01:56 Yeah it's cool you go very high up but have you ever tried going very low down below the void?
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:10:12 using a special technique, no
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:10:25 Same here, but my aim still doodoo
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:10:30 Way more doodoo than your aim
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:11:17 Anyways I havea  new system in my spaceship called lightcruise
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:11:24 Basically warp drive but not very powerful
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:12:01 Best description of shredder bugs and their users
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:14:37 Another thing with lightcruise: it allows controllability during warp and eliminates wobble
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:40:15 All planes are multirole aircraft in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:40:16 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:43:53 He doesn't represent all of Indonesia though
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:43:57 You should be fine
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:44:05 Or she
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:44:20 Idk that person's gender
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:45:40 I'm literally silent yet I'm still dumb
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:45:55 Perhaps I don't have enough neurons
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:46:08 Or Myelin
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:47:11 Also just curious but are you in a country from Southeast Asia?
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:47:28 It plaane
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:48:08 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:48:33 So we don't get bored
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:48:53 My spaceship with 1 missing helium/ballast is die
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:49:18 Why are those planes so durable
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:49:58 And a literal spaceship 10x their size has armor made out of plastic
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:50:10 pro
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:50:38 Who's Guro

plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:53:03 https://www.reddit.com/r/Eyebleach/
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:55:29 Basically it's deadly accurate
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:56:05 I can't aim properly at 600 sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:56:17 Even worse aim at 2k sps (new lightcruise)
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:56:41 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:56:41 the
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:57:02 Fast enough
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 13:59:25 I'll pay the 5 robucksubux
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:02:28 I wonder if you can use water wheels instead of fabric cylinders to make cogs
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:02:37 Sounds possible
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:03:20 Ye I heard it you're making a water wheel
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:03:23 Which is a cool concept
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:03:38 COnsidering most of the stuff I see in servers are just boats, cars, planes, tanks
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:03:48 Rarely other stuff like spaceships, rockets, funky machinery
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:04:44 Ah yes another person who prioritizes function over form
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:04:56 But not so much that you make your creation extremely ugly
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:05:21 Want an A-10?
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:05:24 Or Mig-21
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:05:30 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:05:52 Mig-21
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:06:16 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:06:23 Wait lemme search modern aircrafts

plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:47:42 Oh nice
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:48:26 Perhaps when in doubt, use helium
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:49:35 It's basically just a gravity negation block
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:50:13 But ~~inertia~~ mass is still the same
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:50:17 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:50:33 *Use ice*
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:50:40 ice + helium = pro
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:50:59 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:51:04 Mass then it is
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 14:52:19 Wait what alt you in rn

plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:38:54 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:40:05 I once had 400k ping
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:40:10 Ikfin destroyed the server
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:40:48 Most I've ever did was split 220 mil troops into 64 groups
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:41:19 As the Maphilindo confederation
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:42:03 Water doom
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:43:00 Also why did you coat your plane in Potassium
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:43:55 force
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:44:05 You force it in
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:45:19 For safety measures
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:46:15 Ima casually flex play doh hull spaceship with ultra high speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:46:47 I kinda miss being an easy target for planes
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:47:12 haha 💪🚀
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:48:01 Yes a few upgrades just made my Horizon extremely speedy
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:48:09 High maneuverability, acceleration, speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:48:21 Nope sorry
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:49:08 The fastest but still possible? 700 sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:49:12 My aim trash
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:49:38 But assuming a person with godly aim gets his/her hands on it, it goes up to 2k sps
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:50:07 50k*
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:50:16 good luck
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:50:43 Nah warp speed no longer decreasing
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:50:54 It already reached it's minimum
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:51:04 340k is without turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:51:58 cutter horizon
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:52:05 true, also harder
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:52:22 Use enhanced WASD
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:52:32 Should help the situation a bit
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:52:33 Oh alright
plane-crazy 2021-05-31 16:53:19 Are you gonna make the Ikfin gun

plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:38:45 Or simply because they haven't talked yet

plane-crazy 2021-06-02 04:13:04 Just get a Knife and stab yourself
plane-crazy 2021-06-02 04:13:22 But I suggest you don't do that
plane-crazy 2021-06-02 04:13:50 As it would be a large burden in your family
plane-crazy 2021-06-02 04:14:53 And if you're a Christian like me, you can't commit suicide or you get a free ticket to hell
plane-crazy 2021-06-02 04:15:52 It's not harrasing, bullying, or threathening

plane-crazy 2021-06-04 17:49:06 I mean Ikfin's plane is pretty overpowered
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 17:49:44 It's basically how you feel when you defeat the ender dragon with friends when you're like 8 or smth
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 17:49:45 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 17:50:03 I didn't know your plane was that old
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 17:50:10 I thought it was like 1 month or smth
plane-crazy 2021-06-04 17:50:35 Though I wonder when did the plane suddenly become OP

plane-crazy 2021-06-05 04:22:26 But of course omni bugs deserve to die
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 04:22:28 And shredder balls
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 04:23:13 What if they have blacklist
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 04:23:39 Or perhaps use a trophy system

plane-crazy 2021-06-05 14:03:22 Perhaps that's normal in Indonesian pvp servers

plane-crazy 2021-06-06 17:52:26 Don't mind those suggestions then
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 17:52:32 People here actually care about design
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 17:53:19 Then I guess increase motor 2 servo angle
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 17:54:37 Use mouse controlled drones then
plane-crazy 2021-06-06 17:54:40 Should do thr trick

plane-crazy 2021-06-07 09:02:19 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 09:02:39 When coresec runs out of budget
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 09:03:18 True they're really detailed
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 09:03:31 But I stick to starscape ships because low detail makes them not so laggy
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 09:03:37 compared to other ships with same size
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 09:03:59 **plane dance**
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 09:04:19 Not only that, they also have huge interiors
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 09:04:26 So a ton of mechanisms can be added
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 09:04:40 Which can make starscape ships I guess decent pvp builds
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 09:04:59 My Horizon specifically
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 09:05:07 My other starscape creations have low budget

plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:08:05 Also how do you cobra?
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:08:34 Or rather minimal drag
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:08:45 If you have 0 drag you will just slide across the sky
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:10:15 Go wingless like my old spaceships

plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:17:22 Just use automated rolling
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:17:40 Or use turning rockets
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:57:29 Spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:57:44 Probably
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:57:48 It's ok
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:57:54 You'll get better at spaceship building
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:58:03 But it's better to use motors for hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 13:58:19 You can even use hover thrusters to turn if you dare

plane-crazy 2021-06-07 16:54:24 Solid dihydrogen monoxide with temperatures lower than 273 kelvin
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 16:54:47 Unit of measurement
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 16:54:49 for temperature
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 16:55:03 Basically celsius + 273
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 16:55:32 Imagine not being near the equator
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 16:55:43 Imagine not embracing the heat

general 2021-06-07 17:02:27 Philippines
general 2021-06-07 17:02:51 Perhaps I used a heat surviving tactic way too much
general 2021-06-07 17:03:01 Which is to not move a lot and don't eat too much
general 2021-06-07 17:03:28 Not 24/7
general 2021-06-07 17:03:37 16/7

plane-crazy 2021-06-07 17:16:25 Your glider thing it doesn't even look good

People in <#384025409945337856> care more about looks rather than functions
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 17:16:42 They don't care if your glider can go 600 sps, if it looks ugly they downvote it
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 17:16:56 If it looks nice they upvote it

plane-crazy 2021-06-07 17:31:45 Perhaps I did too much trolling
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 17:32:16 It's dying, but not dead

plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:39:03 First thing to note is to not go in <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:39:11 People will ignore you there and there is higher levels of toxicity there
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:40:08 You get warn or they simply just delete your message
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:40:44 My Horizon is anti shredder if used correctly
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:40:49 But sure
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:41:30 Ah yes another person who’s more about function rather than form
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:41:51 And I still am
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:41:55 Pro
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:43:00 Cuz what’s the point of having good build with wings made out of gold and a window made out of diamond when it can’t even fly and pvp well
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:43:19 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:44:02 Though it’s bad to outright neglect form cuz it’s gonna get boring flying a box with rockets strapped into it
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:44:40 Trol
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:45:10 Stall maneuvers?
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:45:24 Cool, I never tried motor locking btw
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:45:55 I mean I did but like use it in a build
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:46:19 A building trick that makes block go squish
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:47:08 Mostly used to increase detail, but sometimes increase function. Could sometimes be used to put more rockets in 1 place.
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:47:45 But it’s main purpose really is to increase detail
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:48:52 Also I’m not gonna try to motor lock my spaceship anytime soon I need it to have 0 unnecessary lag
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:49:22 Noos

plane-crazy 2021-06-08 15:05:44 Ye kiting seems to be a good strat at annoying shredder ball
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 15:05:49 but not kill it
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:17:57 Focus on figuring out how stuff works doe
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:18:04 Before moving on to designs and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:18:19 Yes, but it's rarely used

plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:20:00 Well this dude doesn't know how to fold yet soooo
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:20:05 Don't use propellers
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:23:42 When motor locks had a different use compared to today
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:25:21 I mean why do all of this when you can just say "I fixed motor locks"
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:26:02 trol
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:26:39 colisions enabled I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:26:57 Ability to turn on/off building collisions
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:27:39 Which means you can have like 2+ blocks in 1 place
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 16:28:02 motor 2 locking when
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:42:08 Start experimenting with blocks and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:42:23 There are like 10k people here, so no you aren't
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:42:39 But yes you are a bad builder like me
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:43:11 Idk, never tried motor locking
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:43:21 I guess just hide it using disconnectors
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:43:36 s u s

plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:07:55 plane with 4 landing gears
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:08:25 But it has 4 wheels so it makes that plane a car
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:08:45 Ah yes lagging with no shredder bug on sight
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:09:32 that is flying
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:09:40 Lag machines are brutal anti shredder builds

plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:17:31 Nvm dude crashed himself
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:31:11 Bro your plane is very durable
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:31:19 I only have like play doh armor
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 18:31:29 Just remove a few blocks and I die
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 04:59:31 That shouldn't be very laggy
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 05:00:00 My lag machine actually lags people so much it makes people leave. It's basically a very brutal anti shredder
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 05:00:22 Or rather a chaos build that stops chaos

plane-crazy 2021-06-09 07:27:05 Shredders don't burn stuff
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 07:27:07 They cut them
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 07:27:28 "incinerates"
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 07:28:12 According to google it means:

To destroy (something, especially waste material) by burning.
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 07:28:42 We're not discussing about literature
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 07:29:13 I'm just correcting you on what incinerate means
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 07:30:08 A fighter warship I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 07:31:03 yes

plane-crazy 2021-06-09 07:32:15 They're pro
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 07:32:23 Also apparently you have a shredder ryt
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 07:32:30 I want to see how good that thing truly is
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 07:33:31 If you can't kill my shredder then that "anti-shredder" is just a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 07:33:35 Yes

general 2021-06-09 09:17:15 Oh cool someone that plays Astrocraft
general 2021-06-09 09:17:25 s u s
general 2021-06-09 09:41:11 Skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:43:53 It just takes time to do those
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:44:12 But I guess planes are really confusing
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:44:28 Actually that's even more confusing
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:44:56 1x1 block
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:46:49 Maybe custom blocks maker?
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:47:04 idk how hard that is to do but it basically allows you to make blocks with custom length
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:47:08 Basically to reduce lag
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:47:24 tremendously reduce lag
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:47:51 Also another suggestion: ability to turn on/off building collision
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:47:59 So that you can have 2+ blocks in 1 place
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:48:06 COuld eliminate the need for serious motor locking
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:48:13 I know but
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:48:22 That produced some more lag
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:48:28 Why not
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:48:56 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:49:02 Another reason is that it's also rather complex
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:49:13 And also takes space
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:49:48 Because I want something that's simpler
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:49:53 To do
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:50:58 You have a point
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:52:20 Perhaps a limit on how much blocks you can put in 1 area
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:52:31 You can only have 5 colliding blocks in 1 area
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:53:19 I mean motor locking has the ability to squish almost an infinite amount of blocks in 1 place
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:53:31 Assuming plot size and block limit is also infinite
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:54:06 motrlok
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:55:38 I mean
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:55:40 if it works
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:55:43 Then it works
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:55:52 No need for 1 million motor locks
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 10:56:54 downvote !!1!!!11!!!!!11

plane-crazy 2021-06-09 18:00:11 Wait what are american pvp servers like I heard they’re pretty toxic

plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:26:42 Flying aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:27:54 Incorrect, almost everyone here has at least built a car once
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:28:15 A more accurate fact is that nobody here other than me builds spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:28:19 Like pvp capable spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:29:20 Pvp capable spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:29:24 Not just spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:29:37 Oh cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:29:40 Where are they now
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:29:44 And why don't you use them anymore
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:29:59 
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:30:37 My first build is a box plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:30:44 Second build is a Katyusha
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:31:06 Third build is I believe the big fat abomination
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:31:22 
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:31:28 Incase you forgot
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:32:34 Ah yes big blocky plane = 737
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:32:41 Well I mean they're just kids
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:32:45 They'll learn soon
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:33:25 Trol
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:34:41 Katyusha but lego
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:34:51 Made back in 2019
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:35:01 Of couse they aren't the same as pc
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:40:29 <@456226577798135808> permission to deploy lag machine
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:40:34 Server is too chaotic
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:42:48 I mean the game is already as bad as a lag machine
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:43:12 Also I'm waiting for Jannu's response not yours. If he says no then I don't
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:44:11 It won't make game worse it makes game better by forcing these kids out of the server
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:44:38 Lag machines make undes leave but makes the others stay
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:44:52 I hate shredders not lag machines e
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:45:11 The undes specifically
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:45:20 They don't have enough patience to wait for a lag machine to go away
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:46:12 Hm fair point
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:46:55 Mine only lags scripts and physics to the point that flight is impossible
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:47:19 So your computer won't die but shredders suffer (and planes for some reason)
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:47:41 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:47:46 Can I see it in action
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:48:15 oh e
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:51:03 Sounds like a fast and efficient way to start a campfire
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 09:52:34

plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:06:15 back when you only needed 30 upvotes to get it
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:06:53 Idk why did they make the requirements higher

plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:28:36 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:29:03 idk e
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 10:29:05 any
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:10:23 Same but files aren't corrupted. However the recording gets extremely laggy after a while
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:10:45 It's like when Ikfin puts his Potassium plane in water
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:12:09 Actually Sodium is a better element to describe Ikfin's plane than Potassium
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:13:15 As it's not a radioactive metal
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:13:19 But still explodes in water
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:13:47 I mean
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:13:50 It doesn't even lag
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:13:51 soooo
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:14:30 Huh strange
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:14:36 For me they look cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:14:56 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:15:03 Let's just not argue about our opinions
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 11:15:37 Pretty stupid to argue about why boats shouldn't be sent to space
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 12:27:58 Looks fine
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 14:54:10 I don't like using throttle since I can't see the throttle value thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 14:54:16 idk if my throttle is like 50% or smth
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 14:54:57 Lemme guess: you just noclip under the grass
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 14:55:33 Warping out 100k sps away from spawn
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 14:56:01 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 14:57:38 Everybody loves autosave until it saves something you don't want to save
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 14:57:46 Therefore replacing a WIP build
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 14:57:54 With some random garbage
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 15:00:08 Huh where
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 22:59:43 At least he’s calmer than like other 12 year olds
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 23:00:19 He’s from <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 23:01:52 Why you gotta be so aggressive
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 23:02:05 He wasn’t doing any harm at all
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 23:02:42 But
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 23:02:58 He wasn’t doing any harm?
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 23:03:05 Bruv
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 23:04:10 What did he do? He just posted a link
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 23:04:21 That’s all, he wasn’t a toxic 10 year old or smth
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 23:04:52 Or starting spamming
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 23:05:02 How is age harmful to others?
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 23:06:23 That isn’t a reason to act so aggressive but ok
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 23:07:32 Perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 23:07:46 Anyways I just woke up soooo

the-dump 2021-06-10 23:47:09 The downvoters just do a little trolling
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 23:48:51 <@562110003675136006> Wouldn’t work, there are shredder species that are effective without cutters such as the omni bug
plane-crazy 2021-06-10 23:49:26 Also some non-shredder builds have cutters
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 00:19:34 He just testing his nitro
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:47:32 They are ships doe
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:47:38 A pvp ship
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:48:00 They aren’t made to look good they are made to kill
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:49:01 Function over form is pro
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:51:13 Eh I guess you can do that only if you have mastered boat building and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:52:44 But are they effective at actually killing other boats?
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 02:52:57 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:38:18 Aight I am back
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:42:10 ~~What if I use my floating turret platform~~
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:42:27 But it works, and it does so extremely effectively
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:43:22 I should probably really make a boat soon
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:43:31 One that can both fly and go in water
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:49:58 Guys should I make the Horizon class destroyer?
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:50:38 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:50:58 Also I’m talking about the irl one, not the starscape one
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:52:15 Also why is the best build I have a spaceship

plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:29:02 When motor
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:32:56 Seems fine enough
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:33:37 If you don’t have ridiculous speeds (600+ sps) then try using wing panels and delta wings to make the circle smoother
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:34:45 Aircraft? 1k sps is normal speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:34:49 800 for spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:35:27 I put a couple for high acceleration
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:35:31 And some hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:35:46 For increasing sps limit
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:35:51 e
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:36:43 Also I have 4 conveyor engines so that I blast off at 50k sps
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:36:54 Speed is pro
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:38:24 Chase fast builds
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:38:29 That’s all
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:38:38 The map isn’t big yet sooo
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:39:52 You clearly haven’t seen SR’s spitfire
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:40:13 Or Ikfin’s A-10
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:40:46 Hover thrusters and custom control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:41:02 Pro
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:42:36 Tbh my spaceship would definitely burn as much fuel as a spam car with super rockets I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:43:10 Also my spaceship is glitchless and has average maneuverability with afterburner (slightly higher when afterburner is off)
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:43:36 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:44:22 In case you wonder yes my turning suffers when I travel faster
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:44:29 As I don’t use wing panels to turn
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:48:44 Ah yes another person that doesn’t use motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:51:25 Imagine being a tryhard
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:51:49 Imagine not playing game casually
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:53:56 Perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:54:36 Pain
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:55:16 But you need to place blocks to motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 07:55:25 Pro

plane-crazy 2021-06-11 08:00:26 Size doesn’t matter
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 08:00:54 You may have the largest and fastest ship but if it looks ugly then people will yeet you to brazil
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 08:03:34 Check his name
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 08:03:40 No wonder why he said that
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 08:03:54 He’s unsatisfied
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 08:06:24 Try using triangle wedges and block wedges?
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 08:06:56 Guys should I make the Horizon class destroyer (not starscape one)
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 08:07:28 Most of those probably should be in the bow
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 08:08:27 More like vehicle designers
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 08:08:42 There’s not a ton of stuff with the engineering part
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 08:09:07 No complex cogs, shapes, or other stuff required to make a vehicle work
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 08:09:30 Just slap on a super rocket engine and fly to brazil
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 08:13:39 Just realized now that tootipoodi is also a spaceship builder

plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:10:42 skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:11:27 Oh huh
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:11:29 strange
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:11:39 Lemme test how powerful the pull is
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:12:15 Also should I put the dragon fighter color scheme in my Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:12:21 I'm getting bored with just gray colors
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:14:29 You weren't lying
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:14:34 How did I not notice that
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:14:53 Perhaps I always keep going extremely fast
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:15:34 Also another thing to note: The range of the pull isn't far at all
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:15:57 So it really isn't that big of an issue
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:16:06 Not gravitational pull
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:16:22 It's wind getting sucked in
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:16:32 Under thr props
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:16:44 That's where you get blown away
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:16:55 Get slightly closer to it
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:16:59 You'll get pulled down
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:53:52 That’s just asking for death
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:54:13 Cuz new upgrades being tested
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:56:41 A cutter force field is just a shredder sphere
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 15:56:44 Bru
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 03:05:20 There are still some, but they're getting reduced
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 03:05:33 Some quitted because they kept getting destroyed, some just got bored
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 03:06:15 But I suppose the shredder era is ending
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 03:06:40 Just get a fast build ez
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 03:06:47 noo b
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 03:07:13 More like infect users
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 03:07:26 Shredder bug infect players (cells) and start to replicate
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 03:08:54 Once the player gets bored of using them (cell death) then it's too late as other people have been infected too and made their own shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 03:09:31 Ok noob
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 03:10:13 More like the collective effort of every people killing shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 03:10:47 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 03:11:29 They're kids
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 03:11:36 They kept getting destroyed by people
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 03:11:47 So they need a creation capable of effectively killing others

plane-crazy 2021-06-12 03:17:27 They're usually so garbage at pvp
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 03:17:31 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 03:18:02 Perhaps it's because they're usually the slow types and not the fast ones

general 2021-06-12 04:19:55 Join VIP server
general 2021-06-12 04:20:00 It will fix the issue
general 2021-06-12 04:20:10 Assuming you want to play plane crazy

plane-crazy 2021-06-12 05:00:06 Some shredder bugs doe are really fast like my unused shredder bug in storage
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 06:52:51 ok
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 07:27:50 s h o w
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 07:28:20 I'm in your game btw
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 08:53:22 Ikfin offline
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 08:53:34 Or is not active in this chat
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:00:41 Hover thruster turning
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:01:08 Should look something like this
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:01:55 Idk I never played that game
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:02:59 Dragon fiter
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:04:13 That actually looks cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:05:05 Bru I wanna build this jet but idk how
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:05:29 How do I make plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:06:52 Guys how do I make plane I need help
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:06:57 Idk how to make smooth nose
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:11:03 Use the Ikfin gun
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:11:50 The firework gun that fires explosive bullets extremely quickly
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:12:37 He just placed 4 fireworks and make them have seperate keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:12:53 then use a macro to make it constantly shooting
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:14:18 Got answer from google:

Macros are sequences of events (such as keystrokes, mouse clicks, and delays) that can be played back to help with repetitive tasks.
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:14:43 And that's how the Ikfin gun works
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:14:49 But you can also do it manually
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:14:52 Just harder
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:15:05 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:15:40 np
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:20:10 You have to install it at the very front of the submarine
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:20:30 It's a bit hard to show with just 1 image sooo
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:20:43 <@!475161931553046538> Ping me again if you wanna see it in person
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:24:53 <@!475161931553046538> I'm in
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:25:00 Come to the big glass build
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:25:43 I'm in your server
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 09:37:22 Finally taught someone how to make my hover thruster turning system
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:38:20 Imagine motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 11:39:09 If you don’t want to then don’t
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:38:41 More like plane made out of sodium crashing into the water
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 12:56:10 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 13:04:52 Guys can I repost the same creation but with different colors?
creations-chat 2021-06-12 13:06:43 Does my spaceship look better with gj solo dragon fighter color scheme?
creations-chat 2021-06-12 13:16:40 real
creations-chat 2021-06-12 13:21:58 Sure I can delete the colors

Nah I ain’t gonna delete a spaceship that took 6 hours of building and 1 month of upgrading. How about you delete every single build in all of your accounts first before I delete mine
creations-chat 2021-06-12 13:24:11 He’s an average <#497142796961054721> fan
creations-chat 2021-06-12 13:28:11 It’s actually a powerful build if you give it to someone with extremely pro aim
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 15:25:58 OMQ vs Ikfin vs Gjsolo
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 15:26:07 It's just gonna be pure chaos
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 15:33:30 <@!707953054489509978> Idc if nose looks bad if your plane works and does so effectively then it's good
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 15:34:13 Try reloading discord
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 15:34:20 Like close and open discord I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 15:34:36 Pain
general 2021-06-12 15:39:15 Wait so if you leave server and rejoin later you keep roles?
general 2021-06-12 15:39:41 e
general 2021-06-12 15:40:03 Welp can't test out if it's true or not cuz I do not have any creations that meet the current requirements for designer III
creations-chat 2021-06-12 16:00:23 The Horizon only has 3 color shades (gray, light gray, white) and I'm tryna replace those colors with different colors
creations-chat 2021-06-12 16:02:47 original color scheme
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 16:21:14 my T-54 is -54% complete rn
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:10:18 Pro
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:42:22 Remodelling a rocket should be possible
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:42:32 As you aren't gonna change any scripts
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:42:36 Just the model
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:43:59 If they're gonna make more realistic rockets they should make the gun more realistic too
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:44:39 But maybe they should keep old rockets doe
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:44:52 Some builds don't aim for realism
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:44:56 Like mine
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:45:12 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:45:15 Should work
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:45:35 true
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:45:55 Madattak
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:46:08 Also I guess he wasn't experienced enough back then
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:46:18 And he needed to make the game easily
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:46:36 He was a beginner developer back then I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:46:43 Plane crazy was made back in 2014
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:47:11 Check date
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:48:01 
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:48:48 oh e
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:48:54 But still
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:49:01 he was a beginner back then
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:49:09 Also roblox wasn't that advanced too
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:49:25 So hardcode was the only option to make plane crazy back then
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 17:49:39 1 here
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 18:28:00 Imagine not using cheese grater wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 18:28:02 smh
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 18:28:03 smh
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 18:33:15 the
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 19:01:27 Use max torque and max speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 19:01:39 DOn't click the lock button too
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 19:01:50 If you don't wanna unfold use a folding lock
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 19:02:11 Just a bunch of pistons "hugging" 1 block
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 19:02:32 If that doesn't work then idk what will work
plane-crazy 2021-06-12 19:02:34 e
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 10:01:03 why exactly
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 10:01:59 Now make the space battleship yamato now
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 10:02:44 true
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 10:07:41 Specifically 100000000 motor locks
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 10:09:02 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 10:09:50 tbh I never used motor locks in any builds
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 10:10:45 It's an SBY inspired build
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 10:11:04 I know a server filled with people who build SBY ships
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 10:11:50 t h e
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 10:15:34 I mean a thousand fighters vs a kingdom is a big technological gap. A bunch of medieval soilders and stuff versus a bunch of flying objects capable of travelling at the speed of sound with rapidly firing guns that can cause massive damage to structures
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 10:59:59 #crane-prazy
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 11:02:11 The
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 11:10:02 At least you didn’t get warn
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 11:10:23 Nah I ain’t going to <#497142796961054721> for extended periods of time
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 11:10:55 Modetor
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 11:11:59 Roles got reversed
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 11:12:17 Well at least we get to talk to the chill people
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 11:12:27 :chillface:
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 11:13:42 I wonder if it’s possible to lag reality
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 11:14:02 By causing too much physics simulations at once
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 11:15:18 Well at least you got a potent legal lag machine
general 2021-06-13 11:16:06 Sure I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 12:33:54 Wow I intentionally damaged the hull and mechanisms of my Horizon and it still flies
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 12:34:03 h o w
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 12:42:34 True, I only just removed a few mechanisms and punched a few holes
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 13:26:32 Go to bot commands and suggest
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 13:26:59 idk try ?suggest
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 15:47:59 I have a 1 fold build if you wanna use it
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 15:54:29 Huh lemme do that now
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 15:54:33 Just to see
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 15:54:47 How fast were you travelling doe
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 15:55:22 I also have 1.5k blocks
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 15:56:02 We can always make alts
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 15:56:10 Also our creations aren't made to lag
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 15:56:23 We know
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 15:57:05 <@!651361636657135617> no effect
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 15:57:10 Travelled at 50k sps
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 15:57:18 resetted and nothing happened
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 15:57:23 No lag difference
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 15:58:46 wtha
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 15:59:00 nope
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 15:59:11 No lag difference compared to resetting without moving
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 15:59:44 Also that doe
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 16:00:51 Why not
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 16:01:03 I see
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 16:01:37 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 16:02:14 *2 people with extremely high ship building standards argue with each other*
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 16:02:45 w*man
plane-crazy 2021-06-13 16:27:48 not for safe work
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 04:29:58 hax
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 04:53:00 
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 04:53:04 
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 04:53:10 After that he rage quitted
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 04:53:35 Actually nvm he's back
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 04:53:38 Time for round 2
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 04:54:54 He isn't focusing on me now
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 04:54:59 Makes it harder
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:01:11 Welp I guess shredder ball finally rage quitted
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:01:28 Btw this is his user profile: https://www.roblox.com/users/1388359954/profile
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:02:30 Cool plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:02:36 Btw wanna join the shredder hunt?
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:02:48 Against 1 player
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:02:59 nvm he fully quit now (logged off roblox)
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:05:03 he fast
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:05:35 Real
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:07:21 They don't as they're hyper focused on shredding other people
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:07:26 Unless they get destroyed
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:07:51 But I suppose they assume my spaceship is an easy target
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:07:56 ...until I start flying
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:08:07 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:09:30 the
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:11:01 sure I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:11:22 I'm also trying to build the plane <@!559568621312147476> built
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:11:28 but am too lazy
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:11:54 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:16:36 <@!651361636657135617> have you considered making this spaceship too?
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:17:13 the andromeda from space battleship yamato
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:18:33 dorito
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:19:19 Guys give me a spaceship build idea cuz I wanna make a detailed spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:20:38 true
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:25:13 You can always make starscape ships
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:25:21 They don't have a ton of detail
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 05:25:35 And have large interiors perfect for a ton of mechanisms
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 06:54:44 omgomgomg downvote
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 07:44:55 Your pfp matches that abomination's face
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 08:07:44 cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 09:49:48 pro
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 09:59:22 Why
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 09:59:32 What do you need help in?
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 12:39:47 Guys how do I make the bow of a boat
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 12:39:50 Send help
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 13:16:52 They're pretty simple
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 13:17:01 Forward attracts objects, backward repels objects
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 13:17:24 superstrength basically makes magnets extremely powerful in pulling stuff
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 13:18:00 The weld option makes a block touching the magnet combine with each other
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 13:18:36 Perhaps your folded creation is too big
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 13:18:46 I suggest just using a folding lock I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 13:19:07 
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 13:19:10 
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 13:19:18 Basically pistons "hugging" a block from the other fold
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 13:19:26 And makes it so that it cannot unfold
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 13:19:41 Unless an extremely fast and heavy object hits it
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 14:13:11 Perhaps a "block build" option
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 14:14:26 COuld replace blacklist I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 14:14:49 Like it makes it so that builds from blocked people cannot interact with your builds
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 14:15:21 You cannot shoot them down, interact with trap doors, or even collide with each other
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 14:15:51 Why not
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 14:16:30 Exactly why you cannot interact with a block person's build too
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 14:16:43 But you can only block 3 at a time
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 14:17:01 usually the most amount of shredders and lag machiners you get in a server
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 14:17:48 Some shredders don't require cutters
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 14:17:51 Such as the omni bug
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 14:18:01 The most powerful shredder species
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 14:19:47 true
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 14:20:22 Perhaps you can only toggle that when you are in build mode
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 14:20:35 So that you cannot toggle it in the middle of a battle
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 14:22:01 Sounds like a good idea btw
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 14:23:34 Btw do you guys think that shredder bugs caused plane crazy tech to advance quickly?
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 14:23:48 Like it forced people to make faster builds, make anti shredder vehicles and techniques

plane-crazy 2021-06-15 02:50:57 Good morning gays and lesbians
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 02:56:12 Wait huh
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 02:56:29 I don’t remember seeing you somewhere else e
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 02:56:56 Oh cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 02:57:21 And yes I made starscape ships here if you didn’t know
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 02:58:47 Ok so first I have the radix, first spaceship I had
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 02:59:22 After that is the Horizon, most combat capable build I had (also very fast)
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 02:59:32 Pro
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 02:59:56 And the Lycentian battleship but made in china cuz I'm missing some wedge parts
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:00:43 That doesn't exist
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:00:52 Also this thing is already laggy enough
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:01:05 So I'm not gonna attempt motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:01:13 nvm was about to send some screenshots
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:02:27 I have 3 pics showing most sides of the conciliator
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:02:34 and other ships
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:02:37 
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:02:39 
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:03:05 Oh w
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:03:49 nope
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:03:52 sorry
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:04:06 Also how's my Lycentian Horizoom
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:06:26 I suggest plot long ship cuz I assume that's how big the ship can get
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:06:50 Also you will get a ton of interior space for mechanisms
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:07:47 large rocket engine
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:08:17 Basically all engines have always on afterburner <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:11:20 Btw this is how the internals on "high end" spaceships look like
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:11:37 Just to give you an idea on how yours should probably look like I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:12:01 the j
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:12:33 e
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:53:08 And at high sps
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 03:53:51 Make the explosive in the very front
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 04:15:10 Thats
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 04:15:12 So much
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 04:15:16 Big builds
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 04:15:23 No backup saves?
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 04:15:55 e
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 04:16:10 I literally have 3 slots dedicated to 1 spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 04:16:25 I cannot let the most powerful combat build I have go away
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 04:29:11 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 04:30:17 Plot twist: all of those 10k block builds are lag machines
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 04:33:15 No wonder why you have so much blocks
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 04:33:31 Also what’s up with land cruisers
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 04:33:38 Why do you want to make them
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 04:34:57 That’s just 40 petabytes
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 04:35:12 I wonder if a petabyte storage system exists
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 04:35:35 Like one you can buy, not the stuff made for super computers

plane-crazy 2021-06-15 13:08:21 Click the undo button
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 13:08:33 Also after that make 3 save slots dedicated to your best plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 13:08:55 np
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 13:09:08 Rule number 1: make 3 save slots dedicated to your best build
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 13:09:37 So that if 1 or 2 save slots get deleted/corrupted then you always have 1 last save slot

plane-crazy 2021-06-15 13:16:08 Also <@!719168864705052802> what's up with your aggressiveness last time you told me to delete a spaceship that took 6 hours to make and 1 month of upgrading
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 13:17:08 Cuz it took time to find some upgrades to slap on
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 13:17:51 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 13:18:54 Also it's not often I find builds that somehow outperform my spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 13:19:17 So I always assume my spaceship has reached it's "maximum potential"
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 13:19:51 In wot specifically
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 13:20:01 sps? maneuverability? pvp capability?
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 13:20:55 "I wasn't being aggressive"
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 13:20:58 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 13:21:02 not aggressive at all
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 13:23:39 I mean everyone could already tell that you have a brain
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 13:24:30 Actually I guess it's motors that do the trick
plane-crazy 2021-06-15 13:27:43 sure

plane-crazy 2021-06-16 07:25:42 But then somehow these kids managed to use them as shredders themselves
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 07:26:45 Though it sacrifices maneuverability for speed and destructive power

plane-crazy 2021-06-16 07:31:11 smh
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 07:31:14 Imagine copiers
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 07:32:44 g
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 07:33:42 I use hover engines, normal rockets, and conveyor engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 07:33:53 all 3 in 1 build
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 07:34:13 Ultimate armor
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 07:37:16 Imagine dying to that creature
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 07:37:46 Point defense turrets
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 07:42:31 Nah just get a build with turrets mounted on it
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 07:42:36 Then beat that creature up
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 07:42:41 from the sky
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 07:45:35 Well
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 07:59:55 Block multiselection when
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 08:20:17 How fast
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 08:20:25 Mine goes 50k max
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 08:37:09 e
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 09:20:59 doom
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 09:51:14 That's like the most suggested thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 09:51:20 Also shredder bug era is beginning to end
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 09:51:31 Less shredder bugs are dominating the game
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 09:52:46 You get the free gift of hate
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 09:53:35 Tbh shredders are actually decent creations, they're highly destructive while being easy to use
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 09:53:41 It's just that these kids that use them
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 09:53:43 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 09:54:00 Shredder pyramid
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 10:08:31 the
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 10:49:09 Not just a point, keep aiming at an object
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 10:49:16 Shredders don't 1 shot 1 kill
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 10:49:49 There's a difference
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 10:49:55 To run is to escape combat
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 10:50:00 TO go faster is to go faster
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 10:50:06 To outmaneuver the shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 10:50:10 And potentially hit it
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 10:50:23 Imagine not supporting the power of being fast
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 10:50:34 It's basically armor but very fun
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 10:51:58 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 10:52:10 Oh cool you got rank
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 10:52:16 Now join the VIP server because pro
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 11:09:26 I guess try turning slower?
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 11:10:18 w
help 2021-06-16 11:43:34 Guys I need motivation to make a spaceship that could hopefully beat my Horizon in pvp capability
help 2021-06-16 11:43:37 Due to more interior space
help 2021-06-16 11:43:42 Which means more room for mechanisms
help 2021-06-16 11:44:32 thx
help 2021-06-16 11:45:07 w
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 14:15:06 He’s abandoning the project
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 14:47:43 Which kind
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 14:55:42 They jealous
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 14:55:54 And I've seen 1 instance of a tank getting more upvotes than a carrier
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 14:55:57 Like h o w
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:33:42 Cool box
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:33:50 But what's up with the "OwO"
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:34:03 w
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:34:37 Spreading peanut butter is better
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:34:41 Actually
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:34:47 ~~Spreading diseases is better~~
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:38:27 Get a snack at 4 am
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:38:51 w
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:40:08 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:53:16 true
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:53:26 But the glitch actually was discovered like 1 year ago
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:54:09 Also imagine plane crazy with no motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:54:27 hellowe
general 2021-06-16 15:55:03 Age just shows how old you are
general 2021-06-16 15:55:06 Not how big you are
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:56:25 We talk about existence
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:56:55 what is this "instability" tech?
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:57:06 huh?
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:57:10 Oh alr

plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:58:43 Somwthing like this?
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 15:58:45 <@!651361636657135617>
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:00:02 I don't really see any purpoe for that thing tbh
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:01:03 That's truely high tech stuff
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:01:18 Well sometimes I do when I need to use sonar cameras
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:01:28 To see what's below the ocean
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:02:00 It's hard to notice but there's a sonar camera in front of my spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:02:13 with togglable sonar mode
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:02:23 Lava spitter bombs are only 1 time use
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:02:27 It's a waste
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:03:04 After that no more
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:03:09 Lava spitter gone
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:03:32 You won't be able to drop them again until you respawn
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:04:05 w
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:04:57 I wonder what tech I should slap on my next spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:04:59 aka conciliator
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:05:22 I'm planning to add mouse control mode for even higher accuracy
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:05:50 As well as wing panel turning so I can turn rapidly at very high speeds
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:06:17 true they keep destroying for a while
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:06:26 Until a hole forms
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:06:53 show me
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:06:57 Wait lemme get on rn
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:07:10 Ima load my blue spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:07:11 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:07:24 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:08:21 Just update the original then?
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:08:24 There's no
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:08:25 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:08:34 calm down
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:08:49 Anyways there is no need for a sequel
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:08:54 Plane crazy isn't a story game
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:09:15 Also if a sequel is made then progress wouldn't transfer
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:10:23 I spent 2 days making a spaceship that didn't outperform my Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:10:34 
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:10:57 You don't get it
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:11:13 It takes time to make a build
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:11:25 If it gets destroyed then we have to remake the thing all over again
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:13:07 We know
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:13:16 We have different playstyles btw
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:13:51 You have a "nomadic" playstyle, just build whatever you wanna build and when you done just move on
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:14:08 w
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:14:49 np
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:18:25 He left cuz he couldn't handle our playstyles
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:19:03 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:19:05 He back
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:21:10 Basically most of my builds
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:21:11 idk why
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:21:45 No tuts?
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:22:26 It's probably just gonna be 80% it's original effectiveness
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:22:43 true
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:22:57 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:23:36 Anyways related to discussion but anyone here who has 3 save slots dedicated for 1 build?
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:23:57 Cannot let a 6 hour build with 1 month of upgrading time go to waste
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:24:37 Eh
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:24:43 not really
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:24:58 If 1 or 2 gets corrupted then at least you have 1 last slot
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:25:24 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:25:47 Just use super rockets + hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:26:04 high power + high speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:26:06 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:26:53 w
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:27:09 Unless you're pushing something that's rather heavy
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:27:17 Hover thrusters work better in lighter objects
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:27:23 Super rockets in heavier objects
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:28:18 That's just for slowing down your build doe
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:28:42 Exactly
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:29:02 seems good
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:29:19 Imagine not maxing out your conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:29:39 Exactly how I want it
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:29:55 I wish rockets and hover thrusters had a toggle option
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:30:18 Unless it's mouse controlled thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:30:22 using motor 2s and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:30:41 w
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:31:10 Ok now I see an issue with mouse controlled thrust
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:31:24 What if you use wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:31:31 To slow down the wobble
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:32:06 cuzHigh activity with a ton of chill
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:32:16 I see
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:32:31 Well I'm planning to have both wasd and mouse control
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:33:36 imagine being nob
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:34:02 Formula?
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:34:32 Oh that's outdated
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:34:52 The new measurement is 1 stud is 0.28 meters
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:35:44 which apparently is 25 centimeters
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:36:21 omg
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:36:45 I just do sps x 1.008
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:37:06 1x0.28/1000x60x60 = 1.008 km/h
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:38:07 5 studs
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:38:27 1 plane crazy block is 2.5 studs
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:38:36 If you stack 2 of them up
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:38:44 they're as tall as boblox man
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:39:04 w
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:39:14 0.28 meters
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:40:11 but they're almost as tall as boblox
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:40:13 mon
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:41:43 Wait hold on. Apparently 1 meter is pretty close to how long an arm would be
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:41:58 1.43 arms length actually
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:43:04 what about roblos woman
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:43:24 w
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:44:17 Oh wait nvm I forgot roblos man is 5 studs tall
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:46:03 **C o m b u s t i v e l   i n f i n i t o**
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:10:33 You can change the opacity
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:10:44 bruvuhuv
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:21:52 you don't
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:22:11 You change the opacity after putting the image in the workspace thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:22:41 Just keep moving the blueprint
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:22:47 around
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:22:53 Until the images align
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:23:21 np
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:23:50 also tbh I actually use affinity photo rather than photoshop cuz
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:23:53 1 time payment
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:24:34 gimp
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:24:49 new map more lag
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:25:18 It's just gonna be a bunch of conv cars
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:25:27 and conv planes
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:25:31 dominating the landscape
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:26:01 w
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:26:12 It's more like a lake tbh
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:26:20 Also maybe a low poly map instead should do
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:27:10 perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:27:33 Actually it is possible
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:28:09 No caves pls
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:28:52 Wait perhaps you can choose what map to join
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:29:28 There's gonna be an urban city map, saharan map, minecraft noise caves, etc.
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:29:50 I just wanna fly my spaceship in a city
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:30:07 🐑
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:30:27 But no caves pls
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:30:31 I get scared easily
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:30:58 w
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:31:23 You don't need scripts to add 1 polygon of land
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:31:40 re-write
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:32:11 If he doesn't then get ready to blueprint your build I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:32:21 Screenshot every single corner
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:32:36 And the interiors just so that you get 99% build accuracy
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:33:15 Rickje doing new game
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:33:33 pain
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:34:15 I don't wanna spend 7 hours making a gray spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:34:27 all over again
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:35:07 Just like current dogfights
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:35:21 A bunch of flying objects 1v1ing each other
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:07:58 cover it
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:08:10 use some blocks to hide it or smth
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:08:18 who posted it
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:08:35 w
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:08:58 idk
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:09:05 I don't have motor locking experience
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:09:22 quick
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:09:22 <@!615944017577771019> Delete the thing you sent in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:09:39 Otherwise mods blacklist you from posting stuff in creations
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:10:14 y
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:10:20 oh well he ded
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:11:27 Oh well he died
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:11:36 Not my problem he doesn't check pings
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:12:15 Adios
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:14:49 Nvm he does check pings
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:15:01 But you got blacklisted
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:15:03 rip
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:17:22 he doesn't need to anymore
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:17:36 Oh wait nvm I thought you were referring to the due that got blacklisted
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:18:13 I mean
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:18:26 There isn't really any point in obtaining other ranks
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:18:41 You only need 1 rank to get benefits
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:18:53 Not like 1234567890 ranks
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:19:59 I should probably make a map design concept too
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:20:09 co
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:20:33 coc (there are now 3 routes, pick 1)
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:21:37 Which means more lag
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:21:51 Maybe a small map and big map option should exist or smth
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:23:42 Maybe tunnels in land should also be a thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:23:50 aec combet
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:24:35 And my warp drive will finally be useful
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:24:42 I can flex my high sps now
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:25:15 That's just
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:25:19 That's just lag hell
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:25:29 bro why do you want a city
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:25:37 With a big map
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:25:41 w
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:25:56 The sheer size of the map
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:26:10 plus a bunch of buildings
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:26:26 with a ton of blocks cuz windows and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:26:27 w
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:26:33 Ah I see
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:26:55 <:pain:644301805534183464>

plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:30:53 maybe you can just make them classic roblox trees
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:31:01 A cylinder and ball on top
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:31:48 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:31:52 they should
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:32:06 But they would be destructible stuff
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:32:25 Just make it destructible
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:32:54 BUT THE CATCH DOE
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:33:01 Where will the event locations be now
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:33:18 Summer event lava lake for example
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:33:54 Oh wait so it's  just adding on to existing map rather than making an entirely new map
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:34:55 Or maybe total weight should be the factor deciding if you can smah down trees
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:35:21 Like if you're very light like me then you need to move extremely fast to smash down trees
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:35:35 Turning on no collide wouldn't lower lag
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:36:20 Btw trees that get knocked down despawn after 3 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:36:40 Is it not WIP

plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:35:58 Coming from a person that never uses motorlocc
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:37:08 cry about it
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:37:33 pain
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:38:06 I know how but I don't see any other reason to use motor lock other than details
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:38:56 Well I mean you can squish more super rockets and missiles and stuff but that's about it
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:39:17 ye
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:39:44 I have mechanisms that can't be motor locked such as warp drives and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 04:40:43 He already did

plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:47:21 Actually I do that when server is too chaotic it's literally unplayable
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:47:36 Shuts the people up and silences them
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:48:11 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:48:27 Perhaps you could use half balls and motor lock them or smth
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 08:50:02 But if that part gets hit by an extremely fast/heavy object then it would get knocked off
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 09:55:34 Function over form is pro

plane-crazy 2021-06-18 08:05:45 Wanna see some speed?
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 08:05:54 Like controllable speed, not because of a fling glitch or smth
plane-crazy 2021-06-18 08:06:41 Yes

plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:07:24 game froze
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:07:30 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:08:43 Lol that kid's probably gonna rage and say "IT'S NOT ME"

plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:09:50 Ima leave to force it to despawn
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:10:19 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:38:33 A little secret but I already decimated a couple servers already for being too chaotic (aka game is unplayable because everyone is fighting each other)
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:41:05 :(
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:41:27 There's a setting
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:41:32 brb lemme find it
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:43:07 Guys has anyone tried using 1 speed in turrets?
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:43:21 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:43:34 Just feels different seeing turrets turn slowly compared to normal
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:43:45 I use max speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:43:57 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:44:00 I use 50
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:44:01 aka max
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:44:09 But seeing it at like 1 speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:46:21 Btw have you tried using 50 speed doe
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:46:42 wasd
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:47:08 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:47:20 But whata bout in your cannons
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:47:25 so that it turns instantly
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:47:29 And hit target
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:47:31 why not
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:47:38 w
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:47:47 True
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:47:56 basically starscape cannon turning speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:48:09 Actually
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:48:22 Starscape tractor beam turret turning speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:54:00 Guys has anyone thought of using half pistons as warp engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:54:32 It seems to be the candidate of replacing conveyor engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:54:38 simply cuz of high sps
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:55:26 cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:55:35 But idk if half pistons are "controllable"
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:55:49 Ropes and motors are like the "uncontrollable" warp engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:56:08 Cuz sometimes they glitch out and give you high sps
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:56:13 Like ridiculously high
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:56:14 sps
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:56:35 Except you cannot control the direction your build goes
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:56:47 Only thing you get is the sudden speed boost in a random direction
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:57:10 While magnets, hover drives, and conveyors are the "controllable" types
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:57:22 Since you can choose where to go
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 13:57:31 rather than getting blasted to the void

plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:20:19 WASD + mouse control mixed together
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:20:22 for higher accuracy
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:20:58 True but planes back before like april or smth rarely use them
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:21:04 It's just now they gained attention
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 15:21:27 As well as hybrid mouse control

plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:13:55 won't
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:20:13 Shredder bugs are the turret
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:21:06 Anyone remember when shredder bugs were like OP and unkillable creatures until it got too popular?
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:21:47 First time I saw a shredder I was amazed at the sheer destructive power
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:22:04 Capable of dismantling builds within seconds
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:22:25 But now they're just garbage creations that even die to an anchored spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:22:47 Moving turret
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:22:56 the

plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:25:49 stalkersanta moment
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:25:57 thx
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:26:33 Guys I need your opinion: did you think shredder bugs helped made plane crazy tech advanced quickly?
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:27:16 Cuz because of they're immense destructive power at the beginning it made players make better builds that can outrun and kill shredders
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:27:31 It was like the black death I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:27:55 It was too deadly and contagious that it ran out of targets
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:29:32 Though the shredder bugs became better overtime
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:29:44 Omni bugs
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:29:50 They're pretty powerful I'd say
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:30:36 true
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:31:07 Well at least for now
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:31:22 Eventually omni bugs may fill up pvp servers
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:31:31 If it gets too popular
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:32:22 Nope, shredder bug 2nd generation
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:32:40 That's the old one, lemme get the video of the improved one
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:33:27 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNboudskMCI&ab_channel=NoobProNoobPro
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:33:35 This abomination
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:33:40 Is deadly
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:34:05 if you're not fast you're gonna end up with a split plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:34:09 or spaceship in my case
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:34:27 They don't need to ram your build
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:34:42 They just circle around and shoot you down
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:35:06 huh
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:35:55 Well I guess unless the person piloting the build is smart
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:37:18 Guys should we make an anti-shredder group or smth
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:37:26 server*
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:37:57 Cuz I'm also dumb

plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:40:14 Oh e
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:41:10 noooooo
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:42:22 good question
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:42:24 I don't know
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:42:41 Perhaps it's because the first toxic chemical discovered was green?
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:42:47 So they like adapted the color
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:42:54 and made green symbolize toxicity
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:43:18 That's true
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:43:37 Half piston bombs
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:44:05 True lag bombs are still the superior nukes in the game

plane-crazy 2021-06-21 15:15:46 Yo imagine if the update is bigger map
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 15:15:51 maybe not
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 15:16:06 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 15:16:24 Oh boi
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 15:16:36 here comes the lava spitter spam in pvp mode
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 15:17:21 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 15:18:09 I mean
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 15:18:15 Of course
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 15:18:22 Want lava spitter location?
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 15:18:30 The most important block
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 15:18:41 Same as fireworks in christmas
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 15:19:01 I'll join
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 15:19:15 Or join me rather I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 15:20:32 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 15:20:35 Just go sleep
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 15:20:41 lava spitter isn't that special
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 15:20:54 Compared to getting a good night's rest
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 15:25:08 Anyone notice how the test lava lake is brighter than the summer event lava lake?
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 15:25:09 
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 16:09:22 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 16:27:07 I'm just using hover thrusters and super rockets
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 16:27:10 At that moment
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 16:27:28 Also how did you manage to take a screenshot
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 16:28:55 lucky guy
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 16:32:03 *Casually force-despawns your build mid-fight*
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 16:35:28 2k blocks each part
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 16:35:32 or lower
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 16:35:40 Wait hold on
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 16:40:23 39 blocks is the limit
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 16:40:36 building space is 51 x 51 x 39 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 16:40:58 Theoretically it is possible to add 101,439 blocks in the building space
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 17:03:21 moterlocc
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 18:01:49 Why so much blocks
general 2021-06-21 18:21:09 I mean expert ranks give you the ability to change name color and have more VIP servers
general 2021-06-21 18:24:01 æ
general 2021-06-21 18:24:37 Social experiment test
general 2021-06-21 18:25:27 Perhaps the question behind <#856298354757074945> is what would happen if you made a chat that seemingly has no purpose at all in a big server
general 2021-06-21 18:35:34 Bru the server I'm in has <#504436696021204992> level toxicity
general 2021-06-21 18:35:52 Absolutely
general 2021-06-21 18:37:38 When an adopt me update is so big it managed to lag games outside roblos
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 18:38:26 fat
general 2021-06-21 18:40:41 I mean
general 2021-06-21 18:40:48 level 3 is rather easy to reach
bot-central 2021-06-21 18:41:26 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 18:42:38 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 18:42:43 Just have patience
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 18:43:01 If you don't then you will regret missing out in a major update
general 2021-06-21 18:46:25 the
general 2021-06-21 18:46:26 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 18:46:44 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 18:46:49 <@!637781561277677582> Btw looks fine
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 18:47:08 The bow I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 18:47:24 Oh nvm
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 18:47:34 Well then I got no other suggestions
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 18:47:42 Use ice I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 18:47:45 It's extremely light
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 18:47:55 And buoyant
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 18:47:59 So you can be s p e d
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 18:48:20 <@!637781561277677582>
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 18:48:57 Hm
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 18:49:05 tried slapping on some hover drives?
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 18:49:10 And maybe super rocket engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 02:45:38 Hello gays and lesbians
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 02:47:24 Cuz the boys are lesbians and the girls are gay
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 02:47:29 You cannot excape lgbt
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 02:48:05 My roblox account has money
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 02:48:09 But I myself don't have any
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 02:48:53 Cuz
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 02:49:06 LGBT community needs more attention than they already have
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 02:49:45 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 02:50:10 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 02:51:13 Nah just modify it
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 02:51:24 Building it all over again would be a waste of time
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 02:52:02 Imagine no 2 factor authentication
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 02:52:41 sussy
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 02:53:07 when the obsidian block is made out of fur
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 02:53:23 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 02:53:58 *F u e l   i n f i n i t o*
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 02:55:06 Oh e
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:02:58 Maybe radar cameras that can locate players and track invisible blocks?
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:03:18 Also the ability to turn on/off building collissions seems to be a better idea
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:03:24 Also maybe multi-select?
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:03:42 Hold shift and select multiple stuff
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:04:14 I'm like writing it in here first so I can see your guys opinions
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:04:26 I don't wanna risk getting downvoted to oblivion
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:04:48 pro
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:05:39 Good luck
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:05:45 changing them all

plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:07:26 trust vector
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:07:41 How many of them are bobux accounts
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:08:09 No which one of them have bobux
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:08:59 How do you have precognition?
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:09:21 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:10:55 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:11:06 Just don't mind it
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:11:38 And a blacklister
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:12:01 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:12:31 I think I've seen that before
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:12:52 I tried to get him to remove the symbol but then everyone thought I was some random unde looking for a fight
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:13:38 Wait Ima go join and keep breaking the blacklist barrier
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:15:05 hm
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:15:11 Perhaps they're the unde
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:16:11 Wait Ima just
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:16:19 Go mount a half piston wall
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:16:22 In front of my spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:16:49 for uh
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:16:52 pro moment
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:17:20 I believe my spaceship generates enough power to do this ryt
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:22:47 Not even planes are safe
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:22:56 But then first test was a failure cuz
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:23:14 I accidentally forgot to change keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:23:17 And now I crashed
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:25:45 Oh nice
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:31:42 bru there's a lag machine
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:34:08 And now game froze cuz someone burned down the piston heads and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:34:26 I guess 1 option is to spawn in water
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:35:33 Bruh the build quality dropped cuz now there are like lava spitter spam cars everywhere
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:36:27 - me whenever I want to make new thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:38:14 serious lag
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:39:21 Nah I'm in a different server with no lava spitter spam cars
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:41:12 Oh wow apparently if I'm able to hit people I can crash them with my half piston wall
bot-central 2021-06-22 03:52:23 !servers
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 03:56:58 At least we got simplified physics so we can make stuff that isn't possible irl
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 04:33:33 But you still get to see them occasionally doe
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 04:34:22 plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 04:34:54 Oh huh
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 04:35:01 lemme just
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 04:35:30 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 04:35:30 nvm you're not in game
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 04:35:31 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 04:36:03 f-105 when
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 04:36:22 I wonder when will a plane named alt-f4 exist
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 04:37:34 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:02:39 He used ancient shiekah technology to fit it in one plot
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:05:59 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:06:17 High speed atmospheric escape
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:09:38 No
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:09:41 Add more rockets
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:10:12 Imagine no thrust vector
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:10:14 smh
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:11:05 Basically it's just manipulating where the thrust is going
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:11:20 Just add motor 2s
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:11:23 servo motor 2s
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:11:36 And mount a super rocket engine
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:11:52 Or if you're like me use a hover thruster
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:12:07 what
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:14:22 Guys what plane should I make hh
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:27:19 push blocks
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:27:59 ye
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:28:06 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:28:13 It pushes other players blocks
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:28:32 Also hover thrusters are better
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:30:20 Bro
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:30:26 It's only 1 developer making the game
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:30:28 Be patient
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:30:32 We will get better stuff next time
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:30:59 Also dude is also making a rewrite
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:31:03 With less lag and new map
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:31:28 DO you not get it
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:31:35 Dude is making a rewrite
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:34:49 True
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:35:00 He needs more p o w e r
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:35:48 some people are just impatient
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:35:54 Very
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:35:56 impatient
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:38:12 pay me 10k robux then
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 05:38:24 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 06:42:46 No give him developer role
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 08:02:49 Another way is to edit your photo in a photo editor and hope that the quality would be good
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 08:03:02 Which is not the case for me
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 08:03:03 hhh
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 08:03:39 oh
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 08:03:42 Wait lemme check rules
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 08:05:24 
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 08:05:32 Nothing here stating that you can't post edited pics
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:48:34 I've taken severe damage from multiple players but I'm still flying and not even a little bit unstable
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:48:36 How is this possible
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:50:03 Nvm you have higher durability
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:52:48 Also I left the game
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:53:00 Because I have seen enough, I'm satisfied
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:53:34 Shredder army, getting bullied by 2 ships with max guns, had to deal with a firework plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:53:47 and let's not include the spam cars yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:54:11 And they all died
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:54:42 True
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:54:57 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:55:47 What about half of the plane missing
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 09:56:22 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 10:02:54 pro
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 13:09:14 a-10
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 14:56:04 hhhhhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 14:56:23 Plane crazy pvp never died
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 14:56:31 It just lowered the server quality
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 14:57:20 Actually tbh shredder bugs can make pvp less boring if there are no good builds in sight
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 14:57:32 Like since shredder bugs can deal more damage than a spam car
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 14:58:02 wrong reply mate
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 14:58:59 If this was your second summer event
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 14:59:01 Nah
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 14:59:06 It's always been like this
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 14:59:22 Like wdym work
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 14:59:25 like keybinds and stuff?
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 14:59:53 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:00:09 Ah so togglable lava spitters?
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:00:15 There's a check mark for that
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:00:27 Anyways it will always be like this
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:00:33 To give others a chance
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:00:38 At getting the pvp weapons
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:01:18 Why would you want to do that
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:01:23 That's how lava spitters work
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:01:29 they're basically flamethrowers
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:01:58 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:02:03 Lava spitters don't have projectiles
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:02:25 Wait lemme join you I don't get it
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:03:12 nvm you're not in game
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:04:01 But really doe that's how lava spitters work. They're a short range highly destructive weapon that burns everything in front of it.
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:04:06 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:04:09 FOr detail
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:06:05 When will we have a long range pvp weapon doe h
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:06:17 furry tank without the fur
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:49:16 wait huh
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:49:22 I thought you just changed camo
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:49:27 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 15:55:52 pro
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 16:12:53 Anyone here who knows how to make half pistons connect and disconnect at command?
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 16:13:27 Cuz I wanna like add a plane that I can launch and instantly recall in a future spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 16:16:30 Ye but
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 16:16:47 Once it disconnects it's hard to make it dock back
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 16:17:28 A half piston kinda fixes this but once it recalls you can't launch it back out
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 16:18:02 It becomes one with the build
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 16:31:13 actually nvm teleport glitch is now fixed
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 16:31:32 Bru if they fix conveyor engines and hover engines next
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 17:03:26 Made in china wall in american territory
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 17:03:41 bizarre
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 17:35:07 hhh I'm doing too much trolling with my cloaking device
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 17:36:43 half pistons
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 17:36:46 and an anchor block
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 17:37:03 based off jason's teleportation device
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 17:37:25 except i disabled the teleportation and removed the disconnectors
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 17:37:52 Though I believe it isn't 100% functional cuz for some reason people somehow shot me
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 17:38:31 This is gonna be like the ultimate shredder trolling device
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 17:38:37 I suppose
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 17:40:08 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 17:51:11 Ok come to like vip 1 or smth
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 17:51:48 Just wait for a while and I'll ping you when I have the thing ready
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 17:54:08 oh e
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:05:25 .
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:05:30 That's a tutorial?
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:05:33 So complex
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:05:40 for a tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:06:05 They're just dumb kids
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:06:07 Be patient

plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:08:14 Guys do you think the cloaking glitch will get patched if it gets too popular?
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:08:23 pro
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:09:06 I shall no longer talk about this from this point onward
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:09:17 nope
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:09:24 A glitch that literally makes you invisible
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:09:35 I can commit on-demand cloaking
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:09:54 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dD9Ncy3wc&ab_channel=JASONJASON
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:09:57 based off this video
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:10:11 Except I modified it
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:10:20 To only cloak
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:10:35 It's so op I don't take any damage
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:10:51 And I can like just stand beside a shredder ball no problem
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:11:04 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:11:36 just added motors so I don't get anchored by the device
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:13:23 
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:13:29 This is how the creature looks like
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:14:12 yep
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:14:53 instructions to follow:
- make sure the piston keybind is set to something you wouldn't press, otherwise you will die
- unanchor the build, only then are you allowed to disconnect
- make sure to go far away, only then are you allowed to disconnect (so spam cars or tryhard jets won't murder the dropped device)
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:16:51 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:17:04 Oh wait lemme add 1 more instruction
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:18:08 Far away actually
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:18:17 This machine works best with fast vehicles tbh
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:18:56 well if you can somehow go far away then teleport back to land
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:19:11 But basically yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:19:17 Land vehicles won't get the full cloaking benefit
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:19:47 Cuz there would be an unguarded weak spot
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:28:55 Idk never tested
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 18:30:08 Wait wanna do some testing
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 19:13:49 the gray plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 19:14:02 I mean
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 19:14:12 Expect a downvote
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 19:14:30 If you're giving it to some random dude
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 19:22:57 Just because someone doesn't make boats doesn't mean they're not allowed to criticize
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 19:23:16 You dislike certain games right?
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 19:23:32 But do you even have the knowledge to program a game?
plane-crazy 2021-06-22 19:23:51 cool

plane-crazy 2021-06-23 16:20:27 what if we remove the upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 16:20:31 And make them negative
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 16:20:49 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 16:42:56 wdym motorlock compresses space
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 16:43:02 folding extends space
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 16:43:51 Cya
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 16:45:18 Also guys I have an anti-shrebber tactic that's not fully tested yet: get something with anchor blocks and turrets, then hover above a lava lake. That way you won't get attacked from the bottom and if a shredder bug managed to hit you, they would burn in lava
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 16:45:41 Anyone mind helping me test this tactic or smth
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 16:46:09 No like just go to public pvp an d make a hovering turret thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 16:46:14 Then just wait for shrebber dug
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 16:46:43 I managed to make a shredder bug rage quit because of that
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 16:46:56 and because of other stuff
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 16:47:36 Like dying to an anchored build, dying because not moving
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 16:48:57 <@456226577798135808> Don't forget to add chokoi03
plane-crazy 2021-06-23 16:49:27 Calm down he's just a kid

plane-crazy 2021-06-24 05:09:15 "Searching for strong insults" the strongest insult is ignoring a person

plane-crazy 2021-06-24 05:37:05 But plane crazy does sometimes act like general in toxicity levels (sometimes even <#504436696021204992> level toxicity)
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 05:37:10 To some extent
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 05:37:40 Ik what you mean
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 05:39:21 This is like hong kong protest 2019 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 05:39:26 Pretty chaotic
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 05:39:44 or actually more like US riots

plane-crazy 2021-06-24 06:53:56 aight
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 06:55:32 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 06:55:32 Wait I don't see any glow in the cannon
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 07:41:09 2nd attempt
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 07:41:22 nvm SR went away
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 07:45:40 wot
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 07:45:55 uh
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 07:46:14 So what about golden tiles
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 07:46:39 yea and?
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 07:46:41 What about it
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 08:48:01 Thx
creations-chat 2021-06-24 09:44:02 Wait what destroyer you making

edit: cool

plane-crazy 2021-06-24 10:44:45 hhhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 12:44:28 huge rocket
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 12:44:44 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 12:44:59 Probably cuz of the "2" in your name
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 12:45:53 Which one is more powerful not which one is faster
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 12:52:20 Super rockets for power and hover thrusters for speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 12:52:27 I use them both
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 12:53:27 ye hover thrusters are pretty laggy
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 12:53:59 Btw why not combine them doe
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 12:55:03 Or how to make a makeshift oven
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 12:55:26 amogus
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 12:56:32 developing countries*
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 12:56:36 But which country doe
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 12:56:48 Here in the Philippines roads are smooth
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 12:56:54 Or maybe that's just in my area
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 12:57:51 2nd picture actually looks good
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 12:58:57 Wait what photo editor you using
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 12:59:08 It shouldn't be that hard
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 12:59:40 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:01:19 ace combat zeo
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:04:00 thx
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:05:59 same
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:06:08 Did so multiple times through glitches
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:06:09 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:06:13 I did get 1 million speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:07:42 Meanwhile this badly photoshopped thing I haven't even finished yet

I still have to get better earth picture, better lens flare, add thust effects and stuff, change the lighting in my spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:20:37 You just get warned
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:20:44 1st offence doe
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:20:55 3rd offence is doomsday
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:21:20 I only got warned for saying words I'm not supoposed to say
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:25:14 motorlock and anglelock hell
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:25:26 oh
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:25:44 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 13:26:35 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:36:04 When you wanna spaceship roleplay but can't cuz interior and exterior of all your ships are boring
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:38:53 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:39:27 10k/10
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 14:39:35 Ultra hd GUI concept
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:13:30 <@!651361636657135617> ikfin knows about the cloak glitch long before we knew about it
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:13:39 I was just searching messages
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:13:40 and h
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:14:26 hmm yes bee plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:15:17 Anyone who wanna shrebber dug hunting with me
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:15:51 looks fine
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:16:04 Btw what's it's speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:18:06 flaingo
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:30:03 Imagine invisible shrebber dug
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:30:23 Like you just anchored cuz you have to deal with another build, could be another shredder
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:30:58 And then suddenly some shredder bug just uncloaked in front of you and now your build is blocked reported banned
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:31:59 That also happened a while ago in <#497142796961054721>
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:33:32 Ok chat what is going on here why we talking about lgbt and stuff

edit: oh, can you dm me what the topic was about I'm interested

reply to <@!718006867808485447>: ok
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:43:41 600 sps*
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:44:04 pain
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:44:11 Wait try using ice
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:44:20 to reduce weight and gain more speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:44:25 And good aim
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:44:39 I thought I was alone
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:44:55 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:45:32 Custom control surfaces give higher maneuverability
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:46:05 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:46:13 adios
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:46:28 **s u s**
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:46:33 **a m o g u s**
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:54:01 cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:54:20 But how do you even make maneuvering at 0 sps useful
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:54:45 Add wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:54:47 ez
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:55:05 Ok maybe I guess f-15 fighter wings?
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 15:55:11 hehe
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 16:14:37 python
plane-crazy 2021-06-24 16:16:40 hacker

plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:00:12 <@511260180583940108>
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:04:10 Not only that, but what if they patch the essential glitches?
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:04:44 Motor lock, glitch drives, cloaking
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:10:06 Creates a hologram of where you last were when you activate it and hides your real build
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:10:58 During cloaking, you cannot attack anyone else but at the same time have invincibility from attacks from other people (though they can still murder you if they find your hologram)
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:11:21 Though you can still die to threats such as lava pools and island propellers
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:14:59 Wait <@!696225961783459871> want a design
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:15:11 For cloaking device
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:15:42 Idk why has nobody made a video on the cloaking device yet
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:16:26 1 meme is fine
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:16:31 2 memes is doom
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:17:11 Ok stay safe in that toxic hellhole
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:19:48 Build a treasure for boat
general 2021-06-25 03:22:03 Hmm yes

Not safe work for
general 2021-06-25 03:24:04 <@!668314196764655618> me and this dude
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:25:02 Oi bush can I copy your bow
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:25:11 I’m having a hard time making one
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:25:49 Thx
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:56:14 Guys is this a good bow?
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:56:27 Like I want an honest opinion
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:56:40 Aight thx
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:56:56 Wdym straight hull
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:57:08 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:57:33 Wait I haven't added the big buldge in front of ships yet hhhh
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:57:58 ye
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:58:06 I'm still testing out the design on the left side
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:58:11 before I copy it to the right
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:58:16 So I waste less time
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 03:58:33 (assuming playing a lego game isn't a waste of time)
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:01:40 bru the bow is extremely demaning in part count
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:01:50 help me
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:06:49 Guys is this a good suggestion:
togglable building collisions. So that the need for motor lock could be reduced.
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:08:25 I thought you're function over form
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:08:53 Btw control panel wings are effective for glitched mouse
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:13:41 how fix
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:13:51 The buldge thing in the ship
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:14:05 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:21:02 Yes I'm gonna start building the other side now
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:22:06 Gonna just be a stupidly fast stupid flying ship in the sky
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:22:11 Just like my spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:22:39 I use prototrode-class conveyor engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:23:08 youtuber
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:23:33 cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:37:54 Ok finished bow
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:38:07 looking fine?
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:38:31 Shrebber jet
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:38:46 I've seen a shredder jet before in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:38:57 But it was only once
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:39:01 and never again
creations-chat 2021-06-25 04:39:22 Is the bow looking good?
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:40:03 No like one that actually abuses shrebber
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:40:50 impossible
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:41:05 Also I'm not gonna use motor lock to reduce lag
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:41:21 I'm gonna keep it detailed but not too detailed
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:41:43 more parts = more lag
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:42:15 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:43:48 Actually I think I can fill the gap in without resorting to motorlock abuse
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:43:53 brb
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:47:11 Ok I filled the gap in
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 08:28:40 Want a cloaking device design
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:05:39 Then it isn't op
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:05:46 if there are design flaws
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:07:04 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:07:11 You'll soon fix it
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:07:25 After rearranging the block placements and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:07:58 maybe try using ice?
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:08:04 It's like the lightest block in game
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:08:24 Also maybe center the center of mass and lift
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:08:28 Very special
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:10:45 then why say it's op
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:10:50 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:10:57 I suggest using hover thrusters for turning
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:11:11 Should look something like this
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 09:11:42 Oh and maybe put wings in the front of the ship
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:17:38 I have made like half of the ship now
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:18:09 Does it still good good enough
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:18:14 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:18:28 Also you finally got a role cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:19:07 deadth
creations-chat 2021-06-25 11:20:27 Halfway done witth the spaceship's main body (yes I'm making a normal ship and making it fly)
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:37:25 No specific wing design
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:37:37 Just make your build have neutral buoyancy
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:37:42 And extremely light
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:38:44 Ok now how’s this build
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:38:53 I’m making new spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:39:46 But then aerodynamics in plane crazy isn’t that complex
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:41:33 Chokoi03
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:42:32 Perhaps it’s because Ikfin got too many shots that hit
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:43:11 No like everytime he spawns you just boom him
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:43:27 With close to no miss
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:43:41 Idk not sure
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:43:48 Try getting better fps?
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:44:13 Betterfps
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:44:58 If you can achieve extremely cold temperatures you can try overclocking it
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:45:08 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:45:43 But I’m no computer expert so don’t ask me on how to do it
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:45:59 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:46:03 Cuz
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:46:11 General gets all the new people
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:46:35 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:46:44 But it suffers from no new people
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:47:10 True
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:47:52 At least we don’t get the toxic kids and a lot of moderators patrolling
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:48:48 Same
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:48:57 I just said how I got past the bot
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:49:03 And said hello chat
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:49:23 Sometimes you can even post memes here and get away with it
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:49:46 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:50:34 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:51:21 Imagine 1 day plane crazy loses it’s reputation of being the most chill chat in server
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:51:31 I prefer in front
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:51:34 More accuracy
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:52:24 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:52:47 You don’t even aim sideways cuz it’s like off-centered
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:53:10 Cuz my ship is high speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:53:20 m
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:53:21 Mam
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:53:56 Still doe the future is not certain
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:54:15 More like *tactical placement*
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:54:33 Also yes I can
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:54:42 My spaceship used to fly without wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:54:46 Like 0 wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:56:25 Drag
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:56:34 So I don’t slide across the sky
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:56:42 And reduced need for anchoring
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:56:56 Which makes my spaceship vulnurable
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:57:37 And a new feature called cloak
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:58:10 Yes my whole spaceship depends on haxes
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:58:26 Without them I get reduced capabilities
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 11:58:56 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:16:03 I have never seen the center of mass and center of lift this close to each other before
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:18:01 Hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:18:17 ye
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:18:41 The Horizon from starscape
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:18:52 Just put the thrust at the back of the plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:19:20 Also a while ago I have wasted 1 hour trying to fix the problems caused by reduced weight upgrade but then
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:19:23 I failed
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:19:45 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:20:11 ye lemme go make starter plane for that
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:24:09 If you can die to tutorial plane then your build is really
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:24:10 trash
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:24:10 really
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:26:11 Idk just place thr thrust in the center
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:26:26 Like how I did with my spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:26:58 Ok lemme stop tryna speedrun the tutorial cuz I keep breaking it
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:27:25 As much as it takes to make it have neutral buoyancy
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:27:33 in air
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:28:06 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:32:42 <@!707953054489509978> This

plane-crazy 2021-06-26 12:38:54 Welp gonna have to redo the entire thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 12:39:43 Oh I'm still making hull first
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 12:39:52 Then I'll add function and small details later

plane-crazy 2021-06-27 03:15:06 good builder indeed
creations-chat 2021-06-27 03:17:40 Guys is this hull ok now?

It is no longer oversized spoon, it is bote
creations-chat 2021-06-27 03:54:32 t h i c c

Btw I'm like making a spaceship with a wide enough but not too wide hull so that I can fit a ton of mechanisms inside in a reasonably wide hull.

So is it too wide?
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 03:58:16 Bru that could've fixed my scatter cannon explosion problems
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 03:58:18 hhhhhhhhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:48:48 My Horizon has more keybinds than this
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:55:13 I used all the letters in my keyboard for all my keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:55:28 To the point that I ran out of space and need to use number keybinds and symbol keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 06:40:59 Cuz many mechanisms
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 06:41:06 Do you want the full list of keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 06:45:37 WASD - obvious

plane-crazy 2021-06-27 06:46:33 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 06:46:35 Why not
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 06:47:23 Main function is for protecting the ship from shrebber dug
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 06:47:50 And killing stuff that get stuck in one of the ships gaps
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:52:45 Wdym they suck
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:52:50 Makes me go z o o m
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:53:02 50k sps easily

plane-crazy 2021-06-27 11:00:41 ACTUALLY
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 11:00:52 to have 60 rpm you need to have a speed of 6.12
general 2021-06-27 11:19:08 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 11:22:37 Or if you made a scatter cannon
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 14:15:06 What did you upgrade

plane-crazy 2021-06-27 16:45:18 Well especially during this time when pvp servers are just empty and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 16:45:54 yes

plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:57:42 Actually we’re already magnetic we have iron inside us but
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:57:52 We don’t have enough iron to be affected that much
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:58:01 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:58:24 Wait lemme just google stuff might be wrong
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:02:08 Actually the heart is the one producing an electromagnetic field h
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:02:13 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:02:50 What kind doe
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:03:05 There are many swords that use iron
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:03:19 Each with varying sizes and lengths
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:05:30 Magnetic cannon yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:06:12 At 4 grams per person, you need to kill 2,352 people to make 1 longsword

plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:11:26 goldenlongsword301
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:12:39 An average human body has 62 kilograms of human body
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:13:25 Well I mean that’s still a short armount of playtime compared to like
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:13:29 30 days
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:14:33 There’s no time limit
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:14:46 If you want to do an advanced build the moment you join
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:14:49 Then do it
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:15:36 Don’t use locked motors
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:16:09 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:16:25 I used a folding lock
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:17:26 Basically a bunch of pistons “hugging” a block from the other fold
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 06:18:33 Just do it
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 06:18:34 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 06:19:01 Uh ok I guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 06:19:18 I also gave acceleration and maneuverability upgrades to spacebote
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 06:19:22 And aight
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 06:19:35 Tekk
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 06:20:02 Shrebber plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 06:46:45 motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 06:46:52 and maybe disconnectors for the barrel thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:04:25 Step 1: get a decent build, decent skill, or both
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:04:57 step 2: use radiation therapy on the cancer cell
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:05:33 <@!488043585443332096>
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:05:37 Wait wrong ping
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:05:46 sorry random dude
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:05:48 <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:06:00 ok this is right person
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:07:08 That is if you have decent skill
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:13:21 My best plane is just a random stick with thrust in the wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:13:58 This thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:14:02 Thrust vectored wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:15:05 The latest version of the Horizon seems rather OP
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:15:17 I just need to give it to a trustworthy person with good aim and skill
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:15:45 660 sps
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:15:50 But then acceleration is instant
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:16:02 And I can choose how fast the plane turns
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:16:15 Yes cuz drag
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:16:31 But they're mainly for acceleration and turning
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:17:10 How fast do you accelerate to 600 doe
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:17:34 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:18:05 tut
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:18:32 Btw this used to be my main pvp build before the Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:21:24 not a fun fact but I made this on accident. I like intended to like make an army but then since the soilders kept tipping over I just connected the soilders with each other and now this thing exists. Also because of it's nature of being a motor 2 controlled vehicle it's pretty durable

plane-crazy 2021-06-29 04:14:04 Did you just upgrade the size?
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 04:14:36 What about speed and maneuverability?
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 04:20:25 I have only made 1 tutorial because I wanted something fast
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 04:20:43 Actually I made 2 as well cuz

plane-crazy 2021-06-29 04:21:33 Ok so just use glass
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 04:21:52 Everything behind glass that is also transparent becomes invisible
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 04:22:02 make it colorless
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 04:22:06 Aka 255, 255, 255

plane-crazy 2021-06-29 06:32:41 Burg
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 06:46:13 Those moments when you wanna lag machine the server but can’t cuz people will hate you for doing that
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 06:46:42 Just commit neutral buoyancy
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 06:47:17 Spaceship*
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 06:48:04 2.5th generation of my spaceship is as maneuverable as a plane and has a cloaking device
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 06:48:28 Which can go 0-1k in 1.5 seconds no conv engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 06:48:48 You aren’t wrong
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 07:29:58 if we leak it to the undes we're gonna start seeing invisible shrebbers
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 07:30:32 Hides your real body and creates a hologram of where you were last time before you activated the cloak
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 07:32:09 There are limitations which should be fair enough to not make rickje patch it:

1. You cannot shoot while cloaked, and if you wanna shoot while cloaked you must anchor yourself. Though that will cause your turrets to be visible and allow others to destroy some parts of your build.
2. Your hologram can still get attacked if found.
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 07:32:24 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 07:33:42 Well at least that 1 dude is carrying the whole team
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 07:58:18 What's wrong with no ranks

plane-crazy 2021-06-29 09:22:34 thonk craze
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 09:23:12 Though I did end up destroying him a ton of times later on cuz I learned to not fly straight at the enemy like a plane

plane-crazy 2021-06-29 10:03:32 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 10:03:57 he had deadly accurate aim on a build that's not even fast

plane-crazy 2021-06-29 10:55:24 And this may sound extremely nooby and stupid but lava spitters will help
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 10:56:07 Wait you guys normally use tnt blocks/balls
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 10:56:30 I don't use them cuz they add weight and when they explode they gon forever

plane-crazy 2021-06-29 12:51:31 Super rockeb spam
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 12:51:37 and low wing count
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 12:52:56 Now overclock your computer to heat it up and thaw
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 12:53:26 Wow ice in 34 ºC
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 12:53:28 hax
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 12:53:43 Idk never did that

plane-crazy 2021-06-29 13:41:07 CUz
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 13:41:10 drag
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 13:41:29 So that less wobble
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 13:41:47 thing is wings add drag to the sides only
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 13:41:53 negates speed from the sides
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 13:42:00 Which is good for control
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 13:44:14 it does cause a little drag in the front but the sides is where most of the drag is
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 13:44:20 **s u s s Y**
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 13:44:37 Golden ninja
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 13:45:38 The flat parts of wing panels is where most of the drag is
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 13:45:48 But like the thin parts
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 13:45:51 Almost no drag
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 13:46:30 Plane crazy aerodynamics

plane-crazy 2021-06-29 14:09:58 yes rockets track everything
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 14:10:06 And form like a defense field
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 14:10:34 Thing is it's only a single use object
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 14:10:39 Once deployed never again
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 14:11:41 It doesn't shield the blocks behind the tnt doe
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 14:12:05 Explosions here are not like explosions in mince raft
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 14:12:26 Just make it ultra sped

plane-crazy 2021-06-29 14:15:21 There are a lot of wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 14:15:44 perhaps it's cuz of computer lag
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 14:15:47 and same
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 16:22:49 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:00:31 I use lava spitters to murder shrebber dug that touch me
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:01:04 amogus
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:01:30 Vehi le that uses wings to go foreward
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:02:23 That's not what I mean
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:03:07 Either way you asked for a dumb idea
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:08:39 I wonder if there are any birds that can shoot projectiles h
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:08:53 You know like biological fighter jets
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:09:59 Perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:10:36 No like solid projectiles created by an organism
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:15:46 Actually nvm jet engines are too hot
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:16:05 EVen if they were to somehow exist they would burn up cuz
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 17:16:18 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 08:19:39 What did you invent in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 08:21:03 Oh alr I thought it has to be like an original invention

plane-crazy 2021-06-30 08:21:44 oh e
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 08:22:10 Thermodynamics in flame crazy when
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 08:22:54 I wonder if my auto roll thing can be counted as an invention

plane-crazy 2021-06-30 08:24:43 ~~**frownyshoes**~~
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 08:26:33 Roblos did not rick
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 08:27:05 Though it is harder to make leg machines now
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 08:27:33 What gun system
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 08:27:37 Can I see
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 08:29:56 It’s so complicated
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 08:30:00 Which makes it nice
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:15:38 Nope it's not broken it's replaced
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:15:45 same
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:16:40 and other fanbases
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:18:12 They're just greedy
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:19:03 ALso they have little care for the fanbase of roblos
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:19:27 I mean yes they have good updates like shadowmap and stuff but
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:20:38 They don't really care much as shown in how they ban people (deleting a 10k bobux account with no refunds for saying yes), how they release updates (rthro)
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:21:23 Something roblox thought everyone would like for more realism
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:21:28 I have never gotten banned
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:21:35 yet
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:22:00 I got warned for saying "free robux is scam"
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:22:22 So roblox supports scammers?
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:22:24 <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:23:03 We're talking about roblos warns
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:24:10 I mean the new player fanbase is bigger than the veteran fanbase soooo
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:25:01 So roblox report system actually works but sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:26:27 Perhaps he's just an anti-simp extremist
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:27:50 Why dishwashers
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:27:59 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:28:44 first thing I see here was a target sight thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:30:29 I had to rush a folded build because it was already 2 days
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:30:35 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:36:46 Ok back had to call grandmother
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:36:52 anyways
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:37:45 Perhaps it's only temporary
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:37:50 As they're just kids
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:39:05 No he stole a portion of a video
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:39:55 I believe 1 day someone's gonna use a copy script to copy my spaceship and h
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:40:40 Idk just copy's a build from another person
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:40:54 Like build sharing except you forcefully make someone share it with you

plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:45:49 Wait get the people from <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:47:01 Hmm actually good idea
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:47:13 But if he/she doesn't then we pour liquid nitrogen over him/her
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:47:27 or lava
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:48:10 There's always a possibility he won't delete the videos
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:49:31 Rank is irrelevant here
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:50:55 <@!837694608094789653> bru
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:51:14 We're talking about <@!795995193211093033> not the copier dude

plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:51:39 if your IP gets banned use a VPN
general 2021-06-30 10:53:47 Then what is the proper way of building?

plane-crazy 2021-06-30 10:58:32 same
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 11:01:55 some dude once said his build was not a shredder it's a cutter machine 5000
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 11:13:00 What's up with European tech

plane-crazy 2021-06-30 14:38:22 Or were you looking for realistic turrets that can shoot at a 360º angles h

plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:02:52 And how exactly is that bad?
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:03:20 What's wrong with getting corrected by a certain race
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:04:11 I see
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:04:27 Like the redundancy of americans fixing "spelling mistakes"
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:05:52 In the UK or to another british person
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:06:09 Americans say that color is the correct word
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:06:36 color

plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:09:17 They are
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:09:20 It's just the spelling
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:10:08 Says the immature one
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:10:38 Maybe add a #war-zone channel where debates can occur?
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:10:47 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:12:08 Maybe environment control can replace gravity slider?
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:15:34 Well at least the toxic peoples have a place to stay
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:15:47 Perhaps it could clean up <#497142796961054721> and make it calmer
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:16:39 Gain social skills
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:16:51 Something I did not fully develop
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 15:17:19 I guess try to come up with topics to discuss about

plane-crazy 2021-06-30 17:51:23 But not external
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 17:51:46 And I don't think my spaceship would be very aerodynamic
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 17:52:36 Or rather option to toggle drag on wing panels only
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 17:52:47 If all blocks will get affected by drag

plane-crazy 2021-07-01 02:56:52 There's a reason this game is called plane crazy

plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:06:46 Hire Ikfin
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:07:18 And share roblox name and password and hope he actually helps and doesn't hack your account
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:08:18 lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:08:25 Anyways uh
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:08:43 I think you should try to like practice aiming
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:08:53 ye just practice aiming and dodging
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:09:18 Tryharding is tiring
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:09:45 Same here cuz I have high speed and maneuverability <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:10:22 Yes but like making a maneuverable enough vehicle to dodge attacks and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:11:13 Even if you know how to dodge if you are flying a toy plane made in china then you can't really dodge at all
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:12:46 More speed
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:12:59 That thing can like get shot down easily
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:13:04 Assuming you do not have pro aim
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:13:22 Your tank will get shot
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:13:36 I can destroy your internals doe
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:13:41 Only your hull will be preserved
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:13:51 but wot
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:14:10 OP tank*
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:14:44 Average cartoon tank
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:15:23 Shredder bugs are pretty weak
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:15:54 Make mac cannon
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:23:50 Ok so there are 3 numbers in RGB code, each having a value range of 0-255.
1st number in code is red color, 2nd code is green, 3rd code is blue
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:24:17 The 3 colors mix with each other to form other colors
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:25:25 A little bit of red and green
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:26:05 brown is like 97, 63, 0
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:54:08 My "army" with some more modifications to make it more pvp capable. Also now able to stay afloat in air for a while.
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:54:49 Yes the whole build is a bru moment
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:55:13 Cuz originally I wanted to make like the spam army thing you sometimes see in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:55:20 But then the troops kept tipping over
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:55:34 So I like connected them together and it somehow was rather powerful
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:55:39 Like even the first generation
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:56:09 Used to be my main pvp vehicle before the Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 04:57:28 yellow

plane-crazy 2021-07-01 10:52:53 Speed is the 2nd best armor in-game
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:05:07 I had a similar concept in mind
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 11:05:22 Like a rope you can tie around your enemy and anchor, causing them to get stuck

plane-crazy 2021-07-01 16:01:57 Too much trolling
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 17:27:27 Uncertain
plane-crazy 2021-07-01 17:28:20 Bombs with 10k stud explosion range when
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 02:52:45 Well sometimes pvp oriented builds may look good enough that they may rack up some upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 02:53:19 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 02:55:39 True they look bad
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 02:55:54 But I believe you can like piston locc
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 02:56:55 And make disconnector “fake wings” and mash it into the cheese grader
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 03:02:46 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 03:03:09 But idk how cuz I never made planes before and never used motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 03:04:45 Anyways I shall go make an automatic gun
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:35:22 I shared it to a few people
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:36:37 e
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:36:45 Some people have different designs of the cloaking tech btw
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:37:41 You can shoot only if you anchor
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:38:03 Though not only it makes your turrets vulnurable, it literally makes your internals vulnurable
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:39:19 Some dude somehow managed to make a cloaking tech that literally leaves no hologram
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:39:48 e
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:40:28 Like on demand teleporting?
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:41:00 Only nerfed by a bad user
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:41:16 With massive skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:41:33 e
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:41:34 Btw
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:41:46 My cloaking may also look like it's teleporting if I cloak nearby
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:42:32 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:42:43 Well at least it isn't a tut user
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:43:20 You got the name?
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:44:07 e
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:44:59 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:50:01 he probably unfriended
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:50:15 Wait hold on can I show you my cloaking tech thing
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:50:30 Perhaps it could perform some of the stuff that shrebber dug did
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 04:50:39 Like random teleportation

plane-crazy 2021-07-02 06:10:52 From what I see he’s only holding W and D down
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 06:12:51 I need this
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 06:13:05 I need to figure out how to do this
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 06:13:25 So that I can wing spam and have no warp speed limit
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 06:14:33 Then lets try to control glitch
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 06:16:00 Patched in public servers
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 06:16:02 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 06:52:43 Stfu white name
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 07:10:48 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 07:18:09 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 07:19:01 Ah yes hydroperoxyl radical
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 07:19:08 
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 08:08:14 Unless you're chasing a hyper-persistent shredder bug that won't even stop after getting killed 100 times
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 08:36:24 Wdym transparent
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 08:36:27 blueprints
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 08:36:42 Uh
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 08:37:05 Oh like a semi transparent image overlayed on a plane crazy screenshot?
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 08:37:26 You should be able to change the transparency in a photo editor
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 08:40:49 it's a feature
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 08:40:58 What photo editor you use
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 08:41:33 e idk
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 08:41:45 just search it up I guess
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 08:46:27 When the build is
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 08:46:35 not sus
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 08:46:42 And there is 1 sus remaining
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 08:54:01 We know
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 08:56:03 He can't he doesn't know how
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 08:56:24 And I told him to search up how to do it
general 2021-07-02 09:02:57 Ah yes that 1 anime with some random flying boat with a huge gun capable of destroying everything the size of austrailia and is capable of exospheric travel
general 2021-07-02 09:04:43 <@!710082948585750549> <@!588487292226764820> some random video I found
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:18:17 Finally a build more fragile than my spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:18:52 Cuz
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:18:56 motorlocc
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:19:06 Same
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:19:29 Probably as trash as mine
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:20:24 but still it would take a considerably long time to explode
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:20:52 ye it's a draw
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:21:28 And now my spaceship is even  more unkillable after upgrading acceleration and turning h
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:21:39 Theoretically yes but no
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:21:54 I still take damage
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:22:10 but now I get almost 0 damage in 10 minutes
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:22:32 Tbh my warp engine was actually that weak
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:22:40 I only could go up to 1.3k sps in warp
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:22:54 But the 2nd generation Horizon has a fix warp
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:23:05 Rn it's generation 2.5
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:23:40 It does work doe ryt
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:24:01 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:24:28 Also maybe try using the turret design on the right?
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:24:36 It's pretty stable
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:24:49 Actually nvm doesn't fit your heli
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:25:21 That would add weight and lag
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:25:31 Or you talking to Hom1?
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:25:32 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:25:50 nvm you talking to me
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:26:32 Seriously doe
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:26:36 I already have 1.4k blocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:26:41 I do not need to add more
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:27:02 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:27:14 hahahahahahah
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:29:34 lot
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:30:55 Go to pvp and don't fight back
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:31:23 or just jump in lava lake, fall into void, or crash into island propeller
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:31:38 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:33:02 Why is it called a camo if it doesn't even camoflauge the ship and make it almost hard to see
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:33:20 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:38:16 Ah alr
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:39:15 When you're patient enough to wait
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:47:35 What was it like
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:47:43 And why did they scrap that idea
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:48:13 I only remember when there was no ocean and rather just a bunch of small lakes in a place
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:50:17 Make your destroyer fly
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:50:34 Like dedicated flight capabilities
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:50:46 With high stability
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:51:05 cuz being in the sky is fun
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:52:07 True it does sound strange
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:53:04 And I'm still procrastinating in my next spaceship cuz
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:53:12 Making the bow is really hard
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 09:53:24 Maybe an automatic gun?

plane-crazy 2021-07-02 10:03:42 oh n-word with 1 g?
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 10:03:48 Cuz it's an easy bypass
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 10:04:21 Not a bypass depending on how you say it
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 10:05:59 I say it as nigh-jer (the country name to those who just name, not the sussy word)
plane-crazy 2021-07-02 10:07:04 hard r?

plane-crazy 2021-07-03 09:17:01 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 09:17:36 I tried using half wedges to reduce weight on my spaceship but I ended up becoming heavier than a neutron star
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 09:18:44 what
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 09:19:03 Maybe cuz half wedges aren't affected by the weight reduction properties of ice
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 09:19:06 wait lemme test that rn
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 09:20:16 Ok half wedges are lighter by a significant amount when it's just normal material

plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:38:14 Actually about that
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:38:39 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:56:38 That’s too easy
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:56:54 Just slap on a conv engine and instantly get custom colors and expert servers

plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:58:21 Possible
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:58:32 I haven’t tryharded that much
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:58:35 Yet
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 16:58:57 400 sps is the max I can go with rocket power alone
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:01:08 Don’t use pistons they easily break down
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:01:09 Use motors
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:01:23 Search up ultra fast conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:01:31 Make the gray part face the motor
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:02:42 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:02:49 That’s the conveyor engine I use
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:03:04 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:04:19 Prototrode’s conveyor produces more speed
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:05:15 Snow blaster
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:05:28 Anyone here who actually uses that?
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:05:48 Why not use both
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:06:08 Throttle sucks in my opinion
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:06:24 Though it doesn’t produce absurd sps like conveyors
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:06:40 yojr
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:06:48 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:07:25 But like you can’t get the exact throttle so it basically is not good for me
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:07:40 Like I would want 50% throttle but it’s actually 42%
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:08:18 Maybe a throttle toggle ability?
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:08:32 Pike in 1 click you can change to 50% then in another max throttle
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:09:39 *laughs in 600 sps floating gun platform* (not the spaceship)
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:10:58 I use km/h
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 17:11:10 And I just do sps x 1.008

plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:11:26 ok so like just put helium and ballasts. Basically that. If you like control your yaw and you like pitch up, move a little of helium to the lower part of the ship instead on the top
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:11:48 Also put wings as well but since you wanna make it fly like drunk man you don't need to
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:12:36 As well as use super rockets and hover thrusters for turning

plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:18:17 I suppose it's just super rockets and hover thrusters mounted on motor 2s
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:18:52 shrebber dall cannot turn
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:18:59 But is omni directional
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:19:11 Gjsolo's flying sub has to turn
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:19:37 n o

plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:26:06 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:26:50 So basically you're the redstone engineer equivalent in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:27:08 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:27:47 
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:28:28 I still wonder why do I suck so much at plane crazy even doe I'm good at mince raft rebstond and commend blokc

plane-crazy 2021-07-06 01:33:04 40 density
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:40:20 It's because this community is full of builder tryhards
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:41:25 Some dude told me to delete my spaceship like bru
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:41:37 I need a very good reason on why I need to do so

plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:46:29 But nobody cares other than the person that said that
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:48:43 I think we should make our own pcc discord and just fix the mistakes and moderation issues in here
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:50:21 True but we need to get a majority of the community to like the idea
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:51:39 I mean if committing a treason will theoretically provide more benefits then why not do it
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:52:33 lol

plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:00:23 Only needed if you need to cram in a ton of supe rockets and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:01:04 chronic pain
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:02:08 I think the reason public servers are getting empty is because of school

plane-crazy 2021-07-06 07:31:04 You still get warn
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 07:31:20 You’re lucky there’s no mod around rn

plane-crazy 2021-07-06 08:07:28 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 08:07:39 Basically me everytime I wake up
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 08:08:48 It’s rare to find people who actually use the conveyors at that one spot
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 09:17:59 This isn't the best place to look for mech builders
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 09:18:18 This place is mostly composed of plane, tank, and boat builders
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:05:24 Idk, just keep searching and hope you find one
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:26:30 same
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:26:37 *Asia momen*
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:26:57 Oh wait entire day nvm
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:27:04 There are a few mods who get online
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:27:26 But at night is where patrolling gets serious
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:28:06 gib sky camo
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:28:20 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:31:36 This looks better
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:32:24 Cuz at least gray doesn't take up 90%+ of the colors you see in the plane
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:32:33 Or 85%
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:34:08 And the fact that you don't need to place more wings to get the colors right which means less part count
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:34:45 THAT'S JUST PLAIN CRAZY
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:34:52 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:34:55 If you're agile
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:35:06 Then that's decent
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:35:34 Tried fighting Ikfin?
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:36:19 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:56:55 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:56:59 The destruction
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:57:10 Would destroy the cutters
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:57:18 Rendering them useless
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:57:42 Tried blacklisting?

plane-crazy 2021-07-06 10:59:56 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 11:00:07 I could do that but I need to go slow
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 11:00:16 Can't use afterburner or I miss miserably

plane-crazy 2021-07-06 11:30:44 for roblos
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 11:32:30 Oh e

plane-crazy 2021-07-07 00:37:37 crash to lava and lag the server
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 00:37:49 Your overdetailed halo ship thing should be able to do that

plane-crazy 2021-07-07 01:26:05 plane crayfish
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 01:57:59 In massive quantities
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 01:59:00 I mean a 1x7 beam is as laggy as a 1x1 block
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 01:59:57 ye
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 02:01:23 Also maybe particles play a role?
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 02:01:54 Ye if you can see the particles
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 02:02:08 if they're out of render distance you don't get obliterated
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 02:02:59 probably
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 02:03:31 Also I haven't seen any fps lag machines yet only physics throttle
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 02:03:51 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 02:12:43 basically the surface is a giant cutter then
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 02:13:28 Which would not only make shredder bugs useless as they would explode on impact
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 02:13:36 It would make everything a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 02:14:16 PErhaps
creations-chat 2021-07-07 02:18:18 That is expected in the toxic hellhole called <#504436696021204992>
creations-chat 2021-07-07 02:21:19 When 40 year old mom learns about discord and buys nitro and stuff

Though I suppose if that ever happens she would either quit discord after 6 months or just talk with close friends
creations-chat 2021-07-07 02:27:23 I mean if they really want to use the app then they can go ahead and learn how to navigate discord's UI

plane-crazy 2021-07-07 10:17:10 Roleplay in pvp mode is nonexistent
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 10:17:27 It's just the typical spam car creature that roams the landscape
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 10:58:41 Big build loading?
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 10:58:48 Heavy lag machine fired up?
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 10:59:29 ah
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 10:59:34 Are you close to router
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 10:59:46 or modem
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 10:59:48 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 10:59:59 then idk then
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 11:01:00 game probably loaded in everything which is probably why

plane-crazy 2021-07-07 11:19:49 Ah yes "peacekeeper squadron"
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 11:20:17 Aka server conqueror squadron
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 11:46:17 Hover engines just
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 11:46:19 make a build hover
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 11:46:21 easy as that
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 11:46:40 Wdym
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 11:46:53 Then it hovers
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 11:47:05 Then you get flung off the map
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 11:47:45 Unless you use complex thrust vectoring stuff with hover engines
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 11:48:00 Just mount it on a motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 11:50:46 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 12:49:24 It's still deadly efficient
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 12:50:05 So looks are irrelevant
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 12:50:10 Oh e
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 13:03:15 Now make working gear box
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 13:03:27 And pisston engun
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 13:03:46 Oh wait
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 13:03:51 gearbox already exists

plane-crazy 2021-07-07 13:05:19 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 13:05:20 do it
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 13:05:25 Make it rain bom
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 13:06:47 maybe make it so that all wheels have equal torque?
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 13:06:57 Idk what causes the problem in the first place
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 13:08:14 You need to get a rank

plane-crazy 2021-07-07 14:31:29 reakl
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 14:32:25 
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 15:16:32 It doesn't understand you, you need to speak to it in python language

plane-crazy 2021-07-07 15:27:11 Good night then
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 15:53:29 Mine only just creates major physics throttle and slow scripts, used to make hyper persistent shredders stop
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 15:53:35 Wow he
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 15:54:06 Yes, by killing a shredder repetitively
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 15:54:11 But sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 15:54:15 A shredder gets too persistent
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 15:54:22 To the point not even killing woukd work
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 15:54:48 It's like using antibiotics to treat a "superbug"
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 15:58:16 Like do they go invisible?
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 15:58:50 Nvm h

plane-crazy 2021-07-07 15:59:22 real stealth is going invisible
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 15:59:32 Temporarily dipping into the 4th dimension

plane-crazy 2021-07-07 16:05:18 They just laugh when people complain about a shredder bug user
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 16:08:43 Keep killing them
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 16:08:58 If they don't stop after 50 deaths use a lag machine and chase them across several servers

plane-crazy 2021-07-08 07:35:44 ez
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 07:36:31 already did
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 07:36:48 1st gen Horizon got 44 upvotes no downvotes
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 07:37:23 there are almost no differences between the first gen and 3rd gen h
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 07:37:51 also it’s gonna get mass downvoted cuz repost
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 07:40:21 Well he didn’t get destruction blacklist role sooo
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 07:40:29 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 07:40:55 Some builds don’t have motorlocks but get upvoted anyways
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 07:41:14 it’s a matter of making a build that looks appealing to the crowd
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 07:41:19 not yourself
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 07:42:18 parachute
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 07:55:19 only known planet*
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 07:57:53 then that’s the only known black hole with life
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 07:58:00 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 09:02:50 So that's how tesla cars work
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 09:03:04 they have glitched hover drives inside them that make them go zoom
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 09:28:51 My attention span was too short to even watch this h

Do you have timestanp on where they reveal the stats (vehicle and wind speed, propeller rpm)
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 09:29:34 Wait what
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 09:29:45 So they’re basically tnt blocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 09:30:12 When civilization ends
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 10:24:15 Basically just make shrebber dug, remove cutters in front and replace it with tnt, make it thinner as well
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 10:46:05 Motor locks are basically a very essential tool for builder tryhards
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 10:46:28 And other functions like squishing super rockets into a single place or uh
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 10:47:57 I use a ton of glitches exept motorlocc
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 10:48:31 and longer
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 10:48:54 What's the disconnectors at the top for
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 10:49:54 try removing them?
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 10:50:00 They don't seem nessecary
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 10:50:09 Just put them back if build kills itself
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 10:53:09 Ah so you can hide motorlocc
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 10:53:11 I see
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 10:54:32 Try doing this form of motorlock? Ikfin said it doesn't have any expos moterlocc
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 10:54:35 <@!728596185958580294>

plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:52:36 in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 15:53:04 if it converts to <— scammer then rick really made an anti scam bot filter

plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:09:22 just check gravity setting in workspace thing, no need to run a script
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 08:09:45 h

plane-crazy 2021-07-10 03:38:18 Super rocket is superior due to being lighter than other blocks and still having high thrust
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 05:29:40 Only cooler and laggier
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 05:30:04 If you put too much moborlock
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 05:30:32 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 05:31:55 Nothing happens, but builds would look worse and builds that depend on a ton of motorlocc would have to be refitted
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 05:32:10 Ah yes “nothing happens”
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 08:52:59 You need skill

plane-crazy 2021-07-11 14:43:52 Actually lemme check general and see if it's clean
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 14:44:41 Cuz general is usually more chaotic than plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 14:44:46 from what I believe
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 14:44:55 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 14:45:47 watch videos
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 14:45:58 observe pro builders and their planes (don't copy)
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 14:46:15 just take inspiration
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 14:47:43 Unless you're an unde and can't understand that
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 14:47:46 Or a troll
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 14:50:31 Expert creations blacklist V when
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 14:50:44 you're not alone
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 14:51:41 DOes it help you get better at leading a target
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 14:51:56 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 14:55:04 I first thought that was your list of friends
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 14:55:12 Going above the 200 limit
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 14:57:52 I believe I once had 2k friend requests
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 14:58:01 Now I only have 700
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 14:58:04 idk what happened
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 14:58:21 or perhaps my biological data storage got corrupted
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:00:41 Mortal
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:01:54 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:13:58 wow you
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:16:11 Probably bug
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:16:32 Or what if
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:18:27 Oh like where you drop a waypoint and you can teleport to it?
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:18:54 It's normal, since you're basically speeding to it at infinite sps and then suddenly stopping
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:19:48 Actually thought of doing that
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:20:16 Like launching a teleporter with like a stick in the front to like stick to an unfortunate build that gets struck
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:20:26 Then just hold the teleport button
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:20:36 And then just murder whatever creature gets stuck to it
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:21:33 Would be rather bulky
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:21:54 And having 2+ locked pistons will greatly increase the chances of you crashing
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:22:01 If you have garbage laptop like me
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:22:44 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:22:45 Ik
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:22:49 Ik what you're thinking
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:23:09 He will use half pistons for drones that can instantly recall
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:24:05 Only the device would go back
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:24:09 The enemy would be set free
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:24:20 But rather teleporting to it
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:24:33 Then if you have turrets just beat it up
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:24:42 If you launch something at ridiculous speeds
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:24:47 It will stick
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:24:56 s u s
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:25:27 The explosive thing inside the bullet would be used up
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:25:29 It would be gone
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:25:33 Unless it's a railgun
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:26:44 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:26:52 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:30:41 You can find those abominations in area 51
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:31:09 Which is highly likely as it's an air force base
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:31:25 Which is extremely classified
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:31:37 You can travel in any supersonic jet I guess
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:33:13 You crash
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:33:15 And explode base
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:33:31 jump off plane before crash
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:35:44 You will never escape photon bombardment
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:37:18 ace combat -1 when
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:40:39 Read this from somewhere I forgot, reduces vortex which means less drag which means more efficiency
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:41:42 plane crazy aerodynamics won't do much
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:41:47 Oh nvm
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:41:56 Thought you were talking about something else
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:42:24 impossible
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:42:33 Just install a cloaking device
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:42:54 wa
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:44:24 I can still see the otherside doe
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:44:32 Still it's an interesting concept
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:48:01 or any part that isn't 100% opaque
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:56:34 
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:56:36 
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:56:38 
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:56:49 6 blocks of transparent plastic needed
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 15:56:53 to make it opaque
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 16:35:40 Did you fire a rocket or gun
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 16:36:08 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 16:51:56 90% of the community including me never knew about it until he showed up
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 16:52:19 Besides, paint blocks are rarely used
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 16:52:33 So it’s the least researched block
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 16:52:43 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 16:56:53 Re-checked definition of invention, you have a point
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 16:57:21 There could be someone who made it before
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 16:57:48 But like
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 16:57:54 Someone who made it
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 16:57:59 Without annoncing it
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 16:58:12 Or used a different term to describe the tech
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 17:06:36 To the guy who invented motorlock:

Your name is unknown, but your deed is immortal
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 17:06:41 Anyways

plane-crazy 2021-07-12 11:41:48 You will never escape tutorial builds
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 11:42:41 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 11:43:47 But most of them stay in non-pvp servers doe

plane-crazy 2021-07-12 11:50:14 infectious smile but it's now across the entire roblos platform
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 11:51:28 Wait how
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 11:51:29 And why
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 11:51:47 oh e
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 12:28:08 Because gamers are extremely offensive, rude, and violent "people"
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 12:37:13 Like with high accuracy?
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 12:37:41 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 12:37:57 Basically they just push and repel blocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 12:39:08 use ice for the barrel
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 12:39:11 Low friction
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 12:39:19 which means bullets just slide by
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 12:39:31 Not only that, you get major weight reduction
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:06:48 it's cuz of weight
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:18:55 Just use ice material and use half beams and half blocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:47:32 Use a ton of alts
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:48:05 Idk, unless you really hate a certain person
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:48:34 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:49:29 Wow og
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:51:03 unless you aiming for designer rank

plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:51:22 Just meet the block requirements and restrictions for each rank
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:51:37 Expert ranks require 20 upvotes minimum across all ranks
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:52:28 I can only get designer rank cuz I can't record footage of builds following all restrictions and block count limits
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:52:36 Cuz if I try to record I get
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:52:39 4 fps
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:52:57 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:55:41 Motorlocking is basically forcing blocks to squish
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:55:45 into such a small space
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:59:04 before and afters of what thing
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:59:14 Also no motorlocks can;t be compacted into 1 space
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:59:28 Basically
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:59:32 Planes before
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:59:37 Were pretty much slow
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:59:57 Also game used to be dominated with planes with control surface
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 14:00:18 Oh like build mode big builds?

plane-crazy 2021-07-13 02:47:40 There is nothing wrong with tutorials, but the moment they start to claim a build they don't own as theirs

plane-crazy 2021-07-13 02:54:51 So he doesn't get creation blacklisted

plane-crazy 2021-07-13 10:51:00 Also why would you want to do that
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 10:51:11 Just use rocket engines only
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 10:51:19 They’re lighter than propellers and jet engines
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 10:51:48 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 10:53:50 True
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 10:55:20 We know

plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:32:25 That's contest info
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:32:28 Not contest chat
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:32:59 Deadth
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:42:14 Interesting
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:42:34 Like 1 person can control your build if you give them permission right
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:44:08 They already have a use, which is to act as a second control seat if your main pilot seat dies
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:45:03 Nobody
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:45:09 I said when your main pilot seat dies
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:45:14 From explosions or gunshots
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:45:28 I see
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:45:34 That's gonna be complicated doe
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:46:31 Like not complicated to add in, complicated to use
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:46:40 As there's gonna be some trouble in coordination
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:50:01 There is  a re-write
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:50:03 going on
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:50:09 Also when did you join plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:50:18 Still WIP
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:50:24 You seem very OG
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:50:50 game
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:51:25 Remember when the ocean was a bunch of lakes instead of 1 big body?
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:51:40 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:52:01 I joined like in 2018 idk when but I started playing a lot in mid 2019
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:52:52 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:53:31 I remember when normal unglitched mouse control planes were really abundant in the sky
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:53:56 As well as when rockets could explode your own build instead of passing by
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:54:21 Nah
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:54:48 Oh like they don't but they still can explode your own build
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:54:58 no
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:55:10 would give bobux men an advantage
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:55:15 Over the poor bacon hairs
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:55:17 elitism
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:56:34 Not really a big advantage in pvp mode, it still depends on how good your build is
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:56:54 If your build slow and unstable then it still sucks
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:57:18 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:57:58 But the only thing it does is make garbage builds fly more easily without the need of helium and some wings
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:58:02 But a space gamepass would like
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:58:17 Give you ultra powerful and compact rocket engines
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 12:59:04 as well as stupidly powerful laser beams that travel instantly and has no bullet drop
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:00:02 Oh and forgot to add shield generators that just
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:00:05 hhhhh
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:00:52 Ye I have a shield generator idea but people said it would be too op
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:00:55 wait lemme find that
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:01:27 <@!625224427369660416> visit this reply
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:01:32 if you want
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:02:06 Closest I've had was like some sort of spinning camera wheel that deflects missiles
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:02:23 idea failed as only a few rockets got deflected
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:02:51 urihgslierg
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:04:23 Cuz THAT'S JUST PLAIN CRAZY
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:05:25 shredder crazy
lag machine crazy
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:06:00 poob crazy
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:06:17 caca crazy
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:06:22 Mentally crazy
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:07:01 Should plane crazy make a new name since the game isn't entirely focused on planes anymore
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:07:39 I'm thinking of voxel builders as a new name
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:08:30 sas
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:08:51 sus
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:09:54 Ye that is the only build that forces me to use a lag machine so that everyone will be forced to stop looking at that thing
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:10:00 and join a different server
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:10:42 Blacklist won't remove the pp
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:11:05 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:12:26 I don't know why do you choose to let a pp build stay on a server instead of getting rid of it but ok
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:13:26 e
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:18:54 but a lag machine would force people out of a server, saving the unde's eyes from an abomination worse than a lag machine
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:19:32 Also just note down the person's name who made the sausage and keep joining until they either rage quit or is forced to use another build
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:20:53 cool
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:22:02 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:23:54 Why is the all white plane different from the 2 other planes in terms of design
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:23:59 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:25:49 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:29:29 the j
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:43:47 check out indonesian grading system I guess
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:48:09 I guess the average score I get is B
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:48:37 Usually dipping into A in like Science while only getting C once in math
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:49:14 How do
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:50:21 No
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:50:54 The true secret ingredient is just good memory
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:51:15 And maybe some ingenuity in math
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:51:46 How do
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:51:50 You haxcker
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:53:02 Wow your parents have ridiculously high standards
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:54:04 Anyways what about that letter
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:54:11 You missed 1 letter
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:54:36 Ea
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:56:14 School system is braindead
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:56:49 show
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 13:59:27 Looks more like vietnamese than indonesian
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:00:20 Wait you guys use your native language in subjects other than English?
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:00:50 That's normal
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:01:11 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:01:26 p a i n
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:02:23 At least canada doesn't have ridiculously high standards
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:02:32 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:05:25 Why is it called a gifted school doe
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:06:38 How do they teach students to think
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:07:05 Like is it really any different from normal school?
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:07:14 But with higher standards and stricter rules?
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:10:50 I'm tryna type a simple question and idk why it's so long
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:11:09 I'm just bad at explaining
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:11:20 nu
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:11:33 Just 1 question about the school system
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:12:22 Oh I'm talking about how they teach students 
cuz normally it's just a teacher just giving a presentation about a topic related to the subject, which is mandatory for the students to learn for some reason
So does a "gifted" school differ in how they teach students?
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:12:29 h

plane-crazy 2021-07-13 15:44:05 Perhaps the moderators are doing that intentionally and it’s not a moderation fault
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 15:44:18 It should be fixed by now but it’s not
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 15:45:03 !ban <@!715148402022678608> Roblox does not permit nsfw content

plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:01:51 Leak the dude's name
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:02:05 In the chat
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:02:16 Check his user name and not just the display name
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:02:32 what
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:02:41 Wait hold on
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:02:58 is it a cross or a pinwheel?

plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:06:10 Bru
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:07:05 ok dude really does have the gjsolo name
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:07:28 Display names don't affect plot names
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:07:35 It will still show your user name
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:07:55 dude thinks display names affect plot names
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:09:45 https://www.roblox.com/users/24196490/profile
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:09:52 Guys join this dude's profile
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:10:11 You were online doe
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:10:15 I can't join people rn
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:10:25 Oh nvm
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:11:16 roblox reports are unreliable
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:11:53 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:13:27 Probably a troll with no social life
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:13:42 Ignore trolls, they feed on attention
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:14:50 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:17:26 sus
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:18:14 Omg
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:18:15 real
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:22:05 Or if you wanna record a video and make like a massive fleet
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:23:15 Thing is copy script would make shredders replicate more easily
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:23:33 Since you don't need to watch a tut, spend 30 minutes copying the design
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:25:07 Gap trapping builds?
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:25:17 Like shredders would try to attack a build but get stuck in a gap
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:25:46 Which would allow for the easy destruction of a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:25:51 what
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:26:37 Or keys which can be activated from multiple keybinds/require only 1 of the keybinds to be pressed
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:27:02 Also rickje needs to add delayed keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:27:10 in re write
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:27:15 why not
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:27:18 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:27:21 delayed keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:27:39 LIke when you press a button it takes 1 second to activate
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:27:55 what
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:28:00 trol
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:28:09 Re-write is when plane crazy becomes soft coded
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:28:20 Which means easier updating
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:28:32 Wait what are the 5 military factions
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:28:42 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:29:52 basically means easier updates
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:29:55 with less work
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:30:25 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:30:29 Just updating the game
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:31:03 I like speed
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:31:06 Speed is nice
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:31:16 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:31:45 Or just give the mods in this game ban/kick perms
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:32:14 why not
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:34:04 basically every rp game
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:34:06 with admin
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:34:44 Oh like realistic aerodynamics?
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:34:48 Plane crazy community
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:35:09 Please no
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:35:13 Or actually
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:35:33 Keep both realistic aerodynamics and lecgacy aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:39:49 There is
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:39:54 The sps thing at bottom left

plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:06:00 Flip I am no longer exempt from this meme
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:06:30 do it
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:06:51 You might make a plane more powerful than ikfins
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:07:44 wait no don't use unpowered piston
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:07:46 More unstable
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:07:49 use motors
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:08:23 Check out prototrode's conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:08:34 wot
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:09:54 how so
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:10:06 They can be used as anti-shredder devices
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:11:35 Lava spitters are useful if shredders get stuck
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:13:00 Missiles and cloaking is better
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:13:14 Just go far away, activate cloak, warp back, uncloak and murder the mosquito
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:13:28 shredder bug without cutters and uses guns and missiles instead
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:13:56 Few of them
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:14:01 Most have 0 cutters
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:14:18 yes, and I'm even planning to make a device that can make me go under the void
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:15:10 Time traveller

plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:17:07 I have won a couple times simply because target had a worse build than me
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:17:27 I haven't won in a proper dog fight
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:17:44 You know, fighting jets with the latest and most refined tech

plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:22:18 You haven't seen my build yet
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:22:20 It has
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:22:38 Literally every single pvp weapon except cutters and water jets
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:23:11 They have massive skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:24:01 Did all of that already
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:24:12 Now show spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:28:44 Your brain is glitching and you're now acting like an unde
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:29:22 1 minute has passed
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:30:56 DM's I guess
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:31:30 Guys ignore the kid

plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:56:45 Exactly
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:57:07 And this is something gjsolo wouldn't do
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 05:59:56 That's common knowledge, you only need at least 80 iq to do it
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 06:02:52 <@!389516889501728779> Also maybe make a video about this on yt? Dude might go to public servers, still impersonate you, and then later on you get "exposed"
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 06:04:05 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 06:05:39 You have a point
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 06:06:19 But if you do bring it up, people would know about the situation, and even if more sussy impostors come in, there attempts would become useless
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 06:06:37 As people know that they are impostors and not the real you
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 06:18:37 Chat doom
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 06:27:38 For more lift I guess
help 2021-07-14 06:34:04 None
help 2021-07-14 06:34:38 There’s no half triangle blockwedge yet
help 2021-07-14 06:34:52 So maybe just motorlock and angle lock like  a tryhard?

plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:17:44 That just got banned
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:46:39 car
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:48:44 Perhaps he didn't know there were more wedges and blocks available than what he knows
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:49:08 WOw
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:49:11 HOf
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:49:17 Exactly
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:49:36 It's cuz of lack of block knowledge
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:49:57 pro
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:50:43 I see
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:52:00 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:52:43 It's a major skill gap difference
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:52:52 w
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:53:03 Guys who wanna make nukes
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:53:05 Like tnt nukes
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:53:08 Not lag bombs
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:53:30 Nukes that you can fly around and destroy everything in a given area
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:54:28 aight
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:54:54 I'm palnning to use like motorlock tower, ropes, and disconnectors
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:54:59 I can't get on rn
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:55:18 Wait what do you think I'm gonna use them for
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:55:43 Cuz I'm gonna use it so that tnt blocks don't go too far away from the center of explosion
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:55:47 Not for rope storms
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:56:08 thx
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:57:00 But it seems like that if rope storm glitch isn't patched, it mat be able to increase the power of the tnt nuke
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 08:59:31 well hopefully I don;t procrastinate about this
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 09:29:56 That's like
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 09:30:00 An everyday sight
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 09:30:06 in public pvp

plane-crazy 2021-07-14 09:31:56 Like tnt nukes
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 09:31:59 Not lag bombs
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 09:32:48 Yes except everything gets destroyed in a radius
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 09:32:56 Not just the stuff below you
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 09:33:26 I'm planning to use motorlocked bombs, ropes, and disconnectors
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 09:33:54 3d explosive net
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 09:35:06 I tried standing still for a while

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:24:18 Seem fine but I don't really have an opinion of your build rn, I'll wait until it's more complete
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:29:14 Thing is everyone here knows that
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:29:39 Also most of them barely know how to chat/chat in english
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:30:28 ALso ramming builds are fun especially if you travel at 10k sps towards them
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:30:35 FLy
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:30:37 Just fly

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:32:17 Suspension isn't nessecary
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:32:29 My "army" can do that (no it's not the spam thing)
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:33:57 
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:34:16 Well actually it's actually is spammy but like
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:34:40 It's also used to be my main pvp vehicle, and up to now it still keeps up with the latest pvp tech
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:35:06 yes it can kill shredders if piloted correctly
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:35:38 hhhhh

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:43:17 Anyways the game is starscape
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:43:37 OH so that's the conciliator
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:43:54 I thought it was like a plane

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:44:39 <@!744357097000665088>
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:44:50 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:45:48 I do use a little helium tbh, since it gives my ship the ability to float mid air
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:45:58 As well as auto roll
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:46:16 Ballasts
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:49:03 Already do
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:49:26 Wait make sure to use prototrode's conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:49:32 It's powerful
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:49:37 for its size
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:50:04 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 01:16:59 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 01:17:08 Btw wanna do some trolling in pvp mode after you finish your build
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 01:18:47 sup
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 01:50:34 Wait can't do that rn
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 01:50:41 I can do that on friday
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 01:50:44 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 02:51:42 pvp or for looks?
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 02:52:21 Cuz it's too vertically wide
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 02:52:30 Like are you making it for pvp or for looks
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 02:52:42 Ah nvm
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 02:52:51 Design is out of the question here then
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 02:53:48 Ye the scale is kinda messed up here
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 02:53:57 But that means you would have more internal mechanism space
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 02:55:53 My Horizon is pretty cramped tbh lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 02:56:14 I don't have space left to put a functional mouse control system
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 04:05:25 Device that makes your build go z o o m
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 04:08:46 Rockets are op if used correctly
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 04:08:55 They can be used infinite times and close tracking
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 04:09:00 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 04:09:12 be pro
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 04:09:43 conveyor drive for warping away, hover drive to increase normal speed cap
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 04:10:21 hhhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 04:17:30 no tank treads
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 04:17:32 They won't fall off
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 04:17:38 And no lag
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 04:22:58 And the fact that they sent the message in russian
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 04:23:08 Like it's not like the whole world speaks russian
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 04:24:37 To the bot maker: You may be smart at hacking accounts and turning them into bots, but you still are dumb in getting people to click the link
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 04:56:43 It's a train already wdym
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:04:35 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:45:36 People here have high standards
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:46:08 Sure it's a cool creation but you're gonna have to please the motor lock overlords
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:46:51 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:47:31 Like someone might make a fail-proof automatic gun but since it's not motorlocked he/she dies
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:47:44 Put anchor blocks in both ends
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:47:51 in front and back fold
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:49:26 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:49:40 Well it's negligible soo
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:49:43 It's fine
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:12:26 shut up dyno
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:39:45 Pain and sorrow
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:40:03 Wait huh
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:40:06 locked folding?
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:40:15 made it smaller
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:40:29 SO it's not really a 1:1 scale build
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:41:05 Btw this is how a big a person is compared to a Conciliator
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:42:33 pro
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:43:52 Btw if you wanna use my slightly outdated turret design (use the right one)
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:43:56 New one is jam proof
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:44:29 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:46:50 cope <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:50:24 Can you go 10k sps without going unstable?
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:51:00 w
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:51:06 s
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:51:16 
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:51:45 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:51:47 Poor man's nitro
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:52:51 what cheap way
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:53:42 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:54:00 It might affect pvp performance doe
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:55:14 He's explaining it to kids
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:55:16 Or noobs
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 06:55:19 Super noobs
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 08:10:48 why not
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 08:11:48 Sounds like a good suggestion idk why should it be downvoted, also would provide some extra design choice
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 08:12:26 There are no engines that produce like a purple or red particles
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 08:12:30 I mean you could use trails but
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 08:12:40 they don't look like rocket particles
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 08:13:25 I agree
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 08:17:08 large super rocket engine when
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 08:18:32 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 08:35:03 Wow you

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 12:26:48 More power
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 12:27:34 At a dire time when the military gets overwhelmed, I don't think that would be nessecary
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 12:27:42 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 12:27:51 But seriously doe, dude should've said he needs backup
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 12:29:17 But all countries have cities
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 12:30:54 Like I said, if the entire European military gets overwhelmed in war, the extra manpower could help
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 12:33:29 Extra manpower.

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 12:57:05 As maneuverable as wasd but mouse controlled
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 12:57:25 People are beginning to switch to hybrid/glitched mouse
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 12:57:32 WASD causes a ton of inaccuracy

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:16:11 you're gonna have a hard time appeasing the council
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:16:30 Just try
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:16:40 if it gets negative votes just delete it
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:16:50 Public servers are filled with undes
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:16:56 Everything to them looks good
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:17:00 As most of them are unskilled
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:17:16 It's rare to find people who actually give honest feedback in public servers
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:17:26 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:17:40 Wait
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:17:41 use ice
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:17:49 very light

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:18:05 I see
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:18:17 Wait I think I experienced the same glitch as well, just didn't fall due to helium
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:18:22 A lot of times
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:18:35 I just think I experienced it
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:19:19 Wait <@!559568621312147476> try flying around for a while
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:19:27 And get drag cancelled 2 times
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:19:52 And try to like note down what orientation you were in before you got drag cancelled
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:20:21 Ok I have experienced that glitch
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:20:33 Even before you did
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:21:16 Usually occurs to me when I get too much damage in a short period of time
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:24:16 superstall
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:24:50 Wait I believe you sent a version of that where you were like spinning around while you fall
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:33:16 Or reduce wings
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:33:32 All blocks distract missiles
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:33:36 I believe
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 13:43:43 Basically when you step on them you get flinged to the abyss

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 14:33:55 You have come late as <#384021699466756107> is slowly becoming more and more toxic
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 14:34:48 You have become thye very thing you swore to destroy
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 14:35:34 Ability to fly on wings and thrust
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 14:36:04 Gap trapping is an effective anti-saber tactic

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 14:38:14 And idk why it not fixing
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 14:39:01 Though hopefully fixed missiles at the front may help solve the issue a bit
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 14:39:46 I don't lag that hard so it's probably myself that's the issue
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 14:41:14 g

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 15:00:10 They do
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 15:00:15 But only a little bit

plane-crazy 2021-07-16 01:43:04 Super rocket engines, hover thrusters (thrust vectored and normal) conveyor drives,
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 01:43:19 Important internal blocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 01:43:36 I do, just a small and basic one
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 01:49:35 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 01:58:07 
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 01:58:24 See the internal wings?
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 01:58:41 (slightly outdated from latest version)
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 02:18:43 Hover drives are not for stability, the wings do that
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 02:18:55 Though the hover drives do make me speed
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 02:20:11 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 02:21:21 I see
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 02:21:26 But I don;t have thos
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 02:21:36 All of the hovers you see in the screen are for sheer speed
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 02:21:51 yes

plane-crazy 2021-07-16 02:28:10 Make working car with gear box, sussy pension, piston engine
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 02:28:27 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 02:28:34 MAke starter plane
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 02:31:04 make huge house
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 02:31:08 huge folded house
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 02:34:38 make half triangle wedge 1x4
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 02:44:03 wot
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 02:44:15 Oh I see
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 02:44:21 Well that's a garbage suggestion
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 02:44:56 I prefer having a custom block creator
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 03:21:14 Did once, made spaceship, quitted cuz I kept getting obliterated by everything and building stuff takes too much time
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 03:22:42 True actually
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 03:22:57 What I meant was like testing time takes too long
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 03:23:00 Cuz like
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 03:23:46 You have to keep changing between editor and universe
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 03:24:05 Editor doesn’t have it’s own testing mode
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 03:26:16 Oh ye forgot to tell that since it's not like voxel based you have to like take more time in accurately placing blocks in the correct positions
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 03:26:44 
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 03:47:38 it's just repainted pilot seats
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 03:47:39 probably
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 03:54:35 Hyper pog
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:00:46 There should be a small map doe
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:00:56 If things like huge battles between 2 teams would be needed and lag should be as minimal as possible
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:01:55 Imagine the lag from that
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:02:03 with multiple unanchored parts
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:02:04 just
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:02:07 causing death
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:02:37 Idk, but I believe physics is calculated everywhere
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:02:42 Some parts aren't just rendered cuz too far away
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:03:51 It only becomes more intense
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:04:10 A powerful enough lag machine could be able to lag you from 10k studs away
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:05:23 That would make some builds incompatible with normal pvp mode
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:05:48 That advantage is too unfair
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:06:27 that's coming in the soft coded plane crazy update
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:06:56 Wasted slot space
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:07:06 Cuz you can't access some of your builds in public pvp
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:07:12 I do but
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:07:25 It's just ridiculously unfair
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:07:57 Only a few people would be able to build massive builds
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:08:25 Like imagine a skilled person without the gamepass and okuyasu with increased plot size
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:10:08 Maybe pvp kills needed?
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:11:51 Ok so this is how it works:

You kill people, you get 10 coins. Every kill you get bigger bounty of 10+ coins (which means you have a bounty of 20 coins.) Everytime you die, bountry gets reset
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:12:15 Same
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:12:26 I want to have sandbox mode rather than uh
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:12:33 idk what game
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:13:55 Ye npc builds would be nice I guess
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:15:13 keep chatting

plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:17:30 Anyways back to the topic
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:17:56 Yes I would like npc bases, there aren't that much environmental danegrs in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:18:07 Just the void, the lava lake, and sky island propellers

plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:30:11 Why did we evolve this way in the first place
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:30:39 At the expense of sheer intelligence, we come with a couple of glitches
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:30:43 And flaws
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:31:09 probably
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:31:34 Cool

plane-crazy 2021-07-17 04:53:15 I mean there's nothing wrong if said script doesn't like make you have aimbot or make you totally invincible in pvp mode
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 04:53:27 or cause severe lagging

plane-crazy 2021-07-17 07:53:21 h o w
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 07:53:39 haxor
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 07:54:06 haxckkeor
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 07:54:15 I go
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 08:24:35 He left like a few minutes after you left
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 08:24:39 So i left
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 10:39:44 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 10:40:14 I'm surprised that furries have their own military
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 10:40:22 It's a fake link
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 10:41:55 I changed my discord username to roblox username, left the discord and rejoined, after joining back, I changed my name back to discord username
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 10:42:28 Anyways my discord username is just the roblos one but it looks like a link
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 10:44:05 that operation failed, from what I heard the Vietnamese people just shot the speakers
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 10:49:17 cope softer
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 10:50:44 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 10:52:06 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 10:54:08 Hey did you know that all humans are furries due to the presence of hair (which is basically just fur but in humans)
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 10:54:36 Even doe you say that you aren't a furry, you will never escape the truth
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 10:55:00 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 12:25:23 Malfunctioning humans
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 12:26:28 Well tbh I find nothing wrong with furries until they do some shady thing like animal mating
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 12:26:47 Or uh
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 12:26:51 other strange stuff
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 12:26:52 anyways
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 12:27:10 I go
the-dump 2021-07-17 12:29:41 __**(Potentially disturbing sounds in this video)**__

^ making this more visible if you didn't see it ^
the-dump 2021-07-17 12:31:55 I have warned you
the-dump 2021-07-17 12:32:56 idk, probably freddy just activating and then slowly torturing a dude to death (judging from the music in the video)
the-dump 2021-07-17 12:35:50 wot
the-dump 2021-07-17 12:36:22 agreed
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 13:17:08 My thoughts are h
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 13:18:24 There is more than 2 blocks doe
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 13:18:37 You can't make an fnf related buld with just 2 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 13:39:36 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 15:12:14 How fast does it go
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 15:12:29 And what engine does it use? Hovers? Super rockets?
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 15:12:37 aight
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 15:12:42 Anyways regarding the colors
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 15:12:51 Kinda looks like a bee swarm bee
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 15:12:58 Except with wedges
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 15:13:08 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 15:13:18 Cool carrier
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 15:16:49 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 15:17:00 2 engines
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 15:17:04 For looks and speed/power
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 15:19:15 b
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:12:40 POV: You're in a server with Jason
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:13:00 and bad pc
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:45:11 Pretty obvious
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:45:14 Sheer lag
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:45:43 Unless you somehow manage to make fast big builds
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:46:23 armor doesn't exist here in flame crazy
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:47:28 In case you get hit, you don't take a ton of damage
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:48:15 Because plane suck
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:48:36 Unless you make it up for speed
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:48:41 Just slap on hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:49:22 I have turret but it very very smol
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:49:36 Though it's pop resistant and wobble proof
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:50:11 We know
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:50:17 Just camp above lava lake
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:50:27 And watch them miserably fail to kill you
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 00:50:43 That also works
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 01:23:06 What about just fixing close tracking
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 01:23:15 And aiming issues at high speed
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 01:23:40 True
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 03:06:27 ok and
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 04:11:00 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 04:13:30 You aren't wrong
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 04:13:56 3d modelling physics simulator
general 2021-07-18 04:40:31 Wdym
general 2021-07-18 04:40:39 It's not as if all of us know how to make our own unique design
general 2021-07-18 04:41:43 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 05:56:28 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 05:56:58 Show afterburner
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:05:31 Oh I see
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:06:48 Ok so
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:07:04 Basically put main pilot seat far from plane
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:07:13 Then put pilot seat in plane
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:07:33 As long as main pilot seat doesn’t touch the plane itself
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:07:36 I suppose
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:07:38 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:07:54 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:08:03 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:17:31 Just improve it
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:17:35 Less effort
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:18:04 Unless the one causing all of the problems in your plane is the design itself
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:18:31 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:20:10 Maybe add thrust vectoring and stuff?
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:20:27 Use conv drive for faster run away
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:20:51 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:21:49 Very pro
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:23:51 When you spawn in a minecraft world/explore the world in minecraft
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:25:51 pigstep_orchestra.mp3
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:41:29 rocket thrusters and hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:41:50 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:42:55 Guys anyone here who have a plane I could copy
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:43:01 Wait not copy bru
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:43:06 I meant like
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:43:13 irl plane I could copy
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:44:12 Hm perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:44:53 So basically a ballpen with wings
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 06:44:54 ok
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 07:04:56 <@!740125656590975017> Sorry I didn't know it would be that laggy
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 07:05:41 Ye I dipped my big ship in lava for "scientific purposes"
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 07:05:51 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 07:07:38 Ok so for hover drives, just put hover thruster in front of the gray part of motor
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 07:07:43 basically that
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 07:08:02 For conveyor drive, search up ultra fast conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 07:08:29 Pisstons will not only piss at your face, but will break down if you anchor at really high speeds
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 07:09:17 Wait lemme join
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 07:09:25 Promise I won't use big ship again
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 07:09:30 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 10:06:11 Kars
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 10:06:27 Just redo the whole thing again
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 10:06:39 If you want to
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 10:19:44 cuz you poob
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 10:27:06 Move your build up by 1 block
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 10:27:10 then delete it
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 10:27:13 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 10:27:25 htps
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 10:27:36 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 10:29:07 Ye that's fine enough, if possible you can try to make it smoother
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 10:31:39 Ah it doesn't, it just makes it resistaant to retracting whenever something strong enough like pushes it back
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 10:32:21 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-07-18 10:32:22 h
general 2021-07-18 10:33:20 <@456226577798135808> Wow you
general 2021-07-18 10:33:46 h
general 2021-07-18 10:36:10 Nobody knows yet
general 2021-07-18 10:36:28 Though it's probably gonna be great
general 2021-07-18 10:36:40 Check <#529858892075761694>
general 2021-07-18 10:37:38 But I also hope it won't be laggy
general 2021-07-18 10:37:54 I cannot imagine casually clapping ground units with 50% throttle
general 2021-07-18 10:38:03 I mean I can imagine I have a brain but
general 2021-07-18 10:38:10 ye
general 2021-07-18 10:39:42 Lycentian Federal Battleship
general 2021-07-18 10:39:58 Thx g
general 2021-07-18 10:40:16 It was unintentionally ridiculously tanky and speedy too
general 2021-07-18 10:40:41 Why you copy tuts
general 2021-07-18 10:40:56 Ah so modified tut
general 2021-07-18 10:41:08 Well at least you were honest about that
general 2021-07-18 10:42:00 True but the people who copy tuts all the time have a different story
general 2021-07-18 10:43:06 general seems friendly today compared to the usual toxicity
general 2021-07-18 10:43:19 what even happened lol
general 2021-07-18 10:43:23 Oh e
general 2021-07-18 10:44:52 bruv momen
general 2021-07-18 10:46:01 Welp fun time over
general 2021-07-18 10:46:03 me
general 2021-07-18 10:46:12 He removed the fake link in my username
general 2021-07-18 10:46:23 
general 2021-07-18 10:46:33 Ok so my username was gold.en/sword=301
general 2021-07-18 10:46:36 he updated it
general 2021-07-18 10:46:58 idk, Yousuf just wanted to do that
general 2021-07-18 10:47:08 Ima put back fake link again
general 2021-07-18 10:48:01 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:20:09 No they’re not living organisms and don’t swim like a fish, so they’re not
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:21:54 Bruh <@456226577798135808> Just chose this chat using a randomizer just to say this random thing
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:23:01 Planes are their main armaments
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:23:07 As well
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:23:20 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:23:35 Didn’t see that at first h
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:29:58 More power
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:30:04 in the skies
general 2021-07-19 00:35:09 It doesn't have an explosive, it just kills all the zombies ahead of it when a zombie touches it
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:36:35 Auto aim guns as well
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:37:08 Ye scrap that, I want that now
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:37:26 So that I can fix my trash aim
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:38:04 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:39:33 At the same time the shredders with guns would be more buff
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:39:50 And if they're faster than you, have no problem hit and running
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:40:30 basically fireworks but lower firerate and longer range
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:41:30 Probably
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:42:16 Wait what about having double the pvp weapons we have rn but make it so we can change the purpose of each weapon in configure to edit menu?
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:43:11 Though the double weapon benefits only applies when you have more than 3k blocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:43:46 Cuz double weaponry in my spaceship would make me a spam build (yes I have maxed armaments)
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:43:52 First time?
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:44:30 I know
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:44:37 But there's no reason to report me rn
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:44:39 anyways
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:44:55 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:45:18 Or actually that's too much reduction
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:45:27 At least 4 would be nice
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 00:50:13 Also how old are you, I'm starting to think you're an unde
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 01:00:54 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 01:13:04 As usual
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 01:13:09 Toxicity and screaming goats
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 01:13:21 Except yesterday when general was so calm
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 01:21:37 Skill issue I suppose
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 01:21:59 Force quit it then
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 01:22:05 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 01:25:47 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 01:29:45 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 01:29:55 Though you cn but the mechanism would be rather complex
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 01:30:19 Pilot seat is pilot seat
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 01:30:30 Basically a seat where you can control your build
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 01:30:53 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 01:30:57 Nobody else can control it
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 01:31:10 Np
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 02:04:46 Perhaps it's just the build size
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 02:05:14 Also I heard that roblox runs on cpu not gpu so even if you have best graphics card if your cpu sucks then good luck
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 02:05:40 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 02:10:44 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 02:13:07 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 03:41:59 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 05:31:45 Looking pog but why make a maid outfit out of all the stuff you could make
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 05:31:46 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 05:48:53 I just realized now that you photoshopped a maid costume over the actual build
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 05:55:06 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:17:24 Oh I thought it's how much suspension's length changes when a force acts on it
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:17:41 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:17:54 2 directions, front and back
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:19:15 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:32:38 Dude that destroys whatever he wants to in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:33:12 You're good, but not god
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:33:34 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:33:56 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:34:01 Ikfin gun
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:34:33 Rapid fire firework launcher
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:34:36 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:36:07 I can't set one up cuz I ran out of keybind space
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:36:24 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:49:49 They’re good for attrition warfare where-in you slowly remove blocks from an opponent to make them more and more unstable
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:52:01 Then do it with other wing
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:52:06 Remove ability to fly
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:53:26 What
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:53:33 h
general 2021-07-19 06:56:16 Huh
general 2021-07-19 06:56:23 Haven’t seem duee be toxic
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:58:54 Taste the sun
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:59:16 With new photosynthesis technology
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:59:31 e
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:59:42 There was a short but heavy downpour like uh
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:59:47 I guess 20 minutes ago
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 07:02:07 Ye why
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 07:03:16 Red thunderstorm
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 07:04:10 Nah that’s just a small cloud nothing to worry about
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 07:04:42 Yep
general 2021-07-19 07:05:23 Death
general 2021-07-19 07:05:33 Cuz dude left
general 2021-07-19 07:05:41 Ice
general 2021-07-19 07:05:52 What
general 2021-07-19 07:06:01 0 °C
general 2021-07-19 07:06:04 Very cold
general 2021-07-19 07:06:20 Too poon for pcc
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 07:10:34 Omg ban
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 07:10:55 And I just realized I was at general a while ago and not at plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 07:14:07 Just downscale image using photo editor
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 07:14:30 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 09:19:06 <@456226577798135808> You haven't replied yet
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 09:57:36 Dreadnoughts are big ships, nothing is too big for a dreadnought
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 10:11:02 Tha amount of patience that went in to getting these shots
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 10:12:03 Probably just you and most builder tryhards
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 10:12:13 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 10:12:20 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 10:14:32 And a ton of waiting
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 11:25:02 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 11:25:34 <@!739369649971527720> You are now high rank now
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 11:25:49 Same

plane-crazy 2021-07-21 06:49:35 How doe
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 06:49:48 It’s just a small bump in the surface
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 06:50:49 Nvm dude can’t answer me
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 06:51:25 Idk, try making the helicopter heavier

plane-crazy 2021-07-21 06:57:18 I’m getting unde vibes
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 06:57:21 Oh nvm
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 06:57:44 h
general 2021-07-21 06:59:44 Wow plane crazy new map leak
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 07:01:05 Sussy
general 2021-07-21 07:01:49 Nope, new map is different from this
general 2021-07-21 07:01:54 Possibly
general 2021-07-21 07:02:09 But this is how detailed the new map would probably be
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 07:05:26 Hopefully you don’t get flooded with downvotes
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 07:10:25 e, but just expect the worst so that whenever it actually does happen you are ready to accept the results
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 07:10:52 Though if you do get praised in <#384025409945337856> then at least you get a nice surprise
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 07:12:00 Looks fine tbh
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 07:13:32 And first reaction was downvote
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 07:13:32 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 07:15:06 <@456226577798135808> you poob

plane-crazy 2021-07-21 08:52:28 shredder boat
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 09:28:31 Cuz there's 0 land in the back
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 09:28:38 Which means easier takeoff

creations-chat 2021-07-21 10:40:14 Wow HoF build
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 10:43:40 What colors do you need
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 10:44:12 try 159, 0, 255
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 10:44:14 for purple
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 10:44:22 for orange is 255, 127, 0
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 10:44:38 for yellow just do 255, 255, 0
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 10:44:51 np
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 10:47:41 Oh ye and just use these numbers whenever you want to make colors:

0, 31, 63, 97, 127, 159 ,191, 223, 255
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 11:46:02 Gonna let you know that Ikfin is one of the best pvpers, he's capable of dismantling servers within minutes (hours if all players in the server are skilled players)
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 11:46:30 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 11:52:12 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 12:41:24 It do be uh
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 13:03:54 If only I could join
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 13:04:11 I wanna use a half piston car on that creature
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 13:06:43 can't rn
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 13:07:38 By this point if he's still doing it I would've brought in the lag machine and break a rule to get rid of the rule breaker
plane-crazy 2021-07-21 13:08:25 ye
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:16:08 spacehouse
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:39:14 Yes but can you 1v1 my blocky plane in there?
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:41:13 Ok so uh
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:41:53 Motorlocks are used to put blocks in places they can't be put in due to having a block in a certain position already
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:41:59 Basically
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:42:17 Do not use motorlock just because you can
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:42:35 You only have 999 motors avaiolable to place anyways
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:43:15 You inability to get over that argument
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:43:26 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:43:58 It already happened in the past, he is no longer doing it anymore
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:44:37 Anyways uh there is also another technique called angle locking
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:44:44 Where you basically use locked motors
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:44:50 that spin
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:45:08 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:45:24 Also when they do
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:45:34 They also unlock
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:45:40 They no longer half
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:46:18 Wait lemme get a tutorial of angle locking
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:46:52 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=milhBhz92AQ&ab_channel=JustRens <@!593544426111107085> basically
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:55:35 You can go anywhere
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:55:42 And build train tracks with ease
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:56:46 I mean if the slope isn't steep enough it could work for a while
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:57:00 Though only being able to go straight up
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:57:35 Ok so TNT is invincible
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:57:41 So it protects motorlocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:57:57 amog
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:57:59 sus
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:58:09 There's no ice tnt material doe
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:58:13 And no beams
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:58:44 AH i see
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:58:51 It's for angle lock mechanisms
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:59:07 To delay the motorlock from occuring
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:59:13 Try disconnectors
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 00:59:59 But ye if you wanna become a builder tryhard just use motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:00:10 NAh
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:00:20 You can turn of explosion pressure and radius
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:04:27 aogus
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:05:10 You can use half blocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:05:25 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:05:36 Ye you can also use yt
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:06:21 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:06:54 So
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:06:56 1x1 block
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:08:53 Well then your knowledge is wrong
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:08:56 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:09:50 perhaps he is, perhaps he isn't
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:10:03 It's up to you to decide
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:11:25 Ah nothing, don't mind it
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:11:48 It's just the nature of pcc
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:12:11 And so far <#384021699466756107> is basically going to get as toxic as <#497142796961054721>, might even be like <#504436696021204992> soon
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:12:21 Compared to back then when it was just
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:12:23 very chill
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:14:53 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:18:22 When the j is j
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:19:11 Wait lemme go look at your jet
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:19:17 As well as replies
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:19:49 could possibly because it's too dark to see
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:19:54 Repost one with light colors
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:20:12 But there is no way it's "basic"
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:20:49 For people who wanna see jet (increase brightness)
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:22:26 I mean
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:22:33 If you can make like uh
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:22:38 Jets with unique shape
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:22:41 Then they're good
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:32:06 Oh you mean the movable lag machine?
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:32:50 wait
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:33:00 That's actually a nice plane shape
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:33:06 When unmotorlocked
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:33:15 Looks like some sort of space fighter
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:33:25 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:33:36 You should make a custom space fighter
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:35:25 e
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:35:30 Np I guess
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:35:43 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:36:10 Ye this is the best chat to ask for feedback actually
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:36:24 Or <#478584971670454284> when plane crazy gets too toxic. <#504436696021204992> is the best place to get roasted and <#497142796961054721> is the best place to get ignored especially when you have a hard time trying to fit in into random talks
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:42:13 Ye, just put a ton of ballasts
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:42:24 Or rockets that point downwards
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:44:23 I like how gyazo was extremely useful in apps like discord but at first glance seemed rather useless
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 01:51:33 Probably some lights in front?
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:01:39 Looking fine
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:32:02 The
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:35:53 <@!465250466025177099>
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:38:21 HOW DO
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:39:28 yes why
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:39:53 Does it deflect rockets doe
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:40:33 AT least it isn't german pinwheel or sussy sausage
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:41:49 What
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:43:29 I'd rather lag the server to remove a pp build
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:44:03 What if they're anchored
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:44:09 What if they're despawned
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:44:44 Lag machines either remove everyone in the server or remove the pp build in the server or both. All scenarios will save the unde's eyes from an abomination worse than a lag machine
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:46:02 Eating_glue_face.jpg
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:46:25 What
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:47:32 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:47:38 h
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:49:00 yo tengo
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:51:23 are both of them modifiable?
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:51:40 Like heavy modification
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:52:26 Hm
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:53:33 starter plane, small size which makes it hard to hit
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:54:04 And you can add turrets as well
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 02:54:48 Though without any modifications then I prefer shredder bug tbh cuz at least you can kill people with it <:pain:644301805534183464>

help 2021-07-22 08:02:55 That’s is basically the reason hover drives exist
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 08:04:39 Suicide is just shortcut to quitting game
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 08:04:58 Sinde developer was too lazy to add a quit game ability
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 08:05:14 Actually you go to hell according to the bible if you suicide

plane-crazy 2021-07-23 04:57:37 You choose
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 04:59:31 unless it's an omni bug which would be tougher
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 05:00:15 YEs but it's just a short time frame before they blast off to another waypoint
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 05:01:56 The omni bugs I see are always constantly moving
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 05:02:38 Haven't seen one that stops longer than 1 second to get hit
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 05:03:09 I do, I use cloaking for that

plane-crazy 2021-07-23 09:39:24 Ye want link
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 09:39:32 Also chat is hyper-active
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 09:40:40 <@!155149108183695360> you farf
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 09:40:45 fard

plane-crazy 2021-07-23 09:40:49 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 09:41:45 Oh ye forgot to mention that their <#497142796961054721> chat is so active that seeing *"several people are typing"* is a common sight
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 12:34:53 I think I found a use for discord light mode

basically you can use light mode to make yourself less suspicious especially when the school asks you to go to a website/app which normally has light mode as it's main theme
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 12:35:03 Wait wrong chat
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 12:35:05 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 12:35:26 Ok so basically cuz of the reflection in your face changes when you switch tabs
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 12:35:42 When you switch from google forms to discord
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 12:35:50 reflection changes
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 12:36:28 light mode eliminates that change, making you less suspicious to observers who don't see your screen but can see your face
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 12:37:21 Also you may wanna increase your reaction time in switching tabs as well
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 12:37:31 Like make discord ready as your 2nd tab
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 12:37:58 perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 12:38:50 g
plane-crazy 2021-07-23 12:43:09 I only have 1

plane-crazy 2021-07-25 03:44:00 Since he said “I cannot tell” then that means there is a purpose behind it rather than just him doing it for his own pleasure

plane-crazy 2021-07-25 04:22:00 It’s true doe

general 2021-07-26 11:53:35 Ok so lemme try to explain this
general 2021-07-26 11:53:55 Yes you can ask what an image role is and dyno will give you the answer
general 2021-07-26 11:54:08 But some people ask "How to post images"
general 2021-07-26 11:54:16 Dyno doesn't send an answer
general 2021-07-26 11:55:27 The suggestion basically says to make it so that dyno will auto reply to people with less than level 3 and said "post images" that they would need to get level 3 with mee6
general 2021-07-26 11:55:49 Exactly
general 2021-07-26 11:56:02 But she told me that "that already exists"

plane-crazy 2021-07-27 11:47:57 Why hasn't this been in my recommendations
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 11:48:18 Perhaps it's cuz of my little brother watching kids videos, causing my recommendations to mess up badly
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 11:48:46 Nah he wouldn't be interested in this yet
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 16:28:51 He's probably good as he is the developer of the game, he knows almost every bugs, blocks, and mechanics of the game
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 16:28:59 he just doesn't have time to actually make something
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 16:29:49 If pc2 was released it would also probably be very buggy
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 16:30:32 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 16:31:09 Actually costs resources
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 16:31:16 And actually makes you tired
plane-crazy 2021-07-27 16:31:43 Nah, all I have to move is my hands

plane-crazy 2021-07-28 01:31:00 Ah yes rank bias
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 01:31:53 True doe but at least it had more effort than whatever that thing is above
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:34:36 I see. I thought it was like the times you killed enemies divided by the times you died divided by 10
creations-chat 2021-07-28 01:40:16 You only have 150 1x1 blocks of invincibility doe, you should focus on speed (put thrust vectored hover thrusters, use ice everywhere, etc.)
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 01:44:45 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 01:44:55 Definitely the Poland flag and not the Indonesian flag

creations-chat 2021-08-01 09:23:00 The dreadnought isn't even an original design, it's an sby ship. So there would be multiple people building the dreadnought.

reply to <@!852934999824269322>: It's ugly. Even if it works fine and does it's job without fail, if it looks comparable to a starter plane then it sucks and people will downvote it. That's how <#384025409945337856> works.

plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:32:30 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:33:03 I can no longer get designer III if I happen to lose my ranks from leaving server for too long
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:33:24 I used a build with 30 upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:33:39 It doesn't have 50 upvotes so if I lose rank I become white name
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 12:39:03 noob

plane-crazy 2021-08-01 19:00:08 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 19:01:23 There is literally no good reason to put up a flag just for a sexuality
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 19:02:39 <@!688971608970625025> what if we delete it for low effort <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 19:04:59 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 19:05:01 Cheese
plane-crazy 2021-08-01 19:05:13 No
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:25:32 Does my floating gun platform count as a boat
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:26:16 If you don't know what it is
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:26:55 g
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:26:58 It also fast
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:27:08 400 sps (600 with booster)
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:27:20 Can demolish a couple boats with ease
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:28:23 Yes but it's not often you see combat effective boats
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:28:50 Though I still have to make a boat that combines pvp effectivity and looks
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:29:19 Sad truth
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:30:05 I said I would be travelling at 400-600 sps doe
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:30:20 With average maneuverability
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:31:03 I killed a ton of boats with that doe
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:31:40 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:31:49 Ye why
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:32:03 Used a road roller with 30 upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:33:04 Road roller btw
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:36:15 It's effective doe
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:36:40 Cry about it not having motorlock, it can beat up stuff and dodge hits
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:37:40 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:37:52 No <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:38:11 Pog
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:38:52 I mainly use my spaceship doe, significantly better than the boat
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:39:49 True
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:40:10 High skill needed but high effectiveness
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:41:56 Searched it up, ye it doesn't exist
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:44:13 Death
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:45:28 lag it out
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:45:38 Wdym
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:45:43 It provides more benefits
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:45:46 think about it
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:45:56 Yes but that means the c will be gone
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:46:04 If he doesn't leave everyone will soon have to leave
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:47:30 It
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:47:32 It fli
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 00:48:26 Btw did you use ice?

plane-crazy 2021-08-02 01:46:32 use folding
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 01:54:57 Ofc yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 01:55:12 This is the same game where apparently a car can swim
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 01:55:21 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 01:55:31 Fortnite has been long dead
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 01:56:14 Basically commit oil tanker on someone
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:31:20 Just use piston
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:31:28 And attach a half block
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 02:31:32 with fabric material

plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:29:35 Original video btw
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:29:45 I just disabled the teleportation part of it
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:30:21 Just disable the half piston
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:31:05 Nah
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:31:09 It's not even laggy
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:31:25 Just don't click the teleport button
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:31:32 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:31:34 Hm
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:31:36 Anyways
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:31:52 I guess try to observe how pro builders make their jets?
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:32:03 Unique shape, I like it
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:32:35 Also I am still confused on how to make jets
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:32:40 Idk how to even make the body
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:33:05 pain
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:33:46 Spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:33:51 Jkjk make uh
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:34:03 Serious motor locking
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:34:05 and piston locc
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:34:51 Just turn on lock button in pistons
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:35:01 adjust the distance to make piston fit
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:35:36 For some guidance to extend 1 block using a half piston, set the value to 2.5
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:36:44 Basically motorlocking, allows you to fit blocks in places they can't be placed in
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:37:14 Like places that need to be filled in but motorlock can't do so
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:38:00 True
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:38:19 Yes become builder tryhard
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:38:32 While I stay as poob
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:39:06 Yes but other than that I very poob
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:39:15 All my other builds are like

plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:41:15 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:41:23 I have dark origins
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:42:03 Same, I was impressed by the sheer power it brought in
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:42:21 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:44:04 It's really a missile
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:44:41 Shredders are weaponized builds that rely on cutters to deal most of it's damage
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:46:29 sus
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:46:32 amog
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:48:47 Guys should I make an alt account and build something super pro and detailed there
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:48:54 And ask people to come to my plot like
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:49:01 like all the kids in public servers do
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:49:26 Actually nvm
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:49:40 gonna take too much effort
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:49:55 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:50:25 "I can build better than you"

*Casually spawns a super detailed halo ship or smth*
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:50:55 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:52:01 One time people thought my Horizon was a tut cuz I kept demolishing builds in public servers they thought there was a video about it
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:53:14 Or rather original builds dedicated to pvp
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:53:35 Cuz tuts can kill a spam car that's easy
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 03:53:44 Or some galleon ship

plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:10:35 Nah don't
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:10:58 There shouldn't be any rule that prevents the community from being toxic
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:11:08 helps drive away undes from going here
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:11:59 Get level 3 with mee6
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:12:17 yep
general 2021-08-02 04:13:57 tasty
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:15:03 Tbh that's the most useless toggle option I've ever seen
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:15:25 Even more useless than anchor block physics (which actually has a use)
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:16:11 saddamogus
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:16:39 Saddam is prequel to amogus confirmed ?!?!?!?!

plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:20:41 wot
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:21:20 Is your f-15 a tut?
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:21:33 Tell him to ask for proof
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:21:43 If he can't respond then he's a noob
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:22:09 Ah I see
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:22:20 Just look up on yt on how to make aircraft wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:24:30 YEs I would like that
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:24:56 Cuz I wanna make like a missile that explodes to multiple bombs that drop over enemies
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:25:44 Missiles here cannot track
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:26:11 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:26:39 Lag
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:26:51 So much lag from 2 builds in the water
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:28:10 
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:28:15 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:28:30 playing pvp mode the way it's supposed to be played is illegal and not fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:31:59 OMGOMG YOU'RE PLAYING THE GAME TOXICCC
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:32:14 
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:34:20 That's pvp mode for you
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:34:30 ALso the truck is probably a bait
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:36:12 1 spaceship and 3 spaceboats
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:36:31 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:37:16 Use 50 speed folds
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:37:42 Same but since I'm a spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:37:52 It's not really a problem
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:37:59 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:38:53 wait actually you can use anchor blocks to fix the flinging issue
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:38:55 <@!404632014189494293>
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:39:02 Like just put 1 in 1 fold
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:39:06 Then clicc button
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:39:34 Nope those pics are from yesterday
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:39:56 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:42:31 Nice firework show
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 04:46:24 the
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:21:28 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIEk_96PJ5M&ab_channel=Boxness The
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:22:27 I discovered about the glitch but never knew how to properly implement it
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:26:29 Keep it the way it is
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:26:49 I think being able to go underwater would be nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:31:26 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:32:02 Btw <@!744357097000665088> can you try out the under the void glitch for me pls since you have a spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:32:24 Skol
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:33:57 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:34:28 Flame crazy
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:35:49 Oh ye just 1 instruction, put at least 1 basic motor 2 turret in the spaceship for the test
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:36:09 Either of these 2 turrets will do
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:36:46 Ah no, just to see if the turrets will die and break my build
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 05:37:16 Cuz motors have the ability to "block" the anchor block from anchoring blocks from the other side
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:18:17 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:44:33 Wait what date did it occur again?
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:45:22 Nope, cutter would be chopped to pieces
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:45:34 Rendering fragments unusable
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:45:43 And useless
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:46:49 Star platinum car
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 06:47:00 One day roblos fixed motorlocc

plane-crazy 2021-08-03 02:20:21 Last time I did it I had to motorlock several layers of legacy glass and put 1 layer of paint block glass

plane-crazy 2021-08-03 02:25:51 and 1 layer of paint block glass
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 02:25:55 Just for 1 way

plane-crazy 2021-08-03 02:30:45 Basically glass that blocks light from entering from 1 side but allows light to enter from a certain side
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 02:31:19 Wait I don't think light in video games can be really considered as light
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 02:31:38 It just blocks the view from 1 side
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 02:31:44 yes

plane-crazy 2021-08-03 02:34:48 Planes as well
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 02:34:57 Nobody here really made a combat boat
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 02:35:20 I meant only a few people*
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 02:36:21 The amount of combat boats that exist is the same as the amount of spaceships that exists (which within that category, only a few combat spaceships exist)
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 02:36:53 But ye military jets, tanks, spam builds, and shredder bugs are overbuilt
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 02:37:37 There is

plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:15:09 ye motor 2s work differently
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:15:20 I used motor 2s instead of motor in a tnt scatter cannon
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:16:06 pro
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:16:32 So higher is better?
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:18:42 But opposite for mouse controlled mode
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:18:47 Interesting
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:19:07 How fast rope pulls back I guess
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:20:37 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:20:51 Welp can't fix my spaceship trash aim at high speeds then
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:20:55 
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:22:05 my turrets are super light, they're not battleship turrets
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:22:21 The turret in the right ^
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:22:35 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:23:16 Oh ye and idk if you experience this but when you go fast with turrets on, you can't hit anything in your sides
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:23:49 Make a fast flying object, add turrets in it, and try shooting at your sides
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:24:06 yay
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:24:09 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:24:54 What

plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:25:50 and yes also above 1k
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:26:06 deadth
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:26:15 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:26:29 Does torque fix that
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 13:26:38 Or am I forever stuck at shooting at my sides
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 14:22:46 near perfect timing
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 14:23:24 the
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 15:35:02 Pain
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 15:35:04 And
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 15:35:05 sorrow
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 15:35:09 
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 16:29:24 It’s
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 16:29:27 A font
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 16:29:30 Smol font
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 00:42:03 death
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:05:01 WHy
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:05:17 You can build anything without motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:06:14 You can make detailed things without motorlock, lesrn all the blocks first and decide when to use said blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:06:32 If there is something you can't fit with normal methods use moterlocc
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:07:01 Same
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:07:33 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:07:38 
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:07:50 Then that's not a nuke, that's a scatter bomb
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:08:08 Bomb that scatters around
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:08:17 A nuke decimates everything around it in 1 big blow
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:08:53 Yours decimates stuff with multiple bombs
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:09:30 cool
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:09:58 Welcome to flame crazy (yes, flame)
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:10:02 Anyways uh
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:10:15 First thing is just kill them, show no mercy
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:10:29 A common technique is baiting
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:10:43 Like make a tank, then make shredder come and explode them
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:11:08 If you have a decently fast and maneuverable build you can just fly around and shoot the shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:11:20 Won't work, shredders can attack from above
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:11:32 Works only for long shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:11:57 Oh I meant like from above
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:12:01 Attack from above
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:12:16 If a shredder is competent enough to not go below and explode himself
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:12:47 Wait hold on
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:12:56 Can you send me image of said atom bomb?
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:13:09 At least it works
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:13:13 And is way easier
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:13:33 Seems fine
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:14:09 I guess that's the case for "civilized players"
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:15:10 (GASF members didn't like me using helium and turrets on a spaceship <:pain:644301805534183464>)

plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:35:31 WHy isn't it
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:36:09 I mean yes it has it's inaccuracies but it's the most accurate form of verifying with the least amount of privacy leak
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:37:26 Then we go listen carefully
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 01:37:31 I guess

plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:49:47 You are correct
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:49:51 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:50:11 You're not alone, now stop whining about that
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:50:37 It's because pcc members have no social life
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:50:48 It's hard to make friends irl
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:51:00 What
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:51:14 I only have 1 friend
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:51:19 irl
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:51:36 The
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:53:00 Cuz this is just the nature of pcc
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:53:04 Toxic as hell
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:53:24 The community is dominated by teens
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:53:41 Compared to build a boat which is dominated by kids
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:53:53 There's yt
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:54:23 Ok and?

plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:54:38 You calling a contest winner trash <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:55:00 True
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:55:08 Which is why use a skill called ignore and cope

plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:55:28 ANywyas
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:56:14 Every game is bomarded by the same age group
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:56:40 But then only a certain age group will actually like the game
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:56:52 With  almost similar personality
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:57:47 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:58:44 I like it cuz pvp
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:58:50 You get to make your own pvp vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:59:03 Smartness doesn't define what games you like
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 13:59:34 if build a boat had sandbox mode
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:00:08 Well I mean their engines suck anyways
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:00:36 But less complex and easier to use
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:00:58 Me

plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:03:33 FIght fire with fire
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:04:47 I guess just search up one in yt
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:04:50 Then just figure out
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:04:53 How to downscale it
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:04:59 Figure out what blocks to remove
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:05:06 and what smaller alternatives to use
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:05:21 Then don't make a helicopter then
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:05:25 Start with a simpler build
plane-crazy 2021-08-04 14:24:12 ~~Spaceship~~ start with a land vehicle like a car or tank, try to make it look nice

plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:58:22 Actually nvm if plane crazy was pay to win they would added things like hyper rockets, shotgun guns, respawnable nukes
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:58:35 It makes building and testing easier
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:59:14 Also grav slider is really
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:59:18 helpful
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 02:59:35 For testing big builds like airships, halo warships, weird builds
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 03:00:15 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 03:00:51 There's added stress on having to use skill

plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:29:39 He can't
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:30:02 But I don't care because if it can't get out of spawn then it's ineffective
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:31:05 Spawn killing is hated actually
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:31:31 But it is also one of the issues in pvp that only makes sure the strongest players stay
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:31:48 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:32:50 Those are the weakest shredders
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:32:57 Even the regular shredder beats it in pvp combat performance
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:33:34 <@!718900665187041433> Can you shift + f4 in roblox

plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:34:31 Shredder bugs are any builds that uses cutters to deal most of it's damage
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:34:48 If most of the destruction is dealt using cutters than that's a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 10:35:29 Plane craze with increased pvp block count limit

plane-crazy 2021-08-08 12:39:07 1 block in piaton length is 2.5 studs
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 12:39:14 That's 5 distance
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 12:40:38 Alr I think I have a clue on how long max piston length is
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 12:40:48 At 4 distance it is equal to 1.6 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 13:06:28 <@!651361636657135617> What is the chinese chat saying

plane-crazy 2021-08-08 13:26:08 Basically makes the piston head unable to be moved by external forces
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 13:26:41 Only the piston itself will be able to extend and retract
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 13:30:21 Ye

plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:22:11 Day 4 of searching for 1v1s in build a boat because even their official server doesn't have any pvpers
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:22:39 The
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 14:58:35 He blends in with the crowd
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:19:21 Huge hamon warrior becomes a hammer
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:19:23 g
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:20:16 Looks nice but that is still trash according to this server's standards
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:20:46 Yes very pain
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:21:15 I also have an anti-shrebber nuke
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:21:16 g
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:39:12 
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:39:23 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:39:49 Because the bottom picture was posted by an expert rank so it gets all the upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:42:10 Pro
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:46:00 The plane has more details than whatever that truck is
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:46:50 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:47:56 MAkes me understand more on how <#384025409945337856> work and why do these low detail builds get more upvotes than higer detail builds
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:48:22 LAst time that occured was on this
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:50:45 You got high upvotes because there was nothing really wrong with your build. It seems like the amount of upvotes you get depends on how much proportion errors your build has
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:51:04 As well as level of detail
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:51:15 lo
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:55:17 Just because you have an expert rank doesn't mean you deserve upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:56:10 We already discussed about that, I want to see why he thinks that those upvotes/downvotes were well deserved
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:57:01 It looks like the average spam build in public servers with a little more detail
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:58:23 Eh I mean most spam builds are either uncolored or black colored
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:58:51 Hm no
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:59:08 It just doesn't have enough detail to get those upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:59:55 Omg hof
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 00:59:59 Get that on hof
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:00:08 Ultra pro moterlok

plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:01:31 There is no ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:02:13 I mean the silence isn't wrong at all
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:07:08 Everyone here makes their own builds in one form or another
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:10:10 I can go 15k sps in any direction
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:10:16 That's slow
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:10:45 Even someone managed to make some random build go 400k sps using a powerful hover drive
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:14:01 Death
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:15:03 I wished the sentient water bottle kept the old options so I could construct a spaceship I had in mind

plane-crazy 2021-08-09 01:56:24 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 02:50:41 Or if you do an ambush strike, usually when Ikfin slows down to attack a ground vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 02:51:15 But when he attack other planes then he's basically invincible
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 02:52:00 And I have the ability to hide in the 4th dimension
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:11:39 Exactly
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:11:59 And I just wanna get expert rank to access hidden chat and more private servers
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:12:20 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:12:23 You can chat there
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:12:55 Is it because of actually decent moderation?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:12:59 And probably cuz of game genre
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:13:52 Plane crazy is a sandbox engineering game which attracts people with a cold and competitive personality. Genshin is uh
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:13:59 Idk what genshin is
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:14:17 Wow you
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:15:05 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:15:35 I suppose that because it's a casual game it should be the reason why it attracts people with a warm and friendly behavior
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:16:03 ur dad

plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:21:50 Assuming I can finish upgrading my Lycentian Federal Battleship
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:22:02 There's so much extra blocks in that thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 03:22:07 Hacks

plane-crazy 2021-08-09 05:03:48 While they're relatively easy to demolish, they're really annoying
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 05:03:59 Especially when they're super persistent
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 05:04:08 They just won't stop ruining the fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 06:00:51 Can I explode you
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 06:01:08 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 06:01:40 No
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 06:01:44 
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 08:53:36 I mean even if it were to stop rockets you could always finish the enemies inside with guns

plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:22:26 His standards are too high
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:23:23 It's also been a while since I've seen toxicity in <#497142796961054721>
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:23:57 But it's more peaceful than normal
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:24:13 Stage 2 of fixing pcc is changing the moderators and replacing them with new ones
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:24:27 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:24:58 Last time I got warned for "nsfw music" it isn't even nsfw, bruh

And then purified water was being a good event hoster and just
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:25:01 changed the options
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:25:26 Only the 1st warn I had was reasonable
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:26:05 Because it is the physical manifestation of doom itself
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:27:07 Then make spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:27:09 If not jet
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:27:14 Otherwise make helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:27:18 Or uh
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:27:33 Make a unique contraption, flying dragon, automatic gun, etc.
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:28:05 Ok I go

plane-crazy 2021-08-09 12:52:23 If you're poob like me you can go hide in the 4th dimension then go back to 3rd dimension to attack shrebber dall
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 12:53:30 Shrebber dugs have no control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 12:53:32 They're missiles

plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:22:32 And you really rating cuz ass ship
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:22:41 I'm asking you to rate based on the edit quality, not the build otherwise I would've sent an unedited pic
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:23:00 Though I can agree my build looks bad
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:25:32 (Can actually beat you down, especially ground vehicles)
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:26:18 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:28:33 Eh
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:28:39 Motorlock bombs aren't really destructive
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:33:41 So rickje likes lag machines and nsfw builds <:pain:644301805534183464>
creations-chat 2021-08-13 02:35:02 No I don't remember that kid
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:36:34 Though for now the only way to stop lag machines, shredder bugs, and other abominations is to fight fire with fire
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:37:37 I want to assert dominance
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:37:50 g
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:38:21 Also why would I leave a suspicious biological sausage alone, it need to be eliminated from the server
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:39:07 At least basic gun weapons
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:39:15 So that troop carriers would have a purpose
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:39:38 Funi
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:39:50 Well I mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:39:56 We already have water on a plane game
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:40:00 as well as land vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:40:03 So why not infantry
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:42:31 At least more risk
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:42:50 Which means team battles would have more strategies to play with
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:43:34 Which also means I would have to warp out way more quickly otherwise some bacon noob will get in my spaceship when I sapwn
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:44:38 Not if battles had rules and were regulated by everyone
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:44:50 Oh ye, I think to make sure this doesn't happen is to
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:45:03 Is to like make player guns 50% weaker
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:45:34 10k motors
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:45:42 Embrace motorism
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:45:46 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:46:34 Wow he
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:47:07 Now to nerf it even more, hand knifes can instant kill players but can't do much to blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:47:23 Oh ye and player guns can only do 20% damage to block compared to normal gun
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:47:24 cuz
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:47:25 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 02:47:43 yes

plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:31:41 It's just strange how my spaceship can compete with other planes
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:32:13 Delete that before pcc demolishes you
plane-crazy 2021-08-13 05:32:39 It is h

plane-crazy 2021-08-14 03:06:08 j
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 05:10:13 Death
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 10:52:14 It's ugly because it's for pvp
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 10:58:28 I mean according to pcc standards they're really ugly
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 10:58:43 1v1 me then
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 10:59:27 he is
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 10:59:35 He has limited brainpower
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 10:59:44 Proven by him saying that that's the best build he can make
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:00:39 Doesn't disprove the fact that you can't make any better builds
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:00:54 A common roadblock for the brains of underage people
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:01:55 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:02:07 I thought it's the determination put in a build
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:03:22 There are 2 types of effort: perceived effort and absolute effort.

Perceived effort is the amount of effort we think is put into something 
while absolute effort is the actual blood and tears shed into doing something.
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:03:35 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:03:42 Also this is made up, not an actual definiton
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:06:09 You also have to consider level of motivation. It's gonna get more boring as time goes on building something. And so you have to force yourself to complete it because you get something to play with at the end
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:06:32 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:06:34 now 1v1
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:08:41 No funi moments with non-pvp vehicles in my opinion
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:08:53 Unless you can make something poggers
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:09:18 Wdym
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:09:48 <@!443752316240265226> Organize your thoughts and open your mind. Then come back to me to debate with us.
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:10:12 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:10:27 Not all non-pvp vehicles are boring
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:10:30 I have a road roller
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:10:32 Which does funi
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:10:43 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:10:44 heli

plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:11:44 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:12:23 Also this kinda describes me as well
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:12:29 Most of my builds
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:12:35 Are basically public pvp domination devices
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:12:42 Only a few are non-pvp builds
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:13:00 Well then you poob
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:13:31 DOn't bother arguing with him, he doesn't listen to your views

plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:17:41 Find another game if you won't bother trying anymore
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:17:50 Then try more
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:18:13 If you won't listen to our advices
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:18:19 You know, build better, build more stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:18:33 Then the only advice I have is to cope with your suffering
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:19:08 hm

plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:20:09 The only thing I hate about pepsi is him warning me for playing "nsfw music"
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:20:16 It's literally instrumental
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 11:20:25 Without any sus sound effects

plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:07:04 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:07:04 Wait what were you tryna do
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:07:24 I go show my equally garbage photoshop
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:07:38 Ok I need to make that new spaceship quick
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:07:42 Horizon is getting old
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:12:21 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:12:23 Pvp
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:12:42 Let’s do trollage
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:40:35 POV: You wanted to fly my spaceship but then you saw my list of keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:40:54 Ultimate trolling
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:05:41 Do you want my Horizon piloting guide
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:11:20 0 sps
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:11:45 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:12:51 Seriously, 0 sps since I don't have any <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:13:23 Though I have an 8 legged space spider which can go up to 40k sps (15k sps is max controllable speed)
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:13:53 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:14:01 (Also dude is better than me in spaceship pvp)
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:14:41 700 sps is upper limit
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:14:52 1.5k if you're skilled
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:15:39 But ridiculous speeds are nice if you need to run from powerful enemies that will beat you up
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:17:59 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:18:17 Conveyors*
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:18:22 But they provide too much power
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:18:33 Also their speed depends on how laggy you are
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:18:47 I do
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:18:51 I have both conv and hover drive
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:19:16 And I can tell you that conv is more stable at higher speeds
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:20:12 Hover drives at lower speeds mainly due to controllability. Conveyors are better at higher clock speeds like 6k sps since it eliminates wobble
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:21:36 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:21:49 Oh forgot to throw in super rockets for high acceleration without lag
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:22:18 They're very laggy
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:22:19 doe
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:22:21 You sure mate
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:30:35 Ballast is a little hard to use for a while
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:30:43 If you don't understand how they even work
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:30:55 And when to use them
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:31:15 I have 1 month of playtime
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:37:14 Who p i n g
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 03:37:17 I go check

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:24:16 Idk I guess good?
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:24:21 Probably trash tbh
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:26:05 The bottom left square as it won't obstruct the river pathway or road and you just need to remove a few parking lot space
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:26:54 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:27:00 I'm guessing I have trash taste
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:28:07 cool
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:28:09 anyways
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:29:01 Wait what even is the main goal in this test, do I just have to select some rectangle
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:30:33 Hm maybe I could get the thin rectangle beside cyan
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:30:40 yellow rectangle
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:31:01 And the past one is purple, and that's all
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:33:23 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:35:18 Like designate certain parts of the map for different parts of the building?
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:35:37 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:36:08 Ok I have trash building taste as proven by my lack of knowledge in this thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:38:28 Cut off the parts with the houses then
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:39:05 I suppose those random stuff below and at the right of the map are houses right
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:40:32 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:41:14 I haven't seen any building with a sloped wall
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:42:08 and a sloped wall could allow easier access to potential robbers and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:42:11 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:43:08 He gon
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:48:06 So we're making a camp

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:49:45 But anyways
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:50:02 Ye just cut off the part of the map which has houses
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:50:13 And the parking lot
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:50:56 Hm actually nvm the parking lot, let's just keep it
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:53:12 Everything except the houses

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:58:31 Cuz
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 04:59:25 You could downscale it I guess
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 05:00:15 h

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 05:00:58 Ye I'm going back to original big rectangles in the bottom

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:18:25 Wdym sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:18:28 I use it all the time
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:18:53 That's because they never heard of it
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:19:05 But once you know about the properties of ice
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:19:16 And it's inertia negation effects
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:19:33 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:19:39 Function over form my friend
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:20:59 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:21:16 But even so, the different between ice and normal blocks are negligible
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:21:40 Almost none
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:22:19 
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:22:25 Over here is the donald trump wall
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:22:32 The left side is normal blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:22:37 The right side is ice
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:22:43 <@!798957190399524865> bruh moment
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:23:05 Pro
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:24:31 It's good to convince yourself to suicide
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:27:03 Test it out yourself
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:27:09 Paint bucket your plane with ice
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:29:13 But the acceleration
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:29:22 Check your acceleration
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:29:52 Oh ye btw not all parts are affected by the mass negation properties of ice
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:30:04 Like half wedge 1x1/2 and half block wedge
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:30:11 There are a couple more as well but idk which ones
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:32:32 There you go
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 14:32:56 s u s
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 15:52:32 For me, it's just the usual plane, spam car, tank, and a shredder species mix of pvp
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 15:53:06 Nothing much
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 15:53:08 Just the same
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 15:53:12 And the same
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 15:53:21 And the other day, the same
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 15:53:36 Nothing unique
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:29:11 This thing is MASSIVE
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:29:23 My 2 plot long Lycentian Battleship is like
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:29:30 It's basically a child
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:29:41 Compared to this monstrosity
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:30:22 4 plots long and 1 plot wide
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:30:47 I suppose it's only 0.25 plots tall
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:32:25 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:32:26 he
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:37:17 1st step: make the design ridiculously absurd and
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:37:31 Absurd and unaerodynamic
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:37:50 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:43:07 Decided to shorten the duration of warp trails h
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:43:12 Does it look nice or smth
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:43:21 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:43:54 Purple is the actual warp color in starscape h
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:44:07 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:44:07 Also bluish white would be barely noticable in daytime
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:44:34 Ok I revert back to long trails
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:44:53 ~~And then some tryhard shredder would chase me because yes~~
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:45:28 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:46:31 Hello
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 16:47:31 I know how to motorlock but I just can't find any build which really needs it

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 17:26:06 Nah
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 17:26:19 I’d say they’re medium in difficulty
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 17:26:44 They have cutters
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 17:27:25 A rare sight but a skilled shredder user is basically me in my spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 17:27:57 Eh
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 17:28:06 How would that work
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 17:28:37 Should I make an omni to prove a point
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 17:29:13 Wdym fix
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 17:30:00 It’s not a bug doe, the developer made it work the way its intended

plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:08:49 Well you see
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:09:06 Here in pcc nobody cares if you can make the most advanced cannon capable of destroying 10 builds at once

plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:44:47 And intelligence
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:45:30 Seems like he just spammed motor locks just to flex his jet
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:45:39 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:46:05 But seems like it's an unnessecary amount tbh

plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:53:20 I mean some people don't even wanna put effort in this game, the mechanics are too complex for some people
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:53:48 You and I are not so different
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 03:53:58 I know, I just don't know when to use it

plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:05:39 Hm
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:05:58 But thing is there's gonna be a big language barrier if we all continue to speak 1 language
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:06:40 And some people might say "It's to keep out country's culture, without it our culture will be wiped"
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:07:18 Well here in the Philippines a majority of the population can speak English but still praise our own food, people, and culture
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 04:07:21 So yea

plane-crazy 2021-08-16 05:15:32 Otherwise it's fine as long as you can actually murder people with it
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 05:16:05 h

plane-crazy 2021-08-16 12:34:06 You can make it so that everyone in that group would have equal rights
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 12:34:09 And permissions
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 12:34:13 For now
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 12:34:26 Everyone would be mod I guess
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 12:35:02 Soyuz nerushimy
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 12:35:58 But there should be a mod team doe to regulate the server cuz then raiders would easily abuse the equal right system
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 12:36:04 Hmm
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 12:36:16 Maybe moderators can be nominated and voted for every 1 month
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 12:36:31 And when people don't like the mods we make them step out of power

plane-crazy 2021-08-17 16:02:39 Enough lift to fly
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 16:02:46 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 17:36:22 more lag doe
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 17:36:40 Unless they adding 2 seperate maps, 1 big 1 small
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 17:36:50 That would be enjoyable
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 17:37:28 Big map for testing versatility of vehicles and smaller map for testing raw power of a build
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 17:37:43 he
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 01:25:38 Build which uses too much pvp weapons for it's size

plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:19:24 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:19:35 I can do fake cobra in my drone battleship
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:22:58 I don;t think competing is gonna work better than a combined exploration unit
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:24:17 True pros: function over form
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:24:29 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:24:48 unde
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 02:27:05 Imagine grammer

plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:44:22 You
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 07:20:48 I can outrun
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 07:21:17 I just choose whatever is required for the situation
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 07:21:30 If the shredder is standing still, I use cloak from a far distance
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 07:21:33 Then strikk
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 07:21:53 If the shredder is moving, I do running
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 07:21:59 Multiple hit and runs
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 07:22:37 Also going under the map isn't a good place to cloak for both long duration and short duration cloaks
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 07:22:45 Just use conv to warp out and cloak
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 07:24:20 For short duration cloaks, when you need to strike a shredder quickly before it starts moving, just cloak a little far (but not too far) from shrebber then uncloak to troll
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 07:24:43 Scissor lift
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 11:18:47 Imagine normal wheels smhmsh

plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:30:38 They're basically shredder bugs from america
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:31:09 bovid cutter balls with guns
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:31:48 ye
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:34:06 Shredder balls only rely on cutters
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:34:15 Omni bugs rely on both cutters and guns
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:34:23 The equivalent of gun shredders
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:35:15 Why are shredder bugs now harder for me to kill than shredder balls and omni bugs
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:35:21 Those 2 are like
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:35:34 the peak of shredder technology
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:38:35 Sounds interesting
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:39:38 The bigger problem is aiming
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:39:53 if you put motor 2s your tnt cannon stuff will spill out
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:39:57 Wow you
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:40:19 Normal motor only works
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:40:25 Adding a cap won't work
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:40:34 Would still spill out because I do not know why
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:40:54 Try it yourself first
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:41:02 It only works for normal motors
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:41:15 In the case of motor 2, the tnt spills out in the sides
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 00:48:09 wow the

plane-crazy 2021-08-19 05:07:23 Or rather
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 05:07:25 plasma weaponry
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 05:07:33 Since they are really affected by gravity
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 05:21:23 What planes have genders?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 05:21:43 Can't wait to see how a male plane would look like
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 05:43:17 Happens to me
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 05:43:38 Cuz of the hyperoptimization building technique
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 05:43:49 It died to imposor

plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:03:05 Plane crazy is boring
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:03:17 And so people need to find a new way to entertain themselves
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:04:26 Do public pvp domination I guess
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:04:36 That's what I do
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:04:47 h

plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:50:30 Hello
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:51:12 Haven't seen any that can fire that quickly
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:51:35 All suspension cannons fire like 2-3 bullets/sec
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:52:11 nvm it doesn't rapid fire
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:52:38 It's the illusion of the suspension moving back and forth after it fires a bullet
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:52:55 Better than your average motorlocked ship/plane/tank/shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:53:50 I've seen too much of those already, we need something unique
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:54:01 Something that's rarely built
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:54:59 Tell me how many times did you encounter any of those 3 builds which use an absurd amount of motorlock just to look good
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 09:55:24 Or any of those 3 which at least uses a unique design

plane-crazy 2021-08-19 10:16:45 Someone has to make a compact one that can be driven around and be used
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 10:16:51 I guess I could try

plane-crazy 2021-08-19 13:49:31 AA turrets aren’t really even a threat anyways
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 13:49:39 Just a bunch of stationary turrets
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 13:50:23 With the occasional pro aim people
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 13:51:06 Last time I killed a moving pro aim turret I killed it with around moderate damage
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 13:51:18 Idk now
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 13:51:24 with all the upgrades

general 2021-08-19 16:15:37 I meanj
general 2021-08-19 16:15:46 Such feature would be useless once you know all of the blocks
general 2021-08-19 16:16:08 Would also add unnessecary lag and loading time I guess
general 2021-08-19 16:16:25 Wait do you have dyslexia or smth
general 2021-08-19 16:16:42 It just takes 5 seconds max
general 2021-08-19 16:16:56 Once you say shut up, you've lost the argument
general 2021-08-19 16:17:11 <@!335599526414909451> check this possible unde
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 16:17:55 What
general 2021-08-19 16:18:09 Wait I didn't realize this was <#497142796961054721>

general 2021-08-19 16:18:37 I go
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 16:19:58 True but your plane does look dorito-like
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 16:20:21 And paired with cheese grater wings and pro aim, you're basically gjsolo
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 16:20:39 My aim more poob
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:31:50 Ah yes roblox = unde
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 17:32:39 Ok adios
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 00:02:13 Hm yes lazy
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 00:02:20 Check <#490306593242611742>
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 00:03:16 I just want super large rocket engine <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 00:08:00 maybe in this version jet engines would have advantages over rockets
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 00:14:19 Would all the glitches and ultralight properties of ice be transferred to plane crazy 2?
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 00:14:29 Oh ye and nerfed piston glitch so I can still cloak, but removes the annoying fling proprties of it
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 00:18:02 Since a long time ago
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 00:18:05 This is a remodel
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 00:38:55 Poob
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 01:28:20 When you can create complex codes capable of automating your whole computer and simulate interesting concepts but can't even figure out how to operate a virtual and unrealistic motor
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 02:31:48 <@!217336009455566848> Will all the existing glitches like half piston cloaking glitch and ultralight ice material stay in plane crazy 2?
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 02:31:55 Smileyhats pinged the rick many times
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 02:31:57 Without die
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 02:32:11 So I suppose I also would not get die
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 02:32:41 Or rather be coded into the game as an intentional glitch
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 02:32:48 When they finish re-write
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 02:33:00 Like conv glitch and motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 03:26:53 Be sus
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 03:42:27 My friend's 2nd gen shredder bug does that
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 03:42:43 Beyond 700
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 03:42:49 Beyond 1k sps
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 03:42:57 Around 2k or so
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 03:43:06 It's a conv shrebber
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 03:43:19 Also features another tech I can't disclose
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 03:43:34 Search prototrode conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 04:18:51 "You may be the king, but I am God."
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 04:19:50 Can you record the whole thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 04:19:54 If possible
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 04:20:07 Like rockets that just aimbot?
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 04:20:30 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 04:22:59 Wait
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 04:23:03 Test it on a huge build
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 04:23:35 I don't think conveyor engines don't care about how big your build is
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 05:20:40 Ok you have a faster warship than even I have
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 05:21:11 I only cap at 30k sps (50k if I'm getting a little more risky)
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 05:21:34 YOU

Keeping pre-existing glitches

[Building]

Maybe in plane crazy 2 The glitches we have like conveyor/hover drive, motorlocking, and half piston cloaking could be re-coded in the rewrite as intentional glitches to not break builds.
bot-central 2021-08-20 08:01:14 Wow he

plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:32:15 Me who does not use motorlock:
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:33:03 (Seriously I find no purpose in it other than adding weight, adding more detail. and adding more super rockets in 1 area)
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:33:25 Not even a single build I have uses it
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:33:51 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:33:58 Also because of design flaws
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:34:12 Like blue and yellow ball not getting centered
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:34:54 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:35:23 Also how do pro aim in plane

plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:44:47 Well if I wanna get a 5k sps fighter jet which has an initial acceleration of 2k sps and can do a 360 in 0.5 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:44:54 I would need to incorporate motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:45:41 I also would need it to be far more superior than my gray space bumblebee
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:46:16 Oh alr
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:48:50 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-20 15:49:21 Ok I go remake my plane with wing engines

plane-crazy 2021-08-21 10:17:57 And it’s an endless cycle
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 10:18:33 That’s when the mods usually come online
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 10:18:43 Np
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 10:20:31 Also I think exposing yourself getting banned isn’t a very good idea
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 10:20:42 Cuz evading punishments can usually get you demolished
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 10:21:01 Oh

plane-crazy 2021-08-21 10:21:24 If you delete your message mods can’t see
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 10:21:36 You’re now eternally dead once mods see
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 10:21:59 You’re lucky if the mods don’t notice it

plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:07:25 Very powerful oxidizing agent
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:07:53 *Proceeds to get serious lung damage and ozone poisoning*
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:08:46 I wonder if on-board ozone generators could work as an afterburner without having to consume more fuel
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:09:51 Or maybe using futuristic technology harness the power of gravity to get out of the surface
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:10:07 Use conv drive
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:10:12 
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:10:21 Who knows
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:10:34 Perhaps it could be a plausible energy technique
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:10:50 Our scientific knowledge is still very limited
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:10:59 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:11:13 1 billion years from now*

plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:11:28 Or ye maybe 200 mil years from now
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:11:59 If some asteroid hits Earth/massive volcanic eruption or earthquake/humans being humans and destroying their environment
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:13:44 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:14:11 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:14:20 The
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:14:58 Well I mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:15:04 Oxygen concentrations in mars is really low
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 10:15:12 So lots of fuel required

plane-crazy 2021-08-23 03:39:55 No
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 03:40:00 Delete your shredders first

plane-crazy 2021-08-23 03:40:36 <@!273536574770380800> Come vc check this unde
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 03:40:54 BUT the very fact that you own shredders
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 03:41:03 No honor
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 03:41:48 "Inspiration"
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 03:42:03 There's a difference in modified build and an inspiration
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 03:42:40 An inspiration is building something with some elements copied from another build.

A modified build is a copied build with minor changes to the hull.
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 03:42:48 Now delete your shredders
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 03:43:12 Do you want me to lag every server you join

plane-crazy 2021-08-23 10:13:44 Since Filipino is basically English, the alphabet is rather similar
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 10:13:58 It's just that we have a different grammar system
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 10:14:04 And different slangs

plane-crazy 2021-08-23 16:58:16 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 00:51:26 Guys should there be a creation lock in pcc? So this is how it should work:

When 50% of a "locked" build is detected in plane crazy, the game prevents it from spawning in that plot, and a message saying: "Your aircraft has been deleted due to resembling a copy-locked build." This is to prevent copiers from copying builds (and even try to clamp down on shredder bugs.)
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 00:52:15 Also to make sure the game isn't flooded with requests to lock a build only builds from youtubers/builds with more than 1000 blocks can send a request to lock a build.
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 00:54:01 All requests must be mod reviewed for the first 2 months, after that it will be automated.
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 00:54:18 Yes I was gonna include a section on copylock whitelisting
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 00:54:48 Which is self explanatory: If you own the build, you can whitelist copiers.
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 00:55:26 I made this suggestion due to the political turmoil going on between gjsolo and voltify

plane-crazy 2021-08-24 01:39:19 When you played too much pokemon
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 01:51:05 No there are 2 main categories: bugs and balls
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 01:51:16 They are also divided to more categories
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 01:51:37 I knew someone's gonna do the sus
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 01:52:13 Perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 02:01:45 They deal ridiculous damage doe
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 02:02:02 Also they're way more superior than bugs if used by a competent player
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 02:03:12 I wonder why don't planes use an on-board liquid oxygen generator that can be injected into the engine in short bursts for more power
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 02:03:42 bru
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 03:31:12 There should be 3 kinda of maps
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 03:31:19 Small, large, and infinite
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 03:31:36 And maybe baseplate for low lag testing

plane-crazy 2021-08-24 06:40:51 ping
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 06:42:25 No need to build something new when you already got something effective
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 06:42:30 And original
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 11:40:43 Set your engine to F and R
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 12:14:40 "According to pcc's standards, that build is pretty garbage."

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 07:55:06 You could make kinetic transistors doe

plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:59:36 Cuz I'm spaceship

plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:30:32 No
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:30:38 It should be the other way around
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:31:09 If you blacklist someone you cannot attack them, that would definitely get rid of the random blacklisters
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:32:49 I do like shredders doe, they make the game less boring when everyone is just in weak spam cars
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:33:17 That's why it should be the other way around
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:33:31 When you blacklist someone, it makes the other person immortal
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:34:13 Imagine needing to blacklist cuz you can't kill the other person normally
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:34:32 It just
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:34:35 It just hhh
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:34:47 True
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:34:57 And shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:35:05 What if I say no
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:35:32 Its best to obtain a good build and wreck the shredders
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:35:43 You could also obtain good skill but that's optional
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:39:32 Put the center of mass low to the ground
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:39:40 Put ballast
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:43:42 SUSSUS 😳

plane-crazy 2021-09-01 05:37:03 Man
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 05:37:14 That doesn't seem very ergonomic
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 05:40:10 Ok internet back
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 08:27:35 Man I would be lagging the server to make him shut up and get out
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 08:28:01 As well as keep chasing him across the servers until he gives up using that shredder ball
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 08:28:47 Man he buf
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 08:28:55 You have rockets
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 08:29:01 And wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:47:26 No with severe lagginess
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:47:27 Man the lag again
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:47:27 Now*
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 10:47:49 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 12:10:10 Thrust vectored hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 12:10:54 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 12:11:24 OH wait you mean you lose a ton of speed when you turn
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 12:11:33 Actually that worsens it h
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 12:11:55 I thought like when you go faster you turn slower
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 12:12:10 HE
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 12:12:14 OMG REAL
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:10:47 Looks poggers
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:11:02 Why don't you want
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:11:05 You go very fast
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:32:53 No
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:33:45 Why don't you add no collision building where-in you can place more blocks in an existing block
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:33:48 In pc2
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:34:19 Yes but less part count
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:34:21 And less weight
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:34:25 Also less lag
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:34:30 From unnessecary motors
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:34:47 Helium makes your weight 0 but makes your mass double
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:35:12 HE SAID IT
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:35:24 HE SAID THE ECKS DEE
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:35:27 REAL
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:36:06 Same
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:36:26 This
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:36:52 You can't optimize roblox's own feature
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:36:55 I believe
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:39:03 No mans sky slowly got better after a couple updates
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:39:17 I would rather want early access in a seperate game than play the waiting game
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:39:54 Ski isu
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:40:05 But hey, at least you get access
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:40:40 Ah I see, how much would the early access cost
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:40:49 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:41:05 Hopefull it's at least 25 robux, I don't have that much robux anyways
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:41:25 Same
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:42:58 Maybe plane crazy 2 early access could cost only 25 robux to people who spent more than 100 robux in plane crazy 1 while people who didn't spend any cash would make it cost 125 or so to them
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:43:39 Man
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:43:57 Not everyone who spent cash for pc 1 has cash for pc 2
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:44:05 But if it has to be the same for everyone
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:44:10 At least make it 25 robus
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:44:22 Which I believe is the lower limit
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:44:49 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:45:12 Maybe there could be re-configurable pvp weapons?
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:45:30 Like guns could be Cannons, legacy, or laser weapons
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:45:56 Could then people would commit pvp spam
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:46:54 Imagine a 10 gun 6 cannon 12 rocket 2 lava spitter 4 firework abomination
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 17:11:28 I wonder how many people get banned everyday in that game for saying gay
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 18:01:00 Then rebuild
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 18:01:05 And learn from mistake
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 18:01:11 Always save your build
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 01:40:34 Man he
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:41:35 What's up with the emojis that are barely even used and why are they still here
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:41:37 tbh
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:42:22 Unde
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:42:38 HE
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:42:45 Underage
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:42:50 People below 13 years of age
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:43:04 h m
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:43:13 Ok I think you're in the transition period
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:43:31 Anyways you got a ton of downvotes cuz people didn't like it
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:43:46 People do not care if you spent 1 year, 1 decade, 1 century on that thing
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:43:58 If it looks trash to their standards then it's trash
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:44:09 Wait lemme go look for it
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:44:52 Idk tbh, let the pros in the server here tell you what you need to improve
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:45:19 Is it pvp capable doe
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:46:58 Then focus on making it more pvp capable
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:47:01 You won't regret it
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:47:44 There are a couple exceptions of that rule
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:47:48 Like me
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:48:13 I care more about function than form
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:48:53 Idk what's the point of using gold for tank armor when Iron or Titanium are better options
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:49:11 H e
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:51:11 I would've lagged him to assert dominance
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:51:22 Or actually no
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:51:26 That's too far for that situation
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:52:18 Just question every absurd statement he says
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:52:23 Like how are you paranoid
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:52:41 How does he know how you are a kid
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:52:51 The j
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:53:00 I finish plane on Friday
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:53:23 After that I construct MEeridian
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:53:35 AKA larger Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:53:48 Also so I could add motot 2 mouse control
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:54:25 Have you not heard of the recent events
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:54:27 Never say the word gay
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:54:42 Man
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:55:00 Part of it is because China
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:56:17 I'm starting to believe roblox is getting homophobic now
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 02:56:25 Its not an accident in the moderation system
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 05:25:19 Photoshop?
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 05:25:41 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 05:25:41 Oh

plane-crazy 2021-09-02 06:42:25 Be pro
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 06:42:36 Also use prototrode's conv engines
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:07:25 <@!715871356138291301> I have one advice for you: Just cope
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:07:39 Don't complain, you'll get deeper into the "trolled" side
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:08:16 j

plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:13:20 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:13:30 But motorism shall be the dominant religion in this block game
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:14:06 Sadge
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:22:40 <@!836288007812284486> I suggest you leave this server before you get banned
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:22:57 Because once you get banned you would have a long process of appealing
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:23:36 Not yet
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:23:50 Wait until he comes back in 30 minutes
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:24:09 If he doesn't come back by then he gets banned
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:25:06 Not if you're a masochist
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:25:10 It's ridiculously long
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:25:47 Also all ToS have one thing in common: don't be a garbage person
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:26:29 Ima get him banned in all the mutual servers I'm in with
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:34:28 I got the unde banned from dragonplatinum's discord, now to deal with him in the roblox main discord
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:34:55 Oh ye, you guys could also try to help me and check mututal servers, then get him banned there
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:35:04 I only have 2 as of the moment, there could be more
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:35:08 
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 09:35:12 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:19:54 I see a drone lieutenant from tsarscape
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:20:24 Alternate reality when I actually gain expert rank
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:20:51 Realities merge
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:20:53 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:21:28 When I make plane/when I finish my Meridian which is supposed to have anti-fighter capabilities
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:21:44 And overall more superior than the current fard ship I have
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:22:34 Dies in 1 shot if not careful
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:24:48 Oh ye not to mention it cannot murder fighters at all/kill moving shredders, oh ye also it can’t dogfight at maximum sps
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:25:30 he
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:26:55 No
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:27:02 I don’t want to use my voice
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:27:04 It tiring
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:27:40 Missiles have proven themselves to be superior due to tracking
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:28:11 And makes you require less effort in aiming
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:30:11 True
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:34:50 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:35:41 Shredder bug but wasd
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:35:47 And obnoxiously long
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:36:03 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:42:09 What you guys can speedrun planes?
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:42:29 What kind of witchcraft is this
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:42:58 Dream wouldn't be able to win a plane crazy build speedrun
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:43:05 He does not know how plane crazy works
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:43:47 Well then, it wasn't funny anyways
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:43:58 -A person who laughs at amogus memes
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:44:28 No one asked for your joke either
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:44:33 So we're equal
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:44:49 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:45:19 I'm not in memeing mood rn so I guess that could explain it
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:50:17 Nope, I also don't know why
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:51:21 (Also I'm lazy in school and don't really put effort in various subjects so yeah)
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:53:11 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 11:53:33 Procrastination until the final hour
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 12:34:56 trol
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 23:55:37 The White and blue thing in background
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 23:56:16 Basically the most powerful drone corvette (and is still weak <:pain:644301805534183464>)
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 00:14:16 Racism
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 00:35:55 When the
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:08:44 The sad truth of reality is that the smarter you are, the more you can experience suffering. So of course idiots experience no suffering
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:08:57 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:08:59 Wait no
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:09:22 Show
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:09:49 I wanna see it firing
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:09:53 At least like a screenshot
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:10:25 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:10:25 Your unde brain is glitching again
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:12:21 Anyways so far the coloring does suck, like it's basically just a stripe of black and teal. Maybe just use 1 color unless you plan to add detail
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:12:33 Like dark blue or smth
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:12:49 Talking about detail, eh not the best
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:13:00 Though you can redeem it by adding function to it
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:13:13 Putting detail is hard anyways
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:13:21 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:13:30 No form of hover thrusters allowed
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:13:32 Even 1
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:13:35 even 0.5
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:13:40 Must be 0 hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:14:07 Fard
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:14:24 I use super rockets, hover thrusters, and conv engines
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:14:30 All 3 of them
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 01:16:05 Meanwhile my non-functional plane

plane-crazy 2021-09-03 09:16:33 To the point I have to literally chase and lag them until they either stop using shredders or quit the game

plane-crazy 2021-09-04 02:50:22 That's a fancy looking kite compared to the ones in my village playground
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:16:56 Tbh I wanna question why do you wanna build land cruisers
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:17:01 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:17:12 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:24:03 Man, the flags have a difference
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:24:05 They're not similar
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:24:09 Russia has the blue in the middle
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:24:49 Also you're like one of the few people here who I assume use their real face in their pfp
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:24:55 <@!401530469952389130> h
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:25:49 ~~Ok now lemme dox you~~
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:26:15 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:27:19 Pog
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:28:32 I got bored in making the Meridian and I need to make it, my current spaceship is overused
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:28:44 And outdated
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:28:54 Pro
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:29:23 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:45:29 memory
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:46:31 Back when USSR memes were rampant
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 04:49:33 Why even rely on full build tutorials in the first place
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 04:54:28 Also I wanna question if me replying to a message you sent back in september 2020 made you active again in this chat
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 04:54:43 Or was it a different reason?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 04:54:50 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 04:55:27 Ah I see
general 2021-09-04 04:58:50 What's that build
general 2021-09-04 04:58:55 What are you making
general 2021-09-04 05:00:37 You forgot to bury your nose as well, so you won't die a quicker death from suffocation, you'll die from either dehydration of starvation
general 2021-09-04 05:00:38 Now suffer
general 2021-09-04 05:01:12 Wow you
general 2021-09-04 05:02:38 Sad

general 2021-09-04 05:44:46 How do I learn roblos lua
general 2021-09-04 05:44:52 I want to big brain
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:59:27 Should I let this shredder go or hunt him down
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 05:59:55 Already did
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:00:03 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:00:42 Nvm shredder dude either stopping using it or went to another server
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:01:25 I've been doing that for a long time now, it's time I take a slightly more pacifist stance
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:01:40 But still aggressive on shredders
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:01:53 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:03:02 Because yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:04:17 Man internet fard
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:04:29 i can't shoot the shredder cuz fard internet <:nooo:787097964946259978>

plane-crazy 2021-09-04 11:40:45 Spacebote
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 11:41:44 I'm seeing more spaceships recently
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 11:41:54 Mostly star wars ships
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 11:49:12 Ghalle Garmillon
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 11:52:33 My faction is filled with those kinds of stuff
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 11:53:03 
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 11:53:39 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 11:53:50 you
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 12:03:46 Skil isue
the-dump 2021-09-04 12:05:59 su
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 12:16:03 Cobra except you can turn around
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 12:16:05 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 12:16:28 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 12:55:48 Man he
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 12:58:16 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 12:59:44 white/purple light
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:42:54 Angle lock
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:43:31 They can jam a ton of super rockets in small spaces
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:43:44 Motorlocking with angles
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 15:44:01 But its main purpose is for detailing
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:14:00 M a g n e t
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:14:22 and longer barrel which would make the explosive have higher accuracy
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:15:05 2nd of all, use ice
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:15:19 it would reduce the weight of said barrel and therefore reduce wobble
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:15:30 Use light materials as well
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 16:15:36 Like half beams instead of full beams
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 05:31:22 Made this basically a very unstable Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 05:31:32 WIth no conv drive yet
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 05:31:53 OMG (NOT CLICKBAIT)
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 05:32:41 hi
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 05:32:55 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 05:35:39 Ok back

plane-crazy 2021-09-05 05:36:52 Left on WIP
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 05:37:07 Cuz I'm fixing faction leader's fard spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 05:37:11 In terms of functionality
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 05:37:35 Attempt HoF now, but don't set a deadline
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 05:38:24 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 06:18:40 Man he
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 06:29:10 Me when conv drive
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 06:29:53 What are its capabilities
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 06:30:19 Cuz it would be wrong to name a ship Conqueror if it can't even kill anything
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 06:34:11 Perhaps Sokudo would work, Japanese for speed
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 06:34:52 Sokudo class corvette
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 06:34:54 idk

plane-crazy 2021-09-05 15:48:55 <@!665408211582582795> Man you
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 15:50:06 I mean sure it has fancy specs and could be an engineering marvel but if it looks fard then its fard
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 15:50:10 That's how creations works
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 15:50:14 You cannot change that
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 15:50:38 Or rather you can't change that fact within 1 day
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 15:51:24 It is possible to change how creations works but it would take a ton of effort
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 04:00:44 
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 04:00:59 np
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 04:01:27 Highest non-glitch sps I could achieve is 300k sps
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 04:01:29 Using conv
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 04:01:51 Its a glitch, when I made like some sort of hurricane
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 04:02:45 By non-glitch I mean high speed *intentional* acceleration
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 04:03:06 While glitched are unintentional accelerations like during rope storms and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 04:03:13 You can't control where you wanna head to
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 04:07:47 You haven't seen yet
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 04:07:57 40k block builds
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 04:08:10 Doesn't mean his builds aren't cool
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 04:08:22 aren't
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 04:08:38 are'arent'
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 04:09:25 The bot has gained sentience

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 04:26:01 What
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 04:26:19 Looks poggers in my opinion
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 04:26:40 Coming from an untrained motorlockist
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 04:27:14 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:00:51 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:18:34 Welcome to your very own universe
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:18:56 You
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:19:09 Sure
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:19:32 Ye, I plan to add a missile bay on a future starscape-based carrier
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:19:37 I do on Friday
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:20:07 Sadge
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:20:36 Wait is that wasd missile
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:20:39 Or mouse control
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:21:09 Ah I see
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:21:31 This won't matter if I spam a bunch of them, at least 1 missile would instantly incapacitate an enemy
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:22:00 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:22:26 ~~Ikfin~~
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:22:35 ~~And maybe my conv spaceship~~
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:22:53 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:23:36 Wait what if I make a missile which is guided at first but later on you can shut down the motor 2s in it
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:23:45 Effectively making it resistant to flares
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:24:10 Why not
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:24:53 What if you use super rocket
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:24:58 Instead of huge prop
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:25:20 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:25:54 Ah I see
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:26:10 Why not use motor though, are huge propellers more effective?
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:26:25 Or ykw I think it has the benefit of providing its own thrust
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:26:30 Motor doesn't do anything
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:26:41 Hi Gammarad
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:29:08 Pro
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:29:29 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:29:43 Imagine raging to a missile
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:30:01 When you can just avoid it if you have enough engineering skills
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:30:37 Anti tank rounds
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:30:41 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:31:40 Sadge
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:31:49 Ima go mount that in my Horizon on Friday
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:32:02 To test its capability on flying builds
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 05:32:37 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 07:45:26 Now that you have macro, make Ikfin gun
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 07:45:45 Is motor locked
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 07:45:58 Idk h
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 07:48:10 Skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 07:48:24 Imagine needing angle locc

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 09:20:36 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 09:20:51 I would question the dude why should I stop
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 09:21:26 Or ykw I wouldn't at all and would just stop h
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 09:21:46 I'm tryna take a more pacifist stance rather than surface destroyer
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 09:22:02 And occassional shrebber obliterator
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 09:50:40 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 09:51:14 If you didn't hit your target, it means you didn't fire enough rockets
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 09:52:19 h

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 10:49:31 Never needed it anyways
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 10:52:56 Expert designer
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 10:53:03 Maybe HoF as well
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 10:53:35 That is if you make the interior basically something from blender or smth
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 10:54:09 Yep,
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 10:54:14 But it wasn't complete doe
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 10:54:17 Last time I saw it

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 10:55:02 is there any way I can improve my current keybind set
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 11:01:28 Why not put the pitching rockets on the back
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 11:02:40 Oh nvm, I thought you use those rockets to control pitch
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 11:02:55 The ones in the propellers

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 11:45:45 Ok so i think its just because of unde's inability to accept defeat
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 11:46:15 They were expecting to win and dominate the battlefield, but were greeted with the polar opposite result
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 11:46:51 And so they try to assert dominance through chat

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 11:48:43 Man you actually read the message
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 11:49:08 Well anyways I did some more research anyways so yea
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 11:49:36 With enough intensity in short intervals doe
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 11:49:49 If such tech could be avaibale

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 11:54:35 I hide under radar
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 11:54:52 ~~Definitely didn't delete the messages with reactions~~
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 11:55:35 Well at least you can't put your own reactions
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 11:55:39 
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 11:56:03 Downscaled image boy
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 11:56:21 I have no clue

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 14:29:43 How is it a noob website
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 14:29:59 I mean personally I don't use sketchfab but
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 14:30:44 Even the best builders in the game use that website
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 14:31:04 Not to mention how you got the definition of noob wrong
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 14:31:16 So it isn't a noob website
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 14:31:27 Got any other valid arguments?
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 14:31:48 I go fight friday

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 14:40:30 I made mirage using image but it fard cuz lack of motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 14:40:49 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 14:40:52 Same
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 14:40:58 I have never used a 3d model ever

plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:35:12 Just chat like pro
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:35:28 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:42:07 I haven't seen the ">:(" in a while
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:42:54 You are sad
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:44:02 Its to appease the undes
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:44:27 RIP my builds
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:44:42 I'm gonna have to take a long time to optimize and refit my builds for pc2
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:45:12 Why f3x <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:45:37 Yes but it's gonna be annoying now
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:45:46 You're gonna have to deal with miniscule values
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:45:53 0.01, 0.02 parts
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:46:10 Though I guess you could have both
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:46:28 Voxel building grid and then f3x if you're feeling pro enough
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:47:24 BABFT building is fine, at least you can snap parts into a grid
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:47:27 But F3x
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:47:29 man
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:47:43 You're gonna have to suffer asymmetry
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:48:11 Why not
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:48:16 having more building options is nice
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:49:02 Wdym miss a challenge
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:49:09 Blender in itself is already a challenge]
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:49:41 Then make rickje add no collision building
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:50:13 Learning part is, something I still yet to learn
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:50:17 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:50:22 National IQ of the Philippines is 86
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:50:33 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:51:25 At least make the weight of motors half of their original weight when locked
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:53:23 But I agree motorlock should be kept
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:53:32 Adds an engineering aspect to plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:54:03 Like the same way how I refuse to download mods and use vanilla redstone mechanics because of said engineering aspect
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:55:00 Imagine if Rickje and his dev army makes a 3d modelling software game
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:55:52 Guns are already laser weapons
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:56:22 I mean who said guns had a gender
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:56:28 
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:58:10 ye Ik, like starscape beams right?
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:58:45 If aimed properly, would be the ultimate anti-air weaponry
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:58:54 Thing is spammed builds are a problem
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:59:15 So I think
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:59:35 Rick should add something called customixable guns
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:59:45 Which means you can customize guns to your desire
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 15:59:58 Cannons, legacy, and beams
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:00:16 Rockets could be torpedos, guided (but fard) missiles, and legacy
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:01:24 I think beams should be significantly weaker
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:01:35 1/5th the damage a gun can do
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:02:03 But can reach absurd ranges and travel almost instantly, at 2k sps/sec
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:02:25 Do you want to lag the game
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:02:35 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:02:50 just turn on shadow map, and all those stuff
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:02:55 Man I don't have rtx
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:03:33 No I meant the ray tracing part
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:04:03 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:04:13 What
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:05:03 or like the image above, slowly powers down to 0%
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:05:28 Starts with gun damage but drops to 0% power in 10 seconds. lower the percentage, the less damage.
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:05:31 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:06:07 Though I guess with mods you can do that
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:06:21 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_tfKewwWKg&ab_channel=Prototrode
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:06:24 Look at this
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:06:35 (watch video to see lighting)
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:06:48 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:07:15 I think the reason he hasn't changed lighting is due to the daylight cycle and ambient change thing
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:07:55 yes but then like it would automatically be changed again by current ambient changing script and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:08:11 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:09:01 I said the ambient
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:09:11 And yes time
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:09:20 Even if you change it in roblos studio
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:09:50 It gets updated by the script, basically just ignoring the change
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:10:01 And so it would be like nothing changed at all
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:10:20 he
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:10:42 you know the ambient color darkens when it's night
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:10:53 Yes that
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:11:09 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:11:32 But it's constantly refreshing
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:12:07 even if you change it to like 1000, 1000, 1000, it would still revert to whatever the current ambient lighting it's supposed to be at
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:12:27 It seems like we do not understand each other so let's just stop
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:12:41 game is hardcoded though
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:12:46 wait until re-write
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:13:37 I see
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:14:06 Why not atmospheric density instead
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:14:16 ye
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:14:55 Vietnamese cooked dog
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:15:09 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:15:50 I'd rather want to be able to type in and exactly change the value
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:16:18 Or maybe that could be for a future "advanced ambient controls" gamepass
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:16:38 Graphics fard doe
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:16:46 ~~Yes~~
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:17:41 Imagine flame crazy build importing doe
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:17:53 Though that would seriously bump up shredder instances
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:18:21 Instead of 1 shredder every server, you get 5-7-9 shredders every server
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:18:47 Levers are useless
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:18:50 Keybinds pro
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:19:03 Perhaps a complexified keybind system could work?
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:19:38 basically logic gate keybinds, maybe even delays and loop toggle
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:19:49 And maybe seat whitelisting
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:20:24 Try not to suffer
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:20:27 challenge
plane-crazy 2021-09-06 16:20:30 (impossible)
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 00:20:12 Puri is poob

plane-crazy 2021-09-07 02:08:39 Engine is pretty nice and round enough, the hull is fine as well
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 02:09:06 Though I guess you can make the shape more unique
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 02:11:09 Pro
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 02:11:36 Make sandwitch <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 02:17:04 Tried looking for images of that, seems like there are none
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 02:17:20 You could add one though
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 02:17:32 Like some sort of Sea vampire 2nd gen thing
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 02:17:45 Unless you're aiming to be realistic and not put fancy stuff

plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:23:10 Why should I do it
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:25:47 Ima commit 2nd turret change, anyone have turret design with deadly accurate aim?
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:25:59 Fard
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:26:28 UTC+8 gang where
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:26:53 Welcome to asia
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:27:20 Pro

plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:27:34 He said the exks dee
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:28:18 Man anyone have turret design I need to change turrets again
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:28:27 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:29:21 He
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:29:28 Mine is rather small, made for pvp
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:31:36 
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:32:04 The right turret is the one I use, has a low amount of weight and pop resistant
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:32:13 Pro
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:32:23 Best turret I know for pvp
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:33:00 It’s one time use
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:33:22 Still, once that finishes up, it’s gone
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:34:16 Not to mention a turret with a magazine is gonna be too big for my spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:34:25 Bridge I guess
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:35:34 Man that’s a cool looking boat tbh
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:35:43 Anyways I guess it’s still a cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:36:07 Yamato doesn’t want to be battleship anymore, it wants to be small bote
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:37:21 Interesting
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:38:30 Same
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:39:09 
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:39:46 Mass extermination of fishes
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:41:01 Basically an Ion engine but water
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:42:28 Sounds similar, ion engines accelerate ions, this one accelerates water
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:42:33 Both uses electricity
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:42:46 They can but they’re not very powerful engines
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:43:00 Which is why there are no ion planes yet
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:43:20 They have absurd speed doe
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:43:51 No, propellers are slow
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:44:01 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:44:06 But I guess
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:46:25 Yamato 1
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:46:28 And make it fly
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:46:30 For funi
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:46:45 (Seriously it looks like a spaceship)
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:46:58 You can go learn yourself
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:47:12 Yes just use normal hover thrustber
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:48:01 If you’re like me, combine helium, ballasts, and wings
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:48:08 For auto roll and high stability
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:48:31 Also use thrust vectored hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:49:05 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 10:50:07 Me

plane-crazy 2021-09-07 17:16:00 Ah, basically normal pistons but they cannot be retracted from external forces
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 17:16:19 Good for fitting stuff in places they aren’t supposed to be in

plane-crazy 2021-09-07 17:52:50 Small builds
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 17:53:01 So you can get the hang of building techniques and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-09-07 17:53:15 Literally anything small

plane-crazy 2021-09-10 01:48:35 Eh that's decent enough
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 01:48:43 But pretty trash looking at pcc standards POV
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 01:56:44 Adobe premiere pro free trial
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 01:56:50 Just keep making new alts
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:15:03 People were experimenting with it
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:15:08 or rather someone
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:15:21 That dude found out how locked motors actually pull blocks in by half
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:16:08 So he began experimenting a design to abuse this glitch to its fullest, to be able to squish blocks
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:16:20 POV: You wapred too fast and anchored
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:16:39 Around the 2nd half of 2020

plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:20:46 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:20:50 People wouldn't want that
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:20:57 There's motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:21:19 And if you say that it would eliminate the need for too much blocks
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:21:24 Still no
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:21:41 It would remove the engineering aspect of this game
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:22:12 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:22:21 I said it would remove the engineering aspect
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:22:26 Ah
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:22:27 I see
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:22:56 I was thinking of no-collision building where-in you can build more blocks inside a block
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:24:46 Last time I played it was when I finally got to test my plane in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:25:08 Build a boat should be more realistic
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:25:17 Like seriously, egg gun?
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:25:18 Man
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:25:45 Aka plane crazy has an engineering aspect
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:26:11 Build a boat and other games are just "place a few blocks and we'll do the mechanisms for you"
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:26:26 I wanna do mince raft and make the mechanisms myself
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:26:44 German engineering*
plane-crazy 2021-09-10 02:27:26 not to mention the pay to win nature of the game

plane-crazy 2021-09-11 16:00:58 There's a huge difference between "You are failed English" and "You failed English" despite only adding 1 word to the sentence

plane-crazy 2021-09-11 16:21:46 It has, they're trying to re-create the chaos during 9/11 digitally
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 16:24:08 <@!335599526414909451> Could you close verification for like a while
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 16:24:24 I guess that could stop raids for a brief period
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 16:24:38 Raiders
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 16:25:10 Skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 16:25:14 I like getting pinged
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 16:31:10 (real)
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 16:33:18 If you were pinged by another person a while ago there was a raid
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 16:36:09 Blacklist them, though you would have major skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 16:36:32 Blacklisting is annoying for everyone
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 16:36:56 How would that stop them

plane-crazy 2021-09-14 10:25:01 Then just darken/lighten the color values
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 10:25:07 No
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 10:25:10 use color picker
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 10:25:14 Then modify it
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 10:25:19 So you're closer to the real value
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 10:29:24 Aight, just make it darker now
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 10:29:44 I suppose a 10 color value reduction should do the trick
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 10:31:53 slightly raise the values of blue propeller now
plane-crazy 2021-09-14 10:32:00 Oh ye and darken the yellow

plane-crazy 2021-09-15 10:22:43 The first flyable spaceship took me 2 weeks to get it moving
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 10:22:51 After figuring out how to make the mechanisms
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 10:23:18 Anyways for small spaceships I suggest using no speed max drag hovers
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 10:23:24 You are not bothering
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 10:23:30 It fine
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 10:23:47 
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 10:24:04 Use internal propellers then
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 10:24:17 Like insde the spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 10:25:02 Helium
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 10:25:10 And no speed max drag hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 10:25:22 For larger spaceships use wings
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 10:25:28 Controllability
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 10:25:54 Wouldn't be nice to be piloting an ice block right

plane-crazy 2021-09-15 14:48:16 I’m tryna look for someone who’s good at motorlock optimizing
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 14:48:55 Would be unpro to have a plane heavier than a spaceship

plane-crazy 2021-09-15 15:04:41 At least I lost motivation to make a flying spacebote because I realized it would have uncontrollable pitching and trash yaw
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 15:04:59 Vertically symmetrical warships better in stability

plane-crazy 2021-09-15 15:08:53 Unless there’s an extension for that
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 15:10:08 I think a very simple build represents plane crazy more
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 15:10:24 Or a complex custom build
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 15:12:18 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 15:12:24 I agree
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 15:13:13 Yep, like builds with effort but not too HoF worthy as it would discourage possible new players in how they suck
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 15:13:35 Just shows what you can do in that game
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 15:13:55 Just keep experimenting
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 15:14:02 You’ll get there soon
plane-crazy 2021-09-15 15:14:19 I could also agree

plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:45:09 
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:45:11 More smooth
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:45:16 I see smooth curve
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:45:48 Compare it to this
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:46:21 This is like starscape spaceship, mostly wedge no curv

plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:52:27 (SUS)
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:53:21 You mentioned plane crazy in there
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:53:22 fail
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:53:51 pcc is an accronym for plane crazy community

plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:53:59 Tru
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:54:57 I make spaceships capable of pvp and obliterate noobs with it in pvp mode
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:55:04 sadge
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:55:28 (real)
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:58:12 At the cost of your life
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:58:19 So nobody gains anything
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:58:33 True
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 02:59:50 Nah its morning
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:00:13 I give you 1 task: Make me a vertically symmetrical warship hull
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:00:18 idk
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:00:18 I guess
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:00:36 Its a spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:00:44 oh
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:00:58 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:01:01 That's Seyo's
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:01:05 I found it in uncf discord
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:02:11 I also make
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:02:14 Cosmo falcon
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:02:17 I make it Ikfin jet
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:02:23 I just need to learn motorlocking because it hard
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:03:05 No like a method of "optimized mototlocking"
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:03:13 Which uses the least amount of motorlocks as possible
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:03:25 Wouldn't be poggers if a plane is heavier than a spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:04:16 <:Upvote:490311647492309004>
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:04:41 Also look at this now
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:04:42 
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:05:17 My first attempts at a plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:05:38 This is my best looking plane which isn't good at all
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:05:51 Also can't fly
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:06:07 Run
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:06:08 GEt out
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:06:12 Leave the server there
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:06:25 Before something terrible happens, could even be total data wipe
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:07:01 I'm not even a good plane builder anyways
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:07:33 Pvp spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:08:09 According to GASF, this is a "GIga warp conv spam space shit"
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:08:33 You
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:08:44 If they're not dimensional subs no
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:09:17 Wouldn't be very fun if everyone keeps warping around right
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:09:47 But I did put one for my illegal spaceship variant
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:11:59 Why are they so slow
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:12:21 Even a 1.4k block build can go 1.6k sps, 6k if it wants to
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:12:48 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:13:14 1.6k sps max
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:13:15 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:13:20 Otherwise I would have to spam
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:13:21 a ton
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:13:23 of times
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:13:56 Nah, I'm gonna use a more efficient method called conv engines instead of lagging myself
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:14:07 Why plane unstable in first place
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:15:32 I mean, can I see plane h
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:15:37 I wanna see what wrong
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:15:39 And maybe video
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:49:10 Hi
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:50:04 So so basically conv drive turns the bottom block into a powerful engine
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:50:07 That's all
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:50:14 That's how it works
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:50:27 if it pitches up then maybe add some weight
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:56:32 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:56:56 I just learned how to actually kill shredder bugs the easy way
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:56:59 Today
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:57:19 Thx, it pvp spaceship if you wanna 1v1 or smth
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 03:58:09 How do I do optimized motorlocking aa
the-dump 2021-09-18 07:01:49 He smelled the oil
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:07:21 Finished optimizing the hull
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:07:27 Gonna put the mechanisms and stuff now
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:08:35 (Older version)
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:24:37 Super rockets
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:24:44 And thrust vectored hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:24:58 Wings for controllability
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:25:04 No
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:25:13 You gotta have a light hull as well so you don't spam blocks
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:25:36 yep
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:25:39 Use rockets
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:25:57 and combine it by using hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:26:04 High acceleration combined with high speed
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:26:16 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:26:40 OH GOLLY THIS IS SO LIGHT
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:27:13 3 super rockets that controls a certain direction
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:27:17 It spins really fast
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:27:28 500 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:27:33 doe
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:27:43 real
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:37:54 Blacklist bypass?
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 07:44:05 What
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 15:49:38 400k sps car
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 15:49:50 Faster than Horizon and my WIP drone battleship refit
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 15:50:24 Because yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 16:54:01 Oh so it's pixy's
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 16:54:02 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 16:54:10 Drone battleship
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 16:54:33 Now midway into construction
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 16:55:48 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 16:56:46 #creations deleted <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 16:57:02 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 16:57:19 But should I post drone battleship in creations
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 16:58:09 Still WIP but looks are otherwise finished
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 16:58:38 I just need to make it as OP as Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 16:58:48 and possibly even more OP, is so light
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 17:01:08 h
creations-chat 2021-09-18 17:16:54 Drone battleship refit, its gonna incorporate Horizon tech and motor 2 mouse control
creations-chat 2021-09-18 17:20:53 Ok here, hull is dark anyways
plane-crazy 2021-09-18 17:22:26 Cool
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 06:27:27 <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 06:28:24 What build
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 06:33:48 I mean cream has multiple meanings
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 06:34:21 One is something added to food for flavor
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 06:34:23 And the other
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 06:34:29 Is for the mass production of babies
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 06:36:35 Real
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 08:56:58 Good to see you today, Bushnoises
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 08:57:38 Added 3 modified prototrode conv engines
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 08:58:12 Because yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 08:58:46 Also my faction has been raided by GASF
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 08:58:48 Sooo
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 08:59:06 Destroyer's faction
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 08:59:16 Basically another Ikfin
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 08:59:30 But less pro
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 09:00:27 Man the way the conv engines are places looks really cool in my opinion (yes an opinion)

plane-crazy 2021-09-20 00:31:09 Interesting mechanism
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 02:56:02 Is the red name a submarine
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 02:56:09 Why are all red names so fard doe
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 02:56:45 
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 02:56:46 
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 02:56:48 
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 02:56:50 
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 02:57:03 All the red names I have ever seen so far are absolute undes
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 03:33:14 Nah
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 03:33:25 Shredders are too hard to catch
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 03:33:31 use turret build and go 600 sps to kite them
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 03:33:41 Then send a bunch of missiles
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 04:20:27 I don't know
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 04:20:29 There are none
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 04:20:44 Actually ye
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 04:20:47 Also more childish
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 04:20:57 Like why is there even a candy jetpack
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 04:21:09 Or snow turbine
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:09:46 Bru
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:10:34 I would like a version of build a boat with a target audience of all ages
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:10:42 Much like what plane crazy is rn
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:55:03 I want another reason other than variable thrust
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 05:55:59 The only other reason I use hover thrusters are the ability to thrust vector them and more stable
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 06:34:47 No context Vesteria momen
the-dump 2021-09-20 07:37:45 
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 07:46:50 Modifying is different than creating your own design
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 07:56:44 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 07:57:03 Capybara (not clickbait)

plane-crazy 2021-09-20 12:13:38 Hm
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 12:13:50 The best way I can put this into words is that that is an illusion
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 12:14:27 Alr
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 12:14:32 Ask rickje then

general 2021-09-20 12:18:51 I mean you have a point
general 2021-09-20 12:19:22 I see some uses in some of the school lessons but its not like you're gonna be using it anytime soon
general 2021-09-20 12:20:10 School needs to be reformed
general 2021-09-20 12:20:14 But not die
general 2021-09-20 12:21:19 Change existing systems in how they teach students, daily routines, probably make the system more flexible
general 2021-09-20 12:21:20 idk
general 2021-09-20 12:21:32 Sneak a bomb in
general 2021-09-20 12:21:35 Explode it
general 2021-09-20 12:21:39 Boom school die
general 2021-09-20 12:22:00 He wanted to kill the building
general 2021-09-20 12:22:10 SOoooo
general 2021-09-20 12:23:06 Why can't we all just adopt English or something simpler than English <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2021-09-20 12:23:18 Would remove the language barrier
general 2021-09-20 12:23:34 Faster communication, probably minor increae in scientific advancement
general 2021-09-20 12:23:54 How so
general 2021-09-20 12:24:01 I mean sure you are born with it but
general 2021-09-20 12:24:05 There are other reasons
general 2021-09-20 12:24:09 Yep that's one
general 2021-09-20 12:24:18 True
general 2021-09-20 12:24:46 Sad

general 2021-09-20 12:26:00 My f4 can close the program
general 2021-09-20 12:26:13 *Laugh now, it is required*
general 2021-09-20 12:26:52 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 13:24:27 Ok, make me an OP warship in a seperate account
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 13:24:39 Do
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 13:25:26 As for the reason why, I do not know. But at least we get to keep said warship as well
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 15:09:03 Air
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 17:21:54 Did you anchor
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 17:37:45 Pistons for hover drive is poopoo
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 17:37:50 Use motors
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 17:38:21 You won’t regret it
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 17:38:42 Also motorlocking is mainly for builder tryhards soooo
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:14:54 Caf tish
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:41:28 Pcc bias

general 2021-09-21 04:39:24 Would existing glitches in pc1 stay
general 2021-09-21 04:39:32 Like the beneficial glitches like hover drives and conv engine
general 2021-09-21 04:39:34 And cloaking
general 2021-09-21 04:39:53 I don't use motorlocks but I don't want them gone
general 2021-09-21 04:40:02 But idk if rick would patch stuff like conv engines and cloaking

plane-crazy 2021-09-22 03:46:32 After pondering for a while, ye I think this community should get more lenient and laid back
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 03:48:06 So would you like an extremely buggy and featureless game now?
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 03:48:15 Or would you wait for the final product
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 03:48:35 You can't just speed up time, technology isn't advanced enough to do that yet
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 03:49:00 Same
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 03:49:10 But I wish they keep some of the existing bugs like conv drive
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 03:49:40 I wanna keep flexing "technological superiority"

the-dump 2021-09-22 10:57:32 Or madattak
the-dump 2021-09-22 10:57:44 The point of the game is to just build, that’s all

the-dump 2021-09-22 10:57:58 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:09:36 What is that
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:13:04 You see Ivan, if enemy isn’t hit, it means you haven’t used enough rockets
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:16:45 That’s true with one of our faction’s build
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:17:06 It’s so durable, you need more than 10 max rocket salvos and 2 people to destroy it
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:17:11 And the thing is that it flies
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:20:01 He pvp

plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:24:49 As well as making the gray tiles darker
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:27:02 Ft: Plane crazy community
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:31:57 Not to mention the cring music
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:32:24 Ultra hardcore music for that kind of build
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:33:09 Because its a unique idea
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:33:47 Its rare to find catapults anyways
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:34:28 Ah yes, looks over function
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:34:29 h
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:34:43 Either way I both support and oppose the build
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:35:02 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:35:32 Must have 100000000 motorlock and must NOT have a single exposed motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:36:05 Ima return to neutral side
plane-crazy 2021-09-22 11:36:17 It fun staying neutral

plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:39:00 Why not
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:39:19 Perhaps roblox would add a volume limiter
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:39:30 If your audio is too loud for 10 seconds you get kicked
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:40:09 But I guess some hackers would find a way to abuse said feature and kick everyone they don't like

general 2021-09-23 02:35:48 Most of them are test games, kids exploring roblox studio, small builds, etc.

plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:35:11 I disagree
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:35:50 Perhaps there could be seperate gamemodes
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:36:20 Realistic gamemode which disables 100839282892014g turns and most glitches
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:36:28 And better physics engine
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:36:58 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:37:19 Realistic gamemode only favors the builder tryhards which use 1000 motorlocks and angle locks
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:37:59 Its just a bad build
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:38:03 Why do you need to call a mod
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:40:36 There are no rules stating you can't edit your image

plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:44:18 He helps madattak build games
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:44:25 While madattak deals with the scripting and some building
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:53:40 Well you see, it also affects the people who wanna build fictional builds which realistically cannot fly
plane-crazy 2021-09-25 12:54:00 Like my friend's Space Battleship Yamato

plane-crazy 2021-09-29 09:18:56 For coolness
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 09:19:30 Pcc exploiter enjoyers are more fun than other exploiter fans
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 09:19:43 Also making exploits require skil
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 09:19:56 Other than unpro copy script users

plane-crazy 2021-09-30 03:56:03 <@!668994983067385898> I disagree
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 03:56:31 The old combat system should also be kept tbh
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 03:56:42 Cuz fictional builds wouldn't work
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 03:56:57 No
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 03:57:21 The part where wing panels break
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 03:57:58 You can just remove cutters
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 03:58:03 Or cutter pvp toggle
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 03:58:06 Quick fix
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 03:58:31 Why not
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 03:58:52 Since cutters are a shredder bug's main weapon
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 03:59:12 Ye I forgot cutters are used for details
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 03:59:38 But again with a cutter damage toggle
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:00:01 You can make it if you can get damaged by cutters or not, so shredder bugs can be useless
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:00:33 Anyways
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:00:52 Hi Gam maG

plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:06:05 pro
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:06:33 Btw do you now have a vertically symmetrical warship idea
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:06:49 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:06:58 Hi tranquilGaze
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:07:06 Very pro
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:07:30 Can I do the see
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:07:50 a
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:07:51 Alr
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:08:20 Perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:08:33 Btw do you agree on adding shield generators
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:11:49 a
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:11:51 I meant like
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:12:18 A normal warship
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:12:19 But like
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:12:26 Has same side on top and bottom
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:12:59 I continue type
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:13:48 Also for the reason why, they're proven to be more stable than any other warship
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:14:03 As proven in the Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:14:39 Like I can yaw without unnessecary rolling, and I don't have unnessecary pitching
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:14:59 I suppose normal and same on both sides
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:22:02 You get 1 2x2 shield generator
It makes the ship invincible until shield points reaches zero (shield points is equal to 37% of total block count)
Once shield breaks it needs 1 minute to recharge
rockets deal 10 damage, fireworks deal 8 damage, guns deal 1 damage, lava spitter deals 25 damage/sec, and cutters do sps/10 damage.
passive shield generation rate is 5% shield points/sec, and must be moving by at least 100 sps to regenerate shields to prevent spawncamping turrets from just spamming blocks, and becoming invincible
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:22:42 Anyone agree
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 04:24:34 Perhaps you can modify weapons to be either kinetic, plasma, or balanced (current). Kinetic weaponry deal 3x more damage to normal blocks, and plasma guns deal 3x more damage to shields

plane-crazy 2021-09-30 06:27:27 Rickje isn't dumb enough to add 2k shield generators

plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:07:21 Its the equivalent of deleting something else, like the configure tool
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:07:46 Like sure you can play the game without screwdriver but you have less customixability
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:09:33 I guess, but:
1. Rickje could just add a building limit timer of 10 minutes or so instead, and said time will slowly reverse back only if you are spawned and in a seat
2. cloaking tech exists, I can give you some if you like

plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:10:16 a
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:10:53 This cloaking tech tricks the server into thinking you anchored, making your "real you" free to move around without being seen
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:11:15 But the place in where you last cloaked shows your build
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:11:24 Its on-demand cloaking

plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:16:56 Man the
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:17:18 I suppose the game shouldn't count spawning time to the timeout timer
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:17:43 Ogm
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:21:21 Ok so teal is disconnector, white are just blocks, green is unpowered unlocked motor, yellow is anchor block, and ourple thing is half piston
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:21:30 And if you don't know me yet I do not use motorlocks
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:22:25 half piston is locked, and motor is unpowered and unlocked. They also have seperate keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:22:42 Oh ye and anchor block is physics off
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:22:59 Cloaking mechanism mounted in amogus warship
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:23:43 Any number would do, just don't press the half piston extend button unless you're suicidal
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:24:04 Like put it in right bracket, spacebar, or anything you won't press
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:24:35 The anchor block

plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:31:15 Yep it failed
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:31:23 It had no clue on what exactly it should crop
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:32:24 They need to add cropping feathering
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:32:27 for something like this

plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:32:45 a?

plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:51:07 Idk how but it should be something like this
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:51:16 Like a haze
plane-crazy 2021-10-02 13:51:24 To prevent the white border like in the left side

plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:46:19 No the emoj
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:46:26 The emo ji is
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:46:46 Painful truth
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:46:56 Wow he is noob
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:46:58 sadge
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:47:14 Anyways seriously what's in that video doe, is there a rickroll of some sorts or smth?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:49:04 a
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:55:18 Its gjsolo's contest build in a dragonplatinum video
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:55:43 Its really powerful
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:56:27 A build's capability to win battles and dominate pvp servers
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:56:35 Man what other definition are we talking about
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:56:48 a
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:56:54 I suppose it uses 6 rockets max
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:57:09 Its really fast yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:57:16 To the point gjsolo fights in 1k sps
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:57:34 But can go faster
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:57:39 Like 3k sps I believe
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:58:07 I suppose above normal maneuverability
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:58:56 By normal I mean like 360˚ in 3 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:59:37 Gjsolo can probably do 360˚ in 1.5-2 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:59:48 Yes its really stable
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 00:59:55 But its power mostly depends on skill
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 01:00:03 Because its mouse controlled
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 01:00:20 Like regular mouse control
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 01:00:23 Not motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 01:00:48 Optimis build
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 01:00:56 Remove excess block and moterloc
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 01:01:16 DId you commit ice
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 01:01:39 a
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 01:01:45 Do
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 01:01:50 And add nore hober
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 01:06:42 It creates too much speed
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 01:06:45 Which can be an issue
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:21:19 Wow spook
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:22:21 I do the
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:22:30 I do the I leave pcc for a while then check back later
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:22:56 Ice
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:23:23 And use half blocks other then half block wedge, half corner wedge, and half wedge down/up
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:23:46 Half wedge 2 is like the lightest building block I know
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:24:33 **DO NOT PLAY PLANE CRAZY AT 3 AM (GONE WRONG) (NOT CLICKBAIT) (BONNIE SPAWNED) (SCARY)**
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:24:39 Why doe
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:24:51 What are you gonna use it for
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:25:14 Spedn it on jetpack
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:25:25 It monthly doe
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:26:02 Nah not a scam
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:26:11 Its really useful especially for faction servers
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:26:30 But for personal use only, its not worth the price
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:26:37 OBC gon <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:27:02 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:27:22 In fact that happens too quickly in <#497142796961054721> and I don't like it
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:27:30 Unconfirmed fact
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:27:33 idk
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:27:41 I said use ice
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:27:52 Have you not read what I've said
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:28:07 You cry about it and yet you haven't read my advice
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:28:10 Everywhere
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:28:17 paint bucket the whole thing with ice
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:29:10 Yes but if you want it lighter then you gotta sacrifice the texture
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:29:13 Design or function
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:29:16 Only 1 option
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:29:31 You could make it lighter by using half blocks doe
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:29:50 If you can't do that then idk what could work
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:30:52 Helium only makes the weight lower but mass stays the same
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:31:06 Wait uh
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:31:30 Then add helium on top
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:31:45 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:31:54 Auto roll mechanism
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:32:01 Motorlocking could work
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:32:04 never tried that doe
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:32:53 Auto roll mechanism
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:33:02 So the feet mostly stays at the bottom
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:33:05 And head on top
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:33:14 if it gets flipped over it can flip itself right back up
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:33:31 motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:33:34 Or just
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:33:38 Hide the ballast somewhere
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:34:07 Then just put the anchor block on the head then
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:34:12 Then put the ballast on bottom
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:34:18 Oh no he
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:34:30 Scare
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:34:38 Relocation
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:34:42 So you can put ballast on bottom
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:35:01 Why not
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:35:29 You're trying to ask for help but your head is filled with rage you can't listen to whatever I say
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 03:35:45 mouse movement

plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:08:57 By that definition there are currently no holes in the world
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:09:29 H m
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:10:22 Thing is all holes contain some form of matter
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:10:25 Like gas or liquid

plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:17:45 
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:17:49 If you consider something like this
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:17:57 Huge tunnel going downwards
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:18:12 a
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:18:54 I see
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:19:05 whole
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:20:47 I mean if gravity exists in a 2d world this could be a tunnel of some sorts
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:20:48 or hole
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:21:05 Anyways I get your point
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:21:07 It is not hole

plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:22:37 Why not
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:23:21 It could be the objects in the 2d world
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:23:41 The objects in that world can only move 4 directions
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:23:48 They can't escape that 2d world
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:24:11 The same way we cannot escape this 3d world
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:25:52 Perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:26:30 Wdym
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:27:02 Are you talking about the 2d hole we punched in for 2d creatures
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:27:12 Or the tunnel thing
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:27:38 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:28:22 The singularity is the very small thing in the middle of black holes
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:28:34 The black thing that surrounds it is the event Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:28:51 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:28:54 Failed bote
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:31:08 Wait what if the event Horizon is just the point where gravity is strong enough to trap every single particle of light
plane-crazy 2021-10-05 02:31:18 Idk

creations-chat 2021-10-09 13:15:46 I see, thanks

 Though I can't add any more details cuz I have high block count and I need to keep the ship light and lag-free as possible. Look at the block count stats, I haven't even added the mechanisms in place

plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:36:26 Man why is there no pvp botes in here <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:38:31 So that's why you not play flame crazy
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:38:42 What did you commit
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:38:53 Just do
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:39:00 Use Horizon turrets if lazy
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:39:11 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:44:59 What
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:45:12 So you don't use medicine
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:45:19 Which are basically drugs
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:45:46 Wow you actually consistently exercise
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:45:53 I only exercise when I bored
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:46:03 So I get Endorphin
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:46:12 Man you really j
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:46:35 helth
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:47:15 h
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:48:03 h
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:48:17 I mean I do go out just to look at art
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:48:19 aka nature
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:51:59 Look nice
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:52:14 Also for the pvp plne you have before
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:52:17 Have you ever thought of
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:52:21 Thrust vectored hover thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:52:38 And half pistons for quick recall missiles
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:52:52 In case you misfired you can have a 2nd and last chance to fire them again
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:54:23 Which one
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:54:35 I haven't made recall-able missiles yet
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:55:01 Ok so basically you know when you lock half pistons the head part falls off?
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:55:23 And when you press "extend" keybind you can make the 2 parts stick back together
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:55:51 Ye it basically abuses that glitch
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:56:25 So you can teleport a missile back and hopefully make a decisive blow next time
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 10:56:39 h

plane-crazy 2021-10-14 11:14:54 a there’s none for now
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 11:15:45 When you can make spaceships that can fight in pvp, kill shredder bugs, and even function as an effective pvp boat but can’t even make a good jet

plane-crazy 2021-10-15 00:31:51 Oh the Anti-shredder servers
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 00:32:04 I guess so that people can do coordinated server strikes

plane-crazy 2021-10-15 00:45:49 g
plane-crazy 2021-10-15 00:46:11 You can modify cutters to either be healing or destroying

plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:59:15 Since I had no knowledge on how to make planes I thought what if you remove the wings and use super rockets to do plane maneuvers
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:59:33 But then of course plane spun out of control
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 10:59:38 So I add wing because it plaen

plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:12:20 Ok now make it fly
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:12:36 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:12:51 Even 1 jet turbine can negate the gravity of what
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:12:54 a 3k block build?
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:12:59 There are servos
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:13:04 I mean
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:13:05 OH
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:13:06 motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:13:07 nope
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:13:54 Lmao
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:14:43 The only real benefit Build a boat has is infinite block count if you're rich and pc2 plot size
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:15:51 Better physics or realistic physics
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:15:56 I want the 1st option
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:16:25 My spaceship would stop working
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:16:27 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:17:17 Perhaps 2 gamemodes, 1 for realistic physics and 1 for funny physics which allows for conv and stupid maneuvering
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:17:27 Look how its made
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:17:40 Its a colorful, cartoonish game
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:18:03 Oh yes and the easiness of said game
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:18:58 Perhaps modified f3x
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:19:03 So the game still stays voxel based
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:19:24 f3x complicated I agree
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:20:12 Ultra 4k realistic editing
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:20:18 Anyways nice boat doe

plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:29:20 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:29:41 Its just that the fanbase genuinely supports rickje for making the game
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:29:55 Build a boat players only support the devs for gamepasses
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:30:05 Like plane crazy

plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:38:25 Or sometimes a spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:39:07 ```fard```
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:41:07 Makes build more stable
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:41:14 By of course increasing drag
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:41:35 COmpared to a wing where-in it only applies on 2 sides
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:41:46 Drag from a Hover Thruster is omnidirectional
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:42:17 Ok so drag makes you slow down
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:42:18 g
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:42:23 h
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:42:28 np I guess
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:42:40 Yep
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:42:59 But it applies drag on all sides you can think of
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 04:43:08 COmpared to a wing panel which only has drag on 2 sides

plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:33:14 Cloaking is different
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:33:20 You can't shoot people under cloak mode
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:33:39 You also are very vulnurable
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:33:53 Since you have a hologram positioned in where you were the last time you cloaked
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 05:35:07 <@!696225961783459871> So do you still choose to keep cloak or nah?

plane-crazy 2021-10-29 07:24:33 Life game
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 07:24:45 Happening for 5 hours now from what I heard
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 07:25:07 Wo ultra 4k rtx on hdr
the-dump 2021-10-29 07:29:43 WO
the-dump 2021-10-29 07:29:46 RTX
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 08:41:07 Perhaps you get manage message roles for a split second then get them removed
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 08:41:13 Using bot
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 08:41:16 Wait
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 08:41:26 I go test something
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 08:44:52 I mean
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 08:44:55 Manage messages
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 08:44:57 Not manage roles
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 08:44:58 bru
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 08:45:27 But either way, giving someone manage messages then removing it does not reset the timer
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 08:45:56 So slowmode immunity without obtaining moderator perms is not possible
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 08:49:33 You can shut off manage message perms there
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 08:49:54 And every other moderator restricted channels
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 08:53:21 Bruh I mean
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 08:53:36 You know how bots detect whenever you send a bad word
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 08:53:54 So bots know what channel you are at
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 08:54:23 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 10:21:33 Some people review their creations before posting

plane-crazy 2021-11-04 17:23:26 Modern society has corrupted itself, its time to turn back and reset the damage
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 17:24:03 ~~And return to living in harsh conditions where-in food isn’t always readily available in a certain place and diseases are rampant~~
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 17:25:38 Humanity in itself is both the disease and the cure
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 17:29:50 Humanity do be similar to the E.coli bacterium. Some strains of it benefit the host or the planet in our case, but some strains can cause damage.

plane-crazy 2021-11-08 05:42:33 Like behind the motor 2s, put locked motors with the gray part touching the motor 2

plane-crazy 2021-11-08 09:27:37 What's wrong with kill counts
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 09:27:56 At least I get to know which dude is too dangerous to fight with
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 09:29:23 Simple, if you respawn, the ones who damage the most blocks before the player despawns is the "killer"
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 09:30:00 Or if the main pilot seat has been popped, the one who popped the seat first is the killer
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 09:30:08 h
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 09:30:10 Like what
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 09:31:46 What is there to abuse in a kill counting system, its not like the more you kill the more powerful your guns are <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 09:33:58 Then perhaps all blocks connected to the main pilot seat must not be out of the plot/player must not shoot in order to not be counted as a kill
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 09:34:15 Or longer spawn protection
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 09:35:16 Perhaps the build must at least have 37% of its blocks gone in order to be counted as a kill
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 09:35:37 I never stated that spawncamping turrets are invincible
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 09:35:50 It just makes it so that you won't be counted as a kill as long as you stay in plot
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 09:36:21 That's why we're solving problems until we encounter a problem that's impossible to solve
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 09:38:59 Perhaps only the blocks that are connected to main pilot seat are counted. Disconnected blocks are out of the equation
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 09:39:04 Agre
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 09:41:05 Then make it so they don't count as well
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 09:41:45 Well at least I get to track which people are peaceful and which ones are to be wary about
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 09:42:30 Oh ye I forgor

general 2021-11-09 09:49:08 The build would have to pass a 2nd stage of upvote checking

plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:19:03 On how to make plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:19:11 Sup weep
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:19:26 Him
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:19:46 Should i add conv engine?
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:19:51 And hover drives?
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:20:01 h
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:20:15 I mean in the long run
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:20:19 When I get pro enough
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:20:23 Why not
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:20:42 Conv engines negate shaking doe
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:21:22 What if I motorlock a spaceship conv engine inside it
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:21:42 I hate thrust vectoring
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:21:49 In pc
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:21:54 You can't see your exact thrust
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:21:58 And so I would have to guess
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:22:17 ik
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:22:31 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:23:11 No its not that, I can make it run like 1 speed and it can fully negate my tendency to shake
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:23:26 When i normally would shake using hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:23:54 Doesn't happen all the time but usually does when I exit conv mode and my speed is like 3k sps
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:23:59 m
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:24:21 m
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:24:42 Well I don't like it when I wanna go 50% throttle but then it was actually 10% the whole time
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:26:13 Same
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:26:36 h
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:28:01 Oh yes <@!495210490172014612>, should I add thrust vectored hover thrusters when I cannot solve maneuverability problem with normal engines
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:29:25 I mean like
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:29:33 Hover thrusters mounted in servo motor 2s
plane-crazy 2021-11-18 03:29:58 Might allow me to vtol

plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:06:51 Obvious reasons
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:06:57 That your furry brain cannot comprehend
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:07:42 Same
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:07:50 Never played the "trendy games" recently
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:07:53 Other than amogus
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:08:24 How doe
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:08:33 I don't remember mobile legends having guns
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:08:47 m
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:08:52 I mean like
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:08:59 Rapid fire automatic guns
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:09:15 him
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:09:34 What do you expect from a chinese company
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:13:02 Mao can control social credits of your opponents as well
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:13:32 Interesting
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:14:43 Man my motorloc is mess
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:14:52 Do I clean
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:15:01 h
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:15:02 I want
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:15:28 Him
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:15:44 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:15:46 Clean
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:25:42 WO
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:26:48 I mean like compared to other builds which can easily be edited at any time
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:27:02 The motorlock is densely packed
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 06:27:09 h
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 07:43:06 Just learned
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 07:43:15 You can use landing gears for togglable hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 08:55:41 How do I
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 08:55:43 Improve jet aim
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 08:55:48 I use motor 2 mouse control
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 08:56:15 the dog
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:27:56 When did you made that
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:28:17 a
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:28:22 Seems good for a starter plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:28:38 COmpared to my plane failure I recently made
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:29:48 Does anyone have a conv engine design for a plane?
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:30:08 Didn't you already do that
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:30:47 m
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:32:31 Which on
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:32:36 Ok I chas
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:33:12 Man what your name
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:33:55 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:34:09 Its the same guy
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:34:12 Over and over again
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:35:22 Cuz if there was a tutorial it would be popular
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:35:27 And highly disliked
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:42:10 I also called the entire italian mafia to head to your house
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:42:27 You won't get banned yet
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:42:32 Once you get 3 warns
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:42:34 In 1 month
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:42:50 At least its better than mine
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:48:38 Seems already worthy enough to be posted in creations
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:48:56 Could cause weight imbalance doe
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:49:36 j
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:49:39 Tru
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:50:43 Oh you mean non-pvp and pvp variant?
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:51:24 The mods will see through the filters
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:51:35 Go setting
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:51:39 Go look for photo mode
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:51:43 Then set your keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:51:52 I suggest using 1 key for photomode instead of 2
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:52:11 You don't
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:52:57 Nah you don't need filters
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:53:03 But its recommended doe
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:53:07 To enhance the image
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:54:01 Though many people like I said, will see through the filters and check if the build is worth upvoting
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:54:09 Or not
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:54:11 m
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:56:55 Don't rush
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:56:57 Take your time
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 09:57:43 Ah I see
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 16:45:08 Plane crazy tech is just superior
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 16:45:23 Look at our planes, they can do 100g maneuvers without breaking or killing the pilot
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 16:45:51 We can make whatever we want to fly
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 16:45:59 FLying box, spaceship, boat, tank
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 16:46:05 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 16:46:42 Some builds can even travel mach 10 in an instant
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:53:34 Good luck with that
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:53:46 Show
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:53:56 I joine you
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:54:11 Bruh
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:54:36 There's no way its a "super powerful" jet
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:54:47 Haven't heard of one that's quickly produced
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:55:42 j
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:55:56 Man server full
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:55:58 Oh well
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:57:15 He has to rebuild it again
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 19:16:16 Man lips
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:59:21 Since I had motor 2 mouse control I did the funny
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 03:59:36 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:00:05 Wait I haven't added the cring color scheme yet brb
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:02:45 Him
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:03:01 But look at it closer
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:03:08 Those aren't wing panels, they're cutters
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:03:16 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:03:43 Hold on lemme test if shredder plane is effective
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:05:17 j
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:07:33 Man
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:07:44 I just bounce off targets instead of doing funny
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:08:00 Either way it was a shitty move to try to turn a plane into a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:09:55 It was for "scientific research"
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:10:44 It used motor 2 mouse control so I thought, what if I added cutter in the front
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:11:38 What
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:11:41 how
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:12:06 By then I would already be ded
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 04:15:53 Him

general 2021-11-21 08:40:22 You can
general 2021-11-21 08:40:27 Go near gas station

general 2021-11-21 08:41:00 That’s 99% of all builds
general 2021-11-21 08:41:15 Save for the few builds built in like 2019 bound to lost accounts
general 2021-11-21 08:41:42 m
general 2021-11-21 08:42:14 Nu
general 2021-11-21 08:42:20 Do you have a flying boat doe

plane-crazy 2021-11-21 10:31:58 Guys who wanna chill in pvp mode
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 10:50:37 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 10:50:39 Make Banana
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 10:50:42 Embrace banana
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 10:50:47 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 10:50:55 Make Mango <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:29:31 Do the 3 rockets at the back ruin the looks of the plaen
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:30:33 Welp I guess its fine
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 15:44:46 I am pro landing
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 18:24:52 I spent 8 hours trying to make a plane that isn't even detailed
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:22:39 Looks like my lag machine without trails
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:23:06 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:23:37 HE flexx
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:23:44 Wait
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:23:57 What sps do you wobble at
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:24:28 m
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:24:38 Perhaps my planes just suck
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:25:23 Yes but I wobble at like 700 sps, especially during laggy conditions
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:25:34 Far less compared to yours
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:26:06 Not sure its considered a lot but nop
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:26:51 Block counter broken so I can't really chec <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:27:03 I can show you unmotorlocced plaen doe
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:27:10 Hm
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:27:55 I bet its like around 10 wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:28:10 And like 14 control surfaces and delta 12 wings
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:30:17 What
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:32:21 Ok this is the jet and stuf
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:32:36 Made it diamond plate to make it easier to see
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:33:12 I do
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:33:13 m
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:33:39 You have skil isue eyes
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:33:40 I show
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:33:57 
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:34:08 I find hover thrusters to be more laggy
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:34:12 For some reason
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:34:39 Exactly
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:34:47 It makes it togglable
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:34:57 Cuz variable thrust sucs
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:35:10 Well then try it out for yourself then
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:35:53 Well then try it out for yourself then
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:36:13 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:36:39 Then try it out
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:36:49 Sadge
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:37:13 Meanwhile me gaming up to 3 am <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:37:27 He has something called a fixed sleep schedule I guess
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:37:42 What
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:37:43 Man
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:37:48 You playing fnaf irl
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:37:54 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:38:34 Tested it as well
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:38:41 Works just as powerful as a motor hover drive
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:38:49 a
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:38:57 Yes good luck
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:39:03 Not on rn
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:39:15 Just went to get a screenshot h
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:42:01 Him
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:42:12 Also if it were real
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:42:20 It should be browser only, only ipad
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:42:36 So mobile devices are safe from pc hellhole
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:43:05 Pro
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:43:24 Good night
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:45:34 Him
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:49:57 Hyperspace motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:57:46 So uh
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 00:57:53 Does anyone here know how do I not wobble at 500-800 sps
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:28:27 What
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:28:30 him
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:28:36 My Horizon is super light doe
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:28:49 Yet if can travel 1.5k sps with ease
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:29:47 I mean for big builds fps means nothing
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:29:56 And doesn't affect stability
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:33:17 No wonder why you're so stable
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:33:22 Cuz conveyors can go 2 ways
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:34:03 Either it negates shaking and removes wing drag, allowing you to traverse at ridiculous speeds
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:34:40 Or it worsens the situation and may make you warp into the immaterium
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:36:12 A
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:36:13 he hac
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:37:31 Wo
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:37:42 But yes conveyors are good wobble negators
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:37:53 I can like travel 30k sps no problem
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:38:13 90k sps if I remove my turrets
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:38:36 a?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:38:48 Anyways can you show me your conveyor engine design or smth
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:38:52 for a plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:38:59 My spaceship conv engine is too massive
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:40:04 piston conv engine
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:40:40 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:40:50 Also do you use drag in your hober thrusters?
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:41:07 j
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:42:06 hm
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:42:08 h
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:42:43 Though I wonder how does someone like Gjsolo even travel like 2k sps without wobble
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:43:01 He uses pure hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:43:08 And super rockets for details
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:44:37 Nvm
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:44:52 I thought it was a perfect wobble negation system
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:45:25 Cuz I use jet for pvp and need accuracy
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:45:31 Especially since I have massive skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 01:46:05 Perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:11:44 Do
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:14:29 What is going on
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:14:47 My brain is
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:14:49 brain'nt
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:22:32 Reminds me of a spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:22:37 Someone built
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:22:38 brb
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:22:39 I get
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:24:00 
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:25:25 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:25:29 Equally as braindead as Horizon
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:25:52 Agre
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:25:59 Every single plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:26:22 Other than Cosmo Tiger which is a fictional plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:28:22 m
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:28:54 Wo he has a lot of social credits
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:29:00 Xi Jinping is proud of you
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:30:30 Probably not
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:30:41 Nice stand stats on the bottom left
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:31:53 Anyone here who uses motor 2 mous contro
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:31:58 How do I get good at the
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:32:49 You don't roll using motor 2 mouse control
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:32:56 You only use yaw and pitch
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:33:04 Roll is overrated anyways
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:33:34 a
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 02:33:37 Tbh I have roll

plane-crazy 2021-12-03 01:24:44 eas
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 01:25:09 Use motor
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 01:25:30 Well sorry but that's the closest you can get
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 01:25:42 What would be its purpose
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 01:25:44 Other than decor
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 01:26:39 That could work but I don't wanna spam so much solar panels in my spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 01:26:59 Exactly
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 01:28:05 The block will still be shown
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:12:31 Faster rockets
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:12:38 The new ones have almost no speed buff
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:12:45 Bad for turrets
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:12:53 Good for planes
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 03:13:04 Cuz more eas tracking

plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:38:08 3k sps
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:38:15 But slow turning
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:39:42 Huge turning circle
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:39:55 Exactly
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:40:22 I use super rockets to turn
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:40:33 And motor 2 control panels in my plane
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:41:00 Step 1: have patience
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:41:38 Used to be 5 minutes
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:42:16 Man
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:42:28 Wait
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:42:31 Just wait
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:44:29 Just slap on a prototrode conv engine (good luck)
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:45:11 They’re the fastest tut conv engines in pc I believe
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:45:23 Do you not know what the concept of waiting is
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:46:07 <@!335599526414909451> spamme

plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:47:22 No I’m a (chad?) mid rank

plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:51:11 <@!195253906333368320> Hihi bunny there’s unde called <@!895315318694617158>
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:51:54 Idk but if you wanna prove the unde wrong
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:53:15 You seem like an unde
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:53:20 Stop hiding your age
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:53:23 Lma
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:54:48 I smell a strong aroma of unde
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:56:01 Should we drop ping bomb
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:56:02 lma
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:59:12 Well at least not as bad as a random unde that almost got 2 friends banned from roblo
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 04:59:18 Despite using a lag machine
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 05:17:58 What's wrong
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 05:18:37 Also does anyone know how to make a warhammer Imperium ship prowl
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 15:55:32 Agre
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 15:55:39 Been using motor 2 mouse control
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 15:55:45 Fixes my severe skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 15:56:21 Or rather reduces severe skil is
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:25:29 I mean why would you even wanna make a train anyways
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:26:07 You don't gain the maneuverability freedom of a car, let alone a plane
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:29:42 Lma Just ram them over
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:30:00 Then they get pushed off track
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:30:13 Then do a beatdown
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:30:23 True
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:30:51 Either way they can't hit you in an aircraft, since planes can just pull a 100g maneuver and dodge attacks cuz yes
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:34:00 There's a possibility doe
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:34:10 If something can go wrong, it will go wrong
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:37:18 Meanwhile me thinking this is complicated motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:37:58 My first attempt at a pvp plane
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:38:57 j
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:40:15 He run
creations-chat 2021-12-03 16:41:45 What should I fix other than making the canopy glass, I wanna be as lightweight as possible
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:46:17 Speed
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:46:21 MAneuverability
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:46:24 Stability
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:46:27 Firepower
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:46:58 Agre
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:48:33 So basically you know how to make a pvp plane but just choose to build a detailed kind
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:49:33 Use motor 2 mouse control <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:49:45 Pitch and yaw
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:50:02 I use motor 2 mous
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:50:08 Feels good
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:50:28 Or rather physics throttle
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:51:39 Wdym brick
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:53:34 If possible, that would be recommended
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:53:54 Though the most important is maneuverability and sps
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:54:12 Low maneuverabiloity and you won't be able to aim (too much maneuverability can reduce aim especially on wasd), low sps and you're free shredder/spam car food
creations-chat 2021-12-03 16:55:29 How do
help 2021-12-03 16:58:49 I'm curious what do you even do in plane crazy if you don't really pvp

the-dump 2022-03-23 01:49:49 You find a girlfriend. You spend a good time with her. But one day, you got into a fight, but you got knocked out unconscious. You seem to wake up in a strange room. You see some gruesome machines, some covered in spikes. Then you realize:

**Its a torture chamber, deep underground your "girlfriend's" house**

She wasn't there to care for you. She was manipulating you to give her your trust. She wanted to make you her lab rat. As she climbs with you with what seems to be tools straight from a bsdm club, the next thing you hear.

*...Is the screams of your voice.*

general 2023-04-11 12:35:30 Me when I fling it
general 2023-04-11 12:36:07 Surely the mf you are with 6 hours of pvp experience surely is one to speak
general 2023-04-11 12:36:09 Go on, preach
general 2023-04-11 12:37:04 No tech knowledge eh?
general 2023-04-11 12:37:19 As if you’re different from me
general 2023-04-11 12:37:29 You see, we’re opposite sides of the same coin buddy
general 2023-04-11 12:38:02 Yep, definitely my buddy
general 2023-04-11 12:38:50 More idiocy of course
general 2023-04-11 12:39:00 This is the natural state of plane crazy
general 2023-04-11 12:39:19 Where the very atmosphere is lit on fire
general 2023-04-11 12:41:31 Let time decide who is right then.
general 2023-04-11 12:43:44 Plane crazy 2 will never come, at least one released by rickje
general 2023-04-11 12:44:01 If anything, flightpoint is already plane crazy 2
general 2023-04-11 12:46:06 We have a fleet of conventional spaceships in case that ever happens, we already considered that scenario
general 2023-04-11 12:46:18 Indeed
general 2023-04-11 12:48:33 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
general 2023-04-11 12:49:11 Question is: who’s gonna fire the first nuke
general 2023-04-11 12:50:32 Infinity + 2024 years into the future
general 2023-04-11 12:51:00 Ngl I think
general 2023-04-11 12:51:19 Rickje will never release pc2, I think he got demotivated a ton when flightpoint was made
general 2023-04-11 12:51:52 Ever make something only to realize someone has done it earlier and better than you did, as you fall into a state of despondency
