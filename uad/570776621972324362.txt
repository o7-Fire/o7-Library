general 2020-09-26 21:46:34 did they break the flying cutterbugs to try and stop them?
general 2020-09-26 21:47:35 hm.
creations-chat 2020-09-26 21:48:31 what about cutterbugs. did they purposely break those?
creations-chat 2020-09-26 21:58:20 eeeey
creations-chat 2020-09-26 22:06:25 i made an anti cutterbug thing.
creations-chat 2020-09-26 22:06:48 this rips apart cutterbugs as they try to attack me.
creations-chat 2020-09-26 22:07:36 sure
creations-chat 2020-09-26 22:08:47 IT CANT DRIVE easily though.

creations-chat 2020-09-26 22:11:45 most of mine are BIG TANKS
creations-chat 2020-09-26 22:12:04 done.
creations-chat 2020-09-26 22:12:25 lets see if suspention helps.

creations-chat 2020-09-27 18:39:16 Im going to build a cutterbug shredder.
creations-chat 2020-09-27 19:04:24 > No shut the fuck up and leave the discord
<@456226577798135808> 
I meant to say "anti cutterbug shredder"
creations-chat 2020-09-27 21:47:17 This is the frame for my new anti cutterbug shredder, all the gaps are gonna be filled with cutters(beside the wheel wells) i am officially joining the cutterbug rebellion
creations-chat 2020-09-27 21:47:55 thanks!
creations-chat 2020-09-27 21:48:35 should i make it tall or short?
creations-chat 2020-09-27 21:49:18 short it is.
creations-chat 2020-09-27 21:50:36 *oh no*
creations-chat 2020-09-27 21:51:56 im gonna use 1x1 blocks to build the walls of this thing, it wil make it harder to destroy as there are more peices evident.
creations-chat 2020-09-27 21:54:37 so the ww2 german symbol isnt allowed, is the hammer and sycle?
creations-chat 2020-09-27 21:58:14 should i use winter wheels or normal wheels if im building something heavy?
creations-chat 2020-09-27 21:58:34 oki
creations-chat 2020-09-27 22:11:29 they need to add a mirror mode...
creations-chat 2020-09-27 22:15:21 this is how im layering my cutterbug shredder, everything is a 1x1 block, so it takes longer to shred down to the core.
creations-chat 2020-09-27 22:24:32 IM OUT OF GOSHDARN CUTTERS
creations-chat 2020-09-27 22:31:04 who else thinks they should add cannons to the game? like tank cannons.

<@484529511468236802> 
To make it harder for cutterbugs to shred through.

plane-crazy 2020-12-22 20:16:25 Terminal velocity, steady speed achieved by an object freely falling through a gas or liquid. ... An object dropped from rest will increase its speed until it reaches terminal velocity; an object forced to move faster than its terminal velocity will, upon release, slow down to this constant velocity.
