plane-crazy 2019-08-19 06:12:13 i used to rule the world
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 06:13:09 i used to rule the world
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 06:13:10 Chunks would load when I gave the word
Now every night I go stow away
Hide from the mobs I used to slay
They once were terrified
Every time I looked into their eyes
Villagers would cheer my way
For a hero I was, that's what they'd say
One minute we had it all
Next our world began to fall
Away from all that it had once become
They all cried for my help, but I stood there numb
I gaze off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
And hope one day that this chaos and
Destruction turns for the better
Never a bow in hand
That was when I ruled the land
It was the creepers and Skeletons
Blew down the doors and boxed us in
Arrows whizzing by like streaks of light
I tried all that I could to stay and fight
As the undead roamed the street
Families broken at my feet
Life itself suspended by a thread
Oh, why is it that I wasn't dead
I gaze off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
If this battle should leave me slain
I know that Herobrine will call my name
Better to take a stand
That was when I ruled the land
I gaze off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
If this battle should leave me slain
I know that Herobrine will call my name
Better to take a stand
That was when I ruled the land

creations-chat 2020-12-20 05:33:05 i dont know any block thinner than trail so i guess you kinda gotta have it cursed
bug-reports 2020-12-20 05:33:30 you making a heli?
bug-reports 2020-12-20 05:34:04 make sure you aint spinnin the rotor too fast or yeah the motors will break
creations-chat 2020-12-20 05:35:19 red how does that work
creations-chat 2020-12-20 05:37:22 but the sparkler is also connected to the trail and itll move the sparkler along with it
creations-chat 2020-12-20 05:39:28 i think the blocky tips of the wings makes it look kinda fat
you could also prolly make the air brake closest to the edges a delta wing
