general 2021-05-11 18:58:45 Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He’s not breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls 911.

“I think my friend is dead!” he yells. “What can I do?”

The operator says, “Calm down. First, let’s make sure he’s dead.”

There’s a silence, then a shot. Back on the phone, the guy says, “OK, now what?”

general 2021-05-11 18:59:56 wanna see morse code
general 2021-05-11 19:00:00 but no ban
general 2021-05-11 19:00:56 Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes (or dits and dahs).[2][3] Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, an inventor of the telegraph.

International Morse Code, also known as Continental Morse Code,[4] encodes the 26 English letters A through Z, some non-English letters, the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns). There is no distinction between upper and lower case letters.[1] Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dots and dashes. The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code transmission. The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot. Each dot or dash within a character is followed by a period of signal absence, called a space, equal to the dot duration. The letters of a word are separated by a space of duration equal to three dots, and words are separated by a space equal to seven dots.[1]

Morse code can be memorized and sent in a form perceptible to the human senses, e.g. via sound waves or visible light, such that it can be directly interpreted by persons trained in the skill.[5][6] Morse code is usually transmitted by on-off keying of an information-carrying medium such as electric current, radio waves, visible light, or sound waves.[7][8] The current or wave is present during the time period of the dot or dash and absent during the time between dots and dashes.[9][10] Since many non-English natural languages use other than the 26 Roman letters, Morse alphabets have been developed for those languages.[11]

general 2021-05-11 19:03:09 waitwikipedia
general 2021-05-11 19:03:14 Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkɪˈpiːdiə/ (About this soundlisten) wik-ih-PEE-dee-ə or /ˌwɪki-/ (About this soundlisten) wik-ee-) is a free, multilingual online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteer contributors through a model of open collaboration, using a wiki-based editing system. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history,[3] and is consistently one of the 15 most-popular websites as ranked by Alexa; as of 2021, it ranked as the 13th most-popular site.[3][4] The project carries no advertisements and is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American non-profit organization funded mainly through individual donations.[5]

Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger; Sanger coined its name as a portmanteau of "wiki" and "encyclopedia".[6][7] Initially available only in English, versions in other languages were quickly developed. The English Wikipedia, with 6.3 million articles as of May 2021, is the largest of the 321 language editions. Combined, Wikipedia's editions comprise more than 56 million articles, and attract more than 17 million edits and more than 1.7 billion unique visitors per month.[8][9]

Wikipedia has received praise for its enablement of the democratization of knowledge, extent of coverage, unique structure, culture, and reduced amount of commercial bias, but has also been criticized for its perceived unreliability and for exhibiting systemic bias, namely racial bias and gender bias against women, and alleged ideological bias. In 2006, Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the "biggest and perhaps the best encyclopedia in the world", and a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.[10] In 2018, Facebook and YouTube announced that they would help users detect fake news by suggesting links to related Wikipedia articles.[11]
