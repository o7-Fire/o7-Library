creations-chat 2022-09-13 16:58:50 this is the oposite of the KFC claim that they are breeding chicken without wings and more meat
creations-chat 2022-09-16 17:40:03 put this into the hall of fame bois
creations-chat 2022-09-25 14:34:47 scuffed typhoon, built by a friend not mine i got permission to post it
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:19:41 Pc2 is a pretty complex game, i wouldn't really set any expectations for the release soon, since even rick mentions there is alot to do ill maybe say Q1-Q3 of 2023 but that could be also very far away from reality
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:21:55 The winter update will release on the 31. of feburary 2023
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:22:12 (Yes ik feburary only goes till 28)

plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:23:47 They stole gramna *D:*
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:25:18 Is it really a roblox server when a 12 year old is trying to teach me about aerodynamics when im a pilot…
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:25:34 Yeah…
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:25:52 Not american planes 🙂
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:25:58 Gliderd
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:26:25 Ask-21 and also Doing light training on Diamon D-40
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:27:26 Wow.
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:27:33 Now take out the engine
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:27:40 I also sure didnt know
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:27:57 Its a plane designed for grass fields
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:28:01 So yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:28:24 Also has a long wingspan wich increases the glide ratio, thats why we call them motor sailers
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:29:47 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:30:00 Since drag is legit now, yes…
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:30:17 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:30:19 Infinite
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:31:09 L for mech builders
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:31:16 Jk theyre really cool
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:31:38 More space for my aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:31:41 Reeeee
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:32:21 Arent blocks scaleable?
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:32:40 Rick said sum with block scaling didnt he?
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:33:39 I forgor my pc so no example picd
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:34:27 For some days cutters got completly broken
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:34:41 So shredder bugs became litterally just a flying stick
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:35:18 I mean not that i destroy and outrun them with my plane but *cough*
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:35:39 Lift is gonna be an actuall coefficient of drag
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:35:52 Wings didnt have drag
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:35:56 Just lift
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:36:20 Currently in pc there is no such thing as drag
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:36:50 Ever heard of gravity?
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:37:06 And friction?
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:37:47 What if pc2 ads complex aerodynamics so just a stick plane would be actually worse than a Su-57
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:38:07 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:38:47 Why
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:38:59 Like the wing tip landing gear?
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:39:30 But why on a harrier
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:39:50 https://tenor.com/view/maml-tb2-bayraktar-bomb-uav-gif-22771152
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:39:58 Uav finally arrived
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:40:21 I wish there was a 1.5 wedge
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:40:34 Dunno
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:40:56 If you see it that way i think the motors would be pretty unaffected
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:41:04 Cuz its really thin
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:41:16 And dont think that the center collum will still have colli
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 21:41:47 Imma hit the sack got school tomorow 😑
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 14:34:12 Merry christmas? *:(*
general 2022-12-25 21:58:50 rickje jesus chirst can you stop making your game worse, an update doesnt mean an improvment.
