bug-reports 2022-03-16 22:09:06 my pvp rockets seem to fire about 8 seconds late after pressing the launch key
bug-reports 2022-03-16 22:09:39 I would press the designated key, the rockets would go invisible or something from the rocket holder part
bug-reports 2022-03-16 22:10:16 and then about 8 seconds later, they would appear at where I fired them,  follow their trajectory and then proceed to explode shortly after
bug-reports 2022-03-16 22:10:36 it does not matter whether I have low or high ping, this glitch will now happen every single time I fire my rockets

general 2022-03-17 15:50:40 how high on ketamine are you today?
general 2022-03-17 15:51:15 "A boy who behaves in a typically girlish manner" says google
general 2022-03-17 15:51:21 bruh
general 2022-03-17 15:51:39 lol
general 2022-03-17 15:52:54 good for you
general 2022-03-17 16:09:06 as a floridian, can confirm

general 2022-04-20 21:07:55 among us? what's that?
general 2022-04-20 21:09:50 hello, making an A-10
general 2022-04-20 21:10:42 not sure how you would do that
general 2022-04-20 21:10:57 could just use a piston on a motor lock
general 2022-04-20 21:11:05 that's the only thing I can think of
general 2022-04-20 21:11:42 maybe
general 2022-04-20 21:13:45 the welding can get annoying
general 2022-04-20 21:14:14 whoa
general 2022-04-20 21:14:25 the xb-70 looks like something familiar
general 2022-04-20 21:14:45 maybe
general 2022-04-20 21:14:54 that might ruin the difficulty of engineering though
general 2022-04-20 21:15:17 yeah
general 2022-04-20 21:15:32 the resize tool could probably help me with really long angles
general 2022-04-20 21:15:44 since I'm really bad at angle locking
general 2022-04-20 21:15:50 maybe
general 2022-04-20 21:16:06 the smallest thing I can think of is the half wedge
general 2022-04-20 21:16:18 no point in really resizing it though
general 2022-04-20 21:16:29 oh yeah

general 2022-04-20 21:16:34 forgor about htose

plane-crazy 2022-06-05 00:08:58 happy killdozer day
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 23:30:51 does anyone know of some sort of orbit thing?
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 23:31:16 this guy made wing lights and spheres orbit him without any sort of other blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 23:31:30 just wing lights and spheres
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 23:31:38 I'm not sure how it's happening

bug-reports 2022-08-19 19:28:15 why do motor 2's seem to break if they have motor 1's attached to them?
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 22:26:44 did they change the way you edit signs in plane crazy?
