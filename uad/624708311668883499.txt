help 2023-01-20 10:02:51 Can anyone help me out? I’m trying to make a sort of strike aircraft with some pretty fast missiles (intended for air to ground), and the warhead just keeps exploding before hitting the target leaving it completely undamaged.

plane-crazy 2023-03-12 06:26:54 working on a SU-57 rn

plane-crazy 2023-03-12 06:27:48 well I picked a random MP3 file in my computer for the music
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 06:27:57 so that's that
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 06:28:43 yes it does fly which does meet the minimum requirements I've set for being a plane
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 06:29:15 sure
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 06:29:19 you go get em buddy
plane-crazy 2023-03-12 06:30:12 if a modified honda civic is a racing car then who's to say your bus isn't a plane

plane-crazy 2023-03-13 07:09:33 While I can’t make out much with the 8 pixels total in your screenshot I reckon the barrel could be smoother and would recommend some materials on the body (maybe some rust?)

plane-crazy 2023-05-15 04:55:29 Motorlocking is quite difficult however I find it admirable so many go to such lengths to master it 

I do have to agree with your second message there though
plane-crazy 2023-05-15 04:56:44 Thank you for the tips, I’ll be back soon with a (hopefully) better MiG-31
