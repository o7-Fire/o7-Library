plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:18:37 The whole hood being guns
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:18:50 Or a spinning shredder at the front
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:19:13 But the vehicle has to be heavy and have some power to counter the pull of the other vehicle
the-dump 2021-02-17 11:21:49 
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:22:14 Hmmmmm

plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:22:38 Wood chipper
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:23:06 E
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:23:11 Uhhhh i wante
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:23:13 Oh right
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:23:18 Can we fuplicate builds
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:23:21 Like uhhhh
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:23:24 Cope this
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:23:27 And paste it
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:23:36 Cause i already built one engine i dont
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:23:42 Well crap
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:23:53 Woulf be a nice in game thing tho
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:24:12 Unde?
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:43:30 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:44:05 You mean innocent until proven guilty?
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:44:59 I mean just cause his friend made it,it does not mean he copied it although it suggests that he did
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:45:35 Rieperal is attacking him alot but lkai did have a few contradictions to his story
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:45:51 You need perms to copy?
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:46:07 Whats next we'll get a copyright claim on a product?
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:46:40 If ya wanna fight with someone ask them to not use a shredder maybe
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:46:46 Or go for a private server
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:47:18 Yeah using a shredder doesnt make a person evil salty xbox kid with divorced parents sheesh
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:47:57 Just to be clear if i see something cool i probably wont copy it but i will copy it by eye and try my own style on it
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:48:21 Cause dem builds are creative commons
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:48:38 Whats next someone gonna make sao logo and get a lawsuit lmao
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:49:03 Exactly^
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:49:27 I mean you can
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:49:35 But if you just copy over and over
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:49:40 Without trying your own
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:49:45 Thats just shallow minded
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:50:03 Copied what irl?
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:50:09 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:50:21 I mean yeah but most of us did our own spins
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:50:27 Like homework
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:50:41 I actually didnt even copy one assignment
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:50:56 I just found one online and downloaded it onto a flash drive
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:51:03 Done presentation within 5 minutes
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:51:15 Ehhhh
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:51:17 Kind ish
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:51:21 Yeh
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:51:39 When a person made a mig 21
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:51:45 And i asked them
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:51:52 Then they said it wasnt the 21
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:52:03 It was the (chinese version)
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:52:09 Which to them was the original
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:52:17 Same with the tu 4 or whatever
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:52:42 According to some people,some copies are more original than the original
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:53:05 I no likie locking
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:53:12 Also piston cylinder
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:53:34 Despite spending a long time designing a piston head it still doesnt work good
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:53:52 Cause plane cray cray friction autism
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:54:09 Cause
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:54:14 Sky scrapers of locks
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:54:25 And then you screw up one part and you dont know which one
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:54:34 So you have a breakdown
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:54:43 Giant engine piston
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:54:50 Like i replicated
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:54:57 A 2 piston engine
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:55:15 And it still has issues but at least it can withstand max speed and torque
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:55:39 It is when you have poor knowledge of this game
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:55:50 My gameplay is like 1 week
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:56:04 Ill only do locking once i have nothing better to do
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:56:21 Cause its a  huge 1k+ blocks decoration
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:56:44 And cause im planning on making it better and slapping it onto a quad mech thing
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:56:51 Basically howls castle
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:57:27 Rn im thinking about adding a camshaft and some sort of system
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:57:57 That sounds alot
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:58:08 Is it?
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:58:27 Wow
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:58:36 3 weeks
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:58:46 I mean idk how long veterans play
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:59:05 But like i said once i have nothing better to do ill get a life
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:59:44 Anyways issue with the sheer height of the engine
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 11:59:50 Is due to the shaft angling
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 12:00:12 The shorter the shaft the more the rod moves and that disrupts the pidton head
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 12:00:31 I fixed that by extending the shaft but it still lagged like hell
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 12:00:45 Then i decided to make a small costum piston head with a joint on top
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 12:01:07 And im thinking of modifying the next series to make it shorter
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 12:01:30 Rn a piston is 9-10 blocks high i think
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 12:02:07 I also had to remove the fly wheel thingy due to lenght worries
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 12:02:28 I tried to make it 3 cylinder but the game broke and the shaft went up into the stratosphere
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 12:02:53 So here i am
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 12:03:06 A giant 2 cylinder 2 tact engine
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 12:03:09 That does nothing
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 12:03:19 But shake like a washing machine
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 12:03:30 Also it makes a nice climbing rig
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 12:03:46 Where do i post the build once im done btw?
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 12:06:25 Madlad

plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:49:56 Nuclear reactor  update when?
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:50:47 You mean solenoid
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:50:50 Like
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:50:59 That heating the air engine
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:51:08 Expanding the piston like thingy
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:51:29 Or steam as in release steam in a piston to make it move
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:51:49 I dont get why you people have rage against shredders
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:51:53 Just like
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:51:58 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:52:08 You mean randomly attacking during pvp or smthing
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:52:44 Spawnkilling gay
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:54:10 Shredders are fine in my opinion but now they feel as original as someone making an f-15 from a youtube tutorial,and then you jokingly call it harrier and then they get mad and start saying some facts they read off of the internet for five minutes
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:55:06 Again
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:55:10 Spawnkilling gay
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:55:35 Kekw
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:56:04 Why were those three shreddies going to the volcano?
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:56:56 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:57:09 Welp
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:57:46 Shredders are fine and legal to me as ive been informed sooo like either make it illegal or do a patch that prevents shredders
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:58:21 Then ban shredders as weapons i guess
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:59:06 Just block them,like how i blocked someone yeeting a boeing into my  two fuselage biplane
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:59:16 The fps
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:59:18 Died
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:59:25 Along with my internet for osme reason
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:59:35 Shredder looks fun
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 15:59:58 Eh that dont help much in a roblox game
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:00:24 I mean makes sense
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:01:00 Cause ppl either bulli others or simр for them for attention
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:01:17 And cause of memes and all
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:01:42 People will preffer to bully for attention of a female gameh gorl
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:02:02 Cause simрing is beta
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:02:33 I dont even pvp
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:02:38 I just like to build
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:03:08 I just do the normal cyber bullying thing
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:03:27 And not use my lvl 999 edgelord grinders i befriended a day ago
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:06:51 Anti shredder
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:06:55 My favorite
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:07:10 Although i like to make those more condensed
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:07:19 So they explode like a landmine
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:07:23 Upwards at high speeds
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:07:34 Oh you dont glitch yourself
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:07:40 Simple solution
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:08:03 Eject your seat at high speeds away from spawn and parachute and then click the detonation button
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:09:53 I mean why are shredders so mainstream
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:10:01 Like is there no other better version
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:10:10 All the shredders are the same and uncreative
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:10:30 Jets are comonly lame unless someone knows how to build
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:10:47 Cause i keep seeing the damn f-15 everywhere
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:11:19 That and some idiot with a boeing just extending his tail onto my build area
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:11:30 Giving me spazms
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:11:39 With my already 15 fps engine
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:12:22 I mean isnt there someyhing better idk man
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:12:26 Two way shredder?
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:12:34 Hidden shredder jet
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:12:45 Shredder rockets
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:14:11 Im planning on making a moving base

plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:36:47 There a lock system?
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:37:17 My engine with no locking gives me 12-20 fps
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:37:31 At low speeds
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 16:38:10 So like 2 motors have enough strenght to hold a whole ship perfectly

plane-crazy 2021-02-17 21:45:01 
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 21:45:07 The mid area is the crosshead
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 21:45:15 I added the joint there
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 21:45:37 But despite that the top still has angular motion from the crankshaft
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 21:45:55 Half wedes dont work
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 21:46:02 Wedges
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 21:46:11 Nice imagination but no
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 21:47:21 Il 2 has uhhh a rear seat gunner
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 21:47:31 So the mid of the fuselage has to be a bit longer
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 21:47:55 Still doe make it long enough to accomodate a gun even if you wont add it
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 21:48:22 Add uhhh half wedge from half blocks to the sides
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 21:48:40 So it isnt square

plane-crazy 2021-02-17 21:49:24 Eh kinda
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 21:49:53 Make sides half block and front wedge should be half wedge down 2
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 21:50:09 It will make it slimmer
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 21:50:27 Its not that square
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 21:50:42 It appears in blind
plane-crazy 2021-02-17 21:51:15 Half wedge thingy in half blocks above half wedge 2

plane-crazy 2021-02-19 08:46:01 F-15's in this game are equivalent to ebr's in war thunder

plane-crazy 2021-02-19 08:47:20 Im  uninstall
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 08:47:23 Now
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 08:47:32 Where alt f4 on phone
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 08:47:48 But whose daf
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 08:47:49 Dad
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 09:14:22 You start by placing blocks
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:27:21 Alright
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:27:35 I just sped up the process on my 2 tact and dropped it for now
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:27:36 Cause
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:27:38 Turns out
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:27:52 1.5k blocks does not work well on my shitty internet
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:28:13 And it was so large i doubt it would have fit onto a mech
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:28:31 It became so heavy it stopped moving like a washing machine
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:29:25 And the 2-t version can withstand more torque but can only do speed 10 and still has issues cause roblox is too dum dum to switch the types of motions properly
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:29:56 So that being said imma just make my mech
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:30:05 And good ideas for multi legged designs
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:30:17 That can like turn if possible
creations-chat 2021-02-19 22:33:04 Gimme multi legged legs ideas that look cool on giant moving forts
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:34:40 Cause its suspended
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:34:52 Maybe weight
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:35:30 Remove the fender
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:35:33 Change shapes man
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:35:41 Maybe the motors jam the spring
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:35:49 Make multiple designs
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:36:02 Or change stats
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:36:07 Idk then
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:36:12 Try helium
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:36:45 I never follow tutorials properly
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:37:00 I always make my own worse chinese spinoff that breaks after 2 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:39:33 Trial and error
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:44:39 No
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:44:50 Redesign
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:45:05 And find a better structure
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:45:18 Maybe add more springs
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:45:22 Save and reload?
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:45:38 Then just dew it till it works
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:45:45 If it aint broke dont fix it
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:45:56 Check what it gets stuck on
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:46:09 Slow the speed down
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:46:26 Slow speed and see if it still happens
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:46:54 General speed idk idc
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:46:59 Just make it slow
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:47:01 Er
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:47:03 Than before
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:47:11 And then check if it still gets snagged
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:48:42 A half track
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:48:59 Uhmmm check irl suspension i gues
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:49:00 S
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:49:07 See how you could replicate
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:49:26 Usually when i dont know how to make a part i just find and irl example and try to replicate it
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:49:40 Make better suspension then
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:49:50 You dont need to follow a tutorial to the bone
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:50:12 Maybe get higher suspension
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:50:23 Do you need alot of trunk area
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:50:47 Maybe it hits a motor or something
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:51:19 Maybe play around with rope and spring

plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:55:54 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:57:02 Wings are inverted gull
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:57:09 Like corsairs but the fuselage aint
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:57:12 D.520
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:57:14 Uhhh
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:57:48 Doesnt the d.520 have dihedral wings
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:57:53 And not inverted gull
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:58:11 Build the caproni's barrel plane lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:58:25 Yeh the wings are supposed to be dihedral
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:58:43 Slightly upwards angled
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:58:47 Is dihedral
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:58:56 Like 7° or smthin
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 22:59:26 
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:00:47 Ignore the wing position on some cause they can wary
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:00:55 Apart from 3 up
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:01:26 And anhedral cause nobody is mental to put anhedral at bottom of fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 23:02:11 Also f.520 is really nice to fly in war thunder

plane-crazy 2021-04-18 16:12:41 it only took me 2 hours
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 16:12:53 but i finally realised how tank suspension works
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 16:13:12 the design i tried to use was way too stiff
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 17:06:45 
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 17:07:04 hmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 17:07:21 i could have made dem overlap i think

plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:20:18 blueprints have flaws too ya know
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:20:34 imagine copying everything and then having a problem spark
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:20:44 boatbuilders for e.g.
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:20:51 cant rely on blueprints
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:20:54 100%
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:20:58 cause when they scale it up
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:21:04 some measurements screw up
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:21:31 you use blueprints and yer brain

plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:23:06 almost done with my so far most compact but effective christie sus
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:23:15 on size 3 wheelies
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:23:43 smoll
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:23:55 yeh tail feels iffy
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:24:19 goes too tall too soon i guess
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:24:41 yeh
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:24:46 tail is steeper
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:25:06 and tips of the wings
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:25:12 like the backside
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:25:16 are angled
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:25:28 and the uhm reverse flap things i forgot the name of
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:25:47 the black colouring at the front of the wings
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:26:00 slats
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:26:02 jeez
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:26:05 slats are missin
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:26:13 but its kinda hard to replicate

plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:26:39 
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:26:57 the plane dont have all of these
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:27:07 slats are the little poo that helps turning
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:27:19 they are at the front and they are pushed outwards
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:27:37 kinda like how flaps lower speed but improve maneuverability
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:28:19 
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:28:25 not drastically
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:28:27 but yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:28:39 they b opened during turns
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:28:42 yeh

plane-crazy 2021-04-20 07:31:15 needs more buildup

plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:28:23 experimenting with horisontal suspension
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:29:13 
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:29:15 any ideas
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:29:37 rip
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:30:06 no the colour is just to see better
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:30:11 ill fix it later
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:32:25 breaking news
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:32:33 2 ways horisontal suspension works
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:32:46 although this makes it closer to the american vvss suspension
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:33:05 rip
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:34:15 all ya need to know rly lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:36:17 imma try to connect 2 wheels
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:48:51 
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:48:55 this kinda works
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:49:09 but its also too tall
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:49:11 suspension
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:49:47 springs just reposition
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:50:01 the joint between the wheels is the bouncy part
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:51:08 
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:51:16 something like this but its actually not this
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:51:38 also speaking of that....i sidetracked
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:52:49 one go up
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:52:54 the other one go down
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:53:01 im just prototyping
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:53:14 cuz vertical christy suspension takes up too much height
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:53:25 aka this
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:54:36 
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:54:38 this is what i was aiming for
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:54:40 weebs
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:55:41 spring pushes and pulls horisontaly
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:55:56 and the joint between the wheels is kind of a pendulum
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:56:51 https://tenor.com/view/fall-down-ouch-seesaw-faceplant-bounce-gif-14284886
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:57:04 this is whats gonna happen
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:58:01 huh so someone did make it
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:58:03 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 08:59:37 great...now i gotta replicate it reeh
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 09:05:11 ok alrd got a prob with replicating
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 09:05:18 seems the system is rather wide
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 09:34:13 
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 09:34:36 as compact as it can be (not but i like it)
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 09:34:50 2 more solo wheels and that would be the full lenght
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:46:50 allrighty i managed to fix my mistake
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:46:56 and the suspension works
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 14:47:23 now its time to mess it up further 😄
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 16:17:55 i ran into a tiny problem with my attempts
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 16:18:14 the problem is connected suspension
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 16:18:21 if i attach the rear suspension to the mid
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 16:18:30 it kinda gets stuck
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 16:18:41 and pulls the mid wheels all the way up
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 16:27:14 me thinks me should go bacc to christie suspension
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 17:03:22 eh
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 17:06:19 eh
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 17:06:21 also
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 17:06:29 redoin the suspension...again
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 17:07:29 imma just make it a separate suspension or smthing im getting tired of this

plane-crazy 2021-04-21 08:16:34 i managed to make some poor attempt of a suspension
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 08:16:43 its quite compact from the outside
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 08:16:59 however due to its complexity its a nightmare to copy to the other side
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 08:17:04 i mean its cramped
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 08:17:09 so its annoying
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 08:17:50 nice

plane-crazy 2021-04-21 08:18:17 reeeh

plane-crazy 2021-04-21 08:18:57 and i have to use russian doctorine to prevent the springs from twisting the shafts holding the wheels
plane-crazy 2021-04-21 08:19:52 aka slap on a piece of metal and let the mud grabbie thingy stop em

plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:50:23 afk
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:51:31 simple
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:51:34 replicate it
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:51:40 via doors
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:51:44 2 wheels
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:51:47 and motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:52:19 and i might have a migrane
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 16:52:48 whats that config to edit block
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 17:13:43 i might try torbs tracks
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 17:13:45 they b lit
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 17:14:10 hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 17:14:51 imma try to mess with dem wheels a bit doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 17:22:25 suck it ik its herrguggi's idea
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 17:22:30 jeez
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 17:57:00 still not a fan of fully detached susp-ension
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 17:57:53 like the hull being detached from the axle n crap
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 17:58:45 no i mean the suspension just holds the top of the hull
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 17:58:51 idk how to explain
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 17:59:03 it looks weird to see a car that floats on suspension
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 17:59:22 also you talked on 4th 20th 2021
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 17:59:34 last month too
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 17:59:42 idk whats up with the 2 years thing
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 17:59:58 i like the joint tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:00:13 still doe dont put the thing in a car that looks iffy
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:00:20 like floats on springs
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:00:29 when you make something round hte test
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:00:59 yeh yeh i used the uni joint for my engine piston prototype
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:01:13 cause cylinder does not like sliding
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:01:38 i think imma make a train on tracks
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:01:51 i feel like someone alrd did that but whateves
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:02:05 knew it
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:02:13 aww
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:02:56 also the weird thing bout that
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:03:00 the spring
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:03:08 is that it cant bend left or right
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:03:12 kinda annoying
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:03:27 can we possibly get a remodeling of the spring
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:03:35 looks kinda generic
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:04:00 i mean understandable point and we can use motors to go around it but when i first used it it was so confusing for me
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:04:07 thought it was gonna movel ike a slinky
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:04:23 https://tenor.com/view/dr-zoiberg-slinky-sad-on-fire-burn-gif-14175297
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:05:04 yeh
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:05:07 also question
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:05:16 how to properly fix christie suspension tracks
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:05:18 like
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:05:22 the always bend
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:05:29 due to weight of my builds
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:05:39 and even with helium
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:05:50 upon contact on the ground the always bend a little
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:08:07 
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:08:10 this
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:08:32 although i like making it more complex by making them horizontal to save on height
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:08:37 not that it takes up much
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:36:51 made herguggi's suspension
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:36:56 tracks*/
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:37:02 it works good
plane-crazy 2021-05-14 18:37:10 could make a great conveyor belt
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 06:50:20 just make an idler wheel
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 06:50:36 nah it be tri shreddie
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 06:56:30 idk and i dont think so
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 06:56:41 lift is weaker on ctrl surf
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 06:57:18 i wonder if there is propulsionn by moving the wing panel like a handheld fan and propelling things forward
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 07:12:06 damn
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 07:12:19 i bet we could commision an artist
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 07:13:39 ok ima,anyways i am mental
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 07:14:24 cause i made the sprocket and idler higher up
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 07:14:45 i might do what kv did
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 07:15:07 
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 07:15:08 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 07:16:12 
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 07:16:16 never made tracks b4
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 07:16:32 how to shorten them then
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 07:16:48 those are 2x2 x2 with 3x3
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 07:17:24 can i make a functioning sprocket wheel
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 07:17:33 cause im planning to put suspension on these
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 07:17:48 or maybe use little wheels like on the kv
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 07:27:42 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 07:27:46 pucker up
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 07:36:43 ???
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 07:40:54 yeh i might need to remake the whole thing
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 08:23:36 how do you tension btw
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 08:24:03 does it have to be that complex with motorlocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 08:24:16 f
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 08:24:40 ik ik thats how it works
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 08:24:46 but i never made a tracked one
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 08:25:02 i only made suspension and my first time attempts kinda screwed up
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 08:25:11 effe
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 08:41:32 issue
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 08:41:40 jk
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 08:41:45 i like exposed motors
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 09:26:25 still cant make a thight track system rip
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 09:27:11 used motorlock to extend both the sprocket and idler quite alot
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 09:29:26 a van
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 09:53:34 
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 09:53:36 oof
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 09:53:40 welp learned motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 09:53:42 uhm
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 09:53:47 best attempt so far
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 09:55:06 also no im not mounting a tank on this
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 09:55:10 ...im mounting a train
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 09:55:46 i have one question about motorlock though
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 09:56:01 how will i attach everything to a single frame
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:09:21 srsly though
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:10:56 wb them
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:11:09 i dont need invisible  blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:11:25 i need all of these to fit on a single body frame
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:11:34 andi used motorlock to stretch em out
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:12:00 so can i just replicate the motorlock on the frame im attaching it to to kinda
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:12:04 yeh zachs threadies
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:12:28 they were the simplest for me
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:12:34 so i kinda went with those
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:13:51 
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:14:03 ignore the suspension its temporary they will be separate
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:29:50 why not
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:40:35 
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:40:37 too tight
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:40:42 getting warmer though
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:50:29 should i always make tracks tight or let them be a bit loose
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:52:08 ok good news the tracks work pretty good
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:52:13 bad news the suspension sucks
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:52:25 if only we had a torsion bar
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:57:03 
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:57:09 yeetus i managed
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 10:57:21 welp thats enough for today see ya

plane-crazy 2021-05-15 15:33:41 ok ok what if i cut on cost
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 15:33:53 what if i make tracks but without suspension
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 15:34:03 and with smoller wheels
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 15:34:27 kinda like a CAT
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 15:35:09 ok someone pick
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 15:35:11

plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:32:42 like part on part
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:33:11 anything with tracks messes my framerate
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:33:29 no
plane-crazy 2021-05-15 17:33:37 i wanna make a train on treads

plane-crazy 2021-05-16 08:12:04 well he needs it
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 08:12:17 you should see the railway it passs through
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 08:26:29 have fun
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 08:55:06 ok how trash is this setup
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 08:55:39 i should prolly try and fit bigger return rollers
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 08:55:47 but i cant due to space
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 08:55:48 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 08:56:28 it works doe
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 08:58:21 i think so
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:00:23 what type of tracks in terms of shape would be fitting for a train
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:00:52 why wouldnt it
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:01:19 
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:02:08 uhhh

plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:02:16 it has a water tank
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:02:20 and its on tracks
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:02:32 so its a tank to me but you can call in a trank
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:03:02 are you seriously tryna debate logic in a creationist game
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:03:25 when we cant even have normal track links
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:04:02 so far i have 2 designs
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:04:07 one fully flat
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:04:18 and one with return rollers
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:04:25 neither have suspension cause im mental
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:04:29 ill try that later
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:05:13 2 smoll booms make one medium boom
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:09:21 make the turret above whatever you want and use motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:09:27 what can i say except
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 09:09:45 i only started motorlocking properly like yesterday

plane-crazy 2021-05-16 10:38:54 like lenghtwise
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 10:39:00 2 7's make 14
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 10:39:02 that way
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 10:39:26 cause i constantly need to make it into a scaffold way then erase the excess like im 3d printing
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 10:39:43 agreed
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 10:40:13 rotating never works
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 10:40:26 its like a cheap tellie with cathodes
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 10:40:37 it either works when you hit it or it doesnt
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 10:40:44 and sometimes it just turns on by itself
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 10:41:04 anyways im making the train on tracks but this time imma make the hull first
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 10:49:53 
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 10:49:58 is it tall enough
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 17:08:17 am i trippin or were the motor adjustments augmented
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 17:54:42 k just in case you check
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 17:54:51 use rockets and motors and dont be seyo
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 17:54:59 and make block joints
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 17:55:08 anyways
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 17:55:15

plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:23:29 axe bow
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:26:15 like the breakwater
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:26:17 ahhhhh
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:26:18 ok ok
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:26:34 backwards?cant really tell
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:27:51 
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:32:14 i think you should not go with a flat transom unless its a minelayer
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:32:56 oh ok
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:33:01 uhhhhhh bulbous bow
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:33:10 or none
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:33:13 depends what era
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:33:17 ok so no bulb
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:33:42 well british had boats without bulbs and with bulbs
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:33:45 so kinda like
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:33:47 gay
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:34:15 you should get a curved breakwater then
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:34:44 Oh on deck!
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:34:46 uhhh
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:34:56 the castle shoulb be elevated and angled
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:35:22 see how yamatoe is curved
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:35:50 well do that and you can also do what italians did
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:36:11 and make a deck water stoppin area so it doesnt get to the deck near the guns
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:36:59 people rarely use the axe bow
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:37:03 for battleships
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:37:05 irl
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:37:11 cause of water spread
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:37:26 since the water can easily get on the deck and potentially inside the guns
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 17:38:00 good build 😄

plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:10:28 i make a build,discover something new,then move on
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:10:47 yall are too sentimental to your builds
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:11:15 define hard work
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:11:28 you dont say
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:11:38 define effort
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:12:15 i build on impule and do what i like doing,to me it isnt hard work if i try to get something to work if i like tweaking with it
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:12:43 so in my terms i havent built anything with hard work.by your def i prolly did
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:12:54 yeh
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:13:02 playing a building game isnt a chore
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:13:33 i wanted to make suspension
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:13:38 so i googled how it actually worked
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:13:50 week later while playing with wheel types n crap i put on some tracks
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:14:01 later i built a tracked vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:14:04 the end
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:14:20 same goes with minecraft rly
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:14:31 how
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:14:49 just cause im not attached to a build it doesnt mean i didnt put in effort and that its a big deal
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:15:05 its like designing a tank and then get angry that it got shot by the enemy
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:15:14 or repair a track only for its pin to break
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:15:22 thats just life
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:15:42 what could i use a train on tracks for?
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:15:59 i learn and i implement,then abandon or store for later purpise
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:19:22 sa building that you dont waste currency for,is not the same as a child
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:20:25 yes

plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:20:37 you will have plenty of fun in the future
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:20:50 once you finish the build and drive it around its just used for flexing
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:20:53 unless its pvp
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:21:06 well not rly
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:21:29 you just have fun with your little kidnapping van then you store it for eternity
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:21:34 while your work on something else
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:21:54 if we got a wipe i could just rebuild something i wanna visit again
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 16:21:58 and maybe improve it

plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:42:53 and more lag
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:43:20 i want better angles i preffer to make builds with less motorlocks
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:43:27 cause idk i like the stability
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:43:45 although motorlocking is but a minor problem....then again there are those days...
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:44:16 yeh that can happen too
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:44:45 ya know whats fun at low tier

plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:46:41 yeh
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:46:46 thats the downpoint
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:46:55 it would take a while
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:47:17 i feel limmited with the compactness
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:47:21 like suspension
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:47:24 then tracks
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:47:28 type of suspension
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:48:01 for a good suspension+tracks on a vehicle like vertical volute you need space
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 17:48:23 also make map prettier ik its a crash course but damn i hate the terrain colours

plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:29:50 also fronch got some nice mbt's
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:30:34 and the late amx series

plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:56:53 if i saw this in ww1
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:57:21 in toss a nade in the opening between the turret and the mantlet
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:57:44 hmmm....i havent made an actual turret now that i think abt it
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:59:00 pvp gay
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:59:04 just shred
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:59:14 i like to make mechanical components
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:59:28 sleep pft
plane-crazy 2021-06-16 18:59:39 evenin
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:11:57 these people do be usin springs to hold their piston heads level hmmm....i mean its more compact when its like that
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:12:03 couldi  use motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:12:13 to make a V engine but use those springs hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:14:09 although I do have a small complain to 1raq's newest engine
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:14:24 how the hell does the exaust work down there
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:14:35 its below the piston head
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:14:43 how are ya supposed to do da expansion
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:15:08 an engine cant work like that
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:17:19 banana
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:31:59 fuel tank
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:32:45 a detachable fuel tank thats made aeodynamic to reduce drag
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:34:20 its meant for long voyages
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:34:26 make it if ya feel like it
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:35:22 
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:36:19 
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:36:40 ez
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:45:39 slow down
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:45:43 whats the issue
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:45:52 6 words or less
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:47:02 eh
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:47:27 are pontoons out so i can finally get em and build a boat
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:47:52 reeeh
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:51:20 how
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:51:24 how can we help
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:51:31 6 words or less
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:51:58 well its unbalanced
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:52:34 unbalanced
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:52:41 make it equal
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:52:45 oh wait
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:52:48 no grav
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:52:54 hmm u usin hoveroos
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:53:30 "You are confusing mass with weight. Mass is the "amount of stuff" that is constant in whatever gravitational field the object is in -- even in 0g. ... The object is lying on a flat, frictionless surface."
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:54:01 dont worry I failed physics <:smilethumbsup:801475467844386817>
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:55:40 mhm
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:55:45 send pics
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:56:09 "Mass is a measure of how much matter an object contains, while weight is a measure of the force of gravity on the object. An object has the same composition, and therefore mass, regardless of its location. For example, a person with a mass of 70 kg on Earth has a mass of 70 kg in space as well as on the moon."
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:56:20 and in an area without air ressitance
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:56:24 its harder to stop
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:56:35 meaning and energy disbalances mess it up
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:57:05 if u push the fat kid in space its gonna take more energy to stop it than an anorexic kid
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:57:32 thats why with enough force you could push the moon
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:57:43 uhh violently turns or tiltsl eft?
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:57:55 like describe on what axis it speens
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:58:11 
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:59:28 so it yawns
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:59:48 send link so i can send u a dislike
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 15:59:57 anyways back to quarantino tarantino
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:00:21 yeh
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:00:34 hardl eft yaw
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:00:37 yeehaw
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:00:48 u sure its weight and output is rite
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:00:52 what propells it
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:01:05 what makes its yaw left and right in terms of powa
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:01:35 this is why we make prototypes of what we wanna use as a source
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:01:40 nice table
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:01:54 thrusters?
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:02:11 wait in zero grav do planes have air ressistance?
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:02:21 wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:02:25 if yes then wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:02:28 are likley the cause
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:02:55 
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:03:03 inverted sesquiplane <:kek:607984205661602101>
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:03:28 aight if i learned something from halfassery
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:03:37 its that if it tilts left too much
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:03:46 you just gotta either add more power or weight to one side
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:03:51 to balance it
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:04:15 E.G. the A6M2 zero actually rolls and turns slightly faster to left
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:04:48 make fun of that all you want caproni be one of the people responsible for jet age
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:05:51 ngl someone should make this
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:05:58 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:06:11 it actually flew
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:06:12 lel
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:06:14 not well doe
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:06:34 looks neat
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:06:41 uhm like i said
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:06:49 experiment with weight and power output
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:07:04 and maybe allow a bit of gravity
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:07:11 make small scale thingy
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:07:14 then tweak it
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:07:18 thats how things work
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:08:27 
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:08:27 HMMM
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:09:32 
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:09:36 HMMMM2
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:11:45 so many interesting designs yet people make F-22's on a daily basis
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:12:42 speed weed
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:12:56 ngl I need to get better at motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:13:20 i am pretty much a noob only using it to place a thing here and there
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:15:22 imagine if friction was added to game

plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:15:43 builds b like
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:16:36 i dont like replicating planes cause i suck at following the damn thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:16:54 unless its an ikea manual cause for some reason i actually follow those
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:17:13 took me like 15 minutes to differentiate boards for a bed and where they were supposed to be exactly
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:36:55 i wanna take a lancaster hull
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:37:01 and just make something mental
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:38:19 pmuch
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:43:28 k i was thinking

plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:44:44 high swept wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:45:04 and bottom side gun area simmilar to what you see on german planes
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:45:36 its an impractical piece of trash and thats why i find it good
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 16:47:16 and different cockpit

plane-crazy 2021-06-17 19:17:04 but without
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 19:17:07 springs
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 19:17:11 the pistons gotta be free
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 19:17:20 free moving
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 19:18:37 it is possible to make a springless free moving piston
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 19:18:41 since i did an inline
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 19:18:48 although idk bout
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 19:18:57 V shape

plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:32:02 hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:32:04 tank tracks
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:32:07 but out of gold...
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:41:27 Dont you just love when the internet is crap and the autosave is broken

plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:47:52 huzzah
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:47:56 my first chopper ever
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:48:05 it wiggles more than yer mum
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:48:06 jk
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:48:17 it can prolly do it
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:48:35 thing is its left to right is trach
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:48:37 trash
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:48:46 and it cant do tricks apart from going submarine
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:49:34 it can
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:49:40 it just isnt kewl enough
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:49:41 also
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:49:55 why cant it speen with rotor alone
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:50:04 like put some motors for angles
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:50:08 one speen rottor
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:50:24 and angle i
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:51:56 someone get me code for chinese ww2 planes
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:52:01 colour
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:53:54 ok mr gay facts
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 18:57:00 like a smooth criminal
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:32:22 do i need pontoon thingy for sub
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:32:23 s
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:32:34 star engine
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:32:51 wth
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:32:56 its a type of engine
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:32:59 with a triangle
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:33:03 instead of a piston
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:33:24 make one of those big solenoids
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:33:44 also again can i make submarines without the pontoon blocks
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:33:51 like just using ballast and idk rotors
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:34:14 also tht blimp guy inspired me to try to make one again
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:34:19 last time it didnt go so well
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:35:23 GOD DAMN YOU AERO
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:35:45 do i need pontoons for sub cause i didnt get them for the summer
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:36:10 
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:36:18 cause you need it to float somehow
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:36:28 and ballast empty and fill etc.
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:37:03 yeh imma wait for summer then
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:37:19 time to blimp it i guess
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:37:32 ill prolly just make a floating trash pile then just detail the engine lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:37:46 done a blimp 😄
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:38:04 you mean delayed updates?
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:39:25 ?watch me
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:40:01 test
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:40:02 no internet
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:41:07 ya know what these babes are full off
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:41:31

plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:42:03 nice koka
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:42:21 ok now i need to learn how to make circle for blimp
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:42:27 kms
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:42:35 actually
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:42:40 imma make the engine first
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:43:17 i could make 2 narrow blimps then connect em
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:43:44 ik
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:43:57 but blims with a bunch of mini props arent
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:46:57 guys i appear to be mentally ill
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:47:11 how do i make a 5x5 circle
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:47:30 by 5 x 5 i mean 2 on each end
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:47:33 and 1 center
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:48:16 wanted to make a round bomber engine but i guess thats not hpapenin
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 07:49:23 help...

plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:21:28 it has a somewhat air intake at the bottom
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:21:30 like a cooler
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:23:02

plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:36:41 was thinking
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:36:49 2 narrow ones connected together
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:37:34 like more tall than round
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:38:03 hmmmm
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:38:05 kinda
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:38:09 but 2 of those

plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:41:59 was thinking
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:42:21 2 narrow blimps,with a gondola suspended below between
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:42:37 with 2 of those somewhat radial wannabe engines that will also hang
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:42:50 and a V-6 shaped engine on the rear of gondola
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:42:59 you arent
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:43:06 you can however use the iron cross
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:43:20 and that german flag but instead of funneh hindu u use the cross
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:43:46 you can use this
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:44:03 hindu sun or the inverted hindu sun
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:44:08 he can use the one with dots
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 08:44:55 the speen one

plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:49:35 made a useless lump just to waste your time
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:49:42 is it interesting for a balloon doe
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:50:31 inter continental ballistic missile?
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:58:29 aight made the bottom into a fuel tank and an attachement to the balloon
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 09:58:37 so the lump has some use
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 10:13:44 
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 10:13:46 general shape
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 10:14:15 ill need 2 of these now the thing is...how far apart will these two be
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 10:14:35 also the brown thing can be one of the 3 things
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 10:14:43 some sort of weight1
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 10:14:47 fuel tank

plane-crazy 2021-06-20 10:15:19 out of 2 balloons
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 10:16:55 if they are wide doe might add a small 3rd balloon in mid
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 10:17:04 colour is just to see better
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 10:17:07 for me\
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 10:19:21 russians
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 10:42:39 who
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 13:55:32 was gonna make a bomber like tail for blimp but i changed my mind and decided to connect it to the body
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 13:57:22 how to make motor flaps
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:01:39 i am mostly on the ground
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:02:05 ik how to make it but idk how to make it flush
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:02:55 i could use a trail but thats not good enough
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:05:28 
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:05:31 good enough lol\
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:05:54 that is a really chonky catalina
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:06:10 oh good
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:06:36 ive read something bout catalina so i assumed you made an obese one
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:09:18 guess imma mess round with motors
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:13:03 nvm realised the horros i can do
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:13:12 time for google
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:26:24 yeh saw it like 50 times alrd
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:26:40 uhhh imma just ignore the flaps issue 4 now and go follow impulse
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:27:12 should i have suspended engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:27:22 or should i have like one long like of rotating blades
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:27:58 y
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:28:21 
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:30:52 was thinking of either suspended engines below or to the side
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:30:54 or
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:31:10 a bunch of blades rotating on the same rod
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:31:18 and then get connected to an engine
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:31:54 this was supposed to be more of a rigid type byt idk at this point
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:33:18 nah
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:33:27 gonna put another one next to it
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:33:33 prolly something between em
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:33:36 and a gondola below
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:33:38 smthing like dis
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:34:03 
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:34:14 this config i pressume
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:34:16 not exactly
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:35:38 k imma try smthin
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:36:11 crap ill need props that spin differently doe
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:37:19 i dont have room i think
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:46:15 
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:46:21 ofc the engine will be at the end
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:46:27 but should i do it like this?
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:46:33 or like a suspended engine
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:47:06 btw due to joints the speed of movement is slowest to fastest left to right
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:47:17 ik
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:47:22 ik
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:47:34 this is the prototype
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:47:39 its not the practical part
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:47:53 so should i do it like this or make a suspended push n pull
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:48:53 d
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:48:53 wdym it dont look goo
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:49:03 fine so i should do this blade thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:50:07 none of them actually move together which is nice
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:50:14 the speed differential is a bit annoying
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:50:22 but it also gives it charm
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:52:14 ok now what type of engine should i use to hold em <@!696225961783459871>
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 14:52:18 round

plane-crazy 2021-06-20 15:37:55 okay
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 15:38:43 shape,colour will change
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 15:38:55 imagine that like primer

plane-crazy 2021-10-30 15:54:49 and frankly the colours are an eyesore
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 15:55:05 k onto the mechanics
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 15:55:43 
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 15:55:50 dis v4
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 15:56:17 dis i4
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 15:56:50 and this is a boxer engine
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 15:56:55 ok just so you know
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 15:57:21 if you post it as V-4 you will rack a ton of downvotes and most likley recieve death threats from seasoned snobs
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 15:57:54 you can make the boxer
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 15:58:00 ok
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 15:58:21 first things first bunime
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 15:58:30 your cylinder is bad
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 15:58:33 its a square
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 15:59:01 secondly your piston heads are moving like they are asking what is love
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 15:59:09 https://tenor.com/view/what-is-love-jamming-driving-car-gif-4770891
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 15:59:40 next your connecting rod is way smaller than it should be
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 15:59:54 in roblox it makes the piston head wiggle more
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:00:23 i cant see inside but i bet you have some joint issue in the piston head
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:00:35 next
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:00:46 what the hell are the things on the side supposed to be
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:00:58 idc about experience we are here to improve
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:01:26 the crankshaft?
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:01:39 oh my god
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:01:45 there is no crankshaft
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:01:54 i just now noticed
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:02:03 plus it switched its rotation to reverse
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:02:10 all of the pistons are synched...
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:02:53 yo i cant find my engine posts from creations
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:02:59 ok to fix list
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:03:04 make the damn crankshaft
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:03:09 extend the connecting rods
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:03:16 round the cylinder and the piston head
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:03:29 fix the joints so it moves properly
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:03:50 potentially in both x and y on the head to reduce the chances of getting stuck
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:04:02 but thats not canon for an engine
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:04:30 and also potential to reduce friction is to make the piston head and the cylinder
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:04:34 out of glass
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:04:58 also finally make the carter or lube oil tank just small enough for the crankshaft to not skid against it
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:05:19 the piston head needs free movement but dont give it too much
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:05:26 also experiment on low speeds high torque
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:05:31 for a start
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:05:43 i made an engine that can run at max
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:05:57 but sadly its way too tall to be good for anything
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:06:17 also tried a 2 tact diesel but thats kind of hard
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:06:30 decent
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:06:59 yeh i deleted the pictures of my engines havent played this in a while
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:07:16 plus i never finished them
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:07:21 more of an experiment or concept

plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:08:45 re arange
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:08:47 the sentence
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:08:50 so it makes sense

plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:09:10 listen
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:09:15 the longer the connecting rod is
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:09:21 the less jerking it has
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:09:43 but then its less impressive when the rod is 15 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:09:55 and then crankshaft is i dunno so small it goes down to 5 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:10:00 and thats what she said

plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:10:44 a balance between exist must
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:11:04 wait lemme search on yt i think i got a good start
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:11:18 also start from the crankshaft and piston then cylinder
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:11:30 the crankcase and cylinder block are irrelevant
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:12:14 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6141wO6TXoo smallest design
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:12:30 but it uses a spring for the piston so it sucks

plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:14:43 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNbKlcQ3_Zk and a classic
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:15:06 probably the best motion but it also uses springs so it doesnt count
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:15:23 plus its a steam engine
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:17:13 mind you that one is motorlocked
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 16:47:03 didnt ask but go ahead and show it...or explain if you didnt

plane-crazy 2021-11-01 12:39:13 ew
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 12:39:29 now do a funni cross
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 12:39:53 rekt
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:12:41 guys guess what
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:13:02 turns out if you make a proper crosshead on a 2t engine
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:13:09 it works <a:Pog:823075193962496000>
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:13:59 
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:14:07 like i messed with engines a while ago
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:14:15 and instead of making a crosshead like im supposed to
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:14:24 i made basically another piston head
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:14:37 and slapped a connecting rod that leads to another piston above
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:14:44 this is actually smooth like hecc
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:15:57 and it survived max motor
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:16:11 oh boy
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:16:14 alot of things
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:16:27 you mean star configuration engine
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:16:49 
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:16:54 aight so
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:17:07 depends on piston amount
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:17:10 there were 5 piston
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:17:22 but there were also planes like ilyushin 5
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:17:27 that had i forgot lemme check
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:17:32 2 rows + extra
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:17:47 lavochkin my bad
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:18:48 anyways they are radial engines
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:19:02 they cool down via forced air through the opening at the front
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:19:08 it cools the cylinders
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:19:26 and there were alot of fittings to change the performance of that
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:19:31 throught the world wars
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:19:39 most notably germans and japanese
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:19:45 and the american p-47
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:20:53 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_engine k gtg so here ya go
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:21:16 basically a single row shares a single crankshaft area
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:21:24 unlike an inline engine
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:21:34 from this e.g.
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:22:15 its okay
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:22:20 learning is supposed to be fun
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:22:25 google engine types and have fun
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 17:22:27 take your time

plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:21:39 you can
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:21:55 its just going to suck designing one for that
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:22:03 oh you mean mine
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:22:11 no thats a 2t engine
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:22:16 usually used on large ships
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:40:18 aight finally got fluid motion on my 2 tact
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:40:30 still not what i wanted but its a start
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:40:45 now i need to make it even smaller
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:41:00 nope
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:41:07 i just understand basic mechanics

plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:44:17 k imma start working on mark 3 engine
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:44:25 this time imma add 2
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:44:48 this is the small version
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:44:56 nah
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:45:17 ew imagine looking up tutorials
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:45:32 
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:45:41 imagine it now make it
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:45:59 eeeeeeh
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:46:09 can
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:46:10 t
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:46:24 that goes against my discrimination
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 20:46:35 gun is too ***THICC**
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:26:47 mark 3 compact
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:27:23 due to the small connecting rods it does not work as it should but it works on the basic principle of a 2t diesel
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:28:08 piston rod isnt supposed to move but it moves here
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:28:25 also had to give it another join so the strass could be relieved from the piston head
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:28:58 moves 3.5 blocks up and down
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:29:18 which again is because it's mean to be compact
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:29:41 any idea's?
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:44:25 ok the bloody thing needs work
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:44:27 but
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:44:33 its only 144 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:45:53 nice
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:46:48 
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:46:55 aight final change to model 3
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:47:27 welp im a noob at motorlock so idunno
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:47:39 oh thank god
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:47:43 make a cranksfat
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:47:49 crankshaft
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:48:47 my engine has 0 chance of having a breakdown
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:48:52 if its moving at max speed lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:49:09 which is the opposite of what a 2t engine is supposed to do
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:51:03 k correction i changed the piston head

plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:53:34 ok start low buni
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 21:53:45 after it works on low go max and check for any issues
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 13:24:08 cursed

plane-crazy 2021-11-02 20:43:15 so an inline 6?
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 20:43:24 also found an ez fix for jiggly piston
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 20:43:39 just put wedges to restrict its rotation beyond 30 degree's
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 20:43:45 45*
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 20:56:48 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 20:57:34 yo this game might actually be better than this lego stuff

plane-crazy 2021-11-02 20:59:17 nvm it wont load
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:02:00 too complex for me to immediatelly join it after i have enjoyed making weird stuff in here
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:02:03 maybe tommorow
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:13:49 ight made a small 4t 2 piston engine concept
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:13:58 time for a boxer
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:14:47 doing fine on max
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:15:58 it cant hold max speed without a malfunction for long doe
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:19:31 boxer needs a bigger crankshaft
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:20:07 i am
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:20:40 ahhh
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:20:44 <@!370594904268734464>

plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:21:48 ight
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:22:14 time to spend 15 minutes of trying to commit self die via getting my pelvis crushed by a piston
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:23:00 ...
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:23:03 ahh
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:23:14 the more i look at its crankshaft the more cursed it gets
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:24:32 actually nvm it aint that bad
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:42:43 ight made it
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:43:46 ngl so far the smallest yet
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:45:05 yeah it works!
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:45:12 prefectly smooth as well
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:46:37 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:47:21 also ***LANGUAGE*** young man
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:48:54 wait...
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:49:01 right side bottom pistons
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 21:49:28 ik they are in the middle of the thing but still lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 22:02:21 maybe to test ballance
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 22:06:17 not for subnautica leviathan
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 22:06:52 nah its good just add more detail <@!672135256958173225>
plane-crazy 2021-11-05 21:05:19 nah it good

plane-crazy 2021-11-26 23:17:54 it gets dirty
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 17:24:30 anyone ever made like a hull or bow of a carrack esque ship
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 17:24:31 
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 17:24:43 basically like a galleon but steep-er
plane-crazy 2021-11-29 17:34:08 rip
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:38:09 ayo
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:38:27 can someone show me the joint to put 2 ship halves together but the hulls are spaced apart
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:39:11 maybe they are just skilled at copying
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:39:21 or is it like insta
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:39:33 can someone help me with this
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:39:55 joint'nt
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:43:11 na bro he just has better wi fi
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:43:20 <a:trolled:861615826729041920>
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:43:49 could be since its broken
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:44:58 potentially none
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:45:31 just make a build with the worst controls you can make
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:46:23 or be like me and make ugly functional builds or pretty shell builds
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:47:03 use anchor blocks with different keys for each,its like a password
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:47:22 and make them difficult and essential for the builds structure
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:53:38 im okay with people who copy me block by block for mechanism
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:53:46 or just for a refference point
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:53:53 but instnt script copying is just lazy
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:55:41 
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:55:52 i cant make it like wider cause space
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:56:09 but should i start making it like thicker near the bottom to make it more flat hulled
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:56:32 thicker closer to keel
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:57:30 i cant use it properly
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:58:08 ye
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:58:13 concept*
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:58:43 i managed to make it smaller but i cant like motor angle large amounts n stuff
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:58:51 i need to angle an entire superstructure
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:58:59 the fore and aft castle
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:59:30 i do but its like electricity to me,much easier to understand things if you can see them
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 19:59:35 motorlock is about estimates
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:00:59 nice
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:01:08 yet you say you dont use motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:02:54 my smallest boxer concept
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:03:18 sadly due to the short shaft it does not like max speed
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:04:14 also it doesnt need those grooves i just like them there
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:05:13 it can also run away on its own by wiggling
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:17:32 helps me see better
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:17:45 also cause

plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:20:34 yeah but the purple also makes the corners kind of hard to differentiate
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:20:43 it has to be dark but not too dark and not vibrant
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:21:34 wait why are you people liking me build i expected to get immediate execution for the non motorlock wings
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:21:47 default flaps
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:21:55 <:rot:910241197321224252>
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:23:54 i also had a much bigger plane simmilar to the one i just posted but i accidentally overwrote its slot with this one
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:29:16 and looks better
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:29:22 if you do it right*
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:29:44 the one i posted needs helium
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:29:56 and its what you would expect from a ww1 type but even slower
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 16:36:25 yeah however i never really went far with it,just make an inline and motor angle it
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 17:17:00 nope

plane-crazy 2021-12-07 19:01:31 im considering making a mark 4 of a biplane thing but i need to learn motorlock cause it needs an overhaul
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 19:03:01 especially i need to learn how to hide motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 17:29:54 how do i make the front gear decent
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 17:30:09 mind you im not replicating this im just using it as an example
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 17:30:34 how do i make it decent
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 17:30:43 without like a large exposed motorlock

help 2021-12-08 17:41:39 <@456226577798135808>
help 2021-12-08 17:43:03 yes
help 2021-12-08 17:43:06 frontal gear
help 2021-12-08 17:43:19 idk how to pull it off without making the plane wide
help 2021-12-08 17:44:01 mate i didnt even start lol
help 2021-12-08 17:44:05 thats the issue
help 2021-12-08 17:44:10 yeh
help 2021-12-08 17:44:47 i can make it flat bottomed but idk how to place the landing gear that retracts halfwary in such a small space
help 2021-12-08 17:45:57 might have to increase the overall size but that should be no issue as these planes were large
help 2021-12-08 17:46:22 not really i am kind of trying to make a better version of my previous model 3 so its somewhat based off of that
help 2021-12-08 17:46:44 but this time im tryna use motorlock and thicc boi wings
help 2021-12-08 17:47:14 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/915698746069774416
help 2021-12-08 17:47:21 btw this time the front is round
help 2021-12-08 17:47:31 its mainly the engine i wanna copy and make the gear better
help 2021-12-08 17:47:48 wdym by a blueprint doe
help 2021-12-08 17:48:37 ok lets turn the page a bit and ask a better question
help 2021-12-08 17:48:49 what would you do to this
help 2021-12-08 17:48:56 in terms of structure and motorlock
help 2021-12-08 17:49:01 it has none btw
help 2021-12-08 17:50:02 F
help 2021-12-08 17:50:07 np
help 2021-12-08 17:50:55 its a caproni plane moment
help 2021-12-08 17:50:59 
help 2021-12-08 17:51:06 the frontal gear
help 2021-12-08 17:51:46 but im making it a monohull and the engines are 2 ways
help 2021-12-08 17:51:49 push and pull
help 2021-12-08 17:51:55 like my 3rd model
help 2021-12-08 17:53:21 ***ROUGHLY***
help 2021-12-08 17:53:38 better to think of it as a caproni inspired plane
help 2021-12-08 17:54:36 acutally i like the Ca.5
help 2021-12-08 17:54:44 but the nose will be a slight issue
help 2021-12-08 17:55:14 gonna turn into a ca90 lol
help 2021-12-08 17:55:50 also gonna make it inverted sesquiplane
help 2021-12-08 17:56:35 yeh ik im a newbie at motorlock so idk how to make it work
help 2021-12-08 17:57:07 this is the CA.5 you meant right
help 2021-12-08 17:57:22 i got the theory its about trial and error
help 2021-12-08 17:58:41 mm
help 2021-12-08 17:58:54 the best motorlocking i got to so far was making tracks
help 2021-12-08 17:59:00 ...on a train
help 2021-12-08 17:59:23 alright gonna plan the hull then tackle that problem later
help 2021-12-08 17:59:43 another thing is the wiring idk if i should leave it vertical or wangle it
help 2021-12-08 17:59:50 angle*
help 2021-12-08 18:00:28 also the best way to fix the upper wing leaning forward
help 2021-12-08 18:00:35 is to just place it one block ahead
help 2021-12-08 18:00:41 <:trollS:866370354805211196>
help 2021-12-08 18:00:56 curvy....
help 2021-12-08 18:01:15 hmmm....google can a plane be vulporously curved
help 2021-12-08 18:01:38 ok ok but i have a questio
help 2021-12-08 18:02:01 should i keep the engine config like this or do a twin rear hull
help 2021-12-08 18:02:13 like on a Ca5

help 2021-12-08 18:02:55

help 2021-12-08 18:04:10 cause they practical
help 2021-12-08 18:04:20 the 4 engines and a bit of helium is all thatp ower it
help 2021-12-08 18:04:22 power it
help 2021-12-08 18:04:30 it flies worse than a ww1 plane
help 2021-12-08 18:05:12 but yeah might make the blades small for the purpise of looking good since ill add plenty of motorlocked wings and rocket
help 2021-12-08 18:05:30 yes...
help 2021-12-08 18:06:44 hmm
help 2021-12-08 18:06:54 imma cry now <a:AP_CHIKA_cry:741257526389243984>

help 2021-12-08 18:07:08 the gears
help 2021-12-08 18:07:30 well the overall size of the plane is pretty realistic for its time
help 2021-12-08 18:07:43 
help 2021-12-08 18:07:47 compare to me IG
help 2021-12-08 18:08:30 yeh

help 2021-12-08 18:12:48 still doe should i keep the push n pull configuartion like the model 3
help 2021-12-08 18:12:58 or should i do the Ca.5
help 2021-12-08 18:13:17 with instead of the push config it turns into a double tail
help 2021-12-08 18:13:36 sure
help 2021-12-08 18:13:56 we seem to be on the same wavelenght plus im not stopping with model 4

help 2021-12-08 18:17:12 how the hell do i start this hull
help 2021-12-08 18:17:26 mb fuselage
help 2021-12-08 18:17:46 the nose to be specific
help 2021-12-08 18:18:07 like im thinking of adding the hood via motorlock to wedge it in
help 2021-12-08 18:18:26 ik ik ik ik
help 2021-12-08 18:18:34 The ***SHAPE*** of the nose
help 2021-12-08 18:18:42 hmm
help 2021-12-08 18:19:24 sounds easier to just slap on a half cylinder 2 and call it a day
help 2021-12-08 18:20:46 thing is 1 full and 2 half make it a bit of an issue to *round out* the front
help 2021-12-08 18:21:32 hmm
help 2021-12-08 18:21:39 moment
help 2021-12-08 18:21:53 idk if it could but worth a shot
help 2021-12-08 18:21:59 need to learn how to properly hide it

help 2021-12-08 18:23:33 left is with half blocks
help 2021-12-08 18:24:30 k so sinz is a leftist wb bosnian hagrid
help 2021-12-08 18:24:44 a joke
help 2021-12-08 18:25:10 also people keep making mini triplanes around
help 2021-12-08 18:25:27 i think the left one is more suitable
help 2021-12-08 18:25:38 but i also need to make it a bit smoother at the top
help 2021-12-08 18:26:07 the bottom can remain relatively plain for the landing gear and fuel and blah blah
help 2021-12-08 18:26:56 sadly there arent
help 2021-12-08 18:27:08 half triangle down x2 wedges

help 2021-12-08 18:27:53 ok miho
help 2021-12-08 18:28:05 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 19:08:27 
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 19:08:53 is the motorlock on the upper part woth it
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 19:45:12 
plane-crazy 2021-12-08 19:45:14 yes...
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 14:58:54 
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 14:59:02 not making the exact thing mind you
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 14:59:08 how could i start this nose
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 14:59:20 cause i would like to keep a centre
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 14:59:49 should i go with wide wedges to make it chonky or use a bit blockier approach
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 15:00:39 ah a cutter will do
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 15:00:42 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:15:35 aaaaaaaaaaaaaa

plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:19:49 made an obese 3 hulled plane
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:20:03 and rn my brain stopped functioning
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:30:09 for a big boi biplane how ugly is this,its not done mind you its just a concept so far
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:30:40 wanted to do something ca.33-ISH vaguely from memory and make it different
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:30:50 but i made it ***LUXURIOUSLY THICC***
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:31:12 should i stick with something along the lines of this fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:32:09 ill slap the upper wing later when my brain remembers the motorlock basics
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:32:39 body slam the earth
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:32:53 ok how to vaguely fix it
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:32:58 or is it like beyond repair
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:33:05 do it ill help
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:33:34 these upwards things will attach to the upper win

plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:54:21 how do i slap wing panels to half blocks to motorlock it
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:54:39 no wait
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:54:45 how to hide it afterwards
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:55:32 ok pissy missy who got warned

plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:58:09 im drinking yesterday's date yogurt
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:58:14 how 2 fix
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:58:35 my brain is malfunctioning idk how to do basic cam lock
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:58:52 thats the issue
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:59:10 i need to make this thicc plane flyable
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:59:20 and i dont want the helium issue to happen again
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 16:59:36 already yeeted it out of existance
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 17:00:05 this is what the basic thing was supposed to look like
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 17:00:11 idk if it was too thick
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 17:00:32 basically there would be 2 small ones on both sides with tails connecting a tail
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 17:01:16 kind of like this POS
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 17:04:22 i need the shape of the main fuselage first
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 17:04:30 its too CHONKY
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 17:04:48 oh wait...
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 17:05:00 better not risk it

plane-crazy 2021-12-09 17:30:22 the general shape
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 17:30:26 not the actual plane
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 17:31:12 didnt end the tail
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 17:31:26 actually its 2 blocks taking up 3 block space
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 17:31:35 1 full and 2 half
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 17:32:09 i like this bulging nose thing like a beluga
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 17:33:39 also idk how to hide motorlock properly in the winds since im gonna like need alot of wing panels and to make the shape of the wings a bit chonkier

plane-crazy 2021-12-15 22:50:55 fun fact
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 22:51:06 3rd degree burns are usually the least painful
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 22:51:22 cause most of your nerve's die
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 22:51:26 ye
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 22:51:32 2nd is allegedly the worst
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 22:51:46 eh just put some tape over it
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 22:51:55 jump in a volcano
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 22:53:01 i wonder how it would feel to run into a carbon monoxide zone
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 22:54:00 dont you like
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 22:54:03 pass out immediatelly
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 22:54:18 very low oxygen
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 22:54:29 below 16% of oxygen we lose conciousness
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 22:55:36 like running into a gas hole/pit
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 22:55:56 where the gas can just sit and not let oxygen in due to weight
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 22:56:29 yeh i think monoxide is relatively painless if in a dense area in a high amount
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 22:56:47 like that time a train got stuck inside a tunnel
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 22:56:58 and the burning coal poisoned the air

plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:07:54 the wing design looks promising but it just looks like a battle ready elongated cracker
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:08:17 or a dry bisquit for those who actually think its a slur
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:08:42 so it can float
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:09:00 give it more armour and more gun potential
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:09:08 unless its a 100% pvp build
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:09:18 in that case just leave it ugly
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:09:35 then it will do
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:09:41 add fast rotating
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:09:44 like rolling
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 19:09:51 so it can shoot at any angle fast

plane-crazy 2022-02-17 19:13:45 plus most of them would be outdated
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 19:13:57 basically only good for models

plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:50:28 oi
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:50:34 sof perfect
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:50:44 wanna hate yourself?
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:51:10 built it
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:51:23 not every detail
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:51:28 axial piston pump
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:51:48 basically the swashplate is what im worried about
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:52:05 uhhh
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:52:10 mainly hydraulics
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:53:08 
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:53:22 uhh vision ports work on that model?
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:53:28 like an IS
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:54:19 longer bulldozer
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:54:56 i mean both,im not going to build it or at least not complete it,i am just interested on how the swashplate would be made in PC
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:55:12 get to drawing
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:55:17 longer
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:55:34 <@!773287769488752653>
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:55:38 e.g.
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:55:52 it does
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:56:16 no problem swashplate
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:56:45 found a simpler image
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:57:02 slippers can be motor joins no prob
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:57:32 you can hold the pistons by using springs at the end
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:58:05 the main issue is timing which will take a bit longer to figure out,unless you just make 2 pistons,and also the swashplate
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:59:03 is it close to half done?
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 14:59:30 ok send
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 15:00:59 smoking kills
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 15:01:23 gives slight vibes of a futuristic version of a biblically accurate angel
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 15:02:00 d
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 15:02:00 feels a bit too expose
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 15:02:08 kind of ruins the smoothness
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 15:02:27 maybe make the cover a bit bigger
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 15:02:30 ah i see
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 15:10:11 uhhh depends on turret tbh
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 15:11:42 brutally honest....less than downvotes
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 15:13:08 yup
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 15:43:10 well i wont help you feel better about it

plane-crazy 2022-02-23 17:27:04 based off of a specific tanker or?
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 17:27:16 ight
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 17:27:26 you need a shorter bulbous bow then
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 17:27:52 cause tankers actually go at lower speeds
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 17:28:05 not to mention bulbous bows became shorter
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 17:28:27 cause of fuel efficiency
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 17:28:52 
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 17:29:17 basically recently with newer models it got shortened cause people realised
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 17:29:30 at slower speed you waste less fuel but then the bow doesnt do its job
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 17:29:50 so they just shorten them compared to before for fuel economy
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 17:32:06 ?
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 17:32:27 also what
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 17:32:28 
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 17:32:43 also this would be more resembling of a chemical bow nowadays

plane-crazy 2022-05-02 21:00:22 cant even design
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 21:00:28 you rely on stealing other crap
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 21:00:35 and you cant even make a good copy

plane-crazy 2022-05-02 21:21:29 ", and all the help I am getting with it on the other, the scale is pretty unbalanced."
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 21:21:46 then quit being a brat and do things without asking everyone to do it for you
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 21:22:00 stop walking and start doing
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 21:22:16 no
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 21:22:23 americans made it
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 21:22:26 its in inches
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 21:22:31 and not even a meter
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 21:22:38 its less
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 21:22:51 cause the character is like 175 on avrg i think
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 21:23:23 Based on the information in this article, it was widely accepted that the average Roblox character is roughly between 5-6 studs tall, which comes out to equal around 25-30 centimeters, or about 10-12 inches tall
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 21:23:25 <@376049059695165440>
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 21:23:28 good luck
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 21:23:53 1 stud is about equal to a real life lego stud, a character is 5 stds tall. and for a roblox character 1 stud is basically equal to 1 foot if you were to scale it up to human scales, so just use feet as your measurement system and generic units as measurements in your 3d software

plane-crazy 2022-05-03 19:42:40 pc 2 is a roose made by rickje to keep the community rolling for a bit longer
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:09:52 whats the argument
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:09:56 i just came in here
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:10:25 idk whats going on
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:10:34 but ofc air can pass through a jet engine
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:10:38 otherwise it wouldnt work
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:10:49 which one
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:11:29 this ? <@915368469724291124>
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:11:51 that would not work
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:12:17 first of all its jets are only near the rear so its front would fall
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:12:38 and secondly air resistance on the plane itself would make it difficult to be a vtol
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:13:04 its shape alone would prevent it from lifting unless you used multiple powerful non fuel efficient engines
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:13:09 which would add more weight
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:13:18 and less room for fuel and arnaments
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:13:27 i hate those planes
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:13:41 like even the stealth one
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:13:43 like ehhh
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:13:56 lack of tail is neat
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:14:09 but i dont like its boomerang thick boy shape
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:14:38 the rocket one?
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:14:43 it had a tail
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:16:07 its awful
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:16:16 its like definetly awful
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:16:30 pissburner
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:16:53 no cursing in the house of rickje
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:17:15 shut the hell up
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:17:43 
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:17:47 at least it isnt vtol
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:17:54 its too big
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:17:58 too heavy
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:18:08 and would be horrbile at turning
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:18:28 gust of wind go WEE
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:18:32 true
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:18:59 i dont like those planes
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:19:04 just keep it simple
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:19:11 or do what the swedes and french did
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:19:59 wish this game had good enough mechanics for me to make pistons
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 17:44:31 tryna build a flywheel
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 17:44:48 not hard but definetly annoying
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 17:45:17 cause there is no steam or air power
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 17:45:27 and i need want multiple pistons
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 18:38:04 just use magnets
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 18:45:01 add a stopped
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 18:45:03 stopper
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 18:46:04 like it rolls over something that only goes in one direction
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 19:16:07 make a bloody stopper so it doesnt bounce back once it passes a point
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 19:17:00 youtube
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 19:17:42 literally search for plane crazy angle locking
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:24:00 i really love how people say they dont care about downvotes in creations
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:24:04 or some crap
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:24:14 but that feels like its doing the opposite
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:24:51 depends tbh
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:25:17 alot of people decide if its not a perfect 3000 block F-22 or SU it gets downvoted
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:25:47 amogus
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:26:27 make the entire motorlocking system dissapear and add an exact replica of a minigun
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:27:08 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:27:15 he gave you a suggestion its not mandatory
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:27:20 you can also find a 3way around it
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:28:09 aight since yall intelectual
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:28:28 do i have to use motor propulsion for pistons that are supposed to push a flywheel
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:28:49 expansion process
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:29:25 can i maybe use water or magma blaster thingies
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:29:29 to propell it
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:29:36 the pistons
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:30:23 
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:30:27 ok take this
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:30:29 but now
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:30:40 add another piston 180 degrees from the other one
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:30:44 issue is motorlocking
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:31:12 i did it though
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:31:24 skill issue
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:31:32 you can put a piston inside a cylinder
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:31:42 the problem is the distance it has to cross
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:31:56 it needs bigger cylinders and a crosshead
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:32:05 so its kind of a 2 tact steam engine esque
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:32:20 i also made a boxer but its not the same as the flywheel design
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:32:42 2 pistons,propelling a flywheel 180 degree's from each other
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:33:04 then that flywheel uses a gearbox or a timing belt to the gears
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:33:14 and then propells 2 wheels on one axis
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:34:14 not really
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:34:22 closer to a boxer
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:34:58 actually no ur right <@592619320421384232>  H is asymetrical during its cycle
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:35:42 yeah but its crankshaft mode is what im gonna use
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:35:46 i already did a boxer
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:35:57 which does the same cycle on every bump
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:39:12 a back
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:39:25 more narrow
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:39:39 also i have to motorlock it to the centre
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:39:48 while the shaft is asymetrical
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:40:23 too long and too wide
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:41:04 distance of the connecting rods
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:41:20 imma just make it longer but use a crosshead
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:41:41 
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:42:08 but that takes up more space
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:42:27 i also need to figure out the dumbest way to connect a few gears
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:42:40 i just need 4 modes so its not too compicated
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:42:52 hmmm
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:42:53 probably
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:43:22 i need forward,reverse,neutral and direct connection to the flywheel
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:43:33 do gear revolutions and sizes work in game
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:44:03 
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:44:04 ye
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:44:54 ew a trimaran
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:45:09 those things just splat
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:45:23 used to like them until i went on one
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:45:47 the 2 pontoons on the side (at least on decent sized sailboats)
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:45:53 splat around like crazy
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:45:58 they look cool
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:46:01 they just suck
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:46:23 didnt say they were ugly
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:46:29 just bad
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:47:10 yes but now it looks mental
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:47:38 i want to keep it somewhat compact but not too much cause where is the fun in a design you cant watch and enjoy
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:48:00 thats why i just make engine concepts
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:48:07 instead of incasing them in blocks and other crap
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:48:11 glass isnt the same
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:49:25 hol
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:49:27 no
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:49:36 i love it
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:49:39 but also resent it
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:49:44 with every fiber
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:50:03 also just realised there is no point in 1st gear
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:50:10 cause im using 5x5 eylinder
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:51:32 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:52:34 
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:52:35 screw it
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:52:39 gonna go with this width
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:52:54 cause its gonna go through alot of alterations
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:53:10 and will likely be big
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:55:16 
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:55:21 most compact 2t
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:55:25 i made so far
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 08:55:56 would get rid off the red joint but its the only thing that keeps it from dying at high rpm
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 09:05:51 no
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 09:05:58 it needs to survive max and min all
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 09:46:20 me having issue with crosshead guides
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 09:56:28 k made a flywheel with 2 crossheads but the crossheads do almost nothing
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 09:56:49 might end up not using the 180 degree opposite side pistons
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 10:01:29 turns out plane crazy doesnt like this either
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 10:07:05 can someone find me an image of those big rigid no motorlock costum made wheels
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 10:07:14 idk if i can put a timing belt on one
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 10:25:26 aight life is not worth living anymore so imma just take a 2t 2 cyl engine and flip it on its side
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 10:55:01 guys
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 10:55:10 i just realised i did the crosshead completely wrong
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 10:55:14 the entire time lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 10:58:51 eh
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:20:47 
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:21:11 k i made a costum thingy of an engine,realistically it would be absolute trash
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:21:22 but i dont feel like doing that
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:21:53 what i need now are springs,valves,injector,camshaft and connecting rod
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:22:28 but since its based off of a 2t engine i dont need an intake valve
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:24:39 wanna see pain
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:24:42 
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:24:55 
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:25:01 not really
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:25:24 i can do a 4 cyl radial
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:25:32 i dont wanna angle
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:25:59 y'know i can just make 2 four cylinders and put them on a single shaft
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:26:10 and remove one
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:26:48 do this then
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:27:31 logic wise a radial is simple
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:27:35 but recreating it
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:28:24 hey do i have to make a timing belt for a camshaft?
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:28:31 i really dont want to
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:28:53 but gears slip and seperating the cam from crank is for losers
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:29:19 shut
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:29:35 ok imma first make a valve...
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:29:44 ...
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:29:49 god damn it
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:33:33 trial and error
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:33:45 you can also place it on a turret to aim it in a direction
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:38:58 gaem updated
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:39:12 rick
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:39:27 <@592619320421384232>  what do you think
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:39:35 i take 2 valves instead of one small
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:39:43 and put them on a same rocker
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 11:40:08 which ones
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 13:48:01 **anyone got an image of a big costum wheel?**
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 14:29:43 dont you love over engineering and then having to replicate the same thing on the other side
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 14:44:12 
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 14:44:17 ik it isnt accurate
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 14:44:19 but cmon
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 14:44:25 it looks cool
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 14:44:37 will be better once i add a pushrod
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 14:50:51 eh
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 14:51:02 it has a heavy piston and a valve
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 14:51:28 its a frankenstien of a steam, 2t and 4t engine
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 14:56:01 valve,rocker and the base for a pushrod
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 14:56:08 went a bit wild with the deisgn
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 14:56:15 in order to restrict its movement
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 14:56:40 
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 14:56:46 realistically its supposed to be like this
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:00:42 <@718409831639154718>
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:00:50 do you know anything about tank treads
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:01:04 he online?
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:01:26 i need to know what ratio i can stretch a tread
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:01:48 cause i want to bring the camshaft closer to the pushrod
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:02:59 <@702907851001167882>
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:03:07 
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:03:24 im gonna motorlock the camshaft to the green wheel
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:03:46 how long should my thread be
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:03:52 aka timing belt
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:04:25 is there like a good ratio
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:04:31 since you need to use motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:04:47 uhhh a frankensteins monster
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:04:55 a horisontal 2t engine
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:04:59 with a
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:05:10 ventilation system of both a 2t and 4t
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:05:17 since i cant use fluids or pressure
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:05:38 
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:05:40 to simplify
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:05:46 i need to make a timing belt
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:06:05 green fabric is where the camshaft will be motorlocked into
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:06:29 i can add 1 exterior wheel to put more pressure on it
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:06:40 but i dont want to waste too much time
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:06:49 it is
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:07:05 im not using gears for a camshaft
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:07:08 that is heresy
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:07:28 nor the connecting shaft motorbikes use for the rear wheel
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:07:37 that is also heresy
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:07:42 at least for an engine
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:08:03 
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:08:07 hehe belt go BRRRR
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:08:36 ok fine uhh
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:08:43 what thread type is the closest to a chain
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:08:53 and doesnt take 10 decades like herguggi's
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:09:04 sh.
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:09:36 so guggis are thinnest
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:09:53 pain
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:10:01 k imma get down to
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:10:13 y'know what
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:10:20 im gonna do a big brain
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:10:34 and instead of doing 2 camshafts imma put them both on one side
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:10:40 just so i dont have to do the track
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:10:58 and imma slap in the transmition 180 degrees on the free side
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:11:06 then reach the clouds
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:12:10 
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:12:15 time to abuse le trank
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 15:12:49 gtg for now
plane-crazy 2022-05-06 21:45:56 then stop overdetailing it

plane-crazy 2022-12-18 22:18:16 you are a gypsy
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 22:20:28 but you will work like one
plane-crazy 2022-12-18 22:30:59 not according to qatar
plane-crazy 2022-12-20 19:30:16 but speed regulation
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:16:21 are the buttons separate
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:16:29 is there enough room for the turrets
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:16:30 uhh
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:16:43 idk could just be a bug from a specific motor placement
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:17:04 so wait when was pc2 promised
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:17:07 and how game changing will it m
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:17:11 be
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:18:19 where does the seizure occur
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:18:39 have you built ships of that size before
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:18:51 you might have to rebuild the entire turret system
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:19:20 then its system issue not you
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:19:25 still you can change it probably
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:21:02 y'know what would be great for pc2
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:21:13 cirtuits and automatic activation
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:21:18 circuits
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:21:34 so you dont have to hold one button or repetitively spam the same one
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:22:05 or under certain angle a motor activates at just the right time
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:22:19 making things such as leg movement on giant robots a more fluid motion
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:22:21 at the knee bend
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:23:00 basically when the knee motor or hip motor reaches a certain angle the heel or other parts activate at just the right time to make the motion more balanced
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:23:10 or the parts get restricted to an angle so they dont go out
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:24:34 bro moving at lightspeed
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:24:58 your ping isnt doing you any favours
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:25:13 well idfk know how to fix that issue
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:25:23 most likely game bug that appeared
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:25:26 or that
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:25:36 or just plain need to fix the rotors
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:25:57 or severly limit the speed and torque
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:26:03 so it acts like an actual gun
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:27:15 torque is that of a train slamming into a kindergarten
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 12:28:09 could it be torque and friction
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 21:30:11 would wanna build a mecha but idek where one would start
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 21:30:33 step 1
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 21:30:35 make a plane
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 21:30:39 step 2

plane-crazy 2023-03-10 21:33:19 if i ever made a mecha it would be a quadpedal looking mf
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 21:33:30 with just straight up jets strapped to its back
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 21:33:39 and with a commie star slapped on a side
plane-crazy 2023-03-10 21:34:03 totally not inspired from this
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 18:50:06 if pc2 got electrical switches and crap that would be dope
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 18:52:41 imagine it though
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 18:52:44 that with gears
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 18:52:53 you could make an enigma machine
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 18:53:12 i know something else that sukcs1!11!!!

plane-crazy 2023-03-27 19:50:22 tbh yeah imma be real some good builds do get downvoted only because people with high standards are online at that time

plane-crazy 2023-03-27 19:54:00 but both fabricate crap
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 19:54:44 telling people they suck at pvp is actively engaging in insulting others
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 19:54:55 i can be racist and keep it to myself
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 19:55:03 thats still racism
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 19:55:27 then why do you continue to do it
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 19:56:08 who are you to give "delusional" a reality check
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 19:56:39 a guy with an abrams from wish
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 19:57:08 why not challenge them to pvp and teach them
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 19:57:16 or leave them alone if they do not wish to learn
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 19:57:39 and then you insult them

plane-crazy 2023-03-27 20:01:27 maybe then you will get more upvotes
plane-crazy 2023-03-27 20:02:22 there will come a day when the emergency services wont be able to find your residence and you will wish you had befriended more people
