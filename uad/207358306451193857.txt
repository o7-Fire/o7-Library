plane-crazy 2019-11-09 03:09:54 question
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 03:10:09 ok well
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 03:10:16 when winter comes, will the winter only parts come back?
plane-crazy 2019-11-09 03:12:15 interesting
help 2019-11-09 03:16:21 Anyone know a great way to make a trapezoidal wing design?
help 2019-11-09 03:16:38 Example
help 2019-11-09 03:30:38 Actually, scratch that but I have a new question
help 2019-11-09 03:30:43 What are the basics of making a helicopter in this game?
help 2019-11-09 03:33:53 Actually, I was wondering the same thing
help 2019-11-09 03:54:59 Could magnets be used for hovering?
help 2019-11-09 03:57:46 Im trying to use magnets to make this craft hover, but it doesn't seem to work. I tried both keys and also put strength on max, while enabling superstrength.
help 2019-11-16 22:07:29 Alright, so I'm trying to create this hovercraft thing using propellers. However, when I try to rotate the two propeller bits, it rotates the central component. How do I make it so that the propellers are rotated?
help 2019-11-16 22:16:26 ok thanks
help 2019-11-16 22:17:07 would ballast blocks help?
help 2019-11-16 22:17:23 by that i mean would they suffice
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 05:57:24 When is the winter event starting?
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 05:00:56 hey, for some reason the control surfaces on my planes are reversed
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 05:01:00 does anyone know how to fix
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 05:01:09 ?
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 05:01:16 how do you do that
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 05:01:23 all it says is "set controls automatically"
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 05:01:36 do i flip it over?
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 05:01:46 oh ok
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 05:03:54 The surfaces just got inverted again even though I did nothing to them
plane-crazy 2020-01-05 05:03:56 ...
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 07:35:24 What would you guys think of a space map?
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 07:35:31 Like with no gravity
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 07:36:32 even better
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 07:36:37 so we have the rocket
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 07:36:39 going up
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 07:36:45 and then it reaches space
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 07:37:14 cause I think a zero gravity thing would be super cool for building spaceships
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 07:37:54 Where do you submit ssuggetsions
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 07:39:28 ohh ok
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 07:39:37 where do you get one
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 07:40:02 kk
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 07:40:10 im not that good at building tho
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 07:40:21 that is awesome
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 07:42:15 oh my god that's amazing
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 07:44:14 i literally can't even make a proper plane
plane-crazy 2020-02-08 07:45:13 gotcha
help 2020-02-09 08:02:31 The control surfaces for me are screwed up
help 2020-02-09 08:02:40 How do I fix them?
help 2020-02-09 08:05:08 Whenever I try to use automatic controls for my control surfaces they don't line up correctly and break (get jammed in one spot)
help 2020-02-09 08:05:23 I have to use pre-set controls which makes it far less agile
help 2020-02-09 08:09:38 Does anyone have a possible fix?
help 2020-02-09 08:09:56 kk
help 2020-02-09 08:10:08 What about a short video

help 2020-02-09 08:19:15 I just want mouse control
help 2020-02-09 08:19:36 but the control panels are being super weird
help 2020-02-09 08:20:46 How exactly would I configure it? Give it a key as input for a sec and then change it back?
help 2020-02-09 08:21:55 I reconfigured everything
help 2020-02-09 08:21:59 it still doesn't work
help 2020-02-09 08:22:02 Is this an issue with the game?
help 2020-02-09 08:22:20 Ok
help 2020-02-09 08:23:08 Nope
help 2020-02-09 08:23:27 I replaced it and didn't configure anything
help 2020-02-09 08:23:33 but it's still like that
help 2020-02-09 08:23:36 Is this a bug?
