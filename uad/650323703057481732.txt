general 2022-06-19 16:29:16 My mig-25 canâ€™t reach Mach 3 <:nooo:787097964946259978> <:nooo:787097964946259978> <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2022-06-19 16:29:28 Only mach 1 ðŸ¤®
general 2022-06-19 16:30:26 2000km/h is like mach 1.7 so i mean itâ€™s halfway there i guess
general 2022-06-19 16:32:34 Is maneuvering at supersonic speeds even possible lmao
general 2022-06-19 16:32:48 Without having a seizure during it at least
general 2022-06-19 16:33:17 Tfw when mig25 can only do 700km/h maneuvering
general 2022-06-19 16:33:36 I know
general 2022-06-19 16:33:39 But i wanted fast
general 2022-06-19 16:33:44 So i made fast
general 2022-06-19 16:33:56 8 hover drives <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2022-06-19 16:35:10 I should make a nato jet next
general 2022-06-19 16:35:50 I guess because poland
general 2022-06-19 16:36:27 Nato produced jet then
general 2022-06-19 16:36:48 Youâ€™re going to brazil
general 2022-06-19 16:37:31 Whatâ€™s the equivalent of the flankers again
general 2022-06-19 16:37:40 Was it f-22 or something
general 2022-06-19 16:39:29 I should make an f-35 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2022-06-19 16:39:36 That will definitely work out
general 2022-06-19 16:42:30 <:Pinged:508027985190715457>

general 2022-06-20 03:45:19 <:PogChamp:516298810700464128>
general 2022-06-20 03:45:50 Had to remove all the armaments but now i can say i did it
general 2022-06-20 03:46:45 I made a mig 25 and it went 3600 speed
general 2022-06-20 03:46:52 For like 2 seconds
general 2022-06-20 09:41:13 Gonna make a manual loading tnt ball naval cannon
general 2022-06-20 09:41:36 All my shell designs keep falling apart lmao
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 09:45:02 Me trying to make a shell design that doesnâ€™t fall aprt at the seams challenge
plane-crazy 2022-06-20 09:45:05 (Impossible)
general 2022-06-21 09:40:38 B2 spirit has been completed
general 2022-06-21 09:41:21 Nah
general 2022-06-21 09:41:28 My builds are too intimidating for them
general 2022-06-21 09:41:40 I barely understand half of what Iâ€™m doing
general 2022-06-21 09:41:53 Copiers even less
general 2022-06-21 09:42:21 Sure
general 2022-06-21 09:43:09 Somehow, my b2 has faster turn speed than my spitfire
general 2022-06-21 09:43:31 Extremely
general 2022-06-21 09:43:54 I had to put rudders on it <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2022-06-21 09:47:27 That moment when my b2 can dogfight better than my f-15
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 09:49:11 I want to build a big ass ship
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 09:49:26 But my shitty mac laptop will die
general 2022-06-21 09:51:17 Tempted to make a bayraktar
general 2022-06-21 10:01:35 Plane crazy 2?
general 2022-06-21 10:01:41 Are those missiles on the wings
general 2022-06-21 10:03:48 Btw for the qualifications thing
general 2022-06-21 10:03:58 I made a ratte with 2000 blocks
general 2022-06-21 10:04:21 But really itâ€™s onlt that big because i filled the insides with shit tons of armor and random blocks to make it tankier
general 2022-06-21 10:04:26 Does that count lmao
general 2022-06-21 10:06:29 Imagine being 7.0 on wt
general 2022-06-21 10:06:32 Coudlnt be me
general 2022-06-22 00:17:08 Motor 2s and rail guns do not go together
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 00:18:14 What other weapons can i put on an ac-130
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 00:18:23 Aside from guns and rockets
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 00:18:52 I was thinking a small railgun but  i tested it out and itâ€™s not compatible with motor 2s
general 2022-06-22 00:21:53 Do ac-130s have rockets on them?
general 2022-06-22 00:22:19 Cringe
general 2022-06-22 00:22:35 I know thereâ€™s a howitzer but i cant put one on an ac-130
general 2022-06-22 00:22:50 Railguns are too buggy
general 2022-06-22 00:23:07 Free to play moment
general 2022-06-22 00:24:02 It wasnâ€™t an ac-130
general 2022-06-22 00:24:07 just a c-130
general 2022-06-22 00:25:02 spooky?
general 2022-06-22 00:25:36 Weak armament <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2022-06-22 00:26:22 Oh hey thereâ€™s actually an irl b17 gunship
general 2022-06-22 00:26:39 I just slapped more turrets and rocket turrets on my normal b17

general 2022-06-22 00:40:01 Iâ€™ll do that later, not on the game rn
help 2022-06-22 05:47:24 Center of mass
help 2022-06-22 05:47:53 You could put helium all at the front of the build but if itâ€™s apply at center itâ€™ll lift the entire thing and not just the nose
help 2022-06-22 05:48:40 yes
help 2022-06-22 05:49:05 I think the center of mass changes after you fold
help 2022-06-22 05:49:08 But Iâ€™m not sure
help 2022-06-22 05:50:59 Anythingâ€™s possible
help 2022-06-22 05:51:07 Just fixed update
help 2022-06-22 05:51:09 Really
help 2022-06-22 05:51:17 Then do some math shite to find the center
help 2022-06-22 05:51:40 Like if half your build gets destroyed but it still balances on the original center of mass
help 2022-06-22 05:51:47 Itâ€™ll be really stupid
help 2022-06-22 05:51:59 So of course it has to change in real time
help 2022-06-22 05:55:14 Check center of mass
help 2022-06-22 05:55:22 One side could be heavier
help 2022-06-22 05:55:29 Also, try putting ballasts
help 2022-06-22 05:55:31 It helps
general 2022-06-23 15:24:29 mfw zumwalt is only 1/3 finished and im 1500 blocks in

plane-crazy 2022-06-27 03:48:06 For an engine
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 03:48:29 Like how it converts sidewards spin to forward spin to the wheels?
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 03:48:42 Or is that actually just not possible on here
plane-crazy 2022-06-27 03:51:53 Aw rip

creations-chat 2022-08-06 16:13:37 Yeah, I do mostly pvp so i usually favor function over appearance, so not alot of my builds look good, i dont really care though. Iâ€™ll improve over time
