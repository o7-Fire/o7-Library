creations-chat 2023-03-22 22:09:38 it detaches the motor lock tower
creations-chat 2023-03-22 22:13:15 yea, it uses the powered locked motors to lock the new position of parts like angle lock, but now it locks everything together with the motorlock tower, this is how it works: 1: once the locked motors have locked, press one of the powered-locked motor key ONCE. then, once everything kinda glitched in, you can press the button to remove the tnt/ disconnectors.
creations-chat 2023-03-22 22:16:29 yeah, first i press the keys to angle lock my wings, then to collapse my motorlock, then press the key to use my powered motors once, then press the key to disconnect the motorlock
creations-chat 2023-03-22 22:18:57 i looked at namnam's guide to rocket pods, i didnt understand it too well so i started to experiment with different designs. see? the motorlock tower is left behind
creations-chat 2023-03-22 22:28:42 im probably gonna make a guide explaining that in detail somewhere this week
creations-chat 2023-03-22 22:34:23 *n o.*
creations-chat 2023-03-22 22:59:48 if the motorlock tower is broken, it will not affect the build, atleast when it is detached
creations-chat 2023-03-22 23:04:22 namnam didnt explain it too well, so i had to learn it myself.
creations-chat 2023-03-22 23:31:13 good plane guide tho.
help 2023-03-22 23:32:39 send a screenshot or a vid of it doing it and in build mode
creations-chat 2023-03-22 23:45:01 look good in my OPINION + they perform well in PvP.
creations-chat 2023-03-22 23:47:31 I don't get why 1blocknose planes get so much hate.
creations-chat 2023-03-23 00:26:05 I'm not the ultra "pro builder" like some of you. for me it's either function, or looks. I generally prefer function in PvP
creations-chat 2023-03-23 00:29:56 got any tips to improve skill? cuz I am essentially dogshit at angle locking, camera locking and 90% of my builds have hella ton of exposed motor locking
creations-chat 2023-03-23 08:28:35 aight, I will try it out
creations-chat 2023-03-23 17:06:32 in my opinion, it would look nice if you moved the wings back a block or 2

help 2023-03-23 22:18:38 send screenshot
creations-chat 2023-03-24 11:34:50 its actually studs/s
creations-chat 2023-03-24 11:40:49 cat
creations-chat 2023-03-24 11:53:12 the speed of a roblox player is 16 studs/s
creations-chat 2023-03-24 11:57:00 roblox player walking speed is 16 studs/s, in plane crazy the speed indicator shows the speed of the player, not the actual creation or the pilot seat. plane crazy walking speed is 16, so that means, kOUejLord was travelling at speed of 1103830 studs/s
creations-chat 2023-03-24 12:28:46 in real life, it measures the speed of the car, in plane crazy, it measures the speed of the player
creations-chat 2023-03-24 12:33:35 if you jump out of your ultra motorlocked jet that is going 1000 sps, your player will have 0 sps when on the ground. the jet will stay at 1000 sps
creations-chat 2023-03-24 12:35:38 the speed counter measured the speed of the player, not the build.
creations-chat 2023-03-24 12:37:45 justneut is angry about me correcting him about the measurements of speed in plane crazy.
creations-chat 2023-03-24 12:44:15 for god sake, the plane crazy speed counter measures in STUDS/SECOND. there would be too much clutter for different ui. the way the speed counter would work for a vehicle is being measuring the speed of the main pilot seat because it is the place that is affected by the flip button.
creations-chat 2023-03-24 14:13:48 its true though, the default roblox measurement is studs/s
creations-chat 2023-03-24 14:19:09 dunno, roblox stud = 35cm. although the plane crazy measurements dont match up with normal roblox ones.
creations-chat 2023-03-24 21:06:06 cool namnam jet.
creations-chat 2023-03-24 21:11:05 make the intakes 3d it will look epicest

help 2023-04-01 13:45:24 why is the motor 2 so weak
help 2023-04-01 13:45:57 i set the motor to to 45 degrees, server, torque 1000 and at 650 it wouldnt move more than 15 degrees
help 2023-04-01 14:38:22 i mean for controls

plane-crazy 2023-04-08 12:49:09 can a mobile player confirm this image
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 12:49:15 when building something complex
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 12:56:19 damn
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 13:07:00 damn
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 13:39:44 i have no idea
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 13:39:52 i found it in gjsolo meme compilation
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 13:44:21 challenger2
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 13:46:13 the engines look a bit off but its still better than anything i could build
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 13:49:02 ok
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 13:54:50 mig 35
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 13:54:57 i dont really use angelock
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 13:55:10 im not good at it
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 13:57:38 i would have used it in pvp but my pc cant handle it
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 13:57:43 it averages 15 fps
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 13:57:50 it wobbles so much
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 14:35:59 what is a wasdcore
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 14:37:53 damn ðŸ˜”
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 14:38:09 anyways i checked what a wasd core was
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 14:38:24 it looked ultra ugly and my mig wouldnt have enough space
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 14:42:48 plus they dont look very plane like manuverable
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 14:43:10 
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 14:43:14 ugly
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 14:43:31 thats where the wobble comes from
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 14:43:35 drag
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 14:43:46 drag + 15fps = wobble
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 14:45:03 the main reason wobble exists is due to motor2 being weak
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 14:45:14 if they actually had 1000 torque
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 14:45:23 there would be no more wobble
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:19:48 small propellers do NOTHING at high speeds
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:20:53 high speeds
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 17:33:05 the only effective ways to have control at high speeds is to change the thrust direction or wing panels
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:02:26 if you have wings, propellors barely work at high speeds
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:02:37 atleast for control
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:02:43 for thrust they are weak
general 2023-04-08 18:42:22 you are verified
general 2023-04-08 18:43:31 how do people send images in general
