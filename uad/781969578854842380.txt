plane-crazy 2022-11-12 16:24:16 I thought cam lock can be unreliable
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 16:28:32 I think the f16 is harder to make than it looks

plane-crazy 2022-11-12 17:01:19 alright fe
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 17:01:47 bruh, so few ppl make galleons/man o wars
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 17:02:24 well it depends on your interests
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 17:02:45 some ppl think older man o wars look cooler but I guess its up to preferance
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 17:03:39 but in fairness man o wars like, first rate ships of the line, are piss hard to make
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 17:04:51 the bloody sails need to piss off, they take up so much space
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 17:05:56 well no man o wars where shades of brown, black, yellow, red and other silly colours
plane-crazy 2022-11-12 17:06:49 oh NVM theres actually a man o war in the HOF

bot-central 2022-11-13 11:08:29 !rank
general 2022-11-13 11:16:13 The victory wasnt a galleon it was a ship of the line which evolved from galleons
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 11:24:25 hi Uea
