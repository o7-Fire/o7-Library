plane-crazy 2022-08-02 10:59:05 the best engine for speed is conveyor

plane-crazy 2022-08-04 15:56:21 How did you paint the back like that
bot-central 2022-08-04 15:57:48 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 22:07:54 Wing panels and controll surfaces would make it better
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 22:09:08 No they both do the same thing anyways
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 22:09:59 Do you have enough control surfaces going  horizontal
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 22:11:01 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 22:11:18 I guess then all you can do it make it lighter or lower the top speed
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 22:11:35 Ur using the hover engine aren't you ?
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 22:14:55 make sure the Missile  is perfectly symmetrical and isn't too front heavy. Use a ballast block at the back and adjust the weight till it becomes rlly smooth
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 22:16:47 It also depends what device ur on
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 22:17:16 True
