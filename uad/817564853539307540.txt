plane-crazy 2022-10-10 20:34:52 But thanks,
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 20:35:16 I thought I could repurpose the nose, and use it for a Liberator.
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 20:37:04 Yes.
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 20:37:21 My second attempt at a heavy bomber.

plane-crazy 2022-10-10 20:44:28 Once I finish this B17, I'm going to make a Phantom then a B24 with a nose turret, or no nose turret.

plane-crazy 2022-10-10 20:54:05 I didn't play a lot.
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 20:54:13 See the words a lot?

creations-chat 2023-03-07 03:10:49 Why would I lie about using a tutorial on the PC discord server.
creations-chat 2023-03-07 03:15:33 Yeah, Dodge discontinues their best selling car and makes a piece of crap EV.

creations-chat 2023-03-08 02:23:15 Finished the the "top half," of the B17, made it too long, so I'll push the canopy up two or so blocks, and make the top half shorter.
