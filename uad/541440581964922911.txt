general 2020-04-01 23:46:00 Lol
general 2020-04-01 23:46:26 Best April fools EVER!
general 2020-04-17 21:38:48 I searched something and it broke
general 2020-04-17 21:38:58 Yeah
general 2020-04-17 21:39:03 Yeah
general 2020-04-17 21:39:17 I refreshed it and it jumped up to 8K reporrs
general 2020-04-17 21:41:12 13 thousand reports
general 2020-04-17 21:41:28 Being in game a bit laggy but fine
general 2020-04-17 21:41:57 What the hell? My 2 monitors just shut off
general 2020-04-17 21:42:59 Yep
general 2020-04-17 22:04:54 Uhh
general 2020-04-17 22:05:05 Random stuff is disappearing from my build
general 2020-04-17 22:08:49 My save files are corrupting
general 2020-04-17 22:08:57 Why are my files corrupting
general 2020-04-20 06:04:29 Me and robloxwin are too lazy to drive our own cars so we are making self driving cars
general 2020-04-20 23:39:57 Roblox is down again
general 2020-04-20 23:40:08 Load times are skyrocketing
general 2020-04-20 23:40:33 So that must be roblox is going critical again
general 2020-04-20 23:40:52 Normally if it skyrockets or data corrupts your on a backup server
general 2020-04-20 23:41:10 I have 8 other people with the same issue
general 2020-04-20 23:42:01 So it's a backup prob so that means roblox is about to go critical again. And adopt me is at nearly 500k in their servers so prepare for the worst
general 2020-04-21 19:00:53 Roblox is going critical
general 2020-04-21 19:02:32 I mean adopt me has 50 people opin a server of 48 m8
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 20:05:43 Gimme ideas
general 2020-04-21 21:30:05 Hi rick
general 2020-04-21 21:30:12 And I saw
general 2020-04-21 21:31:39 I have an idea that would compress save data alot and make it easier to make hearts but it would create more lag
general 2020-04-21 21:31:46 Ree
general 2020-04-21 21:32:00 Blocks not hearts what's wrong with my tablet
general 2020-04-21 21:32:15 Rick
general 2020-04-21 21:34:17 The idea would to be a parts list for all physics to be in game code instead of the save files if you already didn't have it so it saves part numbers and the game does the rest but it might be laggy
general 2020-04-21 21:36:09 "ROM" read only memory at the start of the script and a directory instead of it being all over the place
general 2020-04-21 21:36:47 I do it with all script I code and it speeds it up if its short
general 2020-04-21 21:37:49 Yes
general 2020-04-21 21:37:59 I thought it was 7 but ok
general 2020-04-21 21:43:30 Rick
general 2020-04-21 21:44:06 Is it normal to get too lazy to drive your own car in plane crazy to the point it drives its self
general 2020-04-21 21:45:40 I did already

general 2020-06-14 20:33:24 Basically it uses hover engine to go to compression then for where combustion is
general 2020-06-14 20:33:53 Automatically
general 2020-06-14 20:34:05 But it requires a beefy starter motor ngl
general 2020-06-14 20:34:33 So much compression that it doesnt like turning over if it isnt its sekf
general 2020-06-14 20:34:55 And I just use the standerd lawnmower design
general 2020-06-14 20:35:05 Where the top cooling fin is
general 2020-06-14 20:35:10 XD
general 2020-06-14 20:37:46 Nobody let Rick update the game for 5 weeks. He deserves a break lol

general 2020-06-17 00:27:13 I can overclock or even underclock
general 2020-06-17 00:27:21 I can do anything ngl
general 2020-06-17 00:27:54 So you can just type in the frequency you want as long as it's in the physical range?

general 2020-06-17 03:15:17 Hi
general 2020-06-17 03:23:44 When running ksp my graphics card fans dont even spin wtf
general 2020-06-17 03:24:10 Its at 80 c...
general 2020-06-17 03:24:26 120c
general 2020-06-17 03:24:51 135 c. Its seemed to level out
general 2020-06-17 03:25:32 I dont do afterburner I can just inject a script to get it going
general 2020-06-17 03:25:56 Which I just did and its cooling. Currently at 40c
general 2020-06-17 03:27:20 Well I'm running my GTX 970 and I trust that the max operating temp is 60c
general 2020-06-17 03:27:46 But my Intel i3 doesn't care
general 2020-06-17 03:28:24 ?
general 2020-06-17 03:28:43 Yea  I took it in middle of the 1st hail storm in 4 years
general 2020-06-17 03:29:45 I was playing ksp
general 2020-06-17 03:30:47 ? My monitor why just consists of a few scripts to catch the current running clock speed and both cores, then it displays them. Averages the cores together for the other reading
general 2020-06-17 04:34:02 The ISS is so beautiful me looking at it rn

I'm creepy ik
general 2020-06-17 05:58:01 HMMMMMMM
general 2020-06-17 13:40:22 In <#609442446249820211>  it says NOTHING about hover thrusters on helis.... so what if I use hover thrusters to make a heli that's piston powered
general 2020-06-17 13:42:03 It says that only prop blades can lift it...
general 2020-06-17 13:42:32 So I use hover thrusters to move pistons in and out that spin the prop blades
general 2020-06-17 13:42:46 Like a steam enginr
general 2020-06-17 13:42:50 Engine
general 2020-06-17 13:43:41 The only things I have lifting me is the blades and control surfaces for up/down control
general 2020-06-17 13:43:50 And I have no gyro work either
general 2020-06-17 13:44:52 I'm totally submitting it the moment I get around to installing my 1.5 tb hard drive
general 2020-06-17 13:46:04 XD
general 2020-06-17 13:56:00 Oh god
general 2020-06-17 13:56:08 My computer screen just flipped
general 2020-06-17 13:56:21 Now roblox is in monitor 2
general 2020-06-17 13:56:30 And Google is in monitor 3
general 2020-06-17 13:56:59 My driver just updated so It could be that
general 2020-06-17 17:06:41 My CPU fan broke
general 2020-06-17 17:50:41 Type f in the chat for my now broken CPU fan
general 2020-06-17 17:50:59 6 years of hard work
general 2020-06-17 17:52:04 Hey at least it gives me a reason to install my hard drive while the case is open
general 2020-06-17 17:53:05 I've had it run xp, then I upgraded windows and then upgraded my graphics card and CPU in 2013
general 2020-06-17 17:58:15 
general 2020-06-17 17:58:31 Eggs?anyone
general 2020-06-17 18:03:24 I know this sounds dumb but how do I use a laptop
general 2020-06-17 18:03:35 It's different from pc
general 2020-06-17 18:04:30 Simple
general 2020-06-17 18:05:02 F11 then click and hold the frame of roblox and bring it to top left
general 2020-06-17 18:05:17 Then other top right
general 2020-06-17 20:43:57 RIP. I found my issue with overheating...
general 2020-06-17 20:44:29 Not even the whole CPU has thermal paste
general 2020-06-17 20:52:37 It's not that
general 2020-06-17 20:53:06 The paste is so non effective that it crumbles with the wind
general 2020-06-17 20:53:23 Its 6 year old paste m8
general 2020-06-17 20:53:43 Yea
general 2020-06-17 20:54:07 I might want to remove my Intel i3 and upgrade
general 2020-06-17 20:54:40 But processors are super expensive at least ones compatible with the 1150
general 2020-06-17 20:55:03 I mean 320 bucks for an i7
general 2020-06-17 20:55:49 I mean in middle of a hail storm it is too hot
general 2020-06-17 20:56:03 My CPU fan wont even turnover
general 2020-06-17 20:56:55 Ima just put my computer in a dry closet and wait for parts to arrive to fix my CPU fan
general 2020-06-17 20:57:41 But since I will have withdrawal symptoms for not playing plane crazy for a month I'm going to game on my tab a
general 2020-06-17 20:58:01 Hmm
general 2020-06-17 20:58:47 Is a 970 a msi? I cant tell with all 25 msi labels on it
general 2020-06-17 21:00:39 My GTX 970 is msi... if you say stuff msi related runs hot your in the wrong place. My 970 runs cooler than the outside temperature at 10C
general 2020-06-17 21:00:58 Oh
general 2020-06-17 21:01:20 Ya mine runs 5c cooler than my room
general 2020-06-17 22:26:56 Life sucks and I'm proud of it
general 2020-06-17 22:52:55 Why is it so easy to pick locks
general 2020-06-17 22:53:41 I picked my house lock when I locked my self out in 5 seconds
general 2020-06-17 22:56:01 20 pin
general 2020-06-17 22:56:29 Ima continue rebuilding my computer
general 2020-06-18 02:17:04 I wonder if everyone tweets mad to add whitelist and mad accepts. What type of hell will he goes through. Cant be worse than working on a quadcopter that flies its self called the city Airbus in stormworks.
general 2020-06-18 02:18:53 I mean it cant possibly be worse than not sleeping for 6 days and going to the er twice doing nothing but vomiting
general 2020-06-18 14:09:11 We should make mad to re write the game as a punishment for making the game hard coded in the 1st place
general 2020-06-18 14:10:02 No. I pray to rick
general 2020-06-18 14:12:46 I mean I cant even code an autonomous 8 rotor hovercraft to takeoff, pathfind, fly, advoid getting crashed into, reroute like 50 times. And then land on the target not more than 5 meters away in a limit of 4500 charaters
general 2020-06-18 14:13:49 YES
general 2020-06-18 14:14:34 We totally wont punish you to re write the whole game for hard coding the game in the 1st place
general 2020-06-18 14:15:26 Isnt it nice that my computer is taken apart in 38 pieces in a closet waiting for parts
general 2020-06-19 03:43:05 Hmm
general 2020-06-19 03:43:53 This is now plane crazy community... it used to be officially unofficial plane crazy community
general 2020-06-19 03:44:42 C o n f u s I o n
general 2020-06-19 03:54:38 My computer is unofficially the official space heater... if the CPU fan would spin

general 2020-06-19 04:30:00 I need to speak with my therapist but being in the 1 plane that exploded faster than a blink of an eye Corona wise I dont think I can get help anytime soon. Any recommendations?
general 2020-06-19 04:38:33 Who is the offending user I'll look into it
general 2020-06-19 23:12:15 I wonder if mad has a secret plan for the server hitting 10K members to start working on the game again
general 2020-06-19 23:13:17 Possible
general 2020-06-19 23:15:41 I hope the game goes live sometime not today
general 2020-06-19 23:16:32 Otherwise I'd have to go to the store and possibly get corona for my computer parts since it's looking like I cant find them
general 2020-06-19 23:19:09 I mean look at this it NEEDS at least a heat sink with a fan on it. But it will do for plane crazy, nothing stormworks related means its fine
general 2020-06-19 23:19:41 Ehh I can run it with no cooling for a while
general 2020-06-19 23:19:52 Just need to scrape off the thermal paste and I'll be fine
general 2020-06-19 23:20:23 Well ima go get the connectors connected

general 2020-06-20 18:15:15 Its fine trust me
general 2020-06-20 22:02:47 I wonder of you could spin a heli so fast that it would spin at your framerate
general 2020-06-20 22:02:56 Making it work
general 2020-06-20 22:04:40 You guys are making gyrocopters while I'm making helicopters with nothing but the 1 spinning part
general 2020-06-20 22:05:45 True forbidden tech. Look
general 2020-06-20 22:05:52 Look closer
general 2020-06-20 22:06:02 That's a heli

general 2020-06-20 22:06:19 Steam engine tech
general 2020-06-20 22:06:37 Look only the heli blade spins and it flies
general 2020-06-20 22:07:04 It doesnt
general 2020-06-20 22:07:34 I just use it for pitch, roll, and yaw control until I can come up with a compact swashplate
general 2020-06-20 22:07:49 Strafe
general 2020-06-20 22:08:05 Since I'm planning to turn it into a camcopter
general 2020-06-20 22:08:24 Yes
general 2020-06-20 22:08:51 Do you want to see it in person?
general 2020-06-20 22:09:26 It's a little bumpy tho since the seats are ON the piston
general 2020-06-20 22:09:45 Yea...
general 2020-06-20 22:09:50 I said
general 2020-06-20 22:10:01 I'm still designing ways

general 2020-06-21 20:44:58 Someone mistook me for prototrode today. I haven't not played on a public server since and not planning to anytime soon
general 2020-06-21 20:46:15 Hey <@409676438682206218>  you know who I am right

general 2020-06-21 21:17:52 Lightning bolt just struck my lake and a boat exploded
general 2020-06-21 21:32:26 Boat
general 2020-06-21 21:32:28 Steuck
general 2020-06-21 21:32:31 Lifhtnigh
general 2020-06-21 21:32:37 Ears exploded
general 2020-06-21 21:32:44 Boat on fire
general 2020-06-21 21:32:55 Nope boat exploded
general 2020-06-22 03:58:36 Hey alive
general 2020-06-22 03:59:02 Dm me if you want to see the most cute cat photo I've ever taken
general 2020-06-22 13:55:38 I'm hanging out on the test server alone... in peace.... for once in my entire life finally a little peace around here! Even Rick. Love it
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 21:12:08 I want to get a rank but I dont know what rank to shoot for
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 21:13:04 So any idea what to build
general 2020-06-25 05:43:17 Hmm
general 2020-06-25 05:44:56 If I make a heli blade that can tilt up and down with the motor speed I could mechanically make a swashplate but it would be controlling how fast the rotor goes in 180 intervals meaning I could make a swashplate without roblox physics breaking it. IN THEORY
general 2020-06-25 18:33:52 Can someone challenge me since I've ran out of heli ideas
general 2020-06-25 18:34:55 steam powered, swashplate powered, turbine powered, single blade, 1 moving part I've ran out of ideas
general 2020-06-26 23:00:25 I just drifted a 2001 minivan and I didnt regret it
general 2020-06-26 23:02:45 Eh
general 2020-06-26 23:02:58 Use cylinders meshed closer together
general 2020-06-26 23:03:24 Feels too roblox modern tbh
general 2020-06-26 23:07:24 Well I need to get more work on my car that drives around the big island in stormworks on its own to stop at a helipad where a heli flies you to a private jet just for it to takeoff and fly automatically to the creative island where I have a solar panel that automatically tilts forward the sun based only on the panel output
general 2020-06-26 23:08:01 I'm just finishing the intirror of the jet
general 2020-06-26 23:08:10 And the ecu
general 2020-06-27 02:31:56 On the sight you missed a pixel and therr is a purple dot by the finger before firing
general 2020-06-27 02:32:04 <@615876745710534676>
general 2020-06-27 03:30:49 I just spent 2 hours browsing discord and I don't regret it
general 2020-06-27 06:07:38 ```rate mine now```
general 2020-06-27 06:08:20 ...
general 2020-06-27 06:09:17 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2020-06-28 02:25:21 My engine is so hot that the indicator cannot show it..... do I full throttle it and try to see if it cools from the water pump or not
general 2020-06-28 02:25:40 Fulling now
general 2020-06-28 02:26:09 Its floored at 9K rpm
general 2020-06-28 02:26:28 Looks like its full redline and cooling
general 2020-06-28 02:26:43 Now I actually get to pull out of my driveway
general 2020-06-28 07:19:43 10 hours of driving and I finally arrived home away from home
general 2020-07-02 13:28:00 Today I smashed my keyboard and my computer shut down. I think it opened the alt f4 menu with shutdown selected and enter was triggered.
general 2020-07-03 04:34:41 <@429826358827417601> your suspension is the size of your car, please put it in the wheels next time
general 2020-07-03 04:35:54 It can fit in a wheel ;)
general 2020-07-03 04:37:09 I dont get it why do people make cars built out of pure suspension when you can fit it inside the wheel
general 2020-07-03 04:38:21 It's easier just to make a car that drives for you then the cab is on a separate suspension tbh
general 2020-07-03 04:40:13 Wait why not make a working City Airbus perfect idea
general 2020-07-03 04:40:49 If I can do it in stormworks I can do it in plane crazi
general 2020-07-04 01:56:14 Block your dms blue whale is back
general 2020-07-04 01:56:48 Cool
general 2020-07-04 01:57:19 I'm sitting here with my shotgun spraying dragons breath into the water
general 2020-07-04 02:00:34 And that's the last of my 3rd of July supply of ammo
general 2020-07-04 02:00:56 Lol
general 2020-07-04 02:01:10 I have a stockpile of rounds that I turned into fireworks
general 2020-07-04 02:01:27 Yes
general 2020-07-04 02:01:41 Db
general 2020-07-04 02:01:54 No
general 2020-07-04 02:02:35 I took the loading mechanism of the db and sawed it off, then I made my own barrel that's the size of a rifle barrel
general 2020-07-04 02:06:10 Ok I'm at computer and glad roblox didnt kick me for being afk
general 2020-07-04 02:06:25 Time to start work on pure death again
general 2020-07-04 02:07:25 I have more folds than I can count on 1 kilobyte
general 2020-07-04 02:08:14 So far it's a straight line that is about 8 times the size of a base
general 2020-07-04 02:09:35 15 helium beams and the line is made of ballast blocks with the weight of .15
general 2020-07-04 02:09:49 4 anchors
general 2020-07-04 02:09:53 Pure death
general 2020-07-04 02:10:56 Its going to be a monorail to bring you from base to airport
general 2020-07-04 04:43:05 Help I ran out of ideas
general 2020-07-04 04:45:08 Magnetic swashplate, swashplate that uses g force to work, steam powered helicopter hover thruster swashplate... if I list more it would be the equivalent of spamming
general 2020-07-04 04:48:07 Does this affect plane crazy gameplay
general 2020-07-04 04:49:13 About 1 miniute of ping if my math is correct
general 2020-07-04 04:50:11 Btw it got to 10K after I took the photo
general 2020-07-04 04:54:58 Doing this fried my network adapter RIP. I have another laying around in another computer tho. Smoke is pretty.
general 2020-07-04 04:55:47 Grey streamers rising to higher heights
general 2020-07-04 04:56:38 It was a nice sunset last night
general 2020-07-04 12:04:48 It's my cats birthday what do I do for them
general 2020-07-04 12:05:24 They use cardboard since they dont like towers
general 2020-07-04 12:05:41 That could work
general 2020-07-04 12:06:19 I'll tinker around with swashplate designs for it in plane crazy
general 2020-07-04 13:39:05 I found a game breaking glitch
general 2020-07-04 13:39:36 Ima just take it and shove it in the bin. Hopefully Rick wont find it anytime soon
general 2020-07-04 13:50:26 You cant if its motor 2
general 2020-07-04 13:50:42 Otherwise use helium or make it not heavy
general 2020-07-04 13:53:27 I hope my monorail project that would bring me from bases to airport gets at least 3 upvotes
general 2020-07-04 13:56:35 I dont post so my max is 0
general 2020-07-04 13:57:21 OH GOD
general 2020-07-04 13:57:25 It made the turn
general 2020-07-04 13:58:45 Made it like it wasnt there
general 2020-07-04 14:10:57 Wow my plane crazy lifeboat tutorial has 10x+ veiws than subs gg people hate me
general 2020-07-04 14:16:45 500 veiws vs 40 subs
general 2020-07-04 14:16:54 Roughly 10x
general 2020-07-04 14:17:13 Uhh
general 2020-07-04 14:17:18 My background is black
general 2020-07-04 14:17:32 I think I fried something
general 2020-07-04 14:17:48 Ima check via command prmpt
general 2020-07-04 14:18:06 It should be the windows thing
general 2020-07-04 14:20:07 
general 2020-07-04 14:20:15 Verify isnt doing anything either
general 2020-07-04 14:20:28 Yes
general 2020-07-04 14:20:34 I have 22 shortcuts
general 2020-07-04 14:21:26 Wifi isnt working
general 2020-07-04 14:21:39 Looks like smoke is comming out of my dongle
general 2020-07-04 14:21:53 I'm on a phone
general 2020-07-04 14:23:32 Ok wtf
general 2020-07-04 14:23:40 Why do I have like 3 more hard drives
general 2020-07-04 14:23:53 That I swear dont exist
general 2020-07-04 14:24:54 I should only have C,E,and I
general 2020-07-04 14:25:14 Free storage space for me
general 2020-07-04 14:25:22 Yes
general 2020-07-04 14:25:35 I think there is a faul
general 2020-07-04 14:25:37 Fault
general 2020-07-04 14:26:08 I guess I have 4 free disks
general 2020-07-04 14:26:24 And I'll do it when I run cmd.exe to verify
general 2020-07-04 14:28:10 Uhhh
general 2020-07-04 14:28:40 Ima go into cmd and see what the hell is going on now
general 2020-07-04 14:31:12 It is how it should be... I remeber c part of e has no label and I having a label, but it isnt correct
general 2020-07-04 14:32:17 Ima hit alt f4 like 5 times
general 2020-07-04 14:33:20 Ok ima hit restart and see what happens
general 2020-07-04 14:33:37 Reatarting
general 2020-07-04 14:34:07 Everything went black like normal
general 2020-07-04 14:34:16 Good left monitor blue front is not
general 2020-07-04 14:34:33 Left monitor found a signal
general 2020-07-04 14:34:49 Left monitor is black and front is displaying starting up
general 2020-07-04 14:35:07 Its very old
general 2020-07-04 14:35:30 Doesnt have a feature where it can display the serial
general 2020-07-04 14:35:44 And I manually verified
general 2020-07-04 14:35:56 Booting
general 2020-07-04 14:36:04 I'm in
general 2020-07-04 14:36:16 Yes
general 2020-07-04 14:37:03 I think my right monitor died
general 2020-07-04 14:37:31 Gave me an error that internal battery is low
general 2020-07-04 14:37:42 While it logs in I'll plug it in brb
general 2020-07-04 14:38:09 Its in
general 2020-07-04 14:38:14 Verifying
general 2020-07-04 14:38:45 Doesnt the verify command do something
general 2020-07-04 14:39:12 I'm doing manually
general 2020-07-04 14:39:47 It works
general 2020-07-04 14:39:56 I saved a file to it, closed and then opened it
general 2020-07-04 14:40:51 That doesnt explain the sound of electricity jumping some gap and why my wallpaper cant load in
general 2020-07-04 14:41:34 I did and nothing happens
general 2020-07-04 14:41:51 Oh
general 2020-07-04 14:41:54 There
general 2020-07-04 14:43:36 Ima check something
general 2020-07-04 14:46:17 This explains something when it booted it was running at 3698
general 2020-07-04 14:46:42 It's at 41c
general 2020-07-04 14:46:53 It regularly hits 100c without the fan
general 2020-07-04 14:47:08 And it's the Intel i3 4170. This is bad
general 2020-07-04 14:47:28 And it hasn't gotten higher than 50c when I booted it
general 2020-07-04 14:47:40 Why
general 2020-07-04 14:47:50 Yea
general 2020-07-04 14:47:53 The limit is 70
general 2020-07-04 14:48:01 It throttles at 120
general 2020-07-04 14:48:28 It's the Intel i3 with a decent fan also
general 2020-07-04 14:48:55 I mean it's at 1600 rpm but I can ramp it up to 6000 rpm if you want
general 2020-07-04 14:49:08 Lol
general 2020-07-04 14:49:53 It gets to 120 c with stormworks, ksp, portal, portal 2, half life, half life 2, and xplane running at 60 tps
general 2020-07-04 14:49:54 Fps
general 2020-07-04 14:50:25 Its fine as long as it doesnt delid
general 2020-07-04 14:50:52 And I want an excuse to upgrade to i9
general 2020-07-04 14:51:26 Question
general 2020-07-04 14:51:41 Why is my GTX 970 running with 0 percent fan at 70 percent load
general 2020-07-04 14:52:13 Its 80c m9
general 2020-07-04 14:52:35 And I've manually ramped it up to 100 percent rpm and it doesnt make much noise
general 2020-07-04 14:53:14 This is slick
general 2020-07-04 14:53:30 The shadow is cursed
general 2020-07-04 14:53:48 Monorail 🤦
general 2020-07-04 15:00:28 Is this enough folds?
general 2020-07-04 15:25:55 This is the product of 60 attempts to unfold without roblox physics teleporting me
general 2020-07-04 15:27:24 Monorail
general 2020-07-04 15:27:39 Halfway from base to airport
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 18:02:52 So far... Yet so close
general 2020-07-04 18:04:12 woah
general 2020-07-04 18:04:23 ree having 2 monitors is confusing
general 2020-07-04 18:36:42 Do I stop when I summon the kraken
general 2020-07-04 18:37:44 Do I either stop so kraken is history or do I use the Kerbal method
general 2020-07-04 18:41:15 Yes
general 2020-07-04 18:42:57 My radio pre dates micro USB
general 2020-07-04 18:43:11 And it has a bad headphone jack
general 2020-07-04 18:44:36 Anyone remember the old website
general 2020-07-04 18:50:16 The good ol' days
general 2020-07-04 18:53:14 You can guess my password in 2 seconds
general 2020-07-04 20:05:58 > HOW DOES A FUCKING PISTOL 1 SHOT AT CLOSE RANGE
<@437078588701933568> 
Now use the raven and mod it to fit a .50
general 2020-07-04 20:06:13 Cool
general 2020-07-04 20:06:20 I invented another swashplate
general 2020-07-04 20:06:35 Using ``CLASSIFIED``
general 2020-07-04 20:07:10 It has very little glitching and the plate is simple
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 22:42:24 <@351848864531218442> basic
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 22:42:40 About 50 folds so far
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 22:43:38 Well yes... and no
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 22:44:01 Have you heard of ultrafolding
general 2020-07-05 04:21:17 I just spent 2 hours making a script that can tell if your smashing your keyboard or just misspelling
general 2020-07-05 04:21:29 I'm wiped
general 2020-07-05 04:22:12 Feels like I can just collapse and die rn I'm so wiped out
general 2020-07-05 04:22:58 <@401515741905420289> yea I have like 5 photos of them hugging at different times
general 2020-07-05 04:23:26 1 hour ago when it was the 4th it was their birthday
general 2020-07-05 04:23:57 I got them wild and it was so early that we could tell it was early july
general 2020-07-05 04:24:36 Aww they are doing it again. Sitting in her box while hugging
general 2020-07-05 04:25:21 They are not trained
general 2020-07-05 04:25:33 They are brother and sister
general 2020-07-05 04:25:37 They just do that
general 2020-07-05 04:25:55 They learned it from me hugging gidget
general 2020-07-05 04:26:09 Before she had to be put down from her pain
general 2020-07-05 04:26:37 For some reason she had a condition like mine where all pain sticks for until you die
general 2020-07-05 04:27:06 If you get cut by something gg you have it forever
general 2020-07-05 04:28:28 I'm dark
general 2020-07-05 04:30:29 I have depression PTSD and pretty my entire life of rage balled up into a single mass... I like it. Every time someone throws me to the ground suddenly they have cuts and bruises everywhere
general 2020-07-05 04:31:01 ...
general 2020-07-05 04:31:07 Hard to explain
general 2020-07-05 04:31:12 I'll say in dms
general 2020-07-06 16:39:59 i fixed my computer
general 2020-07-06 16:41:17 it had nothing but a black backround since i think... i might have corrupted something when formatting my hard drive at the exact same time as there was a fault (THANKS GREYSTONE) and the breaker didnt automatically reset for a while. so yea. Might have gone into windows and found the wallpaper to reset it
general 2020-07-06 16:41:38 and the hard drive is fried btw
general 2020-07-06 16:41:44 no recovery
general 2020-07-06 16:41:49 3 TB down the drain
general 2020-07-06 22:23:20 dm me if you want your head to explode there is a glitch so bad
general 2020-07-06 22:25:14 anti copy blacklist
general 2020-07-06 22:25:29 rick made an update
general 2020-07-06 22:25:42 where you cant use config tool on other peoples builds if they are in build mode
general 2020-07-06 22:25:44 to prevent that
general 2020-07-06 22:29:18 come dm me if you want your head to explode from a glitch so bad
general 2020-07-06 22:29:25 and it wasnt a glitch
general 2020-07-06 22:29:29 it used to be a feature
general 2020-07-06 22:29:30 but
general 2020-07-06 22:29:33 exploits
general 2020-07-06 22:29:40 so he made it so you can only see it when spawned
general 2020-07-06 22:30:08 this was like 2 updates before anti copy blacklist
general 2020-07-06 22:30:25 hover thrusters
general 2020-07-06 22:30:36 i tried to make an engine out of them with them exploding creating torque
general 2020-07-06 22:30:37 well...
general 2020-07-06 22:30:41 they exploded everywhhere
general 2020-07-06 22:30:44 and they froze in time
general 2020-07-06 22:31:16 join me if you want, im on my spottedstorm2 account
general 2020-07-06 22:34:52 they are just... floating. like each thruster had an anchor block
general 2020-07-06 22:35:57 i wonder if someone took a plane and flew through it
general 2020-07-06 22:52:24 i build so fast that people think im a robot. do i have to take the turring test again?
general 2020-07-06 22:57:56 im TOTALLY not a robot
general 2020-07-06 22:59:08 ok you flesh people
general 2020-07-06 22:59:53 just add SINGLE block rip
general 2020-07-06 23:00:25 i have helicopter. made of pure steam engine. do i post on creations or not.
general 2020-07-06 23:02:37 i have a monorail like 3 times that size
general 2020-07-06 23:03:02 could be the longest monorail in the game
general 2020-07-06 23:03:15 its 1 bolck wide and lemme unfold it
general 2020-07-06 23:03:39 it can just about reach the tracks for the airport
general 2020-07-06 23:04:16 the height is a half block over bases. assuming your in the carrage
general 2020-07-06 23:04:36 since mine is the longest you can get without roblox killing you
general 2020-07-06 23:04:45 if i add more folds it vanishes
general 2020-07-06 23:04:56 so i think i reached a hard limit
general 2020-07-06 23:06:41 any longer and it flat out dies
general 2020-07-06 23:07:08 if you want to see it in game be my guest
general 2020-07-06 23:07:40 im on spottedstorm2 i think
general 2020-07-06 23:07:45 could be spottedstorm3
general 2020-07-06 23:07:46 lemme check
general 2020-07-06 23:07:55 spottedstorm2
general 2020-07-06 23:09:07 i wish i could get a rank for it. but it has helium its so heavy. track isnt made of blocks. its made out of ballast with .15
general 2020-07-06 23:09:17 and it is powered by the track
general 2020-07-06 23:09:19 not ground wheels
general 2020-07-06 23:10:00 come join to see it
general 2020-07-06 23:10:25 gamemodes. non pvp. then put spottedstorm2 int the box
general 2020-07-06 23:11:15 bruh my cpu usage is a signwave
general 2020-07-06 23:11:22 now its a sawtooth
general 2020-07-06 23:11:23 bruh
general 2020-07-06 23:12:03 ReEeEeEeEe
general 2020-07-06 23:12:12 i underclocked mine
general 2020-07-06 23:12:25 at a whopping 75 MHz
general 2020-07-06 23:12:31 for my i3
general 2020-07-06 23:12:48 thats ment to be like 3700 mhz. anyway i have a 970
general 2020-07-06 23:12:58 ye
general 2020-07-06 23:13:23 if i ramp the thing up its a turboramjet with a second afterburner
general 2020-07-06 23:14:32 can you beat this? i did it on a vip so nobody would crash... still the server kicked me and if i tried to join back i got the wrong platform error
general 2020-07-06 23:15:00 same
general 2020-07-06 23:15:04 i dont even have a cpu fan
general 2020-07-06 23:15:07 ]i run it dry
general 2020-07-06 23:15:27 970
general 2020-07-06 23:15:29 its old
general 2020-07-06 23:15:30 very old
general 2020-07-06 23:15:33 anyway
general 2020-07-06 23:15:39 eyy you joined
general 2020-07-06 23:18:01 i have 24 gb of ram
general 2020-07-06 23:18:09 its not overkill
general 2020-07-06 23:18:12 im a stormworks player
general 2020-07-06 23:18:20 game crashes if i have under 4
general 2020-07-06 23:18:29 windows bluescreens if i have under 2
general 2020-07-06 23:18:44 the pc enters a boot loop if i have 0 gb
general 2020-07-06 23:19:09 same
general 2020-07-06 23:19:36 it feels like ddr2 for me
general 2020-07-06 23:19:40 but its ddr3
general 2020-07-06 23:23:14 sure 1 min
general 2020-07-06 23:24:20 there
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 23:24:39 Ree
general 2020-07-06 23:25:29 There
general 2020-07-06 23:25:29 
general 2020-07-06 23:25:39 That's my setup
general 2020-07-06 23:26:10 Bruh I dont even have a cooling fan
general 2020-07-06 23:27:12 I dont use my stovetop to fry eggs. I use my pc
general 2020-07-06 23:28:19 Noob tickspeed
general 2020-07-06 23:28:26 Or shall I say ckockspeed
general 2020-07-06 23:28:51 Fid you build that that's a mess
general 2020-07-06 23:29:02 Windows xp gang
general 2020-07-06 23:29:52 [Insert potato here]
general 2020-07-06 23:30:23 
general 2020-07-06 23:31:30 Do I upload the audio clip of my PC or save ur ears
general 2020-07-06 23:33:12 Who does CPU fans
general 2020-07-06 23:33:20 Who uses fans
general 2020-07-06 23:33:22 Ew
general 2020-07-06 23:34:07 No CPU fan gang
general 2020-07-06 23:36:05 Should I be worried
general 2020-07-06 23:36:21 ?
general 2020-07-06 23:36:52 But the issue is
general 2020-07-06 23:37:07 I clearly hear SCRAAACH BANG comming from my drive
general 2020-07-06 23:37:17 I'll be fine
general 2020-07-06 23:37:32 Windows is loaded into my ram anyway
general 2020-07-06 23:38:25 My wallpaper just disapeared
general 2020-07-06 23:38:51 Uhh
general 2020-07-06 23:39:02 Windows r isnt working
general 2020-07-06 23:39:08 I cant open run
general 2020-07-06 23:39:41 Start menu broke
general 2020-07-06 23:39:53 Cant click on it
general 2020-07-06 23:40:19 I just bluescreened
general 2020-07-06 23:43:14 It has entered a bluescreen boot loop
general 2020-07-06 23:43:23 Got save me
general 2020-07-06 23:43:39 Well then
general 2020-07-06 23:44:11 I think my c drive failed then my ram wasnt able to let windows operate on it
general 2020-07-06 23:44:37 Since I have enough ram to operate windows on it
general 2020-07-06 23:45:23 You can make a PC network so people can tap into a TB of ram I can install
general 2020-07-06 23:45:40 I managed go turn a hard drive connector to a ram connector
general 2020-07-06 23:46:06 So I can plug in 3 tb of ram
general 2020-07-07 04:32:33 I want a rank but it's too ez
general 2020-07-07 04:32:48 I want a challenge to get one
general 2020-07-07 04:33:07 All or nothing right?
general 2020-07-07 04:33:15 What do I aim for
general 2020-07-07 04:33:40 Tell me
general 2020-07-07 04:34:15 Its impossible rn I think <@456226577798135808>
general 2020-07-07 04:34:29 It isnt?
general 2020-07-07 04:34:52 I already did
general 2020-07-07 04:35:00 Steam engime
general 2020-07-07 04:35:13 High torque
general 2020-07-07 04:35:23 Can be used for racecars
general 2020-07-07 04:36:24 I mean I could submit the hover bike but udk
general 2020-07-07 04:36:27 Idk
general 2020-07-07 04:36:40 I mean it's more than practical
general 2020-07-07 04:37:04 It can zoon the map at infinite speeds
general 2020-07-07 04:37:20 Can get anywhere
general 2020-07-07 04:37:58 Or it could be my gimbal design for rockets
general 2020-07-07 04:38:10 And that's what I mean
general 2020-07-07 04:38:21 I made a hover bike engine that can go at infinite spedds
general 2020-07-07 04:38:28 No.
general 2020-07-07 04:38:45 You need to see my glados design I put the gimbal on
general 2020-07-07 04:38:59 Could be my rear differential too
general 2020-07-07 04:39:05 Or my compact swashplate
general 2020-07-07 04:39:38 It can be my steam engine
general 2020-07-07 04:39:46 Since it's high torque
general 2020-07-07 04:40:00 Perfect for cars with my differential design
general 2020-07-07 04:40:05 I've made a heli out of it
general 2020-07-07 04:40:26 Hince my heli rank
general 2020-07-07 04:41:21 I've made a motor design that can speed up on 180 degrees and slow down in the other 180, if turn where the 180 degree point it acts as a swashplate that's sinple
general 2020-07-07 04:42:06 I made something that nearly bluescreened my computer trying to make an engine
general 2020-07-07 04:42:42 Ok I'll show late
general 2020-07-07 04:42:44 Later
general 2020-07-07 04:43:38 Its a engine piston design where using my steam engine piston connected to it can adjust speed, then if I move the steam engine the motor will turn
general 2020-07-07 04:43:50 But it uses physics
general 2020-07-07 04:44:26 I dont know if it could be translated to roblox easily. But my IRL testing is working fine
general 2020-07-07 04:45:09 It uses torque stuff
general 2020-07-07 04:45:44 Basically torque tilts the blade forward on one half, then slowing down would make it the other way on the other side
general 2020-07-07 04:45:55 Making it go up
general 2020-07-07 04:45:57 Then
general 2020-07-07 04:46:16 If you move the 180 pivot 90 degrees you tilt left
general 2020-07-07 04:51:34 Did anyone submit a solid rocket booster yet for inventor?
general 2020-07-07 04:51:56 Since I having a working design with working fuel
general 2020-07-07 04:52:08 You can even refuel it
general 2020-07-07 04:52:24 It uses cylinders
general 2020-07-07 04:52:45 Since I'm taking advantage of neutrons law
general 2020-07-07 04:57:24 Has any solid rocket booster that has a trail like this?
general 2020-07-07 04:58:39 I'm the boi with the SRB
general 2020-07-07 04:59:02 I can change the nozzle for burn rates
general 2020-07-07 04:59:47 Well I have my issues to attend to.
general 2020-07-07 05:01:04 Question. Can you replicate this?
general 2020-07-07 05:01:13 Good
general 2020-07-07 05:02:28 You can see where the booster is actually
general 2020-07-07 05:29:22 Is it possible to get the inventor rank for a system that's 2 blocks and proves useful in automation i.e. autonomous cars
general 2020-07-07 05:30:04 I'm just thinking
general 2020-07-07 05:31:56 I've made belt fed guns that auto eject with it, engine valves, swashplates, cars that drive for you, auto correcting gyro systems, auutopilots...
general 2020-07-07 05:32:08 And alot more
general 2020-07-07 05:32:32 Even keyboards or light switches
general 2020-07-07 05:33:07 Assuming you use a sr latch with the lights
help 2020-07-07 05:51:39 Will inventor be opened again or will my 2 block creation that would change plane crazy how we know it should be thrown in the rubbish bin
help 2020-07-07 05:52:14 All of that work making it drive cars for me down the drain?
help 2020-07-07 05:53:08 Making it automatically detect your going to crash and put it in reverse for you down the bin.
help 2020-07-07 05:53:56 Making it adjust by the terrain down the bin. Making it detect your bottoming out and giving you a push down the bin... you get the point
help 2020-07-07 05:56:40 Ignore em
help 2020-07-07 05:56:49 Spawn kill them bacj
general 2020-07-07 15:35:44 If inventor rannk was open I could get it in as little as 2 blocc
general 2020-07-07 15:36:13 The 2 blocc allows pid controllers
general 2020-07-07 15:36:43 2 blocc can allow automated cars
general 2020-07-07 15:37:04 The 2 blocc would change plane crazy how we know it
general 2020-07-07 15:37:48 The 2 blocc allows the game to be changed
general 2020-07-07 15:37:56 Sensor galore
general 2020-07-07 15:38:05 Autopilot
general 2020-07-07 15:38:13 Auto correction with gyros
general 2020-07-07 15:38:18 Auto flight
general 2020-07-07 15:38:25 Auto cars
general 2020-07-07 15:38:31 Ok
general 2020-07-07 15:38:43 The thing is I already made a car that can use it to work
general 2020-07-07 15:39:32 Sans = wifhour
general 2020-07-07 15:39:34 Without
general 2020-07-07 15:39:44 YT means YouTube. Without Youtube
general 2020-07-07 15:40:38 N0t I invited you to my VIP if you want to see it in person. Nothing a little PTSD wont fix
general 2020-07-07 15:44:55 I once made a what I call a FTL drive. I was able to reach nearly let's  e+ something and if I decided ot by 3 then turned it km/s I got about 6 times the speed of light
general 2020-07-07 15:45:24 Thjng is
general 2020-07-07 15:45:48 I can send you the video of it breaking
general 2020-07-07 19:06:50 Is it a feature if you point your cursor over something and hit the delete key it disapears
general 2020-07-07 19:06:58 Disappears
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:28:31 obc i made a way smaller system tbh
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:28:48 but good work anyway
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:29:23 want any help?
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:29:49 ive spent nearly 6 months studying diagrams and making them in real life before i even attempted plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:30:02 im honest
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:30:37 why is your privicy settings set so i cant invite you to my public vip rip
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:31:03 in <#609381270237216768> my arrow actually has a chance
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:33:17 you sure?
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:33:45 its like teh only spike that can plow through anything to get away from... you know what
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:34:47 hey obc,  join my game with the in game join feature, should be on my spottedstorm2 account to show you a working example you can base your desings off of
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:35:39 why no wnv lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:35:57 oh lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:36:32 hey can someone challenge me for something
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:36:37 anything helicopter
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:38:01 anything to do?
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:38:06 helicopter related
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:39:37 got it
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:50:19 oh god
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:50:27 its more powerful than my main rotor
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:53:32 lower torque
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:54:18 you havent seen bounce until you have seen my ~68 fold monorail
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:54:50 add weight on the back and adjust with control surface
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:54:59 and add trim flaps
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:55:17 look it up
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:56:18 make em bigger
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:56:32 swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:57:01 multi colour LED
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:57:12 look it up
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:57:15 its 2 plates
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:57:17 1 is spinning
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:57:18 1 isnt
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:57:22 1 is tilting
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:57:27 ]they are together so it tilts the other
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:57:32 makiong it push up a rod
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:57:36 thats an offset to a blade
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:57:39 that makes the blade
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 22:57:40 work
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:02:01 what expert rank do i aim for
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:02:41 ...
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:02:54 ...
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:03:09 i said expert rank
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:03:31 vtol terrain what
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:04:20 sure
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:04:28 lets see what block requirement it is
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:04:59 wiw
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:05:00 wow
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:05:09 that = free expert rank i have a 2100 plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:05:46 well i have to apply
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:06:15 and i think you can only be devloper by being rick or mad
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:06:26 and even if it was able to be a rank thats public
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:06:58 i work neural AI's
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:07:01 not games
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:08:08 only spot i put low effort on on my plane was the wing gear since i couldnt fit a good suspension rip
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:08:36 if bases EVER get slightly bigger i might be able to
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:08:49 or if i put a quad fold but then that would be werid since THAT wouldnt fit
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:10:12 and the rudder is a bit small since i couldnt fit a good size with how its a tri fold but it works
plane-crazy 2020-07-07 23:10:42 and its impossible to butter. thats a real plane
general 2022-01-12 05:06:10 New song im working legit bad
general 2022-01-14 14:34:33 cats are weird
general 2022-01-14 20:05:04 thanks for the idea, now im going to make it in stormworks
general 2022-01-14 20:06:00 that camber tho
bot-central 2022-01-14 20:26:12 !rank
