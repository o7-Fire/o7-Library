plane-crazy 2021-03-17 19:15:54 ive tried to make a ww1 biplane 3 times, and they always fail because the center of aero is abovet the com and i cant fix it no matter what I do
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 18:01:35 how do i make a biplane work
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 18:01:46 the center of aero is way too high on all of my bi planes so they never work
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 18:06:18 you know what im just gonna give up on my ww1 biplane attempts, ive tried at least 5 times and none of them work because of how much lift wing panels generate
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 19:09:40 i built a spitfire, but due to limitations I couldn't make functioning and good looking landing gear
