The Tale of _morose (283777380219355136)
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 22:37:14 I wish the ballast impacted the center of mass indicator
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 22:37:23 are fuel blocks heavy
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 22:37:42 whats heavier, diamond plate block or fuel block
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 22:38:05 does fuel accurately effect center of mass indicator
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 22:38:12 I heard ice is light
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 22:38:56 its buoyant
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 22:38:59 i don't want that
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 22:39:13 I just want to equalize my build since its back-heavy
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 22:39:28 no I got everything I needed
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 22:39:32 thanks though
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 22:40:01 my name isn't random
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 22:40:07 I desire knowledge
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:02:04 0g "airbreak". is that possible?
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:03:02 not for detail
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:03:06 for functionality
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:03:07 because
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:03:15 my spaceship just floats into oblivion while I try to counteract the momentum slowly
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:03:28 is there any way to slow the momentum down in all axis at once
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:03:46 like a slow anchor
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:04:38 I currently use an anchor but it looks really bad when you go from drifting at 700 mph to stopping
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:04:43 rest in peace your crew and structure
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:05:23 I tried putting wing surfaces all around my center of gravity so it has drag by default
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:05:33 but that doesn't work too well on demand
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:08:39 that's what I currently use but its hard to orient the craft properly
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:09:07 that would become cancer with all the cutter swarms on one team
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:09:11 it would be like galaga
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:09:16 but impossible
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:59:09 I solved my control issue with a bunch of wing panels at the aft of the ship
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:59:38 it adds a lot of drag and keeps it from spinning a whole lot
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 13:59:58 which makes slowing it down easier since I just need to use retrothrusters and a little counter-thrust to stop the little spinning
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 14:00:11 ðŸ’ª
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 14:00:16 time to put a body on the skeleton
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 20:44:57 it would be dope if they added a gyro block that can't be rotated but can be moved freely
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 21:17:10 don't have access to sugestions

plane-crazy 2021-03-11 21:18:09 oh
plane-crazy 2021-03-11 21:18:17 thanks
