creations-chat 2022-07-11 16:45:39 will we not have to use motorlock in plane crazy 2?
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 19:13:17 in plane crazy 2 are we still gonna have to use motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 19:13:41 fr?
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 19:13:55 are they gonna add better blocks then
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 21:11:45 why
plane-crazy 2022-07-12 21:21:17 could we still do precise placing without motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-07-14 21:02:10 is plane crazy 2 actually gonna release in summer bruh

creations-chat 2022-08-06 03:36:27 ignore my shit building but this totally isnt how you build a vtol right?
creations-chat 2022-08-06 03:38:43 im just wondering how wrong im doing it
creations-chat 2022-08-06 03:42:15 yea im thinking about the harrier but i kinda accidentally put the vtol pieces right in the sides where the wings should be
at the same time im experimenting to see if VTOL is too complicated for me
also the base for the plane was some short me 163 chinese knockoff, you can see the poorly made blue camo made from the old build
creations-chat 2022-08-06 03:58:01 ok this shit is really stupid and ugly now
but it works
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:00:58 i have no clue how this way turned out different but it works good now
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:03:11 no shit of course it looks ass
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:07:51 repainted it and gave it what i always wanted it to have
its shit but its mid imo
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:09:55 you literally said that 6 minutes ago i read your message
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:32:33 ok nvm the amount of mechanical problems this has is stupid
it can:
1: somehow motorlock itself in mid air even though it has no parts that are made to motorlock and produces an odd effect where the engines go infront of the plane without being connected to anything
2: 1 of the motors can go haywire therefor eternal spin
3: motors fail to move to correct positions (it requires a very tiny point between the angle of the engines) meaning i have to restart again (this issue is also happens wayy too much)
4: engines can get too powerful and lose control
5: another variant of the motorlock in mid air (more inside the plane)
6: motors go exactly the same  which is a variant of number 3
7: a new type of mid air motorlock where the engines go above the plane
pictured is number 7 (along with 6)
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:34:45 another mid air motorlock
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:37:46 failed experiment or weird new thing?
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:39:48 yea you're right it really is "goofy ahh"
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:42:23 it is a guided missile launched by some weird massive MiG looking thing

creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:44:47 the missile actually has some pretty interesting controls i made
to launch first press c for missile cam then x for disconnect
e to activate the downwards facing proppellor to make sure it launches out and giving the missile a downwards angle
wasd for movement n stuff
creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:46:49 the pain
