general 2020-07-31 06:46:32 hi
general 2020-07-31 06:46:36 oh wait
general 2020-07-31 06:46:38 ok
general 2020-07-31 06:46:56 so this is my alt because my main is set 1 year off so i can't say numbers ugh
general 2020-07-31 06:47:48 i have a basic understanding of locked motors
general 2020-07-31 06:49:06 how the hell can i make my vtol not rotate around while doing vertical takeoff
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:50:00 <@!697786877444358186> try doing the N1, you'll love it with the number of rockets
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:50:27 N1 is too much rocket engines
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:50:52 people making N1 rocket is kerbal space program players
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:51:29 miner make H U G E N1 rocket
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:51:46 not big enough
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:51:53 and n1 must go boom
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:51:58 like in real life
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:52:20 xue hua piao piao
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:52:39 well i tried making a fighter plane in mobile and it failed horribly
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:52:48 it won't fly lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:53:00 moar engines
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:54:17 it's kinda fun for me building things on mobile
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:54:35 <@456226577798135808> saturn v
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:54:43 or idk, falcon 9
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:54:54 nah
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:55:11 then energia rocket
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:55:32 buran energia is soviet space shuttle
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:56:03 i watched the launch of perseverance mars rover today
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:56:53 make any rocket made by ULA <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:58:51 european space agency should land a lander on saturns moon europa for shits and giggles and some possible science
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:59:27 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 06:59:50 if they had unlimited money like nasa in the apollo program then idk
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:00:34 near unlimited budget
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:00:55 ight ima add more rockets to my plane for maximum speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:01:10 how the hell do you make a conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:01:26 i need quadruple digit speeds
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:01:45 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:01:59 add for inflation
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:02:21 everybody in zimbabwe once became a trillinaire lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:02:34 because hyperinflation
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:08:04 Not based off of any plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:08:23 My main is PepsiGod0602
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:08:47 anyway the sea dragon would be destroyed by instability
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:09:21 thats why the F1 rocket engines combustion chamber had baffles to stablise engine
general 2020-07-31 07:10:39 <@456226577798135808> disgusting its tiktok tiktok bad
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:11:51 iirc, the f1 rocket engines had baffles to stablise rocket engine and not explode even if a bomb went off inside the combustion chamber because they did that apparently
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:12:06 ight
general 2020-07-31 07:12:58 the developers need to add 0 density blocks in the game
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:13:23 > combustion instability in sea dragon engine
<@!274565008837574656>  this
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:13:48 the combustion chamber would be just big and unstable
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:14:36 help how the hell do i land my plane it keeps on bouncing
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:14:52 should i add parachutes at the end to slow it down
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:15:51 so i'll add parachutes at my plane to slow it down right?
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:16:13 its fast even at minimum speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:16:45 i mean i made it so that it is maximum speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:17:07 what more should i add to this
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:17:23 when its going faster it would spin around and lose its mind
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:17:48 should i make it bigger huh
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:18:02 comically small horizontal tail
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:18:30 give me horizontal tail designs
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:18:53 sometimes i hate locked motors when i want them to work as normal motors
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:20:20 i made a long range missile lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 07:20:28 long range ballistic missile
help 2020-07-31 07:21:31 can someone help me with my plane's horizontal tail thing like give me something to look at
help 2020-07-31 07:22:01 when building
help 2020-07-31 07:22:18 locked motors because idk
bot-central 2020-07-31 07:23:41 =p polish toilet spin
bot-central 2020-07-31 07:23:47 =np
bot-central 2020-07-31 07:23:57 =q
general 2020-07-31 07:24:38 come to top tunes we have polish toilet spin
bot-central 2020-07-31 07:25:43 !p polish toilet spin miku
bot-central 2020-07-31 07:25:50 ight
bot-central 2020-07-31 07:26:01 =p polish toilet spin hatsune miku
general 2020-07-31 07:28:26 i think the game needs an afterburner jet engine thing that eats fuel but additional speeds is added
general 2020-07-31 07:29:06 yeah i use fuel because for no reason
general 2020-07-31 07:29:37 there also needs to have a zero density block
general 2020-07-31 07:30:04 ballast gives you .15
general 2020-07-31 07:30:11 i need absolute zero
general 2020-07-31 07:30:42 does the camera block have density
general 2020-07-31 07:31:35 how do i stop my (folding) ship from capsizing?
general 2020-07-31 07:32:29 tbh the rocket engines should vector for thrust vector control
general 2020-07-31 07:33:23 its near impossible to do thrust vector control engines
general 2020-07-31 07:33:39 > Like real jet engines
<@456226577798135808>  theyre called turbofan engines
general 2020-07-31 07:34:13 yeah
general 2020-07-31 07:34:24 i spam rocket engines or use a magnet drive
general 2020-07-31 07:35:08 i know but the engines you see on airliners are turbofans
general 2020-07-31 07:36:33 i'm in love with the locked motors
general 2020-07-31 07:37:30 ion engines weak, they need time to accelerate the object they're proppeling so it's used in space for no air resistance
general 2020-07-31 07:39:21 whats the purpose of pontoon blocks when you can't even make seaplanes on plane crazy
general 2020-07-31 07:39:56 whats the purpose of pontoon blocks when you can't even make seaplanes on plane crazy
general 2020-07-31 07:40:09 pontoon blocks useless
general 2020-07-31 07:40:52 how the hell do i make a seaplane when pontoon blocks don't work for seaplanes

general 2020-07-31 09:04:32 oh i was late
general 2020-07-31 09:05:41 its hard to make a plane that has a working tail wing without using control surfaces
general 2020-07-31 09:07:23 h

general 2020-08-01 14:20:01 ok
general 2020-08-09 13:03:37 does tank suspensions work with tank treads?
general 2020-08-19 12:21:45 poggers
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 10:14:24 this mechanism allows part 1 (the one with yellow and black) and part 2 (the one that spins) be angled and still spin.
Blue isn't powered and red is powered.
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 10:15:01 now give me my inventor role this is used irl cars
general 2020-08-25 10:15:28 is this good enough for inventor role lol

general 2020-08-30 16:39:54 do you agree that shredder bugs are trash and ruin peoples lives
general 2020-08-30 16:40:54 ban shreder bugs from plane crazt pls
general 2020-08-30 16:41:20 rate building on mobile yes or no
general 2020-08-30 16:41:34 turrets are annoying yeah
general 2020-08-30 16:42:16 i was preparing my icbm missile and some kod with a minigun turret started shooting
general 2020-08-30 16:43:32 <@514591479457382442> dont teach kids pls
general 2020-08-30 16:44:12 how to make a torpedo tube since i'm building a destroyer with 26 torpedoes on either side
general 2020-08-30 16:44:34 my 1x2 torpedoes
general 2020-08-30 16:44:55 its 1x1 but the disconnector makes it 1x2
general 2020-08-30 16:45:05 1x2x7 size
general 2020-08-30 16:45:16 ok ok
general 2020-08-30 16:45:23 how do i get it out of the water
general 2020-08-30 16:45:40 the torpedo tubes rotate
general 2020-08-30 16:45:46 and its above water
general 2020-08-30 16:46:07 i launch it out of a tube
general 2020-08-30 16:46:34 from a ship dummy
general 2020-08-30 16:47:07 do i use explosives to propel it or a spring
general 2020-08-30 16:47:14 the torpedoes already float
general 2020-08-30 16:48:23 i just need to push it out so it falls in water
general 2020-08-30 16:48:34 so the water props will do their thing
general 2020-08-30 16:48:48 but how about the disconnector
general 2020-08-30 16:48:59 the tube is 8 blocks long why
general 2020-08-30 16:49:24 can a spring be used tho
general 2020-08-30 16:49:44 or is springs just too underpowered
general 2020-08-30 16:50:06 well thank you for the help i guess
general 2020-08-30 16:50:26 but how does the magnet work
general 2020-08-30 16:50:47 like from the back of the tube
general 2020-08-30 16:51:00 like the very start point
general 2020-08-30 16:51:03 ok
general 2020-08-30 16:54:58 is the "free length" for suspensions measured in blocks
general 2020-08-30 16:55:10 or studs
general 2020-08-30 16:55:47 k thanks
general 2020-08-30 16:56:04 ima start working on my torpedo launching system now
general 2020-08-30 16:56:04 ima start working on my torpedo launching system now
general 2020-08-30 16:58:29 i actually have a "fake" torpedo and a live torpedo to confuse the enemy and its working well
general 2020-08-30 16:58:42 i'm confusing kids on pvp
general 2020-08-30 16:59:18 but a fake torpedo wastes a torpedo tube slot
general 2020-08-30 16:59:27 still working on reload mechanism
general 2020-08-30 16:59:52 > Why do you have dummy torps though?
<@!505835349889777685>  as i said confusing people
general 2020-08-30 17:00:06 should i work on my torpedo reload system though
general 2020-08-30 17:00:22 i have 2 fake torps per 10 live ones
general 2020-08-30 17:00:33 well i have stupids
general 2020-08-30 17:01:01 26 torpedoes that can be launched from my destroyer though
general 2020-08-30 17:01:12 submarines are still the enemy
general 2020-08-30 17:01:27 just like german u boats in ww2
general 2020-08-30 17:02:04 how the hell do i work on torpedo reload mechanism
general 2020-08-30 17:02:42 yeah
general 2020-08-30 17:02:53 its hard to replicate irl
general 2020-08-30 17:03:00 in plane crazy i mean
general 2020-08-30 17:03:06 its 1 am wow
general 2020-08-30 17:03:54 should i add more torpedo tubes
general 2020-08-30 17:04:27 there should be "text transparency" on signs so i can have a semi-transparent text for gun sights
general 2020-08-30 17:08:32 should i get smaller torpedo but higher tube count yes or no
general 2020-08-30 17:08:45 should i get smaller torpedo but higher tube count yes or no
plane-crazy 2020-08-30 17:08:55 should i get smaller torpedo but higher tube count yes or no
general 2020-08-31 04:32:43 hm i wish there were cylindrical tnts for cylindrical torpedoes
general 2020-08-31 04:35:40 how can i make a torpedo tube without moving the destroyer warship from the above water magnet to push the torpedo
plane-crazy 2020-08-31 04:36:13 how can i make a torpedo tube without moving the destroyer warship from the above water magnet to push the torpedo
general 2020-08-31 04:36:36 i made a shredder bug and now the entire pvp server hates me
general 2020-08-31 04:36:46 i want cylindrical tnts
general 2020-08-31 04:37:04 but turrets are far worse now
general 2020-08-31 04:37:51 i saw a kid shred my shredder bug into pieces with a minigun
general 2020-08-31 04:38:11 ok
general 2020-08-31 04:38:39 i already deleted the save file for one save slot
general 2020-08-31 04:39:26 i am still working on my torpedo tube though
general 2020-08-31 04:39:58 since my torpedos launch outside of water the water props wont make it work
general 2020-08-31 04:40:24 i have seen 5 shredder bugs snap my 1.5k block cargo ship
general 2020-08-31 04:40:48 it was a 1.5k block cargo ship
general 2020-08-31 04:40:56 i build in mobile
general 2020-08-31 04:41:09 what
general 2020-08-31 04:41:55 since i watch prototrode now i must use locked motors
general 2020-08-31 04:42:07 prototrode eats locked motors for breakfast
general 2020-08-31 04:57:08 prototrode eats locked motors for breakfast
general 2020-08-31 04:57:48 how can i make a torpedo tube without moving the destroyer warship from the above water magnet to push the torpedo
general 2020-08-31 04:58:10 fun fact: prototrode eats locked motors for breakdast lunch and dinner
help 2020-08-31 04:58:57 how can i push a torpedo inna above water torpedo tube
help 2020-08-31 04:59:13 i'm working on a destroyer rn
help 2020-08-31 04:59:29 the above water torpedo launching is annoying
help 2020-08-31 04:59:38 already done
help 2020-08-31 04:59:48 how do i push it above water
help 2020-08-31 04:59:58 i use water propellers for it
help 2020-08-31 05:00:04 do i use magnets
help 2020-08-31 05:00:14 too short
help 2020-08-31 05:00:28 the torpedo is 6.5 blocks long
help 2020-08-31 05:01:00 if i use magnets it pushes my 800 block ship
help 2020-08-31 05:01:38 what do i set its strength
help 2020-08-31 05:02:01 firing
help 2020-08-31 05:02:10 still working on reloading system
help 2020-08-31 05:02:18 so i use pistons right
help 2020-08-31 05:02:35 my ship is planned to have 26 torpedo tubes
help 2020-08-31 05:02:42 so 13 on each side
help 2020-08-31 05:02:45 like how
help 2020-08-31 05:02:57 if i use magnets it moves my ship therefore ruining my aim
general 2020-08-31 05:03:23 launching torpedoes in plane crazy needs serious math
help 2020-08-31 05:04:01 the back has a wedge...
help 2020-08-31 05:04:13 the back has a half block i mean
general 2020-08-31 05:05:35 i remember dodging a torpedo by something close to 5 blocks and it was the happiest moment in my life since my ship was crippled at that point i was waiting for the rocket launchers to reload to shoot at the enemy
general 2020-08-31 05:05:44 pvp is fun
help 2020-08-31 05:06:02 then my torpedo tips downp

plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:06:07 oh, that was just from a youtube tutorial on how to make your plane not be a mess of control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:06:28 i'll do a test of my plane vs shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:06:39 maximum guns and rockets
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:07:22 i'd expect before i even leave the pad shredder bugs have already made my plane a mess of bricks
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:07:29 532 bricks
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:09:00 i have anti shredder weapons tho so it should be a breeze
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:09:52 idk, but in the meantime you can use my vip idk
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:10:04 dms?
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:10:08 ok
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:10:19 if yall need a vip send me a dm idk
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:10:33 i'll be ok if yall can use my vip
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:10:47 btw how do i fix my rudders it doesnt do anything
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:11:06 if i turn it it just makes my plane turn a few degrees
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:11:25 how do you make a rudder work/how should i use it
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:11:37 i have a separate button for rudder turn
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:12:30 alright
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:12:45 so i won't use it and rely on my roll to turn
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:12:56 rol left and right and go up right?
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:13:15 just roll?
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:13:25 45° or 90°?
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:13:48 ok
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:13:55 that was what i meant btw
general 2021-03-20 12:14:29 the game name feels like its on r/arabfunny
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:14:57 so i won't
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:15:00 alright
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:15:07 just decorative then
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:16:33 the way my plane works is that since theres no control surfaces used for moving my plane stays on 1 orientation so roll doesnt fix itself same with pitch
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:17:00 easier turning
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:18:28 yeah, most planes turn with that
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:18:51 some can turn with rudders if i am right
bot-central 2021-03-20 12:20:08 !servers

plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:23:07 how to make conveyor drive?
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:23:16 trying to outrun shredders
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:24:17 alright
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:24:34 i'm going for 600+ speeds for no reason aswell
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 12:24:49 and for some reason trails isnt working for me
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 17:30:52 my fighter's fuselage replaced with glass escept for certain parts. 
helium: red
cockpit open motor: orange/brown
aileron motors: green
elevator motors: yellow
rudder motors: pink: 
ballast: blue
i'm taking suggestions for propulsion systems as an escape mechanism on pvp for example shredders
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 17:31:44 the plane itself:
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 17:31:57 for some reason it pitches up
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 17:32:24 maybe because its on the conveyor engine's design
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 17:32:33 the helium is pushing it up
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 17:32:47 i did so
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 17:33:09 roblox physics is a mess
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 17:33:59 so i have to remove the entire thing required for steering at high speeds and pitching up huh
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 17:34:22 any other high speed propulsion other than con engine
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 17:34:36 is hover thing engine a thing

plane-crazy 2021-03-20 17:35:39 is it nyoom?
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 17:35:51 looking for short bursts of 1500+
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 17:36:24 my plane can maneuver good so control surfsces are no problem for me
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 17:36:36 1000-1500 speeds
plane-crazy 2021-03-20 17:36:54 maximum speed is 350+
creations-chat 2021-03-20 17:37:03 do i need to cram more super rockets in?
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 13:24:28 is 603 good speed for fighter?
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 13:25:25 my top speed with conveyors is 1700, but highly unstable at turns and if turning will spin out of control
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 13:25:44 i'm fixing my conveyor drive for more stability
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 13:26:23 when rolling/pitching up/rudder it will oscilate extremelly fast somehow removing the control surfaces from the motors
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 13:26:48 do you have to pick for a specific area to put your conveyor drive or can it be anywhere?
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 13:29:05 which part of the plane? wings, back, front? where exactly
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 13:29:12 center of mass?
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 13:29:53 i dont understand how conveyor drives work, i only knownthat conveyor drives makes build go nyoom
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 13:30:40 which part of the wing
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 13:30:56 zenithn't moment 😳
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 13:31:54 so there's a random part of a conveyor drive on my right wing so if someone gets a hole on my right wing (aka completely remove it) i have no exit speeds?
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 13:32:49 "you got a hole on your left wing" they said, all i see is my entire left wing flying
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 13:33:00 whats the average speed of shredders
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 13:33:30 gonna make the ultimate joestar secret technique drive against shredders
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 13:33:48 do are is shred er speeds?
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 13:40:17 lmao i tried sending the jojo copypasta
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 13:41:51 is it also bad if some kids made a stationary minigun sorta thing and just started blasting you when trying to fly on pvp
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 13:42:30 they will literally wait for you to try flying and then destroy my left and right wing
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 15:03:36 is there any good landing gear for small fighters
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 15:03:49 the default landing gear is stiff
plane-crazy 2021-03-24 15:04:06 makes landing almost impossible

plane-crazy 2021-05-08 12:22:25 better than how i build
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 12:23:18 suggestion: add a way to make builds symmetrical

plane-crazy 2021-05-08 12:26:29 suspensions make my tonk oscilate a lot if it falls from a tall ish height
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 12:26:45 and it hits the track part
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 12:59:51 amphibious tonk
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 13:00:33 you can turn by turning the tonk
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 13:00:59 basically making one tread go reverse and one go forward just like on land
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 13:01:31 but pressing w will make newtons 3rd law go brr and pitches the tonk up
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 14:17:56 so uhhhh can someone help me the handling on my jet is super slow on rolling
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 14:18:48 it uses twice the panels than the tail but it wont turn much
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 14:19:05 the ailerons are the width of the wing
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 14:20:05 dude i dont use control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 14:20:14 i turn wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 17:14:02 how do i compress guns using motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:23:44 guys help my turret has epilepsy
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:24:10 
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:24:23 its on wheels for a test rn but it will be bad for pvp on my ship
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:25:19 thr reason theres motors is because i am on the prototrode religion which has motorlock as its deity
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:36:34 and it cant be unanchored
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:43:54 if i remove the motorlock it fixes itself
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:53:18 nvm it wont work even if i tried
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:53:34 if it had a roof it wont work much
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:53:52 i removed the roof for testing
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:54:22 neh gun depression is useless on ships
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:54:58 i have a question: how useful is gun depression on a ship
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:55:41 either way its gun depression was 3 degrees
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:55:50 same with elevation
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:56:56 how do i put gun elevation when motorlock removes room for gun elevation
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:57:29 uhh whats the horizon ur talking about
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:58:04 that reminds me of something
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:58:40 did someone come into that at 2 am +8 gmt saying how it looks good
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:58:55 with a mostly red avatar
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:59:13 or am i mistaken and ur a diffrent person
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 13:59:57 did u blow up a ship that looked like this on water and u said haha optimized spaceship go brrr
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:00:16 so it *was* you
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:00:26 what a coincedence
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:00:49 no magazine
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:01:06 hold ima give link on a warship turret thing
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:02:07 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:02:23 anyway its used in pre-radar ships
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:03:22 its like a rangefinder iirc
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:04:02 this
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:04:27 https://youtu.be/_yBbb7DyWKo
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:04:43 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:04:46 me idiot
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:05:05 edited the link
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:05:16 i know
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:05:32 now me is are of the big idiot you see
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:05:46 so yes i shoved it on all turrets
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:06:00 i should remove em
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:06:52 still a wip tho, HOW DO I ADD TORPEDOES THAT ISNT FAT AT ALL
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:07:07 that is 1 block wide
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:07:39 yep
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:09:18 yes
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:09:24 lemme get link
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:09:56 https://www.roblox.com/games/166986752?privateServerLinkCode=29774087434411568076358165934317
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:10:31 imma just watch a tutorial torpedo
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:10:41 i hate copying from tutorials
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:11:01 it kills the fun of having to get the build urself
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:11:12 i just do it as a last resort
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:11:32 tbf i learned how to smooth builds using tutorials
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 14:23:53 no more optical rangefinder
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 00:27:11 suggestion: shredder bugs inn pvp server should be banned
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 00:27:31 shredders commit warcrimes by unlawfully destroying builds
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 01:10:45 imagine tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 01:12:20 but still its based off a tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 01:13:01 anyway i made a drift tonk
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 01:13:19 why ping rick
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 01:16:50 lmao my drift tonk works too well
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 01:20:30 lmao my drift tonk literally has TREADS and it drifts
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 01:20:41 that would be illegal
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 01:20:56 have you ever seen a MBT drift
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 01:23:48 impossible
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 01:24:06 its treads have too much traction
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 01:24:13 tbf its snow tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 01:24:28 snow is ice in powder form
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 01:25:13 except i did it with my tonk and now it drifts
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 01:25:24 i switched fabric to ice
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 01:31:18 shouldnt the crew be drowning then
plane-crazy 2021-05-10 17:18:30 amogus
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 03:24:11 when auto balancing using ballasts and helium should the helium be above or in the center of mass
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 04:12:19 part of my ship literally freaked out and heres the result
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 04:12:39 that's half of the ship
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 04:24:00 i am the ultimate skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 04:24:11 should i set my fold joints to lock
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 04:25:41 also why is everything blurple all of a sudden in some other servers
general 2021-05-11 10:55:07 skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:14:54 should i add side armor for the tracks
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:15:18 wgat does si mean
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:15:32 me is not of the speak of spanish
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:16:16 ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:16:34 anyway should i add side armor plating for my tonl
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:16:49 so mispelling is unde now huh
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:17:25 ok i guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:17:35 my tonk is a mess
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:17:43 i am the definition of skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:17:56 the suspension
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:18:03 THE SUSPENSION
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:19:05 anyway in pvp is the tracks the main target to disable a tonk before finishing it
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:19:18 amogus
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:19:47 youre so sussy i know you took my 19 dollar fortnite card
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:20:42 should i use block x0.9 or just normal blocks and tnt for the side armor for my tonk tracks
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:21:00 motorlock will make it so the blocks are hugging the tracks
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:46:10 so now i cant say sussy now hmm
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:47:22 how in the actual fuck do i add side armor to my tonk
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:47:52 if it huggs the tracks using motorlock it struggles to turn
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:50:25 weak armor
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:50:35 time to use wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:51:58 how do i combine motorlock and pisron lock then
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:53:37 so should i use wing panels for thin armor
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:53:52 i just want it to survive 1 rocket or few gunshots
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:54:06 so that the tracks wont disconnect
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:54:33 how much damage can a wing panel even survive
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:54:55 how many rocket
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:55:00 ah ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:55:13 does damage leak through from rockets
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:55:20 or just tnt
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:55:38 tnt is indestructable right?
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:56:00 should i overuse tnt
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:56:08 on the tonk
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:56:47 ive seen some kids using guided missiles so should i not use tnt armor
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:57:33 *cries in physics lag*
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:58:05 i dont know, just doing this as a test lmao
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:58:40 preparing to die but dying is part of my plan
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 14:59:23 150 speeds on 75% throttle
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 15:00:12 so with 75 throttle it should be around 100 speeds
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 15:32:15 is good tonk side armor or should i reduce or add
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 15:35:33 95 top speed
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 15:36:03 turns slowly because wing armor
bot-central 2021-05-11 15:51:15 !servers
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:16:00 is the turret too big?
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:16:51 after i am done with the turret ill put [         ] on  the tonk
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:17:09 damn why cant i spell [         ]
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:17:36 ok done with the camoflage joke, is the turret too big
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:18:34 camoflage
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:18:48 [         ]
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:19:02 its meant to be invisible
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:19:10 because camoflage
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:19:56 shit
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:20:19 9% decrease in physics 75-66
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:22:03 overall 44% decrease in physics
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:29:03 or vehicles that fly slow
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:29:37 i bet the second i go to pvp with my tonk it will be destroyed by a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:29:53 also ping me if u want my vip idk
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:32:19 how many rockets should i motorlock in mhy tonk
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:32:27 current count is 5
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:36:02 separate suspension for mine
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:36:16 if u want u can see my tonk
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:36:37 better that mine tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:36:46 had to make smol since shit cpu
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:37:01 and i still havnt started with camo
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:37:28 motorlock+wing panels (may slow down turning due to the wing's drag)
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:41:18 nearly final, just camoflage left
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:43:45 tonk on the build area before motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:44:09 yall are free to copy from the images but good luck on configs n shit
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:44:28 big AND eats your cpu
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:44:51 shift f4
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:45:05 if ur on mobike that sucks
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:45:22 look at physicstrue
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:45:29 the lower the percent the worse
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:45:35 1180 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:45:48 physicsreal is 100% good
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:46:01 load a tonk or something
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:47:24 on toknk
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:47:54 idk
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:48:01 anyway load the build
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:48:13 then it will say physics lag
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:48:47 good cpu i guess
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:49:30 good thing my laptop fits the recommended specs for boblox
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:49:46 sure
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:50:18 also should i focus on gun elevation or depression
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:50:29 it has 8 degrees gun depression
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 16:50:40 depression means how much it aims down
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 23:39:06 gonna paint the camouflage and i'm done
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 23:39:28 
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 23:39:51 50 physics lag. 1200 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-05-11 23:40:24 iz good tonk?
creations-chat 2021-05-11 23:41:39 what should i do to the tonk except for green camoflage
creations-chat 2021-05-11 23:44:06 like... **HOW**
creations-chat 2021-05-11 23:46:20 improving time lets hope the tension springs wont interfere
creations-chat 2021-05-11 23:49:05 should i tension the front using motorlock
creations-chat 2021-05-11 23:51:08 i think the armor is angled so the shell has more to travel through actually
creations-chat 2021-05-11 23:59:11 i was wrong then
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 17:58:12 how do i compress 50 rockets using motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 18:00:00 so ill just put a rocket in every 2 block long gap in my plane + conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 18:00:36 what do i do then
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 18:00:49 i need 700 to 2300 speeds
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 18:01:01 jet
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 18:02:18 cylinders?
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 18:02:40 i use cylinders on motorlock not wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 18:02:48 to clear confusion
plane-crazy 2021-05-12 18:03:11 motor lock

general 2021-06-08 15:20:09 is it bannable?
general 2021-06-08 15:21:07 also why does no motorlock=bad here now
general 2021-06-08 15:21:33 ok
general 2021-06-08 15:21:48 i know it doesnt makes sense for me tho
general 2021-06-08 15:22:00 i havnt touched motorlocc yet
general 2021-06-08 15:32:28 whats astrocraft
general 2021-06-08 15:32:41 fuck it imma try the game
general 2021-06-08 15:32:51 i mean exprience-

general 2021-07-04 08:05:17 how to show physics lag
general 2021-07-04 08:05:21 what key combo
general 2021-07-04 08:05:35 i've taken a break from roblox and just re learning everything
general 2021-08-02 11:52:01 small concept for thrust vectoring, completely unnessecarry but idk, bored ig
general 2021-08-02 11:52:25 i could have make it more compact but eh atm i'm just trying to make it work
plane-crazy 2021-08-02 12:01:10 thrust vector control mechanism, works without the game freaking out
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 03:29:25 any suggestions for the nose shape?

plane-crazy 2021-08-08 03:34:46 anyway can someone please rate my plane if it's good idk lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-08 03:37:20 i don't know
general 2021-08-08 03:37:51 guys in war thunder where the bullet thing shows do you put the cursor or the crosshair of the guns itself
general 2021-08-08 03:38:14 i've been wondering whi i'm always behind the enemy
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:47:36 how do i stop my plane from wobbling
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:48:54 i have a lot of wing panels\
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:49:24 150 explosives
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:49:37 so moar panels?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:50:19 ouch
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:51:46 so huge motorlock there?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:51:52 time to slap on some canards then
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:52:23 so the answer is: wobbling? SLAP MORE WINGS
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:52:33 this reminds me of people slapping moar boosters in ksp
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:56:16 generic fighter thingy
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 07:58:20 so more wing panels to prevent from wobbling?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:26:38 i'm looking for migs to make in war thunder lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:26:46 any reccomendations
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:26:52 no more generic jets
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:26:59 going all out on this build
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:28:09 also making a torpedo bomber as a ship killer
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:29:22 how do you see the models of aircraft that you dont own lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:29:33 i have a mig that liiks interesting enough for me
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:30:48 at least the designing phase is over since i have a design to plane crazy-fy
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:31:21 ok so
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:31:45 ok so i'm going motorlock for the afterburner tail thingy?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:32:40 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:32:45 shoving some motorlock in
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:32:58 there isnt a thing called not enogh motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:33:11 ok so do i use motor 2 or motor 1 for the sweep wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:34:02 mate this is my first time making variable sweep wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:36:19 probably this too, i mean its a mig
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:36:40 but seriously it would look interesting when i boost with my conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:37:18 also, is wasd control better than mouse control?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:37:27 i mean my control keys are qweasd
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:38:21 huh, the video that i saw by destroyer said to use wasd
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:38:31 who knows
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:38:44 i'll prolly train with wasd with war thunder yes or yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:39:54 how to wasd in war thunder
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:40:16 this?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:40:45 tryna aim on controls for wasd
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:40:48 because yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:42:13 ok so custom control surfaces on bigger plane so no cheese shredder control surfaces right?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:44:09 how to seamless
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:44:13 moterlock?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:53:34 ok so motor 1 for parts of planes that swivel n shit right?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:53:50 whats a cameralock btw
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:55:09 gonna make variable sweep wings before i work on the fuselage itself
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:56:27 oh shit the landing gear i forgot
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:56:40 usually a day or something
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:56:51 i'll spend a week of my life perfecting this mig 23
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:57:06 yeah it isnt that much
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:57:44 how the FUCK DO I DO THIS LANDING GEAR]
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 09:58:17 i am not accepting the landing gear the game gives you
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:09:39 lol its you right?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:09:47 the one with the red jet speeding last night?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:10:44 how do you do the landing gear
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:10:52 i'm trying to make an entirely original mig 23
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:10:55 suffering
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:11:12 i'm looking for landing gear tutorials, swept wings is ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:11:25 nah i dont want cheese grater wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:11:58 when you move it, it cheesegraterfies
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:12:37 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:12:47 i want it flush with the fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:12:56 i have swept wings done now
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:13:07 hold
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:13:24 anyway how do you selectively activate motorlocks?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:13:41 like how do you use the disconnectors to selectively turn on the motorlocks tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:14:07 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:14:17 like the motorlock turns on when you want it
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:14:37 where do i place the disconnectors tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:14:51 explosives will blow up the motorlocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:15:40 ohhh
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:15:42 til
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:16:22 i think i'm a bit too ambitious to make a mig 23 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:16:31 eh learning experience, yknow?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:18:56 how does cameralocking
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:20:09 ohhh tilted blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:20:38 time to save me some suffering and make the wings near the main pilot seat of my mig 23
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:22:21 i hate people who blast their earrape on servers with a burning passion
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:22:31 so i give them the taste of the m i n i g u n
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:23:17 i'd assume their tryna make like idk, warning thingys or smth
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:23:28 but it failed and its the beep from the grocery store
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:26:50 ok so is sketchfab a good source for plane source material
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:27:06 gonna start the build now
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:27:14 but seriously we need more wedges
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:27:58 also, how do you get motor 1's to go to the preferred angle?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 10:29:41 hit the ground? plane dead
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 11:06:01 ok so guys
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 11:06:09 mig 23 is pain
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 11:06:44 also why people think motorlock is the best
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 11:08:18 i know
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 11:08:21 but like
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 11:08:27 why is motorlock a religion here
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 12:25:10 guess i went in too ambitious with this mig 23 attempt
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 12:33:40 wing time
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 12:33:50 this is where i've been stressing over for hours
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 12:48:29 this actually might be possible
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 12:48:48 i wish i picked a different mig that didnt have variable swept wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 12:51:15 the build process will be smooth sailing besides the landing gear
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 12:51:38 car with cutter and you ram shit, or which i prefer, shredder bait
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 12:51:52 basically you got something big, then shove it full of tnt
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 12:51:59 explode when theyre near you
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 12:52:05 set everything to max
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 12:53:08 guys cheese shredder control surfaces or chad custom control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:04:56 cheese shredder
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:04:59 cheese grater
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:05:10 the control surfaces that use the stock parts
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:06:23 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:06:28 not enough motorlocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:06:47 bomber bait
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:06:59 i would go there and just spam bombs
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:07:18 anyway ill do the swept wings of the mig
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:08:41 also someone said my bombs were tutorial bombs lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:08:48 like the motorlock bombs
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:09:03 i based the bombs from prototrode but removed the delta wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:09:30 anyway how fast is the fastest shredder again?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:09:52 why isnt it commonly used tho?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:10:00 my generic jet reaches 4k
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:10:28 if they make a tutorial i will kill the person that made it
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:11:43 any way i can compact this mechanism?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:12:08 show me
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:12:20 when compressed it looks something else
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:12:46 which motor
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:12:54 the folding thing motor?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:13:54 and i flip the wedge thing too?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:14:14 
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:15:19 i just went to the top tier mig in the tech tree in wt lmao
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:15:29 and used it as the base
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:15:46 i prolly wont get a rank with my mig so eh
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:33:52 why am i doing this
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:34:52 also are turrets good or no?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:35:00 i just want your opinion
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 13:35:12 like base turrets spawnkilling people and blacklisting everyone
creations-chat 2021-08-09 13:36:12 should i upgrade?
creations-chat 2021-08-09 13:40:17 the sweep mechanism
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 14:19:07 how the fuck do i do this things afterburner
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 14:19:27 
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 14:19:32 how
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 14:20:53 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 14:20:58 pain
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 14:22:06 i need longer wedges
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 14:29:05 but how
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 14:40:59 im gonna fucking die with this
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 14:43:18 ok got it
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 14:43:24 just gonna make the intakes less wide
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 14:59:33 also do you think a scale tool deserves to be in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 14:59:46 if they did imagine the change in skill ceiling
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 15:00:13 being able to resize blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 15:00:47 ok so do i use x7 beams instead of x4s?
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 15:00:58 for optimization
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 15:23:08 got a less wider intake, build time maybe
plane-crazy 2021-08-09 15:23:26 excuse the naked fold mechanism
plane-crazy 2021-08-10 04:33:01 it had motorlock in the video so i did my part
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:49:00 did i compress this good?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:49:12 gun is for testing the smoothness
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:49:25 the less the going up and down the more smooth
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:50:52 eh its just a tonk sus
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:51:02 anyway 4 motors locked to compress
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:51:38 i'm literally using war thunder as a benchmark if its smooth enough
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:52:54 ok so my damping setting is at 100, is good?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:53:12 
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:53:16 is a bigger damping better
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:54:05 rip your spacebar tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:54:18 anyway get a new fucking keyboard
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:55:11 the only thing i hate about my compressed tank SUS is that its doing the seizure before i extend the rope
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:55:21 s p a c e b a r f l e x
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:55:38 dude just ctrl+c the spaces in the messages
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:56:01 compress fail
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:57:18 the suspension is so smooth
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:57:34 and once i go through a bump it does this satisfying thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:57:46 go to war thunder, drive a tank over a bump, you'll understand
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 03:59:24 1 more locked motor before it totally breaks?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:01:22 plane crazy 2!!!?!??!?!?!
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:02:30 prolly a little trolling
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:04:10 compress fail
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:04:23 wheres kill point?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:04:29 wait we have pc2?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:04:52 oh ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:05:17 well i thought windows 11 was a troll, well it was announced so i trust nobody at this point
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:06:09 lets hope pc2 has our saves moved to
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:06:23 i dont wanna move my overly large tonk block by block
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:06:31 i have a 2000 block tank
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:06:38 i dont wanna go through the pain
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:06:56 roblox feature, not pc feature
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:07:28 anyway imma hope its 10 bobux because i dont wanna spend 100 bobux for 1 month of shredder protection
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:11:12 how to get upvotes in <#384025409945337856>: motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:11:34 very basic motorlocked suspension
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:11:40 screenshot?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:15:27 if its on an unreachable room inside the terrain i'd prolly not surprised
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:15:43 ok so
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:15:59 do you agree slenders, copy and pastes, and the stitchface deserves to be banned
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:16:08 i hate htose people
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:16:11 the slenders
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:16:24 their avatars are NOT original for fucks sake
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:17:01 they'll prbably google some argument comebacks if id ever get into an argument into a ~~slender~~ waste of oxygen
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:18:49 probably
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:20:40 interesting
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:20:50 i think its an easter egg for something
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:20:59 have yall ever checked the hatch
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:47:27 do you agree roblox physics bad
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:48:23 tower
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:48:32 idio
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:49:41 i am in my vip atm
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:50:11 time to try to land on the island using my totally not hard to control mig 23
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:50:34 well thats out of the question, i'm out
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:50:49 seeing rick on chat is weird lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:51:13 terrain or normal walls?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:52:23 not here
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:54:46 not here
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:55:05 screen?

plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:56:11 activate your damn windows
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:57:11 it says 2
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:57:13 1 more
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:57:20 WE NEED 1 MORE
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:57:28 THERES A SIGN THAT SAYS 2
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:57:35 WE NEED TO FIND 1 MORE
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:58:36 you found it
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:58:41 theres a sign that says 2
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 04:58:49 lab
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:00:10 
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:00:13 well that was fast
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:00:44 ocean crazy?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:00:47 we make submarines
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:00:53 imagine submarine shredders
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:00:57 that will be a nightmare
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:01:04 shredders underwater
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:01:20 bigger plot in pc2 plez
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:02:24 infinite blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:02:30 let them have infinite blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:03:05 pc2 or second easter egg
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:03:14 bigger map ples
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 05:03:24 fish murder
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:08:20 tank suspensions when you go forward *smooth*
tank suspensions when you go backward: ***literally fucking dies***
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:13:18 thats why tank suspensions are totally useless
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:13:36 anyway why do i have a high pitched squeal sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:13:52 i hear it but when i talk about it they look at me like i'm insane
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:17:35 my suspension doesn't like rails, but still, you dont reverse in tank suspensions
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:18:02 i'll work on making it smooth and not die on the smallest of shocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:18:38 i don't do treads because lag
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:18:51 what's the suspension tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:22:00 bruh these tank treads are so terrible on rails
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:22:19 i mean all my aircraft has some degree of motorlock but damn, thats a lotta motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:23:41 i mean my horribley made jet has motorlock (that wasn't needed at all) and thats my first motorlocked build
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:24:20 ok thats more motorlocked
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:24:36 should i make a jet with the most motorlock i can slap it on?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:24:42 going for max detail
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:25:17 ok, time to look at war thunder and see if theres any good jets to remake
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:25:24 maximizing detail over performance
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:25:44 the first time i've saw someone with the ms store roblox
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:25:48 how's the bugs?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:26:25 ohh
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:26:39 i use the ms store roblox for alts as well, idk
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:26:48 but i'd never slap my main on ms store
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:26:56 that's just doing a crime on my main
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:27:36 bruh my cpu literally has 2 cores <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:28:53 the most motorlock i could put, so bad that i fly at 300 speeds shaky
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:29:02 like this plane is more shaky than my grandparents
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:29:54 150 tnt bomb
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:32:35 why is this not shaking like my grandparents
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:34:46 i dont have it as well, but not on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:34:57 i got my priorities straight, right?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:35:50 life can go fuck itself, i'd rather build a terrible plane on plane crazy and tell myself i'm the best builder than do anything else
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:36:48 this is the only motorlock on my (bad) mig 23 attempt
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:36:52 like to make the wing flush
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 15:38:06 if you say this is remotely good you are incorrect and you should reconsider your life choices to say that this is remotely good
general 2021-08-19 15:40:35 i hate existence
general 2021-08-19 15:41:00 why do i sleep for 12 hours a day
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 10:34:23 uhh can i report someone for crashing a server
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 10:34:37 he didnt like being said that his pc was bad and proceeded to crash the server
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 10:34:41 
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 10:34:49 the server's literally dead
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 10:35:02 but can i report?
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 10:35:25 yeah, at least i only affect my pc on rage instead of the entire server
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 11:16:03 will motorlock work on pc2?

plane-crazy 2021-08-23 11:17:47 my mig23 motorlocked version is... let's say it's bad if pc2 fixes motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 11:17:57 but imagine the backlash if that happens
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 11:19:10 i got into an argument with a kid that used unnecessary motorlock like bruh you didnt need motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-08-23 11:19:39 like dude its perfectly fine without the motorlock, youre just adding more physics lag lmao
