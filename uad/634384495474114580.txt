creations-chat 2020-11-15 13:01:37 bad thing is, the ship is terrible at landing
creations-chat 2020-11-15 13:07:50 it flies well though
creations-chat 2020-11-16 17:07:55 only real changes this time was the look and the internal systems
creations-chat 2020-12-21 11:01:50 can i ask here what to add to my build and show an image?
creations-chat 2020-12-21 11:05:46 so like this thing is like the [Spoilers] ||mega weapon thing in subnautica|| but i think it needs more stuff and i cant think of any could i have some ideas?
creations-chat 2020-12-21 11:12:05 that is actually one of the best ideas i have ever heard, i'll add some ground and plants, thank you! (maybe i'll add a radar next to it who knows)
creations-chat 2020-12-21 11:35:32 ok so i made this and it looks cool (im not good at terraforming) but i truly like how the ground has become, im going to add a few flowers and plants and some soil
creations-chat 2020-12-21 12:11:45 Its not meant to be precursor stuff, it was inspired by that structure but its not made by them, it was made by Xtasis patagona and thats their color scheme
creations-chat 2020-12-21 12:14:26 or did you mean the grass? **purple grass**
