help 2023-06-26 20:59:40 how do you get a rocket to yaw and pitch? i've tried it with mine using propellers  (im not experienced with rockets) and when i tried to pitch it more of an angle on its x axis, it just reverted back to its original position and swayed slightly
creations-chat 2023-06-26 21:26:47 tan
help 2023-06-26 21:36:37 no, rocket as in rocket ship
creations-chat 2023-06-26 22:10:33 i made a propulsive landing system (first time, yay)
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:12:19 hydrophobic
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:12:25 is it covered in oil?
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:13:21 ü§î
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:13:27 maybe remove the water
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:13:30 problem solved üëç
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:13:41 faacts
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:14:00 also how do i make a propulsive landing system without it looking like a death trap
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:14:24 death traps in plane crazy are just explosive blocks
bot-central 2023-06-26 22:14:33 !rank
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:15:18 build a cockinator
(its a chicken car)
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:15:25 ^^not what you thought
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:15:28 build a chicken car
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:16:14 just done use mouse control drive
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:16:55 use a vast amount of propellers instead
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:17:02 always works
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:17:45 button controls on top
I love pressing A with the least amount of force and my plane going 12.515e+2 studs to the left
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:18:29 rotation with vr headset????
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 22:18:31 someone try that
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 23:15:09 why does my landing system for my rocket ship completely fail sometimes at 2800 altitude?
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 23:15:12 for apparently no reason
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 23:15:51 ?
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 23:16:18 it uses rockets and engines to land (No parachute)
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 23:16:38 i did some goofy ass stuff and it worked
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 23:16:51 a crap ton of hover things and like 6 rockets did the job
plane-crazy 2023-06-26 23:17:10 i'll send you a ss of what it looks like dms
help 2023-06-27 14:29:33 its a d note, in bass clef (i absolutely hate smart asses)
help 2023-06-28 12:22:31 how do i get rid of this flat surface and make it pointy? (im at build height)
help 2023-06-28 12:24:29 add more rocket engines
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:32:01 guys how are you supposed to make a rocket without helium??
because when i try to it tilts to one side with no explainable cause, and it's impossible to be fixed either
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:32:15 add bombs
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:32:36 so why is that a requirement for rocket scientist??
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:32:43 thats not how a rocket works üòº
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:32:52 only for the payload do the engines go higher
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:32:56 to push the payload up
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:33:03 yeah but i want it realistic üò†
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:33:17 i mean my artemis uses hover thrusters to stabilize itself but thats not really realistic
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:33:22 üò±
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:33:32 add bombs to the rocket
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:34:48 frfr
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:35:30 but how do people do that stuff where they have builds 2x the size of the building area?
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:35:36 i need that for the rocket head
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:36:29 what is it called?
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:36:33 the way of disconnecting
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:36:37 i mean connecting
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:36:40 to make it bigger
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:36:58 grrr
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:37:01 aight lemme check
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:37:24 yeah thats right, thanks
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 12:41:54 how do i get rid of the motor after folding? it looks goofy
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:13:51 add a nose
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:14:51 from the looks of it they dont have that tilt after the window
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:14:52 like yours
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:14:56 they just go straight down
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:15:23 what country truck?
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:15:27 german, english, french?
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:15:36 what model
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:16:19 well at the top, they have that incline
But the sides are just flat

and at the bottom, it just goes straight down
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:16:21 no other stuff
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:16:24 just straight down
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:16:39 depends what truck
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:17:01 the style looks like an iveco np truck
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:17:03 sorta similar
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:17:08 check out those, get a standpoint
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:17:36 damnit
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:17:44 no image perms üò¢
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:18:33 yeah that
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:18:42 it looks similar
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:18:49 you can try going off of that so it doesnt look like garbage
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 13:19:41 like that sorta
creations-chat 2023-06-28 13:19:55 bomb
creations-chat 2023-06-28 13:23:00 first rocket ship
yaya
(Artemis I, yes i know the hover thrusters look stupid but its the only way i could get it to actually perform a propulsive landing without parachutes or anchors)
(also i'd like a some feedback, thanks)
creations-chat 2023-06-28 13:25:05 too large for that tip there (it hits build limit, and idk how to fold), but i can try and fix that
(and make it align)
creations-chat 2023-06-28 13:27:15 connector? whats that
(idk how to build things to look good, sorry, any way i could improve?)
help 2023-06-28 13:34:18 add helium blocks
creations-chat 2023-06-28 13:50:18 any better? (best i could do at my skill level)
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:02:39 looks closer to an american style truck
try making that slant below the window less noticable and more subtle
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:03:03 that would have to include pushing back the nose of the truck
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:03:04 yes
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:03:33 lights are fine, realistically the indicator would be on the side and IN the lights, which you cant replicate
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:03:46 ohh, alright
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:03:54 try using half wedge up/down?
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:03:59 you can try, idk if it'd be good though
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:04:03 just to reduce the slant
creations-chat 2023-06-28 14:04:24 fixed the colour pallete and made the top white
general 2023-06-28 14:04:45 what the hell is that
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:06:10 fair, still looks goofy though ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:06:13 although
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:06:18 you could just make it completely flat
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:06:19 if that works
bot-central 2023-06-28 14:06:37 /rank
bot-central 2023-06-28 14:06:40 !rank
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:07:08 damn
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:07:12 guess there's nothing you can do
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:07:19 it's fine, build the rest of the truck
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:07:31 or make it bigger
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:07:36 scale it up
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:07:40 to make it better
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:07:41 ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:08:03 show me
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:08:23 ooohhh
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:08:25 have fun loser üòÇ
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:08:49 more like this
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:08:54 have fun muahahahaha
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:09:01 this is why i dont build cars
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:09:16 i just build rockets, they're just cylinders with an engine taped on
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:10:52 real
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:14:05 fair
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:14:13 i have a cool idea for you to try with that truck
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:14:17 unless you're gonna do it already
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:14:29 try adding the a locking mechanism when something goes over the truck
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:14:32 to lock it in place
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:14:38 ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:14:38 use of pistons idk
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:14:43 to act like a crate
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:14:46 yeahh
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:14:47 magnet
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:14:48 that was it
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:14:57 you could add crates the truck could hold or smth
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:15:28 and just asking, does the truck head and body have separate physics?
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:15:30 like a real truck
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:15:50 not physics
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:15:51 but like
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:15:55 how it's sorta separated
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:15:58 and not a big block
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:16:00 like a car
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:16:07 üëç
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:16:28 nice
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:17:12 nice
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:17:21 now add a bed in the interior üòà
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:17:26 realism
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:17:31 very cool
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:19:16 very cool
try removing the half wedges above the window, see how it looks
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:19:44 oh
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 14:21:10 aight
creations-chat 2023-06-28 14:54:39 w.i.p delta II, anything i could improve?
(haven't added the interstages yet)
creations-chat 2023-06-28 14:56:56 build height, and idk how to fold and its very confusing (even if i tried to learn, in which i did try)
creations-chat 2023-06-28 15:22:33 why does this happen?
when i disconnect at the interstage and the 1st stage just rams through and into the 2nd stage
creations-chat 2023-06-28 15:34:14 fixed it, made the reverse thruster to originally help with this on/off mode only, which allowed it to immediately disconnect
creations-chat 2023-06-28 16:18:27 yeah, just figured that out
(i made all the thrusters decrease button the button for 2nd stage deploy, so that the stage 1 thrusters atleast slow down so it doesnt ram into it)
creations-chat 2023-06-28 17:26:59 just make a mouse tracking rotation system with motor 2s
boom, done
creations-chat 2023-06-28 17:29:24 motor lock it all into one block
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 20:22:36 add a willy
plane-crazy 2023-06-28 20:22:40 to the mech

general 2023-07-07 12:08:17 idk, maybe the sun is gonna make them visible
general 2023-07-07 12:09:18 well its between sunset and sunrise, or in bad weather apparently
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 20:59:03 guys
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 20:59:04 emergency
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 20:59:07 best move??? right??
