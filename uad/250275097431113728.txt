creations-chat 2018-11-17 19:34:51 Ive just made a new plane
help 2018-11-17 19:42:52 The plane keeps going left / right when I try to fly it.I checked it and its perfectly balance.Maybe its because of the motors made to move the wings up / down (like the Star-wars fighters).I blocked those with some blocks but the same problems occurs. Any ideas <@!163143541160148992> ?

plane-crazy 2021-04-19 15:14:39 
creations-chat 2021-04-27 15:28:57 From what i can tell in the photos, i feel like its a bit too wide. Either that or its too short.
 
For the hull, the back barrels need rework, since they're ugly so far apart from the tank. Maybe you could motorlock them in (still, thats my opinion, dont change it if you dont feel like it).

The IR spotlight looks unrealistic, maybe you could replace the ladders with a .9 block inside, and giving it a ice texture(maybe???, test to see if you like it). 

The smoke launchers could be angled motor locked inside, since i dont think they would be effective at 90*. The Spotlights are also too big, and im not a fan of the wheeled tracks. The engine exshaut could also be improved.

But, besides that, you really nailed the turret and the hull shape, altough, as i said, could be narrowed. The color pallete is also very nice, and the breach shape is intresting.
Hope this helps :D

plane-crazy 2021-10-03 08:41:56 nah
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:18:34 the tree in the corner should have snow on it i feel like, its out of place
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:37:06 <@221487880487436288> could you give me some feedback on whats wrong with the tank
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:40:19 Hmm while i agree the tank is a bit too tall the turret is good, it might be the perspective (unpainted pic)
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:42:58 Its 2.5 blocks tall, on earlier variants i had it 3 block tall, and it was too tall, and piston locking it would be an issue since the frontal turret roof is already piston & motor angled
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:45:01 Well, id consider this a preference instead of a problem, since basically i dont have the space, motors, and server latency left too add them. I'd rather take fake tracks since they dont look bad from other people's perspective while moving
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:50:16 I honestly dont think its worh they effort making it laggier than it already is, its as optimized i could get (well while keeping the original form since reworking big parts of it would be a waste of time), and even so, it has a 1/10 chances of crashing
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:54:37 Pepsi has a point, it is indeed a mess, and while its certainly my fault I didn't make space for working threads, its most likely impossible to add working treads on such a motor lock monster. Theres a functionality/detail balance that just doesnt work
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:58:15 Look the hidropneumatic suspension is just a bit raised ok )
creations-chat 2021-10-03 20:10:28 Thx puri :D
creations-chat 2021-10-03 20:42:12 Uh.. well it barely moves due to the weight so it uses a conveyor engine that gets the job done somewhat but turning is a problem
creations-chat 2021-10-03 20:46:00 Personally, i dont like treads (exept maybe zach/guggi tracks), but because the lag, need for explosive blocks and problems with spawning, looks, and viewer moving descrepancy id rather take wheels over moving tracks

However id rather to fake tracks than wheels
creations-chat 2021-10-03 20:49:18 Not really, for example my style uses either disconnectors or signs to get the tracks look, and above them i make the wheels, making it purely visual and getting the movement done by a conveyor engine. However if you can make some overlapping roadwheels to get the german-style tracks without using tracks
creations-chat 2021-10-03 20:51:48 In case modern mbts i see a lot of people just use wheels, in that case yes add individual suspension
creations-chat 2021-10-21 09:10:59 I did, after taking a closer look its not as good as i thought. The driver optics are a bit too high, and the turret, while i understand is hard to make, is not great either
creations-chat 2021-10-21 09:13:41 Oop wanted to say i revoked my upvote, thats what i thought he ment
creations-chat 2021-10-21 09:18:08 Well i got it wrong, my fault, but i still want to give some feedback on the tank
creations-chat 2021-10-21 09:24:18 First off, there's this motor sticking out, not sure if its fixable on that side but kinda destroys the look, then theres that bag that i feel its a bit too low and its clipping inside the turret (personal preference probably) and also this part which i don't really get
creations-chat 2021-10-21 09:26:53 The original T-55s dont have ejection ports they only appear from the T-62 onwards, i don't really know about the arabic T-55s, but im guessing they dont have them either
creations-chat 2021-10-21 09:29:45 The front is also nicely made the only problem i see is the driver vision ports being raised a bit too hight, you could use piston locking to fix it easily, and the IR Spotlight looks a bit out of touch because of the color (maybe use a darker shade of white?) But overall i really appreciate the front <@718409831639154718>
creations-chat 2021-10-21 10:13:08 Naaa bruhh na no way bruh it be only the extremely advanced syrian shell ejection system no way you just be maddin

the-dump 2021-10-27 10:40:47 still tho you killed me eariler in the T-54
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:41:40 what
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:41:44 i just didnt see
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:42:10 ‚ò†Ô∏è
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:43:04 i was looking to my right since a teammate died from there
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:43:18 i didnt expect an enemy so close
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:44:06 yeah i was .5 seconds away from shooting you
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:44:14 my gun was lowering on you
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:44:55 i did not see you until too late
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:45:06 still though had a good dogfight after killing you with a Arado
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:45:25 i actually did not
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:45:45 let me check the replay
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:46:23 (it did not end well)
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:47:24 yeah i just checked the replay
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:47:33 i was looking to my left
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:47:54 and another factor was
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:48:07 i was kinda sleepy so the bushes acutually worked
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:48:16 you are the exact color as the trees around
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:48:28 well kinda
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:48:39 true
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:50:16 yah so this was my POV
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:50:26 this is why i didnt see you until you were too lae
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:50:33 
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:51:22 yup
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:51:34 you can also clearly see on the map theres someone scouted
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:51:41 and MGs are coming from that way
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:52:32 i didnt hear you at all
the-dump 2021-10-27 10:52:42 that was a fun match still

general 2022-05-19 18:12:01 Have you ever tried Ho-155 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2022-05-19 18:12:50 Yeah i didn't really have problems with them that much
general 2022-05-19 18:13:25 Ho-5s do tended to spark sometimes
general 2022-05-19 18:13:29 But now its fixed
general 2022-05-19 18:13:49 Either Tracers or Air Targets
general 2022-05-19 18:14:05 ~~skill issue~~
general 2022-05-19 18:14:27 Like Navy Type 99 cannons are probably the easiest to aim
general 2022-05-19 18:14:40 Especially in turns
general 2022-05-19 18:14:47 Although not a kot of ammo
general 2022-05-19 18:14:55 Well thats the thing
general 2022-05-19 18:15:04 You dont go for bombers in a zero
general 2022-05-19 18:15:15 Then what?
general 2022-05-19 18:15:19 J2M2?
general 2022-05-19 18:15:37 Japanese belts don't damage bombers
general 2022-05-19 18:15:48 Unless 30mms
general 2022-05-19 18:15:57 No?
general 2022-05-19 18:16:08 I mean not as good as american ones
general 2022-05-19 18:16:14 Those things are busted
general 2022-05-19 18:16:19 But still do their job

general 2022-11-06 13:42:31 Huh
general 2022-11-06 13:43:12 I know
