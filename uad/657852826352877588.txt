general 2020-04-12 12:59:07 hello people
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:20:11 Wait i just saw an old picture and i saw a **vulcano** in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:20:20 There was a vulcano!?
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:23:50 **make a dev add it back for vip servers**
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:24:14 Why not
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:24:26 Was it like really **really** bad
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:31:08 Can't a dev at least add a vulcano or something or a cool new thing to the map
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:31:26 A mountain, arctic stuff etc
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:32:51 > A mountain, arctic stuff etc
***Hol up***
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:33:06 An arctic area, not a bad idea right
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:46:02 How do i make a plane that looks nice, has all blocks attached to the plane (so no counterweight that isn't attached to the plane), has a decent speed, is stable and is able to adjust pitch, roll and yaw with only wings?

I have only achieved everything but the "no detached parts". It's really hard to do this as i just cannot manage to not ruin the design AND align the CoL and CoG
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:47:55 (CoL is center of lift and cog is center of gravity for those who don't understand
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:49:17 Well i have a plane that is extremely fast and is somewhat stable (Only while accellerating tho!) But i can only align the CoL and CoG by adding a counterweight in the back of my plot
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:49:47 Long story short; I suck at building, please help me
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 07:43:08 > fps lag?
<@283153622496182274> i get fps lag AND physics lag
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 12:41:59 What's the cutter block for?
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 12:42:46 **So i can make a creation shredder?**
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 12:43:08 Time to build a creation shredder which then incinerates the blocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 15:01:14 Has anyone ever wondered if it is possible for a GPS system (Map or plane-based autopilot) to be added
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 15:01:40 I wanted to suggest this but i can't get a rank
help 2020-06-05 12:46:24 can anyone help me with my Sukhoi SU-57? It's stable, but that's only because i added weight at the back of my plot, and if it's not accellerating, it just gives up and goes crazy
help 2020-06-05 12:49:22 k
help 2020-06-05 12:50:11 
help 2020-06-05 12:50:16 check the right
help 2020-06-05 12:50:35 yeah a very poorly made one
help 2020-06-05 12:50:58 it has a magnet drive in it
help 2020-06-05 12:51:22 so how would i fix it
help 2020-06-05 12:52:12 i meant conveyor**
help 2020-06-05 12:52:18 it has conveyor not magnet
help 2020-06-05 12:54:46 yes
help 2020-06-05 12:55:26 google it
help 2020-06-05 12:56:28 okay so it just like rotates down if i stop the engine
help 2020-06-05 12:56:35 like, the cockpit facing down
help 2020-06-05 12:57:03 does this have to do with lift or anything?
help 2020-06-05 13:14:17 someone?
help 2020-06-05 13:18:01 yes.
help 2020-06-05 13:19:02 
help 2020-06-05 13:19:09 if i just turn it off for one second
help 2020-06-05 13:20:29 but can anyone help me fix the flinging problem and how i can align the center of grav with lift?
help 2020-06-05 13:35:05 i think i fixed it
help 2020-06-05 13:51:46 It's somewhat stable but not suitable as fighter jet, bomber or anything else.
help 2020-06-05 13:51:58 just a plane that's too fast but stable.

help 2020-06-05 16:05:51 When i try to take-off, it immediately flips and well
help 2020-06-05 16:06:40 it just flies downwards

<@296280922771292170> the word 'noob' is not meaningless at all, but i understand what you're trying to say. Only thing is that it's just annoying that people use 'sarcasm and meaningless words' whenever you say any goddamn thing on the internet, and especially on roblox.

plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:15:27 hi everyone
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:15:30 i have a question
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:15:54 does it matter if your plane's center of lift is above the center of mass
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:16:44 because i'm making a drone, and i can go forward/backwards but if i fly forward it slowly starts to roll
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:16:55 but the center of lift and mass are aligned
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:17:07 except for that the center of lift is above the center of mass
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:18:15 flying upwards and downwards goes straight
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:18:24 but as soon as you go forward or backwards it starts to roll
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:18:38 and rotate
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:18:47 it works just like a real drone
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:18:58 there is another motor under the motors you see
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:19:13 which makes either the front pair or the pair at the back turn slower
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:19:18 so the drone moves forwards
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:19:34 it does that
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:20:29 the motors you see here control forward/backwards
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:21:00 well the issue is that if i go forward with the drone it rotates out of nowhere
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:21:10 but there are no systems that do rotation yet so
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:21:18 i don't get how it rotates
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:21:34 by that i mean that i can't turn the drone
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:23:00 alright
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:23:30 ah
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:24:45 which way should they be orientated?
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:47:22 i added control panels and it made it stabler i guess
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:47:28 but now it's hard to steer
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:48:36 they don't generate lift right
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:48:47 or at least not as much lift as propellor rotors
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:48:56 propellor blades*
plane-crazy 2021-03-06 14:50:31 i could also make the drone more drone-like by adding another motor for every rotor so instead of turning i just move left and right
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 08:23:45 hi everyone, i today once again have a problem with my drone
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 08:25:21 i did the systems to go forward/backwards, and i made a start for the cockpit. it flies more stable but still wants to rotate
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 08:26:31 i think this has something to do with the double motors, because i can see that the up/down motors also rotate the forward/backwards motors while they're not supposed to.
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 08:26:46 how do i prevent the motors from turning each other?
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 08:28:35 yeah it's confusing
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 09:25:25 okay someone please help
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 09:26:05 i'm redoing my drone but if i go upwards it starts swinging randomly

plane-crazy 2021-04-23 17:00:05 how do i make stable rotors tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 17:08:39 k wait
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 17:09:19 how am i gonna join i don't have you as a friend

plane-crazy 2021-04-23 18:13:08 okay so i have this helicopter body without propellors or anything
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 18:13:12 what should i make with it
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 18:14:17 i can't make helicopters sadly
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 18:14:26 well i can't make working stable rotors
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 18:15:05 i can try to make a drone out of it tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 18:36:59 how do i make stable vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 18:37:03 nothing i make is stable
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 19:04:04 so uh
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 19:04:10 i made my quadcopter like this
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 19:04:11 
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 19:04:13 but
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 19:04:16 and
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 19:04:23 it can fly forward stably
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 19:04:30 and that's all, it can only fly forward
