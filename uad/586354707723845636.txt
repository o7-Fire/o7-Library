Bug: I attached motors to my cockipit as a way to get in and out like a real jet but it sometimes shifts to the left or right (But this isn't really urgent)
How to get this: N/A it happens randomly
The Save it effects: My 11th save] (This is the only time I use motors to bring down the cockipit on my jet)

creations-chat 2020-10-30 02:56:33 Because it looks a little to block. You should add the 1x2 delta wing since it’s probably the closest to the angle

creations-chat 2020-12-09 00:30:58 <@!714733688084234250> that idea is awesome. But I think it would be better to make the islands bigger for more flat land for ground vehicles and a dock
creations-chat 2020-12-09 00:33:49 Yeah then that’s a perfect map. It’ll probably look beautiful if they actually make it as it looks like a tropical type of map
creations-chat 2020-12-09 00:36:26 But thing is ground vehicles are gonna be confined to the main island maybe A. Make 2 bridges connecting main to small and small to lab or B. Make that small island bigger making it all one island
creations-chat 2020-12-09 00:39:37 Nuggetz I Like the idea but it feels like it’s missing size and scenery.
Edit: Nuggetz what are the ladders supposed to be
creations-chat 2020-12-09 00:43:52 Hmm. First of all Size needs to be bigger. And instead of connecting 2 island with a bridge, a volcano with a road at it’s side connecting both
creations-chat 2020-12-09 00:47:11 Let’s say you had more space on that plot It would be cool to move it to the right bottom corner a little farther away with an airport
creations-chat 2020-12-09 00:49:22 Okay but these are just suggestions lol
