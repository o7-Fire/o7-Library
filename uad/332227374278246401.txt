help 2020-06-28 20:53:29 Can someone help me? When i load in my plane it's kinda bugged, the rockets don't do anything and the landing gear doesn't work. The plane is floating in the air, and even the control surfaces don't work

plane-crazy 2020-06-28 20:58:15 so umm
creations-chat 2020-06-28 21:01:57 It may look like something bad, but this is legit my most advanced plane
creations-chat 2020-06-28 21:02:45 What kind of variant?
creations-chat 2020-06-28 21:03:38 Custom plane made by me, however i try to follow modern jet design
creations-chat 2020-06-28 21:05:06 There is another plane, however its less advanced
creations-chat 2020-06-28 21:05:13 I like that bomber
creations-chat 2020-06-28 21:05:23 Looks pretty nice
creations-chat 2020-06-28 21:06:56 What could i improve on btw?
creations-chat 2020-06-28 21:08:01 This is the back of the plane, which i am really embarrased about
creations-chat 2020-06-28 21:08:20 The side
creations-chat 2020-06-28 21:08:54 Yeahhhhhhh, well i have another wing design you might like
creations-chat 2020-06-28 21:09:11 <@!628393318874873886> I dont know how to make engines, i use rockets
creations-chat 2020-06-28 21:10:02 <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 21:16:53 Can someone tell me how to make unique weapons? Like i saw people using huge rockets with explosive blocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 21:18:03 Good luck trying to find the correct color code for it
help 2020-06-28 21:20:38 How do you make the rudders angle sideways?
bot-central 2020-06-29 08:41:46 &suggest Symmetrical mode

This would be an option to place a symmetrical line at the center of the plot, allowing planes to be built easier
bot-central 2020-06-29 08:41:59 Definitely didn't do that right
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 08:42:55 I might try making a propeller plane because it's slower than rocket powered planes, so it might be better in pvp

plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:56:31 If blacklisting gets removed, servers will be chaos
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:56:53 I'm gonna get bashed on by all other vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 21:57:19 Does anyone know of an engine that is way better than spamming rockets?
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 21:57:37 I'm new and i would need one for a project
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 21:58:52 Thanks for the tips, I will make sure to learn them for my next project
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:18:32 Can a Magnetic Engine be placed anywhere inside of a plane, or any other object? Or do you have to place them to a specific location
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:18:53 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:19:18 Well i want a powerful engine because im building a huge machine and i dont think rocket spamming is gonna work at this point.
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:20:10 I'm not into advanced stuff, all i ever used yet was rocket spamming inside object hulls.
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:20:55 I'll look into how to build a conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:21:15 Also can you have more engines or will that mess up the plane?
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:21:45 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:24:26 What if the aircraft i'm building might be the size of my building plot?
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:25:37 There's <#478584971670454284> but this is a discussion channel so umm
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:26:04 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:27:13 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:27:40 It might be smaller
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:27:46 (I'm just starting it)
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:27:56 And i asked for an engine to use
plane-crazy 2020-07-12 22:29:09 Hmm

the-dump 2020-07-12 22:32:20 🗿
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 17:56:45 Can someone tell me what engine this is? (the block behind the left spring is a piston too
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 17:56:49 I was just messing around
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 17:58:07 It actually works, however trips
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 17:58:25 I'll go into The Hangar
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 17:59:33 No, it would be inefficient to use in a vehicle, you would have to keep pressing W
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 18:00:39 It will work i think
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 18:00:41 Actually
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 18:00:43 it might even be better
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 18:00:57 Doesn't work with a spring
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 18:01:28 Without piston but i put back the springs?
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 18:01:38 i'll test that
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 19:56:38 Whats the smallest engine btw?
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 12:03:30 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 19:12:24 Whats the possibility of a block names Triangle Wedge 2x1, 2x2, 2x3, 2x4?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 19:12:28 Named*
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 19:13:40 Wait, what if there was an option to customize wedge width and length?
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 19:13:41 Would be cool
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 19:28:19 Does it use hover to float?
creations-chat 2020-07-20 22:55:14 I just posted my first creation
creations-chat 2020-07-20 22:56:48 Tell me what I could improve upon
creations-chat 2020-07-20 22:58:39 > Too basic
My most advanced looking creation ever ;-;
creations-chat 2020-07-20 23:00:05 I'll make it better when I do some other stuff on it
creations-chat 2020-07-20 23:01:26 I'll try to improve
creations-chat 2020-07-20 23:03:32 Kinda true
creations-chat 2020-07-20 23:11:15 The tail rudder's shape is a bit off but it looks nice
creations-chat 2020-07-20 23:12:05 You don't need to if you want that's just my opinion
creations-chat 2020-07-20 23:51:17 I made a new wing design and tried to make a camouflage but tbh im a bit embarrased
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 23:57:16 Not the best thing but my best creation ever
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 23:58:07 Looks like an F-16 in that angle
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 23:58:15 But its a JAS 39
plane-crazy 2020-07-20 23:58:47 Okay ;-;
creations-chat 2020-07-21 00:00:58 I'll of course try new camos since it doesn't satisfy me
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:28:46 Is there any tutorial on youtube about wedge placement or something like that?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:33:37 PVP is mostly just people with anti air/ground contraptions that are heavily armored
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:35:15 I'm talking about those people
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:35:17 Too
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:35:50 Not that much difference
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:36:28 oh
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:38:16 Super rocket engine is the way to easily make your plane fly
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:38:43 I don't have that much space inside my plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:38:55 I tried one out, but most planes have to be really large
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:39:44 Could I fit a conveyor engine inside my JAS 39?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:41:03 What's motor lock?
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:41:19 I'm pretty new to the game
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:41:53 So what's motor lock?

plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:45:27 Im pretty new like I said
creations-chat 2020-07-21 00:53:21 This time I made the plane functional and added Camouflage
creations-chat 2020-07-21 00:53:58 Idk if I am allowed to repost it twice
creations-chat 2020-07-21 00:54:12 It's not the same, it's better
plane-crazy 2020-07-21 00:54:41 Camouflage
creations-chat 2020-07-21 01:03:22 It's hard to make out, but yes

help 2020-07-21 21:54:34 What's the problem behind it? How do i fix this?
help 2020-07-21 21:54:44 (Of course the plane is fully symmetrical)
help 2020-07-21 21:55:54 Center of mass is almost balanced with lift, however I don't think thats the issue
help 2020-07-21 21:57:00 
help 2020-07-21 21:57:00 No
help 2020-07-21 21:57:36 Maybe check the blocks in your vehicle
help 2020-07-21 21:57:47 You might have put another block that has different weight or something
help 2020-07-21 21:58:29 I used fuel tanks to mostly balance the lift and mass, but if i didn't do it symmetrically it would have shown itself
help 2020-07-21 22:00:50 Maybe check <#623337136267067393>
creations-chat 2020-07-21 22:20:31 Can someone tell me what that white thing is?

creations-chat 2020-07-21 22:49:01 So if I use 0.9x blocks it would work?
creations-chat 2020-07-21 22:49:27 If i were to put the motors near the center of the plane
creations-chat 2020-07-21 22:49:51 Cause the motors must not have any other blocks contacted with except a control surfac

creations-chat 2020-07-21 22:50:01 Okay
creations-chat 2020-07-21 22:50:28 I'll remove 2 motors in the back though as it's causing me problems
creations-chat 2020-07-21 22:51:16 No, it causes a problem with rolling
creations-chat 2020-07-21 22:51:45 I fixed it just now but I didn't save it before I went to another save briefly
creations-chat 2020-07-21 22:51:52 That was the problem
creations-chat 2020-07-21 22:51:58 I have motors on the front

creations-chat 2020-07-21 23:01:15 Yes, but I wanted faster rolls
creations-chat 2020-07-21 23:01:30 so I made this
creations-chat 2020-07-21 23:01:39 Works without a motor
creations-chat 2020-07-21 23:01:54 Can still make rolls if you adjust the options
creations-chat 2020-07-21 23:02:15 Well this is the only plane that uses keyboard controls

plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:19:46 So maybe gun rounds could ricochet of the vehicle you are in
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:28:53 What box things?
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:29:38 I'm guessing these missile spammers
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:29:44 And suicide bombers
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:30:37 these are douchebags
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 22:30:40 idk how to kill them

help 2020-07-23 22:50:07 <@!305721738015014913> Im thinking of a solution to stop cutter bugs while you are in a tank
help 2020-07-23 22:51:43 What if we put missiles on the sides of the tank that are near the ground? You would just fire them like your normal missiles, but at close range, they lock on to anything
help 2020-07-23 22:51:47 So it might just work
help 2020-07-23 22:52:50 Well I didn't run out of armaments yet on my tank, so I'll try it out

help 2020-08-15 16:32:43 Yes
help 2020-08-15 16:33:02 So should I move the motors up?
help 2020-08-15 16:34:16 So i should invert the suspension?
help 2020-08-15 16:35:56 I want to use the suspension on the sides, so the tank won't get tall
help 2020-08-15 16:39:14 So a block needs to be connected to it from the side then i'm guessing
general 2020-08-15 16:52:24 ahh yes
general 2020-08-15 16:52:27 dcs

creations-chat 2020-08-18 10:44:33 <@!681009940671889476> why did you censor the main gun? i can see that its made out of rockets
creations-chat 2020-08-18 10:45:23 ohhh
creations-chat 2020-08-18 10:45:25 i see
creations-chat 2020-08-18 10:45:33 oh
creations-chat 2020-08-18 10:45:38 well its a bit too long imo
creations-chat 2020-08-18 10:46:36 if its for pvp, then i reccomend an armored turret with motors scattered around it to put the rockets in
creations-chat 2020-08-18 10:47:51 i can just aim a rocket at your frontal turret, and your gun barrel wouldn't be on the tank anymore
creations-chat 2020-08-18 10:48:33 rockets should be scattered around the turret like this
creations-chat 2020-08-18 10:49:55 and make the gun barrel perhaps out of explosive blocks, keybinded to a key you woudln't press
The reason is that it can't be penetrated by shredders, and guns don't do anything to an explosive block
creations-chat 2020-08-18 10:51:25 Oh
