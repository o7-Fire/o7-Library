general 2020-03-23 16:00:28 I wish the winter event items for Plane Crazy would be available to the people who didn‚Äôt get them..
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 16:04:41 I wish the winter event items would be available to the people who didn‚Äôt get them..
general 2020-03-23 16:59:36 So, my entire state is now in lockdown mode cuz of COVID-19... we are only allowed to leave the house to go to the store for living essentials
general 2020-03-23 17:00:43 I just tried opening the ROBLOX app...
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:20:22 How am I supposed to make a helicopter? The motor turns both ways..
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:21:29 Like I have it going forward, but when I try to lift it spins the body of the heli faster than the rotor, and I have tried both orientations
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:22:04 Is everyone just ignoring me?
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:23:05 Can someone give me a link to a helicopter tutorial for the current version of Plane Crazy?
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:25:20 >:-:
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:25:43 ..
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:25:50 That‚Äôs not what I wanted..
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:26:06 I wanted a heli tutorial for plane crazy... the current version
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:26:33 I don‚Äôt know how to balance the motor
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:26:57 I‚Äôm about ready to ping a mod
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:27:26 You guys are just bullying.. not you turbo
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:27:53 No, because you‚Äôre giving me crap about it and making fun of me
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:28:08 I don‚Äôt know that that means
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:28:53 Is that meaning like the rotor is at an angle?
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:29:46 th
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:30:29 1) I thought all heli‚Äôs had to have a tail rotor, 2) how would THAT fit on a heli that looks right?
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:31:24 I‚Äôm just planning on something small to transport me around the map without difficulties, not something to bring the entire server I‚Äôm in on a journey
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:32:15 How am I supposed to find a heli tutorial that is from the current version of the game? All the ones are from the early versions
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:33:36 Rip
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:35:52 So, is anyone going to help me?
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:36:43 The problem I have is that I don‚Äôt know how to make a vehicle balanced..
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:37:21 Not just with the weight, but with lift.. motors...
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:39:59 I mean, the only way I know how to balance a craft is to make it symmetrical on all axis‚Äôs
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:45:14 Ok.. nobody is going to help me..
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:45:28 Whelp time to leave this discord server...
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:47:23 <@!238017332872478720> no I need help building a heli in general
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:47:45 
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:48:33 I know what the chinook is, just got told that a coaxial has a tail rotor, what‚Äôs the classic?
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:50:19 Coaxial is the one with two rotors stacked correct?
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:50:55 Wdym?
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:51:53 wOw
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:54:41 .
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 17:55:16 Me putting that **.** got me to level up
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:00:35 What about wishbone suspensions
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:02:18 uhm
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:02:39 So is anyone going to help me or am I going to have to do this
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:04:24 Whelp time to do this
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:05:30 <@!238017332872478720> were you going to help me?
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:05:57 I guess a classic?

plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:06:48 fine
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:07:04 Coaxial. But don‚Äôt want to have a swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:07:25 I DONT KNOW
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:07:44 I just want a heli
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:07:57 Something to bring me around the map...
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:08:30 Annnnndddd
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:08:50 <@!596731922244435968> can you help me?

plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:12:00 heh
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:12:29 Same issue: balance (weight, lift, and thrust)
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:12:42 ..
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:12:56 And how many are from the current version of the game?
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:13:42 Different versions = different mechanics = different properties
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:14:10 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:14:19 I‚Äôll go find one
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:14:34 If it doesn‚Äôt work. I blame you <@!238017332872478720>
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:16:26 You want to know what the problem is
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:16:30 I‚Äôm on a phone
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:17:04 How am I supposed to go back and forth between ROBLOX and youtube without ROBLOX closing the game
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:17:25 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:17:36 But it is as old as I am <@314383347214319616>
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:18:14 I‚Äôll be 16 in May
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:19:48 Ima ask my mom if I can get on ‚Äúmy‚Äù computer..
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:20:07 I need help building a heli
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:20:19 A small one to get around the map
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:20:33 ..
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:20:37 I don‚Äôt want to
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:20:56 I was a mono propeller
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:21:17 Vtol‚Äôs are mostly with 2 or 4 props
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:21:37 Because nobody else would <@!596731922244435968>
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:22:29 Now to try and get this sleeping cat off of me..

plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:27:00 <@314383347214319616> can you make a smol video for a piece by piece?
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:27:13 ..
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:27:32 Balance!
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:27:40 I have issues with balance!
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:28:06 How am I supposed to figure out what is the right place?
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:28:17 Exactly,  it‚Äôs different for every build
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:28:44 Hang on
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:30:38 OF ||freaking|| course when I take a screen recording to show what my issue is it‚Äôs too big...

plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:33:32 <div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:176.471%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/vn30g/ueqxha" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:33:46 I hit copy url..
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:34:37 Do you see my dilemma
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:34:54 I know watch the video
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:35:07 So answer my question
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:36:29 I know, I hadn‚Äôt gotten to that
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:37:26 The only ‚Äúcreative‚Äù constructs that I can make is with LEGO. And that was when I was younger
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:38:16 Except it doesn‚Äôt even get into the air then, when it‚Äôs lighter, how is it going to when it‚Äôs done, when it‚Äôs heavier
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:39:40 The last time I tried making a helicopter in plane crazy, I just tried making most of it out of helium because I didn‚Äôt know a lighter block
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:40:55 That just went straight up at an orbital speed
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:41:17 Well duh
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:41:21 Wat
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:41:34 *sigh*
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:41:39 Whelp
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:41:40 Bye
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:56:48 wanted to ask a question real quick
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:57:18 hang on
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:57:53 if the speed of the rotor is what spins my heli faster, cant i just lower the torque
plane-crazy 2020-03-23 18:58:07 or does the torque need to be up as well
general 2020-05-07 18:02:24 What is that website thing where I can link a video if it‚Äôs over the 8 MB limit for discord?
general 2020-05-07 18:02:39 K thx
general 2020-05-07 18:07:27 Am I able to post a link in here?
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 14:26:46 How do I make a suggestion ticket?
bot-central 2020-06-14 14:27:06 ?shelp
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 14:28:34 can someone make a suggestion ticket for me since im terrible at making vehicles?
plane-crazy 2020-06-14 14:30:00 I wanted to suggest a setting for the pistons that allow them to be extended when you start the vehicle automatically, for like landing gear extenders, since if you tried that the gear would be out automatically, but the piston wouldn't.
