creations-chat 2020-11-29 16:24:39 eh the gaps occured because the bomber was going to ascend but i'll try my best to fix the issue to make it less visible

creations-chat 2020-11-29 19:06:27 maybe add more propeller rotors and paint a camo, make sure its not vibrant the exception is markings but make sure theyre not that bright
creations-chat 2020-11-29 21:41:20 what camo terrain do you want?
creations-chat 2020-12-01 20:22:20 eh we care more about the results not the effort and time

creations-chat 2021-01-22 20:00:19 looks good altough i would personally make the white a bit darker other then that it looks pretty solid imo

creations-chat 2021-02-04 18:38:58 the track could have more detail to it, and the hull and track has a small gap between. make the turret larger. remove that small half wedge on the front hull.

The grey dome thingy? stick out like a sore thumb, try to flatten them. The wheels are small, try to make custom wheels instead of using cylinders. the ball on the gear shift is large (scale wise) so try and make it smaller.
creations-chat 2021-02-20 11:44:54 looks good and dont forget to add the 72000 attendants
