plane-crazy 2019-07-04 10:33:33 That second one is amazing.
creations-chat 2019-07-04 10:34:23 Forgot to mention it has working lights, hazards and turn signals.

creations-chat 2019-07-04 10:40:14 Dang it, I noticed some things aren't colored in.
creations-chat 2019-07-04 10:40:30 I forgot that happened when my save file was slightly corrupted, where some parts were uncolored..
creations-chat 2019-07-04 10:42:34 Well, fixed it.
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 06:23:40 I don't think this is a good thing to do here, talking about emails and passwords.
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 06:24:00 Calm down.
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 06:24:04 Jesus.
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 06:24:55 And now it's becoming a harmful joke.
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 06:42:04 I don't think this is fine
plane-crazy 2019-07-05 11:09:22 HMM.

plane-crazy 2019-07-06 20:25:20 Ok.

plane-crazy 2019-07-06 20:39:09 ***Do barrels really matter when it comes to what is a support tank***
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 20:39:24 The inner diameter yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 20:39:29 But lenght?
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 20:39:48 well yeah but
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 20:40:07 Wait, maybe I'm thinking of this too strict
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 20:41:15 weLl
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 20:41:52 ***there's a tank destroyer, tank body, giant cannon and basically sheet metal turret with no top***
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 20:41:55 is it a tANK?
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 20:42:04 or a thing
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 20:43:57 I was making a joke towards enqrises, since he said a tank is a tank. The joke was basically; "WELL, DOES THIS COUNT?"
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 20:44:21 Still nice to know a few things I suppose.

creations-chat 2019-07-06 20:46:25 It may be simple but what's the problem with that?

plane-crazy 2019-07-06 20:51:02 m
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 20:51:09 I knew something was off.
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 20:51:25 Definitely didn't look finished.
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:06:33 Alright, now we wait till someone makes a strandbeest.
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:07:13 I mean..
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:07:24 That definitely ain't no LMG.
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:09:00 A LONG barrel.
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:09:26 If it's a long barreled portable gun,
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:09:31 ***It a rifle.***
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:09:42 ..A rifle?
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:10:11 Both are rifles, there's no real reason not to consider one or the other a rifle.
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:10:24 It may be less weildy, yes, but it's still portable I suppose.
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:10:36 Can be stationary though..
creations-chat 2019-07-06 21:11:25 Great looking boat on a great night.
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:12:39 To me there's no real reason not to call that a rifle.
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:13:05 Considering it's hand held even if requires some support.
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:13:37 ***Assault rifle for tanks, aye?***
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:13:52 Or I'd assume it is.
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:14:12 oh my
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:14:42 Well this one definitely looks different.

plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:17:28 AAAT gun
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:17:33 or ATAA gun
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:17:40 new words, mates
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:18:03 ***but how is it anti if it can't damage the thing properly***
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:18:10 Well, unless it's a rifle.
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:18:30 a rifle is a gun
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:18:36 cannon is a bigger gun
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:18:42 that can't be held
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:19:09 guns, guns, gUNS.
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:19:13 I gotta go.
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 21:19:20 bYe.
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:25:14 ***I don't like where this is going.***
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:25:32 I already dislike when people put crap in maid outfits, but a fURrY?
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:25:43 I don't like it either
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:25:55 wait
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:26:01 What's so scary about that.
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:26:16 Yes but I asked whY.
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:26:53 ***that pose straight up annoys me***
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:27:06 ***no idea how to explain***
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:27:59 However that actually inspired me.
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:28:16 The question is HOW am I gonna make something that walks.
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:28:47 I've been abscent from the game, I'm pretty sure new mechanics were implemented but I don't know what they are.

plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:30:14 Jokes aside I ain't got issues with furries.
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:30:26 ***Well, unless we speak of THOSE specific ones.***
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:30:30 Same.
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:31:24 Yeah, that's a problem.
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:31:30 Just give her shorts or something.
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:31:56 Wrongly isn't a word-
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:32:05 bruh moment
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:32:23 Also, it's technically not misspelt but it also is.
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:32:34 In another country, capitan is how you type captain.
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:32:57 I on the other hand was a kiddo who thought english is too similar to my native language,
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:33:04 And since Kapitan is captain in my language,
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:33:18 ***I thought it's just the same but with a C.***
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:33:26 I just said give 'er shorts
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:33:45 Black
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:33:54 white wouldn't work,
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:34:00 Since she has white fur
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:34:30 I mean.
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:34:42 ***Whoever this character is, you can customize 'em.***
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:35:00 And if she doesn't wear anything under then that's just intentional fanservice crap.
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:35:34 None of us do
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:35:41 NEIN
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:35:54 HALT IT
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:36:01 PAY YOUR FINE TO THE COURT
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:36:04 OR PAY WITH YOUR BLOOD
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:36:38 Like what?
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:36:55 Maybe talking it off will help.
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:37:44 He did but also half the bad furries were erased
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:37:46 soooo
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:37:49 hard to explain
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:38:35 I should learn to make bipedals the new way, shouldn't I.
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:38:56 Like that one Ronin mech a guy made.
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 08:39:07 Which I loved.

plane-crazy 2019-07-07 14:57:56 That's what I wanted to do, but the issue is last time there was not enough friction.
plane-crazy 2019-07-07 14:58:12 Did that.

plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:07:43 lo
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:09:25 I like vision because its a rather original concept
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:09:30 yes really
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:09:46 I think so
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:10:22 Back of next 100 is good, sides are alright, front I like because it's so weird and different
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:10:58 meanwhile people think ricardo is the meme to go with dancin'
plane-crazy 2019-07-18 19:11:02 NOW THAT is 0iq

me: ****when***
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 12:01:16 Hey, does anybody know a compact but decent tank track design?

I never made tank tracks before, but considering what I have on mind to build I may have to now.
creations-chat 2021-08-14 12:56:47 Started working on a mech, I just want to post the face so far so you can judge if it's accurate enough or not to what I base it off of (F71 G-Cannon from Mobile Suit Gundam F91)
creations-chat 2021-08-14 12:59:44 
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:08:42 Just saying, if you actually want to thin out the nose; use longer wedges! It tends to make a big difference.
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:11:01 Personally, I hate using glitch methods to build. So I simply don't use them, making whatever I accomplish slightly cooler to me as I had to figure out how to fit everything in.
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:17:27 Yes. They were already patched once, yet people figured out how to keep using it; meaning it was an unintended feature that also technically "ruined" the simplicity of builds. It's not a bad thing that people use it, or want a more impressive looking build however I don't like using methods that are otherwise unintended.
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:21:22 I see. That's cool, actually! Though, I personally still prefer my builds to be more "solid".
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:23:35 Thank you very much, in that case! I want to become a mecha-builder, and motor lock seems to be necessary if I want to get smaller, but detailed in the future. I'll figure it out eventually, but for big builds I will continue being simple with.
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:25:59 nO
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:30:58 **I have never heard of a tractor called that way**
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:37:57 Me when no 0.5x2 triangle wedges
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:43:59 WHOA, BIG PLEEN
creations-chat 2021-08-14 13:46:35 yknow i always tell myself my 3-dimensional imagination is good, but no way in hell would i have thought of that
creations-chat 2021-08-14 14:39:43 Its almost cursed how clean that is
general 2021-08-14 15:25:46 sir thats a koenigsegg
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:08:40 Sure
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:09:22 BIG
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:11:41 B i g
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:13:42 What is this one tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:14:15 WHOA
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:14:27 I like that one.
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:18:20 I went from building cars to mecha
general 2021-08-14 16:18:52 NEAT
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:23:53 I still cant build a genuine flying plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:23:55 haaaa
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:25:52 I made only one that flew but it was like
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:25:56 SUPER touchy on controls
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:26:05 Probably because it was miniscule, too
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:27:16 Imagine plane at all smh
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 16:27:39 a
creations-chat 2021-08-14 16:30:39 nothing wrong with a tutorial if it teaches how things work
creations-chat 2021-08-14 16:42:01 What
creations-chat 2021-08-14 16:45:39 I mean yeah? I never mentioned posting them being fine, though?
general 2021-08-14 16:59:15 I believe its about the adult thing?
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:00:56 Speaking of missiles, man I wish micro-missiles existed
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:01:49 Fireworks are good replacements only in a non functional way, what about ones that actually function?
general 2021-08-14 17:02:16 What the bricks for
general 2021-08-14 17:02:38 Rad.
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:19:49 Magnet drives maybe?
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:22:22 Ballasts in feet to keep them on the ground, additionally friction blocks and thrusters to improve grip. Helium at the very top to keep it stably up, think of it like a baloon tied on rope tied to a brick.
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:23:15 Motor power whatever you need it to be for the walking cycle, just keep the motors fairly low on resistance
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:24:06 Yeah so, one leg goes up and bends, the other goes back and extends. Let them fall down to the ground before doing the next step.
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:24:32 Suspension helps making walking smoother, thrusters can be used to assist the walking motion and stability
creations-chat 2021-08-14 17:25:00 .. Yes, I'm pretty sure I explained I know that.
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:25:35 Usually just one or two at the hips and knees, then an arrangement at the ankle to let it go forward, back and side to side.
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:25:55 Two at hips and knees allow for extra keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:26:02 Ankle? Uhh.
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:26:06 Universal joint.
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:26:25 No no, unpowered motors actually.
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:26:38 But arranged as an universal joint
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:28:12 I would but I'm not on pc so I can't help with real pictures
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:28:34 Mmyes
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:28:40 Ballast friction blocks to be precise
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:28:45 AKA fabric ballasts
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:28:55 To minimize amount of space you need in a foot
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:29:26 Heavy block
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:29:37 Density decides how heavy it is
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:30:01 Depends on your mech, it must be tuned
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:30:09 according to what feels right to you
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:30:19 try getting the walk motion right for now
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:30:33 mmm
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:31:00 ok so you did the ankle, what's next for you?
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:31:25 Chaft?
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:31:36 Oh like
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:31:40 The leg frame maybe??
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:31:56 Alr so just build your leg as you want from here, until you get to the knee
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:32:04 I couldnt even tell
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:32:07 dont worry man
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:32:11 its fineeee
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:32:32 just one thing:
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:32:42 Make sure your leg leaves room for the ankle to move around a bit
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:32:55 Good
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:33:22 Remember, ankles are unpowered but knees and hip motors have low torque
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:33:40 Dont make it too low or they will fall too fast while trying to walk
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:34:08 No, just so they can rotate back and forward
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:34:18 but limit the angle
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:34:29 by building a physical blockade
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:34:48 alr so yeah on the same leg piece
creations-chat 2021-08-14 17:35:15 Sure.
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:35:38 Do the same thing as the knees, just without anything to restrict movement
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:35:50 when going forward or back
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:36:23 It again depends on how your mech is built
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:36:38 For now finish assembly, mess with settings when trying to get it to walk
general 2021-08-14 17:36:59 H o w
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:37:59 If you want a leg to go forward, keybind it so the hip raises it and the knee to bend
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:38:10 When going back, do the opposite keybind for it
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:38:25 If one leg raises on for example the letter Q, the other will extend back
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:38:29 Settings on motors
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:39:14 speed adjust to your liking, torque adjust to how heavy the mech is
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:39:18 on the legs
general 2021-08-14 17:39:44 ill have you know he ignored it for his chip was removed
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:40:13 No
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:40:20 You must have assembled something wrong
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:40:36 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:40:42 Yeah that can happen in walking
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:40:57 You usually dont have to worry because the other leg will bend you back forward
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:41:06 you can countersteer thou
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:41:07 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:45:22 Most people will have you motorlock the angles, but id say: simply get as close as possible
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:45:26 It doesnt have to be clean
creations-chat 2021-08-14 17:46:36 That happens here all the time, for all kinds of reasons
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:46:50 what did you try to counter it
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:47:40 You cant eliminate all wobble but remember: it will go forward the moment the other leg moves
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:47:51 so it will go straight
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:48:14 You might be looking for springs, not suspension
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:49:50 That will require a manual mechanism
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:49:54 Use motor levers
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:50:12 Ever seen how train wheels work?
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:50:18 Replicate that for the recoil motion
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:50:22 to function
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:51:07 Yes but thats to dampen the recoil and bring the slide back forward
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:51:22 Or help with it rather
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:54:19 Unless your spring was indeed used to bring the slide back forward, then you need to adjust its stiffness and max lenght
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:56:59 A tank gun can have recoil by having either the whole barrel move back upon firing or just by simulating the shake via something heavy quickly yoinking it back
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:57:56 ig that works
creations-chat 2021-08-14 17:58:14 I like both actually
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:59:22 Starting to think I should try making a gun too..
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:59:29 Well, artillery
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 18:00:11 What's your suspension stiffness
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 18:00:25 That's why
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 18:00:28 Make it stiffer
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 18:00:35 0 stiffness means it will never go back
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 18:00:50 hm
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 18:00:59 Increase it
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 18:01:15 To whatever will make it work
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 18:01:18 Try experimenting
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 18:01:37 I dont know what the details of your creation are, so you need to figure the settings out yourself
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 18:01:40 thats a good idea
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 18:04:39 Hmm
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 18:05:39 Upload it to streamable
plane-crazy 2021-08-14 18:05:57 strmble
general 2021-08-14 18:37:17 Everyone doesn't work
general 2021-08-14 18:44:46 People who can't afford to play for a month straight to get two tanks they like the most
general 2021-08-14 18:47:39 yeh but what if you wanna play with em
creations-chat 2021-08-14 19:39:20 man i like the idea of supersized normal things
creations-chat 2021-08-14 19:50:56 If I knew how to make a regular engine, maybe I'd attempt that
general 2021-08-15 06:18:40 I still dont use motorlock lol
general 2021-08-15 06:49:22 Did they add blocks???
general 2021-08-15 06:50:13 h
general 2021-08-15 06:50:35 i could use more wedges in life tho
general 2021-08-15 06:50:53 like, half triangle wedgeblocks especially
general 2021-08-15 06:51:15 0.5x2 triangle wedges
general 2021-08-15 06:51:42 Same
general 2021-08-15 06:54:32 man this server is wack
general 2021-08-15 06:55:03 troll emote moment
general 2021-08-15 06:56:22 man if i make my build and someone tells me to motorlock something im gonna uhhhhhhh t
he uhhhh ummmm
general 2021-08-15 06:57:07 yes but im not a fan of it tbh
general 2021-08-15 06:57:22 I prefer my builds more solid than gimmicky
general 2021-08-15 06:57:31 with the locking stuff
general 2021-08-15 06:57:40 i do like gimmicks, just not that kind
general 2021-08-15 06:57:55 no
general 2021-08-15 06:58:25 its a tool for super detailed builds or for room clearance, however it doesn't define a good build
general 2021-08-15 06:58:47 it should not affect someones view of said build
general 2021-08-15 06:59:27 im sorry but then youre playing the game wrong
general 2021-08-15 06:59:32 its really not that hard
general 2021-08-15 06:59:44 ok
general 2021-08-15 06:59:58 no thats not what i meant
general 2021-08-15 07:00:25 motorlocking is fine, saying motorlock is required for a build to be decent aint
general 2021-08-15 07:00:42 it aint
general 2021-08-15 07:01:04 before motorlock was discovered, people made amazing things even then
general 2021-08-15 07:01:16 Its current existence doesnt negate the old possibilities
general 2021-08-15 07:02:46 In a sense i wanna say the mindset that motorlock is required means people got lazy with planning out their mechanical layouts, however its not entirely true
general 2021-08-15 07:03:47 sometimes simplicity beats super detail, imo
general 2021-08-15 07:04:05 as it means people built with limits they overcame
general 2021-08-15 07:04:19 motorlocking overcomes limits too, but in a different way
general 2021-08-15 07:04:51 I dont hate motorlock, but i dont like that some people think their builds have to look like out of astrocraft
general 2021-08-15 07:05:43 well anyways
general 2021-08-15 07:06:03 man i sure cant wait to work more on my non motorlock giant mech <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
general 2021-08-15 07:07:05 hnngh i kinda wanna figure out a cleaner walking motion tho
general 2021-08-15 07:07:17 pain
general 2021-08-15 07:07:26 happens
creations-chat 2021-08-15 07:08:48 oddly enough the most impressive mech i ever saw was that of a furry
creations-chat 2021-08-15 07:10:49 it had a lot of pre-set poses so you didnt have to do it all yourself one motor at a time, yet it still walked and was pretty dang small  while at it
general 2021-08-15 07:12:59 <:RoundMotor:706287054023294997>
general 2021-08-15 07:13:14 i need to know how this became a thing
general 2021-08-15 07:13:28 did someone lock a cylinder into a motor
general 2021-08-15 07:13:55 huh
general 2021-08-15 07:14:39 probably, though if you look closely you can still see the square motor part on top of the cylinder
general 2021-08-15 07:14:51 so i thought maybe someone did a funni once
general 2021-08-15 07:15:04 in the actual game
general 2021-08-15 07:16:01 side note: i find it funny people call eachother out on anime pfps whenever im around because i literally have one and nobody bats an eye
general 2021-08-15 07:16:13 thank you
general 2021-08-15 07:16:22 thank you
general 2021-08-15 07:16:55 well shiiiii
general 2021-08-15 07:17:52 happens
general 2021-08-15 07:18:10 a well designed weapon can go a long way when fighting things
general 2021-08-15 07:18:49 hmm speaking of weapons
general 2021-08-15 07:19:08 almost wanna make an explosive ball launcher with swapping mags

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 07:46:04 I tend to admire smaller builds
general 2021-08-15 07:46:33 seriously though, literally every community ive been to did that
general 2021-08-15 07:46:44 theres like 2 i can think of that be chill

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 07:48:04 my mechs just fly cause of helium
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 07:48:17 i wish i could make a heli though
creations-chat 2021-08-15 07:50:20 tbh, a good functional mechanism wins over speed imo
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 07:50:37 its brilliant
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 07:50:49 i cherish this unfinished one
general 2021-08-15 07:51:02 oooo
general 2021-08-15 07:51:07 i like that
general 2021-08-15 07:51:30 its probably sideways up front
general 2021-08-15 07:52:03 Old automobiles used to flip the engine sideways when trying to make room for people inside, or to make something smaller
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 07:52:23 It definitely would look good
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 07:52:29 dont give up fam
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 07:52:51 the silhouette already looks great
general 2021-08-15 07:53:10 Yeah exactly!
creations-chat 2021-08-15 07:53:56 and yet its not really the case, as it only takes a few seconds in itself
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 07:55:02 hehehe

general 2021-08-15 08:00:31 i wish i could do that
general 2021-08-15 08:00:45 cutter shotguns

general 2021-08-15 08:01:21 that's also good
general 2021-08-15 08:01:33 but cutters look like shrapnel so i wanna try that
general 2021-08-15 08:01:44 might even make it explosion powered
general 2021-08-15 08:01:49 to begin with
general 2021-08-15 08:01:55 like a real gun
general 2021-08-15 08:02:19 its easy
general 2021-08-15 08:02:38 think of it as a brick, tied to a rope that also ties a baloon
general 2021-08-15 08:02:48 thats basically mech physics
general 2021-08-15 08:05:04 hi
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:06:19 if i knew the laws of aviation i would
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:06:24 but again, i cant make crap fly
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:06:32 even if i have a decent grasp on aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:07:04 a
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:07:12 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:07:23 yeah then just fold it up 90 degrees maybe
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:07:29 via motor
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:08:15 you cant get rid of the motor unless you use signs to attach motors  to the wings via invisible signs
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:08:24 theres no other way to fold wings man
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 08:09:05 a

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 09:17:37 damn if only parachutes didnt lag so hard when motorlocking, itd be a perfect way for me to make launchable dummy meteors for a mech
creations-chat 2021-08-15 09:39:32 it is astrocraft

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 09:50:08 One of those being a giant cannon
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 09:57:13 The "Anywhere anytime" nuke
general 2021-08-15 10:49:05 and yet unfortunately the button does work
general 2021-08-15 10:49:17 you just gotta be reported by more than one person
general 2021-08-15 10:49:32 at least to my knowledge
general 2021-08-15 10:51:09 yeah i wouldnt be too sure about that either
general 2021-08-15 10:51:22 ive seen people get warns recently
general 2021-08-15 10:51:41 which of course leads to ban if too many are caught

general 2021-08-15 10:59:47 yeah pretty much
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 11:03:17 i think hes either making a joke or doesnt know the fact that a race car driver is not called a racist
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 11:03:32 judging from the conversation topic

general 2021-08-15 11:11:05 the best kind of race planes are the old ones imo

general 2021-08-15 11:14:09 theres
general 2021-08-15 11:14:19 Decent design differences between the two
general 2021-08-15 11:14:29 Just fyi
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 11:15:43 im not sure what their pfp is but that feels excessive?
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 11:16:30 Not familiar with planes but lookin fly so far
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 11:19:20 alpha please read what i said more closely
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 11:19:38 it happens
creations-chat 2021-08-15 11:20:47 depends on the use, maybe that one specifically is meant for destruction in vips?
no need for the aggression
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 11:22:25 i feel you
general 2021-08-15 11:23:07 ** **

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 11:26:17 pain
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 11:26:53 Taste
general 2021-08-15 11:27:58 b-but muh gundam
general 2021-08-15 11:28:31 to give the impression of stuttering
general 2021-08-15 11:28:34 obviously
general 2021-08-15 11:28:47 but i did
general 2021-08-15 11:29:09 its not about "do i have to", its about "do i want to"
general 2021-08-15 11:29:32 besides it worked for the sarcastic comment i made
general 2021-08-15 11:29:56 sheesh??
general 2021-08-15 11:30:26 i will never understand people who take offense to text messages trying to portray something in a way that doesnt use emotes or somethin
general 2021-08-15 11:30:56 its a few pixel long line on a screen
general 2021-08-15 11:30:59 thats all im sayin
general 2021-08-15 11:31:22 i shall continue being stupid then
general 2021-08-15 11:31:26 for i like it
general 2021-08-15 11:31:48 have you never stuttered before to anything
general 2021-08-15 11:31:54 lucky i guess?
general 2021-08-15 11:32:30 i find myself at a lack of words
general 2021-08-15 11:33:01 not reaaaaaally
general 2021-08-15 11:33:12 if its good it may be accepted
general 2021-08-15 11:33:18 but its amogus so
general 2021-08-15 11:33:26 people will be biased even then
general 2021-08-15 11:33:54 you can do it but expect people to be a bit brutal about it
general 2021-08-15 11:34:18 you can't
general 2021-08-15 11:34:35 a creation at the end of the day is a creation, based on a meme or not
general 2021-08-15 11:34:42 it will still count
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 11:34:53 oooh
general 2021-08-15 11:35:08 subjectively
general 2021-08-15 11:35:27 unless its an actual shitpost like a super low effort meme then yeah
general 2021-08-15 11:35:40 but if its genuinely well built its most likely not
general 2021-08-15 11:35:53 looks fine to me
general 2021-08-15 11:36:59 h
general 2021-08-15 11:37:50 it is

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 11:41:24 Peace
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 12:44:12 I wonder, are there any advantages to custom suspensions over the stock spring type?
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 12:44:29 I mean, I guess swag works
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 12:45:14 but yeah unless its made specifically to show it i cant see myself ever building a custom suspension
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 12:45:19 for any of my builds
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 12:45:34 its just lag at that point
general 2021-08-15 12:46:59 Wouldn't it be cool if something could grab the blade and use it tho

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 12:56:01 it looks better this way than any other
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 12:56:04 since its more subtle
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 12:57:12 hmmmn
creations-chat 2021-08-15 12:58:02 i suppose that's a good point
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:02:12 man whats up with people trynna post things like that here
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:02:17 its a roblox game server
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:04:00 you think this is bad?
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:04:20 i mean it can be hell sometimes here but..

the-dump 2021-08-15 13:04:30 this aint nothing compared to other discords
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:04:51 except those that do

which is a bit much
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:05:03 some even got nsfw servers, sadly
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:05:09 things are weird
the-dump 2021-08-15 13:06:29 
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 13:09:02 when the shredder becomes prey

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 13:18:58 the first thing is to get reference material
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 13:19:05 to know what you want to do
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 13:20:23 ok, good
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 13:20:33 now you try to recreate that using every block at your disposal
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 13:20:58 i mean im sorry but theres nothing we can teach about this
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 13:21:48 at best we can suggest trailer hitch designs so you can make one of those
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 13:21:56 but the truck itself you need to build yourself
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 13:24:02 best of luck
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 13:24:25 i can say one thing though
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 13:24:33 for trucks try a bigger scale
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 13:24:40 its gonna be a good thing
general 2021-08-15 13:25:19 bro
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 13:25:42 very compact and i like that
general 2021-08-15 13:27:17 well thats gonna do a number on your pc components
general 2021-08-15 13:27:23 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 13:30:59 man
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 13:31:16 i have no idea why but whenever someone tells another to <:IntendedFeature:706289545548660746> something in, i cringe
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 13:31:37 even when its a build already utilizing it
general 2021-08-15 13:32:39 ** **
general 2021-08-15 13:32:51 cursed toyota
general 2021-08-15 13:33:01 nissan
general 2021-08-15 13:33:06 why do i mess them up
general 2021-08-15 13:33:14 and i claim to be a car guy
general 2021-08-15 13:33:21 AAAAA
general 2021-08-15 13:33:59 I EVEN OWNED THE DAM THING IN A GAME
creations-chat 2021-08-15 13:35:49 ngl i enjoyed the purple, it looked interesting

but yeah the gray is much more serious and cool lookin'
general 2021-08-15 13:36:18 because it was superheated
general 2021-08-15 13:36:46 its not something us mortals should question
general 2021-08-15 13:42:08 the good thing about flip up lights is exactly that
creations-chat 2021-08-15 13:45:06 I have no idea how I'll ever reach that number, especially considering the fact i like to keep block counts as low as possible for optimization cough
creations-chat 2021-08-15 14:50:57 yyyeah, I believe you should maybe just make the round roof out of *wedges*, as it's needlessly complicated for something that looks fairly simple everywhere else
creations-chat 2021-08-15 15:07:13 Hmm, saw this explosive ball launcher once that used a gear to pull back the springs.. I'll attempt something like that.
general 2021-08-15 17:37:05 These foods are way too much to make me hungry
general 2021-08-15 17:37:12 they almost look gross in fact
general 2021-08-15 17:37:27 greasy as hell
general 2021-08-15 17:38:18 snails are cool
general 2021-08-15 17:38:41 you uhh
general 2021-08-15 17:38:54 sure you shouldnt go to the dump if you gonna
general 2021-08-15 17:38:57 post this much
general 2021-08-15 17:39:05 hhhhnnn
general 2021-08-15 17:46:15 hey he just asked if they are, not when
general 2021-08-15 17:46:21 big difference

"For all those people that find it more convinient to bother you with their question than to google it for themselves."
general 2021-08-15 17:48:52 so basically, funi quirky website
general 2021-08-15 17:50:24 you uh
general 2021-08-15 17:50:28 can look for it
general 2021-08-15 17:50:36 in the search bar
general 2021-08-15 17:51:05 <:stank:657279416946393099>
general 2021-08-15 17:52:22 I just want deeper oceans and a moon or mars surface
general 2021-08-15 17:52:27 i ask for nothing more
general 2021-08-15 17:52:48 dunno
general 2021-08-15 17:53:48 i just wanna live out my fantasy of space mechs
general 2021-08-15 17:53:53 😔
general 2021-08-15 17:57:44 probably, id imagine things would screw up real bad if they werent
general 2021-08-15 17:58:13 besides, any bigger and player count per server would have to lower to counteract the lag
general 2021-08-15 17:58:27 not that i would mind it too much, id actually like smaller servers
general 2021-08-15 17:59:34 Player per server count halved but you get bigger size plots
general 2021-08-15 17:59:46 would you take it
general 2021-08-15 18:00:42 actually, an optional mode like pvp servers but for bigger creations sounds fun
general 2021-08-15 18:00:54 but i think thats still going overboard
general 2021-08-15 18:01:01 things are ok as they are now
general 2021-08-15 18:01:18 just again, wish servers were a little smaller
general 2021-08-15 18:03:37 underwater (custom) sub first person simulator with claw arms to pick stuff up
general 2021-08-15 18:03:49 because yeah
general 2021-08-15 18:04:32 fair
general 2021-08-15 18:05:21 then uhhh
general 2021-08-15 18:05:54 u h h h hh
general 2021-08-15 18:07:18 make a board game.
general 2021-08-15 18:07:24 like, chess or something
general 2021-08-15 18:07:31 tic tac toe even
general 2021-08-15 18:08:07 not enough board games on roblox
general 2021-08-15 18:08:09 ive seen only 3
general 2021-08-15 18:08:14 4
general 2021-08-15 18:08:23 yeah 4
general 2021-08-15 18:08:58 monopoly, chess, uh.. That thing with the colored pegs whatever it was
general 2021-08-15 18:09:08 and another monopoly tbh
general 2021-08-15 18:09:13 Ye
general 2021-08-15 18:09:32 like, id wanna see battleship tbh
general 2021-08-15 18:11:55 i just want to get out of creative block
general 2021-08-15 18:11:59 pain
general 2021-08-15 18:13:23 <:pyramid:694767080578482206>
general 2021-08-15 18:14:10 Absolutely wont
general 2021-08-15 18:14:14 h
creations-chat 2021-08-15 18:25:25 Because we referred to the image you embedded when saying "ok", not the later one showing the map.
creations-chat 2021-08-15 18:48:58 Its charming, though I doubt anyone will respect that.
creations-chat 2021-08-15 18:51:41 i cant believe the idea that somethings vanilla is a valid reason to crap on builds here though <:bruhaps:646045387911725106>
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 18:52:31 Well he can become a bobbit worm and grasp things with claw mouth.
creations-chat 2021-08-15 18:55:54 i feel horrible for people who genuinely get smashed 6 feet under for being relatively new

like man i havent seen anybody at least appreciate them learning fast in here
creations-chat 2021-08-15 18:57:58 jesus christ chill out yall this aint a competition, cut people some slack
general 2021-08-15 18:59:31 Elon is exactly what happens when a discord user from pcc plays plane crazy irl
general 2021-08-15 18:59:45 ..cant say thats exactly a good thing
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:00:56 man

people never get along around here do they
general 2021-08-15 19:01:39 yeah well that explains why he wanted something as dumb as a space monitor for advertisements
general 2021-08-15 19:01:54 think of things too often and you run out of ideas, get burned out
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:03:01 its understandable, i just dont like how people actively, and i mean this: b u l l y people for things that they themselves did at first, its like a superiority complex
general 2021-08-15 19:03:36 pain
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:05:16 but yeah

pcc moment
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:07:28 its unfortunately a curse for big discord servers to be filled with insensitive people, but if willing to ignore them its gonna be alright: everyone learns at their own pace, and the fact you dont use tutorials for it is highly admirable
general 2021-08-15 19:08:19 nuke game but its actually a simulator for disarming it when
general 2021-08-15 19:08:52 <:IntendedFeature:706289545548660746>
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:12:24 i wouldnt entirely agree, i believe tutorials are good to learn basic mechanics for what youre trying to build: a tutorial helped me learn how things function on mechs, and what the physics behind them are

the problem with this is some people blindly follow tutorials, without actually taking a while to realize how something theyre copying functions
general 2021-08-15 19:13:54 Bluemotes???
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:17:36 Its not as simple to get over being shat on by 5 different people, as for them to simply not type a few things out

Reviewing is supposed to be constructive, point out flaws and suggest possible improvements as well as solutions, where as all I saw here was the most evident case of "nobody gives a damn"
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:19:48 And no, saying people should "make their builds more detailed" or anything similar isn't constructive, nor does it help them get a grasp on how to do it; it's more of shoving something down their throat, without explanation
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:21:49 so we can agree on something at the very least, I'm glad
general 2021-08-15 19:23:40 is cope like a new popular thing to say in 'ere or smth
general 2021-08-15 19:23:54 it seems like a recent thingy
general 2021-08-15 19:24:10 only **2000 or so mentions**
general 2021-08-15 19:24:44 Actual inventor
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:25:26 its bad in the eyes of the experienced, not so much for a freshie
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 19:26:07 I quite like the shape of that mini heli, it looked bigger than it actually was
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 19:26:45 wai
t

i called it mini
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 19:26:54 okay its not THAT small jesus im blind
general 2021-08-15 19:27:17 which is odd because usually its the other way around
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:29:22 Anybody honestly surprised?
general 2021-08-15 19:29:56 Absolutely.
general 2021-08-15 19:30:42 as harmless as it seems to be, we should just wait for more bricks to be added
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:31:26 The crash test mobile? Pretty dang fun concept! I'd love to see it perform live
general 2021-08-15 19:32:02 pain we unfortunately gotta endure
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 19:33:11 Well unfortunately it will succumb to the downvote spam, but you sure can
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 19:33:16 and you did
general 2021-08-15 19:34:17 wait
general 2021-08-15 19:34:24 oh god wait
general 2021-08-15 19:35:03 Are those disconnectors locked into eachothed at differentiating angles, with the flat part off?
general 2021-08-15 19:36:17 🤔
general 2021-08-15 19:37:14 Oh, it was milktrain
general 2021-08-15 19:37:23 heck
general 2021-08-15 19:38:49 Quick question, for I'm uncultured:

Where the heck do I get color roles
general 2021-08-15 19:39:05 fair enough.
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:39:36 its jawdropping tbh
general 2021-08-15 19:40:02 THIS MAN IS UNSTOPPABLE
general 2021-08-15 19:40:29 i still think the cylinder is like, disconnectors
general 2021-08-15 19:40:47 guess that means im on the right track?
general 2021-08-15 19:40:57 oh yes.
general 2021-08-15 19:41:31 ✨
general 2021-08-15 19:42:22 it could be a high amount of disconnectors?
general 2021-08-15 19:42:27 but eeeeeee
general 2021-08-15 19:42:37 itd lag a bit i guess
general 2021-08-15 19:43:04 unless, they somehow used an old weapon or cosmetic that was obtainable
general 2021-08-15 19:43:31 yeah man
creations-chat 2021-08-15 19:44:29 I thought it looked identical, even thought youre the same dude
general 2021-08-15 19:45:06 i missed fireworks and i cant handle it
general 2021-08-15 19:45:12 i want my FIREWORKS
general 2021-08-15 19:45:15 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2021-08-15 19:47:56 <:bruhaps:646045387911725106>
general 2021-08-15 19:49:07 yeah but when it does happen it also feels very random for everyone to just love the thing after bashing ppl
general 2021-08-15 19:49:14 its almost uncanny
general 2021-08-15 19:49:45 uhh
general 2021-08-15 19:49:50 BASICALLY
general 2021-08-15 19:50:18 it feels odd to see a whole server love something simple for a change, when usually its not exactly cared for
general 2021-08-15 19:50:57 insert every well known jet here
general 2021-08-15 19:51:16 if i make a jet you better be damn sure it has some strange quirk to it
general 2021-08-15 19:53:26 <:Thanos:559116346424557568>
general 2021-08-15 19:53:46 i remembed that
general 2021-08-15 19:54:06 square squares
general 2021-08-15 19:54:39 <:IntendedFeature:706289545548660746>
general 2021-08-15 19:55:10 dang
general 2021-08-15 19:59:04 no it looks fine
general 2021-08-15 19:59:36 well except maybe the staircase part yes
general 2021-08-15 20:02:16 mannnn
general 2021-08-15 20:04:59 poop

general 2021-08-15 20:07:10 Okay i dont mind staircases tbh its a simple solution but
general 2021-08-15 20:07:15 that looks pretty nice
creations-chat 2021-08-15 20:08:44 it keeps getting better and better
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 20:09:24 its the rotor color

plane-crazy 2021-08-15 21:06:55 WHOA
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 21:06:59 LETS GO
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 21:07:26 i love when people do things like that
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 21:07:35 just turn concepts on their heads,
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 21:07:44 Making useless but hilarious things happen
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 21:07:55 although, would the motor still work?
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 21:08:37 hnnngh
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 21:08:48 i mean yeah i guess but
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 21:09:00 if it could spin something it technically should work right
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:13:50 never expected to hear that term here, good luck on that!
creations-chat 2021-08-16 06:20:37 sounds nitpicky
general 2021-08-16 06:25:01 Internet
general 2021-08-16 06:25:08 haaaaaaaa
a
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:51:46 its studs per second yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:52:04 i guess that also means a foot is one stud
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:52:10 for robloxians
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 06:52:24 hol up what
creations-chat 2021-08-16 06:52:59 Lookin' cool chief
general 2021-08-16 10:14:05 It may look a little funny, but DANG it's smooth! How'd you stabilize it so well that it doesn't wobble side to side when walking?
general 2021-08-16 10:15:03 Ah
general 2021-08-16 10:15:21 Guess I need to learn how to do that then too.
creations-chat 2021-08-16 10:23:42 If you dont mind me asking, how much helium exactly is there in the limbs compared to the torso?
creations-chat 2021-08-16 10:25:48 WOAH, CORE FIGHTER MOMENT
general 2021-08-16 10:28:13 this man just posted a clown emote

🗿
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:29:34 i joined the server, talked for like two days and until the day before yesterday I never touched it again
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:29:44 No idea when i joined by this point
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:30:01 what
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:30:08 no man i dont need that stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:30:13 hhhh
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:30:43 i mean yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:31:07 July 7th 2019 apparently
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:31:14 i was present
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:31:24 stomp stomp stomp stomp
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:32:36 the one nobody ever builds
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:33:00 oh lawd she big
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:33:23 no idea, i have 0 knowledge about naval stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:33:41 BUT i know for a fact i like seeing builds of the less popular things
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:35:58 if i ever build a ship expect it to be some obscure unknown piece of junk i randomly decided is a good design
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:36:13 because yes
creations-chat 2021-08-16 10:37:01 shouldve been supersized at the very least
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:37:35 i suppose
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:37:51 I mean i dont even know the popular ones tbh
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:37:55 other than like 3
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:37:58 specific ones
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:39:35 Meanwhile i still contemplate why i cant make anything fly via aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:39:41 h e l l
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:40:05 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:40:10 you could get a model kit
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:40:23 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:40:29 i wanna doubt that but dang
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:40:42 H O W
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:40:55 you using space magic
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:41:30 i can only make things fly cause of helium but like
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:41:35 thats not what i want
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:41:42 i wanna make a reaaaal plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:42:48 sometimes i stare at things people make and feel worse about myself but at the same time
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:42:50 ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:43:43 epic dragonfly
general 2021-08-16 10:44:40 interesting concept, but for a suv like that you should keep the roof on
general 2021-08-16 10:44:48 although i bet it looks neat with a canvas roof
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:46:00 h
general 2021-08-16 10:46:19 love that thing
general 2021-08-16 10:46:24 its just
general 2021-08-16 10:46:26 mmm
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:48:13 h
general 2021-08-16 10:49:25 its not exactly the healthiest either, although too much meat aint either
general 2021-08-16 10:50:11 is this legit
general 2021-08-16 10:50:19 or is this some troll
general 2021-08-16 10:50:26 I cant exactly tell
general 2021-08-16 10:50:39 EHHH idk
general 2021-08-16 10:50:45 im not all that amused by it
general 2021-08-16 10:51:38 🗿
general 2021-08-16 10:52:03 im bored to bits and this aint even doing it for me
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:52:32 Pistons are god
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:53:16 i used them all my life and if you know whats ok they wont fail you
general 2021-08-16 10:53:52 im confused
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:54:39 i meant what i said and im very well aware of what i said
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:54:44 🤝
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:56:10 people really do think motorlock is the answer to everything huh
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:56:27 heresy
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:57:10 piston lock has the unfortunate disadvantage that it sometimes freezes builds like an anchor
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:57:19 but its like
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:57:22 easy to fix
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:58:16 well crap, might wanna report that in bugs
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 10:58:23 never experienced it though
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:00:48 well, with glitch based anything you can expect it to be unstable
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:01:09 not a whole lot to be done here, aside from avoiding doing exactly what causes it to break down
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:01:48 odd
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:01:57 maybe you should uhh
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:02:08 Temporarily mount some backup engines??
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:02:15 like ordinary ones
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:02:23 until you figure out a fix
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:02:42 dang
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:04:10 wait people thought suspension bends?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:04:16 lol no neither do pistons
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:04:31 thats
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:04:39 the opposite of my point
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:04:54 if you glitch it to bend sure itll bend
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:04:58 but who would want that
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:05:12 My point is normally they only can move in a linear motion
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:07:13 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:08:02 miscommunication between people 100
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:09:06 add some stiffness to the suspension
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:09:23 yeah so add some
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:09:30 fair
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:10:14 springs do bend
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:10:33 a
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:11:43 tbh there is some cases pistons arent exactly that powerful with but in mine it may just be due to friction
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:12:16 i have them lock my mechs top half to the bottom since i had to overcome height limit
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:12:31 so i just use super rockets to assist
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:12:36 then it locks fine
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:12:45 alr enjoy meal
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:13:50 oh also note thats with them being pulled up by helium
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:14:12 they still pull it all down until the surfaces rub against eachother
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:16:20 man if only there was a way to get rid of cheese grater wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:16:32 i mean they can look cool
general 2021-08-16 11:16:57 its a raining tacos animation
general 2021-08-16 11:17:04 mans just exaggerating
general 2021-08-16 11:17:18 theres supposed tocne a full release?
general 2021-08-16 11:17:23 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-08-16 11:18:09 i just want more wedges

general 2021-08-16 11:19:07 thats an odd lookin miata
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:19:57 I can see why they think its a bit wide, but it looks alright imo, not everything has to be 100% proportional to look good
general 2021-08-16 11:20:39 stay away from me with that thing
general 2021-08-16 11:21:04 I DONT KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF IT
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:21:15 o
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:22:48 I think you did great blending it all together, personally
general 2021-08-16 11:23:18 which gundam is that supposed to be tho
general 2021-08-16 11:23:25 it aint no rx-78-2
general 2021-08-16 11:26:34 jesus the smoke
general 2021-08-16 11:26:48 someone either badly maintained it or decided its ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:27:29 the real purpose of simple builds is to make an army
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:27:38 and i support the idea of mass production lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:27:49 it sounds like fun
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:28:36 ooo
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:28:41 Will some be remote controlled?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:28:48 or do you invite people to make these
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:29:02 best of luck
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:29:06 im sure itll be a fun one
general 2021-08-16 11:30:12 Oh no
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:30:46 mmm yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:30:48 good
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:32:03 Looks badass, i personally like vibrant colors myself too, no need to adjust to what the majority thinks!
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:32:53 its nice imo
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:33:02 love super tiny builds
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:33:08 theyre VERY charming
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:34:15 I also like it, have fun with it
general 2021-08-16 11:35:36 disgusting
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:35:50 oo
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:36:14 How well do they fly in tandem?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:36:27 ah
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:39:10 no, because at the end of the day its not a truck

ill add that tank destroyers have an open back too and they arent considered pickup trucks
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:39:40 tasteless
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:39:48 it looks perfectly fine and good
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:41:20 ehh, light can be a bit of a stretch considering things like the GMC Topkick exist but yeah compared to tanks
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:43:49 the funky one
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:44:00 o
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:46:52 might wanna mess around with triangle wedges and triangle wedgeblocks
general 2021-08-16 11:48:03 woah, the COOL ford
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 11:50:17 hehe nice
creations-chat 2021-08-16 11:58:02 Disguise it as a ship departing from the main one?
general 2021-08-16 13:05:24 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 13:06:30 i refuse to believe you didn't need someone to make the other half and combine it
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 13:06:40 that thing is MASSIVE
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 13:07:25 i admit i didnt look at the names
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 13:07:28 pain
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 13:09:04 h

plane-crazy 2021-08-16 13:32:01 except engineered
creations-chat 2021-08-16 13:48:27 I feel like I need to ask this, because of what I'm planning to build;
What do you guys think is the best way to tension tank tracks, while keeping it compact?
creations-chat 2021-08-16 13:50:33 ***that pains me, but I guess I may have to try***
Any possible alternatives, though?
the-dump 2021-08-16 13:51:09 
general 2021-08-16 14:53:57 watch someone buy these, and using their artillery knowledge make it work again
creations-chat 2021-08-16 14:56:26 na, it's exactly what makes it so nice
creations-chat 2021-08-16 14:59:14 Did no corner wedges work?

general 2021-08-16 15:02:47 joined for leopard 2A5, realized its one of the last tanks you get to unlock from the german section
general 2021-08-16 15:02:51 😔
creations-chat 2021-08-16 15:11:12 ..Wait, I just realized he has round corner wedges.

general 2021-08-16 17:02:13 h
general 2021-08-16 17:05:15 i wonder how many people here unironically get bothered by furries tbh tbh
general 2021-08-16 17:05:20 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
general 2021-08-16 17:05:45 lincoln tank
general 2021-08-16 17:07:10 <:stank:657279416946393099>
general 2021-08-16 17:07:43 i see no reason people downvoted that
general 2021-08-16 17:07:51 it looks perfectly fine
general 2021-08-16 17:10:22 i think the colors good
general 2021-08-16 17:10:29 but like, colors are subjective so
general 2021-08-16 17:10:42 floating wheels
general 2021-08-16 17:11:24 desaturated blue
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 17:12:42 bomb them
general 2021-08-16 17:14:53 he did
general 2021-08-16 17:15:00 but he also pissed on you
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 17:53:18 oooo
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 17:53:24 that's clean
creations-chat 2021-08-16 17:54:05 its not THAT jarring cmon man
general 2021-08-16 18:01:20 with ketchup?
general 2021-08-16 18:01:31 Dang
creations-chat 2021-08-16 18:02:44 Set the Red in your RGB to any given number, G and B you distribute to a lesser extent in order to lighten, darken or change shades of your red
the-dump 2021-08-16 18:11:00 im pretty sure thats still warnable
the-dump 2021-08-16 18:11:33 its 100% warnable man
the-dump 2021-08-16 18:11:44 h
the-dump 2021-08-16 18:12:12 Possibly
creations-chat 2021-08-16 18:13:48 Ehh it's fine, I don't (blank)lock, nor do I wanna. I prefer playing vanilla
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:14:40 First, check wedges2 and use the 1x2 triangle wedges. It will help you a lot.
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:14:56 forb!
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:15:02 its cool man
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:15:05 i dig it a lot
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:15:46 Instead of the wedges on the sides you have for the canopy.
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:17:16 That's understandable
general 2021-08-16 18:18:08 All.
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:19:14 I would say so, yeah, but sadly people here are so harsh they won't agree. They WILL tell you to lock parts in to make it look 'right' even if you don't want to, and work with vanilla limitations.
general 2021-08-16 18:19:55 "nah i censored it its ok"
>literally a minute later
general 2021-08-16 18:20:15 censored is still suggestive on top of that
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:21:28 I say ignore them, only listen to those who are understanding of your style and building preferences! Everyone here is way too subjective, when criticising things.
general 2021-08-16 18:23:02 does everyone here leave @on
general 2021-08-16 18:23:07 no matter what
general 2021-08-16 18:23:11 i always turn it off lol
general 2021-08-16 18:23:35 ITS A BUTTON RIGHT ON TOP OF YOUR CHAT BAR
general 2021-08-16 18:23:39 MAN
general 2021-08-16 18:24:53 instruction:
dont repeat the same mistake
general 2021-08-16 18:25:03 that's p much it
general 2021-08-16 18:25:12 hello
general 2021-08-16 18:25:27 hopefully you enjoyed the meal
general 2021-08-16 18:25:50 noice
general 2021-08-16 18:27:27 wait
general 2021-08-16 18:27:38 nono take a look at this:
general 2021-08-16 18:27:55 he was sent weird stuff by someone
BUT apparently no one can dm him because of personal settings??
general 2021-08-16 18:28:02 sounds off to me
general 2021-08-16 18:29:00 pain
general 2021-08-16 18:29:34 idk id still check just in case if hes actually been sent some dumb stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:30:24 theres so many and theyre all brilliant
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:30:33 i prefer them over the locked ones
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:31:25 its because of the community, they tend to push the idea that its necessary
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:32:03 whenever i speak about motorlock i always get kinda negative about the people who use it
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:32:08 but dang
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:32:37 i like the artillery btw
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:32:54 i say
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:33:03 if someone wants a build to look super realistic
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:33:11 its a better option to play astrocraft
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:33:36 because, too many people here are angry when something isn't perfectly scaled
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:34:01 like today i saw people laugh at a great build because it didn't have the rudders angled perfectly
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:34:12 though if it was it would make like a 0.2 stud difference
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:34:19 🗿
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:34:31 its borderline annoying
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:34:43 ooooh
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:34:55 see absolutely no motorlock was required
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:35:01 to make it look perfectly realistic
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:35:05 its proof!! 111!!
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:35:20 no matter
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:35:27 if it has to be big, it shall be big
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:35:35 robloxians arent to scale with humans anyways
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:35:39 theyre like, tiny
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:35:51 so building "to scale" isnt really to scale
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:35:55 just with yourself
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:36:22 also hey the bigger it is the cooler it looks
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:36:46 oh it absolutely pushes things, but i wouldnt say the way its treated is good
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:37:24 I personally dont use it because I dont know how, I fear that some day it will be irreversibly patched, and I hate using glitches in the first place
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:38:05 sad truth
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:38:14 one day it may be different though
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:38:50 yeah but roblox itself fixed it once
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:38:56 despite being left in
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:39:02 pain
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:39:12 hmmn
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:39:15 still
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:39:22 id rather just not
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:39:48 because even if it is coded, its basically a forced glitch
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:39:58 and i again: dont like glitches
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:40:01 anywhere.
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:40:16 thats what i meant by forced glitch
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:40:45 thaaaat it works the same as when it was a glitch therefore it barely makes a difference?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:41:15 but it functions the exact same is the thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:41:52 i feel like youre missing the point or misread what i really mean by it
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:43:40 yes im aware, and you did change my mind about the patching thing when you first mentioned it
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:43:57 it makes sense that if its coded it won't be patched
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:44:14 so thats no longer really a concern for me
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:44:38 mmm
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:44:43 make it slightly sharper
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:45:42 the real thing is less of a tube, its a little more of an oval
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 18:45:55 wedges, a lot of them
general 2021-08-16 18:46:33 if you didnt draw it, looking from the eyes of a stranger it looks like some strange crystal formation
general 2021-08-16 18:46:42 but since you did draw it you probably just see lines
general 2021-08-16 18:46:49 pain
general 2021-08-16 18:46:56 anybody else ever have that issue
general 2021-08-16 18:48:02 Level 3 in the server, you get EXP for it
general 2021-08-16 18:48:16 by being active to be specific
general 2021-08-16 18:48:28 you can check it in bot commands
general 2021-08-16 18:49:18 i mean
general 2021-08-16 18:49:30 you can check current level and exp BY bot commands
general 2021-08-16 18:49:32 h
general 2021-08-16 18:50:25 its a 50/50
general 2021-08-16 18:50:37 but roblox kinda left all Halloween crap in our hands by ugc
general 2021-08-16 18:50:53 i doubt theyll do an event for free hats like they used to
general 2021-08-16 18:50:59 sadly
general 2021-08-16 18:52:21 that's
general 2021-08-16 18:52:29 quite a weird topic
general 2021-08-16 18:52:57 no not uh really
general 2021-08-16 18:53:07 things kinda enforce anti-piracy
general 2021-08-16 18:53:41 you can technically pirate abandonware legally, but not much more than that
general 2021-08-16 18:55:49 abandonware: any kind of software that has been discontinued, and no longer earns the developers money: cant be found being sold by any real official stores, outside resellers or overstocked shops
general 2021-08-16 18:56:15 tldr:
all the games that even the devs forgot about
general 2021-08-16 18:57:07 a few examples could include:
general 2021-08-16 18:57:15 *ahem*
general 2021-08-16 18:57:31 lego racers, metal fatigue
general 2021-08-16 18:59:17 nvm turns out metal fatigue is not abandonware whoops
general 2021-08-16 18:59:27 thats still being sold officially
general 2021-08-16 18:59:55 then ill replace it with another example
general 2021-08-16 19:00:03 the cybertron games for transformers
creations-chat 2021-08-16 19:00:46 its glorious
general 2021-08-16 19:02:32 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>

general 2021-08-16 19:30:59 why the hell was it disliked
general 2021-08-16 19:31:13 he didn't mention it being wip, pretty sure it was intentional to just make the cockpit?
general 2021-08-16 19:31:27 if so then so does a real A-10
general 2021-08-16 19:31:37 yeah
general 2021-08-16 19:31:40 anything wrong with that
general 2021-08-16 19:31:46 its basically art
general 2021-08-16 19:31:52 sculpting i suppose
general 2021-08-16 19:32:24 ok cool i didnt wanna argue either
general 2021-08-16 19:32:39 HOWEVER i know what an a-10 looks like and this is close enough

general 2021-08-16 19:52:08 Instead of having tea ruined, think of something else like coffee
general 2021-08-16 19:52:13 that way it cant be ruined
creations-chat 2021-08-16 20:03:35 Try maybe a dark blue color, with yellow highlights?
general 2021-08-16 20:07:07 man i love those planes with the giant radar dishes
general 2021-08-16 20:07:24 just aesthetically

creations-chat 2021-08-16 20:34:10 yeah sure, i dont see why not

creations-chat 2021-08-17 06:14:29 dear god i lost any hope that people can motivate newbies to get better in here after reading whats up there

general 2021-08-17 06:23:54 Just a disclaimer:
He could be acting, and not actually be underaged, keep it in mind
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 06:25:05 I don't know how swashplates work, I'd like to learn though.
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 06:26:13 I could also just do a tutorial and gather info I learned from building
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 06:26:19 *whee*

plane-crazy 2021-08-17 06:27:48 Alright, sounds like a plan then
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 06:28:30 I wish I could make helicopters, though.

plane-crazy 2021-08-17 06:29:02 I cant get a jet to fly, so no wonder I can't build a heli.

plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:52:37 That's the name of the Gundam.
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:52:57 bruh.
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 10:53:23 man he built it so compact too
creations-chat 2021-08-17 10:57:40 man that beam effect is so cool tho
creations-chat 2021-08-17 11:00:04 I'm not sure about the accuracy, as I'm not too familiar with the specifics of this crossover goji HOWEVER it so far looks amazing. Could you perhaps tell me how you achieved the effect? I think it'd look cool for beam rifles in gundam builds too, so I'd love to incorporate something similar.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 11:02:35 Understood, thank you. Do I need to motorlock any more into one another to make it as smooth as that too or is it not necessary?
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:07:46 That doesn't even seem like discriminatory speech?
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:07:55 I mean, unless you were secretly talkin' smack.

plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:23:08 cause happy means *happy*
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:23:13 light-hearted and carefree is *jolly*
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:23:22 soooooooooooo
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:23:36 it is strictly a term for a person who likes the same gender now
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 11:23:45 *which* somehow keeps getting used as an insult.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 11:25:33 thank you, I was hoping someone would make this
creations-chat 2021-08-17 11:28:01 worth every single one
general 2021-08-17 11:31:15 at least it looks good
general 2021-08-17 11:32:43 dude
general 2021-08-17 11:32:47 EVERYBODY can copy the cybertruck
general 2021-08-17 11:33:30 seeeeee?
general 2021-08-17 11:34:14 nnnnnnnno.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 11:59:28 I think it's because it's space occupance is as high as it could possibly be, and the person building it didn't know how to fold?
creations-chat 2021-08-17 12:01:36 With that much space? Yeah, pretty much.
Though, it's still not THAT much of a half sphere, more of a flat cone.
general 2021-08-17 12:19:41 Happy B-Day fam!
general 2021-08-17 12:20:03 You did at least see it, right?
general 2021-08-17 12:20:07 Because it's a re-boot.
general 2021-08-17 12:20:09 H
general 2021-08-17 12:20:23 Fair enough.
general 2021-08-17 12:20:57 They didn't because the bayverse one became too popular
general 2021-08-17 12:21:02 so they kinda took it for marketing
general 2021-08-17 12:21:11 Plus nobody would've recognized him
general 2021-08-17 12:21:24 At the very least, we got cliffjumper
general 2021-08-17 12:21:28 ~~..for a few seconds~~
general 2021-08-17 12:22:14 You could also just search the cybertron scene
general 2021-08-17 12:22:19 h
general 2021-08-17 12:22:19 without quotes
creations-chat 2021-08-17 12:22:40 Hey that's pretty nice.
general 2021-08-17 12:23:12 Anybody interested in rise of the beasts?
general 2021-08-17 12:23:22 Has been a bit long since a movie came out
general 2021-08-17 12:23:54 well waspinator is the kind of guy that *wont* blend into the movie well without a change of attitude
general 2021-08-17 12:24:09 and people will burn your house down if that happens
general 2021-08-17 12:24:28 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2021-08-17 12:24:30 Happens.
general 2021-08-17 12:24:41 --Wait, do you mind if I know what'cha been beaned for?
general 2021-08-17 12:25:06 h
general 2021-08-17 12:25:51 I think today actually
general 2021-08-17 12:26:06 judging from the fact he got updated?
general 2021-08-17 12:27:06 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
general 2021-08-17 12:27:07 Pretty gud.
general 2021-08-17 12:28:12 I can't judge because when I joined, I only spoke for like a day or two. Barely at that.
general 2021-08-17 12:28:20 But from what I DO see here now that I became active..
general 2021-08-17 12:28:27 Eeeeeeh.
general 2021-08-17 12:28:32 People judge too much on personal bias.
general 2021-08-17 12:30:14 Dunno bro, it IS possible to judge according to logical assumptions

plane-crazy 2021-08-17 13:40:06 they ain' even that loud to be annoying
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 13:40:09 sheesh
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 13:40:43 hmmnnn..
creations-chat 2021-08-17 13:42:21 
creations-chat 2021-08-17 13:46:44 either way the funi "hair" is missing
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:15:36 <@273536574770380800>
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:18:44 Its not really Half Life 3 though.
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:18:52 Its more of Half Life 2.5
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:19:14 Because it doesn't pick up after 2, it retcons its ending
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:19:23 Unless you aren't talking about alyx
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:19:35 And i indeed missed something
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:19:46 yeah then its more or less a prequel and a retcon
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:20:21 Technically speaking yes it is half life 3
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:20:32 but franchise wise not really
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:21:23 Dlc dont count
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:21:28 Theyre addons
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:21:34 FOR a game
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:21:42 If they did, you could run them without the base game
the-dump 2021-08-17 14:21:54 hhhhh
general 2021-08-17 14:28:28 <:BanHammer:507685761496252420>

the-dump 2021-08-17 14:31:37 h
general 2021-08-17 14:32:04 The problem was we all know what the joke is, which is no different than actually saying the word
general 2021-08-17 14:44:26 we aint doin this rn
creations-chat 2021-08-17 14:46:30 Chill, if nobody talking anything then it most likely means the build doesn't have any real flaws. Granted, I suppose we should have gave our thoughts sooner, that's true.
general 2021-08-17 14:47:36 no seriously can we not right now
general 2021-08-17 14:47:38 :/
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 14:49:52 Is it a recreation of something? Asking in advance, since, I think it looks like a space-ship and I like that about it, the problem being if it was supposed to be something and I said it looks like something else that may dissapoint you hHHhh
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 14:50:03 ah
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 14:50:06 alr whew
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 14:50:50 Hmm
general 2021-08-17 14:52:09 mmm bowling
general 2021-08-17 14:52:16 Wait.
general 2021-08-17 14:52:20 That sounds like a cool idea
general 2021-08-17 14:54:53 sir im quite certain that's a tennis match
creations-chat 2021-08-17 14:56:18 People find them annoying, as there's not much you can do against them without a fast and nimble vehicle

But I say sure, if you wanna
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 14:58:34 a
creations-chat 2021-08-17 14:59:34 i mean they really are easy to destroy if you have the required vehicle to put it on, it could be a very fast terrain vehicle or a jet
general 2021-08-17 15:00:54 never gonna understand why thats funny
general 2021-08-17 15:01:05 to people
general 2021-08-17 15:01:24 nay
general 2021-08-17 15:02:28 thats enough copyright claims to terminate an account
general 2021-08-17 15:02:31 what on earth
general 2021-08-17 15:02:45 stealthje
general 2021-08-17 15:04:01 Wait whats the topic
general 2021-08-17 15:04:04 anymore
general 2021-08-17 15:04:09 whO?
general 2021-08-17 15:04:26 w h o
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:05:14 i thought you loved pistons
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:06:26 too much strain i assume?
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:06:48 wait actually, how DO hover drives work
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:07:12 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:07:22 so wait
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:08:02 i know this much:
hover drives push themselves alongside the vehicle by repelling against pieces inside the vehicle, even though its attached
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:08:15 that it in a nutshell?
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:08:19 ye
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:08:35 how does one go about making one
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:08:41 it seems like a decent drive
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:09:06 mm
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:09:42 a ic
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:09:56 and is there any difference in power depending on how its assembled or na
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:10:15 alright
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:10:35 maybe ill try it out
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:10:56 i mean, maybe itll finally allow me to make something fly
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:11:03 like a proper airplane
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:11:31 thats fair
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:11:40 but uhhh
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:11:43 wouldn't like
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:12:06 placing em closer fix that or would they clip behind the welded block eventually and stop propelling the vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:12:23 because the welded block is now in the way of the hover
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:12:37 unless that aint how it works idk
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:12:44 just hypothetical
general 2021-08-17 15:13:02 cutter shotgun tank
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:13:29 yeah im talking about the pushed piece
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:13:54 hm
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:14:17 I see
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:15:13 a
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:15:18 I would but uhh
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:15:20 im off pc rn
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:15:25 in 2 hours i maybe could
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:15:35 sorry
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:16:51 honestly I'd expect the one with alternating pattern to be
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:17:02 epic!
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:18:01 o
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:18:19 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:18:23 its just two more motors tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:18:32 o
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:18:59 how strong would one of these be
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:19:23 damn
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:19:25 thats a lot
general 2021-08-17 15:19:57 cant they like
general 2021-08-17 15:20:25 cant rickje just make blacklisted people noclip through eachother and cutters or is that impossible
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:20:59 i also heard of other engines but this one seems to be most straight forward
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:21:48 so like
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:21:58 less acceleration but faster max speed
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:22:17 o
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:22:54 wait but how come it's faster then if its less powerful
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:23:13 am i just having a brain malfunction
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:23:30 funi
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:24:20 so basically a glorified ram
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:24:23 sounds fun
general 2021-08-17 15:25:19 if tailed, sprinkle some fire and hope itll burn off a decent component
general 2021-08-17 15:25:27 ig thats more defensive
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:25:50 im gonna be excited to see that
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:26:01 SHEEEEESH
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:26:16 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:26:30 well even if it turns out a little shorter its still huge
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:26:46 ah
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:26:52 but isnt his like 5 plots large
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:26:57 ye
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:27:02 O
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:27:08 nonono bro do it
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:27:11 i believe in you
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:27:35 hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:28:04 how long we talkin
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:28:09 compared to the body
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:28:12 oh god
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:28:26 so wait what if
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:28:40 the plane was skinny but very long isnt there a plane like that?
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:28:47 wouldn't that count as 6 plots long
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:28:49 or large
general 2021-08-17 15:29:15 Real
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:29:27 OH GOD
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:29:45 sheesh
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:30:11 well either way i hope i can learn how to fold things well one day because id love to make a several plot large robot
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:30:20 ooooo
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:30:24 that sounds awesome
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:30:41 most likely
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:30:53 maybe you should
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:31:04 try do some tests on how hard you can fold something
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:31:08 before building it
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:31:44 i mean its probably better than realizing theres a way to make it more compact in the middle of building
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:32:03 or after it's done
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:32:23 >>smh i have two complete mech legs i couldve made a bit better
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:33:03 speaking of its not even finished cause im afraid to touch the arms
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:33:32 i want them to be as accurate as possible but i cant put a decent way of making it in my head
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 15:34:16 pain pain pain pain

general 2021-08-18 10:33:14 embed failure
general 2021-08-18 10:33:39 fair
general 2021-08-18 10:34:01 i refuse to say anything about the image above
general 2021-08-18 10:34:24 pol

general 2021-08-18 10:34:39 stop
general 2021-08-18 10:34:41 STOP
general 2021-08-18 10:34:53 HOW HAVE I NEVER REALIZED THIS BEFORE
general 2021-08-18 10:35:07 ~~oh please dont~~
the-dump 2021-08-18 10:35:57 hnn
the-dump 2021-08-18 10:36:03 okay i have only one suggestion when choosing a new pfp
the-dump 2021-08-18 10:36:08 try to be less stereotypical about it
the-dump 2021-08-18 10:36:14 i see so many people who like russian, german or whatever stuff
the-dump 2021-08-18 10:36:19 but then their pfp's are all the same jokes
the-dump 2021-08-18 10:36:24 its stale by now, very stale
the-dump 2021-08-18 10:36:33 of course i dont judge if you like it
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 10:37:02 i have one question about it
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 10:37:13 whats the purpose of the whole ammo rack lifting and lowering
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 10:37:21 when it can just remain stationary and keep feeding
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 10:37:31 i dont mind the gimmick, i in fact like gimmicks like that but i do wonder
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 10:37:41 fair
general 2021-08-18 10:38:08 well they barely are trying to be roblox
general 2021-08-18 10:38:15 theyre just blender models slapped into roblox
general 2021-08-18 10:38:19 not trying to replicate the style
general 2021-08-18 10:38:24 😔
general 2021-08-18 10:39:25 those are arguably better
general 2021-08-18 10:39:32 they at least can work in roblox, somewhat
general 2021-08-18 10:39:39 considering the more cartoony nature
general 2021-08-18 10:40:59 that
general 2021-08-18 10:41:02 is very debatable
general 2021-08-18 10:41:15 and i suspect 90% of the reason is all the anime references and furry items
general 2021-08-18 10:41:20 not much else
general 2021-08-18 10:41:30 you have
general 2021-08-18 10:41:32 no idea how glad i am
general 2021-08-18 10:41:33 to hear that
general 2021-08-18 10:41:47 <:EYES:525319504721608705>
general 2021-08-18 10:41:49 say WHAT
general 2021-08-18 10:42:11 oh
general 2021-08-18 10:42:18 the freakin'
general 2021-08-18 10:42:22 21472107421747 variations of the same crap
general 2021-08-18 10:42:36 and ideas
general 2021-08-18 10:42:47 hnnnnnnn yeah its a bit yucky but i guess its cool to have options?
general 2021-08-18 10:42:57 WHOA
general 2021-08-18 10:42:58 THING
general 2021-08-18 10:43:32 funi
general 2021-08-18 10:44:00 my biggest issue with the catalog at the moment is
general 2021-08-18 10:44:24 roblox randomly decided to remove some useful categories when searching, such as medieval only items
general 2021-08-18 10:44:32 and they screwed up the god damn search bar
general 2021-08-18 10:44:34 AND DIDNT FIX IT
general 2021-08-18 10:44:36 ***FOR MONTHS***
general 2021-08-18 10:44:42 HELL, A YEAR MAYBE???
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 10:44:59 he gon' flap da wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 10:45:04 drop all the bombs he needs
general 2021-08-18 10:45:16 well at least they made poland colored right
general 2021-08-18 10:45:19 for once
general 2021-08-18 10:45:31 like its funny to mistake it with indonesia in the first place..
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 10:45:51 i mean hes technically right though?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 10:45:57 helium does the job of a gyroscope rather well, for now
general 2021-08-18 10:46:13 i know
general 2021-08-18 10:46:19 im just saying it aint funny that a colors swapped
general 2021-08-18 10:46:23 its just lame
general 2021-08-18 10:46:24 boring, even
general 2021-08-18 10:47:28 🗿
general 2021-08-18 10:48:03 roblox lately removed "friends played" game list for no reason too
general 2021-08-18 10:48:06 god
general 2021-08-18 10:48:24 i hate items that are literally just a few bricks you can actually make in studio without any special tools
general 2021-08-18 10:48:32 that get priced
general 2021-08-18 10:48:37 anything at all
general 2021-08-18 10:49:13 maybe they should just not care then
general 2021-08-18 10:49:18 no big deal in that
general 2021-08-18 10:49:39 like
general 2021-08-18 10:49:47 fully serious when i say this:
general 2021-08-18 10:50:06 if a friend of yours complains about what you play, because of what fandom it belongs to: theyre just blindsighted
general 2021-08-18 10:50:17 if it was something ACTUALLY weird like, you know, *those* games..
general 2021-08-18 10:50:19 then sure
general 2021-08-18 10:50:27 but a freakin' furry game??
general 2021-08-18 10:50:29 who gives a DAMN
general 2021-08-18 10:50:57 my favourite kinds of ugc items are historically accurate medieval weapons
general 2021-08-18 10:51:06 not enough appreciation for those around those days
general 2021-08-18 10:51:16 like
general 2021-08-18 10:51:25 when do we get a surcoat accessory for example?
general 2021-08-18 10:51:28 thatd look sick
general 2021-08-18 10:51:42 to have a proper 3d surcoat on top of chainmail
general 2021-08-18 10:51:46 or a gambeson
general 2021-08-18 10:51:48 y'know
general 2021-08-18 10:52:36 also yes im specifically naming the items as they are historically to flex my still fairly limited knowledge about said things
general 2021-08-18 10:52:38 B)
general 2021-08-18 10:54:37 <@!526422085875007498> Crop this
general 2021-08-18 10:54:45 
general 2021-08-18 10:54:53 
general 2021-08-18 10:55:44 Pretty neat.
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 10:56:01 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 10:56:15 plane crazy is only about planes in name
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 10:56:21 probably because its inspired by simple planes
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 10:56:27 but in both, people make wildly different things
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 10:56:46 or that
general 2021-08-18 10:59:12 I need
general 2021-08-18 10:59:14 context?
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 10:59:47 ^
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 11:00:32 in the end, it's all optional
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 11:00:44 so i agree that dedicated gyroscope blocks would be nice to have either way
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 11:00:50 they CAN indeed help
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 11:00:57 but if people want to, they can make their own just as easy
general 2021-08-18 11:01:56 not quite the context i needed but it is good lore
general 2021-08-18 11:02:08 lo
general 2021-08-18 11:02:31 Take her to california
general 2021-08-18 11:03:21 3d pixel art at it's finest
general 2021-08-18 11:04:26 HGFNSDFHFGMdh
general 2021-08-18 11:04:27 i should
general 2021-08-18 11:04:34 PROBABLY start working on what I have in mind
general 2021-08-18 11:04:44 but I lack motivation to do so when I'm not playing with someone I'm familiar with
general 2021-08-18 11:04:46 to chat with

general 2021-08-18 11:36:09 since its supposed to be aerial, I dont plan on it to walk
general 2021-08-18 11:36:24 as a result ill just use motor 2's to do specific poses depending on where i thrust

general 2021-08-21 11:21:53 Man, I wish lasers were a thing in plane crazy
general 2021-08-21 11:22:16 no like actual weapon lasers
general 2021-08-21 11:22:23 is what i meant
general 2021-08-21 11:22:39 🤔
creations-chat 2021-08-21 11:24:01 I'm sure PC will remain active even once the sequel releases
general 2021-08-21 11:25:33 Sorry but, I only really RP in dedicated RP games
general 2021-08-21 11:25:43 .. And things I'm actually knowledgeable about h
general 2021-08-21 11:26:17 ***there's a lot to argue about it being otherwise***
general 2021-08-21 11:26:46 Plane Crazy is a technical voxel based builder game, with clear PVP elements.
general 2021-08-21 11:26:55 Roleplay is possible, but limited.
general 2021-08-21 11:27:12 Not a real intention of the game in other words.
general 2021-08-21 11:30:08 i expected someone to get worked up over fire calling it a rp game quicker tbh
general 2021-08-21 11:31:58 Actually, that's what the game is about if you think 'bout it..
general 2021-08-21 11:32:20 ey now no need to call eachother bitches
general 2021-08-21 11:32:23 h
general 2021-08-21 11:32:34 this is becoming a hellhole REAL fast
general 2021-08-21 11:33:02 You missed my half joke
general 2021-08-21 11:33:15 The point is, imagination IS what allows you to make said things fly.
general 2021-08-21 11:33:24 In form of constructing things
general 2021-08-21 11:33:34 building does require imagination so
general 2021-08-21 11:34:17 ..Still missing the point
general 2021-08-21 11:34:27 think about it less magical, more technical side of imagination
general 2021-08-21 11:34:36 S h e e s h
general 2021-08-21 11:35:00 HHHHHHH
general 2021-08-21 11:36:11 thats

general 2021-08-21 11:39:11 they exist
general 2021-08-21 11:39:12 *cough*
general 2021-08-21 11:39:53 idk, doesnt seem to be that necessary here actually..
general 2021-08-21 11:40:05 the server is rather stable, rarely does anything bad ever happen
general 2021-08-21 11:40:12 unlike other places-
general 2021-08-21 11:41:01 mate this game is popular as hell it already blew up
general 2021-08-21 11:41:10 just seems that 90% of the people ignore the server
general 2021-08-21 11:41:17 its always the same faces I see
general 2021-08-21 11:41:21 🤔
general 2021-08-21 11:42:04 well, you for sure are one

general 2021-08-21 11:43:49 on one hand i dont blame said people because people really suck at criticizing here sometimes
general 2021-08-21 11:43:55 but on the other, they may be too easily demotivated
general 2021-08-21 11:44:47 and then theres people like me who constantly complain about how people criticize others <:pain:644301805534183464>
general 2021-08-21 11:47:10 dont forget the fairly recent bot wave ban

plane-crazy 2021-08-21 15:29:59 Call it a hybrid next time
general 2021-08-21 15:31:36 first of all, "tik__i__tok"
general 2021-08-21 15:31:51 second, the guys behind it are kinda shady
general 2021-08-21 15:31:55 sheesh
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 15:32:26 a functional canopy
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 15:32:33 dont have to be super real

plane-crazy 2021-08-21 15:34:08 ah shite
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 15:34:15 eh

plane-crazy 2021-08-21 15:38:47 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 15:46:20 everytime i see something like this i always try to speak some sense into people
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 15:46:27 i dont think it works but oh well
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 15:47:28 At that point, might as well make a select and move tool to clip blocks into eachother
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 15:47:46 did i leave @on
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 15:47:50 pain pain pain pain
creations-chat 2021-08-21 15:49:34 No, weapons won't fix it.
I believe you could however improve it by rounding out the wings, try triangle wedges 1x2 in place of the side 1x2 wedges.
(side note: if they're supposed to be rectangular I'm sorry, I don't know much about planes.)
creations-chat 2021-08-21 15:51:36 You're right, but this specific plane is based on real life. A custom "what if" could be made, but it doesn't seem to be the intention of the builder.
creations-chat 2021-08-21 15:54:01 Okay, calm down, remember the "extensive swearing" rule. It's just  someone who likes weapons, I guess
creations-chat 2021-08-21 15:59:25 PVP is a rather big part of Plane Crazy nowadays, let's be honest, but the main fun always was, and still is the technical element behind the whole game. It's the main entertainment point for many. Will, if you like the PVP most and freedom of making any doomsday machine you like, that's cool but please remember that unfortunately most people here are for the engineering side of things, not weapons.
creations-chat 2021-08-21 16:02:19 It's his schtick, completely fine to do that! I don't mind if that's what they end up being, as long as they do their purpose well. The only issue is, people tend to get mad at him for his lack of understanding that people don't really like putting guns on their creations if they're not meant to be PVP oriented. Usually, people outright state of their builds are for PVP, if they don't they most likely aren't and is the reason behind a lack of weapons. It's kind of an issue for both sides how it currently is handled..
creations-chat 2021-08-21 16:05:28 I suppose with how people use Motorlock, it's true.. Most people do like looks here.
I personally like to make my creations function though, which is why I like mechs so much. They work, while looking cool. A perfect 50/50, and with the surface area available a lot of features can be implemented (even if I'm re-creating something initially)
creations-chat 2021-08-21 16:08:49 True, I ain't got nothing to say about that. However I admit to also being a fan of builds that do their job and nothing more, looks aren't everything is what I'm pointin' to I guess?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:12:51 YOOOO NICE
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:13:04 I really gotta try and make some tbh..
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:14:00 Its unfortunate how they won't really truly work, but hey it's a good novelty to have!
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:15:23 My best guess is uh..
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:15:25 ..
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:15:32 I have no guesses
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:16:46 freakin' uhh
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:16:50 sights maybe idk
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:17:06 i have no idea how tanks work
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:17:11 yet
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:17:55 Its related to a plane crazy creation
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:18:00 just sayin
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:19:10 no bro thats just pc2
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:19:14 real
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:20:03 wacky
general 2021-08-21 16:24:02 smooth
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:25:29 Aaaa
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:25:41 im experiencing something i cant quite name
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:25:53 i cant get around to building anything
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:26:44 and because of that i keep saying ill make something and then decide "nah ill build this instead", realize it's not working and say "i should focus on what I wanted to make originally".. And then not do it again.
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:26:58 I haven't made anything in months, man
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:27:13 hnnn
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:27:20 Maybe..
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:27:54 I also thought of picking something simpler just so I can get back into the feel of building
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:28:15 I could show a reference.
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:28:56 Was thinking of building this today, the Blue Destiny unit 3.
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:29:15 Last time I wanted to make an equally simple design, but the thing is that one had a transformation.
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:29:38 I dont think I'm ready for that?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:29:48 Alright.
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:29:59 Its what I should do anyway, the head is very important
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:30:26 I have a 80% complete mech meanwhile
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:30:41 And I can't go on because the arms will be tricky to make
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:30:48 I'm afraid of screwing it up.
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:31:06 It may end up inconsistent, inaccurate
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:31:52 Yeah thats the thing..
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:32:10 I cant begin the shoulder because that's the biggest thing I need to get right.
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:32:43 Hmmn, here lemme show you what it needs to look like as on reference.
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:33:24 
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:33:32 Alright, I will.
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:33:40 YEAH
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:33:53 The legs are a little different, so I didn't need to worry as much.
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:34:18 The problem now is, if only I actually built them segmented and movable the arms would be more consistent now.
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:34:29 But its way too much work to redo that now
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:34:57 hmmn
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:35:14 stroke moment
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:35:18 happens a lot
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:35:37 I think I have an image somewhere of how I have the build rn somewhere..
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:36:20 Mm
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:36:40 
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:36:45 funi
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:37:09 maybe I'll try a V2 in PC2 one day
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:37:15 danke
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:37:29 it used to go 360 all around the body like it canonically can, but it lacked the black backing
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:37:36 so I had to scrap that
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:38:04 It uses a suspension to go up and down on the track
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:38:08 Uhh
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:38:12 Not at all its
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:38:21 actually just connected to the top of the head
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:38:28 and the bottom is just floor
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:38:34 Mostly helium
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:38:44 uhh no
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:38:57 oh that
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:39:00 yyyeah its a wedge
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:39:11 big long one
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:39:25 I dont motorlock my builds, just personal choice
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:39:38 So theres a bunch of things I had to compensate on
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:40:14 ye that is a big wedge
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:40:28 its like that on the real thing too, just not as wide
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:41:13 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:41:19 lemme see
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:42:33 15 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:43:28 Welcome!
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:43:58 Yeah just uhh, beware that people are real harsh on builds
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:44:04 Don't get too demotivated
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:44:35 I think ones slanted forward look sick.
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:46:47 You need to get activity XP first,
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:46:52 Level 3 gives image perms

plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:49:26 **hEY THATS ACCURATE TO THE DESIGN**
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:49:37 sEEEEEE
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:49:54 z'gok moment
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:51:00 🤝
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:51:08 funny design gang
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:51:15 god i love that chainsaw
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:51:34 well yeah, things like that are kinda unavoidable
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:51:43 sure, it isn't too hard
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:51:53 the only hard part is making sure it's uhh
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:51:59 not too wobbly
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:52:20 man
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:52:28 am i glad theres gundam fans around those areas
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:52:52 I have like, literally 1 friend who's into gundam
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:53:02 and even then I'm the one who's super crazy about it
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:53:39 👀
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:53:56 now thats a crazy way to get into gundam
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:54:26 Mine's also kinda odd, it all began when that same friend found an arcade game he used to play when younger.. It happened to be a gundam arcade.
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:54:40 And it spiraled down into my obsession then
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:54:46 Figured I liked the idea of it.
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:55:25 ** **
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:56:01 technically speaking? yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:56:15 if air happens to have more moisture in it at the moment, you could consider it wet
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:56:49 giant
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:57:11 if theres something I specifically like about warhammer, it's the titans
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:57:23 the big ol' colossal warlords
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:57:39 ~~and every tau mech ever~~

plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:58:47 didnt notice its a daily dose of internet
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:58:58 oh well guess you get extra then
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:59:42 brethren
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 16:59:50 🤔
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:00:56 it is what it is
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:01:01 YOOOOOOOO
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:01:18 THE ATLAN
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:01:26 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:01:29 it's the atlan mech
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:01:44 well it is based on him
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:02:10 It's a giant mech used by the sentinels to defeat titans
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:02:23 aka the super large demons
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:03:34 
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:03:54 the slayer has one in his base, actually
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:03:58 although incomplete
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:04:10 or being dismantled
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:04:27 fun fact;
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:04:44 The Atlan was actually designed by someone who worked on the Pacific Rim Jaegers
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:04:50 👍
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:05:17 well we got something kind of like that
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:05:35 except that part
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:06:02 
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:06:25 as bad as uprising was, the black was a pretty nice side-story to it
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:06:44 if you just take it less realistically like the original pacific rim tried to be anyways
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:06:50 otherwise its kinda too wild still
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:07:15 freakin'
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:07:24 sheesh
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:07:24 to think that thing was a robot
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 17:08:25 ballista is essential for weapon combo's

plane-crazy 2021-08-21 21:07:58 I also like it, but some more 3-dimensional surfaces would definitely help it a bunch. Try adding some rocks or bumps in the terrain?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 21:08:12 I would also suggest slight railing to the stairs.

plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:32:21 dude it was a goddam joke, its obvious as hell considering they didnt post absolutely anything that couldve scammed people
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:32:45 like weep posted a goddam image with a circled button
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:32:53 how the hell is that convincing
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:33:45 it even shows how much nitro costs to purchase
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:34:00 this by any means does not count im 100% sure of that
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:37:04 he did it once actually
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:37:11 its not really mini modding
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:37:16 excessively
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:38:50 bro
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:39:01 he really wasnt EXCESSIVELY mini modding
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:39:11 like ok now theres two problems here
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:39:13 dang
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:39:58 if he did it once its not excessive
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:40:07 besides, he tried to post a pic
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:40:32 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:40:58 Mate i snitch to the mods whenever someone posts a suggestive thats like
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:41:05 if anyones to be accused of mini modding its me
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:41:13 i do that crap a lot
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:41:32 but somehow i wasnt
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:41:33 h
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:42:34 misunderstanding of the situation
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:42:56 two vs entire people

plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:44:35 a
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:44:55 i guess its a little overboard
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:45:02 but its also not exactly harmful either
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:45:20 im sure he doesn't just paste a god dam 100 message long report list
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 11:45:26 to a single mod

plane-crazy 2021-08-22 12:02:10 then again after the whole fuss its possible he lost his drive to do it anymore
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 12:02:21 yousuf defended him already

general 2021-08-22 12:22:31 literally impossible
general 2021-08-22 12:22:35 to use
general 2021-08-22 12:23:01 and yet they do need fuel
general 2021-08-22 12:23:07 rocket engines, remember?
general 2021-08-22 12:23:33 yeah no youd get shot
general 2021-08-22 12:23:48 refueling is impossible
creations-chat 2021-08-22 12:24:12 and yet i dig it

general 2021-08-22 14:30:38 if it was silver, sure, but chrome?
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 14:36:26 I haven't seen any Lightning II's yet.
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 14:36:34 And I think that's a pretty cool jet
the-dump 2021-08-22 14:37:00 volume warning
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 14:37:17 ..does that count as an embed fail?
general 2021-08-22 14:37:56 its really not that bad wth yall on about

plane-crazy 2021-08-22 14:38:34 :squint:
general 2021-08-22 14:40:04 y'all want an underrated plane i'll give you an underrated plane, so underrated it's literally a conspiracy theory
general 2021-08-22 14:40:18 the got dam aurora
general 2021-08-22 14:40:31 yeah sr-91 apparently?
general 2021-08-22 14:40:36 i never heard it being called as such though..
general 2021-08-22 14:40:49 
general 2021-08-22 14:40:55 oh you think this is a flyin' dorito?
general 2021-08-22 14:41:00 clearly you havent seen the TR-3B
general 2021-08-22 14:41:21 you know, these
general 2021-08-22 14:41:29 the *actual* doritos
general 2021-08-22 14:42:15 and yet some believe its actually an anti-gravity plane secretly developed by the government like 40 years back <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2021-08-22 14:42:35 actually, i havent ever met genuine conspiracy theorists
general 2021-08-22 14:42:39 ..i think im glad
general 2021-08-22 14:42:51 PFFT
general 2021-08-22 14:43:03 apparently theres a model kit of these
general 2021-08-22 14:43:07 this is the apparent NASA variant
general 2021-08-22 14:43:10 or whatever
general 2021-08-22 14:43:37 its real
general 2021-08-22 14:43:39 100%
general 2021-08-22 14:43:41 definitely
general 2021-08-22 14:45:10 I do honestly doubt anyone TRULY believes in these
general 2021-08-22 14:45:21 its just fun to "roleplay" that these things could exist, I guess?
creations-chat 2021-08-22 14:49:41 is that really necessary
general 2021-08-22 14:52:09 his profile description should explain it all
general 2021-08-22 14:53:10 we don't know how well it'll perform yet now do we
general 2021-08-22 14:53:33 if they find it cool, so be it
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 14:54:50 this video looks..
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 14:54:54 it feels surreal
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 14:55:09 like theyre explaining something that doesnt truly exist
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 14:55:47 1990 apparently
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 14:58:49 huh
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 15:02:52 He ain't wrong
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 15:03:03 ..but my question is about the motorlock?
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 15:03:11 was it necessary, I mean it looks like you could just build it without it too
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 15:03:17 and it'd look exactly the same
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 15:03:40 alright that parts true
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 15:04:12 ooh this a good drawing

general 2021-08-22 15:26:38 roblox is back up wooo
general 2021-08-22 15:29:48 that's one way to do it
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:54:08 I'm kinda concerned about PC2's performance, because of the infinite map.
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:54:22 So bigger plots, more players seem..
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:54:27 ..risky
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:54:46 that is what they would do
general 2021-08-22 20:55:00 In what sense?
general 2021-08-22 20:55:16 Theres quite a lot of explicit content in it so.
general 2021-08-22 20:55:36 duc k
general 2021-08-22 20:55:51 ... There's two, suggestive and gore. Which one.
general 2021-08-22 20:56:08 Dude
general 2021-08-22 20:56:23 its pretty damn common
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:56:45 alright i guess
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:56:50 still kinda concerning though
general 2021-08-22 20:56:55 likewise
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:58:23 Plane Crazy 2
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:59:05 by designing something real cool I suppose?
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:59:48 I wish the map just was seperated into specific sections better rather than being infinite.
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 20:59:56 But yes, it definitely needs the size increase.
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:00:37 theres no way the original will go out of commission just because it has a sequel
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:01:37 He didn't
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:02:00 right
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:02:30 Discord name: scioto, server name: scioto133
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:02:36 notice a difference
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:03:23 okay now im just confus-
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:03:26 oh i see
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:03:31 jesus christ im blind
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:03:48 i thought you're talking about scioto and then i just
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:03:55 ignore rev over here
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:04:04 i realized just too late
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:04:06 pain
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:04:31 clearly i should go to sleep already
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:04:37 😔
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:06:58 i wonder if people just have announcements muted
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:07:03 h m m m n
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:08:14 me neither
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:08:29 although other roblox servers tend to have fake announcements
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:08:38 so maybe, they assumed this would also be one of those
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:09:17 if theres a server im active in i wont let a notification go unnoticed
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:09:22 hopefully that aint just me
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:10:49 well im gonna sleep now so i dont make more stupid mistakes
plane-crazy 2021-08-22 21:10:56 gbye
general 2021-08-23 11:09:49 bungee cords is what you want
general 2021-08-23 11:09:52 not stretchy ropes
general 2021-08-23 11:10:15 ngl i kinda would too
general 2021-08-23 11:12:38 mmm
general 2021-08-23 11:14:56 You know what would be extra cool though?
general 2021-08-23 11:16:38 If ropes, or the now discussed bungee cords were able to be placed like this:
Select the block, place the first part where you want, and now you have to place the other part. Upon doing so the rope/bungee cord would connect to the two pieces and automatically set a default lenght for them, this would also allow placing at slanted angles
general 2021-08-23 11:17:33 bingo

creations-chat 2021-08-23 20:09:19 Why do people downvote that one, exactly? I think it looks REALLY cool.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 20:29:16 Doesn't look like asking for downvotes to me, and this is what they said when first sending the very first image.
Yes they're a bit on the nose with said "smelling downvotes", but again: it's not asking for them.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 20:32:57 Sure.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 20:37:11 honestly i find that specific build funny

creations-chat 2021-08-25 09:15:36 HAHA, TOMMY GUN GO ***BRRRRRT***
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:18:52 Huh, seems like a lot of people in suggestions who use motorlock aren't aware that they can set a specific motor configuration before placing, so that every motor they place has that configuration.
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:19:39 You heard me.
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:19:45 You can configure motors before placing.
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:19:58 Okay, when you select motor.
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:20:04 Look above your block list.
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:20:36 It will show your current selected block is a motor, and right under it..
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 09:20:40 A CONFIGURE TOOL.

general 2021-08-25 10:11:23 Best bet for armor is layered blocks
general 2021-08-25 10:12:00 However I find that beams have same durability as a single 1x1 block, so I'd suggest using 1x1 blocks
general 2021-08-25 10:12:16 Though it's true TNT is indestructible by some things
general 2021-08-25 10:12:33 Not sure
general 2021-08-25 10:12:39 But they should resist cutters
general 2021-08-25 10:12:43 If correct
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 10:13:59 I doubt there would be a beyblade tutorial to begin with

general 2021-08-25 15:31:35 I don't UNDERSTAND
general 2021-08-25 15:32:42 Here's a trick question;
Why is it called "whitename", when their name is black?
general 2021-08-25 15:32:55 Explain this, n e r d s
general 2021-08-25 15:33:10 discord do be lagging a little bit yeah

general 2021-08-25 15:35:22 last time someone pinged rickje by accident and nothing bad happened to him
general 2021-08-25 15:35:25 rickje even said its ok

general 2021-08-25 15:43:05 hooh, cant forget that one! dreadful DLC if i say so myself
general 2021-08-25 15:43:58 hmm i wonder, if i post enough proof that i use light mode over the span of several months, at least once a week.. will PCC grow accustomed to the idea of light mode users living among them
general 2021-08-25 15:44:05 this would be a great social experiment
general 2021-08-25 15:44:44 im not THAT destructive
general 2021-08-25 15:44:53 although since this is pcc we talkin'
