bug-reports 2020-08-07 18:48:38 I dont know if this is a bug or not, but the censoring for the text signs is hasher than the roblox chat filter. 
steps to reproduce: 
type any number and it will censor it.
bug-reports 2020-08-07 18:52:52 like, im trying to do inscriptions on my tank and it is a chore to try to do it with the censoring

[TITLE] - Ability to move individual objects instead of only moving the entire build
[CATEGORY] - Building

[DESCRIPTION] - It would be good to have an option to move objects such as blocks and other parts individually, or in groups, instead of only being able to move the entire build. This would make it easier to correct mistakes, and is quicker than deleting a bunch of blocks and replacing them.

[LINKS TO REFERENCE IMAGES/VIDEOS (optional)] - None
