general 2020-06-23 22:55:57 <@!335599526414909451> so for the events i noticed you said that there are no hover or conveyor engines, im assuming you mean drives? because i can make an propelor that spins with hover thrusters, is that allowed?
general 2020-06-23 23:19:57

general 2020-06-23 23:40:26 <@!435946988559925248> the reason i was wondering is bcuz the hover thruster isnt pushing off the blocks and moving me forwards, its spinning rod with a prop on it

creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:46:59 boby, how are you even this stupid? your argument makes no sense, you say that because some people are to stupid to figure out how to motorlock that all motorlock should be removed, seriously, this sounds like a toddler whining about how something is too hard and that if they cant do it then nobody can, i seriously wonder if you even hear half of the shit that comes out of your own mouth you absolute simple minded idiot
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:50:52 boby, here is the bottom line, if rick says, that its not a bug, then its not a bug, because he is the developer and he says whats a feature and whats not
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:52:32 boby, its not a glitch, if rick says he means for it to stay AS A FEATURE, then its not a glitch, just how stupid are you
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:55:34 hmm, lemme tell you how its trash, ok first off, it looks like absolute shit, it seriously looks like my younger cousin, who is 5 came onto the game and built something random, second, how is it effiecent, there is no effiecency in this game
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:56:26 hold on i gotta show this guy what wouldnt exist if we didnt have motorlock
creations-chat 2020-09-03 22:57:57 guys guys, motors are glitch bcuz they move and thats not fair to things that dont move, we have to remove them
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:05:50 bloby you say you like realistic things right? well what about this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672985768746156074/751214615530176563/unknown.png

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672985768746156074/751215593251930118/unknown.png or this

guess what
im only able to acheive this level of detail with motorlock you dumbshit
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:08:50 boby, its ok to have an opinion, but your opinion is just incorrect
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:09:03 rick even said its a feature
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:10:25 GET EM PURI
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:10:57 ABSOLUTELY CRUSH THIS EMPTY SKULL'D CHILD
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:13:08 puri needs to grind this idiot into idiot dust
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:14:41 boby, you dont seem to understand, that rick wants motorlocking to be in the game
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:14:48 meaning
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:15:06 that if rick wants it in the game, then its obviously not a glitch
creations-chat 2020-09-03 23:19:06 my fucking god, this guy just doesnt listen to anything we are saying, he cant understand, in his little pea sized brain, that because rick WANTS motorlock in the game, it is no longer a bug, its only considered an exploit if the developers dont intend for it to be used like this or they dont like it, but because rick likes it, it is most definitely not a bug <@!502211422718263307>
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 23:20:18 <@!733931029890596943> what do you mean?
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 23:21:02 he said he was going to keep it, a long time ago, are you new?
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 23:21:35 no im talking to imnotsosly
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 23:50:42 he is talking about amount of people that use motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 23:53:21 <@!670939038999511041>
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 23:53:31 do you wanna see what he has been sending me?

creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:00:31 Why is the community upvoting builds that are super low effort and look like garbage?
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:02:25 I will agree that there is block count bias, however, there is some really crappy stuff that ive seen get 30 upvotes
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:02:39 Like that stupid tonk thing
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:03:04 I could quite literally make that in 5 minutes
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:03:52 The panther A isnt great either, however its much better than the tonk
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:04:16 I just dont understand
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:04:57 I want it to go back to when people were posting quality builds and the occasional bad build
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:06:06 Yes thats what i mean
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:06:30 I think the community is just becoming undes
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:07:43 Its fucking annoying
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:07:59 We need a clensing
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:10:09 I think what is happening is the community is split in 2, with one side being the older members and better builders snd the other side being the newer members with build standards lower than the mariana trench
creations-chat 2020-09-21 14:11:05 At this point in time i could post my shitty 5 month old builds and get 70 upvotes

creations-chat 2020-10-05 14:47:58 its extremely hard for me to believe he is seriously working on the game bcuz trapdoors havent even been fixed yet
creations-chat 2020-10-05 14:48:34 cuz yes
creations-chat 2020-10-05 14:49:47 <@!746383586755870821> the problem with waiting for roblox to fix it is that roblox is even slower than rick when it comes to updates, it could be many more months before trapdoors are fixed
creations-chat 2020-10-05 14:50:35 and at that point i would just fix trapdoors with this current version but save the previous code for if they fix it
general 2020-10-05 14:51:46 yed

creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:45:13 Its because of the huge amount of braindead idiots who dont know what a good build is bcuz they cant build well themselves
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:46:18 Its really sad to see a community turned into what we currently have
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:48:40 Well, the og people left bcuz upvotes have no merit anymore, they are guarenteed upcotes if they post something even just average, the new people just upvote everything and its basically ruining the premise of creations

plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:40:42 Hi
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:40:52 😳
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:41:34 Nothing compared to the ammount of unfinished builds i have
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:42:25 Tooti u dont even know, i have a whole account with only unfinished builds on it
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:42:38 Epic
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:42:51 I dont yet
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:43:09 But i also have unfinished buikds spread across accounts
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:43:30 Moment
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:44:13 When have plane crazy's biggest bv238 and still havent finisged even though herr guggi and everyone tells to finish
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:44:34 Pog
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:45:10 The 238 is 6000 blocks and i havent even finished the wings
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:45:20 Or the interior
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:45:47 Constant 6% physics throttle be like
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:47:41 I am currently having a learning spanish and prob never going to use it or go to a spanish speaking country moment
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:48:06 Ive already gotten to 0% with it
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:48:32 Or atleast something similar
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:50:30 It hapoened with an older version, but herr i think, or maybe synth, collided with my 238, and then it pretty much crashed the server with everyone getting about 1 fps. And i couldnt click the despawn button abd then herr or synth yelled at me in discord.
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:50:49 Ah, good times, before the server turned to unde shit
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:51:28 Shut, im on phone cuz im in class and im not great at typing on phone
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:51:49 Epiiiiic
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:52:04 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:52:21 Idk how social people type so fast
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:52:36 Same
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:52:43 I am speed on pc
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:53:09 Yes its tight
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 14:54:21 Ok i should prob start working on spanish work but ill still be looking at channel to see if the interesting happens
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 15:11:01 Not roundy
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 15:11:08 Needs better roundy
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 15:11:37 My trail tank barrel has better roundy than that
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 15:11:54 Moment
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 15:12:10 Show build mode
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 15:12:22 I can help
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 15:13:25 Ok yeah just looks like one of rotating parts isnt fully locked down
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 15:14:18 Thats about as good as i can help rn cuz im not in game to see it lock, but i hope it helps a lil
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 15:15:10 Ye might have jyst missed smth
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 15:17:12 I work with a lot of motorlock and its usually hard to help people who motorlock, bcuz their style is completely different, usually what looks correct to me looks like chaos to other builders
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 15:18:38 And i dont rlly think in individual blocks often, since i make my builds completely motor angled, which makes it harder to help too
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 15:19:13 I would show a picture of what im working on rn, but i dont have a pic saved to my phone
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 15:20:01 K ill do that
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 15:20:59 Online school is done in... 4 hours? Maybe?
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 15:21:30 Yeah i think ill be done in 4 hours, depends on ammount of homework
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 19:35:44 <@!251880826386513924> u online?
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 19:42:27 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 19:42:35 go in vip 2
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 19:42:58 ah nvm
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 19:43:06 go in expert server 1
bot-central 2021-01-07 19:43:32 !expertservers
creations-chat 2021-01-08 17:48:11 Its a bit boxy, not much small details, the colors are a lil plain
creations-chat 2021-01-08 17:50:30 Colors are easy, just make a bit of variation in the blue, make areas where more dirt/exhaust darker or things like that
creations-chat 2021-01-08 17:52:49 Link?
creations-chat 2021-01-08 17:55:03 Im not a fan of the colors, it has too much contrast to be a winter camo, other than that its just a kind of basic looking build.
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:26:02 Hahaha thats so shitty
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:28:03 <@450005202511200256> imagine fucking smooth brain, its not even a real pixel art, you just edited a picture onto ur plot dumbass
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:40:32 The pixel size gave it away? U sure it wasnt the blatant flat edge of the image that gave it away
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:42:56 The fact that people who dont even know what motorlock is have ranks is dissapointing
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:45:19 Bruh, how, i knew about motorlock before i even joined pcc, i think we are just letting in a bunch of tards nowadays
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:48:09 I havent posted anything in this server for a long time cuz it means nothing. Shit builds get 50 upvotes daily. Whats the point in posting here anymore
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:50:49 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/799503584903299072/Cargo_Ship.PNG heres one 52 upvotes for an ugly ass brick they they call a boat
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:52:50 I think one of the last creations i post in this server is gonna be my creation that im going for master aero with.      And then ill prob get banned for calling some autistic kids garbage build a steaming pile of shit
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:54:51 Not the ugliest ship ive seen, the siding is lacking a lot of detail so its kinda meh.        Might just be the grainyness of the image tho
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:56:56 Motorlock is the key to greatness. If you find it disgusting then well.... shows your level of building doesnt it?
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:58:59 Piston lock is better in some situations, but overall yes, it looks better.      Makes it possible to move blocks a qaurter or less.      The piston can move less than half a block what else is there to explain
creations-chat 2021-01-15 19:02:05 The piston locks, then the motorlock releases, the block on the piston is however much higher the piston went than the rest of blocks
creations-chat 2021-01-15 19:05:12 Its really simple to understand...
creations-chat 2021-01-15 19:14:10 English please.      How so

creations-chat 2021-02-11 20:51:08 Confused on how to feel about this, on one hand its above pcc average creation shit, but on the other its rlly plain.        Cant decide, fix up the wing shape and add some color variation and it gets a upvote from me
creations-chat 2021-02-11 20:54:16 Slight color variation, darker underside, darker exhaust area, make just very slight variations
creations-chat 2021-02-11 20:58:46 If i made a zeppelin with 1 color it would look bad right?
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:02:36 Just do some basic shading
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:05:36 Its not, it just makes it look better
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:07:59 Just take a look at Fortune_Foxx's airship, he used color variation and shading, and it looks good. Granted he used a wider color gradient than i would for that plane, but it still shows
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:10:38 Well, thats part of it, but the colors are very monochrome and stale, even just a few number difference would make it look better
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:13:23 Indeed, i fully agree
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:15:26 Pcc went from being mostly upvotes and a few downvotes everyday to, downvote pretty much everything and every once in a blue moon an older player will post. And then i finally upvote
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:17:27 Thats usually what i do except for cases when i see something that could be easily fixed
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:19:38 Make the wings solid and not full of holes, ailerons smaller and more towards the back of the wing, and hide the elevator motors inside the plane
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:21:45 No no no, dont layer the gradient, make it layered but a lil randomized.      <@508065143905845248>  you better watch what you say
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:24:22 I dont post anything cuz it has no merit, i just show the people who i know are good builders and can therefore give me accurate feedback
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:26:31 Not rlly, pcc is full of noobs who dont even know how to piston lock, and most of pcc's good players got banned bcuz of jokes.     Yes, thats why i only show the good players, bcuz people who dont know how to piston lock will just say its good, i see shitty builds getting 70+ upvotes all the time
creations-chat 2021-02-11 21:30:27 I will when i get home, send me a friend request on discord so i can find you again, ive gotta drive home so i cant type

general 2021-02-20 07:59:34 get real
creations-chat 2021-02-22 17:25:49 Colors could be a lil more flush wuth eachother.  Add a lil diff in the cano colors
creations-chat 2021-02-22 17:27:56 Then ur camo was too blue, make the blue a tint, not the other way around.   Your darkest one was too big of s jump from the other colors
creations-chat 2021-03-04 17:25:24 <@664210806543613973> dude, your "tons of motorlock" is literally just the beginner shit motorlock, all you do is put rockets into the plane. You cant say tons of motorlock like that is high effort
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:08:28 It looks like you just took your basic plane, cut it in half so you could seem pro, and then did a rocket tower
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:10:29 It seems to me that you think that is amazing motorlock, but its more like a noob who just found out what motorlock is
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:13:59 Guy who made a trash xp55 saying that he did more than just a rocket tower, even though you could make the exact same plane without any motorlock
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:16:26 You literally just took the lower half of your plane off and motorlocked it. Oh, and im pretty sure you cant make my planes without motorlock
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:19:00 hold on, your saying you have over 28 days playtime, and your builds are still the same as public server builds?  Also phoeni, that tower design is the most common cuz its the basis of all motorlock, it compresses into a 1x3 log of motorlock, making it easy to add stuff to builds
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:21:13 Ok but i doubt you were afk for 20 of those days cuz it seems like you have the skill lvl of 8 actual days
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:26:01 Im saying that for someone who has 28 days playtime you would expect higher quality.      Have you tried to learn how to make more complex things?
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:31:33 Bruh, you post an image with a caption saying "i bet this will get downvoted" and then when people call you out for being shit, you cant handle it? Idk man, seems like a 9 year old thing to do
creations-chat 2021-03-04 19:33:34 Move to plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:34:40 <@323928094132011008> if you have fun by playing with the physics then why do you post things in creations
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:35:20 You obviously havent looked up far enough in creations chat to get what we are talking about
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:36:37 So you havent ever posted something in creations, if thats the case then why would it matter to you whether im calling someone shit for having 28 days playtime
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:37:38 Too late man, you are die
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:38:08 TIME FOR KILL
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:38:25 Oh man
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:38:32 If i was at home rn
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:38:48 I would actually just mentally fucking destroy him
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:39:23 Unfortunately, it seems that guy is on an alt
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:40:16 Pc worst nightmare is someome eith copy bots, that they can send to servers
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:40:40 The alt copy it, then he copy his alt
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:41:13 Can they copy a build not in your plot
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:41:46 If they can copy your saves without you spawning them then im bot gonna risk it
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:41:49 But if not
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:42:04 Then just clear your autosave and ur fine
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:42:17 Puny
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:42:44 My forgotten bv 238 is nearly 6k
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:42:56 And i still havent finished it
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:43:06 Cuz i lost motivation for it
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:43:35 Same
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:43:58 Bv isnt even finisged in build
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:44:27 Its ok man
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:44:40 Were u in public or vip?
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:47:06 Its almost instant copy
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:47:29 Ye but nobody is that fast
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:50:31 For me, its not that big of a concern honestly, my builds use the entire keyboard to be able to work
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:25:55 Its not supposed to be stolen
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:26:24 Its there so we dont have to deal with public server garbage
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:27:16 Its not stuffing. Its a choice to play on a vip with other presumably good players
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:28:11 Or just play on your own vip server and only invite people you want to play with
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:29:36 My god. Half the people are like HoW gEt In ViP sErVeR
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:31:10 Most of the good players on this server got banned for jokes, not a lot of good players left
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:32:08 The new generation of players is actual trash
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:33:10 Honestly, i would prob put you guys in the mid-new players group
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:33:21 Cuz ive only seen you guys recently
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:34:32 Its kinda meant to be like that so the people at the same skill lvl play together
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:35:42 Thats why literally dont ever play on these vip servers anymore, there just arent a lot of players anymore who actually can understand what im building and my mindset
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:37:21 No, the creator released it to the public
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:37:41 The people on redit are praising him like he is a god

general 2021-03-23 12:31:01 Indeed, a physics simulator at its finest
general 2021-03-23 12:31:34 Wings dont even create natural lift, only drag
general 2021-03-23 12:31:48 Thats how pro the game is
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:33:40 Use hover drives, hide them inside the engine
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:34:00 Hover drives are prob the best propulsion
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:34:15 As far as control goes
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:34:37 Oh god no
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:34:41 Not magnet
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:35:12 Hover drive is better, more versitile, u make hover drives, hover engines
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:35:27 Ive made a coaxxial out of hover engine
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:36:09 No
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:36:15 Pain in the ass
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:36:44 How bout rick just give back my physics throttle

plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:40:50 I see that all the time
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:41:32 Why even motorlock if you arent gonna take it the whole way snd do what i do, make a plane completely out of trails that are angled by motors
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:42:15 Ok and?
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:42:31 Im working on he 162 rn
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:42:42 And tail section is very pro
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:42:52 Kinda
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:43:00 Its mostly drag
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:43:27 Its just the outside if the plane
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:45:12 Real
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 12:46:17 collisions between diff creations is very sketchy

creations-chat 2021-04-19 15:11:12 With autoloader.   That i had to make for him cuz he is noobish.   I think he will lose, flying dutchman has 19 below deck cannons on 1 side
creations-chat 2021-04-19 15:13:23 I have prob 10 shots per cannon.    It doesnt fly cuz its not meant to fly, it doesnt fly. The flyong part is meant to mean how fast it is

general 2021-04-23 14:37:33 Shut up
general 2021-04-23 14:38:26 Ye i know, i cant find any of my old posts either
general 2021-04-23 14:39:14 I literally cant find it, think they did something with creations a while back
general 2021-04-23 14:39:42 Ye
creations-chat 2021-04-23 19:51:02 Yeah. I can show how after i get home.yeah they work only downside is you cant use 1x1 cylinders on tight edges, cuz they slip thru the gaps
creations-chat 2021-04-23 19:53:34 Thx
creations-chat 2021-04-23 19:56:40 Just wait a while
creations-chat 2021-04-23 19:59:31 Planes do not look good. Watch as argument starts
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:04:14 What
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:06:17 Those wings actually pain me.   Also are those flaps.   Why didnt you just angle the wings, it looks rlly bad like that
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:09:11 Wdym by wow guy.   You gonna answer?
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:15:10 Ok, so why did you say hater guy.   So im a hater bcuz i said ur wings were nasty? I mean i guess but if you cant take critisizm then you shouldnt post
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:20:01 I dont have anything posted because i havent posted recently, the community went to shit and now everything gets easy upvotes. Also the last time i posted was so long ago that it was before you coukd send directly in creations, so you have to search for mentions of me in creations to find them
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:23:16 Exactly, thats why i use commas whether i write a essay or not.
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:26:25 Ok listen, first off, im saying use commas to show what you are actually trying to say, it is quite easy to misunderstand a sentance with no commas. Second, you are probably one of the last people anyone will listen to seeing as you have no rank and probably just joined.   It doesnt have to be a perfectly made sentance, just one thst you can get the feeling of.
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:29:41 If you dont understand commas then that is your own problem, do not harp on people who use commas to express emotion, especially since it is quite common.   Also how was i meant to understand that him just saying "hater guy" is a joke.
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:31:52 When did i ever try to make fun of someone for not knowing english. Im pretty sure what i did is say that it is your own issue if you dont know what commas are
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:38:27 Not specifically talking about you, talking about the other guy who is trying to justify his ignorance of the english language in an english only server
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:41:14 Dont joke about a dead family member, thats disgusting
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:43:24 If you would have joked about my uncle you would hope i never find your adress. And i saw the image, he said his mom was dead, and then you continued. Sorry is there a whitename talking?
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:45:57 Expert designer isnt that much of a flex... you know that right?
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:50:39 Yes, you quoted me, good job i guess, idk what point you are trying to prove here
creations-chat 2021-04-23 20:52:43 Whitenames dont get any respect because they are newer players, and they dont have a rep, other than being a whitename
creations-chat 2021-04-26 14:31:48 Looks like shit my guy
creations-chat 2021-04-26 14:39:08 Doodoo fart stinky plane.   If ur gonna do a complex camo, then use wedges do we dont have to see the blockyness
creations-chat 2021-04-26 15:57:11 Looks like a hollowed out shit
creations-chat 2021-04-26 19:47:42 Terrible.   That is quite bad.   Why do the guns look like that, why is the paint so disgusting.
creations-chat 2021-04-26 19:50:18 It really does look like a 30 min build. A 30 min build except its really bad. You THINK it looks to green? Dumbass it looks like an algea covered lake
creations-chat 2021-04-26 19:54:48 Yes, dont post trash in creations or creations feedback.   Bro look at any of the guns, they look terrible
creations-chat 2021-04-26 19:57:05 Basically, look at an average build, and then compare it to your own build, you can tell its bad. Also im going to be like this to most people in this server cuz most everyone makes shit
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:00:17 So basically, you are bad at making anchores so you just didnt make one.   Tardis thats the point
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:06:11 So basically, its this thing that keeps a ship in place, i misspelled it because im on my phone right now, sorry that you couldnt understand a simple spelling mistake. But it might help a little to pay attention in school and make inferences based on context.
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:08:35 When did i write the bible you dumbfuck. And do you seriously not know what an anchor is?
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:11:00 Is that your only response? Nice
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:13:01 A new angle does not make it any less shit
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:17:11 Delete it and make something new, its worth -500 quid
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:19:59 Your opinion is so unpopular that the north korean government is deciding to execute you despite your love for kim
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:25:29 Lemme see, first of all, it looks like a bean with a flagpole on it, second the paint is so atrocious it makes anyone who sees it immediately angry, third, the fact you actually think its good makes me think this community is somehow getting worse. You think that it looks good, but it looks so ugly that i literally hate it with ever essence of my being.
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:27:31 If they are anything like THAT then no, they are quite possibly some of the worst
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:31:41 Its as bad as i thought, unpost that please, it hurts my eyes
creations-chat 2021-04-26 20:35:27 Its true tho. Im sorry but i feel no mercy for that idiot. Just scroll up
creations-chat 2021-04-27 12:10:18 I only talk shit to people that need to be talked to
creations-chat 2021-04-27 12:13:02 If ur creation is so bad, that i, who hasnt posted anything in creations for over a year, has responded, then it needs fixing or deletion
creations-chat 2021-04-27 12:16:42 Indeed its already half done

plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:23:15 True
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:24:59 Wip he 162
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:25:23 Im takin a break cuz the nose is literally eating my sanity
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:26:13 Might have to pistonlock each motor, i may collapse
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:26:46 Pixel measurements say nosecone is 1.5 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:27:05 Cry
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:27:33 This is mostly why i dont post in pcc
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:27:39 I cant get feedback
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:27:46 People dont do this
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:29:14 Ye but again, literally nobody ive seen has done angling like this, and most of the people who do, got banned, thats why i post in another server
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:29:43 Yeah? And im right
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:31:06 I helped cad a while ago with his floatplane
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:31:24 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:31:38 I helped with his prop and engine design
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:32:28 Its not that, its that creations isnt accurate in what is good and what isnt
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:32:59 I see absolute dogshit get 90 upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:33:22 And then whats even the point in posting anymore
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:35:46 Thats why i say new pcc is shit, there have been a few good people to come along since the great explosion in pcc population (namnaam, and a few others) but most of who i actually converse with, is old pcc members who either left from pcc getting bad, or getting banned for a bad joke
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:36:08 No
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:36:12 Not jay
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:36:31 Jay is not on my respecto list
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:37:31 Im talkin people like synth
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:37:46 Synth is good with paints
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:38:06 But he never finished HIS RUNWAY TANK
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:39:02 Then again, i cant talk, ive had my bv238 unfinished for over a year now, and im still saying that ill finish it someday
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:39:52 About 2.5 plots in length
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:40:01 3.5 in wingspan
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:41:55 Me?
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:42:01 O
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:42:09 Its fine
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:48:05 The only way would be to use hover engines
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:49:24 But i wouldnt consider it till we get our fucking PHYSICS LAG UPDATE
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:50:55 K
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:51:15 I got 70 % in my 6k block bv238
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:51:21 It was amazing
plane-crazy 2021-04-27 12:51:58 Ok now i class time
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:17:12 You see, they just dont like *your*  sailboat. Oh god, i was gonna say it wasnt the worst ive seen, but then you posted an image from the back
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:19:19 Was it posted in plabe crazy, or just a build in the game. If it was just a build then u cant report it, no in game moderation
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:21:21 Its just fuckin flat. His sailboat
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:23:22 I said the back. Also, again with the +100 toxicity, shut the fuck up, if me saying their build is bad is me being toxic then how is anybody supposed to give critisizm, if you cant say, that is bad, then they wont fix it
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:27:12 First off all, you boat is high off the water, second, the back should narrow a lil, third the image that you posted isnt even flat, it has a hole in it. Im gonna say it plain and simple, it doesnt look good
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:31:24 Delete it and retry.   Im literally just saying they are bad.   Stop making 3 wheeled cars, they dont look good
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:34:23 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/686788994507210766/822532143351463996/unknown.png also considering i build entire planes out of trails, yes, i prob would have high standards. But i wasnt the only one who said delete it, so why are you only going after me?
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:36:26 No duh shitass, im talking about the fusulage
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:38:37 I literally started using the advanced angling techniques extensively 
 even before guggi.  The one i have is that image, im taking a break from it cuz im going to have to pistonlock all the front trails and im lazy
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:03:45 The tail is made of trails
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:06:51 Start the fusulage over. Basically, it doesnt look like it at all. So delete and start over
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:10:19 Indeed, have you ever tried this thing called,looking at blueprints?
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:12:26 So you looked at them, did you build your plane off those blueprints. Send the blueprints you are using
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:14:28 Send the blueprint you are using. Thats not a blueprint dumbass. No wonder it looks wrong, you dont have any sense of scale
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:17:42 You are supposed to use blueprints to get you scale, length and width, measurements basically. A 3d model is for getting angles on the plane correct, so finer detail. So first find a bluepri t. Seriously, find one.   K send it
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:20:07 Send it. Dude, literally just search blueprints of ur plane, then go to images
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:22:53 K, so right away you should be able to tell whats different between ur original and the blueprint.   Urs was a pencil, the blueprint shows that it widens out at the end of the plane
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:24:54 Yes, look at the blueprint, do you see how it widens out. Box person.   Im not sure what wedges you should use, since i would just use motor angling
help 2021-04-27 16:27:23 Dude thats just the start
help 2021-04-27 16:27:55 I cant go into detail cuz lunch is almost over, but im just gonna say its all pretty damn bad my guy
creations-chat 2021-04-27 16:28:10 Prob not
creations-chat 2021-04-27 20:10:45 Ok so wait, you are supposedly 13, but you dont know what wip means.  Somethings off here.
general 2021-04-29 12:22:00 The
general 2021-04-29 12:22:18 Yellow role, amaze
creations-chat 2021-04-29 14:28:30 These guys, slightly idiot perhaps.  Pepsi that was me being tame. Every person responding to eryay saying f22 is a fucking idiot
creations-chat 2021-04-29 14:32:18 Yes, all ww2 era fighters were the same layout, front engined, large front wing, cockpit behind wing, and vertical and horizontal stabilizers in the back
general 2021-04-29 14:36:39 Fixed?
general 2021-04-29 14:37:03 Shut up understale pfp
general 2021-04-29 14:37:38 How much better
general 2021-04-29 14:37:56 What physics %?
bot-central 2021-04-29 22:33:56 !servers
creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:24:35 So basically ur saying, because its low effort and idiots cant understand anything more complicated than a block. Ok good thing we can agree that this community is shit
creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:26:36 Its not hard to, you are just incompetent. Yes rbk, that is what i said
creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:30:57 Pcc members trying to figure out that your name in the server isnt your discord username.  Literally braindead
creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:36:18 Fix ur terrible creations. Rbk, for once im actually not, this guy deserves to be bullied, if you think im toxic then you havent seen this guy
creations-chat 2021-04-30 14:39:43 Yes, thats how i give feedback, and again, this guy is worse
creations-chat 2021-04-30 16:05:18 I dont think im the best pcc player, i just think that people could use their brains just a little bit more and build stuff like they actually have the brain of a 13 year old, yes i realise that nobody is going to build out of trails like i do, i dont expect that, i just expect to see something better than a below average public pvp build getting 100 upvotes, or a 9 block boat getting 100 upvotes. Me saying "that build is bad" is still feedback, i use feedback like that because guess what, most things i comment on are things that look like they were made by my younger cousin, who is the age of 7
creations-chat 2021-04-30 16:08:30 Would have responded earlier to the argument, but i was in class.
creations-chat 2021-04-30 16:10:34 That was me responding to someone saying that making 3 blade props is hard, so he never asked for feedback.   Also saying that build is bad is feedback, its letting them know that their build is not good and needs to be better
creations-chat 2021-04-30 16:13:28 Yes, my standards are high, but if i were to actually see something atleast a lil above public server levels i would consider not downvoting it.  But unfortunately, thats all i see these days, shitty builds with low effort and lots of upvotes for no reason.   No, i dont judge like that, i judge based on first of all, if it looks good, and second, if i can tell that there was actual effort put into it
creations-chat 2021-04-30 16:16:20 Who is pyro. Prob dont know cuz i stopped caring about pcc a year ago after huge influx of hive mind 9 year olds who think shredder bugs are cool.  After that i lost hope in pcc, cuz the community turned to shit
creations-chat 2021-04-30 16:20:06 <@466793357318815744> OMG OMG COMRADEALX IS BEING A BIG MEANIE TO A NEW PLAYER WARN HIM RIGHT NOW
creations-chat 2021-04-30 16:23:10 This is literally what happened to me an hour ago
creations-chat 2021-04-30 16:27:30 Bruh, you say people mass downvote? If they mass downvote then ur build must be terrible, i saw a 9 block boat get 120 upvotes earlier and it prob took 5 mins to build
creations-chat 2021-04-30 19:33:27 If it isnt equal then u must be doing something wrong. Is the torque at max?
creations-chat 2021-04-30 19:54:16 Step 1, the landing gear is connecting and it isa piston used for suspension, step 2, you are dumb
creations-chat 2021-04-30 19:56:34 First of all, what the fuck are you talkin about with motor 2, second, its a piston you blithering idiot
creations-chat 2021-04-30 19:59:38 I think, pepsi, that this guy may or may not be competent enough to understand and observe with his eyes
creations-chat 2021-04-30 20:04:59 I didnt say he was, but i also didnt say he wasnt. There isnt a problem with the bottom of his do 335
creations-chat 2021-04-30 20:07:01 The urge to say something about that specific image, you are very lucky pepsi is watching. IM GONNA DO IT, IM GONNA SAY SOMETHING
creations-chat 2021-04-30 20:11:05 All the tanks in that image are so shit that it makes me physically hurt looking at them, its actually appalling looking at that image, you can even tell with the black abd white that the tanks are just solid colors, the fact you have friends that shitty and uncapable of using a single percent of their brains to make something is quite depressing and i quite honestly wish i could unsee that shithole of a gathering
creations-chat 2021-04-30 20:13:06 Cuz its just a flying square with copy and paste "mechs"
creations-chat 2021-04-30 20:15:07 Thats pretty cool i think
creations-chat 2021-04-30 20:18:17 Its getting downvotes cuz his mothership is a flat square, no attempt to make an actual creation.
creations-chat 2021-04-30 20:21:01 Hes just a trol hars
creations-chat 2021-04-30 20:26:42 4% HARS
creations-chat 2021-05-04 19:05:29 Undertale pfp.   Cringe
creations-chat 2021-05-04 19:23:29 Toxic, you are saying we are toxic because we downvoted?
creations-chat 2021-05-04 19:30:06 LOOOOOO THE UNDERTALE PFP UPVOTED IT HAHAHAHA, HIS STANDARDS MUST BE AT A NEW LOW FOR PCC.   Dude, im not being mean, im literally saying that your build isnt good my guy, you could put hours of effort into it but if it looks like that, im gonna downvote it, you see, i dont judge based on effort, i judge based on looks, so if it looks bad, im gonna downvote
creations-chat 2021-05-04 19:33:38 Its as simple as that <@839144467926876252>
creations-chat 2021-05-04 19:35:40 Looks more like a 100 block black and cyan brick that floats. I mean you've gotta try harder than that if u want upvotes, i mean, you are 13 right? Start acting like it and build something that looks like a 13 year old made it instead of something my 7 year old cousin made
creations-chat 2021-05-04 19:38:35 That would get a downvote from me. First, ur landing gear, do i rlly have to go into detail about it? Second, ur intake walls are thicker than ur wings. Third, ur wings have holes in them
creations-chat 2021-05-04 19:41:08 HES true
creations-chat 2021-05-04 19:43:25 1) yes you can, just use your brain a little.
2) if you really cant think of any other idea, then you have a skill issue
3) i can literally see thru them... wtf are you talking about
creations-chat 2021-05-05 16:14:38 of course I downvoted it, its 1 solid color, you cant tell where the hull starts and the bridge begins, try experimenting a little with colors, because making the entire ship 1 color doesnt look good
general 2021-05-05 16:23:22 ok noob
creations-chat 2021-05-05 17:30:29 HES TRUE
creations-chat 2021-05-05 17:32:51 not originally made by herr guggi, i made those treads a full 2 months before he even made his test, and herr guggi keeps trying to say that they were made by me originally, i swear to god, learn to fucking read
creations-chat 2021-05-05 17:39:41 well you see, herr guggi has said, multiple times even, that it was not originally him, you may not have made the image, but you still posted it
bot-central 2021-05-06 01:06:54 !servers
creations-chat 2021-05-06 02:19:03 the legs could definitely be shaped better, and the body could be modeled better. other than that its not bad, but it just isnt an appealing build
creations-chat 2021-05-06 02:23:04 ok, thanks for not starting an argument like literally everybody else that asks me for feedback
creations-chat 2021-05-06 02:25:04 first, what even is that.      HES TRUE
creations-chat 2021-05-06 02:27:16 ok dude, the cockpit is supposed to stick out of the fuselage, not meld together like that. that doesnt look good tho....
creations-chat 2021-05-06 02:30:25 HES TRUE
creations-chat 2021-05-06 12:38:07 The simple fix would be balast at the bottom and helium above the balast, i had the same problem with my alluette, and the problem is called dissymetry of lift, for more info on what ut is just search it up, you will understand whats happening, the way i fixed it was with small props inside the heli that could be powered to keep it level. So i have my main wasd qe controls, and i also have tfgh controls for fine movement
creations-chat 2021-05-06 12:40:50 It works, but it makes the flight seem so cartoonish that its not even fun. Did you look up what dyssemytry of lift is?
creations-chat 2021-05-06 12:43:40 Another simple fix, this one might not be possible, but its to decrease blade angle, a lot, and just have it spin fastee. The way dyssemytry of lift works is the advancing blade will get more lift, and the retreating blade will get less, thats why it will roll when you move forward
creations-chat 2021-05-06 12:45:59 Irl helis counter it with auto gyros. Which isnt rlly possible
creations-chat 2021-05-06 16:14:17 Rudy. You.    Imagine crying over a downvote and then wanting me to get warned for downvoting creations that i dont like
creations-chat 2021-05-06 16:18:57 <@462891443673890827> imagine
creations-chat 2021-05-06 16:25:25 All of it my guy, all of it
creations-chat 2021-05-06 16:28:17 Hes true. Looks like you tried to grab upvotes by adding unnecisary motorlock
creations-chat 2021-05-06 19:25:13 Ok, i dont judge based on how long it took, and so what if im the only person that downvoted it, that means you cried about a single downvote
creations-chat 2021-05-06 19:30:54 Real
creations-chat 2021-05-06 19:34:23 Its literally only 1 color. Theres barely any fine detail. The turrets look like actual trash
creations-chat 2021-05-06 20:21:00 You cant if you have my username. Or atleast thats what rudy and solee think.  I have a feeling they just dont like me
creations-chat 2021-05-06 20:23:01 Ok here mat, add weathering, your creation shouldnt look like 1 solid color. Add slight color changes throughout the ship, so have your basic color and then a color just a few numbers off, the psint near the bottom of the ship shoukd be slightly darker than the top
creations-chat 2021-05-06 20:25:25 No
creations-chat 2021-05-06 20:31:40 Like i said, add a slight color variation, so make a color similar to the 1 u have now, and randomly apply it on ur ship. And add a slightly darker variation of ur main color near the botton. Its hard to explain to a person that doesnt know paint techniques
creations-chat 2021-05-06 20:35:14 Also send an image of what it looks like rn
creations-chat 2021-05-06 20:37:44 Fusulage, not hull
creations-chat 2021-05-06 20:39:46 Apply darker color *randomly* near the bottom. It shouldnt look like a second waterline
creations-chat 2021-05-06 20:42:08 Yes kinda like that, now use a darker color for the grey
creations-chat 2021-05-07 11:54:33 FUNNY
general 2021-05-07 12:15:33 Kill
creations-chat 2021-05-07 12:22:31 Make the lines out of delta wing panels.   Fuck it, make the whole ship outa trails
creations-chat 2021-05-07 12:24:51 Wdym how, you motorlock the delta wings into the deck
creations-chat 2021-05-07 12:30:49 Prob just a single motorlock
creations-chat 2021-05-07 12:33:05 Dont listen to kookie, he is the german speedbumb that people call belgium.    Wtf are you talking about kookie, im over 50% german
creations-chat 2021-05-07 12:36:52 Prepare for rating.   It looks like shit, why is it a solid color of green, literally the ugliest color u could find.   You asked for rating, dont try to defend urself
general 2021-05-09 01:24:06 not gonna be named cado 2 when it happens, we dont like synth
general 2021-05-09 01:24:43 cuz i said his decision was a bad one, and synth is chinese govmt, i mean just look at this

creations-chat 2021-05-10 16:08:02 Elevators are meh, motorlock them inside the plane so you dont see the motor. Other than that its ok, would prob try to cover the space under the rudders a bit more

creations-chat 2021-05-11 12:56:54 What im saying, is that there is 0 color difference in his hull. And also that he cried over a single downvote
creations-chat 2021-05-11 14:17:51 Trust me, this community is so dumb, someone would upvote
creations-chat 2021-05-11 14:25:11 Basically, restart the wings, unless u want ur wings to look like paper

creations-chat 2021-05-11 19:49:24 Why dont u just make the plane out of trails<:trollface:775024642104229898>.  Obtain realism
creations-chat 2021-05-11 19:51:47 Its not even that hard, it just takes 20 mins longer than the average pcc player attention span. And thats why i never see it, until the day when i see something in pcc that truly amazes me, there will be no upvotes.   Start cryin.  Too bad if you think my standards are too high, continue to cry over your single downvote
creations-chat 2021-05-11 19:55:07 Shut up fartwrangler.  Theres a no rank in chat, come back when you have... hmmmmm...... a role<:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2021-05-11 20:26:03 Pepsi, am i right in my assumption?
general 2021-05-11 20:28:31 A no rank has entered the chat, with public server level builds most likely
general 2021-05-11 20:29:52 Then again, that isnt saying much considering most builds in creations are below public server standards
general 2021-05-11 20:33:24 Swedish salmon, more like, nvm i cant say that
general 2021-05-11 20:34:18 Unfunny
creations-chat 2021-05-11 20:35:25 True, everybody hates me bcuz they cant handle a single downvote.   Dude thats literally just double wishbone, also ur terrible at hiding motorlock
creations-chat 2021-05-11 20:37:55 Wtf are you talking about IR scope thingy.   Ill tell you what to improve on emir, first off, relable them as average seats, xuz thats all they are
creations-chat 2021-05-11 23:05:20 You and rudy wanted to get me a warn bcuz i downvoted ur creations
creations-chat 2021-05-11 23:58:02 No, he is right, you are wrong, the armor is angled so it diverts more energy in another direction other than thru the armor
creations-chat 2021-05-12 00:01:05 I doubt that
creations-chat 2021-05-13 12:43:01 First of all, it seems to be leaking something blue, oh wait that's just terrible rockets, use hover drives, second your pitch motors are very clearly visible. Also your wings are like cheese graters. Finally someone who can take criticism
creations-chat 2021-05-13 12:45:04 Yeah also that use wedges to fix that up
creations-chat 2021-05-13 12:51:49 To an extent
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:13:09 When plane crazy "13 year olds" see a block with wheels on it: omg omg its so good im going to upvote.   This is literally all of creations rn
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:18:02 Not even close to the truth? Obviously you are one of the people that is upvoting everything. Also, its true, saw a shitty plane, with shitty camo, and absolutely unnecicarily massive, with 200 upvotes. It makes no sense.   Xfinity, im not complaining about my builds not getting upvotes, i stopped posting long long ago, im saying this community's sense of what is good and what is bad is literally that of a public server
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:22:31 Yup...... lunyro, im not saying i base my judgement on how long it took, to me, that plane up there looks like shit, so i downvoted. Im saying that you people, think that shit, looks rlly good
creations-chat 2021-05-13 16:26:54 Yes, but the standards have lowered a lot, that is the point i am making. Prefered the way it used to be, where i wouldnt constantlt see public server builds in creations
creations-chat 2021-05-13 19:40:26 Actual idiocy, it looks like crap.    I wonder why, maybe its because builds these days are literally a fucking ***M I C R O    W A V E***
creations-chat 2021-05-13 19:42:46 Its not hard to see why i downvote, everything in this server is shit.   Including your shitty microwave.  You see, the difference is that he has a rank, unlike you.
creations-chat 2021-05-13 19:45:29 <@725358947904651335>  you have been in the server how long? A month maybe? You have absolutely 0 respect as a person who has just recently joined and is a shit builder. So stop talking you insignificant shithead.
creations-chat 2021-05-13 19:47:31 Im assuming you looked at my latest post in creations?   Shows how much ypu know joshua, the last time i posted was back when the bot posted builds in creations
creations-chat 2021-05-13 19:50:25 So then im guessing you saw my plane made of trails, and my half finished zeppelin. Joshua, how stupid are you, did you literally not see me say that a bot used to post creations
creations-chat 2021-05-13 19:53:30 You might actually be mentally impaired, here lemme try to explain this in the way a toddler such as yourself can understand, that was the only way you could post back then.  Indeed. Never said i was the best, i said you guys are shit, but i never said i am the best
creations-chat 2021-05-13 19:55:48 Go ahead, try to quote me on when i said that i am the best builder. Out of context
creations-chat 2021-05-13 19:58:29 Yes. Ive already agreed that i said peoples builds are trash, but i dont think im the best, i know people who are better.
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:03:47 I literally never said that nobody is better..... i said you guys are trash, im not gonna keep repeating, you are literally making false claims that can be easily disproven.  Provide a qoute, go ahead. Find a qoute where i said that nobody is a better builder than me
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:08:35 Where did i say i was the best
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:10:36 You still havent provided a quote where i said im the best
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:12:45 ^agree, it started with some person who has been in the server for a month crying over a downvote from me. This entire argument has basically been me explaining why i think 99% of the server is trash builders, and then people who dont like me trying to say that i did something i didn't
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:21:57 Yes, i would agree, there are people who are better than me, fortune being one of them, but im pretty sure that as a person who has been playing this game for years, seen the community fall into the shithole that it is now, has had credit stolen many, many times, befriended many of the best builders I've seen, had respectable people asking for help and feedback from me, that i have quite a knowledgable database of what is a "good" and "bad" build
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:28:22 Listen lunyro, i wouldnt be such a "mass downvoter" if yours, and most other builds werent public pvp level builds. If i didn't have to see daily shit, then yes, i would prefer that, atleast pcc could be respectable again
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:31:34 Exactly. Lunyro is probably mad that he got a downvote from me and now he is just trying to get back at me
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:33:43 Again, i wouldnt downvote every build if they werent bad, what you are basically saying here, is that because i dont like any builds i am automatically toxic
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:36:08 Yes, im probably toxic in that regard, but when you watch a good community fall apart and crumble into standards so low you dont even know if its better than public servers, its gonna make you feel no mercy or pity
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:38:33 Saying "i have good builds" with no rank or backing is probably the most egotistical thing you can do
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:41:03 Like i said, i feel no remorse, it shouldnt be that my first build ever posted looks better than half the stuff people post nowadays
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:44:28 Would have been shorter if these guys can just aknowledge that i dont like their builds and deal with it like most people
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:48:57 <@419477639229865984> You see, mega, everyone has their opinions, my opinion is that pcc is shit now, if you dont like it, then you can shut up and ignore it, but by you trying to say that my opinion is bad, and your opinion is good, that is you just trying to silence someone who doesnt agree witg you. Also who the fuck even is pyro
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:50:58 Oh boo hoo you got a downvote, waa waa, oh no i cant believe zach downvoted my build because he thought it was bad, waaaa waaaaa, im gonna go complain about it in creations feedback
creations-chat 2021-05-13 20:53:01 Literally just tell people that im not mass downvoting. I just dont like the creations, and if they dont like that i think none of their creations are good, then too bad. Incredible

creations-chat 2021-05-14 20:09:51 How is that even possible, i woke up at 6 am, and rn its 15:00
creations-chat 2021-05-17 12:33:57 I have entered the chat. Hmmmmmm, who do i insult today.
creations-chat 2021-05-17 12:35:59 I dont think it looks good. (It has started<:trollface:775024642104229898> ).  When the, i give reasons for why i downvote, but people still call me mass downvoter
creations-chat 2021-05-17 12:49:05 Imagine thinking I'm mass downvoter when i literally gave a reason for downvotes. 95% of the time i say i simply do not like what they made
creations-chat 2021-05-17 12:53:41 I wouldnt downvote a lot if the creations had 5 more minutes of actual thought put into it
creations-chat 2021-05-17 14:09:47 Ye, i upvoted a lot of stuff, just nothing recently.... its more just dissapointing than anything else. Fortune_foxx's zeppelin was one of them
creations-chat 2021-05-17 14:13:43 Ye, and then the problem with that is when i am polite about it, some no rank with an ego the size of a truck comes in and says i have no right to critisize. Therefore, i have no need to be polite if the community is a bunch of "13" year olds with egos to big
creations-chat 2021-05-17 14:15:56 That sounds like a terrible idea, ive seen stuff that people say they spent days on, but it looked like it was from a public server
creations-chat 2021-05-17 14:18:44 HerrGuggi is typing...    hestrue
creations-chat 2021-05-17 14:22:26 Wouldnt be that bad if the fusulage was not full of holes and things protruding, and also if the wings were smooth and didnt have that jagged edge
creations-chat 2021-05-17 16:21:30 Ever heard of this thing called motorlock?  That literally everyone uses.  Actually stupid, motorlock is literally 1x3, if you cant fit it, then there might be something wrong with you
creations-chat 2021-05-17 16:25:54 Im not gonna be polite to people who call me a mass downvoter. Also if you cant figure or how to do Motorlock then cmon, really? You can't say you don't have enough space, it's literally compacting blocks, i made a 1 wide plane with motorlock, so don't even try to say you don't have enough space
creations-chat 2021-05-17 16:28:04 If by mass downvoting, you mean downvoting builds that i dont like, same as everyone else, then yes, i mass downvote
creations-chat 2021-05-17 16:30:27 Im literally not, i just downvote and then people say "why did you downvote" i respond with why i dont like it,  then people say I'm mass downvoter, most of the time, i dont say anything about creations unless im asked for why i downvote

help 2021-05-17 20:23:32 Is speed ur problem, like sps, or does it just look like its flying slow
creations-chat 2021-05-17 20:26:21 Now watch, as rbk doesnt try to explain that you are rude and toxic, because he has double standards
creations-chat 2021-05-17 20:29:41 90% of the people in this server are like that, i see people with only designer and their egos are fucking massive. And then i get berated for downvoting some shitty truck and plane. The entire community saying im a mass downvoter, even tho i explained that i simply dont like the builds
creations-chat 2021-05-17 20:31:41 Would you like to explain how i have double standards?
creations-chat 2021-05-17 20:36:22 Most of the time im polite to begin with, unless its just really really bad, and at that point its just me saying what everyone is thinking. It's only when people are calling me a mass downvoter for no reason and saying i should be warned for something like that(solee and rudy) that im going to be rude. Other than that i just downvote and everone goes on their way, theres no need to complain about a single downvote
creations-chat 2021-05-17 20:40:58 Also, when somebody asks for feedback from me on a rlly bad build that wouldnt get an upvote from me, what else am i supposed to say except delete and restart.
creations-chat 2021-05-17 20:43:28 First, that gap in ur wings, can be fixed with motorlock, next, so can the elevators, looks like cheese grater, next, the camo is blocky, other than that not bad
creations-chat 2021-05-17 20:47:44 Its these little things that earn downvotes from me, things that i know are easy fixes. Name one BQ_nk
creations-chat 2021-05-17 20:51:13 Go ahead, name one. Ill disprove tou right now, ill start with the fact you said "really good shit" this would imply that everyone has the same standards and that your standards are the correct ones. This is where you are wrong, for you see, other people, have other opinions, mind blown right?
creations-chat 2021-05-17 21:01:26 <@386274857668706314> would you stop being a keyboard warrior for 5 seconds and shut the fuck up? All you do is say the same thing "you downvote everything" even though ive disproved this numerous times, the fact you won't accept that i just have high standards and go on with your life is annoying. And the more you keep saying "he downvotes good builds" the more i want to punch your face in. Try learning that there is a world where someone might not agree with you and get over it.
creations-chat 2021-05-17 21:08:14 people when i downvote a build that is apparently "illegal" to downvote: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/843957614302855238/804439412497973278.gif
creations-chat 2021-05-17 21:10:47 EXACTLY. GOOD JOB, YOU ARE DESCRIBING WHAT IVE BEEN SAYING FOREVER.
creations-chat 2021-05-17 21:29:15 it seems odd to me that you cant accept that i just have high standards. just because you don't see anything in creations rn that i have upvoted, does not mean that i don't upvote. i never said, this is good and this is bad, you have to agree. i don't start arguments simply because i want to, i only respond to other people. the only thing i have done, is state my opinion, call you a spoiled brat that has trouble coping with a world with other opinions, and downvoted builds that i don't like. what have you done? you have claimed i am something i am not(a mass downvoter), you have claimed that your opinion on what is good and what is bad is the right one(you saying i downvote "good builds"), and you have repeated your same argument, over and over, in a hope to get other people to agree with you. so lets summarize here. i have downvoted builds that were, in my opinion, not good, you have claimed that i am a mass downvoter for this. i then respond to people who ask for feedback, where my response is usually "restart your build, i cant think of a way to give an upvote without building it a different way" and when i say this i realize that there is often some miscommunication, i do not aim to be rude when i say that. i just phrase it like that for a lack of another way to say it.
creations-chat 2021-05-17 21:37:06 prob cant cuz he is unde
creations-chat 2021-05-17 21:43:41 why did the other people downvote a warning. exactly, shut the fuck up. sorry pepsi, tired of idiots trying to make a point they cant prove and providing "evidence" that doesnt even make any sense
creations-chat 2021-05-17 21:50:15 i dont expect people to make things to my standards, thats why theres a downvote button, i judge on my standards, as do you on yours.
creations-chat 2021-05-17 21:54:13 why should i lower them, people should just not complain over my singular downvote. yknow thats an option too.(people complaining about numbers over the internet moment)
creations-chat 2021-05-17 21:59:34 so what you  are saying is, you cannot vote on something, which is not up to your standards? that is completely wrong and entirely throws the idea of public voting out the window, and the fact that people have different standards.

creations-chat 2021-05-18 16:26:42 <@456226577798135808> wonder why ur getting so many downvotes. I really just, couldnt imagine why you would get downvotes.
creations-chat 2021-05-18 16:30:26 Chernobyl lizard vs tin can
creations-chat 2021-05-20 12:04:41 I hate that. Looks like ur trying to make a pencil fly. It seems like you tried making a ta 152. First off its too long, next, its too skinny, the ta 152 is not that thin
creations-chat 2021-05-20 12:08:01 You made it too thin my guy. While it doesnt have a radial like the fw 190 series it does have an inline, so its a very long engine, the nose should be a bit thinner near the front and get widest at the cockpit, you have done the exact oposite of that
creations-chat 2021-05-20 12:11:49 First step, stop scraping ur underside all over the pavement. Step 2, use motor angling so it doesnt look like you tried to make it as low poly as possible
creations-chat 2021-05-20 12:14:21 Then why ask for feedback if you "cant" do anything with it. Exactly.
creations-chat 2021-05-20 12:21:57 No, use angled motors. Also, the cowling should be 3x3. The 152 is not a small plane, it should be wider
creations-chat 2021-05-20 12:27:08 Its already too big if you want it to scale. I used to do the same thing, except i used pixel measurements so my planes were usually pretty acurate to the blueprint. But i used to make a bunch of german planes like the bf109, he 162, and the fw 190.
creations-chat 2021-05-20 12:36:52 Atleast its off tge ground now. Still low poly tho
creations-chat 2021-05-20 12:49:03 I said the body looked super low poly
creations-chat 2021-05-20 12:55:41 "A bit" im not gonna go into everything i highly dislike on that build, but ill just say, that is terrible
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:12:36 How the hell, did you mistake a ta152 for a fw190
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:18:08 Ye, but the d9 varient was barely used, as compared to other varients. Why not just make a fw190 f8 varient
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:26:36 The designer ranks are worth 0 credit in pcc, all it does is inflate some idiots ego by about 500x.     YOUSUF MOMENT
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:28:37 Yousuf, i havent posted anything in creations since the bot was used to post them. Then designer 5 idiots get confused cuz they are three and ask how i got ranks with no creations
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:31:19 I could have gotten it for my working radial engine powered by magnets prob. Most likely not anymore, but a year ago when i made it i could prob have. No not a drive, an engine, as in it used pistons
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:33:24 Radial engines? That actually work?    Ur probably right guggi

creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:40:11 Ive spent enough time downvoting every shitty build to know that
creations-chat 2021-05-24 14:28:51 Its a low effort creation. Most likely going to be deleted
creations-chat 2021-05-24 14:37:40 First off, its just 2 tone. Add a lil color variation. Lets not start an argument im not in the mood. You people need to understand that theres such a thing as weathering, adding things like slightly darker spots near intake and exhaust
creations-chat 2021-05-25 19:50:44 Oh boo hoo, get over it.   Im not explaining why i downvote anymore, cuz you idiots choose not to listen
creations-chat 2021-05-25 19:57:21 Wouldnt consider that a city but ok
creations-chat 2021-05-27 12:35:37 <@727028164223696966>  a lil bit of weathering and stuff on that and ill upvote, honestly pretty good
creations-chat 2021-05-27 14:39:30 Have fun decifering between moving ur camera and placing blocks
general 2021-05-27 19:21:47 What
creations-chat 2021-05-28 20:04:31 MAKE SMOOTH !!!1!
creations-chat 2021-05-28 20:06:33 Top half of the fusulage and where it connects to the wings
creations-chat 2021-05-29 04:01:50 Look at where the wings connect to the fusulage
creations-chat 2021-05-29 05:08:42 Cuz i talked to hars and he said it was not meant to be like that
creations-chat 2021-05-29 05:12:19 Also, stop whining about downvotes, it is annoying, its literally a single person who doesnt like the build, in fact, it isnt even your build, so all you are doing is saying that your opinion is correct and mine is wrong. Now, please shut up, i am camping
creations-chat 2021-05-29 05:25:19 I said to stop pinging me.  I have given reasons for my downvotes when people ask for a reason, if you dont accept the reason then that is your own fault
general 2021-05-29 13:58:41 What
general 2021-05-29 14:00:30 Ive given my reason every time someone asks for a reason
general 2021-05-29 14:11:31 How is it possible to find ocean liners cool
general 2021-05-29 14:12:01 You literally find the most boring thing cool
general 2021-05-29 14:12:18 Wrong
creations-chat 2021-06-01 12:11:11 I would say your only problem is that the plane is fairly ugly, but i suppose that doesnt matter because it just lays the track out
creations-chat 2021-06-01 14:14:58 Well, kinda, if the build doesnt have a lot of effort it will usually look shit
creations-chat 2021-06-01 14:17:12 Incred community, i love when meme builds get upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 16:29:34 No, just builds i dont like the look of
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 16:29:52 Or builds that i know coukd be heavily improved apon
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 16:30:38 Ive stated why i downvote many times before, im not gonna again
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:25:43 You didnt ask for any my guy...
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:28:07 Also yes, if i saw my build posted i would prob downvote it, since it was made over a year ago, and my standards have changed since them
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:28:24 Im sorry im in school rn
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:28:40 Sure
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:29:11 Possibly, i just have higher than most cuz ive been around higher quality stuff a lot
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:29:25 Half up
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:29:53 Ok, so, what you do, is you put the wings a block above that and motorlock it down
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:30:06 It just makes it easier
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:30:21 No
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:30:27 Just the wings
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:31:41 Its hard to explain this to someone who thinks about motorlock differently, but i can try to explain
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:32:11 Same thing
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:33:59 Ok, so ur motorlocking basically means that any lateral line on the tower will end up level with the base of the tower, do you understand that?
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:34:12 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:34:20 When i see something good
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:34:49 Basically, just a line across the plots and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:35:14 Pretty good, not the greatest up close, but its decent
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:35:36 Uhhhh, ill be able to explain in person
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:35:47 But ill try to explain a lil rn
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:36:24 Basically, you need to connect the wing panels with a motorlock one block lower
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:53:33 Sure
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 19:55:07 Ill be able to show in about an hour
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:03:44 Too much fartin
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:05:54 I mean its bad. If you want me to go into more detail then say it, and dont be a baby about it when i point things out
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:08:27 Agreed
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:14:28 No point, thin treads require tank treads to be 2 blocks wide
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:16:31 No point, would look rlly weird. Treads too wide for the tank.  Dont, it would look weird, ur tank is too small for the treads, your trwads would need to be 1 block wide
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:19:37 <@410992368494575626> ok man, ive been holding back for a while now, but i need to know. Why do you keep making creations with that ***awful*** fade
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:23:35 <@410992368494575626> you gonna answer?
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:25:58 The fade is shit, and im tired of people pretending its good.  I never said anything about colors, go for the colors of you want, i just wanna know, why the bad fade, like atleast make it more smooth
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:28:08 Wdym mad, i literally asked a question...     and wdym stop hating, im allowed to dislike something
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:30:48 Why are you acting like this is a personal attack and im going to send a pipe bomb in ur mailbox
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:37:50 Again.... when did i ever say that my opinion is correct? When i said, the fade is bad and im tired of people pretending its not, that was an obvious joke.
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:39:59 Yes, i did say, that it was my opinion that i didnt like it
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:45:41 List a creation, i can give a reason. Im not sure what you mean by, "no reason" as i always have a reason when someone **asks**. However im not just gonna list the reasons i downvote every time i downvote without anyone asking for it. If someone wants to know they can ask. Stop trying to fight on everyones behalf and worry about yourself
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:54:34 He has pretty smooth builds sometimes, but the fade is very harsh and rushed, so it makes it look very blocky
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:56:41 i just dont understand how people still think i dont have reasons when i downvote, after me explaining my reasoning to countless people
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:01:07 cuz you just joined, have no reputation, other than earning one rn that says ur a dipshit who's ego is bigger than the titanic, and are now saying builds are bad when you havent even made anything to the level of public server standards
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:03:26 if you dont care if people downvote you build then you shouldnt care if people say ur build is bad, since, yknow, thats what downvoting is
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:07:04 "red arrows don't hurt anyone" is what ive been saying to idiots who keep accusing me of mass downvoting, they however, seem quite offended that i could possibly have an opinion on the builds i downvote, and try to disprove it every time i say it
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:09:05 its usually hatefull cuz those tiny things that took maybe 10 minutes at the most get 100+ upvotes, its annoying to no end
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:11:32 i literally dont say anything in this server unless someone asks why i downvote, which happens every day. except of course when i asked why you did fades like that
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 21:13:43 <@!326047594495344641> ok man, where u at
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:18:05 possibly, the only thing is is that im usually the one that has to say to the other person that just because everyone else agrees does not mean i have to, which is usually why i get so annoyed at people, because the argument goes like how it went with altyz, they say that im the only one that downvoted, and thats their only thing they keep saying
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:20:16 seyo said he is done arguing with a person with -4 braincells, thats why it ended
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 21:21:12 vip 1?
bot-central 2021-06-01 21:21:46 !servers
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:28:38 The white is way too bright, the blue is too vibrant and almost looks neon, it moves around underwater, it shouldnt be clean, add a bit of variation to the white
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:32:19 Doesnt need to be worn down, just make it look better by adding artificial shading on the underside of the side ridges. The shadows in game arent good, tgats why you add shading, also take a look at the zeppelin in hof, that has shading, that's why it looks nice, you add shading so you can tell what the exact shape is, cus rn it just looks like a white blob
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:37:50 Also, saying you got the color pallet from the devs means nothing when they have a different shader. Your shoukd be darker to compensate for how bright roblox is
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:43:43 Ok first of all, i know he shaded bcuz i can literally see it, and second bcuz im friends with fortune, i was there for most of the time he was making it. And i gave my feedback, either take it, or dont. Theres no need to argue
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:50:20 No, prob not, if soneone told me my paint looked off i would fix it
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:53:07 Yes, i downvote for lil things, thats already been cleared up, there are a few other reasons i downvoted your build, but this was the easiest to explain over phone
creations-chat 2021-06-02 12:55:24 Cuz its more detail stuff, if u want me to list, then i will. But i might not respond due to class starting soon.  The first thing i see is the paint, next is the shaping of the hull, it is extrememly blocky and needs some motor angling, and more builds components
creations-chat 2021-06-02 13:01:01 Indeed, not possible
creations-chat 2021-06-02 13:03:02 Well i downvoted for other reasons but i have to go to class rn, i can answer you in 80 mins if you want tho
creations-chat 2021-06-02 13:59:37 SEE
creations-chat 2021-06-02 14:01:38 Motor angling
creations-chat 2021-06-02 14:07:07 Just remember the camera is locked globally to your seat
help 2021-06-02 14:30:14 Your control surfaces between tbe front and back are too close, so they will have the same controls acting as 1 elevator
help 2021-06-02 14:30:40 Cheese grater
help 2021-06-02 14:31:02 No, thats just terrible proportions
help 2021-06-02 14:31:15 Its actually too far apart

help 2021-06-02 14:32:10 Too many control surfaces
help 2021-06-02 14:32:55 Ricks code for the control surfaces has a hard time when you use so many control surfaces
help 2021-06-02 14:33:27 Just delete some on the front
help 2021-06-02 14:33:48 Bcuz the control surfaces dont go back as far
creations-chat 2021-06-02 16:14:43 ok
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:33:30 your saying people need a build to point something out?
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:37:55 heres a lil proof if you want some, lets start with people who have said im a good builder, fortune_foxx, denied me when i said he was a better builder than me, tooti, literally just said im 100 times better than u, herr guggi, has and still does, keep telling me to finish builds bcuz he wants to see them. so thats just people, and then there is also the fact that i started making an entire fusulage out of angled trails just to get the body shaped right
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:42:03 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/686788994507210766/822487663368994826/unknown.png
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:45:37 theres a very specific reason i dont post in creations, 1, i dont care about fame <:trollface:775024642104229898>, 2 i cant get feedback from this community because you guys are such babies that you cant point out things that are wrong.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:47:45 i tell people to rebuild stuff cuz i cant think of a way to fix it where it would get an upvote from me without building it completely differently
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:49:47 how, i am giving feedback, im telling them what they would need to do, im not gonna say, "you can fix this" and then they fix it and i downvote it again, no, im going to tell them what they need to do to get an upvote from me, you dont need to listen to me. v literally exactly whats happening
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:51:53 how, tell me one time where someone asked for a reason, and i didnt tell them a reason
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:56:28 you want a creation on my standards, fortune_foxx's hof build
creations-chat 2021-06-02 22:58:54 i dont show cuz none of them are finished
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:01:24 but it is to my standards..... why are you trying to say what my standards are? thats about the most moronic thing i think anybody has said to me in creations-feedback
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:23:38 its funny that you call me kid, that is actually funny now
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:26:27 ive literally given my reasons, the fact you are ignoring them and choosing to complain about downvotes is hilarious
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:28:39 and what was my stupid excuse?
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:34:13 your negative iq and terrible "proof" is probably the worst that i have argued with in creations feedback. you are literally disregarding my reasoning simply because it goes against what you are saying
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:36:41 bruh, just look at one of my years old builds, that should be good enough, even though they look like trash. when did i ever say that BQ_nk
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:39:17 hold on lemme get in game rn
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:41:41 i usually dont give feedback on wip, cuz im not asked about wip
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:44:38 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672985768746156074/849795468774211584/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672985768746156074/849795382090661928/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672985768746156074/849795334699483196/unknown.png theres a few, this was pre heavily piston locking stuff, and as you can see, is heavily wip
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:47:44 exactly, i never sat down and said, im the best builder here, also, slayer, how stupid are you, there isnt a single block of helium in the build, its disconnectors, the holes in the wings are simply there cuz its a wip and i was just even seeing if my landing gear would fit, the prop is basic, idk what that means but cant tell if its a insult or not.
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:49:52 you are literally trying to give feedback on a plane that is heavily wip and doesnt even have the bottom half of the tail
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:51:53 i was asked to post it cuz these guys are idiots. icommit, you might actually have to, this guys braincells are through the floor
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:54:06 the only thing you have proved is that you like to point out obvious things on a wip build
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:56:41 no, i have high standards when somebody has asked for feedback on a completed build, not a wip
creations-chat 2021-06-02 23:58:51 obc, im sorry, im just having a hard time actually conversing with this guy, it is actually difficult to tell if he is being serious or not due to the stupidity of his posts
creations-chat 2021-06-03 00:01:21 i wasnt talking to you, was i? yeah i didnt think so, if you get provoked by it, then maybe you need a break.
creations-chat 2021-06-03 00:03:22 i was talking to obc, yes it was about you, but it was to obc, so why choose to respond? seriously, just stop
creations-chat 2021-06-03 13:14:54 Prob cuz the idea was so stupid that nobody likes it. The, rbk is, rbk. Him, he is, the his
creations-chat 2021-06-03 13:17:02 Image?
creations-chat 2021-06-03 13:19:06 If someone makes that, and makes the wing with only wing panels, so paper thin, i would commit a murder. That is atleast 4 blocks thick
creations-chat 2021-06-03 13:21:55 At that point, why not make the main guns a explosive ball cannon
creations-chat 2021-06-03 13:24:04 No, i hate gustas, dont ping him
creations-chat 2021-06-03 13:26:11 Dont say that i dont wanna see another green blob with no other color on the vehicle. I hate when people just make solid color vehicles
creations-chat 2021-06-03 14:06:21 Its.... painful, to look at
creations-chat 2021-06-03 15:55:54 You mean my wip? ...i think your thinking of the wrong guy.... i only actually point things out on builds when someone asks for how to make it better, so basically only things in creations. Not wips
creations-chat 2021-06-03 16:09:17 Yes, thats the point.  It needs thick wings so they dont snap under the weight of the fusulage.   Ye, same reason
creations-chat 2021-06-05 21:47:54 Nobody likes it cuz its ugly as fuck
creations-chat 2021-06-05 21:56:15 Im not even gonna waste my time answering a question this dumb

creations-chat 2021-06-06 22:06:58 Is it a script, ill just ask blatantly. If its not a script then explain it to me.
creations-chat 2021-06-06 22:11:23 How would the rocket stay attached to the tnt, stupid
creations-chat 2021-06-06 22:17:07 Yes
creations-chat 2021-06-06 22:19:09 Its most likely a script. Literally asked prototrode, and he says its most likely a script
creations-chat 2021-06-06 22:21:27 If its something to do with a rocket then dm me yes or no. Tbh i couldnt care less, mouse guided works fine, and i dont build much anymore. I just wanna know if you used a script or not

creations-chat 2021-06-18 07:40:00 thank
creations-chat 2021-06-18 17:18:49 ok, im gonna start by saying this, if i see something that could use improvement then im gonna downvote to tell them there are things to be improved apon. thanks you for asking for feedback, not thank you for immediately assuming your kitchen has no flaws and calling me a mass downvoter. this might just be the style you were going for, and you dont need to change it necisarily, but the shelves on the right dont have a border and it just looks kinda off. the cupboards on the top left also dont have a handle on them so it also looks off, again, dont need to take it to heart, its literally just one guy saying your builds could have some improvements
creations-chat 2021-06-18 17:22:59 i do, but only if they ask for feedback, if they ask ill be happy to tell them, but im not just gonna ping them and tell them everything they could fix without them even asking for it. look at my message above
creations-chat 2021-06-18 17:25:22 is that good enough feedback? in the large edited message
creations-chat 2021-06-18 17:27:35 then its just my preference
creations-chat 2021-06-18 17:40:25 how about, you stop getting so butthurt about a single opinion. just take the downvote and realise you can fix something, or ask what needs fixing and do what you want, im not telling people they need to fix it, it really couldnt matter less to me.     not sure this is rlly a paragraph, but ok

creations-chat 2021-07-11 13:03:42 I think i only used 2 angled motors, and that was for the top of the engine and the top of the cockpit
creations-chat 2021-07-11 13:05:44 Yeah, it was either i have my character able to see out of the cockpit and have a gunner sight or have a smoother cocpit

creations-chat 2021-07-11 13:14:18 I really wanna make the engine out of trails too, but i had already spent 4 hours trying to do that without any luck.  Yes much motorlock, very easy tho. I mean that tail section is made of 3 rows of motorlock, and its 2x2, the engine is like 1.3x1.6 i believe in my measuring. So far the hardest part is making the nose
creations-chat 2021-07-11 13:17:18 I have to make the trails angle to a half ball smoothly
creations-chat 2021-07-11 13:19:21 Ive already done some testing with it, and im debating between keeping my sanity and making it look good
creations-chat 2021-07-11 13:21:22 Ive been paying my sacrifices for 3 years, not much left i can sacrifice. Ah yes
creations-chat 2021-07-11 13:29:44 No, big builds are what i avoid. My scaling has and always will be: 6 ft tall person will be either 3 or 4 blocks tall

creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:50:51 Pvp version of plane, its not meant to look perfect, just wanted to revisit my old pvp he 162. Its a big improvement from the 2 year old plane

creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:03:57 This is why i will never get hof, even if i made the best build pcc has ever seen, i am very disliked, because people still see me as a mass downvoter
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:05:57 Im going to delay the bv 238 for another year just to anger you <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152> oh wait thats guggi that is angry avout that
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:08:56 I wanna finish it but i also wanna make it hover engine powered, that is why its taking so long
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:10:57 I just need more parts, as soon as we get a ball joint the 238 will be finished so quick.     Nyan thats the he162 ur thinking of.      Better be a good one, if its not i will berate you. The 262 fusulage is something i dont even want to attempt
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:13:43 Look up what a bv238 is.    Kokamzy, thereason is so you have it look as realistic as possible
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:15:47 That would be possible sir, if the new people werent such entitled brats, i usually give someone respect until they are an ass, and when a new player thinks they can just insult older players without even having a build posted, they are gonna get stomped
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:17:53 To my knowledge, i have the biggest bv 238 in plane crazy, there is an old picture with hars, guggi, scot, and a few others with my bv in it.    Dude, jrblack, all i did was downvote a build i didnt think looked good, if he wants feedback he can ask
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:22:50 What a shitty move, almost as bad as saying "looks unfinished" to a wip build
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:21:09 Wings
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:23:11 I pixel measured my 162, and ur wings are too long, you do pixel measurements and you will see
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:26:44 Basically, take a blueprint, make a part fir the plane, for example the cockpit, take the pixel length of the blueprint cockpit(we will say 40 pixels) if ur cocpit is 2 blocks long then you take 40÷2 and you get your pixel for block scale
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:33:13 Its basic math...... are you saying thats too complicated?....
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:39:13 Heres something to consider: *most of those whitebames dont ask for feedback. And the bullying you are talking about is literally just a build getting downvoted*. For me, it goes like this: if its shit ill downvote it, if they dont ask for feedback, i dont give it, if they ask ill give feedback
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:43:14 Bruh shush, your basically a whitename yourself (trolls)
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:45:44 Ill give you one guess
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:48:15 Yes, when a singke block gets posted. Happens more often than you would think
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:50:16 That too

creations-chat 2021-07-11 17:40:56 I should do that with some of my builds to see the mess

creations-chat 2021-07-11 18:33:09 You can raise the blue number by 10 and see how that looks <@345527706340818944>
creations-chat 2021-07-11 18:36:24 The blue that guy suggested was good just raise the blue by 10.    Put it on the plane so i can see
creations-chat 2021-07-11 18:53:45 Agree
creations-chat 2021-07-11 18:55:47 Intake, nose, area behind cockpit, underside of thevplane
creations-chat 2021-07-11 19:56:59 It stinky
creations-chat 2021-07-11 20:10:08 Bruh and you said an unfinished ship of yours could get hof, you cant even find the different between exhaust snd intake. Also plane looks rlly stinky. Show then
creations-chat 2021-07-14 04:11:49 If thats rlly what you think then you will never get to hof with any build
creations-chat 2021-07-16 06:51:05 Me when, i see that hideous monstrocity of a build: :( and then everyone says its a good build when its super ugly: :(
creations-chat 2021-07-16 06:54:06 Put all his effort into the nose, and forgot that planes are supposed to thin out at the tail
creations-chat 2021-07-16 06:57:22 I literally havent finished a single build. I made a new he 162. And didnt paint it <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>

creations-chat 2021-07-16 07:03:26 It is, it literally has anorexia, but atleast it doesnt woble as much as the last version https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/686788994507210766/855338756533911592/unknown.png
creations-chat 2021-07-16 07:09:00 Tiny engine
creations-chat 2021-07-16 07:11:40 No you should make the engine bigger, also make it not a square
creations-chat 2021-07-16 07:16:16 Bruh, your plane looks nothing like tgat, yours is too skinny, that thing looks like a rocket, your nose is too pointy, make it more rounded out. And are those wings made of paper. And your cockpit, its too low
creations-chat 2021-07-16 10:35:02 Wdym
creations-chat 2021-07-16 10:38:37 Oh well, atleast it actually looks like the plane its modeled after unlike most builds here <:FineTroll:626841259746656289> all i have to do is just outspeed tgem
creations-chat 2021-07-16 10:41:35 Its a pure boom and zoom build, very fast dive speed due to weight
creations-chat 2021-07-16 12:15:24 Forgot to say this earlier, there isnt much point in me posting here, a lot of people dont like me cuz i downvote their builds, so i will most likely get downvote bombed
creations-chat 2021-07-16 12:18:49 Yeah, most of the people who have decent builds in here are fine with me, its just the people who dont have good builds that really dont like me
creations-chat 2021-07-16 12:20:59 Yeah. Idk, maybe ill paint up that 162 and just post it
creations-chat 2021-07-16 12:23:01 And then maybe finish my aluette, bv238, he111, spacecraft...... yeah theres a lot of things

creations-chat 2021-09-16 02:27:53 but there wasnt effort, it doesnt even look like a charger
creations-chat 2021-09-16 02:30:58 more likely got upvotes cuz pcc has public server standards now

creations-chat 2021-10-14 13:46:42 Yeah that looks really really bad, back in early 2020 that wouldnt get any upvotes. Of course now it does, cuz standards are at a new low

general 2021-10-14 14:22:28 In fact, i have a prototype of it
general 2021-10-14 14:23:18 Im literally the guy making a plane fusulage out of trails, a barrel isnt hard

general 2021-10-14 14:25:54 Thats the tail, its gonna need double the trails to make it more smooth
general 2021-10-14 14:26:49 Yeah the prototype i have is very simple literally just a barrel with an opening to put the rounds in
general 2021-10-14 14:27:13 Ok brb
general 2021-10-14 14:28:12 Oh hey, that reload would work perfect for it

creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:13:41 Oh i hate it when people say that.  I mean what else am i supposed to judge by
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:19:06 In this server looks are everything, again, we cant judge on anything else when you only give a picture
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:21:07 Does it fly using the wings or is it just rockets or hovers
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:23:26 Nah bruh when im done im making that thing fly with the wings, i cant take that kind of disapointment
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:27:31 <@434710676154613770> actually, i need some info first. Just how many blocks do you think a wing is
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:29:32 Uh actually im at work. So its gonna have to wait until a few more hours. But ill tell you after work
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:32:02 I mean, it is lunch break rn...
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:34:42 I have it at any time between 12 and 1 but we only take 30 mins. Also work kinda slow around these hours since nobody buys things here when they at work themselves
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:36:44 Yeah
creations-chat 2021-10-14 17:42:55 You literally didn't use a single motor to make the plane look better
creations-chat 2021-10-14 19:48:00 Idk post it so we can see it, instead of massive glare. You might as well have just posted the shadow and said "fEeDbAcK?"
creations-chat 2021-10-14 19:50:33 <@760578875163410432>
creations-chat 2021-10-14 19:54:48 <@760578875163410432>  body of the truck is way too long,  wheels are too small for that chassis, its all black, no real detail
creations-chat 2021-10-14 20:09:16 This conversation that just happened, i feel like it sums up the average iq in pcc
creations-chat 2021-10-14 20:11:17 Yeah pretty much
creations-chat 2021-10-14 20:45:43 Ok, the single block creations are not funny anymore, only the original was.   You guys prob werent around for the original

general 2021-10-22 16:19:49 It is man who never puts treads on his tanks
general 2021-10-22 16:20:29 Non treads even more cringe
general 2021-10-22 16:21:10 Not realism
general 2021-10-22 16:21:26 -1000 social credit
general 2021-10-22 16:21:58 Working ones chad
general 2021-10-22 16:22:24 Thats cuz u dont secure them
general 2021-10-22 16:22:38 And thats ur computer
general 2021-10-22 16:23:00 (False)
general 2021-10-22 16:23:30 Never had a problem with my treads falling off
general 2021-10-22 16:23:50 Unless someone rams into them at 363543
general 2021-10-22 16:24:21 If ur treads fall off they arent tight enough
creations-chat 2021-10-22 16:27:13 No...
creations-chat 2021-10-25 14:29:14 U guys almost at angry at him as u were at me    hi puri
creations-chat 2021-10-27 17:04:17 Make the hovers internally
creations-chat 2021-10-27 17:06:26 Make it like a shaft going inside the heli, and have the hovers rotate inside a hollow cylinder.   Called a hover engine instead of a hover drive
creations-chat 2021-10-27 17:08:35 Still looks like shit.   Internal hovers looks better too
creations-chat 2021-10-27 17:14:05 Hover drive: pushes off of motor or piston or spring to move you forward. 
Hiver engine: a shaft with hover engines on it to spin the shaft, pushes off the walls, usually enclosed within the vehicle, works best inside a hollowed out cylinder
general 2021-10-27 17:17:18 Aliver
general 2021-10-27 17:26:09 Since when did so many no ranks start talking
general 2021-10-27 17:27:46 Like, its not that hard to get a rank
general 2021-10-27 17:28:39 You know u get access to the vip servers if u have a rank right?
general 2021-10-27 17:29:06 Ok then

general 2021-10-27 17:30:10 Not even plane crazy
general 2021-10-27 17:30:43 Studios is not as fulfilling as pc
general 2021-10-27 17:30:55 Just not the same challenge
general 2021-10-27 17:31:21 Like?
general 2021-10-27 17:32:39 I meant creating something in studios isnt as satisfying
general 2021-10-27 17:32:52 With pc you are limited
general 2021-10-27 17:33:16 With studios, you arent nearly as limited
general 2021-10-27 17:33:47 That wasnt my point tho
general 2021-10-27 17:34:12 Yeah no
bot-central 2021-10-27 17:36:04 !rank

the-dump 2021-10-30 00:00:31 ok
creations-chat 2021-11-03 13:12:52 This is the outcome of someone who cant think ahead, they only try to fix a tiny problem and then cause a larger problem. Also looks like they trying to motorlock to impress. Which they have failed at miserably
creations-chat 2021-11-03 13:14:52 No exposed motorlock cuz this has no detailwork, the fusulage is literally a square
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:15:47 Ur fusulage
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:15:56 Is literally a square
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:17:09 Oh no, i didnt even notice that it was solid grey, thats even worse

plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:29:21 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:29:36 Convertables hard to manage
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:29:43 Get damaged easily
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:29:49 Repair is ass
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:30:11 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:30:29 U have to take care of the hinges so they dont rust
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:30:39 Or just plain break
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:31:20 Those just annoying to take down, the soft top gets easily broken and ripped
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:31:25 Shit to clean
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:32:09 Fuck it, uncivil engineering
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:33:32 Hars
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:34:30 Left pcc cuz his standards were too high for people so they called him mass downvoter
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:34:49 Story of every old pcc member that still posted
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:35:41 Only reason i havent left is so i can create a timeline of deteriorating skill in pcc
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:35:56 So far
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:36:09 We at the lowest skill level ive seen
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:36:33 Ive been around since about 2019
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:36:59 And the standards arent the only thing getting worse
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:37:14 The people have been terriblr
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:37:48 Used to post in pcc
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:38:22 Stopped when pcc gained large amounts of public server players and they dropped the average iq to 5
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:39:20 Yeah, the only builds in creations that you can find, are ones that were posted by the bot back in the day
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:40:30 After aproximately 3400 hours in plane crazy there isnt much to do
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:40:37 Lost motivation
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:41:15 Ive got 5 accounts
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:41:19 Each has about

plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:42:52 Perhaps,
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:43:00 The story of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:45:09 I cant even tell you how many times ive absolutely destroyed some idiot claiming he has the smallest double wishbone or macpherson susoension and then pull out mine thats about 5 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:46:47 The difference between me and other old pcc members leaving, is that when they leave, they will be missed, i on the other hand, prob wont be, cuz im pretty sure most of pcc hates me and my standards
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:47:14 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:47:39 Its prob gonna be like hars, except i wont be as much of an ass
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:49:56 Idk, should i start posting my creations
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 13:50:02 Cuz i got so many

creations-chat 2021-11-05 17:38:43 Its all the same color
creations-chat 2021-11-05 17:56:16 The main bodywork, its all a dark shade that makes it have no highlights due to roblox lighting. (Meaning you cant see tge detailwork so it kinda just looks like a solid black mass) you can make artificial highlights with different shades
creations-chat 2021-11-05 17:59:15 Add a very slight blue tint to the black.  Add highlights
creations-chat 2021-11-06 17:40:08 do i really need to explain? like do you seriously not know why i downvoted?
creations-chat 2021-11-06 17:43:36 the wheels look ass, i dont even know what kinda design you were attempting to make but it looks garbage, the hull looks like the base of a blender and then you put some shiny batteries on it, the undercarriage looks like you literally put like 2 minutes in it max, and the entire build overall is very monotonous and very bland
creations-chat 2021-11-06 17:46:12 no joke ur hull literally looking like a flattened version of this <@456226577798135808> theres ur feedback
creations-chat 2021-11-06 17:49:03 still cant believe solee blocked me from downvoting him cuz he cant cope with a red arrow.   look at all their recent build, notice how none of them have a downvote from me. it literally wont lemme downvote them, even tho i hate them so much.
creations-chat 2021-11-06 17:52:13 ye they blocked me
creations-chat 2021-11-06 20:26:51 they not good.    doesnt add side detail, colors are very monotonous, like his ships are literally the same color with no highlights so it literally just looks like a grey blob

creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:00:47 Bro..... you dont need wishbone suspension..... i hate you so much for this...... why did you do it
creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:04:26 Listen man.... theres a line you dont cross when going for realism, and you flew past that line. That line is when your uhh "realism" makes your build look like a pile of shit
creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:06:27 Just dont make it have suspension like that, its damn near the dumbest thing i think ive seen in this shithole
creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:12:20 Goddamn u a dumbass, i know planes have suspension. Im pretty sure most people do, but guess what, they usually dont have DOUBLE WISHBONE THAT NEARLY TOUCHES THE GROUND AND MAKES IT LOOK LIKE A 5 YEAR OLD WITH A WELDER FOUND A BUNCH OF PIPES AND PUT THEM ON UR PLANE

creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:27:29 Bro i cant fucking deal with this. Its like trying to deal with children who think they are funny and know everything. And you just have to sit there cuz it takes to long to explain it to them cuz they dumb as rocks
creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:29:29 You alone bring the average iq down by 4
creations-chat 2021-12-23 16:32:33 Literally proving my point. 2 unironic your mother jokes as a response

creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:06:12 Ok? So you are gonna get butthurt or something because i called some shitty builds shit?
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:08:18 Really, cuz thats exactly what you are doing rn "most toxic person in this community" if you cant take some critisizm then dont ask me to tell you whats wrong with your build
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:10:20 Oh yeah lemme just go back through my messages so i can find exactly what i said instead of shortening it.  No you dumbass.      Bruh, josh, it doesnt take a college degree to figure out i wasnt talking about you
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:16:49 Wdym nobody asks me... nobody asks me anymore cuz theres too much stuff to downvote so i just dont anymore. And i dont tell people how to fix it? Wdym i do tell them how
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:19:44 I didnt delete messages it got deleted for "spamming" cuz i put too many spaces in an edit. Wdym cope? That literally doesnt make any sense
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:23:09 Just a slightly annoying thing. Says original creator is herr, is funny i think, even after he said it wasnt him
creations-chat 2021-12-23 17:25:10 I didnt even say anything against you. I literally just said that it was annoying people are still crediting herr even when he said it wasnt him

general 2022-03-07 15:59:36 very funny

general 2022-03-07 16:00:42 amaze
general 2022-03-07 16:01:09 probably
general 2022-03-07 16:01:30 yeah probably
general 2022-03-07 16:03:24 ricks dev team, if he even has one, im not sure if he even got anyone to join him
general 2022-03-07 16:03:57 i fucking hate yousuf
general 2022-03-07 16:04:47 no?
general 2022-03-07 16:05:02 rick is not a very likeable person'
general 2022-03-07 16:05:22 when obc offered to help with the coding rick basically said fuck off i dont trust you
general 2022-03-07 16:05:34 yes, and nobody wants to join him cuz hes an ass
general 2022-03-07 16:06:12 yup
general 2022-03-07 16:07:44 no its not confirmed
general 2022-03-07 16:08:06 thats a lie
general 2022-03-07 16:08:45 rick wouldnt be begging for help if he was almost done with the game
general 2022-03-07 16:09:06 with the messages i saw, it looked like rick was literally begging for help
general 2022-03-07 16:10:10 yeah, im sure hes close to being done with the coding, its most likely the map work thats taking so long, since rick is kinda shitty with map building
general 2022-03-07 16:11:00 oh my goodne, it is pigge
general 2022-03-07 16:14:29 well heres the thing rbk, hes been saying that we are getting a new game for idk how long at this point, but he has barely delivered, and the fact he is begging for help from other devs means to me, that he is nowhere near done
general 2022-03-07 16:15:12 i wouldnt mind the pcc being deleted
general 2022-03-07 16:15:20 full of shit anyway

general 2022-03-07 16:19:53 i said he probably doesnt, hes not very likeable
general 2022-03-07 16:20:18 he asked him once, the guy declines, rick threatenes a lawsuit, rick asks again
general 2022-03-07 16:20:27 idk?
general 2022-03-07 16:20:43 i dont have direct contact with him
general 2022-03-07 16:21:03 yes, it was explained to me
general 2022-03-07 16:21:18 yeah
general 2022-03-07 16:21:20 he was
general 2022-03-07 16:21:50 yeah but rick is begging him to join the team
general 2022-03-07 16:23:13 you can see the date
general 2022-03-07 16:25:13 rick saying "you can add anything you want yourself to the game" "are you really sure you dont want to work on pc2?" "under any condition?" sure sounds a lot like he wants him to join
general 2022-03-07 16:27:27 maybe because rick is getting nowhere, the mere fact that people were able to make a copy of plane crazy before rick was even able to clean up his coding is meant to send a message about how slowly he is going, i know he has things going on in his own life, but a team of people should be able to put out a game quicker than a single person can
general 2022-03-07 16:29:42 oh i know its nowhere near as good, but again, this is one guy, not even a fucking adult, who was able to create a game with the same premise
general 2022-03-07 16:30:30 when did i ever say it was good, get that through your thick ass skull
general 2022-03-07 16:30:56 hold on lemme find it
general 2022-03-07 16:31:55 wait what
general 2022-03-07 16:32:01 i didnt say anything bad tho

creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:26:24 Why is it so.... plain. Like there is absolutely 0 weathering
creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:28:25 If its a wip then why did u paint it.        Why is it a mistake.    You dont paint as you go, everything is subject to change so painting while building is a waste
creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:36:42 Or just, paint it after because thats easier and doesnt waste time?      If there is clipping then u just paint it the same color.   Its that simple
creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:38:43 Jealous of what? What are you even talking about.     Exactly bq_nk, one of the few times ive seen you not agree with the other person
creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:41:22 Just a waste of time....

general 2022-03-24 17:57:50 Noway
general 2022-03-24 17:58:05 Perhaps i continue my builds again
general 2022-03-24 17:58:41 🤨
general 2022-03-24 17:59:02 Use pixel measure
general 2022-03-24 17:59:04 Now
general 2022-03-24 17:59:47 Basically, take something you know the scale of, like a roadwheel that is a 2x2, take the pixel diameter of that object
general 2022-03-24 17:59:58 You now have a reference point
general 2022-03-24 18:03:22 <@718409831639154718> measure the pixel width of a part you have in plane crazy (like a roadwheel that is 2x2) so you take the length in pixels and get the pixels per block, you can now know the exact length with math and a blueprint
general 2022-03-24 18:03:46 Use it
general 2022-03-24 18:03:57 Now
general 2022-04-04 13:31:45 Return from the depths

general 2022-04-04 13:33:25 Cad slander
general 2022-04-04 13:34:59 Perhaps it was a mistake to return from the depths
general 2022-04-04 13:37:31 You are probably right, this place is pretty terrible
general 2022-04-04 13:37:57 Only a few of the old builders remain
general 2022-04-04 13:38:34 Not many people of intelectual value to converse with
general 2022-04-04 13:39:20 But i can still hope for pcc to be repaired
general 2022-04-04 13:39:51 Not welcome, ive been here to see the downfall of this place
general 2022-04-04 13:40:25 I dont think pc2 is gonna fix this community
general 2022-04-04 13:40:41 Repair the community
general 2022-04-04 13:41:06 I know, quite terrible
general 2022-04-04 13:42:12 There was something there, at the begining, back before the old players got banned, or left
general 2022-04-04 13:42:48 Spool up that turbo bruh
general 2022-04-04 13:42:59 Exactly
general 2022-04-04 13:44:14 Players who were actually skilled, before the influx of new players who brought the average iq down to 18
general 2022-04-04 13:44:38 So about, midway thru 2020
general 2022-04-04 13:44:53 Yea, but for the time they were good
general 2022-04-04 13:45:21 The difference was that the pros still conversed
general 2022-04-04 13:47:33 Basically, what happened is a bunch of pros got kicked, so since most pros at that time were part of a major friend group, orbiting discord servers were created, and the pros no longer talked in pcc, thats what happened to my group and another group
general 2022-04-04 13:49:27 Yeah, but for the most part that's kinda what happened, im sure you remember the original haemen server and the dictator one
general 2022-04-04 13:50:13 Vip, what ever happened to sakura
general 2022-04-04 13:50:24 True
general 2022-04-04 13:50:30 Oh
general 2022-04-04 13:50:34 Very epic
general 2022-04-04 13:51:22 Did sakura pursue something in coding,  cuz their scripts were insane
general 2022-04-04 13:52:47 Tinon i beleive you were in the haemen server before we moved to a new one
general 2022-04-04 13:52:58 Epic
general 2022-04-04 13:56:40 I know u were in the anti haemen server atleast
general 2022-04-04 13:57:09 There was just one
general 2022-04-04 13:57:20 And then everyone left cuz he was an ass
general 2022-04-04 13:57:44 Yeah you were in the no dictator server i remember that
general 2022-04-04 13:58:25 Yeah, it was the server created to get away from haemen
general 2022-04-04 14:00:21 Basically how this is gonna go for me, is im gonna attempt to finish a few of the builds that i never got done, and then start anew in pc2
general 2022-04-04 14:01:51 Thats one of the ones i plan to finish
general 2022-04-04 14:03:21 The to do list for me, is this order: finish the porsche, then the fw 190, then the swordfish mk 3, which is one of my rare custom builds
general 2022-04-04 14:04:32 But i think herr guggi might force me to finish that bv238 too.... not looking forward to that...
general 2022-04-04 14:05:12 You can find an image of it if you look through the search for long enough

general 2022-04-04 14:08:12 The biggest one right in the middle
general 2022-04-04 14:10:13 Anyways yeah, i have quite a few that need to get done
general 2022-04-04 14:10:56 I'm just lucky guggi didnt see my he 111, i think i would actually die if i was forced to keep building that
general 2022-04-04 14:14:54 If i remember correctly, the thing i was doing with the he 111 was a to scale version of it, with a full interior and realistic first person controls, like full flight stick, throttle, and rudder pedals moving, i think the last thing i had done with it was the cockpit being mostly done and work on the hover engines and realistic landing gear had started
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 16:02:49 No..... why....
plane-crazy 2022-04-04 16:04:09 Agree

creations-chat 2022-04-04 20:24:54 <@626449107577471012> basically, the flush wing won't hinder flight performance, in my experience it doesn't get jammed

general 2022-04-05 11:50:02 The way
general 2022-04-05 11:50:06 It works
general 2022-04-05 11:51:42 You have one large rotor on top of your helicopter, that is your flight rotor, then, at the back of the long boom sticking out of the rear of the heli, there is a smaller prop that is trying to spin the heli opposite way than the main rotor
general 2022-04-05 11:54:13 <@545211047422722059> ur blades are different lengths or weight
general 2022-04-05 11:55:23 <@545211047422722059> you can bypass the whole torque thing if you instead power the main rotor with hover drives on the end of the blades
general 2022-04-05 11:55:43 Noway
general 2022-04-05 11:56:18 Wtf why do you have that, just a picture of a screw
general 2022-04-05 11:56:35 That is such a niche picture
general 2022-04-05 12:00:58 Cuz its hard to make the client match up with the server when ur code that you made extremely hard to work on looks like spaghetti
general 2022-04-05 12:01:46 Nope, its just a result of bad code
general 2022-04-05 12:02:04 And other roblox syncing issues
general 2022-04-05 12:02:16 Yes
general 2022-04-05 12:03:17 Yeah i really love when a blast sn aircraft in half with a supersonic strike from a firework and he says "nah im still in one peice on my screen"
general 2022-04-05 12:04:40 Its most definitely not made better by the fact that its messy and touching one thing will break something else
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:22:08 Yes
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:24:18 <@918581321004089364> i want you to tell me..... what you used to measure that out...... because that is not correct at all........
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:28:06 Listen dude, i want you to just quickly look at a blueprint, and use a pixel measuring tool..... ive made a p47 before, that was one of my first builds, and guess what,  even that looked more correctly built
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:30:12 Can you put it up to a side profile?
creations-chat 2022-04-05 14:32:16 Its so misproportionate....

creations-chat 2022-04-05 16:10:38 No
creations-chat 2022-04-05 17:57:39 THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATE.   Bqnk literally pulled up a blueprint overlay and you could very clearly see it did not fit into it
creations-chat 2022-04-05 18:04:15 I dont understand, how a person who has never made a mark in this world and was literally unkown until now, can be so confident and have such a massive ego.
general 2022-04-06 02:32:08 <@720891502108344360> you doing anything for the contest?

general 2022-04-06 14:22:44 Both me and hars dont play as much anymore
general 2022-04-06 14:23:39 Never
general 2022-04-06 14:24:12 Me and hars have completely different building styles
general 2022-04-06 14:25:16 Yes, hars builds in bigger peices, looks more robust, i build in many, many, more moving parts and it usually looks like it is quite fragile
general 2022-04-06 14:26:38 After the conpetition i may start on that porsche again
general 2022-04-06 14:26:54 I did really want to finish it
general 2022-04-06 14:27:40 You have a problem
general 2022-04-06 14:27:48 Yes
general 2022-04-06 14:28:10 Yes
general 2022-04-06 14:28:23 Yes
general 2022-04-06 14:28:27 An addiction
general 2022-04-06 14:28:37 A fascination
general 2022-04-06 14:28:51 Yes
general 2022-04-06 14:29:02 I was right
creations-chat 2022-04-06 14:29:22 He did?  Scroll up
creations-chat 2022-04-06 17:09:41 I downvoted cuz i didnt like the build. And your a furry. Why would you want to be a dog. Also if you are a furry then u are attracted to animals, and thats fucking weird
creations-chat 2022-04-06 17:13:39 Agree

general 2022-04-06 17:16:24 Fortune foxx's zeppelin
general 2022-04-06 17:18:02 Why no shape?
general 2022-04-06 17:18:31 Shit looks super blank
general 2022-04-06 17:22:12 Basically, its adding extra detail, but in the paint, so instead of a blank fucking peice of sheet metal, you add mud, soot, scratches, shit like that
general 2022-04-06 17:22:47 Please put some other shit on it, it looks so blank and un interesting
general 2022-04-06 17:23:33 Like a bridge on the top of it, or on the bottom, some sort of superstructure maybe
general 2022-04-06 17:24:06 No
general 2022-04-06 17:24:15 Yes
general 2022-04-06 17:24:35 Exactly
general 2022-04-06 17:25:28 It wouldnt be ao bad if your blimp was actually shaped like a blimp, but because you made a grey pencil, it doesn't look good
general 2022-04-06 17:28:11 They want you to help fix this guys floating pencil
general 2022-04-06 17:29:09 The best strategy
general 2022-04-06 17:29:58 Its even got the lil clip on the back next to the clicker
general 2022-04-06 17:30:50 The problem is that he made his flat, it should have been a curve the whole way of he was making it so plain
general 2022-04-06 17:31:58 The top of the blimp is flat, it should have been a curve
general 2022-04-06 17:32:37 Ye
general 2022-04-06 17:32:56 Idk, fortunes blimp is bigger than that
general 2022-04-06 17:33:01 And he did it
general 2022-04-06 17:33:31 None
general 2022-04-06 17:35:32 Wdym
general 2022-04-06 17:35:41 Oh

general 2022-04-06 17:37:04 If i see, a good railroad line, then im making a fully functional steam engine
general 2022-04-06 17:37:37 I would be best at it
general 2022-04-06 17:37:45 For sure
general 2022-04-06 17:38:21 Yes, a rally race that actually makes sense because the "hills" are actually mountains
general 2022-04-06 17:38:35 The current landscape i mean
general 2022-04-06 17:38:46 Yes
general 2022-04-06 17:38:52 Krup
general 2022-04-06 17:38:57 When pc2 comes out
general 2022-04-06 17:39:13 We revisiting the rally races, we doin offroading races
general 2022-04-06 17:39:38 I agree
general 2022-04-06 17:40:37 5v5 naval battles but you can use a ball because pc2 has colision destruction
general 2022-04-06 17:41:13 I hope we can get ballast balls so i can make an actual cannon for a pirate ship
general 2022-04-06 17:41:30 NOWAY

general 2022-04-18 20:27:32 The porsche will take literal months
general 2022-04-18 20:27:54 Due to my low motivation
general 2022-04-18 20:28:16 Perhaps once i start building i will gain more
general 2022-04-18 20:30:57 I have a building cycle: phase 1 :extreme motivation, work gets done very quickly: phase 2: motivation starts depleting, work slows: phase 3: work has completely stopped: phase 4: i pick up the project and it takes very long to make any progress due to me not being used to the motorlock tower quite yet: repeat step 1

contest-chat 2022-04-19 12:20:49 I just knew these monkey brains would see big ship and completely ignore its lack of good paint and shape
contest-chat 2022-04-19 12:21:04 Yes, i do too
contest-chat 2022-04-19 12:21:11 But the exterior is just
contest-chat 2022-04-19 12:21:15 So stinky
contest-chat 2022-04-19 12:21:26 Blank white paint
contest-chat 2022-04-19 12:21:31 Brick shape
contest-chat 2022-04-19 12:22:09 Literally the only good thing is the interior
contest-chat 2022-04-19 12:22:18 But big ship =win
contest-chat 2022-04-19 12:22:51 Cuz the paris class frigate is in second, and i hate the shape and paint on that one too
contest-chat 2022-04-19 12:23:10 But i think it's better than the white cinder block

contest-chat 2022-04-19 12:31:12 <@297120728342331392> honestly i rlly like the ship, it could use a few fixes here and there, but what really ruins it is the paint

bot-central 2022-04-19 12:34:24 Second place is a black pile of bricks with no interior
bot-central 2022-04-19 12:34:49 They are a good idea, people just cant build
bot-central 2022-04-19 12:35:21 Honestly tho i like <@297120728342331392> build, the paint is just bad

general 2022-04-20 01:10:45 🦧
contest-chat 2022-04-20 01:25:32 idk what they doing
contest-chat 2022-04-20 01:29:32 truly
contest-chat 2022-04-20 01:29:49 love it when i lose upvotes after the contest ends
contest-chat 2022-04-20 01:33:36 me
contest-chat 2022-04-20 01:34:04 yeah they closed the contest like 20 mins ago
contest-chat 2022-04-20 01:34:16 and then i lost 2 upvotes
contest-chat 2022-04-20 01:34:17 hm
contest-chat 2022-04-20 01:34:34 i wonder what could possibly be happening 🤔
contest-chat 2022-04-20 01:36:57 <@335599526414909451> contest ended my guy, ur a bit late tho, since it was meant to end about 25 mins ago
contest-chat 2022-04-20 01:37:16 yeah
contest-chat 2022-04-20 01:37:38 nice
bot-central 2022-04-20 01:39:42 yeah idk what they doing
general 2022-04-20 01:41:02 mods having trouble figuring out how to end contest rn
general 2022-04-20 01:41:04 so epic
bot-central 2022-04-20 01:43:26 -contesttop
contest-chat 2022-04-20 02:14:29 nothing is happening tho...
contest-chat 2022-04-20 02:14:52 yes, but its odd its taking this long
contest-chat 2022-04-20 02:15:03 usually its within like 30 mins at max
contest-chat 2022-04-20 02:15:20 u sure?
contest-chat 2022-04-20 02:15:29 maybe
contest-chat 2022-04-20 02:15:51 hmmm
contest-chat 2022-04-20 02:18:50 yeah
contest-chat 2022-04-20 02:19:05 the shitbrick didnt even look good.... why did he want that to get in....
contest-chat 2022-04-20 02:19:56 perhaps
contest-chat 2022-04-20 04:55:01 Ur right, its a detailed interior burrito, sorry
contest-chat 2022-04-20 04:56:27 Also i know this, i just think he could have chosen much better looking ships to build, i mean the thing its from has so many different ships
contest-chat 2022-04-20 04:58:06 That thing is not detailed on the outside
contest-chat 2022-04-20 04:58:30 Also why you argueing about this, the contest is over
contest-chat 2022-04-20 04:59:50 Its also like 6x bigger than my ship.... its kinda hard to get more detailed when ur ship is that much smaller...
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:02:03 Idk what you really expected out of it, its a medium size fighter with 90% motorlock, it would be physically impossible to fit an interior in that thing
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:02:48 I didnt want to make a big ship.... i had a vacation right in the mid of the contest so i had only a few days to actually build
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:04:57 And going back to the point you made with the "50 motorlock angles" for my specific plane, i did need that many to make it look like its supposed to, otherwise i wouldn't have used all them
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:06:00 What i would have done was add a bit of paint detail, even if its just slight it makes it not look like a matte finish, it makes it looks more real
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:07:15 I understand that the ship you were basing it on was already blocky, but yours just kind of made it look more angular
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:08:51 Idk these are just my suggestions, i dont rlly care what you do, its just my opinion
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:09:12 I would still do paint weathering tho
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:09:34 I never said that though...
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:10:11 Painting is everything
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:10:29 I should have had more paint colors on my red
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:11:11 Then why are you argueing, we focus on different things
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:11:20 Me, exterior, you, interior
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:12:32 Which is why i said i didnt like it, you shouldnt take it so seriously, im just some other person competing in a competition
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:12:51 However
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:13:01 There is a ship built by you that i saw
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:13:06 I cant remember it
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:13:15 Kinda looked like an axe blade
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:14:05 Yeah, i liked that ones exterior
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:14:24 That one was good, except for the lack of paint weathering of course
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:15:24 It was just my opinion, of course it was an over exaggeration, if you wanna see a real shit brick go to a public pvp server
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:16:28 I dont get why you guys are so upset about this
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:18:22 I suppose that's because you dont know me all that well, i just say dumb shit all the time with no real meaning
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:19:14 Btw, anybody know if puri is ever gonna announce winners
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:19:47 Puri is the one who runs the contest with rbk
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:19:57 He usually announces the winners
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:20:05 He did end it
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:20:14 He just hasn't announced who won yet
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:20:23 I suppose
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:34:44 Idk, contest stress maybe
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:34:55 But you weren't competing so idk
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:35:55 I seriously dont know what i did to offend you guys specifically, i could understand exqusyte being offended but idk what i did to you
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:37:29 I dont think ive been a shithead to you in the past
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:37:33 Lemme check
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:38:21 No, this convo was the only one where i mentioned you
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:38:55 I never did that
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:39:22 Ok
contest-chat 2022-04-20 05:39:24 Fair
contest-chat 2022-04-20 12:14:02 I think he fell asleep on them (he is very large) (lost in the maze of his fat rolls)
general 2022-04-20 12:19:18 Congrats pcc, your final active member who used the vc has just been perma banned, what do you even have left?
general 2022-04-20 12:21:41 Said some bad words apparently
general 2022-04-20 12:22:53 I do think you are right
general 2022-04-20 12:23:43 Who could that be 🤔
general 2022-04-20 12:25:35 Oh no....
general 2022-04-20 12:25:43 Why....
general 2022-04-20 12:26:13 Please tell me.... you didnt try to scale it to ur characters height....
general 2022-04-20 12:26:37 Because that maus... is flat as a pancake
general 2022-04-20 12:27:24 It is
general 2022-04-20 12:27:57 Do you even have the correct amount of roadwheels?
general 2022-04-20 12:28:46 Its incredibly flat
general 2022-04-20 12:29:20 Wdym how....
general 2022-04-20 12:29:31 Just look at it
general 2022-04-20 12:30:09 Its so thin
general 2022-04-20 12:30:32 Remake it all
general 2022-04-20 12:32:11 Roblox characters are like 4 foot
general 2022-04-20 12:33:00 **roblox characters are like 4 foot tall 3.5 foot wide**
bot-central 2022-04-20 12:34:29 -contesttop
general 2022-04-20 12:35:29 Fr
general 2022-04-20 12:36:59 Yeah, you scale the heigh based on roblox character height, but you don't base the length of the hull on the same measurement, which leads to it being super disproportionate
general 2022-04-20 12:37:36 Yeah, you scale the heigh based on roblox character height, but you don't base the length of the hull on the same measurement, which leads to it being super disproportionate
general 2022-04-20 12:38:45 You literally based it on how many roadwheels it had, so you should have measured with the roadwheels as ur scale
general 2022-04-20 12:39:48 Lowest graphics settings
general 2022-04-20 12:42:16 Its the same height.... you just moved the tank in the air
general 2022-04-20 12:42:55 Just look at a blueprint

general 2022-04-21 13:24:48 Unfortunately, it is way out of my build style, this whole contest selection is actually
general 2022-04-21 13:25:20 Yes
general 2022-04-21 13:25:36 I will try
general 2022-04-21 13:26:00 Yes
general 2022-04-21 13:26:11 They do
general 2022-04-21 13:26:29 Yes
general 2022-04-21 13:26:39 I dont think so
general 2022-04-21 13:27:03 Contest winners get access
general 2022-04-21 13:27:16 Hmmm
general 2022-04-21 13:27:32 I dont even know what expert supreme is tbh
general 2022-04-21 13:27:45 Oh
general 2022-04-21 13:27:50 I dont think so
general 2022-04-21 13:28:49 Perhaps i start posting builds
general 2022-04-21 13:29:14 Fr
general 2022-04-21 13:30:56 Miner is the epitome of big build = win but his big builds still have all the little details unlike other peoples builds
general 2022-04-21 13:31:30 Standards are low now what do you mean
general 2022-04-21 13:31:51 Not true
general 2022-04-21 13:32:13 Hof is a lot easier to get into nowadaya
general 2022-04-21 13:32:28 Yes
general 2022-04-21 13:33:04 Half because there are more people which means you will get more votes, and half because standards have dropped
general 2022-04-21 13:34:17 No need, some of my builds already look like i used f3x
general 2022-04-21 13:35:44 Im in vip lounge to
general 2022-04-21 13:36:23 I can only try
general 2022-04-21 13:36:40 But a big section of vip lounge does not like me so
general 2022-04-21 13:37:38 I would dissagree, back then you were lucky to break 100 upvotes
general 2022-04-21 13:38:21 Even non meme builds
general 2022-04-21 13:38:39 A mid tier build gets over 100 easily
general 2022-04-21 13:39:14 Yeah
general 2022-04-21 13:40:04 Yes, most likely
general 2022-04-21 13:40:27 In what?
general 2022-04-21 13:40:44 Oh
general 2022-04-21 13:41:38 Yeah, a lot of members who were crucial to keeping pcc a good place to be in got banned
general 2022-04-21 13:42:33 Yeah, it just doesnt feel like pcc anymore
general 2022-04-21 13:43:41 I remembee the good old days of just vcing in pcc vc with friends
general 2022-04-21 13:44:51 It just seems like this server deteriorated a lot quicker than most
general 2022-04-21 13:46:12 Pcc timeline kinda remind me of elden ring tbh
general 2022-04-21 13:48:28 In the begining, the big people and pro builders were looked up to and respected, then 2020 came around, lots of p bans and a large influx of unskilled players, then the server is just a wasteland and those previously looked up to and respected people are either gone or turned into assholes
general 2022-04-21 13:49:24 Vip empire chose to villian
general 2022-04-21 13:50:14 You never witnessed its previous gloryvthen
general 2022-04-21 13:50:28 Oh it was great
general 2022-04-21 13:51:57 Every vc was filled with one friend group all the time, people were active and didnt only build mene creations. The humor wasnt broken and unfunny. You were able to create some real friends through it.
general 2022-04-21 13:52:06 That's exactly it
general 2022-04-21 13:54:03 Ive been here since early 2020, before the great fall. And i have definitely changed. Ive gotten more skilled, but my hapiness with this server snd the game has only been on the decline
general 2022-04-21 13:54:51 Yeah thats pretty much what happened
general 2022-04-21 13:56:03 A lot of my online friend group came from this game, this community, its a real shame it cant be like it used to
general 2022-04-21 13:58:29 I originally joined as a lone person, i gained friends from just joining the vc and talking to them, helping them, getting help from them, weve just kinda stuck around eachother since then
general 2022-04-21 13:59:10 No
general 2022-04-21 13:59:17 Don't mention that one
general 2022-04-21 13:59:34 Hes fallen to the lowest of low
general 2022-04-21 13:59:44 You dont want to see him
general 2022-04-21 14:00:04 Hes turned into a massive ass
general 2022-04-21 14:00:16 Not fun to be around
general 2022-04-21 14:00:53 Yes
general 2022-04-21 14:04:44 Jojo.... good he was terrible
general 2022-04-21 14:06:32 Xx jojoxx35 once said that triple wishbone suspension was better than double wishbone, even tho triple wishbone just adds more weight to double wishbone
general 2022-04-21 14:07:15 Yeah
general 2022-04-21 14:07:27 And then claimed they were good
general 2022-04-21 14:07:36 No

general 2022-04-21 14:16:09 I've never found one worse
general 2022-04-21 14:18:19 That's a perfect description
general 2022-04-21 14:18:40 Yeah
general 2022-04-21 14:19:17 For me it was the problem solving part of it
general 2022-04-21 14:19:25 I loved complex stuff

general 2022-04-27 13:20:06 No, it was for racing
general 2022-04-27 13:20:56 80%of its buyers were track companies, the 20% was rally, so they were building for racing
general 2022-04-27 13:21:04 Ye it was
general 2022-04-27 13:22:10 I rlly want a 959, too bad they never sold them in the US

general 2022-04-27 13:27:03 The 917 is just a racing legend
general 2022-04-27 13:27:14 The k varient
general 2022-04-27 13:27:42 The k counted as a sports car due to loopholes in rules
general 2022-04-27 13:27:53 It was
general 2022-04-27 13:27:58 Amaze
general 2022-04-27 13:28:21 They were allowed bigger engines if they could pass it off as a sports car
general 2022-04-27 13:28:30 So they worked around it
general 2022-04-27 13:29:18 And then it got a v12 bcuz they put 2 of their inline 6s together
general 2022-04-27 13:29:19 Looo

general 2022-04-27 13:45:19 Use motor angle
general 2022-04-27 13:45:28 To make gears
general 2022-04-27 13:46:08 0 slip with fabric is not easy
general 2022-04-27 13:50:23 There was one time tho, that i managed to get the fabric gears phase into eachother, and they wouldn't slip, but i don't remember the mechanism for it <@668314196764655618>
general 2022-04-27 13:51:05 It wasn't motorlock it was something else,  like suspension and ropes or piston

general 2022-04-28 12:31:41 How do you not get this
general 2022-04-28 12:31:56 It's probably from genshin impact or some shit
general 2022-04-28 12:32:46 Genshin is literally just an anime game... hes worse than i thought.... he likes genshin.....
general 2022-04-28 12:33:40 Scrap being 14, there isnt a normal 14 year old that likes genshin, he's probably 27 and likes little kids
general 2022-04-28 12:34:34 Yeah, and they like to pretend they are females
general 2022-04-28 12:35:37 Based on ur pfp it seems like something you would do
general 2022-04-28 12:36:17 Anime pfp
general 2022-04-28 12:36:45 There isnt a single respectable person who unironically uses an anime pfp

general 2022-04-29 13:23:47 Just how many more reports spectrum had per day than everyone else
general 2022-04-29 13:24:18 First off
general 2022-04-29 13:24:31 What part do you want me to pick apart first?
general 2022-04-29 13:25:12 What part of what you just said do you want me to pick apart first
general 2022-04-29 13:25:31 Oh i know
general 2022-04-29 13:25:54 Ok, lets do that then
general 2022-04-29 13:30:44 So, if you use a basic motor they are able to create a large amount of torque, on an irl heli, this is controlled with a tail rotor that is hooked directly into the driveshaft so that the rotor and tail rotor are always perfectly counteracting eachother. Now there's your first problem, since you would have to control the pitch of the blades with control surfaces, it will suddenly create a large amount of resistance, thus leading your tail rotor to not be sufficient enough, and makes it very unstable and hard to control, fake rotors and hover rotors make it much more controlae and at that point, function takes priority over realism. Tldr, basic motors are hard to control and hover rotors perform better, and most times, look better than basic motors
general 2022-04-29 13:31:53 Argument destroyed
general 2022-04-29 13:33:23 Germany br 6.3
general 2022-04-29 13:33:38 For ground

general 2022-04-29 13:34:03 No
general 2022-04-29 13:34:18 I hate 262
general 2022-04-29 13:34:27 Horten is what i use
general 2022-04-29 13:34:34 Me
general 2022-04-29 13:35:07 Can't be counteracted well
general 2022-04-29 13:35:54 It would take much more effort for something that wouldn't fly that well
general 2022-04-29 13:36:11 Also, you are missing another major problem with single rotor helis
general 2022-04-29 13:36:51 Dysymmetry of lift
general 2022-04-29 13:37:54 They do change rpm
general 2022-04-29 13:37:56 But
general 2022-04-29 13:37:59 In pc
general 2022-04-29 13:38:06 The problem is the resistance
general 2022-04-29 13:38:48 In a real heli, when you add more pitch to your main rotor it would also add more pitch to your tail rotor so its balanced
general 2022-04-29 13:38:58 But in pc we don't have that level of control
general 2022-04-29 13:39:10 So it is near impossible
general 2022-04-29 13:40:22 Also back to hover powered looks, if you are building a bigger heli, you can actually hide the hovers inside the body of the heli
general 2022-04-29 13:41:13 Fr
general 2022-04-29 13:42:24 <@434843195025653762> tbh, you are trying to argue something that you yourself cant do, unless you can (which i would like to see)

general 2022-04-29 13:49:29 I think
general 2022-04-29 13:49:51 Doesn't matter since german spaa teammates can't aim
general 2022-04-29 13:50:18 Ok so the p51 then
general 2022-04-29 13:51:45 Lets go over the last 109, the k4 varient,  br 5.7, gets uptiered every match since its just about the only 5.7 plane, then it faces the p51 h, which out speeds the 109, out climbs it, out guns it, and out speeds it
general 2022-04-29 13:52:18 <@315262125113081856>

general 2022-04-29 13:52:39 No
general 2022-04-29 13:53:04 You just can't beat it
general 2022-04-29 13:53:18 Atleast they don't climb
general 2022-04-29 13:53:30 Meh
general 2022-04-29 13:53:51 The p51 out turns the 109
general 2022-04-29 13:54:07 Its just a better aircraft
general 2022-04-29 13:54:23 Even that doesn't work
general 2022-04-29 13:54:29 Since they out climb
general 2022-04-29 13:54:34 It does
general 2022-04-29 13:54:50 109 performs like doodoo at low alt
general 2022-04-29 13:55:09 Cant
general 2022-04-29 13:55:16 Can't
general 2022-04-29 13:55:28 Im on phone
general 2022-04-29 13:55:46 Xenox24
general 2022-04-29 13:56:06 I think
general 2022-04-29 13:56:51 You cant boom and zoom them, since they can just climb after you and kill you with their 584266 .50 cals
general 2022-04-29 13:57:15 You cant pick a different target, since they outspeed you and will go for you
general 2022-04-29 13:57:47 It is just gaijin bad matchmaking
general 2022-04-29 13:57:56 Very nerd man
general 2022-04-29 13:58:20 Xenox248 then
general 2022-04-29 13:58:29 Its one of those
general 2022-04-29 13:59:07 Hmmm
general 2022-04-29 13:59:39 Just look up xenox and show me what you see
general 2022-04-29 14:00:32 Uh
general 2022-04-29 14:01:15 Lemme look for some screenshots with my name
general 2022-04-29 14:02:19 It doesn't
general 2022-04-29 14:02:33 Not better than the p51 h
general 2022-04-29 14:04:51 In game?
general 2022-04-29 14:05:03 Don't trust the stats
general 2022-04-29 14:05:26 ?
general 2022-04-29 14:05:32 Perhaps
general 2022-04-29 14:05:43 Hmmm
general 2022-04-29 14:06:19 Tombstone was one of my favorites
general 2022-04-29 14:06:51 I dont watch so much anymore
general 2022-04-29 14:07:01 But i used to watch a little
general 2022-04-29 14:07:07 I just don't have time
general 2022-04-29 14:07:21 No
general 2022-04-29 14:07:24 I know it's good
general 2022-04-29 14:07:32 I just don't watch TV anymore
general 2022-04-29 14:08:09 Indeed
general 2022-04-29 14:08:45 Stat card will lie
general 2022-04-29 14:09:24 <@315262125113081856> have you not seen the horten stat card?
general 2022-04-29 14:09:46 Only if ur climbing at the wrong speed
general 2022-04-29 14:11:40 Even if it does climb better, the difference is not enough for the 109 to be safe from the p51 just poinying more up and shooting
general 2022-04-29 14:11:59 And there are still all the other advantages it has
general 2022-04-29 14:12:50 You have to, bcuz ur entire team is the stupid shnell bomber
general 2022-04-29 14:13:20 If you lose those bombers you lose the game
general 2022-04-29 14:13:52 That's easy to say when it's only like 3
general 2022-04-29 14:14:24 The shnell has like 6-8 people playing it per match
general 2022-04-29 14:15:04 What br the f82
general 2022-04-29 14:15:13 Ok
general 2022-04-29 14:15:34 1v1 me later against my 109
general 2022-04-29 14:16:28 Ok i use horten with 12 second tyrn time
general 2022-04-29 14:16:51 Its a flying wing
general 2022-04-29 14:16:56 With 30s
general 2022-04-29 14:17:05 Dont matter
general 2022-04-29 14:17:09 Can just dodge
general 2022-04-29 14:17:20 I can allways dog
general 2022-04-29 14:17:55 It won't matter
general 2022-04-29 14:18:07 The lower my speed, the better i turn
general 2022-04-29 14:18:43 This is false
general 2022-04-29 14:18:48 I out turn a few
general 2022-04-29 14:18:59 That's an i15
general 2022-04-29 14:19:10 That has a stall speed of 80km/h
general 2022-04-29 14:19:23 Not a fair fight
general 2022-04-29 14:19:30 No
general 2022-04-29 14:19:50 False
general 2022-04-29 14:19:55 You cannot turn better either
general 2022-04-29 14:21:44 Turnfight my bv238
general 2022-04-29 14:22:10 (turns better than some fighters)
general 2022-04-29 14:22:18 No

general 2022-04-29 14:27:15 Not that
general 2022-04-29 14:27:25 Yes
general 2022-04-29 14:27:56 Better
general 2022-04-29 14:28:12 Bovertot tank musem
general 2022-04-29 14:29:13 Not same way
general 2022-04-30 19:40:05 hi
general 2022-04-30 20:00:40 sure
general 2022-04-30 20:02:04 exactly
general 2022-04-30 20:03:53 xenox248
general 2022-04-30 20:05:24 yes
general 2022-04-30 20:19:47 <@315262125113081856> lost visual
general 2022-04-30 20:20:38 so as you can see, it is quite the unfair battle
general 2022-04-30 20:21:13 thats because the 109 doesnt dogfight
general 2022-04-30 20:21:16 at all
general 2022-04-30 20:21:33 what 109 was he using
general 2022-04-30 20:22:40 <@315262125113081856> the only strat that works against a p51 is that strat i used at the end, and that doesnt work in air rb cuz ur entire team flies next to you
general 2022-04-30 20:23:01 yes
general 2022-04-30 20:28:53 <@315262125113081856> engine is dea
general 2022-04-30 20:29:08 lucky first hit
general 2022-04-30 20:29:39 thats bcuz i dont dogfight people
general 2022-04-30 20:30:25 the 109 isnt meant to dogfight
general 2022-04-30 20:30:31 its meant to boom and zoom
general 2022-04-30 20:30:46 thats why it worked against the p51 once i got it high enough
general 2022-04-30 20:32:55 because its fast, and has 5 guns, 3 of which are 20s with explosive rounds
general 2022-04-30 20:33:55 you are asking someone to dogfight who plays a 109 like its meant to be played
general 2022-04-30 20:43:35 <@315262125113081856> you see what i mean now? you are simply asking someone who uses planes that dont dogfight, to use dogfighting tactics, which i dont use
general 2022-04-30 20:43:55 they boom and zoom much better
general 2022-04-30 20:44:36 and dogfighting burns through speed, if i can boom and zoom i can go from one plane kill to the next
general 2022-04-30 20:45:26 it still goes thru speed
general 2022-04-30 20:46:38 no, i just climb, since the 109 will outclimb everything'
general 2022-04-30 20:46:59 and i never put myself in a situation where i need to dogfight cuz i dont lose my speed by turning
general 2022-04-30 20:47:47 none
general 2022-04-30 20:48:24 because i have no need for it yet
general 2022-04-30 20:48:44 the 109s are all rlly good boom and zoom aircraft that outclimb 99% of things at the br
general 2022-04-30 20:48:53 so i dont need to dogfight'
general 2022-04-30 20:50:08 ok
general 2022-04-30 20:51:02 dont have any 3.7 planes
general 2022-04-30 20:51:04 ive got 4.0

creations-chat 2022-05-03 12:29:45 Waddle dee
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:31:05 Use ropes in ur cannon wells to act like the fabric that they use to cover it
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:31:35 Also yes, use motorlock for this
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:31:58 Sure
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:32:46 The one main thing i would do would be to make the cannons have their mantlets so that is not just a cylinder in an opening
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:32:50 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:32:56 U need motorlock for that
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:33:00 In fact
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:33:10 I think cylinders are too big for that
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:33:27 You might wanna use disconnectors or sparklers
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:34:27 Uh, im on phone rn and i can't play rn
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:34:39 Ill just try to explain it
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:35:20 So what you need to do is motorlock a rope block with full thickness inside the cannon opening
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:35:53 Since rope has no colision it will look more like its just fabric attached
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:36:37 And the other thing i would do is make the rotation point of the cannons closer to the end of the turret so that you can get more elevation
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:37:01 And if u do that you can make the turret mantlets
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:37:39 Basically just make the end of the barrel that is inside the turret have a rounded shape that fits in the turret
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:37:56 You can find that sort of thing on other people's ships
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:38:30 Ok, its gonna be a while, like multiple hours
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:39:44 No image perms
events-chat 2022-05-03 12:40:29 Trust me is already fixed
events-chat 2022-05-03 12:40:48 He faced my prototype smee and got flung over rails
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:41:23 Tiger 2 turret shape is annoying to do accurate
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:41:53 Very easy if you know how to motorlock and motor angle but you said you werent into motorlock yet
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:44:14 Motorlock is more of a learning process, you cant really just show someone how to motorlock and have them know how that works, so its pretty hard to teach to newer players
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:45:13 I mean you can be shown the basics and know how to get it to work, but for you to be a good builder you really have to understand what you're motorlock is doing and where it is going
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 12:46:30 He need help
general 2022-05-03 12:48:22 Why so many blocks
general 2022-05-03 12:48:26 What even is it
general 2022-05-03 12:48:56 Unnecisary 1x1 blocks
general 2022-05-03 12:49:05 Yes
general 2022-05-03 12:49:24 What is the build
general 2022-05-03 12:49:45 Oh its a building nvm that makes sense
plane-crazy 2022-05-03 13:30:45 Seig heil !
general 2022-05-03 13:32:48 Get a rank first
general 2022-05-03 13:34:06 Source? I made it up
general 2022-05-03 13:35:01 So, is it going to make the release date like planned, or is it gonna get delayed another year?
general 2022-05-03 13:35:40 Yeah
general 2022-05-03 13:36:07 And hes gone again
general 2022-05-03 13:37:32 Is your development going on time, so you think it is going hit your planned release date?
general 2022-05-03 13:38:27 Rick is not responding to me, he is scared
general 2022-05-03 13:39:05 No, don't the mods we have are already corrupt
general 2022-05-03 13:39:18 Puri
general 2022-05-03 13:39:28 Rbk isn't bad
general 2022-05-03 13:39:34 Not the worst
general 2022-05-03 13:39:52 Puri does a lot to spite me
general 2022-05-03 13:39:55 You dont even know
general 2022-05-03 13:40:33 No
general 2022-05-03 13:41:27 We cant get new ones, because they would come from this server,  and the people who aren't mods right now are terrible, even worse than the current mods
general 2022-05-03 13:42:33 I would much rather have the current mods than have the public here become mods
general 2022-05-03 13:42:56 I wouldnt want to be mods
general 2022-05-03 13:43:01 To much work
general 2022-05-03 13:43:07 And i don't have that time
general 2022-05-03 13:43:37 Would be terrible
general 2022-05-03 13:45:09 It would be nice if Rick would answer me, but i think hes scared

creations-chat 2022-05-04 14:27:48 <@743296813276200971> that is most definitely a tutorial man
creations-chat 2022-05-04 14:29:47 Looks like a tutorial to me, idk what to say
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:11:49 Unnecessary
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:13:17 Red devil is good tho
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:13:33 And saws do work... smee has 2 saws...
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:13:59 Indeed
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:14:26 Yeah idk why you wouldn't want
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:14:43 You should have just said no rerolls
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:15:59 It does
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:16:28 It does, look at the ends of the bot
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:16:59 They work the same in pc
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:18:41 Wdym how...
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:19:05 What is the difference in plane crazy. 
Go ahead and explain
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:19:29 <@801256789529722910>
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:21:07 Yes. In the real world, they work differently, but in plane crazy, what would be different
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:21:55 Also, that disc works like a saw, you can see that only the edge is sharpened, so it doesn't even work like most discs
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:22:32 I dont fucking know what that is
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:23:08 You still have not answered my question, how is it any different in plane crazy
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:23:55 Because a cutter in plane crazy will cut.... like a saw....
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:24:28 It doesn't work like that in plane crazy at all
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:24:51 Maybe the bar
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:25:14 Have you ever played plane crazy to realize how the physics work?
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:26:35 They work the same in plane crazy
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:26:59 Cutters
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:28:53 The cutters will cut like a saw will just the same
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:29:43 Have you ever played plane crazy
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:30:05 <@466793357318815744> i don't think they understand how the cutters work

events-chat 2022-05-06 12:00:10 He clearly did not read the event rules
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:00:50 And you have to make it as accurate the the irl bot as possible
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:07:36 What
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:08:41 Doubles the speed, halves the power
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:54:37 That's not how the motor stacking in plane crazy works
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:54:58 If you have 2 motors on top of eachother, both have 10 totque
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:55:17 That means that your top speed will double
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:55:47 But your torque will actually be half

general 2022-05-11 12:34:49 Him
general 2022-05-11 12:35:27 Yousuf, a bit of advice, buy the shittiest car you can find that still works fine
general 2022-05-11 12:36:08 Then If it gets damaged nobody will care cuz it costs nothing
general 2022-05-11 12:36:55 That works too
general 2022-05-11 12:37:30 When i got my license i had already been working and just saved up to buy a shitty car
general 2022-05-11 12:38:19 I dont even remember the name, but it was actual dog shit
general 2022-05-11 12:38:30 Like the ugliest shit you've ever seen
general 2022-05-11 12:38:40 It is
general 2022-05-11 12:40:19 I didnt have city busses when i was in school so i had to take the school system busses, and the kids on those busses are the most annoying shits ever
general 2022-05-11 12:41:05 Man

general 2022-05-11 12:46:56 Boxnes is here
general 2022-05-11 12:47:17 Now he's gone
general 2022-05-11 12:53:29 Pc2 is having a cyberpunk moment
general 2022-05-11 12:55:09 I really hope rick keeps the game somewhat simple, i don't wanna feel like im just playing roblox studio you know?
general 2022-05-11 12:56:08 Thanks
general 2022-05-11 12:57:58 Hey rick, are you going to do alpha testers? If so you should let contest winners or something test because we some of the best at breaking the game
general 2022-05-11 12:58:18 Incred
general 2022-05-11 13:00:31 I personally think contest winners or some other high ranks should get selected due to the fact that we would know exactly what to stress test
general 2022-05-11 13:02:11 Springs, pistons, moving parts, performance, map faults
general 2022-05-11 13:02:57 At this point I've done a lot of shit that's broken parts
general 2022-05-11 13:03:42 Ive shut down vip 1 with a build that used locked motors in the past, like i mean the whole server crashed
general 2022-05-11 13:04:05 It was a while ago
general 2022-05-11 13:04:10 I think it was fixed
general 2022-05-11 13:04:31 It was a problem with the locked motors jumping back
general 2022-05-11 13:05:24 It was me unfolding something, then my locked motors luanched me, and then the springs started freaking out
general 2022-05-11 13:05:52 That's not even a question
general 2022-05-11 13:08:02 I have high hopes for pc2 optimization, with current pc my 6.5k flying build gets about 50% physics throttle, in hoping to get under 20
general 2022-05-11 13:09:26 Oh big question here, were you able to fix tnt explode on contact timers, or is that a roblox issue that you can't fix
general 2022-05-11 13:10:41 Do we have an answer for this one?
general 2022-05-11 13:12:09 Hey rick how abour this
general 2022-05-11 13:13:56 Will the late tnt explosions when its set to "on impact" be fixed?
general 2022-05-11 13:14:42 Hes been ignoring mine too
general 2022-05-11 13:16:34 Hey rick, will the late tnt explosions when set to "on impact" be fixed in pc2?
general 2022-05-11 13:16:45 Ty
general 2022-05-11 13:17:21 Also, is the desync gonna be fixed?
general 2022-05-11 13:18:36 Ok, the real question now, in pc2, do we have 4x4 cylinders
general 2022-05-11 13:18:56 No
general 2022-05-11 13:18:58 Gross
general 2022-05-11 13:19:47 I dont but i can explain it pretty well
general 2022-05-11 13:20:47 You can notice it a lot when 2 vehicles are coliding, for example on my screen i go in front of a vehicle that's already moving,  and on the other persons screen i just ran into them
general 2022-05-11 13:21:30 Or another would be the guns, on my screen i could see that the other persons plane is torn apart, but on their screen they could be perfectly fine
general 2022-05-11 13:22:48 <@217336009455566848> is this a good explanation of what i mean?
general 2022-05-11 13:24:58 Rick has gone afk or something
general 2022-05-11 13:27:28 <@273536574770380800> rick has answered many of my questions, i feel pc2 is going to be good if we ever get it
general 2022-05-11 13:27:52 Ok so its not a pc issue, got it
general 2022-05-11 13:29:12 Oh rick, if you are still answering questions i got some about the map, not exactly what is in it or what it looks like, but about the quality
general 2022-05-11 13:33:13 So one of my last questions is about the map itself, i have already heard that there is going to be a race track, but what i want to know is if you used the terrain editor to make the track or you used blocks
general 2022-05-11 13:35:19 So true
general 2022-05-11 13:37:30 Rick has gone back to afk
general 2022-05-11 13:37:58 Wdym, this country is ass
general 2022-05-11 13:38:23 They trippin
general 2022-05-11 13:39:43 <@273536574770380800> rick has not answered if the race track is gonna be made of blocks or not, im scared he will say it was made with terrain editor
general 2022-05-11 13:40:18 I really hope not
general 2022-05-11 13:42:36 Not enough calcium
general 2022-05-11 13:42:41 Drink more milk

general 2022-05-11 13:45:41 SHIT YOUR PANTS ANYWAYS, IT MAKES YOU STRONGER
general 2022-05-11 13:46:05 Weak ass mindset is their issue
general 2022-05-11 13:46:57 If i go a day without cheese i evaporate
general 2022-05-11 13:47:29 Weak
general 2022-05-11 13:48:08 I would rather be a mutant that can drink milk than a normal person who shits their pants
general 2022-05-11 13:48:37 Fr

general 2022-05-11 13:50:22 Where you get protein then?
general 2022-05-11 13:50:41 Oh

general 2022-05-11 13:52:04 Amaze
general 2022-05-11 13:52:18 Is that just ground beef in a pan?
general 2022-05-11 13:53:11 Only if you catch it yourself
general 2022-05-11 13:54:35 Actually that reminds me, i need to invade one of gmans fishing trips
general 2022-05-11 13:55:15 It very easy
general 2022-05-11 13:55:32 You just need the right bait and right sized hook
general 2022-05-11 13:56:53 Ive been fishing since i was like 4
general 2022-05-11 13:57:09 Cuz i lived next to a lake as a kid
general 2022-05-11 13:58:09 I used to have blackberries growing on my backyard fence as a kid
general 2022-05-11 13:59:08 I can also do the eyebrow raise
general 2022-05-11 14:01:39 True shit
general 2022-05-11 14:04:06 Too real
general 2022-05-11 14:05:24 Rick has gone offline without answering my question
general 2022-05-11 14:05:57 We will never know if he used terrain editor for the race track
general 2022-05-11 14:06:08 I really hope he didn't
general 2022-05-11 14:06:31 Rick has confirmed that there is a race track for pc2
general 2022-05-11 14:06:54 I just wanna know if its made with terrain editor or with blocks
general 2022-05-11 14:07:11 If its made with terrain editor then I'm gonna lose my shit
general 2022-05-11 14:08:34 If they do then i will get around to making fully working steam train

general 2022-05-11 17:16:26 They have some weird extra calculations the physics engine runs
general 2022-05-11 17:16:48 So they have like 5x the normal block lag

general 2022-05-12 12:30:32 Not that many
general 2022-05-12 12:30:50 I have well over 80 with all my combined accounts
creations-chat 2022-05-12 12:31:48 I have a 6k build that is the only of its kind in this server that hasn't been touched for 2 years.
So like i said, only a month?
creations-chat 2022-05-12 12:34:14 That's the point.... i was saying that a month isn't that long... how do you not understand this lo
creations-chat 2022-05-12 12:36:10 Using the term "solid month" does not mean exactly a month, it is meant to imply the importance of the duration of time. 
So im sure you can see the confusion, when you say that you meant it wasn't that long
creations-chat 2022-05-12 12:38:14 You just misused "solid month" that's all
creations-chat 2022-05-12 12:40:13 So true
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 12:43:22 Is that just your photo collection of worst pcc builds

general 2022-05-15 00:07:42 nvm i understand
general 2022-05-15 00:07:47 ye
general 2022-05-15 00:08:57 its not the same
general 2022-05-15 00:09:07 the friction block is heavier
general 2022-05-15 00:09:23 back to the diamond plate tho
general 2022-05-15 00:09:29 who spread the info
general 2022-05-15 00:09:38 and how has nobody tested this
general 2022-05-15 02:06:05 <@466793357318815744> this?
events-chat 2022-05-16 01:21:06 no joke?
on god?

general 2022-05-16 13:24:50 That but reversed
general 2022-05-16 13:24:57 Standards went down
general 2022-05-16 13:25:12 They did
general 2022-05-16 13:25:26 I see bad builds get 100+ upvotes daily
general 2022-05-16 13:25:38 EXACTLY
general 2022-05-16 13:25:59 See?
general 2022-05-16 13:26:36 Oh my g

general 2022-05-16 13:38:02 I wish
general 2022-05-16 13:43:22 Ive changed that, you guys don't even know the level of stupidity that tries to get in hof
general 2022-05-16 13:44:35 A fake calculator was the most recent vote
general 2022-05-16 13:45:09 Miner is the best low motorlock builder
general 2022-05-16 13:45:32 That's because he builds so big he doesn't need the motorlock for detail
general 2022-05-16 13:45:43 Vip lounge
general 2022-05-16 13:46:15 If it wasn't there then that calculator would have gotten into hof
general 2022-05-16 13:49:16 So true
general 2022-05-16 13:49:33 Im pretty sure it's not even a binary counter
general 2022-05-16 13:49:51 Its just a guy manually dropping red balls into a trough
general 2022-05-16 13:50:15 So real
general 2022-05-16 13:50:21 So real
general 2022-05-16 13:50:36 People are literal apes
general 2022-05-16 13:51:03 That's cuz it is
general 2022-05-16 13:51:10 No
general 2022-05-16 13:51:21 Extremely poopy
general 2022-05-16 13:52:38 Also, it was a contest build, the guy double submitted
general 2022-05-16 13:53:35 It's all just a mess in the other side of the wall
general 2022-05-16 13:54:22 There are much better builds that are in my save files
general 2022-05-16 13:55:04 So real
general 2022-05-16 13:56:11 Hars actually had a decent build, would have been better if he actually fixed what i told him to fix
general 2022-05-16 13:56:55 Hars was fine
general 2022-05-16 13:57:10 People are just sensative
general 2022-05-16 13:57:28 Can't handle the criticism
general 2022-05-16 13:57:43 Anyone who didn't like hars
general 2022-05-16 14:02:25 Gurt
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:15:09 <@466793357318815744> wait if the guy was cheating then what happens with the tournament
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:17:26 Also i find if quite funny that both people who were absolutely obsessed with battlebots were the ones who were cheating and got disqualified
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:19:08 What about my fight with him
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:19:25 Also what was he doing for cheating
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:19:46 The first fight on day 2 was me vs the cheater
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:24:40 I dont see what he did since hec was banned and all his messages are gone
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:27:25 How did he cheat
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:27:55 Extra balast? Higher torque and speed for motors?
events-chat 2022-05-16 14:28:17 I feel like that's what it was since i got flung so easily
events-chat 2022-05-16 15:58:31 Yeah that makes sense why i got flung and i couldn't fling him
events-chat 2022-05-16 15:59:32 My weakness with flinging was that if i hit a seperate entity like a thing on a motor then it doesn't fling
events-chat 2022-05-16 15:59:47 That's why is so hard to launch huge
general 2022-05-16 16:10:46 Magnet will win
events-chat 2022-05-16 17:05:53 Are you going to ignore the higher torque and speed on the spinner?
general 2022-05-16 17:12:10 Actual ape communication rn
general 2022-05-16 17:14:12 Mmmm burgy kin
events-chat 2022-05-16 19:38:11 Strange how a bunch of battlebot nerds show up randomly in pcc just for one event, they cheat, get disqualified, and then complain about how it's not accurate
general 2022-05-16 19:42:46 Phortoher
events-chat 2022-05-16 19:56:42 It was their own choice to participate tho
events-chat 2022-05-16 19:57:08 If they really cared all that much about the rules they wouldnt play
events-chat 2022-05-16 19:58:50 Well i mean, if you are going to join in the event then you accept the rules, thats how that works
events-chat 2022-05-16 19:59:08 Jrst cheated.... he didn't even win fair
events-chat 2022-05-16 19:59:37 Everyone else was fine with them, it was like 3 people that cared
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:00:33 Just seems kinda silly to me that you would join an event and not even look at the rules, and then say the rules are bad when you break them
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:00:57 Again, everyone else didnt care
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:01:25 The among us guy actually admitted to not even reading them
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:02:01 
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:02:17 This guy
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:02:50 That guy wasn't attack
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:03:07 It was a different guy, who agreed with attack
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:03:46 They act like the same person, that guy got disqualified before the event started tho
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:04:18 No, they arent, they just act like it
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:04:35 Honestly you kinda act the same too
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:05:37 Random swearing even tho the argument isnt all that heated, acting very high and mighty dispite not having any sort of record to back that up
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:06:13 What was it again?
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:07:11 Im not sure, i personally think he didn't, and he just heard the rules through other people, but idk, he might have read them and just chose to ignore them
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:07:43 He cgeated
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:08:27 Wdym? I said if he did read them that he just ignored them
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:08:49 Idk it just seems like he did it on purpose
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:09:31 He got thru multiple battles while using it, i just feel like it would be hard to not notice that
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:10:15 But idk, if it was accidental he would still get disqualified
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:10:40 He tried to rematch me but he got banned before he could
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:11:00 Yousuf to the rescue
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:11:16 Thats what they did didnt they?
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:11:37 I dont have any mutual servers so i can't message him
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:11:54 Otherwise i would rematch him
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:12:24 No? The last chat he sent was us trying to organize a rematcg
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:12:53 Detective yousuf
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:15:08 I would be down for that, i just want someone else there who can check his motor settings, just in case
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:20:15 That just brings up the question why you guys would care so much about this event, i mean we are obviously not going for realism, this is meant to just be a fun little event that wasn't meant to be taken seriously
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:21:33 Yeah but for an event focused on fun battles and building, its decent rules, and the majority agrees
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:22:30 Theres just no need to complain, this isn't like the extremely organized events you guys talk about
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:22:50 It was just a for fun evenr
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:23:54 Ah yes that was another thing i wanted to touch on, you guys obly complained about the rules **after** a few got disqualified or their ideas got shot down
general 2022-05-16 20:24:05 Shut
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:24:47 Yes
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:25:08 Weve done events in the past and nobody cared
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:25:39 And these rules were better than previous events
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:25:55 Was that on the first day?
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:26:10 Idk nobody complained about them
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:26:31 Idk about stuff that happened on day 1. 
So i won't say anything
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:28:37 What bonus did it get?
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:29:09 Wait what was the bot?
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:29:32 Can you send an image?
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:30:51 Oh, idk it was most likely because its a horizontal spinner but it weighs half the bot, it has a 50/50 chance of killing itself or the enemy
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:31:33 Idk then
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:32:13 But that wasn't what the original debate was about anyway
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:32:56 You guys just took this event too seriously
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:34:01 That's not the part I'm talking about
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:34:26 Im talking about complaining about the rules
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:36:18 I do agree with you on that, its very un honorable fight if my enemy suddenly weighs as much as all of new york
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:36:37 Thats what happened with me vs attack tho
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:37:18 Im not saying you are wrong about that
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:40:30 1st: it was listed in previous battlebot tournaments so people just assumed it didnt need to be mentioned 
2nd:Just made the fights less entertaining, upwards spinning vertical spinners were suddenly at a major disadvantage due to the main point of their weapon being null
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:41:40 Its more fun to see a bot fly across the arena than see 2 bots basically stat planted like a f1 car
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:42:03 It wasn't allowed in previous ones
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:42:34 He goof
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:44:35 <@466793357318815744> i do have idea for next tournament tho, a ship battle, but your weapon is a tnt cannon (i have several semi auto designs that would be perfect for this)
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:45:00 Amaze
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:46:04 Dont worry, ammo storage is modular
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:46:36 You can make it massive, you would be more likely to have the battle last hours than run out of ammo
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:47:18 A standardized gun and ammo storage would be needed, which i can supply
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:47:42 Agree
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:49:16 2 types of ship battles im thinking of
1: modern battleship kind of cannons
2: pirate ship cannons
(Would finally encourage me to build the flying dutchman i promised tooti)
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:50:17 I personally prefer the pirate ship idea (broadsiding monkeys)
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:52:28 
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:52:51 The him
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:53:07 Rick(jorts) (he wears jorts)
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:53:49 Incredible
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 03:12:08 m perhaps
events-chat 2022-05-17 11:54:01 Its just roblox desync
the-dump 2022-05-17 12:22:28 She did a lot more than stain the sheets
general 2022-05-17 12:24:56 Tuning
general 2022-05-17 12:25:59 Like i said, tuning, a lot of tuning, and proper weighting
general 2022-05-17 12:26:36 The real problem of those wheels is how much they expand
general 2022-05-17 12:26:50 Perhaps
general 2022-05-17 12:26:51 But
general 2022-05-17 12:27:18 With proper tuning  you can get the desired effect
general 2022-05-17 12:27:42 (The trick is to add a little friction)
general 2022-05-17 12:28:08 Hes talking about suspension being bumpy
general 2022-05-17 12:29:01 Again, you can do it just fine if your suspension is tuned correctly
general 2022-05-17 12:29:29 Also that suspension doesn't have a big weight on the end so it won't be all that bouncy
general 2022-05-17 12:29:38 Its just light blocks
general 2022-05-17 12:30:05 A piece of suspension with little weight on it won't bounce around
general 2022-05-17 12:31:32 But i do get what you're talking about
general 2022-05-17 12:31:44 Which is why i commonly use motor 2 suspension
general 2022-05-17 12:31:54 Much easier to tune
general 2022-05-17 12:32:09 Suspension
general 2022-05-17 12:32:28 Motor 2 on servo, low torque
general 2022-05-17 12:32:56 Think of it like torsion bar suspension
general 2022-05-17 12:33:48 You didn't already know about this?
general 2022-05-17 12:34:01 Damn i didn't know this was higher knowledge
general 2022-05-17 12:34:03 Uh
general 2022-05-17 12:34:06 Hold on
general 2022-05-17 12:34:09 Lemme give you
general 2022-05-17 12:34:17 Shitty drawing
general 2022-05-17 12:37:54 This
general 2022-05-17 12:38:24 Your welcom for the shitty drawing
general 2022-05-17 12:38:30 I guess
general 2022-05-17 12:38:43 What
general 2022-05-17 12:38:57 So yrue
general 2022-05-17 12:39:17 Turn down your torque then...
general 2022-05-17 12:39:50 I usually have them set at 0.8 for a medium sized build depending on how many wheels i have
general 2022-05-17 12:40:18 My tiger with 1k blocks has like 0.6 for all roadwheels
general 2022-05-17 12:40:48 Motors are just strong
general 2022-05-17 12:40:56 Much easier to tune tho
general 2022-05-17 12:42:01 You are just tuning them wrong
general 2022-05-17 12:42:24 Ive had motor 2 suspension work better than actual suspension blocks
general 2022-05-17 12:42:30 Ok first
general 2022-05-17 12:42:34 How heavy is the build
general 2022-05-17 12:42:53 Aproximate block count?
general 2022-05-17 12:43:08 So under 400?
general 2022-05-17 12:43:27 If so, add 4 full ballast blocks
general 2022-05-17 12:43:40 After adding that weight
general 2022-05-17 12:43:49 How many wheels do you have?
general 2022-05-17 12:43:53 Roadwheeks
general 2022-05-17 12:44:07 No
general 2022-05-17 12:44:12 I have simple process
general 2022-05-17 12:44:25 How many roadwheels
general 2022-05-17 12:44:34 Ok
general 2022-05-17 12:44:50 Set torque on the motor 2 to 0.7
general 2022-05-17 12:45:01 Make sure to add the 4 full balast
general 2022-05-17 12:45:37 (You can tune the suspension by decreasing or increasing the balast ammount)
general 2022-05-17 12:45:45 It makes it so ready to change
general 2022-05-17 12:45:51 And
general 2022-05-17 12:46:12 It preps your chassis for the weight it will experience when the creation is finished
general 2022-05-17 12:47:16 Ive been using motor 2 suspension for everything, i have a trophy truck where the back suspension is motor 2 powered and is so smooth
general 2022-05-17 12:48:24 I have a 180 block armored car with weights on it that uses 0.8 motor torque, and its one of the smoothest suspensions ive created
general 2022-05-17 12:48:35 Chassis
general 2022-05-17 12:48:48 No
general 2022-05-17 12:49:00 Motor 2 suapension
general 2022-05-17 12:49:23 No suspension block
general 2022-05-17 12:49:46 No
general 2022-05-17 12:49:49 Def not
general 2022-05-17 12:49:53 Trust me
general 2022-05-17 12:50:27 After work yes
general 2022-05-17 14:16:26 Until you encounter me
general 2022-05-17 14:17:25 I may not be good at turnfighting in the 109, but you will never escape my boom and zoom
general 2022-05-17 14:18:16 At our last fight vs your p51 i was loopimg you with boom and zoom wdym
general 2022-05-17 14:18:38 In the previous ones yes
general 2022-05-17 14:18:52 Also, it was p51 h vs a 109 k
general 2022-05-17 14:19:02 Not a fair comparison
general 2022-05-17 14:19:32 Yeah, because you said they are a fair fight
general 2022-05-17 14:19:44 I was showing you that it wasn't
general 2022-05-17 14:19:57 It doesn't climb better, only at high alt
general 2022-05-17 14:21:54 It doesn't
general 2022-05-17 14:22:33 Any person can tell you while playing the p51 that you can easily outclimb and out speed a 109
general 2022-05-17 14:23:06 I was out climbing cuz i had more energy
general 2022-05-17 16:16:07 Think of it like a hobby
general 2022-05-17 16:16:21 Yes
general 2022-05-17 16:16:53 Well, you wake up, do your job, hang out with friends, go home, do your hobby
general 2022-05-17 16:17:10 Atleast that's what i do
general 2022-05-17 16:17:14 Idk about tinon
general 2022-05-17 16:17:57 Amazing
general 2022-05-17 16:18:15 Never
general 2022-05-17 16:23:25 Furry....
general 2022-05-17 16:24:39 Why is the soup white
general 2022-05-17 19:27:28 It is totally me

plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:20:03 Imagine if we get the new map and the racetrack we got promised was made using terrain editor
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:20:24 Proof?
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:20:46 Source? He made it up
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:21:43 I might just off myself if the racetrack is made with terrain editor, ive had 2 cars that i would really like to drive on a hand made track
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:22:35 Do you know what i mean when u say terrain editor vs hand built?
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:24:31 Terrain editor is made with the literal roblox terrain editor, it is very bumpy, an example would be the mountain by the airport, an example of handbuilt would be the airport itself, being made of individual blocks
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:25:44 So the reason that a terrain editor track would be horrible is that the road would be very bumpy
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:26:21 If you go by the train tracks thats the tool he used for that. And that terrain isnt actually smooth
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:27:01 Yeah... that's hand built....
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:27:50 So im hoping.... that rick doesnt only use the terrain editor.... and he actually makes the track with parts.....
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:28:10 I think you misunderstood me somewhete
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:28:19 Rick doesn't trust people
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:28:52 Obc offered to help rick a while back and rick declined saying he wants to do it himself
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:29:05 For free
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:29:22 Obc is a literal coder....
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:30:11 Im not going to argue with you further if you dont know anything about this community
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:30:31 Hes very angry for some reason
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:31:11 Indee
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:32:26 He made a code to fix a problem rick was having with plane crazy a while back
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:32:49 I would have to sift through messages for a while to find what it was exactly
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:34:29 Alpha, the problem is that you have gone and showed that you are very high and mighty about yourself, get off your self made pedestal and talk like a normal person
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:36:18 I was saying that i hope rick used parts to make the racetrack and then some guy tried to argue with me about how to build with terrain editor even tho that was my argument
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:36:29 Idk i think he got confused
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 12:37:35 Indeed

creations-chat 2022-05-18 23:36:18 time spent on a project does not equal upvotes or apreciation, how your build looks will dictate how your build fares in creations, and unfortunately, yours just kind of looks like every single other airliner in pcc. it doesnt have anything special going for it
creations-chat 2022-05-18 23:38:43 if it did have an effect on upvotes then anything i post from here on out would get 200+ upvotes every time because i havent had a single new idea since 2020
creations-chat 2022-05-18 23:40:37 that is a 109 correct?
are you in vip 1 rn?
go in vip 1, im gonna make sure you dont mess this one up

general 2022-05-19 12:49:45 I would make a full on train if we had better track, i know how to make a "steam" engine, but if i make one i won't be able to make it around the turn

general 2022-05-19 18:17:48 Epic tactic: use a bomber and set convergence to 800 so you can defend yourself
general 2022-05-19 18:18:14 Switch to air realistic with your fighter and keep it on 800
general 2022-05-19 18:18:45 Even though you are used to 500 m convergence
general 2022-05-19 18:19:13 I play on 500 for fighters
general 2022-05-19 18:19:19 And 800 on bombers
general 2022-05-19 18:19:34 But i never switch them correctly
general 2022-05-19 18:20:00 So i never know what my convergence is ! Its a convergence roulette!

general 2022-05-19 18:23:42 I was playing ground rb in my 109, chasing some plane, he did a head on with team mate and teammate lost, the dead plane went forward, looked like it was just going to pass me then it cobra'd into me
general 2022-05-19 18:24:22 Lo
general 2022-05-19 18:25:08 Ive gotten 5 kills with the sturmpanzer by blind lobbing my 150mm shell into caps from behind a mountain
general 2022-05-19 18:26:08 I have a single plane kill with my sturmpanzer, needless to say the plane disintegrated
general 2022-05-19 18:26:51 Not as impressive as the 150 since the 150 is such low velocity

plane-crazy 2022-05-20 12:37:40 Ew
general 2022-05-20 17:12:28 Drift can be faster
general 2022-05-20 17:13:11 For example, a 4 wheel drift is the fastest way around a corner, rally has been using it for years
general 2022-05-20 17:14:16 No 4 wheel drift is different
general 2022-05-20 17:14:23 You put no counter steer
general 2022-05-20 17:15:50 Also you can 4 wheel drift in a rwd car
general 2022-05-20 17:15:54 Its just harder
general 2022-05-20 17:16:23 4 wheel drift just means all your tires are sliding, no countersteer at all
general 2022-05-20 17:16:40 Cant

general 2022-05-20 17:22:11 Was commonly used back in the tin can racing days
general 2022-05-20 17:22:20 Since they had no grip
general 2022-05-20 17:23:14 Its in a sweetspot between grip and drift

general 2022-05-20 17:31:43 Its a video of exactly what you wanted
general 2022-05-20 17:32:36 But you dont 4 wheel drift through hairpins, even in 4wd cars
general 2022-05-20 17:32:49 No
general 2022-05-20 17:33:06 You counter steer in hairpins
general 2022-05-20 17:33:27 I literally see the counter steer
general 2022-05-20 17:34:19 But thats not what a 4 wheel drift is for though...
general 2022-05-20 17:34:36 4 wheel drift is literally meant for more gradual turns
general 2022-05-20 17:34:42 Not hairpins
general 2022-05-20 17:35:31 Drift is sliding before the apex, powerslide is after the apex
general 2022-05-20 17:35:59 Normal drift is sliding and counter steering, 4 wheel drift is sliding without counter steering
general 2022-05-20 17:36:39 I just showed you a video of them tho
general 2022-05-20 17:37:20 Wdym
general 2022-05-20 17:37:49 No not you
general 2022-05-20 17:38:03 Tinon is confusing me
general 2022-05-20 17:38:34 Tinon, you cant just dismiss evidence by saying a car is bound to slide
general 2022-05-20 17:39:23 But it is though
general 2022-05-20 17:39:34 What do you think drifting is?
general 2022-05-20 17:39:44 Its sliding due to g forces
general 2022-05-20 17:40:26 Bruh
general 2022-05-20 17:40:39 Dismissing real evidence by saying you dont agree with it
general 2022-05-20 20:27:11 Just a differential?
general 2022-05-20 20:27:28 You neded 100 blocks to make a differential
general 2022-05-20 20:27:31 What
general 2022-05-20 20:27:32 Ok

plane-crazy 2022-05-24 00:21:09 Thats like me saying my muscles are engines
plane-crazy 2022-05-24 00:21:13 No
plane-crazy 2022-05-24 00:21:27 Its like ne saying me moving a block is an engine
general 2022-05-24 12:46:57 Not random
general 2022-05-24 12:47:05 I wanted to downvote it too
general 2022-05-24 13:02:58 Not possible to make without motor angled gears
general 2022-05-24 13:03:24 No
general 2022-05-24 13:06:21 Nobody in the history of plane crazy has ever used it
general 2022-05-24 13:06:34 Except for chumps
general 2022-05-24 13:07:01 Like i said

general 2022-05-25 15:37:14 You are the reason bullying in schools needs to be allowed
general 2022-05-25 15:38:12 That is an easy fix if you just don't allow people to buy automatic weapons
general 2022-05-25 15:40:29 What's even sadder about the furries in this server is that you know they are just kids who have never felt the touch of a woman and have turned to the dark side
general 2022-05-25 15:42:16 What no father figure and social skills does to a mf
general 2022-05-25 15:43:14 This is a false accusation
general 2022-05-25 15:45:13 Bully femboys, they might just remove themself from the equation if you are lucky

general 2022-05-25 15:56:57 Lunch break is now :)
general 2022-05-25 15:57:30 I do not believe this for 1 second
general 2022-05-25 15:58:02 Because pcc members are the saddest, most antisocial nerd i have met
general 2022-05-25 16:02:54 You better hope to never find me in a battle against you
general 2022-05-25 16:07:14 Chunk theory's best build
general 2022-05-25 16:07:40 So true
general 2022-05-25 16:08:09 This man has obtained such a low status on the social ladder in a matter of weeks
general 2022-05-25 16:08:31 Yes
general 2022-05-25 16:09:23 What about it
general 2022-05-25 16:10:31 You literally just posted a build that is better than what he built
general 2022-05-25 16:10:40 Lo
general 2022-05-25 16:12:21 I epicly failed to put more color difference in my reds, thats why it looks so plain, in game you can see dark spots but in the images i don't see them as clearly
general 2022-05-25 16:13:08 Truly an amazing country aren't we
general 2022-05-25 16:14:49 I like how my builds that were completed in 2020 are still better than a majority of peoples builds now
general 2022-05-25 16:16:30 Hey where did you go, you were trying to prove a point
general 2022-05-25 16:17:45 I have not built a single new idea since 2020, my build im currently working on is literally from late 2020 and I'm just continuing it
general 2022-05-25 16:18:58 I burnt out all my ideas
general 2022-05-25 16:19:49 Dont
general 2022-05-25 16:20:16 HEY THAT'S MY LINE
general 2022-05-25 16:20:55 No
general 2022-05-25 16:21:02 You should, not build a modern jet
general 2022-05-25 16:21:30 Make with hover engine
general 2022-05-25 16:21:41 No
general 2022-05-25 16:21:49 The spinny hover enginr
general 2022-05-25 16:21:53 The one i use
general 2022-05-25 16:22:29 It better
general 2022-05-25 16:22:31 Otherwise
general 2022-05-25 16:22:34 I will kill
general 2022-05-25 16:23:15 WHERE
general 2022-05-25 16:28:53 I hope a 109 comes out of nowhere
general 2022-05-25 16:29:12 Italy
events-chat 2022-05-25 19:38:30 Make that
general 2022-05-25 23:49:43 ok
events-chat 2022-05-26 00:31:23 require the use of a hover engine of my design
events-chat 2022-05-26 12:23:20 Maybe would put some people in their place
events-chat 2022-05-26 12:23:40 <@466793357318815744> what if, tier list on pcc building skill
events-chat 2022-05-26 12:24:09 Would be incredibly more funny if you get to openly say f tier to soneone
events-chat 2022-05-26 12:24:53 The new pcc racism
events-chat 2022-05-26 12:25:45 Its a caste system, give f tiers an epsilon role, and s tiers an alpha role
general 2022-05-26 12:27:08 Wait what
general 2022-05-26 12:27:18 Since when is that blocked
general 2022-05-26 12:27:54 I was simply quoting the youtube video of how the old guy hides 3 bricks of "flour" in the retirement home
general 2022-05-26 12:28:54 No, surely not
general 2022-05-26 12:29:07 When was that word banned
general 2022-05-26 12:31:29 Ok

plane-crazy 2022-05-26 12:53:17 Thats gonna roll over the second you try to turn
general 2022-05-26 12:54:21 Average pcc build
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 12:54:56 Motor 2 suspension?
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 12:55:59 I just use motor 2 for suspension like that
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 12:56:19 Takes up less spacw
general 2022-05-26 13:01:51 Just use trapdoors...
general 2022-05-26 13:02:32 Wtf u on about? Ive never had problems with them
general 2022-05-26 13:02:49 You mean like wings?
general 2022-05-26 13:03:12 Yes
general 2022-05-26 13:03:22 Use motorlock to move them to the middle
general 2022-05-26 13:03:28 Easy fix
general 2022-05-26 13:03:56 Ive been using trapdoors since the dawn of time, and I've never had a problem with them
general 2022-05-26 13:04:36 Which
general 2022-05-26 13:05:02 What tank is it
general 2022-05-26 13:05:08 And how recent was it
general 2022-05-26 13:05:12 And who was it by
general 2022-05-26 13:05:21 No....
general 2022-05-26 13:05:37 You clearly have not seen my builds
general 2022-05-26 13:06:00 There is point
general 2022-05-26 13:06:08 It's called detail
general 2022-05-26 13:06:13 And accuracy
general 2022-05-26 13:06:20 Ohhh
general 2022-05-26 13:06:23 Hmmm
general 2022-05-26 13:06:52 Literally look at my only build in recent creations
general 2022-05-26 13:07:42 I dont think we have seen it yet
general 2022-05-26 13:08:20 My most recent build was for the contest and it took 3 days
general 2022-05-26 13:08:55 Actually skill issue
general 2022-05-26 13:09:24 No?
general 2022-05-26 13:09:35 Contest before this shitty one
general 2022-05-26 13:10:19 I just continue my ideas from 2020 whenever i get the motivation
general 2022-05-26 13:11:14 <@650085214705549333> you can also find my build in creations
general 2022-05-26 13:12:06 You are just mad for some unknown reason
general 2022-05-26 13:12:51 Some guy saying motorlock should be kept to a minimum
general 2022-05-26 13:13:47 No, i must use as much as i can so i can get maximum detail
general 2022-05-26 13:15:14 Yes
general 2022-05-26 13:16:04 Nonono, you are getting this all wrong
general 2022-05-26 13:16:20 The reason i don't use blender, is because thats too easy
general 2022-05-26 13:16:37 Plane crazy is a more difficult medium
general 2022-05-26 13:17:03 No? Doing it for my own challenge
general 2022-05-26 13:17:22 Blender is too easy to just do whatever i want
general 2022-05-26 13:17:26 There's no reward
general 2022-05-26 13:17:49 Plane crazy is more difficult, and thus feels more rewarding
general 2022-05-26 13:19:24 Im just an engineer with a short attention span, thats why that contest creation is my only finished build on that account <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-05-26 13:21:34 The one thing that i haven't built in pc yet, mostly cuz i know what i need to do for it to work and im lazy
general 2022-05-26 13:22:29 Its very simple once you actually understand the mechanics
general 2022-05-26 13:23:35 Jewish slaves in a german factory being forced to make a plane put of wood and glue, and then pissing in the glue so the plane falls apart mid flight
general 2022-05-26 13:24:01 Apex seals oh no
general 2022-05-26 13:26:24 Lightly used
general 2022-05-26 13:26:47 Slight dent on the rear bumpet
general 2022-05-26 13:28:25 Yeah basically its just moving the bottom shaft back and forth
general 2022-05-26 13:29:28 On a real car those lower gears are actually all free rotating until you shift into gear where they will anchor to that shaft
general 2022-05-26 13:29:31 But
general 2022-05-26 13:29:37 Plane crazy can't do that
general 2022-05-26 13:29:45 So don't
general 2022-05-26 13:34:05 You just realized?
general 2022-05-26 13:34:27 Hars was never bad
general 2022-05-26 13:35:19 People just hate him because he gave feedback and pcc doesn't know how to just take that and fix it
general 2022-05-26 13:36:24 Same with me, people hate me because i give feedback and usually its "start over with more motorlock" since the build doesn't even have a motorlock tower
general 2022-05-26 13:37:32 That will me in 2026
general 2022-05-26 13:38:38 Yes, it goes like this, someone asks for feedback, i give it, they deny anything wrong with it, they ask how to fix it, i tell them to restart becausr you can't make it better without more motorlock
general 2022-05-26 13:39:46 Yes, the restart part is after they ask how to fix it
general 2022-05-26 13:39:53 Read what i said again
general 2022-05-26 13:41:06 Read the beginning
general 2022-05-26 13:41:31 It says "they ask for feedback, i give it"
general 2022-05-26 13:41:40 As in
general 2022-05-26 13:41:49 Pointing out what's wrong with the build
general 2022-05-26 13:43:28 If the canopy can't be fixed without motorlock then im gonna tell them to restart with motorlock
general 2022-05-26 13:44:22 I am, your reasoning just doesn't make sense
general 2022-05-26 13:45:27 What you are implying i should do is bring my standards down to what can be done on a sub par base, you are asking me to make a shitty build into a mediocre build instead of a great build
general 2022-05-26 13:48:25 If someone asks me "what do i do to make my build better" im not going to give them an answer that doesnt produce the best result
general 2022-05-26 13:50:01 Why would i do that, i will give a person advice that will produce the best build, not the best build on their base
general 2022-05-26 13:50:28 That would be intentionally giving someone advice to make a sub par build
general 2022-05-26 13:50:50 Advice on how to fix it
general 2022-05-26 13:51:17 But it is
general 2022-05-26 13:51:56 If a build is as good as it can be on the base it currently has then it cant improve, it needs a new base to get better
general 2022-05-26 13:53:12 Then what's the point of giving feedback if they cant fix it without making another build
general 2022-05-26 13:54:05 EXACTLY
general 2022-05-26 13:54:12 Thats what ive been saying
general 2022-05-26 13:54:58 This guy thinks that saying "restarting the build is the only way to improve" isnt a valid piece of advice
general 2022-05-26 13:56:43 Usually when its at the best it can get with the base it has, so if a non motorlock build is as good as it can get, then restarting with motorlock is the only option
general 2022-05-26 13:59:27 <@650085214705549333> you gonna respond?
general 2022-05-26 14:01:22 Exactly
general 2022-05-26 14:01:34 Its usually a lack of motorlock
general 2022-05-26 14:01:52 Its terrible
general 2022-05-26 14:02:11 Its why ive rebuilt my bf109 5 seperate times
general 2022-05-26 14:02:20 Perhaps a 6th time is coming up
general 2022-05-26 14:03:01 Because i improve and the build gets out dated
general 2022-05-26 14:03:55 The 109 is a good improvement measurement for me, since it was one of my first builds
general 2022-05-26 14:04:26 The first version is still in pcc
general 2022-05-26 14:04:30 💀
general 2022-05-26 14:05:31 Think of it like starting up an old build but not remembering how you built it
general 2022-05-26 14:05:57 That's what its like for me atleasr
general 2022-05-26 14:08:10 Oh wow the 109s are actually a great benchmark, my first one was 0 motorlock, the second one was a bit, the 3rd was motorlock with a lil motor angling, the 4th was the same but a lil better, and the 5th was just that but to the extreme
general 2022-05-26 14:08:33 6th will now be my masterpiece
general 2022-05-26 14:09:02 That's why ive always used a single motorlock tower
general 2022-05-26 14:09:05 Straight up
general 2022-05-26 14:09:21 That's step one of every single one of my builds
general 2022-05-26 14:09:40 Potez
general 2022-05-26 14:09:42 Oh god
general 2022-05-26 14:09:52 The stinky twin engine
general 2022-05-26 14:10:24 That's literally gonna by 100% trails
general 2022-05-26 14:10:42 You cant stop me
general 2022-05-26 14:10:58 Ive slowly been doing more experiments
general 2022-05-26 14:11:26 I have an unfinished everything
general 2022-05-26 14:11:32 Name any german plane
general 2022-05-26 14:11:36 Im sure i have it
general 2022-05-26 14:12:11 I have a he 111 that was easily on track to be the best in pcc
general 2022-05-26 14:12:29 Hold on
general 2022-05-26 14:12:51 Yeah i have one
general 2022-05-26 14:12:54 Wip
general 2022-05-26 14:13:07 Ok well
general 2022-05-26 14:13:14 Thats the only one
general 2022-05-26 14:13:18 That i have finished
general 2022-05-26 14:13:35 No
general 2022-05-26 14:13:49 I have a tiger 1 and a jagdpanther in the works too
general 2022-05-26 14:14:02 Yeah
general 2022-05-26 14:14:31 I have a test bed to see if the concept could work
general 2022-05-26 14:14:36 So yes
general 2022-05-26 14:14:40 I have that too
general 2022-05-26 14:15:08 I can send a screenshot later, remind me to
general 2022-05-26 14:15:43 I think im gonna make the ho229 outa trails too, since its such an odd shape
general 2022-05-26 14:16:02 I am still at work
general 2022-05-26 14:16:24 I mean build the wing out of trails
general 2022-05-26 14:16:28 Angled trails
general 2022-05-26 14:17:26 Its mostly gonna be leading edge thats trails
general 2022-05-26 14:17:35 The rest will prob be wings
general 2022-05-26 14:18:04 Why use vert wings?
general 2022-05-26 14:18:27 If you angle the wings it works like it does irl
general 2022-05-26 14:19:08 The way it stabilizes is cuz if it yaws it gets more resistant on one side so it pushes it back
general 2022-05-26 14:19:24 When is flying straight it has least resistance
general 2022-05-26 14:19:31 So it just does
general 2022-05-26 14:19:37 Swept
general 2022-05-26 14:19:44 Look at the horten
general 2022-05-26 14:19:53 Thats how that whole thing works
general 2022-05-26 14:21:38 That's how flying wings stay stable
general 2022-05-26 14:21:51 And why you never see a flying wing without swept wings
general 2022-05-26 14:22:24 Rn? Just a starter job. But i will soon be going to college for some sort of engineering
general 2022-05-26 14:22:46 I know
general 2022-05-26 14:23:33 I dont know if i want to do military stuff yet
general 2022-05-26 14:23:52 Maybe just mechanical engineer
general 2022-05-26 14:24:02 A general engineer sort of thing
general 2022-05-26 14:25:00 Idk if i come up with some superweapon ill just end up like german scientists (ill be fine and have 0 consequences for the warcrimes i have caused)
general 2022-05-26 14:26:01 Indeed
general 2022-05-26 14:26:22 Its gonna be one of 2 things
general 2022-05-26 14:26:40 Graphic art, or engineering
general 2022-05-26 14:26:50 But engineering can have graphic art
general 2022-05-26 14:27:02 No i love graphic arts
general 2022-05-26 14:28:08 Most likely gonna do engineering cuz thats what i basically am (i have created every mechanism in plane crazy known to man)
general 2022-05-26 14:29:37 Literally every single suspension you can think of, i popularised the spinning hover engines, i made steam engines out of magnets, for christs sake i made an 8 cylinder working radial engine
general 2022-05-26 14:30:34 The hover engines i put in all planes that use radials
general 2022-05-26 14:31:07 Oh ye i also made the thin treads
general 2022-05-26 14:32:06 Ok i need to get back to work, lunch break is soon tho

creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:34:01 MAGNETTTT????
Wtf why would you magnet lock it
What even is magnet locking
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:37:05 Ok so its just motor angled trails with more steps
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:39:18 Show close up of the nose
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:41:28 Im trying to figure out what you made the nose out of.  
It doesn't quite look like trails but i don't know that else is would be
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:44:10 <@719168864705052802> are you able to tell what the nose is made of? Im on phone so i can't tell
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:47:27 I thought it was trails at first but the longer i look the more it seems like half wedges
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:49:30 Did he use my trail method with half wedges???? Absurdity !
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:52:23 Because he aaid its as accurate as it can get. And his cockpit is hilariously too small
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:55:22 <@718409831639154718> what he did is essentially what i did with that he 162 tail i made a while ago but he used half wedges
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:57:24 Also i think ive figured out what the hell he means by magnet locking
Ill have to test this out, i mean i knew they could do something like this but i just never thought of using it to hide motors instead
creations-chat 2022-05-26 20:59:25 No its too perfect to be that, if you did that you would see much more imperfection. 
I will explain once i get home and experiment to make sure im right
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:01:44 Yes im fairly confident i know how he did it now.
Just been thinking it over in my head and its a miracle nobody had thought of this before, its so simple
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:03:47 (Smoke pipes) the front and back isn't glass
Only the middle part isnt glass
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:05:54 Only the middle one is glass monkey
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:08:55 Ok i think i have an explanation for his "magnet locking" so basically you angle all the parts in build modecthen use weld on a magnet to anchor the angled parts to the plane, then you disconnect the motors <@770764150048948224> correct me if im wrong.
Epic, didn't even have to experiment
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:13:37 That's exactly it
Yeah tooty, that's about right
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:15:38 I thought you meant something different, sorry
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:18:18 Im not sure how i havent thought of this before, most likely because magnets are unstable, but i will surely be incorperating this into my arsenal of vuild techniques, though this will probably be more niche
creations-chat 2022-05-26 21:20:20 I mean i knew they could hold blocks in the air and it would look like it's cam locked, i just never thought of using them like this

creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:20:48 yeah no, if he were to get inventer then i would get inventor for making thin treads
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:26:19 the magnet locking thing he was talking about is real tho
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:31:17 that actually kinda looks like a landing gear
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:53:45 his story doesnt line up, because he said his cockpit was made of 2 wide trails, and then if you look in his build mode image its neither of those, its a cylinder thats not even the right size for the cockpit
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:57:25 first off: in the build mode pic you can see a bunch of yellow half wedges, those are meant to be his nose, first problem, there arent enough to make a full cone.
second, he has multiple little things sticking out that dont really make a whole lot of sense in plane crazy.
third, the cockpit story is so messy and doesnt line up with any of what he has said or shown,
4th, the tip of the nose would have to be a landing gear wheel for it to be that round, but if you look at the build mode, theres not a single one. 


case closed its not a pc build, he used his old build and modified it during the hour period that he didnt respond to make it look like what he had described for the build mode pic.
creations-chat 2022-05-27 00:07:01 yes
creations-chat 2022-05-27 00:13:32 the nose isnt impossible but i would say the cockpit definitely is
creations-chat 2022-05-27 00:15:35 looks like a fucking heat sink got damn
creations-chat 2022-05-27 00:17:50 very easy, just make out of trails

general 2022-06-02 12:00:09 I made a whole tail of a plane out of trails back in 2021
general 2022-06-02 12:10:43 Because trails are more adaptable
general 2022-06-02 12:10:57 Say you need a longer cone, just add more trails
general 2022-06-02 12:11:04 Hello mild

general 2022-06-02 12:13:01 That looks really easy with motorlock

general 2022-06-02 12:14:15 So basically
general 2022-06-02 12:14:22 You have to build it in 2 layers
general 2022-06-02 12:14:36 One layer is the layer outside the air vent
general 2022-06-02 12:14:54 And another layer faces inward toward the back
general 2022-06-02 12:15:04 And it will give that effect
general 2022-06-02 12:15:20 Or you could do the oppposite
general 2022-06-02 12:15:32 And use pistons to move that other layer out
general 2022-06-02 12:16:10 You just have to use a lot of motor Ansley
general 2022-06-02 12:16:15 Angle
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 12:16:43 I know, they obviously should have used more

general 2022-06-02 15:39:50 I dont do that since i don't build modern planes
general 2022-06-02 15:40:49 Its not the same style, a lot of camo on planes that isnt just monochrome is night fighter camo, and that's not possible to replicate in plane crazy
general 2022-06-02 15:41:17 Yes
general 2022-06-02 15:41:46 Night fighter camo is usually small spots, not big streaks of color like on modern aircraft

general 2022-06-02 15:44:01 I hate it when a mf says "no room" and then shows his half empty motorlock tower that is so space inefficient that its appalling
general 2022-06-02 15:44:41 Not even just camo
general 2022-06-02 15:44:48 Any sort of detail
general 2022-06-02 15:44:53 That someone says they can't add
general 2022-06-02 15:45:11 I hate it when people say roscaler
general 2022-06-02 15:47:42 Why do you have to roscale? You want good scale? Here you go ill tell you. On a wwII fighter aircraft the front landing gear is 1x1 half cylinder, on a heavy fighter - bomber, the front landing gear ranges from 2x2 - 3x3, there, thats what scaling you should use, dont use your roblox avatar, he looks like nicacado avacado put in a hydraulic press
general 2022-06-02 15:49:39 I hate a 1x1 wide fusulage as much as the rest, but why don't people just use an in game block for their scale instead
general 2022-06-02 15:50:17 Like i said, if you use something in game like a cylinder for a wheel, then you have the whole thing scaled out of you can do basic math
general 2022-06-02 15:53:43 Obviously never been in a relationship with a woman
general 2022-06-02 15:54:38 Show the plane on the ground

general 2022-06-02 15:55:54 Talk in plane crazy chat
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 15:56:15 <@842459687664222208> can i see the bottom of the plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 15:58:49 Are you gonna show it?
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 15:59:17 Not out yet
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:00:31 Ok so basically, your back wheels are stopping you from pitching up due to the weight of the front of your plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:00:40 There are 2 fixes
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:00:57 You can either move the back landing gear forward
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:00:58 Or
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:01:35 You can put some control panels in the nose
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:02:02 Those are your options
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:02:25 And this is because wing panels don't simulate lift
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:02:30 They simulate drag
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:03:36 So in a normal aircraft a wing facing straight forward will want to rise at speeds, however in pc, a wing only wants to go where it has the least drag
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:04:25 Another fix would be putting smaller landing gear in the back,  so that the nose points in the air
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:04:38 Like this
general 2022-06-02 16:08:23 Americans are the people who lift their truck and have never been spotted with a spec of mud on it
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:15:10 Did you do that last suggestion too?
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:15:34 Can't join
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:16:13 Mix the front control panel idea and  the shorter landing gear in the back
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:17:17 Reason?
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:18:11 I see
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:18:12 Hm
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:18:51 Did you try putting a bunch of control panels in the nose?
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:19:25 That should have worked though
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:20:09 Try moving both fear forward
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:20:13 No
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:20:17 Shut your mouth now
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:22:25 Gear
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:24:00 Ok move the rear gear a little farther back
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:24:50 Just dont do what that other guy said
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:25:29 Until its behind the center of mass
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:25:40 He has terrible ideas
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:25:44 Horrible
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:26:11 Its a pathetic way to fix it
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:26:17 Weak
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:26:21 In the mind
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:26:47 Turn that 180
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:29:55 Are the rear wheels turning the wrong way?
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:30:33 Does it even pitch up in flight?
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:31:03 Ok this sounds like a problem similar to my contest plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:31:30 Ok so you prob need more control surfaces in the back
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:31:46 Or you need more in the nose
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:32:07 No
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:32:15 Keep them where they are
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:32:38 The back
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:33:04 Im not sure
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:33:21 4 1x2 control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:33:24 Maybe
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:34:12 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:34:14 Do that
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:35:21 Also how much runway are you giving it
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:35:34 Wdym
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:35:46 Wdym falls to the ground
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:35:53 You mean it dives?
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:36:25 Put wing panels in the nose
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:36:32 Just wing panels
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 16:36:47 Yes

general 2022-06-03 00:53:09 i fixing pc
general 2022-06-03 00:53:16 so i get less random lag spikes
general 2022-06-03 00:53:28 then dont do that
general 2022-06-03 00:54:05 get in a german tank and slowly prowl around a city as you watch your br slowly drop as a bunch of nerds who believe too much in kruppsteel complain and get the br lowered
general 2022-06-03 00:54:34 yes
general 2022-06-03 00:54:40 teammates may be stupid
general 2022-06-03 00:54:44 but tanks are very good
general 2022-06-03 00:55:29 perhaos
general 2022-06-03 00:55:50 maybe i have a 50% winrate with every tank, maybe thats because my team cant do anything
general 2022-06-03 00:55:59 perhaps
general 2022-06-03 01:10:23 <@315262125113081856> i have better efficiency

general 2022-06-03 01:25:21 do i like that i face swifts? no
general 2022-06-03 01:25:33 amaze

general 2022-06-03 01:26:00 ok nvm
general 2022-06-03 02:11:08 ok
general 2022-06-03 02:17:50 hi
general 2022-06-03 02:19:15 8.3
general 2022-06-03 03:20:13 wtf
general 2022-06-03 03:20:15 also
general 2022-06-03 03:20:23 that missile missed my by a fucking mile
general 2022-06-03 03:20:40 aint no way a proxy gonna hit me from that far
general 2022-06-03 03:21:03 fucking monkey rocket
general 2022-06-03 03:21:25 i didnt have any choice
general 2022-06-03 03:21:34 the bitch is faster than me
general 2022-06-03 03:21:44 i cant catch him no matter what i do
general 2022-06-03 03:21:59 thats how they get on your tail
general 2022-06-03 03:22:19 yes but he can literally just fly off again and repeat
general 2022-06-03 03:22:38 that dont matter if hes already going 1k kmh
general 2022-06-03 03:22:48 he doesnt turn tho
general 2022-06-03 03:22:54 he just went straight
general 2022-06-03 03:23:01 and once he got 4km out he turned
general 2022-06-03 03:23:23 i fucking hate swifts
general 2022-06-03 03:24:09 someone please dig up some windmill member documents about a metal me 163 and give it to me so i can actually fly at a comparable speed
general 2022-06-03 03:25:13 that thing can go way faster than what its top speed says, that engine has no problem moving it over 1k, its just warthunder being a bitch and saying no
general 2022-06-03 04:15:37 <@315262125113081856>
general 2022-06-03 04:16:34 amaze
general 2022-06-03 04:22:23 <@454570394343702529>
general 2022-06-03 04:22:28 why the prop not spinnin
general 2022-06-03 04:32:41 4.3 maybe
general 2022-06-03 04:36:52 <@454570394343702529> im still alive
general 2022-06-03 04:37:35 wing overload after .01 second of turning
general 2022-06-03 04:37:42 so i just went back to airfield
general 2022-06-03 04:37:48 if game was gonna be a bitch like that
general 2022-06-03 12:29:34 Impossible
general 2022-06-03 12:29:38 That plane is so ass
general 2022-06-03 12:29:55 You must have been facing actual mustard brains
general 2022-06-03 12:30:15 Incredible
general 2022-06-03 12:30:36 262 is not a good plane
general 2022-06-03 12:30:53 Get the ho 229 as fast as possible
general 2022-06-03 12:31:23 Actually its not a bad plane, its just stupidly high repair cost
general 2022-06-03 12:31:38 And that's cuz they don't know how to fly it
general 2022-06-03 12:31:47 14k spaded
general 2022-06-03 12:32:18 Not on cold maps, ive held my wep for the entire game once
general 2022-06-03 12:33:06 The he 162 has a better climb rate than the 229 and the 262
general 2022-06-03 12:33:38 Me 163 gameplay is a shit show
general 2022-06-03 12:34:17 Half the time you play normal br and absolutely clown on people, and the other half you get sent to 9.0 and get missiled
general 2022-06-03 12:34:40 Yes
general 2022-06-03 12:34:50 2 versions tho
general 2022-06-03 12:34:57 8.0 and 8.7
general 2022-06-03 12:35:18 Mk108 is great for downing aircraft if you can aim it
general 2022-06-03 12:35:25 Mk103 is superior tho
general 2022-06-03 12:35:35 Same
general 2022-06-03 12:35:47 I know
general 2022-06-03 12:35:49 So sad
general 2022-06-03 12:35:52 Not rlly
general 2022-06-03 12:36:00 It still super good
general 2022-06-03 12:36:17 Gross
general 2022-06-03 12:36:22 I have uh
general 2022-06-03 12:36:31 5 jet
general 2022-06-03 12:36:47 I will say tho
general 2022-06-03 12:37:32 The ne 163 is so annoying whenever you need to chase someone, cuz warthunder limits its speed for whatever reason, prob cuz its a bitch
general 2022-06-03 12:38:05 The engine in it easily pushes it over 1k kmh, but warthunder forces you to stop at 940
general 2022-06-03 12:39:27 Real historical german AND allied documents about the me 163 saying ut was the first plane to break 1000 kmh
Warthunder: "i think it can only go 940 before the wings snap"
general 2022-06-03 13:51:10 When i done working
general 2022-06-03 13:52:26 This is exactly what you experience at rank V air
general 2022-06-03 13:52:44 8.0 germany never plays at 8.0
general 2022-06-03 13:52:57 There are
general 2022-06-03 13:53:01 No customer rn
general 2022-06-03 13:54:51 Main thing gaijin needs to fix is repair costs, there are some that just dont make any sense, like the he 162, nobody plays it, its not an amazing aircraft, yet its repair cost is 14k
general 2022-06-03 13:55:19 How
general 2022-06-03 13:55:25 Its not a great plane
general 2022-06-03 13:55:33 How tho
general 2022-06-03 13:56:38 I would say I'm pretty good at german air, which isnt turnfighting, and even i have trouble getting enough kills to surpass that repair
general 2022-06-03 13:56:49 Wow
general 2022-06-03 13:56:52 Hate them
general 2022-06-03 13:57:47 I really do love the plane, its just so expensive to play
general 2022-06-03 13:57:58 Like when we were playing yesterday
general 2022-06-03 13:58:37 With the me 163, my repair is 13k, i need a really good match to make any money from that
general 2022-06-03 14:00:45 Heres the problem though, high repair costs dont work, if you need 3 kills to match your repair cost, then it just cant happen, because everybody needs that many kills and there arent enough enemies, you are going to get 70% matches where your repair cost exceeds your earnings from the round, its a perpetual poor machine
general 2022-06-03 14:01:23 Agree
general 2022-06-03 14:04:33 Early german jets are the hardest to grind through, most of them underperform the american jets, and they have a high repair cost, you just lose all your money
general 2022-06-03 14:04:46 Fr
general 2022-06-03 14:05:45 Well, the he 162 is a 14k repair cost, the ho 229 is somewhere like 13k, the 262s are all somewhere in the 11k - 13k range
general 2022-06-03 14:06:47 Ho 229 is really good if you know how to fly
general 2022-06-03 14:07:34 Squad vehicle doesn't count
general 2022-06-03 14:07:40 Not in the normal tech tree
general 2022-06-03 14:07:53 YES
general 2022-06-03 14:07:58 IT SO FUN
general 2022-06-03 14:08:24 Yes but its not in the normal tech tree
general 2022-06-03 14:08:43 Again, it isnt in the normal tech tree
general 2022-06-03 14:09:16 Its not a required vehicle to get to another, you dont have to grind through that
general 2022-06-03 14:22:20 Rabit
general 2022-06-03 14:23:27 4.3 ground rb later?
general 2022-06-03 18:02:59 <@315262125113081856> i live
general 2022-06-03 22:30:36 cant

general 2022-06-03 22:31:01 my balance is 3k sl
general 2022-06-04 02:19:17 
general 2022-06-04 02:19:30 play 4.3 ground
general 2022-06-04 02:19:39 i can earn money there
general 2022-06-04 02:19:52 buying planes, playing me 163
general 2022-06-04 02:20:21 because repair costs
general 2022-06-04 02:20:44 i am perpetually poor
general 2022-06-04 02:20:47 forever

general 2022-06-04 02:30:30 ok you playing ground or no?
general 2022-06-04 02:32:13 funny when big bomb in ground battle, and then you send a tank flying
general 2022-06-04 02:32:41 funny when i find a silly little l3 at 5.7 and i use a 1800 kg bomb on it
general 2022-06-04 02:35:36 only thing i find annoying about ground is that i get the same 5 maps
general 2022-06-04 18:46:07 i hide and seek rn
general 2022-06-04 18:46:11 and still poor
general 2022-06-04 18:46:12 so

events-chat 2022-06-09 23:28:41 perhaps
events-chat 2022-06-09 23:29:00 but only have them be planes carried on your ship
events-chat 2022-06-09 23:29:16 otherwise its just 9 planes vs 1 boat
events-chat 2022-06-10 03:43:42 wrong type, that doesnt reload
events-chat 2022-06-10 03:46:25 not at all the same as what i was thinking
bot-central 2022-06-10 16:44:24 -servers
events-chat 2022-06-10 16:45:14 i will provide cannon
events-chat 2022-06-10 18:49:49 ok, so basically its a ship battle, but you have to use regulation tnt cannons as your weapons, no other choices. ammo storage will also be regulation.
events-chat 2022-06-10 18:51:52 theres 2 main ideas for the types of ships
events-chat 2022-06-10 18:52:24 we can either have it pirate ship themed, cuz i have a cannon for that, or it can be more modern themed, cuz i also have a cannon for that
events-chat 2022-06-10 18:59:31 the chances of running out of ammo are slim
events-chat 2022-06-10 19:11:32 no
events-chat 2022-06-10 19:11:48 bad idea, horrible idea even
events-chat 2022-06-10 19:16:55 or you just
events-chat 2022-06-10 19:17:11 dont run out of ammo, because you arent firing it like a machine gun
events-chat 2022-06-10 19:50:08 no my cannons make you load a shell into the chamber
events-chat 2022-06-10 19:50:32 manually

general 2022-06-14 13:36:31 oh no
general 2022-06-14 13:36:40 why have you
general 2022-06-14 13:36:43 ping me
general 2022-06-14 13:37:19 there has to be some other reason
general 2022-06-14 13:37:56 you are a being of malice, one not to be trusted
general 2022-06-14 13:38:54 idk what that means
general 2022-06-14 13:39:08 no it would be nice though
general 2022-06-14 13:39:24 currently im rocking the
general 2022-06-14 13:39:38 6.7 lineup
general 2022-06-14 13:39:41 dont mind the sturmy
general 2022-06-14 13:40:04 hello gamma rad
general 2022-06-14 13:40:33 the porky
general 2022-06-14 13:41:15 oh no
general 2022-06-14 13:41:17 its him
general 2022-06-14 13:41:18 the guy
general 2022-06-14 13:41:20 the man
general 2022-06-14 13:41:22 the myth
general 2022-06-14 13:56:33 yes definitely, my round that goes through just about anything suffers
general 2022-06-14 13:57:21 its not that bad
general 2022-06-14 13:57:31 you just go for the mantlet
general 2022-06-14 13:57:41 its only uptiers for you guys that you really suffer
general 2022-06-14 13:58:19 cuz i know the stuff at 6.7 will punch through that mantlet
general 2022-06-14 13:59:16 the reason i bring that sturmy is cuz german team gets spawncamped often, and the sturmy can kill in one shot so its basically a free 50k
general 2022-06-14 13:59:45 why u bringing a 4.3 gun then
general 2022-06-14 14:04:08 that being said though.... its not easy playing germany. not because the vehicles are bad, but because your teammates are so dogshit that you get a 50% winrate every time
general 2022-06-14 14:04:35 no it wont
general 2022-06-14 14:04:42 but theres really nothing you can do
general 2022-06-14 14:04:50 the germans think their tanks are bunkers
general 2022-06-14 14:04:56 and therefor play like them
general 2022-06-14 14:05:04 by not listening to a single thing said in chat
general 2022-06-14 14:05:19 and doing the most batshit crazy manuevers that never work
general 2022-06-14 14:05:31 literally

events-chat 2022-07-22 15:48:21 no, 90% of pcc doesnt have the brain power to skip a rock, so this wont work

general 2022-07-26 20:21:18 well yes that was me
general 2022-07-26 20:22:24 doubt
general 2022-07-26 20:23:33 they changed it because thats all it was used for, nobody ever really used it for any real feedback
general 2022-07-26 20:24:48 i go back into the depths of this server now
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:29:53 <@617498718417190943> you said theres a transmission.... where is it.....https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1001313486523072632  
thats not a transmission.....
thats called a driveshaft.... and an axle.....
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:32:37 that just looks like the average malaysian car
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:34:41 LOOOOOOOO THATS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO HOW A REVERSE GEAR WORKS LOOOOO also theres still no transmission in that one. ok dude i want you to go look up a transmission right now and then come back and apologize for your stupidity
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:36:42 <@617498718417190943> read this. 
thats not a transmission tho, thats you moving your driveshaft side to side
what you have there is an engine, a clutch, a driveshaft, and 2 axles
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:39:19 also, my friend made a working pendulum clock with gears with teeth, so gears are possible, you just evidently didnt try hard enough
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:41:20 forgotten is right, its more similar to a differential, but i want you to tell me where you see anything on your build similar to this
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:43:25 how thick is the tail section
creations-chat 2022-07-26 20:45:53 i was talking about the original, you seem to think that a driveshaft is the same thing as a transmission. <@883063424614006878> you can make one, you need a lot of motorlock tho to make the gears correct
creations-chat 2022-07-26 21:06:56 looks good just make sure it doesnt end up 1 wide in the tail
events-chat 2022-07-30 22:00:22 detroit

contest-chat 2022-08-19 03:12:20 to be clear, this event is not just "make a steampunk build" it is to take a design, or vehicle from the century that was picked, and make it themed as steam punk

contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:06:17 oh no
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:06:19 what is it
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:06:27 wdym
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:02 what was it based on
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:11 well yes
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:17 but you said it wasnt valve based
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:08:12 you dont need the 3 top ones\
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:08:18 why would you need those
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:08:24 the big wheel should be all you need
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:08:31 also power is not an issue
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:08:48 i can slap a turbo on it and give it some more power
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:09:35 wdym
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:09:45 join  vip 1 and lemme see the engine you made
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:10:55 looks like it got a lot of torque
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:11:04 and it will never stall due to piston timing
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:11:14 so it shouldnt have random power loss
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:11:23 idk how many pistons ur engine had
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:12:22 idk i dont wanna spend time turning this into car
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:12:42 uh]
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:12:45 early morning
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:01 oh wait

contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:25 k
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:50 btw heres what it looks like
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:14:02 depends
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:14:10 if i can get my tank steering idea to work
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:14:11 then no
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:14:14 but if i cant
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:14:19 then possibly yes
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:15:24 i mean if it comes down to that then im just gonna ask piggles for his engine design and modify it since he got it smaller, his just had less torque
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:16:11 maybe
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:16:20 depends on how much space you will have
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:16:31 cuz the engine and gearbox already gonna take up a bunch of space
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:17:51 perhaos

contest-chat 2022-08-23 23:37:11 guys look at my epic progress on the contest build, i totally havent had this in my saves for years and dragged it out just for this contest !!!
contest-chat 2022-08-24 01:13:15 literally you my guy
contest-chat 2022-08-24 01:14:04 difference is that i was sarcastic, you were not

contest-chat 2022-08-27 18:47:06 Lomper
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:48:27 i would just like to say....
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:48:34 before i absolutely destroy this guy
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:48:54 now
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:48:54 that his train might have ended up better if he remembered to paint the rest of it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:48:57 on to the rant
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:49:02 where to start my guys?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:49:32 the lack of weathering on a train meant to be in SMOG filled world?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:50:13 the use of futuristic engines that he literally calls "hyperpower"?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:51:03 oh, oh, maybe the part about how he said that not all steampunk things have to have exposed gears and pipes, even though that is the style that steampunk is?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:52:18 you see, the reason they didnt use direct turbines on a steam train, is because it doesnt offer as much torque, you just made a less efficient steam train
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:52:43 the fact it is pristine blue and white makes it not fit in any depiction of a steampunk world ever created
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:53:12 you put 0 time into making the exhaust look anything near believable
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:54:03 all you did was make a train you have wanted to make for a while, and just post it, you didnt make it steampunk, you made it more steampunk in your description of it that what you actually show on it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:55:04 that would be the equivalent of me posting a wwII tank to a futuristic competition and saying "the engine is a nuclear reactor and the gearbox is a cvt transmission"
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:55:13 and then not changing the looks at all
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:55:27 anything i missed?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:57:06 in the end, the horribly painted submission above yours is better simply because it actually went for the contest theme
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:58:51 istg people are fucking stupid
contest-chat 2022-08-28 03:59:50 "JuSt BeCaUsE iTs StEaMpUnK dOeSnT mEaN iT hAs To HaVe ExPoSeD gEaRs"
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:00 yes, that is literally what it means
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:08 the whole point of steampunk
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:11 is meant to be
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:12 big
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:14 clunky
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:17 heavy
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:20 oversized
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:24 overcomplicated
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:29 not elegant
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:00:32 not clean
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:01:28 your fate is sealed toot
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:01:36 free trial of life ended soon
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:03:49 also
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:03:55 art streamlining
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:03:59 was in the 1930s
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:04:10 steampunk is late 1800s
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:12:32 wdym ok and
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:12:40 art streamlining didnt exist
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:16:42 it was steampunk themes
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:16:48 not 20th century themed
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:17:25 thats what i been saying
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:25:35 not rlly
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:25:40 very simple actually
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:25:48 since 21st century is future
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:25:56 you can make custom things
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:26:01 that still look steampunk
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:26:07 yeah
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:26:09 cool as shit
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:26:32 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742828914753142817/996995697591193660/unknown.png
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:26:34 this
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:26:40 is what that would sorta look like
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:27:57 why would those matter
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:28:04 they too small to make in plane crazy
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:28:06 they like
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:28:12 the size of a half wedge
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:46:14 ok let me start this off by explaining how this competition was supposed to work
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:46:37 you take 20th century concepts and ideas, and use steampunk tech to build it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:47:41 steam turbines arent used in steampunk art because they arent showy, they dont feel steampunky
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:48:04 this is literally the way we explained it to rbk in vip chat
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:48:26 indeed
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:48:49 currently you could swap its title of steampunk with a diesel train, and you would change nothing
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:49:08 literally the only thing tying your train to steam at all, is the coal
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:49:11 and thats not much
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:50:14 do you? take a look at any depiction of a steampunk world, not a single drawing will show that the world is clean
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:50:18 because it isnt
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:50:34 the world isnt clean
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:50:35 becayse
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:50:41 they use COAL
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:50:45 which is DIRTY
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:50:53 your coal box IS SOMEHOW CLEAN
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:50:57 HOW DID YOU MANAGE THAT
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:51:46 your tender looks like a diesel
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:51:50 no joke
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:52:00 
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:52:55 ive already said that the only thing tying your train to steam is the coal
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:53:03 remove the coal and what does your train look like
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:53:06 a diesel
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:53:23 the exhaust looks like hiroshima
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:53:43 the cab looks like your DIESEL engine is taking up too much space in the front
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:54:03 your wheels
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:54:07 are completely black
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:54:10 with blue on them
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:55:27 you can barely tell they are coupling rods
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:55:52 no
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:56:04 i would rather you actually make them look like coupling rods
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:56:12 they look like a rectangle attached to a cirlce
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:56:36 atleast they rounded it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:57:00 you dont, you hide them
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:57:39 also
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:58:14 you never responded to my remark about how your description of your creation is more steampunk than what the actual build is
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:58:31 yes
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:58:34 exactly that
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:58:53 no
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:58:56 its because
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:59:00 all the things you listed
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:59:05 arent even in your build
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:59:09 where is the turbine>
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:59:30 what the fuck is a "hyperpower"
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:59:47 ok so
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:59:50 a made up engine
contest-chat 2022-08-28 04:59:57 great
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:01:01 you mean a radiator?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:01:38 a condenser is taking steam and cooling it back into water, its a radiator
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:02:02 you want to know how to immediately make that radiator more steampunk?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:02:08 put some big ass fans on it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:02:20 again
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:02:23 all you did
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:02:26 was make a diesel
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:02:29 put coal in it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:02:37 call it a steampunk train
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:02:53 and gave it a description that didnt even match the build
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:03:23 it also
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:03:26 again
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:03:31 does not look steampunk
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:03:33 which was
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:03:35 you know
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:03:38 the entire theme
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:03:54 the theme was not
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:04:02 no
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:04:20 this is the same thing https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/945400465133293639/1013310773835083846/stock-photo-steampunk-train-whit-path-161700467.jpg
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:04:23 but done better

contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:05:59 too stupid
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:06:20 the contest was to make a steampunk themed 20th century build
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:06:21 not
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:06:40 build a creation if steam tech kept advancing
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:06:56 indeed
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:07:05 no
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:07:06 its not
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:07:15 you can look at any steampunk thing
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:07:17 and none of them
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:07:23 have any more advanced tech
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:07:31 than the 1800s
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:08:37 you are so fucking stupid i want to slap the shit out of you so fucking hard right now
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:08:43 im gonna use gods hand to fucking smite you
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:09:52 take a look at the internal workings of any steampunk art, its all the same, a classic steam engine, and you can tell its a steam engine
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:10:06 perhaps the tech around it has advanced
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:10:10 but the actual steam tech
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:10:11 has not
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:11:11 close, they are external combustion engines
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:11:29 what
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:11:40 how do you even argue that point
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:11:50 thats literally just a falsehood
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:12:12 ok stop sidetracking
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:12:19 i want to shit on your build some more now
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:12:39 why is your build completely clean
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:14:51 considering your engine is currently pumping out enough fumes to rival that of a fleet of dreadnaughts, i would like to know if you just have a worker sitting on top of the train constantly cleaning it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:15:41 they getting sidetracked on god
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:15:56 eas
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:15:58 fr
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:16:38 yes, but you got the contest all wrong
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:17:29 you for some reason thought that it meant steam tech keeps advancing, when in reality, it meant old steam tech used to make 20th century things
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:19:26 indeed
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:19:44 i think i have provided enough evidence to show that he didnt even listen to the contest topic
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:19:50 this can stop now
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:21:05 ok are you able to vc rn? i might be able to explain this better
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:21:29 i can tell you exactly what you did wrong with the design
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:21:54 whats the block count without the landscaping
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:22:21 thats also way too much
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:22:26 my airship is 7-8k
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:05 dont underestimate
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:18 i got the swordfish done in that time
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:30 false
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:31 it was
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:32 like
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:35 30%
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:45 not debatable
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:47 it has
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:49 had
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:50 the nose
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:53 and the cockpit
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:56 and that was about it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:13 false
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:16 those took me like
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:19 a day
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:20 or less
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:23 to figure out
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:27 also
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:33 i still had to rebuild all of it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:39 from essentially memory
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:43 and pictures
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:25:07 still wish i would have done the paint better
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:25:14 idk why the weathering didnt show as well
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:25:19 in game i could see it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:25:28 but in the pics it just wasnt there
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:25:51 uh.....
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:25:57 i had like
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:26:00 8 colors of red
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:26:55 do not even talk about weathering
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:27:16 you are banned from talking about weathering
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:27:40 this is why you are banned
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:27:59 again it was steampunk themed
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:28:19 they are
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:28:21 you just
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:28:23 failed
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:28:24 miserably
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:28:43 the other pictures of steampunk trains in that style clearly say otherwise
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:14 again
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:17 was
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:17 the topic
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:31 to take a 20th century idea or concept
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:36 and use steampunk tech
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:38 to make it
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:48 not the other way around
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:56 you are getting it messed up
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:30:22 can you even resubmit?
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:30:41 ok
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:31:08 the streamlining wasnt the problem
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:31:12 goddamn you dont lsiten
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:32:03 the 20th century concepts, was the streamlining, that was the good part, the problem was the lack of any steampunk aspects
bot-central 2022-08-28 05:33:19 -servers
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:34:03 it doesnt fit
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:34:06 stop saying it does
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:34:11 there is no steampunk aspect
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:34:27 steampunk does not = steam train
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:34:43 it was a good idea
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:34:44 it was
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:34:49 community problem
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:35:02 steam powered does not = steampunk'
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:35:35 steampunk does not = advanced steam tech
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:36:08 FRRRRRRRR
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:36:37 the streamlining isnt the problem LISTEN TO ME
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:39:04 if this guy, says one more thing about "advanced steam tech" im going to lose my shit
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:39:07 steampunk
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:39:11 is the opposite
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:39:14 of advanced steam tech
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:40:04 EVERY
SINGLE
STEAMPUNK

contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:44:16 yeah
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:46:00 say "take a 20th century concept or idea, and build it using steampunk technology" that should make it more clear so people dont get mixed up somehow
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:46:08 i dont even know how people dont understand this
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:46:23 its very easy to understand if you look at it for more than 2 seconds
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:46:32 the flywheelk
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:46:39 yes
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:46:40 put that
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:47:15 obc
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:47:53 (notice how it doesnt look steam powered but still looks steampunk)

contest-chat 2022-08-29 18:37:03 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
contest-chat 2022-08-29 21:22:58 remember that giant flying worm that germany used during the second world war?
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:36:04 <@928218139345420288> ok but.... what 20th century thing is that based on...
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:37:04 show
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:37:05 now
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:37:48 the tug boat is a 20th century thing
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:37:54 easy
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:38:15 idk
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:38:17 a tug boat tho
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:38:33 i dont think you can find any tugboats made after 1999 tbh
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:38:50 yes
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:38:57 its a tug boat
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:39:09 yes?
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:39:19 what about it
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:40:07 i dont understand what point you are trying to make here, he is one of the only ones who has actually followed the rules
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:40:16 even if it doesnt look good
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:40:29 now show the 20th century design of ur creation
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:41:38 HOW IS NOBODY UNDERSTANDING THIS CONTEST
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:41:40 IT IS
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:41:46 VERY VERY SIMPLE
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:43:02 you werent supposed to look up "steampunk 20th century" and create whats there, you were supposed to take a thing from the 20th century, and make it look steampunk
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:43:43 clearly
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:44:05 still havent shown what 20th century thing ur creation is based on
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:45:10 ok so clearly you are avoiding the question, meaning the thing you made is just a custom steampunk build
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:45:49 <@466793357318815744> we got another one, somehow they didnt understand the very simple instructions again, time to remove from contest submission
contest-chat 2022-08-31 03:48:37 pcc people on their way to show how stupid they are by misunderstanding the contest for the thousandth time
contest-chat 2022-08-31 05:14:58 i don think so
contest-chat 2022-08-31 05:17:33 turns out they are all custom
contest-chat 2022-08-31 05:17:42 contest fail

contest-chat 2022-09-03 12:31:55 You say that, but you also didn't participate
contest-chat 2022-09-03 12:58:31 I prob would have participated if i hadnt started working on a steampunk thing before the contest
general 2022-09-04 00:25:19 i custom battling
contest-chat 2022-09-06 17:57:01 Instantly declined
contest-chat 2022-09-06 17:57:40 Anybody who wants to win a contest just for vip access kinda
contest-chat 2022-09-06 17:57:44 Super shallow
contest-chat 2022-09-06 21:09:24 ugly af, ur not gonna win simply because the plane doesnt look good
contest-chat 2022-09-06 21:10:17 even if you make a perfect copy, you wont win the contest because the original plane is a heaping pile of shit
contest-chat 2022-09-06 21:11:08 a few
contest-chat 2022-09-06 21:11:22 if u want to make props
contest-chat 2022-09-06 21:12:03 hs 129, either varient, an il2 of some sort, an me 410 is a great choice , a bf 110 is another good one
contest-chat 2022-09-06 21:14:26 you "could" also build a stuka but i would advise against it as its a pretty basic build
contest-chat 2022-09-08 12:06:16 Any roscale aircraft will be removed
contest-chat 2022-09-08 12:06:50 Then its called a mini build
contest-chat 2022-09-08 12:07:21 Just use a normal scale
contest-chat 2022-09-08 12:07:58 U have a landing gear wheel? Make it 1x1, there you go you have the scale for the rest of ur aircraft
contest-chat 2022-09-08 12:08:05 It really is that simple
contest-chat 2022-09-08 12:09:12 Use whatever scale is convenient
contest-chat 2022-09-08 12:09:22 Don't confine to pcc standards
contest-chat 2022-09-08 12:09:32 (They are shit anyway)
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:26:17 Depends on aircraft
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:27:36 If im gonna use an actual person for scale i just say that a person is 3 or 4 blocks tall
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:27:46 Simplifies everything
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:28:39 No
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:29:26 If you use a 1x1 front wheel on a tail dragging aircraft then the tail wheel would most likely be a landing gear block
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:29:59 And then u just use tnt to remove the box around the wheel
contest-chat 2022-09-08 17:34:21 The j

contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:50:38 Lets start with the blades
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:50:45 They arent even attached
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:50:55 They are powered by rockets
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:51:04 They have a curve at the end for no reason
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:51:48 The blades themselves arent even angled in the pic, therefore creating 0 luft
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:52:07 Its not hiding anything and it just looks bad
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:53:12 Again, it doesn't look good, and its very visible
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:53:27 There isnt meant to be a curve
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:53:41 No that is still very easy to see
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:53:50 Now onto the body
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:54:02 1 wide, which means they are a roscaler
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:54:10 Automatic point loss
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:54:33 The engine intake, doesn't even have a hole
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:54:48 Its just flat black squares
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:55:01 The text is floating on the body
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:55:12 The tail section is morbidly obese

contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:56:42 Hiver thrusters are smaller, faster, more powerful, and look better
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:57:01 And rockets spew blue and make a lot of noise
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:57:13 They are just worse
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:57:21 Exactly
contest-chat 2022-10-19 13:57:58 The rocket pods on the pylons are clipping into eachother

contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:01:12 As long as your creation is scaled to itself then it's fine
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:01:15 But that heli isn't
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:01:18 Its too thin

contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:08:46 Mostly because all my builds rn are wip from 2 years ago
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:08:58 Every single project
contest-chat 2022-10-19 14:09:26 The sad thing is that those wip from 2 years ago look better than modern pcc builds

general 2022-12-14 15:04:51 Heavy motorlock / lots of moving bits?
general 2022-12-14 15:05:46 Motorlock itself causes major issues, angling is the most common frame dropper

plane-crazy 2023-01-05 17:02:29 Now
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 17:02:36 No more speaking
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 17:02:50 In fact
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 17:02:53 Never talk again
plane-crazy 2023-01-05 17:03:00 Shut
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 02:48:47 so again
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 02:48:56 its a more realistic flight
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 02:50:19 what aspects did it not increase the realism
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 02:53:07 well i did increase the lift to drag
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 02:53:27 because if it was normal it would have glided at 100 sps instead of 700
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 02:53:41 acceleration was for my convenience
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 02:57:36 what are you even basing that off
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 02:58:47 well yes, when i had 0 speed after trying to turn it dropped out of the sky, thats called stalling
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 02:59:52 i dont see how looking at the trail angle would be good, because i can just fly straight and let it dive by itself and the trail angle would be completely straight
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:00:58 well any plane will keep falling
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:01:26 thats also with wind
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:01:35 yes and thermals
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:02:08 not like that
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:24:18 my testbed for making flight more realistic

plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:28:20 automatic car?
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:29:07 you mean the automatic shifting?
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:29:17 yes that is impossible
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:30:35 a torque converter is not the same as an automatic transmission
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:31:29 its the replacement for a clutch my guy
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:31:48 its not the transmission itself
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:31:51 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:31:56 its called a torque conveter
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:31:59 like i said
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:32:03 its the replacement
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:33:46 a clutch connects the engine to the transmission, a torque converter connects the engine to the transmission, the clutch allows for shifting without your gears exploding, torque converter allows for shifting without your gears exploding
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:34:42 they serve the same purpose
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:34:56 the torque converter is just better for automatic as you dont need to control it
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:35:42 well it seems like you dont understand
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:36:07 but yes automatic transmissions are not possible in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:36:18 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:36:22 that is indeed what it does
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:36:37 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:36:48 but that is not a complete transmission
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:37:04 a torque converter is not the same as an automatic transmission
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:37:08 it is merely a part
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:37:47 if it changes gears AUTOMATICALLY then it is an automatic transmission
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:38:16 and it is impossible to change gears automatically in this game
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:38:21 as we do not have electrics
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:38:57 we werent talking about that at all
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:39:01 i didnt contend that
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:40:03 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:40:30 what do you even mean by that
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:40:36 join vip 1 rn
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:41:14 lemme ask you this
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:41:17 does your gearbox
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:41:20 change gears
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:41:22 by itself
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:41:45 so its a manual
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:42:10 no, its not
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:42:32 its a manual
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:43:01 YOU CANT PUT A FUCKING TORQUE CONVERTER ON A MANUAL TRANSMISSION AND CALL IT A SEMI AUTOMATIC
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:43:39 so you literally just put a manual transmission on an engine without a clutch
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:43:45 that is not a semi automatic
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:44:36 <@398542251501944833> there is no fucking way you are a car mechanic and know this little
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:48:42 ITS LITERALLY A FUCKING MANUAL MY FUCKING GOD
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:49:21 fake ass car mechanic
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:50:48 yes you just replaced it with a fucking spring to make it go back and forth
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:51:46 thats still a manual transmission, because you are *manually* changing gears
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:51:58 do the gears move forward and back
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:53:04 ok so wheres your output shaft
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:53:39 i only see 1 clutch
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:56:59 thats not how that works
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:57:04 its a manual
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:57:09 you are manually changing gears
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:57:39 no you are engaging gears
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:57:46 its still a manual transmission
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:58:00 no its not
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:59:22 https://youtu.be/wCu9W9xNwtI?t=150
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 03:59:53 its not what hes saying it is
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:00:35 all gears are spinning constantly on your gearbox, you engage a single gear to change gear, that is how a manual transmission works
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:01:04 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:01:07 but the difference
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:01:14 is that it does that electronically
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:01:22 you are not doing that electronically
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:01:29 you are manually pressing buttons
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:01:47 no its not because you still have a clutch
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:02:19 ignore if you do not want to see it
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:02:32 the thing on the left, that is your main clutch
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:02:39 it works like a clutch
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:02:44 not a torque converter
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:03:03 what you have is not one
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:03:29 its not an auto at all
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:03:33 you have a manual clutch
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:03:37 you manually change gears
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:03:43 its all manual
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:03:55 how is it semi auto clutch
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:04:28 are you pressing a spinning disk into another spinning disk with a manual input
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:06:16 you did not answer the question
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:07:31 then why did you bring up your clutch in the first place
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:09:02 you do realise the lst has a manual mode right
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:09:14 which is what your gearbox is in if you wanna call it an lst
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:09:31 it does though
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:10:02 it doesnt make it entirely analog like a true manual transmission
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:10:23 manual transmission is a tranmission that you manually change gears in
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:11:11 my original point was that automatic transmissions are impossible in plane crazy, he chose to argue that point
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:11:44 wtf are you talking about
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:12:01 the lst you mentioned has a stick
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:12:20 and a clutch pedal
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:12:59 purely automatic cars do not have a manual mode
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:13:25 name them
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:13:34 name a single car
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:13:40 that has a manual mode
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:13:44 without a stick and clutch
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:14:54 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:15:04 but it changes it from automatic
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:15:11 to sequential
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:15:29 yours is not a sequential
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:16:13 yes, but it only goes up and down
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:16:19 you cant skip gears
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:16:56 i already said, that is not what your gearbox is
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:17:15 yes, that is called a sequential
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:17:27 again though
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:17:34 that is not what you have on your gearbox
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:18:13 with your argument, i can say that a manual is actually a semi automatic, because with user input, the gear changes
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:19:47 yes
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:19:57 his does not do that
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:20:59 it uses 2 clutched
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:23:18 what you described was an analog transmission
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:25:39 what you have
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:25:44 is still a manual
plane-crazy 2023-01-20 04:25:58 you are still engaging the clutches yourself
