general 2023-02-23 21:10:07 (Cut to a gnome. A few moments after the creature passes by it, smacking its lips again, it turns its head to the camera and its eyes start blinking red, The camera fades to a portrait of Mrs. Mulch, whose eyes are blinking. The camera zooms out on Wallaceâ€™s wall who has portraits of citizens of West Wallaby Street. The camera pans to a kettle boiling with steam shooting out, spinning a wheel, making a mechanical arm push up Gromitâ€™s bed multiple times. Cuts to Wallace in his bed.
general 2023-02-23 21:10:51 meh. im not gonna be banned for spamming
general 2023-02-23 21:11:07 but anyways
general 2023-02-23 21:11:25 A mechanical hand holding a plate of cheese comes out of his cheese portrait. Wallace smells it and goes for the cheese. He hits his head on the picture when the mechanical hand goes back in with the cheese. The bone in Gromitâ€™s bone portrait blinks red and flips to blinking red text that says "ACTIVATE LAUNCH". Gromit and Wallace get pushed onto metal slides by their beds. They are held still by metal racks at the end of the slide for their caps to get twisted on.
general 2023-02-23 21:13:53 The slides tilt the other direction for them to slide down into their boots. Their tea is poured for them. They grab their mugs of tea. The metal platform that they are on turns around to two mechanical hands who shoot them off like a catapult. Wallace falls into his Anti-Pesto uniform. Wallace and Gromit slide down. They clink their mugs, causing their tea to fly out. They catch it with their mugs. They drink their tea as they are sent up into their seats in their Anti-Pesto van

general 2023-02-23 21:28:03 They place their mugs on silver platters. The vanâ€™s headlights turn on. Wallace presses a button that says "AUTOSTART". A mechanical hand comes out with a winder and starts winding up the engine. Wallace adjusts the rearview mirror as the garage door goes up.
