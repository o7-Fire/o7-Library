help 2020-11-17 00:41:37 there are many ways to fix it, the solution can vary on the position of the targeted motor two(s), on a tank turret it could be to just add a .2 torque motor on top of the motor 2 that acts as a base inside the turret while using motors to allow a frame to pass through and still have 180 degrees of space to travel. on steering you can add 2 motors to the front and back of the motors and then link them, depending on the suspension used you may have to use suspension to allow them to travel in vertical difference from each other. other more complicated systems work, and you may have to apply different settings, sometimes just add a full ballast block and see what happens. sorry for the text wall

plane-crazy 2021-01-10 18:10:02 any mech can go off of only a few motors
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 18:10:14 it just needs the right keybinds and speeds

help 2021-01-11 21:33:10 wings do. not any other block
bug-reports 2021-01-11 21:35:06 we all know that glitch. i used to experience it all the time when i made overly complicated suspension.  its nothing new and it happens when motors get stressed too much
bug-reports 2021-01-11 21:37:11 no it wouldn't stick bc of the crappy connection <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
bug-reports 2021-01-11 21:38:20 ok. that glitch is also nothing new. it happens when too muvh torque is applied to somethign then it glitches through. it becomes easier on treads due to the ammount of motors/ropes and speed + torque.
bug-reports 2021-01-11 21:40:17 addinga better connection or adding even a little bit more of a thivk surface will help
bug-reports 2021-01-11 21:40:22 there are a lot of ways to fix it
bug-reports 2021-01-11 21:40:36 you just have to fiddle with it until you find the one that works for the case
help 2021-01-11 21:44:41 Ice and fabric. you can also make them ballast blocks as they are set to .26 which is the weight of a normal block. you can bring it down to .15 to make it lighter than a normal block which will allow you to not have to use ice or fabric to make a lighter than normal chassis with blocks
help 2021-01-11 21:46:29 no
help 2021-01-11 21:46:36 yeah
help 2021-01-11 21:46:39 would be nice
help 2021-01-11 21:47:40 you can use corner blocks, or make custom corners using multiple blocks. or if you end up advanced enough you could use locked motors

plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:00:02 personally
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:00:13 i don't think naval guns would be a good addon
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:00:16 like
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:00:23 it would feel a little unlike plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:00:25 and
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:00:32 kinda ruin the game in a certian way
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:00:47 im not saying its a bad idea
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:00:52 it kinda hard to explain
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:00:56 but ill try
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:01:15 so
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:01:17 first
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:01:24 is the different sizes
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:01:27 and
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:01:34 then the caliber
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:02:15 the sizes would make it so that it would be difficult to cycle through, define, (make in ricks case) and other things like that
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:02:17 then
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:02:19 the calliber
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:02:27 if you get a calliber too big
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:02:31 or you added a lot
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:02:44 you could make one of those spammer cars only worse than they are now
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:02:47 and
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:02:54 so many other things could go wrong
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:03:06 i just don't think it would fit hard code plane crazy anyway
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:03:11 ik
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:03:12 but
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:03:15 if u added a lot
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:03:20 it would be chaos
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:03:41 a cannon would be okay, on the soft code update
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:03:57 id be open to reveive these kinds of updates once it becomes softcoded

general 2021-01-15 07:36:10 i think i can say i officially broke the game
general 2021-01-15 07:36:11 first
general 2021-01-15 07:36:18 i crashed an entire server on accident
general 2021-01-15 07:36:19 two
general 2021-01-15 07:36:45 i almost broke my computer and it started shutting off and putting the display at random angles
general 2021-01-15 07:36:58 bc of this
general 2021-01-15 07:37:49 its the builds fault
general 2021-01-15 07:37:51 ik for a fact

general 2021-01-15 07:38:18 ever
general 2021-01-15 07:38:58 6.2K but  its super complicated and it stresses the client and physics engine extremely hard due to the complicated suspension and stabilization tech
general 2021-01-15 07:40:57 
general 2021-01-15 07:41:03 there is a total of 7 in this room

general 2021-01-15 07:41:20 there are a total of 15
general 2021-01-15 07:41:22 .

general 2021-01-15 07:41:36 and two
general 2021-01-15 07:41:43 interfering with the physics code
general 2021-01-15 07:41:59 its very harsh and merciless onthephysics engine and clients
general 2021-01-15 07:42:12 yes
general 2021-01-15 07:42:40 if i use hovers it won't offer the same stability and benifits

bug-reports 2021-01-15 19:54:24 re
creations-chat 2021-01-15 19:55:51 i have two words. **_Land Cruiser_**
<:YouTried:559530066258821131>
creations-chat 2021-01-15 19:58:21 i crashed an entire server with what is only a layout currently. its not even official layout. and it has no detail. **_Land Cruiser_**
creations-chat 2021-01-15 20:00:41 I don't like mechs. Try proving **me** wrong another way.
creations-chat 2021-01-15 20:04:13 my car is very complicated. i have very advanced glitch proof suspension and i have more advanced reaction wheels which spin counter to the direction i want to rotate to keep my stable. not to mention the vehicles imma be putting inside the garage and concealed helipad. ive made a working mech. they are easier than u say
creations-chat 2021-01-15 20:08:24 i haven't done a full year of nothing but r&d on how plane crazy works just to get beat by a couple mechs😎 research and development
creations-chat 2021-01-15 20:10:49 and yet ur only where u are now. just bc they got better rating doesn't mean they are more reliable, complicated, and advanced
creations-chat 2021-01-15 20:14:16 pcc is more concentrated on the asthetics. and being unable to tour the builds yourself can become misleading. it will even have an indoor park. which. due to my terraforming skills. will set it off^^^^yes we are. not fighting. just trying to prove eachother wrong ina friendly way
creations-chat 2021-01-15 20:17:04 ok. by then ill be done and averaging around 12K blocks
creations-chat 2021-01-15 20:19:51 seems normal
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 20:59:09 i agree
creations-chat 2021-01-16 00:51:14 but motors **aren't** broken
help 2021-01-18 23:36:20 why are you 3 blocks tall. how does that benefit
bug-reports 2021-01-19 20:34:07 not true. i hit skip all the time. its justa  lag and internet connection factor
creations-chat 2021-01-19 21:14:12 the entire server left bc of the lag. i bet some of them crashed
creations-chat 2021-01-19 21:17:48 holy...
creations-chat 2021-01-20 01:05:30 make it a little less slanted inwards in other places rather than it all being slanted inwards everywhere, and the blocks of randomness on the left needs some adaption(unless they are placeholders which i doubt so) you could have some more horizontal wedges rather than all vertical so the eye has something to catch but make sure it doesn't look like crystals or hair which can happen unless you don't replace or add different blocks to tie it together. otherwise great start
bug-reports 2021-01-20 20:42:01 builds mixed, i loaded a build and parts of the otherone stayed
bug-reports 2021-01-20 20:56:30 ok

plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:47:46 i use toggle
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:47:48 it works

plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:47:55 even on lock
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:48:19 they can't hold in place bc of the weight
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:48:28 it liek they are unpowered
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:48:45 i have

plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:50:22 which brings them together
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:50:37 no

plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:51:29 so i use magnets
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:51:34 to weld them when they touch
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:51:57 you should see what happens when a fold goes wrong...
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:52:08 the blocks don't hold up
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:52:12 its like

help 2021-01-22 20:37:39 physics, this is an issue real helis have. they solve it irl by using blade flapping, its when the side retreating backwards on the heli is going slower relative the the ground than the one going up the span of the heli which decreases lift on the right than the left

bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:31:54 oh
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:32:00 the thing that happened earlier
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:32:08 only happens with anchor blocks when thay are anchored
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:33:54 in the case of an anchor block being connected to a camera weld
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:34:58 any other camera weld that has been set will rotate the same distance from the other / central camera weld in the reverse direction it was rotated while also rotating its blocks the way it was assigned
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:36:17 yes
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:38:30 all blocks and welds that are concidered part of the rotation by default or being set to a block will rotate around the first camera weld made(first one with an anchor block) even if other anchors are in place after this, all locks will separate them from their anchors and all blocks attatched
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:39:07 attatched to the camera weld
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:39:08 side
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:39:32 the anchor will remain. but when it is unanchored it will teleport back to its location on the blocks that were separated
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:40:29 if the main pilot is anchored the weld will be postponed until unanchored.
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:40:56 anchor does not have to be directly anchored to seat

plane-crazy 2021-01-25 20:23:57 blacklist glitch maybe
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:08:25 guys
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:08:34 i think ik why my motor 2s never broke
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:08:41 its bc of my love for complicated systems
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:09:25 i use linked steering that allows one motor to break and the other will take over the other motor 2 and do it all hence my steering never broke

bug-reports 2021-01-25 21:11:34 
bug-reports 2021-01-25 21:11:56 this is how you can fix motor 2 steering breaks
bug-reports 2021-01-25 21:12:00 just link the motors
bug-reports 2021-01-25 21:12:41 
bug-reports 2021-01-25 21:12:52 like this
bug-reports 2021-01-25 21:13:26 it cancels the wobbling and it makes them function properly
bug-reports 2021-01-25 21:13:40 bc they wobble into eachother
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:20:47 ill do it right now
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:22:39 done
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:22:41 it works
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:22:43 just slow
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:22:46 bc its ropes
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:24:52 
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:25:08 
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:25:34 \
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:25:57 serves better as a landing flap
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:27:57 hover elevators seem much fater tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:28:04 
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:28:13 
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:28:37 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:28:41 hard to control tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:28:47 when it comes to slow movement
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:33:56 then using tiny landing gear to make flaps
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:34:33 
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:36:20 i think
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:36:27 that unless u were desprate
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:36:36 you should never use langing gear flaps
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:36:43 then
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:36:49 ropes are good for landing flaps
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:36:54 bc they slow
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:36:55 and
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:37:05 the hovers are good for slow aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:37:12 though
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:37:16 very sensitive
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 21:38:28 working horizontal pushrod prototype

help 2021-01-26 14:29:37 it physics
help 2021-01-26 14:30:28 it happens when a heli is moving forewards and it makes the retreating side of the rotor go slower relative to the ground and the attacking side faster than the heli which decreases lift on the retreating side and increases on the other likewise creating roll

help 2021-01-26 14:32:57 the outlines make it looks so much better
help 2021-01-26 14:33:14 adjust the pitch of the tail rotor blades
help 2021-01-26 14:33:23 right or left
help 2021-01-26 14:34:56 puting the engines that we typicaly use to adjust pitch on the tail just makes it easier for them due to mechanical advantage. but you can have them otherplaces or not at all and just use reaction wheels for everything like all of my recent helis (year olds)
help 2021-01-26 14:36:01 i feel like i sound older thn i am when im online

help 2021-01-26 14:40:09 yes
help 2021-01-26 14:40:37 usualy i would use reg motors so you can have adjustable pitch rather than just 3 settings

general 2021-02-03 02:24:39 to gyros work in pc
general 2021-02-03 02:24:58 no
general 2021-02-03 02:25:06 angular momentum does not exist
general 2021-02-03 02:25:12 no
general 2021-02-03 02:25:18 no
general 2021-02-03 02:25:34 join me
general 2021-02-03 02:25:38 and ill show u
general 2021-02-03 02:25:59 if what im about to do, works
general 2021-02-03 02:26:03 then it does
general 2021-02-03 02:26:05 if not
general 2021-02-03 02:26:07 yes
general 2021-02-03 02:26:14 do you?
general 2021-02-03 02:27:52 i knocked this over, if ur angular momentum ever existed in this game this would have eben able to upright itself, which, never did
general 2021-02-03 02:27:59 its been spinning
general 2021-02-03 02:28:47 then its not a gyro
general 2021-02-03 02:28:56 bc
general 2021-02-03 02:29:05 gyros specificaly use angular momentum
general 2021-02-03 02:29:11 anything that does not
general 2021-02-03 02:29:20 is another stability system not a gyro
general 2021-02-03 02:29:33 bc people say they use gyros and it pisses me off
general 2021-02-03 02:29:51 not*
general 2021-02-03 02:30:27 if i added wings and it worked it would be due to the crap wing physics lol, ill do it anyway to satisfy u
general 2021-02-03 02:30:47 didn't work
general 2021-02-03 02:31:13 you forgot that tops exist
general 2021-02-03 02:31:28 tops use angular momentum to stay upright also
general 2021-02-03 02:31:42 the heiulm will drag it up dingus
general 2021-02-03 02:32:49 this is what im using, irl this would be upright if i tped it over when and started spinning it, but whenever i do, whatever i do, it does not
general 2021-02-03 02:32:57 
general 2021-02-03 02:33:26 yes, but have you heard of anything else
general 2021-02-03 02:34:02 bc if it did then the top i made would have gone upright but it never did
general 2021-02-03 02:34:51 if it makes u happy ill use powered motors
general 2021-02-03 02:37:12 unpowerd worry
general 2021-02-03 02:37:13 lol
general 2021-02-03 02:39:16 almost worked, not fully level tho
general 2021-02-03 02:41:41 id say the tank does not get hof, the hull is too detailed to be recognisable, (unless its custom then idc) and the barrel aint great. i might not be that good but i say no bc of the barrel
general 2021-02-03 02:43:12 luftwaffle
general 2021-02-03 02:44:12 what a pro, he gunna eat all that tonight?
general 2021-02-03 02:45:46 alright, ive come to the conclusion that (just like other branches of physics) angular momentum depends on the way you utilise it. if you use unpowered motor s it works, without them (like a top) it will not. screwed up if you ask me

general 2021-02-06 05:58:13 death
general 2021-02-06 05:58:57 is it a lag issue?
general 2021-02-06 06:00:49 try minimizing the amount of blocks with a lot of parts in them liek trapdoors, ropes, and things liek snowblasters as they have multiple blocks (those were just examples) and replace them with things with less liek disconectors and snow pipes
general 2021-02-06 06:01:07 you can also use large ones
general 2021-02-06 06:01:24 liek replacing 1x1 with 1x7
general 2021-02-06 06:01:58 ok
general 2021-02-06 06:02:03 also
general 2021-02-06 06:02:07 balast blocks can add lag
general 2021-02-06 06:02:11 kinda
general 2021-02-06 06:02:18 maybe miniscule more but
general 2021-02-06 06:02:22 more due to the code

general 2021-02-07 03:45:53 i feel like its too long
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:46:33 dis good length for a convertible? i think it could be a lil too long
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:47:24 anyone gunna give feedback
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:47:32 def too long
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:47:59 dis better?
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:48:22 is it just right? or shorter
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:49:06 imma say a lil bit shorter
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:49:24 **_ YES_**
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:51:03 but idk about the windshield rn
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:51:11 the windows
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:51:44 its a coup convertible
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:51:47 also
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:51:51 fixed the windows
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:53:27 hows this?
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:54:03 helium higher up
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:54:07 other than that ur fine
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:56:35 the helium being right above the ballast would be the same as having none at all due to the laws of mechanical advantage. if you place it higher up it will be more effective in keeping it stable as it is able to do more with less up higher than down lower
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:57:56 yes but the helium is lighter than air so it just keepign it up, and also its good to have balalsts below and filling it in the make it more bottom heavy
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:58:08 ^
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:58:38 whats ur definition of too much space taken up

creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:04:08 bc the people don't know how to communicate lol
v when you bend a motor
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:07:19 when a motor gets, pushed, stressed, pulled, too much it starts to slide off the base. or bend(rotate, or slide)
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 18:10:28 this is why pcc isnot reliable when it coems to questions. they always ignore them
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 18:11:38 someone asks a question, everyone ignores it until someone else says soemthing, or they just say something like "ur mom" and the person does not get a response. that they can use. often not one at all

plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:44:44 
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:48:46 how does that make a difference
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:49:38 ik why
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:49:45 but whats confusing me now is
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:49:51 what blocks ar u using lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:50:39 ik that
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:50:40 but
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:50:51 it does not look liek they should fit
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:51:31 they will eb the same if they have the same area
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:52:49 k
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:52:53 ik why
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:52:59 left is better dingus
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:53:08 the left ha smroe lift otherwise it would not be going right
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:53:19 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:53:26 its bc of mechanical advantage
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:53:42 you can lift more with less effort the further u are from the fulcrum
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:53:46 on the right
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:53:55 it has more area cloder the the center
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:54:02 so
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:54:02 its the opposite for the left
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:54:11 its able to do more maneuvers easiert
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:54:28 as it has a higher ratio of mechanical advantage
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:54:36 not verticaly
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:54:39 or horixontaly
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:54:46 but on the roll axis
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:54:50 hence
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:54:53 the better banking
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:56:06 dead chat

general 2021-02-13 21:36:44 here are ur results, lemme tally it up
general 2021-02-13 21:41:50 at 6:30 am you walked to the bobama private park, put in your pay, and you saw some crappy crimson spotted bed sheets, yu asked what was up, and it teleported you to Jupiter, you were so terrified that the sun decided to expand and earth's population skyrocketed to a shocking 10B people in a matter of seconds, the sun expanded into Jupiter during Saturns 60% of lowest orbit and successfully exploded both planets killing all 9 billion on the planet and the remaining 1 billion escaped into the vacume of space, who will all soon die to a lack of reasources. then 69 of the most notable starts in the galaxy flamed out killing off 70 species of super-intelligent aliens. everyone on jupiter that had died some 30 years earlier with you were exposed to the crushing gravity of the planet, and 30 times that much force in the explosion of the planet, the sun crushed the souls of the dead people while expanding and completely wiping out earth. the bed sheets survived
general 2021-02-13 21:42:24 yes

general 2021-02-13 21:50:02 got it, imma put in the parts i missed and repost here
general 2021-02-13 21:54:49 at 6:30 am you walked to the bobama private park to see the last wooly mamoth's body, still prefectly preserved in ice with your super stupid guinea pig, once you got there, you put in your pay, and you saw some crappy crimson spotted bed sheets, you asked what was up, and it teleported you to Jupiter which for some reason, just happened to have a stuffed bear skin, you were so terrified that the sun decided to expand and earth's population skyrocketed to a shocking 10B people in a matter of seconds, the sun expanded into Jupiter during Saturns 60% of lowest orbit which somehow created the first real minecraft acacia tree to perfect detail, and successfully exploded both planets killing all 9 billion on the planet and the remaining 1 billion escaped into the vacume of space, who will all soon die to a lack of resources. then 69 of the most notable starts in the galaxy flamed out killing off 70 species of super-intelligent aliens. everyone on jupiter that had died some 30 years earlier with you were exposed to the crushing gravity of the planet, and 30 times that much force in the explosion of the planet, the sun crushed the souls of the dead people while expanding and completely wiping out earth. the bed sheets survived. The ten ants that followed you through this horrifying experience survived in their crappy ant farm, and got on their way to rebuilding society, and earth from what was left. Your last words were "_I HAVE NO REGRETS AND I HATED MY WIFE!!!!_"

bug-reports 2021-03-28 16:30:56 cameras will become invisible on spawn. if you select a camera and click a block while building it will angle the camera to that block. any blocks on this camera will then rotate with the camera in spawn mode. cam welds automaticaly sync with main pilot seat and you can't move them relative to the seat. this involves rotating, pushing etc. if you select a block to a camera on the build mode and then move the build up the cam weld will return to original position from when it was selected in build mode. in order to get proper results just make sure the cameras wre connected to nothing but the blocks u want rotated before u spawn. all cameras are reset when u reload
bug-reports 2021-03-28 16:31:38 np
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 16:36:05 if u go left u can open trap doros and it will all go faster. but be easier to derail and wil have less traction. closed will make it slower but less able to derail and have more friction

plane-crazy 2021-03-28 17:57:57 they weight
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 17:59:08 weight of a seat is a lil more than 1.5 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 18:00:05 bc its a lil bit bigger than a half block
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 18:00:11 and weighs a lil more
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 18:00:21 which
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 18:00:31 1 blocvk and a half block are too light to make it balanced
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 18:00:34 so
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 18:00:41 the piston actually makes the weight even
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 18:01:29 uh

general 2021-04-03 18:06:31 war tenders
general 2021-04-03 18:06:47 make the top ones spin the other way
general 2021-04-03 18:10:58 or in other words. the blades are creating resistance larger to that of the mass of the heli and are spinning a direction the motor has set to spin which is instead spinning the heli bc the bottom of the motor moves too and its easier to push the bottom
general 2021-04-03 18:11:04 which

plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:48:54 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:49:00 camera
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:49:01 and
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:49:12 cameras will become invisible on spawn. if you select a camera and click a block while building it will angle the camera to that block. any blocks on this camera will then rotate with the camera in spawn mode. cam welds automaticaly sync with main pilot seat and you can't move them relative to the seat. this involves rotating, pushing etc. if you select a block to a camera on the build mode and then move the build up the cam weld will return to original position from when it was selected in build mode. in order to get proper results just make sure the cameras wre connected to nothing but the blocks u want rotated before u spawn. all cameras are reset when u reload
plane-crazy 2021-04-04 14:49:49 thats what they do

**{ New Map}**
_{flat area}_

Tis is just a simple suggestion. I would like a large flat _ish_ area on the new map for my large land cruisers, and other vehicles than might want to go for a joyride. There isn't enough room right now for any of this stuff on the current map to be done. So please consider this. It could also be a benefit for how the map looks, as it has more variety, and could be a good crash landing spot for planes, and tank pvp arena.

plane-crazy 2021-04-04 22:24:00 he fixed it
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 05:02:31 we all agree the new ball shredders are worse than normal ones by a hundred times right?
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 05:02:58 u don't know?
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 05:03:40 u can rarely join a public pvp server without a shredder, less rarely a ball shredder, but they are still pretty common

plane-crazy 2021-04-05 16:38:16 i made a cutter blender once, for non pvp. don't ask why i used cutters. idk why
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 16:38:22 and it lagged the server so much
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 16:38:31 no
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 16:38:36 it used every single cutter
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 16:38:50 no
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 16:38:53 the cutters go in
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 16:38:57 barely fit
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 16:38:59 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 16:39:12 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 16:39:29 yeah, it tended to
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 16:39:30 bc
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 16:39:40 whenever i opened the lid
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 16:39:48 the blender blade would make them all fly out
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 16:39:53 and some
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 16:39:57 went throught the walls

plane-crazy 2021-04-05 19:13:42 for the fps command
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 19:13:51 they actually have the script
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 19:13:52 just
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 19:13:56 isn't implemented

plane-crazy 2021-04-10 19:35:38 how so
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 19:35:50 also yes
creations-chat 2021-04-11 02:21:10 join VoyagerXavierMGTL and ill just show u, and answer any quistions. its pretty simple so i think you should get it instantly
creations-chat 2021-04-11 02:23:12 thing is, its about at its limit. for weight
creations-chat 2021-04-11 02:25:26 this is creations feedback lol. thats what its for
creations-chat 2021-04-11 02:28:39 then tell the idiots that made it this way to stop being idiots. bc thats why i have abandoned this channel
v only bc i was pinged
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:40:31 <@!291956715749113868>  lol ur suggestion is literaly keybinded anchor blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:42:48 keybinded anchor blocks, powered motors won't transfer the inabiliy to move to other blocks connected to the other side, just connect the anchor with powered motors lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:43:00 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:43:02 but
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:43:13 you literally suggested what keybinded anchors are
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:43:22 you man traction?
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:43:24 mean
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:43:34 suggest that then
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:43:39 one with little spikes
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:43:44 that have a ton of friction
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:43:49 so its like traction
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:43:53 only
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:43:55 not
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:44:44 do 1000 then
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:44:49 not 9000
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:45:01 too op
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:45:08 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:45:18 also room for lag and geame breaking bugs
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:45:21 with too much
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:47:05 not rlly
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:47:53 game breaking bugs and lag
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:48:04 just go 10K speed
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:48:07 and touch the ground
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:48:09 and its over
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:48:29 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:48:35 even 500 tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 02:48:40 breaks games
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:05:42 no
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:05:45 bc im not lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:05:52 i just don't like urs
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:06:08 ive been  a fan of many
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:09:27 i just don't like the particular one
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:09:35 sure
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:09:47 bc i feel like it would change too much in the wrong way
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:10:22 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:10:24 but
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:10:32 it would make it feel, not like plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:11:13 its basicaly an anchor block, that functions automaticaly and all you need is a piston  if its on a car
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:11:51 and, it would deny new players the necessity of finding new things to make their builds better
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:12:00 in some ways
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:12:09 one block can change a lot
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:12:13 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:12:19 anchors
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:12:46 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:12:56 what about you
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:13:11 how would it affect you
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:13:13 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:13:15 how
bot-central 2021-04-11 03:13:38 !servers
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:14:09 what about flipping
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:14:15 the mechs only have it bc they flip
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:14:53 so exactly hopw will this help, other than making them easier to flip off the base plate due to instability
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:15:37 ik
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:15:43 thats not what i was saying
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:15:49 im talking about the block
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:15:52 you suggested
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:16:59 b is not true, neither is a
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:17:16 bc
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:17:20 when off base plate
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:17:37 what is keeping you from becoming a tilt engine
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:17:40 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:17:43 at so many angles too
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:17:52 and nothing to let you slide to drop those angles lower
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:17:56 and make you more stable
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:18:03 bc mechs are garbo in general
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:18:15 no, but we have traction
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:18:24 and actual things
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:18:28 that we grab on to
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:18:31 but
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:18:36 without the dirt and such
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:18:52 it would be like walking on sheet metal, which is what plane crazy it. nothing to keep u there
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:19:15 maybe ask rick to add some rocks in the new map
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:19:17 small ones
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:19:19 around the map
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:19:21 all over
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:19:26 realisticaly
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:19:36 so we actually have traction
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:20:13 not rlly
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:20:23 i made a mech that works just fine when i first started
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:20:27 i just don't like mechs
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:20:31 so i diodn't keep it
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:20:41 if ur mech is a lil bad then it will need thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:20:44 not otherwise
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:21:12 <#478584971670454284>
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:21:49 pictures were on the old laptop i used
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:21:56 are gone now
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:21:58 also
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:22:03 i mentioned how i didn't keep it
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:22:29 it doesn't rlly
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:22:32 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:22:38 what about turning
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:23:12 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:23:13 but
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:23:16 what about
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:23:17 turning
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:23:20 with the friction
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:23:26 yes but
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:23:32 multiple blocks will prevent that
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:23:43 and without multiple
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:23:57 the suggestion would be a waste, bc nothing helps off the base plate
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:25:05 lets say
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:25:18 you put one block on the heel to be able tu turn without welding right?
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:25:20 but
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:25:25 when you got off the base plate
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:25:35 its tha same story as you are trying to prevent
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:25:37 bc
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:25:46 it doesn't touch anything bc of the corners
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:25:59 and only one can be used to prevent the welding of two spots that prevents turning
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:26:04 so
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:26:08 it would be a waste
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:26:12 as you keep sliding
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:26:24 and any up or down tilts will kill it anyway
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:26:37 k
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:27:16 my user is VoyagerXavierMGTL
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:27:22 if you join me
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:28:31 speaking of which, some kid thought it was a good idea to go off the base plate
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:28:42 in hus mech
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:29:04 smh
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:29:12 uses thrusters too
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:34:08 ^^^^^^^^^^^
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:34:16 shut up stupid bot
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:34:30 i8 can put 20 up arrows if i want
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:35:02 btw, human lages are slanted inward to make walking more stable as pressure points are closer to the middle
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:36:10 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:37:27 bc of the front wedge lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:37:30 also
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:37:32 no weight
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:37:52 if you have any weight it will help a lot
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:38:38 it didn't
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:38:52 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:39:14 its the friction multiplier that ur having issues with, not the friction
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:39:21 urs is horrible
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:39:22 bc
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:39:28 you have such a little amount of weight
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:40:05 add more weight, to allow the friction to get the best results
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:40:26 too much makes it completely fail
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:40:43 bc of mass times force to accel
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:41:45 .
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:41:52 im sorry
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:42:02 if you haven't figured it out yet its hopeless
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:42:56 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:43:00 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:43:23 the friction parts aren't even effective anymore, bc they aren't even hitting the gound anyway
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:43:26 and at that point
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:43:40 you would be better off with the blocks having the friction
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:44:01 not effective at all lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:44:13 none of it is touching the ground essentialy
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:44:16 the more that is
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:44:19 the better results
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:44:20 rn
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:44:28 its equivilent of none at all
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:45:36 what
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:45:42 you are hopeless
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:45:51 the more area you have contact with
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:45:57 the more friction you will be able to draw
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:46:05 rn
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:46:11 you have almost nothing touching the ground
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:46:26 why do you think apcs typicaly have 3 or more wheels on each side
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:46:40 or tanks have the treads laid all the way out
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:46:59 almost none is good enough for u? dang you must have really low standards
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:47:21 gotta have mroe bud
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:47:34 this is all i see touching it
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:47:50 if you can get all this touching it. you will have much better results
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:48:18 so get rid of the half wedges in front
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:48:26 so they can
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:49:08 you are on the completely wrong understanding lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:49:10 im saying
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:49:19 the more area you can have in contact qith the ground
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:49:21 at a time
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:49:33 will greatly increase the friction
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:49:37 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:53:42 the rubber on the leg has a lot more friction than the foam on the shoe
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:53:48 making them equal
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:54:11 but
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:54:17 if the shoe was rubber
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:54:21 and the leg was too
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:54:25 the shoe would have more
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:56:05 "You could say that when two surfaces come near each other (call them surface A and surface B), the atoms in surface B get close enough to interact with surface A. The more atoms that are interacting in the two surfaces, the greater the total frictional force. ... Greater contact area means greater frictional force." this same concept is valid in plane crazy, but instead of atoms, its some kind of digital unit, mostly measured by length and size of an object
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:56:35 everything is ficused, and has plenty of friction
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:57:15 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:57:16 also
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:57:36 the "friction blocks" in the building menu have more friction that normal fabric material blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:58:27 bc of the rule i stated above
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:58:30 and yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 03:58:35 i have thoroughly tested
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:00:39 the thing wan't refering to weight
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:00:49 it was referencing surface area
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:00:51 and contact
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:00:55 not weight
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:01:39 this is no better than before. only 2 points on each side. you literaly have masterd the ability to minimize the amount of potential friction being used
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:02:17 no
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:03:29 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:03:34 kind of
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:03:35 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:03:44 also pacifics
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:06:01 public pvp am i right
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:07:27 you wanna bring those on anything that isn't flat?
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:07:29 bc
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:07:33 im sure you will slip a lot
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:07:50 notice
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:07:54 i said anything nit flat
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:08:21 friction yes, but nothing else
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:08:26 just enough
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:08:30 to keep him up
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:08:53 there is a difference from being able to walk, to being able to walk _**well**_
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:10:02 bc of roblox physics
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:10:16 doesn't have the thing where the weight will increase
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:10:20 bc there are no atoms
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:10:28 unless... rick makes some
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:11:08 yes but not anything like an auto anchor lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:12:08 same thing
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:12:42 i still love how bad u are at physics
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:12:45 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:13:08 tbh
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:13:19 i kinda want rick to make "atoms" of a sort
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:14:21 -rick comes out with block that uses "atoms" and looks like someone compacted a bunch of dog fur together-
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:15:33 bc of the levels
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:15:35 lets just
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:15:37 end this
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:15:45 this is hurting my brain
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:15:57 no
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:16:02 stop
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 04:16:05 not keep going
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:15:35 use wedges lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:16:23 <:CertifiedMoment:570774089099116548>
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:20:03 wedges
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:20:05 1x4
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:20:12 or use disconectors
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:20:14 or drap doors
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:20:17 or half blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:20:25 doesn't have to be
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:20:28 with motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:20:36 motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:20:43 no
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:20:50 just put block behind it
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:20:58 and make the wedge
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:21:01 on the end of them
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:21:07 motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:21:20 motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:21:24 you make the block
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:21:27 by motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:21:32 then gl
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:22:12 skill issue
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:22:30 gl finding me
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:22:46 right
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:22:52 and im mach 400
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:23:00 when im off
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:23:13 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:23:22 idk
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:23:24 use light
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:23:34 to push urself over billions of years lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:23:47 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:23:53 i shoved a conveyor on my counch
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:23:56 couch
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:23:58 and flew off
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:24:06 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:24:37 well now its impossible to slow down
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:24:43 so you are dead
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:24:59 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:25:34 ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:25:46 is that the observable universE?
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 16:26:07 obey physics?
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 17:03:14 luftwaffle
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 17:41:47 reaction wheel production<:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 17:41:57 still got another side
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 17:51:06 is how done
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 17:51:28 watch them all have the wrong keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 17:51:53 they weight a lot
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 17:51:54 so
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 17:52:00 i expact pain to the left side
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 17:53:36 mm yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 17:53:46 forgeting to attach half of the cylinders much
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 18:03:03 plan of things i have to do in plane crazy for the next year that is even remotely related to planes: none
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 18:07:05 improve
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 18:15:40 i think rick got rid of the lag reduction change
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 18:16:37 bc my land cruisers are as slow as a snail again
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 18:17:49 not as far as my land cruisers are concerned
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 18:18:00 for sure
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 18:18:11 bc when it first went out they were faster than light
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 18:18:16 like they are supposed to be
bug-reports 2021-04-11 18:19:58 rick's lag reduction update broke
bug-reports 2021-04-11 18:20:08 slower than a snail again
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 18:27:02 rick did one too
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 18:27:13 i believe\
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 18:28:11 screw roblox
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 20:05:17 bad pc
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 20:06:25 those are easy lmao
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 20:07:25 easy
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 20:07:49 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 20:08:05 motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 20:08:09 with half cylinder 2
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 20:08:15 and half balls
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 20:08:17 if
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 20:08:19 you are going small
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 20:08:40 what
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 20:10:58 looks pretty ez to me
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 20:30:46 what
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 20:30:54 for the back?
bug-reports 2021-04-11 20:57:40 .
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:05:37 who wants to bet this door will fail. its for my helicopter. the left is a plate that keeps it smooth for the planes and tilt up with the actual door to let the heli out and goes back down when i close it
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:06:02 haven't tested since i supposedly fixed it jamming
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:07:07 m yes the plate is stuck
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:08:34 the second land cruiser iim making
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:08:57 i figured i should start getting halfway today
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:11:38 if i extand beyond this the plate glitches into the door
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:14:54 i think its fixed
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:16:03 still needs a lil fixing
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:18:32 
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:18:43 and yes it resets all the way, just did. takes like 15 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:20:19 basically yes.
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:20:37 
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:20:46 ill have a plane too
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:20:50 that hatch os for the heli
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:23:57 
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:24:32 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:29:44 .
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:29:44 
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:29:54 
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:30:17 thu all of it
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:30:25 fixed itself
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 21:30:48 also just as stable as the last one nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:00:33 much approval
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:35:41 conveyor dive
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:35:43 drive
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:38:38 all of them do lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:39:29 material and block don't matter
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:40:33 my design (jnot the fastest) has to be cylinders facing that way
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:41:17 idk
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:45:09 me trying to get my heli balanced
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:47:16 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:53:35 this heli already has a few keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:53:41 frick
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:53:47 forgot to set the ones for elevation
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:53:51 eeeeeeee
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:54:04 well
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:54:05 its fine
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:54:10 ill use r and f lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:54:12 for now
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:56:33 closer to the ramps
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:28:50 ive decided
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:28:52 no heli
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:28:59 just rockets that fly out and bombard the area
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 01:28:28 how is my ship going\
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 01:28:51 .
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 01:30:51 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 01:31:59 nah
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 01:32:02 it would be eight
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 01:32:56 from the battleship yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 01:50:29 cameras will become invisible on spawn. if you select a camera and click a block while building it will angle the camera to that block. any blocks on this camera will then rotate with the camera in spawn mode. cam welds automaticaly sync with main pilot seat and you can't move them relative to the seat. this involves rotating, pushing etc. if you select a block to a camera on the build mode and then move the build up the cam weld will return to original position from when it was selected in build mode. in order to get proper results just make sure the cameras wre connected to nothing but the blocks u want rotated before u spawn. all cameras are reset when u reload
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 01:51:15 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 02:00:24 fun*
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 02:03:50 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 02:15:06 how is so far
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 02:23:20 cameras will become invisible on spawn. if you select a camera and click a block while building it will angle the camera to that block. any blocks on this camera will then rotate with the camera in spawn mode. cam welds automaticaly sync with main pilot seat and you can't move them relative to the seat. this involves rotating, pushing etc. if you select a block to a camera on the build mode and then move the build up the cam weld will return to original position from when it was selected in build mode. in order to get proper results just make sure the cameras wre connected to nothing but the blocks u want rotated before u spawn. all cameras are reset when u reload

plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:40:35 ti sr s wart rv
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:45:21 ive only lost 3 blocks to rockets and guns
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:46:42 k
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:47:47 stop ramming me
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:48:29 VoyagerXavierNaval
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:49:39 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:54:30 iesn't one
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:54:33 also
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:54:50 ther is nothing that goes killometers per second. almost
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:56:29 there isn't one
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:56:48 there isn't one
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:57:11 prove
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:57:44 a block
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:57:49 is 2.5 studs
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:58:05 one block is 2.5 studs
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:58:27 mods
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:58:32 no
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:58:32 or
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:58:43 hyperbit told me
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:58:55 no
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 00:59:00 bc 2.5 studs is one block
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:00:47 1 meter is 2.5 studs
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:01:08 then why are robloxians 5 studs tall
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:01:32 1 block in plane crazy = 2.5 studs
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:01:41 have you not been reading
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:02:07 robloxians are 2 blocks tall
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:02:10 so 5 studs tall
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:02:28 assuming a robloxian is 2 meters tall
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:02:31 or
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:02:35 6.6 feet
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:03:22 is this based off the one block is 2.5 studs and a robloxian is 2 meters tall which = 5 studs
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:03:54 ur stinky
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:04:30 which is?
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:04:36 how tall is a robloxian
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:04:38 bc
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:04:57 ik kerbals are only 4 feet, so can't say robloxians aren't any better
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:05:05 k
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:05:33 5 sps = 1.4 m/s
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:06:02 4s/s = 1.12 m/s
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:06:33 soa round 4 feet
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:06:42 ye
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:06:49 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:07:06 so
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:07:14 one block is about half a meter
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:07:17 or
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:07:18 3/4
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:07:20 idk
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:07:26 between those
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:07:39 who
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:07:44 mine?
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:08:00 robloxian is 2 meters tall
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:08:01 so
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:08:04 2.5 studs is a meter
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:10:48 about 2.4 mph is 1 m/s
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:10:55 just under
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:12:08 so around 3K mph
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:12:33 blackbird was around 2.5K
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:12:45 i believe
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:12:53 studs per second
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:13:00 or "speed"
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:13:11 
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:14:59 <@456226577798135808> sink me bro
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:16:19 took me a week to make my land cruiser
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:17:50 no
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:21:19 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:22:29 make taller
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:22:48 overwhelm it
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:22:54 idc
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:23:05 make skyscraper
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:24:44 i thought u had reset in a large build lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:25:10 ik
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:25:14 took me a sec tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:25:17 to realize that
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:26:23 russian jet with usaf logo on it
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:26:33 never will
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:26:35 or has
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:26:46 and i chopped it

plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:31:51 did you lick your bathroom sink?
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:32:09 oo yay
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:32:12 howd it taste
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:32:32 how good
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:33:06 where was it mined, im sure you can tell by tasting it
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:33:36 LICK IT HARDER
general 2021-04-13 01:33:53 @asdfasdfsdaf
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:34:15 what was the name of the restaurant
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:35:19 they put ground up rocks in a tacobell meal and say its a trade secret recipe
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:36:38 uranium
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:36:40 decays
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:36:45 into polonium
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:37:10 lead i think
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:37:13 eventually
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:37:22 nothing
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:37:24 just lead
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:37:46 a seconds big bang
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:38:47 ASDFASDFSADFASDf
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:39:03 think so
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:39:34 _l i g h t  i t  o n  f i r e_
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:40:10 takes 4.5B years lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:40:43 e
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:40:45 around
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:40:50 5.5 billion
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:41:21 or in this case, eternity
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:41:51 lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:42:19 "kids thats what we are trying to make our species organic substance based off. bc carbon sucks"
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:42:39 lead spaceships
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:42:45 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:42:51 atom
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:42:57 borth
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:43:45 imagine making a spaceship out of lead specificaly to survive the heat death of the universe
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:44:13 tho srsly
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:44:18 if universe keeps going
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:44:29 eventually everything will just become heat energy
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:44:37 and no kinetic wil exist
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:44:47 maybe
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:45:03 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:45:07 teleportation exists
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:45:16 bc two of the exact same thing cannot co-exist
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:45:26 exacly
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:45:41 spacetime bends
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:47:11 <:CertifiedMoment:570774089099116548>
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:47:59 like string theory
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:48:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:48:39 and in order to make the math add up it would have to be bumped up to about 14
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:48:54 or so
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:49:02 black holes decay
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:49:06 so
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:49:10 they don't lead anywhere
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:49:24 unless the gravity is strong enough to bend spacetime enough to go somewhere
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:50:08 prob a black hole
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:50:11 bc
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:50:17 maybe a black holes goes to white hole
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:50:25 (if they exist)
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:50:31 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:50:36 are real
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:50:42 time travel
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:50:45 and teleportation
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:50:50 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:50:58 and you can possibly even link them
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:51:12 big bang?
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:51:27 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:51:35 ^
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:51:58 a black hole in another unioverse sucked up a lot of stuff and sent it through to another new universe
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:52:10 bc of bending spacetime all around the black hole
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:52:37 even our sun bends spacetime, which makes mercury's orbit weird
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:52:51 and ours isn't even able to go supernova
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:53:00 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:53:10 heat dead
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:53:25 theory of graviton is not proven to be true
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:53:29 with gravatons
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:53:40 you could possibly remove or increase gravity from an object
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:54:25 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:55:00 everything = possible seconds big bang
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:56:08 possibly
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:56:09 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:56:14 everything is orbiting everything
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:56:17 so
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:56:19 eventually
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:56:24 they could collide
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:56:28 and create a second one
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:56:54 no
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:56:56 so
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:57:00 they would be obliterated
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:57:07 and brought back the next way around
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:57:25 no we talking about science get outta here
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:57:32 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:57:50 like most things unfortunately
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:57:54 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:57:58 brb
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:59:07 can be converted into energy tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:59:20 they can
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:59:23 and created
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:59:27 fusion and fision
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:59:52 well
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 01:59:56 as far as we know
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:00:11 bc inside quarks
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:00:16 could be gravatons
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:00:54 bc they create light
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:01:11 we have to use electrons and protons to hit them card enough
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:01:14 hard
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:01:18 and fast
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:01:32 essentialy
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:01:34 they are light
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:02:07 theoreticaly nothing, but possibly somthing too
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:02:18 assuming they exist
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:02:26 inside atoms
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:02:40 are electrons, neutrons, and protons, which are all made of quarks
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:02:49 the neutrons and protons make up the middle
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:03:00 the electrons go around the middle in a general direction
plane-crazy 2021-04-13 02:03:16 magnets have their magnetic power bc all the electrons go the same general way

plane-crazy 2021-04-20 19:57:39 level 3 with mee6
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 20:03:41 things just keep getting better and better lol
help 2021-04-20 20:13:19 the bullet is moving the same speed as the plane. therefore it has the same proportions as if it was goin 5, if its going mach 4 as the bullets get accelerated the same amount away from the jet even though its already moving. therefore. unless someone screwed somethin up it can't shoot itself down
help 2021-04-20 20:16:35 saying a plane will shoot itself down bc its going too fast is liek saying iof i throw a rock its gunna hit he in the face bc the earth is spinning while moving around the sun which is also orbiting the black hole in out galaxy's center
help 2021-04-20 20:16:59 yes
help 2021-04-20 20:17:02 due to resistance
help 2021-04-20 20:17:03 but
help 2021-04-20 20:17:14 not fast enough to kill the plane it came from lol
help 2021-04-20 20:17:20 only as much as it normally does
help 2021-04-20 20:17:49 we are talking about real life
help 2021-04-20 20:17:55 yes
help 2021-04-20 20:18:01 but the bullet is affected by gravity
help 2021-04-20 20:18:02 and
help 2021-04-20 20:18:12 it also is moving much faster than the plane
help 2021-04-20 20:18:26 just as fast away from it as if it was sitting on the ground still
help 2021-04-20 20:18:38 just higher up
help 2021-04-20 20:18:41 so if anything
help 2021-04-20 20:18:46 the stats are better for the bullet
help 2021-04-20 20:18:52 bc there is les air pressure
help 2021-04-20 20:18:57 and resistance
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 20:19:45 use springs
plane-crazy 2021-04-20 20:19:54 ikr
help 2021-04-20 20:26:51 the guns being located inside of the walls of the intake, or just under it can be slowed by the intake sucking air in, the plane accelerating in their direction can make it go faster than the bullets, and air resistance all combined can make the plane hit itself with its own bulets
help 2021-04-20 20:26:54 however
help 2021-04-20 20:27:01 going in a level flight
help 2021-04-20 20:27:07 this is not possible
help 2021-04-20 20:27:16 unless
help 2021-04-20 20:27:22 the intake is too powerful lol

help 2021-04-21 03:32:59 never said the bullet would not slow. i said it would fall before it could hit the plane

plane-crazy 2021-04-22 22:41:16 ive never seen ur user
help 2021-04-22 23:09:45 bet you did a lot of reseach and math on that. i actually did the math and found the speed they decelerate. which. is not fast enough to hit the plane before drop. or over time without gravity to do enough damage
help 2021-04-22 23:12:33 depending on how fast the missile is going when you launch it the game will make it go faster by some speed. idk how much faster.

plane-crazy 2021-04-23 02:14:50 yes

general 2021-04-23 04:01:47 chat died again: cameras will become invisible on spawn. if you select a camera and click a block while building it will angle the camera to that block. any blocks on this camera will then rotate with the camera in spawn mode. cam welds automaticaly sync with main pilot seat and you can't move them relative to the seat. this involves rotating, pushing etc. if you select a block to a camera on the build mode and then move the build up the cam weld will return to original position from when it was selected in build mode. in order to get proper results just make sure the cameras wre connected to nothing but the blocks u want rotated before u spawn. all cameras are reset when u reload

plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:40:52 tnt armour = noob
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:40:58 simple

plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:43:11 if you move it far enough out from the pilot seat
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:43:17 it gets too annoying to deal with
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:43:22 just liek shredders
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:43:27 no u
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:44:00 the only skill issues are the ones who can't build a good pvp build without tnt armour
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:44:11 ground
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:44:13 vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:45:17 defien skill. so far all i see is hiding behind tnt playing all mighty

plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:46:16 no its not
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:46:47 then how coem my slightly larger slower hallow non-tnt armoured tanks are superior

plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:47:28 <:trollface:775024642104229898>

plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:48:48 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:48:52 unlike tnt
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:48:56 that can be taken out
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:49:17 50 from where i come from
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:49:36 skill issue?
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:49:49 if ur using tnt vehicles and get taken out after 2 extra shots im worried

plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:51:14 tnt armour
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:51:21 not just a resistor
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:51:25 is what im saying
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:53:05 in my opinion i say if you use that much tnt armour then your the skill issue one too scared to come out and fight properly.
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:53:41 skill issue put it too close to the motor lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-19 23:53:52 so shredders are okay?

help 2021-05-21 23:24:43 its pretty easy
help 2021-05-21 23:25:13 cameras will become invisible on spawn. if you select a camera and click a block while building it will angle the camera to that block. any blocks on this camera will then rotate with the camera in spawn mode. cam welds automaticaly sync with main pilot seat and you can't move them relative to the seat. this involves rotating, pushing etc. if you select a block to a camera on the build mode and then move the build up the cam weld will return to original position from when it was selected in build mode. in order to get proper results just make sure the cameras were connected to nothing but the blocks u want rotated before u spawn. all cameras are reset when u reload

plane-crazy 2021-06-04 15:18:05 lol

bug-reports 2021-06-06 17:11:44 is you aware of this new bug? most of my builds are broken because the suspension blocks are bugged out. anything with more than one joint, or suspension block has seizures. this is an example of what happens
bug-reports 2021-06-06 17:12:04 all motors are unpowered
bug-reports 2021-06-06 17:12:34 this is the least violent case
bug-reports 2021-06-06 17:12:56 shortly after the whole 5K blocks disapeared

plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:02:38 big wheels doesn't mean better offroad
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:02:54 mhm right
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:03:13 ok and?
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:04:17 treads wuld be a better solution here
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:04:23 if has bad offroad
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:05:31 they are plenty more smooth than wheels tho
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:05:50 and well made treads are actually really good
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:06:39 .3 travel?
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:06:51 so
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:06:55 suspension travel
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:07:15 wdym by shake
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:07:53 ah so not as smooth as a tread
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:08:37 ok
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:08:40 cool
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:08:47 but at this point
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:08:54 lag is not a concern for me
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:09:08 i already get an average of 9 fps bc of the suspension
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:09:19 making treads instead would only drop another 2
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:09:32 idc about lag
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:09:42 besides
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:09:55 everntualy lag will be reduce
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:09:56 d
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:09:59 land cruiser
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:11:30 the main issue with the treads would be getting a good grip on them to keep the 10K blocks that is sitting on them from not forcing them off easily
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:11:34 done
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:11:45 im working on painting the back half
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:11:51 and finishing details
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:12:00 prob bc u never made good ones before
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:12:23 they are far more satisfying and have their advantages
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:13:20 big doesn't mean better
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:13:30 its about the shape and dimensions
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:13:39 and also the general quality
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:14:24 ill prove that wrong on my next land cruiser
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:14:44 just like i proved large land vehicles can be effective
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:14:52 k
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:15:40 in plenty of cases yes, but treads also have an equal number of advantages
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:16:11 same
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:16:15 in pc though
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:16:19 its more difficult
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 03:16:23 to replicate

plane-crazy 2021-06-07 04:43:26 possibly
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 04:43:28 but

plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:10:28 so are you
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:10:46 and you also are
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:11:03 but you want to be opn the winning end so you say it befor ehe does
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:11:19 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:12:17 im just never been good with anything small and that has anything to do with being underwater ant some point
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:12:48 ur just as bad as he is
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:12:50 or worse
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:13:03 mhm
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:13:51 bc it will
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:14:35 im refering to the current situation. in this conversation you are just as bad or worse than him at helping the situation
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:14:50 and stop acting like you are better than him bc ur build better
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:15:18 better build. does not mean you are better than him
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:16:37 prob
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:17:06 that was sarcastic right
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:17:50 i can name a lot of reasons why it didn't
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:17:55 for example the nose
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:18:50 the nose has the odd drop off that makes it look really weird, the cockpit it too jagged and a few other things
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:19:20 motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:19:23 and cam weld
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:20:37 its not the fact that motorlock is there that makes a build good. its that its being used well, looks nice, and is actually helping the build
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:22:00 angle lock
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:22:53 <:ElonDisapprove:589136548356685837>

plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:24:07 but
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:24:13 i can very much see it working
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:24:22 <:what:644996672048463942>
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:24:40 its elon with a mustache
plane-crazy 2021-06-07 05:25:57 looks liek when you carve soap and you just cut a lil too deep and ahrd then it comes off and looks like a beaver had a nice meal on it

plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:09:57 <@!743600457548824717> y downvote
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:10:37 not rlly
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:11:43 folding can make things difficult for people who go in pvp, or they hav builds they don't want disabled easily. im not attacking yours but im trying to knwo why u dislike and explain it to you further
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:13:26 its not limited to just that
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:15:39 what if you want to spawn higher up bc there is one of those annoying space station things
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:15:52 so true
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:16:18 ok
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:16:29 it woul;d be great for non pvp builds tho
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:16:38 bc
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:16:50 you get to spend more of your tiem in the same orientation
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:17:09 and its easier to no have to get the perfect shape of something
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:17:54 ik
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:17:55 but
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:18:11 lining things up while in build mode for when you fold is more difficult
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:18:28 like
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:18:42 when you have a room with dif featurs and you need to line them up properly
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:18:56 and
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:19:14 its easier to make less lag with all the types of folding and connection techniques that cause lag
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:19:24 liek mag weld for example
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:19:51 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 19:22:54 debate*

plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:02:11 can drive car?
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:30:14 i just got an idea how to make an auto track missile
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:30:31 its pretty simple so idk if itsgunan work
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:32:26 mhm
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:32:42 planes
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:33:14 by spinning hovers
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:33:54 S.A.M missile
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:34:01 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:34:02 well
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:34:05 should be able to
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:34:12 bv with limited track range
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:34:23 surface to air
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:34:40 yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:36:27 the hover can be placed in the head of the missile or the back
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:36:30 possibly both
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:36:42 preferably the back
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:37:07 lemme put a diagram together
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:37:33 its just an idea rn
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:37:39 idk how well it will work
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:53:38 that was the rocket going off course
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:55:36 
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:56:21 there we go
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:58:14 when its in place the range is a flat disc
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:58:15 but
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:58:30 when you rotate that range of detection
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:58:38 it becomes a sphere
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:58:52 because the disc is rotating on the roll axis
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 20:59:22 it becomes a sphere and when the hover is in the back it pushes the back away from the object which aims the fron towards the target
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:01:12 when you toggle the two axes then the hover on max it will spin and every time the hover detects the plane it will push the back away and move the front direction closer to the plane's location which will repeat and hence auto target
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:01:38 hovers push off other players builds
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:02:06 i just made the design
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:02:17 its not
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:03:43 if you spin the hover fast enough so that it covers all 180 degrees in a spherical motion and place it in the back of a rocket it will move the back of the rocket away from the player's build which moves the direction the missile is headed closer to the location of the target which will make it auto aim.
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:04:30 i have a prototype that i just need to amke
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:04:39 
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:04:55 not in the form of an ai but mechanically it can using game mechanics
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:05:02 it will also track the ground tho
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:05:04 so
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:05:08 you gotta be careful
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:05:13 can't
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:05:19 im not able to get on rn
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:05:35 if you spin the hover fast enough
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:05:49 it will keep readjusting fast enough
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:06:10 50 speed motors
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:06:24 not max torque
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:06:25 1
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:06:50 then how come someone literally showed me it working yesterday
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:06:56 i dunno how he did it
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:07:04 he wouldn't tell anyone for obv reasons

plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:10:06 yet still we find ways to advance
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:10:30 of course its not going to be light speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:10:44 i just thought this up in 5 mins
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:10:56 it can be sped up
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:11:07 someone showed me a dif one
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:11:21 dunno
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:11:28 hes not going to tell anyone
plane-crazy 2021-06-09 21:11:37 for obv reasons

general 2021-06-18 04:13:09 minus the polution it takes to produce the batteries<:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2021-06-18 04:13:30 no. it is the propulsion
general 2021-06-18 04:14:01 just blow all the factories up and use lightning as temporary charges for like 5 seconds
general 2021-06-18 04:14:36 0
general 2021-06-18 04:14:52 for 5 seconds
general 2021-06-18 04:14:57 then
general 2021-06-18 04:15:04 the lightning charge will be gone
general 2021-06-18 04:15:25 my tesla was made of wood
general 2021-06-18 04:15:27 so
general 2021-06-18 04:15:30 when it got hit
general 2021-06-18 04:15:35 i died
general 2021-06-18 04:15:40 and so did my tesla
general 2021-06-18 04:16:02 im talking about on a lightning charge. y'know. from the clouds?
general 2021-06-18 04:16:43 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

general 2021-06-18 04:17:29 we gotta close down the block
general 2021-06-18 04:17:41 yes

general 2021-06-18 04:20:55 
general 2021-06-18 04:21:12 top potential speed of an electric motor is barely sub light speed
general 2021-06-18 04:22:13 pretty easy for an electric motor to beat an ic engine if you ask me.
general 2021-06-18 04:22:47 good for you
general 2021-06-18 04:23:06 tell me what image a i just pinged you with
general 2021-06-18 04:23:20 5 seconds ago
general 2021-06-18 04:23:36 
general 2021-06-18 04:23:39 now
general 2021-06-18 04:23:49 what is the top potential speed of an electric motor?
general 2021-06-18 04:24:06 wrong. just below light speed
general 2021-06-18 04:24:13 because
general 2021-06-18 04:24:20 magnets
general 2021-06-18 04:24:23 work at light speed
general 2021-06-18 04:24:26 and
general 2021-06-18 04:24:30 nothing can go past light speed
general 2021-06-18 04:24:33 so
general 2021-06-18 04:24:39 just barely sub light speed
general 2021-06-18 04:25:24 take the development of dedicated electric cars. and ice cars. then compare the speed
general 2021-06-18 04:25:55 dedicated ice cars have been being built 5-6 times longer than dedicated electric cars
general 2021-06-18 04:25:57 yet
general 2021-06-18 04:26:02 they are almsot the same level
general 2021-06-18 04:26:04 as
general 2021-06-18 04:26:17 no one has actually built an electric car. specifically for speed yet

general 2021-06-18 04:38:45 i ligit used to thing tanks were governed by the laws of physics to go no faster than 10 mph
general 2021-06-18 04:39:26 for soem reason i still thought they were better than everything else tho. even tho ur small child could outrun it
general 2021-06-18 04:40:00 first thing i think when i hear tank lol
general 2021-06-18 04:40:06 when i hear top speed
general 2021-06-18 04:40:18 i go 45 mph bc i engraved that in my head

plane-crazy 2021-06-21 04:54:41 im also fairly certain ball shredders are immune to water
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 04:54:59 and im fully aware that a few shredder designs are not
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 04:55:13 ye
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 04:55:17 they are slow tho
plane-crazy 2021-06-21 04:55:23 one ended

plane-crazy 2021-07-11 17:27:52 so you need to make a small container for best results

plane-crazy 2021-07-12 05:25:12 ok
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 05:25:54 i might do smthin where the player moves a slider around the keyboard by walking, and they press a key using their build that types in one letter like a button when they have it over the one they want
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 05:26:51 u will see what i mean, ill make a 5x5 version for u rn

plane-crazy 2021-07-28 19:30:24 now im ready
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 19:31:16 perfect
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 19:32:39 user in chat is purple, first time for everything
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 21:25:03 BELGIUM?
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 23:44:36 it only saves the latest thing you saved
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 23:44:40 its not like other ones
plane-crazy 2021-07-28 23:45:19 cameras will become invisible on spawn. if you select a camera and click a block while building it will angle the camera to that block. any blocks on this camera will then rotate with the camera in spawn mode. cam welds automaticaly sync with main pilot seat and you can't move them relative to the seat. this involves rotating, pushing etc. if you select a block to a camera on the build mode and then move the build up the cam weld will return to original position from when it was selected in build mode. in order to get proper results just make sure the cameras were connected to nothing but the blocks u want rotated before u spawn. all cameras are reset when u reload
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 01:16:26 ok
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 01:19:42 
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 01:19:45 they are the tiny ones
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 01:19:51 
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 01:22:39 
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 01:26:13 he stopped
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 01:26:21 just had to ask him not to
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 01:26:23 lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 01:55:17 he making a fair build now
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 01:55:21 as awe speak
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 01:55:28 was
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 01:55:28 or
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 01:55:31 until he

plane-crazy 2021-07-29 01:57:20 hes stil here
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:21:19 do you know that tnt is rocket proof?
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:21:25 and
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:21:30 you clearly suck at using it
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:21:46 they are taller than me too
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:21:49 soi really can't
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:22:23 hey, did you know you can distance the internals from the externals?
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:23:04 that doesn't even make sense
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:23:37 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:24:11 it was a tank, that was taller than me, and had all its internals well distanced from the armour
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:24:18 so there was no way for me to win
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:24:26 i no have yet
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:24:28 bc

plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:25:09 like i said, it was a tank
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:25:10 and
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:25:15 he was just as fast as me
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:25:30 he was also hunting me
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:25:52 i have been, but that deosn't mean im not gunan be unhappy

plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:28:57 shut, his case was very rare, and it pisses me off

plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:53:17 who asked for your input
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:54:50 i don't even have a comeback for that one
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:55:37 but still deal with it, i don't like tnt armour
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:56:11 sorry but i can't
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:56:35 ive always hated it
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:56:41 this shouldn't be news to any of you
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 02:59:53 ive lost interest

plane-crazy 2021-07-29 03:01:21 what?
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 03:01:58 i am serious about hating tnt armour
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 03:02:21 <@!761482895617425419>
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 03:03:24 i don't feel anything when i see that
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 03:04:20 they actually did a god job if that happens, with tnt armour all you need is a box with a gun in the middle
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 03:05:03 i armour myself, with not tnt
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 03:05:13 1x7 beams are rocket proof
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 03:05:30 and i add layers of disconectors to slwo the guns down
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 03:06:05 its good if you opponent forgets what guns are
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 03:06:31 no
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 03:06:39 never
plane-crazy 2021-07-29 03:06:53 read my arguements
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 04:09:44 
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 04:10:22 homophobe in chat
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 04:10:27 so
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 04:10:32 that got typed
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 04:10:44 to prove a point
plane-crazy 2021-07-30 22:09:27 <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 05:17:22 same
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 05:17:27 but ill try maybe
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 05:17:30 at some point
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 05:17:42 just remake my cam weld pickup truck with photos
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 05:17:43 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-05 05:18:09 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 02:55:05 sometimes
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:09:48 this is accidentally the room format for my next land cruiser lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:09:49 rgb
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:29:32 <@!313403326081531914> tips if u need any, imma do some work on figuring it ouot a lil bit more today tho: cameras will become invisible on spawn. if you select a camera and click a block while building it will angle the camera to that block. any blocks on this camera will then rotate with the camera in spawn mode. cam welds automaticaly sync with main pilot seat and you can't move them relative to the seat. this involves rotating, pushing etc. if you select a block to a camera on the build mode and then move the build up the cam weld will return to original position from when it was selected in build mode. in order to get proper results just make sure the cameras were connected to nothing but the blocks u want rotated before u spawn. all cameras are reset when u reload
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:30:07 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:34:36 this does not longer work
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:34:39 but
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:34:53 you can chose what blocks do move by using anchor block
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:34:59 you can anchor one side of a weld
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:35:05 liek in a situation liek this
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:35:11 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:35:19 and whichever side is anchored will stay as it is
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:35:27 and the other side will shift instead
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:40:24 oh and which ever side has the anchior block closest to the camera will be biased over the other and will stay as it is, so if you anchored both sides and one side had the anchor further from the middle than the other, the one with it further would shift when it was unahcored,, but whichever one is unanchored first will shift before the other, and if both are equally close it will chose the third link instead. distance from the camera is measured like electricity, the blocks are like a path and it will take the shortest path to the anchor block, and if that path is shorter than another, it will be the biased ones. even if the end is physically further to the weld point, than the one that has a longer path
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:42:12 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:43:22 wikipedia is researching camera weld again
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:43:57 i have notes
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:44:06 in another server
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:44:09 so im not litering
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:44:32 doesn't matter, you can literally twist blocks with it
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:45:24 this camera is sideways, and angled to the block in front
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:45:29 watch what happens when i spawn
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:46:24 
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:47:46 if a camera is rotated when it is angled it will take an upright positions, and rotate all blocks it was connected to by that same angle when spawned
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:48:20 if a block directly connected to the camera, or the block it was conencted to is removed, the camera weld must be redone
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:48:37 not at all
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:50:22 you can literally do this
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:50:25 when spawned
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:50:57 this is when they are conencted to same block
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:51:43 and when set in regular order
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:52:35 cameras will follow the center of mass of a block as the point they rotate to
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:54:29 when connected to red blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:54:38 how so
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:55:13 bet
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:55:16 lemem show u
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:56:40 ur right
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:57:04 must find fix
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:57:35 no they are connected to the same block
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:58:14 liek the center of mass thing?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 03:58:28 how cameras target the canter of mass of a block
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:01:12 well there is nto fix but the small distance is too small to be significant
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:02:38 what?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:03:42 ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 04:04:01 mhm i saw

plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:00:29 suffering from delusions
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:01:17 y e s ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:01:35 done that been there
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:04:34 skill
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:04:49 skill
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:05:50 its center of mass not center of gravity
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:06:06 center of gravitywould eb the center of the gravitational attraction of a body of mass
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:07:01 kidnap them
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:08:00 the center of mass could be differend because it has heavier materials on one side of the body than the other but the gravitational pull is in another location
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:09:03 well it doesn't work for anything but vertical spin
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:09:30 you see you don't need the hovers, and you literally just use a unpowered motor then
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:09:53 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:09:58 has soem resistance
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:10:01 i think
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:10:08 yes
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:10:28 liquid helium literally has 0 friction
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:12:09 imagien the motor was at max torque and reset on it
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:12:14 "0 resistance"
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 02:13:46 make it not a tutorial

general 2021-08-21 16:23:16 how many motor bugs do we think will be fixed in the rewrite
bot-central 2021-08-22 03:47:26 **_{ New Map }_**
**[ PLOTS ]**
`Assuming i hear right, we will be getting 20 player servers. and keeping the plots how they currently are in the game, and just continuing them down in a sing file line will just be inconvenient for all of us. So I was thinking that instead of this, we can do one of two things, or maybe combine them both. #1: simply make a second row and make the baseplate wider. you can extend the baseplate further into the map and just add the second set of plots in front of the other plots, just on the other side (obviously they would be facing inwards). #2: We could arrange the plots in a culdesac arrangement. The plots would just be on a circular baseplate and have the entrance/exit facing towards the middle of the map. #3: Combine them. Basically take the second variation, and give it two openings. like so: ( ) This gives players the a little bit more freedom for roaming the map, and will allow a better central area for all the players to e x i s t in. it will make all the plots slightly more able to reach the ones that are located in what would be less convenient locations and shortens the distance to get from plot 11, to plot 10. Assuming plots are arranged as so: 
1   2   3   4   5   6  7  8  9  10
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
This also makes it easier for planes as they can still take off and land on the baseplate as if it was a runway. #4: you add an opening at the middle front of the baseplate like so:

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:39:06 <@!529111635844136971>  your dumb suggestion would make it so i couldn't use my land cruisers. and many other people can't use their larger builds. are you out of your mind?
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:39:21 the lag kick
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:40:07 i respect that and i do see the practical use but next time just consider other builds that might unintentionally lag
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:40:20 its alright but it could get annoying in a server of undes
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:40:53 there would eb the issue of numbers then
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:41:07 there would only be a few trusted and it wouldn't work well
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:41:17 best thing we can ask for is that <#623337136267067393>  get reopened
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:42:20 1: i hate the idea of scaling tool (don't ask why)
2: scaling too can cause more lag due to being ableto size up blocks and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:42:53 60
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:43:05 it can do both
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:43:36 if we have bigger blocks then there can be a bunch of smaller blocks in and out that collide a ton and causephysics lag
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:44:03 i dislike evrythigna bout the scale tool
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:44:17 ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:44:44 did you guys see the sugegstion that asked for the back of disconectors to get removed when they disconect?
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:45:25 there is a majopr flaw in that. it only considered the motorlock side. not any other side
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:45:34 im going to show you a picture
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:45:36 and yoou
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:45:41 need to tell me the issue with it
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:45:47 between the sugegstion and the build
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:46:34 
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:47:08 no
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:47:11 its about the body
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:47:35 this is the suggestion
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:47:40 mhm
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:47:47 80% of it is
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:48:10 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:48:34 so do a lot of my builds
bug-reports 2021-08-25 21:49:20 help
bug-reports 2021-08-25 21:49:23 there is a fly in my room
bug-reports 2021-08-25 21:49:50 use half wedges
bug-reports 2021-08-25 21:49:58 it stops them bending which is why they separate
bug-reports 2021-08-25 21:50:03 they bend too much and wham they explode
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:50:58 i dunno
plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:51:02 never made enough planes

plane-crazy 2021-08-25 21:57:30 if you ahd a double island carrier, or extended island carrier. it would be okay
bug-reports 2021-08-26 21:30:21 good
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:31:00 what if i...
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:33:40 i love jumping small ravines with this
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:33:47 
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:34:55 imam ditch it in lava
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:43:22 i did it
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:43:24 
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:45:17 just now
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 22:45:25 it wouldn't let me despawn
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:02:25 just drifted my land cruiser across airport
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:03:43 maybe they are a fan of old france. france used to have an all white flag<:pogey:651848693842182144>
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:04:19 volkswagen beetle
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:04:38 drift it
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:04:42 
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:05:01 i died yesterday so bad
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:05:19 turn out 10K blocks, and already terrible physics lag makes a bad combo
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:05:23 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:05:31 i dumped it in lava<:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:05:42 thats why i have -1 fps
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:13:25 liberty ships were overmade
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:13:33 weren't there like 20K made in wwii?
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:15:22 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:16:01 aircraft carriers are overmade to some degree then
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:19:37 sweet
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:20:08 i can name a coupel that are not
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:20:24 for example the first u.s multi role fighter jet
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:22:08 ye
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:22:26 they were meant to last like 1-2 years i think then be recycled or fall apart
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:33:55 im more lookign forwards to when they get the railgun to be practical
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:34:31 they need to fix the exit system when the shell leaves
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:34:37 it damages the rail too much
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:34:45 it only gets 5 shors befor eneedinga replacement
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:34:52 ye
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:35:04 its pretty ez
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:35:06 1
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:35:21 make the rail get slightly thinner 1/3 of the way down till its pointed
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:35:54 2 slightly lower the voltage sent in at 7/8 of the way out, then cut it off as its about to leave then you don't get the current tearing it apart
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:36:17 ik enough
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:36:24 they are fairly simple
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:36:29 much mroe simple
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:36:30 but
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:36:34 optimization is not
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:36:46 ill whip up a drawing for you
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:42:01 
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:43:25 a combination of the current and the heat is what makes it go 'kaboom'
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:44:19 the rails are trying to squeeze the same amount of current through a smaller and smaller space as it leaves which generates a ton of heat as it has to go faster and faster and when it leaves it practically explodes the tips you know what i mean?
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:45:03 the electricity then discharges violently which causes the kaboom and also explodes and melts the tips*
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:46:03 thats not the issue
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:46:15 its the current going through the barrel and the projectile
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:48:59 as the current has to go through a smaller pathway (the projectile part in contact with the metal rails) it has to speed up and as collateral damage it generates a ton of heat, not to mention the buildup of energy in the projectile because the exit pathway is slightly smaller than it was before and energy going in has to go out through a slightly smaller door than it went in which makes the projectile a sort of mini bomb against the rails when it comes out and when it does, both the rails and the projectile discharge explosively which generates a ton of heat and extreme forces against the tips of the rails which badly damage the material they use
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:49:23 <@!481580521244196876>
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:50:04 its the issue the military has with the projectile leaving the new railgun
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:50:09 as well as power issues
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:53:31 thats not why tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:53:52 its only using hte same amount of power as when the whole potential contact area is in contact
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:54:01 the issue is the amount of power its using
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:54:13 not that it speeds up at the end of the cycle
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:56:36 the future is truely electric
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:57:19 the only non-electric thing will be the rockets we use to get to space
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:57:32 ye but they lose a lot of energy through the magnet system they use
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:57:39 and they use permanet magnets
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:58:07 gauss cannons are basically just an underpowered and much more difficult to reload version of coil guns and railguns
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 02:58:27 ill show u
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 03:01:34 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaI9iq5asOE found this
plane-crazy 2021-08-28 03:03:29 imma go
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 01:56:38 does anyone else just mentally assign outlines to their builds without thinking?
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 01:56:45 or is that just me
plane-crazy 2021-08-29 01:56:54 even tho there aren't any outlines
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 20:49:17 <@456226577798135808> ground effect strengthens the force of lift on wings as it is when a craft gets to half the span of itws wing and it creates a cushion of air under it, and drag and lift would be increased in water as it is a more dense fluid than gas oxygen.
plane-crazy 2021-08-30 20:49:25 not decrease
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 02:34:40 ive started working on my land cruisers again
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 02:35:16 ive done that so many times on accident
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 02:43:41 amateur
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 03:25:19 how is exterior so far

plane-crazy 2021-08-31 21:28:45 this is happening live
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 21:28:48 im ingame rn
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 21:37:29 oh yea i crashed
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 21:37:37 im gonna be bac later
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:45:35 still working on it
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:45:42 i make land cruisers
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 00:55:32 <:what:644996672048463942>
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 03:12:14 the good side
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 03:13:21 wings and thristers
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 03:16:36 not so best side, wip
plane-crazy 2021-09-01 20:41:29 lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 00:34:39 are you thinking what i'm thinking?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:20:30 top of my land cruiser looks siiiick
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:26:26 
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:26:31 ty
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:27:01 this man ran all the way here to see it lmao
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:30:03 honestly thats what happened recently to me bc i thought one thing was common knowledge but 98% of the people that were asked, or told did not know it
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:30:29 and im very passionate about the subject
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:30:45 _it still hurts_
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:31:34 yeah imma add smalelr ones later
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:31:46 interior still neds everything that isn't the layout done
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:32:37 i expected better than i got. and it turned out to be the worst
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:35:03 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:36:41 this what ur after?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:37:02 hold up imma add more
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:38:21 there we go
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:38:26 sufficient?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:38:50 not liek its already laggy enough lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:39:02 _I must add those small details_
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:39:42 bruh 1 hr ago i crushed the only skilled shredder user ive seen since a year ago with a tank
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:39:49 you can do it pretty easily
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:43:14 ye
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:43:39 lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:48:14 much sufficient detail?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:48:59 everyone guess how many block it will be when im done
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:49:04 ill reveal, when im done
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:49:22 awfully low
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:49:37 lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:50:10 this one doesn't even have an interior yet lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:50:18 it has the layout
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:50:20 nothing more
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 02:58:53 
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 03:13:13 what

plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:20:01 y
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:20:25 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:20:33 e
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:20:53 if its true then its a good reason
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:21:23 lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:21:37 some spaceship builders are fine
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:21:43 if we are going by that
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:37:05 
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:45:15 no
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:45:26 ty
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:26:41 going great out here
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:31:30 having an offset center of lift gives the wings a better mechanical advantage over the pitch of the plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:31:43 depending on if its forwards offset or rearwards offset
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:31:50 depends on the up or down pitch
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:33:48 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:39:22 no mind me
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:39:28 lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 01:02:53 <@!707133341454958604> hola fromthe left
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 01:03:07 how u tjhink the land cruiser going
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 03:00:27 i added a disposable runway to the land cruiser

plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:47:15 it would to back flips like crazy
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:47:30 and those engine exhausts do not help either
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:47:45 in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:48:06 irl it would be a bomb you drop out of another plane to confuse the enemy
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:49:00 lmfao
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:49:01 
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:49:07 
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:49:33 lemme look at it for a bit
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:56:03 so the wings were moved forwards, rear wings removed, a lot of jagged edges, too many bumpy spots, inflated rear, steel exhausts. moving the wings forwards and removing the rear ones would make it very unstable which would entirely offset the balance of the plane which in and of itself would make the plane become a backflip addict as the rear would be pulling it down from zero lift and the front would be held up producing drag and a whole lot of other things related to this. then the jagged wedges will increase drag and make the plane overheat and mal perform as it will cause a lot of turbulent air that will fluctuate and change the airflow over the vital places of the aircraft, particularly the intakes. the enlarged rear of the plane will further weigh down the plane which would make the f-14 do backflips anyway, so this would either be a rocket or become the worlds fastest backflip enthusiast and would also make it harder for the vertical stabilizers to to their job, it would also create forces that will attempt to turn the plane backwards due to it achieving a teardrop shape, and since this teardrop shape is inverted the craft will attempt to invert itself due to the aerodynamic forces being sustained, then the steel exhausts would further slow, destabilize, and overheat the aircraft in general.
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:56:17 
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:56:52 bumpy spots also create turbulent air which will cause significant drag and mitigate aerodynamic effectiveness
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:58:41 i mentioned the sharp edges not the bumpy spots
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 03:58:57 they would decrease maneuverbility
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:00:32 the wings would widen the craft which would resist the rotation of the craft due to the yo-yo effect (unofficial term) which slows the rotation of a craft by widening the span of said craft, when you decrease the span of the craft by pulling in the mass that is extended which will increase speed of rotation and reduce resistance and effort needed to get good maneuverbility
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:00:46 not why
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:01:20 ?
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:01:41 i can nerd out if i want
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:02:42 i don't judge that
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:02:56 it just makes me feel nice to be able to spot flaws and be able to fix them
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:03:27 nice as in it makes me happy
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:04:25 ok
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:04:59 <@!612627208481144842> press enter
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:05:32 don't ask
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:06:21 motors, the gray oart of the motor does nto collide with blocks so you can actually make the turret work while nto having an ugly hole in the front of the tank
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:06:29 you can use those to make it work
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:06:31 then
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:06:37 do whatever you want for the barrel
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:07:16 i just told you how to get it to work
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:07:19 you can use half balls
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:07:30 no
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:07:33 actually don't
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:07:44 just use a block and a half wedge
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:08:01 block
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:08:14 outside iss half wedges and triangle wedges
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:08:20 then
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:08:26 obv the slopped armour
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:08:37 i proved anime physics wrong
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:08:46 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:08:51 it was pretty easy
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:09:22 i also proved badly how adding wings to a space superiority fighter lowers its superiority
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:09:47 not much
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:10:01 even just a screw sticking out can compromise a section of a wing
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:10:10 irl
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:10:24 thats why planes are so smooth
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:10:35 and cars don't have sharp edges
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:10:43 all round and smooth
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:11:14 sometimes turbulant air can be good for cars and planes, but not the way it was affecting the plane there
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:11:28 for increasing lift
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:11:36 is the good cause
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:12:01 no
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:12:10 drag and turbulant air are nto the same
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:12:22 drag causes reduced speed
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:12:45 bloc
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:13:08 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:13:43 the reason soem airbrakes on gliders have holes in them is to create turbulant air for turbulant drag
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:14:28 anyway am go
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 04:14:30 gn
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 04:09:46 
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 03:44:01 lmfao i just survived 80 degrees almost flipping because i combined the stability system and turning to keep it upright lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 03:44:25 only ballasts, not even in teh right places
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 03:44:40 i don't use helium
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 03:44:43 ever
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 03:45:31 i mean im just chillin here anyway, why would i need helium in this? <@!581412939223924767>
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 03:46:08 _helium user?_
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 03:46:18 i use ballasts to keep me upright
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 03:46:22 it literally spin them
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 03:46:28 to rotate the build lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 03:47:28 i like how this vehicle is 100 feet tall but still has better stability than a lot of cars
plane-crazy 2021-10-14 03:48:25 distorted

plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:51:27 i got nothin either
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:51:32 scissor lift
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:51:37 then make it a scorpion
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:52:17 my friend did it
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:52:29 it works
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:52:56 dunno if he is in pcc
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:53:25 also i don't even remember his username bc of how many people i see on every day
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:54:32 HOW
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:54:37 oh
plane-crazy 2021-10-29 01:54:38 good

plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:10:03 did
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:10:40 better than nothing tho
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:10:52 if you have a gunner its still possible to shoot down a missile
plane-crazy 2021-11-17 22:10:54 but

plane-crazy 2022-01-14 03:05:54 don't know if the engine would have used any tho, other than some kind of way to make the wheels stay all on the tracks on curves and hill tops

plane-crazy 2022-03-12 05:05:07 all of the tabs i have open
creations-chat 2022-03-12 05:13:05 wdym. also bad image it makes the "bridge" or whatever you wanna call it seem lower and longer than it actually is so it looks bad
creations-chat 2022-03-12 05:16:07 ty for that but this is also about 1.5-2 2years old now (minus the paint) so you can't say anything about that.
i also have a tendency to use minimal motorlock on an extreme level

plane-crazy 2022-03-12 05:43:25 then switch back
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 05:45:02 that is related to conflict

plane-crazy 2022-07-15 03:44:28 use piston lock
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 03:45:31 basically locked piston, length you need, and then extend it. you have to wait a few seconds for it to actually lock in place tho
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 03:45:54 or just

plane-crazy 2022-08-19 00:57:59 crappy steering angle and stiff suspension bc very small 3 link but it works well otherwise
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 00:58:42 steering angle is always around 30 bc jeep fenders tend to collide with wheel but whatever

plane-crazy 2022-08-19 01:00:57 ye i have a ballast on front and intend on adding weight to it and adding more later when the back is on
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 01:14:20 or just use a teetertotter and put each one on top and see which side goes down
general 2022-09-07 23:18:56 what do people mean when they say "no cap"? i never caught on
general 2022-09-07 23:22:45

plane-crazy 2022-09-14 04:33:52 remove the "and"
plane-crazy 2022-09-14 04:34:08 fixed essay
or would you like "paragraph" instead? You don't need to make a big deal over people saying there are a lot of words (because most of the time they realize that it actually isn't a lot -- _shocking_)

general 2022-09-16 04:24:02 working scale tool that doesn't weld in dumb spots
general 2022-09-16 04:24:12 or have weird weld habits
general 2022-09-16 04:24:32 so average
general 2022-09-16 04:24:59 that included in that statement
general 2022-09-16 04:25:43 im just wondering how the scale tool will make it easy for us to make working differentials (open)
general 2022-09-16 04:25:51 without being too complicated
general 2022-09-16 04:27:14 ig
general 2022-09-16 04:28:08 he said we can set our own rotations for the blocks like how you angle lock but without angle locking and i'm worried that might cause weird weld issues
general 2022-09-16 04:28:43 thats my primary concern
general 2022-09-16 04:28:57 he said inf map
general 2022-09-16 04:29:43 so motorlock might still be necessary on a larger yet smaller scale?
general 2022-09-16 04:31:11 
general 2022-09-16 04:31:27 all of him

plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:17:50 If you don’t like it that might be because it’s more for people who like to build drivetrains and other complicated stuff including things with logic and small computers. Aero isn’t that good unless you change material but that’s the same for some other things there. It’s better that plane crazy currently is but I don’t think it will hurt plane crazy at all. Especially when pc2 comes out
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:22:05 That’s not entirely wrong too tbh. Suspension builders aren’t boring btw…
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:24:30 My jeeps use a custom solid axle because solid axles and similar dependent suspensions handle better when rock climbing than independent. Different suspension types and geometries  give you different performance aspects and tbh sometimes it’s really hard to keep track of. So I see why you say it’s boring, not many people like to make suspension and drivetrains
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:24:59 It’s quick and easy
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:25:45 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:26:48 Even tho the mechanic map is much much larger it is slightly less well put together and has less things to do on it for some players
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:27:05 Mechanic map and pc map are on similar levels if you ask me
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:27:56 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:28:37 The word is censored
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:28:55 Great
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:31:14 <@448677698773057547> but yeah overall I think the game is serves its purpose amazingly but still needs a couple things sorted out (mostly just the map) and I’m personally sticking to it for those reasons, and so that I can make gps map systems.
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:31:52 It is possible and I have made a three dimensional radar
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:32:07 But that sums it up
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:37:28 Servo motors are the Roblox issue
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:39:35 Basically the differences are this: mechanic4 is for more serious people when it comes to complex things and plane crazy is more lenient towards people who like to mess around
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:44:28 When pc2 comes out both will have some kind of scale tool variant so I wouldn’t be worried about that either
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:47:08 But so far. Mechanic4 has better build system and even a kind of scale tool. It’s a bit hard to use but it works well. For example you can motorlock up to three blocks with an offset tool and rotate things with it similar to motor locking. But it is a little disorienting and stressful sometimes
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:47:30 I’m not sure what to think yet. What is it for you specifically?
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:48:44 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:49:51 It’s different. My radar doesn’t lag at all btw. I think it’s just a less optimized problem that pc suspensions have that causes the lag
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:52:25 Unfortunately both games have an unhealthy amount of stigma towards each other. The problem is that even though mechanic4 is similar, I totally recommend starting with plane crazy because it’s easier and more fun for people to start with until they have a good experience level
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:52:35 Is pretty silent
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:52:39 Sadly
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:53:16 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-24 04:54:00 Yeah a kid joined the game and rage quit because the logic was too hard for him

creations-chat 2023-03-31 01:11:41 I almost just willed reaction perms into existence to agree with you

Also you sound a lot like me during a time of my life I’m not so proud of tbh
plane-crazy 2023-03-31 01:14:53 Having access to expert servers isn’t a flex
creations-chat 2023-03-31 16:56:20 <@573545578001334272>  A-10 thunderbolt and A-10 Warthog are two different versions of the same plane btw. Not sure what the difference is but they are different.

Nevermind it’s actually the same plane but earned the name warthog in service so actually you are correct
plane-crazy 2023-03-31 17:01:54 Make turret lighter or add multiple motor 2s. You can also add wing panels that are rotated so they resist the turret rotation and that should help too
plane-crazy 2023-03-31 17:02:36 And lower speed helps sometimes too
general 2023-04-01 03:09:56 ty
