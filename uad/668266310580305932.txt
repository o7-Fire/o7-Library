plane-crazy 2022-03-11 01:26:05 my configs wont save in my files lately
bug-reports 2022-03-11 01:28:06 <@!466793357318815744> Not sure who to ping but i've been after config saving issues for all of my builds. I've done the work to edit configs on some of my builds but for some reason the files wont save it.
bug-reports 2022-03-11 01:28:13 It's getting really annoying.
