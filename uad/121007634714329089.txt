plane-crazy 2018-11-17 22:33:40 the real question is will they ever have the block with the corner chopped off as a wedge item
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 22:37:03 they have it in robocraft
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 22:37:25 its literally like take a block, take a big knife, and chop the corner off
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 22:57:50 https://gyazo.com/8470b325553b10a5806698c97dbcabdf.gif
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 22:58:56 https://gyazo.com/02acae7e2f16e25173e2650c97280712.gif yeah... pod racer...
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 22:59:35 its really weird actually
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 23:00:27 the goal was just to have a really long rope with a rocket on it, but I discovered that the rocket doesn't really have much thrust to pull you until you pull the rocket close enough to you, then the rope glitches out and you get pulled along easily
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 23:02:09 https://gyazo.com/3d95ea342e215f6cb45725eec9c799f7.gif
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 22:25:30 you havent really played this game until you've stuck a bunch of pistons together with a bunch of motors spinning them so you can yeet things off the map
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 22:26:10 how do u make a lag machine
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 22:26:29 *I do*
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 23:03:17 someone is holding a race in my server where you need to make a car using only wheels and 1 jet engine to power it'
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 23:03:39 so, like any normal person, I made a noob pickup truck and spammed tons of rocket engines under the floor cause he isnt gonna look there
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 23:04:13 ~~or that but I want to see his reaction when my massive pick up truck leaves him in the dust~~
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 23:06:30 ok so when I spawn a block appears under my car, except it isnt there when im building
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 23:06:33 and it cant be deleted
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 23:06:35 so thats fun
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:13:18 is it possible to build a gun that shoots balls
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:15:34 uh
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:15:37 minor problem
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:15:44 the springs shoot themselves out of the barrel
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:16:12 https://gyazo.com/ae52174e83deaf24f047e7a40f8cc6c1.gif
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 22:17:38 how to you make springs stick to other blocks?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 21:35:38 noice
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 21:52:18 how do u submit for the various building/flying related ranks?
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 22:03:24 how do u use disconnectors? when I use them they pull the part that im trying to disconnect back
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 22:04:51 I think I might be misunderstanding what they are
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 22:05:08 I was under the impression that if I had, say, a rocket and I used disconnectors I could break off a part of the rocket
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 22:05:44 however it appears that these just make it smaller because they just delete the middle beam leaving the bottom plat between the stages of the rocket (which are still connected)
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 22:06:15 *facepalms*
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 22:06:31 never mind its because I forgot to make the bottom stage of the rocket move back
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 22:06:38 it was just ramming itself back into the rocket
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 22:29:15 whats with this thing where instead of making engine noises it goes "bluhbluhbluhbluhbluhbluhlbuh"
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 22:30:23 
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 01:18:45 can someone send a picture of a wheel that I can reference when building
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 01:53:43 how do you make a vehicle turn w/custom wheels
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 01:54:31 yeah I was thinking of something like that
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 01:54:39 I just cant think of a system
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 01:54:46 im the dUmb

plane-crazy 2018-12-09 13:56:38 uh
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 13:57:13 hey ik u
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 13:57:38 I wonder if this counts as a flying machine 🤔
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 13:58:00 or a steam punk machine that uses no helium blocks to fly
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 13:58:09 lol
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 13:58:25 I know
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 13:58:55 glitch master: build a machine capable of flying using exclusively glitchy physics
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 13:59:22 ye
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 13:59:30 which I suppose is a good thing
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 14:00:34 I cant crash a server but I can make it a hell with almost 4500 spheres
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 14:01:30 https://gyazo.com/f9d466e4f52ab5aaecbabc8cd66f4d8b I just pushed this car off the edge and it started gliding away
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 14:49:01 https://gyazo.com/f6f7797f6f66d92c9646bcd0636ad20c.gif
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 14:49:10 blendified
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 14:54:49 I know
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 14:54:55 I was gonna give credit but I didnt know who made it
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 15:04:07 tbh building your own isnt even that much cheaper than buying premade at this point
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 15:04:22 plus s/he wants a laptop which you cant really build yourself
general 2018-12-09 15:05:26 yes you can upgrade it, but if the goal is to have a laptop buying and building a desktop isnt going to do much for you
general 2018-12-09 15:06:01 they do, but they are also portable
general 2018-12-09 15:10:25 sure
general 2018-12-09 15:10:32 its a great monitor
general 2018-12-09 15:10:51 I kinda want to buy a smart watch but at the same time idk what I would use it for
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 15:20:00 so I built a thing that just spins a really long piston arm around really fast
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 15:20:18 and apparently its really good at glitching itself to go fast as hell
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 15:23:25 https://gyazo.com/85b07752795459418eb9ec289d381f97.gif
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 15:23:26 yeet
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 15:26:23 fun fact of the day
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 15:26:43 with this weird rope glitch, u can pull heavy stuff with very few rockets
general 2018-12-09 15:56:51 https://gyazo.com/faa97ec39d37b73de60b4577128db365
general 2018-12-09 15:57:15 so apparently by spinning a long arm of pistons and repeatedly expanding and contracting them, you can pull yourself forward really quickly
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 16:16:04 https://gyazo.com/b06ca34491b5631fdcb332d2e2a189c4
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 16:16:30 cheating for what
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 16:16:47 yeah..?
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 16:16:59 🤔
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 16:17:22 oh im just trying to see where the speedometer caps
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 16:18:01 https://gyazo.com/5babfddc38aa657076937c926449ca8f.gif
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 16:18:07 believe it or not, this was once  a cube
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 16:19:47 you know, now that you mention ranks
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 16:19:57 does this qualify for the "speed demon" ranks?
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 16:21:00 https://gyazo.com/faf55ad69a2866b3d0c8134a8af6824b fucking hell
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 16:22:01 the torque made me have to go through everything I have that uses motors and adjust
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 16:22:03 so that was fun
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 16:23:18 https://gyazo.com/d8373c920671c855d3fc824627a9971a.gif see! told you its a cube!

plane-crazy 2018-12-09 17:30:32 *please, enlighten me brothers*
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 17:30:58 technically this would eventually get there but it will take a really REALLY long time
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 17:31:44 ~~super's testing game isn't even fun its just her wallet~~
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 17:32:23 the real question is why was nebirion never put into dragon vs

plane-crazy 2018-12-09 19:00:08 which is lucky for me because otherwise I would be banned for epilepsy links
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 22:19:28 https://gyazo.com/ad1c5fa5d64fff87936fd5c5d4eb9f06 the first leg is complete
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 22:19:41 now to hope that I remember how to remake it
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 22:19:54 because if I dont... well that would suck
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 22:20:34 the claw was from a crane I made
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 22:20:51 now im taking the claw out and building a hover craft around it
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 22:23:29 honestly idek how u would get inventor
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 22:23:46 it says "unique" but it would have to be unbelievably complex to not have been used before

plane-crazy 2018-12-09 22:49:10 you know I probably should have made the body how I wanted it before making the legs

help 2018-12-09 22:50:24 like an osprey?
help 2018-12-10 00:07:16 yeah but he said like a helicopter so I thought he meant the osprey specifically cause it has those rotors
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 00:08:34 question
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 00:08:38 why even bother with auto save
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 00:08:41 if it doesnt auto save

plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:19:23 oh for fucks sake
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:19:30 it crashed and I hadn't saved
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:20:19 I didnt test it yet
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:20:23 so all is most definetly lost
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:20:43 well not all
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:20:50 most of the engine is there
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:20:53 but the controls are all gone
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:21:06 ~~which is the only hard part~~
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 01:23:17 saw someone using an engine that consisted of a layer of magnets, a layer of suspensions, a layer of blocks, more suspensions, and more magnets

plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:07:19 are lag machines not allowed?
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:07:25 <:thonking:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:08:17 what if the *dont* have a use besides lagging a server but you don't really use them
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:08:34 im building one to see if the concept works but I dont plan to be that dick who crashes every server
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:09:06 even on private D:<
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:13:36 well someone else with the same lag machine crashed the server before I could test it
plane-crazy 2018-12-17 23:13:41 so I guess thats that lol
general 2018-12-18 19:41:55 
general 2018-12-18 19:42:59 Bruh moment
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:12:48 auto assume
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:13:10 anyways yeah its usually pretty easy to follow rules
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:13:20 ~~like not posting animal cruelty cough~~
plane-crazy 2018-12-18 21:14:33 idk if he did, I was referencing a different event
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 17:00:48 Lights in general are dangerous
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 23:17:38 every time I spawn in my creation to test it the server crashed
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 23:17:40 :/
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 23:18:00 well this s u c k s

plane-crazy 2018-12-20 23:49:49 my tardis seems to be broken
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 23:49:56 every time I spawn it I crash
creations-chat 2018-12-20 23:55:58 [Tardis]  [The Dark Fluffle#5595]  [498]  [none (cant fly yet)]
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:27:22 minor problwm
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:27:30 whenever I spawn in my tardis I crash
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:27:56 I think spawning
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:28:12 I did a thing with the lights where I set each window to a number so I can make them spiral on and off
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:28:18 that might be causing the crashing
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:28:36 never mind its just spawning
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:28:53 lets see 8 3x4 windows and 2 on the top
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:29:05 98 lights
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:30:55 its in creations if u wanna see it
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:33:42 yup its the lights
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:33:52 im going to make it a checker board of lights an blocks
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:59:53 <@165614835302793216> my tardis works >:D
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:26:56 well
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:27:02 my tardis doesnt crash servers anymore
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 01:27:12 but now its just unbearably laggy

plane-crazy 2018-12-22 00:44:46 honestly wtf game
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 00:44:58 this thing is only 950 blocks and its lagging so hard
general 2018-12-22 03:05:46 What are "pc servers"
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:08:13 well fuck
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 21:08:17 I crashed while over save data

help 2018-12-26 17:09:53 I removed the middle one and all it did was make me fall off the tracks
help 2018-12-26 17:10:37 it was 15 speed...
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 17:35:48 https://gyazo.com/591e993fa66ab4adb5b140f4af95acb5
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 17:35:48 ok seriously game wtf? why can't I place a block here?
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 17:38:37 thx\
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 17:38:53 im trying to get the top to be much lighter than the bottom so it balances
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 17:38:58 not working too well
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 17:42:40 ok question: if a large part of the top of my creation is helium, and a large part of the bottom is balasts, you would think that it would stay straight as it moves because any tilting would cause the bottom to swing back under, right? thats the theory I have, but for some damn reason the game is giving me the middle finger and my creation is swinging around anyways
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 17:42:44 any idea s to why..?
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 17:45:29 auto save gives me the middle finger every time lol
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 17:45:51 like yesterday when I crashed but I had been play testing my creation, so you would think that all the times I spawned in would make it auto save
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 17:46:05 but when I rejoined it loaded a creation from like 2 hours before
help 2018-12-28 21:46:21 honestly I have no idea how to use wing panels
help 2018-12-28 21:46:31 when I use the automatic controls, they work like crap
help 2018-12-28 21:46:40 when I set my own, they barely work
help 2018-12-28 21:47:05 so I basically have to chose between bad controls that work or good controls that dont work very well
help 2018-12-28 21:47:21 ~~essentially I dont know what im doing and so it doesnt work~~
help 2018-12-28 21:48:18 sorry not wing panels, control panels
help 2018-12-28 21:52:16 ah I see
help 2018-12-28 21:54:05 well while you're here, I don't suppose you could help with this as well: I was attempting to make my tardis fly, but it kept rolling and flipping over. So I decided, hey, if I make the top out of helium and the bottom out of balasts, any attempt to roll over should straighten out because the bottom will be forced under. So I did that, except it still rolled over
help 2018-12-28 21:54:20 am I just severely misunderstanding how physics work or why doesn't this work?
help 2018-12-28 21:54:59 it wasn't moving forward, just up

help 2018-12-28 21:57:37 ...
help 2018-12-28 21:57:46 I dont think this game goes that far into depth
help 2018-12-28 21:58:02 this is a game were a block of helium can get you to escape velocity
help 2018-12-28 21:58:04 no, it doesn't
help 2018-12-28 21:58:40 *steinfeld theme*
help 2018-12-28 21:59:13 yes actually please do because I am really confused as to why it doesnt work lol
help 2018-12-28 21:59:34 ~~not that it matters the save deleted it but I can pretty easily recreate it~~
help 2018-12-28 22:00:47 I will go through the design and see if I placed a stray block
help 2018-12-28 22:01:52 dude the game doesn't use a realistic physics engine
help 2018-12-29 00:46:51 <@328413257092169729> the first motor turns it, say, right at 20. Then the second turns left at 20. They cancel out. The bottom spins at 20 and the top remains still
help 2018-12-29 00:49:17 <@194241218811658240> not sure, had that happen to me. I did 2 things: 1) rejoin (might do nothing, I did this first and then did step 2) and 2) I didnt alter what it looks at. It might just be that when you turn the cameras to look at something they end up getting locked in place (maybe so they dont turn/fall from the direction they are supposed to be pointing in)
help 2018-12-29 00:51:44 Also cool looking... thing. Lol didn't see it very well but looked cool, especially with the... unrendered engines?
help 2018-12-29 00:52:47 I probably can't but I'm certainly willing to try

plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:05:54 it happens to me all the time
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:06:14 like easily 1 out of every 10 missile shots does it
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:06:27 especially the 1st time I fire

plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:11:49 I know
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:11:58 but this dude fired like 10 missiles and it did that every time
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:12:03 just thought it was interesting
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:14:12 do anchors start on or off?

plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:14:32 ok thx
bug-reports 2019-01-08 20:45:34 Every so often firing rockets ends up launching you (more with some builds than others). No idea why this happens, or what sorts of things make it more likely to happen and, as far as I can tell, nothing consistently does it but it does happen, sometimes frequently
bug-reports 2019-01-08 20:46:33 This has probably been reported but I wanted to make sure
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:04:34 should I (try to) build a leerjet or a supermarine spirtfire?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:05:02 🤔
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 22:06:08 ~~mine will almost definitely suck btw so the difficulty to build should be considered~~

plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:28:16 so I keep seeing these little commies putting a hammer and sickle on their builds
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 19:29:06 So I am going to build a mech or something that has a giant ass cannon that folds up, but is only used as anti-communist measures
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 20:41:12 are there any guides as to how to make a folding thing?
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 20:41:18 I am going to make my first folding creation soon
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 20:41:51 oh thats what the new thing was
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 20:42:03 I thought they edited the directions for the door thing lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 21:15:06 whats the difference between a winter wheel and a normal wheel?

plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:49:16 reasons to use 1x1s: if you have to change something in the design, you dont delete half your fucking creation

plane-crazy 2019-01-11 21:50:25 cool wings

plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:07:31 oh nvm it says fix coming soon
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:10:10 we dont rlly need one
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:11:38 if you think this game requires constant updates to be fun, you aren't the target fanbase
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:11:47 tho yeah sci fi weapons would be cool
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:12:14 a game like dinosaur simulator lives update to update but this game's structure doesn't require constant material
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:12:48 we just got a ton of new parts
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:13:00 besides, just use what is there and you can build a ton of cool shit
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:13:11 eventually a new update will come then u can use that to expand on ur builds
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:13:30 the only thing I can see that is really needed is more storage
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:13:37 im deleting so many builds
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:14:24 I could but I dont really want to have to switch accounts to use stuff
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:14:39 I mean im going to eventually
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:15:08 right now I still have noob builds cause I only started a month or so ago
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:15:30 also its not having to log in
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:15:32 that takes like 2 seconds
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:16:05 its having to leave the game to get there (and maybe I wanted to show someone something, then I have to find the server again)
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:16:25 also why would you want build mode only
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:16:37 ~~unless thats a joke~~
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:16:57 so if ur on mobile u can only build is what ur suggesting
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:17:01 sounds good to me
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:18:37 is there a block to cleanly connect 2 square sides and a triangle side?

plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:33:35 brothers, I have made a dire mistake
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:34:01 I made the top of my turret first
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:34:07 now I need to build the base, from the bottom
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 22:34:17 and building looking up sUcks
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:10:23 tfw you have been playing for so long that you think the same thing about your design as you did hours ago and think it was deja vu

plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:15:45 does anyone else start to have server lag when building really big things?
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:15:51 like, blocks start to lag when placing
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:17:29 aaaaaaa
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:17:36 it wont let me move my creation up
plane-crazy 2019-01-11 23:17:47 which means I cant make it as tall as I want

plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:47:25 can we do something about tnt rammers
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:47:32 they take no skill to make and are obnoxious
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:57:14 <@!168154760866693120> no, I just find it obnoxious when you put effort into something and it gets its ass kicked by some dudes block of tnt on wheels

plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:55:59 👀
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:56:55 btw is it just me or are the automatic controls for control surfaces suck?
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:57:21 I know
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:57:31 but they are all shaky and wobbly
plane-crazy 2019-01-18 22:58:34 like when I am slamming my mouse into the edge of my screen and the plane gives me a middle finger and doesnt turn
help 2019-01-18 22:59:55 new question: how to I make automatic controls work?
help 2019-01-18 23:00:28 I have several planes that work fine with keybinds but the moment I use automatic controls the thing starts to shit itself as it wobbles and shakes and, in many cases, doesnt even turn
help 2019-01-18 23:02:33 like tf is it doing with this little .000000000000001% turn on the control surfaces for yaw so it can turn in 4 hours
help 2019-01-18 23:03:00 basically, how do I make automatic controls turn via roll and pitch so it can atleast somewhat function
help 2019-01-18 23:04:49 yeah I know that part
help 2019-01-18 23:05:05 but after I get the surfaces in the right places, it seems like the automatic controls only want to use yaw to turn
help 2019-01-18 23:06:12 1 sec
help 2019-01-18 23:11:38 ok sounds like ur right because I tested it with my best plane and (while it was still rather slow while turning) it wasn't doing the wobbly stuff

help 2019-01-18 23:12:47 I guess its just crappy fighter design causing the auto controls to not work on my mini fighter builds
help 2019-01-18 23:14:52 I just wanted to use mouse cause I have heard its better for fighers as it makes aiming easier
help 2019-01-18 23:15:08 also when I try to control it, my aim sucks because im tilting all over the place
plane-crazy 2019-01-19 04:23:12 help giv team build my friends keep quitting cause i cant help them

plane-crazy 2019-01-21 15:15:19 I always get them wrong when I put controls in
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 15:15:35 so then I think "well if its always the opposite, what if I put the opposite of what I think I should put in"
plane-crazy 2019-01-21 15:15:39 and then they are still wrong

plane-crazy 2019-01-23 23:09:51 then they have people spending hundreds of dollars for mediocre ugly headphones
help 2019-01-23 23:10:25 also a movement system would be appreciated as using the motors powered doesnt work and using rockets on the center wheel doesnt work
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 00:46:26 That front is h0t
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 00:48:15 I think my appendix is about done exploding

A bunch of people: literally the word "subnautica"
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 00:53:38 malicious get in the vip server and help me make my bootleg version of ur build
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 00:54:25 he has a cool, as he calls it, monowheel
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 00:54:35 basically a rlly big wheel with a pod thing in the center that hes in
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 00:54:57 so I took the basic idea behind it to try to make my own
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 00:55:03 except its crappy and doesnt work
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 00:57:37 yeah thats what I was doing
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 00:57:41 but the center part moves anyways
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 00:58:11 I have some
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 00:58:16 I just spammed a ton to see if it fixes it
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 00:58:22 testing in a sec
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:14:28 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:14:48 it still spins over when going really fast
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:14:58 but it can move normally
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:15:04 oh right
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:15:06 memory 0
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:15:18 im gonna make the outer wheel wider too so it stops falling over
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:16:38 https://gyazo.com/3e18fcd030703dbe96e5a9918fe99980.gif
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:16:42 mission failed
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:17:29 floaty things best things
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:27:17 ok
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:27:23 the wheel can move forward and back and the center is stable
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:27:33 now I need to make it turn without falling over
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:27:43 oh and maybe a way of getting up once it does
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:29:30 it cant turn in motion lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:29:39 it can turn normally but while moving it just falls on its side
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:33:07 I do that to
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:33:12 except I dont do it once and then stop
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:33:22 I just keep on eating it without chewing and burning myself
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:33:29 *I am very smart*
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:35:59 I mean the wheel can move
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:36:01 its a bit bouncy tho
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:36:45 malicious how do u keep ur wheels from falling over?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 01:45:03 rubber blocks would actually be rlly good

creations-chat 2019-01-24 19:54:36 lets play will the bot work with gyazo
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 19:54:50 I think it disconnects
creations-chat 2019-01-24 19:58:08 the correct answer is no
creations-chat 2019-01-24 20:00:27 I made a spitfire a while back but never posted it so... yeah? it flies pretty well and has pistons to push the front landing gear up so it has that angle, tho the landing gear can't go to the sides like they should because the game doesnt do that. oh and it has missiles on the bottom but thats just for pvp. anyway hope you like it :D
creations-chat 2019-01-24 20:00:33 
creations-chat 2019-01-24 20:00:40 
creations-chat 2019-01-24 20:55:27 so I made my first wheelie b0i... uh... yeah. its a wheel. thanks to <@!99607451300548608> for the idea and help with *minor* things like making it work and making it not fall over every 2 seconds

plane-crazy 2019-01-24 21:26:58 hey I saw that trex skeleton yesterday
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 22:45:12 my new wheel is beautiful
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 22:45:36 its not done yet
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 22:50:27 is that my orange <:eyes2:525319504721608705>
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 22:51:06 how dare you take my color and use it for yourself after I discovered it on a build that was completely based off of yours!
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 22:56:14 my spitfire needs 2 more upvotes for master replicator >:D
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 01:19:18 <@!99607451300548608> https://gyazo.com/d448a10280df6cc108474205422e3059.gif >:D
creations-chat 2019-01-25 01:27:07 I made a bigger and better wheel :D this one handles far better, can move faster without bouncing and turning itself, can turn while moving, and can tackle some small hills. Also I think it looks nicer (at least design wise).

plane-crazy 2019-01-25 02:00:22 https://gyazo.com/c439ff5b0930e09b6eaad0ded9603f55 so that happened
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 02:38:37 is there a way to brute force your way through the blacklist wall
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:48:04 Hey wait I could get master designer
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:48:32 I do that all the time
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:48:38 Not that incredible
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:48:44 But build stuff then delete it by accident
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 15:53:17 Tf is that
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 15:53:31 I have never seen that
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 15:53:48 That glitch
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 23:04:31 giv craft 2 enter blacklisted plots
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 23:22:15 this is the stupidest convo
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 23:22:24 he knew that someone had made the concept because of course they had
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 23:22:29 but he did not copy them
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 23:22:42 its like if I built a heli, I didnt copy anyone but I also dont think I invented it
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 23:25:08 im actually really impressed with myself because I am making a ship based of the dalek mothership and I made the circle of 5 rotating half circles at the bottom and then when I finished I realized I probably just screwed up its balance so I set it up on a half gyroscope to test it and its perfectly balanced
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 23:25:16 basically I did something right and that never happens to me
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 23:28:05 tank track 👀
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 23:28:09 <:eyes2:525319504721608705>
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 23:28:18 *professional typer*
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 23:38:11 l0ng tail
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 23:39:00 nono iz not bad thing iz funny
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 23:39:28 *wait a second*
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 23:39:33 *are those custom control surfaces*
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:43:37 bird
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:45:53 so do thrusters not have even thrust or whats going on here
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:46:10 cause I made this thing *perfectly* balanced and it is still tilting when it flies
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:46:23 also cool... long thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:46:32 u haven't showed the full thing lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:46:55 I myself plan to build a wide thing once I finish being aweful at the game
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 00:51:21 is it just me or does anyone else always inverse controls for *only* tilting up and down
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 01:41:18 people should stop making youtube tutorials for specific builds and instead make tutorials explaining concepts so people can apply that and make their own stuff
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:15:19 wheres the vip server link
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:16:30 D:<
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:16:50 I wanted to show u guys my ufo :C
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:21:21 the max I have ever used it 600 rockets
creations-chat 2019-01-26 03:22:58 so I built a ufo... cause why not. It was originally inspired by the dalek mothership but I later change it because 1) it didnt look like it and 2) I wanted to do my own colors. also the bottom lights spin and it can move in just about every way imaginable
creations-chat 2019-01-26 03:23:06

creations-chat 2019-01-26 03:23:23 
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:24:50 100 supers isnt enough many times tho
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:24:54 my wheel uses like 150
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:25:17 and my ufo uses 500 because of all the wings I need to make it not tilt over
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:25:54 *pls no nerf supers*
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:26:02 *that would destroy all my builds*
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:27:11 ~~rlly tho if u nerf the amount of supers u will murder me~~
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:29:04 probably
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:29:15 which would mean, yeah, for big builds if u nerf it to 100 supers
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:29:19 I have 500 rockets on my ufo
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:29:27 thats like 1600 rockets then
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:33:33 how about we leave supers alone but make the bigger rockets more powerful
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:33:35 yesyes
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:33:49 <:eyes2:525319504721608705>
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:34:02 make ur own
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:34:05 u can make a guided missile
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:34:17 I mean it would be nice to have as well tho
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:36:27 can we not nerf the amount of supers (or atleast if u do, leave old builds that have more) cause I honestly dont see why we should destroy tons of people's builds over some trolls, not to mention if we do then the trolls win
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:37:37 ye
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:39:09 <@!324607962079297536> hey I saw that ship
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:39:18 it was weeks ago tho and it was in really early stages
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:39:31 0h
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:40:28 who are these people who make cool builds then make them a tutorial so their builds are now hated
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:45:42 we need to have a banning system
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:45:44 so vip owners can ban
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:46:09 I mean from the vip server
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:46:10 not the game
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:46:34 if someone is raiding ur vip server, u can ban them form the server
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:49:01 again, if vip owners could ban people from their servers we could just ban the lag machine trolls
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 03:54:07 google says     210-180-140
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:24:10 Integex why dont u use cameras instead of glass for that army that lifts the very top up?
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:24:26 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 05:27:14 Upvotes are rigged confirmed
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 17:59:38 can we fix the "sounds client" option
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 18:01:02 noice
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 18:02:30 can u even join vip 1
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 18:02:36 it said the link was invalid
plane-crazy 2019-01-26 18:03:22 also does anyone have a design for unfolding wings that stops them when they are parallel to the body
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 16:30:57 is it better to use magnets or motors for builds that are too large for the plot?
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 16:31:51 oki
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 21:11:54 https://gyazo.com/72d81c94a88edb1780eac1306b1332ed should I do the indented version or just blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 22:07:47 for the life of me I cannot figure how to fold this thing 180 degrees
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 22:08:05 I tried using the one in tutorials
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 22:08:07 it doesnt work
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 22:08:10 (for this build)
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 22:18:32 ok I got the one in tutorials to work, I just had to make it a block further out
plane-crazy 2019-01-27 23:28:42 <@!340543153922768906> epico 😎
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 01:47:53 big builds are so laggy
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 01:59:23 https://gyazo.com/94a95f774740a5175f1ac5458d2f8f74 that was one powerful missile
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 01:59:54 it doesnt seem to work tho

plane-crazy 2019-01-28 18:06:37 ~~add imperial's modular thruster idea yesyes~~

plane-crazy 2019-01-28 21:59:01 oki
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 21:59:20 primarily a bomber
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 21:59:29 all the rectangles in the middle are bombs
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 21:59:39 also has a lot of guns but its too laggy to use them
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 21:59:51 oh and it can blow itself up incase you want to do that
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 22:01:06 my first plane was a vtol that was designed entirely with symmetry in mind
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 22:01:25 it didnt even have control surfaces cause I couldnt figure them out
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 22:01:31 it used propellers to turn
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 22:15:55 👀
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 22:16:11 what's high?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 23:11:09 how do u do the fly glitch
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 23:17:41 so is there any way to make big creations not murder the server
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:30:24 any of you know how to make big things not destroy servers
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:30:39 theres only 2
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:30:43 my main seat, and a seat to balance
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:30:46 ah yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:30:47 engine
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:30:50 that is likely the problem
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:31:01 yeah mine has like
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:31:07 alot of engines
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:31:22 oh yeah can I get server exterminator?
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:31:31 1 sec
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:31:34 lemme get da screenshots

plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:34:20 if you do please tell me because I honestly cant remember
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:34:25 I just vaguely remember the design
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:34:46 I have another ship idea that I vaguely remember but idk what the design is from
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:35:25 huh
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:35:39 I dont remember seeing it in game, I thought it was from some sort of show or movie
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:35:54 I dont believe so, our only shared server is this one
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:36:32 ~~my ship can't fight for shit~~
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:36:50 unless you want the server to be unbearably laggy in which case it can fight very well
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:37:08 ah yes thats where I got the idea for the rings

plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:48:45 but the problem is that I will definitely not do it right
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:49:48 I will send it to you if I can find an example
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 00:53:49 its similar to the resistance bombers in star wars the last jedi

plane-crazy 2019-01-29 01:32:14 copiers are annoying
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 01:32:55 I just leave before they steal it
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 01:33:07 then they are left with half a creation that they cant finish because they don't know how it works

plane-crazy 2019-01-29 21:24:04 probably pretty small
plane-crazy 2019-01-29 21:24:12 the ship itself is massive so for scale any turret would be small
