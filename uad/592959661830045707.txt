help 2022-09-14 16:32:24 I dont get this crap on other servers jeez
help 2022-09-14 16:34:17 i assumed hidden stabiliser was just this game's terminology so I didn't think I'd find it on google
help 2022-09-14 16:34:50 Thats exactly something an overweight double chinned 40 year old moderator would say
help 2022-09-14 16:35:01 the hidden part confused me ðŸ˜…
