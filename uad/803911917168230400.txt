general 2023-04-27 04:00:22 <@736368724940030103>
general 2023-04-27 04:01:42 Yup basically if we had us wealth
general 2023-04-27 04:02:14 Us has like
general 2023-04-27 04:02:19 400 kcs
general 2023-04-27 04:02:23 and a lot more
general 2023-04-27 04:03:31 I used the kc-46 instead of the kc-135
general 2023-04-27 04:04:07 its australian
general 2023-04-27 04:04:10 Also by boeing
general 2023-04-27 04:04:14 and im australian
general 2023-04-27 04:04:17 so im including it
general 2023-04-27 04:04:37 are ac-130Js obsolete
general 2023-04-27 04:04:45 or should i still keep the 25 of them
general 2023-04-27 04:06:08 id have to agree with you
general 2023-04-27 04:06:31 sure
general 2023-04-27 04:06:42 and an somewhat old air-frame
general 2023-04-27 04:06:59 plus it uses propellers
general 2023-04-27 04:07:05 so outdated reelellele1‚Äôqnnqnqqm
general 2023-04-27 04:07:09 !1!1!
general 2023-04-27 04:09:09 What should i replace the ac-130 with
general 2023-04-27 04:09:29 Yep
general 2023-04-27 04:09:32 that isnt outdated
general 2023-04-27 04:10:15 F-35 is a flyby tho
general 2023-04-27 04:10:23 Ac-130 stays consistently active
general 2023-04-27 04:11:09 So slow my disabled grandma who is 5 feet underground can probably shoot it down
general 2023-04-27 04:12:32 a-10 only good for countries with little to no AA
general 2023-04-27 04:12:35 like afghanistan
general 2023-04-27 04:15:13 Wait can you tell me how the f-35 can somewhat replace the ac-130
general 2023-04-27 04:16:06 It is a hybrid
general 2023-04-27 04:16:14 (multirole)
general 2023-04-27 04:16:19 would be logical
general 2023-04-27 04:17:48 a grandma could shot down an A-10
general 2023-04-27 04:18:15 shush bro
general 2023-04-27 04:18:21 it has a refueler
general 2023-04-27 04:18:25 an awacs
general 2023-04-27 04:19:02 Im swapping all ac-130s for f-35s
general 2023-04-27 04:20:31 A-10 is slow though
general 2023-04-27 04:21:39 dark blue name trying not to say whitename moment
general 2023-04-27 04:22:09 It will be soon
general 2023-04-27 04:22:45 it was used in afghanistan when there were little to no AA
general 2023-04-27 04:23:49 updated
general 2023-04-27 04:25:17 reformed 25 ac-130s to 50 f-35s
general 2023-04-27 04:27:07 What else should i add or change
general 2023-04-27 04:27:43 we have awacs
general 2023-04-27 04:28:07 <@835005635359801406> except for cas what else is it missing
general 2023-04-27 04:28:14 thats vital
general 2023-04-27 04:29:06 Good but i was also considering f-16s
general 2023-04-27 04:29:08 Hm
general 2023-04-27 04:29:13 F-15 or F-16
general 2023-04-27 04:29:31 Air superiority?
general 2023-04-27 04:30:23 I might go with f-16
general 2023-04-27 04:30:49 But what does the f-16 have that the f-18, f-35 and f-22 dont?
general 2023-04-27 04:32:44 Ill consider it
general 2023-04-27 04:32:47 Anything else?
general 2023-04-27 04:33:37 Thats the MQ-28s job
general 2023-04-27 04:33:53 You should read a bit about it
general 2023-04-27 04:37:38 Is that why its so slow
general 2023-04-27 04:38:53 But how would the A-10 do ground missions
general 2023-04-27 04:38:58 in lets say
general 2023-04-27 04:39:02 russian territory
general 2023-04-27 04:39:06 or american
general 2023-04-27 04:40:17 it relies on air superiority fighters, also the a-10 is already destined to be replaced
general 2023-04-27 04:40:23 by the f-35
general 2023-04-27 04:40:32 which is my air forces main fighter
general 2023-04-27 04:42:10 it can destroy heavy vehicles as well
general 2023-04-27 04:42:31 a-10 is like a hammer
general 2023-04-27 04:42:35 powerful
general 2023-04-27 04:42:36 but slow
general 2023-04-27 04:42:43 and easy to destroy
general 2023-04-27 04:43:42 Cant the f-35 do most what the a-10 can
general 2023-04-27 04:44:21 but far faster, manuevarable, and stealthy
general 2023-04-27 04:44:46 A-10 lacks stealth
general 2023-04-27 04:45:17 The A designation is about to end up like the P designation
general 2023-04-27 04:45:33 either way
general 2023-04-27 04:45:50 the A-10 will be mauled by a SAM
general 2023-04-27 04:46:38 not this guy again
general 2023-04-27 04:47:23 both are useless
general 2023-04-27 04:47:41 unless they modernise the A-10
general 2023-04-27 04:47:50 wake up to reality
general 2023-04-27 04:48:37 while P can be somewhat useful
general 2023-04-27 04:48:53 There are many other planes that can take over attack planes job
general 2023-04-27 04:49:10 bombers, multirole?
general 2023-04-27 04:49:32 fair fai
general 2023-04-27 04:49:35 but
general 2023-04-27 04:49:42 when is the next attack aircraft
general 2023-04-27 04:50:37 Apaches are good but im not including helicopters
general 2023-04-27 04:50:53 so do i keep ac-130s or not
general 2023-04-27 04:51:27 thats what i mean
general 2023-04-27 04:51:38 i meant the old P designation
general 2023-04-27 04:52:02 exactly
general 2023-04-27 04:52:09 thats whats gonna happen to A
general 2023-04-27 04:52:47 the usaf is replacing A-10s with F-35s
general 2023-04-27 04:52:52 coincidence?
general 2023-04-27 04:52:58 I THINK NOT
general 2023-04-27 04:53:10 yes
general 2023-04-27 04:53:48 imagine a 130mm gatling gun
general 2023-04-27 04:54:46 patrol is like
general 2023-04-27 04:54:50 50% useless
general 2023-04-27 04:54:59 Attack is like
general 2023-04-27 04:55:03 60% useless
general 2023-04-27 04:55:23 As they are replaced the best CAS option availble
general 2023-04-27 04:55:58 Eg?
general 2023-04-27 04:56:07 that isnt outdated ofc
general 2023-04-27 04:57:11 mneh
general 2023-04-27 04:57:18 should i add back the ac-130
general 2023-04-27 04:57:23 <@736368724940030103>
general 2023-04-27 04:57:26 <@835005635359801406>
general 2023-04-27 04:58:10 mmm
general 2023-04-27 04:58:20 25?
general 2023-04-27 04:58:30 alr
general 2023-04-27 04:58:32 20
general 2023-04-27 04:58:36 no
general 2023-04-27 04:58:50 A-10 sucks unless there is no AA
general 2023-04-27 04:58:54 and planes
general 2023-04-27 04:59:09 also known as vietnam pr afghanistan
general 2023-04-27 05:00:13 like flr stops 700 sams coming towards it
general 2023-04-27 05:01:05 Ill agree with you there
general 2023-04-27 05:01:13 but it isnt fit for modern combat
general 2023-04-27 05:01:54 They have tried
general 2023-04-27 05:01:59 the congress stops them
general 2023-04-27 05:02:54 You have a point there
general 2023-04-27 05:02:59 choose 1
general 2023-04-27 05:03:03 A-10
general 2023-04-27 05:03:08 Or AC-130
general 2023-04-27 05:03:40 Well only 1 for the limit of planes
general 2023-04-27 05:04:29 what is better in general
general 2023-04-27 13:50:17 my manz us has like 250 active kcs in general
general 2023-04-27 13:51:53 a person who makes a lego bomber that can fly
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 14:51:48 that was
plane-crazy 2023-04-27 14:51:51 1 day ago
general 2023-04-27 15:38:34 i put my bid on biplanes
general 2023-04-27 15:38:45 hundreds of em too
general 2023-04-27 15:40:33 my guy is thinking in another dimension, another human plane beyond our understanding
general 2023-04-27 15:40:39 reject modernisation
general 2023-04-27 15:40:45 accept biplanes
general 2023-04-27 15:41:04 exactly
general 2023-04-27 15:41:25 and they are faster
general 2023-04-27 15:42:00 im ‚Äúbuying‚Äù child soldiers rn
general 2023-04-27 15:43:03 It only costs 20 dollars worth of chocolate to fully train a child solider, while it costs crap ton of supplies to train them
general 2023-04-27 15:43:25 just give them an anime body pillow, 30 dollars
general 2023-04-27 15:44:22 but what if the enemy is also smart
general 2023-04-27 15:44:26 and knows this
general 2023-04-27 15:45:00 smart
