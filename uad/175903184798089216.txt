The Tale of badslippertrompet (175903184798089216)
creations-chat 2019-12-01 02:00:47 I would like to present my Chain Driven vehicle. 
Via magnets, pistons and heavy use of motors I have managed to make it work. If you would like to see the mechanics, I'll have to rip open it's insides. It has steering but it's not great. One of my images where I am diagonal in comparison to the plot tiles is supposed to prove it can steer. 

Block count 3015 (images will follow after this)
