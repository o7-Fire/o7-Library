plane-crazy 2021-02-16 01:54:56 How do you even fly a jet when the moment you pitch up you slap your face at the ground
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 01:56:34 I seriously can't stop slapping my face at the ground the moment I pitch up
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 01:56:57 The jet is stabilized, just I don't know how to fly without slapping my face at the ground
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 01:57:00 Yup
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 01:57:15 It's already at 1
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 01:57:38 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 01:57:43 Wait you can go that far?
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 01:57:47 Didn't know that
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 01:58:04 Well I won't be building any irl jet
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 01:58:10 Idk why but I like custom jet more
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:02:43 Just pitch and turn
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:03:55 Aileron
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:03:58 You use aileron
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:04:36 The one that is made out of motor and panels
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:05:27 Pog
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:05:34 I haven't try using motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:05:38 But I know how it works
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:05:42 Just haven't used it
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:09:18 Just make a motor
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:09:23 Stick some blade
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:09:34 And you got yourself a 5 bladed propeller
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:09:35 Maybe
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:43:22 How do you even take off with motors-
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:47:38 I literally can't take off without slapping my face everytime
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:48:18 Using pitch
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:48:21 And engine
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:48:26 The basic jet take off
bot-central 2021-02-16 02:48:42 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:49:06 I just slap my face when I tried to pitch up
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:49:24 I lowered the speed and tap it lightly and still slapped my face
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:49:43 It basically flipped everytime I try to take off
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:50:13 The jet flipped
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:50:35 Backward
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:51:44 I already put a beam/1x4 of ballast in the nose and less wings for the elevator
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:51:54 It's already stabilized just a bit
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:52:10 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 02:52:27 Gonna test it out again
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 03:05:03 The jet won't fly
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 03:05:08 It just stuck there
