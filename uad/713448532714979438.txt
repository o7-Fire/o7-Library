general 2022-11-02 03:30:29 bruh they need to bring back reports
plane-crazy 2023-03-16 18:01:53 Does anyone know how to make an antigravity engine without using the gravity slider? The gravity slider affects everything instead of just the attached blocks so it doesn't work for what I want to do.
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 23:03:30 Seat eject?
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 23:03:31 Yea
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 23:03:33 Thats me too
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 23:03:40 Was just about to come ask that
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 23:03:45 No clue
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 23:04:48 For some reason it doesnt happen when Iâ€™m not sitting on the build itself, but instead outside of it
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 23:04:51 So
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 23:04:58 Maybe put your seat in a different place
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 23:05:01 Then attach a camera
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 23:05:32 Angelo, did you see what i said?
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 23:05:42 Ok
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 23:05:50 Yeah i feel that
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 23:05:55 I made a tie striker and i want that too
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 23:05:56 Lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 23:06:16 Same
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 23:06:22 ðŸ’€
bug-reports 2023-03-21 23:07:14 Yea we canâ€™t fly anything with this bug
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 23:09:25 Oh btw
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 23:09:34 Does anyone know how to make an antigravity engine
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 23:09:49 So that you can stop your aircraft midair and it just sits there
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:08:24 How are people building these ludicrously large builds that just float in the air without the gravity slider then without using helium blocks and stuff
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:08:34 Genuinely asking cuz thats confusing as heck
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:09:01 Anchor blocks canâ€™t move without unlocking though
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:09:14 What
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:09:27 Nova?
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:09:36 Oh
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:09:39 Typo
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:09:51 Thatâ€™s funky
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:10:02 But like
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:10:22 Does it enable horizontal motion without vertical motion
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:11:30 Folds?
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:11:52 Not by that name
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:11:54 What is it
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:12:04 Oh
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:12:07 That
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:12:08 Yea
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:12:15 Combining blocks right
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:12:49 Clipping components together
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:13:06 Oh that
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:13:13 Literal folding
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:13:25 Yea i do that
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:14:00 Yea
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:14:43 What Iâ€™m trying to do is make a space ship that can move on the X-plane without having to move on the Y-plane
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:15:10 Kinda like a UFO but not restricted to hovering a certain distance off of the ground
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:15:34 And Iâ€™m trying to achieve that without using the gravity slider
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:17:16 Regardless of its weight?
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:17:18 Like
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:17:22 Hang on a second
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:18:09 I cant send pics here
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:18:13 Can I dm you them?
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:18:18 Its of the ship
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:18:36 I donâ€™t know them off hand
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:18:53 I had to fold a tiny bit of the front into it
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:18:56 So yea
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:18:57 Like
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:19:08 One plot long, half a plot wide
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:19:17 Plus like
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:19:20 10 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:19:26 On the front
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:19:43 I see
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:19:52 Not sure
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:19:55 Like
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:20:06 10-15 roblox R6 characters
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:20:32 Yea
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:21:46 Yeah that seems about right
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:21:51 Like
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:21:52 So
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:21:58 Its wide in the back
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:22:00 But like
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:22:05 5-6 blocks wide in the front
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:22:10 Its a halo Paris Class
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:22:14 That shape
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:22:21 No
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:22:28 Halo Paris Class Frigate
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:22:32 From Halo
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:23:09 Yea
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:23:27 Oh i have so much more than that in there ðŸ’€
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:23:31 I have like
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:23:42 30 hover engines with max drag and min speed
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:23:48 In each section of the ship
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:24:08 Then again I used hover engine piston drives to make it actually move
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:24:36 Only thing is
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:24:41 It falls down
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:24:44 Like
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:24:48 When gravity is applied
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:24:51 It falls
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:25:02 Unevenly too
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:25:21 I have a bunch of wing panels inside of the armor plate sections
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:25:29 On the back and side and inside the nose
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:25:56 Alr
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:26:25 Iâ€™m probably gonna have to check the settings on every single hover engine on the left now ðŸ’€
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:26:43 Oh wait I forgot that option existed
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:26:48 Lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:27:03 Alr thanks guys

general 2023-03-23 23:32:22 welp everyone died
general 2023-03-23 23:32:27 oh hi lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:33:19 <@845723629676920842> here it is so you can see what Iâ€™m talking about
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:33:34 
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:33:38 
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:33:40 Yea
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:33:59 I havenâ€™t tried
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:34:12 Its an old build that barely functions in the old plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:34:34 Was gonna rebuild it in the new one but centered around an antigrav drive
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:34:42 But they donâ€™t exist lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:34:49 I donâ€™t
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:35:02 Conveyor engines are incredibly difficult for me to understand lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:35:10 ???
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:35:24 I know I just canâ€™t seem to get them to work
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:35:29 ðŸ’€
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:35:34 Of course
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:35:43 Atat tank
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:36:03 Yea
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:36:27 I opt to use the hover piston engine instead of conveyor
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:37:42 I think he answered his own question lmao
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:37:59 Dam
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:38:13 Hm
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:40:20 I tried making a tie striker in the new plane crazy development game but I canâ€™t figure out how to get it to stay upright or fit the required elements into the body so it actually functions ðŸ˜­
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:41:08 Wait i forgot about motor locking again
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:41:11 Nvm
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:41:30 Its a newer version of plane crazy

plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:41:59 This
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:45:40 Wait a second there are ID codes for builds??
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:45:59 I was about to say
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:46:11 Bro i woulda friggin died
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:46:22 Starfighter
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:46:29 OHHH
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:46:33 X-wing
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:46:41 I need to make one
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:46:49 To go with my U-wing
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 23:47:00 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 05:00:28 Nothing
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 05:00:29 lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 05:00:52 Itâ€™s just different bugs
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 05:00:59 Not even less just different
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 05:01:07 No
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 05:01:20 Seat ejecting
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 05:01:35 Random physics failures
plane-crazy 2023-03-24 05:01:41 Etc
