conveyor drives also doesn't have a cap speed and just lose frames even when not used and on the ground

felipe's thing

mhm
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:02:59 scroll up a bit their explanation was you take something put it at an angle and glue it to a board
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:06:55 yeah im also confused but kinda believe it a bit since felipe was involved
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:11:04 I kinda believe it to be true since he's been building the same plane 4 months ago then remade it?

<@822911577849462834> I meant same vehicle design from 4 months ago

<@551376778552410113> no clue

<@690727914521493504> he remade it by the looks of it since the proportions are off
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:15:59 yeah this is getting too complicated y'all just ping me if its real or not

<@822911577849462834> ping fail

creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:43:04 its just a weirdly proportioned Just cause 4 plane

Lmao don't attack <@870152086044700682>
creations-chat 2022-05-26 22:51:25 Earlier he explained it was Smoke pipes with tnt and "magnet locking" I have an idea for the magnet locking thing
