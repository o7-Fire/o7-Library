general 2020-12-04 07:53:32 could anyone answer this question: can you get ranked with stuff like "VTOL Specialist" and things like that without posting a build in creations? As in could you just personally dm a mod clips and stuff instead of making it public?

creations-chat 2020-12-23 06:52:29 a non-creation was just posted and deleted, right?
creations-chat 2020-12-23 06:54:36 it depends if the tutorial is well known or not
creations-chat 2020-12-23 07:01:14 the way to stop this is to either take a picture with less of the titanic so its mainly their actual build or to point out the build
creations-chat 2020-12-23 07:07:44 "I don't even know (titanic @Deadly_Pr0YT (sorry for pinging you again)) My build is the tiny one on the right." would work <@!485229989537644547> change the 0 to an O so it actually pings them if you want it to
creations-chat 2020-12-23 07:09:45 alright well it seems this whole, blob of messages is sorted
creations-chat 2020-12-23 07:11:46 voice typing? maybe they have some type of screen that can make braille from like 2043
