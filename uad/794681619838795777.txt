bug-reports 2021-05-29 00:14:13 There are 2 people in my server using glitches to kill people and I am not in a PVP server.
bug-reports 2021-05-29 00:16:24 
bug-reports 2021-05-29 01:59:54 I left the server a while ago, and sorry for the late response, but they had tanks, trucks, and monster trucks that would kill anyone that touches it, even in non pvp servers, i tried to zoom into one of the vehicles, but it seemed hollow/empty other than some walls inside. They were also 1v1ing each other, they were able to crash players as well. When they would fight, the opponent's build would glitch and the suspension would stretch out and the build would scatter. For some people, they would just respawn rather than glitch and appear in the sky with their builds scattered. Also, I do not know if this is important or not, but they also said "it does not break any rules i checked", they even mentioned that the bug had been there for a while.
bug-reports 2021-05-29 02:05:14 their usernames are in here
bug-reports 2021-05-29 03:05:11 I am aware, but it is still a glitch
bug-reports 2021-05-29 03:05:35 It does not just fling, they can crash people as well
bug-reports 2021-05-29 03:09:06 Now thinking about it, I think that they used the suspension to do it
bug-reports 2021-05-29 03:32:41 I do not, but I have a screenshot of chat with their usernames
bug-reports 2021-05-29 03:34:11 It looked like a truck that killed anyone it touched or glitched things and made the suspension stretch and the build glitch, I did see it also crash someone
bug-reports 2021-05-29 03:34:40 Their usernames are in here
bug-reports 2021-05-29 03:35:26 I couldn’t tell, but the inside seemed to be hollow
bug-reports 2021-05-29 03:36:43 I’d assume it is their username seeing how it is in chat.
bug-reports 2021-05-29 03:37:05 Well, there was 2
bug-reports 2021-05-29 03:37:24 And they were 1v1ing and respawning/killing anyone who got near
bug-reports 2021-05-29 03:37:43 And if you somehow survived, they would stretch out your suspension and glitch your build
bug-reports 2021-05-29 03:39:05 I set my gravity slider to 1000, and yet they still managed to glitch my builds
bug-reports 2021-05-29 03:48:31 I do not know
bug-reports 2021-05-29 03:49:56 I did not really pay attention to how many blocks there was at the time
bug-reports 2021-05-29 03:53:30 All I know is I joined the server, two people were 1v1ing with vehicles that can crash, glitch, and kill people on non-pvp servers, then one of them crashed, they rejoined, then they started killing players including me, then told me they are not breaking any rules and the glitch had been there for a while, after that, I attempted to zoom into their builds to see what they were doing, but only saw it was hollow with some random walls, as of now, I think it may be suspension, I don’t know if I am correct or not, but that is my guess so far.
bug-reports 2021-05-29 03:59:06 I got to go for now.

bug-reports 2021-06-14 18:04:09 I found a bug where when you color text in signs or change it to different sizes, some text in the sign gets deleted or the color changes on its own when you save the build then reload it, for example, i wanted my sign text color to be white, i saved, reloaded, now its gray.

help 2022-05-26 03:04:19 Can anyone help me build an apache attack helicopter? With myself, being terrible at making helicopters, I used 3-4 different tutorials, all of them were broken or not detailed
help 2022-05-26 03:35:04 But I want to
creations-chat 2022-07-08 17:37:36 no, it was way different
creations-chat 2022-07-08 17:41:12 I didn't but when I mean "revamp", I mean the entire thing was way different, I basically just used the tutorial as a template
creations-chat 2022-07-08 17:45:57 I just used it as a template then completely redid it
creations-chat 2022-07-08 17:48:02 it was from a few years ago when there were outlines on the blocks
creations-chat 2022-07-08 17:50:33 I'm trying to find it but I can't find it now
creations-chat 2022-07-08 17:52:39 found it, here is the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtA3nTMK0MU
creations-chat 2022-07-08 18:05:04 then what should i do to customize it more or make it better?
creations-chat 2022-07-08 18:08:15 two things;
1: they should turn cooldown to 30 seconds
2: I am pretty bad at making rotors, when I tried to make a Sikorsky RaiderX, everything worked, except for the rotor, no matter what rotor design I did or how much I modified it
creations-chat 2022-07-08 18:10:21 I did, and it still didn't work
creations-chat 2022-07-08 18:12:25 this is the closest thing I have found to "working", yet it keeps flying up and down, and does not hover or anything. On an attack helicopter, it can't just be climbing up the way it currently does
creations-chat 2022-07-08 18:18:04 Also, I do agree with you about not doing tutorials, it takes weeks or months for them to finally upload videos of them building the aircraft or vehicle I actually want them to build. The thing is that I can copy the helicopter pretty well and make it pretty realistic, but the problem is the rotors, helium blocks, and ballast blocks, I don't know where to put them, or I don't know if they're needed at all
creations-chat 2022-07-08 18:27:39 I litterally have everything done except for rotors, everything else is 100% functional, missiles, guns, move forward/backward, turn, etc
help 2022-07-08 18:33:42 How should I do the rotors for this? Every design I have tried so far has failed
help 2022-07-09 03:47:30 I need help creating rotors for my attack helicopter that are stable, fast, and can hover
help 2022-07-09 06:12:23 Can we do this around 12AM CDT - PM CDT?

help 2022-07-12 16:14:31 wait
help 2022-07-12 16:14:39 i didnt realize it had 4 more missiles on the sides
help 2022-07-12 16:14:45 i thought it had 5
help 2022-07-12 16:37:58 but how do i make the rotors
help 2022-07-12 16:38:06 every rotor design i have tried has failed
help 2022-07-12 17:21:24 maybe you accidentally placed a block? i don't think graphics can affect physics
help 2022-07-12 17:21:43 or maybe it's unbalanced
help 2022-07-12 21:49:02 So can someone help me build rotors for this?
help 2022-07-12 23:50:50 I want a type that is not fake, can fly fast, hover, and not go crazy mid-air and lose control
help 2022-07-13 05:07:34 I have a heli that needs to go faster than 300, and it needs to be easy to control so I can fire missiles
help 2022-07-20 16:48:20 I need help creating rotors for my *Boeing Advanced AH-64E Block 2 Compound Apache Attack Helicopter*, I have tried many tutorials, none of which have worked
help 2022-07-21 17:20:56 I need help with rotors for my Boeing Advanced AH-64E Block 2 Compound Apache Attack Helicopter, it has 626 blocks total, and every rotor design I have tried has failed
help 2022-07-21 17:21:11 
help 2022-07-21 22:07:20 Can someone please help me with this?
help 2022-07-21 22:11:56 Already tried that
help 2022-07-21 22:15:41 I need rotors that can fly fast, and is good for PVP
help 2022-07-21 22:16:22 No, the helicopter would look bad with dual
help 2022-07-21 22:16:38 Plus, in real life, this helicopter is not dual
help 2022-07-21 22:17:01 Boeing AH-64E Block 2 Compound Apache Advanced
help 2022-07-21 22:17:40 Can you look at a real picture of the helicopter, then tell me what I should do for it?
help 2022-07-21 22:19:04 It has one, but it’s not where you think it is on the helicopter
help 2022-07-21 22:19:08 In fact, it has 2
help 2022-07-21 22:20:15 But I don’t like no gravity because then it makes turning 500% more difficult, and makes the helicopter act up when going forward or in reverse
help 2022-07-21 22:22:09 Okay, I can do that, but how do I make it hover and fly?
general 2022-07-21 23:12:42 In roblox?
general 2022-07-21 23:15:28 I have never had a warning in this discord server, but my last roblox warning was like last year, when I was in a roleplay game and said that I was a police officer in-game, I don’t remember reading that saying “I am a police officer” in a roleplay game is against Roblox TOS
help 2022-07-22 00:13:45 But how do I make it hover at any height without moving or pressing anything?
help 2022-07-22 00:13:57 Without 5000 helium blocks
help 2022-07-22 00:14:16 Then it would just keep going up
help 2022-07-22 00:14:50 What?
help 2022-07-22 00:15:37 But I shouldn’t have to press anything
help 2022-07-22 00:18:44 Is there an easier way?
help 2022-07-22 00:20:09 No, I mean hovering
help 2022-07-22 00:20:12 Not taking off
help 2022-07-22 00:20:47 Say if I wanted to hover above the water without going up/down, or moving, how would I do that, at any height?
help 2022-07-22 00:21:50 Currently, my helicopter goes 600-700+ **on the ground**, because it can’t fly yet
help 2022-07-22 00:22:04 It is heavily armed
help 2022-07-22 00:22:51 I saw that, but one of my major concerns about rotors is that the drag will be changed, and my helicopter will start making loops when going forward/backward
help 2022-07-22 00:26:27 Where do I put them? Anywhere?
help 2022-07-22 00:27:21 My build is literally a small attack helicopter, a 2-3 hundred blocks
help 2022-07-22 00:28:15 Here’s a screenshot of it
help 2022-07-22 00:29:36 Oh, forgot
help 2022-07-22 00:30:33 Also, quick question. Does TNT work kind of like armor minus explosions?
help 2022-07-22 00:31:12 Should I try to put it near the sides by the weapons so the motor lock doesn’t get destroyed as easily?
help 2022-07-22 00:32:37 So how should I protect the motor lock? Earlier when I was testing it, a jet flew past above me, and destroyed all my weapons on one side, in just one shot
help 2022-07-22 00:33:17 It still had no rotors then
help 2022-07-22 00:33:29 I was testing weapons and strength
help 2022-07-22 00:34:03 Should I motorlock more TNT?
help 2022-07-22 00:34:30 In real life, it can survive .50 cal shots
help 2022-07-22 00:34:57 The body has no TNT
help 2022-07-22 00:35:02 Only the sides
help 2022-07-22 00:35:10 Should I change that?
help 2022-07-22 00:36:28 I am terrible at making rotors in general, I have 2 helicopters without rotors
help 2022-07-22 00:36:40 Both are 100% custom
help 2022-07-22 00:36:51 Not right now, I will be like 5-10 mins
help 2022-07-22 00:43:41 I know how to make those, but my helicopter requires non-dual rotors
help 2022-07-22 00:45:10 Here’s a picture of what I am doing
help 2022-07-22 00:45:11 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/995386175869169794/999360231794561024/Screen_Shot_2022-07-20_at_12.00.25_PM.png
help 2022-07-22 00:45:44 But the back one is mainly to go forward
help 2022-07-22 00:46:20 There are 3 rotors on the helicopter
help 2022-07-22 00:46:27 Main rotor, back rotor, side rotor
help 2022-07-22 00:46:58 That’s what I am doing
help 2022-07-22 00:47:30 Also, what is the color for the helicopter on the far left?
help 2022-07-22 00:47:37 Like what color would I do for that
help 2022-07-22 00:58:07 drag is currently fine, not going up/down yet
help 2022-07-22 00:58:26 here's the build so far
help 2022-07-22 03:14:08 it's not a fighter jet
help 2022-07-22 15:22:17 What tank is it? Abrams?
help 2022-08-01 20:26:22 i spent a week building a MASSIVE build (6k blocks), and it is **not a lag machine**, but when i load it then try to launch it or whatever, my game crashes
help 2022-08-01 20:28:56 it may look somewhat lame on the outside but it has 3-4 floors, and a full interior
help 2022-08-01 20:30:34 a few lights (for alarms)
help 2022-08-01 20:30:37 no motorlock
help 2022-08-01 20:33:00 i removed some lights on 1st and 3rd floor

plane-crazy 2022-10-25 23:26:44 I managed to make my railgun tank immune to cutters, guns and (somewhat) rockets, but not fire
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 23:27:34 How can I add more protection against rockets and fire?
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 23:29:03 Explosive block and block beam 1x7 are both immune to explosions too
plane-crazy 2022-10-25 23:32:22 Spamming? I was showing the results of a test someone did
creations-chat 2022-12-01 15:28:59 Hey guys, what if someone made the tut/starter plane, and then motorlocked tons of weapons and TNT to make it look weak, but is actually OP
creations-chat 2022-12-01 15:47:29 *tutorial plane suddenly goes 500 and shoots rockets with TNT armor*

plane-crazy 2022-12-04 16:16:34 I had a SCP Facility that I was not done building, but every time I loaded/launched it, I crashed my game
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 16:17:38 But the SCP Facility was 5.5k, and it kept crashing me, yet yours is 9.3k
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 16:18:28 LOL
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 16:19:43 💀
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 16:20:27 How did you have time to place 9.3k blocks, wait for it to load, and wait for it to spawn?
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 16:21:15 Does it crash when you spawn it?
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 16:21:54 How?
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 16:22:20 I crash when I spawn 5k+ blocks
general 2022-12-07 21:13:38 Not really
general 2022-12-07 21:13:43 It will
general 2022-12-07 21:13:57 They will make cutters useless **if** either person is blacklisted
