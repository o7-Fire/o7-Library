plane-crazy 2022-05-13 14:56:33 pretty sure the centre of weight thing doesnt take helium blocks into account
plane-crazy 2022-05-13 14:56:36 well it does
plane-crazy 2022-05-13 14:56:46 it just assumes they weigh as much as a regular block

plane-crazy 2022-05-18 17:50:44 i've a question
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 17:51:07 is it possible to have friends board your ship without sliding all over the place?(without seats)?
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 17:52:52 ok so
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 17:53:06 yesterday my friends had the ability to board my ship on foot , with nothing special
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 17:53:25 but for some reason they can't now?all the changes i've done to it are just some extra water propellers
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 18:00:41 both of those would ruin the design a lot..
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 18:02:23 yes
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 18:02:39 i'm gonna get an alt to test it , but my friends say the slide forward when the ship is going forward
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 18:03:55 i want to see for myself what it looks like
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 18:05:37 how do i get image perms
