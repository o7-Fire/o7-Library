plane-crazy 2020-11-01 17:46:05 its actually rly impressive
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:40:46 I need help
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:41:15 i need to make my ship fly but i cant
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:41:26 yea spaceship
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:41:43 Its a star wars B wing
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:41:53 so the shape is odd
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:42:04 youd have to see it probs
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:42:14 nice!
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:42:20 you seen a B wing right?
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:42:26 they land sideways-ish
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:42:47 i built it already
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:42:50 just cant make it fly
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:42:51 cause im dumb
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:43:13 it even has the auto righting pilots cockpit like star wars
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:43:23 yep
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:43:41 
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:44:02 ye, but i cant make it fly 😦
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:44:45 I also need to design landing gears
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:44:52 I tried the rope-suspension but it was too glitchy
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:44:56 i trid pistons
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:44:59 but they bounced
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:45:13 I did
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:45:18 i think it was the weight of the ship
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:45:29 they kept basically spamhopping
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:46:05 if u were online we could join same server
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:46:09 and u could help me take a look
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:46:41 oof k
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:47:04 the B wing is odd because it lands sideways, making helium a hard choice
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:47:16 unless i Auto center the helium, and use ballast tanks
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:47:57 true, true
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:48:05 but then the lightest length area would float up
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:48:23 very complicated issue hahaha
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:48:36 i could use anchors to control landing, and helium to make it actually "sit" up
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:48:49 and throw some ballasts in for spins
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:49:12 you have no idea how badly i want this to work hahahah
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:49:30 well, the B wing is easier for spins because its unevenly weighted, so all id have to do is give the heavy side a hard nudge
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:50:00 lol, i only have maybe 12 wing pannels
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:50:11 and none on the MAIN wing
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:50:15 so i dont mess up steering
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:51:00 bro it took me 10 mins to figure out the cockpit rotation
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:51:05 which actually was the easiest part
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:51:06 lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:51:16 all i needed was a motor, a ballast, and 1 helium block
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:52:10 dang that thing is beautiful lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:52:12 my eyes cry
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:52:27 I love empirial shuttle
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:52:45 nice! i attempted that but it messed with weight so i decided not to
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:52:59 not rly Ultra
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:53:29 afk quick sec
plane-crazy 2020-11-01 20:55:02 I really need to make my B wing work, but i cant

Quit whining like a 4 year old and do what you can to FIX the problem the CORRECT way, not just ranting
creations-chat 2020-11-03 17:48:31 > warcrimes is not really a 4 year old
<@!685909594932773033> note the words __like a 4 year old__ implying that its a simile, not an exact example. Use that brain.
creations-chat 2020-11-03 17:51:31 <@!353348764280422402> i am not defending, i stated that you should deal with it the correct way
creations-chat 2020-11-03 17:52:33 so? doesnt mean you can just cry and rant instead of simply calling in a mod, sitting back, and watching results.
creations-chat 2020-11-03 17:53:42 <@456226577798135808> theres nothing more you can do, man
creations-chat 2020-11-03 17:54:43 didnt say he wasnt, didnt say he is, simply saying common courtesy and use of civilization can help more than rant.
creations-chat 2020-11-03 17:56:14 Thanks <@!378962393453166592> lol

<@!588055079899103299> That is a very pathetic thing to admit, cmon guys.
creations-chat 2020-11-03 17:57:49 <@!378962393453166592> he said expecting common courtesy and correct usage is too much to expect of yall, its a pathetic thing to say, especially since it really ISNT true. You have a choice.

creations-chat 2020-11-05 00:54:32 <@!746383586755870821> any suggs on how i can improve that? tips? the front was toughish for me to do detailed so i stuck simple and called it low poly
creations-chat 2020-11-05 00:56:34 ah to the front? I can try 🙂 anything else? (its just the roundish shape makes it semi tough) Make the top of the front rounded on top like the pic too? <@!746383586755870821>
creations-chat 2020-11-05 00:58:05 lol, i genuinely like improving my stuff 🤷‍♂️ I overreact sometimes i admit heh

creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:15:15 <@!565165316116578324> stop spamming your build, just edit the original message lol
creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:16:46 yes, 4 pics, 3 in a row, of the same thing. that is the very DEFINITION of spam.
"sending the same message indiscriminately to a large numbers of recipients on the Internet."
3 of the four pics WERE in a row, its not like we cant see the whole thing or are ignoring it, lol, its easier to edit the message then waste space
creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:19:12 my thoughts exactly crinj
creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:20:44 <@!720751430595772418> i see ya downvoted my build, any suggestions of what i can do to improve it? every lil bit helps
creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:22:31 > it looks bad lacks details and proportions are kinda weird
<@!719168864705052802> yea i agree about proportions, but i was mostly trying to do a variant of it, not exact replica since there are no real pictures to base it off but drawings 😦 any suggestions on how i can improve detail?
creations-chat 2020-11-05 01:25:05 heh the very person trying to push me off is now saving me unwittingly by trying to save themselves
