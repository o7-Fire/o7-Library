creations-chat 2022-04-30 16:13:11 thats what someone who built a tutorial would say ngl
creations-chat 2022-04-30 16:15:05 ðŸ§¢
creations-chat 2022-04-30 16:18:21 really aggressive for someone who is "innocent"
id either admit to it being a tutorial, or post a build mode screenshot if you are that confident it isnt
creations-chat 2022-04-30 16:23:42 it is - go to 17:09 in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSSoKwrIfWo
the camera placement and body shape is uncanny
his body is slightly longer than the tutorial, but that doesnt mean its an original build
creations-chat 2022-04-30 16:29:59 tis but roblox physics
not really much you can do
maybe try engines to reverse the roll?
creations-chat 2022-04-30 23:19:28 we all have in our early days

creations-chat 2022-05-03 15:00:34 Can I get some feedback on my ADFX-01?

I think it did fairly well in creations compared to a lot of other builds, but I would still like to improve and clearly just asking for feedback in the creations message isnt enough lma
creations-chat 2022-05-03 15:18:47 wow completely ignored <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2022-05-03 15:29:40 this image disagrees

creations-chat 2022-05-03 15:33:02 id argue that meme builds are also fairly well rated, this got me designer 4 -

creations-chat 2022-05-30 01:46:58 "1x1 delta wings"
is this 3d model wrong then or

- ok yes i looked at some other models and it does seem to be a bit off, nvm
creations-chat 2022-05-30 02:01:31 i guess, but its about the scale i normally build at
creations-chat 2022-05-30 02:08:30 not exactly feedback, but ok

cant post other peoples builds

ok but its literally against the rules
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 21:52:03 just gonna
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 21:52:38 not accurate blueprints
but
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 22:59:40 mhm...
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 23:02:46 because all the others line up as well?
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 23:02:59 that is exactly where the rotor would be
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 23:03:09 its just hidden behind the body
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 23:06:28 there literally isnt
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 23:07:40 4 goes roughly where the yellow line is
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 23:08:28 the angles between each of the rotors without 4 would mean that theres a massive gap between 3 and 5
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 23:08:41 which would mean that the heli would be unstable
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 23:12:50 thats because one of them is behind the body of the helicopter you moron
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 23:13:45 yes
it
is



you just can't see it because of the camera angle
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 23:14:20 yeah
five visable
one hidden by the camera angle
six total
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:19:41 consider the following:
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:20:06 
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:21:36 well yeah i exaggerated it so it was easier to see
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:21:44 also
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:22:25 
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:23:30 the 4th rotor is often hidden by the heli due to camera angle
but if you look at the angle between each of the rotors, all you need is common sense to be able to tell that there are clearly 6 rotors
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:26:34 one of those was literally a stationary one
and motion blur is really not a big issue
however
the variants thing
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:26:58 i mean
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:27:05 you can see where it gets the name from i spose
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:28:12 ok yeah its a variants thing
there seems to be more with 6 rotors
but the 5 rotor variant is more popular somehow
probably because its quirky or something idk
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:29:04 ~~easier to build in game as well~~
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:30:12 i prefer the 6 tbh
but on the subject of the front


what the fuck were they smoking when they came up with this
plane-crazy 2022-08-04 00:34:38 im probably gonna go too (bri'ish)
