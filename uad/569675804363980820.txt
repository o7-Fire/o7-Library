Great job tho!!

or in other words, very helpful.
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:15:06 how does this nose look? since it looked too pointy.
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:20:23 I don't want to join in this so called "argument" but I do this all the time with my friends who are much more talented than me. because most of the time my feedback gives it that 1%. that could be what's happening here, not to mention I also agree with all of the points said by the lovely person who gave me feedback.

can we please stop tho
creations-chat 2022-07-18 09:26:20 can we please end this argument, I had enough. My build can be worked on and judged at anyone's discretion or view / stand  on the build. end of story

creations-chat 2022-08-09 08:09:54 Well, I love the livery first of all, very good. But I think some things to improve / add is a cockpit and possibly cockpit interior (buttons if you can) and maybe make the wing slightly tilted for that extra 2%. 

Nice build tho! üëçüèª

creations-chat 2022-08-28 04:31:39 maybe like 3 blocks, but not 6 or 7, seems a bit too far forward.. (block to the left is 6 blocks forward, where you want the start of the wing box & wings to be.) 

(it's ok, we all have those moments)
creations-chat 2022-08-29 03:04:43 is my wingtip good? (**WING IS STILL INCOMPLETE, COLORS WILL BE ADDED SOON**)
