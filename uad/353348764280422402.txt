plane-crazy 2019-09-18 21:59:15 Also I made a mortar thing and put it on a boat, but the bombs no longer blow up on impact when they hit the water, I wonder why
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 21:59:42 ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 22:00:00 Well I guess it works ok because it explodes when it hits something so I guess its fine
creations-chat 2019-09-18 22:16:50 Mortar platform boat. Pretty ugly I'll admit. 506 blocks.

creations-chat 2019-09-18 22:19:48 And anything past 4 motors connected to each other just glitches out unless you put a rod on it
creations-chat 2019-09-18 22:23:08 Based off a war thunder plane that I can't remember the name of. Jet engine on the front is for cosmetics, uses motors to fly, also supposed to kinda be a trainer plane since it has 2 seats. But it needs a ramp to take off so oof. 218 blocks.

creations-chat 2020-02-05 00:00:53 also is it a motor plane?
creations-chat 2020-02-05 00:01:37 nice I like people who actually use motors to fly instead of using engines and a motor propeller as cosmetics
creations-chat 2020-02-05 00:01:55 glad someone is actually using motors to their full potential
creations-chat 2020-02-05 01:36:56 planes in plane crazy aren't like real life how they glide, almost all of them instantly stop as soon as engines stop.
creations-chat 2020-02-08 00:38:22 I saw the self upvote
creations-chat 2020-02-08 00:38:46 you mean I self upvote?

creations-chat 2020-02-08 00:41:06 probably because its not at my base so they assume I didn't make it probably
creations-chat 2020-02-08 04:59:28 being honest, its not the best, but its certainly not the worst
creations-chat 2020-02-08 04:59:36 What does it use to fly

help 2020-02-29 00:28:23 In plane crazy I made a missile truck and want to mount the missile launcher on a tank I have 2 tanks, which should I mount it on, the smaller one with less profile, more speed, less reliability, smaller wheels, turning is more drifty, and weaker suspension, or, the bigger one with higher profile, less speed, more stable turning, stronger suspension, can go in water, bigger wheels so they're more of a target, and isn't very good on rough terrain

creations-chat 2020-08-26 21:47:37 whirleybird
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:08:04 I'd recommend you make the front better
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:08:48 like
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:08:52 Its kinda weirdly shaped
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:08:58 Its not smooth like a real ships
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:09:07 Real ships don't have bumps all over the front
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:09:13 oh
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:09:18 why?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:09:38 ok
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:11:30 oh
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:12:51 I wish ships could sink by them self if they were damaged too badly
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:13:18 because it just looks weird for a ship that is split in half to still be floating
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:13:44 Like sure, the SS Pentleton existed, but it eventually sunk
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:14:09 Pendleton*
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:14:29 
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:16:39 ?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:17:21 and they spam 12 shredder bugs
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:18:52 1st phase: turret, rocket and gun spam
2nd phase: stick planes with spammed guns
3rd phase: shredder bugs
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:19:55 I didn't go into pvp for while when I was noob
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:21:12 My noob phases were more like
1st phase: stick planes
2nd phase: Planes that aren't stick planes but still suck
3rd phase: experimenting with making gun systems
4th phase: experimenting with using keyboard controls to use control panel more reliably
5th phase: experimenting with motor engines
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:22:29 I am great at making motor engines tbh
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:22:40 and I love motor engines
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:22:52 because I don't have to spam super rocket engines and it isn't earrape
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:23:01 And motor engines look good and can go fast
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:23:37 oh wait I skipped a phase
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:24:18 1st phase: stick planes
2nd phase: Planes that aren't stick planes but still suck
3rd phase: experimenting with making gun systems
4th phase: experimenting with using keyboard controls to use control panel more reliably
5th phase: experimenting with motor engines
6th phase: experimenting with motor engines on ships
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:24:50 my motor engine phase was also really fun
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:25:22 I'm actually pretty sad that I deleted my first prototypes of my motor planes :C
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:26:09 I do actually have a better version of the prototype that is bigger
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:26:24 but I don't use it since its a bomber
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:26:47 yeah
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:27:25 I wish you could whitelist people so they could control pilot seats and you could select what that pilot seat controls
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:27:57 So you wouldn't just have a massive battleship crewed by one single person
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:28:21 Then you could select if they could build on your plot or not
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:29:45 Honestly some people say my stuff is crap and looks horrible
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:29:56 But I like to focus on function more than looks
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:30:30 In my opinion, one problem with people in plane crazy are that they focus more on looks
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:31:09 that isn't a real motor engine.. *gasp*
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:32:38 ?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:32:56 <@456226577798135808> wdym by that
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:33:36 wdym...
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:33:43 Do you mean motors or engines
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:34:08 *motor* propeller engine or the default propeller engine that you can place down without work
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:34:56 I don't use propeller engines
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:35:04 I use MOTOR engines
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:35:19 that isn't a motor engine though
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:35:27 I see the fake props
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:35:33 So it can't move forward
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:35:39 As those are blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:35:43 Not the propeller blades
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:36:05 ?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:36:30 Wanna know why the propeller blades made the plane slower?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:36:42 You built it wrong.
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:36:47 How many motors did you put
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:38:27 I'm bad at design but great at function
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:38:48 ?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:39:02 you are talking about propeller engines I believe
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:40:15 Also an ideal plane with a motor engine has 2 engines so it won't be in a barrel roll forever
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:40:34 I have made motor planes with 1 engine before
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:40:55 They are pretty slow though since you can't put enough motors into them and they require alot of ballast to ballance
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:41:20 But if you have a 2 engine motor plane then you don't have to balance it as long as you know how to do it
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:41:57 Also I've found that if the motor engine is too fast then it will glitch out and you will need to put rods infront to stabilize
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:42:13 Ok
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:44:06 If you ever use motor engines, don't make your plane single engine
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:44:33 I dislike it when people use the prop blades for cosmetics tbh
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:44:49 btw this isn't related to the argument
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:45:21 Does it work?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:45:30 nice
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:46:02 oh yeah that reminds me
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:46:13 On my first prototype motor engine plane
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:46:19 It had a EMP device
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:46:49 When it when close to something that had a magnet, it just did weird stuff to them
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:47:23 well
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:47:31 I mean that it was LIKE an EMP
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:47:59 notice I said like
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:48:09 yep
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:48:30 this was in 2017 btw
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:48:45 I only tested it on a helicopter that had a magnet though
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:49:13 both our magnets were on, and it basically just made it do really weird stuff and spaz out
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:49:27 so yeah
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:49:40 we had magnets only on aswell
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:49:52 I know
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:50:23 ?
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:50:42 > Also magnets are really laggy
saying it like this made it sound like it was directed at me
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:51:14 I think magnets and ropes don't go well together
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:52:18 Its ugly, big, probably doesn't work well, and I see you use the propeller blades as cosmetics and that makes me mad
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:53:46 Also
creations-chat 2020-08-27 18:53:48 Another thing

creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:08:47 They are like paper thin
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:09:06 But I take pride in not spamming rocket engines atleast
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:09:32 800 speed
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:09:44 I let my brother copy and he made a version that could go 1200
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:09:52 But by the the time it reached 1200 it broke
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:10:47 The plane I made is stable and manverable
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:10:59 and durable
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:11:03 it can fly without the tail
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:11:21 And it can also fly with very little wing section left
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:11:37 also I deleted it so no one would copy
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:12:13 (I deleted the pic not the actual plane)
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:12:37 yeah better safe than sorry tbh

creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:38:13 (joke)
bot-central 2020-08-27 19:47:48 !suggest Decal blocks
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:52:28 Tbh I dislike the map
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:52:43 I know it would be hard to make a new map, but the current map looks awful
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:52:55 Its pretty bland too
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:53:03 Not enough water either
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:53:34 A river leading into a lake would be cool
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:53:56 He said it was his first
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:54:18 also imagine if there were trees on the map
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:54:25 Or weather
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:55:26 The map honestly needs to be bigger, better looking, less bland, and more variation
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:55:39 In roblox studio theres actually a tool that generates a map for you
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:56:24 If there was something like a river that divided the map, people would have to make vehicles that could cross it, but probably a bridge would be better
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:56:39 Also if there was a bigger ocean
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:56:45 Then it would be more fun
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:57:23 When you got a big ship that is literally the size of the ocean, its really annoying not being able to go anywhere because that
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:59:16 I feel like ships, and cars were kinda overlooked
creations-chat 2020-08-27 19:59:27 waves would be nice
creations-chat 2020-08-27 20:00:01 yep
creations-chat 2020-08-27 20:00:14 I kinda made NVG
creations-chat 2020-08-27 20:00:43 its not good though
creations-chat 2020-08-27 20:04:06 I'ma make a map to show what I think would be an ideal map
creations-chat 2020-08-27 20:05:22 Obviously my map isn't gonna be added, but after all its only to show my thoughts
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:01:55 also
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:02:00 If motor 2s are spazing out
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:02:07 theres an easy fix
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:02:14 But yeah
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:02:16 Also
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:02:21 If you could attach things to wheels
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:02:26 why not use motor 1s
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:02:36 Since you'd have to press buttons to turn the wheel
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:03:00 for me the fix for my turrets was that I just reduced the max angle
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:03:11 besides the bottom motor anyways
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:03:21 also if its too heavy it does that
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:03:40 magnets
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:03:46 not sure if magnets still work anymore
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:04:09 they used to
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:06:31 great
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:08:19 Btw
creations-chat 2020-08-27 21:08:25 cave systems would be epic
creations-chat 2020-08-28 01:01:46 any ideas how to improve my tankette?

plane-crazy 2020-09-01 20:39:06 Wanna know an actual chad?
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 20:39:12 There was a ship that sailed for 15 miles
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 20:39:14 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 20:39:16 SS Pendleton
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 20:39:19 it got split in half
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 20:39:24 And still sailed for a while
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 20:39:45 Well
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 20:39:51 It actually sailed for a while
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 20:40:00 THEN it got beached and sunk
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 20:40:16 
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 20:40:30 Thats the wreck I think
plane-crazy 2020-09-01 21:04:26 when cannon being added
general 2020-09-01 21:05:39 
general 2020-09-01 21:05:43 When it being added
creations-chat 2020-09-01 21:08:10 decent I guess
creations-chat 2020-09-01 21:08:20 If you plan to add onto it, its decent
creations-chat 2020-09-01 21:08:58 A cabin for the ship
creations-chat 2020-09-01 21:09:12 Lifeboats
creations-chat 2020-09-01 21:09:25 Smokestack
creations-chat 2020-09-01 21:09:50 Deployable cutter if you have enough room
creations-chat 2020-09-01 21:09:56 I dislike having the cabin at the back
creations-chat 2020-09-01 21:10:32 I put my towards the front
creations-chat 2020-09-01 21:10:58 I'ma make an ironclad
creations-chat 2020-09-01 21:14:11 You would have to make a super lag machine
creations-chat 2020-09-01 21:14:21 then save it in all of your saveslots
creations-chat 2020-09-01 23:08:09 Might be a butthurt person who you downvoted
bug-reports 2020-09-02 16:15:02 You can make the numbers bigger, but the color is capped at 255.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:15:33 Ye
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:17:38 Too top heavy
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:17:57 Too thin
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:18:08 no
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:18:14 The ship is too topheavy
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:18:29 And the body of the ship is too thin
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:18:51 no...
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:18:55 Not the turrets...
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:19:01 The body of the ship
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:19:20 Also you see how the cabin is high up
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:19:36 The cabin is adding weight to the top of the ship
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:19:44 And gravity wants the weight to be on the bottom
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:19:59 So it tips like that
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:20:07 Clearly not.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:20:22 I can make a 2k block ship in around 30 minutes to an hour
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:20:46 I don't know how someone would spend 2 days making a ship though
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:21:15 Learn from experience to help make your ship
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:21:49 Yeah.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:22:09 Yeah I feel learning from experience would be better
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:22:13 because you don't understand
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:22:38 That the BODY of the ship is too thin
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:23:37 Basically, just experiment and learn from experience.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:23:59 Wait
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:24:04 How does the ship turn?
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:24:09 What is it's turning system
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:24:13 That might be a problem
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:24:34 -_-
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:24:37 Really...
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:25:09 Tbh, I hate using sideways engines to turn
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:25:42 Eh. I just don't like making my ship earrape
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:27:01 Ok, basically just don't expect to instantly know everything, learning from experience takes time.
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:28:50 I haven't seen many people make ironclads
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:29:35 I don't really like to make ships based off real life ships
creations-chat 2020-09-02 16:31:11 Tip. Don't make your ship's armor 1 block thin. ACTUALLY GIVE IT ARMOR. If you use it in PVP anyways.

creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:00:01 My plane can fly upsidedown too
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:00:05 It uses control panels
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:00:30 Literally all planes can fly upsidedown
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:00:48 Not clicking that
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:08:58 Those are all massive, probably slow, weird looking, easy target, and hidious
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:10:21 Still are hidious, big, easy target, and probably slow
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:11:05 Mine goes 700 and is very maneuverable and durable
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:12:16 yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:12:41 also, why have big bombs when you can have MANY tiny bombs
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:12:49 Its the HE111z
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:13:25 For short its HE111z
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:14:25 I just paint mine white and say its winter camo
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:14:33 I think white looks good on my planes
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:14:52 Then I like to make the very tip of the nose black
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:18:02 I like making interceptors
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:18:10 Mine doesn't
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:18:17 The missiles always hit my plane
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:20:25 Nice!
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:20:31 A motorpowered plane in creations for once
creations-chat 2020-09-18 17:20:46 yeah I just never see any
help 2020-09-18 19:19:49 gee I wonder why -_-
help 2020-09-18 21:04:57 I may not be a *rocket scientist*, ||pun intended|| but that don't look right to me chief
bug-reports 2020-09-19 19:25:05 I don't see them exploding though
bug-reports 2020-09-19 19:25:23 oki
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:35:12 I like the plane, its just something about it doesn't seem right to me
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:35:23 I think its the color
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:35:32 And the fact its oversized
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:36:03 wut
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:36:20 That plane right there doesn't seem oversized
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:36:28 That isn't a very good size comparison
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:37:35 From what I see it is 3-4 blocks tall, and 3 blocks wide on the fuselage (the jet)
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:37:55 3-6 wide*
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:38:20 Tbh, big things don't mean better imo
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:39:54 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:41:41 3 things I hate:
Rocket spam
Oversized things that don't need to be oversized (including the MASSIVE cars people make)
"My build is so good why did you downvote" (when the build is genuinely bad)
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:42:41 2.5 to 3 blocks tall I see
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:42:52 Its decent looking
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:43:09 cockpit is kinda spikey
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:43:27 whats the speed of it?
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:43:41 Decent PVP speed I guess
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:44:22 Helium is for nubs
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:45:21 then don't upvote OR downvote it
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:45:46 what about the bren gun
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:46:48 I dislike the use of tutorials, but I'm fine with using it just to learn how to make CERTAIN stuff you may know how to, for example, tank tracks, hover engine, conveyor engines, etc
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:47:00 Just not whole planes, only little components
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:47:28 yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:47:37 tbh whats the point of making a tutorial plane
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:47:44 Most of them aren't good in PVP or anything
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:47:59 And you don't get to brag when you make a tutorial plane
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:48:03 Since people call you out on it
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:48:44 Tbh I've only watched a tutorial once or twice, for how to make tank tracks and conveyor engines lol
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:50:45 Tbh I dislike trollgenious
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:51:01 trollgenius*
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:51:14 oofergaming
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:51:15 No
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:51:28 That would not work as a bomber OR an interceptor
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:51:41 Interceptors have to be fast, to intercept the enemy
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:51:48 Bombers have to carry many bombs
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:52:51 Yeah probably still wouldn't work as an interceptor
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:53:00 Oofer you might wanna step up your game a bit.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:55:47 Oofer show me pls
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:56:52 how fast btw?
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:57:15 IRL they were red
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:57:22 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:57:25 That looks amazing
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:57:52 oofer 360 is not fast enough to be an interceptor...
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:58:11 stickplanes can sorta go faster than 360
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:59:09 iaboyk you are going to get alot of upvotes
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:59:42 yeah but probably there is going to be one toxic kid who can't make something that good, so they downvote it.
creations-chat 2020-09-21 15:59:59 how maneuvrable
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:00:04 Durability?
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:00:08 Combat testing

creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:20:23 sad how everyone blocked out iaboyk's plane
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:26:47 yes sorta
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:30:12 Oofer
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:30:31 Oofer use the little tiny wedges for the gaps
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:30:38 forgot what they were called
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:30:49 I think they are in wedges, wedge2, or half blocks
creations-chat 2020-09-21 16:49:41 noice

creations-chat 2020-09-22 17:32:53 And he got salty
creations-chat 2020-09-22 17:33:04 And he was like "but your plane doesn't have advanced turning"
creations-chat 2020-09-22 17:33:12 yeah apparently
creations-chat 2020-09-22 17:33:15 Advanced turning
creations-chat 2020-09-22 17:33:16 was just
creations-chat 2020-09-22 17:33:20 regular turning
creations-chat 2020-09-22 17:33:24 but only with the tail
creations-chat 2020-09-22 17:33:29 and not the wings
creations-chat 2020-09-23 17:05:05 theres a fix for broken copy and paste

creations-chat 2020-09-23 17:05:20 and put in cmd /c"echo off|clip”

creations-chat 2020-09-24 19:34:26 that B17 triggers me

bot-central 2020-09-25 02:13:48 -mapsuggest Don't skimp out on the amount of water! Add LOTS of water so the game will feel realistic for big ships, and overall would look MUCH MUCH better. Plus the current amount of water is too small
creations-chat 2020-09-25 02:15:35 Always has been

plane-crazy 2020-10-01 18:47:06 I have a plane that kinda looks like it
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 18:47:15 But the cockpit doesn't look like it
creations-chat 2020-10-02 16:40:58 I have a big boat that takes up most of my plot

Its only 1.7k or 2.7k blocks can't remember
creations-chat 2020-10-02 16:41:14 Yet that sailboat somehow takes up 2k blocks
creations-chat 2020-10-02 16:41:31 Its visibly not 2k blocks.
creations-chat 2020-10-02 16:44:19 They are connected by a bridge
creations-chat 2020-10-02 16:44:37 the 2 boats are connected
creations-chat 2020-10-02 16:45:06 Yeah but its probably not 2k blocks
creations-chat 2020-10-02 16:46:23 Guessing you used all 1x1 blocks, and spammed blocks inside
creations-chat 2020-10-02 16:47:41 does it capsize easily, turn well, and have a decent speed?

creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:15:37 well I did
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:16:32 I just wanna mount it on my heavy fighter motor plane so it could be a tank buster like the HS 129 with the 75mm gun
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:16:50 Dis bad boi
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:17:13 Apparently it could barely fly due to bad engines and the sheer weight of the gun
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:17:53 Suggestion 7409 is good, except I think reloads shouldn't be quick, maybe 3-5 seconds
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:18:09 Uhhh no ion you weren't.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:18:44 
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:19:45 I like dis suggestion
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:20:21 I know
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:21:22 TLDR: 20mm, 30mm, 45mm, 75mm, 76mm, 88mm, 152mm guns with reload, but weight increases with each caliber so can't be on planes
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:21:45 Fireworks aren't that good
creations-chat 2020-10-05 17:33:05 Ok I saw another view I'm upvoting since it looks better at the diff angle

plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:37:59 because I don't have expert role
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:38:28 Looks more like the IL-2
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:39:16 I think its actually this
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:39:36 the MK1 Defiant
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:41:01 MK1 Defiant was a nightfighter

plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:51:01 I guess?
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:51:49 Also I'm too smallbrain to get an expert rank
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:52:37 Eh I was working on a ship
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:52:41 So I could finish it
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:52:49 but I'm lazy lol
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:52:53 3 fold ship btw
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:53:14 expert rank is 4000 block I think
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:54:13 The expert terrain specialist rank kinda seems dumb imo
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:54:18 3k blocks on a car
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:54:57 Giant cars look kinda weird
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:55:52 
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:56:00 land vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:56:39 Ok

creations-chat 2020-10-05 18:43:42 Dude I see no creation
creations-chat 2020-10-05 18:44:00 no its a joke
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:18:58 Well
I don't like it, and it seems useless.
Also, put some stuff it can play with
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:19:30 Maybe give it some Jenga or something
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:19:50 > Well
> I don't like it, and it seems useless.
> Also, put some stuff it can play with

> Maybe give it some Jenga or something

These are mine btw (jenga the game)
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:21:03 Generally, just give it stuff to grab and play with, for example, a baton to wack people, a gun (maybe not), etc
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:23:11 Oh wait... I got an idea! Give it a dumbell to work out to show how swoll it is!
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:23:38 oh
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:24:15 give it a table
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:24:31 ez fix

Or just give it a proper arm
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:25:03 I think I'ma try to make a robotic arm too
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:28:24 List of things you can make for it:
Jenga
Gun
Baton
Dumbell
Musket
Cannon
Knife
Chessboard
Food
Etc
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:28:53 Muzzle loaded gun
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:29:57 Ye.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:30:13 I know how to make the gun work though
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:30:35 Gonna make a robotic arm and gun later
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:31:00 Yeah.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:32:06 What gun should I make? Double action, single action, or musket
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:33:15 easy, just make the hand pick up the chess pieces
Well easier said than done I guess
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:37:31 Basically for the gun I'ma make a simpler version of this, with a magnet on the end of the hammer or whatever its called. When the trigger is not pressed down, the magnet is out of range, allowing the bullet to slide up, or be reloaded. But, when the trigger is pulled down, the magnet is pushed closer to the bullet.
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:38:01 I have a bad grade in honor science class 😦
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:39:15 Gun trigger systems are actually quite simple
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:42:50 play the rocky theme
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:46:29 So uh, what type of bullet should the gun fire? Ball, cartridge, or cylinder
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:47:50 Most likely a single action
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:48:12 Single action or double action, probably double action
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:48:29 (Not meant for PVP)
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:48:51 I already got more conventional artillery that fire explosives in PVP
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:49:11 and also cylinders aren't exactly the most accurate the longer they are
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:50:08 So ball, cartridge, ~~cylinder~~

Trails don't change the accuracy I think
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:50:33 Uh its meant to fire, not look good and not fire
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:50:51 It will look worse if its very inaccurate and can't fire
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:52:14 Damn I gotta go to preschool
creations-chat 2020-10-05 19:52:59 OMG THIS SUBJECT IS SO HARD

creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:14:20 Pretty sure theres also a car bigger than that
It was like a really big, really long limo.
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 17:15:54 To the guy who posted suggestion number 7557, its ricochet, not Rich Ache.
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:16:54 > but that limo used motors to make it long and it is low effort bc i had to maximize space of the build
He had to make room for the folds, while you just made a massive brick.
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:19:19 But its completely and utterly pointless if its ugly and useless
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:20:41 > it is build to height limit and it isnt a brick its shaped like an cardboard box
But its not cardboard
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:25:41 XD
HE JUST POSTED THE "BIGGEST AIR BALLOON IN PLANE CRAZY"
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 17:27:46 > Does anyone still remember the first plane they build
Yeah it was the starter plane
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:30:54 Uhhh, its not a hot air balloon, since it can't be steered.
Anything can fly if it has helium.
Yeah probably VVV
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:32:53 Ok
Didn't ask about your opinion
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:42:09 20 studs is 1 meter, and one block is 2.5 studs.
Oh.
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:46:09 I wish it was easier to make things in plane crazy properly sized.
My vehicle's tires are 6 feet tall ;-;
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:49:09 I wish blocks in plane crazy were smaller so I could just make something properly sized
creations-chat 2020-10-19 17:50:57 I have some 1:1 scale stuff
But I just wish I could make a car without the tires being 6 feet tall
I don't have 1:1 scale cars though, only 1.

plane-crazy 2020-10-26 16:56:35 for some reason
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 16:56:37 I took this
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 16:56:39 
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 16:56:49 and slapped this on it
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 16:56:50 
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 16:57:03 I don't know why I have done this
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 16:57:13 ok one sec
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 16:57:59 
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 16:58:05 I also just stretched it out a ton
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:01:02 <@!725583147928125461>
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:02:19 yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:02:27 lemme see the top though
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:02:35 I wanna see how much it curves
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:02:51 Hm
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:02:55 Not enough curve
creations-chat 2020-10-26 17:04:18 oh god
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:04:46 how do you make springs have more range though
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:04:52 its max range is like 4-5 plots
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:05:50 Its a mortar
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:06:14 short gun like sturmtiger
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:06:48 the gun on the sturmtiger is 380mm, and the mortar mounted on my M20 is basically the same
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:06:52 so that means it 380mm
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:07:02 quite
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:08:13 I think I am using 2 or 3 springs on my mortar
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:08:49 2 springs
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:08:55 wonder how to increase range
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:09:01 since more springs do nothing really
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:11:02 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/767717804547637248/Screen_Shot_2020-10-19_at_6.55.57_PM.png
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:11:07 thats the pic
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:17:47 I use WASD
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:18:18 Since I can look around easier with WASD and I don't wanna fix the control panels
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:19:07 for me its WASD for control panels, uparrow, m, and y for throttle (since I use motors to fly), b for main bomb 1234 for other bombs.
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:19:45 I want cannons tbh
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:20:13 The problem with my plane is that it goes so fast, it can't hit anything, since the guns are WAY too accurate ingame
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:21:34 Guns are too accurate, so they are completely useless to me when fighting other planes
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:23:13 They need to make it so they have atleast a LITTLE spread, since it would be more realistic and its just weird that there is complete 100% accuracy
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:24:20 I wish they made it so you could assign people to be able to control pilot seats and what controls the pilot seat can control
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:26:20 Lmao
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:26:40 Also why do the pilot seats even exist when only you can use it
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:30:59 my plane is stable until 1000-1200 speed
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:33:16 I don't even use jets
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:51:56 does anyone else always have players that just pull up in a jet or car
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:52:02 And just park infront of your base?
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:52:19 idk why
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:52:27 It just seems like they are trying to flex
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:54:08 I just grab out my robotic arm
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:54:11 And pick them up
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 17:54:13 and yeet them

creations-chat 2020-11-03 17:44:47 I don't even know tf is happening at this point
creations-chat 2020-11-03 17:47:12 RoyalRegime simply doesn't understand that yordan is stealing pics of creations or going to other people's creations and saying its his. <@!311638025308209154>, (thats basically what is happening)
creations-chat 2020-11-03 17:50:25 <@!683825202609651832> Dude, why are you defending a guy who is legit stealing creations?
creations-chat 2020-11-03 17:51:49 But thats not us ingame though
You can't blacklist a person for another person
Infact, that person who owns the tank might not even be in the discord
creations-chat 2020-11-03 17:52:50 We already called a mod -_-
creations-chat 2020-11-03 17:56:49 I mean royal only joined the disc 4 days ago, so he probably doesn't understand that there is constant arguing in here
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 19:49:41 <@!753361652019232778> that isn't really possible to make water not come into sealed builds, because thats roblox terrain, you can't script roblox terrain. Custom water would be hard and complex too.
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 19:51:53 <@!753361652019232778> exactly... I said it would be complex
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 19:52:44 Tbh I think the water is fine as it currently is
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 19:53:18 I'd rather have an update adding cannons or something else rather than overly complex water
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 19:55:40 Honestly motorlock breaking isn't the end of the world tbh
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 19:57:47 Tbh I never really used motorlock that much
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 19:58:54 Also, suspension could work as a substitute for motorlock, but only on certain things (not all, VERY simple things basically)
bug-reports 2020-11-03 20:00:54 tbh I don't really use motorlock, since I can just make my designs not use motorlocking
bug-reports 2020-11-03 20:01:19 no
bug-reports 2020-11-03 20:01:21 not for me
bug-reports 2020-11-03 20:01:29 lemme test if my ship still folds
bug-reports 2020-11-03 20:02:18 my ship still folds
help 2020-11-04 18:17:04 <@!559462059251859456> There is recoil in explosive blocks, its blast pressure. In roblox develop, the higher the blast pressure is, the more recoil there is. But in plane crazy since you can't put blast pressure that high, you can't get much recoil, so basically suggest more blast pressure.
help 2020-11-04 18:18:40 <@!513499940924817408> Maybe a conveyor engine, motor engine, or hover engine
help 2020-11-04 18:20:04 eh, motor engines are bulky anyways
help 2020-11-04 18:25:42 <@!513499940924817408> this is basically a motor engine
help 2020-11-04 18:27:53 
help 2020-11-04 18:28:11 basically you can only use motor engines if you plan on having two engines
help 2020-11-04 18:28:31 the motors have to spin the opposite way of the other
help 2020-11-04 18:29:01 and the blades have to be opposite of the other engine
help 2020-11-04 23:45:24 <@!565300409170919454> that suggestion makes me die inside
help 2020-11-04 23:45:45 who tf says cm instead of mm for gun calibers
help 2020-11-04 23:48:22 Juan seriously thinks that the guns in plane crazy fire this
help 2020-11-04 23:49:35 I'm doing some math rn
help 2020-11-04 23:49:58 he thinks roblox players are 18 feet tall
help 2020-11-04 23:50:12 Since a gun block is apparently 3 feet
help 2020-11-04 23:51:00 I think the guns are fine as is
help 2020-11-04 23:51:19 if I were to want anything for the guns it would be a little bit of spread probably
help 2020-11-04 23:51:48 he says he wants the guns sized down to 3 inches (I think)
help 2020-11-04 23:52:14 wut
help 2020-11-04 23:52:38 I mean that
help 2020-11-04 23:52:40 like
help 2020-11-04 23:52:44 I didn't ask for more guns
help 2020-11-04 23:52:46 but ok
help 2020-11-04 23:53:10 apparently the biggest machine gun in the world is 7 cm
help 2020-11-04 23:53:12 this man
help 2020-11-04 23:53:16 is making me die inside
help 2020-11-04 23:53:18 so much
help 2020-11-04 23:54:35 Juan is very poorly informed of guns
help 2020-11-04 23:55:16 the fact that he says CM instead of MM makes me die inside so hard
help 2020-11-04 23:56:20 the guns are probably 9mm, or .45 ACP considering how small they are
help 2020-11-04 23:56:24 yeah
help 2020-11-04 23:56:28 wait
help 2020-11-04 23:56:29 idk
help 2020-11-04 23:56:36 but 30 cm is as long as a ruler
help 2020-11-04 23:56:46 there is no way in hell the guns could fit that
help 2020-11-04 23:56:57 and this man's logic doesn't line up
help 2020-11-04 23:57:07 the biggest machine gun in the world is 7cm?
help 2020-11-04 23:57:59 I'm pretty sure hes using meters and cm instead of mm and studs because he doesn't know that studs exist, barely knows about guns, and just wants to sound smart.
help 2020-11-04 23:58:28 hold up
help 2020-11-04 23:58:36 if the biggest machine gun in the world is 7cm
help 2020-11-04 23:58:37 how
help 2020-11-04 23:58:49 HOW
help 2020-11-04 23:58:58 this guy's logic confuses me a ton
help 2020-11-04 23:59:34 I'm starting to think he doesn't know basic measurement
help 2020-11-04 23:59:55 Apparently the black part is 10cm, but the yellow part is 30 cm
help 2020-11-04 23:59:58 how tf is this logical
help 2020-11-05 00:00:32 also how are the guns oversized
help 2020-11-05 00:02:26 this is a size comparison, the first block is the size of a gun, and the second is what he wants it sized down to
help 2020-11-05 00:02:53 Juan confuses me
creations-chat 2020-11-05 17:46:37 what was it
help 2020-11-05 17:48:19 wait who was using exploits lol
help 2020-11-05 17:48:59 oh
help 2020-11-05 17:49:02 oh that guy
help 2020-11-05 17:49:09 he was also an unde I think
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:04:07 tf that huey in creations
it has rocket engines on it and the tail rotor is just a rocket engine
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:07:39 The huey doe
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:09:10 why do all the builds that show a heck ton of motorlocks just randomly get upvotes?
creations-chat 2020-11-05 18:10:50 My god this birder juan guy
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:11:34 why does this guy keep suggesting stuff
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:11:57 I don't think there are torpedos the size of rulers
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:13:13 I wish there was a suggestion blacklist for this dude
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:13:26 yes, we all do
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:13:30 but they are easy to make
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:13:38 and torpedos aren't the size of rulers
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:13:53 torpedoes are big irl
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:14:33 
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:14:57 Also look at juans older suggestions and you'll see why I hate him
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:16:36 Mind you, juan is the same guy who wants guns sized down to 0.3 cm (around 0.05 studs) and thinks it fires 30mm rounds
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:17:05 and barely knows measurement
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:17:12 ye
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:17:25 I want a little spread
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:17:41 but everyone downvotes suggestions asking for spread since they think it will make the bullets go sideways
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:19:29 I want more spread for guns, cannons being added, gunshot noises, etc
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:19:34 ye
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:19:49 would also like timed bombs
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:19:59 andddd juan is back at it again
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:20:21 juan wants a repair tool
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:20:27 why can't he just despawn
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:20:59 and why does he have to capitalize everything
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:21:04 and use words to sound smart
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:22:10 honestly limited ammo would be OK, but only if there was an option for infinite ammo to prevent noobs from spam
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:22:42 basically everything I want for guns is a little recoil, a little spread, and gunshot noises
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:23:09 and I want cannons 😦
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:24:28 yes
general 2020-11-05 18:25:51 Juan why cant you just say studs like a normal person because thats the roblox unit of measurement
general 2020-11-05 18:26:00 And calibers are measured in mm
general 2020-11-05 18:26:47 Also juan, there are 15cm long 20mm rounds
general 2020-11-05 18:27:22 Also <@!565300409170919454>, ever heard about the 47mm autocannon?
general 2020-11-05 18:27:36 uh yeah
general 2020-11-05 18:27:37 the guns
general 2020-11-05 18:27:39 are good as is
general 2020-11-05 18:27:52 guns aren't the problem
general 2020-11-05 18:28:18 You seriously want guns that are 0.05 studs juan?
general 2020-11-05 18:28:59 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/478584971670454284/773698704678846504/unknown.png the small one is 0.05 studs
general 2020-11-05 18:29:39 yes i know
general 2020-11-05 18:29:44 they are 2.5
general 2020-11-05 18:29:46 I know
general 2020-11-05 18:30:02 that 1 stud block is actually 1.15 studs, the size of a machinegun ingame
general 2020-11-05 18:30:17 yes juan I know
general 2020-11-05 18:30:38 The guns are ok juan
general 2020-11-05 18:30:52 there isn't artillery ingame though
general 2020-11-05 18:31:07 And if the rockets were realistic I think they would be bigger
general 2020-11-05 18:31:23 also this is a torpedo
general 2020-11-05 18:31:32 artillery is easy to make
general 2020-11-05 18:31:53 actually no
general 2020-11-05 18:31:56 that torpedo
general 2020-11-05 18:31:58 is 7 meters
general 2020-11-05 18:32:09 you can if you motorlock
general 2020-11-05 18:32:16 21 inch
general 2020-11-05 18:32:28 but 7 meters long
general 2020-11-05 18:33:20 that explains why you said that the gun is 300mm
general 2020-11-05 18:33:27 30cm = 300mm
general 2020-11-05 18:34:26 also
general 2020-11-05 18:34:39 you see the missile on the mig?
general 2020-11-05 18:34:45 its 4 meters long
general 2020-11-05 18:35:09 So the missile, if juan wants it realistic, then it should be longer
general 2020-11-05 18:35:20 and I just had a stroke
general 2020-11-05 18:35:33 V2 rocket
general 2020-11-05 18:35:37 Thats a bazooka
general 2020-11-05 18:35:45 V2 rockets were MASSIVE
general 2020-11-05 18:35:50 um
general 2020-11-05 18:35:53 why are you talking about
general 2020-11-05 18:35:55 the M1 Bazooka
general 2020-11-05 18:36:14 the gun is actually undersized btw
general 2020-11-05 18:36:30 its smaller than a pistol I believe
general 2020-11-05 18:36:35 no
general 2020-11-05 18:36:35 um
general 2020-11-05 18:36:39 100mm is like
general 2020-11-05 18:36:43 tank
general 2020-11-05 18:36:46 modern day tank
general 2020-11-05 18:36:57 10 cm is 100mm
general 2020-11-05 18:37:15 dude
general 2020-11-05 18:37:21 the gun is a machinegun
general 2020-11-05 18:37:25 the chamber moves back
general 2020-11-05 18:37:34 meaning it is around .45 or 9mm
general 2020-11-05 18:38:19 ah yes, the machine gun fires this tank shell
general 2020-11-05 18:38:32 The gun does not fire a 100mm round
general 2020-11-05 18:38:54 Juan, the machinegun ingame is not 100mm
general 2020-11-05 18:39:12 JUAN
general 2020-11-05 18:39:21 the gun is not 1 feet
general 2020-11-05 18:39:37 You said it was 1/3 the size of a normal block
general 2020-11-05 18:39:49 yes
general 2020-11-05 18:41:21 here, your diagram of the gun ingame juan
general 2020-11-05 18:41:28 Juan
general 2020-11-05 18:41:33 70mm
general 2020-11-05 18:41:35 is a tank round
general 2020-11-05 18:41:55 You've legit said that you barely did research
general 2020-11-05 18:41:58 nah
general 2020-11-05 18:42:05 HS129 was 75mm
general 2020-11-05 18:42:07 76mm*
general 2020-11-05 18:42:15 but it was an autoloader or singleshot I think
general 2020-11-05 18:42:46 Juan, this 100mm tank shell does not fit into the 10cm gun
general 2020-11-05 18:43:06 I've even made a diagram
general 2020-11-05 18:43:24 yes, my 357mm handgun
general 2020-11-05 18:43:42 
general 2020-11-05 18:44:04 thats an autocannon
general 2020-11-05 18:44:11 nah
general 2020-11-05 18:44:14 its a autocannon
general 2020-11-05 18:44:16 in your words
general 2020-11-05 18:44:28 autocannons are not the same as machineguns
general 2020-11-05 18:44:38 in your exact words
general 2020-11-05 18:45:06 this is 100mm gun
general 2020-11-05 18:45:28 yeah but there is no 100mm machine gun
general 2020-11-05 18:45:42 then why do you say the caliber is 100mm
general 2020-11-05 18:45:46 10mm
general 2020-11-05 18:45:48 eh
general 2020-11-05 18:45:52 10mm is a pistol caliber
general 2020-11-05 18:46:15 
general 2020-11-05 18:46:29 <@!565300409170919454>
general 2020-11-05 18:46:40 > yes yet fucking plane crazy gun is 100mm
<@!565300409170919454>
general 2020-11-05 18:47:24 <@!565300409170919454> this is a 10mm glock
general 2020-11-05 18:47:35 so the guns ingame are undersized
general 2020-11-05 18:47:44 since a glock is around the same size
general 2020-11-05 18:48:32 <@!565300409170919454> like my 100mm handgun
general 2020-11-05 18:49:01 10mm is a revolver/pistol round I think
general 2020-11-05 18:49:27 Juan is literally trying to prove something he barely knows about
general 2020-11-05 18:49:41 he is saying the guns ingame are oversized
general 2020-11-05 18:49:48 and wants them size down to kolbri size
general 2020-11-05 18:52:41 juan lemme see
general 2020-11-05 18:53:23 juan why are you using milimeters
general 2020-11-05 18:53:39 but juan
general 2020-11-05 18:53:43 guns aren't square
general 2020-11-05 18:53:45 well ys
general 2020-11-05 18:53:49 I said that wrong
general 2020-11-05 18:53:54 bullets aren't square
general 2020-11-05 18:54:06 see how the bullet is long?
general 2020-11-05 18:54:18 bullets aren't square
general 2020-11-05 18:54:27 but juan
general 2020-11-05 18:54:29 you said
general 2020-11-05 18:54:33 that they were oversized
general 2020-11-05 18:54:46 and juan
general 2020-11-05 18:54:49 there is no way in hell
general 2020-11-05 18:54:54 that a 100mm round could fit in
general 2020-11-05 18:56:18 
general 2020-11-05 18:56:37 since the chamber needs to go back
general 2020-11-05 18:56:42 that means the bullet
general 2020-11-05 18:56:46 can't be the size of the gun
general 2020-11-05 18:57:50 
general 2020-11-05 18:58:08 so the bullet can be 50mm at max
general 2020-11-05 18:58:23 but why couldn't you just say that its a different caliber
general 2020-11-05 18:58:41 it would be much easier just to say its a diff caliber
general 2020-11-05 18:59:07 yeah
general 2020-11-05 18:59:16 nah since there is infinite ammo
general 2020-11-05 18:59:19 its just a portal
general 2020-11-05 18:59:22 that summons bullets
general 2020-11-05 18:59:25 from teh void
general 2020-11-05 18:59:59 I guess
general 2020-11-05 19:01:37 
general 2020-11-05 19:02:28 sadly
general 2020-11-05 19:02:30 I think noobs

general 2020-11-05 19:02:34 put helium
general 2020-11-05 19:04:05 
general 2020-11-05 19:04:36 most tanks in ww2 had 37mm 57mm, or 75mm I think
general 2020-11-05 19:05:06 what just happened

help 2020-11-05 19:53:14 the side with the red should be down I think
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 20:29:36 I think I just got an idea
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 20:29:40 for how to make bombs
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 20:29:45 drop on the same key
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 20:29:48 but not the same time
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 20:29:53 only would work for 2 bombs though
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 20:30:31 all you'd have to do is use explosives instead of disconnectors, then set the blast radius to 0, have one set to explode on key, the other have it off
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 20:30:36 thats my idea anyways
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 21:17:34 I have mounted a cannon on my plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 21:17:38 that launches explosive balls
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 21:18:17 found out it was pretty easy

plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:33:49 Worlds most elite army: the 69th Shredder bug Regiment
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:35:05 Why are you making a Military Police Regiment
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:35:12 military police don't go into combat
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:35:42 > Guys later today I will be making an official plane crazy army group were going to have heli's tanks and more. Dm me to join
<@!395699933841195020>
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:35:46 > 9th medical platoon or 1st military police regiment <@!353348764280422402>
<@!395699933841195020>
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:37:25 Yeah but you didn't make it IRL
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:37:39 where is it's kitchen
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:37:41 how to get in it
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:38:03 its a restaurant right?
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:38:07 So where is it's kitchen
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:38:15 ok
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:38:18 But how do you get down
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:38:39 > tbh, u wouldnt afford to be able to go to it irl
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:38:42 No need to flex man
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:39:04 Uhh I can swim
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:39:17 but I don't wanna get my clothes wet right?
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:39:36 And how deep underwater is it
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:39:58 Yeah but how do you get the food down there without it being soggy?
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:40:14 yeah but why don't I just go into the watertight box?
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:40:21 or is it a tiny one
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:40:54 yeah so why don't they just make a staircase that goes underwater into the restaurant
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:41:23 That seems like the worst restaurant to exist
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:41:40 eeeeeh not really, since the food is premade and its in seawater
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:42:01 Yeah honestly it still seems bad to me
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:42:12 yeah...
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:43:14 but..
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:43:15 You said
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:43:18 you had to swim to it
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:44:07 but I thought we were talking about real life...
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:44:45 I am confused
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:45:25 I'd rather just go to In N Out
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:45:55 I don't really understand the appeal of a restaurant like that
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:46:19 Yeah I'd wanna go to a fast food restaurant
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:46:32 because I can just go to a store to see the uncooked fish
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:46:51 > before they are cooked?
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:47:05 At stores you can see fishes before they are cooked
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:47:21 also I dislike seafood
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:47:25 I like In N Out
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:48:19 Tbh I'd just wanna eat In N Out
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:48:57 I don't care about the "experience" of seeing some fishes in a restaurant
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:49:17 I can just go to an aquarium
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:49:40 I don't care
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:50:02 The experience of eating a good In N Out burger and fries is much better to me
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:50:24 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:50:27 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:50:50 its the gun block
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:53:20 I just looked it up
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:53:30 apparently it is $600 per person
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:53:35 Why would I go there
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:54:10 I literally don't care about the "experience"
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:54:13 I just want food
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:55:39 yeah I go to a fast food place for food
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:56:21 Yeah because I don't wanna pay $600
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:56:32 When I can just go to a fast food place and spend $10
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:57:01 you don't get the fact that I just want food
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:57:45 Nah I'd rather sit in In N Out
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 18:58:35 And I'd rather sit in In N Out and eat food I actually enjoy instead of learning a whole separate language just to eat some food I dislike
general 2020-11-17 20:37:02 R/choosingbeggars
general 2020-11-17 20:37:39 r/choosingbeggars
general 2020-11-17 20:41:07 rick rolled
general 2020-11-17 20:42:38 he got rick rolled
general 2020-11-17 20:42:57 yeah <@!739608016521003139> pretty common
general 2020-11-17 20:44:06 paying to win is not fun
general 2020-11-17 20:44:20 If you pay to win then there is nothing to do, nothing to grind, nothing to work towards
general 2020-11-17 20:45:31 same
general 2020-11-17 21:57:05 what
general 2020-11-17 21:57:32 I just wrote a paragraph on the polish dancing cow lyrics and what it means in english and the bot just deleted it
general 2020-11-17 21:57:49 Yes
general 2020-11-17 21:57:54 and how getting off of it is painful
general 2020-11-17 21:57:58 and how he wants to die
general 2020-11-30 18:36:53 ok
creations-chat 2020-11-30 18:44:55 its realy bad
creations-chat 2020-11-30 18:48:18 Scalemodeller upvoted the zeppelin
creations-chat 2020-11-30 18:50:00 why did scalemodeller upvote this
creations-chat 2020-12-01 17:37:06 Ye I saw the garlic
creations-chat 2020-12-01 17:38:39 saw this
(no I saw the other thing you sent too)
creations-chat 2020-12-01 17:40:10 also got the pic of it
creations-chat 2020-12-02 20:46:09 <@!695783576549195936> Aren't nuclear reactors bigger? Also why does the operator sit right next to it, hes getting a lethal dose of radiation I'm pretty sure, also isn't there supposed to be a cooling tower?
Where is the turbine and generator that it powers?
Also its definitely going to explode because of the lack of cooling
aaaaaaaand I'm pretty sure there aren't pipes making liquid uranium flow into the reactor
help 2020-12-02 20:53:12 <@!658829907110920192> heres a suggestion:
Maybe try stormworks sometime if you are bored with plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:56:25 <@!565300409170919454> 
*Birb noises*
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:56:56 My pfp is a prairie falcon wearing a beret
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:58:00 Well you see
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:58:03 they live in prairies
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 21:03:43 if blocks were stronger then warships in plane crazy would actually have a use
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 21:03:50 or if they could be manned by more people
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 21:04:25 My tanks survive decently since most of them are artillery tanks or just really fast
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 21:04:34 but I have a pretty decent plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 21:05:06 I don't even really play plane crazy anymore
help 2020-12-02 21:05:26 well its much more advanced
help 2020-12-02 21:06:17 For example, this is a picture of a large engine in stormworks that I found on google
help 2020-12-02 21:06:46 Also engines can overheat, need fuel, cooling, an exhaust, air supply, etc
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 21:08:19 no
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 21:08:22 I play stormworks
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 21:08:59 Stormworks is more fun for me since its more complex, realistic, and generally just a better game.
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 21:10:06 a game on steam
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 21:21:26 btw you can make cannons rockets and flamethrowers in stormworks
help 2020-12-02 21:25:43 exactly I'm helping him since he said he was bored with plane crazy so I suggested stormworks and I showed something from stormworks
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:28:39 is plane crazy no longer getting updates
plane-crazy 2022-01-20 22:26:28 It will come when your father comes home with the milk
general 2022-01-20 22:28:36 Dead of lack of oxygen
general 2022-01-20 22:30:46 I appear to be loading a 5.56 24 inch barrel AR15 rifle
general 2022-01-20 22:33:57 60 cal?
general 2022-01-20 22:34:14 What mm is 60 cal
general 2022-01-20 22:34:47 What MM
general 2022-01-20 22:35:14 Are you getting confused with 50 cal (13mm)
general 2022-01-20 22:36:19 What MM is it?
general 2022-01-20 22:37:18 It’s not 90mm
general 2022-01-20 22:37:26 90mm is larger
general 2022-01-20 22:37:50 50 cal is 13mm, so 60 cal would not be 90mm
general 2022-01-20 22:39:08 No
general 2022-01-20 22:39:15 Probably more around 15mm
general 2022-01-20 22:39:24 Or 14.5mm
general 2022-01-20 22:39:52 It’s large, but not in the grand scheme of things
general 2022-01-20 22:40:00 That reminds me how tiny 556 actually is
