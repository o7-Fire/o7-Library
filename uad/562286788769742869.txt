general 2021-01-23 04:40:00 Pog
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 04:40:11 Alright i have a question-
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 04:41:01 So basically this game does have controller support bur the left joystick isnt being recognized, it there a part of coding in the game that hasnt been implemented for the left joystick?
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 04:41:31 Eh
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 04:41:38 D pad does work though
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 04:43:01 Believe me  ive played alot of Ace combat games (which is basically a jet fighting Arcade game) and not being able to use the controller is hard
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 04:46:55 Nahh
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 04:47:00 When you build a jet plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 04:47:05 Thats a whole different story

<:BIG3:588443788721258534><:BIG4:588443798842114088>
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 06:57:48 If yall want to take a look at my jet go ahead
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 06:59:49 Mines a ADF-01 jet
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:00:25 If only we had flat motor panels life would be easier
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:01:30 Plus they need to make the the left joystick working
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:02:02 Believe me the jet im using only is able to use the bottons or the d pad
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:02:37 Plus adding Yawning To this jet is kinda a hard thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:07:20 Should i use Jet engines or rockets?
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:09:32 Man if there was a Jet that is a 3 x 2 it would be nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:20:33 Lego?
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:21:27 Anywho this game needs Wing panel motors
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:21:49 And a choice to have anything set at an angel
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:27:57 Yeah about that, hows that gonna work when the motors are the only thing that makes your aircraft move
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:28:51 Rip
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:29:28 Next update will be wing panel motors
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:29:39 Hopefully
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:29:40 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:29:46 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:30:13 Both
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:30:27 Come on both can be added
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:30:40 Makes things better

plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:34:13 Anywho time to redesign my jet
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 07:42:31 And a jet engine thats basically the f-22 but a  3 x 2
general 2021-01-23 07:45:06 Very un pog
general 2021-01-23 07:45:30 Eh?
general 2021-01-23 09:17:41 Hey look a Su-57
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 09:42:38 It be nice if the game had a Missile lock on Thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 09:43:20 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 09:43:47 Why not increase the weapon cooldown?
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 09:44:16 I dont see a problem with it
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 09:45:01 Question is how are they gonna fit it all?
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 09:45:58 Isnt that the reason they can lower the Limit
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 09:47:05 I dont think they will fit on my ADF-01
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 09:52:10 You mean missiles?
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 09:56:02 Holy crap
plane-crazy 2021-01-23 09:56:06 Thats beautiful
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 02:49:37 Hmm
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 07:00:06 Dont you just connect two motors?
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 07:35:33 What about 12 year olds
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 07:35:48 They taste alot more better ya know?
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 07:35:49 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 07:36:17 The meat is More tender and more juicier
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 08:17:11 For some reason when i turn my jet tends to move size to side.
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 11:24:15 this game kinda reminds meof another game similar to plane crazy..
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 11:29:55 no no not that one. it had alot of variation with many guns, tank wheels, your allowed to make any build, and it was like a harvesting type game cause in the campaign in the game you need to gather materials and sell them to get money and do missions that gives you item to use to add to your creation
the-dump 2021-03-23 00:55:54 Hey wait a minute thats a Orginal Vw Beatle-

plane-crazy 2021-06-20 18:59:23 Hopefully they add flat motors  just like real jets
plane-crazy 2021-06-20 19:00:03 And having to not use big and bulky motors

plane-crazy 2021-07-26 08:46:46 question- why does my jet wiggle side to side------
the-dump 2021-07-26 09:00:41 f
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 16:58:36 That looks quite nice
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 16:59:11 Though because we dont have rounded edges i see you had to compromise some things
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 16:19:20 Thats a hella nice F-16
plane-crazy 2021-08-03 16:19:59 Can only assume this might be a G.91

plane-crazy 2021-08-20 14:16:55 It be cool if there was radar for jets and Ground Anti air stuff

plane-crazy 2021-08-23 17:06:22 Shit ive been discovered
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 12:51:22 Thats nice
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 12:52:54 Anywho so question- are yall having problems with The conveyor suspension drive?
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 12:56:03 For me it completely crashes my game
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 12:56:23 Try adding an anchor block and see how it goes
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 12:56:53 You might need to change the settings on the suspension
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 12:57:30 Try damping 100
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 12:57:36 Abd free length 1
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 12:57:42 Thats how i have it on
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 12:57:56 Plus with 1 on each side
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 12:58:57 I have something similar but its half block and a full block in the middle with conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 12:59:22 But for some reason it makes my jet spin on the x axis
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 12:59:40 And keeps self aligning to point up
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 12:59:50 And of course
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 12:59:54 Crash ny whole game
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 13:00:24 But if i ever go the hover drive it creates problems
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 13:01:17 Hover makes my jet unstable on 1k speed
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 13:01:28 Tried it on the adf-01
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 13:03:08 I moght try this one
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 13:03:28 Is the material needing to he the same?
plane-crazy 2021-08-24 13:12:48 Is the conveyor suspension drive easily thrown off by small imbalances?

plane-crazy 2021-10-04 20:41:52 Nice!
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 21:57:23 Now thinking about it- do you get anything off of alot of upvotes?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 21:57:56 Ah
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 21:58:46 Im proud of my me 262
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 21:59:41 I kinda do that but because of "some" toxicity of others with builds i just figure it out myself
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 21:59:45 Or ask people in game
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:00:31 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:00:38 Me 262?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:00:48 Never heard of the first jet ever built?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:01:47 It was built by the germans during ww2
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:03:18 The first version had a prop jet in the front with its jet engines
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:04:09 There were several variants (some built and some as prototypes) one that had pulse jets
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:04:41 I mean it was the start of a jet era
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:05:21 Depends
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:05:33 Both have its strengths and weaknesses
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:05:49 Its like buying or getting the speaker pass
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:05:58 Pretty much you jave it
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:06:11 Yes?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:06:23 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:06:34 Unless there talking irl wise
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:08:02 Oh yeah rockets
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:08:22 Jets are Just use to make it more sound realistic
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:08:25 Well
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:08:32 """"realistic""
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:17:09 Just build everything first
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:17:28 Then test
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:17:50 Oh that kinda dont matter
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:18:39 I mean as long as you have a stable weight you won't have any problems
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:18:55 My me 262 is a stable jet
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:19:33 The center of mass and lift for my me 26?
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:19:36 262?*
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:22:10 <@588668543415877662>
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:22:45 Sorry i would do screenshot in pc but im still coming back from home
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:23:02 I guess? The reason its above is all the motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:23:16 Nahhhh
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:23:44 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:24:39 The motor lock mostly changes the weight but when everything is compact the weight lowers
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:25:06 Because its possible to compact stuff
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:25:08 Since well
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:25:09 Irl
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:25:11 But
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:25:31 Use both ballast and helium anf play around with the two
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:25:42 If you see it move down
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:25:50 To much weight in the front
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:25:53 If it moves up
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:25:56 To much helium
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:26:09 That's how i manage to get my me 262 to stay Ballance
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:26:27 It defines the mass
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:26:35 Doesn't matter
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:27:33 Hardcoding
plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:28:20 <:Upvote:490311647492309004> <:Upvote:490311647492309004> <:Upvote:490311647492309004> <:Upvote:490311647492309004>

plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:29:44 I mean what yiu need is a good wingspan, leveling of your jet (or plane) and equal weight

plane-crazy 2021-10-04 22:37:22 How did we go from balancing a jet to physics, to mass, to drug dealing, german tanks and cats

plane-crazy 2021-10-08 17:01:21 People are saying if my build is a tut for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 17:02:41 I dont think builds like mine even do that much motor lock-
plane-crazy 2021-10-08 17:03:49 Shit that means i gotta delete my turbo jets to make the wingspan smaller

plane-crazy 2021-10-30 03:05:56 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 03:06:43 Either Roblox is really slow or something because if it takes 3 weeks to get a server running back on then you know they dont give a shit lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 03:08:09 Because the lack of funding (probably) on making larger servers and them sticking to there other servers the amount of players all at once coming cause a large bottleneck to the servers and cause it to overload soo yeah
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 03:09:28 Because of how money hungry they are
plane-crazy 2021-10-30 03:09:41 Lets take war thunder for a reason

plane-crazy 2021-11-16 14:05:28 I feel like Rick should try to add in aigaion-
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 17:13:14 <@217336009455566848> is it a bug in the code that causes the wobble? It only happens when many entities (players) are spawned in, it also happens when large builds are spawned in causing lag
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 17:14:49 It happens to other players too not just me
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 17:16:00 Soo
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 17:16:07 Wait
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 17:16:13 But if its because of wings
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 17:16:47 Then why does it happen when large builds or lots of players are spawned?
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 17:18:24 Doesn't makw sense if wings are the problem
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 17:19:14 Perhaps
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 17:21:13 So guess rick has two things to consider
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 17:21:25 The lag and the bug in the wings

creations-chat 2022-04-16 18:26:09 Sadly no they do not move for yaw purposes, the best you can do for yaw is use control panels but it won't do alot in high speed because you should never yaw while in high speeds in real life, in low speed you can yaw, you can try to use small props to help yaw- and also thank you for your complement

plane-crazy 2022-10-05 09:26:07 Hopefully there's a way to increase the wing panels thickness
plane-crazy 2022-10-05 09:26:13 On pc2
plane-crazy 2022-10-05 09:27:04 Having realistically thick wings is nice
plane-crazy 2022-10-05 09:28:07 Though hopefully the thickness gradually decreases like a normal wing were on the front is thicker and the end is thinner

plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:09:31 If you come to think of it, pcc is quite toxic <a:popcat:783358897385373717>
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:11:44 No it's not that, it's the people itself within the community <:peeposmile:984873173411573770>
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:13:10 Plus Constructuve criticism is out the window since majority of good builders only think to themselves <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:13:23 Not all but majority
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:14:30 They really have such high standards, like Asian parents expecting their 1 second old son to play the piano or solve quantum physics

plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:15:48 Creativity was thrown out once motolock was implemented
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:16:12 Is this functions?
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:16:57 But they don't have to be brain dead to say "build bad, exposed motorlcc guhhh"
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:17:57 woudlve been better if they werent so skull heavy and pulled their head out of their asses
plane-crazy 2023-02-13 15:18:22 see what i mean

plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:03:38 Lock on Missiles will be nice
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:03:58 Bruh
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:04:43 Building one is pretty pointless
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:05:32 Lol building any missile will just make it entirely shitty and only work on slow targets or ground targets
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:06:24 Orrr just fuckin make Lock on Missiles and add flares into the game
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:06:37 And also rework the rockers
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:06:43 Ye
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:06:51 For better immersion of flying
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:07:34 Well if flares are added the ground stuff will add them
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:08:55 With what exactly?.
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:09:35 I mean your gonna need a good Large machine gun to shoot it down
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:09:50 And good tracking
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:10:14 I mean it makes sense to have them be weak hp
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:10:29 Or just make missiles only for air
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:11:09 Ye lo
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:11:43 Yeep
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:11:53 Had to use multiple in order for one of em to hit
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:11:54 Isk
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:13:12 Tbh There's a lot of things that can be added like 120 mm guns, Flak guns, anti air guns, Regular guns for Aircraft and whatnot
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:13:16 Thought people might abuse that
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:13:21 Simple
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:13:28 Limit the amount there is
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:14:10 4 would be nice
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:14:13 Just a cool down
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:14:30 Nah to long tbh
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:14:50 Well if your talking about reload time
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:15:05 Then probably longer like 14
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:15:07 15*
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:15:18 But like For locking on and firing
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:16:04 Maybe no cool down with firing missiles but the missiles are dependent on the pilot Aiming and firing them
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:16:42 Basically Missiles will be great because alot of people would just simply spam missiles without thinking much and miss their target
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:18:23 That's what's great about adding missiles, you have to take the time to keep yourself tracking the enemy which will already be a pain
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:19:01 Maybe adding radar would be nice <a:popcat:783358897385373717>
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:19:23 That is quite the downside
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:20:34 I mean we don't really know how much the physics is gonna affect our build- so that's a start
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:21:12 Ayy
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:21:21 In what way though?
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:21:24 The cutters?
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:21:29 Or it's the motors?
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:21:33 Noice
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:22:20 Unless your going against hella skilled against hella skilled pilots
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:22:34 Yeee
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:23:02 Meaning exactly?
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:23:17 Just dumb it down
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:23:20 I'll probably understand it
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:23:34 Will do later
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:23:40 Oop
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:23:42 Nvm
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:23:51 They ded prob
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:25:15 The best thing that might be bad or good depending on how it is, is radar, we are already struggling to to shoot down planes as anti air and what not, so why not be able to use radar to get ahead of the enemy fighter and shoot them down a little bit more quicker
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:25:50 Also it wing thickness gonna be a thing now?
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:26:30 Because it's be nice being able to hard various thickness to the wings and maybe angle them to a certain degree
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:27:19 Well let's just hope that the new game.will be good
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:27:36 Even though it's been considered a myth now <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:28:03 In the meantime Tank treads are gonna be nice having
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:34:48 Ohhhhh
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:35:00 Causing a chain reaction to any other
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:35:30 Why not landing at an airport or somewhat if Rick adds, a Military Air force base
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:35:47 Yeah!
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:35:56 Camping is gonna be so much worse though
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:36:00 Probably not
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:36:34 That's smart
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:38:00 So about the ammo box, since motor locking is a thing, any decently sized should be able to fit it other then micro fighters rights?
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:38:12 Well maybe micro fighter just not alot fo ammo to store
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:38:15 In which
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:38:40 Brings the fact that maybe those annoying "bees" will come to a end
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:38:55 Pretty nice
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:41:42 Unless they got a huge impractical motor locking with hover drivers
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:42:42 True true
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:43:16 So basically "only" 3 wide 1 block nosed jets will fit the deal
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:43:25 Same
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:46:19 So one hit and boom
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:46:36 Would make dog fighting so much Funner
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:47:23 Thought are we still sticking with the old ways then if missiles aren't added and we are stuck using rocketsm
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:48:23 Because if rockets are reworked, we still need to do close quarters even though the rockets will have better tracking
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:54:28 Well we should just try missiles for one
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 11:54:37 If we don't like it we don't have to use it

help 2023-04-03 09:43:49 What could be the reason why my jet is rolling left and right, even when I don't want it too? I ruled out imbalance since everything is balanced, I have made the stabilizers put in a angle, and when I made them completely straight, it started to roll out of no where, so I don't know, could anyone be willing to help me out?
