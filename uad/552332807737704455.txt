plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:26:38 weird stuff always happens when i switch parts of my aircrafts to fabric and im wondering; do fabric blocks have aerodynamics? or are they just broken af
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:26:56 wdym
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:27:32 like a fabric normal block has slight aerodynamics, or a fabric wing is better than a normal wing
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:28:21 like can i make a wing out of half fabric blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:28:48 oh yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:28:54 i was only thinking about it being lighter
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:29:34 is foil better then?
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:30:21 but i need lighter
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 01:33:04 wait did they update foil's weight? i did a test like a year or so ago and foil and fabric were the same
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 18:59:00 bro why do you keep pinging them to respond
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 18:59:16 ah

general 2020-08-26 01:15:16 Well what do you call them?
general 2020-08-28 03:19:26 would a symmetry building mode be possible? i want to suggest it but its so obvious it feels like it would already exist if it could
general 2020-08-28 03:19:50 like you build on one side and the same part with the same setting builds on the other side
general 2020-08-28 03:20:23 yeah mirror
general 2020-08-28 03:20:36 center would be difficult
general 2020-08-28 03:20:39 didnt think about that
general 2020-08-28 03:21:14 but what if you have a 1x7 going into the center
general 2020-08-28 03:22:52 so can i suggest mirror building mode without being pinged for it not being possible due to the code
general 2020-08-28 03:23:15 wait i cant even suggest
general 2020-08-28 03:23:17 oof

plane-crazy 2020-08-28 04:25:57 without making the bullet go super slow*
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 04:26:29 yeah thats what i use
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 04:26:49 nope
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 04:27:02 they fire perfectly fine when not aimed at someone
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 04:27:18 they explode at about the right time when hitting landscape
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 04:27:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 04:27:52 alright
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 04:36:23 > try to make the impact speed higher
it seems to just make them not explode at all, or be the same
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 04:38:06 indeed
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 04:38:13 so what do i do
help 2020-08-28 04:41:36 I have a explosive ball gun but they always seem to explode before the target. is there any way to make them explode at the right time?

plane-crazy 2020-09-02 17:46:13 this changes nothing for casual builders

plane-crazy 2021-02-17 20:25:20 Fireworks: perfect looking cylinder
Also fireworks: connections on more than 1-2 sides, but not on all the sides
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 19:58:04 Does that work to any degree
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 20:02:58 For me, a magnet cannon expert, i would say no, but for asthetics and spacing, ill accept it
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 20:03:07 Absolutely amazing
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 20:04:35 Lmao yeah
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 20:04:49 Unless you fired tips jars.......
general 2021-03-09 18:48:18 anyone know what was in <#490306593242611742> ? it showed a new message there but there seems to be nothing
general 2021-03-12 05:05:36 random question: is "hardcoded" another way to say "spaghetti code"
general 2021-03-12 05:06:22 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 22:26:04 Did i do it?
Yes. 
What did it cost?
I had to play plane crazy on mobile and ride a tutorial from someone else to get there
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 22:26:55 One-day events always seem to happen when im away from my pc
plane-crazy 2021-06-05 16:44:05 is anyone else not able to trigger super rocket engines?

plane-crazy 2021-07-17 14:10:22 just destroyed a fighter tut plane so hard theyre now building a shredder i think
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 14:10:38 the game's tut, not an online tut
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 14:10:59 nvm lmao
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 14:11:27 the most effective way to remove a cannon is explosive spam
plane-crazy 2021-07-17 14:22:14 the scariest words a no-tut plane crazian can hear: "im not copying you, im following a tut"
general 2021-08-07 00:25:27 did madattak leave the server at some point? or did he rename himself in discord?
general 2021-08-07 00:26:02 was about to do my monthly check of mad's messages, but hes not in the "from: " thing
general 2021-08-07 00:26:15 is that a role cause i cant click it
general 2021-08-07 00:26:42 oh hey its back for some reason
general 2021-08-07 00:26:47 alright, thx
general 2021-08-07 00:27:47 think i just caused the temporary summoning of mad
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:36:24 What was the message in <#529858892075761694>
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:37:13 is vc an option in roblox games nowadays?
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:37:24 i know there was talk like half a year ago but i only play pc lmao
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:37:48 ah

plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:38:32 i would rather not vc in a public pvp server with 10 nine year olds all spamming random earrape
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:39:35 hopefully they add a mute
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:39:43 so you can just silence other people on your end
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:40:43 probably most children without IDs will just ask their parents lmao
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:41:10 me with magnet cannoned ships: pathetic
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:41:50 hasnt stopped children using their parent's (anything) in the past lmao
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:44:47 magnet cannoned ships is on the bucket list, but i have plenty of other things of equal power
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:45:02 lmao
general 2021-09-23 01:46:00 wait so is infinite map confirmed or not? i thought it was confirmed false earlier but someone just mentioned it in chat a little while ago
general 2021-09-23 01:47:04 Infinite map seems like a lot more work for something that wont be too important to most and a lot heavier on performance
general 2021-09-23 01:47:36 nice! good to hear it confirmed
general 2021-09-23 01:47:47 low permormance impact, that is
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:48:12 infinite save slots, infinite map, infinite build area next?
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:48:36 infinite shredders if you try to earrape in chat
general 2021-09-23 01:50:15 will play time transfer to pc2?
general 2021-09-23 01:50:58 ay 500 hours on pc is 500 hours on pc, to me it doesnt matter which one, just that it's plane crazy
general 2021-09-23 01:51:47 lemme guess.... more devolopers?
general 2021-09-23 01:51:49 lmao
general 2021-09-23 01:52:18 mad shaped cloud in the sky
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:52:31 that isnt kirby
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:52:38 it's eyes and mouth are too large
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 01:53:08 too large
general 2021-09-23 01:53:48 secretly rickje will make it hide a conveyor engine on the inside
general 2021-09-23 01:55:04 747s*
general 2021-09-23 01:55:50 yeah rickje why cant you just add all the elements and their realistic interactions atom by atom?
general 2021-09-23 01:56:27 you must finally defeat lord shredder
general 2021-09-23 01:56:43 i already have a pretty damn powerfull bomb. just a flying magnet cannon XD
general 2021-09-23 01:58:51 rickje the almighty object
general 2021-09-23 01:59:25 really @ed him for an obvious thing lmao
general 2021-09-23 01:59:36 for the tutorial??
general 2021-09-23 02:00:11 yeah we need to ping him mo- (banned)
general 2021-09-23 02:00:46 when? 
Why?
general 2021-09-23 02:01:27 motorlock, camera lock, glitch engines
general 2021-09-23 02:01:50 RICKJE THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MY PC CAREER: *will magnets be 2 sided finally, like real magnets?*
general 2021-09-23 02:02:03 this would be very bad for my cannons if so
general 2021-09-23 02:02:31 electro magnets are typically 2 sided too tho
general 2021-09-23 02:03:16 could still go wrong lmao
general 2021-09-23 02:03:59 it attempts to be infinite
general 2021-09-23 02:04:01 WAIT
general 2021-09-23 02:04:25 i cant remember the name of it
general 2021-09-23 02:04:32 the outlands of minecraft
general 2021-09-23 02:04:35 frick what's it called
general 2021-09-23 02:04:40 but in plane crazy
general 2021-09-23 02:06:25 rickje please my magnet monstrocities
general 2021-09-23 02:06:27 i must know
general 2021-09-23 02:07:07 no. cat guns
general 2021-09-23 02:07:12 like the Gmod thing
general 2021-09-23 02:07:27 mewmewmewmewmew and it fires rainbows
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 02:08:56 is it a timer? i thought it was just until the person moved a substantial amount, because stationary turrets always seem to have longer spawn protection than my vehicles
general 2021-09-23 02:09:54 is the build area going to be increased in size?
general 2021-09-23 02:12:10 i want to continue to interrogate rickje but i have other stuff to do lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:48:42 finally getting into using slightly more advanced motor locking in some builds, but when i motor lock 2 motor 2 triangles into eachother (using motor 2s to create 3 lines 120 degrees out from eachother) they cant hold their position, and glitch out. How do i counter this?
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:49:07 loading roblox to get a screenshot of it
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:50:15 ooooh dang okay
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:50:29 with motor lock on to keep it in place, or just high torque?
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:50:34 no not the locking
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:50:36 im not an idiot lmao
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:50:40 i mean the angles
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:50:43 keeping the angles
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:51:05 
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:51:12 
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:51:23 but then it gets glitchy after the second screenshot
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:51:45 wip six shooter
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:52:30 is there any blocks i could use as a max angle for the motors to go that keep it at 120?
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:52:47 instead of having to use a macro
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:53:28 my relative F-ed your (insert 999 Grands here) mother
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:54:27 the first recorded documentation of anything on earth is a tablet that we believe reads "it was only 3 inches"
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:55:38 so anyways as i was saying, is there any 30 degree, or 120 degree slope
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:55:44 in block form
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 23:59:44 i have a missile battery with like 50 missiles. is it a  hwacha or just a missile silo
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:00:24 simple, but do you want it to do damage?
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:00:36 what type
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:00:45 cause railguns are hard to make do damage in pc sadly
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:01:12 cutters dont work at all due to no pierce, tnt only works when the game lags a bit so it does explode "correctly"
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:01:23 which is why i switched to even more confusing weaponry
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:02:04 the projectile impacts, bounces, and maybe sometimes takes 1 single block
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:02:34 rifling in pc makes it pierce??
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:02:41 that doesnt sound like pc physics
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:03:23 i dont know what type of magnet cannons yall are using but my cannons fire straight ahead each shot for several hundred shots
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:03:37 HEHEHEH i can show you one that does
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:03:46 ye
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:03:50 username
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:04:18 rifling as in making a twist in the barrel so the bullet spins??
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:04:29 it says user not found
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:04:58 dude you mean just making the magnet's center of propultion on it in the center of the barrel makes it go straight?
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:05:20 you cant make it spin laterally without a 3 wide projectile
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:05:30 wait is it laterally i forget
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:05:34 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 00:05:52 are you in game

plane-crazy 2021-12-15 00:14:43 Yeah but if theres a new block this year, the 4 years before wont exactly help.
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:25:18 Hey, havent played pc in a while. Why are certain particle effects not appearing?
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:25:22 I have particles set to on in settings
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:25:25 and graphics max
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:25:52 do i have to rejoin lobbies?
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 01:25:58 is it only in vip servers now?
bug-reports 2022-02-08 01:32:50 Might still just be a settings issue, but since im not going to get help from other channels and ive done the stuff below, im just going to list this as a bug in case it is one:

Particles have been sparcely appearing for me the last few times ive joined ( a few months now). Sometimes they work, sometimes they dont. I have Graphics set to max, i have particles on in settings, ive tried using other combinations of those, and ive tried both public and private servers. I cant figure out why the particles aren't working
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 12:36:31 hey does anyone know how to fix that problem with motor 2s where it acts inverted even though it shouldnt be? (and no, inverting it doesnt solve the issue.)
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 12:37:21 its for build that has to be mouse guided
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 12:37:47 5x scale shredder
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 12:38:50 its a meme shredder dum dum
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 12:39:02 impractical in like literally every way
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 12:39:28 so can anyone ACTUALLY help me?
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 12:39:30 lmao
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 12:39:50 ye

plane-crazy 2022-10-08 16:43:27 fun
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 15:02:22 Such a wonderful community in this game
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 22:57:26 Madattak wearing a mask
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 02:08:15 so loaded a big build in a public server and suddenly half of it disappeared
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 02:08:28 i immediately left to be safe, but anyone know what that was?
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 02:08:48 not launched, just loaded
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 02:08:59 lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 02:09:26 i thought i heard something about a hack client that can trade builds, but was that someone stealing my build?
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 02:10:44 ah. Alr, thanks!
