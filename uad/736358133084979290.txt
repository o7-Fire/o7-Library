general 2021-01-31 01:07:40 I built a hover tank.

general 2021-01-31 01:13:09 And yes, IK.
general 2021-01-31 01:13:17 Because it was a repost.
creations-chat 2021-01-31 01:33:20 Ok.
creations-chat 2021-01-31 01:35:29 I sent more pictures of my tank.
creations-chat 2021-01-31 01:37:30 <@!651950786955313153> You should add more wedges to it, too blocky. For example, the front can use 1X1 - 1X4 Wedges for a less blocky apearance.
creations-chat 2021-01-31 01:40:17 If there were no wedges there, then it would be blocky, add wedges to make it less blocky and ugly.
creations-chat 2021-01-31 01:44:24 Try revamping it just like what Dragonplatinum would do so to his own creations that were made a long time ago.

general 2021-10-09 05:37:10 What do you guys want to know? Everything about the big bang? Stuff that no one knows?
general 2021-10-09 05:38:42 Not mine.

general 2021-10-09 05:42:38 ..
general 2021-10-09 05:42:58 My point is, why do you think I am using a 21873590815790481372304137 block plane?
general 2021-10-09 05:43:32 heads
general 2021-10-09 05:44:26 I'm using a jet that can reverse takeoff at 3K speed.
general 2021-10-09 05:44:36 And fly at 700 speed.
general 2021-10-09 05:44:55 the thing you are missing is, that it is a heavily modified shredder bug.
general 2021-10-09 05:45:13 also, fuck me, it's not even here anymore, anyways lets stop this
general 2021-10-09 05:46:10 It has a spinning shredder on it, it has magnet drives, and it is wide.

general 2022-03-21 01:35:00 Yeah.. don't think because I got blacklisted that I am an idiot, looks like YOU are the real idiot here.
general 2022-03-21 01:35:50 Everyone decides that if someone here has a blacklist, they are stupid.
general 2022-03-21 01:36:33 It was like 10 months ago.
general 2022-03-21 01:36:44 It's a standard thing for me to not read the rules.
general 2022-03-21 01:36:51 And what is your point here?
general 2022-03-21 01:37:08 Why are you lashing out at someone for saying a letter of the alphabet?
general 2022-03-21 01:38:17 People really do like to react violently to the slightest things.
general 2022-03-21 01:39:06 I won't be suprised if one of you guys use a butchers knife to kill an ant.
general 2022-03-21 01:40:29 Nice, looks like someone is trying to act cool.
general 2022-03-21 01:40:54 I now read the rules.
general 2022-03-21 01:41:19 But I'm freaking tired of discord servers censoring words like "fuck"
general 2022-03-21 01:42:35 But if someone tells someone to shut up and they are an unde because they said "E", they might be a little dumb.
general 2022-03-21 01:43:40 I didn't know some people are so dumb that they make an argument over a single letter.
general 2022-03-21 01:45:18 btw is there a way to remove suggestions blacklist?

general 2022-03-23 18:58:42 Suggestions blacklist, it's been like 10 months, I and I asked a mod to remove it.
general 2022-03-23 18:59:33 It's not like I am going to suggest anything anymore, it's just that I get fucking cyber bullied for it.
general 2022-03-23 18:59:53 heh.
