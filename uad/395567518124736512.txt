creations-chat 2021-06-27 01:32:19 joshua speaking of it, why did you downvote our build?
creations-chat 2021-06-27 01:34:55 it wasnt meant to be pretty, but meant to be a unique coop build, we couldnt exactly build well when we would colide eachother
creations-chat 2021-06-27 01:37:05 to add to it, we probably would never get this chance again, so we rushed to make something unique instead of putting a ton of time into looks - if server closed we would never be able to build it again
creations-chat 2021-06-27 01:39:56 What if someone would join and make a server crasher?
creations-chat 2021-06-27 01:42:00 Well my friend joined me and his plot glitched then i rejoined and boom same plot. We probably wont get to do this again
creations-chat 2021-06-27 01:48:20 If ur lucky, sometimes u get a broken plot that 2 people can use

plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:18:03 litteral illegal
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:18:28 youre not allowed to edit any id even if its ur own
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:19:07 .
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:19:59 they litterally have ur ip
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:23:32 its not about that lmao, modifying ur id isnt gonna be moderated by roblox, they send the information on to some other company that has the resources to do that
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:24:05 roblox is multi millionare
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:24:07 lmfao
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:25:32 more like 50cents per user
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:25:56 is easy
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:26:13 and all that is automated
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:26:26 it litterally is
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:27:06 50 cents per user -> 500k for 1 million users
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:27:16 it is
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:27:19 probably less
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:31:12 alright, since we cant know for sure but assume, this is how i think it works:

they scan your image, save text, confirm text, if it is deemed invalid it will alert employees and try to investigate further. Then it will lookup your login credentials and get an accurate location of where the image was sent. If a vpn is used, it will probably contact many vpn services for information aswell
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:32:22 ^
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:33:51 not stonks
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:34:48 that is true
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:35:09 also true
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:36:11 simply send direct instructions to ur cpu from their servers via the port in the roblox app
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:37:13 also if you just have the right command in litteral any console, you can make any pc in the world do anything
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 20:37:40 not a virus

general 2022-11-06 22:23:52 Will you provide transport?
the-dump 2022-11-07 21:42:48 hmmm
plane-crazy 2022-11-10 15:31:28 pretty sure they can
general 2022-11-10 22:56:18 i think thats the same theme i used in a powerpoint for my exam
general 2022-11-10 22:57:11 Is that an amogus
general 2022-11-10 22:57:35 it is
general 2022-11-10 22:58:56 I put dumb stuff in my presentations regulary
general 2022-11-10 23:00:11 okay okay but is it worse than this
general 2022-11-10 23:00:21 
general 2022-11-10 23:00:43 Also made in powerpoint
general 2022-11-10 23:04:06 on my actual exam, on the last page, my friends and i all put mythical wise tree in the background at like 95% transparency
general 2022-11-10 23:04:13 it was slightly visible
general 2022-11-10 23:05:09 (i passed)
general 2022-11-10 23:05:47 lucky
general 2022-11-10 23:06:27 istg college for me is just a mess of jokes and humor rn
general 2022-11-10 23:07:16 I made a jojo essay on my grade school exam
creations-chat 2022-11-18 20:59:39 169
creations-chat 2022-11-19 21:58:08 longer? currently 250 blocks long iirc

its a custom carrier and i can add another 50 to length

245 long
creations-chat 2022-11-19 22:05:06 no hangar
creations-chat 2022-11-19 22:11:20 well technically this is the hangar so far..

its not optimal for storing aircraft
creations-chat 2022-11-19 22:13:54 you also ran out of normal building blocks? (i did)
creations-chat 2022-11-19 22:17:22 yea i know, i said that cuz your build was made of ice and default material
creations-chat 2022-11-19 22:44:17 think you could fix it? gl
creations-chat 2022-11-19 23:01:12 yes and with this amount of space and a fold its not exactly easy

litterally no space
creations-chat 2022-11-19 23:11:27 hahaha funny you say that
creations-chat 2022-11-19 23:49:54 remove toggle if its on
creations-chat 2022-11-19 23:52:39 show motor and settings
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 23:54:35 ah
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 23:55:15 prob because lag, its gonna be hard to **tap** can get it to stay but you can move it easily when holding down for a while
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 23:55:23 lock is the cause
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 23:55:54 youre gonna wait a long time
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 23:56:01 however
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 23:56:14 you can try joining a server with lowest ping possible
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 23:56:36 a public server should be fine
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 23:56:40 but low ping
plane-crazy 2022-11-19 23:56:51 like sub 70 if youre able to
general 2022-11-20 00:37:33 wide motor

the-dump 2022-12-14 22:49:25 ive been making an ai chat bot and i came across this gem
creations-chat 2022-12-14 22:53:30 You could try some dark dark gray and some orange and purple
bug-reports 2022-12-18 07:05:10 fr, stop using some free stupid server that will crash every 5 minutes to host the bot on, just buy a 24/h host for 5 dollars
creations-chat 2022-12-19 21:33:59 is this length good for my custom carrier? (Length not the shape) 300 blocks
creations-chat 2022-12-19 21:39:27 i got 0 blocksspace to make a proper hull

(Single account build)

No dumb, then it cant move properly
creations-chat 2022-12-19 21:56:06 shut up, i was asking if the length was good anyway, not anything about the hull - your input isnt needed

then dont bother answering? also nice typo
