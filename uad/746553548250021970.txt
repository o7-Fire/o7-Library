creations-chat 2020-12-10 16:10:39 any cannon housing ideas for this? Edit to say that I didn't get a very clear shot of it
creations-chat 2020-12-10 16:12:45 another picture of it
creations-chat 2020-12-10 16:43:18 The canon didn't get much feedback, so this is just a repost. Any of you guys got any idea how to make it look better?
creations-chat 2020-12-10 16:45:19 ok, thx for being honest. I appreciate it!
creations-chat 2020-12-11 22:17:11 ok, no problem man!
creations-chat 2020-12-11 22:24:51 It might just be me, but the second plane (the one on the right) the little things sticking out seem kinda wack. Don't really got any other tips to fix it tho. Your probably fine. Otherwise, it looks absolutely amazing.
creations-chat 2020-12-11 22:26:52 seems about right. I don't really know much about design, so you can ignore me.
creations-chat 2020-12-12 05:32:26 anyone ever done a U2 spy plane?

plane-crazy 2021-07-09 15:48:25 ok
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 15:48:36 I feel like this is like coding.
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 15:48:47 you first get into it, and think "this is gonna be easy!"
plane-crazy 2021-07-09 15:48:59 then nothing goes to plan, and you hide in a corner, and cry.

creations-chat 2021-09-21 13:40:24 bad tornad, does not yet spin, any ideas for improvements? I'm planning on making a TIV 2 to go along with it, but that's probably never gonna happen.
creations-chat 2021-09-21 13:55:57 wellÔºåoops. I can change it to just spin, with no smoke.
creations-chat 2021-09-21 13:58:45 welp, I guess I can make it a stationairy background prop.
creations-chat 2021-09-21 14:01:15 welp, back to the drawing board.

help 2021-10-27 21:06:19 like using a sign, and spamming X
help 2021-10-28 00:02:26 thx
creations-chat 2021-10-28 01:28:31 any ideas on how to make this look better? Btw, Its the skyranger from XCOM 2.
creations-chat 2021-10-28 01:31:04 This is what I'm trying to get it to look like.
creations-chat 2021-10-28 01:34:49 oh. Easy fix!
creations-chat 2021-10-28 01:38:07 also side shot with darker greys.
creations-chat 2021-10-28 01:41:14 I think that 66.66.66 might be too dark, 88.88.88 kinda seems better, idk. Why did they have to have such a long slowmode, bruh
creations-chat 2021-10-28 01:44:03 I'm sure it'll fix itself after I add the rest of the stuff. Otherwise, I think the windows may be a bit too big/too long
creations-chat 2021-10-28 01:55:47 the smokestack looks a bit oversized, but idk. (I'm not sure wether or not it's a smokestack. If you don;t know what I mean, it's the big thing just behind the ship bridge?) But the heli looks really great
creations-chat 2021-10-28 02:00:14 I honestly don't think I'm qualified to give feedback, so take this with a grain of salt.
Maybe make the radar mast look a bit more square??????
Idk
but definitely make the top rod thing look less chunky. Use the trail thing instead.
Sorry if this is super vague
creations-chat 2021-10-28 02:18:04 I thought it was the batmobile at first glance
creations-chat 2021-10-28 02:40:50 all I can say is, maybe a slightly different color scheme?
creations-chat 2021-10-28 02:43:19 the runway looks fine, but the side treads might benefit from being a different color.

plane-crazy 2022-01-04 20:03:20 I managed to fine a 3d file, and I use it all the time
plane-crazy 2022-01-04 20:03:36 but the thing I'm building doesn't really have many photos.

plane-crazy 2022-01-09 03:00:08 Idk why, but it kind of bothers me how the wheels are the same color as the chassis.
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 03:03:19 bro, I mean, it already looks pretty good, just make the wheels maybe a slightly different color.
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 03:03:28 your what now
