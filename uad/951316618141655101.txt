general 2022-07-14 13:37:43 also dont bend the mic too much the plastic coating of the wire might peel off
general 2022-07-14 13:39:56 ive had mine for probably a year and a half and the earcups are still comfortable, only complaint is that the headstrap on the top does lose its elasticity after a while and it becomes kind of useless

general 2022-07-15 20:29:47 probably your boat
general 2022-07-15 20:30:08 roblox is inherently bad at handling 20k parts all with physics at one time
general 2022-07-15 20:30:57 idk im interested to see what pc2 would be though since hopefully it shouldn't have very many coding restrictions
general 2022-07-15 20:31:02 like pc has currently
general 2022-07-15 20:31:34 im pretty sure pc was never meant to become an extremely popular game and the code proves it
general 2022-07-15 20:31:40 atleast the base code for the game
general 2022-07-15 20:32:22 i remember there were times when i was literally the only person in the entirety of plane crazy
general 2022-07-15 20:32:53 only reason i found it was because i went to his profile and looked at his games
general 2022-07-15 20:33:45 nothing
general 2022-07-15 20:33:49 literally almost no players

general 2022-07-15 20:36:27 also im pretty sure it was 2019 when that competition happened
general 2022-07-15 20:36:29 not 2018
general 2022-07-15 20:36:32 but i could be wrong
general 2022-07-15 20:37:07 i feel like im moving my perception of plane crazy more recent by a year
general 2022-07-15 20:37:39 my memory is so bad 💀
general 2022-07-15 20:38:04 i remember all these map ideas though
general 2022-07-15 20:38:09 they were cool
general 2022-07-15 20:38:17 i remember when they added the ocean biome
general 2022-07-15 20:38:23 that was the craziest update
general 2022-07-15 20:38:57 helium was an interesting update too
general 2022-07-15 20:39:02 and rope
general 2022-07-15 20:39:27 i remember when they added glass
general 2022-07-15 20:39:48 before transparent blue blocks were added as glass everything just had air in place of windows
general 2022-07-15 20:40:31 guns were in the much older versions of plane crazy
general 2022-07-15 20:40:36 oldest pvp weapon
general 2022-07-15 20:40:47 that was when pvp was completely clientsided though 💀

general 2022-07-16 11:01:48 i saw a car on the side of the road being sold for 30k
general 2022-07-16 11:01:53 it did look new though
general 2022-07-16 11:02:15 but like, why would you sell what seems to be a perfectly good car on the roadside in the middle of nowhere
general 2022-07-16 11:02:23 yes
general 2022-07-16 11:02:26 US dollars
general 2022-07-16 11:02:58 literally was sitting in the driveway with signs all over it 💀
general 2022-07-16 11:03:07 it was a cadillac SUV
general 2022-07-16 11:03:12 not sure which model exactly
general 2022-07-16 11:03:24 but it was one boat of a car
general 2022-07-16 11:04:06 there aint no way
general 2022-07-16 11:05:05 my sister bought a used kia once and it got into an accident, and on the lift the car quite literally broke in half
general 2022-07-16 11:05:37 kia 💀
general 2022-07-16 11:05:57 bad enough it broke the car frame
general 2022-07-16 11:06:04 it was down a road with a limit of 45 mph
general 2022-07-16 11:06:09 icy
general 2022-07-16 11:06:15 it happened on a downhill
general 2022-07-16 11:06:17 so probably bad
general 2022-07-16 11:06:49 yeah she was completely fine luckily
general 2022-07-16 11:07:10 still crazy how the car split in half almost perfectly down the middle
general 2022-07-16 11:07:25 front to back
general 2022-07-16 11:07:57 get in a crash and have it put on a lift
general 2022-07-16 11:08:32 maybe 💀
general 2022-07-16 11:09:16 it was repairable damage originally though that's the funny thing despite a bad accident
general 2022-07-16 11:09:30 but evidently not
general 2022-07-16 11:10:59 idek
general 2022-07-16 11:11:11 it was a somewhat cheap used car anyway though so it wasn't a huge loss
general 2022-07-16 11:12:57 sometimes i wonder how some cars you see on the road are even driving
general 2022-07-16 11:13:31 saw a car where the back end, drivers side, and front left corner was caved in
general 2022-07-16 11:13:46 still seemed to work perfectly fine despite the obvious imperfections
general 2022-07-16 11:14:28 and then the rust buckets that are being held together by hopes and prayers
general 2022-07-16 11:18:33 funny how some cars can take an insane amount of beating while also switching a couple fuses or a missing screw could completely demobilize the same car

plane-crazy 2022-07-16 16:13:26 so true
general 2022-07-16 16:20:09 its like 30 or 40
general 2022-07-16 16:20:15 and you only download like 20
general 2022-07-16 16:20:56 yes
general 2022-07-16 16:23:14 i dont like the aspect in WT with planes where if your plane "burns down" and the fire actually goes out then you die anyway
general 2022-07-16 16:24:05 happened to me in air RB
general 2022-07-16 16:24:31 pilot was fine plane was still intact albeit very much so damaged, you could still have flown it
general 2022-07-16 16:25:08 so true
general 2022-07-16 16:25:27 i just think it's death mechanics are a little too strict
general 2022-07-16 16:27:08 the one thing i despise in all of war thunder in all gamemodes of air battles
general 2022-07-16 16:27:13 plane collisions
general 2022-07-16 16:27:29 literally they make no sense
general 2022-07-16 16:28:37 it just makes no sense when you're in arcade or realistic dogfighting and two of you collide and only you instantly die while the other guy is perfectly fine
general 2022-07-16 16:29:40 happens a lot too in head on fights sometimes you hit the other guy and the other guy takes literally 0 damage
general 2022-07-16 16:30:16 arcade is funny
general 2022-07-16 16:30:19 and actually fun
general 2022-07-16 16:30:23 but not all the time
general 2022-07-16 16:30:30 i usually play realistic and sim battles
general 2022-07-16 16:30:34 moreso sim battles recently
general 2022-07-16 16:31:10 theres an american jet at like 5.3
general 2022-07-16 16:31:13 rank 4 too
general 2022-07-16 16:31:19 its a premium 💀
general 2022-07-16 16:32:14 still kind of broken to have a jet in rank 4 though
general 2022-07-16 16:34:12 i like how the premium p51-d beats out a jet
general 2022-07-16 16:34:19 at max speed
general 2022-07-16 16:35:03 it does
general 2022-07-16 16:35:10 it has a crazy climb rate too
general 2022-07-16 16:36:41 im out here in a tiny buick 💀
general 2022-07-16 16:36:47 good accel for a 3 cylinder though
general 2022-07-16 16:36:49 and speed

general 2022-07-16 16:41:19 car with 3 doors
general 2022-07-16 16:42:03 someone tell me where the door handle is though
general 2022-07-16 16:42:13 wtf

general 2022-07-18 20:05:49 the method they're using this time has been a vulnerability for 3 years now
general 2022-07-18 20:06:52 thing is though that would break all custom chats

general 2022-07-18 20:09:45 yeah but more than likely they will unterminate any accounts that had been terminated

general 2022-07-18 20:15:28 roblox may care about their money but i dont think they care that much about reputation
general 2022-07-18 20:15:32 most of their playerbase is 9
general 2022-07-18 20:15:35 who will play anything
general 2022-07-18 20:16:00 but also cannot comprehend that roblox is a bad company
general 2022-07-18 20:18:12 i dont think so it probably really is just crappy AI
general 2022-07-18 20:18:18 because you can say some words in context
general 2022-07-18 20:18:25 but other times you cant
general 2022-07-18 20:18:40 if it were just an excel spreadsheet it would ban all those words despite context
general 2022-07-18 20:19:46 if it were an excel spreadsheet it would ban all those words despite context, which is not what is observed when you can use some words and numbers in a certain context but not in another context
general 2022-07-18 20:19:59 at that point it would just be easier to make an AI rather than have a spreadsheet with every possible word and context
general 2022-07-18 20:20:00 and number
general 2022-07-18 20:21:07 its actually extremely hard to make an AI that understands context 💀
general 2022-07-18 20:22:00 not even the issue, the issue is literally just how the english language works
general 2022-07-18 20:22:43 yeah but nobody has such an AI that exists yet
general 2022-07-18 20:22:55 google search engine looks for results that have the words you used in your search term
general 2022-07-18 20:23:05 no context is used
general 2022-07-18 20:23:18 i love duck duck go
general 2022-07-18 20:24:13 thats why when you search for one thing sometimes it shows completely unrelated searches
general 2022-07-18 20:25:04 
general 2022-07-18 20:25:28 there's multiple different instruments
general 2022-07-18 20:27:19 got similar results with this search

general 2022-08-14 01:28:43 good guy
general 2022-08-14 01:28:45 man of few words
general 2022-08-14 01:28:48 i never realized he left
general 2022-08-14 01:28:57 yeah
general 2022-08-14 01:29:07 he was the guy who just gave me mod
general 2022-08-14 01:29:13 never went through an application process
general 2022-08-14 01:29:18 then i resigned <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-08-14 01:29:50 yeah i moderated
general 2022-08-14 01:29:56 for like a year or two
general 2022-08-14 01:30:02 then i resigned left and deleted my account
general 2022-08-14 01:30:04 now im back
general 2022-08-14 01:30:15 no
general 2022-08-14 01:30:35 my old account had a join pos of like 15-25 it kept changing
general 2022-08-14 01:30:40 something
general 2022-08-14 01:31:03 impossible
general 2022-08-14 01:31:44 at the time what i invented was pretty cool
general 2022-08-14 01:31:52 it is now considered simpleton technology
general 2022-08-14 01:32:41 it was an easy stabilization system to make a stable VTOL that at the time was pretty large
general 2022-08-14 01:33:08 (it really just was wing panels connected to a wishbone suspension system with jets but it worked really well compared to anything else at the time)
general 2022-08-14 01:33:47 it was just really easy to get inventor rank back when the server was in its infancy
general 2022-08-14 01:34:29 its moreso more like the "OG Member" now than an actual title of skill
general 2022-08-14 01:35:05 idk probably already done
general 2022-08-14 01:35:22 yeah
general 2022-08-14 01:35:28 as i said when the game was smaller it was much easier to get it
general 2022-08-14 01:35:32 because there was not as many people
general 2022-08-14 01:36:37 i forgot fonkl existed
general 2022-08-14 01:39:01 tie non

plane-crazy 2022-08-14 20:39:03 problem with blueprints is that due to perspective they will always be slightly off
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 20:40:50 that only minimizes it though as you said but i guess it wouldn't matter too much since you're locked to a grid of 1 block
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 20:40:57 it would be close enough

general 2022-09-13 01:25:49 what do you mean
general 2022-09-13 01:26:13 its iffy
general 2022-09-13 01:26:20 for required classes like english and like math or something
general 2022-09-13 01:26:25 yes its all 3 tris
general 2022-09-13 01:26:39 also for APs they are all 3 trimesters
general 2022-09-13 01:26:48 but for electives and stuff they only run one trimester
general 2022-09-13 01:26:53 language classes run two trimesters
general 2022-09-13 01:27:52 it really is not that hard
general 2022-09-13 01:28:28 its just a normal school year split into 1/3rds, and each 1/3rd gives me a new schedule with some new and some of the same required courses.
