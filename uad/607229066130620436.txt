creations-chat 2023-05-24 11:40:49 i need help, im new to the game (learn fast ig) and am building a ship, (frigate) i want to build a tnt ball launcher as my primary, issues are, i want it to have a big mag (all the ammo in the ship and not the turret itself, and should be transported there) and have atleast a relatively quick reload between shots, and the explosive ball propulsion aswell (magnets dont work for me, im thinking on using the suspension trick) is there any way to do this?
