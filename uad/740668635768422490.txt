plane-crazy 2021-11-23 17:59:13 I barely did either
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 17:59:24 But apparently I‚Äôm still shit
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 17:59:34 Bc
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 17:59:47 Pcc = cave man brain
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 17:59:52 Most of pcc
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:01:28 Built some of them, others are bombers, helis, or just big planes which will cause me to not sleep for the next 2 weeks.
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:01:50 And I don‚Äôt really wanna build to many more American air force jets
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:02:39 Not American air force jets <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:03:00 <:OkBuddy:652567204453154816>
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:03:33 Anything besides Chinese
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:03:48 I hate Chinese jets
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:04:45 I build Russian jets tho
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:05:18 YES <:Upvote:490311647492309004> <:Upvote:490311647492309004> <:Upvote:490311647492309004>
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:05:51 For some reason
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:05:57 They can‚Äôt be original
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:09:31 I can list all the similarities between the j-20 and sayyy the f-35
Same wings 
Similar nose 
Same cockpit
Same tail fins
Same intakes
And I‚Äôm sure many more
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:10:33 We need moter 2s that operate like lock+powered motors
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:11:46 Only for longggg noses
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:11:52 Way to complex
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:13:40 A way you can never die
To many people
Have died
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:14:05 Everyone has died at least once
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:14:22 To laggy
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:14:36 like how
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:15:33 People who use conveyor engines can abuse the shit out of that and spam it to create a bunch of sonic booms to lag the server
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:16:10 Still
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:16:18 That would give them time to slow down
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:16:22 And do it again
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:16:56 Conveyor engines
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 18:17:14 Conveyor engines are partial less

plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:04:43 Yo I just had a big brain for mech pvp
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:05:09 Anyone wanna hear ?
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:06:00 Tf is that
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:06:04 I‚Äôm stupid sorry
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:07:05 But no the idea is that it‚Äôs magnets and cutters and you connect green to disconnecters and disconnect them
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:07:20 Then toggle the magnets so they all come to the center of the opponent‚Äôs mech
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:07:46 And sense a lot of me he have ballast in the feet and legs then it can destroy the ballast
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:07:58 And the mega helium will float it up
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:08:09 Motor two swords ?
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:08:12 Lmfao
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:08:28 Dude moter 2s are two buggy
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:08:44 Max speed in a mech battle is 13
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:08:52 No I don‚Äôt
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:09:08 No I don‚Äôt lmao
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:09:24 Check my builds in creations I don‚Äôt lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:09:38 Well how long the swords
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:09:45 How long you make them?
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:10:26 Well you can‚Äôt really use them in mech battles
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:10:48 It‚Äôs gonna mess with your mobility
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:11:55 Well if your gonna try to build mechs like that i would recommend not showing it off too someone who builds mainly mechs
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:12:40 A mech battle is like 40% sword pvp and 60% other weapons
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:12:46 Depends on who you fight tho
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:13:11 What kind
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:13:16 Magnet?
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:13:29 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:13:50 Magnets screw with unpowered moters
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:13:56 If you are using any
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:14:20 So back to that topic of the random ass idea I came up with
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:14:31 Idfk if it will count as a ranged weapon or not
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:14:49 But I‚Äôve seen people use explosive blocks for mech pvp so it should be fine
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:15:42 Also it can declare a win bc of being unable to move around bc the ballast is gone
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 20:16:01 So kinda op it‚Äôs just aiming it will be the problem
plane-crazy 2022-06-19 23:16:16 Nope
general 2022-06-20 03:09:19 Yo anyone here have a mech ?

what im trying to do is make an explosive launcher and attach it to a plane and be able to shoot it from the plane, like a very fast bomb basically

plane-crazy 2023-02-17 15:30:03 ok yea
plane-crazy 2023-02-17 15:30:24 bc i saw this but i had seen it somewhere before alr

general 2023-02-17 15:33:35 yea look at the country to the very left of Chad
general 2023-02-17 15:34:46 if i was trying to make a suspension powered missle launcher for a plane, can someone help me understand how it would be executed bc ive been trying for like 2 weeks now
general 2023-02-17 15:35:23 or like any type of projectile launcher that uses suspension
general 2023-02-17 15:35:41 im sure if i tried to find a tutorial for a suspension powered missle launcher nothing would come up
general 2023-02-17 15:36:24 no like, a bomb that you can drop, just very fast
general 2023-02-17 15:36:29 and i dont wanna use an engne
general 2023-02-17 15:36:39 i wanna make it suspension powered
general 2023-02-17 15:37:08 i drop bomb and it launches out of the plane at what im aiming at,
general 2023-02-17 15:37:17 its not aiming down
general 2023-02-17 15:37:25 its aiming the direction the plane is flying
general 2023-02-17 15:37:53 ok
general 2023-02-17 15:38:02 so you know those magnet tnt shotguns people make
general 2023-02-17 15:38:14 ok
general 2023-02-17 15:38:19 its just a tnt launcher
general 2023-02-17 15:38:28 ok so take that
general 2023-02-17 15:38:29 make it small
general 2023-02-17 15:38:34 make it suspensin powered
general 2023-02-17 15:38:41 and instead of explosive balls its a bomb
general 2023-02-17 15:39:33 missle, without an engine and without a way to control it, but its shot out the plane with suspension
general 2023-02-17 15:39:35 exactly
general 2023-02-17 15:39:49 f
general 2023-02-17 15:40:28 bro no ive literally done this before its just buggy
general 2023-02-17 15:40:56 how?
general 2023-02-17 15:41:37 yea but its length 1 strength 100
general 2023-02-17 15:41:43 and with i let go of the missle
general 2023-02-17 15:41:49 the suspension retracts
general 2023-02-17 15:41:56 and shoots the projectile
general 2023-02-17 15:42:25 ill eat one
general 2023-02-17 15:42:28 which book
general 2023-02-17 15:42:50 ok

general 2023-02-17 15:55:18 alr
general 2023-02-17 15:56:14 ima about to make my suspension gun but i came up with an acronym bc why not lol, but im just realising how terrible i am at aiming bombs, so i can just angle the gun down and instantly blow someone up lol
general 2023-02-17 15:56:26 i forgot who said it but thank you for the idea
general 2023-02-17 15:57:00 bro i dont understand how shredders are so bad
general 2023-02-17 15:57:49 i did the same thing where i built one just to see why people like it so much, and why using it a shredder army of like 40-50 bugs came and attacked me and my singular tutorial bug killed all of them,
general 2023-02-17 15:58:01 this is why i think every shredder user is actually braindead

general 2023-02-17 16:01:01 i feel like getting hit by a tank that was shot out of a cannon at the mach 1 would suprise them more than just getting blown up
general 2023-02-17 16:01:03 just saying
general 2023-02-17 16:01:58 what would you say is an anti ship missle
general 2023-02-17 16:02:13 like ive never heard of an anti ship missle
general 2023-02-17 16:02:28 is that just like a really fast 150 bomb
general 2023-02-17 16:03:14 so you see, if you shoot that 150 bomb out of a suspension powered turret
general 2023-02-17 16:03:42 perhaps a suspension powered unguided explosive launcher?
general 2023-02-17 16:04:08 put it on a plane
general 2023-02-17 16:04:09 e
general 2023-02-17 16:04:10 z
general 2023-02-17 16:04:32 yea but you can move
general 2023-02-17 16:05:06 its just a plane but one extra keybind to shoot the missle
general 2023-02-17 16:05:26 the tnt railgun?
general 2023-02-17 16:10:28 but as i was saying
general 2023-02-17 16:10:29 so much easier
general 2023-02-17 16:10:29 why cant you just fling the nuke at someone angry birds style
general 2023-02-17 16:11:11 orrrrrrr a suspension powered unguided explosive launcher
general 2023-02-17 16:11:23 lol
general 2023-02-17 16:11:30 tf
general 2023-02-17 16:11:42 bro accidently got caught hacking
general 2023-02-17 16:12:58 just put a modernized angry birds sling shot on a jet and instead of talking sociopathic birds, its just a nuke
general 2023-02-17 16:13:21 ive been trying to develop this for like 2 weeks
general 2023-02-17 16:13:26 i have it all planned
general 2023-02-17 16:13:35 but idk why i never get it to work
general 2023-02-17 16:13:41 lol
general 2023-02-17 16:13:45 launching boats at people
general 2023-02-17 16:13:52 or tanks
general 2023-02-17 16:14:47 but yea ive been trying to develop a suspension powered explosive launcher
general 2023-02-17 16:14:51 for like 2 weeks
general 2023-02-17 16:14:56 and im so close to being able to do it
general 2023-02-17 16:15:17 ive gone through like 3 verisons and only the first two actually worked
general 2023-02-17 16:15:26 yea
general 2023-02-17 16:15:31 probably
general 2023-02-17 16:16:51 The S.P.U.E.L. Gun (pronounced spool)
S.P.U.E.L. stands for Suspension Powered Unguided Explosive Launcher
general 2023-02-17 16:17:37 it uses springs and motors to shoot a nuke so fast it breaks the sound barrier why use guided missles when you can just throw a ballistic missile at someone
general 2023-02-17 16:29:24 ok so im basically doing what gjsolo did with his tnt cannon but instead of magnets its a shit ton of suspension
general 2023-02-17 16:29:33 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU3EXhBm1pI
general 2023-02-17 16:29:37 f
general 2023-02-17 16:29:49 i gotta get my concept design first tho
general 2023-02-17 16:30:01 that was phase two of the spuel gun tho
general 2023-02-17 16:30:49 from what ive seen very few people have publically made what im doing
general 2023-02-17 16:31:04 like Prototrobe
general 2023-02-17 16:31:21 im pretty sure made an suspension gun that shoots explosives
general 2023-02-17 16:31:50 but thats not cool enough
general 2023-02-17 16:32:09 its to low effort
general 2023-02-17 16:32:30 ok
general 2023-02-17 16:32:32 i would do that
general 2023-02-17 16:32:37 but its rocket engines
general 2023-02-17 16:32:53 lol
general 2023-02-17 16:33:00 yooooooooo
general 2023-02-17 16:33:11 instead of shooting a bomb
general 2023-02-17 16:33:16 with suspension
general 2023-02-17 16:33:20 ima shoot a shredder bug
general 2023-02-17 16:33:24 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
general 2023-02-17 16:33:50 nah fr tho
general 2023-02-17 16:33:56 when i get the chance
general 2023-02-17 16:34:04 the first thing im doing is getting on pc and building this
general 2023-02-17 16:35:25 from what ive seen only like 2-3 other people have made this
general 2023-02-17 16:35:35 and like
general 2023-02-17 16:35:39 publically showed it
general 2023-02-17 16:35:56 like posted on youtube or posted about in here
general 2023-02-17 16:37:38 oooooooooooo hold up i thought of another type of explosive weaponry
general 2023-02-17 16:38:03 ima make a burst cannon that uses functioning rounds to shoot explosive balls
general 2023-02-17 16:38:50 yooooo hold up
general 2023-02-17 16:38:53 thinking about it
general 2023-02-17 16:38:57 that would work
general 2023-02-17 16:38:59 yo hold up
general 2023-02-17 16:39:28 it would just be really chunky
general 2023-02-17 16:39:54 the bullet casing would hold maybe like 5 explosive balls, and at the end of the casing is a magnet that launches the balls
general 2023-02-17 16:39:59 then it goes to the next bullet
general 2023-02-17 16:40:04 ok
general 2023-02-17 16:40:08 so anyhow
general 2023-02-17 16:40:13 i think it would actually work
general 2023-02-17 16:40:25 i just might need to make the casing really smol
general 2023-02-17 19:59:51 alr so as i was saying 3 hours ago
general 2023-02-17 20:00:19 can someone help me to get an idea of how to make my suspension gun
general 2023-02-17 20:00:48 ' - '
general 2023-02-17 20:01:10 i unironically read that in the nerd voice before seeing the nerd emoji
help 2023-02-17 20:01:33 can someone help me to get an idea of how to make my suspension gun
general 2023-02-20 20:18:03 i kinda wanna make something no body has done before but its very difficult
general 2023-02-20 20:18:25 ive been getting into making suspension
general 2023-02-20 20:18:29 but im not very good at it
general 2023-02-20 20:19:09 then theres unique weapons
general 2023-02-20 20:19:13 but someones made those
general 2023-02-20 20:19:36 i have been trying to make my own custom suspension tho and its been going pretty well
general 2023-02-20 20:20:05 someones probably made it
general 2023-02-20 20:20:09 just not publically
general 2023-02-20 20:20:53 well something unique, that isnt a plane
general 2023-02-20 20:21:01 like just something cool
general 2023-02-20 20:21:25 i kinda wanna try custom suspension but people have done better and it probably wont be very cool compared to other stuff
general 2023-02-20 20:22:21 i could probably get a away with a suspension gun
general 2023-02-20 20:22:25 bc nobody makes them
general 2023-02-20 20:22:43 ik but still
general 2023-02-20 20:22:49 barely anyone makes suspension guns
general 2023-02-20 20:23:06 he used magnets
general 2023-02-20 20:25:29 this entire rant about making something original was just another excuse to mention i made the Spuel gun version 5
general 2023-02-20 20:25:53 i finished the spuel gun v5
general 2023-02-20 20:26:49 soon im going to make version 6 which i can attach to a plane and it will be powerful enough but compact enough to fire out of the plane
general 2023-02-20 20:27:35 Spuel Gun Version 6 will also use a more compact design
general 2023-02-20 20:28:02 and it will be compact and diverse enough to be attacted to a plane boat or a tank
general 2023-02-20 20:28:41 it will also be a lighter weight design
general 2023-02-20 20:36:12 guys, engines on missles is propaganda <:bruhaps:646045387911725106>
general 2023-02-20 20:36:16 just angry bird that shit
general 2023-02-20 20:36:24 just fling it
general 2023-02-20 20:37:52 guys what if someone made a dropable bomb, but instead of just dropping it they used suspension to launch the bomb
general 2023-02-20 20:38:45 bros in the country to the left of Chad
general 2023-02-21 15:37:57 GUYS
general 2023-02-21 15:38:03 ok i know nobody cares at all
general 2023-02-21 15:38:17 damn
general 2023-02-21 15:38:26 . _ .
general 2023-02-21 15:38:44 dam
general 2023-02-21 15:40:00 yea i just didnt wanna be a white name anymore, i could probably get a better rank because my current builds but it just seems unneeded
general 2023-02-21 15:40:51 but as i was saying, i finally found something original to build
general 2023-02-21 15:41:15 dude what the hell did i do to you
general 2023-02-21 15:41:21 i dont get what you gain by saying that
general 2023-02-21 15:41:29 please elaborate
general 2023-02-21 15:42:41 alr ima just ignore this dude
general 2023-02-21 15:42:59 alr so from what ive seen nobody has publically built a F-16 Vista
general 2023-02-21 15:43:20 which is just a funi f-16 with thrust vectoring
general 2023-02-21 15:44:18 you're not gonna stop me from trying
general 2023-02-21 15:44:44 once again
general 2023-02-21 15:44:49 you wont stop me from trying
general 2023-02-21 15:44:54 like im still gonna try to do it
general 2023-02-21 15:46:21 like people have made thrust vectoring with single engine jets in real life idk what you mean it isnt how that works
general 2023-02-21 15:47:31 i know
general 2023-02-21 15:47:54 explain how people made it then
general 2023-02-21 15:47:58 x-31
general 2023-02-21 15:48:01 f-16 vista
general 2023-02-21 15:49:23 exactly
general 2023-02-21 15:49:42 there is literally a video online of a the f-16 vista doing a cobra
general 2023-02-21 15:53:46 this is one of those times that i really like the plane crazy community
general 2023-02-21 15:54:32 yes
general 2023-02-21 15:54:37 forgor to mention
general 2023-02-21 15:54:46 based
general 2023-02-21 15:55:56 btw on that exact wiki page about thrust vectoring theres a gif showing a **single engine** thrust vectoring missle https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gimbaled_thrust_animation.gif
general 2023-02-21 15:56:42 niceee
general 2023-02-21 15:57:23 i love how all of this started because <@456226577798135808> decided to be annoying for no reason
general 2023-02-21 15:58:10 bro is chatgpt
general 2023-02-21 16:03:45 cet

general 2023-02-21 20:55:41 ye
general 2023-02-21 20:55:51 Did you know Queen Elizabeth II is a trained mechanic.
general 2023-02-22 15:33:45 hlo
general 2023-02-22 15:34:13 damn
general 2023-02-22 15:34:23 oh god its the braindead bacon who doesnt understand thrust vectoring
general 2023-02-22 15:34:25 ok there we go
general 2023-02-22 15:34:41 no?
general 2023-02-22 15:34:47 yea
general 2023-02-22 15:35:07 he was pissing himself because i wanted to make a f-16 varient that had thrust vectoring
general 2023-02-22 15:35:19 and he went on a rant on how single engine thrust vectoring isnt possible
general 2023-02-22 15:35:41 that doesnt mean i wont try
general 2023-02-22 15:35:56 thats mostly what im trying to do
general 2023-02-22 15:36:04 yea basically
general 2023-02-22 15:36:11 i wanna not be able to control anything
general 2023-02-22 15:36:33 i wanna aim straight up and the jet to a death spin downward
general 2023-02-22 15:36:56 then dont respond
general 2023-02-22 15:37:00 stop giving it attention
general 2023-02-22 15:37:05 your showing me that you care

general 2023-02-22 15:37:55 NOOOOOO
general 2023-02-22 15:38:01 i have to actually try to get a rank
general 2023-02-22 15:38:03 big sad
general 2023-02-22 15:38:35 the only reason i even have aeronautics 2 is bc i didnt wanna be a white name
general 2023-02-22 15:39:52 like im probably good on a few 3-4 level ranks but im to lazy to submit the thingy
general 2023-02-22 15:40:34 ik i can get expert im literally just to lazy to take screenshots of everything and type a whole ass essay to get a role
general 2023-02-22 15:40:45 and if i want multiple ranks i have to do it alot
general 2023-02-22 15:41:03 but ima probs do it today bc i want image perms
general 2023-02-22 15:42:08 ngay
general 2023-02-22 15:43:21 bro dont you just love spending 3 hours on a fighter jet with like an massive amount of motor lock, then you save it and its like 5 blocks
general 2023-02-22 15:44:23 and mechagodzillas that look goofy as hell
general 2023-02-22 15:53:02 my most upvoted build in creations is a hamburger

general 2023-02-22 15:54:07 that was a while ago tho
general 2023-02-22 15:54:12 ive made alot more better builds
general 2023-02-22 15:54:16 which is debatable
general 2023-02-22 15:54:23 but compared to my old builds very much
general 2023-02-22 15:54:31 +hambur
general 2023-02-22 15:54:46 also ik they overated
general 2023-02-22 15:54:55 which is why im moving away from motor lock jets
general 2023-02-22 15:55:01 im building other stuff
general 2023-02-22 15:55:08 i didnt say my new jets are good
general 2023-02-22 15:55:11 i said my new builds
general 2023-02-22 15:55:27 valid
general 2023-02-22 15:55:37 isa da homies
general 2023-02-22 15:55:58 an airliner is a jet
general 2023-02-22 15:56:08 you just said motor lock jets are overrated
general 2023-02-22 15:56:20 a plane is like
general 2023-02-22 15:56:22 propellers
general 2023-02-22 15:56:27 a jet is like

general 2023-02-23 15:47:47 i finally made a suspension gun
general 2023-02-23 15:47:49 that functions

general 2023-02-23 16:12:36 bro why do the su-27 su-30 su-33 and su-35 all look the same
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:14:56 bro why do the su-27 su-30 su-33 and su-35 all look the same
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:15:21 that missle launch was nice
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:31:04 move the back where the tail wings are more up
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:31:26 make it like half a block instead of 2
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:31:56 i think
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:31:57 it is
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:31:59 because
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:32:08 that would be more accurate
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:32:27 or change the angle on the back part of the wing
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:33:18 bro
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:33:36 make the angle
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:33:41 more
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:33:42 yea
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:35:30 bro
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:35:37 you need to make the end of the angled bit
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:35:50 closer to the thing that the tail is mounted on
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:36:01 so the end of the wings are wider
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:36:11 how buy
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:36:12 tell me
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:36:13 where
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:36:14 to buy
general 2023-02-23 16:38:23 me waiting for someone to make a r9x ninja missle guy

creations-chat 2023-04-09 16:58:03 I honestly prefer trapdoors bc they are better for smaller builds but for a larger scale build such as this just use disconnectors because trying to paint that will be actual hell because of how many there are

plane-crazy 2023-04-17 14:31:09 Yo guys what‚Äôs a good helicopter that doesn‚Äôt have absolutely hideous angles which are nearly impossible to make without heavy locking
creations-chat 2023-04-19 02:52:15 yo guys i thought of a concept and i am currently building it and its basically just a flying fucking box with a shit load of different weapons, (deployable tanks, planes, missiles, bombs, recon drones, gun drones etc,) that acts as a fortress in the sky and i need a name for it

if you want to know the details of the weaponry for fun

4 planes
6 tanks
4 guided heavy bombs
6 guided light missiles
1 recon drone
1 gunner drone
4 turrets (2 guns each)
and some other fun stuff
creations-chat 2023-04-19 02:54:39 its not done its just a funky frame atm but im gonna make the outside not look like a box
it will atleast have a bit of detail
yea gimmi a minute
creations-chat 2023-04-19 02:57:46 the thing with rocket engines on the edges is the funny spinny bit that makes it fly
its very ugly atm but still it will (hopefully) look nice in the end
ima add the aa in the end and im planning on fixing the planes bc rn they are just starter tutorial planes with a rocket engine and missiles
creations-chat 2023-04-19 03:00:24 and the problem with helium is that when something  like a plane or tank is deployed it gets lighter and floats up a bit

also speaking of tanks im thinking like one of those doors that drop down over a moat that you see in castles and the tanks would have little mini gliders that glide them to the base

the fortress thing itself will act as a space station/satilite thing

true
creations-chat 2023-04-19 03:02:49 theres some empty space below the drone area, missiles, and tank parts so that where im gonna add all the mechanical stuff

or make the whole thing taller in general
creations-chat 2023-04-19 03:08:35 I wish people actually explained why a build is trash because a lot of the time it‚Äôs not at all
general 2023-04-19 03:13:51 I‚Äôve been on a mission for any expert rank and I have a qualified build for terrain expert but I‚Äôm to lazy to take screenshots of the build and post it and submit the build and wait 7 months for a response

thank you for my daily reminder that i will never be good at plane crazy
creations-chat 2023-05-01 14:04:09 helium in the arms and torso and ballast in the back which helps stabilize it when walking in flying, you also need perfect rocket and wing panel placement if you want it to fly straight i dont make walking mechs anymore tho since i usually build pvp mechs but
creations-chat 2023-05-01 14:06:12 just if your mech is to dense and you need extra helium but it works
general 2023-05-01 20:40:08 does anyone have a design for automatic flares, like the flares in wt where im not restricted to individual keybinds. ive been experimenting and i cant seem to get the design for it correct
(and still have it compact)

plane-crazy 2023-05-09 04:54:03 i usually use my left alt key as an anchor for literally every build that i have that uses an anchor and alt randomly stopped working

plane-crazy 2023-05-16 15:48:12 i can get it but taking screenshots is to much work

plane-crazy 2023-05-16 15:51:45 so yea

plane-crazy 2023-05-16 15:52:44 i am slow
plane-crazy 2023-05-16 15:53:32 yea
general 2023-05-24 15:35:47 guys random question, favorite tank, armored vehicle, or anti-tank vehicle, etc.
plane-crazy 2023-05-24 15:42:26 i wanna try and make a really compact, like 1x1 drone that you can mount into a tank and deploy for recon, kinda like how warthunder has drones, but instead of them flying like a plane it wold just be a generic drone
plane-crazy 2023-05-24 15:42:34 or like 3x3 at max
plane-crazy 2023-05-24 15:43:18 i also have another concept which is an anti tank bomb that deploys from the underside of a tank and rolls under enemy tanks and explodes from the middle
plane-crazy 2023-05-24 15:47:28 i also have a thing for anti missiles that deploys a bunch of decoy blocks that draw the missile away  from the tank
plane-crazy 2023-05-24 15:55:25 turn the stiffness down?
