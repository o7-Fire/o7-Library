creations-chat 2022-07-26 04:16:54 Oh and the fantail doesn't have that weird angle that you're doing with the half wedges there

Oh and you should put another layer of thr railings behind the other layer so it'd visible from both sides
creations-chat 2022-07-26 04:19:17 See, it's flat at the back so that the aircraft can be rolled out of the hanger
The little angling going on back there is what I'm talking about
creations-chat 2022-07-26 04:21:54 Alright, but you should put another sign with the railing on the backside of the other rails so it can be seen from both sides
