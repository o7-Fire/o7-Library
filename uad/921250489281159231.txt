creations-chat 2022-01-14 15:54:41 <@!487056388451729418> dude how did you get the afterburners on that Mig-25?
creations-chat 2022-01-14 15:58:05 I like the bow and the superstructure but I think it would look pretty cool if you make it like a destroyer escort like the John C butler class

plane-crazy 2022-01-14 16:46:55 hi
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 16:47:26 make it a T-44 because T-44s are cooler than T-34s
bot-central 2022-01-14 16:49:28 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 16:53:04 I know T-44s are less popular but the T-44 just looks cooler
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 16:54:55 BT-5 and BT-7 are mini chads'
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 16:55:18 yeah but T-44 looks better than T-34
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 16:55:37 T-100 is kinda lame with the two turrets
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 16:55:44 KV-5 and 4 are chads
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 16:55:50 looks very nice
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:05:21 super structure is great but a little boxy, make it smaller at one end
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:24:28 looks very good, hopefully you can add those spherical radar holds

creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:27:06 dang shipwright is really easy to get, I have like 8 ships that all fit into the categories
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:30:15 the paint job is horrible, the turrets are decent, but I think that this thing can do very well in PVP. | wait it's decorative? legit thought the turrets held like 4 missiles each | shows that the paint job is so bad that I can't even see if it clearly has PVP stuff lol
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:35:43 how do you guys do the stacking sentences? like making it all stack vertically <@!739369649971527720> camo is really nice, though the turrets are kinda lacking *and the bow
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:42:29 how's my kamoz Ka-41? 
I'm trying to make it like an osprey + Mi-24 but I'm having problems with the painting and balancing because I don't know what camo I should use
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:51:30 can someone send me a pic of thatHornet?  
Hornet looks good and better than what I could make but not enough for HoF
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:55:06 Is my camo for my helicopter good?
I'm not good with camos at all
<@!714878625484243101> alright
<@!725358947904651335> I'm going for a Mi-24 style of camo
creations-chat 2022-01-14 17:58:01 something that looks like this <@!725358947904651335> It's my first time doing this camo and I don't typically paint my creations
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:01:06 looks real nice, if you're adding turrets what would it be? I'm thinking of Fletcher class style of turrets
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:05:30 is this considered overlocking? because I think it is
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:10:31 I mean this is how big my helicopter is
forgot to send the picture
general 2022-01-14 18:12:13 uh guys
general 2022-01-14 18:12:21 My GPU is at 74C with minimum graphics
general 2022-01-14 18:12:26 that isn't good
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:13:06 so here's my helicopter
I don't know if something this big would be considered over locking
general 2022-01-14 18:13:54 😦
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:15:42 I think it could be an issue because then, you take up more space for motor towers and cause more lag for something that can be achieve with less blocks
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:19:01 ayo I was just testing my helicopter's controls and one guy joined and had a big ghost galleon
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:22:11 is it possible for you to make it like this?
like Fletcher class style of turrets
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:28:31 you can
you just copy the base of the turret like 20 blocks upwards and find a way to make it move to the middle
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:37:36 looks really nice, can I see what you're best build is right now? <@!469528043850039296> same bro
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:53:45 epic
creations-chat 2022-01-14 18:57:38 Looks epic
also, PERRY THE PLATYPUS?!?!??!?!?!?!?
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:35:05 how do I lower GPU temperature when building?
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:35:20 I'm at minimum graphics and it's already hovering at 78C
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:35:59 yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:36:18 <@!765983880032682054> ayo that ship looks nice
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:36:23 but I just got this new PC
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:36:28 it has mid range everything...
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:36:40 my only idea to cool it right now is to point a fan at the lower intake
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:37:12 highly doubt it's dust
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:37:18 I got it in december
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:37:24 and I just cleaned the vents and fan
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:38:17 how do I check the speed of the heat sink?
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:38:29 I don't have any thermal paste and the PC comes with thermal paste I believe
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:38:35 so adding anymore won't help right now
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:38:47 PC is getting fresh air
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:39:22 is my idea of pointing a fan at the lower vent a good idea?
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:39:50 because it makes the cold air move to the lower vent
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:40:02 and since hot air is lighter than cold air, it pushes the hot air out the top vent
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:40:32 NOOO NOT THE KFIR
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:40:56 but my PC uses the spiral kind of heatsink
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:41:03 and a PC fan directly above the heatsink
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:41:19 I'm in a private server
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:41:25 so that won't work
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:42:04 
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:42:17 nobody is doing anything

creations-chat 2022-01-15 00:15:43 the one block wide part is the minigun hold and yeah it looks bad
creations-chat 2022-01-15 00:18:20 it was supposed to be the F variant and I made the nose a bit short 😦
I'm trying to look at it right now but roblox keeps making me disconnect every 5 minutes
creations-chat 2022-01-15 00:21:14 here's the nose at another angle
I want to but I can't because internet is breaking
also I think I found out why it's so short because I made it a year ago and wanted it to be 1:1 scale
creations-chat 2022-01-15 00:24:33 I don';t think I can even do that without causing more exposed locks, the ones in the air intake are for the angle of the wings
my phantom is essentially spaghetti code now
help 2022-01-15 00:25:33 uh oh
creations-chat 2022-01-15 00:39:18 what's that

plane-crazy 2022-01-15 04:25:56 I'm trying to do a basic white and grayish-blue stripe pattern
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 04:26:40 looks kinda boring though
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 04:27:02 I'm trying to follow this style of camo
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 04:27:09 but skinnier
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 04:28:16 that was my first camo attempt but it failed
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 04:28:24 so can you give me like a little tutorial on what to do?
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 04:29:06 alright
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 04:53:20 how's my light cruiser?

plane-crazy 2022-01-15 04:54:10 looks nice\
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 04:54:23 looks great
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 15:35:46 looks nice
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 15:36:45 you'd need to make it like 2x bigger though
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 15:36:53 hull is good but size is bad
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 15:37:11 oh
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 15:37:21 the proportions are right
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 15:37:29 so no need to change anything
creations-chat 2022-01-15 15:44:46 WHY DOES MY PBY GET BETTER LIKES/DISLIKE RATIO THAN MY KA-41?
I MADE THE PBY 2 YEARS AGO WITH LIKE 2 MOTORS FOR MOTOR LOCK
creations-chat 2022-01-15 15:48:18 no wonder why, they dislike every average builds but like good builds with almost no dislikes

average builds always get a 1/3 like to dislike ratio while good builds have 80/1 like to dislike ratio
creations-chat 2022-01-15 15:58:31 I figured it was the paint but I can't do good camos for some reason
creations-chat 2022-01-15 16:03:55 what is it

plane-crazy 2022-01-15 16:54:12 WAIT
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 16:54:16 I THINK I KNOW WHY IT'S SO HOT
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 16:54:23 IT DOESN'T HAVE A LOWER VENT FAN
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 16:54:29 IT ONLY HAS A UPPER VENT FAN
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 16:54:33 SO IT CAN'T PUSH IN COLD AIR
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 16:54:37 I NEED TO GET A FAN FAST
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 16:54:45 I'm big brain
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 17:08:48 how's my light cruiser?
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 17:08:53 every single turret is controllable
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 17:08:59 even the crane and catapult for the plane
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 17:09:19 even the torpedoes can be controlled by left and right side

plane-crazy 2022-01-15 17:21:11 and now I have to rebuild it
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 17:21:24 and don't look at the right side

general 2022-01-15 17:26:51 guys
general 2022-01-15 17:26:58 I found out my PC doesn't have two fans
general 2022-01-15 17:27:01 it only has one exhaust fan
general 2022-01-15 17:27:04 what do I do?
general 2022-01-15 17:27:19 not sure though
general 2022-01-15 17:27:25 I got an idea that probably is way cheaper
general 2022-01-15 17:27:37 it's spinning
general 2022-01-15 17:28:01 I think why my GPU is so hot is that there's not enough cool air being pushed in the PC
general 2022-01-15 17:28:22 so I think the cheapest way is to just get a desk fan and point it at the lower vent
general 2022-01-15 17:28:26 where the fan is missing
general 2022-01-15 17:28:35 all of the things you told me are already done
general 2022-01-15 17:28:59 can't

creations-chat 2022-01-16 04:10:03 well it has more detail than my ship lol
general 2022-01-16 04:34:47 I don't get how you guys eat tomatoes on burgers thinking it tastes good
general 2022-01-16 04:35:02 tomatoes are sweet and cold, something that doesn't fit with a burger at all
general 2022-01-16 04:36:34 HOW
general 2022-01-16 04:36:43 THE TOMATO IS SWEET AND PUNGENT
general 2022-01-16 04:37:01 IT DOESN'T FIT ON A BURGER BECAUSE A BURGER HAS A VERY MEATY AND LESS PUNGENT FLAVOURS
general 2022-01-16 04:37:18 ONIONS AND LETTUCE ARE THE ONLY VEGATABLES THAT CAN GO WITH A BURGER
general 2022-01-16 04:38:08 TOMATOES CAN'T FIT IN A BURGER BECAUSE IT'S LIKE ADDING ANCHOVIES ON PIZZA
general 2022-01-16 04:38:11 THEY DON'T FIT TOGETHER
general 2022-01-16 04:38:21 THE FLAVOURS ARE ALL DIFFERENT
general 2022-01-16 04:38:25 true
general 2022-01-16 04:38:36 BUT TOMATO IS SO DIFFERENT
general 2022-01-16 04:38:40 THAT IT DOESN'T TASTE GOOD
general 2022-01-16 04:38:59 I DON'T LIKE PICKLES EITHER
general 2022-01-16 04:39:10 I DISSAMBLE THE BURGER AND TAKE OUT THE PICKLES
general 2022-01-16 04:39:15 AND THEN I PUT IN THE FRIES AND NUGGETS
general 2022-01-16 04:39:23 I know
general 2022-01-16 04:39:27 I TAKE OUT THE TOMATO FROM THE BURGER
general 2022-01-16 04:39:33 ME
general 2022-01-16 04:39:39 BECAUSE THE FRY FITS THE BURGER
general 2022-01-16 04:39:55 POTATOES FIT ON THE BURGER
general 2022-01-16 04:40:16 THE NUGGETS ADD FLAVOUR IF THE BURGER IS TASTLESS
general 2022-01-16 04:40:20 WHICH IS SCHOOL BURGERS
general 2022-01-16 04:40:38 opinion approved ✅
general 2022-01-16 04:40:43 NO
general 2022-01-16 04:40:53 SCHOOL GIVES ME FOOD FOR LUNCH EVERYDAY
general 2022-01-16 04:41:01 I DON'T EAT FAST FOOD
general 2022-01-16 04:41:06 I EAT IT LIKE 1X EVERY MONTH
general 2022-01-16 04:41:12 YES
general 2022-01-16 04:41:30 I GO TO KFC
general 2022-01-16 04:41:41 THEIR MASH POTATOES AND GRAVY ARE BETTER THAN THE ACTUAL CHICKEN
general 2022-01-16 04:41:58 finally
general 2022-01-16 04:42:03 yes
general 2022-01-16 04:42:17 KFC mash potatoes, gravy, and french fries are the real show
general 2022-01-16 04:43:32 ok guys
general 2022-01-16 04:43:37 I'm gonna do a hot take
general 2022-01-16 04:43:44 In-N-Out is overrated as heck
general 2022-01-16 04:43:57 when I went to california and nevada
general 2022-01-16 04:44:01 I got the burgers
general 2022-01-16 04:44:05 AND GUESS WHAT?
general 2022-01-16 04:44:11 THEY MADE THE BURGERS CRISPY
general 2022-01-16 04:44:15 WHO LIKES CRISPY BURGERS?
general 2022-01-16 04:44:22 I COULDN'T EVEN TASTE THE MEAT
general 2022-01-16 04:44:34 I ONLY TASTED THE ONIONS AND TOMATOES
general 2022-01-16 04:45:33 Filet-O-Fish is underrated
general 2022-01-16 04:45:56 yeah but the fish makes it taste different in a good way
general 2022-01-16 04:46:07 the tartar sauce is good too
general 2022-01-16 04:46:21 there's beef and chicken
general 2022-01-16 04:46:23 but nobody uses fish
general 2022-01-16 04:46:26 same
general 2022-01-16 04:46:32 I only tried the beyond whopper but I liked it
general 2022-01-16 04:48:50 basically it came from tomatoes should not belong on burgers
general 2022-01-16 04:49:06 and then it went to KFC mash potatoes and gravy tasting better than the chicken
general 2022-01-16 04:49:15 and then soundwave decided to be funny and ruin the entire thing
general 2022-01-16 04:49:29 yeah
general 2022-01-16 04:49:32 In N Out sucks
general 2022-01-16 04:49:37 their burgers tasted horrible
general 2022-01-16 04:50:53 diced onions or onion ring on burger?
general 2022-01-16 04:51:09 no
general 2022-01-16 04:51:17 diced onions are the best on burgers

general 2022-01-16 05:00:36 and being confused because it went like 2 FPS
general 2022-01-16 05:00:43 there goes 7 bucks down the drain
general 2022-01-16 05:00:58 even with my new PC it still causes the GPU to go to 100C
general 2022-01-16 05:01:01 which is not good at all

plane-crazy 2022-01-22 02:52:48 that's what most people would care about if you cannot do internal detail
creations-chat 2022-01-22 02:53:26 dang... if you left the server when you delete it, it wouldn't work
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 02:54:28 good luck on the curves

plane-crazy 2022-01-22 16:52:04 7 is the cap for hover engines per piston
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 16:59:01 I don't think so
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 16:59:09 I think it just goes the same speed
creations-chat 2022-01-22 17:00:22 looks good, also any thoughts on the propellers and rudder?https://streamable.com/194d7d
should there be more propellers or more angle to the rudders?

plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:47:42 how's the AA gun view?
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:47:49 if you play the M13
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:47:54 you can kill most tanks at that BR
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:47:58 did that a few times
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:48:01 and got like 4 kills each time
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:49:06 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:49:10 it's not like WoT
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:49:17 don't do the same rookie mistake I did
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:49:25 where I tried to research the M10
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:49:31 but I thought I needed to play the M2A2
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:49:34 to research it
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:49:39 yeah lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:49:46 nah nah

plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:54:04 
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:54:13 it just tells you how far away something is
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:54:18 if it's 500m
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:54:23 that means it's 500 meters away
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:54:28 you can get a setting
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:54:34 where it sets up the gun value
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:54:43 you can do that manually
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:54:58 I usually make it [ for it to go up and ] for the gun to go down
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:55:07 I think it's in the settings > controls
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:55:20 at the cost of having to play with controllers
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 17:55:40 but 30 frames cap B)

<@!622607246257422356> what's a general photo?
creations-chat 2022-01-23 04:20:37 I really like these battles that I make with microsoft paint
So I got an idea of making something like a big explosion when the ammo rack explodes in paint 3d.
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 04:21:27 is this good?
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 04:22:08 I know but the thing is
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 04:22:14 I can't do 3d stuff in paint 3d
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 04:22:18 even if there is 3d in the name
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 04:22:24 yeah I know 😦
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 04:22:32 I wanted to add flaming oil but I just can't
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 04:23:13 I'm gonna try to make a hood style of explosion
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 04:23:18 or like two torpedo boats going zoom
creations-chat 2022-01-23 04:27:04 yes B)
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 04:32:06 unless it's for <#384025409945337856> then it is not cring
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 04:35:01 dude it said it was spam lol

creations-chat 2022-01-23 04:51:59 man my Paint 3D editing grind is just top notch B)
creations-chat 2022-01-23 05:13:05 I think you should add like a big air intake ontop of the hood
creations-chat 2022-01-23 05:19:17 oh, probably to the side at like an angle above the wheels
creations-chat 2022-01-23 15:46:39 I suck at making plane pictures lol
I'm gonna stick with warships sinking with the boom and flames

<@456226577798135808> I know but the plane is pretty much lost because that was when I made motor lock planes pretty bad.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 16:07:36 I'm sure you can see it clearly
creations-chat 2022-01-23 16:11:55 I'll try but I only use paint 3d and I don't think I can reverse much of it
really only the missiles and the text
I can reverse the filters and I'll try to reverse and revise it
creations-chat 2022-01-23 16:17:25 I'll try to reverse the jets in around an hour
creations-chat 2022-01-23 16:22:40 looks great
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:25:56 how's this bird's eye view?
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:32:58 I had to use the crayon option in paint 3d and I can't do straight lines with the crayon option lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:33:23 that's the thing
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:33:29 I can't use the crayon option with line too
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:33:31 tool*
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:34:15 but the crayon has the best looks for shell tracers
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:38:06 yeah?
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:39:23 really?
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:40:04 probably just how the crayon works
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:40:11 like you make a line
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:40:14 that's kinda straight
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:40:24 and just stop and hold left click for like 5 seconds?
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:40:51 it's not working 😦
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:43:46 
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:43:52 ignore this
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:46:12 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:46:22 I did that once on my dad's note 10+ too
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 16:46:32 fits that my name is sam B)
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:10:45 back
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:12:53 alright
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:12:59 I'm having a problem
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:13:11 like I added an extra fan to act as an air intake
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:13:21 but there aren't any fan cable slots
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:13:33 there's only two, one for the CPU and one for the exhaust fan
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:13:43 so I had to connect the new fan to the exhaust fan slot
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:13:44 like
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:13:47 I took out the wires
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:13:51 and put them all in the slots
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:14:02 so imagine 6 wires connecting to a 3 wire fan slot
creations-chat 2022-01-23 17:19:46 HOW THE HECK DO I MAKE GOOD PHOTO ANGLES OF SHIPS SINKING
creations-chat 2022-01-23 17:22:10 no I mean like ships splitting and exploding and stuff
not like ships that are already sunk
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:48:00 is this a decent map?
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:49:53 no dude
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:49:57 this isn't a plane crazy map
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:50:10 this is for a setting for my plane crazy ships and stuff
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:51:10 well does it look good?
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:51:43 this is my first time making a map for my builds
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:51:48 so i just want to know if it looks good?
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:53:29 well the need is that nobody knows the setting of my builds including me
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:54:17 oh wait I forgot a scale
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:54:34 well the setting is like WW2 era
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:54:39 so planes don't have to go supersonic
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:56:14 dude imagine the map is a place during WW2
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:56:20 and irl too
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:56:26 not with plane crazy engines and stuff
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:57:17 hold on here's an updated version
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:57:26 
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:58:21 alright the size of the entire archipelago is about the size of Java
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:58:37 yeah, I don't like flying for like 10 minutes to go somewhere
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:58:39 it's boring
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:59:23 Setting for my ship builds in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 17:59:30 basically mini WW2
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 18:15:09 isn't that the blinder?
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 18:15:13 I wanted to make it
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 18:15:18 but just too complex for me

creations-chat 2022-01-23 18:26:33 here plane crazy aw shoot wrong screenshot
creations-chat 2022-01-23 18:29:15 only picture where plane crazy exists
creations-chat 2022-01-23 18:36:15 here
creations-chat 2022-01-23 18:38:43 from the views, looks like it could best be used in modern destroyers
<@!310133243028570122> yeah 😦

<@456226577798135808> Oh I couldn't see the top view, well with the top view, looks like it could be used for gunboats
creations-chat 2022-01-23 18:49:53 yeah I did way too much on the editing, I want to do this style again so I want to know if it's good for <#384025409945337856> ?
Like a little bit of editing for cooler effects?
Alright thanks <@!695457559989190686>
creations-chat 2022-01-23 18:53:26 In the 2 photos or the ones with the 5 ships going boom?
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 18:55:34 hey is this ammunition thing for a ship turret good?
creations-chat 2022-01-23 18:56:58 I know
now can people stop telling me it doesn't look like PC? I get the point
creations-chat 2022-01-23 19:05:09 gunboats and patrol boats the best I got for the hull
I don't think it's too big, patrol boats are that size
creations-chat 2022-01-23 19:11:23 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 19:11:29 scary
creations-chat 2022-01-23 19:14:13 here's one of the ships that was in the overly edited image

plane-crazy 2022-01-23 19:48:42 it's a sail boat
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 19:48:45 giant sail boat
creations-chat 2022-01-23 19:51:20 you know that flash suits prevent people from getting on fire from the sparks of a gun?
that's one of the reasons how the battle of jutland caused the british to lose many of their ships because they didn't wear flash suits, causing the sparks to ignite the ammunition
<@!460531752033845258> it's the best word I can use but if you got anything better, I'll change it
creations-chat 2022-01-23 19:54:30 stuff like court marshalling

<@!460531752033845258> no I mean like if they're caught in the turrets without a flash suit, they get punished
sort of like if you break a bunch of rules that are for your safety, you'll still get punished
oh ok

creations-chat 2022-01-23 20:30:29 Understandable,
The first carrier was made in less than a day and very rushed, the second carrier was the oldest ship out of all of them so you can see the god awful paint scheme.
The light cruiser is the only one that I can get the commitment to fix and add an interior, but the deck sits very low in the water so I'll have to fix a few things before making an interior.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 20:53:29 and you can also do this  flag 🇬🇪

creations-chat 2022-01-23 22:03:59 dude this is on a ship... they have no room to spare

not really, it's like the size of a WW2 destroyer
creations-chat 2022-01-23 22:07:30 2km? you're thinking of a different person
this thing is about 190 meters
creations-chat 2022-01-23 22:10:27 
creations-chat 2022-01-23 22:12:58 well yeah, that covenant ship was my friend's
he just flew above me and I just thought, hmmmm this will be good screenshot
creations-chat 2022-01-23 22:16:16 why would I though
well yeah but there was nothing that said it was mine too

it was just "big covenant ship"
creations-chat 2022-01-23 22:24:15 ayo my ship just reached 5k blocks 😄


<@!401530469952389130> he's just gonna dislike everything like he always does lol
creations-chat 2022-01-23 22:26:43 atleast he has money to replace the roadwheels
A grand total of $2.56
creations-chat 2022-01-23 22:30:21 looks good and the max speed of 5000 is truly zoom certified
creations-chat 2022-01-23 22:34:38 finish it and it'll probably be the best looking A-wing in PCC
creations-chat 2022-01-23 22:37:38 chad moment
creations-chat 2022-01-24 00:23:23 did you ever think of being able to just punch or puncture light tank armour if you had a pickaxe or something?
early light tank armour was like 10mm lol
creations-chat 2022-01-24 00:26:41 well yeah, but 10mm is 1cm and 1cm is pretty small
like 1cm is about the size of this [][][]
and I sometime think that if a tankette or something goes on very uneven ground, is it possible for the thing to just have it's body slant and stuff?
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 00:28:20 bruh I got smoked
creations-chat 2022-01-24 00:33:25 well most pickaxes have a pointed end like this
and pointed options redirect the energy in a more concentrated point
creations-chat 2022-01-24 00:42:24 also very mitosis

creations-chat 2022-01-24 00:53:00 it legit cannot fly lol, no actual engines and nothing that can make it pitch

the only thing that can move other than the props was the vertical stabilizer

I really really wanted to make it fly and with camo but I don't have the commitment

creations-chat 2022-01-24 01:20:02 how are people liking my contra-rotating props? is it because you get distracted by the very beautiful way it go spin?
creations-chat 2022-01-24 01:24:31 I didn't think it was executed that well, most of the fuselage details had to be sacrificed just for it to spin lol, there's a reason why my landing gear looked so bad
you can even see exposed angle lock motors and disconnecters

plane-crazy 2022-01-24 04:12:37 this area looks like the mantlet
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 04:12:56 and the whole upper glacis and mudguard remind me of a panther
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 04:13:12 if you extended the mudguards it'll look like a panther hull

just very ugly looking cranes...
creations-chat 2022-01-25 01:54:31 I wonder if anyone made an M-4 bomber
I really want to make one but the wing angle makes me not want to
creations-chat 2022-01-25 01:57:29 now that crane looks really cool
is it possible for you to convert it?
creations-chat 2022-01-25 01:59:57 yeah, I have two ships that are roscale and they are really cool looking
one even has recoil for the main guns

creations-chat 2022-01-25 02:24:41 I know but the cockpit and wings look really good, other than the propeller though
creations-chat 2022-01-25 02:27:03 angle lock spamming sounds easier said than done though, it takes a long time to just make all of the separate cylinders

<@!642524491439800330> by that point it's better to convert it to a fictional plane
creations-chat 2022-02-19 04:13:12 well first of all, you messed up on the nose and cockpit
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:17:12 car
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:17:27 you shorten the cockpit by changing the two front glass blocks to plastic
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:19:45 although the it's not perfect, this is a somewhat accurate nose
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:19:57 The cockpit isn't touching the black part
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:20:55 oh yeah the vertical stabilizer is too short
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:20:59 
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:21:09 I want to but I got a bigger proejct
creations-chat 2022-02-19 04:21:50 polish dancing co- boat
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:22:43 It's like 80% done
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:22:49 what's left is tidying it up
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:22:52 and painting it
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:23:19 Well what you're seeing is just part of it
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:23:33 I put all the effort of 11 year old me into the nose
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:23:37 and tail
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:23:47 so the body area where the air intake is horribly messy
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:23:54 13
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:24:05 yeah but anyways
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:24:11 Don't look at the air intakes
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:24:19 you'll see atleast 5 different exposed motor bases
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:24:52 way better
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:25:11 I know it's a mess but you cannot lie that this nose looks good
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:25:17 if the Angles that is
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:25:36 it will not be done
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:25:41 I've shelved it for like 10 months already
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:25:51 is that Roscale?
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:26:14 smaller or bigger?
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:26:31 a bit bigger?
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:26:42 I did mine in roscale and it was quite big
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:27:06 that's better
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:27:14 actually that looks like it's actually roscale
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:27:28 I did mine in roscale where I made each 1 and a half block = 1 meter
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:27:32 isn't that big?
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:27:34 it's 20 meters
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:27:40 20 meters ~ 65 feet
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:28:06 really?
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:28:37 I measured mine in how many roblox feet it fits
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:29:06 
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:29:17 these look 3 meters to me
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:29:21 and 3 meters is like 3.2 feet
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:29:30 mine is roblox feet
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:30:09 ah I hate those kinds of elevations
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:30:17 The gun and elevation is good
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:30:21 but it's the area where the motor is
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:30:32 it's always far away so it pivots in the wrong direction
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:31:35 
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:31:45 make it one block shorter
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:32:00 I hate how the motor 2 makes it pivot in the wrong area
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:32:04 it doesn't look good to me
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:32:37 I know
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:32:45 but on some tanks like Leo 2A4
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:32:49 where the mantlet area is flat
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:32:58 or stuff like the Sherman
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:37:46 does it play 80s music
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:39:46 which?
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:42:54 Possible for you to use any Presley Songs?
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:43:29 any form of rock?
creations-chat 2022-02-19 04:48:27 Is it possible for you to remove the springs and use disconnecters? The disconnectors will most likely help you organize and generally just make it easier for you to lock things
but I love that cockpit though
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:49:09 yeah but any more?
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:49:31 no idea!
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:50:00 what about that one Rockwell Song everybody decided to play for some reason
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:50:14 it definitely has the vibe of a song you'll listen to while driving at 11:00 PM
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:50:16 on a highway
creations-chat 2022-02-19 04:51:04 I mean the springs might cause a big problem in the future where some might get visibly trapped in the body and mess with physics or making the heli not look good
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:53:29 nope
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 04:53:46 <:nooo:787097964946259978>

plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:04:01 WITH THE LIMITED EDITION VERSION
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:04:10 ayo you have cobi sets?
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:04:20 YOU GET 5 CREWMEMBERS
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:04:23 BARBED WIRE
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:04:46 I like brickmania but they're builds aren't that good to me compared to cobi
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:05:01 mainly just the price for the cost
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:05:10 which was when though
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:05:15 first cobi set was like 2020
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:05:17 I ever had
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:05:30 
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:05:36 this was my first ever set
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:06:07 
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:06:14 This will and always be my most protected one though
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:06:30 I got the firefly
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:06:38 apparently cobi really hates american tank tracks
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:06:44 because every single american tank?
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:06:48 their tracks sucks
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:07:03 only up and down
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:07:11 oh nifeliz?
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:07:23 well I got their new king tiger a year ago
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:07:32 and their hull guns still don't go up and down
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:07:38 but their models are improving
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:07:43 in the color department though
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:07:56 still cannot lie that cobi sets are the best bang for your buck
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:08:06 Cobi sets aren't as reliable as lego though
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:08:17 In pretty much all of the sets I've got which is like 15
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:08:22 there was atleast 1 missing part
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:08:34 it could be minor like one stud or major like a 2x2 flat piece
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:09:04 also their 2x2 tracks suck
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:09:19 like the medium sized black ones that you see on medium tanks?
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:09:22 those things barely turn
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:10:09 probably the friction
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 05:10:15 YOU WANT DOG?

plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:55:56 and most of the liquid food goes to pee
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:56:12 yes but do you have cyan name tag?
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:57:04 now I have to find a way to convert blocks into meters/feet
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:57:17 to even measure how big my ship is
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:57:54 Cyan Car
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:58:53 so a meter = 1.5~ blocks in the game
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 20:58:59 so I'm gonna use that as a measurement
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 21:02:24 alright so my ship is about 220~ feet
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 21:02:25 way too short
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 21:02:45 wait no I did the formula wrnog
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 21:02:53 car
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 21:03:45 so my ship is actually about 320~ feet long
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 21:03:52 I'm using 1 meter = 1.5 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 21:04:00 but in reality it's about 1 meter = 1.4 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 21:04:07 so I'm gonna have to add like 50 extra feet
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 21:05:23 well I am
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 21:05:36 so the planned size of the cruiser is supposed to be 420 ft
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 21:05:41 but it's short by 60
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 21:05:45 that isn't good
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 21:06:45 and my ship is basically a shortened pensacola
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 21:06:52 with one aft turret removed
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 21:07:03 pensacola would be about 520 feet
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 21:07:19 Pensacola's actual length is 580~ feet
plane-crazy 2022-02-19 21:07:26 so I'm short by about 300 feet

creations-chat 2022-05-27 04:29:27 bros left
general 2022-05-27 04:34:45 you guys ever think how a real life force field can be made with strong magnets?
general 2022-05-27 04:34:55 like you make a big ball of very magnetic stuff
general 2022-05-27 04:35:02 and then all the magnetic things in an area
general 2022-05-27 04:35:04 is pushed out
general 2022-05-27 04:35:12 problem is that if you turn the magnet
general 2022-05-27 04:35:15 like 180 degrees
general 2022-05-27 04:35:37 then it just sucks in magnetic things
creations-chat 2022-05-27 04:36:29 I think it's good enough to be an actual build, because i saw someone make an F-5 with no exposed motors or anything, and everything was smooth
but he should have posted more photos and a video to make it seem real
creations-chat 2022-05-27 04:39:07 aight case dismissed
plane-crazy 2022-05-27 04:41:01 middle one, as it has that reflection that's just noticable that doesn't make it hyper realistic
plane-crazy 2022-05-27 04:41:05 people try to do too many things
plane-crazy 2022-05-27 04:41:09 like sun glare
plane-crazy 2022-05-27 04:41:14 and ultra shiny walls
plane-crazy 2022-05-27 04:41:23 but that just makes it less realistic because stuff like that never happens

looks like I made the width too fat
but the length is better

I don't get why roscalers make the F4 so small
creations-chat 2022-06-05 03:45:11 I saw it too and my F4 phantom definitely is fatter, but I think the length and cockpit width on most roscale F4 phantoms are lacking

I saw someone say his F4 phantom is roscale, but the fuselage and air intakes are too thin, I'm saying like 2 blocks total wide
creations-chat 2022-06-05 03:47:33 most western MBTs look like that, like the Leopard 2A4 and Type 90

creations-chat 2022-06-09 02:49:29 honestly I heavily dislike hyper realistic F-15s, F-16s, etc because to me, they all have the same design
creations-chat 2022-06-09 02:51:55 I still haven't seen a jet like the F-15 STOL and F2H Banshee, always the modern jets that all look the same other than slightly different air intakes and rudders
creations-chat 2022-06-09 02:55:11 F7U Cutlass and the F4D Skyray are builds literally never seen yet

creations-chat 2022-06-16 21:02:02 they don't look hot if they're all clones

<@756682198857416784>  holy crap you're right, the entire fuselage looks the same and things different are the wings and air intakes
creations-chat 2022-06-16 21:05:34 <@448677698773057547> A4 and A7 aren't late cold war jets though
I don't like the Sukhois either

<@551806781609869313> I know the FC-31 looks like an F-35
the cargo jet looks different from the C5 or Globemaster
and the J-10 doesn't have a western look alike other than maybe the Rafale and Gripen?
creations-chat 2022-06-16 21:08:12 F-15 and F-16 look different but the F-15 and F/A-18 looks similar with the fuselage and twin rudders

I know but I like the Eurofighter's looks too
creations-chat 2022-06-16 21:10:37 both Euro and J-10 are hot while the F-15 looks bland as hell and the F/A-18 only makes up with the blandness for the cool wing shape

general 2022-06-18 17:36:09 why does everyone think napoleon is short
general 2022-06-18 17:36:17 5'7 is the most average anyone could be
general 2022-06-18 17:36:21 I know
general 2022-06-18 17:36:29 higher risk of cancer due to more cells in a taller person
general 2022-06-18 17:36:42 though me being short wouldn't help me
general 2022-06-18 17:36:49 mainly because both my parents had cancer
general 2022-06-18 17:36:51 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2022-06-18 17:37:13 it's not gonna be cool I tell you
general 2022-06-18 17:37:49 🤨
general 2022-06-18 17:38:01 5'5 better I think
general 2022-06-18 17:38:04 average height
general 2022-06-18 17:38:15 you're tall enough for most things
general 2022-06-18 17:38:19 and you don't have a higher risk of cancer
general 2022-06-18 17:38:29 yeah but don't want a higher risk don't you?
general 2022-06-18 17:39:04 6 feet is about 1.8 meters
general 2022-06-18 17:39:07 that's 180 centimeters
general 2022-06-18 17:39:08 ez
general 2022-06-18 17:39:23 bro that's arabic 💀
general 2022-06-18 17:39:28 wait
general 2022-06-18 17:39:31 no is that urdu
general 2022-06-18 17:39:34 not a hindi script
general 2022-06-18 17:40:05 bro like 80% of pakistan speaks it 💀
general 2022-06-18 17:40:09 that's like 180 million people
general 2022-06-18 17:40:24 nah
general 2022-06-18 17:40:35 feet is the perfect unit for length of human sized objects
general 2022-06-18 17:40:48 perfect for human sized objects though
general 2022-06-18 17:40:53 you don't want to say like 1.4 meters
general 2022-06-18 17:40:57 say something like 3 and a half feet
general 2022-06-18 17:41:17 man how do I have 32 days
general 2022-06-18 17:41:19 I thought I had 27
general 2022-06-18 17:41:46 June is just the second august
general 2022-06-18 17:41:50 change my mind
general 2022-06-18 17:41:54 5'4
general 2022-06-18 17:41:55 ez
general 2022-06-18 17:42:10 man nobody in meters would say that too
general 2022-06-18 17:42:24 saying someone's height in centimeters is confusing
general 2022-06-18 17:42:58 same
general 2022-06-18 17:43:04 except I stopped for like an entire year
general 2022-06-18 17:43:07 gaem got too boring
general 2022-06-18 17:43:19 because it generally is worse
general 2022-06-18 17:43:25 higher risk of cancer
general 2022-06-18 17:43:46 also higher strain on your knees
general 2022-06-18 17:43:49 because more weight
general 2022-06-18 17:43:57 imagine having a higher risk of cancer :mock:
general 2022-06-18 17:44:17 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2022-06-18 17:44:25 I know I will too
general 2022-06-18 17:44:30 both mom and dad have cancer
general 2022-06-18 17:44:56 no I don't say that to people :iwouldnever:
general 2022-06-18 17:45:15 I dream of living to like 200 years or something
general 2022-06-18 17:45:19 though chances are none
general 2022-06-18 17:45:34 like 100 years is too short
general 2022-06-18 17:46:14 oh yeah
general 2022-06-18 17:46:20 imagine trying to reach for the bottom aisle
general 2022-06-18 17:46:23 in stores and stuff
general 2022-06-18 17:46:33 and trying to lift something on the ground that's heav
general 2022-06-18 17:46:35 heavy
general 2022-06-18 17:46:41 BUT MY KNEES!
general 2022-06-18 17:46:50 then my back!
general 2022-06-18 17:47:07 yeah but I want to keep my knees not be damaged
general 2022-06-18 17:47:20 you can't exactly heal your knees like how you can't exactly heal your hearing
general 2022-06-18 17:47:37 no I won't fracture it
general 2022-06-18 17:48:11 I never said it'll break
general 2022-06-18 17:48:32 but I don't want to strain my knees
general 2022-06-18 17:48:56 probably
general 2022-06-18 17:49:52 no i'm not
general 2022-06-18 17:50:05 you can get a chair or something
general 2022-06-18 17:50:18 and seeing things better isn't really a benefit
general 2022-06-18 17:50:27 also the only seeing better when you're tall
general 2022-06-18 17:50:30 is to see how far
general 2022-06-18 17:50:39 but nobody is going to see stuff like 25 miles away
general 2022-06-18 17:50:59 but the mall is flat
general 2022-06-18 17:51:13 bro what malls have things that require you to be 6 feet to see?
general 2022-06-18 17:51:19 you can tilt your head you know
general 2022-06-18 17:51:33 and the only malls I can think of that requires you to be tall to see things is costco
general 2022-06-18 17:51:42 and you can't even buy the things on the higher shelves
general 2022-06-18 17:51:52 I don't drink tea and I already have a kettle 😎
general 2022-06-18 17:52:34 adds like two inches
general 2022-06-18 17:52:36 but those two inches are good
general 2022-06-18 17:53:05 man where the heck are you
general 2022-06-18 17:53:12 and standard 14 year old height isn't 5'10
general 2022-06-18 17:53:16 it's like 5'6-8
general 2022-06-18 17:53:24 oh great heavens
general 2022-06-18 17:53:31 i'm gonna be a dwarf!!@!!!@!
general 2022-06-18 17:53:40 yes and no
general 2022-06-18 17:53:58 average height in vietnam is like 5'4-5
general 2022-06-18 17:54:13 average height in america is 5'6-8
general 2022-06-18 17:54:35 Philippines?
general 2022-06-18 17:54:46 because the only country to the east of vietnam is the philippines
general 2022-06-18 17:54:53 bro I'm not filipino 💀
general 2022-06-18 17:54:55 I would never know that

general 2022-06-18 17:56:02 that means he could be Chinese, Korean, Taiwanese, or Japanese
general 2022-06-18 17:56:05 and if you count Russia
general 2022-06-18 17:56:08 Russian too
general 2022-06-18 17:56:34 reminds me of this photo too
general 2022-06-18 17:56:55 still gives me the chills

general 2022-06-18 21:58:51 2k11 krug
general 2022-06-18 21:58:54 reminds me of this thing
general 2022-06-18 21:59:35 
general 2022-06-18 22:01:00 Su-34 is ugly as hell
general 2022-06-18 22:01:14 generally all side by side style of planes look ugly as hell tbh
general 2022-06-18 22:01:22 
general 2022-06-18 22:01:29 only ones that didn't look ugly is like the F-111 and the A6
general 2022-06-18 22:01:53 fr?
general 2022-06-18 22:02:00 nah I doubt it
general 2022-06-18 22:02:05 they got the US
general 2022-06-18 22:02:11 it'll take longer and it'll cost more lives
general 2022-06-18 22:02:14 but the US exists
general 2022-06-18 22:02:19 and so did the USSR
general 2022-06-18 22:04:10 they'd still have resource issues
general 2022-06-18 22:04:14 though not as much
general 2022-06-18 22:04:30 also what would winning the battle of britain mean?
general 2022-06-18 22:04:34 like a total victory with minimal losses
general 2022-06-18 22:04:41 or a phyrric victory
general 2022-06-18 22:04:43 with heavy losses?
general 2022-06-18 22:05:01 you guys got the english channel
general 2022-06-18 22:05:07 and the german navy was small though
general 2022-06-18 22:05:19 like 10 battleships and half of them are disputed between battlecruisers
general 2022-06-18 22:05:22 and battleships
general 2022-06-18 22:05:33 that would require the fall of britain though
general 2022-06-18 22:05:38 and that's not counting if the british didn't scuttle them
general 2022-06-18 22:05:53 until you see the tennessee
general 2022-06-18 22:06:09 chonky
general 2022-06-18 22:07:13 most of them are something like 9041 Bobstark
general 2022-06-18 22:07:29 1025 Shoemaker
general 2022-06-18 22:08:00 no
general 2022-06-18 22:08:05 it was because of cannons and MGs
general 2022-06-18 22:08:10 female tanks had no cannons
general 2022-06-18 22:08:12 male tanks had cannons
general 2022-06-18 22:08:23 Bertha was the big gun though
general 2022-06-18 22:08:30 and Mother was the prototype of the Mk. 1
general 2022-06-18 22:09:06 so does the US
general 2022-06-18 22:09:25 
general 2022-06-18 22:09:31 that's a state
general 2022-06-18 22:09:33 also you just said ships
general 2022-06-18 22:09:39 they named battleships after states
general 2022-06-18 22:09:45 cruisers and now subs after cities
general 2022-06-18 22:10:00 🤮
general 2022-06-18 22:10:03 USS T*xas 🤮
general 2022-06-18 22:10:22 I don't see anything
general 2022-06-18 22:11:30 man I gotta play war thunder
general 2022-06-18 22:11:35 but my GPU would heat up to 100C
general 2022-06-18 22:11:38 🤮
general 2022-06-18 22:11:42 imagine using HMS
general 2022-06-18 22:11:48 (Sweden and Norway uses it)
general 2022-06-18 22:11:49 🤮
general 2022-06-18 22:12:02 RX 5500
general 2022-06-18 22:12:07 I got a terrible tower though
general 2022-06-18 22:12:16 HMS is for Sweden and Norway too though
general 2022-06-18 22:12:27 it's that you don't want to confuse them
general 2022-06-18 22:12:34 so people use HNoMs
general 2022-06-18 22:13:11 and HSwMS
general 2022-06-18 22:13:16 but it's HMS in Swedish
general 2022-06-18 22:13:46 isn't that for mail though
general 2022-06-18 22:13:49 Royal Mail Ship?
general 2022-06-18 22:14:02 
general 2022-06-18 22:14:20 Mail ship
general 2022-06-18 22:14:37 and it carried mail?
general 2022-06-18 22:14:44 why do people like the RMS titanic so much
general 2022-06-18 22:14:46 like seriously
general 2022-06-18 22:14:50 it just struck an iceburg
general 2022-06-18 22:14:52 and it sunk
general 2022-06-18 22:15:01 yeah but they made 3 of the Olympic classes
general 2022-06-18 22:15:05 that's not a unique ship
general 2022-06-18 22:15:16 Olympic had a much better story
general 2022-06-18 22:15:22 literally accidentally rammed a navy ship
general 2022-06-18 22:15:26 or was it the brittanic?
general 2022-06-18 22:15:45 but one of them accidentally rammed a ship
general 2022-06-18 22:15:55 much more cooler story than strucking an iceburg and sinking
general 2022-06-18 22:16:47 no it was the Olympic that rammed a ship
general 2022-06-18 22:16:58 much better story than the Titanic that rammed an iceburg
general 2022-06-18 22:17:04 imagine ramming a piece of big ice and sinking
general 2022-06-18 22:17:24 Olympic rammed an actual warship and didn't sink
general 2022-06-18 22:17:42 you got pictures of like 50 tanks or ships moving?
general 2022-06-18 22:17:58

creations-chat 2022-06-26 19:57:17 keeping up the hars replacement with the maroon name?
creations-chat 2022-06-26 20:00:53 He has a point though
creations-chat 2022-06-26 20:06:00 No, his point is that you cannot say "That F-15 is utter disappointment and you should delete it", it is not proper criticism. Even if it is to you, it doesn't help the person who made the build in any real way, saying stuff like "That F-15 is utter disappointment but if you fix the wings, air intakes, and the nose, it could be somewhat better" is actual criticism
creations-chat 2022-06-26 20:08:55 <@458012038594166795> holy jesus use sentences, I can't even read a damn word because all I see is creations and innovation

<@456226577798135808> With most builds beyond repair, it's often that it is someone's first time, you can't just say that their build is terrible, and leave it at that.
because then, they don't fix it because they don't know what to fix, so their builds just stay awful

creations-chat 2022-06-26 20:57:55 it used to be about how nice criticism should be, and now it's just one person having no grammar and bringing random stuff, and another guy being rational

creations-chat 2022-06-26 23:47:03 I have the skill to make a ship realistic as hell with small details, but I choose not to because I don't like the style
creations-chat 2022-06-26 23:49:30 it isn't, I do have a ship that has details everywhere, but I don't like it as much because it lags the hell out of my PC, it takes longer to load, and doesn't look as good compared to another ship I made
creations-chat 2022-06-26 23:57:32 No, I don't say it could get to HOF

<@456226577798135808> Though yes, people sometimes do create stuff that looks bad in both the game and in plane crazy, and besides, he only posted two times in creations

Also no, I wasn't writing the holy bible or the entire dictionary, I was AFK

general 2022-06-27 00:49:20 because some were used to defend ships evacuating South Vietnamese Troops
general 2022-06-27 00:49:30 no no

creations-chat 2022-06-27 19:38:59 Yeah but the cool thing about jade is that you can make it into statues
creations-chat 2022-06-27 19:41:25 Amethyst is cool but seeing amethysts in geodes remind me of how snot crystalizes in the nose, it's weird I know

<@652968737485357056> but you can use jade in jewelry too
creations-chat 2022-06-27 19:44:18 Though yes, emeralds are more shiny, jade is cooler because you don't have to cut at a precise angle

Like cutting an emerald into a cube will make it very weak, but you can do the same with jade and it will stay the same

general 2022-07-09 03:49:32 how so?
general 2022-07-09 03:49:45 btw Samsung Galaxy A12, about 200 dollars
general 2022-07-09 03:49:48 it's kinda glitchy
general 2022-07-09 03:49:51 but it does the job
general 2022-07-09 03:51:54 doesn't matter if its goofy
general 2022-07-09 03:51:58 it has 4 cameras
general 2022-07-09 03:52:02 *nobody*

general 2022-07-09 03:52:19 bro like 40 mil people
general 2022-07-09 03:52:24 china exists too
general 2022-07-09 03:52:40 Androids and specifically Samsung are superior to iPhones
general 2022-07-09 03:52:50 though the iPads
general 2022-07-09 03:52:54 nobody can beat the iPads
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 03:54:13 oh yeah

general 2022-07-09 04:09:00 android phones though 🤩
general 2022-07-09 04:09:17 bro
general 2022-07-09 04:09:33 when was the last time you saw a functional iPhone that's not used being sold for 200 dollars?
general 2022-07-09 04:09:40 pretty much nonexistent
general 2022-07-09 04:10:21 yes but so are androids
general 2022-07-09 04:10:31 S21, S22, and the Note 10s are pretty cool
general 2022-07-09 04:10:46 my dad's Note 10+ has a built in pen
general 2022-07-09 04:10:57 bro have you seen the iPhone batteries?
general 2022-07-09 04:11:34 because an iPhone 11 is the flagship...
general 2022-07-09 04:11:50 it is when it first released
general 2022-07-09 04:12:19 yes but are the pro and max iPhone 11s?
general 2022-07-09 04:12:52 man who uses LG
general 2022-07-09 04:13:16 oh yeah for some reason old 2015~ electronics
general 2022-07-09 04:13:21 are way more durable than currently
general 2022-07-09 04:13:26 I have an iPad 3 I believe
general 2022-07-09 04:13:30 dropped it countless times on the floor
general 2022-07-09 04:13:31 on concrete
general 2022-07-09 04:13:41 really only a diagonal crack on the screen
general 2022-07-09 04:13:52 oh yeah for some reason
general 2022-07-09 04:14:05 my iPad's battery power is uh
general 2022-07-09 04:14:07 laughable
general 2022-07-09 04:14:16 1 minute of youtube = 1%
general 2022-07-09 04:14:24 so you see a 10 minute video?
general 2022-07-09 04:14:28 there goes 10% of your battery power
general 2022-07-09 04:14:56 A12 has good battery life for now though
general 2022-07-09 04:15:04 really only 1% every 15 minutes or so
general 2022-07-09 04:15:21 yeah
general 2022-07-09 04:15:33 and Heat and cold damage degrades it too
general 2022-07-09 04:15:45 doesn't help that 8 year old kids leave their iPads in their car
general 2022-07-09 04:15:52 and just leave it there for the entire day
general 2022-07-09 04:16:04 so now their ipad has like 100 degree weather
general 2022-07-09 04:16:07 for an entire day
general 2022-07-09 04:16:27 cold can harden the batteries
general 2022-07-09 04:16:41 what country
general 2022-07-09 04:16:54 ASEAN 🤩
general 2022-07-09 04:17:32 South East Asians be chads and going out to 90 degree weather with like 80% humidity
general 2022-07-09 04:18:13 nerd!
general 2022-07-09 04:18:21 because it's right next to the equator
general 2022-07-09 04:18:27 there is a bunch of forests

general 2022-07-09 04:20:51 I don't like top end phones tbh
general 2022-07-09 04:20:54 samsung or not
general 2022-07-09 04:20:59 paying 1000+ dollars just for a phone
general 2022-07-09 04:21:03 is too ridiculous
general 2022-07-09 04:21:54 the thing you use
general 2022-07-09 04:21:58 to plug into the outlets
general 2022-07-09 04:22:16 my A12 came with one
general 2022-07-09 04:22:38 fast charging is overrated
general 2022-07-09 04:22:48 like 20% faster
general 2022-07-09 04:22:54 but heats your device way too much
general 2022-07-09 04:23:03 also heard it can shorten battery life span
general 2022-07-09 04:23:11 and besides
general 2022-07-09 04:23:20 most of the time you're charging when you go to bed
general 2022-07-09 04:23:24 you don't need a fast charger
general 2022-07-09 04:23:28 if you're gone for 8 hours
general 2022-07-09 04:23:35 no
general 2022-07-09 04:23:36 :swag:
general 2022-07-09 04:23:48 not really
general 2022-07-09 04:23:57 the only real times I leave home
general 2022-07-09 04:24:00 is to shop
general 2022-07-09 04:24:03 like groceries
general 2022-07-09 04:24:06 or traveling
general 2022-07-09 04:24:17 and I cannot tell you how long my mom shops for
general 2022-07-09 04:24:25 like an entire hour
general 2022-07-09 04:24:30 not counting the time you had to drive to the walmart
general 2022-07-09 04:24:32 and leaving
general 2022-07-09 04:24:43 and I'm in Oklahoma out of all places
general 2022-07-09 04:24:53 so like a 20+ car ride to a walmart or costco
general 2022-07-09 04:24:59 an hour there
general 2022-07-09 04:25:04 and then a 20+ minute car ride
general 2022-07-09 04:25:07 back
general 2022-07-09 04:25:14 that's an hour and 40 minutes
general 2022-07-09 04:25:21 my phone does
general 2022-07-09 04:25:29 but what you're saying is your phone completely dying
general 2022-07-09 04:25:40 and you the fast charger is useful
general 2022-07-09 04:25:45 when you leave your house
general 2022-07-09 04:26:00 does it come with a pen?

general 2022-07-09 04:27:36 entire day's worth and half a day of battery life

general 2022-07-09 04:27:56 yeah look at this
general 2022-07-09 04:28:06 almost an entire day and a half
general 2022-07-09 04:28:40 never happens
general 2022-07-09 04:28:46 you need to use your finger nails
general 2022-07-09 04:28:50 to just push it down far enough
general 2022-07-09 04:28:54 and even then
general 2022-07-09 04:29:03 taking it out is pretty difficult
general 2022-07-09 04:29:08 because the friction
general 2022-07-09 04:29:13 it's not
general 2022-07-09 04:29:19 I own an A12
general 2022-07-09 04:29:25 I legit do
general 2022-07-09 04:29:32 and I don't charge it for up to 3 days
general 2022-07-09 04:29:36 because it just lasts that long
general 2022-07-09 04:29:41 though I spend my entirety on youtube
general 2022-07-09 04:29:53 but with a laptop, you actively browse, play games
general 2022-07-09 04:29:56 research
general 2022-07-09 04:30:17 and you're saying a laptop, so I'm assuming you're doing it for school
general 2022-07-09 04:30:29 yeah I spend a good 6 hours at school looking at wikipedia
general 2022-07-09 04:30:47 because wiki got the cool pictures

You can easily fix the protruding signs by making a piston tower in the middle fuselage and put the signs inside the nose, and then you use the pistons to push the signs further out to show

general 2022-07-21 02:04:34 are you implying you're 14
general 2022-07-21 02:07:18 have you ever thought about how fast gravity moves
general 2022-07-21 02:07:57 you know that model
general 2022-07-21 02:08:01 like a bed sheet
general 2022-07-21 02:08:10 the earth is a bowling ball
general 2022-07-21 02:08:15 and the moon is a golf ball
general 2022-07-21 02:08:20 you put the moon in but stationary
general 2022-07-21 02:08:27 it will go into the dent the bowling ball caused
general 2022-07-21 02:08:35 but if you move the moon fast enough
general 2022-07-21 02:08:46 the moon will be orbiting the bowling ball for a second
general 2022-07-21 02:08:49 before friction comes in
general 2022-07-21 02:08:59 but how fast does the gravity effect it
general 2022-07-21 02:09:02 like in actual space
general 2022-07-21 02:09:20 theoretically the gravity is faster than light
general 2022-07-21 02:10:27 I'm asian man

general 2022-07-21 02:28:19 Reload doesn't matter if your opponent is dead
general 2022-07-21 02:28:35 also no recoil at all 😎
general 2022-07-21 02:28:42 are those dino nuggies
general 2022-07-21 02:29:04 BR does like 32 damage per shot
general 2022-07-21 02:29:09 that's 4
general 2022-07-21 02:29:14 4 shots per kill
general 2022-07-21 02:29:21 if you are facing 3 opponents
general 2022-07-21 02:29:28 3 x 4 = 12 shots having to be fired
general 2022-07-21 02:29:35 low recoil
general 2022-07-21 02:29:41 DBV was cool
general 2022-07-21 02:29:57 until I realized that normal shotguns do the same job
general 2022-07-21 02:29:58 but better
general 2022-07-21 02:30:20 lower recoil means higher chance of hitting <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2022-07-21 02:30:42 do you guys have the jkey
general 2022-07-21 02:30:52 I still have it on my old account (sucks horribly)

general 2022-07-21 02:32:04 but then they did a model rechange
general 2022-07-21 02:32:09 and now it's completely ruined
general 2022-07-21 02:32:17 the recoil, the reload
general 2022-07-21 02:32:24 I barely know
general 2022-07-21 02:32:47 HK-21E still good
general 2022-07-21 02:32:49 from what I remember

creations-chat 2022-07-22 01:54:29 Pickles and tomatoes on hamburgers 🤢
creations-chat 2022-07-22 01:56:38 Pickles are too sour for hamburgers, and they're really only two slices so you're eating those slices on at a time instead of a small bite when you're eating a burger
Tomatoes are too sweet and tart for a hamburger along with the fact that it's largely made out of water so when you bite it, all you taste is tomato water and tartness
creations-chat 2022-07-22 01:58:43 homemade burgers is sort of an oxymoron, because when you're usually buying a burger, you have to eat it while on the go, at a job, or unable to be using a table
so when you have the time to make a burger at home, you probably wouldn't need to use it while going somewhere

creations-chat 2022-08-16 20:50:37 try to make a 2 wide aircraft with custom landing gear that doesn't compromise the looks of the aircraft
creations-chat 2022-08-16 20:53:08 it's literally impossible right here, any custom landing gear would need to remove the half 1x2 wedge
creations-chat 2022-08-16 20:55:40 that only solves it partially, you need to find a way to find room in order to have the cylinder fit into the aircraft
and with the massive amount of motor lock, that would straight be impossible
creations-chat 2022-08-16 20:58:18 I don't use shaders
creations-chat 2022-08-16 21:01:05 stick landing gears better than no landing gears
creations-chat 2022-08-16 21:03:39 your suggestion of making the landing gear a text and cylinder would make it more ugly, and make it even more of a stick

creations-chat 2022-08-22 20:49:16 HOW DOES THIS THING GET LESS LIKES/DISLIKE RATIO COMPARED TO THE CRAPPY PANZER III
creations-chat 2022-08-22 20:51:20 because genuinely decent builds get worse likes/dislikes ratio than a crappy panzer III with the turret in the wrong place and the Engine Cowling with baby teeth gaps
creations-chat 2022-08-22 20:55:13 even then, that many people shouldn't be liking the panzer III as much as they did
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:07:58 how can you not say this thing is ugly and inaccurate as hell?

Red, Turret is put way too forward way too much
Orange, Panzer III's Armour is not angled at all yet on the PC one it's angled
Blue, Exposed Propeller Engines though I'll excuse that one
Purple, literally only two wheels and an exposed motor 💀
Yellow-Orange, No reason for the Rack, No reason at all
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:10:35 Hell, the only hull that has angled armour similar to the PC panzer III is a a StuG
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:17:24 Even if people change and that many less people are at 10 AM or 3 AM, it still doesn't matter that the Panzer III got that high of a ratio as it did, the person who made it didn't even bother with adding roadwheels and yet it still has high positive to dislike ratio
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:20:35 For what? a demented Panzer III that looks like it came out of Hungary or Sweden instead of Germany?
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:24:26 even if it is just a "bad" tank, I can get riled over it as it is because inherently, it is something that shouldn't be able to even get positive likes to dislike for something just mediocre
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:30:45 the big deal is that it exists in the first place and almost no feedback other than mine and another guy's, and that I'm disappointed in it more than anything

creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:43:32 and that saltiness is justified
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:45:54 even if it's the guy's first build, he already shows he has the skill and power to make it better, but chooses not to before uploading
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:48:23 as if the angle lock, motor lock, and even breaking a jet engine apart to make the gun doesn't make it anymore obvious

creations-chat 2022-08-22 22:00:10 sort of, also, he could have done atleast the roadwheels because what's holding up the tracks? definitely not the air
creations-chat 2022-08-22 22:03:07 yeah, and he can reset and do it over again
literally only takes 5 minutes of building and then an extra 2-3 minutes of posing
if he doesn't want to, then that's just pure laziness at it's greatest
creations-chat 2022-08-22 22:09:23 and I'm tired of trying to convince you it's a piece of crap and that you shouldn't be defending it, I'm gonna go leave too

general 2022-08-23 23:06:36 like fr
general 2022-08-23 23:06:42 person knew he forgot the wheels
general 2022-08-23 23:06:49 but he posted it anyways
general 2022-08-23 23:07:03 added a rack on the back for absolutely no other reason than why not
general 2022-08-23 23:07:14 so the turret is now placed a block or two infront
general 2022-08-23 23:07:23 armour is angled where it doesn't need to be and literally an easy fix

creations-chat 2022-08-23 23:28:20 it's the slant on the turret upf plate that's making it look weird

general 2022-08-23 23:28:58 but it's not even a proper panzer iii hull

general 2022-08-24 00:07:51 like I genuinely wonder if some guy with a very thick accent uses a flute
general 2022-08-24 00:08:00 would there be any noticeable change
creations-chat 2022-08-24 00:25:06 I don't care if it was big, he put it way too far forward and then made a rack that didn't even exist in any panzer III variants
general 2022-08-24 19:52:22 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/829737438964351056/1011388701236023307/attachment.gif

creations-chat 2022-08-26 01:24:14 
creations-chat 2022-08-26 01:28:12 only thing need to be said about the current state of the PCC creations standards
creations-chat 2022-08-26 01:32:27 1, Frontal Armour that is flat and where the bow machine gun is, is angled where in reality wasn't even angled 15 degrees.
2, Turret is placed way too far forward, and the Rack that's placed on top of the engine deck is nonexistent in ALL variants of the Panzer III and the guy added it for no other reason than why not.
3, Creator posted the Tank with only two wheels, and when someone pointed it out, he said he was too lazy to do it.
4, There are two propeller engines straight up jutting from the front of the tank, and the guy who made it did no attempt to hide it other than the colour.
creations-chat 2022-08-26 01:34:44 Angled Armour is *very* easy to fix and only needs the replacement of three blocks, that's it, three blocks
creations-chat 2022-08-26 01:36:47 Lets also talk about how the UPF and LPF literally juts out from the tracks
easy fix too, just remove the front 3 half blocks and you already fixed it
contest-chat 2022-08-26 01:38:37 <@999599719275823134> I highly suggest you use custom colours other than the prebuilt orange and yellow
creations-chat 2022-08-26 01:40:05 This Rack thing didn't even exist on ALL variants of the panzer 3
