plane-crazy 2022-12-12 14:28:35 it would be cool if they added missiles separate to rockets where depending on block size the radar signature increased/decreased changing the movement of the missile
plane-crazy 2022-12-12 23:42:42 can som1 help me with angle lock? i cant do it

general 2023-01-14 23:44:28 I think plane crazy should add g forces
general 2023-01-14 23:44:44 it would eliminate nam nam jets and shredders
general 2023-01-14 23:45:15 i mean the big ones
general 2023-01-14 23:45:21 .the ones you cant outfly
general 2023-01-14 23:45:33 xD
general 2023-01-14 23:45:58 but it would to my opinion,improove plane crazy pvp
general 2023-01-14 23:46:19 i mean look at modern jets
general 2023-01-14 23:46:34 they all have to combat g forces in some ways
general 2023-01-14 23:47:48 i dont get why people think they cant do cool manouvers, the ones people in plane crazy do were originated by the jet manouvers in the real world where g forces exist
general 2023-01-14 23:47:55 i know
general 2023-01-14 23:48:07 gun finaly serves a purpose to
general 2023-01-14 23:48:15 cus it sucks so bad rn
general 2023-01-14 23:49:15 no

general 2023-01-14 23:49:37 brain growth
general 2023-01-14 23:49:49 why
general 2023-01-14 23:50:42 like maybe if you pull 12 g's you black out and the warning of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 g's are warnings for you to stop turning
general 2023-01-14 23:51:15 simple maths
general 2023-01-14 23:51:52 the devs can tune it by testing it ingame
general 2023-01-14 23:52:31 also it would give plane crazy an update
general 2023-01-14 23:52:45 shut
general 2023-01-14 23:53:31 in pc2 they said they would add an environment like space
general 2023-01-14 23:53:57 there spaceships could chill as the force of gravity is weaker
general 2023-01-14 23:54:58 they should still limit gj , nam nam jets and shredders to make the game playable for some players
general 2023-01-14 23:55:24 i know
general 2023-01-14 23:56:14 g force could be a thing in pc2
general 2023-01-14 23:56:20 hopefully
general 2023-01-14 23:56:41 cus people quit the game bc shredders
general 2023-01-14 23:56:54 yes
general 2023-01-14 23:57:20 then they play other game and forget plane crazy
general 2023-01-14 23:57:28 /thats how peopel quit
general 2023-01-14 23:57:58 i guess so
general 2023-01-14 23:58:19 but non pvp is non fun logic
general 2023-01-14 23:58:44 no
general 2023-01-14 23:59:02 no
general 2023-01-14 23:59:08 thats illegal
general 2023-01-14 23:59:13 there is a mute button
general 2023-01-15 00:00:07 why not ad some fun by adding in g forces
general 2023-01-15 00:00:33 ok
general 2023-01-15 00:00:36 ill do it
general 2023-01-15 00:01:13 no
general 2023-01-15 00:01:56 look at modern combet
general 2023-01-15 00:02:06 *combat
general 2023-01-15 00:02:07 yes
general 2023-01-15 00:02:29 they should ad fox 2's
general 2023-01-15 00:02:42 like a gamepass or a limited event
general 2023-01-15 00:02:58 no
general 2023-01-15 00:03:43 think about it you need to reload them by landing in the airport, then you have 2 to fire off, they could add flares
general 2023-01-15 00:04:55 why  update missiles so they dont fly away from the target your shooting then
general 2023-01-15 00:05:54 pc 2
general 2023-01-15 00:06:03 ðŸ™‚
general 2023-01-15 00:07:44 fuck this game i quit with the worst comunity possible
