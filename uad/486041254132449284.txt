plane-crazy 2023-01-06 05:07:49 go from there
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 05:12:53 looks sick
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 05:19:04 how do i get image perms?
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 05:19:54 you have it tho
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:26:34 bock idea: motorized hinge, like a motor but instead of going left and right, it goes up and down
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:27:05 how?
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:28:22 tried that, doesn't work the same
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:28:49 whatever you say
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:41:25 you know how you make a turret? motor for horizontal motion, and for vertical motion? basically that but without the horizontal motor, so you're left with a motor that can only look up and down, only this is on a one-two block scale.
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:42:33 why am i trying to look smart?
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:42:42 thats the best way to explain it
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:43:54 did you even read what i said?
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:47:26 you get the function i'm talking about though, right?
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:50:01 i can't it's its not for a tank, neither do i build tanks
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:51:34 bruh
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:51:42 i didn't even say anything
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:51:59 because i dont post them here
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:55:31 its hard to explain without a visual, but i would say like a normal motor, but the attachment points are rotated 90 degrees, if you imagine a division sign, like that
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:56:12 %
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:57:41 yes, miniaturized to a 1x1
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 02:58:30 bruh..

general 2023-01-25 04:01:39 well, im proud of it
general 2023-01-25 04:05:53 i do, but if im being judged relative peoples death stars,  aircraft carriers, highly detailed tanks, and other things like that, its hard to consider yourself "Improved" if what's considered the skill floor is already very high.
general 2023-01-25 04:08:54 i tried the trail thing, they cant be replaced
plane-crazy 2023-01-25 04:38:04 <@200793484053970944> changed the nose, added the trails. Changed the cockpit, and the top of the ship, this good?
