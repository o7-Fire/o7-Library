plane-crazy 2021-09-12 13:29:09 yo
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 13:33:09 how do I record a video in Roblox?
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 13:33:15 I wanna show my creation in action
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 13:33:58 I...don't have any of those
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 13:34:13 I do
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 13:34:19 just no recording software
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 13:36:18 nvm, I did it
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 13:40:11 it won't lemme post the video I took
general 2021-09-12 13:40:45 guys, how do I get perms to post videos?
general 2021-09-12 13:41:19 ok, then how come I can't post the video I took of my creation?
general 2021-09-12 13:41:45 real mature...
general 2021-09-12 13:42:30 real mature of you to be condescending towards a new member
general 2021-09-12 13:42:52 I have read the rules
general 2021-09-12 13:43:08 not you
general 2021-09-12 13:43:39 I have been verified and I need a chat lvl 3 to post media
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 13:44:26 dammit, I wanted to show of me tank and I can't even post a picture of it
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 13:45:14 easier said than done when I have other things going on that require my attention
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 13:47:09 maybe it's your internet connection
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 13:47:31 depends on the mass of the whole thing
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 13:47:36 try experimenting
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 13:47:42 and don't forget to save the design
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 13:47:57 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 13:48:01 I'd try and match it
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 13:58:02 kinda wish motors were smaller
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 13:59:43 hey guys, I wonder what it would take to make a fully functional P1000 Ratte
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 14:02:30 I mean...
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 14:02:44 it's better than respawning as soon as you take damage
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 14:03:23 it's cowardly
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 14:03:51 I only respawn when I can't fight anymore
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 14:04:32 fair enough
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 14:18:05 not seeing a lot of tanks on here
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:06:23 I'm thinking about making another tank...
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:07:43 dope
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:07:56 I'd show you mine but the server won't lemme post images
bot-central 2021-09-12 16:10:38 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:10:49 oooh, nearly lvl 3
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:11:27 the Landkreuzer P1000 Ratte is the largest tank design ever developed
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:11:36 it was never officially built
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:11:52 soviet military green
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:12:13 idk
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:12:16 keep experimenting
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:13:23 slightly lighter colour
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:14:05 I'd still make it lighter
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:17:55 indeed
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:19:17 noice
bot-central 2021-09-12 16:19:32 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:19:47 I just try and come up with my own designs
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:20:03 the green needs to be much lighter, chipsandsalsa
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:20:35 look at soviet tanks and you'll see what I mean
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:21:11 there are tutorials on YT
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:21:35 but if it works, it works
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:25:35 I said lighter
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:25:39 MUCH lighter
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:25:52 I'd try 37
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:30:21 I'd go with 1, as well
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:33:36 that actually looks pretty good
plane-crazy 2021-09-12 16:37:12 wot
