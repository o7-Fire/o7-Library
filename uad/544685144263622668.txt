general 2023-06-02 00:40:16 with the greenhouse gases we produce
general 2023-06-02 00:40:32 we could prob get a temp that wont freeze us into ice blocks

general 2023-06-02 00:41:04 yes
general 2023-06-02 00:41:24 yes
general 2023-06-02 00:41:39 dead bodies = methane
general 2023-06-02 00:41:50 methane is one of the strongest greenhouse gases
general 2023-06-02 00:41:56 more methane = more warmth
general 2023-06-02 00:42:03 not in farms
general 2023-06-02 00:42:09 nobody hits rural areas
general 2023-06-02 00:42:18 the cows would die and their methane go to the planet

general 2023-06-02 22:54:11 the Russian Blue is a cat breed known for strong affection and timidness, and is also known to form strong connections, unlike passive agressive cats you see on the internet

general 2023-06-02 22:58:16 that has literally proven to be very rare, and dogs will do it too. it is only happening if the cat has no way to escape, and must eat to survive
general 2023-06-02 22:58:36 thx
general 2023-06-02 22:59:07 Did you hear about the cat Oscar, who provides emotional support to dying patients, and actually predicts who will die?
general 2023-06-02 22:59:42 animals have a knack for knowing who will die
general 2023-06-02 23:00:36 thats why cat owners need a SIG SAUER P228 or S&W M&P
general 2023-06-02 23:00:42 but i like guns
general 2023-06-02 23:00:45 so why not?

general 2023-06-02 23:15:49 or Ragdoll
general 2023-06-02 23:16:17 plus cats clean themselves
general 2023-06-02 23:16:48 cats are known to bury their poop
general 2023-06-02 23:16:53 hence the litter box
general 2023-06-02 23:17:20 thats why we have alitter box
general 2023-06-02 23:17:22 a litter*
general 2023-06-02 23:17:58 cats do need a litter box not because they aint potty trained, but because they bury their poop
general 2023-06-02 23:18:03 so its a place to bury it
general 2023-06-02 23:19:02 they hide it in the litter box
general 2023-06-02 23:19:16 yes!
general 2023-06-02 23:19:32 cats have a parasite in their poop, it attracts rats
general 2023-06-02 23:19:36 these rats eat the poop
general 2023-06-02 23:19:41 get clumsy
general 2023-06-02 23:19:44 then get eaten
general 2023-06-02 23:19:54 if the cat shit in their house and hid it
general 2023-06-02 23:20:00 he would have a rat infestation
general 2023-06-02 23:20:35 because cats are smarter with it
general 2023-06-02 23:20:44 dogs just shit and leave
general 2023-06-02 23:20:49 cats try and hide it
general 2023-06-02 23:21:32 10
general 2023-06-02 23:22:04 24 / 6+6

plane-crazy 2023-06-30 18:42:57 AND I DONT KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 18:43:10 the plane looks fine to me, but it looks shit on this server
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 18:43:17 heres the plane
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 18:43:37 
creations-chat 2023-06-30 18:44:55 this is a good opportunity to ask, what went wrong, and how can i make my other builds better?
creations-chat 2023-06-30 18:48:38 guys wtf went wrong with my AMX, and how can i make my other builds better?? I just want some help here. I understand why i have downvotes, and i am not complaining. I just need to know what the problem is, so i can fix it
creations-chat 2023-06-30 18:51:19 Could you elaborate on that? How do i make builds "accurate" or "better block usage", and how do i add details? and sure why not leafy
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:21:15 how do i make good noses
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:21:24 without it looking like a pencil
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:21:34 and without anglelock
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:21:48 (anglelock makes me go mad)
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:22:00 ive tried that
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:22:51 the thing with anglelock
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:23:08 is that theres always that one overlap
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:23:14 it makes me go insane trying to fix it
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:23:24 and you never know where to place the tower
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:23:41 i thought spine was easiest
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:24:07 for mig 29 its easy
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:24:12 true
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:24:28 but i hate how the organic way of making a good round nose looks like a pencil
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:24:35 wedge 1x4
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:24:39 triwedge 1x4
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:24:46 and pyramid wedge
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:24:55 it ruined my whole AMX
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:25:19 but 2 wide nose looks kinda weird
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:25:27 madvulpen uses 3 block noses
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:25:35 gj uses 3 block nose
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:26:14 im looking at vulpens tuts
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:26:19 i see some 3 wides in there
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:26:31 gj has a 3 block wide dragon fighter
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:27:08 i want to make the AMX international AMX
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:27:16 its like an f16 nose
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:27:23 but its meant to be 3 block
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:27:36 see
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:27:43 3 block nose looks more clean
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:27:50 but it looks like a pencil
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:28:32 the one on the left is skinny asf
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:29:10 and as a builder of chonky planes like AMX international AMX, MiG-25, and others, i find the one on the right completely fine
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:29:21 but i do see your point
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:29:30 one on the right looks more like f16
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:29:48 but how do you fix that gap with  no half triwedge 1x2
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:30:05 yeah that looks cool
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:31:16 oohhh
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:31:23 but those gaps!
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:31:28 they drive me fucking mad!
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:31:44 thats why they drive me mad
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:31:50 they reduce realism with no fix
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:32:01 but then again, pencil nose worse
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:32:16 ill make another AMX just to test the new idea
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:32:33 or maybe no
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:32:37 what plane should i make
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:33:01 im not making that disgrace to aerodynamics
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:33:08 nice
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:33:52 yeah right
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:34:02 look at the drag on the thing

plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:35:35 wait
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:35:42 2 wide is the first type of nose i learned
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:35:45 ok!
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:35:49 thx for your help
plane-crazy 2023-06-30 21:37:25 ok

general 2023-06-30 21:39:50 but sacrifice their economy, relegating it to a basic standard

plane-crazy 2023-07-02 20:35:18 something to fill the corner gap on 2 block nose
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 20:35:38 and a motor3
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 20:35:43 which means that prop planes
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 20:35:53 can connect the motors to props directly
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 20:35:59 and wont veer
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 20:36:06 so my I-15 wont veer

plane-crazy 2023-07-09 22:34:02 cant wait to show my bombardier dash 8
creations-chat 2023-07-10 00:16:08 Its a WIP bombardier dash 8, do you guys have any advice? (the wings were anglelocked)
creations-chat 2023-07-10 00:21:19 makes sense, but the wings of the real plane are about this wide, so maybe i make it longer
creations-chat 2023-07-10 00:24:41 the wings are thick, i said i was gonna make it longer so it appears thinner, also thx for showing the blueprints
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 20:26:32 im gonna make a mig 15
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 20:26:36 any ideas for scale?
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 20:27:11 thanks bro
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 20:27:20 but wht does this tell me about scale?
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 20:28:20 although it does tell me i need anglelock wings
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 20:32:23 wait
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 20:32:28 it does show the seat
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 20:32:46 if the seat is one block
plane-crazy 2023-07-12 20:32:51 i need 4 half beams
