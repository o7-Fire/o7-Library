plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:12:56 how do you make a compact turret?
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:15:18 all my turrets are ugly as hell cause of how i have to build the motors
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:17:27 if conveyors could be used as actual tank tracks
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:17:29 it would be gucci
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:18:25 i know you can use them
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:18:29 but the problem is using them to turn
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:22:43 its sad
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:22:48 that theres no real tank barrle parts
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:23:04 it would be so satisfying blowing peoples shitty planes out of the sky with HE shells
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:23:33 imagine a 40 mm bofors in the game
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:23:34 lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:24:01 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:24:58 imagine watching all the kids cry when a dude rolls up with 2 40 mm bofors cannons
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:25:56 imagine naval cannons
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:26:05 in the game
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:26:46 500mm shell with HE blowing up kids from the water
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:26:56 that sounds very epic
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:27:35 i want to make tanks but my building skills arent the greatest
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:27:49 i guess i could try making a tiger because its literally just a box
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:28:05 sure
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:28:41 thats better then all of my creations
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:29:07 you should paint it green
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:30:16 guns in the game are pretty bad
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:30:17 ngl
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:30:42 its literally just lasers
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:30:52 you cant protect against it either
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:32:10 lava is more balanced
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:32:12 then guns are
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:32:49 someone copied one of my shitty designs
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:32:53 and he made it even more shit
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:33:29 i had this drone thingy
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:33:52 and i blew this guy up like 5 times in a row lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:35:06 yea
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:35:10 my drone made out of pure explosives
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:35:18 and a couple of wings
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:35:38 yes please
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:36:31 i wanted to make this spring thing
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:36:37 that sends cutters out at ridiculous speed
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:36:48 but it doesnt work because the cutters dont do damage
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:37:33 so i need to sit on the cutter
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:37:38 inorder for it to do damage
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:38:33 also
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:38:41 if you blacklist someone you can go through them right?
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:38:54 well
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:39:02 i blacklisted someone once because they kept going into my base
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:39:28 so i made a cutter plane and i literally just flew through their vehicle and split it in half instantly
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:40:38 it seems kinda broken
plane-crazy 2020-06-27 05:41:13 i only blacklist when im building stuff in pvp
