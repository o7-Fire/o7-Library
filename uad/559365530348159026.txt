help 2022-11-05 21:41:18 ok so at some point they changed the rockets and their tracking a little bit so the legacy mode seems to have slightly better tracking but its a little bit wonky and glitchy
help 2022-11-05 21:42:01 another thing is that with tracking turned off legacy does more damage than without but its still glitchy
help 2022-11-05 21:42:53 wait no I was wrong
help 2022-11-05 21:43:19 legacy mode just increases the damage a little bit but at the same time becomes less reliable

bug-reports 2022-11-15 00:31:56 I thinks its because of copyright issues and music/audio with swears and other non PG things, but im not sure

help 2022-11-15 04:35:51 I've heard of that, but I don't think it will help considering the design is custom
help 2022-11-15 04:36:19 Also is it unclear that there is angle lock on the main part cuz there is
help 2022-11-15 04:39:31 I mean I did do a terrible job with the pictures in my opinion
help 2022-11-15 12:39:26 Well what you're asking for is either very difficult or just straight up impossible
help 2022-11-15 23:21:47 Whenever I spawn in a build that's over 5k blocks my ping just starts rising up into the hundreds of thousands. Normally when I'm just building my ping is at 50-60
help 2022-11-15 23:22:42 How can I make this not happen?
help 2022-11-15 23:54:16 its strange, but my aircraft carrier used to glitch out when on land and not on water (before it made my ping enter the equivalent of the altitude of the highest point in the exosphere in millimeters) so just have the carrier in the water
help 2022-11-16 00:01:47 no, but do you have a solution for my ping issue? https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/478584971670454284/1042217887781371904

help 2022-11-16 00:05:32 what i know is that my internet is pretty good, I have done some tests so I cant figure out what it is
help 2022-11-16 00:06:31 is there any way around that or am i just dumb for thinking there is
help 2022-11-16 00:07:28 bruh I have 50-60 ms how do you not have the problem
help 2022-11-16 00:08:30 actually, another important question: do you also have to use SR engines to fold the build because of how large it is?
help 2022-11-16 00:09:02 and so the motors aren't enough
help 2022-11-16 00:12:24 good idea
help 2022-11-16 00:16:53 it didn't work :(
help 2022-11-16 00:17:44 guess ill try removing all the SR engines
help 2022-11-16 00:21:38 in that case I think i know what the problem is

contest-chat 2022-12-08 17:18:32 since this contest is about most of the rules being the opposite, most of the submissions are gonna be troll builds, and since there's a lot of troll builds, they become normal builds, and normal builds become troll builds...
contest-chat 2022-12-09 02:04:50 you still follow the rules, its just that some of them are the opposite
contest-chat 2022-12-09 02:05:05 from what they normally are
bug-reports 2022-12-10 00:20:33 symbols that im trying to use for extra detail will work sometimes but other they get censored out
bug-reports 2022-12-10 00:20:49 is there any fix to this
bug-reports 2022-12-10 01:06:34 nevermind i figured it out
help 2022-12-10 03:33:23 That means it's too fast for its size and amount of wing panels and other things like that
help 2022-12-10 03:33:44 Although the size part isnt as important
help 2022-12-10 03:35:12 Yeah try that and see if it works
help 2022-12-10 03:36:09 As long as there is enough wing panels
help 2022-12-10 03:36:21 Can I see a picture of it?
help 2022-12-10 03:38:15 Actually, also try adding some wing panels in the front half of the plane
help 2022-12-10 03:38:24 Do that first
help 2022-12-10 03:38:30 See if it helps
help 2022-12-12 02:54:49 There's your first issue lol
help 2022-12-12 02:55:00 Try using normal engines
help 2022-12-12 02:55:21 And not glitch ones
help 2022-12-12 20:17:07 Are you angle locking
creations-chat 2022-12-18 17:31:14 i upvoted it but lemme give you 2 things:

- there's a lot of exposed motor lock
- the intakes seem a little disproportionate, they just don't seem right
help 2022-12-19 21:01:35 üíÄ
help 2022-12-20 00:34:08 nope sadly
help 2022-12-20 00:34:49 i would say 2x2 for looks, 1x1 for "roscale"
help 2022-12-22 20:30:40 How is that a question
help 2022-12-22 20:32:32 It's a plane. It has wings with control panels and elevators at the tail.
help 2022-12-22 20:33:27 YES
help 2022-12-22 20:33:38 üíÄ
creations-chat 2022-12-25 15:24:49 not bad

bug-reports 2023-01-02 05:36:23 Torque works in reverse in this game, it's contradictory to the actual definition and the speed is also gonna be a problem I would set it to like 10
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 22:33:30 whats not working, the motor or the magnet?
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 22:34:00 it might be too far away
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 22:36:56 is the weld setting on
plane-crazy 2023-01-06 22:39:49 yeah I cant tell what the problem is
creations-chat 2023-01-07 03:04:20 piston
help 2023-01-14 00:40:50 you can use a method like magnet locking or the newer offset locking to be able to get rid of the motor lock after angle locking
help 2023-01-26 01:48:14 üëç
help 2023-02-15 02:05:19 does anyone know how to get the weld setting on magnets to work? i got it to work on something small but when trying to use it on a big folding build it doesn't do anything
help 2023-02-15 02:07:36 never mind i got it to work
help 2023-02-16 14:28:16 The elevators look strangely far from the jet itself
