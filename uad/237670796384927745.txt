plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:46:33 but yeah maybe .5 will be enough
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:47:26 true
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:47:30 that would be pretty cool
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:47:46 Build N Destroy, the remake for Build Your Mech
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:48:15 i bet theyll optimize it alot though
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:48:30 maybe just make the blocks dissapear with a particle effect
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:48:42 a destruction system similar to trailmakers maybe?
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:58:49 they're probably gonna use chunk loading for that
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:59:05 kinda like how roblox AIRX 2020 has the entire earth as a map
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:59:13 they use chunk loading
creations-chat 2021-08-23 20:43:25 its a message link
creations-chat 2021-08-31 05:43:02 crap i used a gun term and the bot thought i sweared
creations-chat 2021-10-07 19:35:02 <@!268930392847941633> Man of culture. Honestly, i havent seen much wrong with your s13. Pretty much all the proportions are right. When i looked at the side view image doe i saw that the front might be a bit too blocky. Otherwise, great build!
creations-chat 2021-10-07 19:38:18 Fair fair, no problem!

<@!782046859819876384> 
you can make really good gears if you motorlock water wheels halfway into each other and motorlock trail blocks into them to actualy make them rotate the axle.

still pretty good doe
creations-chat 2021-11-01 07:16:12 i have made a few piston engines before using Hover thrusters. Basicaly theres a timing system that blocks each piston's hover thrusters at the right timing to make the engine work

heres an example of what i mean: https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/871293536987934740
(message link)


the reason why this design is really big is just cause i wanted to mess around and make the biggest boxer engine i could make for no reason lol

I'd recommend going with a boxer 4 engine. from what ive seen and tried they seem to be the most efficient
general 2021-11-11 22:13:45 ok guys watch this trick
general 2021-11-11 22:13:50 how to probably get banned in seconds
general 2021-11-11 22:13:56 loolll
general 2021-11-11 22:14:18 tried to say the name of a game that is better than plane crazy lol
general 2021-11-11 22:14:20 but they censor it
general 2021-11-11 22:14:28 you did it
general 2021-11-11 22:14:31 you can say it full caps??

general 2021-11-11 22:17:45 right
general 2021-11-11 22:18:32 Btw the dev of VC made it autocorrect plane crazy to Fortnite in his game only because pcc censors his game

general 2022-03-04 03:36:18 sci-fi better
general 2022-03-04 03:38:00 did you make this for a game you're working on or is it just a random model?
general 2022-03-04 03:38:16 oh nice
general 2022-03-04 03:38:32 i do like the fact that more people are making vehicle building games on roblox now
general 2022-03-04 03:38:50 stuff like waste of space, astrocrafts,
general 2022-03-04 03:39:25 yeah
general 2022-03-04 03:39:37 yeah
general 2022-03-04 03:39:43 i hope plane crazy 2 will have better models
general 2022-03-04 03:42:10 i like creating vehicles
general 2022-03-04 03:44:45 bruh the censorship is weird here
general 2022-03-04 03:44:52 trying to say a completely harmless name
general 2022-03-04 03:44:55 i mean
general 2022-03-04 03:44:56 word
general 2022-03-04 03:45:07 Oh nice!
general 2022-03-04 03:45:32 trueee
general 2022-03-04 03:47:03 it would be great if you made logic gates and stuff
general 2022-03-04 03:47:11 maybe even micro processors
general 2022-03-04 03:47:30 damn
general 2022-03-04 03:51:45 oh wow
general 2022-03-04 03:51:46 thats insane
general 2022-03-04 03:51:52 damn
general 2022-03-04 03:52:05 i mean i did make piston engines on plane crazy using hover thrusters before
general 2022-03-04 03:52:06 but
general 2022-03-04 03:52:07 that sounds
general 2022-03-04 03:52:10 like its way better
general 2022-03-04 03:52:22 nice
general 2022-03-04 03:55:08 man i wonder all the possibilities
general 2022-03-04 03:55:48 yeah
general 2022-03-04 03:55:51 that would be nice
general 2022-03-04 03:56:24 anyways lets not talk too much about plane crazy here since this isnt <#384021699466756107>
general 2022-03-04 03:56:31 yeah sure
general 2022-03-04 03:57:09 true
general 2022-03-04 03:57:18 maybe even give the gears settings like
general 2022-03-04 03:57:22 the ammount of teeth
general 2022-03-04 03:57:24 etc
general 2022-03-04 03:57:24 the size
general 2022-03-04 03:57:55 yeah
general 2022-03-04 03:58:28 i wonder how people would use those kinds of gear blocks for asthetics even
general 2022-03-04 03:58:38 since they would be pretty customizable
general 2022-03-04 03:58:46 true
general 2022-03-04 04:00:23 pc2 probably will get updated alot
general 2022-03-04 04:01:12 yeah
general 2022-03-04 04:01:30 so like a block that could offset whatever's welded to its head however you want?
general 2022-03-04 04:01:38 yeah
general 2022-03-04 04:04:03 true
general 2022-03-04 04:04:05 in that case
general 2022-03-04 04:04:09 they could be called like
general 2022-03-04 04:04:13 "dynamic offsetters"
general 2022-03-04 04:04:15 or something
general 2022-03-04 04:05:18 huh?
general 2022-03-04 04:05:28 are you like another dev for the game xynth is working on?
general 2022-03-04 04:06:56 well xynth posted a build he made on roblox studio
general 2022-03-04 04:06:59 we just started talking
general 2022-03-04 04:07:06 and apparently hes just working on a game
general 2022-03-04 04:07:50 yeah
general 2022-03-04 04:12:02 i feel like it would be funny if the game you were working on had a simple generic name
general 2022-03-04 04:12:05 i dont know
general 2022-03-04 04:12:09 since its a vehicle building game
general 2022-03-04 04:12:11 something like
general 2022-03-04 04:12:15 bruhh
general 2022-03-04 04:12:34 vehicle creation i guess then?
