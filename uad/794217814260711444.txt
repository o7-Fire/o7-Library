plane-crazy 2022-07-01 06:42:28 im too lazy
general 2022-07-01 06:47:40 how exactly do i get image perms again?
general 2022-07-01 06:47:53 i want to show my wip mechagodzilla in <#384021699466756107> but i only hae the verified role
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 20:48:49 how do you earn image perms?
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 20:49:04 <#925522972586967092>
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 20:59:04 its less than a block
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 20:59:07 ill find out'
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 20:59:32 less than a half block too?
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:00:35 wow its less than a half block
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:01:29 its less than the tiny half wedge too'
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:01:57 a trail block i think
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:02:23 i would show an image
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:02:26 but i dont have the perms yet
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:02:56 wait no
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:03:20 im trying to measure it with powerless motors and disconnectors
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:03:33 maybe not the best way to do it
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:03:39 its probably more than a half block
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:04:00 oh perfect
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:04:12 makes it easie to measure ig
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:04:30 way heavier than 2 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:04:32 vvtol?
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:04:38 harrier?
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:04:57 ok so its more than 2 blocks but less than 4
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:05:26 but its more 3
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:05:54 wait do individual blocks weight less than a 1x4 beam?
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:06:06 oh they do
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:06:14 i just learned something new
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:06:28 ok so its heavier than 4 blocks but lighter than a 1x4 beam
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:06:45 5 blocks is slightly heavier
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:06:49 so around 4-5 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:06:55 strictly blocks
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:07:17 but heavier than 4.5 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:07:37 i wouldnt trust my testing that much but you can go off of that
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:08:13 so yeah person + seat ~= 4.5-5
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:08:42 4 blocks + 1 wedge is heavier
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:08:50 i assume 4 blocks + 1 wedge is the same as 4.5
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:08:52 but
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:08:56 a half block
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 21:08:58 idk anymore

help 2022-07-01 21:35:12 this is what im building btw
help 2022-07-01 21:35:22 
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 00:24:15 they should make it so smoke machines dont turn on instantly but require a key to start them instead of the other way around
bot-central 2022-07-02 00:25:10 ?shelp
bot-central 2022-07-02 00:27:01 &suggest Add a feature in the smoke/snow pipes that allows them to either start instantly when a building is launched or requires a key to start after you launch a building 
(basically so you dont have to turn off smoke pipes as soon as you launch a building )
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 00:27:11 im a whitename
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 00:27:14 cant
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 00:27:20 sweet
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 00:27:20 oh i finally got pic pertms though

help 2022-07-02 04:02:45 what does the torque do on motors?
help 2022-07-02 04:19:15 alr thanks my dad told me what it was awhile ago but I didnt understand it at the time
help 2022-07-02 04:19:24 i mean i probably couldve just googled it
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 04:49:41 who knew making fake hydraulics was hard
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 05:57:04 it begins
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 05:57:19 i hate having to make replica reflected legs
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 05:57:30 especially because the design i made has so many things packed into it
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 06:41:42 
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 07:58:00 
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 08:04:54 its almost done
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 08:27:30 good idea
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 08:27:44 but incase something goes wrong in the design i dont want to have to remake something twice
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 08:27:47 so i do one leg
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 08:27:51 then reverse the process on the other
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 08:27:58 its almost done anyways
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 08:47:09 finally
help 2022-07-02 08:55:23 anyone have any ideas on how to make this walk?
help 2022-07-02 08:55:30 like where would i put the motors and such
help 2022-07-02 08:55:45 i already have motors installed in the legs
help 2022-07-02 08:55:48 i just like
help 2022-07-02 08:55:53 i nee dit in the ankles and top legs
help 2022-07-02 08:57:15 i might need to remove the fake hydraulics because they block movement
help 2022-07-02 09:31:41 yeah
help 2022-07-02 09:31:45 but
help 2022-07-02 09:31:48 any tips for now?
help 2022-07-02 09:31:50 im too far in
help 2022-07-02 09:42:43 its too stable to where i cant make it move
help 2022-07-02 09:47:04 or maybe he doesnt have a tailblade?
help 2022-07-02 09:47:13 i mean it sounds like common knowledge but who knows
help 2022-07-02 09:47:19 maybe he doesnt know
help 2022-07-02 09:51:32 you havnet?

plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:08:18 mecha g progress
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:08:42 with my favorite stomach rockets
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:08:57 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:09:41 too bad they didnt show the stomach rockets in the movie
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:09:48 i love these
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:09:55 but the shoulder cannons are gonna be cooler
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:10:36 also
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:10:40 you cna always do better
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:10:46 the way i learned to build was watching tutorails
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:10:48 not doing them
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:10:52 or just watching showcases
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:11:01 you can learn how some blocks can work together
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:11:15 üëç
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:11:33 thats good
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:11:40 i love that
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:11:56 you dont need big planes or mechs to build good
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:12:00 do what you want
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:12:03 i guess
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:12:53 did you post it before?
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:13:02 i hope my mecha g makes it to the hall of fame
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:13:10 alr
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:13:15 idk
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:13:25 ive seen some good builds that havent made it to the hall of fame
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:13:29 most hof builds are large
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:13:32 mine is medium sized
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:13:38 well definitely large
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:13:46 but compared to the other things its medium
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:14:26 its my redemption for my other canceled project
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:14:28 ill show you inabit
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:14:40 also the legs are surprisingly very sturdy
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:15:07 oh the pelican is cool'
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:15:30 i learned all good looking builds have some sort of like
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:15:32 angling
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:15:39 tutorials ae boring
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:15:47 oh
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:15:52 use motor 2s
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:15:54 on servo and toggly
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:15:58 thats how i make my legs work
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:16:22 im trying to load in my old mecha g project
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:16:31 
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:16:37 its too large and glitchy
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:16:44 its also less stable than the other one
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:17:03 
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:17:13 theres only like 2 motor locked things in this
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:17:17 and its not even advanced
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:17:23 its all about those motor 2s
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:18:01 on the project?
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:18:03 https://medal.tv/games/roblox/clips/qQD3ftiJcVY5b/d13379KWUl8Q?invite=cr-MSw2cm4sNjAzNjYwNDks
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:18:05 this is it
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:18:27 oh yeah it has this weird bobbing problem
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:18:55 this guy is shooting it down
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:19:02 havent figured out yet
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:19:05 when i try making it walk
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:19:08 ill try to find a way
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:19:49 hopefully pc2 comes with more advanced stuff
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:19:54 fixed motors and such
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:20:09 the thing i fear about this build is making the tail
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:20:19 i think they said its coming
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:20:25 your builds will be transfered
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:22:15 BULLET SHOWER
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:22:17 caps oops
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:22:49 its just this guy
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:22:53 that would be cool
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:22:55 add lights too
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:22:57 make it glow
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:23:30 id say its alright
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:23:33 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:23:38 or even multi colored
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:23:39 like
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:23:48 you can have a motor spinning inside with the lgihts
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:23:57 so its like a rave kinda
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:24:44 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:31:09 i wonder how people'ls builds with locked motors are gonna do
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:31:21 they are gonna add a replacement block for the current locked motors right?
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:31:31 because that would destroy so many builds
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:32:26 oh
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:32:29 so
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:32:31 theres gonna be like
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:32:36 a new setting in replacement for it
plane-crazy 2022-07-03 10:32:59 wait whats the post about them fixing locked motors then

plane-crazy 2022-07-04 22:35:45 sound effects on the mechagodzilla are eh
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 22:36:23 the part i fear the most of is making the tail and making this thing walk
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 22:36:51 im currently making the arms but i stopped to add in most of the sound effects needed
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 06:40:25 ill be finished with this like next week
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 06:42:38 man why they gotta make mg21's tail so long though
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 06:51:11 i know
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 06:51:14 longest tail
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 06:51:20 imagine making that beam in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 06:51:26 i mean you could use juse cameras and blue trails
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 06:51:28 to make the circles
plane-crazy 2022-07-07 06:51:32 i would love to see that
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 05:07:24 anyone got tips for the tail?
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 05:07:32 making mg21 currently
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 05:07:40 hold on let me get a pic of the tail
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 05:08:10 
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 05:08:20 it also has a problem of bouncing back and foward on the knee hinges
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 05:08:30 
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 05:10:53 yes
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 05:13:35 i was using that
plane-crazy 2022-08-22 05:43:52 8 afternoons with fredrick
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 20:17:34 Kid named finger
general 2023-02-10 06:26:35 wasnt plane crazy 2 supposed to come out last year or is it this year
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 23:57:50 is there any way to make pistons move faster?
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 23:58:16 im working on my mechagodzilla project after like a year of not touching the game
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 23:58:47 the rockets on the back kinda move outwards when the rear boosters open up but i want the pistons to move a little faster
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 20:40:59 does anyone know why this part randomly turns either left or right?
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 20:41:00 let me uh
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 20:41:03 get a picture
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 20:41:13 its motor 2 servo toggles
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 20:41:27 i need it to rotate the other way
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 20:41:32 sometimes it does
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 20:41:43 both motors are set on opposite reverse and foward settings
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 20:43:51 
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 20:43:56 its very random
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 20:44:03 i dont know why it does that
help 2023-05-19 21:31:51 does anyone know how fast pistons move
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 21:46:24 real
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 21:46:35 its my mechagodzilla project
plane-crazy 2023-05-19 21:46:45 
help 2023-05-20 03:22:14 which mechagodzilla is that
help 2023-05-20 03:22:28 i know its been like over a year but i was just browsing through old builds
creations-chat 2023-05-20 03:34:29 my mechagodzilla project
creations-chat 2023-05-20 05:53:44 cant wait to finish it
creations-chat 2023-05-20 15:47:22 mechagodzilla project
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 23:42:47 why dont they have a toggle option for smoke machines
plane-crazy 2023-05-26 23:42:54 would be so convinient
creations-chat 2023-05-27 04:00:34 progress on my mechagodzilla project

yall think this will make HOF when finished?
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 04:46:47 does anyone know what the fixed setting does on smoke machines?
creations-chat 2023-05-27 04:51:41 i feel like when i finish i should just wait for pc2 to drop or wait for the server to become active again because i dont want this to become lost like a lot of other amazing creations
creations-chat 2023-05-27 05:15:40 real
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 21:35:41 does anyone know how to make like
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 21:35:43 a piston that
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 21:35:44 hmm
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 21:35:52 starts off extended then retracts
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 21:35:58 or just a retracting system in general
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 21:36:05 i was thinking of a rope and suspension
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 21:36:07 but
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 21:36:09 not really a fan of that
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 21:39:05 i need this part to like
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 21:39:11 retract backwards to show the rockets better
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 22:12:11 i thought about that
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 22:12:14 i just uh
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 22:12:24 found a different way to do it
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 22:12:38 give me a second
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 22:13:27 i extended the pistons in the rockets
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 22:13:28 because
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 22:13:35 the back opens up partially to reveal thrusters
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 22:13:41 this is for my mechagodzilla project btw
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 22:14:05 its not movie accurate as i wanted it to be but it was the best i couldve done in this game
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 22:14:28 in the movie the sides kinda slide back to retract to reveal the rockets
plane-crazy 2023-05-27 22:14:35 but theres no technology like that in plane crazy
creations-chat 2023-05-28 01:31:19 more progress on the mechagodzilla project
creations-chat 2023-05-28 02:06:48 1 player compared to the size of the build so far
creations-chat 2023-05-28 02:19:55 the only issue is that i made the current torso (its aobut 2/3 built) too tall so i dont know if its going to make it look too akward.
i cant go back though so ill have to work with what i have
creations-chat 2023-05-28 02:24:26 the back now has covers, the reason i take long is because i have to go through many different designs and adjust 1 pixel issues because theres so many motors

most of the time im really just experimenting and tuning the motors to make sure it fits right

after im done with the bottom area of the torso you will start to see changes to the build
creations-chat 2023-05-28 08:16:20 is this better?

i think its too chunky though, i tried to slim it down and it seems to be an accurate scale compared to the legs but it still seems too big
creations-chat 2023-05-28 08:28:46 i love that, is that the 2021 version or a different one? it kinda lookslike the ready plyer one version to me
creations-chat 2023-05-28 08:31:11 i think the top of the head is too round, it sohuld be more sharper like this
other than that it looks amazing

also if you want i can show you how to make a laser beam that i learned from one of the HOF builders
creations-chat 2023-05-28 23:23:52 does anyone know how to fix this? 
im trying to fold to the top of my mechagodzilla but no matter what settings i put on the motor it keeps going downwards, bcakwards or foward, max torque or not, it wont move upwards

nvm i partially have it figured out, when i fold i normally use motor 2s on servo and toggle, but i guess for this case i have to use standard motors for it to fold

if anyone does know why this phenomenon happens i would like to know
help 2023-05-29 05:34:31 what do ballast tanks do?
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 05:39:19 what do ballast tanks do?
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 05:54:59 longer?
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 11:51:16 Ballast tanks right?
plane-crazy 2023-05-29 11:51:19 Not the beams
creations-chat 2023-05-30 13:27:38 the arms are taking place now
theres going to be so many controls so i will probably have a friend also hook up a keyboard to the pc so we can both control it like some pacific rim type thing
a majority of the keys on my full sized keyboard are already taken and i havent made a lot of other features
creations-chat 2023-05-30 13:35:17 the only blocky part is the back i think

i plan on redesigning the back parts once im done with everything else
creations-chat 2023-06-01 07:05:40 first part of the right arm complete
hopefully i can finish the whole arm tomorrow

creations-chat 2023-06-02 03:41:35 Real
creations-chat 2023-06-02 03:44:19 I think just the lower needs to be wider

creations-chat 2023-06-04 22:32:43 do you guys think this upper chest area is good enough or should i change it

something seems off about it but i cant really tell what
creations-chat 2023-06-04 22:49:47 besides the gap in the middle
creations-chat 2023-06-04 22:51:49 you said that last time
creations-chat 2023-06-04 22:54:54 is it that far off?

i could make the lower waist wider ig
creations-chat 2023-06-04 23:02:37 yeah i think that did the trick
creations-chat 2023-06-05 01:31:51 which side looks better? left or right

creations-chat 2023-06-05 03:15:39 how much would decent amount of pistons be
creations-chat 2023-06-05 03:21:52 my mecha g is 5k blocks and has like 6 or 8 pistons
creations-chat 2023-06-05 03:26:07 it perfectly works but it starts to slide backwards after i completely launch it

which is 80% probably from all the motorlocking and motors overall
