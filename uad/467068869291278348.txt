plane-crazy 2020-10-18 23:37:09 My brain is hurting from trying to build a plane wing
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 06:04:45 I made a giant pumpkin
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 06:04:57 Does anybody know how I can make it...fly?
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 06:05:09 n o
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 06:05:14 not like that
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 06:05:24 I saw a flying minecraft ghast today in the game
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 06:05:35 so I decided to make a pumpkin version of it
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 06:05:44 I think so
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 06:05:53 No I mean
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 06:05:59 I dont think heliume because
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 06:06:03 it needs to be controllable
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 06:06:11 Oh. Actually heliume might help
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 06:06:43 Wha-
help 2020-10-19 06:16:48 Anyone know how I can get this thing to fly?
help 2020-10-19 06:18:01 Ah yes
help 2020-10-19 06:18:10 I am doing this because I saw a giant minecraft ghast ingame today
help 2020-10-19 06:18:30 But I got no clue how to setup all the mechanics and stuff
help 2020-10-19 06:24:11 Do I just place the helium blocks in the corners and stuff?
help 2020-10-19 06:26:01 Where do I put the rocket thrusters?
help 2020-10-19 06:30:19 like this?
help 2020-10-19 06:31:55 Oh so just the opposite of what I did?
help 2020-10-19 06:39:33 I did this, then flipped them around and added them to the top, is this right?
help 2020-10-19 06:42:52 I tried it AND THE TOP FELL ON ME LOL
help 2020-10-19 06:43:00 The entire roof just collapsed onto me
help 2020-10-19 06:44:02 I dont really know how to do that, I thought placing blocks together just attaches
help 2020-10-19 06:44:52 Oh...I think I know the problem...
help 2020-10-19 06:46:55 I think it's because of the way I built it
help 2020-10-19 06:57:57 Yeah ima just continue tommorow. bye
