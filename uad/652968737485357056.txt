creations-chat 2021-12-13 08:46:32 <@!723940197456281640> the flaps are like that since when there was no gap they would jam up during flight. <@!707953054489509978> yes I will work on the paint when I feel like it. <@!441939688018935818> and how would I go on to fix propeller?

creations-chat 2021-12-19 21:53:14 My me 163
I have improved the back mode the tail fin blend in with the body and also fixed exposed motor lock. (top 4 new and bottom 4 old) Is there anything else I could improve upon?
creations-chat 2021-12-19 22:00:48 <@!487056388451729418> the color is bad since it’s just the simple paint that threw on with zero effort I will eventually actually paint it. Also I will improve upon the spine it does look pretty strange so I will just angle lock it rather than just use the in game wedges.
creations-chat 2021-12-25 01:48:07 Does my new bv 238 look better than my old one so far?

creations-chat 2022-02-23 20:04:06 Okay I don’t paint when I’m building. And i obviously don’t have the entire bottom done since I’m not done yet, I was just wondering if how I angled it looked okay.

creations-chat 2022-02-23 20:06:49 What’s too fat about it
Like the entire thing or the bottom?
creations-chat 2022-02-23 20:10:35 Yea it’s a bit fat since I had to base it around the rotor. Plus I had to make it so the bottom and top of the body was connected through the rotor which was hard to do. So don’t be mean to it about it gaining a couple pounds.
creations-chat 2022-02-23 20:12:40 That’s what I did.

creations-chat 2022-02-23 20:42:10 Yea I know I’ll have to fix that if I ever feel like maybe working on it again.
creations-chat 2022-02-23 20:44:17 But it’s a Martin SeaMaster.

And sorry that my flaps arnt angled, I just didn’t have enough room to do so. Any feedback on what I can improve will be appreciated.

creations-chat 2022-05-16 00:53:33 I have now made my Triebflugel semi functional. But I dislike my tail wings so I plan on redoing them but others I think it’s fine, and if not than tell me why.

creations-chat 2022-06-26 02:12:33 Thank you.
creations-chat 2022-06-26 04:57:24 I mean the build is just a bit of motor lock and angle lock that spins and than just multiple key binds to drop the bombs, really isn’t that interesting or cool.
creations-chat 2022-06-26 05:05:15 Yeah japan and Germany are pretty experienced with explosive airplanes.
creations-chat 2022-06-26 05:08:13 The me 163 is pretty much just a ticking time bomb in the air.

creations-chat 2022-06-27 19:43:23 Yeah but emeralds are more shinny and rare and in Egypt they where precious gemstones and the manifest of beauty.

creations-chat 2022-09-19 21:15:39 I have no idea.
creations-chat 2022-09-19 21:23:26 I just think it doesn’t look that great, I would suggest to make its look more realistic.
creations-chat 2022-09-19 21:27:41 I mean it is shit, I was trying to be nice and tell you how to improve it.
creations-chat 2022-09-19 22:34:45 Is this a 1000x1000x1000 or is it a Horten 229?

creations-chat 2022-12-07 04:34:12 How do I spin the rotor without causing any torque? Also should fix the cockpit.
creations-chat 2022-12-07 04:42:31 I do but it still has torque
creations-chat 2022-12-07 12:06:19 Yeah I am using a unpowered motor,I designed it so it wasn’t colliding with the fuselage, I’ll make sure to try out hover engines
creations-chat 2022-12-07 22:08:57 Alright I used hover engines and it only made it worse
creations-chat 2022-12-07 22:12:47 Makes sense.
I can remove a lot of weight from the blades now that I removed all the wing panels and thrust.
creations-chat 2022-12-07 22:35:21 Alright I removed over 125 blocks from the blades but it only got worse but that might just be caused by the speed it’s spinning as well as the thrust to weight ratio now.
creations-chat 2022-12-07 22:38:56 Here is the before and after
creations-chat 2022-12-07 22:41:41 Yeah on iPad. ||I am past the point of clinically insane.||
creations-chat 2022-12-07 22:45:23 It actually took less time than my other builds.
<@761354294859005962> 
It’s not really laggy other than being 4,254 blocks.
creations-chat 2022-12-07 22:48:30 It spanned over a couple weeks but I would assume the hours worked on it would be around 1-2 days
<@761354294859005962> yeah you wouldn’t want to be around me since I have a zeppelin that is 14k blocks.
creations-chat 2022-12-07 22:52:09 Yeah I could probably find the amount of weeks by looking at progress photos.
<@761354294859005962> yeah and it’s not laggy at all, maybe I just have a super iPad idk.
creations-chat 2022-12-07 22:58:48 Yeah a lot of my builds are mediocore since I only just started building really good builds.
Edit.
Most of my builds were large builds compared to what I do now.
<@568036773750505502> 
Yeah I started it in August 25 and finished in September 19 after that I started tweaking it slowly.
creations-chat 2022-12-07 23:05:32 Yeah I also started in 2019 and have 70 days of playtime. This is also my first build which was big (only photo I have of it)
<@761354294859005962> this is probably most best short time build only taking around 2 hours (the jet)
creations-chat 2022-12-07 23:09:55 It was based off of this luft 46 plane, (Focke-Wulf TA 283)
Edit (12,11,2022) changed 282 to 283.
creations-chat 2022-12-07 23:18:10 Also nice A-10
creations-chat 2022-12-07 23:21:34 Yeah no problem. But the tail seems to be a little too long.

Can you give me a reason to why you disliked my build so I can improve on it?

creations-chat 2022-12-17 21:46:39 Because why not I have removed a lot of byproduct my Triebflugel produced, I lowered the block count by 50 blocks, for connecting the body I switched to using all signs instead of signs and trails, and finally I did a minor change to the blades so they don’t look as ugly.

I plan on angle locking the cockpit and that’s pretty much it.
Also any suggestions on what else I should do would be nice.

creations-chat 2023-02-26 21:33:20 Can you help with my mathing
creations-chat 2023-02-26 21:39:34 Okay zero help thanks guys 👍
creations-chat 2023-02-26 21:54:42 My math is good now
creations-chat 2023-02-26 23:03:38 Okay yeah I found the mistake which was because I thought a piston at 1.25 equaled a block but it was double that so I am in the process of fixing it all.
creations-chat 2023-02-26 23:06:45 Pretty much
creations-chat 2023-02-27 00:41:06 The back look good?
creations-chat 2023-02-27 00:44:29 I would only be able to add depth to the middle thruster since the side thruster are smaller than the middle one
Also the back is completely flat
creations-chat 2023-02-27 00:49:46 It would be hard to do since it’s 2.87 blocks wide and 1.44 blocks tall and also how do I use trails for the engines I’m curious about that idea
Also yeah it’s fine if I use pistons since I already used some
And yeah it’s for the grind
creations-chat 2023-02-27 00:53:23 Oh well. So it’s good so far?
creations-chat 2023-02-27 00:57:44 Okay yeah I’ll make the outer circles smaller
And what do you mean by slight curve?
This is a different model engine but it doesn’t have a curve at the top it’s flat.
creations-chat 2023-02-27 01:01:27 I don’t really see it unless you mean lengthwise of the aircraft
Also thanks for giving actual feedback
creations-chat 2023-02-27 01:06:21 Hmm okay I’ll take a deeper look into it
I’ll ask other people for their opinions too since the more the merrier
creations-chat 2023-02-27 01:30:39 It’s been 50/50 with people saying it’s flat or curved

general 2023-02-27 14:01:46 Bomb America
general 2023-02-27 14:10:08 The Silbervogel was intended to fly long distances in a series of short hops. The aircraft was to have begun its mission propelled along a 3 km (2 mi) long rail track by a large rocket-powered sled to about 1,930 km/h (1,200 mph). Once airborne, it was to fire its own rocket engine and continue to climb to an altitude of 145 km (90 mi), at which point it would be travelling at about 21,800 km/h (13,500 mph). It would then gradually descend into the stratosphere, where the increasing air density would generate lift against the flat underside of the aircraft, eventually causing it to "bounce" and gain altitude again, where this pattern would be repeated. Because of aerodynamic drag, each bounce would be shallower than the preceding one, but it was still calculated that the Silbervogel would be able to cross the Atlantic, deliver a 4,000 kg (8,800 lb) bomb to the continental United States, and then continue its flight to a landing site somewhere in the Empire of Japan–held Pacific, a total journey of 19,000 to 24,000 km (12,000 to 15,000 mi).

creations-chat 2023-04-12 01:50:52 I kill you
creations-chat 2023-04-12 01:52:57 Yeah I have noticed that
creations-chat 2023-04-15 03:44:27 I’ve stumbled upon gold.
creations-chat 2023-04-15 04:07:18 Very time consuming work
creations-chat 2023-04-16 05:49:20 List everything wrong with this plane, so I can fix it.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 05:52:02 Yeah I agree
creations-chat 2023-04-16 05:56:00 I also have to move the wheels up by like a block and a half, and make the back wheels bigger since it looks hella ugly with all the wheels the same size same.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 06:00:50 I will most likely have to move where the tail angles further up on the body
creations-chat 2023-04-16 06:02:57 And move the cockpit back a block
creations-chat 2023-04-16 06:05:10 Agreed it looks like shit
creations-chat 2023-04-16 06:11:14 Yeah but I just really want to make the me 323 as perfect as I can since to me it’s just such a unique and cool plane, and I am feeling like I’m letting myself down by not having it fixed when I had such a long time to do so, and the fact that I know I can do better but instead I’m just being lazy.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 06:24:39 Yeah I need to push the front of the main wings back by a block and angle it since it’s not currently angled, also I need to extend the main wing backwards by I’d say maybe 3 blocks and angle it more.
For the engines I need to make it so it’s 3 bladed and make the propellers custom instead of being made out of angled wing panels, also I would like to angle the engines so they are more round in shape as well as fix those god damn engine covers.
For the tail wings I should push them up a block and definitely angle them more and for the tail fin definitely make it less ugly.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 16:55:01 My biggest creation is 13.7k blocks
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:02:58 Show
