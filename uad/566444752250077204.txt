bug-reports 2020-02-04 10:00:40 I tried
general 2020-02-04 21:19:15 Yeah
general 2020-02-04 21:19:27 Lmao even worse
general 2020-02-04 21:19:35 2080s can’t handle all games 60fps 4K
general 2020-02-04 21:20:01 I play 20gps on most games
general 2020-02-04 21:20:06 Got a gtx 760
general 2020-02-04 21:20:19 Lmao
general 2020-02-04 21:20:35 Is it like an itx form factor
general 2020-02-04 21:21:08 1440p is the sweet spot
general 2020-02-04 21:21:18 High res and high fps
general 2020-02-04 21:22:28 1440p high refresh rate is good
general 2020-02-04 21:22:52 No
general 2020-02-04 21:22:57 70hz isn’t high
general 2020-02-04 21:23:00 I mean 144hz
general 2020-02-04 21:25:42 The 2080 super fan only get 100fps fortnite 1440p
general 2020-02-04 21:26:17 1440p 144hz ok enough
general 2020-02-04 21:26:24 Your gpu won’t power 4K 144hz
general 2020-02-04 21:26:31 120hz if it’s an iPad Pro
general 2020-02-04 21:26:40 Wdym
general 2020-02-04 21:26:46 On what Roblox?
general 2020-02-04 21:27:06 I askednoctua
general 2020-02-04 21:27:20 Welll if you play the newest things your barely gonna get over 70 FPS
general 2020-02-04 21:27:23 With 4K
general 2020-02-04 21:27:29 Do Trimester under 60
general 2020-02-04 21:29:07 High refresh rate is much better for gaming than 4k
general 2020-02-04 21:29:33 Because your 2080 can’t handle both
general 2020-02-04 21:29:48 It can barely get over 60fps on most games
general 2020-02-04 21:29:54 Except like fortnite and stuff
general 2020-02-04 21:29:58 Yes buy a crt

general 2020-02-04 21:30:50 And don’t miss much
general 2020-02-04 21:31:27 I usually sniper with awm or mowing
general 2020-02-04 21:31:30 Mosin
general 2020-02-04 21:31:40 There’s lots of ultrawides
general 2020-02-04 21:31:44 Same
general 2020-09-08 11:24:42 Does having a flat front of vertical stabiliser have lots of drag
general 2020-09-08 11:25:00 Or does rear of wing create negative pressure and cancel it
general 2020-09-08 11:25:07 In this game
general 2020-09-08 11:25:36 I never had any robux in the first place lol

general 2020-09-08 11:28:06 500 injuries
general 2020-09-08 11:28:24 The pilots rammed into crowd
general 2020-09-08 11:28:36 Kk
general 2020-09-08 11:28:43 IMO the 2002 Ukraine one is saddest
general 2020-09-08 11:28:54 For which one?
general 2020-09-08 11:29:06 28 kids died btw
general 2020-09-08 11:29:34 I investigated it a few years ago
general 2020-09-08 11:29:42 He did hit the ground but at a lower angle
general 2020-09-08 11:30:14 He at that bank but more flat
general 2020-09-08 11:30:34 Ukraine*
general 2020-09-08 11:30:36 Why
general 2020-09-08 11:30:45 Don’t watch it then
general 2020-09-08 11:30:51 There’s a warning
general 2020-09-08 11:31:08 Kk didn’t know you couldn’t post
general 2020-09-08 11:31:24 “Use common sense”
general 2020-09-08 11:31:30 There’s a warning prior to the video
general 2020-09-08 11:31:49 Didn’t know you couldn’t
general 2020-09-08 11:31:59 Well of course
general 2020-09-08 11:32:09 A kid with severed limbs isn’t very good at all
general 2020-09-08 11:32:10 No
general 2020-09-08 11:32:18 It’s the worst disaster at an air show in history
general 2020-09-08 11:32:25 (Except 9 11)
general 2020-09-08 11:32:34 You stupid?
general 2020-09-08 11:32:37 I did already
general 2020-09-08 11:32:49 Yes
general 2020-09-08 11:33:04 Oops didn’t delete then
general 2020-09-08 11:33:08 I clicked delete but didn’t work
general 2020-09-08 11:33:57 Reason?
general 2020-09-08 11:34:20 I know
general 2020-09-08 11:34:27 I already said I deleted
general 2020-09-08 11:34:35 I’m just asking why you’re bothering me about it so much
general 2020-09-08 11:34:43 Are you not allowed to view it?
general 2020-09-08 11:35:09 100 Million people died in WW2 but you can still watch footage
general 2020-09-08 11:35:17 I watched the video when I was 11
general 2020-09-08 11:35:50 They did worse than that
general 2020-09-08 11:36:03 They legitimately burnt people in ovens
general 2020-09-08 11:36:22 Stop bothering me about it
general 2020-09-08 11:36:30 I never said soldiers
general 2020-09-08 11:36:34 Concentration camp
general 2020-09-08 11:36:40 Did I say server?
general 2020-09-08 11:36:55 Wdym their child
general 2020-09-08 11:37:11 As I said why should gore be censored?
general 2020-09-08 11:37:18 Complete censorship
general 2020-09-08 11:37:28 I watched when I was 11
general 2020-09-08 11:37:31 As I said
general 2020-09-08 11:37:48 You told me 10x xD
general 2020-09-08 11:37:56 Do you understand no one showed me this?
general 2020-09-08 11:37:59 I found it myself
general 2020-09-08 11:38:15 I was mature early
general 2020-09-08 11:38:33 Why not
general 2020-09-08 11:38:36 I already asked
general 2020-09-08 11:38:59 This happens a lot and can discourage you from going in line of plane during dive in crash
general 2020-09-08 11:39:04 Read YouTube rules?
general 2020-09-08 11:39:16 We’re not talking about the server
general 2020-09-08 11:39:20 I already deleted
general 2020-09-08 11:39:25 We’re talking about YouTube
general 2020-09-08 11:39:52 Also I talked about it because someone else stated a plane crash
general 2020-09-08 11:40:19 Exact,y
general 2020-09-08 11:40:28 That pilot is stupid
general 2020-09-08 11:40:35 Risking lives for a trick

general 2020-09-08 11:41:10 Ree
general 2020-09-08 11:41:22 Stop forcefully changing conversation noob
general 2020-09-08 11:41:30 Answer is E btw
general 2020-09-08 11:41:36 You want a ban?
general 2020-09-08 11:41:43 I wasn’t tslkjng about controversial
general 2020-09-08 11:42:01 It’s not murder
general 2020-09-08 11:42:07 It’s man slaughter
general 2020-09-08 11:42:22 It’s not 9/11, it’s an air show
general 2020-09-08 11:42:33 End conversation about this done
general 2020-09-08 11:42:43 Then stop bothering me about it
general 2020-09-08 11:42:58 Deleted it like 5m before you stopped berating me for discussing it
general 2020-09-08 11:43:25 Why can others discuss it then
general 2020-09-08 11:43:42 Someone posted a different air show crash but did not get a single warning
general 2020-09-08 11:43:49 Just before I did
general 2020-09-08 11:43:57 Scroll up
general 2020-09-08 11:44:21 Because you said the video should be banned
general 2020-09-08 11:44:30 Or someone else did
general 2020-09-08 11:44:39 YouTube allows far worse content
general 2020-09-08 11:44:47 Why did other person post it?
general 2020-09-08 11:44:52 I posted it because he did
general 2020-09-08 11:45:03 Is2 is glorious

general 2020-09-08 12:41:31 https://youtu.be/zjJ1lK9oAyI

general 2020-09-08 12:43:27 Its not bypass
general 2020-09-08 12:43:32 Rules state no swearing
general 2020-09-08 12:43:40 xD
general 2020-09-08 12:43:50 Well that’s just the bot
general 2020-09-08 12:44:06 Rules don’t state so
general 2020-09-08 12:44:09 No it does not
general 2020-09-08 12:44:16 You can’t edit the bot much
general 2020-09-08 12:44:24 So if it doesn’t like it, it gets banned
general 2020-09-08 12:44:36 Also what’s the issue, are you getting offended?
general 2020-09-08 12:44:55 I’m just stating something happening in game

general 2020-09-08 12:45:49 I copied the rules and pasted
general 2020-09-08 12:46:01 Apparently they’re “offensive” xD
general 2020-09-08 12:46:57 Understand*
general 2020-09-08 12:48:33 You didn’t read
general 2020-09-08 12:48:39 It says your creations may not contain
general 2020-09-08 12:48:48 Not “you cannot state”
general 2020-09-08 12:48:56 There’s a separate part for that idiot
general 2020-09-08 12:49:20 Btw can there be ugliest build competition?
general 2020-09-08 12:49:39 Holy German Empire was very cool
general 2020-09-08 12:50:00

general 2020-09-10 10:15:45 Exactly
general 2020-09-10 10:15:51 It’s for historical accuracy
general 2020-09-10 10:16:05 Cringe wehraboo ape

general 2020-09-10 10:17:04 Cuz there’s always this one idiot that walks up and says “iS tHat aN aBraMs” at a t90
general 2020-09-10 10:17:15 The only thing to stop that is hammer and sickle or Russian flag
general 2020-09-10 10:17:47 
general 2020-09-10 10:17:59 oMg is ThAt a M1a2

general 2020-09-10 10:19:54 7.7*
general 2020-09-10 10:20:32 I hate the Tiger H1
general 2020-09-10 10:20:36 It’s a bias
general 2020-09-10 10:22:08 I have up to T62B
general 2020-09-10 10:22:12 That’s my best
general 2020-09-10 10:22:42 T64B*

general 2020-09-10 10:23:29 No but the gun’s good
general 2020-09-10 10:23:48 Armour is only 420mm on UFP
general 2020-09-10 10:24:01 430 on turret
general 2020-09-10 10:24:36 Good at what type?

general 2020-09-29 07:01:49 
general 2020-09-29 07:01:54 Beautiful
general 2020-09-29 07:02:26 He’s kamikazi-ing people off the map Rn
general 2020-09-29 07:03:00 M22 is a nice tank ngl
general 2020-09-29 07:03:14 What are you up to on us tech tree?
general 2020-09-29 07:03:40 Is4m and t54
general 2020-09-29 07:04:20 
general 2020-09-29 07:05:45 Btw is that allowed
general 2020-09-29 07:05:54 Very nice
general 2020-09-29 07:06:17 Kk
general 2020-09-29 07:06:30 I don’t report people generally unless they hack
general 2020-09-29 07:06:58 
general 2020-09-29 07:07:00 Can someone pls build this
general 2020-09-29 07:07:14 Interesting
general 2020-09-29 07:10:08 Contra rotating*
general 2020-09-29 07:12:09 
general 2020-09-29 07:12:11 Kinda impressive
general 2020-09-29 07:12:25 I play USSR
general 2020-09-29 07:12:40 Panther needs a nerf
general 2020-09-29 07:13:38 It’s distorted tho
general 2020-09-29 07:15:13 Panther got down br to 5.3
general 2020-09-29 07:15:26 Often verses kv 1 and 2
general 2020-09-29 07:15:38 It can kill anything else without trap shots
general 2020-09-29 07:15:47 It has 190mm pen
general 2020-09-29 07:15:56 Glorious
general 2020-09-29 07:16:08 Tell me how a kv1 is supposed to kill from long range
general 2020-09-29 07:17:04 The Is4m can be trapshotted
general 2020-09-29 07:17:08 Why isn’t it be 4 then?
general 2020-09-29 07:17:12 Br4*
general 2020-09-29 07:17:24 Also the mere fact it needs to be trspshotted means it’s op
general 2020-09-29 07:17:31 Unless it’s slow or gun is poor
general 2020-09-29 07:17:39 Panther has lack of weak spot
general 2020-09-29 07:17:49 Is4 is easier to kill from my experience
general 2020-09-29 07:18:02 Turret is extremely strong
general 2020-09-29 07:18:12 German bias never lets shells for through
general 2020-09-29 07:18:24 Basically every shell hits the 190mm part
general 2020-09-29 07:18:32 I alrwxy know clown
general 2020-09-29 07:18:35 But they don’t work
general 2020-09-29 07:18:42 Center and very right of turret
general 2020-09-29 07:18:58 I’m br 8 and my least favourite vehicle to vs is the panther
general 2020-09-29 07:19:44 Turret shot doesn’t kill all crew
general 2020-09-29 07:19:58 T34 57 only has 27 g of explosive
general 2020-09-29 07:20:04 I know I already stated the weak spots
general 2020-09-29 07:20:16 It’s basically the only tank you can’t one shot
general 2020-09-29 07:20:47 Well for the panthers opponents it doesn’t need to aim for weakspots
general 2020-09-29 07:20:53 T34 85 has 80mm armour
general 2020-09-29 07:20:57 Panther has 190mm pen
general 2020-09-29 07:21:29 You’re required to be stealthy in a t34
general 2020-09-29 07:21:49 Panther is about as fast as t34 but ok
general 2020-09-29 07:22:05 I have the panther myself
general 2020-09-29 07:22:09 It’s op imo
general 2020-09-29 07:22:20 Most players can’t
general 2020-09-29 07:22:38 E.g when versing Germany I generally win 20-30 percent of the time
general 2020-09-29 07:22:46 What’s your point?
general 2020-09-29 07:22:52 I didn’t say it’s unkillable
general 2020-09-29 07:23:17 It is compared to killing other tanks
general 2020-09-29 07:23:47 Is the tiger 2 br 5.3?
general 2020-09-29 07:23:54 Exactly
general 2020-09-29 07:24:01 Panther is br 5.3 clown
general 2020-09-29 07:24:14 It’s like saying “the t34 isn’t op because the Is4m has better armour”
general 2020-09-29 07:24:50 Tell me a tank harder to kill at the same br?
general 2020-09-29 07:25:21 Lmao ok
general 2020-09-29 07:25:27 Half the tank is a weak spot clown
general 2020-09-29 07:26:02 
general 2020-09-29 07:26:13 Unless you’re a complete idiot and can’t aim it’s easy to kill
general 2020-09-29 07:26:46 There’s a flat plate that takes up 1/3 of the tank
general 2020-09-29 07:26:50 And another one above it
general 2020-09-29 07:27:05 If you just aim center mass it’s dead
general 2020-09-29 07:27:19 So does the is2
general 2020-09-29 07:27:29 It’s easier to kill than the panther
general 2020-09-29 07:27:41 Then just shoot the lower plate
general 2020-09-29 07:27:45 Also that’s not true xD
general 2020-09-29 07:27:51 The panther turret is highly trolly
general 2020-09-29 07:27:58 You have to hit exactly centre
general 2020-09-29 07:28:04 Or it ricochets up or down
general 2020-09-29 07:28:11 Actually I shoot center
general 2020-09-29 07:28:17 And it says non penetration
general 2020-09-29 07:28:27 Like 30 percent of the time
general 2020-09-29 07:28:46 Is2 has worse armour at a higher br
general 2020-09-29 07:28:53 As I said you don’t have to shoot checks
general 2020-09-29 07:29:02 Most the hull is a weak spot
general 2020-09-29 07:29:20 IS2 is slower,has worse armour and has worse gun than the panther
general 2020-09-29 07:29:38 (Due to reload speed)
general 2020-09-29 07:29:51 Exactly
general 2020-09-29 07:29:54 The gun is fine
general 2020-09-29 07:30:00 It just takes 25s to reload
general 2020-09-29 07:30:06 Panther can pen everything
general 2020-09-29 07:30:13 Give me something it can’t pen
general 2020-09-29 07:30:18 At br 5.3
general 2020-09-29 07:30:21 Lmao
general 2020-09-29 07:31:06 Super Pershing isn’t 5.3 clown
general 2020-09-29 07:31:15 Everything at 6.3 can get downtiered
general 2020-09-29 07:31:19 Doesn’t mean it’s OP
general 2020-09-29 07:31:28 So can tiger 2p
general 2020-09-29 07:31:35 Panther also gets down tiered to 4.3
general 2020-09-29 07:32:22 In 4.3 matches I almost always see at least 2 panthers
general 2020-09-29 07:32:26 And a few tiger h1s
general 2020-09-29 07:32:51 jUSt flAnk thEm
general 2020-09-29 07:33:01 Why can’t Is4m be br 5 then as I said
general 2020-09-29 07:33:09 Because you can flank it
general 2020-09-29 07:33:14 And trapshot
general 2020-09-29 07:33:33 Flanking though
general 2020-09-29 07:33:40 Also it’s easy to trapshot
general 2020-09-29 07:34:05 Did I say I do that?
general 2020-09-29 07:34:16 I usually go through forests in non urban maps
general 2020-09-29 07:34:26 Which other German vehicles often do too
general 2020-09-29 07:34:34 E.g waffentrager
general 2020-09-29 07:34:36 And panther
general 2020-09-29 07:35:02 If I meet them head on while going through a forest they’ll win
general 2020-09-29 07:35:06 T34 has bs armour
general 2020-09-29 07:36:23 No
general 2020-09-29 07:36:43 T 34-85 oP pLs nErf gAijIn

general 2020-09-29 07:38:22 This is one of the the gayest tanks in the USSR tech tree
general 2020-09-29 07:38:34 
general 2020-09-29 07:38:39 It’s a panther but with a trash gun at br 6
general 2020-09-29 07:38:49 Yes
general 2020-09-29 07:39:20 China
general 2020-09-29 07:39:32 Btw what do you think about the su100p?
general 2020-09-29 07:39:48 It’s extremely op imo
general 2020-09-29 07:39:56 Often get 10+ kill games with it
general 2020-09-29 07:40:07 Su122 54 is a demented t54 hull
general 2020-09-29 07:40:19 I dislike it
general 2020-09-29 07:41:21 Interesting
general 2020-09-29 07:42:41 
general 2020-09-29 07:42:42 Ultimate combo

plane-crazy 2021-04-01 08:46:06 It was mentioned multiple times by <@406178669661257729>

plane-crazy 2021-04-01 08:48:28 It’s in an obvious spot
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 08:49:00 What rickroll <@406178669661257729>

plane-crazy 2021-04-01 08:58:44 <@!660019099430289418>
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:01:22 Technically you can ping rickje’s alt
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:01:37 In rules it only states not to ping his main
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:02:25 Only rickje139 and madattak can’t be pinged
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:21:51 Were you the guy flying the Berkut around?
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:21:59 I saw it multiple times today
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:27:45 It’s in an obvious spot
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:28:12 It looked pretty decent
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:28:15 Gj
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:29:12 It’s uselsss
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:29:19 Remove that or you’re gonna get banned
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:29:29 The creator has been warning people who share location
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:29:50 I’m not a mod, I’m just telling you just in case
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:29:58 Gold is in a bad spot
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:30:01 So easy to find
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:30:25 Because the creator warned my friend who shared location
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:31:02 He deleted the warning
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:31:08 <@!432145000327938049> got it
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:31:20 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:31:31 I pinged the <@406178669661257729>
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:31:34 Not rickje 139
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:31:35 I think
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:32:00 Ah nvm then
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:32:13 I changed number from 4213 to 4212
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:32:18 Didn’t think it would still ping him
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:32:36 Yes now I know
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:32:39 Before I didn’t
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:32:52 I thought it was pinging a random account
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:33:01 Ask <@!432145000327938049>
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:33:24 No.
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:33:33 I said that he could get a warn for sharing location
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:34:00 Someone else was then
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:34:16 Stop misrepresenting what I said
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:34:25 Not poggers
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:35:05 Ah yes rickjechan
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:35:38 Then I replied to wrong message
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:35:56 xD
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:35:58 See?
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:36:15 Yes it does not indeed
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:36:24 But creator warned someone for stating where it is
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:38:35 Btw why was the update so minor?
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:39:50 Me?
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:40:09 How am I minimodding?
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:40:30 Only thing I did was suggest to someone they shouldn’t say location because the owner warned one person who did
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:41:05 Not minimodding, just trying to help in case they also get a warning
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:41:50 Not really a surprise
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:41:54 Just a few yellow bars
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:44:04 I’d expect some random kid to make a Hindu peace symbol with it
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:44:57 Am I allowed to say that?
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:45:42 Is in river comrad )))
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:46:13 Just spam the chats and you’ll get it eventually
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:46:16 Great system
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:46:35 Lemme check if I can send images
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:47:06

plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:49:56 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:50:24 No, it’s clearly a Volkswagen Beetle
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:51:09 >:((
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:51:29 Also wrong
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:51:37 As I said it’s a Volkswagen Beetle
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:51:57 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:53:59 <@456226577798135808> might wanna get your vision checked out
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:54:07 
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:54:08 =
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:54:10 
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:54:54 Tbh kinda does
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:55:55 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:56:03 Yeah but it’s not rounded
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:56:11 (My build)
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:58:08 точка
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:59:09 Help with what?
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:59:24 Watch a video
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 09:59:36 We’re prob not gonna explain it in chat
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:00:49 English 100
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:02:08 Where are the motor locks
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:02:25 >:((
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:04:20 That’s not gonna work btw
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:04:35 If it’s whole plot long
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:05:08 Due to the tracks being extremely angled
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:05:11 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:06:06 Folding increases lag if there are enough folds from my experience
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:06:26 So don’t add a bunch folded of carriages
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:06:33 Hmm really?
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:06:44 I thought folded builds are SMALLER
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:07:53 Everyone knows making a build longer makes it larger
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:08:01 There’s no need to say it
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:08:20 …
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:08:26 That’s not what I said
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:08:51 Keeping the build the same height and width but making it longer obviously increases the block count
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:09:06 That guy isn’t gonna make the carriages 2 blocks tall smh my head
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:10:19 Thanks for realising
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:10:41 HMM
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:10:45 Very sus
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:10:54 I think the devs need to patch that
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:11:08 Btw are there also diamonds?
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:12:07 No, make a Trotsky armed train with cannons
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:12:38 Or just any Soviet stronk armoured train from ww2
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:12:49 
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:13:49 Because funny devs
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:14:22 Ah yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:14:26 Understandable
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:14:43 Good job fellow fashist
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:14:47 Jk
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:15:52 Almost everything I build is either Soviet or (national socialist) German
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:16:49 Look for it
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:16:54 It’s in an obvious place
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:17:31 It might as well have been hidden in the middle of your plot
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:18:21 Nyet comrade, am glorious patriot of motherland))))
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:18:43 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:18:57 Can I bring a Mig 21?
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:19:27 Wrong answer
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:21:04 Make a cannon that shoots gold bars
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:21:29 Shredder bugs are stupid
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:21:46 They should be bannable or something lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:22:26 ))))
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:23:20 What’s sps again?

plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:25:30 I can easily defeat that
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:26:10 Shredders are the most unpoggers thing you can build
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:26:41 Ah yes musical artist
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 10:26:57 I have a terrorist van filled with tnt just in case someone has a shredder
