help 2020-12-07 21:26:06 I've been playing plane crazy for a while, but have no idea about finer points. What are those strange motor stacks that come out the back of planes? They dissapear when the plane is in play. I would assume they are a stability glitch of sorts? idk, they seem helpfull.
help 2020-12-07 21:28:40 I don't know what they look like in play, but probably. They come out the top and do a line, a motor up, a line, a motor, a line, a motor. They go upwards.
