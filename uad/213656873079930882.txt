plane-crazy 2018-12-04 23:28:02 A
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 23:34:19 have people made like actual transformers before
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 23:36:12 there are like a lot of needed wedges missing tbh
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 23:36:23 not going to complain though
help 2018-12-04 23:51:15 <#501034677793193994>
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 23:51:50 im trying to make a plane that somewhat resmbles a 4 engine bomber
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 23:51:59 but instead 5 engines
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 23:55:32 uh
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 23:55:39 helium i guess
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 23:55:42 or ballast
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 23:55:43 idk
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 23:56:09 or try to make a gyroscope
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 00:11:38 <@!340543153922768906> of course  it didn't work as it is the inferior siege engine, try a trebuchet for better results
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 00:41:53 well this is all i have so far for the 5 engine bomber
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 00:42:28 <@!285640703550423041> why is your profile pic Gyro
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 00:50:53 idk
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 00:51:07 but i guess it has to do with wheels, half blocks, and magnets
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 00:58:35 <@362351190618538005> ballasts are with the motor
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:01:14 do jet engines or rocket engines have more thrust
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:03:32 Gyro is the sexiest Zeppelli
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:13:56 is this even relatively smart
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:17:20 yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:19:42 i have to copy that entire wing section by hand
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:19:45 oh boy
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:20:27 uh
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:20:32 depends on the size
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:21:04 what was the creation
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:21:08 i didnt see
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:21:32 put your motors on max and toggle
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:21:39 that should help
general 2018-12-05 01:22:04 the swastika is backwards
general 2018-12-05 01:22:14 so technically it is not offensive
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:23:13 <@456226577798135808> you are very familiar
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:23:23 where do i remember you from
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:23:47 im not jameskii
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:25:53 <@456226577798135808> i feel like we keep meeting eachother in weird games
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:28:02 yes
general 2018-12-05 01:39:41 also it is not tilted 45 degrees
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:44:41 Super rockets are superior
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:44:52 huge can only do up to its weight
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 02:14:11 so do propeller blades connect to engines or no?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 02:16:54 someone asked me if i had a youtube channel
creations-chat 2018-12-05 02:29:01 <@163143541160148992> those look more like spitfires than messerschmitts, unless they aren't messerschmitts
creations-chat 2018-12-05 02:29:08 idk
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 02:30:15 this may be too many thrusters
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 02:32:10 no
creations-chat 2018-12-05 02:33:08 ok yea it is a messerschmitt
creations-chat 2018-12-05 02:33:15 im not well educated on planes
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 02:35:16 dont you love it when the CoM circle does not show up
creations-chat 2018-12-05 03:08:34 <@163143541160148992> what other planes from the *Luftwaffe* have you created
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 03:29:42 well
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 03:30:00 the 5 engine bomber turned into a no engine bomber with a lot of thrusters
creations-chat 2018-12-05 03:53:57 <@300736152615387137> Star Wars
creations-chat 2018-12-05 03:54:05 Ship of Boba and Jango Fett
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 03:54:49 <@331490905846448129> i kind of already requested that
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 03:56:29 I also requested scaling tool so we dont need all those different blocks
the-dump 2018-12-05 13:14:20 
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:39:09 What needs to happen is for roblox to fix their censorship system
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:40:24 I hate having to put music# gear# or grade#
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:41:46 The word "Date" is censored
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:41:51 Sometimes
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:42:26 <@456226577798135808> i request anime to other people and one of those is Date A Live
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:43:15 Remember when Roblox removed the party system?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:43:54 Remember the removal of Tix
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:44:34 Removal of Genre search?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:44:46 Removal of experimental games?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:45:14 Experimental games were fun
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:45:51 Void script builder exists
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:46:03 Which makes more exploits
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:46:54 I remember playing the original PIR before the huge exploiter situation
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:47:28 There is a game that is PIR but is not by maelstronomer
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:48:00 No
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:48:03 Like
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:48:06 Actual PIR
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:48:22 Let me lonk
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:48:29 Yea peasant inc
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:49:00 Small
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 13:49:49 I gtg
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:39:09 Who uses OBS for screenshots?
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:40:16 OBS is superior when it comes to recording
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:40:29 The downside is that you need to convert FLV to MP3
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:40:44 MP4*
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:41:13 Wait you can?
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:41:21 I never update OBS
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:41:24 So idk
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:41:45 I barely use obs
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:42:17 I pretty much use OBS when im getting custom hitsounds for osu maps
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 01:13:05 im going to scrap the big plane idea
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 01:13:19 i couldnt get the proportions right
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 01:29:41 what do you think of my engine design
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 01:29:48 it has 4 super engines on the inside too
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 01:32:08 updated so it can hold wing panels
creations-chat 2018-12-06 20:36:23 <@471988139943133207> make a Vertibird from the Fallout series
creations-chat 2018-12-06 20:37:49 It is an Enclave / Brotherhood VTOL
creations-chat 2018-12-06 20:38:05 Mostly used in Fallout 4
creations-chat 2018-12-06 20:55:45 What part are you having trouble on
creations-chat 2018-12-06 21:46:16 Pod racers are probably really hard to make
creations-chat 2018-12-06 21:46:36 Because you need the correct thrust to make everything "hover"
creations-chat 2018-12-06 21:46:51 But the rope i imagine would be a pain
creations-chat 2018-12-06 21:49:36 Whenever someone says "Oh my god" in caps i only imagine Joseph Joestar
bug-reports 2018-12-06 22:13:24 How many of which are magnets
creations-chat 2018-12-06 22:18:58 <@471988139943133207> can you convert that to mp4

creations-chat 2018-12-06 23:17:11 <@!378206034570772480> how did you use 1500 regular blocks
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 23:56:43 <@!362351190618538005> now how does one go about making a railgun
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 23:56:55 speaking of

plane-crazy 2018-12-07 00:33:09 i tried making a railgun
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 00:33:14 it didnt work
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 00:34:29 my problem is not diameter related
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 00:34:33 it is magnet related
plane-crazy 2018-12-07 00:34:59 ok maybe it is a little bit related to space
general 2018-12-07 02:04:19 
general 2018-12-07 02:04:20 excuse me
general 2018-12-07 02:09:04 exactly

creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:43:31 yes
creations-chat 2018-12-07 05:43:46 but put a couple of helium blocks in the back to stimulate it
creations-chat 2018-12-08 00:46:16 pretty much yea
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 15:29:36 what is the best way to build a gyroscope
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 15:30:26 this is what i got so far
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 15:30:31 but it is only on 2 axis
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 15:35:36 the ship breaking or the char

plane-crazy 2018-12-08 16:00:49 ask inferno
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 16:00:59 he said there was a new way to kill servers
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 16:10:38 we need 5/6 blocks bad
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 16:20:29 i honestly dont enjoy the fact that the Glass Wedges section does not contain all of the Wedges
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 16:42:48 nice i accidentally loaded than saved
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 16:42:55 well
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 16:43:02 that was a lot of progress lost

general 2018-12-15 05:14:46 Pilgrim Islands Reborn
general 2018-12-15 05:14:52 game by maelstronomer
general 2018-12-15 05:15:04 but died when Roblox decided that every game needs Filtering Enabled
general 2018-12-15 20:17:18 i now know why creators dont make 5/6 blocks
