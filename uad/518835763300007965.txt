bug-reports 2022-04-16 00:18:02 Bug: Spotlights appear to turn off after a short period of time. I don't know if this is intentional or not, but it seems that having more spotlights, or simply having a large build causes them to turn off faster, causing lighting to go out of sync, or break entirely.
