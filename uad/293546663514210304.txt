the-dump 2019-06-03 06:06:19 i used to play this game called build your own mech. i hope some features that were in that game are added into this one. you could build tanks, planes, cars, and of course mechs, i preferred tanks as shown but overall i had some great experiences there
the-dump 2019-06-03 06:06:37 
the-dump 2019-06-03 06:07:30 and i wish there could be a feature where you could rescale some of the building blocks so you could make interiors like this
the-dump 2019-06-03 06:08:21 and mechs, planes,
the-dump 2019-06-03 06:08:34 yeah lmao
the-dump 2019-06-03 06:09:02 a LOT more extra features
the-dump 2019-06-03 06:09:10 game is closed due to hackers targeting it
the-dump 2019-06-03 06:09:16 creator gave up, sadly
the-dump 2019-06-03 06:09:43 i had to build the tank reloading system myself.

the-dump 2019-06-03 06:36:41 I have a video showing how a "basic" tank from build your own mech worked

the-dump 2019-06-03 06:37:29 of course it was just the firing mechanism and a crap computer struggling to move this beast altogether
the-dump 2019-06-03 06:37:52 you had the ability to add sounds
the-dump 2019-06-03 06:38:38 and that shell that came out of that tank was about 50 compressed parts that exploded a hole inside another vehicle's armor
the-dump 2019-06-03 06:38:45 good times.

the-dump 2019-06-03 06:41:47 the white and red transparent blocks were magnets, that's one thing BYM has in common with this game.
