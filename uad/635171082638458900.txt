general 2021-03-07 14:48:09 smh some kid is harassing me for using a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 15:06:34 i got a question for some of you is it a "toxic villianish" thing to use a shredder bug as intended to on a pvp server as one chump said with his 3 shredders
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 15:07:49 otherwise the chump that said it was currently attacking people with 3 shredders
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 15:08:09 and i only use one once in a GREAT while
plane-crazy 2021-03-07 15:08:32 its nothing fancy or special
