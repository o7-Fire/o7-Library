creations-chat 2019-05-26 13:14:10 im just thinking tho does it reset when it moves due to weight?

plane-crazy 2019-07-19 18:35:19 wish i could suggest because you guys could do a scrap mechanic and allow players in certain seats to control certain things on a vehicle by wiring them up
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 18:37:30 arson is a good way out of that situation
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 18:38:29 thats a pretty crazy lookin plane
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 18:39:55 bruh just cover the underside of the door with toiler paper

creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:36:00 made some quad copter with a gun turret and under wing rockets it also has boosters under the wings so it is able to quickly go forwards
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:39:43 i know
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:39:48 might work on em soon
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:41:07 a He-111 its got bad lookin bombs so i dropped em it uses full motor props for its design and yes the props aint right as if i use only one prop blade on each side it cannot fly under its own power
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:43:03 here is the back and underside and yes i know the top turret aint right but id rather a working turret than none
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:51:28 my He-219 with as per usual with my planes not the right amount of blades
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:52:01 and this is the rear and underside of the 219
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:55:49 i know
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:55:57 the power is simply not enough tho
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:56:28 the sheer weight of the plane wont let it go up and if i put too many wings on it it will be slow as
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:56:58 eh its also at a pretty good speed rn
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:57:05 due to lag i cant pin it down
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:57:11 but its like 150-250
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:57:57 yep
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:58:12 i usually do 2 blocks thick
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:58:16 but i need to add engines
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:58:44 and there aint much drop when the engine levels with the wing so i made it 3 blocks thick
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:59:02 ive also got a major problem
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:59:04 with the 111
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:59:14 mixing pistons and landing gears isnt a good idea
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:59:20 it likes to kill the 111
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:59:25 by making it spasm
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:59:38 just like if i hit something with the props
creations-chat 2019-07-19 21:59:49 which makes it hard to take off
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:01:38 jesus
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:01:47 hit 800 speed in the quad copter
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:06:26 welp this is the fastest thing ive ever made
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:13:33 yep
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:13:36 i know
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:13:41 but what am i supposed to do
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:13:56 when the engines are as thick as the wings
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:14:04 make 2 block engines
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:14:28 no im serious at points the wings were 2 blocks thick
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:14:33 3

creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:15:17 fair criticism
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:15:39 yeah it took me quite a while with that
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:15:52 i was looking at the wings on both of them and the position
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:16:05 it took around an hour to position right on both
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:16:27 i know
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:16:42 i use blue prints and attempt to use other references
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:17:26 and i dont really  plan ahead i usually make a plane im playing in a game or one that im interested in

creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:18:30 but yeah even id agree the 111 wings are chunky like even compared to my sea vixen which fills the entire boundry box has 2 block wings
