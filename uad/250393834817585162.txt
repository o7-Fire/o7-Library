The Tale of theshrekondcomingofstalin (250393834817585162)
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 04:22:57 I spent days developing this only to test it in PVP and learn that machine gun fire just shreds though it's thick layers of armor.
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 04:24:15 A tank
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 04:24:43 with tank treads
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 04:26:00 If only they had armor that machine guns couldn't just easily penetrate through.
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:02:43 Rockets are not a problem for my tank since the side skirts prematurely detonate them before they can get to the hull.
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:03:21 I'm now working on adding actual drive wheels to my tank
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:05:55 Last night there was some dude with a stationary turret with like 10 machines guns pointed forward. He aimed at the side of my tank and just shredded through the tracks and side skirt armor and ultimately the hull.
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:06:51 beams in the inner hull to save data
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:09:43 But you have to take into account that this is the interior of the tracks.
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:10:38 Pff that's for stupid noobs.
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:10:40 Too easy
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:10:53 :3
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:11:07 I'm a poor noob I want sum robux.
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:15:23 Someone make a big bomb that does this:
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:15:36 yes
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:15:44 Are they cancer?
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:16:07 how effective is tnt?
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:16:41 I plane on making a tank shell for my giant tank that is filled with tnt
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:16:46 3 tnt
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:17:15 I have already developed the breach loader for the tank
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:18:12 Ok so use a 3 by 3 by 3 tank shell launched by magnets
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:19:38 I'm sure I'm using a tank for it.
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:20:46 It wasn't a nucler device but yes it was an AI bomber from the animation "Fortress".
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:21:31 I intend to make the armor on the tank's turret 9 blocks thick in certain areas.
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:21:54 I know
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:22:33 For such a giant tank it generates surprisingly little lag
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:23:19 2045 blocks and supposedly 154 speed
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:24:15 I'm sure the speedometer is off.
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:24:46 But the speed it does have is due to this
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:25:18 It also inadveterntly functions as torsion bar suspesnion (kind of).
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:25:36 As somehow the wheels are able to move up and down a little.
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 05:28:03 It probably would have been smarter to have just made the armor flat.. But it would have made the tank unattractive.
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:18:12 My tank is having a derp attack.
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:22:33 There's no engines attached to it though
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:27:59 My tank is broken.
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:28:52 My TONK iS fASt AF bOI!!
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:30:08 112
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:30:46 When I spawn it it spawns in someone elses plot without the tracks
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:31:26 I have no idea.
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:33:49 Cover your eyes kids this NSF stuff
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:35:59 Well I figured out where the wheels went....
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:36:58 They're going to heaven.
creations-chat 2019-03-07 07:47:12 This the best heavy tank.
plane-crazy 2019-03-07 07:56:37 Breech loading cannon
creations-chat 2019-03-07 07:57:46 Breech loading cannon.
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 05:04:36 Has anyone developed an auto-loading cannon whose barrel can go up and down and return to it's original position to load again
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 07:29:48 <@206891768233328640> This is the actual layout for tiger wheelsw
plane-crazy 2019-03-08 07:51:16 <@206891768233328640> psshh nah totally not too complex. :3
plane-crazy 2019-03-15 03:32:30 Anyone have any belt-fed machine gun designs?
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 02:51:11 hm
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 02:55:40 Does anyone have any machine gun designs?
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 03:01:38 Does anyone happen to have any machine gun designs? I'm trying to design some kind of weapon system to put on top of my vehicle hull?
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 03:02:33 What?
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 03:21:44 
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 03:21:56 <@511080180966752256> Sorry I was talking to someone
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:30:29 Can somebody help me develop a cannon or heavy machine gun for my tank?
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:31:59 the merkava tank has a major flaw
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:32:29 It's too wide to fit on any conventional railroad system.
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:35:09 Anyone?
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:35:32 I guess nobody has an technical experience in designing a cannon
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:35:39 *any*
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:42:21 I mean FUNCTIONAL cannons
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:42:32 as in they actually load and fire rounds
plane-crazy 2019-03-30 00:43:05 s
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 21:17:51 Ugh the most recent update undid the last one
plane-crazy 2019-03-31 21:18:00 It made the lag even worse
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 00:18:44 I think I may of come up with a new tracks design.
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 00:19:37 what do you mean?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 00:24:00 I hate how almost every turret I see is just for aesthetic purposes.
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 00:24:18 how?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 00:25:09 what does the cannon fire?
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 00:50:24 This is my first attempt at making a cannon.
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 00:59:22 word of advice on designing breach loading cannons: don't use pistons to  push the projectile in.
plane-crazy 2019-04-02 05:09:00 Has anyone ever built a machine gun that fires tnt?
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 00:19:21 I think I finally understand how these tank tracks work.
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 04:09:16 Welcome to a magical place called tank development hell.
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 04:10:16 Gopnik by DJ Blyatman is bettr
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 04:10:29 ^
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 04:10:51 
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 04:11:34 This was one of my first attempts at building a tank
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 04:13:32 I would attempt to build smaller tanks but they wouldn't be able to have a turret large enough to hold a tnt firing cannon.
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 04:13:54 
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 04:20:19 I'm going to try to cram an auto cannon into the turret of my future tank
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 04:20:42 Each bullet will be a 1 by 3 tnt block projectile\
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 20:41:56 Is it possible to copy and paste structures that you built in a plot on this game?
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 20:46:51 Well great, I guess I'm going to have to build another one these.
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 20:47:55 It's a track, that still has to have motors and wheel guiders put in
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 21:01:13 I just realized they added explosive ball into the game. I guess that kind of solves the auto cannon problems as ball cannons already exist in this game.
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 21:02:14 So if I were to make the most out of everything I would have to make a cannon that fired large explosive blocks shells and and machine gun that fires explosive balls.
plane-crazy 2019-04-03 21:03:07 Oof the suggestions channel is locked.
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:19:23 Progress update on new track design development
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:28:01 That's not a tank track
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:28:08 that's a bunch of wheels lined up together
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:28:25 Apparently motors are the new fawd
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:28:32 *fad*
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:29:01 I think they're able to operate at higher speeds without glitched out than ropes are
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:29:50 For instance, this uses motors and is by far the fastest tracked vehicle that I've ever seen.
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:30:06 It also uses trapdoors
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:30:10 in the drivewheels
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:30:21 I did not develop this btw
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:34:01 oof
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:34:22 We might find a can of spam in the Mariana Trench
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:34:26 Oh wait we already have.
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:34:59 Search that up right now
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:35:03 I dare you
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:35:22 Spring suspension is very laggy from my experience
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:38:11 Cover  your eyes kids
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:38:36 
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:39:03 When your game is so screwed up that your giant tank spawns in another person's plot
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:41:10 When you spawn in your tank but it has suspension and thus  all the road wheels fly away somehow.
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:41:47 When your tank is actually flying
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:42:15 I just made a Leonidas costume in roblox
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:42:29 last night
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:43:08 I can't really get any more specific than that
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:44:23 I have a crusader costume also
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:45:42 as well as Joseph Stalin, Vladimir Lenin, Karl Marx, Bob Ross,  Vermin Supreme,  and Shrek outfit for my avatar
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:46:35 
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:46:51 
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 05:47:13 
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 22:52:59 Presenting my very simplistic track system. You can build it yourself  in just 8 easy hours.
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:10:19 Someone develop an auto cannon for me.
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:11:06 It'll easy and will only take around 1 -2 24 hour day(s) of game play.
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:18:46 My tank has more wheels
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:21:04 <@!486674992981999648>  Are you sure that your car has more wheels?
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:21:51 aspect ratio?
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:25:03 So far my 2 tracks only take up 2028 blocks.
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:25:56 Colonizing mars is stupid
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:27:10 The planet doesn't have enough gravity for the right atmosphere.
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:27:30 NO CUSSING ON THIS CHRISTIAN MiNeCRAFt sErVer
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:29:05 wind tunnel is h0t
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:30:04 It's sounds like he unloaded a shell casing from the breech of a cannon and loaded in a new one
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:31:06 I can listen to this all day
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:31:57 YES
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:31:59 YESS
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:32:02 YEESSS
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:32:21 
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:32:28 Use a magnet
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:32:33 Magnets
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:32:41 Yep
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:32:55 at an EXTREMELY high velocity
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:33:10 I tried that in the picture
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:33:15 it's a nightmare
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:33:44 use  a piston operated by motors to load the gun
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:33:51 They're much reliable
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:34:12 let me see
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:35:18 wait nvm I deleted the reference
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:35:45 good
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:36:20 3 blocks wide means you will have very little shells
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:36:45 Most of what you will be fighting will be small vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:36:48 and planes
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:36:56 cars and planes
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:37:18 So you should preferably make it  1 block wide shell
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:38:03 The main problem that you will have in building the cannon is figuring out how to load it
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:38:38 Because you are stepping into new waters in doing that

plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:48:56 no
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:49:17 You need ALOT of pistons for a 3 blocks long shell
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:49:27 And it's all very glitchy and unreliable
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:57:21 Oof there's electronics music that's playing hours on end in the echo chamber
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:57:27 probly
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:57:44 I will have to wait a while for some communist ASMR
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 23:59:18 Question
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 00:01:47 American
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 00:17:13 question
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 00:17:29 will having 264 motors spin at full speed crash the server?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 00:20:32 What?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 00:20:43 so Yes or no?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 00:33:47 Eww furries
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:16:50 Do you think this has enough power
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:17:53 I only have ian intel i5 processor so probably
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:19:05 I mean this was my previous tank it was ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:19:39 Relax I'm on a private server
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:20:22 Anyone want to get their computer nuked?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:21:13 I intend to also put in 150 tnt blocks worth of ammunition inside the tank
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:21:28 along with a ball machine gun that shoot tnt balls
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:21:44 so all together it will have 300 explosive blocks in it
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:21:55 and will become a nuke if it gets ammo raked
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:23:45 So far my tank has 630 motors on it. A little over half of which are unpowered
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:25:20 I really miss my wigga
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:25:33 Eww furries
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:27:27 Wait
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:27:42 Comrades we need to build a mobile gulag
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:28:02 It must have a robotic arm from which we can grab and imprison enemies of the state
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:28:22 
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:29:06 I wish we could buy more data using robux in this game
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:29:20 so I could more structures
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:30:49 I remember when I started a communist revolution in some other game and we raided a concentration camp
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:32:38 This is our hero
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:32:57 Shrek is an eternal meme
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:33:31 
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 01:35:19 This is my most recent roblox avatar outfit
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 02:24:02 This is by far the simplest vehicle in roblox
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 02:24:08 totally not being sarcasitic
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 02:28:16 Ok so I loaded the thing
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 02:28:26 And now my game is temporarily frozen
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 02:56:50 Ok  I now don't know why people are now using motors in tank tracks
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 02:57:08 they're also just as laggy
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 02:57:56 these tracks alone crash my game
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 02:59:28 an advice on how to get this to stop crashing my game?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:00:10 But I've used rope tracks of these sizes with no problems
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:02:05 8GB of LPDDR3 SDRAM Onboard Memory
256GB SSD
Intel HD Graphics 520
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:02:07 6th Generation Intel Core i5-6200U Processor
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:02:51 this is an acer aspire 13
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:03:01 it's an affordable gamign laptop
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:03:08 it probably has a graphics card
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:04:05 wait
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:04:28 Oh I realized my graphics were on max settings
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:06:17 I'm going to buy an over $1000 laptop in order to do that
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:16:22 you people seem to know a lot about computers
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:19:11 My computer uses a hard drive
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:19:15 I mean solid state drive
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:19:40 It's the only thing I've replaced on it
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:19:44 It's a 1 terrabyte one
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:20:02 $173
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:20:33 What do you mean?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:21:01 Oh have any of you guys heard of the game called wolfpack?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:21:20 I bought it
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:21:25 It's pretty cool
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:21:33 Huge learning curve thought
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:21:37 and I mean HUGE
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:23:54 I'm kind of surprised that my computer can handle war thunder but can't handle the tank that I built in this game
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:25:44 in 2017 I was searching for terabyte solid state drives and found a 1 Terra byte hard drive  that cost only $60.
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:26:26 I dunno
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:26:33 But they weren't that expensive
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:33:26 Many other moderators on other servers would define that as SFW
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:35:28 So I figured out that the number of unpowered motors was making my game crash
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:35:45 It may also have to do with the motors but I wasn't running them
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:36:05 Yes they are
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:36:23 I know
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:36:28 They are connected by motors
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:36:30 in the center

plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:43:06 They don't work yet
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:43:18 Because they crash my game
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:44:09 I'm going to have to increase the size of the track one link every 2-3 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:46:47 Here's  a video of Integex's tank
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:56:54 What server is that?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:57:46 h,,
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:58:00 <@!486674992981999648> are you German or something?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 03:58:46 Are you German?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:00:28 I'm kind of surprised girls play this game.
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:01:11 ooo
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:01:25 We;; first I made a tank that didn't work
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:01:34 Then I modified it to make a tank that didn't work
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:01:49 then I modified it to make another tank that didn't work
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:02:00 then I made a tank that worked but was slow af
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:02:16 Then I made a faster tank that worked
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:02:25 then I made a tank that didn't work
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:02:45 And most recently I made a tank that probably works but crashes my computer
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:03:05 That's basically my entire history of actions
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:04:00 I've spent a at least 48 hours of game play building tanks in vain
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:04:18 I wanted to was to build a vehicle that could carry a breach loadding cannon
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:05:06 
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:06:11 My first tank
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:06:48 Anyone want to come on my VIP server
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:06:52 it's lag free
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:08:37 BIG
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:08:54 But aircraft carriers are pointless in this game
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:09:28 fuel isn't much of an issue and there's always somewhere available to land
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:13:45 I am kind of feeling down
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:13:54 I spent like 16 hours on this tank
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:14:14 and I can't even run it
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:16:46 Wait I just got a light bulb on a simple way to reduce the lag that my tracks make
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:21:17 Eh
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:21:39 They're stupid
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:22:02 Why would you build and entire carrier when there's an airfield right by
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:22:54 Somebody needs to make a dive bomber
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:23:09 Capable of carrying lots of bombs
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:23:14 It'd be super OP
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:23:56 how fast do those ships move?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:24:18 So extremely slow
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:25:09 I wonder if you can make large vehicles move faster by placing helium blocks in them
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:28:40 There's something about that picture makes me happy
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:29:17 I had a 2000 block tank that somehow got 187 one t
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:30:47 aww my dog just wimpered in her sleep
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:30:51 or bark
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:30:56 *barked*
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:34:58 Somebody build a flying muffin
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 04:36:12 Flying muffins would be OP because everyone would look at them and be like "oh wait that's not an enemy plane that's just a flying muffin".

plane-crazy 2019-04-07 05:49:38 but question
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 05:49:49 Where are all the gunning positions?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 05:51:50 How big will the bomb load be?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 17:55:21 HAX
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 20:04:45 Wouldn't it be cool if there was a u boat simulator in roblox?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 20:05:50 oh right
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 20:06:11 All simulator games in roblox aren;'t simulators
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 20:12:38 Tanks they're great aren't they I mean they got you know great big THICK armor. That great big and heavy THIINNGGSS and then you know they got BIG TRACKS and th-th-that tear up the countryside and vroom across the countryside with a big engine VVRROOOOMM!!! And you got a crew of four or five men working together as a team and you got a turret  with a big gun and BANG and war and  THEY-THEY'VE JUST GOT  EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:11:45 Ok with my newest track design, the game doesn't crash
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:12:03 But I still do experience considerable lag
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:25:07 
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:25:12 Latest  design
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:26:29 It uses 50% less unpowered motors
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:26:50 is school in Germany very short/
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 21:26:54 ?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:11:58 The simplest track design doesn't work anymore
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:14:35 Why do motor tracks not work anymorre?
plane-crazy 2019-04-07 22:58:12 I just realized I completely messed up on the track design
plane-crazy 2019-04-08 00:15:46 how does that even move?
plane-crazy 2019-04-08 04:29:27 Wait what's wrong with motors?
plane-crazy 2019-04-08 04:29:32 <@511080180966752256>
plane-crazy 2019-04-08 05:04:51 well I figured out a new way to link my tracks together. It doesn't look as nice but still looks ok.    The only problem is that this is a fairly  complex pattern.
plane-crazy 2019-04-08 05:06:22 Oh much time would be saved if I could just copy and paste things.
plane-crazy 2019-04-08 05:06:30 All the pain and suffering
plane-crazy 2019-04-08 05:19:48 I tested the links  and they seen to be able to move around
plane-crazy 2019-04-08 05:19:50 so probably
plane-crazy 2019-04-08 05:20:28 I mean I think I tested the links on the previous tracks and they worked but since they most recent update they don't work anymore
plane-crazy 2019-04-09 03:04:51 Whomever can build a tank that carries a reloadable cannon that fires explosive block rounds is the king of tank and cannon development in this game.
plane-crazy 2019-04-09 03:16:52 My latest version of the heavy tracks.
plane-crazy 2019-04-09 03:17:00 Very simplistic no sarcasm
plane-crazy 2019-04-09 03:18:58 Do you think I can make the tank faster by adding helium blocks to it?
plane-crazy 2019-04-09 03:21:44 Guys would adding helium blocks to a heavy vehicle make it go faster?
plane-crazy 2019-04-09 03:23:51 My type  4 tank treads can do that
plane-crazy 2019-04-09 03:26:42 This was my type 3 tank
plane-crazy 2019-04-09 03:28:08 One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got into my pajamas I’ll never know.
plane-crazy 2019-04-09 03:30:58 What's the point of all those engines?
plane-crazy 2019-04-09 03:31:25 For spee
plane-crazy 2019-04-09 03:31:28 *speed*
plane-crazy 2019-04-09 03:32:07 In the type 3 I got up 187 speed somehow. But I let me tell you, the tank wasn't moving that fast.
plane-crazy 2019-04-09 03:33:22 The body of the tank could still neutrally steer 360 degrees in around 20-30 seconds.
plane-crazy 2019-04-09 03:35:59 I was attempting to make the tank faster by adding  true drive wheels to it, but the ropes would start glitching
plane-crazy 2019-04-09 03:37:18 that's exactly what I'm working on right now
plane-crazy 2019-04-09 03:37:50 I've had to build a completely new tank
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:09:09 Do you think I would get more  speed out of my tank with the same amount of torque if I used larger wheels?
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:09:29 Welp
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:10:38 So  ultimately I'm  guess I'm redoing this entire thing
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:10:50 Rip me
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:11:44 This is going to be like 8th time I've  had to redo a tank.
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:14:10 Does anyone happen to have a design for a 7 block wide wheel?

plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:20:52 minecraft's music certainly stirred up emotions in me during my early days of playing it
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:21:14 I would play it in single player on creative
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:22:23 I had this world where I build an underwater building that I cleared out using dirt blocks (because I didn't know about sponges let alone  most of the game's mechanics.
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:22:35 And I then traveled out far and lost it
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:22:40 which made me sad
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:28:57 Then I built a 80ish block long cruise ship, a plane with machine gun dispensers, a tall tree house, and was working on a ride that was going to be called journey to the center of the earth (I may of finished it actually). But then I learned about enchantment and decided to go to the end and I killed the enderdragon. This made my character later teleport to where I first spawned in the game, which was far far away from where I had built all those structures. And I was happy to see all the old building that I had built and all the animals that I had spawned but I was sad because I lost numerous structure that I had spent far more time on.

plane-crazy 2019-04-10 01:35:27 Does anyone happen to have a design for a 7 block in diameter wheel?
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 05:09:16 My tanks are getting ever more painful and time consuming  to build
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 05:10:45 Apparently cylinders have a lot of slip
plane-crazy 2019-04-10 05:11:28 and larger wheels are better at moving tracks quickly
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:23:39 Should I increase the wheel size to 7 or do you think that the wheels are already larger enough?
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:24:02 A tank
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:24:31 If you want an ultrasmooth ride then you do
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:26:25 Also having more wheels provides better side armor for the tank, which is a good thing if you intend on putting explosive block ammunition shells inside the vehicle.
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:27:01 I dunno
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:27:27 It's an acer aspire laptop, they're not known for having pretty screens
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 00:28:13 Also my graphics settings are down all the way
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 01:21:23 Does anyone happen to have an 8 block in diameter wheel design?
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 01:41:08 is this wheel round enough or does it look awkward?
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 01:48:48 The only problem with that is that I wanted to do a Tiger II like wheel arrangment
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 01:49:48 And with a specifically 7 block wheel design I'd have to leave a 3 block gap in between each wheel

plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:03:09 Behold the most complicated tank wheels ever.
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:07:58 Tiger tank inspired
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:08:27 This tank is going to probably be fast af
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:09:17 just the wheels alone take like 2 hours to make
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:09:41 Partially because I'm tired but still.
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:10:22 Aren't they beautiful?
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:12:37 I intend on adding torsion bar suspension, which should make the tank drive like a dream.
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:13:00 No but I can take one
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:14:00 
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:14:02 There.
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:14:10 Pain and suffering embodied
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:15:21 It is certainly wide, but I wouldn't say it's too widde
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:15:23 *wide*
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:16:24 If only I could copy and paste the other set of wheels instead of having to spend a couple more hours building themm
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:17:54 Exactly
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:18:06 Plus I'm not trying to build a tiger tank
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:19:16 It's just beautiful wheel design that allows for a smoother ride over rough terrain as well as provides better side protection.
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:20:53 Which considering the fact that I intend on filling up the tank with 150 explosive blocks worth of shells and 150 tnt balls for a machine gun, is probably  a good thing.
plane-crazy 2019-04-11 06:26:42 I truly hope that I will get the design right on the first try. I've already made 8 previous failures.

plane-crazy 2019-04-12 06:12:09 Well, damn
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 06:12:41 I messed up the distance in between the wheels and made it even
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 06:13:23 Now I have redo 2-3 hours of work to make the sure the distance between the two sets of wheels is 25 and not 24.
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 06:17:58 pretty cool
plane-crazy 2019-04-12 06:18:17 Hey Zefus can you do me a favor?

plane-crazy 2019-04-12 06:23:21 Welp I guess I'm just going to have to redo the interleaved wheels

plane-crazy 2019-04-13 15:52:07 so I learned that my upload mbps is 1.34
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 15:52:51 That explains why I have extreme lag in every game including ogar.io
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 20:59:33 Do you think that it would be possible to move tank treads that overlap these wheels with just 2 drive wheels powered by a motor transmission? Or should I just make the tank an all wheel drive?

plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:15:24 XD
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 21:41:11 Think this would work?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:12:18 What kind of suspension should I use for this tank?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:14:04 I guess I'll just use the front wheel drive system instead of the all wheel drive system
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:18:16 Do drive wheels even work on giant tanks?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:43:16 Welp, not a single wheel on this tank can move for some reason.
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:44:03 What do you mean?
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:44:52 They don't seem to be moving at all.
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:46:14 The only problem with that theory is that I've operated this and it worked just fine with minimal lag.
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:50:09 My wifi is so messed up
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:57:32 Well I went on my phone wifi because the upload mpds on my home's wifi so bad that I lag even on agar.io with 40 ping and  a download speed of 20 mpds.
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:57:52 wait
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:57:56 It's mbps
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:58:33 And so when I tried out the vehicle on my phone's wifi the motors actually moved
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:59:12 And this happened
plane-crazy 2019-04-13 22:59:56 Is it possible to add supports?
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 00:10:31 Welp I learned another problem with the tank
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 00:11:23 The squareish wheels don't react well while being pressed against the  rotating cylinders
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 00:11:36 So most of the motor's power is wasted
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 00:11:43 motors'
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 00:12:58 Developing practical tanks with actual cannons is really hard
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 00:14:25 I've spent like an entire week worth of game play trying to develop a larger platform that is capable of decent speeds and have not come out with a single fully successful model.
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 00:16:03 I'm just starting over again and scrapping my 2500+ block failure
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 00:16:39 It's only the 10th time I've done something like this
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 03:07:12 Anyone know any suspensions system that will work on this tank?
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 03:07:49 This tank isn't that laggy
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 03:08:01 As of now it produces no lag
plane-crazy 2019-04-14 05:03:15 Is 184 speed good for a large tank?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 21:30:42 Does anybody happen to have  a relatively unlaggy suspension system that allows for a high degree of verticaly movement?
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 02:55:27 Well,  finally built my own suspension system for my tank. Unfortunately whenever I test out the the tank, every motor just ceases to move.
plane-crazy 2019-04-21 19:43:33 My tank is nearly functional
plane-crazy 2019-04-21 19:44:15 I just need  make the wheels 6 blocks in diameter instead of 7
plane-crazy 2019-04-21 19:45:12 no
plane-crazy 2019-04-21 19:45:18 meme tanks only
plane-crazy 2019-04-21 19:45:59 nobody builds tracked meme tanks with functional cannons
plane-crazy 2019-04-21 19:46:13 that's not a tank
plane-crazy 2019-04-24 03:20:17 I have started toiling around with roblox studio for the first time.
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 05:04:45 I have finally perfected my interleaved road wheel system.
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 05:06:00 Due to the fact that the wheels are not perfectly round, a suspension system is absolutely necessary in order for the tank to be controllable as without it the entire tank just fly into the air.
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 05:07:10 But the advantage is that you don't have to use as many motors to achieve the same speed because you have larger road wheels.
creations-chat 2019-04-25 10:50:28 Sexy af interleaved wheels.
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 12:37:56 Don’t you just love it when you finally get your giant creation to work after having spent days building it and trying to get it to work?
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 15:59:56 Does anyone have a breach loading cannon?
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 21:24:39 My beauty in action.
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 21:27:14 what does damping on springs do?
plane-crazy 2019-04-25 21:31:21 what makes sure that a suspension spring comes back quickly?
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 15:47:01 Is it possible to get something that’s 3000 blocks in size to move fast?
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 15:48:36 How?
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 15:49:36 I NEED THIS TO MOVE FASTER!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 15:51:16 Roblox just has horrible programming probably.
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 15:51:59 Every update the developers make has to do with improving graphics probably.
plane-crazy 2019-04-26 23:34:26 Why do springs generate so much lag?
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 02:12:25 This is tank is fast af! :3
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 02:14:31 R is for relationships and mine are nonexistent , 'cause my friends and my women? I like to keep the distant.
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 02:23:14 My wifi is so bad that this happens whenever I spawn in my tank.
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 02:25:19 Yes, but I asked for a cannon, not a prop.
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 02:27:28 Send her back to South America
plane-crazy 2019-04-27 02:28:25 Cross country is a very popular sport near the border.
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:32:41 I wonder if its possible to turn the power of the spring into rotary movement
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:33:38 ^
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:35:04 As of now I'm developing a reloadable breach loading cannon.
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:38:42 I don't care about inventing
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:38:51 I care about whether it CAN be done
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:39:10 If it already is done then good for m
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:40:27 wait so a reloadable breach-loading cannon has already been developed?
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:40:48 Does anyone have a  picture of the design?
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:41:11 I don't want to have to reinvent the wheel.
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:42:51 what does break weld do on a spring?
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:45:09 a
plane-crazy 2019-04-30 22:47:40 
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:27:31 Does anyone have picture of a high capacity cannon round magazine?
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:37:19 This is my attempt on making one
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:38:46 A high capacity magazine needs to be short vertical
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:39:23 vertically and short in the horizontal direction parallel to the cannon.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:39:46 In order to allow for as much gun depression as possible without having to build an extremely tall turret.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:42:42 yep
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:44:05 Ideally, I would like  my cannon to be as depressed as a 2016 Hillary Clinton voter.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:44:49 But suspension is laggy af
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:45:51 My tank chassis already has 32 suspension springs
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:48:11 Rip computer then
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 02:48:20 I don't have a dedicated graphics card
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:01:06 Is that a cellphone case?
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:02:19 nah too advanced for it s time
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:05:08 I don't think a 30 would be possible using on suspension
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:05:13 \
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:07:06 A belt fed system sounds very tempting as of now.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:09:55 so does a ballast block set at 0.28 weigh as much as a normal block?
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:14:14 Please I need technical help.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:15:12 does a ballast block at default settings weigh as much a normal 1 by 1 block?
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:18:03 Is that phone in particular used to talk to your creator?
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:30:28 Ok so I did some testing and I estimate that single spring at max strength is capable of moving about 321 blocks worth of weight about a quarter of a block.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:31:52 what does break weld on a spring do?
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:32:59 ah ok
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:33:53 Oh, so I could probably use it to separate tnt blocks from one another
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:35:10 wow a lot of people are playing it
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:48:21 dang
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:48:37 rope retraction has immense strength
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:54:01 I conclude that ropes are immensely powerful
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:55:13 Just 6 ropes are able to drag  2571 blocks worth of weight at 1.5 blocks per second.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:55:20 That's just incredible
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 03:57:17 If one could build an engine that harnessed the power of ropes they would probably be able to move giant ground-based vehicles at speeds far beyond what is currently physically possible using only motors.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:51:30 this dude made a dino mech
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:52:20 And my rope engine is a failure.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:54:08 too late
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:54:09 I left
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:54:36 Because my rope engine was a failure
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:55:02 the three stroke engine did not work as I intended
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:55:20 Despite numerous modifications, nothing would keep the ropes from glitching out
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:55:54 If one does find a way to harness the power of ropes it will probably involve powered motors.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:58:27 convert the power of rope contraction and expansion into torque.
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:58:46 Really?
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:58:53 Without having the ropes glitch out?
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 05:59:36 Mine was based of a four stroke otto cycle engine
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 06:00:03 Can you send me a picture of one some time?
plane-crazy 2019-05-01 06:03:33 ok\
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:01:00 I wonder, in this game, is the falling speed of an object determined by it's total weight or it's total size/volume.
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:01:56 are all blocks equal in terms of armor restistance?
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:02:21 Ok, so I could reduce the weight of my tank by using ballast blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:02:47 oof
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:03:02 Yus
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:05:55 I want my tank to be light enough to move quickly (for its size that is) and heavy enough so that it doesn't move as if it were a balloon filled with air.
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:06:33 as of now somewhere around 2834
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:07:16 
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:08:04 Interleaved roadwheels
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:08:24 Each wheel is 6 blocks in diameter
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:09:11 For aesthetic purposes
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:09:26 Egh
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:09:36 It works fine
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:09:51 It's mainly the suspension that generates the lag
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:10:08 It says it gets up to speeds of 234
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:11:08 pistons are extremely glitchy
plane-crazy 2019-05-02 06:11:24 They cannot be relied upon to ddo anything
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 12:21:17 Is the speed of ground vehicles exclusively decided by the power to weight ratio? Or are other things involved as well?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 12:38:19 So isthe speed of ground vehicles exclusively decided by the power to weight ratio or not?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 12:45:47 I can’t seem to get my tank to move quickly despite the fact that it has a much higher power to weight ratio than smaller tanks.
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:57:33 Is some of the total torque of all the motors combined lost when you stack them on top of each other?
plane-crazy 2019-05-03 15:58:19 Hmm
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:42:36 Is this considered slow?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:44:08 Oh lol I did not know that I was recording the sound
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:44:11 xD
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:48:30 I'm currently in the process of developing a breach loading cannon
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:48:52 that fires tnt shells
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:49:34 The main problem is not so much the breach mechanism but more over the magazine
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:50:32 The magazine has to carry 30 rounds and yet be a short (so not tall or long)
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:51:17 Because each of those things will interfere with gun depression and ideally you want have your gun be as depressed as a Hillary voter.
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:53:07 The rounds that my tank will shoot will be 5 block long tnt shells.
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:53:28 That will basically one shot any noob turret that it hits
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:53:55 Then next to main cannon will be a machine gun the rapidly fires tnt balls.
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:54:23 And on top of a turret will be some remote controlled turret used to target aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 04:55:19 but my dream will
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 21:25:38 Do you think I'll see a considerable increase in the speed of my tank if Replace ~2000 out of 2896 blocks with  ballast blocks set to 0.15 weight?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 21:26:19 why  you say that?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 21:28:03 Why?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 21:28:23 Do you think I'll see a considerable increase in the speed of my tank if Replace ~2000 out of 2896 blocks with  ballast blocks set to 0.15 weight?
plane-crazy 2019-05-04 21:30:01 who?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:32:56 Welp now I gotta replace almost every block in this tank with a ballast block (Ballast blocks specifically since they can have density as low as 0.15 while ballast beam can only go as low as 0.28) out of hopes that I can increase the speed of this tank by around 30-40%.
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:33:25 RIP me
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:34:33 What's with the downvotes?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:36:21 So ballast beams at minimum density weigh as much as a normal 4 block beam right?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:39:01 How the hell do you break wheels?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:39:18 with what?!?!?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:40:06 You sure it isn't the motors that break?
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:40:35 I could really use something around the lines of that
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:40:57 My tank is slow
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:41:21 send a screenshot
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:41:55 so use the sniping tool
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:42:12 *snipping*
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:43:17 too bad
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:43:31 I'm using discord on google
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:45:58 Just the wheels of my tank take up 1200 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-05-05 00:46:14 or somewhere around there
creations-chat 2019-05-20 23:55:15 The ultimate rough terrain crosser
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:02:59 What do friction blocks do?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:03:49 so they make wheels more efficient?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:04:45 So do friction blocks make wheels more effecient?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:05:15 yes or no?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:06:45 What is the use of friction blocks??
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:07:06 YES
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:07:49 So they make wheels more efficient?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:07:59 Oof
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:08:33 It's a bad thing that all my tank's wheels use half blocks around the exterior
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:08:49 So have virtually nowhere to put the  friction blocks on.
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:10:32 no I mean that my wheels won't have a lot of friction
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:10:48 Which means my tank will continue to slide a lot and be very hard to control.
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:11:23 and that most of the torque generated my motors is being wasted.
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:13:22 Hopefully he'll add friction slabs and wedges soon
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:15:33 <@!486674992981999648> Thanks your a life saver.
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:20:37 With the implemenation of ballast blocks to lighten the frame of the tank by 33% and the use of frictions blocks I expect there to be an considerable increase in the speed of my tank.
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:22:13 who?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:22:44 I've been working on this specific tank model for at least 20 hours
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:23:15 I expect it to be to the most combat effective tank in the game when it's done.
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:23:59 It will fire 4-5 block tnt shells that will 1 shot all of those noob turrets and have a ball machine gun also built into the turret.
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:24:21 Nah
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:24:38 All I have to do I get the tank to the hills and go in a hull down position
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:25:47 Has anyone invented a compact reloadable tnt cannon yet?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:38:13 ..
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:38:30 good meme good meme
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:41:53 wait I checked my rank and realize that I got a warning
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:41:58 I wonder what for
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:48:04 I wish I could place ballast blocks down with custom settings already on them
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:48:20 so I don't have to click on each block to set it to 0.15
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:48:36 HOW?
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:49:41 
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 00:51:58 oh thanks
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 03:41:28 When you only have upload speeds of 1.4 megabytes per second and you try to load something
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 04:10:32 OOf I can spawn my vehicle properly because my wifi is too bad
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 04:11:27 whenever I try this happens
plane-crazy 2019-05-21 04:11:38 
bug-reports 2019-05-21 04:15:58 Oh I have a more seriously situation of physics acting before a creation gets loaded
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 01:45:53 I've conducted some more experiments on magnet powered magazines
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 01:46:45 It's called accidentally falling off the edge of the map in your giant tank
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 01:50:14 Isn't this a beautiful piece of engineering?
creations-chat 2019-05-22 01:52:15 Improved interleaved roadwheel tank chassis
creations-chat 2019-05-22 01:53:43 It's around 20-30% lighter.
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 12:28:19 Has anyone successfully built a cannon with a magazine?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 12:28:42 That fires tnt rounds that is.
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:43:04 I think I am getting very close to developing the first compact tnt block shell magazine.
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 21:44:49 With the development of the compact magazine, using multi-shot cannons that fire tnt blocks will become practical for the first time
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:25:59 Anyone know any compact mechanism that I can use to  move the bolt (the grey thing) back and forth?
plane-crazy 2019-05-22 22:26:16 oh wait
help 2019-05-22 22:26:55 Anyone know any compact mechanism that I can use to  move the bolt (the grey thing) back and forth 7 blocks?
help 2019-05-22 22:29:51 <@!421848903361757184> But pistons are extremely unreliable.
help 2019-05-22 22:32:02 Example in the case of this application?
plane-crazy 2019-05-29 23:44:50 I wonder when the physics enacting before the creation spawns glitch will be fixed
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:42:27 Progress update on compact breach-loading cannon development. The entire contraption detonates when the piston moves while the magnets that move the ammunition are on.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:43:06 No
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:43:09 I like Terrains
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:43:49 The sad thing is this is probably the most functional breach loading cannon that has been developed so far.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:44:56 And it  still explodes
creations-chat 2019-05-30 00:46:08 Compact breach loading cannon and magazine development update.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:48:38 A cannon that is loaded from the breach (the back of the cannon).
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:49:20 It's the only way to make a cannon capable of firing multiple times.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:49:27 The actual back.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:50:01 Sadly nobody seems to be interested in making functional cannons.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:50:26 They all seem satisfied with useless prop cannons.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:51:43 This is hotter
help 2019-05-30 00:53:15 Would anyone be interested in helping me develop a high capacity magazine for tnt block shells?
help 2019-05-30 00:53:36 As of now mine explode.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:56:34 The problem with that design is dimensions.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:56:57 In my design the magazine is located on the side because that is the ideal position.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:58:20 If you make the  magazine too long or too tall you won't have much gun depression without making the turret very tall.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 00:58:51 Which makes the already massive vehicle that this would be mounted on have an even bigger profile.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:00:15 But if you extend the magazine sideways you won't have any problems because turrets always  move their cannons horizontally by  turning the entire turret.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:00:45 Instead of just the cannon.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:02:27 You can though in terms of height.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:03:44 Oh yah no.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:03:55 This is as small as it gets.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:04:25 That is if you want to shoot 5 block long shells.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:06:19 Developing the breach loading cannon in this game is like developing a nuclear bomb. It takes a lot of time and development.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:08:35 Exactly
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:09:17 Whoever is the  first to develop a fully function breach cannon and magazine pretty much is the Einstein of plane crazy.
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:13:59 not really
plane-crazy 2019-05-30 01:14:08 But preferably it ISN'T tall af.
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:18:19 Has anyone developed a compact tnt shell magazine that doesn't prematurely detonate the shells and cause everything to blow up?
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:19:13 Because I need a compacte tnt shell magazine that doesn't blow up
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:19:21 And everything I have made so far blows up.
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:36:07 do rockets work underwater in this game?
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:49:08 Do  rockets work under water?
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:49:44 So rocket propelled torpedoes would probably work?
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:50:24 [no
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:50:30 Shrek is love Shrek is life
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:50:58 I'm in a Shrek cult
plane-crazy 2019-05-31 02:52:04 Ogres are like onion they have layers.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 17:20:19 I've just come to accept the fact that I'll never be able to drive my beloved creation.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 17:23:00 I spent like 2 days worth of gameplay for nothing
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 17:29:53 
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 17:34:23 
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:04:15 I've done some testing and I've concluded that suspension by far plays the biggest role is the speed of large ground vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:04:54 if your vehicle does noe allow the wheels to have high vertical traverse, you will get horrible speed.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:06:24 because if it doesn't have wheels or treads, it doesn't touch the ground.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:06:31 meaning it's not a ground vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:27:42 The perfect large vehicle wheel, combing a smooth ride with sufficient armor.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:29:25 Exactly, that's why interleaved roadwheels are the way to go
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:29:55 It actually has great speed
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:30:03 it moves as fast as small tanks
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:30:16 provided it has the right suspensions
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:30:19 264 max
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:31:02 as of now, I am developing the only chassis large enough for proper functional cannons
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:31:43 this is the prototype cannon I've been working on
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:31:55 Problem is it fires one or two shots and then explodes.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:32:15 It uses a opposite attraction magnet magazine.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:33:47 tank chassis traversing train tracks like it's nothing
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:35:58 If only someone developed a transmission for my tank. That way  I could just use a single rotating drive wheel to move the tank.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:36:11 gae
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:36:33 those wheels tho
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 18:49:52 This could go 3-4 times faster if it had a suspension system that gave the wheels more horizontal transitional freedom.
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 19:07:31 Ok I've fixed the transmission
plane-crazy 2019-06-09 19:07:46 I now get like double the vertical traversion.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:42:47 Well.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:42:51 I've returned
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:43:19 I've concluded that making a cannon that fires multiple tnt rounds is not feasible.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:44:23 No matter what kind of magazine you make, no matter how pressure insensitive you make the tnt rounds, they will always set of while still in magazine and destroy everything.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:44:33 One after the other
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:45:17 And I've spent at least 10 hours trying to develop one to no avail.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:45:29 they all detonated prematurely.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:46:41 So I'm working on this "tiny" thing.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:46:57 Oh I've gone through at least 5 different designs
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:47:44 And by designs I mean magazines.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:48:31 Because it's not so much loading that's hard but rather it's having the shells move inside a compact magazine without detonating.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:50:19 I mean theoretically you could make a magazine that could do the job without detonating the shells, but the magazine would have to be so large that you couldn't even fit it on the largest of chasses.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:51:44 And I spent around 2 days of gameplay developing this, to carry a large magazine for a giant cannon.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:52:56 But that would require a lot of barrels.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:53:05 If you wanted a lot of shots.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:53:20 nothing
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:54:25 Another problem with that concept is if you had lets say 9 barrels, it would require 9 separate keys to fire them individually.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:55:50 exactly
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:57:34 This is the closest I ever got to a functional compact magazine.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:58:19 There are magnets on both sides
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:59:22 the magnets pull on each other and that causes the loose wall portion at the bottom to push the tnt round into the feeding area.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 02:59:37 The rounds are then pushed into the gun breach via a compact piston.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:02:37 No
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:02:42 I know what I'm doing
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:02:53 And I know there is no way to do this.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:03:37 My dream of building a fast heavy tank with a functional reloading cannon that 1 shots everything in sight is dead.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:04:04 lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:04:17 
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:04:36 This was coincidence a swear
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:13:11 spinning
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:37:00 I bet that rocket truck has a keybinding for antz
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:37:41 yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:38:17 It's a sarcastic joke referring to how each of those 12 rockets probably has a firing key.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:38:55 So the user's hands will probably be all over the place when they're fighting.

plane-crazy 2019-07-20 05:36:09 We ran out of work to do and were riding in the back of a track so we just went into the parking while have the radio on.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 05:36:26 And toto africa just started playing and someone decided to blast it.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 05:36:46 And we did right in front of all the girls involved in the volunteer effort
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 05:36:54 It was great.

plane-crazy 2019-07-20 06:07:41 Why are we listening to this?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:32:44 This thing drives surprisingly slow considering that it's powered by 104 motors
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:32:58 wait wrong picture
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:34:03 
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:35:26 I guess giant vehicles can't move at a fast speed no matter how good their suspension is and how high of a power to weight ratio they have
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:44:18 This thing moves at "363" sps
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:45:08 What would you suggest I use for down force?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:45:31 h0t
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:45:35 It's now a big cat
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:48:31 So anyways what would you suggest I use to keep my tank on the ground?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:49:41 What would be the ideal torque for this?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:50:05 *7*
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:50:13 For speed
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:50:25 104 total
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:50:47 I was hoping it would spread terror in the eyes of people.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:50:57 Seeing a large vehicle move at fast speeds
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:51:17 This goes 363 over rough terrain
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:51:53 But it doesn't actually appear to go that fast
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:52:20 It was originally powered by 3 motors per wheel
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:52:48 But I intend to make it heavily armored
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:52:59 with 15 block thick frontal armor
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:53:17 Because it's a damn tank
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:53:30 That's why it needs to be 15 blocks thick
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:53:55 There isn't any to the extent of my knowledge
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:54:05 That would look ugly
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:57:13 Ok so repeat again
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 22:57:27 what is immune to gunfire?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 23:00:04 So what happens when you add too much torque?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 23:15:25 Should I put 10 torque on each motor with this vehicle?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 23:25:59 Anyone know why my suspension keeps bunching up?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 23:45:58 Did a speed  test.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 23:46:03 Reached 684 before the road stopped.
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 23:52:38 For a brief period my tank reached 692 speed
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 23:53:08 Take in mind that it's lik 243 blocks i nsize
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:03:09 I made my tank amphibious
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:03:34 only problem is that it moves at a max of 8 mph
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:03:38 and mostly it's jsut 3
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:03:54 That is when it's in the water
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:05:56 
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:05:58 How does this even float
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:08:55 tank meeting?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:09:44 Anyone want to see my tank in action?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:10:00 No potato computers allowed
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:14:11 I'mma try to make the fastest boat in the game
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:14:25 It will have a single propeller powered by 28 motors.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:14:37 *35*
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:16:56 No
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:17:14 I twill succeed because I will use cloth cylinder as gears
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:21:06 But first
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:21:45 Can somebody show me how the hell to build a boat propeller?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:22:11 I haven't build a single thing with one since the plane tutorial that I went through when I first joined.

plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:30:09 so h0t
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:30:47 pls add tracks
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:32:15 It's highly inpractical\
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:32:31 how are you going to fold it up to fit inside a rocket
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:32:51 put does it walk?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:41:44 Can someone send me a picture of a propeller on a ship in this game?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:44:34 That's what a I mean
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 00:47:54 Such precision
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:09:32 Wait so I use wing panels for a propeller?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:17:15 Teleport area 51 to the end problem solved
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:32:31 Contrary to what I was told, my ship engine does work. I'm going to lengthen it and put a 1 by 1 cylinder in the middle and 3 by 3 cylinders around it to every increase it's power.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:33:05 Hopefully it turns out to be the most powerful ship engine ever built.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:34:39 And do the rockets move a propeller?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:39:16 Then technically it's just a bunch of tiny engines instead of a single engine.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:51:51 Yes that's exactly what I did
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:51:56 But realized a fatal flaw
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:52:18 the smaller cylinders actually don't move as fast the exterior of the large cylinders
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:52:27 So I reversed it
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:52:48 Now there's a tiny cylinder in the middle surrounded by large cylinders
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:52:52 high
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:53:25 Exactly
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:53:45 I'm now making it  48 motor engine
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:54:08 You sure?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:54:50 This is probably already going to be one of the fastest boats ever built.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:55:10 Your right I'll make it 64 motors
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:56:10 You can run 100 motors with no problem if you have a good computer
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 01:56:47 I swear if this boat takes off the ground during testing
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:03:50 It's too powerful
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:03:53 the engine fell apart
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:27:17 I fixed the engine by adding more supports
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:44:41 Ok my 60,000 torque power engine is complete.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 02:45:02 Pretty stronk

plane-crazy 2019-07-21 03:15:53 I'm going at a speed of 52 on land on my barely built ship
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 03:21:30 What is considered a fast speed for a ship?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 04:57:11 Welp propellers turn out to be very ineffective. I was way in over my head.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 04:57:38 What moves around 200 over land only moves 12 in water
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:05:23 I have one last idea
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:05:37 An attack stealth submarine
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:06:12 With 30 guided missiles.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:06:31 No need to be so salty
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:06:55 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:08:18 Do people use magnets to attach their ships together?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:18:47 I think a stealth submarine would be on of the most lethal vehicles in pvp. All that one would have to do is spawn, submerge, move out a bit, and then proceed to one shot everybody from beyond their visual range with guided missiles launched from under water.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:22:59 However.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:23:44 The ground vehicles would have a difficult time crossing the rugged and mountainous terrain surrounding the ocean
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:24:31 Those who only have ground vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:25:27 around half the people would be defenseless because the only thing they brought to the battle would be a stationary noob turret.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:26:39 Oof

plane-crazy 2019-07-21 05:28:40 yus
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 21:41:12 Does anyone have a good guided missile design they’re willing to share? I’m not very fond of reinventing the wheel.
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 21:41:55 I know that
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 21:42:14 But the problem is the missiles are not well designed
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 21:42:35 They lean forward
help 2019-07-21 21:43:32 Does anyone have a reliable airworthy guided missile?
help 2019-07-21 22:55:07 But bombs can’t be launched from a submarine
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 22:59:06 So basically do all planes in this game have to tilt to turn?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 22:59:32 So basically do all planes in this game have to tilt to turn?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:00:10 So that means my missile also has to tilt to turn
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:00:41 Yes or no?
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:13:42 Missile so far
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:14:34 It does use controls surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:15:21 I didn’t
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:15:25 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:15:37 No I don’t
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:17:12 You can come see for yourself, I don’t have half tnt
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:44:24 Welp from my tests I’ve learned that my missiles do no damage
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:44:38 The tnt just expodes
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:44:50 And does no damage to its surroundings
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:45:05 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 23:45:11 PvP is on
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 00:00:27 Is it a known glitch for tnt to not work in pvp mode?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 00:40:43 Is 684 fast for a tank?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 00:41:01 No
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 00:41:22 Well rip
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 00:44:20 I’mma have to increase the width of the tank then if I’m going to make it any faster
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:09:59 What is considered a fast speed for a a tank?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:11:21 But why would I want my tank to fly?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:12:12 It would just expose the unarmored underbelly of the tank
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:35:05 I can’t believe I’m actually trying to make a tank fly
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:35:26 This is stupid
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:36:04 Why does a tank that moves at 684 speed on the ground need to fly to be considered fast?
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:38:19 It looks like a rover now
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:41:10 I give up. I’m going to need to slap like 20 jet engines onto that 2431 block tank in order to make it fly
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 01:41:17 It’s just not worth it
plane-crazy 2019-07-22 02:12:53 Are bomber planes the deadliest vehicles in game?
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 00:59:37 Can propeller blades be used as spoilers?
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:49:16 What's the current speed record for any vehicle in the game?
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 20:02:57 is drag a mechanic in this game?
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 20:07:44 Is drag a mechanic in the game?
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 20:08:27 so adding a pointed nose to an aircraft will make it go faster?
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 20:08:54 oh
creations-chat 2019-08-27 20:12:32 Some derp plane I created, goes at a max speed of 400.
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 20:14:55 So generally the larger something is, the slower it will be even if it has the same power to weight ratio?
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 20:15:12 Correct?
creations-chat 2019-08-27 22:43:15 89,000 torque  power heavy tank with interleaved roadwheels, half-block side skirts, and 12 block thick frontal armor nearing completion.
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 02:58:00 Does ice reduce friction?
creations-chat 2019-08-29 01:59:39 Super heavy tank in its prototype stage.
creations-chat 2019-08-29 02:07:32 Like I said, still in prototype stage. I'm just trying to get the thing to completely work.
creations-chat 2019-08-29 02:09:07 Regardless of the fact, its design prioritizes protection over beauty.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 17:52:43 Hmm it appears that adding more wheels to a tank does not increase speed, despite the total power output being more.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 17:59:42 Any ideas on how to make giant vehicles accelerate quickly?
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:00:02 That's the best option?
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:00:34 Mine is a super heavy tank
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:01:09 it's about 6800 blocks right now. So
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:03:02 The tank is pretty slow, but from combat tests, it's shown to be pretty resilent.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:03:58 The tank was able to withstand a barrage of around 18 rockets without having any crucial parts damaged.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:06:22 I strapped around 60 super rockets to the tank about 15 minutes ago, it took a while to accelerate but supposedly reached a speed of 413.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:06:52 Problem is that it didn't stay on the ground.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:07:08 it's alright for a 6800 block vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:52:33 Well I got a recording of my tank in action: https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cqjUFdt0e9
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:54:53 I figured out I could drastically increase the speed by using the rockets as a downwards force on the tank. For instance, when the tank is on the move, it usually for some reason leans backwards to where only its hind wheels are touching the ground. But through the use of rockets I was able to keep all the wheels on the ground and thus take full advantage of the 98 motors powering the tank.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:55:44 It reached about 430 speed before I ran out of road to drive it on.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:57:07 No I mean I literally drove it off the spawn area and into the void.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:57:47 technically when the tank is offroading it spends most of its time in the air.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 18:58:35 Which is of great annoyance to me. Because when the tank is in the air it's wheels aren't making contact with the ground and accelerating it further.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 19:00:38 The main problem is that giant land vehicles like to pretend that gravity doesn't exist.
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 19:05:11 Should I reduce the turret height?
plane-crazy 2019-08-29 19:05:55 It would save weight and thus add more speed and acceleration. However this would come at the cost of gun depression and elevation.
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:11:51 Any design change suggestions for my super heavy tank?
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:12:32 Acer is not known for their beautiful screens
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:13:19 Anyways
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:13:28 Any design change suggestions?
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:13:54 it does
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:14:09 the chassis is only ~2500 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:14:20 the entire structure is 6815 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:15:04 I can make the turret shorter, but in turn would be compromising armor.
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:15:30 I could make reduce the height of the turret, but that would impair gun depression.
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:15:54 a
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:16:56 negative ricochet?
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:17:40 Actually angling the thing wouldn't do anything in this game.
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:18:19 It fires a salvo of 4 missiles.
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:19:44 Frontal view of the tank
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:20:07 I know
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:20:14 There is no armor.
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:20:23 Blocks are blocks
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:20:29 They are all damaged the same
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:21:14 it takes a while to accelerate but it can reach a speed above 400
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:22:03 I did use a bunch of rocket in the test in which it went to that speed however, not in the way that you think.
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:23:06 I used the rockets to keep the tank on the ground, so that all the moving wheels stayed in contact with the ground and thus actually contributed to the speed.
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:23:11 I have a video example of the test
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:23:39 Can I post a link to the video?
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:24:50 The turret needs to be big to have good gun depression.
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:25:07 Which is crucial when your tank towers above everybody else.
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:25:58 This is the link to the speed test of the super heavy tank: https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cqjUFdt0e9
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 03:27:45 I could probably inch out a bit more speed by increasing the motors from a speed of 20 to 50
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 00:48:52 Anyone know any kind of suspension that would be able to handle loads of 6800 blocks?
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 00:51:38 it's i
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 00:54:04 I love how I continue to get updated messages on discord while google says there's no internet.

plane-crazy 2020-07-09 17:30:52 Which will be used to mount this turret.
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 17:31:37 For the track?
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 17:32:32 But the turret is supposed to be used in combat
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 17:33:42 What good will that do?
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 17:34:12 That'll decrease the fighting effectiveness of the turret by decreasing the armor.
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 17:36:36 My goal isn't to make a pretty tank, my goal is to make a tank that actually has the characteristics that tanks are designed for.

plane-crazy 2020-07-17 00:14:25 But what I do know is that it has nothing to do with the game.
general 2021-01-17 04:28:55 Should I put a turret on it or make it a casemate with an tnt ball auto-cannon and use ropes attached to the suspension to allow for elevation? Or both?
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 04:42:31 Should I add a turret-mounted rocket launcher to this or make a tnt ball autocannon and use strings to adjust the suspension to all for elevation? Or both and make it some sort of char B1 monstrosity.

plane-crazy 2021-01-19 05:10:03 It is very prone to jamming though this may have to do with the fact that it's built sideways.
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 05:13:47 The next magazine to be built will probably be a conveyor belt. If problems as emerge with that one then it would be reasonable to presume that sideways magazine designs are less reliable.

general 2021-01-19 06:48:21 should be able to fit around 30 of them in 13 by 7  by 7 magazine
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 07:42:00 Alright so the end product will be a semi-automatic magnet-powered cannon that fires a 5 block tnt projectile. It will store about 30 rounds  in a 13 x 7 x 7 magazine. The cannon should be able to fire a single round every 2-3  seconds. The cannon, when elevated 3 blocks off a surface, will have an upwards elevation of around 30 degrees and a downward elevation of around 24 degrees. Given the size of the such a weapon, it's only feasible usage would either be in a stationary turrets or in ~3000 block-range super-heavy casemate vehicles (you could theoretically make a super-heavy turreted vehicle, but it would probably have quite a high center of gravity).
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 07:43:23 Though you could probably scale it down considerably if you gave it a lower-capacity magazine
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 07:49:09 Grammatical corrections made.
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 07:49:51 I have now
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 07:49:58 Thank you for sharing that
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 07:50:46 How practical does the described cannon seem?
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 07:52:09 I'm worried that it'll be extremely vulnerable to air attacks.
general 2021-01-19 18:15:19 Which is better magnet or suspension cannons?
general 2021-01-19 18:58:18 Are explosive blocks still dangerous to use as armor if it's hit by an explosive in spite of having both blast pressure and blast radius turned down to 0?
general 2021-01-19 19:00:26 If a shredder bug attacked a vehicle covered in cutters would it destroy itself?
general 2021-01-19 19:00:53 Creative solution to the shredder bug problem
general 2021-01-19 19:16:43 What mechanical mechanism should I use to push projectiles into the magnet accelerator?
general 2021-01-19 19:20:30 What's are some reliable piston mechanisms?
general 2021-01-19 19:41:17 What should I use to retract the springs?
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 19:43:15 What should I use to retract these springs?
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 19:44:16 I have bad past experiences with pistons
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 19:44:29 they seem to be extremely unreliable
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 19:44:38 has that changed?
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 19:51:02 Tried pistons they don't work.
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 19:51:37 Tried ropes, makes the mechanism very slow
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 19:52:19 I set them to make speed
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 19:53:33 *max
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 19:53:56 takes around 8 seconds to retract and extend mechanism
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 19:54:54 each step now has to be done manually,
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 19:55:58 Where's the furry profile picture?
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 19:56:17 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 19:56:23 must be wrong person
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 19:58:04 So any other ideas on how to retract the springs?
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 20:01:28 If this issue is resolved then high-capacity semi-automatic cannons capable of firing long tnt block projectiles will finally become a reality.

plane-crazy 2021-01-21 07:12:02 I may have create the first semi-automatic tnt-block cannon https://streamable.com/c5ly7d
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 07:12:33 Who did?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 07:12:53 Repeating cannons?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 07:13:00 That fire tnt block shells?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 07:13:11 Have a picture of it?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 07:13:32 damn
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 07:13:45 how did its magazine mechanism operate?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 07:14:15 So it didn't fire tnt blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 07:14:20 it fired tnt balls
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 07:15:55 Damn people aren't very fond of sharing stuff
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 07:17:25 looks good
