help 2022-07-22 12:04:44 My guess is that the game marks a new location every few ticks or whatever you call it, and draw a line between that location and the last marked one. If you spin fast enough, the distance between those locations will become bigger, making a less rounded pattern, if you were to slow the engines down a bit, you might get polygons, like pentagons or octagons
general 2022-07-22 16:05:37 I am quickly going insane

plane-crazy 2022-08-03 18:12:54 Alright, so I'm making my first truck, and I've noticed that, mainly the inner wheel is like spasming when I'm turning

general 2022-08-06 16:47:09 There
creations-chat 2022-08-06 22:40:37 I have a build surpassing 1M speed
creations-chat 2022-08-06 22:42:52 Yes, no, yes
But you're going to be very disapointed
creations-chat 2022-08-06 22:45:51 Yes you will lmao, want me to send you it on DM's? I don't have image perms
creations-chat 2022-08-06 22:51:49 I have a half-decent F-14 Tomcat, I just don't dare posting it here (and can't) because of this community lmao
the-dump 2022-08-07 01:43:39 Not that I don't agree with some things that are being said, but ya'll mean
the-dump 2022-08-07 01:44:09 Apple knows the real strategy, makes issues and sells the solutions
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:17:30 Too few motors in the tracks, I'm guessing. So there's not many "axels" in the treads, making that pointy shape when it attempts to bend
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:18:18 Make a new track, or live with it, I guess?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:19:09 Yeah... Making the hull on a tank with treads is a pain anyways, you can't really build anywhere close to the treads without breaking them
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 14:20:32 I don't make tanks ðŸ˜›
bot-central 2022-08-08 17:39:30 !rank
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:21:11 Are there any good ways to make a supersonic missile not bounce on impact? I've tried suspension, on almost all settings, and I've also tried double-suspension. Any alternatives?
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:21:36 Maybe the cockpit is supposed to be thin? ðŸ™‚
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:21:49 Welp, there goes my idea
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:26:38 Oh, that's often because small jets perform better, so these super-thin cockpits are usually accompanied with super-thin jets as a whole
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:27:18 Stabilise? As in to not wobble? As in to fly straight?
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:27:49 Why not just put gravity to 0?
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:28:15 Then maybe don't try making a spaceship without basically any chance of succeeding
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 16:10:52 Do a good job
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 16:54:52 Alright, so I have put my rocket onto a mount, and when I try replacing the motors with motor 2 or aiming, the rocket doesn't fire. When I put a regular motor in between the rocket and the aiming module, it works. But the motor spins on its own, which throws off the aim. If I lock the motor, the rocket won't fire, if I connect the back and front of the motor to prevent it from turning, the rocket won't fire. 

Does anybody here speak plane crazy bullshittery?
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 16:56:36 I know it's known, I just want to know if there's any way around it
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 16:32:08 The control surfaces would mostly just allow it to spin a lot faster ðŸ™‚ You should probably  get around that double disconnector configuration, as the remaining part of the detacher will still carry weight, and make the missile's weight uneven. You should probably use an anchor block instead of trying to weigh down the base with regular blocks.
creations-chat 2022-08-13 21:01:50 Wait, since when did I get attachment perms lmao
creations-chat 2022-08-13 21:18:56 You can show how many helium blocks you have left to build with, I guess?
creations-chat 2022-08-13 21:21:24 Like, if you want to show how many helium blocks you've used, you can show in a picture/video how many helium blocks are left when you're done with the builds (since it shows how many more you can build with next to the block in the block menu), from there, I guess the one checking the proof can make out the number.

I've never done this before, though

help 2022-08-22 17:09:14 You can use the magnets for engines, but they wouldn't stick to other builds. 

There's a reason magnets don't have an "ignore self"/"ignore others" option

Oh wait, nose isn't supposed to be longer, it just looked short no pic 3
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:23:31 I don't get how, and I don't get why cursing/bad words has become the norm in arguments

(can't be bothered waiting for the cooldown, so I'll just extend this one)

People cursing is definitely significant, since it escalates the argument. Which makes it impossible to have one, because it just becomes a curse fight, like this one right here, instead of holding an actual argument

help 2022-09-23 23:57:53 I am attempting to make air-to-ground missiles, and I'm noticing that my rockets aren't working. Why is that?
creations-chat 2022-09-24 00:22:23 I'd very much like advice on how to improve my F-18, as I'm still working with it (mostly armament at this point)
https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1023026276958740501
creations-chat 2022-09-24 00:26:07 I don't follow your logic there, but alright.

I think I'm too far gone to redo those parts completely, but what could I improve about them?

<@237359768405147649> How could I accomplish that?
creations-chat 2022-09-24 01:21:12 Well, as I'm relatively new to this kind of building, I've kind of cornered myself in design. While the nose could probably be fixed, the landing gear can't be properly hid without replacing half of the motor lock, which means half of the entire build. As mentioned in the <#384025409945337856> message, I can't place the wing motors further inward, as placing it further inward would just create huge exposed locks in the back of the jet. 

But how would you blend the nose?
creations-chat 2022-09-24 01:29:50 How did you do the flush panels?
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 16:28:05 Convinced this guy that pressing alt+F4 single-fires rockets
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 16:29:04 I think he's new
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 16:29:09 He asked how to fire rockets
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 16:29:13 Somebody said F
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 16:29:15 And the rest is in the SS
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 16:29:35 Although, single-firing for rockets would be nice
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 16:29:45 Without a hundred keybinds
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 16:31:19 Could be, but I don't care
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 16:32:42 On an unrelated note, I've made a pretty good missile, at least by my standards
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 20:53:45 Yes, I think metal is immune from cutters, for example
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 20:53:47 Or so I've heard
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 20:54:12 I don't really  utilise their powers,  beyond ice for slippery and landing gear, and fabric for wheels
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 21:22:17 Hm, maybe I shouldn't use my friends as a primary source
help 2022-11-06 13:11:52 So, I have a build which requires two parts to be angle-locked equally for the cockpit. But for some reason, one of the angle-locks keeps angling for a short second after releasing the angling button, which makes it asymmetric, and kind of ruins the whole build
help 2022-11-06 13:12:01 Both sides are completely identical
help 2022-11-06 13:12:58 Or, well, not completely. But as in no collisions, same motors and settings in the same places, etc..
help 2022-11-06 13:14:37 What are those?
help 2022-11-06 13:16:43 And now, suddenly, without any fixing or changes.... it works again
help 2022-11-06 13:16:45 Yay..?
help 2022-11-23 22:45:48 I'm trying to attach weapons to my heli, using motor 2's to angle down the rockets and fireworks. However, whenever I assemble the heli, the entire thing just breaks. The cause seems to be the motor 2's used for the weapons
help 2022-11-23 22:45:50 How do I get around this?
help 2022-11-23 22:46:43 Sounds like a bad solution, is there no workaround or anything?
help 2022-11-23 22:47:13 *Pain*
help 2022-11-23 22:48:05 Yeah, that's what I've done in the past, but because of how I'm going to use this heli, I wanted the angled weapons really bad
help 2022-11-23 22:48:41 Yeah, I tried that, but I have no space for extra keybinds like that
help 2022-11-23 22:49:34 Uh, do you want me to say all of them?
help 2022-11-23 22:51:09 Mhm, that's the issue. If I'm say going in for an attack, I don't want to have to prepare the angle 20s before going in, I want to be able to change it in the moment without putting my hands off the mouse
help 2022-11-23 22:51:21 Well, I'll just to stationary weapons
help 2022-11-23 22:51:27 I'll be using custom missiles anyways, I guess

help 2022-12-28 15:06:35 So, I'm making a ship. My first one, in fact. I'm trying to make the hull with angle-locking, unfortunately. I have made the very "tip" of the front of the ship, but now I need to fade the angle of the hull. And I don't know how to do that smoothly, considering I'll be needing multiple angle locked hull side pieces.
help 2022-12-28 15:07:56 Image for comparison: (And yes, I might have made the hull too deep, but that's on purpose, as to fit VLS missiles into it
creations-chat 2023-01-01 01:32:24 I mean, you don't even have to place hovers on every rotor. You could just ignore the left one there

Yes, as they're all connected at the base, they'll spin each other.
help 2023-01-16 15:21:46 So, for my ship folds. I switched from motors to motor 2's, since they give more perfect angles, and are easier to use. But whenever I press the button to fold, it almost seems random which way it will go. How do I fix that?
help 2023-01-16 15:22:56 Or, more accurately. They almost exclusively fold inward
help 2023-01-16 15:22:58 Never outward
help 2023-01-16 15:31:32 Nvm, managed to DIY it with camera lock instead.

help 2023-03-06 19:15:44 Since I use 2x2 cylinder 2
help 2023-03-06 19:17:31 There is, but I'm using the 2nd 2x2 cylinder, which has a center block, instead of being uncentered. The half ball doesn't have a 2 version
help 2023-03-06 19:17:48 Which means they get misaligned
creations-chat 2023-04-08 20:04:40 I like it, I just don't like the unsmooth parts. If one builds a completely rounded build, one with no exposed stuff etc, it's meant to keep to that standard in my opinion
Also, feels kind of weird to me to be actively hunting down those who downvoted you
creations-chat 2023-04-08 23:46:57 Either try to balance the weight as well as possible using helium, ballast or just moving/removing or placing blocks in the front/back/left/right side of the heli, or try to compensate for the uneven weight by placing additional propellers on the side that's pulling down.

Or just use hover engines to create so much drag that you basically anchor in the sky lol
help 2023-04-09 11:22:11 So, I have in the past seen a glitch which teleports your seat to another player's plot. How does one do that?
help 2023-04-23 17:39:57 So, my Gripen is bugged. Whenever I assemble the motor lock, my disconnectors for the bombs stop working, rockets and fireworks freeze mid-air when fired, and the gun doesn't work. The chat also breaks, my messages don't get sent, and I can't despawn the build, or it takes like 5 minutes for the despawn to work
