plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:26:49 Whats the best way to power something that somewhat looks like a star destroyer
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:27:02 I tried helium
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:27:03 with engines
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:27:17 whats wrong with helium
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:27:26 how
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:27:37 how the heck am I supposed to get it off the ground
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:28:15 Try making a submarine without helium
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:28:18 or a blimp
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:28:22 or a star destroyer
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:28:24 its hard
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:28:37 Im thinking of just adding jet engines to power it
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:28:53 they are
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:29:03 my sub has one of those things on top
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:29:08 so i needed helium to balance it
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:29:11 otherwise it tipped
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:29:41 How much helium would be needed to make something neutral?
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:29:54 like where if I used engines to go up or down
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:30:10 Some do
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:30:17 if you have that thing on top
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:30:22 I know
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:30:32 but mine had that thing on top of the cylinder
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:30:36 and it kept tipping
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:30:46 no
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:30:54 ur trash
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:31:28 this kid is getting annoyin
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:31:35 Helium is for big air builds
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:31:38 like star destroyers
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:31:52 Mhm
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:32:05 Bruh
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:32:14 yep
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:33:35 grrR:
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:34:04 How am I supposed to make a star destroyer fly
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:34:06 without helium
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:34:48 whenever I fly its unstable
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:34:57 it can go up but if I go to fast I go out of control
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:35:10 like if im turning directions
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:35:13 and still going
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:35:18 it goes out of control
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:36:05 Im pretty sure they can be in air
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:36:33 ur a dorito
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:36:40 It wont matter
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:36:43 I will make it fly
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:36:47 no matter how bad it is
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:37:51 How set gravity>
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:37:53 oh
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:37:56 is it a gamepass
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:38:00 dam it
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:38:11 are vip serve free?
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:38:18 how get
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:38:23 ok
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:47:40 I think I just realized
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:47:42 my mistake
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:47:55 I left the engines on only on and off
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:48:25 hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:48:48 Its still somewhat ok in combat
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:49:02 I dont got a vehicle for actual dogfighting tho
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:49:18 I have a bomber somewhat
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 01:49:21 but thats it
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 21:02:24 I’m trying to put 3 micro tie fighters in my star destroyer and it’s so hard
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 21:02:32 I copy the design and it doesn’t work
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 21:02:55 When I copy the design alone without the star destroyer and it works

plane-crazy 2020-11-25 20:04:18 i have a star destroyer with a functional tie figther
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 20:04:25 the tie itself isent as effectiv
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 20:04:38 and the ship only has some bombs and 4 turrets
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 20:04:43 but its good enough
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 20:12:07 what is that
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 20:12:24 hammer

plane-crazy 2020-11-25 20:13:33 The only time I get blacklisted is when the wreck my of star destroyer falls on somebodys plot because I released then detonated my bombs But didn't check if one was left behind and they are stored in the engines
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 20:16:58 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-25 20:17:02 everything is fine

bug-reports 2020-11-25 20:51:58 I tried make a 3x3 tie fighter before and it had 4 control surfaces for up/down, however it did it very slowly, but in flight it tipped over a bit onto its side and was able to go up and down much faster despite the controls surfaces for left/right being a quarter of the number that i had for up/down

bug-reports 2021-01-30 19:17:05 Ive noticed that if you have control surfaces set to manual that they are not effective
bug-reports 2021-01-30 19:17:23 even if they are all placed the same with same controls
bug-reports 2021-01-30 19:17:33 they arent as close to as effective as they are on automatic
bug-reports 2021-01-30 19:19:27 this is bad for people like me who dont like flying using cursor

plane-crazy 2021-09-23 17:12:54 Do you guys know if materials affect your build besides metal
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 17:14:04 Alright
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 17:14:34 Is there like a list somewhere on the wiki that lists all the stats or something
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 17:28:50 I have a helicopter that is somewhat based on a bell huey but I removed the doors and added big guns on both sides
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 17:30:24 Probably
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 17:30:32 About 4 gun blocks for each turret
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 17:30:39 But I should reduce it to 3 maybe
