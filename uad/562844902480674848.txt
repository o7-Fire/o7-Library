general 2021-03-09 20:21:02 TRUE
general 2021-03-09 20:22:19 because I'm on a garbage computer sometimes builds wont work on it. strangely enough, they work on other pcs

plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:20:27 imagine not using infinite fuel cant relate<:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:21:45 bruh just turn on infinite fuel and if not then replace normal blocks and beams for fuel blocks duh
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:22:54 perhaps rick could add the feature where if a fuel block is hit by a rocket, gun, ect. the fuel tank will explode
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:23:24 yea
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:23:25 but
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:23:52 perhaps the materials could become less of a decal and more of a real function
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:24:31 like if you use wood then if your build is light on fire it will spread to the wood
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:24:59 yea
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:25:00 but
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:25:02 sturdy
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:25:28 true but there arent that many mats
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:26:06 when i get a chance im going to put this in <#507673335816126509>
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:26:20 nobody else do it it is my idea
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:26:48 i know im going to get one
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:27:10 i have a build im going to use
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:27:55 it is extremely fast and powerful and i kill shredders on a daily basis with it
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:28:32 perhaps in an arena you need fule?
plane-crazy 2021-03-10 15:29:00 like no infinite fuel
