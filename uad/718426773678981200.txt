plane-crazy 2023-01-03 01:21:09 Hi, guys
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 01:21:25 Can you help me with my double-player blueprint?
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 01:22:43 thx
help 2023-01-03 01:24:46 Guys, help me pls with my idea
help 2023-01-03 01:25:16 I wanna make a double-player plane with double emount of weapons
help 2023-01-03 01:26:17 Its essence is that two vehicles are connected to each other. One of them is maximally loaded with weapons, in particular guided missiles. The other is just a mobile carrier, which also has weapons, but only ordinary rockets and machine guns.
help 2023-01-03 01:27:29 I tried with magnets, but they are unconnecting while we fly
help 2023-01-03 01:28:39 Pistons just can connect but they`re breaking when we try to fly...
help 2023-01-03 01:29:24 Do you know guys any other ways to connect two vehicles
help 2023-01-03 01:30:08 Oh, I have an idea!
help 2023-01-03 01:30:27 Do you have guys a big plane or a big heli?
help 2023-01-03 01:31:01 Yeah
help 2023-01-03 01:31:06 Yeah*
help 2023-01-03 01:31:34 It must work
help 2023-01-03 01:31:44 I tried but vehicles was too small
help 2023-01-03 01:31:52 and too big
help 2023-01-03 01:33:30 I have some experience in making water and sky drones of all types
help 2023-01-03 01:34:01 We must try
help 2023-01-03 01:34:07 Help me pls guys
help 2023-01-03 01:34:18 please
help 2023-01-03 01:34:50 just a few minutes if you have a big plane
help 2023-01-03 01:35:12 only make a frame in the fuselage
help 2023-01-03 01:35:50 Ukraine or Lithuania?
help 2023-01-03 01:36:11 –û, –ø—Ä–∏–≤—ñ—Ç, –∑–µ–º–ª—è—á–µ
help 2023-01-03 01:54:12 Yes, they do
help 2023-01-03 01:54:40 but when one of the players flies the other one is undocking
help 2023-01-03 02:03:45 have you a big air vehicle?
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 14:50:53 guys
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 14:51:00 I have an amazing idea
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 14:52:31 This idea is to make a pvp tournament for ten players where there will be two teams of 5 players
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 14:55:22 but everyone must show their blueprints for each of the three rounds: air-to-ground, sea-to-air, and sea-to-air-to-ground combat
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 14:56:04 shredders and explosive planes are prohibited
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 14:57:36 Then 2 ground, 1 air and 2 sea
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 14:59:37 If blueprint showing is unfair, than we just can implement a disqualification for a prohibited vehicle and clarification if the blueprint contains more than one vehicle
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 15:00:00 IMHO seems cool
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 15:00:13 we just need more people
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 15:00:45 and ideally a private server
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 15:02:25 Wanna join us?
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 15:03:03 in our idea
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 15:03:22 tournament 5 vs 5
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 15:03:56 when convenient
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 15:04:23 (._.)
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 15:05:06 we`ll start with ready-made blueprints
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 15:06:04 I mean that we won`t build nothing
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 15:06:17 We`ll just fight
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 15:07:12 but you can build some vehicle before tournament will start
plane-crazy 2023-01-15 15:09:16 Clean your tank? XD

general 2023-01-19 01:46:17 Hi
the-dump 2023-01-24 21:28:18 
the-dump 2023-01-24 21:29:02 F*ck russians
the-dump 2023-01-24 21:29:43 His nick means smt like looser in russian XD (Loshara`s)
the-dump 2023-01-24 21:30:08 You don`t know? LOL
the-dump 2023-01-24 21:30:56 POLITICS LOL
the-dump 2023-01-24 21:31:04 Are you stupid
the-dump 2023-01-24 21:31:25 Why am I asking lol
the-dump 2023-01-24 21:31:32 You are.
the-dump 2023-01-24 21:37:23 Because you`re russian lol
the-dump 2023-01-24 21:38:55 Until Pitun is deposed, all Russians will be guilty of the fact that the war continues. And that's the end of it.
the-dump 2023-01-24 21:40:05 You don't even realize that you've lived your whole life in the dump of the world's worst living conditions. Your "loving dad" Pitun began his political career by starting a war. Second Chechen war. He is one of the main repressionists in the whole world. But you still vote for him and fully support his actions. How can there be a place where all the biggest fools of the world have gathered? Very easy. This is Roisya.
the-dump 2023-01-24 21:44:00 By my logic, every Russian who can vote or fight only for their freedom, not even to stop the war, and did not do it, is guilty in that. Your substitution of concepts here is not appropriate at all, and only shows that you want to jump off the topic with stupid jokes and mockery.
the-dump 2023-01-24 21:47:01 I don`t think, but I know that silence is passive support of war.
the-dump 2023-01-24 21:47:13 Ok, I can try
the-dump 2023-01-24 21:51:44 <@698981800420048968> I'm not asking you to take my side, just listen, dear sir. If, let's just say, one day you live in a truly democratic country, then just imagine how you will look into the eyes of all those nice people who will surround you when you, which will certainly happen, find yourself in a position , when you need to tell something about these merciless times.
the-dump 2023-01-24 21:52:20 Does it suit you now, <@883063424614006878>
the-dump 2023-01-24 21:53:30 Your problem, fucking stupid shitter
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:05:13 Apparently, I just verbally crushed him. But no one perceives it that way. Why the fuck???
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:07:36 In case anyone just didn't get it, here's an explanation of why that is.
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:18:14 Yes, you wasn't. And that`s why I can say that I crushed you.
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:21:40 I imposed  a conversation on you on my terms.

He signed off on not being able to answer me on topic, instead just scoffing in an attempt to somehow defend himself.

the-dump 2023-01-24 22:22:11 It is called passive support

the-dump 2023-01-24 22:24:04 XD
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:27:05 No, because it has a clear definition. Passive supporter is anyone who can be perceived by the aggressor as someone who does not stand up to him, thus contributing to the aggression.
the-dump 2023-01-24 22:27:31 I didn`t say that passive supporter only must be able to vote

plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:35:42 The turret was interfering cuz it was at the bottom side
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:36:45 Now I gonna try to make a cube with disconnectable wheels and two smaller turrets at right and left sides
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:37:53 But how do I turn the aiming of one turret off to aim towards someone at left or right side
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:37:59 Like
plane-crazy 2023-05-18 03:38:57 The opposite turret to the one which I (or my friend) aim would push the plane's hull
