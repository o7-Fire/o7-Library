plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:20:29 Only because i want to play the game and show my commitment of these creations
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:20:49 No point in?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 06:20:52 Oh

creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:06:01 thanks
creations-chat 2018-12-04 02:06:56 use of ballast and propellers will do you good for submerging vehicles and making them resurface

plane-crazy 2018-12-04 03:37:39 ok
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 11:58:43 I would actually set a an auto key presser
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 11:59:14 Which is a banable offense
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 11:59:56 Its macroing
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:00:14 If you set a bot to do what you want it to do, and not actually play the game
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:00:22 Yeah thats trye
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:00:44 Runescape has thier own way of detecting bots
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:00:54 Sure
creations-chat 2018-12-04 12:03:37 Yes please
creations-chat 2018-12-04 12:08:01 Is it possible to make an anti that responds to the users mouse and not keys?
creations-chat 2018-12-04 12:08:09 Anti air***
creations-chat 2018-12-04 12:08:20 When you aim, that is
the-dump 2018-12-04 12:09:19 
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:15:36 Yeah pretty muh
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:15:57 Its not illegal, it wont get you in jail
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:16:17 But its a banable offence
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:17:33 Build a tank with treads and not only wheels
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:21:09 What
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:21:21 Did you just give out your details
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 03:30:04 A
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 03:58:37 Scaling tool would be a dream come true
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 04:00:05 <:bazook:506967559992508417> 🔫
help 2018-12-05 11:36:15 i do love racks myself
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:39:14 done that
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:40:33 so like "my building space too small" kind of folding plane?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:41:09 there is a problem though
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:41:35 if you make an aircraft with wings folded up
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:41:47 it will be acting on the x axis
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:41:50 so yaw
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:43:13 yess
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:44:15 try it
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:44:37 apparently helium blocks dont make your plane ascend
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:44:49 it justs makes them light
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:45:09 ok
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:45:36 i might do that then next time
creations-chat 2018-12-05 11:49:41 cool as hell
creations-chat 2018-12-05 11:50:29 wait a min
creations-chat 2018-12-05 11:50:49 how'd you automatically get the motors stationed to that spot
general 2018-12-05 11:52:42 more like 500 iq
general 2018-12-05 11:52:52 negative
creations-chat 2018-12-05 11:53:21 the beams are diagonal the moment you launch the aircraft
creations-chat 2018-12-05 11:53:24 into play
general 2018-12-05 11:53:58 hurr durr muh imperial systum
creations-chat 2018-12-05 11:54:18 struts
creations-chat 2018-12-05 11:54:50 oh
creations-chat 2018-12-05 11:54:53 yeah
creations-chat 2018-12-05 11:55:05 but why do you have motors on them already
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:56:11 try purposely ruining the game for everyone else by filling up your entire build space with thrusters
creations-chat 2018-12-05 11:56:29 rigto

plane-crazy 2018-12-14 10:40:11 you don't need to join the server again if you plan to crash it
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 10:40:23 we just went through this an hour ago
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 10:40:33 are you sure? because it looked like you didn't care
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 10:41:09 fuck this
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 10:41:14 <@163143541160148992>
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 10:42:30 doesn't change a thing, if someone catches you crashing the server with 1k lights or whatever, you'll be dealt with
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 10:43:22 he just said he loaded 1k lights
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 10:43:34 no one ever needs to have that many lights on a creation
plane-crazy 2018-12-14 10:43:57 and without reason, it's going to be an assumption that it is to cripple servers

help 2018-12-18 22:37:25 If you want to take it a step further, you could try using pistons to fill in gaps
help 2018-12-18 22:38:47 Uhh i don't think so

plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:13:28 Will people use the same rails with other players?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:26:31 yup
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:27:20 i don't think we can discuss ciggarettes

plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:27:50 or from flying it
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:28:28 so you think you've got alot of lights?
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:28:37 having too many lights is harmful
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:28:44 oh ok
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:30:02 that's a tonne of lights
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:30:18 but i can see why you'd add so many
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:30:29 the tardis has lights covering itself
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 00:30:41 (in the actual show)

plane-crazy 2018-12-21 08:58:49 lmao
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 09:38:04 Hey fellas
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 09:38:23 Whats the the thought on trusses, are they being added?
help 2018-12-21 09:39:17 <@!302264107363598341> motors themselves cannot lift a helicopter off of the ground
help 2018-12-21 09:40:11 With the assistance of a few rockets they can spin faster than the fastest speed a motor can spin itself
help 2018-12-21 09:40:20 If that makes any sense
help 2018-12-21 09:41:09 Although, it's not impossible to make a helicopter out of blades and motors without rockets or jets
help 2018-12-21 09:41:21 The blades just have to be long enough to make it possible
help 2018-12-21 09:42:59 I hope that helped
help 2018-12-21 09:59:46 Np
help 2018-12-21 10:01:42 To move the blue circle, add wing panels to guide it closer to where you want it to be
help 2018-12-21 10:02:06 Or vice versa with the yellow circle (centre of gravity)
help 2018-12-21 10:03:24 <@!280026855782744064>
help 2018-12-21 10:19:40 Oh
help 2018-12-21 10:20:03 You'll want to actually use propellor blades, first of all
help 2018-12-21 10:20:33 Second, reconstruct the motor to the center of the "yellow circle"
creations-chat 2018-12-21 10:22:20 I think you might wanna show your creation too, along with the speed in the same image
creations-chat 2018-12-21 10:23:22 Not exactly what i'm asking for
creations-chat 2018-12-21 10:23:51 Besides i'm not actually a mod, i'm only notifying
creations-chat 2018-12-21 10:25:23 Did you eject vertically?
creations-chat 2018-12-21 10:25:45 Hmmm
creations-chat 2018-12-21 10:26:36 Well, the reason why ejecting vertically isn't allowed is because of how easy it is to get speed with helium, but this is different as you're using a glitch and a spring
creations-chat 2018-12-21 10:26:54 I hope its allowed
help 2018-12-21 11:48:45 Sorry late reply
help 2018-12-21 11:49:41 You should remove all those unnecessary engine on the vehicle
help 2018-12-21 11:49:55 They add weight and complicate things

help 2018-12-22 03:07:24 i was thinking about those props where they're not stacked, rather one on each side

plane-crazy 2018-12-25 22:43:28 Its an easter egg
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 22:43:30 Apparently
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 22:46:45 Not that common
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 22:46:51 I havent gotten it in days
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 22:48:00 Well it depends how often you test drive your creation
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 22:50:28 It might
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 22:50:56 You can even test drive it for the first time and you still might get it

help 2019-09-11 03:22:27 sure
help 2019-09-11 03:22:44 even though i have like two massive delta wings
help 2019-09-11 03:23:07 your respect isn't big enough!
help 2019-09-11 03:26:43 if i fill the enterior with control panels and wing surfaces
help 2019-09-11 03:26:54 what should the ratio of panels to wings be?
help 2019-09-11 03:28:12 i see
help 2019-09-11 03:28:20 i'll do it evenly and see how it turns out
help 2019-09-11 03:28:37 then i can tune it

help 2019-09-11 03:29:44 also i think the ratio would be different for every plane that would have the same issue
help 2019-09-11 03:30:29 general ratio? 1:1 i guess
