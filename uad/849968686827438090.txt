general 2021-09-04 12:28:47 Hehehehe
general 2021-09-04 12:37:25 I’ll probably try to post creations for a week
general 2021-09-04 12:38:53 I think people are offended by the name Slave 1
general 2021-09-04 12:39:09 I mean, that’s the name for the Star ship
general 2021-09-04 12:39:18 Space ship I mean
general 2021-09-04 12:40:09 Oh sure
general 2021-09-04 12:50:32 Well, I think I’ll post my other creations tomorrow
general 2021-09-04 12:55:01 Hey, just gonna ask
general 2021-09-04 12:55:19 Should I remove “Slave 1” from the creation description?
general 2021-09-04 12:55:35 Not sure if people are offended by the spaceship’s name
general 2021-09-04 12:56:06 :/
general 2021-09-04 12:56:16 But the name is slave 1 in Star Wars
general 2021-09-04 12:56:44 D:
general 2021-09-04 12:56:56 Ok
general 2021-09-04 12:57:18 Uh, sure
general 2021-09-04 13:00:28 <:thconking:535171057649188865>
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:01:32 Give me feedback on my creations
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:04:49 If you think it is trash, I’m open to suggestions. Because I have to admit that Rodan’s head is not shaped very well and ghidorah’s neck and head is kinda not thought out. The slave 1 spaceship’s name may be offending but deal with it since it’s from Star Wars and the name was recently changed to Boba Fetts spaceship I think. The functions aren’t showed mainly because it’s an image and there are button as I’m mobile. This is the explanation for the creations.
general 2021-09-04 13:06:11 Hmm
general 2021-09-04 13:06:15 Fake or real?
general 2021-09-04 13:06:24 And why would I eat that?
general 2021-09-04 13:06:44 OH DAM
general 2021-09-04 13:06:47 Richie
general 2021-09-04 13:06:54 Rickjie I mean

general 2021-09-04 13:06:57 Pro
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:07:57 Well, any suggestions at least? I could remake it.
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:10:13 Oh no, well. I will try to remake it and post it again. I did say that it’s similar but it’s not Slave 1. I can make it green, red and the same as the spaceship, if I did intend to make it the same. It would have the same colours, same if not similar shape and the same modifications made to the spaceship.
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:13:52 I have to admit tho, the shape sure looks cursed a little.
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:16:12 I just said, a land vehicle, not the tumbler
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:18:51 No, uh, the shape is different and the colour is also different
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:21:06 I am learning a lot. But what’s a pcc?
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:23:39 Ok, well. What’s fun to make?
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:27:04 Ok, I did a helicopter creation
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:32:08 ?
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:34:56 I’m gonna take another screenshot for the tank
general 2021-09-04 13:41:46 Well, I feel bored now
general 2021-09-04 13:42:32 Who made a nuclear bomb?
general 2021-09-04 13:42:55 D:
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:44:10 Well, now I’m not sure why it’s bad.
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:47:46 I don’t remember an Abrams being nuclear powered
creations-chat 2021-09-04 13:50:25 Motor lock for tanks?
creations-chat 2021-09-04 14:00:44 Oh thanks
general 2021-09-04 19:23:23 Well, I just thought about putting a train in creations. Thanks for the idea
general 2021-09-04 20:56:30 Hey, I think I might put my Godzilla 1954 in the creations.
general 2021-09-04 20:56:54 But I’ll just be sure this time and check
general 2021-09-04 20:58:28 Just gonna ask

creations-chat 2021-09-05 02:43:11 Idk, looks cool enough I guess.
creations-chat 2021-09-05 02:46:09 Hey, could anyone give me feedback on my godzilla 1954?
creations-chat 2021-09-05 02:48:12 It’s in creations.
creations-chat 2021-09-05 02:51:00 This is my Godzilla 1954, I see my mistakes now.
creations-chat 2021-09-05 02:53:21 I mean, downvotes are usually more common. Because you will probably still get downvotes and even if it looks good in your eyes.
creations-chat 2021-09-05 02:57:37 Why is that guy in <#384025409945337856> posting someone’s build instead of his?
creations-chat 2021-09-05 02:59:39 He also posted a reference image which is against the rules.
creations-chat 2021-09-05 03:10:13 What
creations-chat 2021-09-05 03:13:31 using tutorials is frowned upon on. I’m not sure about using a part of it but it’s basically still copying.
creations-chat 2021-09-05 06:40:34 I thought Sam was ok, but yea. Low effort build.
general 2021-09-05 06:43:01 Star Wars has great space ships to copy.

general 2021-11-27 02:57:50 Oh dam, I got an idea
creations-chat 2021-11-27 10:53:09 Can anyone help give me suggestions on my ship to help it balance?
creations-chat 2021-11-27 10:56:46 It be capsizing all the time when i move forward, I tried to use helium, jet engines and propellers upwards, but none of them worked. I also tried to make a keel but it didn’t work either. I used pontoons but same thing happened.
creations-chat 2021-11-27 10:58:54 I did use helium and set to Center. I also used ballast under the whole ship to act as a hull, but made it 0.15 so that it could float, I’ll try placing it to 10
creations-chat 2021-11-27 11:47:40 It’s still capsizing even tho I put ballast to 10. Less worse now tho.
creations-chat 2021-11-27 11:50:43 It does float, it’s just that it capsizes when it moves
general 2021-11-27 12:39:18 Thanks for the help for balancing the ship
general 2021-12-01 11:52:10 My ship is still capsizing
general 2021-12-01 11:52:15 What do I do?
general 2021-12-01 11:52:30 I tried using ballast and putting the density to 10
general 2021-12-01 11:52:58 No

creations-chat 2021-12-31 10:18:33 Ah dam.
creations-chat 2021-12-31 10:20:46 Hey, I’m thinking of using the hover thruster to replace the sign text, seems to work best since the text blocks the yellow circle emoji
creations-chat 2021-12-31 10:46:17 OMG, the egg mobile improved in control when I added the extra designs
creations-chat 2021-12-31 10:58:18 I tried a wrecking ball, weight pulled it down too much and I tried adding helium. However, the wrecking ball affected the egg mobile’s movement by a lot, I’ll try working on the wrecking ball still with other methods.
creations-chat 2021-12-31 11:00:25 Won’t that ruin the texture tho?
creations-chat 2021-12-31 11:02:31 Huh, I’ll try that right now and post it once I’m done, what do you think of the egg mobile now tho?

creations-chat 2022-01-01 08:25:35 OKEH
creations-chat 2022-01-01 12:24:36 I’m sort of having a problem trying to make the egg dragoon
creations-chat 2022-01-01 12:26:46 It’s gonna be really hard considering it’s gonna have arms and legs, together with 4 extra joints, that’s gonna have a lot of controls which would really make it a little confusing for me
creations-chat 2022-01-01 16:01:41 Is it just me, or does the arm proportions seem a little off for the egg dragoon?
creations-chat 2022-01-01 16:13:10 Uh, any feedback on the proportions for my egg dragoon? The paint and shape isn’t complete so I’m open to opinions on what can be changed.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 01:34:19 Oh, you’re was talking about tutorials. You’re still kinda limited by tutorial builds considering that some tutorial builds are really mediocre or just repetitive, this could limit your imagination and number of blocks you can put on the tutorial frame work before it collapses as a whole. However, if you’re not using anyone else’s framework but you’re own, it would be easier to alter and modify your creation to be improved. And teamwork? That really sounds like an excuse for using a tutorial because you couldn’t understand physics behind something, if you think about it, it’s not really teamwork considering anyone could have done what you did, making you seem obsolete.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 01:41:56 I’m short, what I’m saying, bad excuse, more cons than pros if you’re in this discord, and also because you’re bad.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 02:02:24 Making something that far exceeds someone’s expectations is good, but no matter what you do, it’s basically still copying. Unless the changes you added outshines the tutorial itself, I don’t get why you use tutorials as your framework then.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 02:04:40 : D
I can’t wait, must be really good
creations-chat 2022-01-02 02:15:49 Not bad at all, seems better than what I expected, just change the shell, but don’t deviate too much from the plane design irl. The interior is really good too.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 06:29:26 Im working on the egg dragoon, which has one major problem currently. The problem being that the hands being at the front cause the egg dragoon to tilt forward, causing the mech to go into a nose dive or spin like sonic.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 06:31:33 Seems cool, I don’t really know what you could add since I don’t build these kinds of stuff
creations-chat 2022-01-02 06:41:28 Pls give me some ideas to fix my egg dragoon

it’s my previous text
creations-chat 2022-01-02 07:26:00 Dam, you saying number 2 and 3 made me rethink I how build stuff, thanks for the helpful advice.

Don’t mention helium blocks, I’m not using those.

creations-chat 2022-01-02 07:51:57 I always post different stuff
creations-chat 2022-01-02 07:54:33 Ye, a lot of the military vehicles
creations-chat 2022-01-02 07:58:31 Well, one cool space ship got a lot of upvotes
creations-chat 2022-01-02 08:01:08 Yea true, I only saw that when my egg mobile got way more upvotes than my previous builds, and most of my previous builds weren’t military and got a hec lot of downvotes too.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 08:04:23 Yes, very cool. Kinda boring building the same thing over and over again though. I immediately got bored of building military stuff after a few builds of them.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 08:06:28 Thomas the creepy pasta.

creations-chat 2022-01-02 10:48:28 I honestly do think my egg dragoon is incomplete, but I can’t really think of any functional improvements, so I’ll just keep it this way till something comes to mind.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 10:51:34 OH SHOOT, I REALISED MINE IS BASICALLY WIP
creations-chat 2022-01-02 11:02:20 I think the egg dragoon from sonic unleashed is harder than the egg dragoon in sonic forces, so I’ll build sonic force’s egg dragoon
creations-chat 2022-01-02 13:13:14 What can I improve on?
creations-chat 2022-01-02 13:15:23 Alright, what can replace the wing units with?

Reference is the egg dragoon

general 2022-09-02 04:22:08 I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st Street, on the 11th floor.
My name is Patrick Bateman.
I'm 27 years old.
I believe in taking care of myself, in a balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine.
In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an icepack while doing my stomach crunches.
I can do a thousand now.
After I remove the icepack, I use a deep-pore cleanser lotion.
In the shower, I use a water-activated gel cleanser.
Then a honey-almond bodyscrub.
And on the face, an exfoliating gel-scrub.
Then I apply an herb mint facial masque,
which I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine.
I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol,
because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.
Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm, followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.
There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman.
Some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me.
Only an entity-- something illusory.
And though I can hide my cold gaze...
and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours...
and maybe you can even sense our life styles are probably comparable,
I simply am not there.

general 2022-09-24 00:24:34 Plane crazy 2 is never releasing.
general 2022-09-24 00:24:40 Here’s my theory
general 2022-09-24 00:24:49 It’s gonna make a lot of sense
general 2022-09-24 00:30:14 **Rickje either lied about the studio being broken, or he just wasn’t planning for it to be released during the summer break.**

Here’s why:
Rickje has claimed that studio was broken, but he made no announcement or anything like that to explain to anyone. This is probably because of the backlash he may receive. Moreover, he claimed that he would release more sneak peaks in development once we were closer to the release date, which meant that he never actually planned to release plane crazy 2 during the summer. This makes there to be 2 possibilities. One, he only came into studio last second to release plane crazy 2, or he just needed more time to develop it.

What does this mean? The plane crazy 2 being affected by studio is most likely just a front, or lie. This is further proven when he claimed that it might have only applied to him, and not the others. This allows almost no doubt for others to even discuss this topic.
general 2022-09-24 00:30:59 What does that even mean?

general 2022-09-25 09:17:27 Morbius changed my life, I gained 200 lbs of muscle mass, but my doctor seems to keep insisting that it’s all fats, and has suggested for me to lose weight. However, I obviously know better, and have decided to keep that muscle and pummel him. Unfortunately, when I landed one of my punches, he seemingly would not go down, and my arm hurt like hell, I knew he was jealous of my muscles so he went and grabbed my stomach and waist before pummeling me bloody. I then got up and sat on him, causing him to not be able to breathe, I punched his face with my constant flurry of punches. Afterwards, I took his lifeless body and placed it into a body of water, in a bathtub, which I then used to dissolve his body with lye that I bought online. However, the police knocked on my door, asking why I bought so much, so I said that I used it for medication and then they broke in, so I morbed them all. Afterwards, I ate and cannibalised on their dead bodies which I then disposed of by using lye once again. Afterwards, I got caught.

general 2022-09-25 09:27:27 I shat in my pants once, and walked around with my underwear down, the girls saw my ding dong, everyone saw my ding dong when I walked past their classrooms and to the janitor
general 2022-09-25 09:27:46 I felt no sense of embarrassment, and felt like an alpha.

general 2022-09-25 09:29:04 1st tip when you crap yourself, get a tissue, and wipe your underwear
general 2022-09-25 09:29:24 Wear it back, and make the part where your pants may have been intact with the underwear wet
general 2022-09-25 09:29:29 Makes the spot less noticeable
general 2022-09-25 09:30:16 **If with your crush, pull down your underwear and pants, make it seem like you getting crazy.**

plane-crazy 2022-09-27 08:18:09 Ugly, absolutely atrocious
plane-crazy 2022-09-27 08:18:26 Not a perfect circle = nub
general 2022-09-30 07:57:39 I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st Street, on the 11th floor.
My name is Patrick Bateman.
I'm 27 years old.
I believe in taking care of myself, in a balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine.
In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an icepack while doing my stomach crunches.
I can do a thousand now.
After I remove the icepack, I use a deep-pore cleanser lotion.
In the shower, I use a water-activated gel cleanser.
Then a honey-almond bodyscrub.
And on the face, an exfoliating gel-scrub.
Then I apply an herb mint facial masque,
which I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine.
I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol,
because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.
Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm, followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.
There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman.
Some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me.
Only an entity-- something illusory.
And though I can hide my cold gaze...
and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours...
and maybe you can even sense our life styles are probably comparable,
I simply am not there.

general 2022-10-31 14:17:46 True
general 2022-10-31 14:20:12 Like, for a build to be “good” or even exceptional in creations, it has to be close to perfect in details. Moreover, the creation literally needs to be a good and somewhat an original concept to even be accepted. Lastly, most of the people who downvote do it as they also get downvoted in creations themselves.

general 2022-11-17 13:53:49 Rickje will never release the game
general 2022-12-15 06:50:31 Finally Rickje posted something about PC2
general 2022-12-15 06:50:47 It’s probably gonna take another year
general 2023-05-31 04:21:16 I’d want some updates on plane crazy 2 at least
general 2023-05-31 04:21:43 Yea, flightpoint barely has any players
general 2023-05-31 04:22:26 Was flightpoint made specifically to hurry up rickje on plane crazy 2?
general 2023-05-31 04:22:54 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-05-31 04:23:15 Yea, should have taken 3 years for a realistic take
general 2023-06-01 03:41:10 Cavemen attempting to do plastic surgery probs
general 2023-06-01 03:44:52 Rickje not releasing sneak peaks cuz having just 3 more would reveal the entire game’s progress, that being 20%. **(Plane crazy 2 was fake but became a plausible idea)**
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:49:39 Mesh deformation on the ocean?????
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:49:50 But it’s infiniteee
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:50:29 Yes. Every time you go close to it, you don’t die from sinking, you die from lag and FPS dropping to 0
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:51:00 Probs, or Rick wouldn’t even try
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:52:21 Wouldn’t really matter considering that the builds on plane crazy 1 that are good, will be mediocre in plane crazy 2, especially with the new tools provided
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:52:49 Biggest one seems to be scaling
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:53:23 Prob better, cuz no way it takes 3+ years for it just to look like flightpoint
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:53:57 I just want them to add space once you reach a certain height
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:54:23 Yea, wedges kills the shape up there
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:55:05 I only have one upvoted build, a friggin’ eggmobile
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:55:58 Dayuuum
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:56:20 Eh, I got lucky with the role, didn’t expect mine to get so many votes

plane-crazy 2023-06-18 03:50:27 They should have fr just announced PC 2’s development this year instead of 2 years ago
plane-crazy 2023-06-18 03:50:49 Now we’re just kept in the dark
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 05:44:16 “We wanted to re-do the previous poll because some time has passed” GURL, TIME SURE HAS PASSED, AND THE MOST RECENT THING WE GOT ARE STILL RAILS, WTH
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 05:44:55 679 said yes 3656 SAID NO, NOTHING U DO IS GONNA BRIDGE THAT GAP
plane-crazy 2023-06-20 05:48:11 GIVE US A NEW UPDATE ON DEVELOPMENT, THAT SHOWS CHALLENGE AND SKILLLLLL FOR ONCE AFTER 5 MONTHS
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 06:44:38 Saw 2 pings in plane crazy discord and thought there was a plane crazy 2 new crap, BUT IT JUST USELESS CRAP I DON’T CAAAARRREEE ABOUT
