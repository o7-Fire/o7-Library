general 2023-07-12 19:41:03 how does that motor building trick work
general 2023-07-12 19:42:18 thanks for the responsiveness yall
general 2023-07-12 19:42:22 preciate it
general 2023-07-12 19:42:44 whatcha gonna do on war thunder
general 2023-07-12 19:47:28 all thats inside the square?
general 2023-07-12 19:49:22 that whole island is being manufactured inside your hangar
general 2023-07-12 19:49:27 am i hearing this correctly?
general 2023-07-12 19:50:58 i can see now
general 2023-07-12 19:51:02 very good
general 2023-07-12 19:59:24 are ballast blocks more resistant to explosives/gunfire than others?
general 2023-07-12 20:02:21 guys i have question
general 2023-07-12 20:03:18 are ballast blocks more resistant to pvp weapons than other blocks
general 2023-07-12 20:03:21 cause of their density
general 2023-07-12 20:05:32 basedmobile
general 2023-07-12 20:07:46 i didnt say bad word!
general 2023-07-12 20:10:33 does anybody else's suicidal ideation peak when they're sleepy?
general 2023-07-12 20:11:57 theres only one barack
general 2023-07-12 20:12:54 GUYS do ballast blocks take less damage from pvp weapons or not 1!!
general 2023-07-12 20:13:31 gracias ❤️
general 2023-07-12 20:15:12 lets say hypothetically you used a motorlock mechanism to create a ballast block bundle
general 2023-07-12 20:15:22 would that bundle be considerably resistant
general 2023-07-12 20:15:28 considering all its damage is being distributed
general 2023-07-12 20:15:42 fantastic
general 2023-07-12 20:15:46 im boutta ball on these pvp noobs
general 2023-07-12 20:16:24 ok im hearing a yes and no
general 2023-07-12 20:16:29 can you explain what you mean?
general 2023-07-12 20:17:06 so in other words
ballast block explosion
general 2023-07-12 20:17:33 oh
just hide the motorlock then right?
general 2023-07-12 20:17:41 ballast blocks will be guarding it anyway
general 2023-07-12 20:18:17 ohhhh i c what you mean
general 2023-07-12 20:18:21 like, past through
general 2023-07-12 20:18:49 so, ballast blocks are penetrable, but it isnt like theyll unweld
general 2023-07-12 20:18:55 thats what im learning
general 2023-07-12 20:19:00 or, not unweld as easy
general 2023-07-12 20:19:55 just how many layers do guns need to pass through?
general 2023-07-12 20:20:14 cause i feel that can be solved no problem
general 2023-07-12 20:20:20 could be wrong tho
general 2023-07-12 20:22:13 exactly what i mean
general 2023-07-12 20:23:33 >  enough that no reasonably thick armor will work
whats this mean? armor that renders a vehicle immobile, or it doesnt matter how layered your stuff is?
general 2023-07-12 20:24:24 so the bullets will always get through. is there ANYTHING to stop bullet penetration?
general 2023-07-12 20:24:52 explosive blocks are resistant to bullet penetration?
general 2023-07-12 20:25:08 how resistant
general 2023-07-12 20:25:15 like, textbook, or, it can save your ass a few times?
general 2023-07-12 20:25:51 awesome
general 2023-07-12 20:26:24 other than that though, ballast blocks are less prone to unwelding correct?
general 2023-07-13 04:18:06 how do i make those turrets that follow where your mouse points
general 2023-07-13 04:19:46 thx

plane-crazy 2023-07-17 23:24:32 i wonder how plane crazy rates builds
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 23:24:40 cause like i saw the flying dutchman one
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 23:24:46 and i liked it
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 23:24:51 but it was downvoted to shit
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 23:25:18 like what exactly are they looking for
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 23:35:04 ig thats my problem then
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 23:35:12 cause im looking for *interesting* builds
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 23:42:58 <@612591637427650589>
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 23:49:42 why do people rig their vehicles with cameras
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 23:50:13 like this individual for example
general 2023-07-18 00:20:17 lol
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 19:10:57 what do ballast tanks do
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 19:16:55 so like for subs and shit
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 19:17:46 are ballast blocks more durable in pvp combat?
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 19:18:16 i see
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 19:18:20 sole purpose is weight displacement
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 19:18:31 what about helium blocks, what do they do?
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 19:18:54 without the need for propellers?
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 19:20:09 moon?
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 19:20:18 you can go to the moon in this game?
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 19:20:31 o
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 19:20:34 just replicas
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 19:26:13 i farted

plane-crazy 2023-07-19 02:41:40 golf
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 03:02:16 how do i access the gravity slider?
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 03:02:31 alrighty
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 05:00:33 whats free length and damping mean
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 05:00:38 for suspension
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 05:07:45 
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 05:19:11 plane crazy keeps crashing for me
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 05:20:02 it might be because i made a plane that can travel into the floating point limits of roblox
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 05:20:13 but i dont know if that necessarily causes crashes
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 05:20:16 it might
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 05:22:52 did they remove the thing that shows the center of mass!??
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 05:22:53 why??
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 15:49:14 i am SO glad they added the center of mass thing back
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 15:49:23 why would they EVER remove it
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 15:54:58 aaaaand it's gone.
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 15:55:06 it just disappears while youre working on it sometimes
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 15:55:13 well
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 15:55:17 i mean once it disappears
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 15:55:20 its gone for good
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 16:02:17 dont say that
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 16:02:24 im not ready to yet
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 16:04:16 also, does that cutter-blacklist tactic still work?
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 16:11:00 whats the highest stable speed youve ever gotten with your vehicles?
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 16:27:11 when is ricke gonna introduce logic gates to the game tho :v
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 16:58:51 how do you make those planes that are able to stop in midair?
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 17:02:32 p much yeah
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 17:02:35 and i mean jets
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 17:02:39 not "planes"
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 17:03:27 yeah, but like how it would work in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 17:04:58 <:nails:1098115968137445478>
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 17:06:21 in a way that would amount to the speed being 0?
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 17:07:12 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfqIipATl8g 13:50 -13:55
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 17:07:16 this is what made me ask
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 17:13:02 what about the other settings
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 17:17:10 whats the difference between a control surface and a *delta* control surface
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 17:17:59 thx
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 17:20:36 it happens if you hit the bottom while testing your vehicle then click the "revert" arrow button
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 17:20:40 ui is lost after that
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 17:20:56 also to make sure not to die while youre testing because the center of mass thing will be gone after
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 17:21:14 not hitting revert just means you get to keep the ui after
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 17:21:22 i was explaining whats going on
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 17:21:38 how to NOT repeat the error
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 18:04:39 kill shredders behead shredders roundhouse kick a shredder into the concrete slam dunk a shredder into the trash can crucify filthy shredders defecate in a shredders food launch shredders into the sun stir fry shredders in a wok toss shredders into active volcanoes judo throw shredders into a woodchipper twist shredders heads off report shredders to the IRS karate chop shredders in half trap shredders in quicksand crush shredders in the trash compactor liquify shredders in a vat of acid eat shredders dissect shredders drown shredders exterminate shredders in the gas chamber stomp shredder skulls with steel toed boots cremate shredders in the oven lobotomize shredders mandatory abortions for shredders grind shredder fetuses in the garbage disposal vaporize shredders with a ray gun kick shredders down the stairs feed shredders to alligators slice shredders with a katana
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 18:04:48 my endless gaping maw hungers for Total Shredder Death
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 18:09:21 motor 2s are for making alternative control panels right?
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 18:09:27 how do i get them to turn with my mouse?
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 18:09:31 wait
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 18:09:34 nvm hold on
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 18:09:46 yeah nvm
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 18:10:06 thought i could copypaste the controls from the control panels onto the servo
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 19:01:58 do materials have any effect on a conveyor drive's efficacy?
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 23:27:59 what does stiffness on suspension do?
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 23:33:18 how does it differ from damping
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 23:35:37 what about for conveyor engines :v
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 23:35:54 conveyor engines
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 23:35:55 cause like
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 23:35:57 for them
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 23:36:02 you need damping to be at 0
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 23:38:41 "weird" as in cheap or "weird" as in confusing
plane-crazy 2023-07-19 23:42:12 robox keeps crashing :< !11
