"[4] All blocks must be attached to the creation."
In its rules.

plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:03:42 And i want this to be stuck on a huey and work.

Any opinions about my Semi Rigid Rotor?
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:25:10 A Semi Rigid Rotor is a type of helicopter Rotor.
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:25:52 This is the Semi Rigid Rotor of a B206
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:34:05 Anyone got an opinion?
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:36:04 It's an opinion that's not really relevant.
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:37:03 I feel like looking at an elder god so that im insane enough to continue working on that abomination.
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:38:43 those propellers exist to just knock it over.
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:38:50 I want it to *self stabilize as well.*
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 23:38:59 Which is something that's probably *incredibly god damn impossible.*

plane-crazy 2020-07-07 16:05:09 No, a dystopian society is one which has its people have no rights to their core. But a Post apocalyptic world is anarchic.

creations-chat 2020-07-29 02:17:31 A mix of yaw, pitch, and roll, allows you to turn so quickly.
general 2020-07-31 11:16:45 Note that the B-50 ***IS*** is just the B-29, except revised for the Post World War 2 Age.
general 2020-07-31 11:18:04 "The Boeing B-50 Superfortress is an American strategic bomber. A post–World War II revision of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, it was fitted with more powerful Pratt & Whitney R-4360 radial engines, stronger structure, a taller tail fin, and other improvements."
general 2020-07-31 11:18:27 It ***is literally a Post WW2 revision of the B29 bomber***.
general 2020-07-31 11:20:24 What about realistically sized B-29s?

general 2020-07-31 11:25:59 (And i say add another unpowered motor, that's unpowered, onto the wheel, and also add an unpowered one in the gear mechanism itself.)
general 2020-07-31 11:26:34 Basically, add more motor, in order to make motor unfuck itself back into existence.
general 2020-07-31 21:01:10 I need help
general 2020-07-31 21:01:33 I know

general 2020-07-31 23:04:34 If you use a shredder/thumperhead/snake/swarm, you're shit.
general 2020-07-31 23:04:52 You're a piece of poo that noone wants to be with.
general 2020-07-31 23:04:59 If you use any of those 4.
general 2020-07-31 23:07:04 Imagine that but a Shredder Snake with that hammerhead made of cutters instead of shark.
general 2020-07-31 23:07:58 Ello
general 2020-07-31 23:08:20 That's a shark
general 2020-07-31 23:08:35 The Americans trained dolphins, not sharks.
general 2020-07-31 23:09:26 A Sharp Sword instead of flesh.
general 2020-07-31 23:09:28 Dear god.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 02:39:20 A Seaplane is just a plane that can land and launch from *w a t e r.*
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 02:40:35 Carrier Planes
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 02:40:42 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_and_recovery_cycle
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 02:41:02 ***But they can land on water, can they not?***
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 02:41:45 Left
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 02:42:14 Also, my carrier is a *Seaplane Tender*, which is a type of carrier.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 02:42:41 Yea
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 02:42:52 The Seaplane Tender *can also launch Seaplanes, using a catapult.*
general 2020-08-02 03:02:03 I honest to god need help
general 2020-08-02 03:02:26 May someone please tell me how to make my roblox client not completely white.
general 2020-08-02 03:02:30 I just want to play Plane crazy.
general 2020-08-02 03:02:57 I've played roblox something like 20 times in the last 48 hours.
general 2020-08-02 03:03:08 All of them had the client be a beautiful, pure, white.
general 2020-08-02 03:03:35 I require assistence.
general 2020-08-02 03:04:00 Either It's factory reset my computer for a second time, or wait till school starts to get a reply from Roblox Support.
general 2020-08-02 03:05:12 Does anyone here know how to fix a Client that only shows White.
general 2020-08-02 03:05:24 If Submarine commander is impossible, i got that.
general 2020-08-02 03:05:58 Please
general 2020-08-02 03:06:10 I just want to play Plane crazy
general 2020-08-02 03:06:20 And not be *excited for school*.
general 2020-08-02 03:06:40 This is the first time I've been excited for something i despise.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:07:44 May someone help me in fixing my roblox client, so i can play Plane Crazy?
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:07:53 Since my Screen is just *white*.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:08:15 
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:08:33 Please, I'm bored, and I'm getting excited for school because of that.
general 2020-08-02 03:10:13 Does anyone have an intellect of over 200, and are able to assist me in getting the roblox client to render the game, instead of giving me a ***white screen.***
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:10:25 I've done that
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:10:29 3, times.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:10:45 And I'm not going to factory reset for the second time this year.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:11:22 Done that, something like 5 times now.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:11:42 > I thinj you should contact with developers but devs doesn't gives any fuck sadly
If they don't, then i quesiton why the FUCK they work on roblox still.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:12:32 I'm talking if they don't give a fuck about a technical issue, not a "Hurr durr, i got me account hacked, plz help."
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:13:03 Lemme check over my driver software again.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:14:14 A very not plausible answer to this is that Roblox is *now* being an Ass to my NVIDIA Driver, or my NVIDIA Driver is failing to work.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:14:29 Hopefully it's the former, and not at all the latter.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:16:20 > <@!259742168661360641> my nvidia Driver does the same thing
Failing to work, or Roblox being an Ass.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:16:41 If it's the former, then fuck, i can't afford to buy another laptop, or a desktop.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:16:47 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:16:52 I'm not talking Crashing.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:16:59 I'm talking the game not rendering
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:17:10 I can hear, and probably even input stuff.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:17:25 I've redownloaded roblox something like 5 times, or 4, idk at this point.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:18:47 Another common outcome has happened, Black and Sky.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:19:38 There's no new update to my Nvidia driver.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:19:50 And there's not ever gonna be new updates to my Intel Drivers.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:20:21 Yes, i have
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:20:59 1 Old Broken Game, 1 Old game, 1 New game, 1 New and upcoming game, all white screen or black and sky.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:21:13 f9 does nothing, only white.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:21:29 
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:21:34 I can hear sound.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:21:43 I bet i can also type out stuff.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:21:59 Lemme do that real quick then.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:22:40 Oh wait
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:23:03 I now just remember that when i try to load up a studio thing, it isn't able to load up anything, and studio essentially softlocks itself.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:23:05 Also, yes,
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:23:09 All of my other games work.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:23:18 From The Depths shits its pants though.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:23:49 Welp
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:24:10 Already sent a ticket about a day ago.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:24:35 Roblox Studio goes into perpetual loading.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:24:56 Oh boy, Safe Mode Time.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:25:05 Lemme just search up how to get into that.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:25:10 Also, Yes, all of them are vibing.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:25:16 They're doing well
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:25:29 And MalwareBytes has been vibe checking the nonvibing files.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:25:51 Win 8
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:27:30 When i factory resetted to where i am now, my dad gave me a USB with the factory settings and stuff that this laptop I'm on currently had included.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:27:44 And I *just fucking want my HP Omen Control.*
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:28:06 I don't want an Edgy Red for my Laptop Keyboard, and I don't want to leave it behind.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:28:41 Ah, i don't use the weird ass metro mode thing.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:28:49 It's ugly as shit.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:28:59 And generally a piece of doo doo to deal with.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:29:13 Lemme show you what i mean
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:29:45 And how do i run compatability mode through the play button on the website?
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:29:57 Or do i set compatability mode on the .exe in the file in appdata?
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:30:35 
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:30:36 This metro
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:31:09 Microsoft makes *tablets?*
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:31:20 Yea
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:31:33 And this is getting to a point that it isn't about getting roblox plane crazy to work.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:31:49 Top, qued.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:31:56 Also, speak in <#478584971670454284>, probably.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:33:07 Also, i might be on 8.1.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:33:17 And don't know the difference between win 8 and win 8.1
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:33:33 Anyone want me to run compatability mode on Win 95?
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:35:04 Wot
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:35:10 This is roblox, not roblox studios.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:35:16 Also, jesus christ
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:35:20 That's a load of motors.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:36:25 Also, setting compatibility mode to Win 7 did nothing.
plane-crazy 2020-08-02 03:36:39 On both roblox launcher exe, and roblox beta exe.
general 2020-08-02 03:40:27 I'm going back here
general 2020-08-02 03:40:31 Could someone help me?
general 2020-08-02 03:40:44 I didn't find jesus
general 2020-08-02 03:40:46 I found nothingh
general 2020-08-02 03:40:58 Hell, doing anything, does nothing.
general 2020-08-02 03:41:01 It's only now sky
general 2020-08-02 03:41:08 Please, help me.
general 2020-08-02 03:44:06 I'm gonna just sleep
general 2020-08-02 03:44:21 Since my last resort for not becoming excited for school is broken.
general 2020-08-02 03:44:44 Lemme say one thing
general 2020-08-02 03:45:12 Everything on https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203312790-Graphics-Problems-on-Computers is wrong in my situation.
general 2020-08-02 03:45:52 Not told "A "graphics card is too old" error appears when trying to launch games"
Doesn't crash "Roblox crashes during game play and reports a graphics error"
Not receiving anything "Receiving Message: “Graphics failed to initialize”"
And nothing to look at "All games look unusual while playing, such as strange looking textures, image warping or unintelligible text"
general 2020-08-02 03:46:20 When has this become <#495286269459300364>
general 2020-08-05 18:35:35 do you need something in order to reply to a post on r/roblox?
general 2020-08-05 18:35:44 Because I'm trying to do exactly that.
general 2020-08-05 18:39:39 Anyone know a place that i can speak in that has people who can help me with my "roblox client being white" issue.
general 2020-08-05 18:40:13 It's still white.
general 2020-08-05 18:40:33 It's responding
general 2020-08-05 18:40:39 Hell, I can interact with the game.
general 2020-08-05 18:40:44 I can *hear* the game.
general 2020-08-05 18:42:37 Reddit is just perpetually "sending" the reply.
general 2020-08-05 18:43:45 yost
general 2020-08-05 18:43:52 I've reinstalled roblox about 8 times.
general 2020-08-05 18:44:10 I've allowed it through my firewall and allowed it to connect to the internet with malwarebytes.
general 2020-08-05 18:44:19 I've turned off my adblock extensions.
general 2020-08-05 18:44:24 I've updated my drivers.
general 2020-08-05 18:44:38 I've deleted the Roblox folder in the Appdata directory about 3 times.
general 2020-08-05 18:44:55 And the thing is, Roblox *used* to work on my laptop.
general 2020-08-05 18:45:12 Also, I have enough Ram for Roblox.
general 2020-08-05 18:45:24 Hell, Plane crazy was running at 60 FPS on the highest graphics.
general 2020-08-05 18:46:51 yosti
general 2020-08-05 18:46:58 nvm.
general 2020-08-05 18:47:05 I don't want to factory reset, at all.
general 2020-08-05 18:47:21 All of my steam games work.
general 2020-08-05 18:48:34 I've restarted so many times.
general 2020-08-05 18:48:42 And i don't want to resort to-
general 2020-08-05 18:48:45 Yosti
general 2020-08-05 18:49:01 I have a B29, I can't build a realistically sized B29 on mobile.
general 2020-08-05 18:49:15 Aight, confusion here
general 2020-08-05 18:49:30 Yes, ifucking have discord on my android.
general 2020-08-05 18:49:43 No, I'm on my laptop currently
general 2020-08-05 18:50:09 Time to get task manager and yeet everything out of existence.
general 2020-08-05 18:50:29 And probably break my computer or something in the process, since i don't know what's essential.
general 2020-08-05 18:51:28 > get a better pc noob
I have a fucking omen laptop that can run plane crazy at max graphics at 60 fps.
general 2020-08-05 18:51:31 Also, aight
general 2020-08-05 18:57:03 Roblox still white
general 2020-08-05 18:57:15 
general 2020-08-05 18:58:12 I might consider going on 4chan to get this fucking issue solved.
general 2020-08-05 19:06:53 senko =/= monke
general 2020-08-05 19:07:36 I'm going to assume you say that a person with a prosthetic arm is a robot then.
general 2020-08-05 19:08:10 Since Senko is basically just a blessed human with fox tail and ears.
plane-crazy 2020-08-05 20:39:37 Ho- How do you "even it out"?
general 2020-08-10 01:11:03 I think i witnessed someone giving a gun to someone who's going to attempt murder.
general 2020-08-10 01:11:12 Or going to plan to try to give a gun.
general 2020-08-10 01:11:32 If I'm correct, that's two crimes.
general 2020-08-10 01:12:36 Lemme check my bookmarks again.
general 2020-08-10 01:13:22 lemme use that site real quick
general 2020-08-10 01:14:39 Also, i love the fact that I haven't bookmarked a website which had every, single, law, in a single pdf.
general 2020-08-10 01:15:21 lmao
general 2020-08-10 01:15:48 Yes, every american law.
general 2020-08-10 01:16:06 myeh
general 2020-08-10 01:16:13 also, going back a bit
general 2020-08-10 01:16:21 and trying to reword what i said
general 2020-08-10 01:17:23 I also love the fact that I've bookmarked a website which allows you to download a pdf of a study which essentially went through all this aerodynamics testing to basically say, "Big Boobs are better because they're more aerodynamic than flatties."
general 2020-08-10 01:17:47 https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Comparison-of-wake-velocity-magnitudes-at-5-z-locations-centered-along-x-0-and-ranging_fig1_322530755
general 2020-08-10 01:18:14 The lad who made that paper actually used legitimate stuff to prove that big boob better.
general 2020-08-10 01:18:27 I'm being serious
general 2020-08-10 01:19:03 Big Bodonkadoos are surprisingly more aerodynamic than a flat chest.
general 2020-08-10 01:19:45 <@456226577798135808>
general 2020-08-10 01:21:02 sadly, i can't post the pdf here, because It's 11 MB large.

general 2020-08-10 21:45:53 Like, Plane crazy's just *white*, as in the screen's white, making the game unplayable.
general 2020-08-10 21:46:00 And every other game on roblox is also white.
general 2020-08-10 21:46:07 I can hear noises, I can even *walk*.
general 2020-08-10 21:46:34 Anyone have any good recommendations as to what to do?

general 2020-08-10 21:49:20 "Unwelcome stimulation for their insemination"
general 2020-08-10 21:49:29 "Incarceration's our only destination"

general 2020-08-10 22:07:27 How can you read the article on reading if you don't know how to read?
general 2020-08-10 22:07:54 i just realized that you need to know how to read to learn how to read.
general 2020-08-10 22:09:34 That Chernobyl reactor one sucks
general 2020-08-10 22:09:49 The airship is decent, and the rig Is pretty good, but not best.
general 2020-08-10 22:11:23 > yeah true
If you even agree that you're bad, why are you criticizing things in HOF?
general 2020-08-10 22:12:24 <@!178298325806743552>, that'd make FAR shit its fancy trousers.

general 2020-08-10 22:17:02 Yea, that's normal
general 2020-08-10 22:17:36 What the fuck do you mean then?
general 2020-08-10 22:17:52 You click "play" on a game, and then that runs the roblox client, which runs the game you just pressed play for.
general 2020-08-10 22:18:47 I have no clue what you mean by "browser discord"

plane-crazy 2020-09-16 21:38:28 Yea, I can't make them smaller, or the wheels wouldn't work.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 21:38:40 Also, I physically cannot shrink down the motors further, that's impossible.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 21:47:20 "I'm trying to make it flat and in line with the bottom."
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 21:47:49 Yep.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 21:47:59 I'm getting help from a lad in a group I'm in.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 21:56:01 I use them already, and I can't shrink the wheel further, or the wheel won't even spin.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 22:04:42 Tip, build the bay *around* the bombs.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 22:05:02 Don't forget that you gotta be inline as well, aka not having the bay bulge out.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 22:31:08 Anyone had an asshole call your plane a tutorial?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 22:31:20 And keep insisting that it was a tutorial, even after arguing with them.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 22:31:59 I've had my A17, Martin Maryland, and Carrier deck, be called a tutorial.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 22:32:13 I have no clue how they would've thought that.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 22:32:51 Because no tutorial would do an obscure attack aircraft (or any attack aircraft, other than the A-10 or the Stuka,) an obscure Light Bomber, and the CV-1.
help 2020-09-16 22:33:48 Well, if you forgot how to exist, then you are luckier than all of us.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 22:35:15 I'm also not gonna wonder who'd ever make a tutorial of the Akagi.

creations-chat 2020-09-17 09:51:27 <@456226577798135808> I got an English Electric Canberra, which is what the B57 is based off of.
creations-chat 2020-09-17 10:11:53 I'd suggest making the propeller unpowered, so that you can make it look like there's variable thrust when you throttle your actual thrusters.
general 2020-09-17 10:17:56 I've finally had a scam ad which literally had me say, "That is not how it works."
general 2020-09-17 10:18:27 It talked about some "silicon valley" technology that somehow made solar panels "soak up more energy".
general 2020-09-17 10:19:31 Photovoltaic Panels basically do that.
general 2020-09-17 10:20:40 But the video is saying that by using these *external electronics*, you can *soak more sunlight/electricity from your panels*.
general 2020-09-17 10:24:11 I just don't fucking understand how the hell solar panels work.
general 2020-09-17 10:24:52 But the advertisement was just screeching stupidity to the point that it was just incredibly obvious that it's not how it's done.
general 2020-09-17 10:26:25 Which, I'll just say what I mean again.
The advertisement was talking about a red box, which you could hook up to your panels, to get more power from the panels.
general 2020-09-17 10:28:00 Time to scan with malware bytes again.

creations-chat 2020-09-19 04:32:59 
creations-chat 2020-09-19 04:33:16 I've recently gotten into using motors for those types of wings, and also motorlocking.
creations-chat 2020-09-19 04:33:55 I've actually been using motorlocking for a load of aircraft, including making planes that have an even width (4.)
creations-chat 2020-09-19 04:34:22 I'd suggest getting a motor lock with the turret motor, bori.

(And i did rip that off of wikipedia, the article on "Unguided bomb" to be exact.)

general 2021-01-03 12:26:36 No, it doesn't.
general 2021-01-03 12:27:01 Freedom of Speech allows you to say anything, people may argue about it, but you cannot get rid of it.

bug-reports 2021-01-04 21:44:49 I definitely don't get usage of Motor 2's for arms.
bug-reports 2021-01-04 21:45:28 Angling, that's one of the only reasons I use Motor 2's.
But using it to turn an arm? *No*.
bug-reports 2021-01-04 21:46:02 Get a Motor 1, crank the torque up, and get a keypad.
general 2021-01-04 21:50:01 Ah, yes, go 11.264 Trillion studs per second.
general 2021-01-04 21:51:13 Pshh, go Infinity
general 2021-01-04 21:52:01 love how you said it in a way like "Ok, lemme take out the trash."
general 2021-01-04 21:52:29 *Since it is possible to go infinity*.
general 2021-01-04 21:53:19 Infinity+1
general 2021-01-04 21:53:22 or
general 2021-01-04 21:53:28 Infinity^2
general 2021-01-04 21:53:50 *Square infinity for me*
general 2021-01-04 21:54:11 Note that e means *exponent*.
general 2021-01-04 21:55:28 69*10^69 means 69000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

general 2021-01-04 21:57:24 Frenchie, my pfp wasn't made by a person.

general 2021-01-04 22:02:16 You're basically screaming at a child for not learning correctly.

general 2021-01-04 22:05:47 What's better is that an AI made this.

general 2021-01-04 22:11:40 Erecting a Dispenser is not inappropriate, especially in the situation that it's said.
general 2021-01-04 22:12:28 Saying erect *is* suggestive in some way, but that's only while alone or compiled with other suggestive words.
general 2021-01-04 22:12:41 hehe
general 2021-01-04 22:13:30 Indeed, and with the context given, you cannot simply assume it's inappropriate.
general 2021-01-04 22:13:54 Grumble grumble
general 2021-01-04 22:14:05 anyways
general 2021-01-04 22:15:24 I'm sorry that your mind is dirty, dingus.
general 2021-01-04 22:16:12 Well, I might've just had a brain fart.

general 2021-01-04 22:16:53 I understand no and yes.
general 2021-01-04 22:17:05 And I have a vague idea that mein gott means my god.
general 2021-01-04 22:17:48 Well, I really don't want to be wrong when saying things in a different language.
help 2021-01-04 23:04:51 You'll run into the same issue that happened in testing.
help 2021-01-04 23:05:04 You have to keep moving or the thing will fall out of the sky.
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 01:20:08 Hover means to stay at an altitude.
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 01:20:59 Well, of course you're going to get some drift, but Hovering should mean you have no movement up or down, so that you won't move up or down.
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 01:43:00 I don't think so.
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 01:43:49 Note, by Hover and the allowing of drift, I don't mean a constant regular movement forward, It should be kinda stationary.
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 01:44:20 (IE, you don't see a Blackhawk dropping troops and it drifting to the right by 5 meters per second.)

general 2021-01-08 04:24:30 I'm bored, I need sleep, and I have homework to do.
general 2021-01-08 04:25:35 Paradox time.
general 2021-01-08 04:26:09 If the set contained everything, then it would, indeed, contain itself.
general 2021-01-08 04:26:50 Then everything *has everything*.
general 2021-01-08 04:27:05 You could say that there's an infinite amount of everything.

general 2021-01-08 11:31:01 Did someone say, ***ATHEIST??!!?!?!***
general 2021-01-08 11:31:13 Anyways, hi, atheist here with ***shamwow***.
general 2021-01-08 11:32:55 The holy bible's just an incredibly old fictional book with a fanclub which obsesses over it too much.
general 2021-01-27 01:56:43 Bored, might as well post the fact that I made a B-36 in KSP.

general 2021-02-05 21:12:49 Oh
general 2021-02-05 21:12:52 Thanks LeadSniffer
general 2021-02-05 21:14:06 Lemme check the name of it.
general 2021-02-05 21:14:16 Uses some kinda aerodynamics effect to float above the water.
general 2021-02-05 21:14:58 Yes, I know.
general 2021-02-05 21:15:06 But what I'm talking about is the Ground Effect.
general 2021-02-05 21:15:29 And the picture shown was an ekranoplan.
general 2021-02-05 21:15:38 dis
general 2021-02-05 21:16:17 Yes, allowing for an incredibly fast aircraft to fly over the water at high speeds.
general 2021-02-05 21:16:37 The issue is that it doesn't fly high enough, any wave above a meter fricks with the ekranoplan.
general 2021-02-05 21:17:13 Well, you can't go fast enough to fly above oceanic waves without probably going supersonic.
general 2021-02-05 21:17:37 Besides, you'd probably leave the effect when going that high.

help 2021-03-26 07:12:21 Could someone give me a decent bomb design?
help 2021-03-26 07:13:24 Not one of those disgustingly overpowered ~~motorlock abomination~~ cluster bombs.
help 2021-03-26 07:16:31 I have reasonable limits now, because I do understand how useful they are.
help 2021-03-26 07:16:47 The issue is that I'm not gonna use several hundred motors just for an overpowered abomination.
help 2021-03-26 07:17:27 I'm already sacrificing some beauty just so I can safely shove a bunch of fins and crap on.
help 2021-03-26 07:20:38 Right now, my bomb design is inaccurate, It goes way off a target.
help 2021-03-26 07:21:25 Either way, a bomb without fins won't be hitting the target unless you're dive bombing yourself with the bomb into a target.
help 2021-03-26 07:21:33 So is there like, a really good fin design?
help 2021-03-26 07:22:02 nam, I've hit my targets before.
help 2021-03-26 07:22:42 But because PC physics isn't IRL physics, the bomb right now doesn't drag and slow down so It's effectively going to fall in a disgustingly bumpy arc.
help 2021-03-26 07:23:01 And It's either fins, or disgusting parachute bombs.
help 2021-03-26 07:23:32 Wot?
help 2021-03-26 07:23:51 The only things I've called disgusting is horrifying motorlock abuse, and parachute bombs.
help 2021-03-26 07:25:32 You understand why every dumb bomb has fins?
help 2021-03-26 07:26:19 It's called stabilization.
help 2021-03-26 07:26:39 Yea, and why are you getting angry about it then?
help 2021-03-26 07:27:39 I'll just ask another discord, cuz I'm only gettin insulted over here.
help 2021-03-26 07:28:25 Yea, about superstraight.
