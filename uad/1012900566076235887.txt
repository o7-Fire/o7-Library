general 2022-11-23 04:20:12 Maybe
general 2022-11-23 23:59:57 Would you consider yourself a child or very childish Playing plane crazy?
general 2022-11-25 18:54:47 I miss plane crazy
general 2022-11-25 18:55:26 Would you consider it childish to play plane crazy?
general 2022-11-25 18:56:39 i left roblox last week i felt like a kid even though i'm 13
general 2022-11-25 18:57:03 I would return just because of plane crazy I left unfinished things that I would have liked to do
general 2022-11-26 03:36:26 It is a violation if you modify the logo of the strategic command
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 23:02:51 My plane is going down
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 23:02:59 In that area
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 23:05:58 In plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 23:06:41 It would look blocky if I use half blocks

creations-chat 2022-12-02 23:46:49 No
creations-chat 2022-12-03 01:40:35 Very big?
creations-chat 2022-12-03 01:43:11 One question. If they presented the B 21 today, why are there no images?
general 2022-12-03 01:44:51 According to the B 21 presented today but I can't find images
general 2022-12-03 01:44:57 Oh
general 2022-12-03 01:45:22 Although I wonder why the b2 is the most powerful and has never been tested
general 2022-12-03 01:45:32 Not against a worthy rival
general 2022-12-03 01:46:11 Radars?
general 2022-12-03 01:46:38 Descending radars as it is designed to enter without being detected, no plane is invisible but the furtive does exist
general 2022-12-03 01:48:04 The f 22 has not been tested either
general 2022-12-03 01:48:36 I would like to see a confrontation between an f 22 and a worthy rival
general 2022-12-03 01:48:54 Without the pilots dying
general 2022-12-03 01:49:08 I don't want deaths I just want to see who is the best here
general 2022-12-03 01:49:56 What does the B 21 have new with respect to the b2?
general 2022-12-03 01:50:51 The Russians make small modifications to a plane and change its name
general 2022-12-03 01:51:59 They even changed the air intakes to the f 15 and they didn't change their name, they just put F15E
general 2022-12-03 01:53:08 The only ones that are different are the su 34 27 29 But they have the same air intakes also the su 57 has a big difference
general 2022-12-03 01:54:23 In my region we have many who hate Americans for no reason.
general 2022-12-03 01:54:59 I say this mainly because of a channel that hates the F 35 a lot. It got to the point of giving reasons why it was a failure
general 2022-12-03 01:55:22 It also ensures that the F 35 falls with a bird and with a stone
general 2022-12-03 01:55:37 And that when shooting it falls
general 2022-12-03 01:56:16 There is no fault of the F 35 Don't miss it
general 2022-12-03 01:56:49 it's pro russian
general 2022-12-03 01:57:52 In fact, he did not upload a video of the presentation of the B 21
general 2022-12-03 01:58:59 F-35 COLLAPSES WHILE TOWING INCREDIBLE FAILURE
general 2022-12-03 01:59:43 - Children, this is the F-35, the most powerful aircraft in the world.
- It's very nice, sir!
- But don't touch it, child, YOU BREAK IT!!!
general 2022-12-03 01:59:54 That put a subscriber of him
general 2022-12-03 02:00:50 The best combat fighters are those inherited from the Soviet Union and Russia üá∑üá∫
general 2022-12-03 02:00:53 -Pro russian
general 2022-12-03 02:01:30 The US DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ITS 9 BILLION DOLLAR DESTROYERS
general 2022-12-03 02:02:17 NATO RUNS OUT OF WEAPONS TO SEND TO UKRAINE üî¥ THE ALLIANCE IS TIRED OF ZELENSKI
general 2022-12-03 02:02:45 RUSSIAN SUKHOI 35 FIGHTERS INTERCEPT A US F-22 RAPTOR
general 2022-12-03 02:03:49 The SU 35 is much better than Raptor and than any western house, Obama suffered a great disappointment because none of his Raptors could outwit the Russian anti-aircraft systems, they were all detected from a distance that they never imagined possible, but the most embarrassing thing was this episode when this Raptor was locked and could never evade the formidable fighter Rus
general 2022-12-03 02:03:53 - Pro russian
general 2022-12-03 02:05:51 Does the f 5 have a chance against a fighter today
general 2022-12-03 02:06:46 My country has 3 and wants to repair 4
general 2022-12-03 02:06:58 And you think you can hold your own with them
general 2022-12-03 02:07:18 What I've been seeing is that those planes always fly without missiles.
general 2022-12-03 02:09:13 The army of my country uses the T 6 as its main aircraft
general 2022-12-03 02:09:18 üíÄ
general 2022-12-03 02:09:38 Yes
general 2022-12-03 02:09:55 14 T 6
general 2022-12-03 02:10:07 As major navy aircraft
general 2022-12-03 02:11:19 Although I do wonder why the f 35 fails more than many known fighters
general 2022-12-03 02:11:52 I'm not pro-Russian, I support the West more, but
general 2022-12-03 02:12:21 What mistake could the pilot have made when an f 35 fell off an aircraft carrier?
general 2022-12-03 02:12:51 Today?
general 2022-12-03 02:13:24 So the USAF does not train its pilots well or the fighter is complex
general 2022-12-03 02:14:27 Is it true of the theory that the f 35 is damaged when flying at high speeds?
general 2022-12-03 02:15:14 idk
general 2022-12-03 02:15:24 They only ensure that
general 2022-12-03 02:15:42 And that the f 35 is not a fifth generation fighter
general 2022-12-03 02:15:54 But it's a flying computer
general 2022-12-03 02:17:08 The su 35 is an improved su 27 and they already believe it is a fifth generation fighter
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 02:48:00 Allison  T 56
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 02:48:21 Wait
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 02:48:45 I see it very big
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 02:48:59 I think I'll have to make it shorter
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 02:50:47 
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 02:53:09 Its disadvantage is that it needs 8x8
general 2022-12-04 17:59:31 Does the fuselage of the F 4 go up or is it the infrared device
general 2022-12-04 17:59:52 I don't understand
general 2022-12-04 18:00:31 Haven't you seen the nose of the F 4?
general 2022-12-04 18:00:39 I see that
general 2022-12-04 18:01:06 Until what investigates the device that brings under the nose is infra red
general 2022-12-04 18:01:34 What's under the nose of the f 4
general 2022-12-04 18:02:49 secure?
general 2022-12-04 18:03:01 there are images where it comes out as a radome
general 2022-12-04 18:03:34 some have a radome and others the cannon
general 2022-12-04 18:04:38 And where is the radome located?
general 2022-12-04 18:04:54 What's under the nose
general 2022-12-04 18:05:58 weird because what you say is a canyon is closed
general 2022-12-04 18:06:21 <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 18:06:45 gun?
general 2022-12-04 18:07:00 I put a picture on that channel
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 18:08:10 I just saw that it can also have a cannon in the nose
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 18:08:22 but in this case it has that strange radome
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 18:08:48 
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 18:09:49 Could I do it with a flare?
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 18:10:51 fireworks i think
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 18:11:25 
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 18:11:27 the one in the middle
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 18:11:41 could i use it to do that?
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 18:11:54 I did not remember
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 18:12:06 But could I use it to make the cannon?
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 18:12:21 it would look good
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 18:19:56 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 18:20:13 What about that
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 18:20:43 How does that look?
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 18:21:02 is the canyon
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 18:23:00 trying to fix the problem with the block
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 18:23:42 I think it's the size of the original
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 18:24:03 reaches the middle of the nose
general 2022-12-07 22:48:00 I'm working on the su 27 But one thing I don't know if leaving the air intake empty
general 2022-12-07 22:48:06 what do you think
general 2022-12-07 22:48:30 I put a block to make it look dark?
general 2022-12-07 23:02:49 Are the su 27 engines in the same position as the air intakes?
general 2022-12-07 23:03:31 But they are attached to the air intakes right?
general 2022-12-07 23:03:53 It is right?
general 2022-12-07 23:04:09 already did
general 2022-12-07 23:04:28 So the engines are glued to the air intakes and are at the same angle
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 22:09:25 How can I make the whindshield stay at the same angle as the wedge?
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 22:09:35 It is not exact
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 22:41:38 The phantom nose is 1x1 or 1x2
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 01:45:04 
creations-chat 2022-12-10 01:49:40 I will continue with that prototype
creations-chat 2022-12-10 01:51:50 It is the result of months of research and several prototypes, I could redo it, but I am also interested in the result of this one.
