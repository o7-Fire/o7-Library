creations-chat 2021-04-15 20:50:32 I cant be able to fix that if I use ladders as railings
creations-chat 2021-04-15 20:52:42 Im not good at all at motorlocking
creations-chat 2021-04-15 20:55:29 Eh I will fix that area when I will be more experinced on motorlock
creations-chat 2021-12-23 14:45:32 LOL ikr (this was the best option to use for working guns)
creations-chat 2021-12-23 14:50:49 yes I know, the wepons arent so great for such a small size
creations-chat 2021-12-23 14:53:40 Thanks :)  The project was a remake of an normal old army  I used to have.
creations-chat 2021-12-23 14:56:49 Lol, but oh wait. This means Germany cant have Saint Loraine (or whatever that region was called) nooooooo.
creations-chat 2021-12-24 16:47:42 Thanks :)
creations-chat 2021-12-31 08:47:03 Is this hull for my ironclad good so far ?
creations-chat 2022-02-16 14:35:33 If more triangle blocks would exists, then I could do, but making an smooth hull based on blueprints then its way to complicated to do.
creations-chat 2022-02-16 14:37:44 Alright, I might gonna add wedges where I can. But the rest of the ship is good?
creations-chat 2022-02-16 14:41:55 That part suppose to be a kind of "sculpture" which  a part of the ships from that time used to have it.  Take Japanese ships during 19th and early 20th century ships as an exemple.
creations-chat 2022-02-16 14:43:56 Are you talking about how blocky the railings are?
creations-chat 2022-02-16 14:46:15 Ask those who actually designed them why. Those turrerts were that small from the actual ship.
creations-chat 2022-02-16 14:48:22 Well I used motor 2 for them so since I wanted those to stay sideways, I used to make like that.
creations-chat 2022-02-16 14:51:01 Only the hull and the railings from forecastle and poop deck are blocky. (And maybe the lifeboat davits)
creations-chat 2022-02-16 15:01:25 Hello
creations-chat 2022-02-16 15:08:25 Lol
creations-chat 2022-02-16 20:12:22 Thanks
creations-chat 2022-02-16 20:19:36 Way more grand than you think. I can post some photos on one of my best creations which is an fictional ocean liner.
creations-chat 2022-02-16 20:22:18 I dont mind
creations-chat 2022-02-16 20:28:01 So after I fix the blocky hull of my cruiser NMS Elisabeta. Should I use this paint job or I let the colors like how it is?
creations-chat 2022-02-16 21:17:04 Thats very nice colorization of the photo.
bug-reports 2022-06-18 14:50:56 idk if this is a bug or at least a roblox issue, but for some reasons, the water propellers has been weaken or something similar that my ships with lots of blocks which uses water propellers as a way of moving  cant sail anymore or they are moving like turtles or snails.
bug-reports 2022-06-20 10:26:18 well ik that to, but that  happend to a very good pc I am using right now
bug-reports 2022-06-20 11:28:18 I think a unannounced Roblox update made everything laggier
creations-chat 2022-08-12 19:59:24 wip
creations-chat 2022-09-02 18:52:36 Trying to make SS Great Britain
creations-chat 2022-09-02 19:48:45 the main reason which the ship looks like that is because it isnt finished
creations-chat 2022-09-02 19:54:46 ik it was angled but for me it is way to hard to make like that
creations-chat 2022-09-03 07:34:22 SS Great Britain is a passenger ship ( now a museum ship) which was made in 1839-1845 in Bristol. She was  the largest ship in the world during her time and the first to be made of iron and having  a screw propeller. The ship transported passengers until 1881 when the ship has been retired from Falkland island as a warehouse,quarantine ship and coal hulk. The ship has been abandoned in 1937 and in 1970 the ship has been saved and transported way back to Bristol where she became a museum ship.
creations-chat 2022-09-03 20:14:41 new progress to the ship
creations-chat 2022-09-03 21:27:09 Ok
creations-chat 2022-09-10 12:59:52 sup
creations-chat 2022-12-26 19:48:32 I tried to make Admiral Graf Spee's  main turret. How inaccurate is this thing in comparison with the actual ones?
creations-chat 2022-12-26 19:53:23 Thank you!
creations-chat 2022-12-27 13:35:53 Is that an ocean liner?
creations-chat 2023-06-05 18:21:23 Ignore them
creations-chat 2023-06-05 18:23:29 If I would be a shredder supporter than I would upvoted that horrible thing
creations-chat 2023-06-05 18:27:07 I don't rly like toxicity and agresions like this one. I hope you can understand that.
creations-chat 2023-06-05 18:29:24 Probably you are right
creations-chat 2023-06-05 18:32:16 Welp, time to mind my own business
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 12:33:31 A friend of mines tries to verify into this server but he cant because of the bot. He tried to dm the staff about the problem but none of them paid attention to him. In this situation, Is there something which he can do in order to verify?
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 13:17:03 Thats small in comparsion with this one
plane-crazy 2023-07-09 13:33:33 nice
creations-chat 2023-07-09 18:37:04 As long as some physics rules are changed against shredders, then we might don't even have shreddedrs
