general 2022-09-29 16:47:48 ahah
creations-chat 2022-10-26 08:34:47 <@962679587328905246> can you try a version with longer wedges for a less cartoony UFO ? That can be epic
creations-chat 2022-10-26 08:37:34 thx
creations-chat 2023-01-08 15:58:32 <@441125486312030221> Concorde* <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
creations-chat 2023-01-08 16:00:35 The Tupolev Tu-144 is just a pale Soviet copy of the Concorde
creations-chat 2023-01-08 16:04:41 <@441125486312030221> can you at least write Concorde/Tu-144
creations-chat 2023-01-08 16:08:24 ðŸ˜¥
The Tu-144 will always be a ripoff of the Plane from my country
Screw plans stealing
creations-chat 2023-01-08 16:10:57 Wrong ping xD
creations-chat 2023-01-08 16:14:29 You didnâ€™t want to respond to Simply_best ?

creations-chat 2023-01-08 16:21:18 <@1061298559833608232> wait, I did the exact same plane one time, the cockpit, the tail, the basic shape, I know itâ€™s just a coincidence, but it looks almost the same xD
creations-chat 2023-01-08 16:25:45 France 17:25, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m here

bot-central 2023-01-08 17:07:53 what
creations-chat 2023-01-08 17:08:57 nyeh wait, the screenshot is glitched
creations-chat 2023-01-08 17:12:09 
creations-chat 2023-01-08 17:15:26 middle tiling is epic, but the reactors and the cabin could be way simpler and thicker
WAIT, THE ASTROMECH DROID, IT'S AWESOME
creations-chat 2023-01-08 17:25:38 Yeah looks better like that
creations-chat 2023-01-08 17:35:01 Yoooo
creations-chat 2023-01-11 15:29:50 <@659472689903173672> This build didnâ€™t deserve that number of downvote. Imo this TIE looks awesome
creations-chat 2023-01-11 15:45:29 Mech (old screen, the knee are less long)
creations-chat 2023-01-11 15:56:39 Mine walk, but donâ€™t fight
(Puppet thrusters walking)
creations-chat 2023-01-12 17:37:50 <@809781295500099584> can you make a mp4 for the reload ?
creations-chat 2023-01-15 11:55:18 Are the x wing turbines too big ?
creations-chat 2023-01-15 12:00:20 Yup
creations-chat 2023-01-15 12:12:11 Ok thx
creations-chat 2023-01-15 12:38:57 Ahah
creations-chat 2023-01-15 13:30:42 Closed version bcs I didnâ€™t post it
creations-chat 2023-01-15 14:00:56 Yeah, the wings are too big
creations-chat 2023-01-16 13:50:36 Itâ€™s not a pixel art, itâ€™s just tiling
creations-chat 2023-01-17 11:49:05 Can you send it on private messages ?
creations-chat 2023-01-17 11:52:11 Ok
creations-chat 2023-01-19 19:41:24 I want to die
creations-chat 2023-01-19 19:44:24 SUUUUUUPEEEEEEEEER
creations-chat 2023-01-19 21:04:23 Dumb theory, but maybe use the lock option on your motors (still powered). They'll be stronger and will not glitch anymore.

It's a common technique in mecha building.
creations-chat 2023-01-19 21:06:30 Oh my god it's epic
creations-chat 2023-01-19 21:09:00 Don't, locked motor 1 + powered
creations-chat 2023-01-19 21:18:44 are the powered ?
the motors need to be both ...
creations-chat 2023-01-19 21:20:47 <@456226577798135808> They'll move locked or not if this configuration is respected (normally)
creations-chat 2023-01-19 21:23:39 maybe powered+lock+high speed
and no toggle
creations-chat 2023-01-20 06:24:56 the ship is good but I'm not a big fan of the sparklers
AH WAIT my bad
creations-chat 2023-01-20 12:11:45 I donâ€™t rly like the shape of the turbines
Too square
creations-chat 2023-01-20 12:14:15 Yeah, the fans are good, I talk about the overall shape of the turbine
-
But I think thereâ€™s no alternative for this size
creations-chat 2023-01-21 21:14:48 
creations-chat 2023-01-21 21:25:33 It stills wip, so I will not flood <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2023-01-21 21:37:10 I don't think the color is the issue, the issue is the experience
(quality of the build, colors, or just the concept itself)
for example, <@738448924368568360> did a solid job for those builds in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2023-01-21 21:40:26 1-wides ?
creations-chat 2023-01-21 21:43:00 <@1002999721939456012> if you kept the shape of the nose for all the ballon, that would be sick
use the wedge stair technique for all the ballon
creations-chat 2023-01-21 23:11:31 Who then ?
creations-chat 2023-01-25 13:46:30 <@806299963721252864> you reversed the French flag :(
creations-chat 2023-01-26 11:47:31 Nvm nice buid
creations-chat 2023-01-26 11:50:25 You used exactly the thing I did for the wings, but itâ€™s just a coincidence xD
creations-chat 2023-01-28 12:01:30 <@639374429532717056> nyeheh
I need to make a v3 one day
creations-chat 2023-01-28 15:49:03 Never fixed <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>
creations-chat 2023-06-30 16:58:38 You should repost it imo
creations-chat 2023-06-30 17:02:27 The ro-bot
creations-chat 2023-06-30 17:46:44 I think ppl can start creating a screenshot session business
