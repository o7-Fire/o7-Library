creations-chat 2023-04-20 17:11:12 <@833983766748725258> you do realise that the bot doesn’t delete messages itself, the mods will do a command to make the bot warn someone.
creations-chat 2023-04-20 17:19:24 Stop telling them to fix the bot then
creations-chat 2023-07-09 13:08:20 These are the type of people who are the reason why this discord community is considered so toxic. Just gotta be an asshole to all the white name builders, just because they have no builder roles. How are they expected to get one of those roles if the entire server downvotes their genuinely good builds that are better than most non-whitenamed builds and full on abuses them?

general 2023-07-11 19:29:29 What the frog have I just walked into
general 2023-07-11 19:31:17 What is happening
general 2023-07-11 19:31:49 That is a fact
general 2023-07-11 19:32:03 Every man is gay for Ryan Reynolds
general 2023-07-11 19:32:12 It’s the unspoken rule
general 2023-07-11 19:33:08 Just be a man, not that deep
general 2023-07-11 19:33:22 Men are better <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-07-11 19:34:02 Not that deep, just change
general 2023-07-11 19:34:32 I think we all know what that means
general 2023-07-11 19:39:35 They should make it so you have to fill out stacks of legal documents just to roleplay with your friend as a mother and child
general 2023-07-11 19:40:05 Goodnight 😁

general 2023-07-11 21:02:52 You still here?
general 2023-07-11 21:03:13 I saw you chatting like 2 hours ago
general 2023-07-11 21:03:49 Wow
general 2023-07-11 21:04:18 That image is completely blank 💀
general 2023-07-11 21:04:29 Heel naw
general 2023-07-11 21:04:37 Ik
general 2023-07-11 21:04:45 I’m not that stupid
general 2023-07-11 21:04:59 Don’t worry about it
general 2023-07-11 21:06:33 Do you think i should carry on making my F-15 or do something else, like I have a couple of facilities that are unfinished, an unfinished Fnaf mega pizzarea, a barely started M1A1 Abrams. Whatchu think?
general 2023-07-11 21:07:43 But I like actual planes
general 2023-07-11 21:07:51 I can’t be bothered to make my own
general 2023-07-11 21:08:27 Dealing with the utter chaos of the motor lock to make it NamNam style is already too much
general 2023-07-11 21:08:51 I’m broke man 💀
general 2023-07-11 21:09:02 Don’t get money until Friday
general 2023-07-11 21:09:13 NamNam style planes are cool
general 2023-07-11 21:09:27 Well I have 17 pence 💀
general 2023-07-11 21:10:21 I’m using the NamNam mechanics from the supermanoverable guide. I already made the SU-35 and it work really well so I wanted to make my own one
general 2023-07-11 21:11:25 I don’t wanna buy something for plane crazy building. I just like usual get an image of the aircraft and then a blueprint
general 2023-07-11 21:12:02 HAKER?!!1?!!?!1!
general 2023-07-11 21:12:05 💀💀💀
general 2023-07-11 21:12:31 I’m just chatting here bc I have nothing better to do and I need chat lvl 3 for image perms
general 2023-07-11 21:12:49 Cus I wanna post a build in <#384025409945337856>
general 2023-07-11 21:12:59 Yippee
general 2023-07-11 21:13:27 You gotta admit tho, NamNam is a great aironautical plane crazy engineer
general 2023-07-11 21:14:51 Probably bc they have a degree in aironautical engineering, and rather than using it to win wars with great planes, they just spend their life making guides on a crappy Lego game that can barely simulate real life physics so that 5 year olds can build moderately good builds for the first and only times in their life
general 2023-07-11 21:15:04 💀
general 2023-07-11 21:15:21 SWeaRIng?
general 2023-07-11 21:15:30 ?
general 2023-07-11 21:15:40 Wdym?
general 2023-07-11 21:15:45 They do
general 2023-07-11 21:16:09 They are some of the best pvp planes you will ever encounter
general 2023-07-11 21:16:18 What speed?
general 2023-07-11 21:17:23 What speeds tho?
general 2023-07-11 21:17:48 Fair point
general 2023-07-11 21:18:14 Only true if you can hit it when it’s doing 360 in a 3x3 area at 1000 speeds
general 2023-07-11 21:20:27 Deadass, that is a you problem. My SU-35 doesn’t even slightly wobble up until about 1600
general 2023-07-11 21:20:53 And my friend who used the guide for the basics and made his own F-15J can go up to 1300 or so without wobbling
general 2023-07-11 21:21:04 I gtg now anyway
general 2023-07-11 21:21:08 I’ll cya then
general 2023-07-11 21:21:14 I’m tired as fuck
general 2023-07-11 21:21:29 So do I

general 2023-07-11 21:25:03 What are you even on about lad
general 2023-07-11 21:25:10 I have non of those issues
general 2023-07-11 21:25:20 Maybe you just didn’t do it properly
general 2023-07-11 21:25:37 Bc I did all the fine tuning with wing panels to make it better
general 2023-07-11 21:26:07 I can whip past people and flick them with some missiles
general 2023-07-11 21:26:35 I also have a version with guns 💩 and a pair or railguns
general 2023-07-11 21:26:58 I can obliterate ground targets
general 2023-07-11 21:27:08 It’s harder for air targets
general 2023-07-11 21:27:28 But I can just outmanover them and it’s impossible for them to destroy me
general 2023-07-11 21:27:36 And after a bit I destroy them
