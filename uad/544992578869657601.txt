general 2023-02-04 17:20:55 bro down detector when from 0 issues to 15,483 issues reported
general 2023-02-04 17:22:07 skill issue
general 2023-02-04 17:25:36 when ur currently playing roblox and everyone else is having issues
general 2023-02-23 18:44:48 bro what is wrong with people always assuming every complicated build is a fucking tut
general 2023-02-23 18:45:02 like im genuinley annoyed at this point
general 2023-02-23 18:45:23 ive had multiple people accuse me of a 777 i made that took over 2 weeksfor it being a tut
general 2023-02-23 18:45:39 its so fucking annoying
general 2023-02-23 18:45:42 true
general 2023-02-23 18:46:50 yeah but it just pisses me off so much
general 2023-02-23 18:47:03 like just because its a simulator build syste doesnt mean its a tut
general 2023-02-23 18:47:13 but like how are we supposed to make it different
general 2023-02-23 18:47:17 if we're building the same plane
general 2023-02-23 18:47:22 then it should look very similar
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 18:48:16 btw this is the 777 im talking about in general
general 2023-02-23 18:48:26 but if they're the same plane
general 2023-02-23 18:48:29 wouldnt it looks similar
general 2023-02-23 18:48:36 because we're going for the same looks
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 18:48:53 had to, barley any space for motor lock n shit
general 2023-02-23 18:49:38 true true
general 2023-02-23 18:49:48 but in like trhe big picture, the builds would be very similar
