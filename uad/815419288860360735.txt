creations-chat 2021-09-06 18:08:14 Compared to my builds all of these are good :/
creations-chat 2021-09-06 18:12:58 5/10 good shape but kinda bland, I would make the fireplace a slightly different shade of that color
creations-chat 2021-09-06 18:17:41 Use a different shade of the original color so it still blends well but you can see the difference between the wall and the actual fireplace
