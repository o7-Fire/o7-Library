Yes, they all copy me

Stay in all designer clothes
And they ask me what I make
I said it's 10 with six zeros
Always plug, merch link in bio

the-dump 2020-05-30 04:38:44 Yah
Y'all can't handle this
Y'all don't know what's about to happen, baby
Team 10
Los Angeles, Cali boy
But I'm from Ohio though, white boy

[Verse 1: Jake Paul]
It's everyday bro, with the Disney Channel flow
Five mill on YouTube in six months, never done before
Passed all the competition, man, PewDiePie is next
Man I'm poppin' all these checks, got the brand new Rolex
And it match the Lambo too and I'm coming with the crew
This is Team 10, bitch, who the hell are flippin' you?
And you know I kick them out if they ain't with the crew
Yeah, I'm talking about you, you beggin' for attention
Talking shit on Twitter too but you still hit my phone last night
It was 4:52 and I got the text to prove
And all the recordings too, don't make me tell them the truth
And I just dropped some new merch, and it's selling like a god, church
Ohio's where I'm from, we chew 'em like it's gum
We shooting with a gun, the tattoo just for fun
I Usain Bolt and run, catch me at game one
I cannot be outdone, Jake Paul is number one

[Chorus: Jake Paul]
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
I said it's everyday bro!

[Verse 2: Nick Crompton]
You know it's Nick Crompton and my collar stay poppin'
Yes, I can rap and no, I'm not from Compton
England is my city
And if it weren't for Team 10, then the US would be shitty
I'll pass it to Chance 'cause you know he stay litty
the-dump 2020-05-30 04:38:53 [Verse 3: Chance Sutton]
Two months ago you didn't know my name
And now you want my fame?
Bitch I'm blowin' up, I'm only going up
Now I'm going off, I'm never fallin' off
Like Mag, who? Digi who? Who are you?
All these beefs I just ran through, hit a milli in a month
Where were you? Hatin' on me back in West Fake
Think you need to get your shit straight
Jakey brought me to the top, now we really poppin' off
Number one and number four, that's why these fans all at our door
It's lonely at the top so we all going
We left Ohio, now the trio is all rollin'
It's Team 10, bitch
We back again, always first, never last
We the future, we'll see you in the past

[Chorus: Jake Paul]
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
I said it's everyday bro!

[Interlude: Martinez Twins]
Hold on, hold on, hold on (Espera)
Can we switch the language? (Ha, ya tú sabe')
We 'bout to hit it (Dale)

[Verse 5: Tessa Brooks]
Yo, it's Tessa Brooks
The competition shook
These guys up on me
I got 'em with the hook
Lemme educate ya
And I ain't talking book
Panera is your home?
So, stop calling my phone
I'm flyin' like a drone
They buying like a loan
Yeah, I smell good
Is that your boy's cologne?

[Verse 6: Jake Paul]
Is that your boy's cologne?

plane-crazy 2020-06-02 04:43:01 should i do the ryzen 7 4800
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 04:43:13 or ryzen 9
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 04:43:23 i need it to be portable
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 04:43:44 i aint carrying around some giant corsair case
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 04:43:47 or nzxt

plane-crazy 2020-06-02 04:45:18 ive already built 2 pc's
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 04:45:30 but they had crap parts
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 04:46:05 I was looking at the G-15 with 2060
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 04:46:21 though it only comes with ryzen 9
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 04:46:23 i think
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 04:46:26 and 240hz

plane-crazy 2020-06-02 04:48:09 but its a good build
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 04:48:27 because there are ryzen 3 2600's for cheap

bot-central 2020-09-25 00:25:30 lol
bot-central 2020-09-25 00:39:30 I feel bad for whoever has to read all this
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:03:15 <@!432344306427101184> Bruh you just generated terrain for your map
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:03:16 lol
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:03:45 How did you make it then
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:04:18 Did you add any buildings
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:04:21 I didnt see any
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:04:32 You might wanna add an ocean too
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:05:12 I am very good at modeling in studio
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:05:17 so the airports and buildings
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:05:19 should be easy
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:05:31 Im making my own
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:05:35 with a friend
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:05:37 yes
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:06:20 yes
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:56:40 The map itself is good
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:56:42 But
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:56:48 The models look crap
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:58:16 I think I could Make some really good bridges and airports for them
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:58:20 Im good at modeling
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:58:53 Im making my own map rn
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:58:54 but
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:59:02 The map may not be as good
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:59:08 but models will probably be better
bot-central 2020-09-25 01:59:32 ~~ping rick~~
bot-central 2020-09-25 02:00:19 The map wont be laggy
bot-central 2020-09-25 02:00:30 I would be able to keep the part count down
bot-central 2020-09-25 02:00:36 thats not the hard part
bot-central 2020-09-25 02:00:47 there really is no hard part
bot-central 2020-09-25 02:00:53 its a really easy map
bot-central 2020-09-25 02:01:11 No
bot-central 2020-09-25 02:01:15 If you union them
bot-central 2020-09-25 02:01:35 Then they become a single piece
bot-central 2020-09-25 02:01:47 grouping is mostly used for meshes
