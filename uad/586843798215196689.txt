plane-crazy 2021-01-05 22:45:50 It makes me sad this game hasn't been updated in quite a bit... I wish there were more parts
general 2021-01-05 22:47:31 I've played this game for over 1.5 years. I just get bored quickly and when I flee my real life problems to play sum plane crazy it just ends up with me building another plane and leaving out of boredom.
general 2021-01-05 22:48:37 True but I like a lot of interesting mechanics
general 2021-01-05 22:49:22 Sthu lmao
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 11:04:50 yo guys, anybody know when a new update will come? Im curious
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:18:56 this game needs an update

plane-crazy 2021-03-18 22:35:21 bro chill
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:24:15 true
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:24:26 people just need to gradually get better
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:24:39 and only use tutorials for inspiration
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:25:20 but only after gradually building up skill
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:25:22 imo
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:26:27 <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:26:41 go to <#504436696021204992>  pls
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:26:49 oh ok
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:29:03 i mean, i played for 2 years now. i wasn't really good neither did i need motorlock. i had a good time. at this point i use motorlock often. playing for a longer time is just as good as playing a tutorial and getting inspired. i personally never "copied" (or how you want to call it) a tutorial neither do i plan on doing so
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:29:41 true
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:29:46 no content added since june
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:30:02 true but to some extent
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:30:15 the stairs i think
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:31:22 thats made by an entire game studio doe
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:31:49 quite nice
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:32:39 same lol
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:33:05 yea
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:33:22 motor2 is servo right
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:33:46 if they would add it it better not be a gamepass doe
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:34:16 i mean i would pay robux for like new jet engines but not for basically the base game
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:34:41 yoo
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:34:59 people would find some way to abuse it
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:35:18 i mean its bannable
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:35:22 ig
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:37:07 yo
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:37:13 with settings
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:37:41 they need some kind of system where things can catch on fire
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:38:56 true
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:39:09 i would like fire in the game though
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:39:37 only for collisions
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:41:23 why does almost everyone here want weapons? why not some seats for commercial aircraft, maybe thrust reverse engines, blocks with round windows in them or like anything else thats not a fighter jet missile or warship torpedo
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:41:46 but new engines
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:42:20 i mean good engines with actual realism
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:42:49 yea you can also make missiles yourself
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:43:15 but like big engine parts that have thrust reverse built in so you dont need two
plane-crazy 2021-03-23 15:43:56 cya
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:14:51 you guys should really try stormworks
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:14:57 its like plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:15:16 but with updates every week <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:15:25 nice
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:15:52 i really like plane crazy but the lack of new content is just so stupid
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:16:07 yea
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:16:25 i know
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:16:51 but not a single new block or item since august last year
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:16:56 except for a gamepass
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:17:09 i know
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:17:11 but yea
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:17:28 im not complaining
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:17:37 im just saying its a good game
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:17:44 but i shifted interest
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:17:58 omg 😳
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:18:12 If that would happen <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:18:35 <:Downvote:490311668556103700>
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:19:05 it wouldn't

plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:19:54 i only use ¼ of the save data
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:20:08 so why not use the rest for more slots
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:20:18 <:Thinkje139:590548255927173201>
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:20:38 yea lol
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:21:31 the only thing the game needs imo are more engines and sounds
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:21:44 and maybe a map
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:23:34 
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:23:40 true
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:23:49 if you got the rig to run it though
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:24:05 but it aint that performance heavy
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:24:14 ok
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:24:49 stormworks has 2x4 wedgeblock and 2x2 triangle wedges 😳

plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:33:35 i think it pays the price back in fun
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:33:39 nice
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:33:54 with all plane crazy gamepasses you'd be spending more

plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:41:44 ik it exists
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:41:58 but imagine sitting in the cockpit of your plane and looking around
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:42:38 yes

plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:46:28 True but only the custom engines i think
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:46:33 There are some tutorials i think
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:46:38 About gearboxes
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:46:54 Just thinking about them gives me a headache though
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:47:13 I think about making a plane cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:47:18 With like monitors
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:47:39 Its soo cool having a monitor that shows live feed of cameras
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:47:53 Hmm also
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:47:59 I think touch screen is hard though
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:48:26 Yea
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:48:40 My favorite part is the heater 😳
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:49:03 true
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:49:20 imagine sitting inside of a ship and there is a storm
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:49:27 and its cold 🥶
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:49:33 that sucks
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:49:41 wait can you get thermal clothing?
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:49:56 i thought you could only get helmets
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:50:45 i figured
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:51:30 i never saw the clothing thing tho
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:51:36 probably skipped over it
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:51:48 no
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:52:14 its always nice to have a fire extinguisher 🧯 close by
plane-crazy 2021-03-28 20:52:23 burning to death is cringe
