plane-crazy 2021-07-16 03:57:26 water when\
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 03:58:53 bigger ocean is literally such an easy way to increase overall map size and also everyone wants a bigger water area
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 03:59:39 trees could be annoying
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 03:59:41 unless
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 03:59:43 destructible
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:00:36 lots of potential
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:00:39 all we can do is wait though
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:02:16 arent physics calculated only when youre close
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:03:21 i mean yeah, but you know how people will get their lag builds close to you so it lags you out
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:03:35 so probably only works for players nearby
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:04:23 i think at that point its just the server itself being affected
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:04:41 so maybe huge destructible map wouldnt be a good idea
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:05:29 true that
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:05:43 if plot size could be increased currently it wouldve been, everyone always asks for that but think about it
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 04:05:48 if it could be done it wouldve been

plane-crazy 2021-07-19 08:32:57 top right corner should be the cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 08:32:59 nothing else
creations-chat 2021-07-19 08:38:43 using metal material to darken wheels also works if youre not using fabric

creations-chat 2021-07-25 18:21:59 from that picture the wing looks stubby and the base too wide, maybe the wing could also be a bit thinner
