help 2022-03-08 21:44:31 is it there any way to prevent my ships spawn below sea surface? from since it started spawning like that i was not able to spawn the whole ship without a motor 2 being flung into mars
help 2022-03-08 21:47:19 if i unanchor the ship the motors breaks and goes crazy
help 2022-03-08 21:48:37 usually the motor 2s that are used to move the guns up and down first
help 2022-03-08 21:48:51 since they are welded to a base where is moved by another motor
help 2022-03-08 21:50:36 probably
help 2022-03-08 21:51:03 from motor 2s?

help 2022-03-08 21:55:34 hull
help 2022-03-08 21:57:27 if i use wedges in most parts of the ship it will get more unnecessary parts
help 2022-03-08 21:57:48 and basically take a while to add it to all the ships i have
help 2022-03-08 22:00:40 is not like i really know to use 1x4 wedges on larger hulls and with the triangle wedgeblocks aswell
help 2022-03-08 22:01:36 nope

help 2022-11-07 03:24:11 is it a good idea to add a XF-85 to a very modified Madvulpen's B-29?
help 2022-11-07 03:25:46 by what reasons?
help 2022-11-07 03:26:26 but why would it not go well on it?
help 2022-11-07 03:27:29 i find it fine to make the b29 warp away with 8 conveyor engines a lil away from the fight area when locking the motor 2s movement after releasing the jet
help 2022-11-07 03:27:41 ofc jet moved my mouse
help 2022-11-07 03:27:56 alr then
help 2022-11-07 03:29:07 20th blubble chat in a row today thats new
help 2022-11-07 03:33:47 nvm i see why now
help 2022-11-07 03:34:19 it would look like a massive ball at the back of the plane and may block funny tnt dose nuke
help 2022-11-08 02:02:33 I've made the steel olive go fly good 'n nice
general 2022-11-08 14:03:57 NAOO
general 2022-11-08 14:09:49 3 updates?
general 2022-11-08 14:10:45 it kicked m from pvp <:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2022-11-08 14:12:02 abt 3 times ofc
general 2022-11-08 14:44:26 currently going on the 12th message and tp update
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 22:55:53 **i am inside your walls**
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 22:56:33 ofc by shredders and other things
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 02:09:12 the steel olive finally its done
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 02:09:55 XF-85 inspired on a b29
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 02:10:49 i had no choice
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 22:57:50 depends the context
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 22:58:11 yes
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 22:58:14 i remember y
plane-crazy 2022-11-09 22:58:51 yet stuff like that needs alot of improvement since the last modification had lot of issues
plane-crazy 2022-11-29 04:05:53 gobblin jet idea went so bad at the start that now its one of the best defensive system i have on the B-29
general 2022-12-18 18:13:34 vamoo
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:10:45 after 45 minutes straight of 3 shredders chasing a B29 and they were not even able to shoot one engine out
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:11:21 ~~i feel like if i have posted this in the wrong channel again~~
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:26:43 plus 8 more to warp üëç
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:27:10 first goblin version before repaint
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:27:17 conveyor engines
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:27:28 from the front you see at the engines some blocky parts on it
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:27:33 parasite goblin plane
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:27:44 before it, it was just bigger bomb bay
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:29:50 was a b-29 on the past
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:29:53 now its uh
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:30:03 anti shredder more likely plane
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:30:33 sadly it doesnt works and gets taken apart the moment it gets any shot
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:31:20 depends the context
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:31:42 shoots? yes
damage? no (visible damage there was from around 35 minutes ago)
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:32:19 no shredding to resume
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:33:48 was made year and half ago when it become that so basically its worthless to throw it away
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:34:06 https://tenor.com/view/dentedhead-speech-bubble-hldmbrnet-gif-25216740
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:34:32 so what then?
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:35:45 have like 3 already
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:36:24 they are most likely useless against shredders
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:36:58 exept against fast jets
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:37:51 i would dare to say a c.450
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:39:28 turns slower than a bomber
plane-crazy 2022-12-26 23:40:04 thats mostly the only good thing of it besides other things
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 15:46:27 similar thing exept color, tail, type of engine and amount of gunners ontop
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 15:47:27 imo its true, but doesnt remove the fact that is/was a b29 in the past when it was without modifying
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 03:12:48 I have been struggling the last 2 hours trying to put this whole superstructure section into this 8 blocks of height starting from the Main Deck and without enough space to the side or inside to make other 40 folds for the bridge, funnel or mast
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 03:12:57 anyone got any ideas for help?
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 03:17:22 <:stuff:908917207986208828> ?
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 22:06:26 somehow, with some guy setting off a lag nuke powerful enough to break plot owns, i can now do a co-op build
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 22:24:05 ships with detailed interior and 5 folds for it should be good enough <:clueless:942802644043464734>
