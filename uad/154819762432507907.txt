plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:39:22 Does Magnets help with Folding planes?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:40:17 Does magnets help connect the plane up when it folds?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:45:24 I have also learnt that, if you use Trails... You can use them to make them look like emergency doors on an aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:46:10 you can
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:46:11 it works
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:46:23 
general 2020-08-03 03:50:09 moved from talking about boats to sisters and brothers.. ok
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 04:57:25 so me no understand how 2 maek planes
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 04:57:41 considoring i make a good body, but the engines of my planes somehow ends up being too low and making the aircraft higher
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 05:06:23 scary spooky spoopy
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 05:07:12 huge
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 05:11:37 i just dont get it
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 05:11:44 but my wing has to be so high just for the engine to be right
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 05:12:35 ive already tried previous versions with landing gears of the aircaft

like i said.. **it hasnt worked**
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 05:17:55 I have
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 05:18:23 previous versions with landing gear, the engines were too low, and landing gear was useless because the engines kept colliding with the ground
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 13:43:42 my B737 has 1k parts
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 13:44:18 
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 13:44:43 helium blocks??
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 13:45:20 i remember using Helium blocks to make a Gyro, a thing that would always point a stick straight up no matter where you were on the map
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 13:45:55 I feel like doing a different Boeing 737 livery, and have the James Strong Qantas livery on
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 13:46:16 (retro livery btw)
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 13:50:10 i love this wing bending detail on the plane, this was only caused because of motors.
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 13:50:37 omg lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 13:50:41 ive had that happen before
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 13:50:44 but with 1x7 block
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 13:50:49 oh wait
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 13:50:51 that is a 1x7 block
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 13:51:12 yeah it rarely happens, but it happens
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 13:51:54 I am unsure if i should put on the "james strong" qantas livery on my boeing 737
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 13:52:17 or the "retro roo"
creations-chat 2020-08-13 13:55:09 Wing bend detail.. (due to motors) I think some most plane builds should have this..
creations-chat 2020-08-13 13:56:04 I only used 1 motor on each wing, and it suddenly makes it look like the whole entire wing bends
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:18:12 oh wrong chat
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:18:21 oops
plane-crazy 2020-08-15 06:09:30 <#384025409945337856> reminds me of reddit.. just voting for random stuff
creations-chat 2021-01-20 02:44:33 bruh what, flying without a stabilizer just makes your plane drift to your death
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 02:47:37 who knew it was that easy to split a plane into 3 just that easy
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 11:10:48 
creations-chat 2021-01-21 12:23:32 hey guys, im wondering if its possible to make boats sink, im trying to make a mini titanic and make it sink and im using as much thrusters as possible, and when it does end up being underwater, the front ones pushing the boat down into the water take over and does a loop and raises back to surface
creations-chat 2021-01-21 12:30:56 ballast tanks dont seem to work it still wants to stay afloat
creations-chat 2021-01-21 12:36:11 is it possible to make a ship gradually sink?
creations-chat 2021-01-22 04:01:24 going exploring for titanic underwater
creations-chat 2021-01-23 03:24:31 Work In Progress F-35 Fighter, what are your thoughts
creations-chat 2021-01-23 05:42:59 <@!698131825662361663> that UP engine, how did you even fit that many carriages in your base

help 2021-12-12 22:47:47 oh ok
help 2021-12-12 23:16:07 no but yes
creations-chat 2021-12-13 00:20:01 It seems far from shite to me
help 2021-12-13 00:20:58 better than what I can do lol
help 2021-12-13 00:21:04 all I can do is build trains... nothing else
help 2021-12-13 00:25:10 I never thought of taking a side screenshot and photoshop a blueprint over it...
help 2021-12-13 00:25:15 thats so smart
help 2021-12-13 00:26:34 0k
help 2021-12-13 00:26:41 while that happens... imma continue on my SD70ACE
help 2021-12-13 00:27:09 true tho
help 2021-12-13 00:27:12 I made a wonky boeing 737
help 2021-12-13 00:27:20 and people called it "tutorial plane"
help 2021-12-13 00:32:33 my goodness
help 2021-12-13 00:32:58 I tried to use camera lock for windshield wipers but the trail part doesnt want to be too close to the windscreen
creations-chat 2021-12-13 09:03:05 Is there a way I can make a creation fly so I can aim it and put it on the train tracks? (I know theres a thing called spawning a train on the tracks, but my train is so big It doesn't fit)
help 2021-12-13 09:28:32 Any sort of way I can make this hover and fly to place on the tracks? I need this locomotive to be in 3 foldable bits and it wont be aligned on the tracks when doing so.
help 2021-12-13 09:29:17 not even close to helpful
help 2021-12-13 09:30:15 ok, but how is it gonna stay stable?
help 2021-12-13 09:31:53 oh nah yeh, lemme just drive it there- Oh wait no sorry I cant 'cause gliders exist
help 2021-12-13 09:32:57 have you even read what I said?
help 2021-12-13 09:34:01 I said It needs to be foldable into 3 pieces... I am not putting the 3rd piece on a 3 block wide area
help 2021-12-13 09:34:16 Im moving it to the side to make more room, which means it wont be aligned with the rails no more
help 2021-12-13 09:37:16 hmm
help 2021-12-13 09:37:29 0k what about this... how do I make the folds stay attached?
help 2021-12-13 09:37:42 they are kinda loose when only folding and they get undone
creations-chat 2021-12-13 12:57:48 I need other peoples opinions, I have been working on a EMD SD70ACE, I'm adding details later but I just need to see what yall think of the shape and proportions and stuff
help 2021-12-13 13:33:02 My foldable train doesn't fold right... I've followed the advice of "max torque" on motors... didnt do anything. I tried putting magnets on but they seemingly do NOTHING.
help 2021-12-13 13:37:18 What do you mean? It's fine where they are considering It worked before
help 2021-12-13 23:24:38 I took apart my train, but before I completely take it apart Is it true this type of "fold" Is useless?
help 2021-12-13 23:27:20 well it works... but afterwards it has a spasm
help 2021-12-13 23:27:30 as soon as my train moves
help 2021-12-13 23:28:11 dont tell me thats how it gets fixed... after taking it apart to replace the fold
help 2021-12-13 23:28:20 ok well its worth a try
help 2021-12-13 23:34:50 I tested it by putting a bunch of blocks on the back for weight, it doesnt SEEM to spaz
help 2021-12-13 23:34:58 I will see what happens when I build the full thing
help 2021-12-13 23:40:43 It's powered with max torque and locked
help 2021-12-13 23:41:18 ok
creations-chat 2021-12-14 09:35:27 good or bad
creations-chat 2021-12-14 11:28:21 no I reckon it needs a rebuild, it seems a bit long
(though I am not from America so I can be wrong)
creations-chat 2021-12-16 22:17:44 train dashcam ðŸ˜³
creations-chat 2021-12-16 22:27:35 maybe some random details like half wedges or handrails, AKA use trails
