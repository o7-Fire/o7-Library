general 2022-07-12 08:08:29 u can actually lose rank if u get banned?
general 2022-07-12 08:08:52 discord
general 2022-07-12 08:09:41 weird since i used to have terrain specialist 1 b4 i got banned (perm ban) and had to rejoin
general 2022-07-12 08:10:39 tf is space sailors
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 13:44:40 i hope they add night vision sights to plane crazy 2 since pvp at night is hard
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 13:52:35 pvp tools are lacking ngl so maybe sonar could help with naval war
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 14:00:19 and maybe make a fishing minigame to go along with it
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 14:02:14 also i think sonar could be optimized if there was a range limit and the range was nearer the smaller the target so that nobody could just immediately find everybody and maybe make it toggle if ur in the water
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 14:05:15 tho radar would be way harder to implement
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 14:07:04 yeah but there will be a limit
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 14:07:35 maybe 1000 studs for battleship size targets and 350 for subs
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 14:07:42 there are missiles in pc1
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 14:07:51 not sure
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 14:08:10 have to improvise
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 14:09:25 radar will be harder to implement since theres 2 types (reflective radar and transponder radar)
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 14:09:50 or maybe radar jammers and stealth materials that decrease the range at which ur spotter
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 14:10:23 its either reflect with what it can see to blips or rely on the vehicles transponder
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 14:11:13 tho im sure the expolsive capabilities will be crap
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 14:12:54 its laser guided which means lasers and LWRs will have to be implemented
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 14:14:39 but there could only be one pilot seat
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 14:14:55 u mean laser rangefinder
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 14:15:26 tho the stealth material will affect speed due to its ridiculous weight
plane-crazy 2022-07-16 10:22:37 Tho the B variant was slightly longer and had a new turret
plane-crazy 2022-07-17 11:06:06 Ok ni gg er

plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:04:47 tbf it was due to the fact that the PAF sucks ass at bombing
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:09:12 i just managed to make a realistic looking smoke effect for bombed out buildings
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:12:22 does it look like shit
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:15:54 like this?

plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:40:23 It use m16a1 lower my guy
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:40:40 So it counts
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 03:41:53 Tho it uses 556 instead of 223 (differs in the neck and the pressure)
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 05:23:25 you can also make your own grass with dirt
creations-chat 2022-08-17 09:08:25 it looks like that since it has a high TTW ratio (required for navy fighters)
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 12:40:34 i just realized that rickje reacted in my suggestion
plane-crazy 2022-08-19 13:11:35 just get 3 beams, 4 motors, 4 cylinder 3x3s and ur good to go

plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:11:33 then use the corroded metal texture
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:11:39 its in materials
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:13:34 just paint the rust texture
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:13:49 no i mean like sights
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:14:25 for tanks tho for long range shit u need an ir searchlight which will be caught by other nv sights so ur position is revealed if ur ir light is on
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:22:26 kinda like this
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:23:59 i meant the feature for pc2
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:24:18 tho i hope he doesnt implement hybrid sights
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:24:35 or else ground builds will be op
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:24:54 my builds look goofy as fuck
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 01:25:30 i have a goofy ahh gripen inspired jet

plane-crazy 2022-08-26 00:39:32 then try to copy the mechanism of the real jet
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 00:44:12 then make a good looking mechanism
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 00:44:41 such as putting 2 motors and stashing it in the gearwell
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 00:44:56 and make a gear design
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 00:55:29 what i mean is with the space there, make a rear gear design and use 2 motor 2s to rotate it into the gearwell
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 08:56:30 summer 2022
plane-crazy 2022-08-26 10:14:44 madattak did abandon PC thats why rick is the current dev

creations-chat 2022-09-15 02:22:21 wtf man i already proved that he photoshopped the first ipad ss (via an ss of mine predating his)
creations-chat 2022-09-15 02:24:30 bitch imovie is in ur ipad and it works as premiere pro/photoshop so ur photoshopless arguement doesnt work since photoshop is now a general term for image editors instead of a specific product
creations-chat 2022-09-15 02:27:22 show me all ss of imovie since you could have just deleted it
creations-chat 2022-09-15 02:31:13 proof that i didnt photoshop anything
creations-chat 2022-09-15 02:33:29 its a vtuber so im even more fcked it started since grady decided to extort people of robux and accounts
creations-chat 2022-09-15 02:35:56 u said ipad now u saying pc? must be capping
creations-chat 2022-09-15 02:37:59 also schools normally have firewalls not sure in his area tho in the philippines (where i live) theres firewalls for that stuff tho imma guess hes either canadian or french from the apps in his ipad
creations-chat 2022-09-15 02:40:40 at elementary school, they taught us JS and blender modelling tho i suck with modelling since my pc cant handle high poly models (above 15m polys per model) especially with phong shading
creations-chat 2022-09-15 02:43:07 as an ipad user i can say hes on a ipad (tho my experience is with a hand me down ipad air 2 with a huge crack)

creations-chat 2022-09-15 02:58:36 nah man 7th grade in the filipino sense is 12-13 since school starts at 4 y/o here for some reason tho its more common in areas outside the capital

plane-crazy 2022-12-16 08:32:11 rate my pvp skills from 1-10
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 08:39:53 tho i think 3 min is too long to shoot down a bomber
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 08:41:06 maybe ur right? since my f4 is optimized for 550-900
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 08:43:26 i think the metric for plane crazy is m/s due to the fact that mach 1 (343) is where the speedo maxes out so theoretically since my f4 has top speed of 1900, it means my jet is mach 5.5
plane-crazy 2022-12-16 08:46:54 yeah but as i said, i think the metric in this game is m/s
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 06:07:45 can anybody help me, my f4 phantom would fishtail vertically when i reach about 1900 and it would only stop when the speed reaches 300
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 08:31:30 as i said, it would wobble vertical when i reach 1900 and will stop when the speed is 300
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 08:33:08 how to reduce while making it more accurate to a real f4
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 08:34:19 i might do the first
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 08:34:27 and hope it can still lift
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 12:32:51 is 2.34k on a jet slow
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 12:33:18 tho tbf, if i drop the bombs, i can go to 2.56k due to less parasitic drag
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 12:33:58 osprey if u know how to deal with motor 2
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 12:35:07 depends on what?
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 12:35:26 undo it
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 12:35:39 u can get it back assuming u havent left the game
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 12:36:11 weird, it works for me
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 12:38:27 700 m/s is roughly mach 2.04
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 12:38:49 so technically, ive gone supersonic
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 12:39:42 u should have divided it by 343 so u get the mach value (the metric for all supersonic and some subsonic jets)
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 12:40:45 2.34k = mach 2.27
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 12:41:03 idk how to convert studs to meters
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 12:41:14 so i just took ur word for the 700 value
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 12:41:24 ok ic
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 12:42:05 edit: after using ur method, my arispeed in m/s is 780m/s
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 12:42:24 so im going mach 2.27
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 12:43:24 rick prolly too busy dealing with pc2
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 13:50:05 hes made about 4 release dates for pc2 yet no release
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 14:03:06 guys, how do i make a guided bomb without making it look ass
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 14:14:03 ykw, i might just ditch the idea of a guided bomb due to my prototype having a lotta parasitic drag (eats away 1k speed in a sustained turn)
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 14:15:07 altho it can go up to 2.34k, i normally cruise about 1.3-1.8k so it leaves me vulnerable to other high speed jets
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 14:16:53 edit: i made a new design and it only eats away 500
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 14:17:41 but i cant really aim since i got no visual for most of the fall duration
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 14:17:53 tho tbf, its my fault for being legally blind
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 14:18:22 but i cant aim properly that way due to my guided bomb's tendency to roll around
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 14:21:12 i just mounted them externally
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 14:21:16 since its a phantom
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 14:21:27 so no bomb bays
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 14:23:14 i might just mount motors and wings to controll it
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 14:25:17 3 blocks wide b4 it contacts the landing gear
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 14:25:50 tho i cound mount the motors aa bit rearward to clear it
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 14:29:57 tho in the rear, it clears up to about 5
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 14:32:24 how do i make motor 2 mouse controller?
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 14:43:21 very fake!!!!! theres white in the edges of the plane!!!!

plane-crazy 2022-12-17 14:46:44 it proves theres white in the edges in the plane r3tard
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 14:48:14 real!!!!!!

creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:20:34 how to finish this custom jet
creations-chat 2022-12-20 08:22:52 i got the basic airframe done, only need advice on how to do the motorlocked intakes
creations-chat 2022-12-21 09:55:08 ok sure
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 10:30:39 what does count as fast in game here
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 10:30:48 if were talking pvp planes
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 10:40:19 when i ask guys in other plane crazy servers, they give me speeds between the range of 700-1600 tho those speeds feel too slow to me
plane-crazy 2022-12-21 10:41:14 then ig my f4 phantom can be considered fast since it goes at 2.34k-2.6k (depends on the mounted weapons)
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 10:56:48 tbf, iive seen shredders that go 11k so ur not wrong
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 10:57:03 because they suck ass at long term memmory
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 10:57:25 yeah but i havent encountered those myself
plane-crazy 2022-12-22 10:59:22 nah
plane-crazy 2022-12-29 13:40:46 if u mean modding gear ratios via transmission, its possible but a bit finicky due to how goofy moror2 is rn

plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:50:40 rate my shootdown skills
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:50:58 bozo
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:51:23 ig i just suck ass rn in pc
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:51:53 only if u spawned it in
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:52:40 crack house complate with heisenberg
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:54:02 help, my single rotor heli seems to shake and roll uncontrollably once i get airborne
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:57:01 https://streamable.com/y2mdo7
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:57:43 thats the vid i copied from lmao
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:59:34 yes
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 12:59:41 5 speed, 25 drag each
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:00:03 (i saw in the comments that more drag = more stability
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:04:03 its locked
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:04:21 but i noticed that the pitch rotor would overcompensate
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:04:29 and move too far
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:05:02 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:06:56 when its unlocked, its even worse
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:09:04 tho i noticed that when i would use motor 2 to pitch, the overpitching issue doesnt occur
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:11:20 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:11:48 tho i noticed that in motor 1, despite using same settings, the blades would end up in diff position
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:12:02 so idk how tf that happened
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:12:10 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:12:32 0.2 speed, 1k torque for all motors (except the hover drive motors)
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:13:44 theyre already at 2 speed
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:14:03 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:14:28 and overpitching still occurs even if pitch is set under diff keybinds
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:17:14 still shakes due to overpitching
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:17:40 wtf
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:17:57 as i said, they end up in diff locations
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:18:56 no new leaks?
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:19:02 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:19:16 optional?
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:19:22 if so then cool
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:19:38 slowmotion master race ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:20:10 yeah, misaligned
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:20:38 make it a client only thing then
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:20:49 so it looks like slowmotion to him but not u
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:21:24 not really, compute physics at normal speed, artificially slow it down in client and there u go
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:21:52 calling dibs 33-34
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:23:43 i think the physics are computed realtime, artificially slow down in client so as to fix that type of issue
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:24:58 but it would cause server issues
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 13:25:09 and potentially allow for speedhacks n such

plane-crazy 2023-01-01 13:35:11 how the hell do i fix my motor 2 piloting system
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 13:38:22 doesnt want to turn most of the time (barrel rolls a lot)
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 13:38:33 what config should i use
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 13:38:43 y
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 13:39:33 as i said, im converting my wasd jet to a m2m jet
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 13:41:11 since my jet had a tendency to nosedive so i assumed m2m will make it so it will selfcorrect with mouse
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 13:41:27 i dont want to turn my jet into a cheese grater jet
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 13:42:41 i tried using 2 ballast beams in the rear set at max, didnt do anything aside from lowering my speed to 1.9k
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 13:47:07 it works at the expense of heavy vertical wobbling at high speed (past 1.7k)
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 13:57:15 dude ur grammar is balls wth is that meant to mean
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 13:59:01 but fr tho, how to implement m2m using custom control surfaces
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 01:30:08 fuck, some dude in a vomit jet shot down my f4 4 times in a row
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 01:31:14 idk why, even with 90 fps my pplane wobbles vertically when i reach 2.3k
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 01:31:51 wasd
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 01:32:23 motor 2 controlled?
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 01:32:29 with a mouse
plane-crazy 2023-01-12 01:33:18 tried that, lost speed and i wobble at around 1.1k

general 2023-02-06 09:25:41 thats why i ditched the swedish line for the soviets
general 2023-02-06 09:28:15 skill issue
general 2023-02-18 10:07:00 blame rick for building up shittons of hype for pc2 and delaying

plane-crazy 2023-02-26 12:57:40 kinda reminds me of a UAV actually
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 12:57:49 fr?
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 12:57:55 wheres the rotors
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 12:59:57 looks nice if u removed the holes on the hull and vertical stablizer
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 13:00:20 since u finna add the rotrs?
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 13:01:03 use a ballast or helium then
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 13:01:25 add both of them to cancel each other out
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 13:01:38 since with the holes, it looks like shit
