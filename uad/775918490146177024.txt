plane-crazy 2022-03-07 17:50:32 i see
plane-crazy 2022-03-07 17:52:54 i see, that was angle locking, but maybe there was something else for motor locking

plane-crazy 2022-03-07 17:54:37 oh my, wed still be in the stone ages if it werent for them

plane-crazy 2022-03-08 00:16:29 oops
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 00:16:31 srry
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 00:16:33 just some trenches
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 00:19:36 true
creations-chat 2022-03-08 16:32:45 LOLLL
creations-chat 2022-03-08 16:34:52 
creations-chat 2022-03-08 16:36:57 I didn’t say I thought it would brainlet i was just doing an expirment with one of my old builds
creations-chat 2022-03-08 16:41:13 Those are cool builds idk why everybody seems have a heart attack after seeing half a motor head on a build
creations-chat 2022-03-08 16:44:38 What how is the ship bad id like a bit of feedback, plus most of that is heavily subjective also i didn’t say that it was because of the motor lock, I am right when I say that
creations-chat 2022-03-08 16:46:42 I get it now, lol it’s so funny and partly pathetic how toxic this server is because I want to know how to improve my own stuff
creations-chat 2022-03-08 16:49:39 lol but tbh I do t really get offended easily
creations-chat 2022-03-08 16:51:44 What I didn’t get offended :/ idk what you mean XD
creations-chat 2022-03-08 16:56:33 Also this slow mode makes this channel kinda useless……  it’s so hard to exchange ideas when you need to wait like 2 minutes to send a message just for some bot to falsely flag it as ‘spam’
creations-chat 2022-03-08 16:58:35 This is like the most stupid statement I’ve ever heard. Just because I just joined the server and don’t have a different colored name doesn’t really mean anything I’m not taking what your saying as like every white name but it’s honestly just stupid and go cry about it then
creations-chat 2022-03-08 17:00:40 You do realize the build I showed you is the old one I happened to have a photo of on my phone?
creations-chat 2022-03-08 17:02:50 Who said I was getting offended? I really do not get offended in this server lol
creations-chat 2022-03-08 17:04:53 What how is that me getting offended doesn’t me being a white name mean I am new? If so then you don’t understand me at all. Therefore that really does make no sense and the last time I checked about myself I do not laugh when I get offended nor do I get offended at all
creations-chat 2022-03-08 17:07:23 https://tenor.com/view/metal-gear-rising-gif-24388463
creations-chat 2022-03-08 17:09:25 Plus idk why people are so obsessed with being good at the game, I just try my best and have fun with something I enjoy and I am not saying I do not
creations-chat 2022-03-08 17:11:33 Because it’s fun <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-03-08 17:13:45 Nah to be fair I may not be the standard here, but if I keep trying I’ll have something to strive for also thankfully there are some sane ppl in this server like van
creations-chat 2022-03-08 17:15:56 I’m gonna get on my PC now and play trenches and then go on later with my frens
creations-chat 2022-03-08 17:26:19 Lol
creations-chat 2022-03-08 17:28:25 Wait what sit called it’s a super weird tank that looks like a weird little skull I’ll get a photo and name of it 1 sec
creations-chat 2022-03-08 17:31:14 the tortuga tank <@456226577798135808>  OK try doing a bradley fighting vehicle
creations-chat 2022-03-08 17:33:37 or a Pandur II, thatd be cool (i am still here vanq) time to play with 16clampa
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 17:40:05 oh my
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 17:40:13 my ball car would actually work
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 17:41:50 basicly my ball car will be a car that uses ball wheels
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 17:41:57 bhut custom ones that move with conveyors
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 17:42:05 not vanilla ball wheels
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 17:43:33 basiclu, its got a ball that is semi restricted, and is turned via conveyor, which causes the ball to move forward, similar to a sphero and those cool BB-8 robots
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 17:44:17 thats where ig ot the inspiration actually
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 17:44:25 i saw that and wanted to replicate it
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 17:44:55 yes, but theres 1 issue i found with my test, if you go too high the ball falls out, but im sure i can fix that
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 17:45:01 but the test was VERY basic
plane-crazy 2022-03-08 17:45:56 yes, but btw that was just 1 ball, and i didnt configure anything, it was VERY VERY basic and was just to see if the idea was possible
creations-chat 2022-03-08 18:00:25 WIP ball car (just a proof of concept not for looks im trying to make the working parts of it so I can make a good looking ball car without running into unforseen problems) 10 speed, decent turning, gunna fix when the balls fall out
creations-chat 2022-03-08 20:24:37 yeah its weird
creations-chat 2022-03-08 20:44:08 i guess ppl in PC are 2 feet tall then LOL
creations-chat 2022-03-08 20:46:10 maybe use water jets to add an MG somewhere thatd make it look better (I know you didnt ask me srry)
creations-chat 2022-03-08 20:49:26 Because 2 studs tall, 1 stud is 11 inches roughly 2 feet
creations-chat 2022-03-08 20:56:04 i see, but im saying next to the main gun, also howd you do the barrel, I cant seem to replicate it.
creations-chat 2022-03-08 21:00:21 how

creations-chat 2022-03-09 21:32:36 but it makes giving feedback very tedious and then ppl dont use the channel but <#384021699466756107>
creations-chat 2022-03-09 21:38:25 Still tho, it makes the channel unused a lot of the times because you need to wait 2 MINUTES to post a message

creations-chat 2022-03-13 18:56:51 I try to be positive but certain builds just aren’t good like the first tank that dude made was a pretty good start and better than my first tank so I gave it an upvote but that weird green jet isn’t too good and I didn’t upvote it
help 2022-03-13 19:00:59 It works but the problem is that the sides are not blocks where the other things are 3 blocks
bug-reports 2022-03-13 19:02:44 Just move your build up a few blocks then add a dummy block if you can
help 2022-03-13 19:03:00 Bruh the sides and tops are 1 blocks
help 2022-03-13 19:03:06 But the corners are 3

creations-chat 2022-03-21 19:04:46 Hm it doesn’t look realistic the turret seems too larg but isn’t it an E-100 if so it shouldn’t use a Maus turret
creations-chat 2022-03-21 19:10:49 Oh sorry I forgot the E-100 was the tiger maus and i understand that the E-100 never had a turret designed for it
creations-chat 2022-03-21 19:13:50 sorry, but the turret seems to big (cry about it ik it doesnt spin) what wdym the E-100 never had a turret designed for it
creations-chat 2022-03-21 19:16:26 what? the E-100 never had a turret designed for it... and the maus turret was too heavy if your thinking about it, and dont jump to assumptions when I doubt you researched anything and your research is probably just a bullshit war thunder image, end of story, good day.

THE FUCKL?!?!??! i KNOW ITS NOT AN E-100 HE SAID IT WASNT ONE DUMBASS
creations-chat 2022-03-21 19:18:51 I know I heard that and I know its not an E-100 can you guys actually listen to me? and idk what to call the turret if it doesnt turn
creations-chat 2022-03-21 19:20:55 because I thought it was a fictional turret, which makes sense, since I original forgot the E-100 was nicknamed the Tiger Maus, I gotr mixed up with the Jagdtiger, and by 'no turret' I thought he meant that the E-100 never had a turret designed, which was true
creations-chat 2022-03-21 20:05:58 great! possibly fix the blockiness of the... ughh socket I guess where the gun seperates from the casemate by angle locking an extra angle
help 2022-03-21 20:07:03 i cannot seem to do any camera locking right it never moves anything and I watched the tutorial many imes
creations-chat 2022-03-21 20:08:00 ahh, thank you its like nobody ever does it like me, where they say whats wrong and where, and say how to fix it

plane-crazy 2022-03-25 02:01:57 <@!297120728342331392> i didnt say it was WIP, I said it was a placeholder, just because i didnt add everyything in the possible existance doesnt mean its a WIP
plane-crazy 2022-03-25 02:02:14 im gonna get better paint soon, but thats just the current paint I have
creations-chat 2022-03-25 02:02:49 no it isnt you fucktard
creations-chat 2022-03-25 02:05:01 its not WIP, its just a placeholder dumbass
creations-chat 2022-03-25 02:07:37 because I am 'de' means not, so 'pressed' is depressed but your not depressed so Im happy so I am pressed, because I am happy with what I have and I dont need the approval of people on a lego game so give up
creations-chat 2022-03-25 02:15:07 what its finished? and plus just because im constantly expirimenting to find ways to make my stuff better doesnt mean its being worked on, there are no components I actually plane that need working on, and the paint just isnt very good, and I plan on changing it i dont see the problem
creations-chat 2022-03-25 02:17:10 what i didnt ay i think it looks good, and im not going to add anything to the paint, plus i rarely play plane crazy anyway the chances of new paint are extremely slim
creations-chat 2022-03-25 02:19:13 i didnt mean that its WIP, I mean its a placeholder, im sorry youve had so little social interaction you dont understand that

help 2022-03-28 01:51:17 Yes am big moyai
creations-chat 2022-03-28 01:53:18 I agree, I understand your disappealment I can excuse 3 half motors coming from the top because you don’t understand and your new but it doesn’t make sense to have too much
help 2022-03-28 01:55:09 Instead of using 2 motors just use 1
help 2022-03-28 01:55:19 The reason you do 2 motors is because they lock halfway down
help 2022-03-28 01:55:33 So just take advantage of them going halfway down to make it half set
creations-chat 2022-03-28 01:56:10 *silently sits in corner as I am guilty of this slightly*
creations-chat 2022-03-28 01:58:39 I usually only use a single tower which is why it’s easy

creations-chat 2023-06-10 13:52:35 its a shame that its wheels dont turn too
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 13:53:06 <@817301154077474816> lets talk here
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 13:53:23 theres a way to blow off the decals of standard wheels
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 13:53:45 oh
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 13:54:10 so does it use skid steering?
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 13:54:45 unsure
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 13:54:50 its like tank steering but with wheels
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 13:54:57 also you could use motor 2s
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 13:55:06 yes neutral steering then
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 13:55:08 ahh ok
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 13:55:13 try using motor 2s
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 13:55:17 with a rack to allign them
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 13:55:39 ahh k
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 13:57:29 have you tried using motor 2 with an allignment rakc
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 14:01:53 
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 14:01:54 this
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 14:02:09 it stops the motor 2s from wiggling around during driving
the-dump 2023-06-10 14:05:05 i mean if everything worked properly itd probably be a pretty competitive tank
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 14:05:19 k
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 14:05:28 oh i see
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 14:05:44 k

help 2023-06-13 02:02:04 firstly you need the AWACS without the AWACS you cannot guide your missiles, this is very important as SAMs are the backbone of missile defense. rookie mistake to underestimate the AWACS. make sure the AWACS is very protected as well, if you lose it your combat capabilities will collapse.
