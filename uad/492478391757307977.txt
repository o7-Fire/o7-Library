help 2018-12-08 20:50:59 <@336226228681965569> Real rockets have gimble on their engines so that they can control the tilt of the ship. They also have fins on the side for stabilization. Most important thing to remember is that if your rocket tips too far down there is no way to save it. I hope this helps and if you want more details there's always google.

plane-crazy 2019-01-06 18:59:08 Maybe also have guides that keep the drill from going too far on the side
the-dump 2019-01-06 19:02:20 Honestly I'm ok with that. They deserve that for falling for a scam lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:11:00 I think we can all agree that roblox is becoming more and more a site for young gamers. It's sad but if we don't like it, there are other places to go.
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:13:38 Yoko you should be complaining to the people at roblox not any of these guys
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:14:19 Ik me too
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 00:15:40 Is there any way to bring up an issue like this to roblox? Or are we just helpless to their indifference?
