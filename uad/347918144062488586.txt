plane-crazy 2018-12-27 05:02:26 the train is still straight
plane-crazy 2018-12-27 05:02:28 but the tracks arent
plane-crazy 2018-12-27 05:19:12 probably cause you have stuck attached to the tracks

plane-crazy 2019-01-05 16:38:42 Why are there stroke recovery advertisements on a kids game
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 16:38:48 I hope no 8 year old is having a stroke.
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 22:36:53 How do you use the search in a chat?
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 22:41:47 stop asking for gamepasses that involves a plot change
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 22:42:01 Its kind of irritating that you can build more for 5000 robux.
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 22:42:25 lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 22:42:39 the problem is
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 22:42:42 aren't we all poor?
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 22:42:54 BuildIntoPlanes
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 22:43:03 Stop asking for a gamepass
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 22:43:16 I don't think anyone wants a gamepass that changes your build capability
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 22:43:37 Cause no one wants to see rich kids building a star destroyer
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 22:43:41 While we can only build
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 22:43:43 small crap
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 22:43:59 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 22:44:08 Learning to fold is actually interesting
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 22:45:33 please never add a gamepass
plane-crazy 2019-01-05 22:45:40 Unless its for something relevant

plane-crazy 2019-05-11 01:11:02 All it would be is 2 half blocks and a half block 2x wedge

creations-chat 2019-06-11 14:40:51 Didn't Sakura say she wanted people to copy some of her more simple swashplates, as she wants more swashplate helicopters in the servers?
creations-chat 2019-06-11 14:44:05 Then what is wrong with him using one of her swashplates
creations-chat 2019-06-11 14:45:46 "omg i come to you and try say its sakuraswashplade? you add me to black list"
creations-chat 2019-06-11 14:46:25 I think he probably was making a Sakura swashplate, saw another one in the server, and walked over to see which one you were doing.
creations-chat 2019-06-11 14:47:04 Well swashplates are confusing, most people stare to try and understand.
creations-chat 2019-06-11 14:47:49 I am just saying most people with bad spelling and grammar are often mistaken by their weird choices, as most of them are not old enough to realize the awkward things they do.
creations-chat 2019-06-20 04:11:57 which tank are you trying to kickstart?
creations-chat 2019-06-27 21:17:25 the wings

creations-chat 2019-07-02 23:03:27 usually people use those when they use it as a pvp plane
creations-chat 2019-07-02 23:03:50 or when they have no bomb bay space
creations-chat 2019-07-02 23:04:06 but explosive balls dont need to be attached?
creations-chat 2019-07-02 23:04:14 so you could fit more

creations-chat 2019-07-14 22:52:25 the only thing that wouldn't look totally accurate

creations-chat 2019-07-17 14:09:51 what those legs do?
creations-chat 2019-07-31 17:36:41 they probably make half a creation, paint it, leave the game, forget about it, And then realise they spent the first brainstorming hours they needed to finish it
creations-chat 2019-07-31 20:27:59 <@!210141202698338304> what

creations-chat 2019-12-28 16:26:57 I like making tanks its just when the wheels look retarded I delete it
creations-chat 2019-12-28 16:28:49 Try a blueprint from google and use a 3d model from sketchfab and you will notice your building getting better
creations-chat 2019-12-28 16:29:06 Also try thinking of the best block choices before just placing one.

general 2020-03-18 15:36:28 no one thought anything of it but he gets away scott free
general 2020-03-18 15:38:11 i guess lagging a server is worse than copying a creation

general 2020-08-06 22:43:16 when you go high speed with cylinders as wheels it bumps your vehicle
general 2020-08-06 22:43:25 because they arent perfectly round
general 2020-08-06 22:44:51 well when im in a race car or something like that im not on the ground half the time
general 2020-08-06 22:45:35 when you use cylinders as wheels it will feel like your driving on bumps
general 2020-08-06 22:45:42 because cylinders arent perfectly round
general 2020-08-06 22:45:54 nvm
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 23:04:12 will we have a new map?
general 2020-08-10 05:42:32 I bet this game would make more money than innovation Inc if the same effort was given
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 06:04:23 How come adding new blocks like longer wedges is so hard?
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 06:06:00 I just don't get it. Is it the way they have to be implemented?
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 06:06:19 Why add water jet over 5x wedge
plane-crazy 2020-08-10 06:06:30 Seems like water jet is harder to make

general 2020-10-10 17:45:04 so what its breaking records, they could atleast coordinate with roblox so its not as out expense everytime they want to update the game
general 2020-10-10 17:45:56 yeah they hate people for not telling the truth as well why does that matter
general 2020-10-10 17:50:04 if they ever do a christmas update it gonna be at 3 million lol

plane-crazy 2020-11-04 15:58:07 people started using it like a couple months ago but i dont see many people using it still
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 16:03:35 you can make it
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 16:03:37 longer

creations-chat 2020-11-06 01:22:57 aslo why are you gonna put the nose backwards and make the fold weird
creations-chat 2020-11-06 01:25:40 nah just do angling and it will be ez
creations-chat 2020-11-06 13:38:49 Ew droop snoot on a jet????¿¿‽‽¿
creations-chat 2020-11-06 13:53:34 please follow blueprint
And do angling for the neck of the nose because those wedge aren't long enough

*Cause someone doesn't make longer wedges but we don't talk about that*
creations-chat 2020-11-06 13:57:58 It would be better if you just use angling in the bottom and make it so the nose is 3 wide and not 2.
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:01:34 Someone should make an ornythopter
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:06:26 The way wing panels work it might not even be possible

Unless it moves extremely fast like a humming bird or something
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 14:08:29 when will ppl learn to use camera glitch for wings eee
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:10:33 it probably pushes your creation but not enough to actually keep lifting up, when you move wing panels it pushes you but you need to make it so they are flat when you put the wings back so you can flap again cause if you dont it will just fall down the exact way birds do it is impossible though cause their feathers flip mid flap
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:12:14 yeah probably but a lot of motor 2 on servo. also to go forward you will probably need engines or something
help 2020-11-06 14:16:32 tokidaso remove the middle bogie, whatever you do it will not work because the turns on the track are too sharp for this. when you turn on a track it is making the middle of the train come off the track

creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:57:31 why do people think its better to announce there are no locked motors. its like they dont understand how it works so instead they tell themselves its better to not use it????

creations-chat 2020-11-09 14:43:09 imagine posting in a channel where your asking for your build to be judged but you ask why downvote eeee why human brain work like this
creations-chat 2020-11-09 15:03:50 its like a 20 to 10000 ratio for your build to be in hof. Of course you are going to get a no. Just imagine someone gives the best constructural criticism but they get blacklisted cause people dont wanna accept opinions in a channel that its made for. Im not gonna argue in here though cause the mods and admins dont like conversations.

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 00:50:20 when it goes up
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 00:50:23 so its not so much drag
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 00:50:32 but wings already give so much drag that its hard for wings to actually work like irl

creations-chat 2020-12-04 04:13:55 use blueprints a lot, and maybe 3d models from sketchfab if there is any. popular planes like yak 38 have 3d models on sketchfab, doing it by pictures is a good way to get unproportional wings and ect

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:57:13 most of them go like
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:57:15 350 300 sps
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:57:16 max
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:57:22 any jet used for pvp
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:57:27 literally 2x faster than it
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:57:32 they are op against tanks though
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:57:39 but tanks and land vehicles are always gonna be bad at pvp
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:57:45 cause of how weapons work
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:58:10 the only ones that i think are kind of op
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:58:12 are the swarms
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:58:17 but even then its pretty easy to single out the pilot
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:58:20 and just destroy his
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:58:22 then he just respawns
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:58:32 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:58:34 make one of those
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:58:36 dump trucks
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:58:37 the smaller ones tho

creations-chat 2020-12-04 20:14:41 i cannot stress enough

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 20:21:53 stop saying your bad before you post something
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 20:21:57 makes me downvote

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 20:23:08 eventually as in
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 20:23:12 infinite time
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 20:23:28 some people take longer than others to start building well
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 20:24:07 the thing is
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 20:24:13 this game requires creativity
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 20:24:18 and the roblox playerbase is not that good at that
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 20:24:31 which is why even the ads on the site are the same boring ass jokes
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 20:24:41 idk

creations-chat 2020-12-06 19:35:32 people who say they added on to a tutorial are pretty cringe
creations-chat 2020-12-07 14:28:33 the wedge stack on the very front of the nose looks unusual

plane-crazy 2020-12-07 23:20:46 dude asking for something that requires complete recode of the building cause he cant figure out how to do motor lock
general 2020-12-07 23:38:40 the barrel would be gone in 2 shot

creations-chat 2020-12-08 01:52:14 constructive criticism be like
creations-chat 2020-12-08 02:03:37 it makes no sense tbh, they dont even follow blueprint and expect to get praised and they get butthurt instead
creations-chat 2020-12-08 02:36:14 slate looks bad dont use it for the majority of a creation
creations-chat 2020-12-08 14:36:26 whats with the sudden amount of good creations

~~*seems like were finally getting somewhere*~~
creations-chat 2020-12-08 14:55:53 you cant because thats how motor 2 works, if you got motor lock on the end of a motor 2 it will shake 24/7

you can try to balance with ballast blocks on the other side but it will still shake
<@!297988169276719105>
creations-chat 2020-12-08 15:51:45 Just use blueprints so you get the proportions right
creations-chat 2020-12-08 16:13:11 Sketchfab, blueprints ez gg stop building off pictures
creations-chat 2020-12-08 16:45:06 ~~looks awfully unproportionate~~
creations-chat 2020-12-08 17:09:27 the harrier in creations recently have been really sad
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:27:04 someone really wrote a google doc for why toxicity is too much
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 17:27:09 just turn the other cheek this is discord
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 18:18:46 its just gonna turn into people using what you said for instances where people downvote
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 18:18:53 its like every day someone asks 'why do you downvote'
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 18:39:03 If we all just used blueprints and asked 'does this look the same' then it wouldn't be as bad
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 19:09:35 Make a
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 19:10:00 Sukhoi 22
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 19:26:51 just stfu
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 19:27:02 one of the best ships and you got something to complain about
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 19:27:12 one of the best
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 19:27:18 literally what i said
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 19:27:49 your critisizing stuff without a top view
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 19:27:54 spelled that wrong but
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 19:28:18 didnt give a top view and you say its short and stuff
creations-chat 2020-12-08 20:25:11 why not just remove upvotes and downvotes

actually just kill everyone so no one gets mad at eachother

lol your hind got the worst camo in existance
creations-chat 2020-12-08 20:27:18 paint is like 50% of what makes a creation look good

i can determine pro builder from casual builder

do you use blueprints????
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:53:16 i wish i could go back in time and tell mad how much this game will blow up then he would make a good base code
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 20:53:43 ~~jk i would just stop him from making this game~~
creations-chat 2020-12-08 20:54:02 use both because like 10/11 3d models are not accurate to the irl thing
creations-chat 2020-12-08 21:03:46 yeah cause its hard to get pictures of the very back of a mig or something

blueprints dont have lot of detail its just the shape
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:32:23 i know its not possible to get added but that would be sick as fuck to have a working tank crew
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:34:24 maybe redo the cockpits?
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:35:53 oh sorry my fault
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:36:23 maybe just change the window color so its not as blue
creations-chat 2020-12-09 04:44:27 Imagine getting mad at emojis in 2020
creations-chat 2020-12-09 17:00:16 <@!644377285746622494> if your gonna ask why people downvote your heli you are going to be here forever
creations-chat 2020-12-09 18:31:15 <@!644377285746622494> your rotors are not long enough to the irl hind, your rotors dont even produce lift cause they are half blocks

creations-chat 2020-12-10 13:57:15 Nah bruh go delete it
creations-chat 2020-12-10 13:59:37 make tutorials not is what you were trying to say
creations-chat 2020-12-10 14:02:29 Tutorials always felt dirty to me no matter what
creations-chat 2020-12-10 14:05:00 I mean like copying an actual creation not a mechanism

But still it's pretty easy to make mechanism because most on youtube are pretty bad

creations-chat 2020-12-11 22:02:24 100% the wider one is closer, but the tighter one looks better so ye
creations-chat 2020-12-12 03:54:37 except

creations-chat 2020-12-15 01:24:41 why have upvotes and downvotes if people will just get mad when you downvote

just make it upvotes only
creations-chat 2020-12-15 01:27:43 then just @ them and tell them in this channel, then they cant get mad at you
creations-chat 2020-12-15 01:35:40 thats the problem, people dont like seeing how many ppl hate their creation so they beg staff to give them creations blacklist which is just abusing it
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:09:14 you cant teach people how to build lol
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 17:09:23 you can show tips but they gotta get good over time by themselves
creations-chat 2020-12-22 18:24:08 details..
creations-chat 2021-01-02 21:40:46 i like it but the engine is like open and you can see a big empty space inside
really 2 minute slow mode now? the engines are too big for the rest of the ship
creations-chat 2021-01-02 21:42:48 that nose
creations-chat 2021-01-02 21:59:29 it is cool but why fake tracks if its that huge
creations-chat 2021-01-05 19:26:56 I smell the copy

Ye I bet that's what they told buggy92905
creations-chat 2021-01-05 19:29:46 Buggy got his tank copied by 2 different people "inspired by buggy92905"
creations-chat 2021-01-06 17:03:48 Miners vulcan got a crap ton of motors showing but they don't care about that
creations-chat 2021-01-06 17:06:20 depends on what you think is much. dont get me wrong its not bad its just interesting how planes and other creations differ in whether or not they are accepted into hof.
i think motor lock sticking out on planes is worse than on ground vehicles
creations-chat 2021-01-07 03:25:51 Downvotes dont matter anyway the more you draw attention to it the more offended you look. They do nothing unless of course you are aiming for hof requirement or ranks which are also useless
creations-chat 2021-01-07 03:29:06 Just check your play time and creation count that can point out whether or not you have played enough. Otherwise it's just not enough effort
creations-chat 2021-01-08 13:49:28 Those guys on the vehicle looked good at first then I look closer
creations-chat 2021-01-09 07:09:22 downvotes literally dont matter stop babying about it
see this every day @_____ please warn this guy he downvoted my build!1!1
creations-chat 2021-01-09 07:11:42 i thought there was a rule against posting work in progress creations, uh minimod mode activated you gonna warn bro
creations-chat 2021-01-09 07:16:44 that toxic as hell guy is a really good builder believe it or not
creations-chat 2021-01-11 20:28:58 Why do I always fall for it I spent 2 minutes searching for something in that screenshot
creations-chat 2021-01-12 20:49:06 Those wing panels are gonna affect your flying a lot

help 2021-01-29 20:33:26 Looked through the list 10 times now I'm done trying
creations-chat 2021-01-29 21:45:19 a10 def does not have a long cockpit like this or the pointy nose
creations-chat 2021-01-29 21:52:36 some builders just make an ordinary jet but add certain characteristics like the gau or some other thing when really its no where close to the blueprint or pictures even and idk why
creations-chat 2021-01-30 22:24:36 yeah im not even gonna go through the pain to read that
creations-chat 2021-01-30 22:26:39 the one time this rule helps
creations-chat 2021-01-31 00:03:09 A10 suck in modern warfare

People only like cause brt
creations-chat 2021-01-31 00:29:33 Aren't you gonna get warned for using shaders but people still post stuff with them
creations-chat 2021-01-31 00:32:03 Because they exploits
creations-chat 2021-01-31 16:14:01 A fighter bomber is a real thing and it is not called a fomber lol
creations-chat 2021-01-31 19:05:50 How can you be specific if the whole thing has problems about it. Discord staff usually hate opinions lol
creations-chat 2021-01-31 19:08:43 Why be a discord moderator other than having power

So you choose to constantly warn the community about things no one could care about lol
creations-chat 2021-01-31 19:17:55 Yeah I saw where I was wrong but it's a pretty boring thing to do so often with no acknowledgement

You do what you want I just know I would never become a moderator it's just an endless pit
creations-chat 2021-02-02 00:33:12 have fun spending a minute camera locking each time you load lol
help 2021-02-02 00:39:05 did you delete your seat and replace it
help 2021-02-02 00:40:41 did you use the move tool?

creations-chat 2021-02-02 14:19:13 yeah i realized there is a little too many images when it was my 3rd time scrolling down to upvote
creations-chat 2021-02-02 17:14:37 why you post a wip tank destroyer, just post it in creation-feedback and not creations
creations-chat 2021-02-02 17:17:20 idk i think its a wip, you say yourself there is no details and there is no weathering on it yet, and you are asking for feedback as well you could just do that in feedback but it doesnt really matter anyway

its pretty weird for your wheels to be the same color as your hull if thats the final paint
creations-chat 2021-02-02 17:19:42 this reference pic someone gave does not look like the same color
creations-chat 2021-02-02 17:22:06 <@!317833859603496971> yeah thats what it looks like irl but they said they based it off the one from that picture.

also westbrook suck
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 18:56:23 the worst part about ab is the ridiculous spotting for tanks
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 18:56:57 you cant do anything without 10 guys behind you in AB cause they can be behind a rock and see your tank
creations-chat 2021-02-02 19:02:12 
creations-chat 2021-02-02 19:18:29 listen to our great leader mcplaysthis
the-dump 2021-02-03 02:13:29 top 10 pictures taken moments before disaster
creations-chat 2021-02-03 05:26:35 Is it really your fault for a chain if you are the first person in it. You didn't really ask for people to make a chain so.
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 14:10:34 How hard is it to code guns to go farther or will that break the game too
creations-chat 2021-02-03 14:14:18 I liked a10 moderately before I found plane crazy. Now I hate it
creations-chat 2021-02-03 15:22:29 f15 good until i saw the nose
creations-chat 2021-02-03 16:44:25 Holy shit that IS 2 is godlike

creations-chat 2021-02-03 16:54:26 real tracks would have been nice
creations-chat 2021-02-03 16:57:14 that does not really look like its for pvp
creations-chat 2021-02-03 17:00:18 well we all know how hof works ~~rigged~~ very picky with who gets into hof
creations-chat 2021-02-03 17:16:38 its 2 solid colors

creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:10:07 that is like over 20 images, also the last one looks pretty cool
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:32:09 he says anime tank though but he didnt even match the color code for the tank
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:34:54 but does it have interior

so you didnt post interior lol
spaceship guy wanted to post his interior and you get butthurt cause of it
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:37:48 if only discord let you make a photo gallery so when you click on a photo it rotates other photos with arrow buttons or something

yeah a slideshow but it doesnt show till you enable it so people dont have to scroll past a bunch
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:41:38 it sucks cause interiors make stuff a lot better but most creations that have an interior were never shown cause of how many ppl would complain
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:43:44 that kind of looks like the nyx from arma 3
creations-chat 2021-02-03 20:57:15 I wonder what it is

general 2021-02-04 14:49:05 how you divide 100 wrong lol
general 2021-02-04 14:50:26 1+1
general 2021-02-04 14:51:34 low question test/quiz suck because if you get 1 wrong your already getting a shitty grade
general 2021-02-04 14:52:26 whats 420 to the 69th power
general 2021-02-04 14:53:54 420 to the 69th power is literally the same as 420^69 though
general 2021-02-04 14:54:22 🤦
general 2021-02-04 14:59:21 brm 5 feels like they wanna be realistic but they are not
general 2021-02-04 14:59:33 pf does not even try which is fine
general 2021-02-04 14:59:50 helicopter in brm 5 feel terrible
general 2021-02-04 15:02:04 the thing is it takes 2 hits to the body for pf if your using an intervention but there is not an actual vest other than a 6 year old shirt and pants from catalog
general 2021-02-04 15:02:23 they didnt use to have helmets but they still dont die if you hit in head
general 2021-02-04 15:06:36 b17 overmade like a10

creations-chat 2021-02-04 17:49:40 idk why dont you ask him, you are getting mad at MC because he said the word bully, when really hes just quoting what the rafale owner said
creations-chat 2021-02-04 17:51:54 god damn this is so stupid i should just mute this servers pings

literally pulling someone up in dms this is sad im just gonna mute this crap
creations-chat 2021-02-04 18:25:18 you really scrolled up to 2 hours ago for that gif
creations-chat 2021-02-04 19:15:17 this version of soundwave is 10x better
creations-chat 2021-02-04 19:19:20 that version of soundwave will be hard to make transform but as a mech only it looks better
bug-reports 2021-02-04 21:19:22 wait how is he copying it so quickly then
bug-reports 2021-02-04 21:22:04 is that guy lying or is the guy actually able t copy entire creations cause if so rickje need to get on that asap holy
bug-reports 2021-02-04 21:22:44 did it just appear from nowhere
bug-reports 2021-02-04 21:22:48 like instant copy and paste
bug-reports 2021-02-04 21:22:51 bruh
bug-reports 2021-02-04 21:24:07 darkbobby not his main either
bug-reports 2021-02-04 21:26:24 dude just ctrl c and ctrl v
bug-reports 2021-02-04 22:52:38 idk if i should be saying this but the script has been around on v3rmillion and wearedevs since 2019
bug-reports 2021-02-04 22:53:18 most are patched and dont work but the guy in question somehow made another that works
bug-reports 2021-02-04 23:01:21 well obviously its not his main account since the account said it was new
bug-reports 2021-02-04 23:01:33 i dont doubt rickje probably went into that guys dms
creations-chat 2021-02-05 00:01:23 is that a centurion
creations-chat 2021-02-05 13:56:49 Bruh that's like saying all American vehicles since ww2 are the same because they had an American flag on them
creations-chat 2021-02-05 14:15:18 That symbol you are talking about is WW2 Germany's equivalent of an American Battle Flag. So when many people have it in their creation it means that it is a German plane. It is kind of stupid to assume something is a tutorial only based on that.


"Long time ago" as in 1 minute ago.

OH WOW IM SORRY IT WAS 3 MINUTES INSTEAD OF 1 PLEASE FORGIVE ME GREAT LEADER
creations-chat 2021-02-05 14:19:39 So anyway how's the weather

general 2021-02-05 14:35:08 If you ever do slave I it better have the best seismic bomb in roblox
creations-chat 2021-02-05 16:25:02 creations feedback doesnt really work that well cause of slow mode so people just go to <#384021699466756107> to ask for feedback lmao
bug-reports 2021-02-05 18:43:47 i thought something like a copy script would be fairly well known in plane crazy, i didnt even know but the script is the first thing that appears in the google search
bug-reports 2021-02-05 18:44:00 copies everything thats just scary
bug-reports 2021-02-05 18:44:52 its on v3rmillion and wearedevs but im not gonna download it im pretty sure they got virus in them
bug-reports 2021-02-05 18:45:17 i looked at the thread and they were talking about how easy it is to copy creations lmao
bug-reports 2021-02-05 18:45:57 and because there are download links with that script you can basically copy a hof creation, send the link to 10 people, then they load it and have the same thing
bug-reports 2021-02-05 18:46:19 idk there is a preview video where he puts the guys name in a script and it appears on his plot in less than 5 seconds
bug-reports 2021-02-05 18:47:34 this is a good time to maybe give admins kick/ban perms in the actual roblox servers cause it wont take long for people to buy the scripts that still work
bug-reports 2021-02-05 18:49:14 lmao maybe only ban exploiters in-game
bug-reports 2021-02-05 18:49:56 idk if its fairly easy like they said it was then they wont go much out of their way
bug-reports 2021-02-05 18:50:26 but listen there are download links
bug-reports 2021-02-05 18:50:37 imagine some thing in hof getting copied then 10000 players have it
bug-reports 2021-02-05 18:50:43 cause the download link was posted on a yt video
bug-reports 2021-02-05 18:50:54 crazy
bug-reports 2021-02-05 18:51:43 its definitely a reason to start playing on private servers more often lol
creations-chat 2021-02-05 18:56:30 that downforce would make that car a pancake over 200 mph
creations-chat 2021-02-08 14:22:56 How do you steal paint. Guys I own blue and green if you use it im gonna report you
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 14:14:43 gaijin does better communicating with fans than rickje does and THEY ARE RUSSIAN

plane-crazy 2021-02-11 00:27:33 hand held weapons is by far the stupidest suggestion i think ive ever seen in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 14:29:13 your mom
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 14:49:36 no it does help you just mad that people do it better than you
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 14:50:19 i dont think there has been a hof build without motor lock since it started being used
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 14:51:06 idc when you started using it
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 14:51:17 
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 14:54:04 whats the last hof build without motor lock then
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 14:54:13 i just scrolled through and i dont see one without motor lock yet
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 14:54:33 motor lock is one of the only reasons this game has survived this long its most def not 'overrated' bruh
plane-crazy 2021-02-18 15:20:44 just retire plane crazy its not going anywhere
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 13:26:34 rudders are elevated which means they work as elevators too
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 13:26:38 also has thrust vector
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 13:27:18 well argue with the engineers who made it
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 13:27:25 f22 better though since it got chosen for production lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 13:28:29 not a lot of modern fighter jets have air kills
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 13:29:04 a modern attacker probably has 100x more confirmed kills than a fighter
creations-chat 2021-02-23 13:41:59 what

plane-crazy 2021-02-25 18:36:15 people in pcc get so pissed off when you get tank name wrong lol
plane-crazy 2021-03-09 13:46:38 amazing, every word you just said was wrong.
help 2021-03-09 14:48:47 the rotor is not aligned with the center of mass

plane-crazy 2021-05-20 23:20:06 cameras have weight to them right?
bot-central 2021-05-31 00:05:16 !servers
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 03:20:27 what is the sps to mph conversion?
plane-crazy 2021-06-01 03:22:21 nvm i found it in chat logs
plane-crazy 2021-06-11 03:28:05 any of yall know bollard111?
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 02:36:44 is there a reason the game doesnt get any new content?
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 02:40:00 only one man updating the game for 3 years
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 02:40:18 mad hasnt worked on plane crazy for 3 years
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 02:40:28 probably more now
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 02:41:02 just seems like the only things in the past 3 years were trails and sign blocks which made builds more complex
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 02:41:14 that and motor lock and camera glitch which were not intended
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 02:41:19 game feels dead :/
the-dump 2021-06-18 02:12:58 mods been quiet ever since this dropped <:Thinkje139:590548255927173201>
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 23:07:10 did the game just break for anyone else?
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 23:07:17 every creation in the server disappear?
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 20:47:30 is a race track confirmed on new map?
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 20:47:50 kind of pointless to make fast cars if they can only go in circles on baseplate
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 20:48:49 congrats you lost a chunk of the plane crazy playerbase
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 20:49:03 ok bye rickje's 5000 robux a month
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 21:26:16 there is a reason rickje makes gamepasses
plane-crazy 2021-07-20 21:27:19 this payment doesn't come from thin air.
bot-central 2021-07-20 21:29:51 !servers
general 2021-08-19 20:57:32 rickje how much bigger will the new map be, like 1:2 of the current map?
general 2021-08-19 20:58:21 no memes in general
general 2021-08-19 20:58:45 
general 2021-08-19 21:00:43 infinite is not possible tho
general 2021-08-19 21:01:05 maybe in minecraft cause it keeps generating but not roblox
general 2021-08-19 21:01:28 yea i want that too but its never gonna be infinite
general 2021-08-19 21:01:35 yea the worst feeling is flying over the map in 10 seconds
general 2021-08-19 21:01:55 3x size with water all around then it would be good
general 2021-08-19 21:02:30 then use low graphics settings?
general 2021-08-19 21:03:20 would like to see a race track
general 2021-08-19 21:03:43 ye the airport rn is small as hell
general 2021-08-19 21:04:15 race track, airfield, maybe rally stage type trail like the one that goes to the ramps over the rails
general 2021-08-19 21:06:50 yes and its common courtesy to ping mad as well
general 2021-08-19 21:12:06 plots bigger plots or no?
general 2021-08-19 21:12:36 sir rickje bigger plots or no?
general 2021-08-19 21:13:43 when you say infinite map do you just mean water in all directions?
general 2021-08-19 21:14:25 decals would be cool
general 2021-08-19 21:14:50 explosive cylinder
general 2021-08-19 21:15:40 hey man i know you love adding gamepasses with robloxs library so like decal block?
general 2021-08-19 21:16:55 pvp weapons that arent weak?? gun is useless rn
general 2021-08-19 21:17:21 its really not, all 10 guns suck its too slow to kill
general 2021-08-19 21:18:04 send a gif dumb ass saying skill issue is boring
general 2021-08-19 21:19:43 ye it happens in a bunch of games plus how would you like to get kicked in the middle of building and losing your progress cause someone wanted to meme you
general 2021-08-19 21:23:01 i dont think that will ever work no matter how hard you try roblox physics is just not good enough
general 2021-08-19 21:24:33 great way to make the game die
general 2021-08-19 21:24:55 game will still die
general 2021-08-19 21:25:36 
general 2021-08-19 21:26:10 rickje
general 2021-08-19 21:26:17 rickje map leak ?
bug-reports 2021-08-22 22:24:06 my plot is the same plot as another guy
bug-reports 2021-08-22 22:24:10 he and i can build in the same plot
bug-reports 2021-08-22 22:24:14 when i spawn my stuff spawns
bug-reports 2021-08-22 22:24:20 when his stuff spawns it doesnt effect me
bug-reports 2021-08-22 22:24:25 but were literally in the same plot
bug-reports 2021-08-22 22:24:46 
bug-reports 2021-08-22 22:25:22 
bug-reports 2021-08-22 22:26:11 
bug-reports 2021-08-22 22:26:19 idk what the fuc kis going on
bug-reports 2021-08-22 22:30:32 i introduce to you the first whitelisted build ever
creations-chat 2021-10-12 23:51:35 the one in hof isnt that good imo
creations-chat 2021-10-13 11:53:26 It's not idk what you want me to say lol
the-dump 2021-10-18 03:16:15 <@565376886843244544> Chile man look in the gc toad
creations-chat 2021-11-25 23:52:29 Cool lightning but why wing like that, nose can't really be fixed but wings arent looking 1:1 bro
creations-chat 2021-11-26 00:13:52 Red tops
creations-chat 2021-11-26 00:33:17 You should overlay it on a blueprint
creations-chat 2021-11-27 06:26:29 hes saying your landing gear is tall as fuck
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 17:17:29 nothing compared to your mother
creations-chat 2021-11-30 20:25:16 lol thats like trying to make a regular f16 with a block 50 model on sketchfab
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:25:51 pretty sure thats a mig28
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:33:53 wow a custom that isnt dog shit
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:42:48 thats the point of a custom
can literally do whatever you want like a tail rotor on something that wouldnt have it, supposed to be an mi-8 and an osprey, they took the wings and tail from the osprey but kept the tail rotor
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:45:10 i dont think it needs to be believable, as for the weapons its nothing more than what an mi8 can actually carry
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:47:49 if were really bringing realism into a roblox build... if you have thicker supports its gonna end up weighing more which impacts how it flies, vtols using rotors can already barely lift themselves up while fully loaded irl, and if you did have the means to make a vtol in an apocalypse isnt it safe to assume you would also have some high quality metal?
creations-chat 2021-11-30 22:54:12 https://tenor.com/view/sad-pablo-lonely-alone-gif-12928789 a good f14
creations-chat 2021-11-30 23:13:13 the body is literally an mi8 bruh
creations-chat 2021-11-30 23:20:52 he said what the 2 aircraft were, the vertibird's proportions arent even close, nothing even looks similar except the placement of the engines
creations-chat 2021-11-30 23:23:26 i think your getting ahead of yourself
creations-chat 2021-11-30 23:25:53 tootipoodi comes in, says it doesnt look apocalyptic, doesnt elaborate on what that is supposed to be, chunk says fallout is what apocalyptic is supposed to look like, que the monkey brawl
creations-chat 2021-12-01 00:09:34 all of you are continuing🐒

lol been arguing over an hour
<@!738064035135750224> your the one continuing it the most lol, dont ask 'who'
creations-chat 2021-12-01 01:22:27 your proving you have self esteem issues, just drop it he already said he was in the wrong lol
creations-chat 2021-12-01 14:20:42 Nah the wing is fine a lot of 4th gens have used wings similar to it, namely a lot of European jets, viggen, gripen, typhoon, Rafale
creations-chat 2021-12-01 20:13:37 if it gets hof after a bunch of malding children argued in here for an hour about it lol
creations-chat 2021-12-01 20:15:53 yeah its got a lot of problems i only upvoted cause i like the idea, hof isnt as easy anymore
creations-chat 2021-12-01 20:30:00 no it hasnt gotten an upvote yet all downvotes
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:31:20 wings are mini parachutes, cause more drag than everything except the parachute block
plane-crazy 2021-12-01 20:31:30 a few wing panels can lower your top sps by like 50 or more
creations-chat 2021-12-01 22:30:57 the more you talk chunk the harder it is to not hate you
you keep acting like your over them because they insult you but it seems that you like it because all you can do is entice them so far lmao
creations-chat 2021-12-02 20:20:31 side skirts should be 2 wide and the very front of the hull isnt flat its a wedged point
creations-chat 2021-12-02 21:18:32 better, if you have trouble with proportions then maybe try using blueprints or overlay a blueprint onto a screenshot of your tank
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 00:07:02 why use your main to exploit, its a script so they can use it on as many alts as they want
creations-chat 2021-12-03 17:51:19 Why does she have to be 27...... What details did you add
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 20:39:54 pistons have been broken since forever and dont work for the things people actually wanna use them for 🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2021-12-03 20:46:02 the canopy is literally the least of the problems look at the wings ...
creations-chat 2021-12-03 21:06:29 the angled part that is behind the intake i can understand why you did awful on that if you dont know how to angle but on the very outer part of  the wing you didnt even try to make it accurate
creations-chat 2021-12-03 22:06:46 you can just put overlap control surfaces in 1 spot with motor lock
or motor lock a normal wing panel over the cheese grater wing
creations-chat 2021-12-04 00:26:34 why dont pixel art people use motor lock to make a canvas thats bigger than 1 plot
creations-chat 2021-12-04 00:50:16 bruh use the snip tool we dont need to see your entire desktop
creations-chat 2021-12-04 20:53:53 the tail isnt long enough, usually bombers like b29 need folds to get the right length, b17, b52 all need folds
theres videos on how to fold creations you basically just need to a fold a cylinder till its at the right length and then make the tail
plane-crazy 2021-12-04 21:07:51 he dont read it
creations-chat 2021-12-05 08:50:13 Brain not big enough to think about using it 🗿
plane-crazy 2021-12-05 23:38:52 looks cool
creations-chat 2021-12-05 23:59:23 is that a model kit cover
creations-chat 2021-12-06 20:20:04 it looks like a pile of shit
creations-chat 2021-12-06 20:46:48 this is literally like 10 blocks high at most if doing roscale lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 01:54:56 ye but which one looks like shit with 10 motors sticking out
creations-chat 2021-12-07 02:03:48 why make it boxy if your gonna use that much motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:05:50 1 block is 1 meter i think
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:05:56 but if you judge it off roscale then its less i think
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:06:17 a roblox avatar is 5'1
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:06:29 2 blocks is how tall avatar is
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:06:48 yea
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:06:55 but thats only if you base it off how big the characters are
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:07:03 i think i heard rickje or mad say that 1 block = 1 meter
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:07:25 most things are
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:07:46 the only stuff thats usually never roscale is big ships
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:08:34 what is the sps to knot conversion then
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:10:54 i think plot is 50x50 width
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:10:57 or around 50x50
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:11:00 i forgot what it actually is
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:12:10 mach 1 is 1100 sps, if using the stud counter
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:12:19 so everyones jet is really going as fast as a p51 lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:13:00 you made the bottom 25 blocks wide wtf
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:14:41 why does he even wanna use custom angle like that
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:14:51 people make the front of blimps without it all the time
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:15:44 this is from 2019 by some guy who isnt even in the server anymore
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:15:51 literally the exact same size as your blimp
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:16:01 if you dont even know what motor lock is then just do this shit
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:16:29 what
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:16:42 your hopeless
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:16:47 talking to a brick wall
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:17:54 A BLIMP AND BALLOON ARE THE SAME
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:18:05 its literally a few definition difference
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:18:08 its the same exact thing
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:18:13 its categorizing difference not actual shapes
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:19:46 the name of the game is zeppelin war?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:20:08 then why is he insisting its a balloon
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:20:18 a zepplin is a militarized blimp
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:21:16 the whole thing is a zeppelin tho
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:21:19 you dont call it a balloon
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:22:32 zeppelin came from germans making blimps combat capable 🤷‍♂️
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:23:25 not really its not even big enough to fold
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:25:50 <@!792540918867165224> can you just do this but adjust wedges so its not as pointy, literally so easy just be quiet already bro
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:27:04 its not a balloon tho
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:27:10 the game is called zeppelin wars
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:27:51 hes trying to a build a zeppelin from a game called zeppelin wars, getting mad when people call it a zeppelin and he corrects them by saying balloon so
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:29:31 🐒
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:30:26 my god
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:30:45 doesnt even say what words are bad it just warns you
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:30:46 like
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:30:47 fuck?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:31:24 shredders suck
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:31:26 its the floating boxes
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:31:28 that are annoying
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:32:42 they are boxes that travel in all directions
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:32:46 have every weapon
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:32:48 fly like a ufo
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 02:32:57 no wing panels either so they just kind of zoom around at 1000 sps
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 21:35:47 building good in plane crazy and being good in blender is very different
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 21:35:55 but then again this game is just making blocks
creations-chat 2021-12-08 02:47:09 🐒
creations-chat 2021-12-08 02:50:09 does the nose actually droop that'd be sick
creations-chat 2021-12-08 02:54:08 cool
creations-chat 2021-12-08 12:31:50 All shredders are tutorials it's the same as people who post tutorial and say 'i modified it'
creations-chat 2021-12-08 20:15:57 tbh i hope pc2 keeps the exact same building mechanics, it would suck to turn into astrocraft where it takes 10 days just to make a jet
what we need is more wedges and blocks like triangle wedges and it'd be fine
creations-chat 2021-12-09 01:40:16 is that a custom based off the b2 or a b2 cause proportions are wrong and intake isnt right
creations-chat 2021-12-09 02:06:36 shaders get you banned tho so whats the point
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 02:09:14 the zebra battle bot is smart, all paint your bot to zebra and the tryhards will be confused on which 1 they are attacking
plane-crazy 2021-12-09 02:15:03 black body with white stripes

creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:50:59 Yo mod mute him before another paragraph goes up I feel like a 6th grade English teacher reading creation-feedback
creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:53:13 Too long didn't read pretty sure it was you being mad again anyway let's see this ban
creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:55:27 Ping in plane crazy chat if you wanna give feedback this channel is always some idiots arguing
creations-chat 2021-12-09 04:57:28 Things seen before death

creations-chat 2021-12-09 05:01:43 That was some peak trolling
creations-chat 2021-12-09 05:04:01 I don't know I think some of the stuff he said wasn't that stupid but he wrote it in paragraphs so it's the perfect opportunity to make him pissed
creations-chat 2021-12-09 12:26:56 If anything the wings look too big with the way you overlayed it lol
Overlay it with the wings bring proportionate and then the fuselage is too thin
creations-chat 2021-12-09 21:41:46 why is there like 20000 screenshots for 1 creation
creations-chat 2021-12-09 21:43:48 its a screenshot dump, i see people apologize for only 3 images you have over 10, if you cant show it all in a reasonable amount then dont
creations-chat 2021-12-09 21:51:18 theres nothing worse than making fun of someone cause of their grammar when english isnt their native language, i would love to see him curse you out in turkish and you would have no clue what he is saying, dude knows more languages than probably half the server

creations-chat 2021-12-11 18:56:38 ok then. sure
phantom is just an example anyway, can look at a bunch of different f series fighters and they do this on a lot of them
creations-chat 2021-12-11 19:01:08 i dont really care about that, he saying it being non aerodynamic when in lots of planes do this anyway
creations-chat 2021-12-11 19:03:15 they are planes, that go forward, air hits them in the same direction, what are you even trying to say lol
creations-chat 2021-12-11 19:05:25 damn i didnt know 50 years changed the way the laws of physics work
creations-chat 2021-12-12 03:14:59 you forgot most shredder users are idiots who click the highest viewed videos for their shredder tutorial which is also some of the oldest ones
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 03:32:03 🤨
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 03:32:24 "cant be a huey or a plane"
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 03:32:30 build m60 or m163 spaa
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 03:33:57 m48a3 patton, mbt used in vietnam
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 03:34:14 this is wrong btw
creations-chat 2021-12-12 03:44:07 imagine sweating in plane crazy pvp
creations-chat 2021-12-12 16:31:14 cool godzilla but the eyes look a little derpy lol
creations-chat 2021-12-12 16:33:43 your right the eyes look like googly eyes
general 2021-12-12 16:39:22 land like star wars slave 1, or do backflip and landing gear come from the top
creations-chat 2021-12-13 04:45:57 They say white name like it's a class system or something, when in reality ranks don't mean shit lol
creations-chat 2021-12-13 17:34:27 The body on that javelin is good but wings bad, not just the how thick wings are but like the tail isnt the right angle
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 20:56:53 outlines are classic but builds look better without them lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 20:57:39 idk builds just look less realistic with outlines
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:00:16 i remember when outlines were being removed there was talk about them staying visible in build mode only but i guess that didnt happen
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:00:54 replicas require more skill 😎
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:01:21 i feel dead when building customs so i always delete them
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:01:44 customs just make everything easy cause if you dont like the way it looks just make it differently lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:02:12 a lot of cool people got banned from pcc tho
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:02:20 then stopped playing cause of that
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:03:06 i mean, the game doesnt get updated, attention spans only last so long till they get bored
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:04:05 shredder bugs are easy
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:04:11 go over 500 sps and they wont ever get you
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:04:31 and if your in anything but a plane or super fast heli your gonna be shit on by everything
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:04:44 ground stuff just isnt good in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:04:57 tracking rockets..
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:05:31 still tho, the plane can just turn around till you die
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:05:58 hitting planes while on the ground is hard because your guns dont go far because lack of speed and rockets dont go fast cause your stand still
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:06:19 old pcc was fun
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:06:23 you basically knew everyone
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:07:34 maybe ive just not typed in this discord for awhile but i see new names every day
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:08:19 do people pvp in vip1
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:08:28 might be better than a bunch of brain dead shredders
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:09:26 whats so scary about knowing your IP tho
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:09:28 what are you gonna do?
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:09:32 search my entire neighborhood
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:09:49 still not that scary tbh
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:10:14 lego game player gonna road trip to my country/state and run up on me cause i exploded him in lego game
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:10:59 yea but all of them 12 years old with no funds
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:11:06 and where they gonna contact those services anyway
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:11:16 k thats different
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:12:18 unde, ban
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:12:44 so your from the future
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:12:55 did plane crazy 2 come out yet
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:14:44 im from old pcc
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:14:52 who here from 2018
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:14:53 or earlier
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 20:12:00 sparkler is really useful lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 20:12:25 you guys see the block emit some random shit and write it off as useless but its literally a smaller cylinder used in so many different creations
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 20:12:47 who cares
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 20:12:51 lol pvp
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 20:12:58 why use anything other than rockets and motor lock bombs
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 20:13:00 pvp is stupid
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 20:13:38 fireworks wouldve been good if they did similar damage to rockets, didnt have such a short distance and the velocity was faster than rockets
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 20:15:08 pooping in school is a skill issue, hold it till you get home
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 20:15:27 L
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 20:16:42 sparklers would look cool as part of afterburner with trails but the particles drop
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 20:17:22 nah just put trails
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 20:17:26 takes like 4 at least
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 20:17:43 they do tho
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 20:18:00 thats irrelivant lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 20:18:02 no way to fix that
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 20:18:13 every particle in game will do that
creations-chat 2021-12-14 22:23:38 just remove them for the picture
creations-chat 2021-12-15 03:47:10 Not a single person has upvoted, it's not even that bad lol
creations-chat 2021-12-15 12:25:16 Trails
creations-chat 2021-12-15 14:10:43 Nothing like seeing someone put too much effort into edits and not enough into the builds and getting downvoted bombed
creations-chat 2021-12-15 14:20:31 Too much effort is editing the photo, just take a normal picture, people with all these green screen edit shit just make the build look worse imo
creations-chat 2021-12-15 20:22:34 is that really 4000 blocks? looks more like 1000-2000 tbh
creations-chat 2021-12-16 14:42:40 Imagine using light mode on mobile discord and running out of battery 1500% faster 🗿
creations-chat 2021-12-16 14:49:35 There's literally 0 reason to use light mode except wanting to feel special and that's just facts bro
creations-chat 2021-12-16 22:08:22 so many people make roombas they are just cylinders that move lmao
creations-chat 2021-12-17 01:17:06 Get a color dropper extension then use it on the color your trying to get from a Google image
creations-chat 2021-12-18 04:53:04 just tell him to remake the entire thing bruh
creations-chat 2021-12-18 05:57:21 hes right its bad suspension, doesnt dampen just kind of looks like it is but in reality your ass would be crack in half by the time you stopped
creations-chat 2021-12-18 18:46:17 i feel like building this in a roblox game isnt really a memorial
creations-chat 2021-12-18 18:49:28 shut up just delete it and move on your obviously stupid and trying to get upvotes

and the thing is its not even the real memorial, you made the twin towers, like bro? and just did it in the middle of december, couldve made the memorial pools where they stood on 9/11 for an actual memorial even if its just some dumb ass kid in a roblox game
creations-chat 2021-12-18 18:51:55 imagine dying in the biggest plane crash involved terrorist attack and 20 years later some kid builds the event in a roblox game made for 8 year olds to get green arrows 🤦‍♂️
i can feel the respect👌
creations-chat 2021-12-18 18:55:01 its not even that horrible if you made it for yourself, but you decided to post it into creations, couldve posted it in another channel where you dont get upvotes
just use your brain for 5 seconds and see whats wrong with this
creations-chat 2021-12-19 14:09:58 Don't be a shit head to people asking for feedback and it wouldn't be a problem 🗿
creations-chat 2021-12-19 14:30:35 'gorilla' warfare
dude actually trained with real gorillas lmao
creations-chat 2021-12-19 21:22:30 make it a real vehicle instead of it sliding on the ground
why do people like small scale so much
why do upvotes matter
creations-chat 2021-12-24 02:40:13 ☂️
creations-chat 2021-12-25 21:26:58 it look clean but also looks so inaccurate to the irl a5 at the same time
creations-chat 2021-12-25 21:29:06 its still unproportionate, there are some twin stick versions where the cockpit is very close to the intake but its still not long enough to pass for that
creations-chat 2021-12-25 21:38:10 it works but like why? just make a normal mbt you weird scandinavians
creations-chat 2021-12-26 15:31:48 putting it on max graphics for a screenshot isnt gonna do anything bad
creations-chat 2021-12-26 15:34:27 shaders suck, roblox is already horribly optimized so putting on shaders is just gonna give you fps under 144
only matters if you have a 144hz monitor tho
plus they honestly look like shit
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 17:02:11 its cause half cylinders arent as round as the full cylinder
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 17:02:20 you cant see it but its less round
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 17:02:34 try going fast on a normal 3x3 cylinder then add a half cylinder onto it and you bounce a lot more
creations-chat 2021-12-26 17:03:47 he is making a joke about how damn unoriginal a chernobyl build is, especially ones that are mini size
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 21:15:00 is that game still on roblox
plane-crazy 2021-12-26 21:16:07 theres a lot of different locks
creations-chat 2022-01-06 20:38:00 if  you look closely its actually awful but people see camo and upvote
whats with the yellow lettering every block?
creations-chat 2022-01-06 20:58:20 thats not an f4 in the first place bruh

creations-chat 2022-01-06 21:24:15 
creations-chat 2022-01-07 19:35:16 the f15 intakes are a ramp, they actually move up and down at different angles, that angle you are copying is the angle it has when its taking off, its actually almost 90 degrees forward on the top when at high speed
i would do the angle it has when its actually flying cause its gonna look weird when comparing it to an f15 actually flying
creations-chat 2022-01-07 19:37:56 do you not see the difference of the ground picture and the in flight one?
https://i.imgur.com/gZYTyfY.png
creations-chat 2022-01-07 19:41:27 i mean it doesnt really matter i just think the one thats retracted looks really weird when flying, high AOA means air is gonna come from a lower angle so the intakes face down when taking off
just do what you think looks best i guess
creations-chat 2022-01-07 19:58:21 dude made a plane in a plane game and hes mad because it has a history behind it, not like the japanese put chinese heads on the pykes of their guns or the us massacred millions, but whatever...
creations-chat 2022-01-07 20:12:31 i wonder if there has ever been a moment on the internet when someone said that and it actually worked
creations-chat 2022-01-09 15:45:34 
creations-chat 2022-01-11 14:21:09 Detail is eh but that burj kalifa is actually pretty huge
creations-chat 2022-01-12 03:09:03 so there was no message to begin with?
creations-chat 2022-01-12 20:45:42 its a replica
what is he supposed to add???
creations-chat 2022-01-20 06:18:23 That delorean is epic
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 00:31:49 cause wing panels dont work like real wing panels
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:28:10 Wow those winter wheels that are made by the game sure are some high tech designs👌
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:30:22 If your suspension works with downforce then your going too slow
creations-chat 2022-02-18 19:03:19 Put a ruler Google extension, measure wheel size in picture and the space in-between then do same with ingame blocks, or just eyeball it
creations-chat 2022-02-27 18:19:44 theres more than 1 drop tank load for an f16, these are 600 gallon ones, how are those too small lol
creations-chat 2022-03-01 01:02:50 thats like 1 block every 10 minutes, dude is 6 block/hour
6 bph
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:13:13 😎
creations-chat 2022-03-08 00:57:37 bro didnt unbind the trails to turn his lights on
creations-chat 2022-03-08 00:59:50 thats just weird
creations-chat 2022-03-16 22:40:16 yall both seem stupid trying to prove whos right in a lego discord🐒
contest-chat 2022-03-16 22:46:33 its literally a used chasis all over the world he can add a gun and it will easily fit
contest-chat 2022-03-16 22:48:01 the definition doesnt really work he could just make it an m163 which is an spaa not an ifv
contest-chat 2022-03-16 22:48:10 m901 too but thats not an ifv either
contest-chat 2022-03-16 22:50:49 that looks like a 50 cal
contest-chat 2022-03-16 22:50:58 or even less caliber tbh
contest-chat 2022-03-16 22:51:11 definition for this contest is broken anyway not all ifv have 20mm or higher
contest-chat 2022-03-16 22:52:04 there are ifv that dont use 20mm tho
contest-chat 2022-03-16 22:52:08 and no missiles either
contest-chat 2022-03-16 22:52:17 they call it an ifv tho
contest-chat 2022-03-16 22:53:03 its one thing for him to not even have a gun but even if he added a 50 cal it wouldnt count
contest-chat 2022-03-16 22:54:28 idk theres brdm 2 variants that had AT missiles would you consider that an apc still
contest-chat 2022-03-16 22:54:39 cause brdm 2 was a recon apc
contest-chat 2022-03-16 22:55:38 only reason i care about that one is cause its actually good
contest-chat 2022-03-16 22:56:18 there was a truck with a missile launcher and people were saying its not an ifv so idk
contest-chat 2022-03-17 00:02:58 theres too many definitions of ifv, they are using the dictionary definition but the UN and US army have different versions
m901 doesnt count cause it doesnt transport troops
contest-chat 2022-03-17 00:03:31 and why does no one in this discord turn off ping when replying god
contest-chat 2022-03-17 16:59:46 Lol m113 got in cope
contest-chat 2022-03-17 19:07:31 Cheating or forgetting and being allowed by mods to go in contest
contest-chat 2022-03-17 19:08:05 Ifv and apc are almost interchangeable anyway
creations-chat 2022-03-18 01:04:07 hmm, the colored version of the maus got more downvotes 🤨
contest-chat 2022-03-19 00:10:35 Eh not really, WW2 offers a lot of variety
It's just a lot of people will do Tunguska, Gepard, Shilka and other basic spaa
contest-chat 2022-03-19 00:28:19 Why wouldn't they be allowed
contest-chat 2022-03-19 00:28:30 Self propelled anti air
contest-chat 2022-03-19 00:28:54 That can be a m42 or a big type 92
contest-chat 2022-03-19 00:29:57 Really just went from ifv to spaa
contest-chat 2022-03-19 00:30:03 Nice
creations-chat 2022-03-19 00:31:07 The f15 spine isn't even that big
The angle you did it at is wrong tho
contest-chat 2022-03-19 01:48:53 Will the F22 be allowed (self propelled anti air)
contest-chat 2022-03-19 02:13:13 I made an aim9 sidewinder because it propels itself for the purpose of shooting an aircraft down
creations-chat 2022-03-19 02:56:54 Cause the 2nd one is an F22 and F35 posted together
creations-chat 2022-03-19 11:57:50 Dangerous amount of monkeys above, discard all bananas before entry🐒 🐒
creations-chat 2022-03-19 19:52:11 You should remake it but bigger
contest-chat 2022-03-21 23:39:46 Gonna put a CWIS on a grounded f22 and call it spaa
creations-chat 2022-04-01 21:00:47 wow you really dont want to be identified as white🗿
creations-chat 2022-04-02 18:37:40 if you calculate it by sps to mph your gonna get a smaller scale than roscale and other people say 1 block = 1 meter but thats a horrible scale if your gonna make a plane with it, robloxians would be 2 meters tall by that measure but roblox wiki says they arent it says they are 1.4 meters tall so idek
contest-chat 2022-04-21 22:12:34 the cowboy bebop one 💯
creations-chat 2022-05-14 18:44:12 the f-15 intake angle in creations is what it looks like when its engines are off, its not even that high of an angle at mach 2 lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 20:44:41 lol war thunder is adding f-14 while russia still uses mig-23 and italy uses an f-104
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 20:44:49 2nd gen f-104 vs 4th gen f-14
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 20:45:00 gaijin is worse than ea

contest-chat 2022-06-10 21:06:41 and how did the last have a winner with -76 upvotes
creations-chat 2022-06-10 21:41:27 yo mama is gay
creations-chat 2022-06-16 22:23:21 f15=air force landing gear, non tilted rudders, intake on the side of the plane with a moving ramp, f-18 intake is static and is underneath the wing under the fuselage, and the engines were tuned for different jobs entirely, one is legit a multirole and the f-15 was a pure interceptor, f-15e is even more different
creations-chat 2022-06-16 22:26:51 f-22 isnt multirole, better to compare f-35 to rafale, f-35 is legit the best 5th gen tho so good luck
creations-chat 2022-06-17 03:44:10 f-35 is a better air to air platform than every 4th gen you can name, and the f-35 is better than the f-22, the f-22 is not multirole, it cannot do SEAD or DEAD, or CAS
the f-22 is barely better than the f-35 in air to air fights which is not as important for a multirole jet when you need to do a lot of other things, you dont consider range, payload, operating cost or if it can be used on a carrier etc
its a fact that the f-35 is planned to be upgraded into 2070 and 3000+ are planned to be built, meanwhile f-22 is on its way out after only served in 1 branch in 1 country
creations-chat 2022-06-17 03:46:36 lmao do you really think a dogfight determines a planes worth? the avionics in the f-35 is a lot better meaning it wins the bvr fight, both of them have the same missiles and the f-35 radar is better, who cares about which wins in a turn fight lol?
if you looked at the f-35 trials in different countries you would see that they get scored on lots of different things
f-22 is too classified? why do they sell f-35 in other countries tho? it is the more advanced aircraft? its because f-22 wasnt made as an export plane so it will be retired with nothing to show for it
creations-chat 2022-06-17 03:50:34 really? f-35 uses the successor to the f-22 radar, its radar is more advanced
its range is farther
IRST systems in the f-35 are a lot more advanced the f-22
the f-35 program is around 15 years newer
the helmet mounded display on the f-35 is so much more advanced
<@221487880487436288> we actually do cause of red flag excercises and public trials revealed from countries looking to buy f-35
creations-chat 2022-06-17 03:53:03 the notion that the f-35 program is a failure is hilarious since it will be the most abundant combat aircraft in the world succeeding the f-16 as the most abundant
if you still think f-22 > f-35 then just read this https://www.quora.com/Will-the-F-35-be-more-advanced-than-the-F-22-Raptor
creations-chat 2022-06-17 03:57:43 i dont know how its much better in air to air, its a situational aspect of this in the first place
im bringing strike cause you can't call the f-22 better by just talking about air to air, multi roles are becoming more abundant because theres no point buying 3 different planes when you can just buy 1 that does all 3 jobs
its not just that we export a lot we are also replacing our own airforce, navy and marines planes with the f-35, harriers will be phased out soon in the marines with f-35 as replacement
bottom line is if your some european country looking for a jet to buy your gonna be buying the f-35 and use it for years to come meanwhile f-22 will be retired lol
creations-chat 2022-06-17 04:01:11 lockhead martin literally said themselves that the rcs of the f-35 from the front is smaller than the f-22
and maneuverability? really f-35 is incorporating aim-9x that can turn 180 degrees before pursuing the target because of the 360 degree irst, why turn 1 degree/sec faster if your aim9x will already be killing the target
the f-35 has the better radar anyway
the bvr is at this point tied
if you ignore bvr the f-35 wins in every other category so yeah🤷‍♂️
creations-chat 2022-06-17 04:03:29 surprised we havent been warned yet i think all the mods are asleep
creations-chat 2022-06-17 04:06:23 f-35 carries all its weapons internally so it will have no drag in the dog fight, the f-16 will
not to mention their engine thrust difference, the f-35 engine is the most powerful fighter jet engine ever made
the only difference between f-35a and c is landing gear, tail hook and bigger wings it wont change much
creations-chat 2022-06-17 04:08:38 well im actually talking about stuff on paper this guy is just pulling stuff from his ass
its midnight now im going to bed
creations-chat 2022-06-17 12:58:37 the dude answering the question is a college graduate i think hes more knowledgeable than a professional plane crazy player
creations-chat 2022-06-17 13:06:30 hes a physics graduate, talking about physics
dude...
creations-chat 2022-06-17 13:08:46 ok
creations-chat 2022-06-17 13:12:49 the question was which plane is more technology advanced, he lists all the avionics systems the f-35 has over the f-22, he uses actual sources not just stuff from his ass so idk what to tell you
i think you just wanna argue
cant believe i went to sleep, woke up 8 hours later and people still replying with ping on
creations-chat 2022-06-17 13:15:11 we dont need to know how well the technology works just how good it is
the fact that the f-22 does not have these things is proof enough, i dont get whats so confusing
the program being newer by 15 years should be the end of discussion
creations-chat 2022-06-17 13:17:26 like what some sort of super beam death ray? lol this is stupid
the f-35 has more advanced systems, no one needs to know how they actually work, the f-22 doesnt have the same so the f-35 is more advanced
creations-chat 2022-06-17 13:19:30 they already have this is public info dude💀
who the hell mentioned speed
were talking about avionics system, *the f-35 program is newer than the f-22 program by 15 years* it is simpleeee
creations-chat 2022-06-17 13:22:02 your definitely baiting now, in 18 years we went from the p-51 to mach 2 f-4 phantom💀
goodbye
creations-chat 2022-06-17 14:07:58 su-57 dont even exist bruh
creations-chat 2022-06-17 14:13:19 nah the joke is that theres like 3 of them and they crashed the other 2
its a discount gen 4 with rivets and shit sticking out everywhere
creations-chat 2022-06-17 14:15:27 j-20 is so much more of a gen 5 than su-57 is, they legit just took a flanker and tried to make it less visible to radar and called it a gen 5, f-35 and f-22 airframes were started from scrap, exception of f-35b for the vtol system
creations-chat 2022-06-17 14:20:59 j-20 rcs is unknown but chinese missiles at least have better ranges, they also went for the same engine design as f-35 so that it would be less visible to stealth
the su-57 doesnt have that because they still use a temporary engine and they didnt want to make it so much more expensive for that
creations-chat 2022-06-17 14:24:46 china has been copying russia for awhile now, i think its changing tho cause the difference between su-57 and j-20 is pretty obvious
even their mbt is based off a t-72 chasis
creations-chat 2022-06-17 14:27:23 china military is scarier than russia anyway, the military spending of china is 260 billion usd, russia military spending is 65 billion usd
china has more people than all of europe too like damn what if they did a draft
russia military is mostly old stuff
they made the t-14 armata but havent even mass produced it yet so
creations-chat 2022-06-17 14:32:14 i mean hey if they can hold a gun🗿
<@652925710976942100> dont forget missile technology, radar and pilots
pretty sure russian pilots get half the flight time us pilots do
creations-chat 2022-06-17 14:38:22 🤡
creations-chat 2022-06-17 15:31:36 they still reverse engineered russian engines that were given to them without permission
creations-chat 2022-06-17 16:18:42 bruh i aint even being racist but he legitimately said ching chong at 0:26
creations-chat 2022-06-20 00:14:33 a tribute to discord moderators 
its cringe right? this isnt normal right?
"low rank" 💀
creations-chat 2022-06-20 00:16:35 pov you care about ranks🤡
creations-chat 2022-06-20 00:19:33 lol i made the username when you were sucking your thumb
creations-chat 2022-06-20 00:21:41 you could check my roblox profile🤔
creations-chat 2022-06-20 00:23:44 your math is genius dude
creations-chat 2022-06-20 17:05:21 why
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 22:30:27 random number generate
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 22:30:33 its like opening a chest in csgo
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 22:31:38 white in general people dont like cause its the default color, even if its painted white irl
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 22:32:08 yeah ive seen people make stuff light grey even tho the irl thing is closer to default white
creations-chat 2022-06-22 18:27:18 cant do much about that, it will be too skinny otherwise, and won't look circular, will just be a rectangle tank
the gear on f-18 tho is too short
creations-chat 2022-06-22 18:31:27 lol
creations-chat 2022-06-22 18:34:45 or su-57, or the super fast fake plane darkstar, or f-14
creations-chat 2022-06-22 18:42:05 morfix hornet is better than storm hornet, intake, wings, cockpit, nose, basically everything
topgun livery sucks ass
creations-chat 2022-06-22 18:44:07 yeah v rank i havent tried to get a rank in like 2 years bruh🗿 
keep crying
creations-chat 2022-06-22 18:48:50 why would you even use the topgun livery, blue doesn't look good on planes
creations-chat 2022-06-22 18:51:28 bruh you just go onto sketchfab and search up a model without finding a good one, you prob dont even use blueprints prob why your dimensions are so fucked
creations-chat 2022-06-22 18:55:26 
creations-chat 2022-06-22 18:59:09 storm still arguing that its not his build after he proved it 10 times💀
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 21:54:12 its one of the best 9.7 bruh, aim-9g is very long range letting you catch people off guard
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 22:06:24 not if you launch 2.5-3.5 km
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 22:06:44 i always use them longer range since they only get their pull later since the burn time is longer than something like 9j
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 22:07:25 i havent played harrier gr3 since they got their air spawn removed but i still got 2 kills with the 9g every match by just firing above people
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 22:07:45 cant use them much in top tier phantom fgr2 tho but still they aren't that bad
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 22:07:49 for 9.7 they are some of the best
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 22:08:15 i guess you can say r-60 is better but its on a shit airframe yak38💀
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 22:09:14 yeah they are the worst missile at top tier now just cause 1 flare makes it useless
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 22:09:35 at least you can somewhat come in at an unexpected angle with r-60m but its not on the mld
contest-chat 2022-06-24 17:55:56 pov your mad cause star wars is better than all your crappy games
creations-chat 2022-06-25 14:34:07 Just get good
creations-chat 2022-06-27 17:08:12 you think theres more colored names? most people join and dont talk or forget about the server, you think 34k people chat consistently in this discord??
creations-chat 2022-07-01 20:17:16 2 twin towers 1 with a antenna on top definitely
creations-chat 2022-07-10 05:31:00 yeah sure but its taken that long just for that💀  how??
creations-chat 2022-11-29 20:46:06 is this game dead yet
creations-chat 2022-12-03 19:55:35 except you gotta make it seamless and the big motor on top of the wing is gonna make it look even worse
creations-chat 2022-12-03 19:57:47 its still gonna stick out, look at the angle its rotating you cant make that look good since the entire thing is a wing the motor will always be super visibile
would be nice if we had invisible motors or something, maybe a motor as tall as a half block or something cause swing wing planes usually look so bad regardless of how good the rest is the wing always looks bad, we all already use cameras as invisible blocks anyway
creations-chat 2022-12-03 20:02:19 thats mostly why i got tired of plane crazy 
it was 99% putting hundreds of motors in complicated places instead of actually making the airframe, when you get that advanced it takes way too long to build anything
wish we just had more blocks tbh so much could be solved if we just had like 2 or 3 more blocks
creations-chat 2023-01-02 20:25:44 197 studs per hour is 100x slower than walking with your player
creations-chat 2023-03-22 20:24:27 what? why did you reply to something that is 5 years old
