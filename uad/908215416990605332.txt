creations-chat 2022-08-06 04:56:24 <@694730952177483779> I suggest using sparklers for the cannon's barrel instead of cylinders (cylinders are way too **T H I C C**)
bug-reports 2022-08-09 11:00:29 Why auto exit the seat when spawn builds in and sometimes auto seat on them when in build mode
bug-reports 2022-08-09 12:00:23 I had it when I spawn in my build 

What I mean for the auto seat in build mode actually happens when you just despawn your build when still seating on the main pilot seat

creations-chat 2023-02-04 10:02:36 any thoughts lol (NOT A TUTORIAL)
creations-chat 2023-02-04 10:07:07 kind of
creations-chat 2023-02-04 10:14:54 I can't due to the complexity (not really)
creations-chat 2023-02-04 10:17:03 this is it in build mode (Also it's an F-104G)

Skills issue don't allow me to have cam lock, only angle lock and piston lock
creations-chat 2023-02-04 10:19:30 way too overlocked
creations-chat 2023-02-04 10:24:29 yea

WAY TOO blank






The livery is just WT's F-104G but a lot more simple
creations-chat 2023-02-04 10:27:15 planning to work on it, not done with this thing yet
creations-chat 2023-02-04 10:29:31 explosed lock moment


many still mistaken it with Summit's (inspired and some stuffs were based off his F-104)
creations-chat 2023-02-26 13:59:48 is there any good WW2 era tank turret design that I can ~~steal~~ copy?
creations-chat 2023-05-14 06:14:06 suggestions? T-80U turret
the blocks that have lighter green are ammunition boxes for the HMG
