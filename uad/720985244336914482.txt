general 2023-05-12 06:38:55 absolutley
general 2023-05-12 06:39:23 problem was it was so hard to control cus when helium was shot out it would cause it to go goofy#
general 2023-05-12 06:39:33 yes

general 2023-05-12 06:39:51 yep

general 2023-05-12 15:07:31 does anyone know if plane crazy 2 will have better train tracks?
general 2023-05-12 15:08:45 the turns on the current track make it impossible to build large trains
general 2023-05-12 15:08:53 curves need to be softer
general 2023-05-12 15:11:15 ive been trying to build a train from a show thats bigger than normal trains so my ideal would be soft curves same guagew
