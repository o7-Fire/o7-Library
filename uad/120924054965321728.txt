creations-chat 2022-02-27 17:14:48 the digger is great i agree, and the type 59 is pretty neat considering how small it is
creations-chat 2022-02-27 17:21:30 now THATS pretty terrible :P but i still think that a lot of the stuff in creations is above average compared to the average plane crazy player, maybe not the average plane crazy discord hyper fan elitist xD

creations-chat 2022-02-27 17:36:11 not true, even just seeing how better builders do things is helpful
