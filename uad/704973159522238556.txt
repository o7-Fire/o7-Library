creations-chat 2020-11-26 13:37:44 because somebody doesnt like it :/
creations-chat 2020-11-26 13:39:46 Upvotes don't depend on how much time you've spent on a creation. They depend on the quality of the creation... and I'm sorry to say that yours... could use some more work.
creations-chat 2020-11-26 13:59:45 same but it could use some more work
creations-chat 2020-11-28 14:48:25 making a destroyer inspired by the tribal class any thoughts?

creations-chat 2021-02-11 14:17:58 make the hull smoother by using half wedges and stuff like that. the railings can be angled using motors
creations-chat 2021-02-11 14:21:56 well when i said motors i also meant locked motors. he could use locked motors to make the hull overall smoother by making custom wedges and stuff like that.... well yeah tnt locked motors  and disconnector locked motors if he wants to use that in a public non pvp server
creations-chat 2021-02-11 15:47:22 hh small motorlock bridge to the right side of the turret. any way to put those motors in the turret?
creations-chat 2021-02-11 15:50:38 you could move the top of the turret up by 2-3 blocks and move that motorlock bridge on the inside. then simply pull the top of the turret back with motors. should be possible
creations-chat 2021-02-11 15:52:46 ohh so motors are attatched to the gun mantlet. then delete some blocks of the gun mantlet and place the motors there. do watch out for possible hitboxes of other blocks. they might block some of the motors

creations-chat 2021-02-17 13:33:29 <@!648512827283472396> Your ship weighs too much at the front, the deck at the back is put too down, move it upwards, you can see the water glitching through the floor.
creations-chat 2021-02-17 13:35:36 and move the floor at the back up by 1-2 blocks. also add some pontoon blocks inside the front, so that it doesnt look front heavy
creations-chat 2021-02-17 13:37:37 i didnt mean that e i said the back of the ship. its too close to the water. move it up by 1-2 blocks
creations-chat 2021-02-17 13:39:41 im talking about the back of the ship, like the part without anything on it. even if its the same height as the first floor it will look better from the side
creations-chat 2021-02-17 13:41:43 ik but if you move it up by 1 block it will look way better from the side
creations-chat 2021-02-18 13:54:44 :/
creations-chat 2021-02-18 14:25:28 the cockpit is quite questionable and the tail is to be redone...
creations-chat 2021-02-18 15:10:41 sub with big gun
creations-chat 2021-02-18 15:13:01 i downvotes simply because of the huge turret (and the rocket spam)... the sub in itself is decent, but the turret ruins everything. i also think those water mines are too many and are too big.
creations-chat 2021-02-18 15:15:16 much better. now just delete half of those water mines, make them smaller, and distribute them across the plot. or you could just delete them.
creations-chat 2021-02-18 15:17:19 sub's ugly with those floating mines, besides, what kind of person would even get close to those in the first place <:Thonk:509498568982134816> apart from brain dead people in a public server
creations-chat 2021-02-18 15:20:42 OHHHHH so they are underwater... well that does fix the fact that they are ugly... eh k ill let that pass
creations-chat 2021-02-18 16:03:54 bru i only got 16 days ;-;
creations-chat 2021-02-18 16:05:56 on my main i have around 10 and a few hours... its relatively new. since i had 3 other accs (i made them bcz of save data issues in pc, but then rick upgraded save data so F) in total i have around 16-17 days of gameplay. tis not a lot but it honest work

creations-chat 2021-02-18 16:35:45 hh the will to make custom smooth wedges for bow but lazy to change glass
creations-chat 2021-02-18 16:37:46 i think he meant submarine...? or something that goes underwater. or something that is semi submerged...? damn it my brain is dying just by answering this question

creations-chat 2021-02-18 16:42:32 rn im making a custom ww2 aircraft carrier. how does it look so far (ffs the cooldown on this channel)
creations-chat 2021-02-18 16:44:54 im going to add the fourth fold either today or tmrw (well, at least part of it)
creations-chat 2021-02-18 16:53:27 ty nice ship barrechor

creations-chat 2021-02-18 17:10:43 ship is very nice and very detailed. me like it
creations-chat 2021-02-18 17:13:29 ery nice
creations-chat 2021-02-18 17:15:31 for the 6x1 and 8x1 wedges create them by using motors (if u dont know how to make custom wedges then rip just use wedge 1x4)
creations-chat 2021-02-19 16:12:27 <@!518494504307916802> 1. The cockpit and front have to be redone 2. The underside of the plane is probably flat, change that 3. The wings are too small 4. There are no horizontal stabilisers 5. The creation is too blocky, use more wedges (Work on these and it'll look way better)
creations-chat 2021-02-19 16:18:27 eh seen worst locked motor messes
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 18:18:35 ery noicee

creations-chat 2021-04-18 08:27:33 <@!284906515067043840> It's quite nice, but the vertical stabilizer and the tail are too thick. Use a bit more wing panels instead of blocks.
creations-chat 2021-04-19 14:31:27 In this case, though, it's below average.
creations-chat 2021-04-19 14:34:26 Don't worry. From mistakes you can learn. I to, at the start, sucked at building. From what I can see, I suggest adding different tones of colour, more details and a better shape. Hope this comment helps 😄

help 2021-05-05 19:04:32 unless ur talking about the heli turning to the left or the right
help 2021-05-05 19:06:44 if it spins out to the right or the left its because if its a non coaxial rotor (1 main rotor instead of 2) and it spins either to the right or the left making the heli spin the direction the rotor is spinning
help 2021-05-05 19:07:51 this can be fixed by adding a tail rotor which spins and pulls the heli either to the right or the left, depending on the direction its spinning or how u set the propeller blades

creations-chat 2022-01-30 17:12:11 To be fair, wtf are those horizontal stabilizers on the third pic and the paintjob is killing my eyes. Also, the landing gear is just abysmally small for such an aircraft. And 2 years for those builds seems a bit excessive, to be honest with you. Also, fix those cheese grater wings on the last pic.
creations-chat 2022-01-30 17:17:39 From below, it just looks a bit off. Probably because the transition from cockpit to fuselage isn't smooth, but rather *unsmooth*. Use custom wedges for that. And there is something about the horizontal stabilizers that doesn't convince me entirely. Other than that, for me it looks fairly ok.
creations-chat 2022-01-30 17:50:59 <@!699681364731232456> wtf are all those motors, also the propellers at the tip of the wings are just disgusting

creations-chat 2023-04-18 12:52:35 long time since I posted anything, so here is a wip I've been working on (need ideas for details I could add)
creations-chat 2023-04-18 12:57:23 half blocks or disconnectors for them?
creations-chat 2023-04-18 14:43:44 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
creations-chat 2023-07-09 14:37:37 tmnak I'm working on based off of the challenger 2 (need detail ideas which aren't tracks)
creations-chat 2023-07-09 14:41:20 side is a bit stale rn, and idk what to add
creations-chat 2023-07-09 14:43:56 on the sides of the tank or under the wheels (tried tracks before but was a pain, smoke canisters I have some at the front and back of the turret)
creations-chat 2023-07-09 15:18:20 looks like the trails don't transition smoothly to the other side of the cockpit
bug-reports 2023-07-09 16:02:27 anybody getting huge ping whenever you try spawning in a big build of around 1500 blocks or more? for the first few seconds it's fine, but after that, it steadily increases into the thousands of ms
bug-reports 2023-07-09 16:02:36 maybe it's just me
bug-reports 2023-07-09 16:07:10 yes
bug-reports 2023-07-09 16:07:12 quite a few
bug-reports 2023-07-09 16:07:41 are pistons broken?
bug-reports 2023-07-09 16:09:32 managed to reach 1.000.000 ms yesterday
bug-reports 2023-07-09 16:13:51 I took that measurement in a vip server without anybody
bug-reports 2023-07-09 16:14:02 still happens
bug-reports 2023-07-09 16:15:02 aight
creations-chat 2023-07-10 13:55:25 added tracks and smoke launchers
creations-chat 2023-07-12 19:27:27 have no idea what to add to it... latest addition is the plow (wooden material pattern looks cool imo)
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:37:45 Uh, never met you before
plane-crazy 2023-07-18 08:37:58 And I didn’t use camera locking
