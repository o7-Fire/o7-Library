bot-central 2023-06-01 03:21:49 &suggest

agree with the suggestion above. Release the PC2 Early and fix any glitches & unfinished work that we can spot out and report. besides its becoming summer and I will expect a stormworks like game
bot-central 2023-06-01 03:21:52 what
bot-central 2023-06-01 03:22:01 ohh i must be ranked

plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:24:54 <@719807717782454302> agree with ur suggestion about releasing PC2 early. ppl should upvote because you can tell that more than half the PCC is inpatient for PC2. besides I would want to see the StormWorks of roblox
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:26:20 If Plane Crazy 1 Dies, nobody will notice Plane Crazy 2's release because they quit the first game. rick should release the game early and pull of a very pre-alpha stage game
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:30:49 bro FlightPoint was made in months and its not that buggy
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:30:58 I would expect PC2 to not be that buggy
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:31:48 Well we know its gonna be release __this summer__
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:32:09 so like this july or june or even august

plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:34:40 :OOOO PLSSSS DONT REPORT
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:35:53 either RickJe139 is lazy to do PC2 or just busy with work and feeding his family n shit
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:36:11 while making a whole community more and more impatient
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:37:16 If its taking RICKJE THIS FUCKING LONG WERE EXPECTING A BETTER VERSION OF STORMWORKS
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:37:35 IM BETTING 1800 ROBUX
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:37:39 IN PLS DONATE
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:40:05 if PC2 devs makes a trailer about the previews, they have to make the music background "Life could be dream"
plane-crazy 2023-06-01 03:41:08 im making a K-Class heavy transport ship
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:09:41 if plane crazy doesn't autosave my build again, im quiting this fucking game
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:10:11 whole 1000 blocks vanished and I thought it autosaves
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:18:44 When the controls surfaces try to stabalize the aircraft, it freaks out
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:18:52 maybe use Invert motor 2
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:18:59 works with mouse pointing
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:19:23 ye it works on mobile too
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:19:59 7/10 if im being honest
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:20:11 you need a more analog horror feeling
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:20:46 it reminds me of the trollge files
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:21:05 it cuts from real people to a lego character

plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:21:55 good tho
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:23:44 I garantee if u sponser ur game heavily, you'll get popularity which leads to more robux which leads to DevEx which leads to actual money
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:24:27 how much robux did u pay to sponser
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:25:13 make tiktoks or YT shorts with tags that have a very big community. If u make tiktoks or Yt shorts about your game, it will get popularity
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:25:18 just like a demo or trailer
plane-crazy 2023-06-02 02:25:58 how much robux did u get

(No inventor role for you buddy <:clueless:942802644043464734> )
creations-chat 2023-07-11 20:47:21 Its pretty good. The treads are nice but I would recommend working on the exterior of the tank to fit with the detail of the treads
creations-chat 2023-07-11 20:50:36 Make equipment on the back of the tank to cover the exposed motor lock or make a ghillie for the tank to expose the locks
creations-chat 2023-07-11 20:56:29 <@717225155029631057> If you wanna make a build contributing to a tragic matter, go ahead. Seems like an asshole thing to do
creations-chat 2023-07-11 21:04:40 you can add barrels to the back. It may fit with the build and cover the motor locks. May limit the rotation of the tank
creations-chat 2023-07-11 21:19:17 looks fine to me. I’ll think it as giant screws in the tank

plane-crazy 2023-07-15 22:05:19 Cosco has more superior ships than MAERSK in my opinion
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 22:05:31 but then the Maximus Concept overshadows it
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 22:06:18 I just said the Maximus concept overshadows everything
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 22:06:20 https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2022/10/05/maersk-continues-green-transformation?exit=Newsletter
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 22:06:52 its still a concept
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 22:07:09 Shipping lanes maximus looks good tho
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 22:07:18 Makes 18.2 million per run
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 22:07:44 with 1.5x
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 22:08:00 without it, makes 11-12 million
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 22:08:06 i tink
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 22:08:42 But their is gonna be a new end-game ship which is SSCV slepnir or Boka Vangaurd
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 22:08:57 There superiority overcasts the maximus
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 22:09:24 I did see the boka vangaurd carry a whole cruise ship
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 22:10:33 Well whats the catagory?
