3 things I wish for in plane crazy

1- MUCH bigger map
* Have a much bigger map, to include a bigger airstrip, water area, and more space to design cars and maybe some more railroads

2- Sharing permissions
* Be able to give  more permissions to a player than if they can enter your build space. Allowing people to help you build would be really fun
* Allow others to fly your planes and have permissions to use the pilot seat while the aircraft is being used

3- Build sharing codes
* Be able to share builds with others similar to sharing tunes and liveries in Forza by using a code. This would make it much easier to have fun with your builds with friends.
