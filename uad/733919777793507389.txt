creations-chat 2022-06-04 17:34:33 is there a reason as to why I cannot post images in <#384025409945337856>?
general 2022-06-04 17:37:51 Looks are subjective
general 2022-06-04 17:39:22 I’m indifferent to European designs
general 2022-06-04 17:40:35 Though jets like the F9F also look nice
general 2022-06-04 17:42:14 They are pretty different-
general 2022-06-04 17:43:28 No
general 2022-06-04 17:43:41 Nemo deserved what he got
general 2022-06-04 17:44:11 yes
general 2022-06-04 17:45:10 yes, but with missiles
general 2022-06-04 17:46:03 Didn’t the F-35 get armed with the GAU-8A? (I think that’s the gun idk)
general 2022-06-04 17:46:49 Yes but it bad
general 2022-06-04 17:47:06 It’s more an early warning system
creations-chat 2022-06-04 17:48:18 Like a reddish white or metallic silver would probably do

general 2022-06-04 17:50:20 What was it then- I remember seeing footage of an F-35 armed with a brrt cannon
general 2022-06-04 17:51:02 Not really
general 2022-06-04 17:51:06 ah
general 2022-06-04 17:51:43 It’s more of backup in case of your main weapons not working
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 17:51:57 Oh lord
general 2022-06-04 17:53:26 Not really
general 2022-06-04 17:54:08 It’s outdated for the most modern weapons, but it’s still an extremely effective anti-ground unit
general 2022-06-04 17:54:46 chaff & flares
general 2022-06-04 17:56:09 they are primarily air-to-ground units, not air superiority

general 2022-06-07 01:35:27 Ah, forgetfulness
general 2022-06-07 01:36:24 does it depend on the offense?
general 2022-06-07 01:37:48 I would recite “the missile knows where it is”
general 2022-06-07 01:38:48 oh dear
general 2022-06-08 02:13:17 Mc fucking died
general 2022-06-08 02:13:49 Jenga

general 2022-06-08 02:16:36 juggernaut
general 2022-06-08 02:19:11 Rickje (I think) doing a lil trolling
general 2022-06-08 02:20:38 Average discord mod
general 2022-06-08 02:21:09 oh dear
general 2022-06-08 02:22:26 Nono
general 2022-06-08 02:23:08 Gaming

creations-chat 2022-06-10 05:33:55 "very big army" can be translated from the last one (give or take a few accents)
