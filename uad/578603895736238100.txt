general 2020-04-01 15:02:01 Where do I report bugs in the games?
general 2020-04-01 15:02:09 Ok
general 2020-04-01 15:02:53 I can't find it because everything is upside down
general 2020-04-01 15:03:35 My plane with 332 parts that I spent several hours on just deleted itself from the saves
general 2020-04-01 15:05:01 I need to report a bug
general 2020-04-01 15:05:22 I lost several hours of work building something and a bug deleted it
general 2020-04-01 15:06:57 I could only find the report channel
general 2020-04-01 15:07:03 No bug report
general 2020-04-01 15:08:03 
general 2020-04-01 15:08:06 I don't see it
general 2020-04-01 15:08:52 Why don't I see it?
general 2020-04-01 15:09:11 So I can't report a bug?
general 2020-04-01 15:09:15 Ok
general 2020-04-01 15:10:25 What's the form for bug reports?
general 2020-04-01 15:10:40 Oh
general 2020-04-01 15:10:52 So I just report the bug?
general 2020-04-01 15:11:21 Ok
general 2020-04-01 15:11:50 I would've shared my plane here too but i never got any screenshots before it deleted itself off the save
general 2020-04-01 15:12:58 The plane had moving engines that allowed it to pitch up and down quickly
general 2020-04-01 15:14:07 No way
general 2020-04-01 15:14:59 Can I report the bug now?
general 2020-04-01 15:15:44 Maybe someone with the designer rank could report it for me?
general 2020-04-01 15:16:10 Trouble
bot-central 2020-04-01 15:16:34 ?rhelp
general 2020-04-01 15:21:11 I also have a question
general 2020-04-01 15:21:28 Is there a way for players that don't own a plane to pilot it?
general 2020-04-01 15:21:47 Not even with the pilot seat?
general 2020-04-01 15:22:08 Aww
general 2020-04-01 15:22:42 I wish there was a way to pilot someone else plane
general 2020-04-01 15:23:02 Like a seat for other players to pilot
general 2020-04-01 15:25:16 How do I suggest something?
general 2020-04-01 15:26:10 What rank do I need?
general 2020-04-01 15:26:48 What rank do I need to suggest something?

general 2020-04-01 15:27:29 A four winged plane
general 2020-04-01 15:27:57 A hovercraft that pilots itself (kind of)
general 2020-04-01 15:29:11 Ok
general 2020-04-01 16:15:54 It turns out I had a rough draft for the plane that got deleted still saved
general 2020-04-01 16:16:02 I managed to make a better version
general 2020-04-01 16:16:47 It has a turning tail to help control it better
help 2020-04-01 16:22:27 How do I make a creation post?

creations-chat 2020-04-01 16:24:56 My plane that has wings that rotate upwards and a tail that turns to allow more manuverabiluty, It uses rockets for thrust

general 2020-04-02 00:15:58 I've tried rope but it's pretty glitchy
general 2020-04-02 03:22:31 Can rope be used as a joint? One that could bend in all directions
general 2020-04-02 03:23:10 Its April fools

general 2020-04-02 03:23:43 Darn
general 2020-04-02 03:24:32 Some might be more special
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 03:25:53 Can rope be used as a joint that can bend in any direction?
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 03:27:09 Is it possible to use rope as a joint that bends all ways
plane-crazy 2020-04-02 03:28:00 I've seen builds that have joints that allow them to bend but can't find the part (they were too thin to use motors as joints)
general 2020-04-02 18:57:34 What do anchor blocks do?
general 2020-04-02 18:59:40 What do anchor blocks do? I didn't even get a proper answer
general 2020-04-02 18:59:59 I need a better description

general 2020-04-07 18:23:35 Why would they dm you that much?
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 23:15:38 Anything I try doing is moved to the right and won't let me edit the settings of itens
plane-crazy 2020-04-07 23:22:44 
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 00:31:26 I can't build anything because if a glitch
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 00:31:32 Everything is moved to the right
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:42:24 The glitch of everything being placed to right is making the game unplayable
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:46:46 Conveyor drive?
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:47:24 I don't know what either of those things are
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:47:48 But I cant build anything anyways
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:48:29 I don't have any tanks to report glitches so I'm stuck dealing with it
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:48:38 Ranks*
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:55:38 I fixed the glitch
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:55:56 Everything was moved to the right
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 01:56:03 I couldn't place stuff
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 04:10:13 Is the range of the magnet count in blocks?

creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:28:55 I dont know what's wrong with them
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:29:02 They just get downvoted a lot
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:29:22 My builds
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:32:30 I share my builds to try getting a designer role so I can report bugs and suggest stuff
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:33:14 Where it reverses wherever you click/tap?
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:33:19 That happens with me
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:33:45 Huh
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:35:09 Wanna know what I've been wanting to suggest
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:35:25 Explosive cylinders are one thing
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:35:37 To make custom weapons easier
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:35:41 Also
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:35:56 Make it so explosives dont bounce off of stuff at high speeds
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:37:58 I use explosives for my custom weapons and firing them is a pain because theres only explosive blocks to use for ammo, then when I do manage to fire them they just bounce off the target
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:38:33 I've had to use cutters for most of my weapons
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:38:43 But they dont deal as much damage
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:40:24 The video isn't working
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:41:28 Still no
creations-chat 2020-04-13 01:41:43 Dm it to me?

plane-crazy 2020-05-13 19:41:08 And a mortar or torpedo
creations-chat 2020-05-13 19:42:39 My mini aircraft carrier, the plane works (it uses hovers because it needs to stay a certain height above the water)
creations-chat 2020-05-13 19:43:33 Nvm

plane-crazy 2020-05-30 16:49:28 I just sailed out of the water
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 16:50:16 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 16:50:28 And it sails in the empty
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 16:50:41 Nope
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 16:51:00 It has over 1300 parts
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 16:51:03 Neat
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 16:51:47 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 16:52:01 I lost a giant plane that's whole wings angled
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 16:52:08 It flew really well
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 16:52:19 I now mainly build ships
bug-reports 2020-06-01 05:34:52 Make blacklist boxes thicker, my combat vehicle with a seat on its blade could pierce it and let me in
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 02:28:04 There's a dude that's pestering me then when I near his plot he blacklists and un blacklists me just to be annoying
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:20:28 I'm trying to make a ship but the wing panels start bugging out
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:24:28 
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:24:38 They go crazy
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:25:09 Unpowered so players can turn the sails
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:25:37 When I made the second sail it freaked out
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:25:42 The first one is fine

plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:26:35 Its panels
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:26:44 But it needs them to steer
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:27:06 It's meant to require 2 players to sail
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:27:34 They arent
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:28:05 They act like they have they have thrusters attached

general 2020-08-14 17:18:02 Is asking players in game allowed?
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 21:19:32 I'm looking for a group that does micro builds
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 00:58:19 I present the hedron, an omni-directional craft that does not rotate, yet it can move in any direction without the use of buttons (other than for the thruster)
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 01:02:03 
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 01:02:23 It is a craft
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 01:02:30 Just an ominous one
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 01:03:08 For optimal movement
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 01:03:15 It doesn't need it it's just better
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 01:03:23 And it's for a space battle group
general 2021-04-11 01:07:56 I made a very *interesting* craft, it physically cannot rotate yet can move in any direction
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:09:13 Anything I can do to make people like this better? I already have 2 downvotes
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:11:15 The hedron
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:13:19 It's an octohedron that cannot rotate and is omnidirectional, it's not just a blob
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:15:51 I didnt want to start an argument because of my question
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:19:08 I added a better explanation to it
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:21:32 No need to insult, he's being polite and asking a question
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:23:33 Looks pretty cool, I wouldnt be able to make a normal looking plane for sure
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:25:34 Btw isn't directing Cussing or insults at someone against the rules?
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:27:37 Well guess what, I am lgbtq+

He called me gay, which I am technically
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:31:17 Yeah, it is. I didnt mean to start an argument but oh well
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:34:17 I'll do a video of it, I can't show its inner workings cause a friend developed the gadgets in it
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:37:28 Ok, stop arguing, I'll do a video demonstrating it and link it in the comment
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:39:32 I painted it that way to make it look ominous or similar to that octohedron angel from evangelion, i will show a video of it moving soon
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:41:59 Can you stop arguing, I dont want drama and I dont want people thinking I caused this trouble
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:44:20 You're allowed to downvote, just dont cuss at each other or throw insults
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:48:52 Question, what does please the community?
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:50:54 Like what? Idk what classifies as a good build, clearly its not complex ones that do it
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:53:01 It may not look fancy but it took a lot of work to cram everything into that small space, it's full of functionality, I'm not good at fancy build, just functional ones
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:55:03 It took effort, it's just not as flashy or fancy as other things
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:57:04 ?
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 01:57:39 Because it's more ominous than a pink one
creations-chat 2021-04-11 01:59:41 Oh wow
general 2021-04-11 02:01:07 Pink is just gendered by culture, doesn't matter who likes what color, it's a wavelength of photons
general 2021-04-11 02:01:24 Oh
general 2021-04-11 02:01:25 Ok
general 2021-04-11 02:01:28 Sorry
general 2021-04-11 02:01:36 I already do
general 2021-04-11 02:01:53 Consume the keratin
general 2021-04-11 02:02:25 I got wooshed
general 2021-04-11 02:02:42 I hate that description of fingernails
general 2021-04-11 02:02:53 Fun fact: butter is toast paint
general 2021-04-11 02:03:32 Poptarts are ravioli
general 2021-04-11 02:04:00 Get sleep
general 2021-04-11 02:05:14 
general 2021-04-11 02:05:33 I forgot I had this
creations-chat 2021-04-11 03:05:20 Lmao
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:33:39 Are there any high torque hyperdrives that work?
creations-chat 2021-04-11 23:36:14 Hey <@456226577798135808> how does your kinetic bike work?
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:36:35 How do I make one
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:36:43 The designs that used to work dont anymore
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:38:23 <@368581738496131072> none of the old designs work anymore
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:38:47 Can you show me one
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:38:52 I might be doing them wrong then
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:39:44 Bruh
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:39:49 That no work for me
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:40:38 I'm trying to mount it to a gimbal mechanism
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:40:50 I need a small design
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:41:11 Does the first one you showed me work on a gimbal?
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:42:13 And does it need half blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:42:37 It's small
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:42:57 It's hard to fit detail or function into a small vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:43:29 My hedron is small and I had to fit three secret mechanisms and a gimbal
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:44:06 Some stuff breaks when locked
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:44:13 Especially moving parts
plane-crazy 2021-04-11 23:45:00 Even skilled players can have trouble with things or have things that just aren't possible to do get in their way
creations-chat 2021-04-11 23:45:44 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:47:08 I need a powerful but small hyperdrive that can function while on a gimbal (2x2-3x3)
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:47:32 The classic conveyor hyperdrive doesn't work for me for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:49:34 I still need a hyperdrive
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:49:52 and conveyor drives  aren't working
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:51:27 I majorly need a hyperdrive to get my latest creation to work effectively
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:52:29 Wdym
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:53:12 It was in contact with another block
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:53:18 And on a piston
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:53:31 Even off my build it doesn't work well
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:54:06 It's on a pistone
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:54:09 Piston
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:54:45 Nothing else
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:55:02 And the conveyor pad is in contact with a block to move
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:55:09 But it goes slow
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:55:18 And doesn't have much torque
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:55:22 I did
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:55:26 It's at max speed
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:55:41 The top is one block wide
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:56:18 I need something strong enough to pull it around
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:56:24 Its has about 950 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:56:48 It's on a gimbal
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:57:09 But even out of the machine and just loose it does next to nothing at full speed
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:57:14 Any other drives??
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:57:36 Oof
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:57:39 What else
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:57:55 I tried a magnet drive but it makes me fly upwards for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 00:59:31 Flying pedos
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 01:00:04 Ye lol
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 01:02:07 Anyone know how to make a conveyer drive?
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 01:02:37 Piston*
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 01:02:43 Not conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:26:52 Is there a good way to stop builds from bouncing when dropped from 10k or higher?
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:27:38 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:27:45 Is there a way to stop bouncing
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:28:26 Without tons of suspension
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:28:43 How good do springs work
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:29:10 It needs to land fast
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:29:15 Not a slow fall
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:29:24 Drop pod
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:29:27 During battles
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:30:05 If I slow down I'll be shot down
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:30:14 This is for a group in
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:30:44 I just need a passive way to stop bunching
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:30:47 Bouncing
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:31:05 Slowing down will get me destroyed
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:31:17 Maybe
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:31:38 It's a large drop pod
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:31:50 Its not gonna be planes I'm working about
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:31:56 Its tanks with guns and turrets
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:32:53 I'm worried about fast aiming guns and turrets
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:33:07 If I slow down I'll be desd
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:33:09 Desd
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:33:11 Dead
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:33:41 I just need to be able to drop it, release its contents and not worry about the pod
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:34:42 Change your materials
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:35:01 So how do I stop bouncing
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:35:09 Anything that isn't too bulky?
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:35:25 I need it passive
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:36:11 Flipping isn't always perfect
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:36:17 And it slows me down a bit
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:36:32 Any ways to quickly glitch a block into the ground to lock in place?
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:38:25 Is there a way to lock a block into the ground
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:40:15 But can I do it without needing to hit a button with good timing?
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:41:36 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:41:56 Oof
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 19:43:51 I dont have good timing
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:04:41 I need a motor 2 bases steering for a large spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:05:40 Based*
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:05:42 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:06:15 I tried a special turning system of my own design but motor 2s are too wobbly for that design
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:06:40 Not enough torque
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 17:07:09 That doesn't add torque, just speed
creations-chat 2021-04-21 04:11:19 <@493681785566265348> how does the block work?
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:09:04 What are some useful glitches that can be made in plane crazy that aren't common knowledge?
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:09:34 How does that work?
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:09:51 I use cameras to make stuff hover but that's it
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:10:40 It points at a ball?
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:10:53 Are there any screens
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:10:55 I'm confused
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:11:23 Any other glitches?
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:13:02 I found a video on camera locking
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:13:08 That's gonna be useful
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:13:25 Any other glitches,
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:13:28 Or tricks
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:17:52 I know a few
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:25:09 Are there any other glitches or tricks?
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:25:43 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:25:52 What does it break exactly?
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:26:00 I'm not after laggy messes
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:26:07 I want useful stuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:27:16 What does the glitch break?<@749835829039464549>
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:27:59 Woah
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:28:49 Wait so it doesnt save the camera amgle?
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:28:51 Angle
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:29:38 So everytime I reload the  build I need to set the cameras again
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:31:35 Are there any other useful glitches?
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:32:16 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:32:27 Ping or dm me if you remember more
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:33:16 I just want more useful glitches or tricks
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:35:32 What's the spinny looking thing in the middle
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:35:50 How does that work?
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:36:13 How does the spinning keep it stable
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:36:22 I didn't think it worked like that
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 19:37:07 Ik
general 2021-05-09 22:08:25 ?
general 2021-05-09 22:08:57 Same goes to you
general 2021-05-09 22:09:12 I drew mine
general 2021-05-09 22:09:23 Ye
general 2021-05-09 22:09:27 Cool
general 2021-05-09 22:12:09 Imagine imagine seeing someone in a wolf suit bite off someone's arm
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 02:48:29 Anyone know how to make a good artillery sight
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 02:48:43 Like one that moves to show where the shot will land
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 02:49:25 I've tried figuring it out with offset motor speeds but idk how to get it to work well
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 02:51:26 A tut?
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 02:52:05 Idk what tut meand
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 02:52:07 Means
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 02:52:10 Like a copy?
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 02:52:24 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 02:52:28 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 02:52:43 I need a way to effect aim a mortar
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 02:52:48 Effectively
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 02:53:23 Any ways to make a sight for one?
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 02:53:41 Maybe a range finder
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 02:53:48 Combined with an angle thingy
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 02:54:55 I'm fine with that
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 02:55:13 I just want a more accurate way to aim artillery
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 02:55:30 Since custom weapons have limited ammo I don't want to waste it
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 18:21:30 Is there a way to control a build without being in a seat
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 18:21:38 I remember a glitch that could do it
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 18:21:43 I just can't find the video
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 18:04:08 I need mech idess
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 18:04:11 Idess
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 18:04:13 Ideas
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 18:16:27 I've made walkers before but I mean like 4 legged mechs and such
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 18:17:59 I want 4-8 logged mech ideas
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 18:18:19 Kinda like my Arachni-roller but more mech like
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 18:18:29 
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 18:20:10 I'm not going for big stuff, I just want something that's a bit easier
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 18:21:57 I'm just making mechs that I enjoy, normal walkers are too slow for my liking
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 18:22:33 I'm not being disrespectful
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 18:22:46 I'm just saying that I don't like walkers as much
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 18:23:08 They can be fun but it's still less agile than other things
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 18:47:18 What's the smallest humanoid Walker possible
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 20:11:22 This aged well
general 2021-07-16 23:34:08 Question, what happened to the community channel?
general 2021-07-16 23:34:47 Wdym
general 2021-07-16 23:35:36 Is there a reason there aren't communities anymore
general 2021-07-16 23:36:55 Oof, theres some genuinely nice communities for this game
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 22:49:39 Are there any groups that do battles? Preferably land battles
creations-chat 2021-07-26 22:19:13 Who ping me in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-07-26 22:21:29 Percival has a spinning shield blade on its left arm (with springs to enhance range) , Galahad has a ball on a chain (ended up behind its leg In the image) and explosive spears for Lancelot (that fold out)
creations-chat 2021-07-26 22:23:49 Any ideas for other weapons to put on centaur frames? They need to be pretty light or the motors wiggle a lot, that happened with an attempt at a pincer weapon but I may have a fix for it now
creations-chat 2021-07-26 22:25:54 I could try that, any unique melee weapons? Shouldve added I'm making these for melee combat
creations-chat 2021-07-26 22:28:44 Like a blade that gets launched by a spring? Springs can't cut stuff with just their force, they need spin which is what percival has, a spring saw

The claw weapon will hopefully be like gundam barbatos's giant wrench saw thing

Itll be used to grab and chop mechs in half (hopefully)
creations-chat 2021-07-26 22:31:05 I'm gonna make an Arthur centaur frame that's larger and might use the saw wrench thing as its special weapon
the-dump 2021-07-26 22:57:49 Hack into someone's account and hide an anchor block in all of their builds, bonus if ur on mobile and remove the keybinds (this Is a joke don't do this)
the-dump 2021-07-26 22:59:38 It's so evil, especially for large builds
the-dump 2021-07-26 23:00:11 Worse than just deleting them outright cause they still have them but can't use them at all
the-dump 2021-07-26 23:00:31 I feel like I've opened pandoras box for bad hacking ideas

the-dump 2021-08-22 16:13:45 What if frogs ran on two legs instead of hopping
general 2021-09-19 21:44:08 Any updates on pc2?
general 2021-09-19 21:46:45 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 18:14:24 I'm looking for a small but effective mech leg design
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 18:14:36 I've tried making my own but it's really hard
plane-crazy 2021-11-01 18:14:57 I have a small-ish design but not small enough
general 2021-11-14 02:15:13 What general time is PC2 being released? Is there any info on it at all?
general 2021-11-14 02:15:45 >:(
general 2021-11-14 02:16:51 I might go for robot specialist 2 or three, I'll have to check the size of my mechs
general 2021-11-14 02:17:53 One issue I have tho is that most of my mechs use a special gizmo that I don't want shown
general 2021-11-14 02:18:19 Me
general 2021-11-14 02:18:31 My mechs are pretty small

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 14:16:36 It's gonna have a radar?
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 14:16:45 Did I miss something?
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 14:17:12 Where did that info come from?
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 14:17:14 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 14:17:21 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 14:19:11 I'm trying to make this mech in PC, (with some changes) it's pretty small for an effective mech at only 200 blocks (100 for the walking mechanism, the extra 100 is details) and I'm expecting the final product to be 350-400 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 14:19:39 Where can I see all the suggestions for that stuff
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 14:19:44 And where could I suggest
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 14:22:16 What's going on in the vc?
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 14:22:39 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 14:23:45 One thing I won't like as much about pc2 is rediscovering useful glitches, most of my mechs use a stabilizer glitch to work well
general 2021-11-25 02:44:38 I literally just started watching a video about that, pretty wild
general 2021-11-25 02:44:49 Like, very NSFW too
general 2021-11-25 05:47:43 Not mine but still a drawing
general 2021-11-25 05:55:59 When it quacks it sounds like a soggy kazoo

general 2021-11-25 07:30:31 Hetero pride -_-

It's like they don't know why pride even exists
general 2021-11-25 07:31:11 Honestly yeah, there's already some pretty bad ones trying to get added
general 2021-11-25 07:31:42 I mean worse
general 2021-11-25 07:31:53 Me?
general 2021-11-25 07:32:03 They aren't on the list
general 2021-11-25 07:32:26 I don't have an anime pfp, it may look similar but it's it's drawing of mine
general 2021-11-25 07:32:38 Only the frogs for now
the-dump 2021-12-06 06:25:06 How does Albert the unfindable crab work exactly? There's a few ways that he could be found while remaining unfindable
 
The first idea is that when found he wipes the memory of his finder. leaving only the knowledge that he, Albert the unfindable crab exists, causing knowledge of him to spread and more people to search for and find him, only to have his existence implanted in their minds and spread yet again. Another thought is that Albert is never the same crab, when found he is not, he becomes a different crab and in his place? An ordinary crab. Albert could have been any crab you've ever found, except he may not have been, he wasn't the crab you found, not once you found him. 

In the end, you will never truly find Albert, he will always remain just out of your reach

general 2021-12-15 17:55:04 Then why is it an update?
general 2021-12-15 17:55:46 Well the items were still in the game before, it would be better to call it an event
general 2021-12-15 17:56:49 Yeah no cussing in our goddamned Christian minecraft server

general 2021-12-15 17:58:58 Of*
general 2021-12-15 17:59:11 Nice
general 2021-12-15 18:02:08 If I saw a jet do that I'd surrender
general 2021-12-15 18:02:47 Ok and?
general 2021-12-15 18:03:59 Planes are cool
general 2021-12-15 18:05:13 Might be the point to lose energy, idk much about that stuff but slowing down fast could throw off the missile it it's going fast or from the side

plane-crazy 2022-01-05 22:51:39 Is there a way to use programmable keys as controls for builds? (The keys at the sides of mice are programmable allowing for whatever is needed to be hot keyed to them)
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 22:52:41 Ik but I want some hot keyed to mouse
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 22:53:20 The ones on the mouse?
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 22:53:22 How
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 22:55:03 It makes sense
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 22:55:16 How do I set it to the mouse?
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 22:55:40 I'd have to check
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 22:56:07 It's from "Ibuypower"
plane-crazy 2022-01-05 22:57:03 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 23:11:10 Not gonna share in <#384025409945337856> cause I based it off a friend's tutorial even though I did heavily modify it
 

It's based off of the Yukikaze class from Space battleship yamato
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 23:13:53 Space battleship yamato ship are really colorful
plane-crazy 2022-01-09 23:14:20 The Yukikaze is normally a bright red, yellow and white

plane-crazy 2022-01-15 07:01:06 How do you keep squadrons from bunching together and becoming impossible to control?
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 07:01:26 I've tried to do similar but they don't stay in formation
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 07:03:10 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 07:03:24 Staying in formation still seems hard
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 07:03:33 Cause they'd eventually just bunch up

the-dump 2022-01-15 07:11:52 
the-dump 2022-01-15 07:13:08 This further context makes me extremely uncomfortable at my post
plane-crazy 2022-01-15 07:16:25 It's silhouette looks too busy, most of its details are all shouting for focus and there isn't really a good centerpiece to draw attention to, the text takes up too much room and covers most of the cars front and back, paint job also doesnt seem too great but that can be harder witht the blocky nature of this game
general 2022-01-16 20:20:11 I would make a mech for the even
general 2022-01-16 20:20:20 I wanna get back into building them
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:20:30 I want mech event
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:20:46 I wanna build a new mech and have a reason to do so
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:21:02 What would the rules be?
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:21:34 Probably
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:21:57 I hope I won't need to use a template
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:22:24 Nice
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:24:01 Nice

What would the rules be? I imagine there would need to be at least some to define what a mech would be (so no one makes a wheeled thing that's faster than everything else or flies more than it walks)
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:25:12 This is a gud tut

https://youtu.be/YbsyWElyVo0
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:27:05 I'm planning to make my own
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:27:24 There could be some kind of qualifiers if anyone's is really worries about good fights
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:29:04 Last time I made a mech half my keyboard had to be used
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:30:26 Yeah, give it a try and give the competitors some time to practice and build
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:31:00 Maybe there could be only melee, explosives are pretty unfair against stuff with so many joints
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:31:23 Cutters for the only damage dealing
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:32:06 I think just cutters would be good
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:32:22 No guns, rockets bombs, fireworks, etc
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:32:59 Only 6? How big would the mech be? What's the size limit?
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:33:56 I don't like making huge mechs, idk about everyone else thi
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:34:18 My mechs aren't large but I don't have to make them tiny either
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:39:08 Most mechs I know of aren't good Hill climbers
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:40:53 Medium mech 1v1 is what I'd want
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:41:09 A bunch of mechs fighting at once would be chaotic
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:41:25 And possibly laggy
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:41:41 Medium to small
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:41:58 Still chaotic, and most mechs I know of can't walk up steep hills
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:42:27 Idk just the rails or smthn
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:42:45 What size should we make them
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:43:00 I'm gonna start making a medium to small rn, I don't like big
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:43:34 Not everyone makes flying mechs
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:45:28 Centaur mech
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:48:10 I'll just use the one tut I made for a really mobile vehicle
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:50:34 Those are really big
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:51:02 The one I was gonna make wouldn't have even been 15 blocks
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:51:18 :|
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:52:02 Ok
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:52:23 Make sure they dictate what is classified as a mech
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:53:35 Bone mech with meat armor
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:53:53 Snake
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:57:27 Even just a few guns would be annoying, I think just cutters is how it should be
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:58:45 Gundam barbatos in most fights:
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:59:22 Tanks aren't filled with motors and lanky limbs
events-chat 2022-01-16 20:59:48 They're also faster than mechs by far so they can dodge better
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:00:13 Actually yes you can
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:00:29 Why
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:01:55 A sunny day probably
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:16:46 Motorlock yes, gigantic over folders seem overkill
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:17:09 What are the rules
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:18:12 I'm trying make this (not to the same scale tho)
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:18:31 Yes
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:20:53 Color a missile bright blue 🤔
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:32:58 What does it mean by no glitches?
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:33:54 I was gonna use a suspension thing for turning my mech instead of thrusters and stuff **:|**
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:34:41 Glitch a friend discovered, locks an axis and I mainly use it for turning
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:36:17 It's a glitch a friend found, idk if I can share it
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:37:09 Maybe they could share it and apply for the inventor role if that still exists
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:38:47 Darn
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:39:13 I'm asking them rn, they aren't online so it might take a bit
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:39:44 The glitch is really useful for turning
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:40:00 And preventing wobble

Not much else
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:40:23 Not even a robot specialist role
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:40:48 Kinda yes kinda no
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:41:38 I got my robot specialist role from one of my ancient robots I don't have anymore
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:46:54 Hello
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:50:45 281 days
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:51:51 A year ago is when I first learned of it too
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:52:07 Inventor is gone from what I was told
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:52:48 <@466793357318815744> would this be allowed in the event?
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:53:20 If I could still apply for inventor I'd say to give it to moth as they found it
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:54:04 It was suggestive 😏
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:54:42 Same
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:55:34 Arthur be like
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:56:18 Shredders are easy and get boring so fast, I made some, pvp'd for 5 minutes and got bored

(When I first started playing)
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:57:03 Who's that?
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:57:47 Which admin is hyperbit
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:58:25 Also where could I ask admins about the inventor role? If I could get it for moth I'd like to cuz they deserve it for finding this
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:58:50 Green one ._.

Kermit the frog?
events-chat 2022-01-16 21:59:31 Hey could the Axis lock glitch be used in the mech event?
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:00:13 Only for turrets
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:01:26 <@466793357318815744> do I ask hyperbit here or in dms?
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:01:43 5 what
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:05:17 Don't make me Un-anchor your arms
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:06:38 At least 3 I think
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:08:21 How many ounces of phosgene was in the pizza?
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:13:16 You fool! I am everyone else in this discord
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:13:42 Don't have to

😎
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:14:05 How would you even abuse an anchor block on a mech?
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:14:54 That just sounds like how I Crack my back every morning
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:16:12 Challenge, use only blocks you find in the first shredder tut you find
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:29:34 Just go star platinum on them lol

(Ik that's that's star platinum but I'm just more into JJBA)
events-chat 2022-01-16 22:29:57 Really do be going ***ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA***
events-chat 2022-01-17 02:10:37 Yessss
events-chat 2022-01-17 07:17:53 If you spin a gun it'll spread its fire out, doesn't deal extra damage tho
events-chat 2022-01-17 09:16:01 I asked hyper and the axis lock isn't allowed for the event :|

I'll have to figure something else out
events-chat 2022-01-17 09:16:39 Legs moving should be the primary form of locomotion, not wheels

plane-crazy 2022-01-19 06:12:12 Most likely it's uncontrollable (for obvious reasons) 

I don't thing anything could turn that fast and also be able to hit anything
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:48:04 Wait that whip doesn't even have cutters
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:48:43 Yeah that would work
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:49:03 Yeah
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:50:37 I was gonna participate but Idk if I wanna try to make a mech without my axis lock, since it isn't allowed
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:52:12 Not sure, I could go looking through my mech concept art folder to see if I can find any cool designs if you want
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:52:28 (Unrelated to this event, just came in handy now)
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:53:57 Here's a few that have more than 2 legs
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:54:31 They sound similar so idk which would be better, though more legs and a more grounded design would be more durable
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:54:48 Give them sword arms/claws
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:55:07 Yeah
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:55:24 I made a crab walker at one point, it was fun
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:56:13 I think if I'm gonna make a mech for the event I'll do a quadruped
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:58:01 Depends on the method of walking, pistons are slow but a pure motor design can be adjusted
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:58:18 Jumping spider
events-chat 2022-01-20 07:59:11 I've made bipedal mechs capable of reaching a 60-70 sprint speed
events-chat 2022-01-20 08:13:57 Grabbing stuff is kinda deadly, especially with cutters since it would either just get stuck on the weapon or be cut in half
events-chat 2022-01-21 01:40:19 Japanese spider crab
events-chat 2022-01-21 02:21:57 Bipedal crab? That means two legged
events-chat 2022-01-21 02:22:17 Fiddler crab is what you're looking for
events-chat 2022-01-21 02:22:52 I think fiddler would be neat, just snip off the enemy mechs legs

events-chat 2022-02-04 19:38:03 What would the benefit of making an attacking bomber over a fighter? Swivels aren't allowed so it's basically just a fighter
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:38:42 Also what counts as looks like a plane? Does it have to be modern, ww2, future
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:41:47 And what constitutes a plane? Wings?
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:44:12 ._.
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:45:45 I know what planes are normally, but in an event such as this there could be a lot to constitute what that could be
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:47:12 I'm just trying to understand what  counts as a plane so I know what I can build
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:48:32 With the kinds of things I build that's not specific enough, I don't want to build something that ends up not being allowed
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:48:56 I make scifi things
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:49:56 So it just needs to *look* like a plane?
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:50:54 I'm not trying to be quirky, I was just asking what counted as a plane
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:52:33 I know what a normal plane is, it was the question of what still counts as a plane
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:54:21 All I asked was what was considered a plane in this context, not to be insulted
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:54:37 You've hurled more insults at me than advice
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:56:08 I wanted to build something more abstract so I asked about what counts as a plane, I'm not as into making normal planes and also didn't want to just slap wings on something
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:57:08 I'm no good at making normal planes so I wanted to make something that I could make and that I'd like more
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:58:20 I still want to, I was just seeing how far I could make it into scifi
events-chat 2022-02-04 19:59:17 I know the difference, it was me asking what counts for *this* event
events-chat 2022-02-04 20:00:09 It says it needs to look like a plane, it didn't really specify which is what made me ask the question in the first place
events-chat 2022-02-04 20:02:57 I'll build something I enjoy building but ill keep it within the boundaries of looking like a plane

There, I just wanted to figure what I could do and still count as a plane

I'm done here as I didn't want to be insulted and harassed over a question about what would count as a plane in this event
events-chat 2022-02-04 20:04:23 It was mainly Alx now that I'm looking back
events-chat 2022-02-04 20:06:40 Even if I dont get selected it still give me a reason to build something
events-chat 2022-02-04 20:09:20 That's what I'm doing, even if I'm not selected I'll still have a reason to build something I like
events-chat 2022-02-04 20:11:12 I'll build what I want, maybe I will be selected, maybe I won't but I'll still have a build that I enjoy using
events-chat 2022-02-04 20:13:28 Evasive maneuvers for dealing with anyone behind, above, below, to the left, to the right, in front and in the 5th dimension
events-chat 2022-02-04 20:14:14 I dont know if I won't, I'll still try
the-dump 2022-02-04 20:47:44 
events-chat 2022-02-04 20:48:06 I'm gonna make a scifi plane, I'll ask here if it counts for it
the-dump 2022-02-04 20:49:18 
the-dump 2022-02-04 20:53:56 
the-dump 2022-02-04 21:00:53 Not always

plane-crazy 2022-02-06 05:03:18 Is there a way to get a locked motor to return to its shorter state after being turned
plane-crazy 2022-02-06 05:05:52 Is there a way to get a locked motor to return to its shorter state after being turned?
plane-crazy 2022-02-06 05:06:21 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-02-06 05:06:27 How
plane-crazy 2022-02-06 05:06:34 Wdym?
plane-crazy 2022-02-08 09:10:00 The two games I know of that have custom vehicle making and suspension both have a similar glitch relating to the suspension and end up with the same use

The two games are plane crazy and scrap mechanic, they both have a suspension glitch that rotates builds when power is applied
general 2022-02-20 22:22:06 I doubt it cause it's a new game but will data save from pc1 to pc2
general 2022-02-20 22:22:54 I meant a separate game
general 2022-02-20 22:23:52 So my builds will transfer right?
general 2022-02-20 22:24:01 Yessss
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:25:06 Even if I dont end up making one, would a torpedo with a rope attacked like a harpoon be allowed? Like a cutter based torpedo that launches off, deals damage and pulls back in with the downside of no explosives cuz it would make them one time use anyways
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:32:04 It might if the cutter blade had some for of spin
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:32:20 But yeah, I've noticed that ropes mess with cutters weird
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:32:37 Spinning cutters can be surprising
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 07:32:49 Does camera lock save?
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:32:58 I'll try some tests
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:33:16 It's an interesting concept
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:33:39 Maybe it would work better if there was a way to trigger a spring or something as soon as it made contact with the enemy
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:34:25 Detectors would be neat in this game, like something that activated adjacent blocks
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 07:34:29 Oof
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 07:34:53 So all camerw locks need re done when loading in a build, good to know
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:35:23 Like motor lock through it?
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:36:02 It would take timing but could be interesting

An Armour piercing weapon to immediately blast the internals would be effective, especially if there anything important
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 07:36:30 I haven't been either, I was just making sure
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:36:48 Oooh, Armor piercing harpoon
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:37:23 Stick into the enemy and reel them in so they're an easier target for allies, maybe even whatever other weapons are allowed on the torpedo ship if any
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:39:05 It's more likely to happen the less blocks are there, motor locking several blocks through (Maybe with gaps in between as failsafes) would help insure it staying in for a good while
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:39:25 Only issue would be they'd be harder to re-use since motor lock can't be re locked
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:40:06 But I think being able to grab an enemy would be really cool
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:41:57 Depends on how thick armor is a double motor lock might suffice, with the hook thing on the end attached to a text block
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:42:39 That would be cool, maybe the harpoon could somehow inject/allow a form of attack onto the enemy ship
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:45:38 Maybe the ship using them could have extra frontal armor as well as armored harpoons, just a few seconds of immobility might be all that's needed to deal a deadly hit on an important part
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:46:13 I might try
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:46:44 Or at least make designs to share with others, I don't do too well making outright good ships but I'm pretty good at making gadgets and such for them
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:47:00 Maybe if I want to ill make a harpoon design to share
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:47:55 Yeah, that's one idea, reel in one's with explosive so you get the most out of them or hook people with them and pull the entire ship in
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:48:52 Probably some kind of controller, I thing it would he kinda funny to have a device that moves it around erratically, maybe with cutters on it for the payload
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:49:26 Not even accurate control would be needed, just something chaotic that makes moving really irritating
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:50:38 Imagine trying to fight some dude in an airship and he shoots something at you, doesn't deal any damage with it but then tour airship decides to start making a U turn upwards
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:51:01 Lmao
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:51:44 A motorlocked RAT would be neat, something that gets bigger and locks into place inside the ship by unlocking to expand
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:52:20 Just put cutters on the RAT and let it go chaotic inside the ship, eventually it'll mess up something important
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:53:52 That actually got me to laugh, a mass motorlock that destroys the turrets and overweighs the ship causing it to sink
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:54:10 Wait

Do ballast blocks Increase weight?
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:54:29 Like the ones that change weight
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:54:50 Not the ones that you set a certain weight to, I mean the ballast tank things
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:55:20 And I'm assuming that if a ship touches the ground it's considered out right?
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:56:02 If so

Ballast tanks that are set to light until injected into the enemy ship, upon which they are increased in weight and overpower the helium
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:56:38 Basically the equivalent of injecting lead into an airplanes fuselage
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:57:14 That'd be so funny to see if they didn't know what happened, they'd just have their ship drop like a rock or at least become extremely off balance
events-chat 2022-02-21 07:59:36 I like the idea of injecting a ton of weight into a ship or a controller to cause chaotic movement

Harpoons could be fun but also lead to being close to an enemy
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:00:20 I think cutters should only be allowed on torpedos or very limited amounts on the bow of a ship to act like what would actually happen if you rammed a ship
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:01:39 It's all fun and games till 3 of the attackers manage to fill the dreadnought with weights/RAT's and cause it to sink (it would be hard to pull off but would look kinda funny)
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:02:00 Yeah I can't build Yo momma
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:02:38 In the Injections or dreadnought?

If it was in the dreadnought then it would still be immobilized
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:03:22 How
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:04:02 More weights, or more RAT's with more power
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:04:32 More RAT's probably

Go ahead and try to shoot the stuff inside your ship
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:04:58 Maybe a motor locked expando bomb to really reach everywhere
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:05:44 It could expand through the ship and have tnt spaced enough to reach everywhere in between the spaces without need for excessive tnt
events-chat 2022-02-21 08:07:08 If I dont make a ship I'll at least try to come up with some designs for torpedos and stuff
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 08:24:51 I really want a way to be able to trip weapons using contact with enemies
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 08:25:04 Is there a way to make tnt deal 0 damage?
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 08:25:33 If it explodes on contact and somehow releases a motor lock it could be automatic
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 08:26:04 Like when the tnt explodes it let's the motorlock contract which when placed properly could thrust something forwards
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 08:26:34 Allowing for a weapon that injects something into the target without needing to do it fully manually
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 08:51:18 While testing my ideas I found a new glitch
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 08:51:43 A permanent anchored block without the need of an anchored block once done
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 08:52:20 It anchors the blocks in place, even if they're just a normal blocks
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 08:52:48 I could jump and climb on them but they wouldn't budge
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 08:53:29 Could be an interesting way to make a permanent air base that doesn't risk losing its anchor block
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 08:53:57 Even toggling the anchor block off once the glitch happens doesn't change it
events-chat 2022-02-21 19:36:48 I'd presume touching the ground is you're out
events-chat 2022-02-21 19:37:55 Im gonna try to make a torpedo that automatically peirces the enemy ship to inject some form of payload into it
events-chat 2022-02-22 10:06:12 Does the torpedo zep get anything other than torpedos?
events-chat 2022-02-22 10:08:04 The torpedo description didn't say no guns but I still wanna make sure
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:31:01 What does your grappler look like?
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:31:46 How are you planning it to work?
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:32:45 Hover drive?
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:33:04 Toggled motorlock?
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:33:23 Ah
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:34:05 I tested a harpoon version that used a harmless explosive to release a motor lock
events-chat 2022-02-22 21:34:25 It sometimes pierced but wasn't the best
events-chat 2022-02-22 22:59:56 Yesss
events-chat 2022-02-22 23:00:21 Little planes
events-chat 2022-02-23 02:14:23 Do the destroyer and torpedo get turrets or are the guns fixed?
events-chat 2022-02-23 02:14:57 For floating
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:28:10 Maybe use motors and wing panels as air brakes, just rotate the wing panel to a vertical position to slow down and horizontal to resume speed
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:29:53 You fool
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:33:52 How
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:34:30 Classic blimp
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:35:15 Needs more flair 😎
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:35:48 Yes they specified that

events-chat 2022-02-23 05:38:59 No u
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:40:04 What class
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:40:31 Yes I think
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:41:07 Ah, I understand why you said it'll one shot the dreadnought, you'll still need to have good aim
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:41:23 No pobsem
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:42:25 Yeah but these are unguided
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:42:43 What if I stole yours first?
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:43:30 I have a pair of pliers and a bucket of determination, that's not gonna make me back down
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:44:15 Unguided missiles are terribly difficult to keep straight, I've attempted to make several before and so have other people I know
events-chat 2022-02-23 05:45:42 Nice
the-dump 2022-03-01 19:29:59 McDonald's messed up my order 😡
the-dump 2022-03-01 19:31:18 I ordered 3 sets of ribcages and 4 spinal columns, they ended up adding several skulls and hip bones with legs still attached
the-dump 2022-03-01 19:42:23 It's such an easy order, at least the time machine wasn't broken so they could get the Dino bones but the shrink ray made some of them smaller than others
contest-chat 2022-03-02 16:45:28 I have the same question
contest-chat 2022-03-02 16:45:54 No clue
contest-chat 2022-03-02 16:46:32 
contest-chat 2022-03-02 16:46:50 So yeah, basically military vehicles
contest-chat 2022-03-02 16:47:25 Bonus points if we somehow make infantry for it to release?

the-dump 2022-03-06 05:56:49 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 06:05:55 They do it with boats too
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 06:06:07 Basically
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 06:06:19 They also turn planes into anime girls
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 06:06:27 The internet is wierd
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 06:06:42 Like actual anthro planes
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 06:06:48 Not just girls in plane costumes
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 19:00:12 Does the large door in the mountain facility open anymore?
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 19:00:46 I'm clicking the buttons that say Doors and they do nothing
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 19:00:58 It's the only interactive thing near it
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 19:01:24 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 19:01:34 That's where the big door is
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 19:02:02 I could've sworn it used to open even when the lava spitter wasn't there
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 19:02:05 I'll try
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 19:03:26 There's no buttons on the outside
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 19:04:50 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-03-29 19:04:59 Thanks for trying to help though

bug-reports 2022-03-30 18:30:56 I was on this morning
bug-reports 2022-03-30 18:31:51 Before it glitches its physics are messed up, completely different than what it was before

bug-reports 2022-03-30 20:52:11 Other games are just fine
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 05:43:31 Is there a way to fix physics lag causing hover thrusters to be really unstable?
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 05:44:36 I have a vehicle that uses hover thrusters but now it's all wobbly and eventually just flips over
plane-crazy 2022-04-03 06:16:18 It's not really a tank, it looks like this

It doesn't normally wobble as much as it does now
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 20:24:14 Whenever I'm in a server that has another player In it my physics get wonky
plane-crazy 2022-04-05 20:30:57 Now that my friend left the vip my physics is back to normal
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 00:46:37 Is there any way to make something trigger when a player goes under it? Like a floating mine that somehow drops once a player gets under where it is
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 00:48:30 Like a perfectly symmetrical  cube?
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 00:49:05 Yeah that what I meant
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 00:49:19 It's tough for me to find the right words sometimes
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 00:49:31 I need help with this
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 01:04:28 Are there any ways to trigger a trap at range without needing to input any controls?
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 01:05:16 What about a way to make a floating explosive fall when someone goes under it?
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 01:05:48 Not even using glitches?
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 01:06:17 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-04-15 01:06:52 I've caused glitches that make stuff lose physics till touched, I just don't know how to reliably reproduce them
the-dump 2022-04-15 01:07:56

plane-crazy 2022-04-27 16:43:52 If i turn them off it works just fine
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 16:45:27 Macross are basically planes with legs I think
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 16:47:20 When my vehicle is moving *at all* rockets won't fire
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 16:47:23 They just vanish

plane-crazy 2022-04-27 16:58:16 Is there a fix?
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 16:59:00 Does it affect everyone or just specific people
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 16:59:18 So no one can use rockets while moving?
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 16:59:22 Bruh
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 16:59:29 What about vip
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 16:59:51 No rockets to shoot down shredders
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 16:59:54 Oof
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 17:00:01 When might it get fixed?
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 17:00:58 Last I heard that was probably gong to be a few months
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 17:01:29 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 17:01:52 I just got a new computer that can play PC without crapping itself and now I can't even pvp
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 17:02:08 Stuff takes time, I wouldn't rush him
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 17:03:16 The build shown in the video has been waiting to get tested in combat for almost a month now
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 17:03:40 I made it on March 31st
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 17:03:50 I have yet to take it into any combat
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 17:04:03 Does it skip leg day?
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 17:07:20 They both excel in their own fields
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 17:07:49 Flak is clearly better against tanks while the cannon one obviously is used to shoot down fighter aircraft
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 17:08:10 It's not a tank
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 17:08:57 Next yesterday²
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 17:10:34 My expert deduction has concluded that those are indeed not planes
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 22:21:17 Does the rocket glitch also affect fireworks?
plane-crazy 2022-04-27 22:21:29 It doesn't seem like they're firing
plane-crazy 2022-04-29 19:31:49 Is the rocket bug fixed?
plane-crazy 2022-04-29 19:32:04 I was on mobile last night and rockets were doing just fine
plane-crazy 2022-04-29 19:32:18 Even though earlier in the day they didn't work
plane-crazy 2022-04-29 19:32:59 I was on a private server and rockets worked fine
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 17:18:06 The the flat part of cutters deal damage? Like the part that is opposite the blade
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 17:18:22 Ok darn
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 17:18:42 Only 92? I have 125 😎
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 17:22:44 A pile of malformed biological material in constant suffering 😎
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 17:31:20 Yeah we definitely need more weapons
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 17:32:04 Like some kind of adjustable mortar/cannon, you could change the bullet drop, explosion and bullet speed
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 17:32:45 Depending on what you want you could get naval cannon type thing all the way to a mortar that you can lob over walls
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 17:52:11 Let's agree to disagree and call it yif
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 17:52:50 Promise?
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:05:19 Not really, it's only some that are actually bad
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:06:42 I'm not sure why people hate all furries
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:06:51 Every community has its bad apples
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:07:02 Doubt
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:09:00 
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:10:21 
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:13:19 That kinda but I mainly said it just to infuriate people
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:13:42 No I just get distracted and stay on the keyboard too long
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:14:29 I'm on mobile so the keyboard stays on when I'm not typing unless I actively turn it off
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:14:36 What's going on?
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:15:13 What's going on
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:15:29 Lmao
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:16:41 I would post a meme edit of one of my builds but seeing how much people dislike furry stuff apparently idk
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:17:05 I basically turned this into a furry
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:17:33 Not really
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:17:41 It's literally in the acronym
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:17:50 LGBT**Q**+
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:17:55 I'm in it
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:18:19 What is LG TV?
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:18:27 Not specifically gay
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:18:35 And barely any furry stuff over jokes
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:19:05 If it's what I think it is then you're just trying to be annoying by using a Brand
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:20:28 Gyf
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:24:05 That would be good for finding the rest of opm, I have prime video and it still charges money for shows *on a platform that I am already paying for*
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:24:26 No it's Yod
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:24:44 For the most part I agree but some stuff isn't there
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:25:03 Idk what draken is, drakken was my own idea
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:25:21 Oh no I've been doxed
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:25:46 Oh the ~~tank~~ plane
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:26:16 Someone showed me that at one point, I forgot about it but yeah I remember it now
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:26:25 I made my name before I knew about it tho
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:26:44 Idek where the X came from
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:27:15 I made my roblox account ages ago and It would cost like 10 bucks (since last I checked) to edit my name and remove it
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:27:38 I'd prefer just Drakken but roblox is annoying
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:28:22 Remember, yoyo is actually pronounced jojo
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:30:04 I hate mustard tbh
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:33:41 Wow
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:35:11 You mean you never mix your mayo with chocolate syrup and put it in the freezer to make ice cream?
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:35:58 No that's the topping
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:36:01 Smh
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:36:37 
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:40:40 Best way to get served your hotdog
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:41:14 There's nothing to even do with furries in that video
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:44:04 Eventually I'm gonna try going for robotic expert but I don't have access to my computer rn (no wifi to play)
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:44:24 And my old one couldn't handle large builds
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:44:46 Yeah I know
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:44:54 Mechs are annoying but I like them
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:45:07 No
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:45:48 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:48:13 I got my basic robotic specialist with an old terrible walker I had
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:48:19 Now I'm doing way better with mechs
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:48:28 Oh that's gonna be cool
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:49:16 I'm either gonna make a kaiju themed walker or some kind of metal gear themed thing
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 18:51:22 My current walkers are a small one that runs at what I'd estimate to be 60-70 speed (this is compensating for the up and down wobble) and one that walks way better but only goes like 10-15 speed
plane-crazy 2022-05-02 20:28:10 Ratio'd lmao
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:37:12 Not enough of a creation to post in creations but I made a neat little trick for toggleable text

All motors except for the one on the end of the piston are motorlock, that one can be powered for rotation and also be a motor 2 for controlled rotation using servo

The piston is set to 1.25 length and toggle
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:38:38 Can't really get a video on mobile easily but I've got these
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:39:03 Basically the piston extends and since motors don't have hitboxes on the smaller piece it can phase through
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:39:05 Same with the text
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:39:51 No problem
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:40:04 I was thinking of making a working computer boot up screen with it
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:40:23 But roblox won't let me change its text cause it's halfway dead
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:41:05 I don't think you need a high block count though I could be wrong
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:41:17 Small stuff gets posted a lot too
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:41:31 To post in <#384025409945337856>?
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:41:46 Where did you hear that?
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:42:12 The 2k minimum
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:42:26 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:42:36 Oh ok
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:42:44 Why can't you post it though
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:42:53 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:42:56 Nvm I'm dumb
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:43:08 You don't need the block count either
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:43:27 It actually says not to post images of block counts
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:43:51 Why?
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:44:03 Oh ok
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:44:20 So you're making it for the rank request thing?
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:44:39 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:44:58 I didn't have that context so I was really confused
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 04:45:18 Oof
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 06:44:15 Does anyone have a good looking rifle/gun design that uses fireworks as it's weapon?

I'm trying to make one for my mech but I can't make a good design
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 06:46:31 This is the mech in question, though I'm remaking it's arms currently
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 06:49:08 Like a metal gear?
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 06:57:32 I've got concept art for weapons, I  just can't translate those designs into plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 06:59:10 I've had that issue too
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 06:59:17 I think it's cause of bad connection
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 06:59:40 What's the most downvoted?
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 07:01:43 I can't make the concept art designs into good looking weapons, thus I am asking if anyone has their own design I could use/modify
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 07:05:15 It doesn't have to be perfect, just good enough
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 07:05:30 Just needs to look like a proper gun/cannon
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 07:05:40 Or grenade launcher idk
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 07:06:15 Motor lock isn't an issue either
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 07:07:26 If it means a better weapon I'll use it
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 07:08:11 Also I know that spinning rockets makes them faster and spinning guns causes spread, are there any other weapon "upgrades" that's are similar?
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 07:10:52 Yeah but it's fun for me
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 10:01:21 What's the best way to accelerate rockets

Spinning them with super thrusters is bulky and I'm curious if there's any faster methods
the-dump 2022-05-20 04:06:54 Skill issue

Banana for flex
the-dump 2022-05-20 04:08:06 Huh, it's clear literally everywhere else
the-dump 2022-05-20 04:08:25 Eliminate it
the-dump 2022-05-20 04:09:01 Crap
the-dump 2022-05-20 04:09:04 Umm
the-dump 2022-05-20 04:09:12 What else does America have?
the-dump 2022-05-20 04:09:38 Send an eagle after it
the-dump 2022-05-20 04:09:44 Give the eagle a deagle
the-dump 2022-05-20 04:09:59 Crap
the-dump 2022-05-20 04:10:04 Call florida
the-dump 2022-05-20 04:10:09 Get the Florida men
the-dump 2022-05-20 04:10:45 You gave the eagle a monster energy and some crack beforehand right?
the-dump 2022-05-20 04:11:10 Ok, I didn't want to have to do this

Use the Uno reverse card
the-dump 2022-05-20 04:12:06 Use more reverses
the-dump 2022-05-20 04:12:47 That's cringe
the-dump 2022-05-20 04:13:22 How are you supposed to protect yourself from American rifle rabbits?
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 05:26:01 Cutters arent working for me
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 16:13:41 If I had 1 layer of tnt armor would a rocket or firework pierce to the layer behind it?
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 16:14:00 Also are cameras also invulnerable
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 16:25:49 So cameras take damage from stuff, aight

What about rockets piercing a single tnt armor layer
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 17:25:16 What's Roscale?
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 17:55:52 Ah, I imagine that would be tough if you'd want detail
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 17:56:14 Time to make a roscale Rc car <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 17:57:50 It's a good idea
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 17:58:12 
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 17:58:45 The answer to that could be summarized with

"Yes"
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 17:59:15 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 18:27:01 Something I do want in pc2 would be a better way to make blades, rn for melee we only have cutters which are thick and ugly

What if there were blocks called Blades that were slightly thicker than wing panels and had a taper at the edge, they could also have delta versions similar to wing panels for better blade shapes
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 18:28:11 Unrelated thing

Cutters won't work on one of my mechs
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 18:30:32 Cutters are already hard to make good looking blades with, there could still be uses for Cutters but a more versatile bladed weapon would be good

My main gripe is how thick Cutters are, a thinner version would be useful
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 18:31:06 A saw right?
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 18:31:22 Ok, if I can get a thin cutter I'm all in
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 18:31:48 As of now if I want to give one of my smaller mechs a knife it has to look ugly
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 18:32:09 Because to stab stuff it needs a cutter on the end facing up
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 18:37:05 Anyways
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 18:37:21 Cutters aren't working on one of my mechs
plane-crazy 2022-05-25 15:02:12 what are pc2
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 01:25:23 Hey <@580095477471772698>, how did you get your giant thing to fit in the build plot? Did you have multiple accounts or does it unfold from a sheet?
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 01:25:39 It's one of the most impressive builds I've ever seen
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 01:25:55 And I just can't seem to understand how it's able to be so big
plane-crazy 2022-05-26 18:02:51 How do I prevent de-sync when I'm shot with a missile? My pvp is being ruined cause I turn invis or my opponent turns invis

general 2022-05-27 15:54:07 In an apple
general 2022-05-27 15:54:14 Why
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 18:55:26 Why do motor 2's glitch in water?
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 18:57:06 It literally just causes my mech to explode
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 18:57:29 My melee mech can't let its arms touch water
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:19:02 I just fought a mosasaur with my mech like a pacific rim battle
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:20:08 Was it a different person ot were you a helicopter I attacked? You have a familiar color scheme
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:21:24 "Hey delete this thing you've spent a lot of time and effort on because you haven't perfected it and made it to my idiotic standards"
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:22:23 Your mom probably compares you to some random kid to show what you should have been
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:22:48 I bet that kid doesn't tell people to destroy their hard work because it isn't perfect
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:24:20 Hey, we're you attacked by a mech earlier? Or was it similar helicopter I attacked
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:24:56 It would've looked like this if it was
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:25:12 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:25:53 I got in an argument with someone saying this wasn't a mech earlier
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:26:58 It's arms didn't move while I was attacking and it didn't walk
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:27:07 He called it a statue
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:27:31 Yep
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:27:35 Legs too
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:27:51 They have complex suspension in them to let them move along with the terrain
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:28:00 Makes ground combat easier
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:28:41 I didn't make it for looks but for combat
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:29:27 Also, this is my mech riding a space ship
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:30:11 Lol
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:30:19 Should I post it in <#384025409945337856>?
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:34:12 I posted it anyways
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:34:42 Idc if people don't like it cause it doesnt look good, it's made for combat and I made it look good for me
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:35:10 Yeah I was pretty close
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:35:14 Hold on
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:37:38 is this better?
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:44:08 I have another build that has a similar theme of looks after function

Might post it too
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:44:20 Although this is an old image
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:44:32 I'll need to get a new one since it's been edited slightly
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:46:39 No but people have mentioned similarities to a lot of different things
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:47:15 I see what you mean tho
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:47:31 But it was entirely unintentional for it to look like that
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:50:48 Nice wheels
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:51:19 My old builds got a surprising amount of upvotes
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 21:53:40 Yeah, it uses a cd emoji right?
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 22:51:01 Oh I might actually
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 23:05:25 this is the latest version of my dune raider, still looks like that ghost in the shell tank
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 23:43:25 I'm in a uncf group and this is what it is, I'm not trying to be accurate to the show
plane-crazy 2022-05-28 23:50:40 Yeah but I'm not trying to be accurate, this just adding the label for when I go into battles
creations-chat 2022-05-29 07:51:08 Agreed

My mech somehow got upvotes even tho it's looks came second and I'm pretty sure there's exposed motor lock
creations-chat 2022-05-29 07:53:35 This is my mech btw 

Nit pick all you want and I'll do my best to defend it <:trollface:775024642104229898>

Just no blatant toxicity

Response to BQ since cooldown long, I'll see if I can add weathering though I'm not sure how I'd do that, it doesn't have much space for detail unfortunately but if there's a way I'll try, plus I don't want it looking too dirty
creations-chat 2022-05-29 07:56:35 Same, they have good builds
creations-chat 2022-05-29 07:59:06 I focus on function over looks, my fenrir mechs back is pretty bad looking, but that's cause it needs space for some other stuff that helps it function 

I can fight most pvp server builds that aren't jets or covered in cutters or explosives

creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:30:20 He only uses it against shredders, plus one of the best ways to deal with them is just let them ram into your own cutters and kill themselves

Shooting them down works for the ones that don't have conv drives and people who use shredders against shredders are the only shredders users I'm fine with
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:34:09 If it's something like some of the shredders I've seen a tnt shotgun wouldn't work, nor would missiles and such

Kamikaze could work but anti shredders also work, they're basically kamikaze that doesn't kill itself immediately

They just rush from one side of the map to the other in an instant and destroy everything in their path, aiming is tough with stuff like that, especially when they go basically anywhere the mouse is

The main issue with tnt shotguns is aiming at them before they shred you
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:37:00 For the smaller ones I fight with my combat vehicle, but as soon as they start using conv drives and stuff it becomes nearly impossible

Idk how they do it but I've seen at least three big shredders that use some form of hyper speed drive
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:40:04 Cutters still seem to work above those speeds, I've got a flying mech that goes that fast and it can still melee

It actually cuts better at high speeds

Also yeah, they're either children or people trying to feel good about doing well in a game

Dodging them is sometimes easy sometimes hard and some people don't always have the device or skill to deal with them
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:42:17 De spawn it, I'm curious

Wait I'm dumb

Unless you edited it after but idk

How much tnt?

Bruh gonna blanket the sky

Yeah that's gonna cover the sky

Got an image of it firing? (From before you're away)

If it crashes the game it still stops shredders

I know someone who made what was essentially a server off switch

Near instant server crash
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:45:55 Dear lord

That would work in non pvp servers <:trollface:775024642104229898>

I actually suggested he use headless pistons on his anti shredder but it crashed his game as soon as I touched it, in his defense it did discombobulate my mech

plane-crazy 2022-06-03 08:15:18 Rope could be fine for some things but not what I'm looking for unfortunately

plane-crazy 2022-06-10 14:22:54 Ah
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 14:34:23 Would adjustable motorlock be good enough to be an inventor rank thing? I've made a motorlock design (not anglelock, this is vertical) that can work similar to normal motor lock as well rope and suspension, basically allowing for phasing parts inside eachother with accuracy for the perfect distance
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 14:35:03 When was that said
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 14:36:33 But where, I'm pretty sure the mods just stopped talking about it cause basically no one got it
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 14:38:16 Nvm found it
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 14:39:54 I found a more recent one already
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 14:45:33 Earlier this year I tried asking about the inventor role (didn't know it was canceled) and the only reason they said no seemed to be that someone else had made it before 

They didn't mention it was canceled
plane-crazy 2022-06-10 14:47:02 Looking through the dms with them just reminded me I made a powered ball wheel at one point
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 14:34:54 Wait how does it pierce?

plane-crazy 2022-07-26 23:57:56 Looks like either a missile carrier or self propelled artillery
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 23:58:01 Oh small
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 23:58:34 Tankette
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 23:58:48 Small, armored but not a full fledged tank

plane-crazy 2022-07-26 23:59:35 Often armed with machine guns
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 00:00:45 I still need this question answered btw
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 00:01:14 Maybe try a few designs? Artillery could look good on it but a tankette would too
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 00:01:48 I'm pretty sure I've pussed people slightly with magnets before, they just didn't pull
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 00:02:29 Tbh I'd just like it if you both had to half weld magnets to get it to work
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 00:02:46 No pulling in, just gotta touch the magnets while they're turned on
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 00:03:23 What's a good way to carry one build on/inside a different players build without glitching?
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 00:03:37 Or just combine player builds in the firstplace
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 00:04:55 There's gotta be some way builds can attach
plane-crazy 2022-07-27 00:05:48 Not even perfectly, just enough for it to be carried

plane-crazy 2022-07-31 05:41:40 Like motor
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 05:41:43 With spring
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 05:41:49 Rather that linear
plane-crazy 2022-07-31 05:42:51 Those don't work the same as what I need
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 05:37:34 Why do anchor blocks break cutters
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 05:37:45 Even after un anchoring they still break
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 05:37:50 I can't use cutters
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 05:52:02 Is there a way to stop anchor blocks from ruining cutters
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 05:52:55 I've got something that needs an anchor block but also needs to use swords
plane-crazy 2022-08-02 02:16:48 Why do motor 2s freak out in water

plane-crazy 2022-08-02 02:43:16 Do you have anything similar?
plane-crazy 2022-08-02 02:58:11 I wanna see what something like that can do, my mech can dominate a server pretty well (aside from water cause of motor 2 glitch)

plane-crazy 2022-08-06 21:21:07 Anyone got a good turret design for a tank of this size? (I'm waiting to add detail till I get a turret)
plane-crazy 2022-08-06 21:22:05 Had to take the screenshot on mobile
plane-crazy 2022-08-06 21:22:30 I'm not at my pc
plane-crazy 2022-08-06 21:22:56 On mobile screenshot quality is crap for some reason
plane-crazy 2022-08-06 21:23:16 I need an actual design, I'm not good at turrets
plane-crazy 2022-08-06 21:24:27 I most likely wouldn't use the base turret, I just can't get the function or shape right
plane-crazy 2022-08-06 21:24:44 And I'm getting worn out cause the hull was annoying to make
plane-crazy 2022-08-06 21:29:37 I'm not going for that level of detail, I just need to decent looking functional turret
plane-crazy 2022-08-06 21:29:45 I've already tried making my own
plane-crazy 2022-08-06 21:37:49 I don't want stuff with a bunch of motorlock, the hull already has a lot of moving parts in it and the more I add the more likely it is to glitch
plane-crazy 2022-08-06 21:41:39 For me i can't easily work on big stuff
plane-crazy 2022-08-06 21:42:10 I'd rather make small stuff that is packed with gizmos or function
plane-crazy 2022-08-06 21:43:48 Idk why but it's to the point that I feel like my builds aren't functional enough if they have empty space

plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:25:51 WIP transforming legged tank thing, wasn't easy to make it look smooth before transforming
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:27:18 I already gave it a turret, its like a SAM
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:29:31 Surface to air missile, though it's actually a surface to surface missile
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:29:49 Like dual missile batteries
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:30:29 It looks like a SAM, not that it is
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:30:48 I meant it looks one
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 15:34:09 The turret wasn't my focus though
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 16:06:49 Not really, I may try and add something like that in the future though
plane-crazy 2022-08-10 16:22:41 I'm a bit worn out on transforming systems right now, the legs were hard enough
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 14:13:14 That was the hardest part, I wanted it to look like a normal scifi tank. All of its parts use a pretty large amount of motor lock and at least 1 piston per segment
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 14:13:56 Tank with legs
plane-crazy 2022-08-11 14:23:56 Give them legs

plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:02:48 Darn
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:02:54 Why not?
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:03:41 A mod or admin would probably know more
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:03:53 Cuz I have something that may be fit for it
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:04:13 I've shared what it does before but not the design
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:04:38 Yes, inventor rank needs to be something new and useful right?
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:04:56 I'm not sure the exact requirements
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:05:40 Not the best example but I'll get a better one later
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:05:58 Motorlock but in even smaller increments
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:06:33 Imma get a better example rq
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:06:51 I'm only gonna share how if it is actually worthy of the rank
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:08:20 Motorlock but adjustable to any height
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:08:24 Not just half block increments
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:09:25 Nope
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:09:31 This can clip blocks
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:09:36 Like motor lock can
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:11:19 I'll share it if it's worthy of inventor, if not then I'll probably keep it in the group I'm in
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:12:20 I could dm it as long as you don't share it
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:12:48

plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:45:27 My design is a bit more controllable than that, it also isn't too big once set up
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:46:10 Bruh I'd rather not show everyone who asks
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 18:46:58 Still, if it isn't (which it may not be) then it'll be out and about and I won't be credited officially

plane-crazy 2022-08-28 22:56:49 I'd be upset if my stuff was stolen
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 22:57:17 It's not 10 blocks I know that
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 22:57:53 It's still someone's build, it had effort, even if it wasn't a ton put into it
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 22:58:25 Instead of debating over how many blocks it has let's just ask the owner of it
plane-crazy 2022-08-28 22:58:52 I'd feel the same if mine was stolen

plane-crazy 2022-09-06 08:32:04 In the first one
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 08:32:27 My mech is so small a rocket hit from anywhere will kill me
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 08:32:48 My mech is literally 60% motorlock lmao
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 08:33:00 Lots of stuff crammed in one spot
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 08:33:14 Only around 80 total parts tho
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 08:33:23 I also have to worry about balance
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 08:33:48 Undefeated in its size class

Cuz its the only one in it that can fight
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 08:33:55 It was!
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 08:34:33 I wouldn't call the mech simple but ye
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 08:34:47 The end product is somewhat simple I guess
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 08:34:55 But making it involved so much pain

the-dump 2022-09-08 01:18:01 There are literally greek myths about it
the-dump 2022-09-08 01:18:07 It existed all the way back then
the-dump 2022-09-08 01:19:12 The hate crimes don't come from parades
the-dump 2022-09-08 01:20:41 Such as?
plane-crazy 2022-09-08 01:22:52 I think I actually missed a 3 as well, it's 2302023
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 05:29:25 Can cameras be destroyed by guns/rockets?
plane-crazy 2022-09-24 05:34:07 Okay, cuz at some point I had heard they were like tnt just invisible
plane-crazy 2022-09-28 00:29:16 Are tnt blocks the only block immune to guns
plane-crazy 2022-09-30 00:52:00 Put wing panels farther back or add weight in the front
the-dump 2022-09-30 00:54:46 You just gotta wait a few years, don't worry you'll get there
plane-crazy 2022-10-06 18:04:07 Do all sides of a cutter deal damage?
plane-crazy 2022-10-06 18:09:30 Oki good
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 22:42:17 Do weld magnets need to attach to other magnets or could it be any of my parts?
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 22:44:07 So I could attach it to a ball wheel or something right?
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 02:37:51 What's the blast radius of a legacy tracking rocket
plane-crazy 2022-10-26 14:08:52 For? I still don't know the blast radius 💀
help 2022-11-02 19:02:39 Motor 2 is broken in some builds
help 2022-11-02 19:02:54 One of my previously functional builds is suddenly broken
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 02:00:07 any idea when motor 2 physics gets fixed? Roblox did a physics update or smthn and now some motor 2s are broken
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 02:02:32 They don't seem to effect everything, but one of my main vehicles is completely broken by it and so is someone else I knows thing
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 02:09:03 Thing is, the build worked just fine before
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 02:09:11 But recently it won't work at all
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 02:15:29 It's kinda tough to show, basically it makes it wobble back and forth
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 02:16:08 I have it hooked up to a locked motor to use it to limit the rotation
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 02:16:17 Which worked fine up until now
creations-chat 2022-11-04 02:20:32 Its not a creation either
creations-chat 2022-11-04 02:22:54 Not really
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 02:27:52 The issue seems to have something to do with max angle as it doesn't break when it's set to 0
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 02:46:06 What?
creations-chat 2022-11-04 16:01:20 Yeee, people are using my mech frame tut!
creations-chat 2022-11-04 16:08:08 Because it's getting popular, though I still don't fully approve of a tut in <#384025409945337856> for obvious reasons
creations-chat 2022-11-04 17:08:42 It can be scaled up but I haven't made any larger versions really, I prefer smaller mechs 

In theory it would be pretty easy tho
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 17:11:15 The bug seems to be fixed
the-dump 2022-11-04 17:43:36 
plane-crazy 2022-11-04 21:03:03 It often happens when it touches water on certain builds, idk what exactly causes it to trigger tho
the-dump 2022-11-04 21:04:36 Free bird from horizontally spinning rat actually <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 20:21:40 I discovered a glitch that may or may not be anime 1000 slices moment
general 2022-11-24 21:54:40 Can I use weld magnets to attach to another players weld magnet?
general 2022-11-24 23:31:32 No! clearly not, because uhh
general 2022-11-24 23:34:36 Why
general 2022-11-24 23:35:25 🐴
general 2022-12-03 06:08:49 What game is that
general 2022-12-03 06:10:19 Is that liberty county?
general 2022-12-03 06:10:29 I didn't know it had voice
general 2022-12-03 06:10:50 Yes
general 2022-12-03 06:11:07 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-01-01 22:06:00 Punch
plane-crazy 2023-01-07 05:22:22 What?
the-dump 2023-01-07 08:24:53 Truly a curse, now let me post this original meme I found in what I'm pretty sure was a different server
general 2023-01-09 10:09:52 Akz is definitely sus
bug-reports 2023-01-10 23:18:18 I think that's an issue with ping/lag
bug-reports 2023-01-11 00:34:51 If you're laggier than normal it'll happen, sometimes it just does
bug-reports 2023-01-11 00:34:54 What's your ping?
creations-chat 2023-01-11 15:14:03 Does my mech look good?
creations-chat 2023-01-11 15:41:26 Imo it's a bit smooth, but yeah it isn't terrible
creations-chat 2023-01-11 15:44:38 Stability, also walking isn't as important when your mech flies most of the time, and it's also less effective in combat for more moving parts
creations-chat 2023-01-11 15:47:12 Nice, I'd recommend more texture/colors
creations-chat 2023-01-11 15:54:25 Wings don't look as good as actual legs and adding a walking system would just be more moving parts to worry about in pvp, which is mostly mid-air
creations-chat 2023-01-11 15:59:33 I try and make mine capable of combat in public pvp against non mech things
creations-chat 2023-01-12 00:10:47 Hover boots, though it doesn't have them anymore cause of issues caused by them, might remake them to fix it tho
general 2023-01-21 22:07:40 True!! I am one of alt
general 2023-01-21 22:07:53 He's not typing becuz he logged onto me!!!
general 2023-01-21 22:09:58 A human sacrifice also works
general 2023-01-21 22:13:20 I doubt he has any tech aside from 3 grainy screenshots, bro probably hasn't even found ark tech
general 2023-01-21 22:14:07 He Gone silent again
general 2023-01-21 22:14:53 Can't wait for him to threaten to leak Ark tech
general 2023-01-21 22:15:47 Nah that's Arc, Ark is better overall
general 2023-01-21 22:16:38 No
general 2023-01-21 22:17:02 If he actually has spies he'll know what it is
general 2023-01-21 22:17:27 no
creations-chat 2023-02-22 18:32:34 I wonder if his Ratte is even his too
creations-chat 2023-02-22 18:36:55 At some point it's block count doubled too apparently, even though there aren't any new images or proof of these claims
creations-chat 2023-02-22 19:06:04 Any proof of this? Got any screenshots?
creations-chat 2023-02-22 19:12:02 You respond to this but not a request for proof?
creations-chat 2023-02-22 19:14:40 It should be simple, get a screenshot of it unloaded on your plot, maybe with a sign saying your name here or something, same with the star destroyer
creations-chat 2023-02-22 19:18:49 Screenshotting, same way you'd get proof anywhere else
creations-chat 2023-02-22 19:21:08 Lol, all I saw was the N slur however I have a feeling he used a lot more than just that in the first one
creations-chat 2023-02-22 19:23:53 Power button and volume down
bug-reports 2023-02-22 19:25:58 Lol
creations-chat 2023-02-22 19:32:21 Probably anti seeing as they are stepping on the flag
creations-chat 2023-05-26 00:50:50 Which glitch
creations-chat 2023-05-26 04:50:21 Like give them physics? Whilst still building?
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:37:23 Vip server cutters don't seem to be working, among other things
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:38:16 I do mech combat so this has kinda messed it all up
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:38:32 And overall it's acting weird
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:38:37 The game I mean
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:38:56 If you mean shredders, yeah
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:39:08 I hate em, I hunt em
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:39:46 Pub pvp seems to work ok with cutters, though physics does feel a lil wonky
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:40:00 Locked motors also go silly sometimes
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:40:48 Like if I unlocked and re locked a motor it flung me no matter what
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:43:27 Idk any good ranged anti air
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:43:33 I just melee them
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 20:14:15 I'm pretty sure sometimes you can get fast enough the numbers just vanish
bug-reports 2023-07-06 00:57:06 Yay vip mech pvp again time to be a little terror
bug-reports 2023-07-06 01:20:07 Hi hi
