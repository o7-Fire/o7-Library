plane-crazy 2018-11-26 17:55:23 I made a thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 17:55:29 does it look good?
creations-chat 2018-11-26 17:56:12 Su-37 Replica, 248 blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 17:56:20 It's a Su-37 😠
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 17:56:53 F-18 doesn't have canards
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 17:57:08 I balanced it perfectly, so it flies in a straight line
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 17:57:17 it has 6 engines, 4 normal ones, and 2 functioning as afterburner
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 17:57:27 it can hit 350 in a straight line easily
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 17:57:31 and it turns decently
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 17:58:01 Su-37
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 17:59:55 I just noticed I submitted my creation wrong

creations-chat 2018-11-26 18:08:38 I did not post the first one correctly
creations-chat 2018-11-26 18:17:32 Ohno
creations-chat 2018-11-26 18:17:43 I have build an aircraft using displacement of cg to move
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 18:41:52 I tried to make a thing, warning ears
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 18:42:08 Basically you control the craft by shifting the cg
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 18:42:18 and for some reason the super engines decided to make this weird sound
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 18:42:20 what is up with that
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 18:43:25 good tip
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 18:43:39 https://streamable.com/875go
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 18:44:25 but seriously
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 18:44:27 why is this sound a thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 18:44:38 it's the third time I have had it
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 18:47:12 yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 18:47:15 thought so too
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:26:42 why are the engines so underpowered in this game?
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:44:42 I made another thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:45:03 inspired by the XP-55 yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:45:08 or J7W2
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:45:19 XP-50 is a twin engined design
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:45:38 J7W2 was not loud because it never flew afaik
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 19:45:45 J7W1 flew, with a propeller

plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:03:13 I am going to build a Ho 229, I hope I can show it before I log off
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:03:42 <:thonking:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:10:27 okay update on the 229, I have a cockpit and engines now, no wings or landing gear yet, it broke the sound barrier
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:13:58 NOOOOOO IT DISCONNECTD ME
creations-chat 2018-11-26 20:50:02 [Canard style fighter] [Potloodairflyer] [186 blocks]
creations-chat 2018-11-26 20:50:08 it work!
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:53:03 Horten 229 V3 test flight, ca 1945
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:53:16 god this thing is nose heavy
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:53:45 just 8
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:53:53 all set to full density
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:54:00 and I can barely keep it up
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:54:07 it flies terribly
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:54:18 nearly as bad as my spitfire
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:54:34 I want a thick wing
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 20:54:45 so most of it will be panels, but a lot will be blocks to give it structure
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:00:48 ohhhh G.91
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:00:50 I need to make that
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:01:20 oh wow
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:01:23 that looks awesome
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:01:38 Paint it like frecce tricolori!
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 21:26:19 ohshit it actually flies
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 12:16:52 Or add ballast to the front
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 12:16:57 Force it to go down
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 12:17:08 No
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 12:17:14 That is how to balance an aircraft
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 12:17:55 If it is too nose heavy, reduce the ballast on the front
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 12:18:16 Then keep test flying and fine tuning until it flies nice and straight
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 12:18:21 Not that hard
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 12:18:52 Replace blocks with ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 12:19:14 Ballast blocks are blocks with adjustable weights
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 12:19:30 Under the cog tab
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 12:21:15 But do you follow aerospace engineering at one of the top 10 aerospace engineering universities? <:thonking:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 12:21:21 /r/humblebrag
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 12:22:07 Ethan, you can either place the wings more forward, or add some ballast blocks to the  back
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 12:22:22 You can adjust the weight of the ballast blocks using the purple screw tool
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 12:24:58 1 that is false
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 12:25:18 2 that is not really a valid argument
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 13:13:40 wait, am I just in a really old server, or are a lot of blocks gone
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 13:13:43 like the delta wings?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 13:13:45 or beams?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 14:07:51 wooooh I finished my Ho-229
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 14:07:59 so unstable to fly
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 14:08:00 but it is fun

plane-crazy 2018-11-27 14:20:39 ''no''
creations-chat 2018-11-27 14:39:41 Yes I actually made the Horten 229
creations-chat 2018-11-27 14:39:46 Flies terribly
creations-chat 2018-11-27 14:39:57 For some reason when banking left, it turns right
creations-chat 2018-11-27 14:40:03 But it flies
creations-chat 2018-11-27 14:40:14 Which was my goal
creations-chat 2018-11-27 15:02:22 oh lol, we just were in the same game
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:11:05 I am building a B-25
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:11:08 I have build the bomb bay
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:11:22 and now I am too distracted by playing with the bomb bay to build the rest of the aircraft
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:17:43 You can if you use two blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:17:50 otherwise a single 1x1 block would do the same thing
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:17:56 2 blocks space
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:17:59 half blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:18:04 I do play minecraft
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:18:12 and I know what you mean
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:18:26 wood slabs cannot stack on top of stone slabs ie right?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:25:10 B-25 is starting to take shape
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:28:56 I'd use some glass wedges there to make it look smoother
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:29:27 I wouldn't make it completely flush
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:29:32 at least the front window as a wedge
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:29:43 that would help a bit
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:29:45 I think
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:31:49 I'd maybe use half blocks for the engine covers?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:31:52 they look pretty big right now
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:32:09 you could also just use a larger engine
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:32:19 gives off more power, and it takes the same amount of space
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:32:21 yes I can see that
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:32:27 the engines right now look huge
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:32:32 that is why I said use half blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:32:53 kek
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:32:58 I currently am building a B-25
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:33:01 428 blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:33:08 not a single engine or wing piece has been added
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:33:22 I am guessing mine will be around 1000
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 15:33:33 bai
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:49:33 I have a piston set to extend 4 blocks, but it only extends 2
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:49:40 NOW MY LANDING GEAR IS NOT WORKING
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:50:30 WHAT
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:50:34 IT WENT 4 BLOCKS EARLIER
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:50:40 IT DID
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:50:42 I SAW IT
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:51:19 imma load another plane and reload
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:52:23 I am angry now
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:52:27 I need 4 blocks of piston
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:52:32 and I don't have space for 2 pistons
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:52:34 maybe I do
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 16:53:51 double pistons work
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:14:23 is it just me or is the eternal day mode broken with the lighting?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:15:23 day mode lighting overall seems to be bad
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:15:33 the lighting is very dark
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:18:54 quick fix!
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:33:28 wait kratos we just were in the same game right?
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:33:33 I was the guy with the gigantic B-25
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:34:49 for those interested in the B-25
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:34:56 So far I have a working bomb bay, front gear and engines
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:35:08 most of the interior is done, outside of decorating, currently working on the side gears
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:36:03 I have other stuff to do tomorrow, so I hope I can finish at least the landing gears in 1.5 hours
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:36:12 But so far I have like 5 hours put into this B-25
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:36:22 and I loved every single second of it
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:36:38 I can be a slow builder
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:36:47 especially because it has to be perfect
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:36:53 it is not boring if you switch doing stuff around
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:36:57 build a part of the aircraft
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:37:00 build something mechanical
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:37:01 test it
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:37:08 screw about for an hour with the mechanical part
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:37:13 build another part of the aircraft etc
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:39:29 not yet
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:39:34 going to put in some rockets as bombs
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:39:44 but I need the bomb bay now to get into and out of the aircraft
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:39:46 have yet to build a door
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:39:59 B-25 and dive bomber
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:40:01 you wot
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:40:14 that
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:40:18 just make the rockets face down
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:40:24 oh you mean a bomb swing
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:40:35 like on the Ju-87 or SBD
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:40:43 could do that
plane-crazy 2018-11-27 19:40:46 but first this B-25
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:04:45 Crazy planes?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:05:04 I mean Simple Planes
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:05:29 Cool game
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:05:55 Don't u know how to read
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:06:09 I asked a question about what game
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:06:15 And your answer was my i9 came
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:06:56 I want to know now
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:07:10 No stop
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:07:15 Don't even want to talk anymore
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:07:17 Bye
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:07:55 I have been addicted to War Thunder the last  5 years
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:08:12 So that is where my time is gone
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:08:50 Heroes and Generals tbh
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:09:13 The grind though
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:09:21 Oof
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:10:10 Oof ouch muh kay dee
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:10:31 Agree tbh
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:13:22 I signed up for Enlisted and Armoured Warfare closed testing, got into both yeeeee
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:13:49 Armoured Warfare then kinda died when the publishers fired the developers
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:13:58 And Enlisted is still not really done
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:14:11 I am ignoring all of you and just talking to whomever
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:14:20 1000 IQ play
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:14:49 Roblox is not a game but a platform on which developers can share games tbh
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:15:16 Is that a plane flying over?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:16:43 What do we want?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:16:47 Plane sounds!
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:16:51 When do we want it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:17:01 NNNNNNEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWwwwwwwww
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:17:31 Dis
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:17:55 Also we need to be able to toggle control surfaces to create flaps and airbrakes
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:18:16 And binding controls to a certain seat, so you can fly a plane, and a buddy can sit in a gunner seat and shoot
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:18:25 I mean working flaps
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:18:34 That actually create extra lift
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:18:39 Wait wot
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:18:43 Tell
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:18:44 Nao
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:19:06 What?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:19:14 I meant a toggle option
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:19:25 So that you don't need to keep pressing the key for flaps
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:19:28 But just once
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:20:02 Also we need a stiffness slider for pistons, because right now they act like suspension, ruining my so far 1100 blocks B-25
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:20:25 Mitchell tbh
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:21:11 That would be called a howitzer
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:21:47 P-108B with a 102 mm gun in the nose
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:21:48 Ahaa
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:23:42 No?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:23:51 The AC-130 does not have rockets?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:24:13 It has a big howitzer, I some 20 mm mini guns and something else I think
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:24:32 Could be
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:24:35 But not rockets
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:24:51 Yep vulcans
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:29:47 There is a reason I said "I think"
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:29:56 Because I know I can be wrong😉
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:31:21 I said, "it has a howitzer, some 20 mm mini guns and something else I think"
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:32:14 It was 25 tho, not 20
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:32:20 I was wrong
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:32:41 I said 20
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 12:32:54 I guess
general 2018-11-28 12:33:05 Hai
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:06:29 IT ACTUALLY WORKS

plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:07:07 B-25
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:10:27 it IS  a B-25J
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:12:19 My B-25 has bomb bay doors and gear doors with extending and retracting gears
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:12:22 your point?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:13:24 I have working doors in my B-25

plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:17:40 need to make folding wing tips, because it does not fit
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:17:52 and I just have to keep adding super rocket engines in order to make it move
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:18:24 A350 tbh
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:18:46 A390 is not a plane right?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:18:59 oooohhh that is some good looking wing sweep
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:19:06 but

plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:24:26 it will happen
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:25:16 1m special
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:25:31 I have been playing for too long already toady
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:25:39 THIS B-25 HAS LIKE 12 HOURS OF WORK IN IT
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:25:40 aaaaaaaaa
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:26:16 nope
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:26:23 I made the B-25 an even number of blocks wide
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:26:30 so the turrets would be offset, so I decided against it
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:26:57 how
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:26:59 it barely has any space
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:27:03 i know that
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:27:05 but there is no space
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:27:15 I want looks over functionality if it comes down to turrets
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:27:51 Its not for pvp'ing
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:27:57 I build this because it is epic
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:28:07 1847 blocks right now
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 15:28:15 about 500 half blocks and 500 whole blocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 16:14:41 999k visits
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 16:14:46 so close
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 16:27:08 after about 14 hours of work, my B-25 is done, now all that remains is to paint it
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 16:27:14 anyone have any cool idea's for a nice paintjob?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 16:28:05 I'll try that one
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 17:23:18 Type the word
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 17:23:21 Hold it
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 17:23:27 Delet it
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 17:23:52 What a noob
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 17:30:15 Bai
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 17:30:31 🐊
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 17:30:54 Q
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 17:31:14 I am in a q to see that letter
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 17:31:17 Ahaaaaaa
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 17:32:12 Nobody?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 17:32:23 Okay
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 17:32:44 I'll just go to this corner and try not to cry
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:30:34 my B-25 actually flies
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:30:38 waduhek
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:45:41 I just about finished a plane consisting of around about 2000 parts
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:45:43 small enough?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:46:16 it lags out the entire server
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:49:33 I wouldn't bother
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:49:35 just use keyboard
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:49:40 gives better controls imo
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:49:47 ctrl and shift for elevator
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:49:50 w and s for throttle
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:49:52 q and e for rudder
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:49:59 and a and d for ailerons
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:50:13 the things that make you roll
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:50:36 they are the same as elevators, but they go on the main wing
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:50:41 same direction as elevators
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 18:51:06 in Crazy planes, when using automatic controls, you are using ailevators
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:33:14 wait is rickje still here and reading?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:33:23 because I have one thing really annoying
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:33:34 The pistons act like suspension and it ruins my B-25
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:33:50 It would be awesome if the pistons could have a stiffness slider
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:34:43 Gear out with the plane hovering in mid air
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:34:47 gear out on the ground
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:34:51 it just collapses
bug-reports 2018-11-28 19:36:04 I don't know if it is intended, but it really ruins my build
bug-reports 2018-11-28 19:36:17 gear out hovering
bug-reports 2018-11-28 19:36:19 gear out on the ground
bug-reports 2018-11-28 19:36:27 the pistons just collapse and cannot carry the weight
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:44:51 I am in a server with someone who made a freaking tsar tank
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:47:09 I just did a ~2000 block B-25
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:47:12 is that mega enough?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:47:30 it was only my 6th plane or so ;-;
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:48:24 epic catch
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:51:07 That guy that had a Tsar tank in my game?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:51:18 He also has a mobile ICBM launching station that can actually launch the missile
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:51:23 waddafak
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 20:41:15 don't think so?
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 20:41:21 someone on the test server says he isnt
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 16:54:11 Nooooo everyone will see that I am cheating
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 16:54:27 And that I am using multiple super rocket engines for propeller aircraft
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 17:51:32 it is impossible to talk about planes in crazy flight as roblox censores about every german plane there is
plane-crazy 2018-11-29 17:52:28 go commit no censorship
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 18:22:05 uhhhhh
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 18:22:36 I just joined a server ;-;
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 18:22:41 looks nice!
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 18:22:46 ohhhhh luxurious
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 18:22:50 how much for one?
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 18:22:58 I need a sky bathroom
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 18:23:38 I need an A-380 that is just a bathroom
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 20:07:39 wait does it have to be a plane that nobody else has build before?
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 21:08:31 caught in a landslide
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 21:09:20 and you ruined it
plane-crazy 2018-12-01 21:09:27 by singing the lyrics wrong
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:30:42 But what about electromagnetic properties of the magnets? 🤔
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:31:57 Simple
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:32:20 What about the electromagmetic properties of magnets?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:32:43 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:32:46 I know
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:33:19 I feel like NewDude is ignoring me
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:33:35 <:thonking:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:35:10 Geen scheldwoorden
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:35:22 That clear enough?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:35:58 I'd listen to mods anyway ;)
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:36:29 They still have the power to ban you if they think you are not going by the rules, whilst you think you are
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:36:45 One day my friend
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:36:50 Keep dreaming
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:36:55 And working hard
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:37:03 And someday you will own this server, maybe
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:37:59 "Heel veel" "Heel erg"
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:38:52 Someone needs to test magnets by moving them alongside each other
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:39:03 Is magnetic flux a thing in this? <:thonking:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:39:28 Because you could make an induction cooker that way and stuff
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:39:33 I don't
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:39:37 I am just speculating
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:39:43 Hmml
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:39:49 Add electricity and heat tbh
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:39:59 Will make magnets and stuff a lot more fun
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:40:04 Also rockets so be kewl
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:40:20 We'll see moople
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:40:24 I know it is alpha
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:40:32 I am pretty excited to see where this game goes
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:41:09 Loool I am sitting at home being depressed and I hate it and I just want to go back to school
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:41:32 Point a rocket downwards
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:41:56 Are you in a PvP server?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:42:01 Probably not
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:42:13 You can use blocks with a disconnector
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:42:21 A bit of imagination goes a long way
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:42:33 Use rockets
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:42:56 Put rockets on disconnectors and make them fire when they almost hit the ground
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:43:21 Or go to <#491710474786832394> and suggest it
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:43:34 Unnecessary ping is banworthy imo <:banhammer:507685761496252420>
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:43:46 Trap doors are gold
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:43:48 Good
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:43:57 Now I can add a nicer entrance to my b-25
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:44:51 Make a trap using trap doors <:thonking:509498568982134816>
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:44:58 And then trap people using the doors
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:45:18 And then add stairs because they are a trap
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:45:25 And only moople will get that one
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:45:34 Uhhh slash
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:45:49 You just said that you hadn't done anything wrong
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:45:59 But that comment is incredibly uncalled for
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:46:48 Do it, and get a kewl rank
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:47:08 Also make it big enough
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:47:17 And get lag specialist
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:47:20 Then it is modeller
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:47:24 Not after that comment
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:48:04 Wrong
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:48:15 School is the best time of your life guys
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:48:17 Honestly
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:48:19 Spend it well
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:49:02 Don't be afraid to ask for help and such
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:49:11 That's what teachers are for
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:49:41 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:50:01 Depends on the subject
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:50:11 Maths, physics etc sure
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:50:30 What subject?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:50:46 Also <#497142796961054721> seems better for this
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 10:50:58 Okay
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 11:35:24 Make your own doors then u noob
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 11:35:38 You can
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 11:35:47 I made landing gear doors for landing gears
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 11:36:13 Yeh
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 11:36:16 I made those
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 11:36:21 They are very doable
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 11:36:38 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 11:36:45 Nearly flat
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 11:36:58 Keep in mind that wedges don't stick on all sides
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 11:37:08 Only on the sides on which they have surfaces
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 11:37:28 Learn how to use wedges and you can make really nice doors
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 11:37:48 That are 90-100% flush
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 12:13:09 <@373585820436660226>
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 12:32:42 ~~I use single blocks to increase block count~~
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 12:33:11 also I prefer single blocks, because if something is wrong I have to replace just one block instead of more
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 13:43:10 awwww yis I have a working trimming mechanism
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 13:43:15 and ejection seat
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 13:43:18 woop woop
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 13:43:52 TOO BAD I MADE ONE ALREADY
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 13:43:59 with a cockpit cap that flips open so you can eject
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 13:44:04 also the cockpit cap can open normally
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 13:44:07 woop woop
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 14:11:23 guys
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 14:11:31 do I go with variable sweep wings?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 14:11:34 or with delta wings?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 14:13:00 or any other cool form of wings you can think of for a fictional fighter jet
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 14:13:39 it is going to be a canard style fighter
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 14:24:39 pls
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 14:40:38 hmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 14:41:29 P A I N T
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 17:39:59 U boot stands for untersee boot, which means boat under the sea
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 17:51:32 shhhh
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 17:51:34 no loud noises
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 17:51:45 the update is silent
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:28:07 wait what server is that?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:49:48 F
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:49:56 too late mah dude
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 18:50:01 F to pay respects for you
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:02:36 I am working on probably the most complicated landing gear yet
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:14:00 you can pin a build in mid air
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:14:07 whilst being in flying mode
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:14:09 pretty handy
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:14:14 but it can be quite glitchy
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:14:22 especially on larger builds with lots of motors and pistons
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:17:28 no
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:17:29 lock is a lock
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:17:35 as in, if the motor is not powered, it will not spin
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:17:47 so that gravity won't affect it when you are not using it
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:17:50 it works for me
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:18:19 idk then
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:18:24 it works fine for my builds
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:18:33 which are pretty big as well
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:19:39 me?
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:19:53 TBH I am just too lazy
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:19:57 if you want to see it, tell me
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:20:05 I can take some pictures
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:20:28 outside my knowledge
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:20:44 ARE YOU STEALING MY EJECTION SEAT DESIGN
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:21:11 no wait mine is different
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:21:15 I made it before trap doors were added
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:21:22 lemme get a vid of that at least
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:23:35 https://streamable.com/22i1l
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:23:36 look
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:23:44 works every time 10% of the time
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:24:01 it seems to be a bit broken now
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:24:10 so I will have to take a look at that
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:25:18 it used to work, and I did not touch anything
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:25:28 the cabin opens using a super rocket, and the ejection seat has a normal rocket
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:25:48 I have
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:26:07 the canopy is completely free to move, and can be opened normally using a rope and a lever design
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:26:26 the seat is attached to the plane, but get's disconnected with the same button as the launch
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:27:39 ohhh
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:27:41 another silent update
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:27:43 shhhhhhh guys]
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:27:52 I just got a pop up in game
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:34:39 you have 2 people in this world
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:34:48 people that are patient
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:34:53 and people that get offended easily
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:35:01 guess what category hectic falls under ;P
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:35:38 no hectic
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 19:35:41 you are not patient
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 20:11:34 B-36 nice
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 20:11:46 that's going to be triple folded wings
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 20:14:09 this game is not even out of alpha wtf are you saying
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 20:14:33 FlameV1 announces Plane Crazy 2
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 20:14:53 bonjour mesjeur
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 20:15:21 je ne parlais pas francais, so I will continue in english
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 20:16:35 uhhh
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 20:16:48 that paper would cover the surface of the earth
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 20:17:01 no
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 20:17:05 don't try
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 11:24:09 Seriously?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 11:24:18 I made an entire ejection chair system
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 11:24:38 The next update that comes along allows anyone to build one easily
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 11:39:29 Bai
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 11:50:15 so uhhhh RoboRail1 has been playing Nexus Blitz for 4 days now...
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 11:50:22 did he die behind his keyboard?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 11:58:31 honestly, half wedges in this game are the best
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 11:59:02 I would watch a yt video, and after 15 minutes jump once and go back to the video
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:20:29 nice

creations-chat 2018-12-04 12:42:12 B-25J  Potloodairflyer  2005 blocks  Request: Lag Machine, Master replicator (dependand on amount of likes)
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:43:01 I finally posted my B-25 in the creations chat
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:43:08 would you all mind giving it a look and maybe a like?
creations-chat 2018-12-04 12:45:55 A B-25 has 2 engines, a B-24 has 4
creations-chat 2018-12-04 12:46:08 this is a B-25 Mitchell, not a B-24 Liberator
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:46:41 also is custom made landing gear a good invention for inventor rank?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:47:00 with doors that are completely flush with the fuselage?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:48:31 shet
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:48:44 oh wait is should not be an irl thing?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:48:53 so my ejection chair and trimmable elevator also don't count ;-;
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:49:13 am sad
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:49:37 because half blocks give you thickness to wings
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:49:49 and you can use wing panels behind the half blocks to still generate lift
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:50:12 I'd like a replicator rank, but I need upvotes for that, don't I?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:52:29 and he left
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:52:32 I guess
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:52:55 sheeeeeets on the bed
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:53:02 pls updoot
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:54:17 the hardest part is not even making the airplane, it is getting the upvotes
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:55:46 wooooh I have updoots
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:56:08 wow rude
creations-chat 2018-12-04 12:56:44 the propellers are being spun by a motor yes
creations-chat 2018-12-04 12:56:57 but there are like 16 super rockets and 20 propeller engines hidden in the craft as well to make it fly
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:57:22 yeah, but the more upvotes, the higher the rank!
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:57:38 if I can get 10 upvotes, I get master replicator
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:57:47 I only need 1 more for expert replicator
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:58:02 not at all
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:58:10 but I mean, I invested a lot of time into building it
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:58:16 I'd like to get something out of it yknow
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:58:25 15 hours?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:59:01 wow giving me downdoots
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:59:04 y u gotta be so rood
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:59:20 dude you are already on your second chance, do you really think being so rude to people is going to help?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:59:28 if you don't have anything good to say, shut up
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:59:36 listen
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:59:43 I have nothing better to do with my life right now
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:59:45 literally nothing
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:59:47 so I might as well
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:59:50 yo
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 12:59:59 I know
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:00:02 and I am taking the bait
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:00:07 because I now have something better to do
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:00:19 and something better is taking the bait
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:00:25 thinking I play fortnite
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:00:27 lmao
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:00:45 if that is what makes you happy
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:01:08 cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:01:21 oh wait I have to act like I care because I play the game right
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:01:23 oh how dare you
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:01:26 that is so homophobic of you
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:02:00 that's good
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:02:09 learn from the master scrap!
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:02:25 wew homophobic much
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:02:33 I thought you weren't homophobic or racist or anything
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:03:04 who has a pfp that is being liked by who here?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:03:24 I have a profile picture I like?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:03:25 yeah
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:03:29 otherwise I would not use it, duhh
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:03:59 again with the gay comments
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:04:08 no inspiration for anything better?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:04:47 not enough to make them original instead of the usual 12 yo response <:dab:510869696791445525>
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:09:01 honestly, a TB-3 with flat wings would look really odd
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:11:43 nn
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:39:40 oh wow
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:39:45 I got 6 likes on my B-25
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:39:52 can I has expert replicator please?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:41:05 potatoe, can you give me the expert replicator rank for my B-25J (pics in <#384025409945337856>)
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:41:24 and lag machine rank
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:43:07 because a 2000 block creation does not enjoy having a lot of motors working at once
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:43:09 and it lags out
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:45:12 oof
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:45:56 have you ever considered joining a scouting group
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:46:06 I have been part of one for 10 years now, and it is a big part of my life
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 13:46:24 there is not a whole lot of sports going on, but you are active, and there are a lot of fun people to do stuff with
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 14:22:44 I has 6 upvotes on my 2000+ block B-25J now (4 more would be nice), can i get expert replicator rank and lag machine rank now?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 15:08:28 pretty sure the bigger the engine the stronger
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 15:08:35 not sure where the super rockets fit into that though
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 16:25:40 ohhh I need one more like on my B-25J to get 10 likes...
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 16:25:47 somebody be a good samaritan
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 16:26:16 well thank you!
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 17:03:58 My B-25 is stuck on 9 likes 😡 <:okbuddy:518518403686989856>
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 17:05:18 Nice
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 17:05:30 Wait till you add more blocks
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 17:05:39 It will become a lot less smooth
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 17:05:59 To the point of not closing properly
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 17:06:11 My b25's bomb doors work perfectly
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 17:06:14 But not when flying
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 17:06:21 They somehow tend to get jammed
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 17:06:28 And one is slower than the other
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 17:06:48 Thanks roblox
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 17:20:01 Uhwut
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 17:52:05 I HAVE 10 LIKES WOOOOOOOO
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 17:54:25 is there any mod that can give me the ''Lag Machine'',  ''Master'' (designer category), and ''Master Replicator'' ranks?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 17:54:50 or will I have to use T H E   P I N G ?

plane-crazy 2018-12-04 19:42:07 you might want to up the quality instead of taking an image that has been posted and saved 1000 times
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 19:42:14 it ot
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 19:42:50 ^
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 19:42:55 nah
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 19:43:04 mods are cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:16:55 If her age is on the clock, then make sure she doesn't get a cold because she's not wearing a sock?

plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:18:50 Ahaha
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:19:04 HOW BIG DO YOU NEED THAT KEY
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:19:15 We need a "drag" tool honestly
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:19:59 I made a spitfire
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:20:04 I do not want to show it
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:20:12 It looks bad and does not want to turn
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:20:17 It's bad
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:20:19 Really bad
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:20:46 Post a pic in <#504436696021204992> and we'll see
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:21:21 Spitfires were called spitfire because of how their engines would spit fire upon starting
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:21:27 Looks so cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:21:35 Those flames from the Merlin engine
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:21:49 HOW CAN YOU NOT LIKE SPITFIRES
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:22:02 GO COMMIT LIKE SPITFIRE
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:22:20 Oof spam
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:22:26 Flame
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:22:32 You are disgusting
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:22:41 Nice spitfire!
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:22:54 Well then flame
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:23:02 What aircraft do you like?
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:23:09 It looks a lot better than mibe
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:23:12 Mine*
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:23:19 How does it fly
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:23:24 Not on PC right now
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:23:30 Like what
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:24:24 Quickly, grab lador!
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:25:04 Ferrous bird of prey
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:25:21 Umwut is this
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:25:30 OwnO
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 21:26:00 OwnO he is here
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:03:55 I think it is time to worry about RoboRail
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:03:59 This is not healthy
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:09:28 Or add some ballast blocks at the back
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:09:37 And tweak them
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:10:09 Ballast blocks add weight to a certain part of the aircraft
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:10:17 Allowing you to move the centre of gravity
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:10:25 Their weight can be adjusted with the wrench tool
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:10:55 Sadly the yellow ball's position does not update when changing the weight, so you will have to adjust, test fly, and adjust again to get it right
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:11:10 The centre of lift is determined only by the wing panels and control panels
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:12:41 What?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:12:55 It does
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:13:05 The centre of lift does change
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:13:21 Go to PvP, get a wing shot off  and you will enter a flatspin
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:13:28 I have had it happen
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:14:25 If the COL is at the back, the nose will be pushed down
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:14:32 So you add weight to the back
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:14:52 A flatspin is where your aircraft is yawning at excessive rate with near to no horizontal speed
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:15:04 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:15:10 Autocorrect
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:15:12 Excuse me
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:15:25 Heck yeah learning is cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:16:04 Kek
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:16:10 I am not allowed to say that
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:16:27 We need a flight computer block tbh
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:16:32 And a autopilot block
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:16:42 And also a targeting computer block
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:16:52 But pretty sure all of that has been suggested
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:17:22 We need stall mechanics
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:20:51 Check the controls of the control panels
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:21:00 With the screwdriver tool
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:21:43 Uhhh
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:21:54 Check if your engine placement is symmetrical
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:22:13 Put the ballast blocks to the max, and fly it
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:22:22 You will notice a difference
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:22:36 I can also use physics speak
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:23:06 Have you checked if T is aligned with the movement axis of the aircraft?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:23:37 Also run some static calculations to see if the aircraft is statically determinant, and kinematically determinant
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:23:41 T is thrust
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:23:48 L is lift
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:23:51 D is drag
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:23:53 W is weight
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:23:55 No
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:24:00 Because that is too much typing
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:24:20 We don't do mass
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:24:37 We want to know the gravitational pull we have to overcome, not the mass
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:24:41 The mass is not a force
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:24:43 Weight is
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:25:14 Because I need to eat
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:25:21 Stay alive people
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:25:28 It's important for survival
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:26:18 But did you know that lift can be calculated using the formula L=Cl*rho*S*V^2
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:26:35 And since W=M*g, and L=W
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:27:04 So M x g = Cl x rho x S x V^2
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:27:06 Yes
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:27:20 I build a spinny thing the other day
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:27:26 And it did not want to topple over
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:27:49 Is it stable?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:27:57 No
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:28:01 Because it flips over
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:28:47 How fast are the rotors spinning?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:29:05 Also stop calling them missiles, they are rockets
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:29:08 They are unguided
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:29:25 Wait
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:29:31 How guide missiles?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:29:33 NANI
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:29:36 THE
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:29:38 FUDGECAKE
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:29:46 You wot
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:30:06 How do you know they locked?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:30:56 Waoh
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:31:07 You learn something new every day!
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:31:56 Torps could be cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:32:07 But then we need actual bombs as well
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:32:35 Just dumbfire bombs
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:33:12 TSAR BOMBA
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:33:27 Ahaaaa Fritz X
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:33:34 One of the first guided bombs
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:33:44 German weapon
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:33:50 From wwii
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:34:25 Rockets are never guided
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:34:28 Missiles are guided
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:34:35 And I am Dutch, not German
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:34:38 I am insulted
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:35:16 I want stall mechanics so I can get into flatspins without losing a wing
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:35:31 Nonono
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 11:35:41 You can drop 'bombs'

plane-crazy 2019-01-23 14:31:59 admiral kusnetzov?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 13:42:46 <@478024687364997131> you said you wanted afterburners in suggestiond rite
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 13:42:53 This can actuallybemade pretty easily
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 13:43:04 Just place your engine
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 13:43:11 Put rockets behind the engines
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 13:43:22 Set the engines to on/off mode only
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 13:43:27 And put a fitting key for them
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 13:43:40 As ling as you hold the key you will have working afterburners
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 13:43:51 Release the key and the afterburners will turn off
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 13:43:54 Easy
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 13:45:44 You can do a lot of stuff if you sit down and just think for a moment
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 13:45:57 Not doing that does NOT make you a noob
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 13:46:20 r/iamverysmart
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 13:47:39 Your username is quite fitting for you
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 13:50:11 Nice and simple

plane-crazy 2019-01-24 13:58:35 No more problems
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 13:58:56 r/iamverysmart
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 14:00:02 Make twin engines aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 14:00:16 Or make contrarotating props
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 14:00:24 Or counterrotating?
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 14:00:27 I never know
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 14:01:12 Add ballast blocks in the middle turning the other way
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 14:01:19 Or don't put torque on the moror
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 14:01:38 But rather have the propeller propulsion be on the propeller itself as in engines
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 14:02:20 Ik
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 14:02:24 And they had torque
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 14:02:33 And some used offset rudders
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 14:02:40 Or some rudder trim
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 14:02:47 Which you could try to recreate
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 14:02:53 With motors on the rudder
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 14:03:06 They would place the rudder at say a 5 degree angle
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 14:03:22 Look up thw BTD
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 14:03:30 you might be able to see what I mean

plane-crazy 2019-01-24 14:05:54 But I got asked so often that it became boring
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 14:06:09 So I answered something else to not give them the satisfaction
plane-crazy 2019-01-24 14:06:17 Because I am evil like that

plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:36:51 I am not in it
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:36:57 but I prefer it to random servers
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:40:22 I build them to looks

plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:42:09 dude calm down with the insults
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:46:59 perhaps you have lost your drive
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:47:03 just go building
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:47:04 delete it
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:47:07 and build it agin
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:47:10 untill you are happy with it
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:47:37 not enough deleting
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:48:13 build something incredible
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:48:15 DELETE EVERYTHING
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:48:19 and build it even better
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:48:44 first you build something bad
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:48:45 you delete
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:48:47 rebuild
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:48:54 it becomes something no longer a sore to the eye
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:48:56 you delete
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:48:57 build again
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:49:03 it becomes something you can look at
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:49:06 then it becomes okay
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:49:13 then it becomes acceptable
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:49:24 then you realise it was shit all along and completely delete it, start another project
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:49:43 then you abandon the other project and come back to the first one with completely new ideas
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:49:53 I wanted to make a CH-47 Chinook
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:50:15 this is what happened to my CH-47
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:51:04 only 24 blocks from the cockpit survived
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:51:12 and a lot of those were deleted as well
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:51:29 build a UFO that looks like a spaghetti monster
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:51:32 with wiggly spaghetti
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:51:35 no
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:51:40 just build a spaghetti monster
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:51:42 use ropes for spaghetti

plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:53:24 with a gigantic radar or smth for missile interception?
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:54:14 I am making a spaceship
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:54:23 just figured out that wing panels work great for flooring and walls
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:54:37 meaning I can give this thing an interior rather than filling it with wings
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:54:56 no your boat
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:55:29 spaceship
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:56:27 he has the big ahaa moment
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:58:52 can we just
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:58:56 airbus a360
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:59:23 fun fact
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:59:31 a cessna 152's wing surface is 152 squared feet
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:59:42 and a cessna 180 has 180 squared feet of wing surface area
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 13:59:54 and that works for all single engined cessna's
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:01:09 Can we just
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:01:12 boeing 2707
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:01:45 oh gawd
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:01:46 but
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:01:53 the 747 is too big for good profits
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:02:00 and supersonic is too expensive for good profits
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:02:02 HOW TO BANKRUPT
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:02:41 KLM woop
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:02:58 well chinese shit would be 3x as expensive then
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:03:11 with 737 engines?
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:03:17 GE90 is madness
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:03:24 isn't that a 7777777777777777777777777777
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:03:43 that's not a 747 airframe tho
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:03:48 NO
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:03:54 I LOST CONNECTION
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:03:57 AND I HAVE AUTOSAVE OFF
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:04:06 AND MY LAST SAVE WAS A LONG WHILE AGO
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:04:13 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:04:50 I ragequit
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:05:00 FUUUUUUUUK
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:05:47 y'all ever just
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:05:50 ragequit roblox?
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:05:56 in a building game
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:06:22 WELL THEY STILL EXIST
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:06:32 shiiiiiid
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:06:38 at least I know what I had build
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:06:42 so less thinking is required
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:08:05 my B-25 takes half my space
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 14:08:08 but I am not removing it
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 15:54:09 I do have my motors sometimes opening doors and stuff whilst flying
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:27:50 Ummm
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:28:02 What is this new server icon?
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:28:46 But can we just talk about the server pic
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:29:08 But yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:30:19 Can I atleast have a bigger version of the server icon so I can see what it is?
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:30:40 Re
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:30:48 But why
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:31:36 And then silence
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:32:27 Bit late
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:32:50 Do you have a vertical stabilizer?
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:33:22 Is it a heli?
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:33:47 When you make the blades spin faster, more torque is put on the motor
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:34:00 You have to counteract this increase in torque
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:34:02 Or
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:34:40 You can get rid of the torque problem by making the motor unpowered, and adding engines to the proppeller blades
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:36:13 You can add engines to the inside of the blades
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:36:18 Rather than the outside
plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:36:21 Which makes it look okay

plane-crazy 2019-01-25 21:40:29 Please cease
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 11:38:06 Has anyone made the heli from airwolf yet?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 11:41:21 Imma go try to make airwolf
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 11:42:44 Airwolf is a supersonic Bell 222 with hidden weaponry
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 11:42:50 I believe it is also stealth
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 11:45:50 The official vip server expired
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 11:46:30 to what?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 11:47:55 ohhh wow
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 11:48:03 beware of what?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 11:48:40 oh lawd
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 12:18:58 vip server empty
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 12:19:20 many sad
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 12:22:50 so come have some fun
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 13:09:55 big hmmm
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 13:13:31 how do swashplate though?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 13:15:02 I tried making a chinook
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 13:15:15 this is what I ended up with
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 13:56:50 the bottom one feels smaller
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 13:56:58 so I'd go for that one
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 13:58:13 y nobody in the vip server ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 13:58:21 and as I say that someone joins
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:00:19 the creation I am making right now is cursed
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:00:31 this is the second time I lost a large part of it because of saving issues
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:02:18 possible?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:02:19 yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:02:20 lag?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:02:21 yes
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:02:23 hotel?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:02:24 trivago
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:06:01 🦆
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:06:03 QACK
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:24:27 make it pointier
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:24:33 make a flying lance
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:24:50 make an  x-3 stiletto
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:25:33 ohhhhhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:25:35 I knew it was a thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:25:39 but I did not know how to do it
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:25:45 that can be very usefull
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:26:09 adding 10 engines
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:28:35 ohgodno
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:28:50 500?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:28:54 more like 5000
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:29:02 the pitch will  have to be incredible on that
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:30:50 red matter glitch?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:30:51 nani?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:32:11 red motors?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:32:22 what?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:32:25 those are not in PC
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:32:57 jet rockets and propellers
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:32:59 oh
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:33:02 then what happens?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:35:18 time to go Tu-114 mode
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:36:01 I said
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:36:08 **time to go Tu-114 mode**
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:39:16 SR-72 is not a prop plane tho
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:39:26 and neither is the SR-71
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:40:06 TU-114 meanwhile is a prop plane with the most powerfull turboprop engines ever used afaik
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:40:30 noooooooo
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:40:33 that's another thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:40:57 ummm
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:40:58 no
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:41:00 won't work
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:41:08 because Tu-144 is supposed to go supersonic
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:41:15 and going supersonic with propeller blades is a bad
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:41:25 hmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:41:32 Would be interesting
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:41:41 I think the engines would have to be reversed to pushers
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:41:47 because of the wing design
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:41:48 no wait
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:41:49 what
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:41:51 no stop head
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:41:56 tu-114 with tu-144 engines
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:41:59 thats an even bigger bad
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:42:04 that stuff will break
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:42:38 and break more than just your eardrums
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:43:28 I doubt the wings could even carry it
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:43:37 a concorde with supersonic transport wings?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:43:44 well I wonder what that looks like
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:44:01 ***maybe like a concorde because the concorde is a SST***
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:44:05 you did not specify that
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:44:13 I think that would look like a boeing 2707\
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:44:36 stop
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:44:44 you were so occupied with wether you could
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:44:48 you did not stop to think wether you should
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:45:37 the hindenburg is not a rigid body
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:45:52 the hindenburg takes it shape via pressure difference
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:47:52 fun fact about cessna single engined planes
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:48:02 the number stands for the wing surface area in feet
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:48:33 so a cessna 172 with cessna 170 wings would probably work just fine
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:48:39 god don't do that to the poor 109
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:48:50 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:48:55 707 with 797 wings
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:49:55 please check what the 797 is going to look like
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:50:38 I-16?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:50:46 no wait
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:51:04 Kalinin K-7?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:51:35 what about Tandem MAI?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:53:05 antonov A-40?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:54:02 stop being uncreative

plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:54:27 please take a look
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:54:28 thank
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:55:34 it looks like a lenghtened 757 imo
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:56:04 the who the what
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:56:33 what about
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:56:37 737 with 777 engines
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:56:42 <:THONK:527880803456122891>

plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:57:40 IMAGINE THAT POWER
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:59:05 737 MAX with 737-100 engines <:fingergun:532303441293344778>
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 14:59:59 777 with 737-100 engines
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:01:18 Hawker hunter with F-104 engines
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:01:21 oh lawd
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:01:29 that is just glorious if I think about it
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:02:17 not that big a fan of the F-14
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:02:49 P.1011 with Bell X-5 wings
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:02:51 oh wait

plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:03:52 oh lawd
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:04:01 that would be glorious
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:05:31 is this a silent hint that we should go to <#497142796961054721>?
general 2019-01-28 15:06:13 what about
general 2019-01-28 15:06:17 a 109
general 2019-01-28 15:06:19 with a 190 engine
general 2019-01-28 15:07:36 That's a P-40F
general 2019-01-28 15:09:28 twin P-40
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:10:54 I want to make a Kamov Ka-52 now
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:11:03 BUT I AM NOT FINISHED WITH MY SPACESHIP
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:11:52 idk what to do
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:11:57 also it is lonely in the vip server
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:13:04 it makes me sad
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:14:56 it is not working
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:16:09 how do make walk
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:16:27 please tell me how to make that tiny thing walk
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:16:46 my spaceship only turns left so far
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:18:18 I launched him into space with a jetpack
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:19:12 I deleted him
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:20:33 hy
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:21:16 I AM BUILDING A SPACESHIP
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:21:20 SPACESHIPS
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:22:37 https://youtu.be/7TYJyCCO8Dc?t=21
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:23:12 SPACESHIP
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:24:10 no
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:24:14 I am building my
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:24:15 very
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:24:16 own
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:24:21 ***SPACESHIP***
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:24:53 SPACESHIP
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:25:30 a SPACEHIP
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:25:36 heresy
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:25:40 M60A2
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:26:07 EVERYTHING
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:26:08 IS
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:26:10 AWESOME
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:26:14 IF YOU'RE PART OF A TEAM
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:26:19 *looks around the empty server*
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:26:20 oh
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:27:20 is it even doable?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:27:40 ban tbh
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:29:44 but have you considered this?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:29:46 SPACESHIP
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:30:10 my spaceship has one problem
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:30:16 I have no clue where to put a door or landing gear
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:30:59 slight problem with those idea's
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:31:08 it does not really have flat surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:31:52 actually
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:32:04 I guess I could do something like an exit at the top?
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:32:23 I know how to make stuff move josh
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:32:42 I have made stuff like custom made landing gears before 0.9 blocks were a thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:33:03 ik
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:33:09 just know what sides will and won't connect
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:33:20 tried that before
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:33:26 but they cannot pull a person inside
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:33:31 but that was before the maxforce update
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:33:38 let me retry that design with more maxforce
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:33:48 because I also have
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:33:51 ANOTHER SPACESHIP
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:34:22 I need someone to test it out tho
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:34:42 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:35:06 double bruh
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:39:53 bonjour
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:40:05 the vip server is so quiet ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:41:40 why are you so destructive
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:42:01 also why can I not see what you typed on phone
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:42:21 WHAT
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:42:22 HOW
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:42:34 teach me these magics
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:42:43 do it
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:42:57 do it or I will look it up and tell the entire server
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:43:04 if you are on mobile you cannot see what he types unless you click it
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:43:56 ||I now know the way of the magic||
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:55:22 woooh I made my first swashplate
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 15:55:58 and it is a lot easier than I thought it would be
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:02:49 pretty easy
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:12:48 it does the same thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:13:00 no wait
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:13:04 you're right
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:13:07 it doesn't do the same thing
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:13:08 shit
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:13:43 ya i know
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:13:45 I realise now
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:14:21 block the guy
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:14:23 do not respond
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:15:25 okay so
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:15:32 that is not the best swashplate around
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:15:34 but what about
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:15:40 a double rotor swashplate
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:18:28 it controls the pitch angle of a helicopter rotor blade based on it's position
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:18:46 so a blade in front of the heli will have a different pitch than in the rear of the heli
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:21:41 that too
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:23:13 I want to know how to build a swashplate now
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:23:21 but imma use this prop control system for my kamov
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:23:33 because contrarotating swashplate is hell
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:30:14 yeah I tried that
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:30:23 I get the general concept
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:30:33 but that is where it stays
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:37:27 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:37:31 I want to make a Ka-52
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:37:52 I AM NOT GOING TO MAKE A SWASHPLATE FOR A CONTRAROTATING ROTOR WHEN I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO DO IT FOR A SINGLE ROTOR
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:44:02 I am not using one
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:44:05 I am using a different system
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:44:41 scroll up
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:44:49 there is just one problem
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:44:53 the motors are unpowered
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:44:56 but there still is torque
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:45:30 no
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:45:36 I hate seeing the rotors stop mid air
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:45:54 they do stop
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:46:20 no
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:46:22 not cool
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:46:44 I mean
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:46:48 motors are either on or off
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:46:52 there is no inbetween setting
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:47:24 using the rockets to get all settings
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:47:32 a powered motor won't change speed
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:47:41 even if a force is enacted upon it
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:47:53 WHICH MAKES IT EVEN MORE ANNOYING
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:48:18 So i have unpowered motors
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:48:32 And add rocket engines to power the rotors
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:48:42 A nani the fricc
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:48:52 How make that
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:49:18 Fair point
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:49:58 I know how moments work ;)
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:50:08 I like physics
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:50:12 What
plane-crazy 2019-01-28 16:50:25 ||darnit||
