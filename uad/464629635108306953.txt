bug-reports 2020-06-23 05:11:14 the doesn't happen too often but happened to me like 3 times, or more. so basically sometimes when your game is a bit weird and you can't delete stuff and you have to wait a while before it lets you again(also a bug or just lag spike but it's not a lag spike for me) and when you place main pilot seat, you can place two and it stays there until you delete it though don't think it's too much of a problem. Though where you can't delete for a little is. It happens way more often and is very annoying
bug-reports 2020-06-23 20:05:23 <@!585513259822743553> that happens so commonly now it started yesturday and happens every half an hour or less

help 2020-08-11 23:12:41 ok
help 2020-08-11 23:12:45 
help 2020-08-11 23:12:47 this is how
help 2020-08-11 23:12:53 it's decently stable
help 2020-08-11 23:12:59 it's control able but
help 2020-08-11 23:13:06 it's good on heavier helicopters
help 2020-08-11 23:13:14 it works well on my transport
help 2020-08-11 23:13:25 I am
help 2020-08-11 23:13:57 add a motor here
help 2020-08-11 23:14:14 so it can move
help 2020-08-11 23:14:23 oh
help 2020-08-11 23:14:27 bruh
help 2020-08-11 23:14:39 then don't

help 2020-08-11 23:15:18 lemme show you
help 2020-08-11 23:15:23 how to do it step by step
help 2020-08-11 23:15:46 place a motor that's not powered
help 2020-08-11 23:15:55 put a block on top
help 2020-08-11 23:16:15 surround the block with motors
help 2020-08-11 23:16:21 <@456226577798135808>
help 2020-08-11 23:17:40 add your props (it works best with 4 blades but 2 blades work fine)
help 2020-08-11 23:17:45 2 blades produce a lot less lift
help 2020-08-11 23:18:15 meaning you will have to have faster rotor rotation or angle your props higher
help 2020-08-11 23:18:16 ok
help 2020-08-11 23:18:20 lemme show you how to power it
help 2020-08-11 23:19:55 like make the canopy bigger
help 2020-08-11 23:20:21 add super rocket engines on the end or
help 2020-08-11 23:20:44 
help 2020-08-11 23:20:54 you can do this but I recomend putting on the end
help 2020-08-11 23:21:03 it looks much better for me and it spins faster
help 2020-08-11 23:21:09 the bigger the heli the more rockets
help 2020-08-11 23:21:19 also you need a helicopter to make it fly
help 2020-08-11 23:21:34 put rockets on the heli to make it move
help 2020-08-11 23:21:44 > Idk how to make a bigger canopy
<@456226577798135808> rebuild it and make it bigger
help 2020-08-11 23:22:56 btw angle it like this to make it to pitch
help 2020-08-11 23:24:11 that's it you will have to mess around with the weight of the heli a bit
help 2020-08-11 23:24:12 ohh and
help 2020-08-11 23:24:14 one more
help 2020-08-11 23:24:16 very
help 2020-08-11 23:24:21 very important
help 2020-08-11 23:24:36 put helium on the top and ballast on the bottom it will stablize it self a bit
help 2020-08-11 23:26:19 lock it
help 2020-08-11 23:27:13 I've never tried doing this but maybe experiment adding control surfaces to the blades to control or stablize it
help 2020-08-11 23:27:18 probably doesn't work but
help 2020-08-11 23:27:20 idk
help 2020-08-11 23:27:47 it takes a bit of experience to fly it
help 2020-08-11 23:28:01 but after 15-30 mins you can get good at it
help 2020-08-11 23:28:24 for smaller helis it tends to just spin a bit
help 2020-08-11 23:28:40 k
help 2020-08-11 23:28:45 good luck with it
help 2020-08-11 23:28:56 ?

creations-chat 2020-09-19 05:38:44 I like how you used rops
creations-chat 2020-09-19 05:38:46 ropes*
creations-chat 2020-09-19 05:38:47 but
creations-chat 2020-09-19 05:38:54 they are supposed to be straight
creations-chat 2020-09-19 05:39:00 you can use locked motors and motors
creations-chat 2020-09-19 05:39:02 to rotate
creations-chat 2020-09-19 05:39:27 > That's not really good enough for me Kai.
<@!681140863845269602> I agree

creations-chat 2020-09-19 19:10:10 how
help 2020-09-19 20:52:54 I need help motor locking
help 2020-09-19 20:53:45 since half triangle wedges up don't exist and I tried adding another motor lock but didn't work
help 2020-09-19 20:54:38 yes
help 2020-09-19 20:55:39 so do you know
help 2020-09-19 20:58:07 > tilted
<@!720751430595772418> also that's not helicopters work
help 2020-09-19 20:58:30 either add a swashplate or add a second rotor
help 2020-09-19 20:59:15 
help 2020-09-19 20:59:23 it's not that complicated
help 2020-09-19 20:59:31 ok so
help 2020-09-19 20:59:34 lemme explain
help 2020-09-19 20:59:48 you know how a swash plate works right
help 2020-09-19 21:00:03 ok lemme explain
help 2020-09-19 21:00:05 so basically
help 2020-09-19 21:00:17 let's say theres a motor connected to the helicopter
help 2020-09-19 21:00:20 it has a rod
help 2020-09-19 21:00:36 I mean 4 rods but they all connected
help 2020-09-19 21:00:48 and theres a bearing at some point
help 2020-09-19 21:01:12 it can spin and can also tilt
help 2020-09-19 21:01:28 when it tiltes, the bearing still spins and tilts at the same time
help 2020-09-19 21:01:34 so let's say
help 2020-09-19 21:01:42 the bearing is tilted to the right
help 2020-09-19 21:02:03 it will change the lift of the blades each time it spins
help 2020-09-19 21:02:09 it's kinda hard to explain so lemme give you a video
help 2020-09-19 21:03:14 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN1BV11hVzI you can also take a swash plate tutorial but they're all bulky and big
help 2020-09-19 21:03:27 I would make my own
help 2020-09-19 21:03:39 but if you can't try to find a tutorial
help 2020-09-19 21:03:46 then make your own
help 2020-09-19 21:03:50 it
help 2020-09-19 21:03:50 watch the video
help 2020-09-19 21:03:55 it's easy to understand
help 2020-09-19 21:04:05 may seem complicated but it's really not
help 2020-09-19 21:04:10 watch the video bruh
help 2020-09-19 21:04:20 ok I know any alternative
help 2020-09-19 21:04:29 with one rotor without any swashplate
help 2020-09-19 21:04:52 lemme make one
help 2020-09-19 21:06:58 red = unpowered motor yellow = powered motor
help 2020-09-19 21:07:06 make sure the controll on all of them for the powered motor is the same
help 2020-09-19 21:07:32 make sure the engines are pointed like this
help 2020-09-19 21:07:41 power the engine up all the time
help 2020-09-19 21:07:51 when you wanna go up or down press r/f
help 2020-09-19 21:07:56 or what ever controls you set
help 2020-09-19 21:07:58 I like using
help 2020-09-19 21:08:03 r to go up
help 2020-09-19 21:08:05 f to go down
help 2020-09-19 21:08:13 shift and control to throttle the engines
help 2020-09-19 21:08:29 it's not very stable but it works if you want 1 rotor
help 2020-09-19 21:08:34 if you want it to be stable
help 2020-09-19 21:08:43 add helium on the top of the helicopter and ballast on the bottom
help 2020-09-19 21:11:03 oh and when you are landed make sure the rotors are pointed down
help 2020-09-19 21:11:23 you can stop the rotors but it looks cooler with it spinning
help 2020-09-19 21:11:33 and it doesn't move as easily
help 2020-09-19 21:11:40 since it being pushed down
help 2020-09-19 21:20:26 nvm don't need help anymore I got it
help 2020-09-19 22:20:32 uh you built it wrong
