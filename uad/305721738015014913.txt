plane-crazy 2019-03-05 01:49:29 Loudest Instrument in the Orchestra. If we focus on just the instruments within a standard orchestra, there are two front-runners: the trumpet and the trombone. More often than not, the trumpet is the easiest to hear despite hitting a lower decibel range than the trombone.
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 01:50:20 nah the loudest instrument is modern singers without auto-tune
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 01:54:14 screw all yall
Piano is the best instrument
Piano: Melody, harmony, Accompaniment, chords, high tempo play.
Sax: Accompaniment, light harmony
Trumpet: Accompaniment , melody , harmony
plane-crazy 2019-03-05 01:54:58 if you have the breath to play megalovania in 3x speed on a trumpet, which i am capable of, you can go right ahead. heh

help 2019-03-09 21:44:57 
help 2019-03-09 21:45:01 it worked better but tilted quicker

help 2019-03-28 21:57:47 (packed mode)
help 2019-03-28 21:58:23 Neato. its my third build so im going all out.
help 2019-03-29 16:02:54 Alright... so i have an issue
help 2019-03-29 16:03:48 i have this build which is meant to be a compactable aircraft, which i'll later develop into a mecha-airplane transformer.
help 2019-03-29 16:04:01 Problem is i cant get a good mechanism to deploy the wings.
help 2019-03-29 16:04:07 this is the compact mode.
help 2019-03-29 16:04:07 
help 2019-03-29 16:05:05 i tried deploying the wings and it seems to break every time despite having clearance
help 2019-03-29 16:05:19 
help 2019-03-29 16:05:33 alright.
help 2019-03-29 16:05:45 on the plus side
help 2019-03-29 16:06:47 emergency parachutes work like a charm.
help 2019-03-29 16:06:54 
help 2019-03-29 16:07:16 it also has a handy 'weight reduction feature.'
help 2019-03-29 16:07:31 
help 2019-03-29 16:07:34 heh
help 2019-03-29 16:10:18 ah
help 2019-03-29 16:10:38 i think i've realised why this wont fly
help 2019-03-29 16:10:56 i think its because center of lift doesnt change even if you move the wings.
help 2019-03-29 16:11:12 hm
help 2019-03-29 16:11:20 i need a fix for this. Not sure what to do then
help 2019-03-29 16:22:12 how do i fix this??
help 2019-03-29 16:22:19 motors keep goofing up
help 2019-03-29 18:34:44 How does this look so far? making a spacecraft. Featuring passenger compartment ejection system. PCES .
help 2019-03-29 18:34:55 
help 2019-03-29 18:45:54 so it has one issue
help 2019-03-29 18:46:01 cant get lift & i cant find the center of lift either
help 2019-03-29 18:49:07 it just needs LOADS of speed
help 2019-03-29 18:49:07 it flies now.
help 2019-03-29 18:49:20 i took 6 super rockets to even get it to start moving an inch.
help 2019-03-29 18:49:24 jesus
help 2019-03-29 18:50:09 Eject worked beautifully though
help 2019-03-29 18:50:15 
help 2019-03-29 18:54:23 this is what it takes to get lift. Jesus.
Any way i can reduce this at all?
help 2019-03-29 18:54:59 nvm even with this it cant lift
help 2019-03-29 18:55:08 i need to add more controls maybe.
help 2019-03-29 18:55:22 could helium blocks reduce weight?
help 2019-03-29 18:55:24 hm
help 2019-03-29 18:56:04 lets see what 6 helium blocks can do.
help 2019-03-29 18:57:58 ah, i forgot. It has 2 flight modes. In Flight mode 2 it can get lift, but not enough. 
Flight 1 & 2 spread the boost & a lil bit of magic inside that adjusts weight
help 2019-03-29 18:58:08 i need flight 1 to take off however.
help 2019-03-29 18:58:32 This is flight mode 1
help 2019-03-29 18:59:04 square arrangement, weight is put forward to back (only cos i need to build the front still)
help 2019-03-29 18:59:28 Flight mode 2
help 2019-03-29 18:59:38 Spread out the boost & can freely eject passenger section if needed.
help 2019-03-29 18:59:57 despite this, how do i get lift on this design. It cant seem to get any.
help 2019-03-29 19:08:27 ah, nvm. I got it
help 2019-03-29 19:08:56 it can fly!
help 2019-03-29 19:09:03 well.. kinda
help 2019-03-29 19:09:28 i need more wing panels i believe
help 2019-03-29 19:16:26 Alright im back
help 2019-03-29 19:16:45 new developments show over the past 8 minutes i added elevation and completed passenger section
help 2019-03-29 19:16:54 Added new wings for lift, but it needs more boost now.
help 2019-03-29 19:16:59 
help 2019-03-29 19:17:08 i plan to install the boost on the front carriage.
help 2019-03-29 19:17:19 this will even out the mass and hopefully fix the lift issue too

creations-chat 2019-04-06 08:55:02 [Incomplete] Myrion Weaponised Transport / Cruiser. 
Features:
Seats 20+
Water entrance hatch which doubles as a platform when horizontal (with deploy-able railings)
Opening walls to  let in the sunshine, also with deployable railings (trapdoors are great :3)
180* Rotating Turret w/ Spotlight
2 floors w/ deploy-able 'staircase' 

Planned to feature:
More defenses, Perhaps a deploy-able aquarium for passengers to enter & see the fishies :3
Pilot's Room.
More seats :D
Perhaps one of those folds people use for large builds.
creations-chat 2019-04-06 09:07:06 people in server dont like my trapdoor railings, apparently i should be using half blocks.
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 09:08:01 >.>
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 09:08:28 dats beautiful
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 09:08:38 how does it stand <.<
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 09:09:54 ah ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 09:10:14 say, if i were to make railings, what's better. Trapdoors or half blocks?

plane-crazy 2019-04-06 09:12:10 Assemble the power rangers
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 09:12:35 e
creations-chat 2019-04-06 09:20:49 hm, i used trapdoors cos that can fold up so the inside & outside dont look all blocker & mishapen.
creations-chat 2019-04-06 09:21:07 thats why im a little resilient to use Half-blocks :P
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 09:28:32 r/wooosh indeed
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 09:29:23 this guy in game absolutely hates me. He build some pokemon i called.
 Rayquaza = Shenron
Groudon  = Godzilla
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 09:35:59 ah, i've made a fascinating discovery during the construction of a cannon.
I am 100% certain Wedge beams & 1x1 wedges are different heights on one side, a 1x0.9 block can slide over a 1x1 wedge, but not a wedge beam.
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 09:36:23 Unleash ur wrath on him
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 09:36:48 <.<
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 09:37:00 Unleash you intelligence on him
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 09:44:14 oh pistons & propellers
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 09:44:42 yeah i tried doing that when trying to build my first aircraft, i abandoned it to try making a plane after it went crazy
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 09:44:58 hm
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 09:45:01 or should i say
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 09:45:05 **plane crazy**
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:06:55 Turns out thrusters make great cannon barrels.
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:07:24 ah ok
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:11:04 *how do you people do the fold stuff*
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:12:08 why cant we just spend 100 robux or something for 3x plot size on a separate server or somethin :P
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:12:13 also 16+
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:12:34 ah ok. makes sense
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:12:54 ah neat
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:13:11 speaking of white listing, y'know what i really wanna try now
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:13:32 i wanna try and get a group together that can make a power rangers style megazord out of seperate models
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:13:40 is it that possible you think?
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:14:17 im thinking using a key system to hold builds in place
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:14:33 Lock & key, pretty much
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:14:48 ill test it out with some small bots, 1 sec
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:18:38 this is what i'll use to test. 
Lock & key, use a piston as the lock.
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:19:19 nope, gonna need 0.9 blocks for lock.
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:22:47 i conclude it is possible for seperate entities to do a lock & key sequence
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:22:58 **who wants to make a megazord?**
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:23:30 deciduus
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:24:08 it dont matter ;3
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:24:17 if one limb is cooler than the other, so be it
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:24:39 i typed something about modern power rangers & realised how stupid it was
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:24:48 i mean, have YOU SEEN the trash piles these days
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:27:36 anyway, anyone wanna team up to try & make a megazord? :3
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:30:28 i guess nobody wants to make a megazord <.<
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:31:30 *Casually watches intelligence degeneration*
plane-crazy 2019-04-06 10:33:20 and im a noob

plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:09:09 Sounds about right
creations-chat 2019-09-07 00:13:33 Celebrating my return to plane crazy after a few months break, i give you:
A boat. 
Yep. Not much special to it. Borrowed the model of the Myrion Cruiser's base & did a lot of remodeling, so the boat actually floats now instead of either launching into the atmosphere or spinning upside down.

Name? Lets go with...  - Redruth 9 . 

Features:
Fully functional forward thrust & turning. As with all boats.
360* Rotating Machine gun mounted on the front deck.
Also on the deck, a deploy-able rocket launcher.
In the cabin, you have a computer & table, while the captains area is closed off below.
At the back of the boat, 360* Cosmetic Cannon with raise / lower aiming stability. 
The Captains area has a 'secret' escape pod the players in game dubbed, *'The Smolmarine'*
(Pic 1 of 2 )
creations-chat 2019-09-07 00:14:29 Nope. Just disappeared from roblox for a while

plane-crazy 2019-09-11 00:41:17 So uh
help 2019-09-11 00:42:24 How do if fix the new funky motors? The original motors on my builds seem to have an issue of having freakouts and i'm unsure why.
Also motor 2 is neat
help 2019-09-11 00:42:53 (also motor 2 is pretty wack & likes to dance on it's own.)
help 2019-09-11 00:43:34 Lock does not fix it, but it restrains it.
help 2019-09-11 00:47:11 Allow me to demonstrate the design im attempting as it's very basic.

Motor |block| Motor 
.            Motor 

Top 2 motors are for vertical rotation holding up 2 30-block ish rocket launchers, while the bottom motor is a 360* platform for horizontal rotation. The vertical Motors seem to .... break upon use.

Celebrating my return to Roblox after what felt like forever, I jumped headfirst into Plane Crazy and spent the last 2 days learning how to make a helicopter. 
I immediately decided to make a transforming mech straight after.

It may lack design elements, but is completely functional!

creations-chat 2019-12-21 17:49:07 So i searched up on youtube how to build a suspension...

Somehow:
- Created my first fold build! (6 folds included)
- Created 4 suspensions
- Once Created, it will be my largest build to date!
- *Will take the next 15 years of my lifetime to build!* **:'D**

plane-crazy 2019-12-22 20:36:18 Im working on my first ever fold build, but im bout to surpass my save data limit. And i aint even got started on the main body.
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 20:36:31 is there any way i could potentially increase data or?
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 20:36:57 well scarily enough, all my old ones are about 0-300 blocks cos I never built large things...
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 20:37:06 here i am with a 2.5k build and am terrified
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 20:37:19 ight.
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 20:38:15 there goes 4 builds around 100 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 20:38:32 Ima get back to it. Thanks
help 2019-12-23 22:03:03 Anyone here good with Heavy build Suspensions?
help 2019-12-23 22:03:58 btw we're talking 3.5k Blocks (will be around double by the time the build is complete) While also using crap tons of helium and weight reduction.
I'm kinda new to suspensions, and these Tutorial ones aint holding up.
help 2019-12-23 22:04:04 
help 2019-12-23 22:04:10 (uncropped coz lazy :P)
help 2019-12-23 22:04:45 Dunno. Just got back from leaving roblox a few months.
help 2019-12-23 22:05:44 Nice. This is actually my first fold build too. Good luck with that
help 2019-12-23 22:06:31 My Pc crashes just from unfolding this thing.
help 2019-12-23 22:06:40 Sometimes the suspensions freak out and i get launched into the abyss
help 2019-12-23 22:06:59 Without the exterior parts, the frame itself with the suspensions is all terrain
help 2019-12-23 22:07:01 even amphibious
help 2019-12-23 22:07:11 But... now with the exterior in progress
help 2019-12-23 22:07:18 doesnt hold up, no matter how i edit the things
help 2019-12-23 22:07:35 That be great. In game or in images?
help 2019-12-23 22:07:45 i'd rather images
help 2019-12-23 22:08:01 im in a Priv ATM cos people complain bout the lag from this guy
help 2019-12-23 22:08:59 How long you spent building your zeppelin? I've been at mine for the last 2 weeks non stop
help 2019-12-23 22:10:05 Dms for relevancy

help 2019-12-23 22:15:35 Aye Yousuf
help 2019-12-23 22:15:43 You any good with suspensions?
help 2019-12-23 22:17:02 Oof.
help 2019-12-23 22:24:12 Thats fine.. but i wouldnt say this is 'tiny'
help 2019-12-23 22:24:37 more like... compensating for my lack of engineering skill.
help 2019-12-23 22:24:40 idk
help 2019-12-23 22:26:17 Good idea
help 2019-12-23 22:26:38 wouldnt be able to copy anyway without configs.
help 2019-12-23 22:27:15 I was using a Yotube Tutorial. I've neer built a suspension before
help 2019-12-23 22:27:20 i tried 2: Right Angle lever
help 2019-12-23 22:27:26 and that stick one
help 2019-12-23 22:27:33 neither have the strength to hold up this build.
help 2019-12-23 22:28:00 tbh i dont want to sacrifice the all terrain aspect... but the builds too damn big for a normal suspension. Or so i think
help 2019-12-23 22:28:49 *Cries in 300 helium blocks*
help 2019-12-23 22:29:24 issue with that however, going over bumps may cause it to acsend into the heavens... and crash my game. has done before. So i try to avoid using too much.
help 2019-12-23 22:30:23 Motor 2's have caused my life to go from Uneventful to leaping off a cliff and nothing happening.
So... no.
help 2019-12-23 22:30:33 actuall incorrect
help 2019-12-23 22:30:41 i have got Motor 2's for steering
help 2019-12-23 22:30:58 aaannd thats cos the current suspension is from a YT tutorial
help 2019-12-23 22:31:24 mhmm
help 2019-12-23 22:31:29 
help 2019-12-23 22:31:30 This is what i currently have
help 2019-12-23 22:31:36 Basic, maybe too small
help 2019-12-23 22:32:37 Maybe. I have a series of suspensions holding each of those struts out, trying to compensate some of the space.
help 2019-12-23 22:32:53 i dont know how to build an effective suspension, so I tried to make up for it
help 2019-12-23 22:33:13 Without the exterior, very effective
help 2019-12-23 22:33:21 with additions to the frame... *pancake*
help 2019-12-23 22:33:57 Nor do i tbh. May have to start toying with suspensions and such on one of my alts
help 2019-12-23 22:34:12 ive sacrificed all my old (crap) builds on this ACC for this build
help 2019-12-23 22:34:23 yet i fear there isnt enough save data for it...
help 2019-12-23 22:35:16 <@!415036739653074944> Do you know anything about suspension configs? What each setting does?
help 2019-12-23 22:36:37 Can you explain 'damps'?
help 2019-12-23 22:36:47 o
help 2019-12-23 22:36:59 i have no idea what that symbolises
help 2019-12-23 22:37:41 So if i max out damping, it would be able to cancel out more weight?
help 2019-12-23 22:37:44 on lets say
help 2019-12-23 22:38:17 This kinda part?
help 2019-12-23 22:38:45 allows the struts the lift and adapt with the front suspensions for all terrain travel.
help 2019-12-23 22:39:02 Without them, the chassis would never move with the suspension.
help 2019-12-23 22:39:12 And would get stuck on small bumps and such
help 2019-12-23 22:40:06 Ight I'll report back what changes
help 2019-12-23 22:40:21 if i dont report back within 10 minutes the entire computer crashed
help 2019-12-23 22:41:32 You're onto something lad
help 2019-12-23 22:44:39 Alright
help 2019-12-23 22:44:56 
help 2019-12-23 22:44:57 it has changes the effects
help 2019-12-23 22:45:01 If im right
help 2019-12-23 22:45:11 if i up the damping on the side suspensions
help 2019-12-23 22:45:32 it can potentially prevent the wheel struts from being forced up lik that
help 2019-12-23 22:45:55 hold it
help 2019-12-23 22:46:00 
help 2019-12-23 22:46:06 it went nuclear while i wasnt looking
help 2019-12-23 22:46:15 normally happens when i mess with the suspensions
help 2019-12-23 22:48:42 welp.
help 2019-12-23 22:48:52 I'ma keep messing with it till something changes
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 16:57:06 for the probable short time I've played plane crazy I've never taken CoT into account. Let alone it's existence until you said that
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 16:57:22 my word that is likely why none of my planes fly lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 16:57:55 Millennium Falcon?
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 16:58:26 Vtol is different to Hover, no?
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:00:33 now that i open my eyes a bit. I haven't read the <#609442446249820211> since i joined.
And now that i took a look i realise all the builds i had deleted yesterday for save data were capable of quite a few of those.
*ow*
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:02:24 Could've had Aero Engi 1,2,3 with my Myrion Spacecraft. 1.6k blocks, no helium (cos i didnt know it existed) and it flew decently well
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:02:38 f
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:03:00 Actually i might y'know. Lemme dig through my backup
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:04:01 some of my old builds with screenshots are nasty lookin. Aesthetically displeasing.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:05:02 Nope No screenshots. F

and ye, ooks alright. Now you need something to coutner helium's push
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:05:10 i think.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:06:43 but madattak said
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:07:27 <@!221496030355521536> Yep.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:07:41 Not all builds are at their best hen we first build em.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:09:03 Data?
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:09:14 o
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:09:17 k.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:09:54 Hm. I've never thought of anything like that
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:12:00 welp. Trial & Error lad
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:12:02 GL.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:12:18 *treel & eerar*
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:14:24 mhm
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:14:43 I reccoment adding 1 block, and using a ballast to find the center
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:14:57 wel, the right adjustestment. Not center
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:15:25 Would be useful
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:16:15 Ah i get what you mean
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:16:34 Rather have gradual pistons, than lots of pistons on multiple binds
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:16:57 <@!467459282250629120> Y'know what that means
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:17:07 2 ballasts
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:17:11 and you add the numbes together
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:17:14 to make the digit
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:20:03 Hm.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:20:36 Ball Bearings
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:20:39 gotcha
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:21:02 Oh. That seems to work
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:21:14 By the looks of it...
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:21:16 its a box
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:21:26 a black box.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:21:39 A box indeed

plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:26:06 your ISU-152
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:27:56 yep i just noted i didnt read the same name lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:28:00 sorry
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:28:25 Yep, i did. Much nicer
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:30:33 ngl tho
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:30:38 when it comes to upvotes and downvotes
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:30:50 a lot of it goes pretty unfairly to players.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:30:59 ^ Ye pretty much
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:31:24 hm.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:31:46 Tbh i think ima start going for ranks. Especially since i just deleted a bunch of valid builds capable of them
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:32:07 lemme list em from memory
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:32:29 language And ok what is it?
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:34:10 that got 34 upvotes. xD
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:34:27 i ant read
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:35:45 Hm.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:36:09 and yeah after checing, if i didnt delete by builds , i could've had:
Aero Engi 1,2 & 3
Terrain specialist 1& 2
Ship-wright 1,2
All for submission.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:36:13 ouch
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:37:36 lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:37:55 Indeed
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:38:27 tbh i used to be a minecraft skin designer. I should do models on one of my alts
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:38:37 that be fun
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:38:47 wait i wonder if the site si still up
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:39:56 after 6 years this site i originally made skins on is still running
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:43:03 F in the chat for this fish
the-dump 2019-12-29 17:46:11 I have a request: **someone build the pufferfish and give it a carrot**
the-dump 2019-12-29 17:46:21 cos if you dont i will do it
the-dump 2019-12-29 17:46:45 I'll build the fish. You build the carrot lol
the-dump 2019-12-29 17:47:12 ight. Im writing it on my 'to do' list
the-dump 2019-12-29 17:47:41 I'll build the pufferfish once i finish the 8 fold build "Armata Overlord" , then my new mech design a freind is teaching me
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:48:04 imagine it being some 6 year old
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:48:17 and you casually explain "So he gave us his location on roblox-"
the-dump 2019-12-29 17:54:25 thats it?
the-dump 2019-12-29 17:54:35 i was expecting a bigger carrot
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:57:01 Nice
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 17:58:13 F in the chat for pufferfish tho
the-dump 2019-12-29 18:07:15 Neato dorito
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:07:46 Seequeen of
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:10:39 yep.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:12:03 Gotta earn it lad
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:12:22 also i just realised
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:12:42 if i put a second plane on my Amphibious Walking fortress, i could potentially get the Floating Fortress rank
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:12:48 no?
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:13:06 nv
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:13:12 it says no Helium blocks
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:13:27 and since this is still my first fold, and i'm not an experienced builder
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:13:38 dunno how i'd make this hold up without Helium
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:14:17 i made a reccomendation or 2
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:14:23 With ballasts and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:14:27 nice
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:18:28 Without the use of these beam blocks this would be about 6k blocks and out of its material
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:18:35 thank god they exist
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:23:59 need an opinion of the front of the vehicle's cosmetics, and turret design. 
This is my first fold build (7 folds) and those suspensions at the front are yet to be upgraded.
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:24:54 it was changed cos thats the suspension and bit im working on lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:25:02 dw its not staying that color
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:25:17 ight thanks
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:37:52 question
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:37:57 what time zone is that morning
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:38:19 Everyone here registered different AM's & PM's so whats the time zone for that application?
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 18:40:11 but most people wake up 5-7am right?
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 19:50:53 <@!414778672847781888> That flying tank is beautiful
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 19:57:35 but wouldnt you be the same rank?
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 20:08:53 As long as you can physically make it..
plane-crazy 2019-12-29 20:09:22 Motors everywhere, pistons all over the place. Extendo for the world's longest string bean build
general 2019-12-30 19:25:01 tbh
general 2019-12-30 19:25:12 Anything flies without enough helium. Accidental or not
general 2019-12-30 20:41:53 So since the new update dropped
general 2019-12-30 20:42:00 i had a look in a few PVP servers...
general 2019-12-30 20:42:16 Brick builds are even more nightmarish and the fireworks are op as crap lol
general 2019-12-30 20:42:43 what are you trying to say?

creations-chat 2019-12-30 22:25:47 Speak your mind lad.
creations-chat 2019-12-30 22:25:56 Thanks lad
creations-chat 2019-12-30 22:27:54 Ye, Lemme find it rq and i'll see if i wanna or not :3
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 20:00:29 Hello peoples
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 20:00:42 i come to ask a question to big Mech builders out there
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 20:01:24 Has anyone ever attempted to build the "Shogun Executioner" from Command & Conquer Red Alert 3?
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 20:03:14 Only two C&C builds exist in this game
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 20:03:23 Time to make it a third.
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 20:03:59 Im not a pro-builder, but i'll do my damn best Lad
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 20:04:12 This will be my 9th mEch i believe
help 2020-01-02 20:05:31 ight, Ladies an gentlemen of Plane Crazy i come seeking knowledge for a design.
help 2020-01-02 20:05:52 My next project to continue learning the Mechanics of Mechs and big builds with motors galore
help 2020-01-02 20:06:11 involves a terrifying appearance ima need to replicate somehow to some stability.
help 2020-01-02 20:06:35 This...
help 2020-01-02 20:06:41 Is the shogun Executioner from Command and Conquer Red Alert 3
help 2020-01-02 20:06:56 A 3 Legged, Giant robot with 3 sides, each with its own torso, body and head
help 2020-01-02 20:07:21 Now, 2 sides i can do. But i am entirely unsure how to create a 3 way baseplate
help 2020-01-02 20:07:58 \     /
    |

That is the kind of shape i need
help 2020-01-02 20:08:06 Any suggestions?
help 2020-01-02 20:15:42 -
my current idea (on a small-scale test model) is to use lock motors on max torque.

If the weight becomes much, i can use ropes to hault it around and keep it in space... i think. Not sure bout that second part.
help 2020-01-02 20:16:34 Bit like this
help 2020-01-02 20:16:38 
help 2020-01-02 20:16:52 uncropped cos meh
But this may work for the small scale model
help 2020-01-02 20:18:36 . Meh lock motors still disconnect and do weird stuff still. So no lock.
help 2020-01-02 20:24:36 In my experience, use a lot of "Wedge 2" menu for the front and back of the boat, having some kind of curvature while keeping some flat body for the game physics.
help 2020-01-02 20:25:06 on the left & right of the boat's bottom bit, use a line of ballasts for Balance and prevent listing
help 2020-01-02 20:25:22 the top is kinda up to you honestly. Im not the most experienced 'Boat-ist'
help 2020-01-02 20:29:02 you can kinda use Signs and copypasta emojis i guess. But thats about all i know
help 2020-01-02 20:32:35 Eh, i think so. Ive seen people use flags and stuff in signs
help 2020-01-02 20:34:40 Back on my Shogun Executioner, my test 3-torso Skeleton kinda has a shape to it
help 2020-01-02 20:35:17 i normally use Helium, Wing panels and unpowered motors for mechs, as i was taught. But... I may need to learn a new method of mech design for these legs
help 2020-01-02 20:57:59 First skeleton of the 3 Torso part. Still cracking out a few errors. But it has the potential for use into the large scale model. 

Any thoughts?
help 2020-01-02 20:59:03 Ive decides to kinda have a 'false' hold on the sword, with only one arm. As i let it unfold (due to being a small scale model)
help 2020-01-02 20:59:12 The larger model wont need this.
help 2020-01-02 21:04:17 K so it turns out if you have more than 4-5 motors all on the same keybind button they dont work
help 2020-01-02 21:04:32 ...which kinda sucks for the design.
help 2020-01-02 21:05:48 nvm im just an idiot who placed a block incorrectly
help 2020-01-02 21:21:18 -
Added the legs, anyone to give thoughts? Using the current method of mech design i know for now. I'll have to make a new method once it makes
help 2020-01-02 21:21:47 
help 2020-01-02 21:22:37 (also just to note: If you wanna know why my username isn't in the list - 1. its an alt, for evidence please click my disc name :D )
help 2020-01-02 21:38:19 Engines
help 2020-01-02 21:38:33 If you wanna make an instrument
help 2020-01-02 21:38:37 use Snow blasters
help 2020-01-02 21:38:45 they sound like microwaves, a HUMMMM
help 2020-01-02 21:39:15 so if you have a point you stand, and a line of snow blasters, with different engines by them
help 2020-01-02 21:39:23 you can kinda mimic sounds? Idk
help 2020-01-02 21:39:26 best i can do lol
help 2020-01-02 21:53:03 aint terrain specialist the thing for rough terrain travel?
help 2020-01-02 21:54:00 .
help 2020-01-02 21:54:08 wait so all you need for it is to drive?
help 2020-01-02 21:55:12 so potentially my 4.5k 7 fold walking fortress can technically clear the entire terrain specialist chart?
help 2020-01-02 21:55:44 meh i'll submit its final version when its done
help 2020-01-02 21:56:14 Noice. Cos i cant do tracks, it indeed uses wheels.
help 2020-01-02 21:56:43 and since ima have to remodel it's suspensions for the massive weight... ye may take a while
help 2020-01-02 21:56:51 anyway glad that's cleared up
help 2020-01-02 21:56:52 thx
help 2020-01-02 22:46:11 You request a rank via this channel
help 2020-01-02 22:46:29 btw how do you have 21156 save data used
help 2020-01-05 21:13:23 Hello again. Im here often arent i?
ight, im looking for the rare bundle of joy that is the builders who have some kind of 'Tripedal walker' frame. my current model proves as an absolute negative. And since i haven't got much experience with anything more than 2 legs.
help 2020-01-05 21:14:17 my current issue is designing something that doesn't bring the entire build along with it, and drags everything else. Perhaps i just need more weight on the feet to hold it down, or perhaps something else in the model.
help 2020-01-05 21:15:17 This is the current prototype skeleton design for a small scale 'Shogun Executioner'
help 2020-01-05 21:15:23 and this is also my first ever attempt at a Tripedal walker.
help 2020-01-05 21:15:33 anyone got an idea?
help 2020-01-06 10:40:56 Ladies and gentlemen
help 2020-01-06 10:41:05 **it walks**
help 2020-01-06 10:41:27 I have created a functional Tripedal walker. Now i just need to finish the skeleton
help 2020-01-06 10:41:41 then i can work on the large-scale fold build for the actual creation
help 2020-01-06 10:46:17 it certinaly aint perfect, but it walks easily
help 2020-01-06 19:49:27 Indeed!
help 2020-01-06 19:49:40 The Shogun Executioner, build by the rising Sun for Operation Odessa
help 2020-01-06 19:50:11 I plan to make a large scale build of it
help 2020-01-06 19:51:11 Hm
help 2020-01-06 19:51:18 rockets eh>
help 2020-01-06 19:51:25 is that one of those Motor 2 guided ones?
help 2020-01-06 19:52:56 hm. Ive never attempted one of those.
help 2020-01-06 19:53:33 lol
help 2020-01-06 19:53:45 i take no offence.
help 2020-01-06 19:57:22 <@!415036739653074944> i reccomend you dont judge someone for their ranks.
help 2020-01-06 19:58:24 lol. Tis the purpose of the channel.
help 2020-01-06 19:58:50 well. Back on track with the motor 2 things
help 2020-01-06 19:59:06 how does it work?
help 2020-01-06 19:59:23 ok, but it also follows your camera center
help 2020-01-06 19:59:25 no?
help 2020-01-06 19:59:40 you point it somewhere, then turn the camera that is a completely different angle of approach
help 2020-01-06 20:00:33 alright
help 2020-01-06 20:00:59 ive done manual missiles before, but not guided. if i had to make a guess
help 2020-01-06 20:01:32 perhaps install a position based camera
help 2020-01-06 20:01:43 so you swap to a camera, specifically for guiding that missile
help 2020-01-06 20:01:50 depending on the angle you want to fire at?
help 2020-01-06 20:02:39 fair enough
help 2020-01-06 20:02:42 but one issue

help 2020-01-07 16:48:49 Oof. When it comes to things that comes in 3's... its a bit of a nightmare.
help 2020-01-07 16:49:35 You'll need to have some way of turning a single rotor. its gonna make the rotors look very clunky and less appearling
help 2020-01-07 16:50:16 If anything
help 2020-01-07 16:50:29 you could compromise. But then its just... eh
help 2020-01-07 16:50:42 eh. One day we'll have diagonal block placements.
creations-chat 2020-01-10 17:33:33 ``` ```
Giving an update on the Armata Overlord. last time i posted it in this chat, it was a frame! Now it has this 'Ender Dragon' style design (as everyone i meet calls it) and has about 8 layers of diamond plating all around the front.

The build is half complete and i had to replace about a thousand or so slate blocks with beams. 

Unfold time: 40 - 50 Seconds
Weapons: 
**Twin barrel cannon (cosmetic)** 
 mounted rocket launcher (on top these cannons)
Overall cosmetic, ineffective weapon. Might replace in future.

**'Prominence Cannon'** 
4 barrel rotating minigun. 
Can swap between focused aim & large spread. 
Highly effective against heavy & low armour, as well as light aircraft.

**to be added weapons:**
4x Machineguns, one per suspension strut.
2x Firework Launchers. Ideal for close range, mounted at the rear.

**Current Features**
Fully active lights
All terrain land with a top speed of... 5mph
 (With BOOST System: 850mph -ish.)
Fully Amphibious mobility, top speed 25. 
(With BOOST System: DO NOT USE. Kinda turns it into a submarine without mobility...)

**Planned features**
2x Deployable Micro-Aircraft (Manual controlled)
1x Deployable Escape Submarine
1x Emergency flare system.
Moar Lights
Moar Smoke
New suspension System and some way to armour it up.

Will complete this soon, and oh boi it will be chonky with the rank potential. Thanks for reading!
help 2020-01-10 17:41:13 im lookin for a dude who can make a super heavyweight suspension. I am crap with suspensions and would like some insight to how they work.
help 2020-01-10 17:42:01 and by super heavyweight i mean about 4.5k blocks with supported by around 150 heliums.
plane-crazy 2020-01-10 17:48:00 an someone tell me what the Sparkle Pop is. Isnt it just the sparkler?
creations-chat 2020-01-10 18:39:24 Yall wanna go Skiing in my Ski-Bot?

creations-chat 2020-01-10 18:50:30 Indeed lad. Glad i could make that dream true
creations-chat 2020-01-10 18:51:00 tbh if you use Skis on any kinda mech your only hope is a flat surface, Hence i build an ice skater.
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:15:00 really have to wonder the purpose of upvotes & downvotes in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:15:29 ya see so many good builds ranging across skill levels and the way votes go is outrageously damanding lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:16:14 ye, but we know those are memes. Not effort based builds. lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:16:33 mhmm. Makes no heccin sense
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:17:18 Yep. Kinda sad
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:17:58 after spending time scrolling through the chat, 3 genres of vehicles get the most votes.
Tanks with treads
Trucks (no trailers)
and some large scale destroyer ships
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:18:28 ignoring memes as we know they're jokes
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:18:43 no not that
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:18:51 as in not counting them as legitimate builds
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:19:39 yeah ive seen some fantastic stuff get downvoted to the grave. Maybe of Envy? Extreme standards?
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:20:05 Hm.
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:20:28 Welp.
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:20:34 that settles my daily rant.
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:20:39 Ima go build a Mech or something
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:20:56 wait no
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:21:12 still gotta finish the Armata Overlord. 
Speaking of, anyone here good with suspensions?
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:21:26 <.<
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:21:56 O. A cruiser? What kinda Cruiser?
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:22:08 Aircraft? Boat? Starship?
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:22:42 Is that a flintstones house-
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:23:52 OH
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:23:58 it means like Cruise ships?
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:24:09 .
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:24:12 i cant read
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:25:23 y'think we'll ever get round corner blocks to go with the spherical stuff?
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:26:17 What if i build a Cruiser that can eject it's shell to reveal a cruiser lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:26:22 wat
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:26:26 wait
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:26:31 oh my god i have a better idea
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:26:37 yall are not ready for what i just thought of
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:28:29 i am going to build the most unstable Boat in history
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:46:19 *celebrating good times*
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:46:40 Sounds fun Gory
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 13:46:44 im currently doing just that
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:14:24 pretty sure this next build of mine can be called a 'Cursed Creation'
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:14:35 and whoop its going straight to the contest when its done lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:54:23 Not possible.
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:54:26 Unfortunately
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:54:33 only you can pilot the vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:54:59 only way i can suggest a secondary pilot is to use friction blocks against unpowered motors that are pushed by the player to turn
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:55:10 they're alternate options for main pilot seats
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:55:18 lets say you have a walking fortress like me
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:56:00 You have the Fortress Pilot seat, so your camera is focused on it
The aircraft cameras & seats
The Escape Sub Seat
and so on
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:56:16 different places to control.
btw
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:56:24 Noodles?
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 14:57:19 i didnt show ya, i told ya

plane-crazy 2020-05-08 14:34:45 *yay*
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 14:35:12 Tbh i dropped this thing months ago. Back for round 3 and i still dunno how to make a decent enough suspension
help 2020-05-08 14:42:31 Dear Suspension Gods. I request your guidance.

A forever ago i submitted this bad buy to the Creations chat, then proceeded to spend a month trying to create a suitable set of compact suspensions to raise the Mobile Fortress off the ground. I dropped it since I have no brain for it.

Picking it back up in 2020, I really need help finding a better suspension.
help 2020-05-08 14:43:05 Here is the current suspension i have
help 2020-05-08 14:43:39 Standard Youtube tutorial stuff. 
however, despite as many tweaks i can make, it's impossible to hold up a build over 6k blocks in weight.
help 2020-05-08 14:44:02 if you give me a moment to unfold it, i'll present the effect and system currently in place
help 2020-05-08 14:48:06 After crashing my roblox, here is it after the Overlord is unfolded, all clamps are locked and supports removed.
help 2020-05-08 14:48:29 The system uses a strut to connect the outward 'Treads' to the main build
help 2020-05-08 14:49:45 The strut has 3 suspensions attatched to the ceiling within the build, this is done since attempted with the opposite idea failed to drive. The Suspensions constantly... suspend from being pulled rather than crushed.
help 2020-05-08 14:50:08 They extend out about 8-12 blocks, and are latched on top the suspensions.
help 2020-05-08 14:51:13 The suspensions that hold up the strut are pretty standard, I am unsure how their physics work.
help 2020-05-08 14:51:55 
help 2020-05-08 14:52:20 Would any suspension professional know how to fix this problem?
help 2020-05-08 14:57:37 I've modifed suspensions to 60 damping and added extra 5x5 wheels to make wheels larger
help 2020-05-08 14:57:43 No effect
help 2020-05-08 15:02:10 I will alter the Suspensions now.
help 2020-05-08 15:02:26 Though i am considering completely new systems for the 'treads' themselves
help 2020-05-08 15:02:59 Alright, doing a test run
help 2020-05-08 15:03:16 I've set the Rear suspensions to the maxs, and front at just above half.
help 2020-05-08 15:03:22 Since the rear carries more weight
help 2020-05-08 15:09:40 I feel like my private server is about to commit seppeku

"Max it out"
help 2020-05-08 15:13:13 Unfortunately it still isn't enough to hold up the heccin thing so ima add more suspensions

help 2020-05-08 16:17:09 I didnt notice they doubled block counts

creations-chat 2020-07-15 20:52:50 ``` Monochromatic Assault Mech V1 ```
its been a while since I've posted here... good few months. Here's something I spent the last 3 days on.

I wanted to build another mech, with PVP intent. 

The Monochromatic assault mech was very fun to design, taking a cockpit over a head & camera setup as well as some new attempts at some weapons, like a Magnetic Launcher.

The struts are for access from ground (ladders) and to prevent it from doing anything stupid when it spawns. Like having a seizure and disappearing.

The Version 1 conclusion? Disappointing. The structure simply wasn't going to take to Bipedal waking. It ends up hovering & floating at awkward angles if you overstep, which is no fun.

Fortunately I have a solution, and will reveal V2 upon the completion of a new set of legs to take the weight. Cheers!
creations-chat 2020-07-15 20:53:13 wait hold on
creations-chat 2020-07-15 20:53:22 we dont post here to send it to <#384025409945337856> anymore?

creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:29:26 one bladed? So, a single propeller?
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:29:38 or one level of propeller blades
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:35:42 <@!688971608970625025> Yo. Im very fond of that compact Heli, didnt know you could get em that small.

One of my projects is a Mobile Fortress with a few deployable drones / vehicles and I originally was going to use small planes on a sling.

Could we Dm later? Im really interested to see how you built it, as I wanna incorporate it into the Amarta Overlord's arsenal. 1 drone & 1 Heli would be amazing over 2 small drones!
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:36:42 Im also wondering if its possible to weaponise it :3
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:37:29 Ooo, do share if possible. Never built many Helis so my curiosity is triggered
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:37:52 Only working heli i have kinda cheats the system as its also a transforming mecha
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:38:38 I, dont know that terminology. But i assume it can hover and balance well by what you're saying
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:39:37 I dont see why not.
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:44:00 Looks good. But im afriad the rotors are too wide to be stored in the Amarta
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:44:08 Well heccin done tho
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:46:15 Say, how did you design the rotors up top? I see two, and i imagine they spin in such a way they never collide to allow stable flight?
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:46:44 Servos?
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:46:52 Nice.
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:47:44 Do you think its possible to enlarge the rotor design & potentially allow for a 'folded up' storage mode for them? I feel like i can slap that kinda system on another mech 👀
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:48:09 i just made some new omnidirectional legs, they are s m o o t h for walking
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:48:27 Fully bipedal and are a charm. Combine that with a flight ability?
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:48:30 Oh i'll die for it
creations-chat 2020-07-16 07:49:25 Gotcha. I only got above 30 when im trying to make rotary weapons or stupid crap lol

creations-chat 2020-07-16 08:16:21 aka, a 7 block wide build with a middle point or a 6 block with 2 center blocks
creations-chat 2020-07-16 08:16:40 oh hey the armata is in there lol
creations-chat 2020-07-16 08:16:44 the V1 at least
creations-chat 2020-07-16 08:35:09 It was to be compact to put on structure buildings that are downscaled

creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:45:33 theres Ballast-Helium ribcages which was taught to me
There's the rocket foot ones that hold the mech down & allow feet to lift & slide.
There are legs with manual motor control
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:45:53 And then there are Sliders, where they dont really lift the foot and glide
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:46:09 Yep

creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:48:24 Oo
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:48:38 That could be an Astro-Superiority fighter
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:49:05 actually its a bit chunky... more like an Multi-Role Fighter
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:49:20 looks very cool tho, i like the shape
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:51:10 oo

creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:52:28 AKA, each leg can go left right, back & forward
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:52:42 ... no clue how many keybinds this will need just to walk
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:52:45 And ye thats nice
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:52:53 are those engines disabled for cosmetic use?
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:53:12 How fast do you plan on it to go?
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:54:27 Thats pretty alright.
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:54:32 Must be really heccin heavy
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:56:43 biggest jet i've ever flown was a 3k passenger plane
creations-chat 2020-07-16 18:56:54 ... it was also my first plane. which is kinda stupid

creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:03:27 im just saying, Command and Conquer and Supreme Commander units would make for amazing plane crazy builds

creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:07:02 *well in case your silently watching*
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:07:29 This is the Shogun Executioner, a unit with 3 torso bodies.
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:07:34 
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:08:01 I think i can use this as an inspiration to add fishermen torsos to each side, creating a litteral multi-mecha fishing platform
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:08:21 "Multi-Mecha Fishing platform" You will **never** see another player build this i tell ya lol
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:09:17 replace the swords with fishing rods
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:09:22 oh this will be interesting
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:20:41 Im predicting at least... 2k to 3k blocks total
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:21:53 1.5k will likely be the legs itself
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:26:00 actually
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:26:13 if the Monochromatic Assault bot was 1k in its two legs

creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:46:39 Nice work Doc.
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:46:56 As a battleship, what kinda armaments will it have?
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:47:29 couple cannons on different elevations? You can definately add a tac Missile Launcher with that space.

creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:48:18 cos Close Tracking exists
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:48:56 and uh, i guess there is one way to get around the limited stock weapons. Being Explosive balls & Magnetcs with a loading system
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:49:07 I can imagine only one way for it to work tho
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:49:20 and it'll be a lot of conveyors and more magnets
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:49:34 is the hull hollow?
creations-chat 2020-07-16 19:49:46 the uh... bottom bit

creations-chat 2020-07-16 20:05:03 thats bigger than the current Armata overlord, which had to be massively compressed into beam blocks cos of block count and stands at 4k
creations-chat 2020-07-16 20:05:31 What is the biggest build ever made in plane crazy history?

creations-chat 2020-07-16 20:22:16 o u c h
creations-chat 2020-07-16 20:22:21 I know a fix however
creations-chat 2020-07-16 20:22:25 but you wont like it
creations-chat 2020-07-16 20:22:53 Take 2 motors and put them opposite sides on the ends of a stick
creations-chat 2020-07-16 20:23:28 you use one motor to move the stick manually & slowly till its lined up in center, then the other motor keeps your turret stable
creations-chat 2020-07-16 20:23:54 it sounds terrible ( and it is ) but its the only way i know to counterpoint a build with no middle beam
creations-chat 2020-07-16 20:24:20 (half-block motors could exist one day to fix that)
creations-chat 2020-07-16 20:26:26 ight

creations-chat 2020-07-17 16:35:54 Continueing with the Mobile Piscary platform, i have some questions for what i'll outfit each Chassis to have.
creations-chat 2020-07-17 16:36:18 For you fishing / boat specialists out there, what kind of equipment do fishing boats have?
creations-chat 2020-07-17 17:35:31 *The power of the wedge blocks compels you*
creations-chat 2020-07-17 17:37:43 wow you really are stuk-
creations-chat 2020-07-17 17:46:42 So fishing boats use Trawls, which are giant nets, Fishing lines & some cages
creations-chat 2020-07-17 17:46:50 How do i build a net
creations-chat 2020-07-17 17:58:23 Interestin. Can we get an image example of a net?

creations-chat 2020-07-17 18:01:46 I'll note those and attach a net to the limbs of one of the Mech Chassis
creations-chat 2020-07-17 18:02:18 Speaking of, the Control Center is just about done exterior wise. Just gotta plot on the roof, Dish & whatever else needed
creations-chat 2020-07-17 18:02:22 
creations-chat 2020-07-17 18:02:42 And after this construction the new Land Walking speed is **2**

creations-chat 2020-07-17 18:04:25 legs are All Terrain and im considering a 'lift' feature on the feet to raise them with piston
creations-chat 2020-07-17 18:04:46 Idk why but maybe it'll have a use
creations-chat 2020-07-17 18:07:01 Fully deployed on water

creations-chat 2020-07-17 18:09:02 the legs own Rockets can be used for mobility
creations-chat 2020-07-17 18:09:50 I use Ballasts & Heliums with a panel ribcage

creations-chat 2020-07-17 18:29:53 
creations-chat 2020-07-17 18:30:45 *Micro Wedges when*
creations-chat 2020-07-17 18:31:22 tbh its why i dont use Half wedges often
creations-chat 2020-07-17 18:31:33 they dont have the blocks to look clean among full blocks
creations-chat 2020-07-17 18:36:59 "Interestingly, russians are here"

creations-chat 2020-07-17 18:47:58 👀
creations-chat 2020-07-17 18:49:57 Вот это да. В какую игру ты играл?
creations-chat 2020-07-17 18:51:49 Потрясающие. Я постараюсь найти позже
creations-chat 2020-07-17 18:54:19 Я использую кнопку на клавиатуре. Но если вы откроете меню и нажмете на крайнюю правую вкладку, у него есть скриншот и функция записи.

creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:01:36 lol
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:01:39 why does that exist
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:01:56 Anyway we've broke 3.8k blocks and have started 100% progress on Mech Chassis
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:04:23 Coming along well
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:05:14 Это на самом деле рыболовный робот
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:16:27 I mean
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:16:41 I dont mind other languages and i checked rules, maybe i missed 'english only;
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:16:56 but not everyone knows english. And google translate handled my lil conversation like a dream
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:17:06 Other languages are cool.
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:17:31 Well if we get warned for tAlKiNg then whoop de doo.
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:17:38 I'll just continue building
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:18:01 Speaking of, just slapped another 24 props to the legs to walk better
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:18:52 yeesh... its getting hard to make it walk
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:19:03 one of these motors refuses to work
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:21:25 just detatched 4 legs on one side
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:21:33 even without those legs it stands. Excellent stability
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:24:55 its weird
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:25:03 my unpowered motors
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:25:07 just dont turn anymore
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:28:52 the more i try to edit this
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:28:57 the harder it becomes to walk
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:29:07 I should've made these legs longer...
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:31:00 eee
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:37:30 its the knees
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:37:37 the uh
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:37:39 upper knees
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:37:52 they're messing up the legs walkin ability cos of the motor connections
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:39:28 The use of ropes to help seems valid
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:43:10 an additional 175 block have been added to try and improve walking
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:43:13 y e e s h
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:43:51 I think i've generally used the wrong leg model for this to walk...
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:43:55 sure, it can move
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:43:58 but its under 1mph
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:44:41 my old Leg model for an AT-AT walker would've been more suited
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:45:23 ...
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:45:26 nope, new issue
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:45:35 Legs used to walk forward are making it turn backwards
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:45:38 w a t
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:47:31 This might be doomed for Land walking
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:47:39 but it still functions in water... and *technically* walks
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:48:16 hm... with this it wouldnt work for the contest
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:48:38 i dont see a way to fix it either
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:49:57 I might have to restart
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:51:13 Hecc the legs. If it walks at 1mph it walks at 1mph
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:54:29 **New top speed achieved: 3mph**
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:56:00 The Platform can paddle / swim with its legs at 10-15 mph
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:56:19 which is good as its meant to be in the water, land is just cos of legs
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:59:02 **Yesh**
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:59:13 Now i gotta build the mech bodies
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:59:25 then modify the legs again for an additionally 1k blocks or so in weight
creations-chat 2020-07-17 19:59:37 then add the equipment being: Fishing lines, Nets & cages
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:09:52 3768 blocks in... 100% will break 4k blocks. Maybe even skim 5k
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:12:10 Y'think someone has build the SCP version of the Bismark before?
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:13:02 What about the Japanese Submersible Aircraft Carrier?
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:13:05 from WW2?
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:13:13 Only 5 were ever built
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:13:33 Even with the slingshot & Folding aircraft?
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:13:46 Hmm
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:13:53 What about some Space Battleship Yamato builds?
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:14:06 I'd love to see someone try and build the Polmeria or Portent of Darkness
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:15:01 ooo
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:15:15 I'll hunt it down later
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:15:25 What about walkers? Not many people build em
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:15:35 Anyone ever done a fully functional Octopedal walker before?
creations-chat 2020-07-17 20:16:03 Ive done Bipedal, Tripedal, Quadruped & I *had* a quintuped but its gone
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:13:50 Rear Mech chassis, working on a Trawling Net
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:14:13 
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:15:21 
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:15:51 Was gifted a nice screenshot of a net by Galaxy a while back, but i go no heccin clue where he put the magnets & which orientation it was
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:16:03 so uh, anyone know how to build a net?
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:25:03 <@!535743883565596672> Awesome Mecha transformer lad
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:25:12 I couldnt get a plane to work, but got a Heli working
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:30:29 All fixable. Too me a couple days to make the Heli 'Stable' and it still spins if left unchecked
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:30:34 bet you can do it
creations-chat 2020-07-18 09:35:46 Ah alright
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:13:02 Hell. Im behind on the build now
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:13:05 contest expires tomorrow
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:13:19 tis what I get for not building for a day
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:13:30 better finish it off, net or no net.
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:29:19 Ngl it be pretty cool, as there really are no defense blocks in plane crazy apart from the Water Jets
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:29:44 Shield Generators could be outfitted to counter basic Guns & used against brick builders >.>
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:30:20 I can see it as, Using 'Config' on the generator and clicking a lil button to place the shield blocks that toggle on and off
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:30:56 this can be used in many other builds as a space saver & space filler, for example: A bridge for a spacecraft
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:31:07 A little toggle for a platform
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:31:13 A shield for a Mech Knight
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:31:35 Tbh i've never seen cutter blocks do anything  unless they're strapped for a crap ton of supers
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:32:25 Selective building can exist, a way to grade the amount of weapons you can actively use in PVP if a shield is equipped? Or perhaps the use of Fuel / A battery
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:32:40 Destroy the battery, No more shield
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:33:06 All this is thought on the spot. Would need a lot more thought
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:33:18 **.**
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:33:34 Takes more than 1 block to make a wheel work
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:34:19 right, but its all bout the freedom of construction. Having the battery idea would inspire some more smart builds
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:34:34 as well as some greater targetting control for pvp
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:34:45 Instead of **spray everything**
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:34:54 ye
creations-chat 2020-07-20 13:35:05 ...wat

help 2020-07-24 05:43:17 **alright**
help 2020-07-24 05:43:26 Serious talk. Serious building time
help 2020-07-24 05:44:18 Shredder bugs. F# them all and everyone who uses them to ruin pvp servers.

I want to find a way to make a complete counter to Shredder Bugs, so we can share it and let the counter spread to kill the bug
help 2020-07-24 05:44:53 By the looks of it, They spin cutters fast & ram headfirst
help 2020-07-24 05:45:18 i got the idea of a small, fast spinning Gyrosphere aircraft from a recent creation in <#384025409945337856>
help 2020-07-24 05:45:28 and yeah, but they just respawn and go again
help 2020-07-24 05:46:10 A hover or VTOL which carriers a fast spinning Gyrosphere cutter to bait Shredder worms & kill them instantly when they attack
help 2020-07-24 05:46:14 something like that
help 2020-07-24 05:48:10 like rn this bastard is **counting** the people he makes quit
help 2020-07-24 05:48:20 I am so pissed at these shredder users.
help 2020-07-24 06:01:17 there is no 'high enough' with em. They can go up to 600mph or more i've seen
help 2020-07-24 06:08:43 Ive doen it
help 2020-07-24 06:08:52 i built a Shredder worm Immunity shield
help 2020-07-24 06:08:54 Hell yeah
help 2020-07-24 06:09:31 He had to respawn over 10 times to get through it
help 2020-07-24 06:09:36 OHOHOHO IM A GENIUS!
help 2020-07-24 06:13:43 just need to attach it to a vehcile
help 2020-07-24 06:16:51 basically... its cheating the game, but also nullifies Shredder worms & acts as extra protection
help 2020-07-24 06:17:13 its quite litterally a force field
help 2020-07-24 06:17:55 Motors are used together to spin at such a rate, lined with TNT armour & cutters to create a barrier that flings them into the abyss on contact. The problem is countering the spin force
help 2020-07-24 06:18:11 The tank im trying to attatch this too is so heavy
help 2020-07-24 06:18:14 i wont have that issue
help 2020-07-24 06:18:34 its cheap
help 2020-07-24 06:18:40 it can definately be improved
help 2020-07-24 06:19:01 ... but it works. And you can do multiple layers, as well as remove blocks & position them with holes for the guns
help 2020-07-24 06:19:05 its all about cameras
help 2020-07-24 06:20:23 im aiming for 5 layers of this forcefield to guarantee Shredder immunity while allowing me to shoot outside the holes to kill them as well
help 2020-07-24 06:21:04 If it works in PVP i'll organise an entire server of shredders to try and break through all at once. See if it really is immune
help 2020-07-24 06:35:31 Yep. Ran out of save data but it makes you immune to cutter worms
help 2020-07-24 06:36:05 cant be bothered to crop, and its spinnin fast
help 2020-07-24 06:36:11 Very basic. Very bad. Does the job
help 2020-07-24 06:36:18 No more Shredder worms
help 2020-07-24 06:46:55 I used ballasts around the motors
help 2020-07-24 06:47:00 solved my issues
help 2020-07-24 06:47:15 not actually connected to the motors mind you, but it solved it
help 2020-07-24 06:49:24 I wouldnt go off my idea, but i just slapped some blocks on the 4 sides of the motor
help 2020-07-24 06:49:32 better off locking or adjusting torque
help 2020-07-24 06:50:25 ...it looks like a box
help 2020-07-24 06:50:30 *a kind of...*
help 2020-07-24 06:50:33 *storage box*
creations-chat 2020-07-24 06:55:16 we did rule half the world at one point.
creations-chat 2020-07-24 06:55:26 also committed some atrocities
creations-chat 2020-07-24 06:55:44 but times change. We still have one of the best Navy in the world
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 06:58:06 I hate when you try to go to another PVP server and it keeps putting you in the exact same one
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:04:14 *im aware*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:04:20 *But i was very close to.*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:04:25 ***i am so sick of today***
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:05:14 There's quite litterally a button that takes you to a PVP server. If it takes ya to the same one every time then whoop de doo, cant help that can i?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:15:11 More of a Croissant.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:16:40 Ye, has those lil folds
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:16:59 makes a slight W shape on the wing
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 07:17:33 eh, local store has some wacky croissants. Those look nice tho
help 2020-07-24 07:32:46 Motor twos activate, Conveyors stop working.
help 2020-07-24 07:32:59 Anyone know how to fix this?
help 2020-07-24 07:38:16 Well, ive noticed about a 10 second delay on my tank before the Motor 2s actually kick in
help 2020-07-24 07:38:21 during that time the Conveyors work.
help 2020-07-24 07:38:29 after that? Completely shut off
help 2020-07-24 07:39:07 Cant complete te adamantite without it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:57:26 They're broken with PC physics.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:57:37 Nerf Cutters or just remove them
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:57:38 kek
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:58:01 also every single Shredder bug user is toxic as hell in my experience
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:58:27 There was this one bugger who was counting the people he made quit
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:58:36 not kills, leavers.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:59:04 Lava spitters & spinning Cutter platforms are the only defence i've got for Shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:59:16 i do however have a working forcefield machine that makes me immune to them
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:59:24 i just need to make it fit on an aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 09:59:53 basically it abuses the Shredder Bugs design
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:00:27 it spins rod covered in cutters really fast, and when a spinning cutter meets a vertically spinning, high speed cutter...
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:00:30 instantly into the abyss
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:00:44 it took 2 Shredder Bugs over 10 respawns to break through it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:01:14 so far i only got it work on a *really* large tank
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:01:22 but that tank has mobility problems
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:01:42 On a large stick, on a large axel
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:01:52 No, wrong image
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:01:54 like
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:02:16 that kinda sha-
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:02:18 ...
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:02:23 that kinda shape
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:02:27 you put the motor
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:02:46 cant edit it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:03:08 basically a stick stick out, connects to a downward stick with horizontal cutters
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:03:16 Spin at 50, 1000 Torque
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:03:20 reset & toggle
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:03:42 and make it large enough to act as a dome for land vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:04:11 TNT armour by the looks of it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:04:19 idk
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:04:21 od shapes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:04:41 i see rectangles, squares

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:05:15 Yes.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:05:19 I did a test of it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:05:24 Gun & Rocket Immunity
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:05:36 Ye, problem is
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:05:42 if you do what i did
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:05:48 and moun it too an aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:05:52 and go too fast...
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:06:02 *EcKsPlosiOn*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:06:06 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:06:46 I CANT BELIEVE IT
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:06:53 I've met a GOOD Shredder bug user
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:07:06 He doesnt Kill everyone! He kills campers :3
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:07:38 Only 'railgun' i've ever made as a conveyor & Magnet Gun
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:07:46 Fired Cluster shots
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:07:52 wait whats more deadly
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:07:58 Cutter railgun or TNT railgun
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:08:04 ... cutter TNT railgun?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:08:14 an you even put cutters in a railgun?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:09:25 Ngl may try that
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:09:42 Ye, i have done one thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:09:52 y'know how you use conveyors to move TNT balls?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:10:19 I did a thing with magnets, where the conveyers push the TNT Ball into the back wall of the gun before firing at high speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:10:26 and held it there, (toggle yes)
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:10:46 And basically that does something for momentum, so when it launches
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:10:48 it just goes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:10:49 WHOOSH
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:11:01 idek how else to describe that
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:13:20 Ye, and keep pushing till they start to seizure
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:13:27 I think so
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:13:35 i detonated myself a few times doing it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:14:00 it was part of my Monochromatic Assault Bot MK1
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 10:14:14 16 rounds, fires cluster shots

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 12:33:30 seriously tho what is that
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:15:46 I like to think everyone is secretly connected in a hive mind. Cos whenever one of us is going through an internet phase, everyone is
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:16:02 like how FNAF made a comeback outa nowhere
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:16:13 or how A million searches for Sonic appeared in a day
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:56:58 Nope
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:57:11 I have a forcefield im working on that sends them to the abyss on contact
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:57:31 And yes, I say Forcefield with full seriousness
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:57:52 Not enough space for a full server do to naval battl
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:58:02 very nice turret
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:59:16 Small ones, but not proper battleships
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:59:29 Trying to use my Dweller Class Submarine would be hell
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 13:59:41 That looks really good
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:00:36 Hi brazilian player
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:00:52 thats fine. Google translate exists
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:00:59 ... what?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:01:08 Im sending messages too quick?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:01:15 *Im having a conversation*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:01:27 neato. Is it mobile?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:02:52 huh
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:03:00 wait
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:03:02 how does
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:03:08 Maple
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:03:16 how does that jumble compress into a single turret?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:03:28 Screw Shredder bugs. I have a WIP forcefield
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:03:38 Instakills the craps
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:03:58 **Not exactly**
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:04:36 I have effectively made a deployable barrier that *uses force* in a *field* to delete Shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:04:51 thats why i call it a *forcefield*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:04:56 No
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:05:00 its mobile, or will be mobile
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:05:02 It does
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:05:14 i tested i when i was attacked by two Shredders
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:05:20 They couldn't touch me
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:05:42 1. I cant record the past.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:05:47 2. I can record the future.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:06:00 3. Its only got a stationary prototype atm
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:06:09 s i g h
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:06:35 believe what you wanna believe, but you can see my celebration via the message finder in the top right search bar
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:08:26 wot
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:08:35 no I didnt googlee some Yt tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:08:54 He's building a Gyrosphere in that anyway
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:09:19 tbh, i did wanna know how to build a Gyrosphere to thx anyway
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:09:28 but thats not how my 'Shield' works
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:09:48 Basically
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:09:55 Its a stick, connected to a stick
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:10:08 with cutters horizontally lining them
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:10:26 and then spun in a circle at top speed ^ torque with reset & toggle
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:10:35 your FPS is key to its power
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:10:43 Higher FPS = Stronger Repel
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:11:27 When a high force cutter meets the cutter of a Shredder bug, the motors in the shredder bug have a seizure and cause the Bug to be flung at 10k+ speeds
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:11:35 if your lucky, they go straight to the abyss & die
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:11:48 If you less lucky, they will be flung a good few miles away
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:12:09 Im considering building a Mobile Shredder Shield for allies now lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:12:43 Again, still a prototype and only had 3 tests, all on stationary platforms
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:12:52 i have not yet made a Mobile Vehicle that can use it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:13:11 my Stardust Class Astrocraft however...
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:13:26 proved a high velocity spinner can be put into a combat plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:13:45 All welcome ideas.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:14:13 For now ima finish my Tonk Destroyer (Cavorite Class) and then i'll work on a Shredder Shield Generator
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:14:48 ngl if the Shredder shield works & i can improve it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:15:14 then it could very well change plane Crazy's PVP
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:15:29 As it will double as a normal Cutter defence, and if mounted to an aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:15:38 An aircraft ramming tool
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:15:49 im gonna no think too far ahead
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:15:50 lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:18:23 still confused how you fit so much stuff inside those tiny turrets
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 14:18:46 ik but how the heck does that *compress*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 17:07:44 *i wonder if posting Creation collages & describing my experience triggers more downvotes*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 17:12:30 Meh. Dont care too much for votes. I sorta use the Creations channel to log my progress. I can search back in <#504436696021204992> 's history and find all my old garbage builds, and see how far i've improved
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 17:12:56 With the power of Alts i will have at least 30 Individual vehicles across all forms of Terrain & sizes by the time I'm done

help 2020-07-24 18:06:24 Conveyors lack the power to hoist 2.5k blocks of weight. And thus, im looking for a new method of holding weight. I'm Inexperienced with Wheeled / Treaded vehicles, mostly used to walkers & Aircraft.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 19:15:17 ngl i made the legs of an ATAT in under 200 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 19:15:50 Not really. Our leg style is very different
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 19:15:59 so uh... sorry for the pointless comment
help 2020-07-24 19:29:02 Decided to give one of those 'higher tech' jets a go. Installed a collapsible Wing set for carrier storage, thoughts?
help 2020-07-24 19:29:23 Should i alter the wing shape at all? Wanna do it as a blend of those F-15 styles and my own style
help 2020-07-24 19:33:42 Saw this by "CoolBroski82110" and i've decided im gonna shape the wings more like this and & those flaps.
help 2020-07-24 19:50:45 -
Left or right wing?
help 2020-07-24 19:51:01 which looks better with the shape of these wings?
help 2020-07-24 19:53:00 im leaning towards left personally
help 2020-07-24 19:57:24 Check its not a 2 year old YT tutorial one. Physics may be outdated.
help 2020-07-24 19:57:41 that issue reminds me of when i tried to do treads
help 2020-07-24 19:57:49 used a Tut & it kept falling of
help 2020-07-24 20:07:36 Ballasts can be used to fix this. Dot some beams around, lining the hull
help 2020-07-24 20:07:53 one side tips without any interaction?
help 2020-07-24 20:07:59 make the other wise heavier / denser

help 2020-07-24 20:12:54 Pontoon parts are good for floating i think
help 2020-07-24 20:13:30 I put the round part of the pontoon against the water, like those Hydroplanes
help 2020-07-24 20:13:49 Helps keep stuff upright i think
help 2020-07-24 20:15:35 I think i make my ships too curvy
help 2020-07-24 20:15:54 you'll put a wedge down, put the triangle wedges on

help 2020-07-24 20:20:16 -
when using Motor2 flaps for wings, should the wings be in line with the pilot seat / cockpit for the C camera view to center with the Motor2's ?
help 2020-07-24 20:20:24 or are the M2's manually controlled instead?
help 2020-07-24 20:20:28 
help 2020-07-24 20:20:36 (red is pilot seat)

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:19:19 looking at my other craft and blending it together
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:20:23 
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:20:40 I am absolutely baffled with myself lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:21:27 Trust me, that tail has so much fun added to it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:21:38 This bad boi has some motor m a g i c
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:21:57 it can be a fast, extremely mobile fighter making turns too fast for my computer to like
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:22:04 and make adjustments
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:22:20 to completely change its flight into this long turn, smoothish bomber style movment
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:22:27 *I love it*
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:23:01 One problem tho
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:23:05 I dont have a name for it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:23:49 hmm... i was thinking something more *entitled*. I name my 'special' vehicles big flashy names
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:23:57 this is one of those flashy vehicles in my eyes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:24:18 my 3k Tank is the Adamantite
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:24:28 the Submersible Battleship will be the Dynasty
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:24:56 see the gimmic? Big flashy names that you an pronounce in 10 different ways in a cinematic tone
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:26:26 I imagine the letters have meanings?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:26:57 or is it the "L ? "Foxtrot" "Theta" "harold" Five Three Slash One
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:29:02 Carrier storage complete
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:29:24 Ah
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:29:57 So, this would be a Multi-Role / All Purpose Aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:30:05 Since it can toggle its wing shape, positions
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:30:15 into Bomber flight & fighter flight
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:30:20 I just gotta practice it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:35:22 oh my
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:35:27 I turned it into a Submarine too
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:35:33 It can transform into a submarine
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:35:37 and launch from underwater
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:35:42 IM A GENIUS! AAHAHAHAHAH
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:36:17 Well not quite. needs a little more ooomph
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:36:42 Maybe i can have a fold out hydrofoil to lift me out the water & quickly swing it back to lift off
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:36:51 AHA! THIS IS WHY I PLAY THIS GAME!!!
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:36:52 AHAHAHAHA!
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:51:29 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:52:14 y'know i think ima give it a day or two before sharing this in <#384025409945337856> after my 'Collage' post showing everything i've built in the last two days got over 20 downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:52:42 i BET you if i did it One Image at a time
1.Those people would've upvoted
2. I would've been warned for flood
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:53:25 Yeah, i like to judge based on a persons skill level. I believe im good at seeing someones limits
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:53:51 But, wooden box gets 62 likes while a miracle of PC engineering that took weeks to make gets about 7
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:54:16 Submarine? Awesome.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:54:39 ngl, you can recover from that
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:54:54 If i go to my collection page, i have 2 subs.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:55:03 A small attack sub of about 300 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:55:10 and an Assault Submarine of about 800
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:55:44 
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:55:49 ouch
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:56:00 oh god
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:56:19 ive only gone up to 8k blocks at most, suppressed with beams, but jesus christ
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:56:22 10k?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 21:56:42 I'd give you a chocolate bar and a pat on the back if i could
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:01:23 here it is
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:01:26 
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:01:36 All three modes of the beauty ive named
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:01:38 "Destiny"
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:01:44 the future of Flight.
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:03:14 Bomber Mode : slower turning & Slower speed for pinpoint stability.

Fighter mode : Incredible mobility , amazing speed. 

Overlock : Messes with physics to break the Top speed, havent found a limit yet
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:03:25 And uh, this is me experimenting with Wing shapes & positions
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:03:41 Those *'Modes'* are what i need to remember
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:03:50 and what i need to practice changing between mid flight
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:04:42 The overlock is finicky, as due to the increase in speed you gotta manually adjust the wings as the speed increases to maintain the ability to turn
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:04:50 but with a few weeks, i can master this
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:05:34 it sucks that this is on my Alt account and not my main, but oh well
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:11:29 ... spike pit?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:13:08 If reports came back, you'd see hundreds of Shredder worms being reported for toxicity
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:13:09 kek
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:13:22 And uh, i still agree tho
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:13:38 So no more in-game mods?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:14:03 Depends on the experience tho, it aint about banning folk
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:14:08 its about helping people out
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:14:51 Fireworks come out annually in the winter right? Around christmas?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:14:59 or is it 4th july celebration?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:15:17 Eh, drat
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:15:34 I'll have to get Fireworks for this alt next year to install the bomber feature-

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:18:18 Nannoc, can you share how you did air brakes? Im incredibly curious. Sorry to interrupt
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:18:51 I have a solution
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:18:56 you on a windows PC?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:19:07 crap uh, lemme check my post stick notes
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:19:17 there's
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:19:19 a command

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:19:44 hold on, digging through my trash heap desk
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:21:10 oo

plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:26:07 <@!551806781609869313> go to your command bar, that little search bar in the bottom left
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:26:47 do /cmd and open it, then run: echo of |clip 2
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:27:13 hold on
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:27:18 i got a digit wrong
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:27:44 hm...
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:29:30 cos 90% who vote are either extremely judging or downvote thinking their builds are better
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:40:58 Anyone here got an aircraft carrier? I wanna try and land on it and see if i can use the Folded up storage mode
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:41:27 how small?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:42:47 HM
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:43:04 I can use OverClock to reduce wingspan
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:43:14 i can fit on the carrier then, but OverClock is f a s t
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:43:21 How long is the carrier?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:43:52 That can do the job if brake early
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:43:57 you in game atm?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:44:04 ight
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:44:18 Actually my first time trying to land on a carrier
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:44:21 hehe
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:45:13 Thinking your Smol carrier is 100 or more blocks long, i realise the Overlord will not be able to dock the Drones it deploys
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:45:21 unless i remodel the entire thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:45:26 and i think i'll do that
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:45:49 ight, you in my game or am i coming to you?
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:46:33 teleported
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:47:17 ight, i'll aim for it
plane-crazy 2020-07-24 22:47:30 how fast should i be for landing?
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 00:10:46 **c h a n k**
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 01:15:34 ladies and gentlemen
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 01:15:40 the Destiny jsut whooped a Shredder Bug's ass
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 01:16:03 Im officially stating its gotta be one of the best Planes i've ever seen. Not a stratch, made em leave
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 01:16:31 Well its origin name is "Shredder Bug"
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 01:16:46 it was overtakne by the "monster bug" then "Monster worm"

help 2020-07-25 02:34:39 -
Ello. Im curious to know how i see these small other aircraft are zipping  rounds turns as if there was a glass wall to slide on. Its being the bane of my combat experience so far and im puzzled. A small gun-stack brick with two Propellers could dart round a corner like a heccin fidget spinner.

meanwhile, my aircraft have to properly learn & bank to perform such turns and gotta cover at least a tight arc.
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 02:45:48 k. Whats the most effective way to kill a bunch of shredder bugs

plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:37:21 THE SHREDDER BUGS LEAVE!
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:37:41 Alright. Time to turn this prototype into a full on aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:37:50 The day of Shredder Bugs ends nigh
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:38:24 **On July 25th, 2020, i created Plane Crazy Shredder Bug Pesticide**

plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:49:26 the Shredder Shield has claimed its first Quitter
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:49:36 time to erase the shredder bug population
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:50:29 The hunt begins
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:50:45 4-5 servers, clean them of bugs if we can
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:50:59 then we use that new test knowledge to improve the aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:52:06 wait hold the phone
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:52:14 <@!582598719916998692> Your the bloke who invented it

plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:53:08 *You've unintentionally, single handedly brought a depression to PVP*
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:53:59 3 servers clear of Bugs.
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:54:06 *The hunt continues*
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:54:48 Awesome
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:55:06 my first propper build was a creappy aircraft with too many features
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 05:56:50 it always starts crap. Its about learning
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 06:10:02 "You use a gun"
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 06:10:10 "and if that don' work..."
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 06:10:20 **"You use more gun."**
creations-chat 2020-07-25 06:13:27 Thanks for the opinion. I know a more experienced builder will hopefully pick up on my approach & take it to Designer 5+ engineering for better effectiveness

help 2020-07-26 23:57:43 I'm experiencing a bug where Motor 2s are being delayed from activity when spawning and once they kick in, all movement abilities (wheels, thrusters, Conveyors etc) shut off and become unusable. Any idea what's causing this?
plane-crazy 2020-07-27 13:55:11 *laughs in permanently disabled reports*
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:00:14 Descided to turn the Riptide into an All Purpose Bomber. Currently carries 2 different types of payload.
3x Bomb drops (sets of 4, debating to change to 16 / 8 different keybinds)
1x TNT Ball drop

Gonna put on the Torpedos soon as well as... *a guided missile?*
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:01:00 oh yeah darkne that blue

creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:25:25 i just work in Monotone colours, sometimes with little detail extras
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:26:54 I look at fold builds & feel pain cos i wanna build stuff like that but i cant do folds
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:45:09 Thoughts on the orange? Gonna darken the white once its 100% Finished. Adding Torps now.
creations-chat 2020-07-27 21:46:30 I'll be building spaceships in future so thats good to know & yes
help 2020-07-27 21:47:28 Carrier Elevators? Like actual Human elevators or somethin else?

help 2020-07-27 21:49:16 Y'know how trains have those wheels & struts? Often used for their wheel things? Old train stuff
help 2020-07-27 21:49:18 ill grab an image
help 2020-07-27 21:49:43 These sorta wheels
help 2020-07-27 21:50:20 Could 2 pairs be used to elevate a platform in the center? One wheel spins one way, the other spins the other. The struts attatched to a platform in the center to create a lifting platform?
help 2020-07-27 21:50:40 odd to explain this but somethin like that has bugged me for a while
help 2020-07-27 21:54:39 just made a model
help 2020-07-27 21:54:45 it works beautifully
help 2020-07-27 21:55:13 
help 2020-07-27 21:55:43 Wheels spin oppositely to lift, Suspensions are dead.
help 2020-07-27 21:56:09 and by dead i mean they dont have any dampping or length, has a small shake issue but i think messing with suspensions can fix that
help 2020-07-27 21:56:41 yeah Stiffness 100% Fixes it
help 2020-07-27 21:56:53 Lemme see what 2 1k torque motors can pull in Ballasts
help 2020-07-27 21:57:01 this is 10 + 10 + 40
help 2020-07-27 21:57:50 260 points in ballasts, no problem up or down
help 2020-07-27 21:58:01 Shaking platform problem is back.
help 2020-07-27 21:59:23 540 points, no problem

help 2020-07-27 22:06:35 *like a charm*
help 2020-07-27 22:08:50 Gonna see how much weight it can take
help 2020-07-27 22:09:20 testing with... **74** maxed out ballast beams, not attatched to the platform
help 2020-07-27 22:09:53 Conclusion: Can lift it, but the suspensions cause shaking.
help 2020-07-27 22:10:03 Gonna work on replacing them
help 2020-07-27 22:10:37 if they are, thank god. Middle finger to Shredder worms
help 2020-07-27 22:10:57 also depends on impact force, like speed & stuff
help 2020-07-27 22:15:29 works large scale too
help 2020-07-27 22:26:46 Attempted to elevate a car, Suspensions cause the platform to bounce back & forth like a ping pong game
help 2020-07-27 22:26:52 still working to improve it
help 2020-07-27 22:27:48 *i may have a solution*
help 2020-07-27 22:28:01 wait no nvm
help 2020-07-27 22:39:50 Nah, tried all i can really think off
help 2020-07-27 22:39:57 Cant fix the shaking of the suspensions
help 2020-07-27 22:40:11 well... now that i say that...
help 2020-07-27 22:40:16 there is one way
help 2020-07-27 22:40:22 yet to try

help 2020-07-27 22:53:49 Really? Its been bugging me all week
help 2020-07-27 22:54:30 I always thought if something like this would work and was putting bits together in my head. To see i was right is... well quite ego inflating to say the least.
help 2020-07-27 22:55:24 next problem to fix is the Motors. They aint strong enough to carry a lot. The platform is about 300 Blocks and it struggles a little
help 2020-07-27 22:55:36 Use of Helium eased it, but isnt viable for fold builds
help 2020-07-27 22:55:48 Engines would also have the same issue
help 2020-07-27 22:55:56 my current thought is **Conveyors**
help 2020-07-27 22:56:25 Vertical ones, with pistons that push it against the side of the platform & drive upward & downward to assist with lifting heavy stuff
help 2020-07-27 23:01:07 making the motors fast fixes the issue. Need to test a Heavy vehicle
help 2020-07-27 23:23:46 Works great now, even made the platform large enough for my Adamantite tank, a 3k block on another acc.
help 2020-07-28 05:58:58 *help my control panels are stupid and are being inverted*

creations-chat 2020-07-28 08:58:00 If i need a really thin scale i do a handy thing with Motor locks, now that i've found their reality of engineering to do a 2x2 nose & lock everything back halfway to a side to make it centered.
help 2020-07-28 09:11:29 oh ok

creations-chat 2020-07-29 15:56:36 They're just a downvote bot
creations-chat 2020-07-29 15:57:29 Either cos their petty , think they're builds are superior to everyone elses or simply want to be a D

creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:17:04 Say, would you think a Dreadnaught would have a 4 Fold Naval or 3 Fold (but wider) Naval?
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:17:10 planning ahead for my classes
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:18:52 Custom Model. I go with the flow. 

Dreadnaughts are a modern class of ships, so i thought to ask here for Naval specialists to answer. Are they bigger, the same, or smaller than Battleships?
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:19:50 oh? I thought they were a more newish style where firepower was all.
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:19:57 is that a different kind of class?
creations-chat 2020-07-29 16:20:14 Sorry :P

creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:17:24 I think im gonna do the Extra weapons simply cos i love the way those front cannons look
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:17:49 Plus, it'll let me move onto the Dreadnaught or the Missile Cruiser next
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:27:04 <@456226577798135808>  Oh cos I use <#384025409945337856> as a timeline for my creations, seeing how I've developed as a builder. Posting the WIP stuff here allows for instant criticism & suggestions. People are less likely to give build tips & stuff if i share in <#384025409945337856> .

<@!476629966780497931> Is the Bridge the box thing in the middle?
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:27:34 If so, i do wanna redo it once i finish the back of the battleship.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:29:25 btw cos i had to slap a fold in for the bridge , im only just getting used to building upside down.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:29:44 So, getting there.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:30:52 Oof, put the part for you but missed the other dude
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:30:54 uh,
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:31:09 there we go
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:31:25 But uh, yeah Ivan is the Bridge the box in the middle?
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:32:39 ight
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:32:50 I will 100% redo it. Cos is dont like how blocky it is
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:32:54 Nor its decor.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:33:30 Ive used this Tech 1 Battleship from SupCom-TA as the model on how to build a Battleship.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:33:34 Might try and shape it more like that bridge
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:35:19 <@456226577798135808> its the Meridian Class
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:35:21 :3
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:35:32 ye.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:35:40 That image is from the model concept art
creations-chat 2020-07-30 16:36:15 we've broke 4.5k blocks. Another 2k in columns likely
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:02:13 Cant build extra guns. Not enough space on the folds
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:02:22 gonna do the small air Strip instead.
help 2020-07-30 17:03:58 Q: What is the average Width of a Combat plane / jet?
help 2020-07-30 17:04:05 In PC Blocks
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:44:23 Just about done. 

Added a short air strip, i don't know if it can house any aircraft however, and seems more ideal for a Heli or VTOL if anything.

Issues:
it 'lists' (tilts to one side) despite being Asymmetric. Currently working to fix.

No idea how on earth i make an interior. Never seen inside a Battleship before & there aren't many other builders who show interiors.

Despite all on the same keybind, not all the lights shine. May just be the game.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:46:06 I want to. But Supreme Commander Units are all Autonomous.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:46:11 So i might now
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:46:14 not*
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:46:28 No Crew needed when its call ran by an ACU (Armoured Command Unit)
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:46:41 Just finishing up with improvements & then its done.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:48:37 Fixed the listing.
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:48:49 And uh, Perhaps Rather than a drone with speakers
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:49:57 Rather make Portable Rave Station , i guess. Dance floor, Disco Ball. DJ & Bar. Use of Motors & locks can compact it into a small lil box that nobody will expect
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:50:07 just remember to use Lights, trails & all the bit
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:50:35 Nah, If it sounds hard try one of those food trucks & see how easy they are
creations-chat 2020-07-30 17:50:44 *BTW fixed the tilting problem*

creations-chat 2020-07-30 19:27:40 Guess im doing the Swordsman
creations-chat 2020-07-30 20:06:37 **holy crap**
i just noticed that when you paint a block to a new material
creations-chat 2020-07-30 20:06:46 *Its not the default white*
creations-chat 2020-07-30 20:06:50 *but like*

creations-chat 2020-07-30 20:07:05 ***And it really heccin annoys me now***
creations-chat 2020-07-30 21:09:18 I know i said it would be a 3 fold... but i thought, "What holds more missiles... a longer or a chonker?" and i went with...
creations-chat 2020-07-30 21:09:39 c h o n k y missile cruiser.exe
general 2020-07-31 12:03:50 Hello Gamers.
Ya lad has a budget of £120 for a gaming chair and needs some sources & Opinions on which ones are just *the best*

Any info via DMs or Pings is appriciated, thanks :3
general 2020-07-31 12:26:18 *Anchor blocks would like to know Jay's location*
creations-chat 2020-07-31 14:15:54 Progress on the missile cruiser. Decided since it'll only have one main cannon and a crap ton of missiles, I'd make it a bit interesting.
creations-chat 2020-07-31 14:16:44 4 main barrels using hover thrusters cosmetically to add 4 additional barrels to it. All rotates
creations-chat 2020-07-31 14:17:04 Colour Scheme was inspired by UEF Ships, but a Nerf style would be interestin.
creations-chat 2020-07-31 14:18:43 Gonna try another cannon design before i finish that one tho
creations-chat 2020-07-31 14:52:40 By flipping my elevator Mechanism on its side, i've effective simulated Cannon recoil.

Barrel is quickly blasted back from launch, and slowly returns to position.

not perfect, but also works for just full auto machineguns.
creations-chat 2020-07-31 14:56:45 <@!380926327210901506> Yo, thats awesome.

Would you be alright with sharing your design? I wanna see if I can attach it to a PVP Naval ship in future.

 In addition, if the motors used in the systems were sped up & conveyors were used in the magzine to move rounds, how fast can we make the loading time? 👀
creations-chat 2020-07-31 14:58:00 yeah idk what that is either
creations-chat 2020-07-31 14:58:08 I think its a helicopter
creations-chat 2020-07-31 14:58:12 ... kinda
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:46:28 Now that i've improved my aircraft building skills and have began tapping into PVP (WASD) Controls, should i redo the Predator Interceptor?
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:46:32 
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:47:22 Note that was one of my first PVP Aircraft.
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:47:41 Havent used Manual flaps until i made the Destiny MK 1
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:47:51 and then the Apex Type A & Apex Type B
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:49:05 Interceptors gotta be fast, sleek and nimble. Designed to Intercept aircraft mid travel (such as bombers) and chase / destroy. That's the intent for the Predator MK2 Design
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:49:24 Should i keep the Dual Layered Wings? Idk if there is any benefit to them.
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:51:52 Could Control Surfaces be used in tandom with Manual Flaps for More aircraft manuaverability?
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:52:44 If Control Surfaces had a Toggle feature to Enable Follow Cursor & Disable Follow cursor my overall Plane ability would *triple* in quality as i love using Follow Cursor. Easier on my PC
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:52:56 Control Surface 2 Potentially?
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:58:31 oh wait hol on
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:58:35 <@456226577798135808> You do boats?
creations-chat 2020-08-01 06:59:05 Civilian, industry or Militarised?
creations-chat 2020-08-01 07:03:11 Ah alright.
creations-chat 2020-08-01 07:07:15 new nose (left pic) really shows how much different my Plane Designs have become while building them. Got loads of aircraft now and it does show.
creations-chat 2020-08-01 07:07:18 proud of that
creations-chat 2020-08-01 07:08:51 Now. Looking for knowledge here...

**Q:** How do i install a C-Engine to an aircraft? (Conveyor Engine)

**Alternate:** Are Magnet Engines more stable than Conveyor engines for flight?
creations-chat 2020-08-01 07:28:44 *?*
creations-chat 2020-08-01 07:29:10 No as in, if you're going at Ludicrous speed, you wont have a seizure mid flight as your plane tries to stay stable
creations-chat 2020-08-01 07:29:43 my 700 Sds Jet has a shaking issue when it breaks 600 sds, idk how to fix it but i think its the speed.
help 2020-08-01 07:42:33 How do you fix a dipping aircraft? 
AKA, taking of but your plane slowly dips its nose down & has to be corrected.
help 2020-08-01 07:42:43 is it the wings? Thrust?
help 2020-08-01 07:43:21 actually might be  my CoM.

creations-chat 2020-08-01 10:02:26 Ive got an interesting idea to try.
creations-chat 2020-08-01 10:20:43 <@!544683852384174093> How about some Transforming wings?
creations-chat 2020-08-01 10:20:53 Capable of both W and Modern
creations-chat 2020-08-01 10:23:59 my Destiny MK1 is a fully transformable aircraft
creations-chat 2020-08-01 10:24:20 Can become a Fighter, a Bomber and can exploit physics to surpass its top speeds
creations-chat 2020-08-01 10:24:39 (also has a naval mode just in case i crash 👀 )
creations-chat 2020-08-01 11:47:12 Atium MK2, very fun

creations-chat 2020-08-01 16:05:56 When i did the Gladiator, i sorta just winged it with the fold.
creations-chat 2020-08-01 16:06:15 
creations-chat 2020-08-01 16:06:32 Worked out in the end. Just build with the flow is the best ideal i got for it
creations-chat 2020-08-01 16:06:39 bridge is still ugly but i'll update that later
creations-chat 2020-08-01 16:11:46 -

help 2020-08-11 15:51:38 Hi. Back for a bit.

Are folds on a aircraft ever a good idea?
help 2020-08-11 15:52:02 Like, multiple folds & stuff. Got 4 so far
help 2020-08-11 15:59:16 Neat. Im sure everything will go perfectly
help 2020-08-14 10:56:53 **Hi**

What kind of wings would suit this style of Jet, yes its large but i want it to be. Its mostly based on a Toy Jet i have the remains off. (its mostly destroyed) but has a cool look, i've just gotta tweak the colours when im done.
help 2020-08-14 11:51:44 question as i dont know either
help 2020-08-14 11:51:48 *the hecc is drag?*
help 2020-08-14 12:15:30 I'm kinda going for a Wedge-like wing style as well, but it does have a slight angle after the flaps.
help 2020-08-14 12:16:05 Fun note, this'll be my biggest aircraft since *the first aircraft i ever made* which was 4k blocks and flew awfully lol
help 2020-08-14 12:16:32 Thx.
help 2020-08-14 12:17:11 before i started motor locks, most my planes were around that number. So your on the right track.

help 2020-08-17 14:28:41 On another note, Im seeking a small Missile design with a simple launch. As Compact as possible, my goal is to add at least TWENTY Missiles to my 'Missile Cruiser'
help 2020-08-17 14:29:59 I know one missile by heart, but I wanna get more compact than a 9x9 wide, 6 block tall rocket
help 2020-08-17 15:19:12 -

plane-crazy 2020-08-18 21:46:35 was gonna use em. They looked good for a cockpit cover
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 21:47:29 I cant suggest. Idk the requirement or command either.
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 21:51:39 hm. That'll do.
plane-crazy 2020-08-18 21:51:48 gtg in 9 mins so, maybe another time
creations-chat 2020-08-19 11:06:34 Hm. I do the Hull's of my boats very differently to that. I use the Wedges & Tri-Wedges for a smooth curve and flow from front to back.

creations-chat 2020-08-19 11:08:01 I try to make basic mobility a primary goal, no matter how compact or enlarged a build is

2. Its gotta move good.
3. Its gotta *feel* good.
4. Its gotta have a good name.
creations-chat 2020-08-19 11:08:43 are basically my mindset pointers for my builds
creations-chat 2020-08-19 11:12:57 True. The Armata Overlord suffers from that
creations-chat 2020-08-19 11:13:36 It did however, achieve a Top Speed of 5 despite being around 6k blocks compressed *heavilty* by putting Beams everywhere
creations-chat 2020-08-19 11:22:05 So, overnight.

Predator MK4 was despised in downvotes.
Maddox. MK2 was a complete success.
Riptide MK3 was on the 'Meh' side starting up and scaled down.
And the Talcyon was a success too.

Kinda hard to crack the difference. 

i assume: Predator Mk4 was too wide (again) to which i probably agree. All but the Mk2 carried that Wide nose appearance, and at first it was an upvote collection despite being 90% control panels.

Riptide Mk3, probably a far better way to do Forward-Swept wings to which i dont know how, and the Nose may've also been a bit wide.

tbh i didnt wanna go beyond Mk4 for the Predator, but i wanna find a model and appearance that is universally liked by the majority.

So.

plane-crazy 2020-08-19 20:11:00 That can come down to your FPS and computer performance. It effects your weapons.
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 20:11:31 A strong, fast PC has missile that go triple the speed of a PC like mine, which is only mediocre with a Dual Core.
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 20:12:20 Imo, Guns are best used on Ground Vehicles and Air-To-Air turrets on large aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 20:13:02 To you, i find them useful. Quite Reliable if you need to cut the motor connection of a tank
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 20:14:02 I do wanna see more weapons to plane crazy though.
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 20:15:00 Shield Blocks that can appear & dissapear on command can be amazing for builds. Kinda like scaffolding. Enable & Disable Collision. Though, that kinda system can easily be abused with Cutters.

Perhaps only enable / disable if it wont instantly collide with something when it spawns?
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 20:15:33 An actual Cannon with an a bullet arch would be awesome too, TNT balls work for ammo but are too large if your going for a PVP build

creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:28:20 bac after a long brainless break. Removed the radio Tower thing from the Byzantine and have removed the Centipede movement in favour of tank movement. First Carriage Exterior complete, i think :P May change when the vehicle gets its weapons.
creations-chat 2020-08-30 17:28:54 <@!428543757307346944> btw, personal suggestion: remove the central cannon and put one of them on each Tread Platform.

help 2020-12-19 14:51:18 Alright.
So, I haven't built an aircraft in a long while, but even then i've never quite figured it out.

i'm using the DWG-262 Melanca from the Garmilon Empire of Space Battleship Yamato as a reference to design a new variant of my all-wing bomber.

However, I have no clue how to design a non-shoddy looking rudder for the swept wings of an all-wing aircraft. 

Anyone got any builds or examples that could give me a hand?
help 2020-12-19 14:51:59 Picture it as more blocky for obvious reasons, but I still dont know how to do a swept-wing rudder / elevator. Thats the goal i guess.

So what thes 'not-dumb' way
creations-chat 2020-12-31 23:40:33 I call it Motor Lock Spaghetti
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:10:24 Say, has someone suggested an opposite placed half wedge? Being quite bothersome trying to get the shape I want, even with Motor Locks. 

Would make this much eaiser
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:10:51 There is never enough wedgery in this world lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:12:27 Could also even use a quarter block. Would actually be better
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:13:36 Ima need you to explain that one, havent touched PC in a good year or so. 
I remember motor locking and such but Im no longer familiar with that term
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:15:05 No clue whatsoever. Anytime i use Suspensions my builds just fling so i don't bother with em anymore.
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:15:21 Sucks for making vehicles but Suspensions are god awful
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:15:46 I *think* i get this. Gimme a sec.
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:17:08 Suspension blocks are hell

and Thanks Exquited, gonna try and recreate that.
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:17:32 half piston or full piston?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:27:27 Any of these the correct arrangement, or are motors not needed?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:29:15 Im not sure i can vision how that would work or look.
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:29:49 Lock tower? Oh you dont mean motor lock spahgetti do you?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:30:13 I really have devolved into being practically new to this game lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:32:25 Hm. This is outside my knowledge then. I've never had to do a lock tower for anything.
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:32:38 Piston Locks are completely new to me.
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 13:35:20 Somethat hasnt changed in PC since my time gone is how stingy <#384025409945337856> is when it comes to players, new or experienced.

creations-chat 2021-08-08 04:24:05 <@!807806846009212968> Nice vehicle, you got a base chassis working. However asking for help in <#384025409945337856> is a lost cause. Playerbase has standards that can only be described as extreme, they do not care for a persons experience. ignore the upvotes and downvotes for the sake of yourself.

In the meanwhile, for a base start for getting into compexity, you can essentially do what I did and study some tutorials and build videos on Youtube. You'll learn techniques and methods you can re-create for some sweet and unique details and shapes you cant make normally. Alternatively, There are people like myself with roles like my "Expert Robotic Specialist" which normally offer information and insight if asked. So be sure to look out for those.

You got good stuff atm.
creations-chat 2021-08-08 04:33:31 I wasn't flexing. Read again. people with those roles I imagine would be more than happy to show people the ropes, especially when it's clear their just starting out.

Furthermore you've only further solidified my point about sharing creations in this discord being a lost cause. Person asks for helps to improve and potentially enjoy the game more and you'd rather shut him down uncaringly.
creations-chat 2021-08-08 05:30:54 I feel like i've seen it before. Maybe a few years back. Not the build but rather the design of the Popsicle

help 2023-01-12 09:03:23 man my old builds make me glad I use F3x games to build stuff now lmao
Sadly most those games dont have the mechanical components PC does.

general 2023-06-04 16:22:23 captured this username in a PVP server shortly before a lag bomb disconnected the server
general 2023-06-04 16:22:46 If anyone else can get footage of them (my screen recorder isnt working) that would be great.

So ye im here
general 2023-06-04 16:24:30 Once again; very aware
general 2023-06-04 16:24:34 this si the Plane Crazy Community
general 2023-06-04 16:24:49 said community is why I ditched the game and found plenty of other ones because of it
general 2023-06-04 16:25:11 But hey im back cos I probably havent built anything in *years*
general 2023-06-04 16:25:25 I'd estimate I havent built anything (until yesterday) in at least 3-4 years
general 2023-06-04 16:25:37 unless my memory is just that wrong
general 2023-06-04 16:25:47 Correct
I go by "Myriad" now though
general 2023-06-04 16:25:53 Always have been.
general 2023-06-04 16:26:03 When i was younger I had a project here called "Monochrome Military"
general 2023-06-04 16:26:22 sure. I'll show my favourite.
general 2023-06-04 16:26:53 meet the boi
general 2023-06-04 16:27:06 can you guess what the boi is?
general 2023-06-04 16:27:13 Myriad, yes
general 2023-06-04 16:27:14 hello
general 2023-06-04 16:28:20 give this 4 years for discord to upload and you'll see what "Alfred" does
general 2023-06-04 16:29:15 while discord attempts to upload that, any updates on PC2? There's tons of convo about it in game all the time
general 2023-06-04 16:29:31 I dont check in the community often
general 2023-06-04 16:30:12 Y'see I cant tell if you're being serious or not here
general 2023-06-04 16:30:34 Once again; been here many years
im aware of that lol
general 2023-06-04 16:31:45 could just be sugarposting (Idk what gets censored here)
general 2023-06-04 16:31:58 that video is 2/3 of the way done uploading btw
general 2023-06-04 16:32:02 discord is really trying
general 2023-06-04 16:33:14 nearly done uploading
general 2023-06-04 16:33:44 almost done uploading... cmon discord
general 2023-06-04 16:33:50 its like 3cm off
general 2023-06-04 16:33:56 oh
general 2023-06-04 16:34:04 here you go
general 2023-06-04 17:21:58 I dont think reports -
general 2023-06-04 17:21:59 yeah
general 2023-06-04 17:22:17 they've been closed since 2021
general 2023-06-04 17:22:27 so stuff like this gets away unmoderated
general 2023-06-04 17:22:46 which is usually when roblox itself steps in, but they havent done that in *years* upon *years*
general 2023-06-04 17:23:10 builder games that dont moderate themselves are at risk of being taken down by roblox. Its happened to a few i've played
general 2023-06-04 17:31:57 ayo what's a swashplate
general 2023-06-04 17:32:08 pop quiz
general 2023-06-04 17:32:57 sounds about right
general 2023-06-04 17:33:12 Yes hello you're the 6th or 7th person to recognise me
general 2023-06-04 17:33:26 its a trend among voxel game devs to be untrusting
general 2023-06-04 17:33:32 Not even kiddin
general 2023-06-04 17:34:38 currently pondering how many years ago it was when I started this thing
general 2023-06-04 17:34:50 gotta be at least 2018
general 2023-06-04 17:35:40 it would take so many hours to finish this lol
general 2023-06-04 17:35:54 welp cya
general 2023-07-01 19:51:16 man
Nothing for Plane Crazy in an eternity and the first thing we get to see is a "Gimme money".
general 2023-07-01 19:52:33 *sad reminder that roblox has a god damn stock market for items*
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 07:11:13 wait wth PC actually got updated
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 07:11:39 I genuinely wasn't expecting that, I had started to think it left behind.
plane-crazy 2023-07-07 07:12:11 Like helium blocks?
