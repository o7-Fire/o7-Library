plane-crazy 2023-06-06 14:40:44 it was the link he asked for but servers implement an annoying feature
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 14:41:02 but y doe?
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 14:41:39 they can ban or kick him tho
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 14:42:17 servers be like: ok actually 5,000,000,000 messages should be enough to let you send images
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 14:43:02 tbh im kinda new to this server
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 14:43:17 but i wasn't talking about just this server with that 5 billion messages thing
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 14:43:55 yea but some servers just make the message requirement way too high
help 2023-06-06 14:44:25 bruh. kinda hard to find 1 channel among 50 others tbh
help 2023-06-06 14:45:09 wait i forgot that you need to go to bot central to do it lol

help 2023-06-06 14:45:47 why can't you make suggestions in the suggestions channel?
bot-central 2023-06-06 14:47:55 !rank
help 2023-06-06 14:49:27 some other server added a 1 hour delay to sening messages in the suggestion chanel so i don't see why this server can't do the same. i just wanted wings with hardpoints so you can put stuff on them
help 2023-06-06 14:50:17 btw why aren't there wings with hardpoints already? did no one think of them?
help 2023-06-06 14:50:24 kind of obvious tbh
