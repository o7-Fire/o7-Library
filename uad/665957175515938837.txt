creations-chat 2020-12-13 00:17:36 well what you want to do is get a lock mechanism (lock tower) and take the top two blades and rotate them before locking them into the top blade so it looks then take one whole motor at put it at the bottom of the tower, which should spin the blade entirely <@!716121757131735101>
creations-chat 2020-12-13 00:28:20 also use motors that connect the two pieces of the boat, there are also tutorials on folding, on youtube <@456226577798135808>

creations-chat 2020-12-19 21:23:25 <@!617699741958144020>, not to be a stinch, but if you are the one posting the symbol a mod or admin could punish you for it, so i would suggest not posting the symbols if you don't want a person like OBC to get on to you
creations-chat 2020-12-19 21:25:27 agreed, but i was just saying, idc but others do..
creations-chat 2020-12-19 21:27:32 mhm, but even if, i bet nothing would happen
creations-chat 2020-12-19 21:31:05 bruh, just because we are trying to correct your wrong's doesn't mean we are american, anywho YOU were the one who posted it in the wrong channel not me
creations-chat 2020-12-19 21:34:31 <:what:644996672048463942> <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
creations-chat 2020-12-20 02:27:03 feedback? also <@!557701361853005827> looks good
creations-chat 2020-12-21 21:25:12 lol
creations-chat 2020-12-22 01:05:05 lol what i read above is a good reason for this chat to be renamed for a more "suiting" name
creations-chat 2020-12-22 03:13:29 another argument? same channel?<:PogStare:699130318510227537>
creations-chat 2020-12-22 03:16:41 Dude, you obviously care, i mean how many times have you repeated "idc", legit i can scroll up in chat and see the three times you said idc and even though there is a timer on the text you still say it, meaning you obviously care since you would wait to just say "idc"
creations-chat 2020-12-22 03:19:59 <@!516473488463233024> maybe add a custom wedge that connects the body to the cockpit, i think it would make it look better, to find out how to make a custom wedge using motor lock, there is a tutorial on it, (this channel should be renamed too)
creations-chat 2020-12-22 03:22:42 finally, there should be a petition to rename this chat <:KEKW:670310537300672528>, btw <@!746022074216218625> nothing really, maybe just try to hide the motor lock a bit more, but for the skeleton of a mech its pretty good
