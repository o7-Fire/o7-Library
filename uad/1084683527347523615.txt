general 2023-05-23 05:21:06 Sounds like a man of determination
general 2023-05-23 05:22:04 Sounds like a boy of determination
general 2023-05-23 05:43:18 My guy, you‘ve sent probably like 1,600,000 messages in this server, you can’t say much about self improvement and productivity

general 2023-05-23 05:49:28 In the middle of the Arctic Ocean

general 2023-05-23 05:50:55 Nah AI will take over the world before we colonize mars
general 2023-05-23 05:52:19 Maybe, but we are more than years away from colonizing mars
general 2023-05-23 05:53:12 I got the Snapchat AI to tell me how to make a bomb using common household chemicals
general 2023-05-23 05:54:47 You believe that cheese exists? SMH, sheep…
general 2023-05-23 05:55:33 There is no reason to colonize mars either
general 2023-05-23 05:55:54 Unless mars has got something that we don’t know about on it
general 2023-05-23 05:55:58 Like magic
general 2023-05-23 05:56:06 Or some god
general 2023-05-23 05:56:36 Us going to mars would just complicate things
general 2023-05-23 05:57:07 We got plenty of space on earth
general 2023-05-23 05:57:09 Bro
general 2023-05-23 05:57:17 Alaska is so underpopulated it’s crazy
general 2023-05-23 05:57:41 Alaska is larger than most countries and we only got like 1 city in it
general 2023-05-23 05:58:04 <:empty:794431705070174238>

general 2023-05-23 06:41:22 Are you too new to the server to know who I am?
general 2023-05-23 06:43:32 Games should start competing to see how small they can make the game file, not large
general 2023-05-23 06:44:24 I don’t like the realistic style
general 2023-05-23 06:44:52 Leave realism for real life
general 2023-05-23 06:45:23 Not me
general 2023-05-23 06:46:21 Well personally I don’t even play games anymore so what I like doesn’t mean matter, but I would still want games to turn down the realism, it’s the real cause of global warming
general 2023-05-23 06:48:26 Like the mirrors in Luigi’s mansion?
general 2023-05-23 06:48:40 Instead of ray casting
general 2023-05-23 06:50:31 Ray casting is the future of games
general 2023-05-23 06:50:46 It may not be a good future, but it’s the direction we are headed

general 2023-05-26 10:36:10 Not to be patriotic or anything, but not being allowed to teach religions in schools seems pretty unconstitutional <:noway:1021283202561744977>

general 2023-06-12 21:22:58 Bro 9 minutes?
general 2023-06-12 21:23:08 That’s almost impossible
general 2023-06-12 21:23:16 I Said almost
general 2023-06-12 21:23:43 Even in the military the plank score only goes up to 3:40
general 2023-06-12 21:23:46 For a 100%
general 2023-06-12 21:24:09 Maybe if you are 4‘7
general 2023-06-12 21:24:21 Ok that explains it

general 2023-06-12 21:28:17 1 minute is easy
general 2023-06-12 21:28:24 Not 9 minutes
general 2023-06-12 21:28:53 I Never Said it was impossible
general 2023-06-12 21:29:04 A bunch of people can do it
general 2023-06-12 21:29:28 But it’s more likely that somebody is just mistaken then the fact that they can actually do a 9 minute plank
general 2023-06-12 21:30:10 I Never Said they couldn’t
general 2023-06-12 21:30:16 It’s just WAY harder

general 2023-06-17 23:34:24 well Im making a game similar to one of those, but instead of getting new abilities by having enough slaps, when you first start the game you are randomly selected an ability, and you get new abilities by having a small chance of stealing it from another player when you kill them, so can you give me some ability ideas?
general 2023-06-17 23:35:54 rn all I have made is telekinesis
general 2023-06-17 23:39:25 could you be more specific?
general 2023-06-17 23:40:31 yeah I could try something like that, but that kinda seems worse than no power
general 2023-06-17 23:40:37 because it would take longer to kill people
