bot-central 2021-06-28 15:48:19 ?shelp
bot-central 2021-06-28 15:51:12 &suggest sensors(like distance sensors, color sensors, etc.)
Configurable

sensors that would automatically turn on and off when a certain expectation is met, for example, distance sensor, when you set 10 as distance, if it detects a block at distance 10 or more, it will turn on its output, same with speed sensor, color sensor and others
