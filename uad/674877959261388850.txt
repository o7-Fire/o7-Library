plane-crazy 2022-06-03 23:42:05 I can't
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 23:42:08 without angle motor locks
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 23:42:23 oh I just realized
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 23:42:34 the top chunk behind the seats is motor locked 0.5 too low
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 23:42:40 thats why there is an extra curve
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 23:50:07 I fixed it but there was a half block long chunk missing and i broke the motor locks like 18 times trying to fill it in 💀
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 23:50:13 
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 23:51:34 how am I gonna do the tail area tho
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 23:51:42 
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 23:51:49 way too long to use standard wedges
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 23:52:57 how does camera lock thing work or whatever its called
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 00:07:50 I just did the most illegal thing
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 00:08:04 half blocks with disconnectors on both sides, and a motor at the end
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 00:08:11

plane-crazy 2022-06-04 00:16:08 i know theres a tiny little bump visible on the tail I can fix that
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 00:29:19 on the bottom middle area, ive seen both my design and whats on that 2d picture
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 00:29:22 so I just went with the easier one
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 00:29:38 first image i found with it
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 00:29:52 this one has WAY more of an angle there, but you get what I mean

plane-crazy 2022-06-04 01:02:16 I have tried
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 01:02:27 its to the point where any more changes ill have to redesign half the helicopter
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 01:02:34 or I need to make like
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 01:02:39 a shit ton of motor locks extending halfway across it
plane-crazy 2022-06-04 01:02:46 and spend 5 hours trying to make it to where nothing is visible

plane-crazy 2022-10-09 15:32:23 roblox servers are still feeling the aftermath of the chipotle disaster
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 15:32:28 😱
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 19:30:41 you're doing the corner wrong
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 19:30:45 if that happens
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 19:31:03 fabric is the most buoyant
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 19:31:14 you can make a boat with like 12 fabric blocks and then add the little water jets
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 19:31:18 easily goes 800+ speed
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 19:31:27 no glitch engines or anything 💀
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 21:20:18 😱
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 22:11:18 what do y'all think of the new shoulders/stomach area
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 22:12:26 this was before 🤮
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 22:12:49 no real shoulders
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 22:26:52 is the left jet engine turned onto "reverse thrust"
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 22:27:06 tnt for explosion
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 22:27:10 super rocket for movement
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 22:27:19 and you can add control surfaces if you want to be able to control it better
plane-crazy 2022-10-09 22:27:24 or just wing panels so it glides instead of falling

plane-crazy 2022-10-10 03:43:56 humanoid.
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 03:44:08 it doesnt have to be extremely accurate
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 03:44:24 the fin is mostly just for protection since theres like 1 layer of blocks above my seat and thats the top of the head
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 03:50:22 crap

plane-crazy 2022-10-10 15:25:23 studs per second I believe
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 15:25:38 1 stud = 35cm
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 15:25:40 so like
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 15:26:02 83 speed would be 29 meters per second
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 15:26:05 i think

plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:30:20 the front is wrong
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:30:41 the front on the toy is a wedge shape whereas you made the build have like
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:30:46 deformed semi-circles
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:31:12 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:35:05 the front was more accurate on the top image
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:35:30 oh you put it weird
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:36:39 
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:36:42 replace the middle piece with this
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:36:46 normal wedge on top
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:36:52 half wedge on bottom
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:37:35 no the middle
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:37:42 keep the left and right ones how they were
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:38:42 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:38:57 getting there atleast
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:40:23 also the wheels are supposed to be inside the fenders
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:40:25 not poking out
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:48:42 which side looks better
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:48:46 idk how to make the feet look good lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:52:38 https://streamable.com/p3hhqz
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:52:43 walking still kinda sucks cause the mech is too heavy rn
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:53:08 the feet lift off the ground but sometimes drag
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:54:41 im not, you should see other peoples mechs
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:56:08 this is my first build in 4 months cause I got bored of the game
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:59:19 knock knock
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 21:59:32 not your fish

plane-crazy 2022-10-10 22:01:36 god this thing is so ugly
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 22:01:41 my oldest build that I have saved
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 22:01:45 from mid 2019 💀
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 22:02:01 it has a poseable spine and I hate it so much 😭
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 22:02:23 yeah ik its terrible its over 3 years old
plane-crazy 2022-10-10 22:02:38 <:noway:1021283202561744977>
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 21:00:41 should I replace the oxygen tanks with a giant rocket branching out of the back
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 21:00:45 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 21:00:59 the oxygen tanks arent fitting anymore now that the mech is considerably larger and bulkier
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 21:01:13 they look small now

general 2022-10-11 21:06:56 they made the turtles look funny
general 2022-10-11 21:07:03 I liked when they all looked similar
general 2022-10-11 21:07:06 and like turtles
general 2022-10-11 21:07:11 not humans covered in paint

plane-crazy 2022-10-12 16:04:27 I made mine almost 10 years ago 💀
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 16:04:34 I regret it.
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 19:58:26 line the bottom with fabric if it cant float
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 19:58:37 i highly suggest not using helium
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 19:58:43 it makes it unstable
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 19:58:50 turning the boat could end up flipping it
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 19:58:59 due to terrible weight distribution
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 19:59:14 I also do not suggest it
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 19:59:25 you need more power for going forwards/turning
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 19:59:40 fabric is more buoyant so the boat would float better
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 19:59:48 without altering the weight
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 20:00:02 there are no major drawbacks
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 21:16:44 exposed propellers
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 21:16:51 <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>

the-dump 2022-11-04 02:50:55 it was never good
the-dump 2022-11-04 02:51:03 its just a ripoff of tower battles that got popular
the-dump 2022-11-04 02:51:27 the “good” tower defense simulator was when it was still a tower battles ripoff
the-dump 2022-11-04 02:51:40 cause tower battles is the 🐐

the-dump 2022-11-04 02:56:38 the only thing that is belownatural is the amount of originality that piece of shit has
the-dump 2022-11-04 02:57:40 he used to be a developer for tower battles (owned by planet3arth), then quit and made a **direct ripoff** and one of the maps on release had planet3arth hung on a rope, it was deleted a few days after though.
the-dump 2022-11-04 02:58:19 they basically just stole tower battles, took out pvp, and slowly made it look cooler. that was about it, theres like 3 original towers in the game rn
the-dump 2022-11-04 15:52:32 I did, it got boring after a while

plane-crazy 2022-12-10 02:40:18 people who build walkers are in private servers most of the time
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 02:48:01 less people to interfere/annoy them
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 02:48:04 server has less lag
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 02:48:13 and if there are others in the server you can use pvp blocks

plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:21:55 https://tenor.com/view/nuclear-catastrophic-disastrous-melt-down-gif-13918708
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:22:03 whole plane just falls apart on its own
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:22:36 the motor breaks and half of the plane separates from the rest
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:22:48 while part of it is lodged inside causing it to steer in random directions
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:23:03 I've only ever hit the propeller once
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:23:04 on accident
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:23:11 ive hit it dozens of times on purpose cause it looks funny
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:23:42 im shit at aiming while dogfighting but I can manuever really well

plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:26:05 the design sucks ass so I could probably get atleast 4000 💀
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:26:35 i forgot about conveyor engines ngl
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:26:53 does it shake when you go fast or is it stable
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:27:08 mine is stable but if you make a lot of sudden movements it begins to shake
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:27:12 other than that it works like a normal plane
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:27:19 good maneuverability
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:27:41 same

plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:53:56 all of mine are unfinished
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 04:54:02 I dont think I have a single finished project

plane-crazy 2023-02-26 05:04:20 that's what I did to my mech that I spent 3 years on
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 05:04:28 except it was genuinely an accident
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 05:04:40 I cried that night
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 05:07:29 ????
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 05:07:34 why do you need an incineration room
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 05:10:02 LMAO

plane-crazy 2023-02-26 05:39:07 ⁉️
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 07:07:11 does this look good
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 07:07:13 or atleast decent
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 07:07:21 im making a mech that just has rockets on the ankles instead of feet
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 07:07:27 cause im too lazy to make it walk and it would look cool
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 07:07:34 <:4Weird:709084058721714324>

plane-crazy 2023-02-26 07:18:57 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 07:19:15 get to level 2 on the server and you get image perms in this chat
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 07:19:22 so just talk for a bit
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 07:45:21 just turn the seat 90 degrees
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 07:45:29 your feet might be visible but that's better than both arms
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 07:46:16 fair
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 07:58:47 ong
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 08:20:53 earlier I decided I wanted to make another mech since it'd been a few months
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 08:20:58 why did I have to make it this big
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 08:21:07 I haven't added detail or anything yet and its already 2500 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 08:21:31 mf is gonna be immortal 💀
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 08:22:21 I have a 75 block tall mech that's only 3399 blocks, the one im making rn is 2500 and it only goes up to the knees
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 08:22:33 yeah im gonna swap the blocks for beams
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 08:22:50 remove the block limit ong
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 08:22:55 all my homies hate the block limit
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 08:23:03 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 08:23:11 cause
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 08:23:15 im gonna fight with the mech
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 08:23:22 i dont want it to fall apart from a single hit
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 08:23:27 that's the idea
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 08:23:56 no
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 08:24:00 i dont want it to be unmovable
plane-crazy 2023-02-26 08:24:02 im not gonna use ballasts
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 21:59:39 
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 21:59:44 should I build this mf in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:00:06 I have an action figure of him
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:00:10 and i could use it for reference
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:01:18 I'd probably fail but I could atleast try and make it transform because I can just copy how the action figure transforms
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:01:28 since it doesnt have any additional parts you add/remove, only shift them
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:03:19 i hate hyperbot
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:03:45 hyperbot when I send a video that isnt .mp4
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:23:08 rn im just measuring the figure to get an accurate scale
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:23:11 the biggest I can fit in my plot
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:23:24 the foot is 3.5 blocks, the lower leg is 15.5 blocks, and the upper leg is 13 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:23:47 0.125 inches per block [8 blocks per inch]
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:26:34 tank and jet
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:26:37 not gonna do both, only the tank
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:26:52 
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:27:10 and its gonna be a fully operational mech not just some shitty excuse that cant walk
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:27:17 all I know how to build is mechs
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:27:21 💀
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:27:32 the transformation is really straightforward
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:27:39 its only like 32 steps in the instruction manual
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:27:50 and the steps are as simple as "move this half inch wing piece 90 degrees"
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:27:57 so in reality its only like 8 major steps 💀
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:29:46 accurate to the figure
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:29:58 im using the figure for scale and everything
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:32:09 
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:32:11 this is the scale so far
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:32:41 Foot is 3.5 blocks, lower leg is 15.5 blocks, upper leg is 13 blocks, torso is 16 blocks tall and 15 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:38:32 so a block would be 1.5 feet tall
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:39:06 so for accurate scale blitzwing would be 12 blocks tall
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:39:08 but
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:39:12 I aint making it transform at 12 blocks tall
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:39:14 just for ro-scale
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:39:18 💀
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:39:29 I'd rather eat glass
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:08:21 
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:08:31 pretty much halfway there with the scaling
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:08:33 or whatever you'd call this
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:08:37 just making them 3d
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:08:38 instead of 2d
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:09:09 <@989045746626080789>
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:09:10 im making this
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:09:35 its not standing up straight because of build height
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:09:48 what does variant mean
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:09:49 🗿
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:09:58 I used those colors so I can tell the lines apart easily
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:10:01 organizing by color
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:10:13 if everything is the same color I cant tell where stuff ends and begins
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:10:20 6th grader activities
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:10:58 honestly same
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:11:04 I didnt realize it at the time but that was the peak of my childhood
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:11:07 wasted it
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:11:12 please do
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:11:18 <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:14:37 not legos
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:14:39 legos are cool tho
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:32:23 this shit is making me want to kms
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:32:42 making the legs 3d alone took 3x longer than making the entire thing 2D
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:32:54 it looks like shit rn cause uh
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:32:56 I havent done anything yet
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:33:03 its literally just the measurements
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:33:20 
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:33:22 hehe signs
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:33:30 <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:33:38 it keeps censoring everything I put so I have to rewrite the text like 10 times
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:44:00 did the best I could to line the two up
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 23:44:11 they’re at slightly different angles so it looks odd no matter what I do
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 00:11:26 you probably have too much weight on it
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 00:11:29 add a counter-weight
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 00:41:39 no its blitzwing 😭
the-dump 2023-02-28 01:05:18 
the-dump 2023-02-28 01:05:20 
the-dump 2023-02-28 01:05:26 turned the mf into an abomination
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 22:02:00 no it looks good already
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 22:02:05 unless you want to post it in creations
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 23:33:13 
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 23:33:15 
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 23:33:17 finished the feet
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 23:33:47 the reason the feet combine like that is because they become jet engines in the transformation
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 23:36:39 looks clean once transformed but it shakes during the transformation because motor 2's suck ass so it breaks sometimes
plane-crazy 2023-03-01 22:07:40 what are the best ways to stop motor 2's from shaking
plane-crazy 2023-03-01 22:07:51 I did double motors with counter-weights and they still shake a fuck ton
plane-crazy 2023-03-01 22:46:37 the doohickey
plane-crazy 2023-03-01 22:46:48 
plane-crazy 2023-03-01 22:46:49 
plane-crazy 2023-03-01 22:52:06 probably not but they have more air resistance
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:14:25 
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:14:29 legs are complete
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:14:49 the feet were transformed in that pic this is what they normally look like
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:15:46 just reset
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:15:48 it makes all the blocks unweld
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:15:52 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:16:03 yes it does
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:16:06 they just dont fall apart easily
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:16:15 they delete when you respawn
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:16:17 that's normal
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:16:22 you just need momentum
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:17:21 real

plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:21:43 im building Blitzwing though
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:23:52 mechs are shit for pvp
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:24:06 unless you are doing mech vs mech combat
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:24:20 if you bring a mech into a pvp server you're just begging to be carpet bombed
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:25:08 there's servers for that

plane-crazy 2023-03-12 10:32:53 the sword is 44 blocks tall

plane-crazy 2023-03-17 20:59:21 im trying to put a sign that just says A
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 20:59:23 but it censors it
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 20:59:26 is there any way around this
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:05:33 
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:05:37 what's the point in signs if i cant even spell stuff with them

plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:05:51 it wont let me spell USA separately
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:05:59 im gonna have to put it sideways I guess
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:06:33 nvm it censors USA too
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:08:29 it censors A.

plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:08:33 and A         .
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:08:42 no matter what I do if it includes A it gets censored
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:08:49 same with S
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:08:55 I placed one S sign and then the second one got censored
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:09:02 what's the point of signs if you cant even use them
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:09:09 <:hahaa:773727260539617280>

plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:12:35 its censoring the letter S
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:12:37 for me
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:12:44 any single letter I put gets censored
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:12:47 and I cant even put USA
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:12:51 or U.S.A.
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:12:55 😭
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:13:15 I tried rejoining and everything
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:13:17 but nothing works
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:15:08 nvm I found a way around it just add another word after A and make the text big enough to not include the 2nd word
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:26:31 thats what I did
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:26:42 I just had to repeatedly save and reload the plot to avoid it censoring after like 3 signs were placed
plane-crazy 2023-03-17 21:26:50 cause for some reason reloading breaks the filter

plane-crazy 2023-03-21 22:30:39 probably cause WASD are walking keybinds
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 22:30:50 and the game never reacts to that
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 22:31:05 you cant do anything
plane-crazy 2023-03-21 22:31:08 the only working keybinds are WASD

plane-crazy 2023-05-30 19:56:19 as it stands i only have the frame and the feet
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 19:56:28 he got big feet <:airfryer:1092241693656502372>
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 19:57:29 its like 60 blocks tall
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 19:58:02 I measured it
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 19:58:03 74 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 19:58:06 and it doesnt have the ears yet
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 20:01:10 yeah, most of it
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 20:01:30 probably not the random ankle flesh and stuff
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 20:01:34 cause it just makes it look worse
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 20:01:44 idk why they added flesh just randomly at the ankle, theres none above it
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 20:03:55 I'm using two 3d models for this
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 20:04:01 one that doesnt have the suit, so its just the endoskeleton and flesh
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 20:04:04 and one where its the entire thing
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 20:04:11 im making the endoskeleton and flesh first, then im gonna add the suit
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 20:11:31 the fact that this would be possible if I finish the project
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 20:11:41 but sadly odds are ill lose motivation halfway through
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 20:11:49 just like all my other projects of this size
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 20:12:14 I was making Blitzwing from Transformers and it was around 65 blocks tall and I gave up after the legs, lost motivation
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 20:12:33 looked really good too, kinda sucks I lost all motivation
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 20:13:42 springtrap frame [me next to the foot for scale]
