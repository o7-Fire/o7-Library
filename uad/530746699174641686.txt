general 2021-12-07 19:37:55 This thing is way too detailed
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 19:56:22 How do ballistic block work?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 19:57:22 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 19:58:08 Ok im try build mech so I need ballst block on feets
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 22:50:11 Litterally all my slot saves is animatronics from fnaf
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 22:50:48 I have not made a single aircraft ever
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 22:50:51 Only the starter
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 22:51:09 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 22:54:41 Its there a media channel?
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 22:55:15 No I mean a channel where I can put images
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 22:55:22 No?
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 22:55:38 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 22:55:40 Where's that
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 22:55:45 Anywhere i can show my images
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 22:55:59 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 22:56:07 I dont have access to post images
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 23:00:33 The high limit on plot makes it really hard to build robots and stuff
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 23:01:14 But I still managed to build some
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 23:03:15 Build mega plex
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 23:27:52 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 23:32:37 Plane crazy? More like pixel builds crazy
plane-crazy 2022-01-21 23:32:47 Tbh i see more pixel arts than actually planes
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 00:10:19 Corner wedge in size from 1x2 to 1x4 when?
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 00:10:36 The left and right corner wedge is so useless
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 00:10:39 I never use them
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 00:11:22 Very smart
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 00:11:29 Landing gear as brakes
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 10:11:59 I know
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 12:21:37 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 12:22:07 That's a good place to live
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 12:22:17 Infinity food
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 12:22:34 Shrek house is cooler

general 2022-01-22 12:49:20 Is there any good walking mechanism? Litterally any of my builds walks like an disabled dog
general 2022-01-22 13:45:09 When when the
general 2022-01-22 13:45:12 Imposter is suss
general 2022-01-22 19:58:18 Why is alot Russians people play plane crazy?
general 2022-01-22 19:59:19 Yes
general 2022-01-22 19:59:57 Guys his underpant
general 2022-01-22 20:00:21 15 in dog years

general 2022-01-22 20:00:58 I must say
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 22:59:38 Plane crazy? More like motors crazy
plane-crazy 2022-01-22 23:00:14 00
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 11:04:47 Keep them
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 11:04:49 They add details
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 11:05:44 Im a rather big fan of German tanks so keep them
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 11:07:32 You consider adding them when you done
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 11:08:30 You better adding recoil or whatever you call it
plane-crazy 2022-01-23 15:03:16 Who else looks at a random build and think 'is this really made in plane crazy'

plane-crazy 2022-01-24 14:39:06 People have something against my robot
creations-chat 2022-01-24 14:39:25 I need a feedback on my robot
creations-chat 2022-01-24 14:41:26 I told you they can be hidden i know myself they ugly but I can hide them with motors its not meant to be like that it need to be adjusted with motors behind it and it will be behind the robot to make turns when it flies. I took to screenshot on mobile so I couldn't really find out the controls to adjust them
creations-chat 2022-01-24 14:44:03 If I made a video on my robot I wouldn't get low rates. Its probably the most stable robot your will ever find on plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-01-24 14:46:07 This is just without Armour I can add Armour and more details on it but it will just ruin the stability
creations-chat 2022-01-24 14:48:08 I dont like how my work i spend weeks on get roasted this much 😔 most robots you find on plane crazy doesn't even walk
creations-chat 2022-01-24 14:50:11 The leg is also adjusted with motors
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 05:47:44 Just make some of them not functional
plane-crazy 2022-01-25 05:47:47 Unless you want to
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 20:49:06 Pitch is up and down
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 20:49:10 Yaw is left and right
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 20:49:14 Roll is spin
plane-crazy 2022-01-26 20:49:16 For a plane
creations-chat 2022-02-13 12:07:30 This server is bear racist
creations-chat 2022-02-13 12:17:01 Yet mine is the most accurate one
creations-chat 2022-02-13 12:29:37 Haha cursed freddy says no
creations-chat 2022-02-13 12:32:41 Can it transform into a robot? No? Its not good then
creations-chat 2022-02-13 13:03:46 The votes aren't working
creations-chat 2022-02-13 13:30:42 Its still not WIP since its its just a base then I probably won't work on it anymore so I just wanted to show a base of transforming car to robot
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 15:04:11 I just made bumblebee
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 15:06:52 Motorlok isn't hard but it's just complicated
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 17:14:33 Wait put the video back
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 17:14:39 Pls put it back tho
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 17:15:05 Your plot were surrounded by fnaf stuffs
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 17:15:46 Yeah motorloking
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 17:15:58 Any build without motor lok is bad
creations-chat 2022-02-13 18:53:20 I know my bumblebee is very poor made, I just build it today but I'm planning to build a better one
creations-chat 2022-02-13 19:01:52 Pls no down vote
creations-chat 2022-02-13 19:13:25 High of effort?
creations-chat 2022-02-13 19:31:32 I made it just today, I was just experimenting stuffs to make a transformer
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 19:40:22 I really want to build tank but then i remember that i don't know how motor lok works
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 19:43:02 U know how to motorlokin?
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 19:43:52 Ok I dont care stop flexing you useless talents that is bypassing roblox system
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 19:44:49 You won't be alive by then
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 19:44:51 Just give up
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 19:45:23 Never gonna let you down
plane-crazy 2022-02-13 19:45:36 Never gonna round around and desert you
creations-chat 2022-02-13 21:00:56 Stop waffling and show proofs. Man literally has a schedule in his bio like nobody cares
creations-chat 2022-02-14 20:58:42 <@456226577798135808> ur plane is very much not likeable. Honestly is my middle name
creations-chat 2022-02-14 21:02:07 <@581500505759416340> very much cool, you deserve all the love from every single organisms alive and dead. You should be praised by all gods.  But that thing, it  needs to be eliminated.
plane-crazy 2022-02-14 21:03:39 Can the wheels turn? If so, I could probably need the mechanism if u could teach me
plane-crazy 2022-02-14 21:04:36 Nvm I just realized my truck is going to be way bigger than that so I probably won't need it
plane-crazy 2022-02-15 21:44:48 I've might or might not just made the biggest mech in plane crazy... it folds 5 times and its using up the whole plot so yeah... I just have to give it the finished touch
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 23:26:23 The amount of "can you please make tutorial?" On every plane crazy showcases videos on YouTube is crazy
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 23:26:29 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-02-16 23:26:34 Agreed
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 03:51:25 I hope pc2 is going to make motor lock  removed
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 03:51:30 Who agrees?
plane-crazy 2022-02-23 15:00:44 This game really making me think in an engineering level
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:52:25 I hate when I spend a month on building something and I nearly get done, but they my motivation the last few days said bye and now I havent even finished it for another month. I just, my motivation is gone because of school
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 19:01:25 Why do people build tanks without interior
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 19:03:43 What if not motor locked tank
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 19:04:17 Idc its shitty anyways without the interior
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 19:04:47 Im going to build to a leopard with interior im also building it like 5x large to actually make it possible
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 19:05:21 Not if I make a detailed interior
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 19:05:28 Im making it interior based
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 19:08:55 I will try my best to make it accurate without motor locking
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 19:09:28 I can motor lock details on the hull since the hull doesn't have much interior
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 19:09:55 I dont see how it could be
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 12:29:20 I have a question about that tank
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 12:29:38 How do you make gun look up and down? Did u put motor 2 inside thr tank?
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 12:30:12 Can ur gun look up? If so how
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 17:59:57 I successfully made my first motor locked build, I build a leopard 2a7
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:00:18 Its only the hull tho
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:03:54 
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:04:31 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:04:43 I learned how to motor lock today and made that
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:05:03 I dont know how to
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:05:44 Is roscale really that important?
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:07:23 Even though I used motor locking a few times I still don't understand how it works, I hope plane crazy 2 will make motor locking not a bug but a feature
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:07:43 Its not a feature
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:08:01 But why is it so complicated then
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:08:49 It sure is complicated i just spend 4 whole hours figuring out how to motor lock the 2 round black circles in my tank
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:08:51 
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:09:08 No its not
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:09:20 Ok pls tell.me one thing then
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:09:36 Where is the motor lock tower supposed to start when I need the details at that one spot
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:10:03 Bruh
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:10:31 Why can't it just be a feature where enough select items to go 4 blocks down instead of stacing hella much of motors
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:11:25 It doesn't require skills when you see some guy using motor locks in every server
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:11:42 At this point just delete the lock feature on motors
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:15:45 -servers
plane-crazy 2022-03-12 18:15:49 Bozo
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 09:36:49 Is there a reason to motor lock the turret on the hull for the tank?
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 09:37:13 But like can't I just use 0.9 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 09:37:27 Ok
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 09:37:44 Right
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 11:16:37 How do you make windows lookable from the inside but not outside
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 11:17:06 You know what I mean
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 11:17:09 Like
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 11:17:20 Make the windows clear on the inside but outside its not clear
plane-crazy 2022-03-13 17:55:21 0.9 block wedges would be so helpful i swear
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:04:43 Plane crazy 2 needs a feature where you can select a block or more and rotate it with degrees instead of angle locking which take ages to get exact
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:05:20 I dont want to spend 5 hours trying to make the angle right
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:05:56 Bruh
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:06:22 But whenever I make a blocky build it will just get downvotes
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:06:41 Its roblox for god sake
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:07:26 Yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:07:34 Thats blocky
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:07:52 Because its hidden in the shade
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:08:15 No I could build the exact same thing but use day light and it would get 0 upvotes
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:08:39 Whenever there is that blocky gap you will only expect downvotes
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:09:01 With angle locking wich is stupid
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:09:46 That was a joke bro
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:11:58 You been working on that jet for over a month?
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:12:43 I would expect something bigger or cooler on 1 month
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:13:33 Fold it more
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:15:51 Plane crazy?more like motor lock your shitty build for 500 hours crazy
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:16:50 I know how to motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:27:58 I didnt try to make it look good I just wanted to see if it functions
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:28:34 I havent posted anything good in creation
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:28:58 Im working on this detailed leopard 2 tank
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:29:00 
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:29:12 U ass
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:30:17 Do i look like someone who knows where an engine is on a tank
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 06:30:40 Back turret
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 14:33:11 Did you know motors works like joints? They can go up down side to side but motors can also do something joints cant do. Lock, motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 17:58:06 Why can't I freeze the motor locks
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 17:58:10 
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 17:58:22 Anyone see the problem?
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 17:59:08 But when I press the key it doesnt
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 17:59:11 Go down
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 17:59:24 I'm just asking what is the problem
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 17:59:41 Does yours work?
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 17:59:51 I press the disconnect
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 17:59:53 Key
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 17:59:59 But it doesn't disconnect so I don't know
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:00:19 My key is J
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:00:23 Why?
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:00:36 Should I remove all trails?
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:02:02 Still not work
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:02:10 I did that at the end
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:02:23 Id it because my tower go upwards and yours go sideways
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:02:51 But I need to then to do angle lock
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:03:31 What is the problem with the disconnecters
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:04:05 I think its because of how my tower go upwards
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:04:23 Then ill never finish my tank
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:04:33 Ok I will try springs now
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:04:38 I just need a tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:04:41 I find on yt
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:04:59 What
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:06:14 Its complicates
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:14:24 Now what the
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:14:35 The springs work but now the whole thing doesn't want to motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:14:46 Instead of motor locking down it goes up
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:14:50 This making me crazy
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:15:11 Disconnecting and spring is both not work good
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:16:42 Is these yt videos outdated or smt
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:16:46 I do exactly like them
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:16:49 But its not working
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:17:00 Is it because my tower is upwards?
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:17:35 Bruh ain't no way I'm going to drive around a tank with no turret
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:17:51 I should just stick to the blocky turrets that get s100 downvotes smh
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:18:11 Is it because of the trail settings or smt
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:18:23 I think its because of trail settings
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:18:34 Istg if it is
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:23:05 Can anyone legit tell me whats wrong and whats the problem here
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:23:10 
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:23:19 I did remove the trails but its still not woring
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:28:21 It doesnt
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 18:28:46 I figured it out now
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 19:26:27 Which turret should I go with?
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 19:26:36 
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 19:26:49 Top one i use angle lock i will add more details too
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 19:27:09 Buttom one is just straight up build with wedges and blocks
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 19:27:24 What
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 19:27:42 I dont have disc on my pc
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 19:27:52 No
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 19:30:12 What
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 19:30:54 Why should I use the tool
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 19:31:19 What can I do to make it better
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 19:31:48 Nty
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 19:32:16 Yes I see no problem
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 19:32:41 It won't hurt you so
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 19:33:10 The turret?
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 19:33:16 No
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 19:33:44 Ok I will for your sake
plane-crazy 2022-03-14 19:56:08 Its roblox you don't have to think 3th dimensional
plane-crazy 2022-03-15 06:11:38 Why
plane-crazy 2022-03-15 06:11:45 I guess it wasn't good then?
plane-crazy 2022-03-15 06:12:10 To finish it ?
plane-crazy 2022-03-15 06:13:03 Motor lock, just motor lock and angle lock and piston lock

plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:30:57 Can't deny the past either

plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:31:09 We can't do non about it but accept the past
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:31:25 Its for safety

plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:31:32 Its for the best

plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:37:07 ?pls gay
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:37:33 But then again histo-
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:37:36 Is history
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:37:45 Can't deny the past, can't change it either
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:38:44 You're obviously denying it if you don't want to see it
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:39:11 Tell that to guy who's trying to report it
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:39:33 Then again history is history
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:39:35 Can't deny it
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:39:38 Can't change it either
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:40:13 Too start off this debate let's look at what denial actually means.
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:40:33 A synonym for denial is no
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:41:21 When you look at that image you're obviously thinking "no" i dont want to see it.
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:41:27 Which basically means
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:41:33 You're denying it
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:41:38 Which also basically means
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:41:41 You're reporting it
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:41:44 Which obviously means
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:41:48 Denying
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:42:12 I'll shut up k
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:42:35 Im not saying ur wrong but history is history
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:43:14 Agreed
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:43:15 But
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:43:22 Even if its offensive
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:43:27 Its still history
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:43:33 And something nobody can forgot
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:43:35 So
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:43:43 If you're reporting that certain image
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:43:50 That means you don't belive in history
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:44:32 Lets look at it from the bright side
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:44:38 There is no bright side
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:45:08 Its an old German flag whats so offensive about it other than the action?
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:45:34 Thats the actions part
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:45:45 The flag itself isn't offensive
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:45:48 Its the actions
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:46:46 No
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:46:54 I'm Russian what about it
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:48:19 I changed it
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:48:52 Now I have to show i support something that I really don't I don't mind it though
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:49:01 Yk i don't even need it
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:50:05 That's why I did it, simple
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:50:40 I certainly wouldn't a break a rule 😳
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:51:05 No sarcasm
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:51:27 Whats unde
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:51:31 Underage?
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:51:52 Underage as like under the age of 13m
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:52:09 Typo
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:52:21 I'm not under the age of 13
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:52:29 I purposely used proper grammar to show that
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:53:16 I'm not 😂
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:53:59 You're thinking that animals is NSFW? Should I be worried or smt?
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:54:56 Sarcasm usually goes with emojis smh
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:55:12 Like im sad 😂😂😂😂
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:55:21 Im very happy 😭😭😭😭
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:55:30 Im alive 💀
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:55:43 Its an example smh
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:57:47 Teens usually don't use grammar in message so why should i
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:58:24 Teens are children's good you know
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:59:05 Because an Asian teen should probably not know English as its not their first language?
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 18:59:43 You're kind of stereotyping asians
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:00:01 Thinking that all asians know English perfectly
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:00:45 It didn't backfire
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:00:58 You just simply misunderstood that sentence
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:01:31 Asians teen should not know English as its their first language
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:02:24 This feels like mass harrasment towards me, why shouldn't it be me calling tinon back
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:04:57 Russia, I stated that twice
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:06:10 Not Thailand and myanmar
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:07:18 I don't see this as an discussion
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:07:41 I didnt say that
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:08:24 This i said
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:09:38 Argument or simply socializing?
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:09:54 Wrong
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:10:30 Then you had a stroke reading English, and not because of my sentence ss there's no grammar fail in it
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:11:52 You're trying hard to make me look bad and put me in the bad spotlights just to make tinon ban me
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:12:10 Because of you mentioning my bio
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:12:22 Argument or socializing?
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:12:37 No
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:13:08 I was just socializing bringing stuff up, but you guys totally didn't agree me thats why it turned into a discussion
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:13:26 Agin you're trying to get me banned
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:13:34 How many times do I need to say that I'm not underage
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:13:52 How many times do I need to tell you to stop harassing me
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:14:12 <:OkBuddy:652567204453154816>
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:14:24 Thats what I though to be honest
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:16:10 I think its better for me if I end my so called "arguments" and not socializing here, smh.
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:16:32 Its what
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:16:45 Whos unde
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:17:10 How about you stop continuous telling me that I'm an unde when I'm telling you that I'm not
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:18:02 Why would a moderator just ban a guy that hasn't broken a single rule? I have been warned once for my bio so why should I do it again
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:18:23 Teens usually don't use grammar in messages
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:19:13 You're just continues pining mods for no reason, here you are with no proofs and here i am with no rule breakings
plane-crazy 2022-03-23 19:20:23 I did change my status so whats the problem?
