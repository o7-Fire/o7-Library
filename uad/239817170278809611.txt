creations-chat 2020-05-17 12:15:53 I don't even understand, was the poster of the p40 warhawk trying to pass it off as his own? Or was he trying to show off the color scheme?
creations-chat 2020-05-17 12:31:11 no

creations-chat 2020-08-29 23:53:06 I don't know how I used to build planes without em
creations-chat 2020-08-29 23:53:25 I tried doing it without the locks, and I didn't have enough wings and control surfaces to fly
creations-chat 2020-08-29 23:55:34 it's less manuverable without em
creations-chat 2020-08-29 23:55:56 any way I can solve the problem without stacking hundreds of control surfaces?

help 2020-12-17 21:00:09 How do you do a motorlock where some blocks are turned?
help 2020-12-17 21:07:10 How do you delay a motor lock? I've done a ton of regular locks, but I've never delayed one
help 2020-12-17 21:11:11 Wait, so how would that work? You put disconnectors inbetween the locking motors and release them after the parts have turned?
help 2020-12-17 21:13:13 like this?
help 2020-12-17 21:14:22 ?

help 2020-12-25 15:51:25 Does this look like a viper?
help 2020-12-25 16:30:50 You might have to motorlock them on
help 2020-12-25 16:32:26 Yeah, the intakes are very small, motorlock a conveyor into the side if you want a simple intake, although you could do something with half blovks to make it more interesting
help 2020-12-25 18:18:06 Should these side-winglets be wing panels or half blocks?
help 2020-12-25 18:18:19 building a viper
help 2020-12-25 18:19:40 I think the half blocks look better. Thoughts?

help 2020-12-25 23:23:21 https://streamable.com/s4xthl It keeps turning to the left despite all of the weight being perfect. Reversing the blades on the main propeller makes it turn the other dirrection. I have spent 7 hours on this and I have no idea what is wrong. Can anyone help?
help 2020-12-26 00:37:02 Use a motor and set the motor to lock
creations-chat 2020-12-26 00:42:07 https://streamable.com/dhm17c Does anyone know why the heli bobs when I start and stop moving? I have tried adjusting weight and air resistense at both ends at the heli. Also, does this look like a viper?
creations-chat 2020-12-26 00:44:37 How would I do that?
creations-chat 2020-12-26 00:47:09 So I should just leave it as it is?
help 2020-12-26 03:27:06 Thank you so much! I saw this late, but it actually worked! I am endlessly grateful.
creations-chat 2020-12-26 14:30:26 Thoughts on my viper?
creations-chat 2020-12-26 15:01:42 How would I go about fixing the rotor?
creations-chat 2020-12-26 15:04:22 Wouldn't it spin one direction with only one rotor set?
creations-chat 2021-01-08 03:41:19 I wanted to make an overcomplicated landing gear system. If I wanted a simple one I would just put a small landing gear. I need all the motor lock to stack them in the right position to open and not colide]
help 2021-01-08 23:58:13 Could anyone give me a nice afterburner design? I need one for a mig 23
creations-chat 2021-01-11 19:08:57 Still working on it and am no-where near done, but could I get some feedback on the paint? It's supposed to be a mig-23
general 2021-01-22 22:02:23 Anyone else's motor 2s breaking?
general 2021-01-22 22:02:44 Not just me then, lol. Any news on them fixing it?

creations-chat 2021-04-10 19:27:36 working on a yak 1, could I get some constructive criticism?
help 2021-04-10 23:47:28 does this look like a yak-7b?
help 2021-04-11 00:10:26 Any way to lower it without obstructing the pilot's vision? motorlocking the seat 1/2 down makes the seat too low to see, so is there any other way to make the cockpit lower?
help 2021-04-11 00:17:35 makes it seem like someone bonked the plane with a hammer
creations-chat 2021-04-12 04:55:23 got downvote bombed, what did I do wrong? it's supposed to be a yak 7b
creations-chat 2021-04-12 04:57:44 can't do anything about it, half blocks are too small, normal blocks are too tall

creations-chat 2021-06-01 16:38:16 Looks great, tons of detail, motorlock used to a great extent and the shape is very fitting.
creations-chat 2021-06-01 16:45:41 I've seen some cool builds using mostly motorlock, I think it's a unique style but both builds are very different
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:27:42 how much exposed lock is alright? because I have a fuckton with no way to clean it up
creations-chat 2021-06-02 21:04:18 Does this look like an f35? I have done way too much motorlock and it looks ugly as fuck
creations-chat 2021-06-02 21:10:04 Alright, thanks man
