plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:50:07 And how many rotors are necessary for a successful helicopter
plane-crazy 2018-12-06 00:50:15 does the second rotor act like a gyroscope?

help 2018-12-09 20:52:17 another question
help 2018-12-09 20:52:30 does using beams rather than blocks reduce lag due to less block count
help 2018-12-09 20:55:13 <@163143541160148992> Do super rocket engines have the same mass as regular blocks? if not, more or less?
help 2018-12-09 20:55:21 more or less mass*
help 2018-12-09 20:56:28 I'm trying to balance out the centers of gravity and flight in a large jet
help 2018-12-09 20:56:47 I had ice blocks in because I thought they were heavier but I'm going to replace them with rockets
help 2018-12-09 20:58:29 I literally
help 2018-12-09 20:58:38 never thought of weighing blocks that way
help 2018-12-09 20:58:43 you have enlightened me
help 2018-12-09 21:01:23 four super rockets weigh less than a block
help 2018-12-09 21:01:25 feelsbadman

plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:36:08 someone needs to make a venator class star destroyer big enough so that I can park my A-Wing inside of it
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:36:20 that would be actually so sick
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:36:35 to park a star fighter in a venator in the air
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:36:48 it would just be difficult figuring out how to weld it on
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:37:02 and move the ship with the star fighter inside of it
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:38:16 <@!324607962079297536> There's no way to park a fighter inside of that venator
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:38:46 There's no opening in the star destroyer to park
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:39:31 The middle has hangers on the side in that model
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:39:35 but due to the scaling of the game
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:39:40 it's impossible to park a star ship in there
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:40:08 https://gyazo.com/068dd885da0863adda514de41b58907f
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:40:31 Pretty big ship, yeah
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:40:56 we would have to have literally like three people combine ships to make something that big
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:41:37 wait a minute
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:41:41 how do you piece that together tho
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:41:57 and then how do they lock
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:42:34 too many parts for me to understand or try to understand
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:42:36 I tried building big once
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:42:45 lol I couldn't figure out how to piece it together
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:43:40 I think I specialize in making modern aircraft and smaller scale fighters
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:43:50 I build an F-35 to scale just about
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:43:53 built**
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:43:56 It's CTOL, however
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 01:44:07 So it's conventional instead of vertical

creations-chat 2018-12-17 01:48:34 My latest creation: a replica of the MiG-35. Can reach up to 500sps, 504 part count. Highly maneuverable for such a big replica plane. Armament: 4 missiles, 4 machine guns mounted under the wings. More could be added, however it would sacrifice aerodynamics or looks. Requesting expert builder. (P. S. if i get 10 upvotes i get master replicator rank please help me thanks)

plane-crazy 2018-12-19 22:23:37 the only problem with folding wings is that you must set the centers of gravity and flight almost exactly on each other

creations-chat 2018-12-20 02:42:49 This is the F-111 Aardvark. It's armed with six machine guns and four missiles, but can hold much more. The Aardvark features swept wings and a unique 60s-70s jet design. Despite boasting 1003 parts, the jet can go over 300sps. The wings will only sweep when all four pylons are dropped.

plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:27:42 idea
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:27:53 if i used the four pylons on the bottom of my aardvark
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:27:56 and added two more
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 22:28:04 because they are detachable could they be used as bombs?

general 2021-07-11 14:29:27 Yooooo I got unbanned, I'm so glad to be back in the community server
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:32:19 <@!509810265915916318> Just a question, why did you build your plane all vertical with pistons and stuff like that? I'm an old player and I've never seen that before.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:35:28 <@!611251614178869269> I played whenever the bomber role literally just came out, then proceeded to get banned from the discord from 2 years for being toxic. Can you elaborate on what a motorlock is?
bot-central 2021-07-11 14:36:30 As I said in the <#504436696021204992> channel
bot-central 2021-07-11 14:36:34 Got banned for two years 😐
bot-central 2021-07-11 14:36:43 This server probably used ro-ver
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:40:53 No need to be toxic, I want to learn not argue
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:43:58 You don't think that's a little toxic?
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:47:38 <@!783822669182795806> Yeah really not a good first impression of the server, but I guess that's just the root of this game. Roblox was already bad as it is, being in a snobby plane-nerd community that rivals the nature of games like War thunder and HOI4 just makes it worse.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 14:51:25 Anyway, ignoring the argument for now, can anyone help me troubleshoot a plane I built a few months ago? will fly but is constantly veering off to the opposite side any time it tries to turn.
help 2021-07-11 14:54:16 Can I send videos into here?
help 2021-07-11 14:54:35 Answered my own question

help 2021-07-11 15:01:30 This is my raptor I built a few months ago, I'm having trouble getting it to turn.
help 2021-07-11 15:01:52 Already aware that the nose is way too heavy, hence it tipping down, but I don't know why it turns the inverse of the direction I point my mouse.
help 2021-07-11 15:02:34 Can you elaborate?
help 2021-07-11 15:02:42 oh nevermind
help 2021-07-11 15:02:55 As in programmed control panels?
help 2021-07-11 15:10:31 <@!343426781442736138> this works regardless of the centers of mass?
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:13:17 You guys are really stuck up, the only way that the supposed "white name" creators are going to learn is by positive and critical feedback, not snobby comments.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:17:36 stuff like this? haven't seen him say anything, yet he's being dog-piled for posting probably his first build, rather than just giving him some upvotes and some criticism. You're not being insulted, you're just being overly snobby and rather toxic
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:19:57 <@!711009848438947850> this you?
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:22:28 actually, this is his most recent build on 6/26
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:25:56 I'm not trying to be a jerk, considering that's what I was just speaking on, but you can't go, I quote: 
"Man there are some talented people here in creations

Then there are the acceptable people who at least know their shit

Then there's the white name noob posts that make you want to vomit"
and then have stuff like that sitting up in creations.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:29:52 Why are you critiquing other people's builds for being bad if your builds have haunting like:dislike ratios? All I'm saying is that you could stand to be a little bit more uplifting, rather than constantly downvoting builds that don't look like perfect, block by block to scale models of the jets that they resemble. It's really toxic, and hypocritical.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:34:30 <@!711009848438947850> well to answer your question, here is a screenshot from a build 3 years ago I made to get the bombardier rank. Also to answer <@!588596347272167456>, this is a build from 3 years ago proving that I am an older player.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:39:23 Glad that I got my point across 🙂

general 2021-07-11 15:54:56 oh uhhh
general 2021-07-11 15:54:59 it said to ping a mod
general 2021-07-11 15:55:16 is there a better person to ping
general 2021-07-11 15:56:57 I'm sure they will come back if they were just here
general 2021-07-11 16:05:58 yowza
help 2021-07-11 16:08:55 Does the torque of the aerilon make it pivot harder?
help 2021-07-11 16:12:22 not talking about the setting torque lol
general 2021-07-11 16:12:41 don't worry the first one tired me out
help 2021-07-11 16:12:57 
help 2021-07-11 16:13:31 If the motor is in the middle of the wing vs. the extreme of the wing, will it pivot harder due to increased torque?
help 2021-07-11 16:16:36 Because of algebra based physics
help 2021-07-11 16:17:32 If both motors are applying the same force, but the wing to the right has a bigger radius than the one to the left, then according to the formula for torque, the wing to the right should have 3 times the torque or the wing to the left
help 2021-07-11 16:17:45 or 2x sorry
help 2021-07-11 16:20:41 Which way are you folding them in? <@!711717986943238175>
help 2021-07-11 16:20:44 I might be able to help
help 2021-07-11 16:21:34 On my raptor model that I'm working out what I did was a piston attached to a car wheel attached to a motor
help 2021-07-11 16:21:43 But it folds into the body of the plane
help 2021-07-11 16:22:13 Oh, it's like mine!
help 2021-07-11 16:23:12 I used a motor 2 servo with a 90* max angle on it being toggled
help 2021-07-11 16:23:24 and just used G as the keybind
help 2021-07-11 16:23:31 It may take some trial and error
help 2021-07-11 16:23:35 is the light blue part the servo?
help 2021-07-11 16:24:07 Just use one of the keys as G, because it's a toggle
help 2021-07-11 16:24:16 the other can be un-binded to something you won't press
help 2021-07-11 16:24:30 and set the torque to unlimited so that it works
help 2021-07-11 16:24:39 or max
help 2021-07-11 16:24:59 yw : )
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:33:10 That's very reasonable
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:37:58 With competition comes progress, but of that, while most people are proud of their builds here to say the least, the problem comes in when the pride of the critics blast their ego so high that they can't stand to give any feedback or criticism to low tier builders and just end up insulting them, and it's kinda gross to see.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:47:11 people get warned for low effort? lmfaoooo
creations-chat 2021-07-11 16:50:06 me omw to the creations channel to post my tutorial plane

the-dump 2021-07-11 16:59:03 maybe it comes off like that
the-dump 2021-07-11 16:59:56 I still don't get the whitename thing
the-dump 2021-07-11 17:00:13 just because someone hasn't posted a successful creation doesn't mean they're a troll
the-dump 2021-07-11 17:02:44 I mean I get that, like the dude that made an ice cream truck in creations lol
help 2021-07-11 20:45:35 Does anyone have a demo of motorlocking engines onto eachother?
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 21:05:18 Has anyone made this yet?
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 21:05:19 
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 21:05:49 How can I find an image of it? I wanna see
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 21:05:57 nvm lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 21:06:39 I might have to mess around w helicopter physics before I attempt and embarrass myself lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 23:04:06 yo screw motorlocking, now i gotta experiment until I find out how to detail planes w motors
plane-crazy 2021-07-11 23:04:22 whoever came up with this you suck
help 2021-07-11 23:20:49 Should I build a base model then motorlock for detail or just start off motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 12:46:24 IS there any way to custom motorlock besides private servers?
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 12:46:54 I'm assuming just blacklisting everyone on a pvp server? lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 12:47:54 What else can I use
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 12:53:01 For critiquing people who don't motor-lock so much, this community is awful at helping people when they want to learn
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 12:53:55 Thanks
help 2021-07-12 13:15:04 How do you make outlines of cockpits using motorlocking?
help 2021-07-12 13:16:46 Oh interesting, thanks
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:32:49 bro you didn't give any criticism
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:32:57 you pinged me and said 'ok' and refused to help out
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:33:46 😐 😐 😐
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:33:55 wow, so helpful
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:33:59 what a friendly community
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:34:38 The random ping going "ok" and then proceeding to act like you just saved the day
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:38:53 Recognizing it is the first step
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:41:21 So <#504436696021204992> is just the arguments channel
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:41:30 <#384021699466756107> is just the arguments channel but a little less intense
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:42:05 And there's literally different people in different channels lmao
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:42:50 Literally got in a heated argument as soon as I said something in <#504436696021204992> for the first time

plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:47:07 I also don't get why people spam downvotes so hard
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:47:49 Well I don't mean it in that way
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:47:50 I mean
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:48:10 If something doesn't look like it came out of war-thunder, then all of the critiques decide to mob it
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:48:37 Despite the critiques themselves building tutorial planes
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:49:14 I was here in 2018 lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:49:29 Too bad I was still banned then
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:51:01 What are rank reqs anyway?
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:52:35 Oh interesting
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:52:48 You could have someone else record you
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:55:18 So the whole point of motorlocking is to stack blocks on top of eachother that aren't supposed to, right?
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:55:42 So like cockpits
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:55:59 Is there any way to fit motorlocks into a 1 block space?
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:56:09 Like if you had a 1 block wide cockpit?
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:56:40 And vertical motorlocks are easier to hide than horizontal?
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:58:33 Do you have any screenshots of before and afters that I can study?
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:59:12 Before launch and after with motorlocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:59:42 No as in
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:59:50 I want to see images of builds before they launch
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 13:59:53 that have crazy motorlocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 14:00:30 Yeah I wanna see how other people have used them
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 14:04:20 Interesting
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 14:04:32 That video is super helpful
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 14:05:54 To build that nose cone you just used an adjustable motorlock and collided the same nose twice?
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 14:06:20 Did you do the same sort of thing for the cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 14:07:13 So do you need to use tnt for adjustable motorblocks or are the other methods just as effective?
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 14:09:31 Is it just the most convenient?
plane-crazy 2021-07-12 14:16:50 I'm slowly figuring this out
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:08:56 I have such a great idea but I know I'm gonna have to motorlock details to build it
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:09:22 You know the starter jumpship from Destiny 2?
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:09:31 I'm a long time destiny fanboy
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:14:08 Holy shit guys
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:14:11 I figured out how to use a motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:14:50 I know I'm saying I finally learned lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:15:14 2011
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:15:34 I joined roblox in elementary school

plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:18:50 I played roblox on my 2014 hp office laptop
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:19:13 Of which the Intel i3 processor in it literally did not run any faster than 1.8ghz per thread
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:36:25 Can you use glitch engines on planes
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 14:36:27 Or only helicopters
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 16:02:29 Hey, could I get some feedback on this build thus far?
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 16:03:55

plane-crazy 2021-07-13 23:24:50 What else can I do besides this
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 23:24:52 
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 23:24:53 Because otherwise
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 23:25:06 
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:50:37 Your plane is so fast yet unmaneuverable
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:50:55 Oh I was ab to say
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:50:59 that's pretty terrible movement wise
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:51:07 I've seen bigger planes turn on a dime
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:51:49 Being maneuverable at slow speeds is more important in pvp, anyway.
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:51:53 You get better aim off
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:52:20 Although I'm no expert, I don't normally go into pvp
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:52:36 A guy I ran into today said that my Arcadia would make a monster pvp plane whenever it is done
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:54:21 I used to hate pvpers
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:54:24 back in my day
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:54:32 They made planes that were the size of tutorial planes
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:54:44 and slapped 2 super rockets on it
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:54:46 and max guns
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:54:49 and called it a pvp plane
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:55:16 Cheapest shit ever :\
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:55:22 I love my model planes
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:55:34 I could never
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:55:53 Even if they're all old and shitty by this standard, they are still dear to me
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:56:43 So the front refueling thing
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:56:48 How did you make those cylinders so small
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:56:54 What part is that?
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:57:03 Sounds like I missed some event
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:57:16 Which winter event
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:57:44 I've done a few winter events but never gotten those
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 03:58:16 I probably missed it

plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:21:16 To study other builds
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:21:26 What if there was like
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:21:31 A copying thing
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:21:37 but it copyright'd the plane
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:21:39 like
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:21:48 You could put it on your plot, but not touch it. and it'd say "made by ___"
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:22:20 bc I would love to study others' builds
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 04:24:13 Disable pvp copying?
creations-chat 2021-07-14 04:45:29 jajaja funny balloon
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 06:08:21 I'm in the middle of a motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 06:08:29 But I also have to be up in 6 hours
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 13:10:23 You could motorlock the exterior but not make a bomb hatch?
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 13:22:30 Just mlock a bombing hatch
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 13:23:01 Or redo the bottom so you can drop actual bombs
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 13:23:06 Or at least hide exposed explosives
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 13:23:48 Idk your nose is a bit weird
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:15:48 Do not buy PC
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:15:50 no prebuilts
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:16:02 Build your computer like a real man
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:16:35 That's wrong lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:17:00 Just because it's prebuilt doesn't mean the performance deteriorates
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:17:37 The only bad thing about prebuilts is labor costs
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:17:44 Which is like an additional $50-100
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:17:47 Which is crazy
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:18:04 Depends on the builder
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:18:35 For example an HP build might be cheaper than a small builder because they can manufacture their own motherboards **however** those motherboards are usually shitty to conserve cost
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 14:55:05 Can you use glitch engines in planes?
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 14:55:10 Like a hover engine +motor
