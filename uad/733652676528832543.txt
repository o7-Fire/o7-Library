creations-chat 2021-03-12 20:16:43 They're cursor tracking missiles launched from my submarine, took me forever to get working remotely well

(ignore that 3rd missile launch, I had my cursor pointed right behind it so it wasn't exactly happy with its instructions lol)
creations-chat 2021-03-12 20:18:44 this is from the outside view before I made an interior 
(aka it wasn't laggy.)
creations-chat 2021-03-12 20:20:58 fun fact that submarine is the exact same shape as the fuselage of my Ac-130 (minus the landing gear well)

plane-crazy 2021-03-26 00:10:15 if it goes fast on the ground then you dont have enough lift
plane-crazy 2021-03-26 00:10:21 if it is slow then you need thrust

the-dump 2021-11-13 04:09:26 or should I insert some real eyes
the-dump 2021-11-13 04:09:41 that would take a little longer
the-dump 2021-11-13 04:09:51 I would have to scower the web for a transparent one
the-dump 2021-11-13 04:10:49 alright, fair.
the-dump 2021-11-13 04:10:54 (I'm doing it anyways)
the-dump 2021-11-13 04:13:10 wait
the-dump 2021-11-13 04:13:18 how do I make the background color of paint not black
the-dump 2021-11-13 04:13:26 so transparent images don't just have a black background
the-dump 2021-11-13 04:27:16 
the-dump 2021-11-13 04:27:27 so it took me a while because I couldn't get a transparent one
the-dump 2021-11-13 04:27:29 so I just colored over
the-dump 2021-11-13 04:27:32 but uh

the-dump 2021-11-13 04:27:50 so arguably a step down
the-dump 2021-11-13 04:27:51 yeah

creations-chat 2021-12-19 02:20:06 hof?
creations-chat 2021-12-19 16:19:08 my typhoon got 53 downvotes as of now, does anybody have feedback so I can actually make it better
other then "more motorlock", because that seems to be the only reason people downvote. the creation could look fine as is but people just say add more motorlock.
creations-chat 2021-12-19 16:40:47 cockpit is the right size, I guess the nose is basic but the real thing didn't have any fancy shapes either, it was just a cone. it's proportional, I looked at pictures from the sides and such, I'll agree the bombs are simple and I could make those more detailed, and yes the diamond exhaust suck ass but I couldn't really find a much better way of making it work. I could try cylinders but they have no opening at the back. Opening cockpit is so I can actually get out, and I hate just putting a hatch on it. also wouldn't work because its a half block at the top. The landing gear could be bigger but theres not really a space to tuck one into the fusulage, I would just have to make it stick out and fold on the outside, which is pretty damn ugly.

one thing I will add though, the airbrake doesn't look great. its very difficault to make an opening air break that will both open and be flush
creations-chat 2021-12-19 16:43:22 so the things I agree with are that the bombs could be more detailed, and the exhaust is indeed a diamond and looks ugly as hell. Also I could maybe make the airbreak smoother, but that would be very difficault and probably make another area look bad.
creations-chat 2021-12-19 16:46:15 one, the picture you decided on was the one with everything open comparing it to the real plane with everything closed, and two how would you like me to make the fusulage slightly smaller and still allow everything to be attached properly and such, and have room for things on the inside

yeah obviously its not perfect but alright
creations-chat 2021-12-19 16:51:22 bro? "not sharp enough" it literally has a pyramid at the end. sorry there isn't a 1x3 pyramid wedge in the game. the cockpit on the real thing probably looks larger because the fusulage meets it in the back, theres no such thing as a 1/2 glass 1/2 default block, and the fusulage is 3x3 so idk what it being too tall means.
creations-chat 2021-12-19 16:55:34 I'm going to fix the bombs and exhaust, but you just saying my thing looks bad for stuff that I cannot fix is bullshit. also you have said multiple "reasons" it looks bad that are just not true. you say the fusulage looks too tall even though its 3x3. I get that I asked for feedback and I appreciate the stuff you said that could be fixed, but some of it quite frankly is either impossible or not worth and a half hour of effort just to make it look slightly better.

and to the nose thing that <@!706913175030726657> has said, yeah the real thing is tilted slightly down, but can you give me an idea on how to fix that. There are no wedges or anything in the game that are that slight of an angle, so if you have any ideas I'm listening.
creations-chat 2021-12-19 16:59:06 wait, nah you right I gotta fix that. Apparently I saw a pic from the wrong angle. its way smaller
creations-chat 2021-12-19 17:01:16 <@!706913175030726657> that would be a wayyy sharper angle then the real thing, and <@456226577798135808> I will remake the airbrake when I work on it, and will also fix the bombs and exhaust. I may try to find a way to make the cockpit smaller as well ig, but theres no way to do the detailing where the fusulage meets the cockpit in the back the same way.

<@!725358947904651335> what. "constructive critizism" isn't saying something looks like absolute shit, give stupid reasons without ideas of how to fix it, then call them and idiot and leave.
creations-chat 2021-12-19 17:10:40 jesus christ I knew people here were annoying but god damn. glad to see instead of having a nice helpful community we got a bunch of people who just yell at people like apes to do the right thing. minus 1man, who's actually being helpful, and n00b was trying to as well, and I apologise for escelating that. apparently I'm not allowed to ping people or dyno decides to delete my message, so i'm just gonna say names now.
creations-chat 2021-12-19 17:18:39 holy shit three people telling me to leave just because I disputed peoples arguments. and yes my build isn't the best, I realise that. and I also realise everyone here is better then my, but I feel like theres just no respect for effort. nobody gives a shit how hard you try, they only care if your end product satisfies their above average expectations. I will try those four suggestions I said I would, and I get that I probably am annoying by "challenging them" but I feel like feedback means to help someone through something, not just say that ___ looks bad and needs to look better. And with the time I took typing this 3 more people have asked me to fuck off, so I will do that. goodbye extremely hostile "feedback" channel.

oh and go ahead say your final fuck you's and such, as I'm done responding
creations-chat 2021-12-19 17:29:05 (not starting or continuing an arguement)

typhoon improvements:

better exhaust |  | 
better bombs |  |
smaller air break |  |
smaller cockpit |  |
smoother rudder |  | 
better nose cone |  |

is this good?
creations-chat 2021-12-19 17:33:29 its a checklist, I will do all of that when I work on it

the-dump 2022-06-08 21:38:05 takes so long to drain with pumps
the-dump 2022-06-08 21:38:12 even if you have like 10 stacked ones
the-dump 2022-06-08 21:38:18 that is if you have the space

the-dump 2022-07-22 21:23:44 Its literally an f35 smol brain
the-dump 2022-07-22 21:23:49 Look at the exhaust
the-dump 2022-07-22 21:24:13 Exhaust is clearly a single round one
the-dump 2022-07-22 21:24:32 And it doesnt have the bubble cockpit of an f22
the-dump 2022-07-22 21:25:16 
the-dump 2022-07-22 21:26:06 Bro its clearly and f35 dunno what you're talking about
the-dump 2022-07-22 21:26:43 Agreed
the-dump 2022-07-22 21:27:29 Usually when its hard to tell if a joke was a joke, it wasnt a very funny one

the-dump 2022-07-22 21:30:20 Same, of all the 5th gen fighters that is probably my least favorite
the-dump 2022-07-22 21:31:25 My top three would be f22, f35, then su57
the-dump 2022-07-22 21:31:33 In descending order
the-dump 2022-07-22 21:33:49 f35 I put above su57 just because vtol and stovl is cool

creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:32:16 It was implied with the reaction.
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:41:25 I feel like comparing russian jets to western ones is the only fair comparison. Comparing the US with Russia is comparing the two main military superpowers. Most european countries do not have as much military power and spending as russia  or the usa, making it unfair.

You cant just compare a superpower to the most likely adversary to it. Thats like comparing an american abrams to an afghan technical.
