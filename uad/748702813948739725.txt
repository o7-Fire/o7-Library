general 2020-12-27 22:10:50 yes i is going on a.
help 2021-02-09 15:25:48 i made a .pdf of suggestions that are too big to fit in the <#507673335816126509> channel, who should i send it to?
general 2021-02-09 15:27:50 oh god no
bot-central 2021-02-09 20:39:48 can someone walk me through the `&󠀕suggest` feature, i've read how to do it but i just want a bit more additional help, yes i have something to suggest
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:32:08 removed because it apparently broke a rule c:
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:41:04 i love to break the la-
***The FBI has canceled this message.***
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:41:35 lol its unwatchable, read <#533294912586645521>
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:41:41 plus no sound and sped up x4
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:42:08 its still not physical piracy, reread rules*
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:42:42 please tell me you actually read the rules
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:43:20 then why are you confused
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:44:25 is there a secret cult of cute bunnies or rabbits who hold little mini-rituals when everyone in the server is asleep that hand out secret pamphlets that have secret rules on them that are not listed in the <#533294912586645521> section ?
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:45:20 i just reread the <#533294912586645521>  section word for word three times in a row
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:45:37 and in none of the rules does it say anything about posting 1/3 of a distorted shrek movie
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:46:34 here, put this in to perspective. if i took the entire Bee movie in to adobe premiere, and distorted the sound and video to the point where it's unwatchable, and then compressed it, and uploaded it to Discord, it isn't piracy.
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:46:53 only slightly altering it would still be piracy
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:47:23 doesn't matter, not the same thing
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:47:28 you're taking things out of context
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:47:52 cars are already legal.
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:48:38 there's no rule in the law that says that cars shall not be driven whatsoever, i'm talking about literal copyrighted media
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:48:43 a car doesn't have copyrights
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:49:26 that's not physical copyright
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:50:32 a dude who owns a car can't go to jail and turn himself in for owning a ***car***
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:51:12 it is, actually
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:52:31 dude you're literally arguing about a meme
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:52:35 what rock do you live under ?
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:52:46 i beg to differ
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:53:30 I'm literally saying that it's pointless you're arguing about a meme
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:53:36 how can you not understand
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:53:55 well then that's just a case of bad moderation
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:54:13 but fully distorted movies that you can only tell by the title of what they are, is not, in fact pirated.
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:54:17 NOW the argument's over.
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:54:35 "what"
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:54:51 what
the-dump 2021-04-25 12:56:13 ok

general 2021-06-27 22:58:03 Lmao
general 2021-06-27 22:58:18 rick when rick:
bug-reports 2021-06-27 23:03:35 it also used to happen with parachutes, i have no idea if rick patched the parachute fling bug or not tho
bug-reports 2021-06-27 23:06:53 i understand i might be the 4,000th person to say this, but is there any update on the lava lag glitch for low-end devices?
bug-reports 2021-06-27 23:07:35 on low end devices and some smartphones, when any build goes into lava, it lags the receiving end device
bug-reports 2021-06-27 23:07:53 i mean
bug-reports 2021-06-27 23:07:58 i usually don't
bug-reports 2021-06-27 23:08:12 but it happens on some standard and low end pcs as well
bug-reports 2021-06-27 23:09:31 i'm really curious as to what causes it though, other than the fact it changes each individual block colour to 0,0,0 by doing some sort of fade thing and then deletes it
bug-reports 2021-06-27 23:10:16 it could use some sort of grouping system to avoid this issue, any blocks that are under the lava that can't be seen by the player, don't render the colour change and delete like normal
general 2021-06-27 23:18:06 aw

plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:45:20 did you hear that someone made a lag script for plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:45:32 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:45:39 12??
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:45:43 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:45:46 my bad lmao

plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:48:36 you guys know why my motor wheels are all of a sudden bouncing from left to right?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:48:57 can you make one that matches the current plane crazy ui tho
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:49:06 i think we know lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:49:46 or you can reverse engineer some scripts
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:49:56 a king
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:53:05 it would be nice if rick added a feature where...

**i forgot**
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:53:33 💀
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:53:43 ohh
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:54:21 it's being rewritten
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:54:32 so hardcoded isn't an issue
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:55:05 I hope we will still be able to play the legacy version of Plane Crazy after the rewrite launches
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:56:26 i have a cool idea: if a build is larger than 1,500 blocks, a prompt will show up and will scan for too many ropes, rockets, etc and determine if a build is a lag machine or not
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:57:04 because honestly lag machines need to be euthanized
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:57:15 one way or another lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:57:46 true, but the spammer just counteracts by adding a lot of blocks to bypass the system
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:58:28 no, there's a 'silent' anti-lag machine script in place so you're right
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:59:14 might be ice
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:59:15 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:59:28 we totally need neon as a texture tho 100%
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:59:33 why was granite removed?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 19:59:44 ohh
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:00:33 *perhaps*
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:00:39 maybe just light neon
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:00:45 huh
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:00:56 what was the message

plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:07:51 why can you upload .mp4 files but not .mov files?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:08:07 is there some kind of vulnerability with .mov that isn't in .mp4 ?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:08:17 a bot in this discord server prevents it
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:08:55 ohh
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:09:03 lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:09:19 should rick patch image printing script?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:10:18 it pretty much prints any image you want on to a bunch of blocks
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 20:10:36 but this can be used for nsfw material and i've seen it done before
