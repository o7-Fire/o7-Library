The Tale of voxelex (786647949580435487)
general 2022-05-11 01:48:46 are Shredder Bugs really banned?
general 2022-05-11 01:49:15 I don't want to know about your opinion, i want to know if they are or not
general 2022-05-11 01:50:13 where does it say on the rules
general 2022-05-11 01:50:53 yes, but in pvp, sparks are supposed to fly
general 2022-05-11 01:51:05 arent they talking about while building?
general 2022-05-11 01:51:26 so in other words, using cutters are banned
general 2022-05-11 01:51:30 makes lots of sense
general 2022-05-11 01:51:57 i can tell you have never piloted one
general 2022-05-11 01:52:37 so yeah, whats the difference between cutters on tanks and cutters on shredder bugs?
general 2022-05-11 01:53:33 does that mean shredder nukes are op?
general 2022-05-11 01:53:56 where you launch cutters with tnt with the intent of killing shredder bugs and other extremely fragile builds?
general 2022-05-11 01:54:22 true
general 2022-05-11 02:06:45 LOL
general 2022-05-11 02:06:50 who has a mech
general 2022-05-11 02:06:58 i wanna mech fight someone
general 2022-05-11 02:07:23 who?
general 2022-05-11 02:07:29 im new around here
general 2022-05-11 02:07:56 i wasnt gonna say that
general 2022-05-11 02:08:10 you hang around too many edgelords or something
general 2022-05-11 02:15:51 i guess, but technically a spiked tank would win against a shredder bug because the tank would break the shredder's drill and any other cutters hiding on it
general 2022-05-11 02:17:04 Wait really?
general 2022-05-11 02:17:12 not the common tutorial shredder
general 2022-05-11 02:17:53 i will enjoy it when shredders get nerfed in plane crazy two
general 2022-05-11 02:18:29 oh you mean the sphere shredders
general 2022-05-11 02:18:37 those things are a handful to deal with
general 2022-05-11 02:18:46 you need a lazer tank and lots of luck
general 2022-05-11 02:19:30 Really? i've seen way more singular shredder bugs than shredder spheres and bug armies
general 2022-05-11 02:20:03 475
general 2022-05-11 02:20:26 dang
general 2022-05-11 02:20:30 it must be painful
general 2022-05-11 02:22:37 who has a conveyor drive
general 2022-05-11 02:23:44 Quick question, does rule #3 include Shredder Bugs and other melee vehicles?
general 2022-05-11 02:32:08 so apparently bad words arent banned>
general 2022-05-11 02:32:16 im sure they are
general 2022-05-11 02:32:23 someone disabled automod
plane-crazy 2022-05-11 03:17:00 üëç
general 2022-05-11 03:46:32 my mech was destroyed by the most massive joe mama shredder
general 2022-05-11 16:22:29 why cant i submit my mech in <#917397949938548736> ?
general 2022-05-11 18:16:47 we need an autosave
general 2022-05-19 19:46:21 a mongus
general 2022-05-19 19:46:28 dont remove the space
general 2022-06-16 14:44:58 bruh the chest opens randomly in my mecha strike commander because the half blocks are making sure there is no gap. But it somehow opens randomly
help 2022-06-16 14:49:14 When I close the chest of my Mecha Strike Commander, it will randomly open
help 2022-06-16 14:49:24 i put half blocks on the edges
help 2022-06-16 15:18:57 cuz its not a full size build and that is where the pilot seat is
help 2022-06-16 15:19:13 a full size version is impossible in this game
help 2022-06-16 15:27:10 It is still too big canonically
help 2022-06-16 15:32:15 i fixed it by switching the half blocks to half wedge down
help 2022-06-16 15:54:06 whats wrong with it?
help 2022-06-16 15:54:57 pfft nothing wrong with my build then LOL
help 2022-06-16 15:56:36 ok?
help 2022-06-16 15:56:43 does our prefrences matter?
help 2022-06-16 15:57:05 also, fortnite is higher quality than COD even if its main gamemode is a complete rip-off
help 2022-06-16 15:57:48 maybe we just have different preferences then
help 2022-06-16 15:58:17 fortnite is the highest quality of all three most popular games
help 2022-06-16 15:59:07 i wanna hang with gen z not crappy gen alpha who likes poppy playtime the bendy knockoff
help 2022-06-16 15:59:28 good
help 2022-06-16 15:59:40 k
help 2022-06-16 15:59:51 i respect your opinion then
creations-chat 2022-06-16 16:15:55 cant believe my mecha strike commander only has 4 dislikes cuz "fOrTnItE bAd"
creations-chat 2022-06-16 16:29:35 1/2 correct. I play fortnite. I am not a slender. too lazy to change the username from 2018 or so
creations-chat 2022-06-16 17:04:23 looks like sh*t <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-06-16 17:27:58 is it better to be hated for using fortnite based builds, or shredder bugs?
general 2022-06-16 17:29:01 im hated for both <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2022-06-16 17:30:25 this is the only person with common sense, because there are many fortnite machines that are perfectly balanced, only thing is people hate it(for a reason that is yet to reach me), meanwhile shredder bugs are actually gamebreaking
general 2022-06-16 17:33:36 if a furry hates fortnite but defends themself from a furry hater, i will not defend them because fortnite and furries are hated for the same reason
general 2022-06-16 17:35:05 i dunno where you got the basis from that meme, but as funny as it is, it is quite untrue
general 2022-06-16 17:36:25 uh, unlike roblox, fortnite is not pay to win. the item shop is boring and repeats itself.
general 2022-06-16 17:36:53 a 9-year-old who think it is ok to spend that much money on a video game is spoiled
general 2022-06-16 17:42:47 in old games, you could buy gears, you could get camoflauged avatars, most gamepassses are completely ptw, etc
general 2022-06-16 17:43:10 In fact, Roblox is the most pay to win of all three most popular games
general 2022-06-16 17:43:35 closed because i no longer want to argue with someone who has no evidence
general 2022-06-16 17:44:05 no, i mean Minecraft, Roblox, and Fortnite
general 2022-06-16 17:44:56 LOL mental is not against lol
general 2022-06-16 17:45:17 but the word that means the same is
general 2022-06-16 17:51:25 i blocked the jerk so i won't have to listen to his shit
general 2022-06-16 17:51:44 i have won an arguement once again
general 2022-06-16 17:54:51 i get it, you all are stupid. leave your stupidity out of me
general 2022-06-16 17:55:50 you're right, I should chill
general 2022-06-16 17:56:28 but you can't say i lost the arguement when my opponent had no basis or evidence
general 2022-06-16 17:57:27 Yes, we should respect eachothers opinions.
general 2022-06-16 17:58:01 i guess
general 2022-06-16 17:58:32 Dude, when someone says they hate fortnite, it is never a joke
general 2022-06-16 17:58:54 old enough to use mic
general 2022-06-16 17:59:14 Of course, if not, I wouldn't have discord
general 2022-06-16 17:59:42 Well, I assure you that I am not underage
general 2022-06-16 17:59:54 where is that?
general 2022-06-16 18:00:44 I know this is gonna sound like an excuse, but I have a gaming pc with no built in mic
general 2022-06-16 18:01:28 How about I join you on roblox and say numbers
general 2022-06-16 18:01:40 i still use GTX 745
general 2022-06-16 18:03:05 its funny how yall are suspecting me to be underage cuz i said that when someone hates fortnite, they always mean it
general 2022-06-16 18:03:23 got it

help 2022-06-16 23:39:10 the fish
help 2022-06-16 23:39:44 i was talking about the fish, and also you turned RTX on with the top image
help 2022-06-16 23:40:47 even so the ground is just a jpeg image ripped from google, with the lowest triangle count ripped from sketchfab or the roblox toolbox free models
help 2022-06-16 23:41:36 both of them
help 2022-06-16 23:42:12 i don't have time for this
general 2022-06-16 23:42:29 trol
general 2022-06-16 23:42:34 you lie
general 2022-06-16 23:42:50 alright, if it is real, I want in
general 2022-06-16 23:42:53 but if not i will know
help 2022-06-16 23:44:21 are you making fun of my GTX graphics card?

plane-crazy 2022-06-17 01:13:28 even "fOrTnItE bAd" couldn't stop me from getting 8 upvotes on my IO titan tank
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 01:14:02 it still dosn't stop it from looking like sh*t
general 2022-06-17 01:14:43 i have a GTX 745 so i cannot turn on RTX
general 2022-06-17 01:15:59 Do you wish to join the cult of shredder bugs?
general 2022-06-17 01:18:14 I am the leader of a cult of shredder bug users
general 2022-06-17 01:18:45 a cult of one personü•≤
general 2022-06-17 01:27:26 Use max speed motor 2 with a cutter drill and super rockets at front, and wings at the back
general 2022-06-17 01:27:29 >:D

bot-central 2022-06-17 21:09:16 !rank
general 2022-06-17 21:23:22 i requested a rank but no admins are online bruh
help 2022-06-17 21:45:33 I need someone with a mech to fight my horrible mech for a youtube video
general 2022-06-17 23:53:47 trust me, this game has one of the most toxic communities in roblox
general 2022-06-17 23:54:26 yes, people are barely toxic in the actual game
general 2022-06-17 23:54:57 im only here to get a rank so i can suggest machines controlled by multiple people via the pilot seats and wait for people to think its a good idea
general 2022-06-17 23:55:31 maybe we can have it PC2
general 2022-06-17 23:56:13 don't you think it would be so much easier if, instead of piloting your mecha team leader alone, have a weapons team that can control your rockets and guns?
general 2022-06-17 23:56:28 relatable
general 2022-06-17 23:56:49 not rlly + he left

general 2022-06-17 23:58:11 ouch that looks like something i would build 2 days after joining
general 2022-06-17 23:59:18 was not spamming
general 2022-06-17 23:59:24 ayyo what
general 2022-06-18 00:00:29 If I barge into this community and say "Fortnite is awesome", i would have 9000 people cussing me out, meanwhile if i barge into, say, Kaiju Universe's community and say the same thing, we got 9000 people casually agreeing or disagreeing
general 2022-06-18 00:01:22 I agree
general 2022-06-18 00:01:27 but most people dont
general 2022-06-18 00:01:50 white?
general 2022-06-18 00:02:55 believe me, all of us started out with gunned boxes with guns and getting our asscheeks clapped by tanks and shredder bugs
general 2022-06-18 00:03:41 I literally joined the discord a few days ago
general 2022-06-18 00:04:19 my friends say I am a plane crazy gigachad, which means i am somewhat below average, but I dont suck necessarily
general 2022-06-18 00:04:33 lol
general 2022-06-18 00:04:48 don't elaborate
general 2022-06-18 00:09:03 i am literally waiting so long for a mod to respond
help 2022-06-18 02:09:06 How do I get an admin to see my rank request without breaking a rule
general 2022-06-18 02:09:56 bruh several admins and mods have been online and not one decides to review my rank request
general 2022-06-18 02:10:55 I saw what you deleted

general 2022-06-18 14:28:21 is that a joke or are you serious
creations-chat 2022-06-18 14:52:09 Its not my fault the glass obscures text
creations-chat 2022-06-18 15:15:10 I will explain this lack of detail: I wanted the fans to light up, I don't know what a front AIO or a C-mos battery is, there are fans, i am too lazy to make cables, the "ram slots" are actually the ram itself, there are lots of pcs with no psu shroud, there is no CPU cooler because I wanted it to be visually pleasing to those who don't know how to build computers.
creations-chat 2022-06-18 15:17:57 its actually a low budget asus rog strix geforce rtx 3090... ti. the mushrooms are supposed to be fans

creations-chat 2022-07-20 15:14:11 I wonder if my RGB build was hated for being a shredder bug, or hated for being posted in creations
creations-chat 2022-07-20 23:05:20 It wasn't even based on a tutorial(exept for the tutorial made by me)
general 2023-01-14 15:57:50 yo i have an old server, does anyone wanna recycle it?
