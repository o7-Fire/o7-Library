general 2020-04-22 18:36:33 roblox is very unoptimized though
general 2020-04-22 18:36:57 my phone runs those kool mirror games but on roblox mobile the resolution is like upscaled 480p
general 2020-04-23 23:28:04 oh no god why
general 2020-04-23 23:28:06 game shutting down
general 2020-05-11 23:52:18 removing outlines means faster updates
if they remove it, it means no more keeping or updating slower, older code
general 2020-05-11 23:52:36 i'm not gonna miss outlines
they looked nice but I hated how if you used blocks of different sizes it looked ugly

bot-central 2020-05-11 23:53:19 oH
bot-central 2020-05-11 23:54:29 &suggest Instead of using the custom decal outlines for every build, make it so that it only shows for your build in edit mode.
general 2020-05-11 23:55:05 for optimization why not just use decals for outlines on your own build in edit mode only to see the blocks better
general 2020-05-11 23:55:50 ricc
general 2020-05-11 23:56:02 will decals for outlines be used on all builds in the server
general 2020-05-11 23:56:59 <@!235207095740268545> its only SmoothNoOutlines, not SmoothWithOutlines
and that's getting deprecated soon too
general 2020-05-11 23:58:33 **simple solution**
show outlines **on your build only,** and **only when its in edit mode**
general 2020-05-11 23:59:41 oh yeah selection boxes exist and you don't need to use 9-slice fgjosdfgjsdfg magic textures
general 2020-05-12 00:00:04 no
general 2020-05-12 00:00:09 darn.
general 2020-05-12 00:00:23 famous last words
general 2020-05-12 00:00:30 also famous last words
general 2020-05-12 00:00:48 `i'll be fine`
general 2020-05-12 00:02:50 oh yeah with outlines blocks are randomly colored
so make sure that you randomize colors by a little
general 2020-05-12 00:03:28 maybe a setting to toggle it?
general 2020-05-12 00:03:33 it looks nice imo
general 2020-05-12 00:04:02 maybe do it on load then
general 2020-05-12 00:05:27 colors are randomized
general 2020-05-12 00:05:28 example
general 2020-05-12 00:05:59 its a side-effect of the outlines
general 2020-05-12 00:06:01 randomized colors
general 2020-05-12 00:07:19 e
general 2020-05-12 00:07:30 shadows off
general 2020-05-12 00:07:33 lighting on compatibility
general 2020-05-12 00:07:34 its the outlines
general 2020-05-12 00:11:29 s e l e c t i o n b o x e s
general 2020-05-12 00:12:57 60 fps
general 2020-05-12 00:13:01 it does lag when i get close to it though
general 2020-05-12 00:13:26 but thats 1286 parts all in the same spot
general 2020-05-12 00:13:31 so in normal gameplay it shouldn't happen
general 2020-05-12 00:14:37 the only reason it lags is because its 1286 parts in the same 16x16x4 stud space
general 2020-05-12 00:15:41 super long wedge
general 2020-05-12 00:16:18 adopt wedges <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
general 2020-05-12 00:17:37 i wish roblox supported linux
general 2020-05-12 00:17:43 the only reason i'm not on linux is because of roblox
general 2020-05-12 00:18:38 if you exist you are a noob
general 2020-05-13 14:50:46 are speaker blocks locked behind a paywall
general 2020-05-13 15:23:27 why are speakers 298 robux dngojasrhgonawerohaw
general 2020-05-13 15:23:47 speakers are 298 robux and there's still a tip jar lmao
general 2020-05-13 15:24:40 ~~this reminds me of games that will do anything for money~~
general 2020-05-13 15:24:48 and you can't even close it
