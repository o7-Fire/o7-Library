help 2021-06-22 17:49:23 Hey so, I’m having trouble with my wheels, whenever I’m trying to build a car rn, the wheels don’t turn the entire body of the car, it’s just makes it go one way stiffly, like diagonal. Everything was working fine yesterday tho?
help 2021-06-24 23:19:44 I completely forgot to mention that I’m on mobile lmao
help 2021-07-08 02:12:24 Why aren’t my wheels working. I’m on mobile but they won’t turn the entire car one way, they just turn it like sideways keep it facing forward and it’s really pissing me off cause it’s been like this for a while now
