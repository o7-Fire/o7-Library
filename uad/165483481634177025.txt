general 2021-02-13 22:25:06 it was fun and all but like, it didnt have that classic halo feel
general 2021-02-13 22:25:11 it was basically a reskin of a cod game
general 2021-02-13 22:25:30 WHUT
general 2021-02-13 22:25:34 nah nah nah
general 2021-02-13 22:25:40 Halo CE was the best magnum
general 2021-02-13 22:25:50 halo 2 looked the coolest, but like, its stats were AWFUL

general 2021-02-13 22:31:28 Then "borons syndrome"
general 2021-02-13 22:32:02 sometimes you just need to do stuff like that, they did that back in the 70s with project MK Ultra, they were trying to give soldiers LSD and shit to make them super soldiers, left a lot of people all fucked up from the vietnam war
general 2021-02-13 22:32:35 I mean they got their desk jobs and high paying positions because of it though, i wouldve just ended it tho, living being crippled and having been a failure
general 2021-02-13 22:32:46 SPARTAN 4s ARE JUST KIDS IN ARMOR
general 2021-02-13 22:32:55 yes
general 2021-02-13 22:33:24 I know that Is just failed and they created a whole disability
general 2021-02-13 22:34:00 I mean spartan IIIs were also really deadly because they basically openely recruited and seeked out people that had their family killed by glassings
general 2021-02-13 22:34:15 I mean jun just said "ight imma head out" in reach lol
general 2021-02-13 22:34:27 reach was really gritty and i loved it
general 2021-02-13 22:34:41 ODST was also really nice but it was more of a story telling game tbh
general 2021-02-13 22:34:51 I liked the grittiness of halo reach
general 2021-02-13 22:34:55 however halo 3, is a forever favorite
general 2021-02-13 22:35:03 oh hell yes
