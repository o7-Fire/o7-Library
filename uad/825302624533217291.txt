The Tale of tc_red (825302624533217291)
general 2021-06-21 11:12:12 Hi dudes
general 2021-06-21 11:20:29 Have you guys even seen a gigantic plane in the game yet
general 2021-06-21 11:21:51 just recently saw a giagantic build, taking like, an upper fold, left fold, right fold, and a dwon fold. i was expecting that thing to be prey to shredder bugs in pvp
general 2021-06-21 11:22:40 Well yeah, but, **just, still prey to shredder bugs**
general 2021-06-21 11:23:03 Now thats the real name of those annoyers
general 2021-06-21 11:23:46 I think there where builds that are anti shredder bugs
general 2021-06-21 11:24:37 Did you forget to make your armor spikes
general 2021-06-21 11:25:09 the outide of your buildss being just a bunch of spikes to fight back shredder bugs when they touch you
general 2021-06-21 11:26:17 Also who had the combo of destroying a whole shredder bug army by just yourself
general 2021-06-21 11:28:02 Please be more aware because I think those damn shredder users are thinking of a way to make shredders that are capable of getting in water
general 2021-06-21 11:28:41 Ive seen that multiple times, its almost immune to shredder bugs
general 2021-06-21 11:29:24 But still, those shredder balls still have to be aware, those shredder bugs are evolving abilities
general 2021-06-21 11:30:36 Im a dude that loves making hover crafts (drones) i rarely make hover crafts that **i** sit on
general 2021-06-21 11:31:33 Builds are going to be evolving as well
general 2021-06-21 11:32:42 I want a better and bigger map, an island on the ocean, and the whole ocean able to be interacted with, and alos i dont want a random island that is literally floating above the abyss
general 2021-06-21 11:33:27 That is when rocket ships will have a goal and a purpose now
general 2021-06-21 11:34:22 and make it so that when you are high enough, the sky will turn black or dark, to look like your in space
general 2021-06-21 11:34:45 like a mini one, or just like, one planet
general 2021-06-21 11:35:39 hes talking about another "planet" maybe call it an "isnet" (mix of island and planet)
general 2021-06-21 11:36:10 wait what word did i just make
general 2021-06-21 11:36:25 dont tell me i scrambled an odd word
general 2021-06-21 11:37:03 Have you even tried motor locking to fit more stuff into a tiny space
general 2021-06-21 11:37:48 "Bildiong" you almost got me to wheeze

but **no**
general 2021-06-21 11:38:09 eyes?
general 2021-06-21 11:38:12 eyes on what?
general 2021-06-21 11:39:08 i was about to say "how is that bad" but then I saw the "got it off a tutorial"
general 2021-06-21 11:40:28 How about a pile of gigantic islands all over the ocean with one of them containing a bigger spawn area
general 2021-06-21 11:40:49 and a bigger build area
general 2021-06-21 11:41:17 we'll have more space to travel on everywhere the game
general 2021-06-21 11:41:33 yes
general 2021-06-21 11:41:50 **we didnt want a big rectangle island floating above the abyss anyway**
general 2021-06-21 11:42:43 who even applied to make a small rectangle island above the abyss and nothing else
general 2021-06-21 11:43:18 and more areas to spawn your vehicle
general 2021-06-21 11:43:48 I wondere if i can make a 4 or 6 legged mech that walks on walls
general 2021-06-21 11:44:23 ***dreaking***
general 2021-06-21 11:45:01 how do you think is that gonna go lift off the ground
general 2021-06-21 11:45:16 I meant ***fly***
general 2021-06-21 11:45:43 OH WAIT
general 2021-06-21 11:45:46 OH
general 2021-06-21 11:45:49 nevermind
general 2021-06-21 11:48:16 I haven't said this one yet but, here.
How about proper biomes like, a good desert, snow biome, grass biome (already everywhere), and other biomes (what you guys can think of)
general 2021-06-21 11:50:10 Rudeness much?
general 2021-06-21 11:50:42 Oh wait nice City idea
general 2021-06-21 11:51:33 Who here makes spinners that launches anything it touches, **everyewhere**, i have 2 of them, one is normal, the other one has an ability to stretch out one blade
general 2021-06-21 11:53:26 **what?**
general 2021-06-21 11:54:13 That's a tank, how iss that anime
general 2021-06-21 11:55:03 I'll just invade the city a bunch of times with a giant hover craft im gonna make
general 2021-06-21 11:55:36 and of course
***bombing***
general 2021-06-21 11:56:24 if you can fling the buildings in the city or destroy buildings in the city, that'll be great if i wanna make chaos there
general 2021-06-21 11:57:48 lmao, just put the normal pvp fighting physics into the cities when your gonna put them in chaos
general 2021-06-21 11:59:04 ***uh oh***
general 2021-06-21 11:59:23 ***get the anti shredder forces immediately...***
general 2021-06-21 12:00:05 Hope that's enough to destroy shredder bugs.
general 2021-06-21 12:00:24 Hold on a second
general 2021-06-21 12:00:30 why is my stats idle
general 2021-06-21 12:00:45 huh?

general 2021-06-21 12:07:04 has anyone yet, saw a shredder bug that, instead of killing you, it flings you everywhere instead
general 2021-06-21 12:07:55 ive seen a shredder bug that does not have weapons, some sort of friendly one
general 2021-06-21 12:08:21 what should we call the friendly shredder bugs
general 2021-06-21 12:08:56 but what if its a friendly shredder bug
general 2021-06-21 12:10:20 i have 3 hover drones, they all drift when moving and turning, cool movement, but when it flips over, it almost spins forever

plane-crazy 2021-11-02 10:12:57 I just made a tank and whenever it touches the water it has a chance to break, the chance is higher when I go full speed.
