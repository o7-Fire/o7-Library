plane-crazy 2022-08-08 17:36:15 Question, if I put control surfaces inside my build, will they still work?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 17:36:49 Weird.. I have put a TON of control surfaces inside my spaceship and it just will not lift off
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 17:38:10 Sure where do I show it?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 17:42:10 What game is that?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:38:34 Question, If I have filled up half of my entire spaceship up with control surfaces only for WS and it still will not work, what do I do?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:40:20 Anybody that can give me some answers or ideas?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:41:21 then what do I use?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:41:54 but it just makes me unstable
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:44:14 what if I used a hover engine for speed, super rockets for lift/pitch and then control surfaces for movement?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:44:36 would that maybe work?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:45:12 its 2.2k blocks, its hollow..
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:46:47 unless?

plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:47:40 wait hol up magnet engines?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:48:29 but how would i use that for pitch and yaw?
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 18:49:21 I guess, tho super rockets would probably be much more controlled
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 19:57:00 I am just about to ditch my new spaceship because I cannot get that thing to fly good, I found out how to make it fly, but once it does it won't let me go down, and once I'm down It just for some reason won't let me go up. I have no idea what to do anymore, I have tried hover engines, piston engines, super rockets, control surfaces, etc, so Is there anybody that can at some point idc when could be tmr or next week, but at some point arrange a time so they can check on what the hell is going on with this spaceship.
plane-crazy 2022-08-08 20:49:44 kk thanks for the response
help 2023-01-19 14:37:39 How do I make a submarine stay stable in the water? like I can add helium and ballast blocks but when it comes to turning it will either flip or begin to nose dive down or up
