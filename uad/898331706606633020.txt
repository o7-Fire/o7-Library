general 2022-09-11 12:26:05 i guess it technically is a ship
general 2022-09-11 12:26:08 or a boat
general 2022-09-11 12:26:14 or a hovercraft

general 2022-09-11 12:27:39 hi (Excuse my horrifyingly bad English skills.)
general 2022-09-11 12:28:33 Bruhh what wrong with google
general 2022-09-11 12:28:50 I searched l.c.a.c and i find a descriptive report about a gatling gun
general 2022-09-11 12:30:23 i actually pray that the new gun in pc2 looks better then a burnt rubiks cube with mustard on top
general 2022-09-11 12:31:00 Ball motor??
general 2022-09-11 12:31:06 yeah definitely
general 2022-09-11 12:31:19 im pretty sure theres gonna be an infinite ocean?
general 2022-09-11 12:31:22 so ships will be much more useful
general 2022-09-11 12:31:37 naval war
general 2022-09-11 12:31:41 im so hyped for pc2
general 2022-09-11 12:31:56 i heard that apparently all of your save slots will get moved into pc2
general 2022-09-11 12:32:03 so you dont have to cry about losing something you spent 9 weeks on
general 2022-09-11 12:32:20 new lag machine invented
general 2022-09-11 12:32:38 especially with soft body physics
general 2022-09-11 12:33:50 bruh pc2 gonna be crazyyy
general 2022-09-11 12:33:55 (literally)
general 2022-09-11 12:34:20 yeah of course
general 2022-09-11 12:34:33 hydrogen.....
general 2022-09-11 12:34:43 definitely more
general 2022-09-11 12:34:50 pc2 is gonna be like the lego version of besiege
general 2022-09-11 12:35:13 i know
general 2022-09-11 12:35:37 i hopee there are interactive fires in pc2
general 2022-09-11 12:35:40 like if an engine gets shot
general 2022-09-11 12:36:09 it also combusted for 0 reason
general 2022-09-11 12:36:16 well
general 2022-09-11 12:36:18 not 0 reason
general 2022-09-11 12:36:29 the reason it exploded is unexplained
general 2022-09-11 12:36:47 working vacuum of space in pc2 when
general 2022-09-11 12:37:59 bruh what
general 2022-09-11 12:38:05 i said nothing
general 2022-09-11 12:38:08 bad
general 2022-09-11 12:38:59 i hope the engines in pc2 have the actual amount of thrust as they do in real life so you dont need to use like 40 thrusters

general 2022-09-11 12:41:10 ive noticed ever since top gun maverick released there was a sudden increase in sukhoi aircrafts and f-14 tomcats in pvp mode
general 2022-09-11 12:45:29 yeah, i've seen people making like su-34s and that genre of aircraft doing "cobras"
general 2022-09-11 12:45:33 but mainly su-57s
general 2022-09-11 12:47:33 yeah
general 2022-09-11 12:47:37 my friend has a darkstar
general 2022-09-11 12:47:45 he made 3 entire aircrafts about topgun: maverick
general 2022-09-11 12:47:47 he loves it
general 2022-09-11 12:47:50 which is very understandable
general 2022-09-11 12:48:07 i even made my f-14 based off the one maverick stole with rooster at the destroyed soviet base near the end of top gun
general 2022-09-11 12:49:01 yeah
general 2022-09-11 12:49:05 that view looks like a grey darkstar

plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:16:07 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:16:16 with the help of sketchfab anything is achievable
plane-crazy 2022-09-11 13:16:20 as long as you pay attention
