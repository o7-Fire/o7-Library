bug-reports 2020-12-31 16:46:41 Every time i turn on lights, 30 seconds later they shut off. is this a problem or am i just doing something wrong?
bug-reports 2020-12-31 16:49:06 it's because they just spawned in
bug-reports 2020-12-31 16:49:33 it does that so nobody spawn camps
bug-reports 2020-12-31 16:51:22 well think of it like this. if you cant destroy the enemy when they spawn, the enemy cant destroy you when you spawn

bug-reports 2022-05-30 16:47:42 why every time I spawn in, this happens?
general 2022-06-01 19:03:56 So I was building a huge building, and I painted it and did everything I could to it, and somebody spawns a lag machine and makes my game crash before I could save it. Now I have to join back in and remake the whole build.
general 2022-06-01 19:04:56 I never have autosave on since it's a piece of crap
general 2022-06-01 19:05:27 last time i had autosave, it saved something else in one of my best builds

creations-chat 2022-07-11 01:35:24 cant I post something like this, and since I'm done, it's a final project?
creations-chat 2022-07-11 01:38:14 this is effort at it's finest btw
creations-chat 2022-07-11 01:41:34 literally spent so long on this
creations-chat 2022-07-11 01:46:09 i have made some... decent stuff. sorry if it sounds bias
creations-chat 2022-07-11 01:48:11 god damn it why does everybody think i use tutorials

try to find that on youtube i dare you
creations-chat 2022-07-11 01:51:40 look at the intakes, the bottom, the wings, the landing gear, and the exposed motors and then tell me if it's the same
creations-chat 2022-07-11 01:54:00 excuse me?
creations-chat 2022-07-11 01:56:34 when you say alot, do you mean cockpit, and the fact that it's based off of the same god damn plane?

bro learn the meaning of a coincident please
creations-chat 2022-07-11 02:01:45 I don't understand why you people criticize so damn much, I mean give people a break, please.
creations-chat 2022-07-11 02:03:47 Is the f-22 tutorial motor locked?
creations-chat 2022-07-11 02:13:48 I use that cockpit and nose on every fighter jet I have, so for you to say it's a tut, it makes me frustrated. I swear to god I didn't mean for it to be the same as some random god damn tutorial. I guess I cant make one original design without it being someone else's, sORrY.

Also I don't care how long it takes me to say something. You guys are immature
creations-chat 2022-07-11 02:16:57 At least I have one somewhat original cockpit and nose, unless that was taken as well.
creations-chat 2022-07-11 02:20:05 oh you guys are so powerful and mature since you waste your life getting good on a Roblox game that doesn't matter whatsoever in the real world.
creations-chat 2022-07-11 02:22:39 like you know how to make a valid argument either
creations-chat 2022-07-11 02:26:34 this argument is going nowhere. I'm going to sleep. gn
creations-chat 2022-07-11 02:31:53 nvm I cant sleep.

I'm gonna join a vc, join to persuade your reasoning more, all though you probably wont, and if you do, I wont give a fuck
creations-chat 2022-07-11 02:44:55 what music do you listen to?
creations-chat 2022-07-11 02:46:56 <@808132273413160980> too bad I have the bot muted

creations-chat 2022-07-11 02:49:12 that explains a lot
creations-chat 2022-07-11 02:52:03 I honestly don't care if it looks like shit anymore
