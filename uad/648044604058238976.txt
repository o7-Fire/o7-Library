[Plane maneuvering key controls]
[Gameplay] 

My suggestion is to give players options to use the keyboard to maneuver the plane. If you considered to Implement the feature then here's the key bindings that you can use and I recommend from a game called "Kerbal Space Program".

W -	Pitch adjustment (down)
S	- Pitch adjustment (up)
A	 - Yaw adjustment (left)
D -	Yaw adjustment (right)
Q -	Roll adjustment (left)
E	- Roll adjustment (right)
Left-Shift	- Increase throttle
Left-Control	- Decrease throttle

The key controls I recommend from the game called "Kerbal Space Program". https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Key_bindings
