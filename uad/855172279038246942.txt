help 2023-06-13 01:36:41 I have attempted SU's and MIG's alike maybe like 40 times now, and unlike American aircrafts, I have NO idea how to get that weird fuselage angle along with the wings correct
help 2023-06-13 01:39:59 basically russian jets has an angled fuselage while its intake is straight, so i dont know if i should find a way to use an angled motor lock thing or try to use the materials already given
