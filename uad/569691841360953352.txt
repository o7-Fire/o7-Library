general 2020-10-12 04:51:30 how do you activate outlines on builds btw?
general 2020-10-12 04:51:41 oh.
general 2020-10-12 04:51:45 thats sad
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 04:56:51 oh youre a good builder?
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 04:56:56 name every block.
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:05:19 He RTBâ€™d to swap jumpsuits cause his current one had been compromised
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:40:41 Do you guys use the control surfaces manually or automatically (follows the pointer)
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:57:02 Do you guys suggest working suspensions for PVP tanks?
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:58:16 yeah but how do you reduce lag
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:58:56 Is 1150 good enough?
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 14:00:28 I have 4 motor 2â€™s with a block count of 1150
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 14:02:00 the motor that uses has the most blocks is the turret which i hollowed out
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 14:03:08 Epic plane
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 14:04:21 Last question:
Will i save block consumption if i use blocks beams

And are block beams bad for pvpd durability
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 14:05:58 yeah but how about tnt armor that negates bullets
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 03:37:03 how do i report people who intentionally lag a server?
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 03:37:11 
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 03:37:19 
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 02:55:05 Im gonna be a decent member of Plane Crazy society and make a roomba that cleans up after the mess in PVP
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 03:53:30 > <@!569691841360953352> what if cutters are on the ground
<@!347182144873037824>  thats why i have guns on the front as filters
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:37:01 did ladders just vanish
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:37:41 no the block model itself
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:37:47 probably my server
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:38:21 also I just learned how to motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 12:40:23 kv-2-2-2-2
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 22:47:28 context?
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 22:49:32 is that going to be tracked?

remember this MBT has wooden armor add-ons
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 15:00:07 if you switch to night mode and wait a few seconds for the shaders to kick in and swap back to day mode youll get a nice dawn - dusk effect

plane-crazy 2020-11-04 09:38:37 <@!383528513778745344> make the wheels 1.5 blocks wide using the half cylinders
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 09:38:54 it makes the block plates of the motor lock in the wheel
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 09:39:17 and theres more room for it to shift left and right so you wont unlink a track

help 2020-11-20 07:39:38 why
help 2020-11-20 07:41:44 im guessing you meant 'the conveyor tends to turn in one direction
help 2020-11-20 07:41:52 so will adding 2 cancel that effect?
