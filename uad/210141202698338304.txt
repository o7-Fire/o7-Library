plane-crazy 2019-06-14 19:36:59 aim for the sides
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 19:37:06 never aim at the mantlet of a gun
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 19:37:11 sides of a tank
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 19:37:28 you can probably pen the front with most guns
plane-crazy 2019-06-14 19:37:33 what nation do you plan on playing

creations-chat 2019-06-15 16:04:34 <@!340895447616978954> it's difficult to balance the functionality of a flying boat and also the looks of the E8N
creations-chat 2019-06-15 16:04:47 but yeah i'm not great at aesthetics
plane-crazy 2019-06-15 22:23:05 can you allow others to build on your base
plane-crazy 2019-06-15 22:26:58 you smell
plane-crazy 2019-06-15 22:27:26 i knew it when u said alt
plane-crazy 2019-06-15 22:27:32 such an old bloody joke
plane-crazy 2019-06-15 22:27:55 that's closing tabs u stupid head
plane-crazy 2019-06-15 22:28:18 your chromebook sucks
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:28:55 haha epic
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:29:00 just posted my catalina
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:29:01 big uwu
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:29:45 I'm aware it doesnt have the guns
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:29:47 it has the general shape
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:29:59 similar features too
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:30:01 same engine placement
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:30:03 same floats
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:30:26 you can't do the landing gear on a Catalina because they fold inwards rather than upwards like most aircraft
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:30:41 lol
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:30:47 i know the wheel placement is wrong
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:30:57 I'd like to see you get a landing gear to diagonally fold into the hull and still look nice
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:31:12 thank u
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:31:33 you can complain about the landing gear when you can make the mechanism itself >:V
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:31:55 yeah that's what my aircraft does it's not special
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:32:14 thank u
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:32:24 i wanted to go more for functionality than looks
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:32:39 so it could actually float on water, land on the ground, and look decent
creations-chat 2019-06-15 22:32:52 hence why it's a tilt-rotor
creations-chat 2019-06-16 11:35:30 Kyushu J7W Shinden. Had to add rudder as it could not be attached to the wings, and Tilt-engines to the front as it needed the lift.
creations-chat 2019-06-16 11:35:43 
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:09:00 <:PewPew:532303441293344778>
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:09:14 i dont think it's fair to say it "doesnt look anything like a J7W" :/
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:09:37 the game doesnt exactly allow for certain features of the shinden
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:18:34 I also want it to function though so
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:18:56 If I attach the wing rudders I have to have less wing which isnt good for actually being able to fly
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:19:17 because obviously i'd have to place a block for the rudders to attach to
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:19:27 I just said *if*
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:19:41 there's not enough control surfaces anyway because of the wing gear lol
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:20:02 man i wonder what the issue could possibly be
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:20:09 grgugrugruhgr
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:20:12 of course it posts in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:20:38 yeah but that makes the wing look bad
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:21:24 i was aiming more for general appearance and functionality
creations-chat 2019-06-16 12:21:44 instead of absolute similarity
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 12:48:59 mfw noone joins the ap server
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 12:49:20 Oh
plane-crazy 2019-06-16 12:49:21 I See

creations-chat 2019-06-17 18:00:07 obviously because i dont know how to or want to do folds lol
creations-chat 2019-06-17 18:00:26 this is true
creations-chat 2019-06-17 18:00:39 probably yea
creations-chat 2019-06-17 18:03:04 i see

plane-crazy 2019-06-17 18:25:00 even if u dont think it looks good
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 18:26:31 i mean that's just poor engineering <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 18:26:38 what kind of submarine *doesnt* fly smh
plane-crazy 2019-06-17 18:30:39 my plans have been hydrofoiled

creations-chat 2019-06-18 21:32:54 
creations-chat 2019-06-19 06:39:34 <@305378911938936833> what makes it look different from a 109
creations-chat 2019-06-19 06:43:46 elaborate
creations-chat 2019-06-19 07:29:46 what aircraft does it look closer to
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:37:14 Generic Utility Vehicle, (very) loosely based on the AEC. Drives and swims.
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:37:39 
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:54:38 >everything small looks shit
>no offense
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:56:05 can you do better, leg
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:56:26 <@!429665143677255681> madlad
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:57:19 <@!185171693566689280> most people make small aircraft that look like real ones because they're better to fly
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:57:23 noone likes having to make massive chunky boys
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:58:58 aren't control surfaces supposed to be on the wings
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:59:29 control surfaces are weak, that's why like 80% of the wing ends up control surface
creations-chat 2019-06-19 16:59:39 that's a fault of the game that causes the small aircraft to look "choppy"
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:00:51 obviously the faster you go the more air goes under them, but since i make small aircraft i dont want to have half of my aircraft as engines
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:01:19 <@!295568493166985218> probably almost 2k parts because of all the single-pieces in the fuselage and engine pods
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:01:46 there's not really a 'but still'
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:02:28 if you smack 20 rockets on it
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:02:29 apparently
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:04:28 tbf the game's physics isnt exactly amazing <@!295568493166985218>
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:05:08 No dont get me wrong, I really love the game
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:05:10 and I like making aircraft
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:05:18 but some slack should be cut in most cases
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:05:59 jet engines are decent depending on the aircraft you put them on
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:02 they're good for small aircraft
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:09 at least in my experience of making small aircraft
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:06:23 Rockets are too heavy, propellers aren't strong enough <@!295568493166985218>
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:07:59 noone challenged you to anything but if you want to man
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:06 james didnt you start this discussion with "small builds look choppy and bad"
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:25 nevermind that was leg
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:26 yea
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:44 nice ad hominem
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:09:49 redirecting the argument at a person rather than the actual topic
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:11:53 super rockets are heavy
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:12:43 tbf jets arent strong enough
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:12:55 the super jet can barely lift my 230~ part vtol
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:13:32 are you
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:13:43 sorry the "huge" jet engine is vague
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:13:52 pretty much the same meaning
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:14:00 yes
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:15:11 im sure you got the meaning
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:15:12 anyway
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:15:16 the huge jet engine isnt strong enough
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:15:45 huge jets are struggling to lift my 284 part vtol
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:16:08 wtf is a magnet drive
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:17:34 how big is it, decid
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:17:52 how big is it
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:18:36 yeah see the problem there is it's not to scale for a ho229
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:18:41 it looks great
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:18:44 and it probably flies great
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:18:49 but people like myself like to match the scale
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:19:43 ~~haha jameson is able to drive but still can't stop himself from askin someone's age on a discord for a digital lego game~~
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:19:53 yeah see it looks really nice
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:20:46 unfortunately james the discord terms of service also stop adults from asking the age of minors
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:21:03 it doesnt actually it just means you look like a pedo for askin
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:21:11 <@456226577798135808> your ho229 looks really nice :
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:22:30 i dont think you actually have a right to do that though bro
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:22:39 because that leads to sketchy situations
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:22:52 "i'm a moderator now tell me your age"
>"mr moderator i am (xyz age)
"kinky"
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:23:20 how do you prove you are above 13
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:23:49 a roblox registered age does not equal actual age
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:23:59 oh boy another ad hominem

creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:29:26 It's a unique mechanism though is it not
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:29:34 who's done it before

creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:29:51 where doth it be recorded 🔫
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:30:02 yeah but has it been done for *landing gear*
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:30:39 clearly
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:30:55 no my issue is that noones provided a source that is 2-point folding landing gear
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:31:33 but you have no source
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:32:03 but noone has done it for landing gear <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:32:28 but see kip
noone has provided a gif yet
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:33:10 but noone has provided a gif yet of someone doing the same
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:33:23 so it cannot be verified
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:33:50 that looks really buggy robo
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:34:33 but *my* mechanism isnt <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:35:00 but, farollo, noone has provided a gif proving such
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:35:14 ok orange what got *you* inventor
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:36:07 kip so far noone has provided a gif proving that i am not in fact the first to do this with landing gear
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:36:33 it was oriingally going to be for a catalina and then i was like "bruh what if i imade it a vtol"
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:36:59 my actual catalina had gear that folded up and was not in fact two-part
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:37:38 i *wish* it had suspension lmao
creations-chat 2019-06-19 17:37:42 can't fit it reliably though

creations-chat 2019-06-19 20:06:53 <@456226577798135808> adding more motors makes the aircraft look weird
creations-chat 2019-06-19 20:07:12 if there was a motor type that didnt have the annoying base then sure, i'd make a full engine, but just stacking motors looks bad
creations-chat 2019-06-19 20:07:39 yeah sure if you make like a 5x5 casing
creations-chat 2019-06-19 20:08:06 <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2019-06-19 20:08:09 that looks weird though
creations-chat 2019-06-19 20:08:22 and in terms of hitboxes, that's still 5x5
creations-chat 2019-06-19 20:08:30 it looks and works fine as is :/
creations-chat 2019-06-19 20:08:56 show me

creations-chat 2019-06-29 15:58:03 langley is easy
creations-chat 2019-06-29 15:58:30 british carriers best carriers
creations-chat 2019-06-29 15:59:08 shame they all sunk <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:00:38 japanese tacticians were deduced as crap since the pearl harbour strike left out carriers
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:01:28 me when yamato isnt used and midway dies epic style
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:01:37 even though yamato wasnt a good ship for the warfare in the pacific
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:02:11 bismarck rudder machine broke
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:03:08 basically everyone used torpedo bombers
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:03:19 germany's only decent naval idea was the fritz x
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:04:07 the KMS in KMS BIsmarck doesnt just stand for kriegsmarine <:lmfao:527971550360633393>
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:04:37 Graf Zeppelin more like never completed but i made it anyway lol
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:05:38 the problem wasnt even just oil
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:05:50 it was the rushed low-quality of it that never would've worked even if they did have the resources
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:06:35 I mean Italy probably could've done what it set out to do if it wasn't stupid
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:06:43 Japan's main goal was winning in China
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:07:29 Germany could never have won but maybe they would've had a better chance if they actually stopped the war to integrate and build their army out of more than just germans
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:07:49 and look back at previous battles and go "huh maybe we shouldn't try and make the maus"
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:09:34 hootler was an awful ruler
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:09:42 he was only a corporal in ww1 and had little to no experience
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:10:06 mussolini was worse because the people lost faith when he couldnt win in greece
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:10:34 couldnt win in africa either
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:10:52 hootler was wrong to invade russia from the start
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:11:08 especially once stalin's scorched earth kicked in
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:11:21 sure the russian oil would've helped a bunch but he could never have won
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:11:40 and yet by not waiting he died instantly
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:12:43 germany was in the perfect state for a mad dictator to sweep to power
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:12:56 if anything i'd say europe was lucky it was hootler and not another stalin
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:13:14 worst thing for europe would be the USSR and whatever Germany became yeeting into france
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:13:38 the soviets in the 1930's were so strategically weak they lost to finland
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:13:54 they lost to finland
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:13:58 sure finland signed the treaty
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:14:04 but the soviets were losing everything they sent in
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:14:38 i mean hey it worked
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:14:56 it's not that the soviets didnt care about the people
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:15:01 it's that the people didnt fear dying for the union
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:15:48 perhaps
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:16:03 i mean yeah
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:16:17 "hey let's kill these perfectly healthy people who could contribute to our army because we dont like their religion"
creations-chat 2019-06-29 16:16:19 way to go, hiitler
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 17:03:25 no
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 17:03:27 i'm playing neo
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:24:18 propeller engine design struggles
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:25:03 how do you do a 3x3 prop engine
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:25:04 i forget
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:26:30 yeah obviously but like
plane-crazy 2019-06-29 21:26:31 the shape
creations-chat 2019-06-30 17:17:15 that is a magnum carrier
creations-chat 2019-06-30 17:17:18 bigger than my graff
creations-chat 2019-07-01 09:46:02 I'd say fix the bow
creations-chat 2019-07-01 09:46:16 looks more like a bird than a u-boat
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 15:25:47 how do people get their ship turrets so flush with the body
plane-crazy 2019-07-01 15:26:07 feck
help 2019-07-01 16:43:44 not bad but not great either
creations-chat 2019-07-01 21:13:13 <@!468414621343023116> try looking at actual nuclear submarines to work out the shape and do a couple tries off that
creations-chat 2019-07-02 09:25:25 Box fold?
creations-chat 2019-07-02 16:05:23 CowCow I'll give you the same advice I did yesterday
creations-chat 2019-07-02 16:05:51 try looking at real submarines and their shape and try to emulate that
creations-chat 2019-07-02 16:06:37 and instead of downvoting him I think you should leave him unvoted and just give him advice
creations-chat 2019-07-02 16:06:51 I know noone ever gives me anything to work with when they downvote my carriers
creations-chat 2019-07-03 00:04:56 hi what happened to your gun
creations-chat 2019-07-03 00:05:15 and the tracks
creations-chat 2019-07-03 19:24:49 isnt the LCS-2 supposed to be a support ship
creations-chat 2019-07-03 19:25:07 ok apparently it's a "Littoral Combat Ship"
creations-chat 2019-07-03 19:25:35 no it's a "Littoral Combat Ship" with stealth in mind
creations-chat 2019-07-03 19:25:39 there are no 'Stealth Ships'
creations-chat 2019-07-03 19:26:35 you could argue that the Zumwalt is a Stealth Ship but it's a destroyer designed around stealth
creations-chat 2019-07-03 19:26:50 I mean it's got the basic shape down
creations-chat 2019-07-03 19:27:12 It doesn't 'peak' toward the bow enough and the bridge doesnt flow properly imo
creations-chat 2019-07-03 19:27:35 i know i struggle when making my carriers but
creations-chat 2019-07-03 19:27:50 there's probably a way
creations-chat 2019-07-03 19:28:03 plane crazy has more block options than space engineers tbh
creations-chat 2019-07-03 19:28:18 SE Doesnt exactly have 1x4 wedges or anything
creations-chat 2019-07-03 19:34:08 i dislike the colours
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 20:58:41 i really want to make a new carrier but i dont know what to base it off so i might just end up making one loosely based on the Graf again lol
creations-chat 2019-07-04 14:04:46 make the cockpit glass, coward
creations-chat 2019-07-04 15:38:53 what is the purpose of this
creations-chat 2019-07-04 15:49:19 what part is being locked here
creations-chat 2019-07-05 17:35:31 does that fill the baseplate
creations-chat 2019-07-05 17:39:58 p.good so far
creations-chat 2019-07-05 22:27:56 the yamato is magnum
creations-chat 2019-07-06 12:42:02 isnt it IJN rather than HIJMS

plane-crazy 2019-07-06 17:12:39 i cant see a use for htem
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 17:12:58 centred 0.5 blocks would be neat
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 17:13:24 what if i dont want to set up unused hotkeys just to have nice looking pillars
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 17:13:30 also disconnectors can only do 2 blocks before looking stupid
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 17:14:05 you get 2 centered pillars before they look stupid
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 17:14:10 as opposed to a dedicated 0.5 pillar
creations-chat 2019-07-06 17:41:01 you can barely see it

creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:24:59 you should offer something constructive anyway i dont want to have to ask people to tell me how i could do better and enhance my building
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:25:32 and sure it's not for helping you build but imo if you *really* think a vehicle is giga-shit then offer something constructive
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:25:50 they won't magically change by noone saying anything
creations-chat 2019-07-10 22:33:46 legend do you mean what *have* i posted

help 2019-07-13 20:51:37 the lift coming from the rear rotors is too strong so it pitches forward, i assume
help 2019-07-13 20:52:04 that or the thrust moving forward isn't properly centred, making it's forward thrust wrong
creations-chat 2019-07-13 22:20:56 it's definitely unique
creations-chat 2019-07-13 22:21:04 cockpit could be better but no complaints other than that from me
creations-chat 2019-07-13 22:21:06 very nice aircraft

creations-chat 2019-07-14 21:22:16 everyone makes zeros too so
help 2019-07-14 21:22:53 the railing is too tall to properly land a helicopter
creations-chat 2019-07-14 21:31:06 or it's just there's not a lot of easy ways to do an mi-26 and make it look different
creations-chat 2019-07-14 21:31:32 to that scale anyway
help 2019-07-15 18:48:04 bulge bows are to add extra weight to the keel
creations-chat 2019-07-15 19:48:23 wedges please
creations-chat 2019-07-16 14:47:55 odd design
creations-chat 2019-07-16 14:49:58 nice though
creations-chat 2019-07-16 18:02:06 the wings are inaccurate
creations-chat 2019-07-16 18:02:20 <@!272852191054790656> very cute carrier 10/10
creations-chat 2019-07-16 22:06:35 that's a decent roll
creations-chat 2019-07-17 12:32:19 Turrets could do with a remake
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:43:06 get a better turret shape
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:43:25 also the lower 'level' of the deck could use some work
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:43:38 and the bulge to account for the broadside turrets isnt present
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:43:59 The centre mast and rear tower are too chunky
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:44:11 the anchor releases at the front are inaccurate
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:44:38 try half wedges for the mast instead of blocks
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:44:41 it looks so chunky
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:44:52 it's also missing the railing
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:45:21 and for some reason the angling of the bow just sort of stops??? when the actual dreadnought continues to round off until the middle where it shapes into the stern
creations-chat 2019-07-17 18:45:41 another point is the lack of a Royal Navy flag made with trapdoors
creations-chat 2019-07-18 18:50:39 <@!285239279716663298> you did a bad job
creations-chat 2019-07-19 16:40:56 <@!451834969719832596> get a better paint scheme
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:13:03 bro i think you should look at your references more and incorporate functionality later
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:13:09 your wings are what, 3 blocks thick?
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:13:19 no wonder they barely fly
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:13:54 not make 3 block thick wings, clearly
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:14:11 it's not difficult to make a prop engine flow into the wing well
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:14:24 irl bomber engines are bigger than the wings they dont just slide in
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:14:47 for the 219 maybe but the 111's wings are quite clearly 3 blocks thick
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:14:49 yea
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:14:59 Irl heinkel engines are larger than the wing width
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:15:06 by a fair amount too
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:15:23 another issue i can see is the wings are too far forward by like
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:15:24 a block
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:15:49 fair
creations-chat 2019-07-19 22:16:21 tbh i think you just have to look at your reference images more and maybe plan ahead if you dont already
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 15:58:48 decid u sound like a loser rn
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 15:59:00 hello
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 15:59:14 yeah because that's what interests me the most
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 15:59:43 that and updates if they decide to appear any time soon
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 10:26:48 phantom forces is either actual hackers or kids saying you're a hacker
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 10:26:51 well
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 10:26:53 'hackers'
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 10:30:57 i mean it *kinda does*
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 10:31:08 depending on whether or not your turret has armour or not
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 10:31:09 but like
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 10:31:13 it's not a meaningful difference
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 10:31:25 i wish the mg's looked better to put on a vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-07-21 10:35:45 ✨ roblox ✨
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:35:52 to be fair his me262 is unpainted
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:36:07 and the rudder doesnt look quite right
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:36:13 i can understand why someone who's nitpicky might downvote
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:36:15 but i have upvoted
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:36:18 because 262 is cool
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:37:04 the only issue i can see is parts of the tail dont curve back like they do on the actual aircraft but obviously that can be difficult in plane crazy
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:37:36 that and you put propellers in the front of the engines but that's nitpicking at that point
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:37:51 I mean not just that but like
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:38:00 rounded edges for wing tips
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:38:06 and + and T shaped wing panels
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:38:19 because sometimes you just need a T or + joint
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:38:31 why not just put in an actual jet engine
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:38:39 propellers look kinda stupid in game tbh
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:39:05 propellers just look bad and dont do much overall
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:39:15 unless you're turning a small tank or using it for water propulsion
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:39:22 or maybe minor directional changes on helicopters
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:39:25 pretty limited use
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:40:02 Another nitpicky issue is that the engine doesnt blend into the wing like the actual aircraft but again
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:40:08 plane crazy can be annoying to blend with
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:40:32 >any military aircraft

creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:42:12 could i make my aircraft carrier fly and say it's a future military aircraft
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:42:26 has anyone actually made an effective flying carrier
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:43:30 Ultimately you could go for a sort of Akron system
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:43:34 with aircraft that drop down
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:43:38 rather than taking off from a runway
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:44:13 Kind of?
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:44:22 more like the US Navy Airship Akron
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:44:43 yea
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:50:55 try the P-61 Black Widow
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:50:58 that's got a decent shape
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:51:04 and plenty of features
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:51:37 or the A-6 Intruder
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:52:05 actually it had radar too
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:52:16 and the general shape is different
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:52:21 especially the nose and stuff
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:52:36 (also it isnt a shit aircraft)
(and had .50's in a roof turret)
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:53:17 Do17?
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:53:38 or a 335
creations-chat 2019-07-21 13:54:17 A do19 would be cool

creations-chat 2019-07-21 17:28:10 very nice
creations-chat 2019-07-23 01:12:35 It's kinda chunky but you'll get better bro
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:30:17 Is a sabot that difficult though
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:30:41 I feel like the hardest part would be making a decent firing mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:30:51 It's not like you can make an effective primer
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:31:04 That's not a sabot
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:31:16 Sabots are full casings
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:31:22 Not just a ring
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:31:32 They're like wacky pods
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:31:58 My question is: can it fire and does the detaching of the casing actually help like in real life
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:32:24 I don't want the math I know how a sabot works dingus
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:32:28 I meant ingame
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:32:56 I didn't ask you
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:33:14 I want to know if it works ingame and you don't have the answer for that
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:33:29 show, noc
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:33:55 and also yea is it faster than a normal round that doesnt have the casing
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:34:15 1k studs per second sounds unlikely what sort of firing mechanism are you using
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:35:17 Man I wish there was a high blast pressure no damage explosive to use as primer for a shell
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:35:41 It looks like a leopard 2 had a bad meeting with a Chisel
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:36:13 I didn't say the result was bad jusr a wacky encounter
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:36:34 Overall it's a nice design but I don't see a practical use for the plow at the front
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:37:05 It's not even camouflage bros
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:37:17 not meme camouflage at least
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:37:37 Yeah but it's not meme camo where you go "bro where are your legs haha"
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:39:53 Love me a dummy thicc Walker
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:40:13 Why so many motors
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:40:44 Wouldn't solid blocks make it more stable rather than extra motors
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 01:41:04 I can see at least 2 useless motors
creations-chat 2019-07-23 01:41:34 I don't know what kind of maus you've seen, but its definitely a chonk

plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:54:56 oh no not his industrial command ship
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:55:15 Your colours suck
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:55:35 Not purple and green
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:55:49 Try battleship grey
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:55:57 yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:56:00 it's effective
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:56:12 better than Purple and green
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:56:37 you seem aggressive
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:56:50 Relieve your stress with some normal colours
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:57:24 bro imagine not understanding colours and what's actually nice to look at
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:57:54 "unga bunga purple and green"
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:59:03 Probably upvoted the physicals rather than visuals
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 23:59:15 not that the bow is anything special kek
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:00:03 no I just want to make a somers because it looks cool headass
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:00:37 "unga bunga replicas are for lazy people" fuck you it's because the thing I'm replicating is cool and I want to walk around on it in a digital lego game
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:00:44 it's not that deep
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:01:29 super your best example of a ship is worse than the tiny yamato from the other day
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:01:42 replicas are hard to emulate for scale yeah
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:02:03 Super you are complaining that people enjoy things
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:02:46 juicy swept wing
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:02:59 super people can enjoy different things to you
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:03:11 it'd be boring if everyone did the same thing
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:03:30 hence people making replicas and people making fictional stuff
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:04:36 isn't a plane a flying machine

plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:08:50 Who are you to determine how much effort is put in
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:09:14 Who are you to determine "ooer these replica guys are so unoriginal arg"
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:09:52 Oh *im* doctor negativity
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:10:58 now you sound like a boomer reiiign
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:11:33 not even drama
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:11:41 drama implies it's worth anyone's time
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:12:29 Be the change you want to see headasses
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:12:44 rocket engine particles suck and they exert force on a creation
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:12:51 give smoke emitters
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:13:36 no they're just not good particles to look at
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 00:13:44 blue and orange aren't smoke colours

creations-chat 2019-08-28 13:37:32 and by the looks of things you used pontoons for the underside

creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:14:50 that would be epic
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:15:06 Although you'd need to be able to add and reduce weight
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:15:29 but succing and releasing water in and out of tanks isn't a thing :(
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:16:00 no because if the ballast is equal you just float
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:16:14 if the ballast is at the front then you get stuck in a dive
creations-chat 2019-09-04 02:23:52 suspension arguably isn't useful on a game called plane crazy so like

plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:04:43 bruh we got some missile engineering to do and then we're finished
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:06:03 submarine bridges are hard please no bulli :(
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:06:14 oh no
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:06:52 my missiles dont launch help
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:08:28 I dont need it to get out of the water
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:08:32 I need it to not get stuck in the silo
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:10:11 I have solved the problem
plane-crazy 2019-09-11 19:10:13 the problem was friction
help 2019-09-12 14:38:24 It means pressing the button rotates it by x degrees
help 2019-09-12 14:38:42 and locks it
help 2019-09-12 14:38:47 as opposed to standard motors
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:34:58 i made a thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 15:35:01 and it's pretty epic

creations-chat 2019-09-12 16:17:09 wacky carrier arrestor wire(?)
creations-chat 2019-09-12 16:31:21 more of a proof of concept than anything else tbh
creations-chat 2019-09-12 16:44:18 Just to clarify, it's not oversized, it's just that my plane is small
creations-chat 2019-09-12 17:18:56 ~~i wonder if it's inventor worthy~~
creations-chat 2019-09-12 17:19:05 I mean it's definitely useful
creations-chat 2019-09-12 17:19:42 The requirement just says a unique mechanism never seen before
creations-chat 2019-09-12 17:19:53 so unless someone else has done it
creations-chat 2019-09-12 17:20:01 Surely it is inventor worthy
creations-chat 2019-09-12 17:20:23 I'll believe it when I see it
creations-chat 2019-09-12 17:21:21 The rank requirement doesn't say it can't be simple
creations-chat 2019-09-12 17:21:39 a unique mechanism doesn't always have to be 300 part suspension or something
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:38:31 can a mod judge what I posted in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:38:38 <:WhatWasThat:525319504721608705>
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:39:33 wacky
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:40:32 that's just plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:41:06 fonkl do you judge for inventor
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:41:24 particularly articulate today huh
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:41:42 fonkl can you judge my creation
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:42:04 https://gyazo.com/154ab6a545e2919a8e7f9ef36b80c106
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:42:26 superidra said it mightve been done before but also didn't provide any images
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:42:31 So idk
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:42:43 show me
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:42:54 attempted u say
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:43:07 so if I have made it work am I still worthy
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:43:30 bro just do before: xyz in the creations channel
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:43:39 no scrolling needed
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:44:07 so there's no real way to tell if it even exists
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:44:25 there is but noones provided it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:44:28 thank u
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:45:02 yeah ropes smell and kinda suck at catching a plane
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:45:21 as opposed to chad doughnut
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:47:59 My rig should work as long as the pole is attached in some way
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:48:21 and the best part is that you could really put the pole anywhere imo
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:48:41 on the wing, on the nose, under the belly
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:48:47 as long as it can catch the ring
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:49:22 not really
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:50:24 a creation being able to function no matter where the catcher pole is would surely be a good point
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:50:59 surely the more universal and usable the creation is, the better
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:51:22 as opposed to say a suspension that only works within xyz parameters
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:51:35 if it's got a stick on it, the mechanism will work for it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 17:51:46 <@238017332872478720>
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:41:46 so when do I get inventor <:WhatWasThat:525319504721608705> <:WhatWasThat:525319504721608705>
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:42:16 you haven't even seen it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:42:29 just because its not another suspension system smh smh
creations-chat 2019-09-12 18:42:47 thank u
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:45:07 <@339519624968404993> when was it built before, by who, and can you show me
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:45:46 Surely the simplicity means its better
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:46:05 Ive created an apparently unique mechanism that isn't difficult to replicate for others
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:46:21 means it has more usability by others as opposed to 80 motor suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:46:31 which is ultimately the goal, surely
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:46:40 isn't an unmentioned requirement that it's useful
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:46:55 But it's unique
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:47:01 It's a unique useful mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:47:08 Noone has been able to prove otherwise
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:47:33 sorry I've made a decent and useful thing that doesn't need 200 parts to begin to function
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:47:46 the rank doesn't say it has to be overtly complex
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:48:10 Based on the requirements for the rank
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:48:17 It should be approved
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:48:26 bugger off it should be obvious
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:48:39 doubt but ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 18:58:16 bruh why the engines on the tail so high
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:00:15 oh also i looked up some arresting cables in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:00:44 the only actual arresting wire that apparently worked was a beam and ropes
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:00:53 no other hoop-and-pole mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:01:46 and the quirky suspension that gets people inventor is just motors and ropes
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:01:47 what's your point
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:02:08 these are the official requirements listed in <#609442446249820211>
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:02:12 nothing else is listed
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:02:23 nothing about "has to be complex"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:02:31 nothing about "no using few block types"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:02:48 I would hope that admins are reasonable in what they approve and do not approve
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:03:09 a sextant is a navigation instrument
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:03:39 You want me to make my submarine fly and catch the ring or something?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:05:31 <@!327499289595084800> so prove it can work on other aircraft?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:06:58 why are you so annoyed over it mrepic
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:07:21 Superidra it literally
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:07:23 
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:07:26 these are the only requirements listed
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:07:43 Noone has been able to provide proof for that though fonkl
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:07:51 no duh I won't accept defeat you guys haven't proven anything
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:08:13 "hur dur it just rope and ring" and???? the suspension that has gotten people inventor has just been motors and ropes
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:08:26 you can't act like i'm some sort of wacky annoyance here when you're not giving any points
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:09:05 but you've not proven that
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:09:23 that's a different mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:09:37 Find another mechanism that has used a ring and pole
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:09:40 then I'll bugger off
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:09:49 Sure they serve the same purpose
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:09:52 but so does every single suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:10:19 and i'm using a different style for my arrestor wire
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:10:24 you do not have a point to make here
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:11:06 I agree it is bullshit that I've fulfilled the rank requirements and I've got nothing for it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:11:14 I think MrEpic should get his inventor too
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:11:20 if he's made an actual navigation instrument
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:11:53 I get it's supposed to be a rare rank
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:12:04 but maybe dont pull bs out of your ass to avoid giving it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:12:10 "it's too simple reeee"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:12:32 It's not
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:12:36 that's not a valid point
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:12:48 again I will reiterate the official rank requirements
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:12:55 not my fault you've failed to mention other requirements
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:12:57 "hur dur too simple" my ass
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:13:04 NO IT HASNT
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:13:26 THE SAME PURPOSE WITH A DIFFERENT EXECUTION IS STILL UNIQUE
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:13:31 A PENCIL IS NOT A PEN THEY BOTH WRITE
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:13:48 And yet wacky suspension does
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:13:55 why not just use the game-given suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:13:56 hmmm i wonder
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:14:09 Maybe change the rank requirements for inventor then
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:14:17 instead of having a hissy fit over someone "not understanding"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:14:25 sucks for you then huh
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:15:10 that's not how the common sense rule works
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:16:30 It hasnt been made though but ok lmao
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:16:41 the same purpose with a different execution is still unique
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:16:46 you are the head and ass
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:17:35 >hm i am losing
>time to guess age???????
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:17:45 ok,
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:18:09 because you're unable to make a point
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:18:35 and yet you resort to "hm i question this person's age"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:19:06 I will reiterate  for the fourth ish time
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:19:15 same purpose with different execution is still unique
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:19:34 Can you prove that?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:19:53 If you can't prove your point then your point doesnt work does it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:19:58 why is this surprising to you yielding
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:20:10 wow that sure is convenient
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:20:47 wow epic very nicely done
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:20:56 still havent proved the same method hasnt been done before
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:21:15 You keep saying that
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:21:18 and noones been able to go
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:21:21 and get the evidence
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:21:34 it's always been wacky conveniences
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:21:40 "oh he deleted it"
"oh i'm not scrolling back to january"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:22:40 then take a step away from the pc for a bit
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:22:58 "hmm this person is annoying me
I know I'll stay in the same place"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:23:06 and you say *I* have no common sense
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:24:29 that's a long post for somethign you didnt have to get involved in
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:25:00 you are the reason you are annoyed
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:25:40 well you proved that one wrong
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:26:22 maybe if you took a couple minutes away from the computer you wouldn't be as annoyed????
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:26:34 just perhaps??????
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:26:49 no?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:27:36 Same purpose different execution is still unique
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:27:59 How many inventors have gotten inventor for suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:28:11 Yknow people keep saying it's been made before
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:28:16 and yet they've never been able to properly prove that
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:28:20 then prove it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:28:25 show me where someone has used the same method
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:28:52 Why would you want to make your mechanism more complex
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:29:03 that seems counterproductive given another unmentioned rule is that the invention is useful
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:29:35 I said with the same method
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:29:37 that is not the same method
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:29:48 And therefore you're wrong head and ass
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:30:01 I'll ask the question again
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:30:07 how many inventors have gotten inventor for suspension
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:30:32 Yup
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:30:40 same purpose different method lilundr
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:31:10 there's a k in there
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:31:18 no i'm not fuckin xoot
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:31:31 who the hell is xoot
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:32:12 yielding do you possess the ability to not be passive aggressive
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:32:26 And yet it fulfills all 1 requirement of inventor
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:32:42 because I want my wacky pixels on a screen they make me feel good
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:32:48 lilundr we went over this
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:33:19 So inventor can no longer be gotten then?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:33:33 yielding you're not staff
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:33:59 I'm relatively active
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:34:34 that's a threat you probably shouldnt make
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:35:03 that's the nicest thing someone's said all day thanks lilundr
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:36:05 so far noones really been able to give a valid point as to why I shouldnt get my epic pixels on a screen
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:36:20 Well no
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:36:35 You've all made the same points and I've kept having to repeat myself
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:36:47 apparently 2 people have gotten inventor for suspension which, serves the same purpose and use different execution
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:37:15 MrEpic I literally think you should get inventor for your actual navigation instrument
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:37:24 this isn't a difficult problem
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:37:43 I'm not trying to make you feel guilty
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:37:48 I'm trying to help you understand
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:37:59 And?
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:38:05 all the suspension is just motors and blocks and ropes
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:38:10 everything can be downgraded to basics
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:38:26 I have yet to see that yielding
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:38:44 I have yet to see another ring/hoop mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:39:05 That makes it into a clique
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:39:12 "no we wont let you into the inventor group you're not one of us"
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:39:15 that's just dumb
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:39:32 way to start a popularity contest
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:40:02 if determining inventor rank was restricted to a vote amongst just the inventors it becomes a "we're special you're not" clique
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:40:22 Maybe you should fix that
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:40:41 what is vip general
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:41:19 quirky
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:41:51 the godhood pyramid
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:41:59 establish communism
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:42:02 all created equal
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:42:03 uraaaa
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:43:23 whats pccgcs
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:43:35 Ok but actually
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:43:38 what's it supposed to be
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:43:39 *supposed* to be
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:43:55 without insulting the server
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:43:56 what is it
plane-crazy 2019-09-12 19:44:18 replication is good

plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:37:25 Ok great but some people don't like the annoyance of taking off
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:37:38 Especially with aircraft that can't take off until the end of the baseplate
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:37:46 It's a quality of life thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:38:37 Sure it spawns you in the air but you still then have to not fall out of the sky
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:39:12 It'd be especially nice for testing gliders and stuff that attach to other people's plane
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:39:18 Or airdropping a ship
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:39:44 its a common problem for my aircraft where I can't fit landing gear in without making the plane look disgusting
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:40:10 But it shouldn't be harder
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:40:38 its not removing the ability to keep it "difficult"
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:40:52 It's not removing difficulty it's adding convenience
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 23:41:00 The plane still has to fly

plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:33:37 yes we know what jericho trumpets are put onto
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:33:49 literally just speed-sensitive whistles tbh
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:33:54 that have an adjustable pitch
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:33:56 i've suggested this before
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:34:30 whistles good
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:34:35 jericho trumpets bad
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:34:45 whistles can be used for trains *and* planes
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:34:51 no they're not
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:35:03 Jericho Trumpets are turbines designed to spin in a way that they produce the sound of the Jericho Trumpet
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:35:07 a whistle is a whistle
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:35:18 "turbine"

plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:35:30 we know what jericho trumpets are
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:36:00 the whistle suggestion i made would have an adjustable pitch and volume would be dependent on speed
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:36:09 so if you go really fast you make a cool noise
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:36:13 no, a whistle

plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:36:44 JT's don't work on *any* plane
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:36:54 my suggested whistles could be used on planes
plane-crazy 2019-10-07 20:37:09 so do trains

plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:05:51 consider the following:
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:05:59 mechanical impact fuse
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:06:20 somehow a suspension presses against target, and also presses against the explosive and guarantees detonation
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:06:29 alternatively just dont use impact fuses,,
plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:42:21 I did it

plane-crazy 2019-11-05 17:46:41 suspension compresses and detonates the explosive rather than shitty explosive impact fuses

help 2019-11-07 00:46:35 So therefore 32sps is 3m/s

plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:04:38 float planes and skiffs, exclusively
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:05:12 I feel like a good thing about the current PC map is that it's pretty open to what you can shove in it
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:05:25 IT's cramped, but most things fit into it
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:05:46 like a grey baseplate with a large ocean area that has nothing in it?
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:05:49 that could be cool
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:06:04 It'd be especially good for like
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:06:08 massive land vehicles
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:06:12 that can't get up and over the hills
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:06:21 especially since you can't spawn in the desert
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:06:59 and yea the grey area in the ocean is such a stain
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:07:17 hence why i prefer henk's design
plane-crazy 2019-11-07 19:07:25 it's an expansion rather than a remake or a completely new map

plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:44:03 Germany won the air war over France but did not necessarily win on the ground
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:44:26 Bombers existed lmao  <@322970944303923200>
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:44:53 Bomber aircraft like zeppelins existed and at least did something
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:45:31 The Germans cancelled the zeppelins because they were ineffective but they were aircraft that bombed
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:45:55 Wait who the fuck said tanks are obsolete 🔫
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:46:20 Depends on what the aircraft is using
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:46:33 Also yeah tanks aren't meant to fight aircraft wtf
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:46:59 Tanks fight other tanks and also infantry
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:47:30 ManPADS deals with aircraft around a tank lmao
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:47:38 tanks don't have to fight aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:48:06 You need 1 tank to support infantry and destroy other tanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:48:32 Sure if the tanks fucking alone and not at range
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:48:54 Any decent tank can either escape or has infantry support wtf
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:49:02 <@322970944303923200> do you have room temperature iq
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:49:42 What the fuck no MG's, especially modern ones, are especially accurate and can easily suppress AND kill infantry
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:50:00 Guys I think dark is stupid
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:50:24 Tanks aren't meant to get within that range  <@322970944303923200>
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:50:50 Panzerfaust 3 works in buildings but doesn't work when there's a 120mm firing from several kilometres away on open ground
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:51:01 Tanks aren't meant to charge you tard
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:51:14 Tanks are to support infantry from range and kill other tanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:51:42 BECAUSE ANY DECENT TANK IS IN COVER, HAS SPAAG NEARBY, OR HAS MANPADS NEARBY
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:51:56 Also an airstrike implies the tank is spotted lmao
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:52:31 Aircraft are not the ultimate war-ending weapon get your head out of ww2
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:52:50 Get this dark right I know this is a crazy idea to you
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:52:56 COMBINED ARMS WARFARE
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:53:40 I'm focusing on majors vs majors and can tell you that any decent tank group has MANPADS nearby or SPAAG, or is hidden well enough to remove either one
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:54:20 Also what decent attack aircraft only goes for tanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:54:41 Dark do you know what ecm and flares are
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:54:51 Or yknow helicopters also using range to their advantage
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:55:15 What the fuck
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:55:26 Artillery isn't built for killing tanks
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:56:23 Artillery is used to stun or disorient an opposition and for softening up targets for a ground push
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:57:05 MBT's exist because it's too expensive to also have TD's when ATGM exists
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:57:48 Those aren't comparable you retard they serve different purposes
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:58:12 Tanks aren't the future they're the present and presently they work and will continue to work better than aircraft in ground-only infantry support
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:58:32 ARTILLERY DOES NOT KILL TANKS
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:58:42 HOLY ***SHIT***
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:58:55 open topped tanks are hardly tanks lmao
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 17:59:10 Thank you battleship
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:00:47 Planes can't defend a nation you tard
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:01:15 Planes didn't win Vietnam
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:01:25 Planes didn't win Vietnam <@322970944303923200>
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:01:39 Vietnam wasn't won by the US what
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:02:31 Planes also didn't win the Falklands, the Royal Navy did with the ASSISTANCE or aircraft in a SUPPORTING ROLE
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:03:01 Tanks will continue as long as ground warfare continues
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:03:26 You need an armoured support unit to help infantry on the ground either way
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:04:03 Tanks helped win ww2 more than attack aircraft did  <@322970944303923200>
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:04:30 And in the future tanks, or another armoured substitute, will continue in their role
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:05:14 I'm pretty sure lindybeige has literally said before that attack aircraft did surprisingly little against tanks in ww2
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:05:19 As did Nicholas Moran
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:05:30 And Nicholas Moran was an Abrams driver
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:06:15 Let's move on since dark is stuck in ww2
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:06:24 <@191446848999915520> what did you ping me for earlier
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:06:50 No before that

plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:30:52 Basically

Impact explosive
Suspension
Half block
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:31:09 Suspension has to have a low enough stiffness for the half block to basically compress into the explosive and detonate
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:31:24 Tnt is on same everything but like 40 impact speed for basic testing
plane-crazy 2019-11-13 18:31:35 I told this to mocmish but the concept might need tweaking

plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:44:20 Designer tanks or tanks with actual armour
plane-crazy 2019-11-25 23:44:54 it's mutually exclusive in pc usually

plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:09:39 as are the lack of armour values and actual cannons for ships, tanks, etc rather than having to spam rockets
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:09:59 it's cringe and horrible

plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:10:30 I want to sink let me sink reee
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:10:43 Consider:
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:11:07 A block that has a sink value that is only activated when touching water
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:11:36 When sinking is activated it will increase in density slowly up to 50
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:11:55 Therefore the more water is in contact with sink blocks, the more you sink
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:12:18 water propellers suck I hate them
plane-crazy 2019-11-26 00:12:25 So do huge jets

creations-chat 2019-12-03 22:31:54 the 110 would be better off with mg's inside the aircraft and fake mg's on the nose
creations-chat 2019-12-03 22:32:15 <@!257194741815312384> why is your torp design just your anti-ship missile with a prop
creations-chat 2019-12-03 22:46:00 <@456226577798135808> that and the fuselage

plane-crazy 2019-12-04 16:51:37 Kek
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:22:47 >people suggesting torpedoes

plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:23:26 Diy torps are literally stronger
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:24:02 Basically it's better to make DIY weapons rather than stock
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:24:43 Yeah but that doesn't mean it'll be more powerful or controllable
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 17:25:01 I think you're just laggy

plane-crazy 2019-12-04 18:28:31 https://gyazo.com/42911e15237ff827208aa250d72349a4
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 18:30:37 It's not got a great spread but ultimately if a mouse-guided missile is on it's approach it's probably not moving evasively
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 18:30:50 It's length also doesnt give amazing coverage across a vessel
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 18:32:00 I can join you on vip2
plane-crazy 2019-12-04 18:35:22 someone with mouse-guided missiles join me on vip 2

creations-chat 2019-12-05 00:51:27 It's cute
creations-chat 2019-12-05 00:52:00 I recommend using half blocks where your discommectors are and putting the discommectors under those if you want the wing smoother
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:52:43 Not everyone wants that much speed
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:53:06 Magnet drives are at least a lil controllable
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:33:34 The confederate flag represents the southern states that seceded from the American Union as a result of disagreements over slavery and ultimately, failure of consistency from the North to keep the Slave South/Slave-free North State Rule as the US government had started giving states *the option* of having slavery or not having slavery.
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:33:54 <@429131077035229184> learn *your* history you ignorant dunce
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:34:04 States rights to do what exactly  <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:34:54 It boils down to disagreements over slavery especially in giving new states the choice of slavery or not.
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:35:16 Because the confederate flag represents the defence of slavery lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:35:51 sure, among other policies, but the Confederate flag represents the *defence* of slavery
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:36:13 because the South absolutely did not want to give up slavery as most of their industry and agriculture depended on it
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:36:33 Seriously playing dumb and acting like the confederate flag is just like any other flag is stupid
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:38:07 Am I wrong?
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:38:39 Ultimately the confederate flag represents the defence of slavery and southern policies, the majority being immoral <:thconking:535171057649188865>
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:39:04 I never said they were hunter

plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:41:04 You can't pass off the PRC, confederate, or natzee flag as "just any flag"

plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:44:13 It was about the confederate flag and then it was tank decided "Vietnam, Korea, and Japan, deserved the warcrimes against them"
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 02:44:16 So

plane-crazy 2019-12-08 21:05:06 Irl the rear landing gear also went into the body
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 21:05:13 but I need rocket space
creations-chat 2019-12-08 21:09:07 the larger one has no tail and is cringe
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 22:05:32 Anyone have any good wing iron crosses?
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 22:11:30 found one
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 00:21:29 Ruski do you still have skis on that thing
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 00:21:41 nice
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 00:22:15 Moon *what*
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 00:33:51 I was gonna have a fit if that was a carrier deck
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 00:44:09 would be better if the barrel wasn't 3 rockets
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:24:51 "Its for testing"
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:25:00 You made a doom satellite what
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:25:14 pvp is underdeveloped but not a secondary part of the game
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:26:10 Ive made good looking pvp capable vehicles what
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:27:35 Occupies space though
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:27:55 Not on an aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:28:21 I've wanted to make an explosive ball cannon but I haven't been able to because of the space it occupies
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:28:29 Especially an aircraft of a practical size
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:29:06 Not even reload ability just generally fitting a magazine or reload machinery is a chore
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:29:36 like I made a explosive ball flak gun and wanted to add a reload magazine and it just fuckin cringed everywhere
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:29:41 <@414778672847781888> what
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:30:02 Guns suck against aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:30:17 Said as someone with an interceptor with 7 guns on the interior
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:30:34 Guns bug out and client-side freeze parts they cut off
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:30:46 <@414778672847781888> depends on scale
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:31:20 7achyon diy cannons occupy a dumb amount of space for what they do
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:31:53 The best DiY naval weapon is torpedoes
creations-chat 2019-12-09 01:32:56 My suggestion for pvp overhaul got 40+ upvotes
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:33:32 I might do IJN Tone

plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:57:52 "homosexual above homosexual below" or as vixo would like to call it, a Wednesday night for him
creations-chat 2019-12-09 02:02:38 Id show you but discord search is down for me
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:44:23 The roads on our map sucked though
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:44:44 And the airports are stinky
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:45:49 Our roads are stinky
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:46:12 A  city where the method of making it is stolen from attrition is kinda cringe
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:46:28 Henk the concept was better than the execution for our one
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:47:07 The city in our map is basically attrition's city
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:51:40 I had to deepen that canal lmao
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:52:04 My cb90 will absolutely get through there and it's a bit wide
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:52:10 same with my submarine
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:52:30 If you saw a person next to it then you'd get it ™
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:52:46 If you've got a mast why are you going through it
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 16:56:29 Henk's map concept was better than what we put together
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:00:48 It'll take barely longer to travel
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:01:01 it's a large expansion but not yuge
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:07:29 I voted wolf because self-upvote is cringe
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:08:03 Henk's map was a good concept but badly executed by us tbh
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:08:25 Vietnam wasnt particularly top notch to begin with moc
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:08:29 America ruined Vietnam
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:08:53 No, America ruined Vietnam
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:09:20 America intervened in affairs that weren't it's own and suffered for it, causing the Vietnamese service
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:09:43 Vietnam isn't Japan you dumbass
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:10:04 The Tonkin incident was due to American intervention in the first place
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:10:17 Fuckin "let's sail near Vietnam with a warship"
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:10:43 The only soldiers who deserved a thanking for their service was those caught by the draft
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:11:36 No General, Major, Officer, or acting President during Vietnam who didn't pull America out should be shunned
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:11:46 America shouldn't have even been in the region hank
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:12:13 Unless he was caught by the draft then he deserved it
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:12:42 Vietnam was a mistake by America who was high off the freedom train from Korea
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 17:13:45 ^
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:28:13 Its especially good because the plots lead to the runway
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:28:18 means taxi craft would be useful
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:28:42 like i'd love to drag my ju388 around with a neutered Puma
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:28:47 but the plots dont connect
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:28:48 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:29:00 i dont get wanting void behind the plots either
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:29:02 it's just cringe
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:29:13 like
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:29:25 you dont have to teleport nearly as far to spawn in the ocean, rail, or airport
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:29:41 the railway is epic
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:35:51 seabee most of the stuff in our map was just
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:35:53 underdeveloped
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:36:08 the airports were someone's prefab, moc had to make the one in the city
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:36:12 the roads were unioned??? for some reason????
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:36:14 and badly coloured
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:36:15 and thin
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:36:17 and had no railing
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:36:53 ultimately our map was kinda rushed and bad
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:37:21 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:37:40 leon kicked me out without telling me halfway through so
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:37:48 and then i had to rejoin
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:38:44 wolf your map's too cluttered
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:39:00 there's just too much *stuff* and it's poorly organised
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:39:42 the larger parts of the water are blocked from larger ships by bridges, the airport looks wack, the terrain isn't arranged aesthetically
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:40:17 basically both maps aren't great tbh
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:40:30 henk's map concept is better than the execution
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:40:43 Henk had a good concpet but the team made it badly
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:40:52 both maps don't really give a sense of improvement over the current map
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:41:10 again, henk's concpet is better than what we produced
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:41:26 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:41:29 what no
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:41:35 not a community project
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:42:16 this was my, admittedly underdeveloped, concept when I was sitll in Team 2
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:42:28 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:43:13 no
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:43:35 speed is irrelevant if we all do things differently

plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:54:20 he could literally give us a hollow 1x3 cylinder with a black circle at one end and it would be better
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:55:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:55:47 It kinda goes against plane crazy commonplace to have it be a full cannon too
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:56:05 like again a tube would allow for more creative freedom
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:56:11 but he made it a cannon
plane-crazy 2019-12-12 16:56:17 just an actual cannon

plane-crazy 2019-12-13 00:38:29 Right but assuming you couldn't tell, you wouldn't assume that was a joke
plane-crazy 2019-12-13 00:38:53 Because normal people can't over text

plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:20:11 yeah i respect rick and what he's adding but more needs to be fixed than added
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:20:22 currently the game needs optimising and a few overhauls
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:20:52 (yes motors need fixing valo)
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:21:12 it breaks on especially large creations and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:21:44 rick is the cannon model gonna be changed at all
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:22:27 not a modern cannon just something with cannon physics
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:23:06 something like this
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:23:07 literally a tube
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:23:18 that fires shells that explode like a battleship shell or tank shell
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:23:22 a tube. ™️
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:23:36 no <@!238017332872478720> what
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:23:49 if it's just a barrel we can make it into whatever we want more easily
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:24:03 eh pirate cannon barrels will look goofy on tanks and things
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:24:20 i think just a 1x3 cylinder that fires explosive shells would be way better
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:24:29 vip cringe.
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:25:17 so much more could be done with just a 1x3 tube that fires explosive projectiles
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:25:31 then you could make it into gun-pods, tank barrels, battleship guns, etc
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:25:57 *and* make it into galleon guns
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:37:57 that looks like an ontos
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:44:39 finally i can make a Natter
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:46:00 I hope tapping once makes it fire once
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:46:02 i dont know why it wouldn
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:46:34 rocket pods fire 1 at a time battleship you massive nerd
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 18:46:53 then why'd you say "no rocket pod dont do that"

plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:37:00 Could you imagine?
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:37:42 I made a Royal Navy styled Monitor based on the one that helped shell Gold Beach on d-day
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:38:00 so naturally I went to my friends like "Hey what if we had a fleet"
plane-crazy 2020-01-03 04:38:08 And laurence the lazy bastard slapped a carrier deck on it

plane-crazy 2020-01-12 01:47:10 well, similar to it
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 01:47:30 didnt you say you were making a sub
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 01:47:47 that's,, still a ship
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 01:48:28 
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 01:48:40 
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 01:48:43 fair enough, over water
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 01:48:50 but even that depends on your usage of the word "over"
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 01:49:02 the same way an aircraft travels over land but a tank doesnt fly when it moves over land

creations-chat 2020-02-04 23:47:38 <@!426156778007429140> 
the colour is because it's a Halo 5 Hannibal variant Scorpion
The turret in-universe is an autoloader and doesnt need crew space
the hull is that close to the ground on the actual scorpion, in most models
creations-chat 2020-02-04 23:49:10 i admit the cockpit looks kinda bruh but in-game it has a canopy so

creations-chat 2020-02-25 19:18:07 I like the idea of engines being moved for roll rather than flaps
creations-chat 2020-02-25 19:18:42 sure but like if it were just engines and you double stacked the motors
creations-chat 2020-02-25 19:18:57 you could move without losing speed due to change in overall wing shape
creations-chat 2020-02-25 19:19:19 Instead it'd only be manoeuvring that'd cause speed loss
help 2020-02-26 03:26:35 that is server lag not computer lag
help 2020-02-26 03:27:16 it happens on older servers or servers with larger builds on it
help 2020-02-26 03:27:34 it also happens on particularly complex builds, so motors, wheels, moving jet engines, etc
creations-chat 2020-02-26 22:55:15 I can appreciate that it's to scale and plane crazy wings are thin, but that's so chunky

plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:55:12 Its about buoyancy my g
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:56:30 Air pocket = floats, which is part of the reason ships stay upright

Air pockets dont exist in plane crazy so your ship is always top heavy, hence making the centre and lowest point of the ship heavier than the top, which you are making lighter with helium
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:57:49 Everyone who's made a ship learned this one way or another it's not magic lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:58:20 Both take up too much space for my liking
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 03:59:22 I have no room below deck on my HMS Erebus because it's all taken up by pontoons 

You cant work them into the walls or deck like with helium or ballast
