creations-chat 2022-12-29 06:53:25 the exposed under the intake, one block wide, nose is too blocky, wings look like they are from namnam, doesnt look like you tried on the elevators, engines are so disoriented and goofy, intakes are too big, intakes plop down too much, you screwed up all the proportions, canopy is too big, more depth in the front of the wing, the camo is too pointy, and your also a furry. Build looks like crap redo the whole thing
