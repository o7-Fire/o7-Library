plane-crazy 2023-05-28 16:28:01 The canopy and spine is clean, maybe a little nose work, but the transition from spine to wings should be smoother

creations-chat 2023-05-30 19:41:54 Iâ€™ll be happy to help
general 2023-05-30 19:42:49 Damn
creations-chat 2023-05-30 20:32:09 Try making the flame near the afterburner purple and the rest to orange
creations-chat 2023-05-30 20:34:45 You could maybe just shorten the length of the purple then add longer orange trails in that empty motorlock space
creations-chat 2023-05-30 22:18:47 If ur talking abt the bomber I used 2x2 water propellers with round wedge outta cover the prop
plane-crazy 2023-05-30 23:01:58 when u open a ticket, make sure u have screenshots or videos of what they require, so ss of block count, ss of no helium used, etc.
