The Tale of miserman (371113735760248832)
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 22:30:21 yooo
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 22:30:31 whats the lightest material in game?
plane-crazy 2020-08-22 22:30:34 besides helium?
general 2020-08-22 22:34:18 no tank designer role?
general 2020-08-22 22:34:20 wowww
general 2020-08-22 22:36:15 nice
general 2020-08-22 22:36:22 I dont usually make visually good tanks
general 2020-08-22 22:36:28 most are for pvp
general 2020-08-22 22:36:46 
general 2020-08-22 22:36:51 this is the quality of my speedy tank
general 2020-08-22 22:37:23 they arent hideous :(
general 2020-08-22 22:37:26 they are practical
general 2020-08-22 22:37:31 or at least thats what I tell myself
general 2020-08-22 22:38:05 SPG on truck
general 2020-08-22 22:38:22 also an excellent "gorgeous tank"
general 2020-08-22 22:39:03 it was my first and only attempt at putting a tnt launcher on a elevating and depressing gun
general 2020-08-22 22:39:33 no
general 2020-08-22 22:39:37 thats what the fuel blocks
general 2020-08-22 22:39:41 on the bottom are for
general 2020-08-22 22:39:51 also there are ballast blocks that are hidden from the screenshot
general 2020-08-22 22:40:04 I used both
general 2020-08-22 22:40:23 The ballast is a permanent part of the hull design I use
general 2020-08-22 22:40:32 the fuel was an add on for that version only
general 2020-08-22 22:41:29 arcade or realistic
general 2020-08-22 22:41:37 Soviet tanks early tier are superior
general 2020-08-22 22:41:41 to everything else
general 2020-08-22 22:41:48 because they have actually good APHE
general 2020-08-22 22:42:07 not if you angle
general 2020-08-22 22:42:21 angling solves all problems from AA
general 2020-08-22 22:42:36 a 60 degree angle should deflect most shots
general 2020-08-22 22:42:41 especially from an AA vehicle
general 2020-08-22 22:42:54 probably hit the strangest weakspot ever
general 2020-08-22 22:43:23 Turret ringing on early light tanks is hard
general 2020-08-22 22:43:31 the turret ring isnt as pronounced
general 2020-08-22 22:43:41 well Soviet tanks they are a lot more pronounced but not AS pronounced
general 2020-08-22 22:44:15 If they angle you will have to
general 2020-08-22 22:44:54 what tank are we talking about
general 2020-08-22 22:45:06 like specifically
general 2020-08-22 22:45:13 That doesent apply for everything
general 2020-08-22 22:45:27 angling the bt7 is gonna deflect significantly more than a stuart
general 2020-08-22 22:46:04 yeah but its slow
general 2020-08-22 22:46:17 and thats not thickness
general 2020-08-22 22:46:19 its angles
general 2020-08-22 22:46:36 the first HEAT shells turn the french boys into nothingness
general 2020-08-22 22:47:12 against a flak panzer?
general 2020-08-22 22:47:30 Opening up protection analysis
general 2020-08-22 22:47:33 I gotta check this out
general 2020-08-22 22:47:49 maybe if you use HVAP but theres no way plain rounds go through an angled bt7
general 2020-08-22 22:49:25 bruh
general 2020-08-22 22:49:29 im in PA right now
general 2020-08-22 22:49:39 a 38 degree angle stops the best penetrating flak panzer shell
general 2020-08-22 22:49:50 at least frontally
general 2020-08-22 22:51:16 thats not how it works
general 2020-08-22 22:51:24 well actually
general 2020-08-22 22:51:29 maybe for early tanks that is how it works
general 2020-08-22 22:51:34 but later on thats impossible
general 2020-08-22 22:52:01 I do the same thing
general 2020-08-22 22:52:07 Jumbo is great
general 2020-08-22 22:52:19 3,700 more rp and I have the 76 jumbo
general 2020-08-22 22:52:27 it doesent have APHE but you dont really need it
general 2020-08-22 22:53:21 Italian tanks are underrated
general 2020-08-22 22:53:23 mad underrated
general 2020-08-22 22:53:42 besides Italian tanks
general 2020-08-22 22:53:57 they have the best starting vehicle besides Soviet
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 04:17:21 What’s important in any pvp plane?
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 04:17:50 I dont want the annoying part
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 04:18:10 I have a plane with rotating wings and a motor engine allowing for pitch control
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 04:18:19 Its not for large pvp servers
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 04:18:24 Just 1v1ing my friend
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 04:18:35 We like to have dogfights and they are always interesting
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 04:18:48 But I dont know how to make a good airframe
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 04:19:08 And said plane is just proving I can put pitch control and rotating wings
general 2020-08-30 01:36:50 Any way I could get a phat invite link!
general 2020-08-30 01:36:51 ?*
general 2020-09-13 21:58:35 how does vertical turning work
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 22:07:40 how do you
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 22:07:43 turn vertically
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 22:07:46 as fast as possible
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 22:07:56 with control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 22:08:04 and perhaps magnets
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 14:32:13 Any idea
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 14:32:19 How to make a plane faster
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 14:32:57 What is that comprised of
plane-crazy 2020-09-15 14:33:30 Putting more engines on here isnt helping
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 22:48:03 How do custom propellers work?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 22:48:53 Like how do I make propeller blades actually work?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 22:54:28 Bruh how the heck do propeller blades work
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 22:54:34 And how do I make custom propellers
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 22:54:37 This is hella confusing
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:37:18 Tnt armor doesent work that well
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:37:26 Unless the dude your fighting in said tank is a brainlet
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:37:53 It does not counter tnt cannons at all and there are many ways to get a projectile through the armor
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:38:24 I have several tnt launcher designs on tnt armor
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:39:07 Tnt cannons are so easy to make
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:39:11 And impossible to counter
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:39:17 I even have one on one of my planes
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:39:26 It started off as a meme
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:39:32 But it quickly became very real
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:39:50 Its not that simple
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:39:55 You have to hit a specific area
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:40:04 Where the balls can come through
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:40:22 Additionally you can easily put tnt over the covering
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:40:34 The balls fall to the floor of the cannon you know that right?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:40:44 So you have to put a hole in the bottom of the cover
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:41:15 All a tnt cannon has to do is aim at you and you effectively get fucked
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:41:58 Why would a ground vehicle be 1k+?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:42:22 I am not currently talking about planes
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:42:29 Although I put one on my plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:42:33 As a mene
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:42:37 It semi works but your right
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:42:43 You cant hit anything fast
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:43:08 I mean maybe in a plane but I am purely talking tank vs tank right now
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:43:19 There are so many variables that go into it
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:43:44 I have 2 tnt cannon designs that I use even somewhat regularly
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:43:47 So whats your point?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:44:08 You have never even seen me play bruh
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:44:25 You have heard me speak of ONE thing
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:44:32 This is your first time ever speaking with me.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:44:51 Again I have TWO designs with this “meta” build.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:45:07 And the whole discussion we were having were about if its easy to counter said meta.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:45:31 And I said its not that simple because it really isnt
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:45:59 I have said like 3 times now that im talking about tank versus tank.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:46:18 I already said they suck against planes and that I tried to use one on a plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:46:29 Yes and enough balls makes your speed really not matter
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:46:54 Okay how about you fight me then?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:47:12 Friday afternoon on EST we can 1v1 since im so bad and your so good
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:47:29 I wont even use a tnt cannon
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:47:34 I will make a vehicle from scratch then
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:47:42 Will not use more than 5 rockets
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:48:10 No this dude just called me bad so he can test how bad I truly am.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:48:20 Im not really mad im gonna let him fight me and see how bad I am
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:48:25 Im proving a point
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:48:29 Then make a new account...
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:48:44 Thats why I said I would build from scratch
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:48:57 Okay I will also be building from scratch...
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:49:19 Yea okay
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:49:22 Thats what I thought
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:49:51 When you do get your main account I will be perfectly fine proving I am not bad.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:50:12 I dont use reddit
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:50:29 Reddit is kinda
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:50:47 I dont know how to explain it
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:51:09 Isnt that like
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:51:12 A pontoon deployer
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:51:26 Makeshift bridge*
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:53:35 How the fuck do custom propellers work
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:53:53 No like
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:54:00 With propeller blades
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:54:01 And motors
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:54:06 Its so confusing
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:55:08 I am not entirely familiar with stacking motors
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:55:23 I have an idea of what it can be used for but I personally have never done it myself
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:55:28 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:55:32 Is it that simple?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:56:32 So you would need at least 2 motors stacking to make a propeller with propeller blades?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:57:40 What are the benefits of using a custom propellers anyways?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:57:54 Uh I mean
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:58:02 Wont a conveyor engine do more than enough work?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:58:38 Ig
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:58:48 The only sad thing is I cant really put one on a jet
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:59:01 But I am making plenty of piston engines
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:00:12 I know a guy who makes a lot of planes
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:00:23 And he tells me faster than 1k is uncontrollable and I wanna know how true that is
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:00:45 I havent been able to try it on pc yet but I can go 4k on mobile and control just fine
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:01:47 Honestly I dont even use vertical turning on control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:02:12 I use the beauty of magnets and also horizontal turning
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:02:45 I mean on my gunship I am working on I have one vertical control surface
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:03:09 The rest are horizontal and it turns very quickly with the 10 turning magnets on either side
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:03:45 I like trying to make fighters but I am bad at making the airframes
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:03:50 Magnet drives?
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:03:56 I just use them to turn idk if thats the same thing
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:04:34 At turning? Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:04:51 You can turn in under 4 seconds at the drop of a dime
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:05:15 Otherwise I use a conveyor engine and plenty of jets and super rockets
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:05:56 I dont use magnets for anything besides turning
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:06:13 A conveyor engine for turning would be inefficient to say the least
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:06:34 Turning manually with a conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:07:19 I like turning with them because they are faster than control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:07:50 Yo actually?
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:07:54 Faster or
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:07:59 Just fast
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:08:08 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:08:20 Yeah I will work with it but for now I will probably stick with magnets
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:09:21 This is what were currently working with
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:09:41 That ball gear used to be an actual wheel with suspension(5x5) cylinder but the conveyor engine really did not work
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:09:45 With the suspension
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:10:09 How many blocks is that?
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:10:12 Like 409
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:10:28 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:11:10 Also the aerodynamics of the plane are fine, with the way the turning left to right works it kind if evens out not using a tail for vertical turning
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:11:23 Again I haven’t been able to test this on pc
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:11:32 So it could be an entirely different thing there
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:11:38 I can on Friday though
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:11:52 Oh yeah
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:11:57 I am shit at making airframes
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:12:56 I mean I think I grasp other aspects well
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:13:01 But I really cannot make a good airframe
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:16:43 You cant tell much from this
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:16:55 
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:16:57 But it flies somethin like what you see there
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:17:00 At least on mobile
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:17:10 Again I cant really try pc until Friday
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:17:35 Also keep in mind even if I lose those jets
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:17:43 I have like 12 super rockets inside of the actual plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:18:16 I havent really done pvp but I think this thing could do well
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:18:42 It definitely out turns most competition but idk about outspeeding and actually hitting an enemy plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:20:47 I actually dont have a set weaponry layout for it
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:20:55 Imma design one when I am at a computer
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:20:58 Mobile kind sucks
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:32:01 What is the most important thing in a dogfight?
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:32:16 Most dogfights people just fly far away from eachother and its barely even a dogfight
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 00:33:14 And they just keep coming back until one person gets a rocket hit finally
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 12:29:20 How do
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 12:29:23 I make a custom propeller
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 12:29:29 With propeller blades
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 12:29:39 That doesent just jerk the vehicle around randomly
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 03:05:49 How to turn with cylinder wheels?
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 03:05:57 When not using magnets
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 03:07:23 You just rotate the motor that rotates the wheel?
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 22:59:05 Any idea why this thing isnt flying?
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 22:59:17 
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:00:01 Uh ill try more thrust
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:00:10 Currently goes like 300-400 while on the plot area
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:00:41 It has 3 right now
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:00:51 I meant to get rid of 2 actually
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:01:07 Its on center but it kind of looks weird
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:01:22 Those 2 things next to are super rockets
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:01:51 Any good tail design?
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:02:03 I want a lot of vertical turn
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:02:35 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:02:56 Do they HAVE to be smack dab ontop of eachother?
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:03:32 Sorta new to aircraft, I can make a good plane but the airframe and wing design still really confuse me sometimes
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:05:17 Way better at piston engines ngl
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:05:24 But I cant make either all that superbly
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:07:18 Any way to slant center of weight
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:07:24 Besides just placing blocks
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:07:39 Fuel blocks and ballast I heard but im pretty sure they just weight the thing down to much
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 23:08:34 Should I shrink those?
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 18:33:36 How does rocket reloading work?
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 18:34:26 Sometimes rockets take a while to reload other times its near instantaneous
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 18:34:33 Is it just random?
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 18:35:17 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 18:35:24 So on air planes how does it work?
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 18:35:27 If they dont hit the ground
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:16:55 What are some good torp designs anyways
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:17:00 I know of the plane made of tnt
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:17:20 Are there any better, more realistic ones?
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:17:57 I mean like
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:18:02 It acts like a torpedo would irl
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:19:27 I think I know what that means and does
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:19:34 It it when it bobs up and down?
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:20:01 Yeah how do I balance it? I have like a 3 block long torpedo that dolphins
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:20:13 Its just a tnt block with an engine on the back
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:20:36 Can you like
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:20:42 Put a conveyor engine on a torpedo
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:20:48 Sounds awful but uh
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:20:58 I kind of wanna try it
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:24:38 How di I make the torpedo not face upwards as a result
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:24:39 Of the
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:24:41 Ballast
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:25:11 Front
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:25:54 Its 4 blocks long and the 4th block is the ballast
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:26:00 Theres also a single water Propeller
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:26:09 Rest is tnt
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:27:10 
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:27:44 Lengthen it?
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:29:00 So I should increase it to 5 blocks?
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:29:10 This is purely a test for something I might put on a midget sub
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:29:22 Oh
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:29:35 Am I doing something wrong then?
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:29:40 Ballast is default
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:32:09 Now it just sinks but im assuming I balance that out with helium?
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 05:33:55 Same thing except it tips backwards except partially sunken
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 14:34:30 whats the best way to fight another  plane?
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 14:34:49 I have a moderately  controlling plane that can turn very quickly
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 14:34:56 but I cant seem to hit anything
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:28:21 any dogfighting tips?
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:28:29 I cant hit enemy planes worth a damn
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:28:38 also why do people not use guns?
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:29:57 oh
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:30:14 do you also not put turrets on your planes?
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:30:27 
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:30:29 this is my plane currently
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:30:41 but cant hit anything
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:30:41 pretty maneuverable
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:34:03 really doe
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:34:06 I just gotta learn how to aim
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:34:12 any tips for that
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:34:17 no
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:34:27 its pretty stable
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:34:33 even with the conveyor engine on
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:35:21 ok
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:45:27 whats a good way to shift center of mass?
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:45:50 I mean ofc
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:45:51 but like
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:45:54 faster
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 13:45:56 on a plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:01:01 bro
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:01:05 how to hit your  shots
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:01:08 against planes
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:01:13 hella difficult
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:01:31 oh
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:01:38 I can try leading
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:01:53 most of the time they land near the plane but dont lock on
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:03:54 what if the guy your fighting has a mega conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:04:26 dude im fighting uses flaps
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:04:28 same with me
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:04:35 so the turning thing isnt entirely easy
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:06:29 yes
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:06:43 he uses
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:06:47 motor2 flaps
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:06:52 and same as me
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:06:55 can turn almost instantly
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:07:07 its not like with normal panels where he has to lead in to turn
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:12:34 another problem is
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:12:37 even with ballast
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:12:44 the nose of my plane tilts up
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:12:57 and im unsure what the problem is and how to fix it
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:13:26 I added that cause its to nose heavy but overall it just makes it slower
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:13:35 
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:14:15 PVP rocket nose pog!?
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 18:24:50 any good tips for leading
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:26:03 yoooo
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:26:22 can I get your opinions on perhaps one of my best tanks if not my best
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:26:27 
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:26:32 looks like shit I know
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:26:42 performs well from what I have done
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:27:14 honestly I am gonna get rid of the cutters sooner or later
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:27:21 they serve no use whatsoever
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:27:36 I thought they boosted protection
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:27:57 Bruh I have no builds
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:28:09 I just literally have pvp orientated stuff
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:29:17 building big planes seems hella time consuming
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:29:55 for plane crazy yeah thats a bit of time
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:30:49 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:30:55 boats are the most simple thing to make
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:31:01 although a lot of them just rocket spam
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:31:14 (you dont have to do that though)
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:31:36 I use motor engines on mines
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:31:44 so making speedy boats is no issue
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:31:56 I wonder what a motor conveyor engine could be like
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:32:04 like rotating a conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:32:13 (I assume awful)
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:34:58 how do you hit a dude going 1k+
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:35:04 with a conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:35:11 kind of
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:35:19 curious what you guys would do
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:35:45 helium boats!?
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:35:52 thats a thing?
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:36:02 what does it consist of
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:36:32 is that a u2?
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:36:43 I mean
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:36:44 not u2
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:42:41 are missiles on planes

plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:43:03 like actual missiles
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:43:05 you'd like
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:43:09 mount to a wing or something

plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:45:48 real life guided missiles
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:45:50 on tanks
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:45:58 but im talkin about planes currently
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:51:25 BRUH
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:51:26 bruh*
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:51:34 this missile refuses to follow my mouse
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 02:52:03 
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:21:54 hey
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:22:00 how would you guys make an A-A missile?
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:22:10 I made one but it doesent follow my mouse whatsoever
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:22:19 uncontrollable the moment I fire it
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:22:40 
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:22:42 I used control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:22:50 tried to make flaps
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:22:54 didnt go good
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:23:09 I had two but flaps dont work well
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:23:12 on this
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:23:20 cause I cant manually control
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:24:18 thansk
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:24:20 thank you
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:24:21 so much

plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:24:33 yep
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:24:53 I dont use guyazo but I can record an mp4
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:24:56 if it will fit
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:26:04 dont think im allowed to post vids
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:26:05 also
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:26:11 its what most roblox players use
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:26:15 to make gifs and stuff
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 17:10:58 how do people generally turn using conveyors
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 17:24:22 can someone make this?
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 17:24:33 hold on
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 17:24:36 paste broken
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 17:25:19 
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 17:25:34 I would make it myself but I suck at building
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 17:25:46 I would really like to see it,its an aa gun on a panther hull
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 17:25:56 yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 12:50:07 making a m6a1
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 12:50:13 
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 12:50:14 what do you guys think so far
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 14:22:54 excuse me for being a noob
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 14:23:02 But what is hof?
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 14:23:19 Some kind of special role for exceptional builders or something?
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 14:23:33 Ohhh
plane-crazy 2020-10-08 13:50:30 Any good tips for pvp orientated jet builds?
plane-crazy 2020-10-08 13:50:35 I suck at making frames
plane-crazy 2020-10-08 13:50:52 But I think im fine with everything else
plane-crazy 2020-10-08 13:50:59 Airframes are hard for me
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 22:05:01 hey
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 22:05:10 how many rockets and guns are optimal on a plane?
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 22:05:14 Currently I use 3 and no guns
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 22:05:54 
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 22:06:05 this is my current plane, it looks awful but I just want a good dogfighter
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 04:19:01 Any tips on tank buildingv
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 04:19:02 ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 21:58:51 how to stop your rockets from doing that stupid thing
plane-crazy 2020-10-17 21:59:09 where they just fly,track onto a vehicle, and then just randomly fly off
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:15:10 So
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:15:16 What does motor locking do
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:15:18 Im still confused
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:15:52 So you can compress like, 12 super rocket engines into one block?
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:16:46 Pog
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:16:46 Pershing
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:17:15 No flaps
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:17:18 !?
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:17:33 Flying planes without flaps doesn’t feel right to me anymore
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:19:09 Thats not always true
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:19:13 Keep your plane under 500 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:19:17 Probably less
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:19:22 More*
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:19:35 And it wouldnt be laggy at all
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:20:02 Conveyor engines are really cool as well
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:20:06 Because
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:20:18 It basically speeds up time for your plane
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:20:23 Like you turn twice as fast
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:20:28 For example
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:21:44 How does motor locking work?
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 16:21:56 Like how do I actually compress the blocks?
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:44:40 Any tips on painting camo?
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:44:54 I have never been able to get my camo designs as good as people have made it
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:45:02 Like it always looks utter garbage
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:45:57 Well I understand that, I mean like the application of it
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 17:46:40 Just generally, I am working on an m4 right now that I can post when I an done
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 21:44:29 I

bug-reports 2020-10-28 17:08:28 So for some reason when I set my motor to lock... It just shrinks and its really confusing! This is an awful bug please fix it
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 17:13:53 What
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 17:13:59 Whatever
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 17:14:15 If I make an engine of mines that uses like
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 17:14:23 Piston- suspension drive
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 17:14:36 Would it actually be an efficient way to move around my vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 17:15:00 Base engines are good enough but im wondering if you can literally just make your own propulsion
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 17:16:32 That thing is sexy
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 17:16:46 Kind of curious though, how does it actually work?
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 17:17:04 Wait thats pretty self explanatory
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 17:18:42 Do you think its possible to design your own propulsion
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 17:18:45 That is
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 17:18:54 Small enough to fit on a plane?
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 17:19:29 Like his engine there
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 17:19:33 But smaller
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 17:19:44 And used for aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 19:42:51 Yo

plane-crazy 2020-10-31 22:48:42 and then finally hit the death zone
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 22:50:17 I do but flying in war thunder is a lot more limited
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 22:50:27 iin plane crazy, especially with flaps
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 22:50:31 its like
plane-crazy 2020-10-31 22:50:40 not limited

plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:54:25 and it turns into a situation where we just pivot around eachother

plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:54:40 I have speed superiority actually, but
