The Tale of onepatronimo (320294890644701184)
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 08:28:04 Yesss. A prop challenge right as I near completion of my C-130 that I‚Äôve spent like 2 weeks on...
creations-chat 2019-01-23 09:13:18 I need help with my C-130
creations-chat 2019-01-23 09:13:27 I can‚Äôt quite get enough power from the engines
creations-chat 2019-01-23 09:13:54 I‚Äôve got 2 motors spinning each prop (at max speed of course)
creations-chat 2019-01-23 09:14:21 And I would give it one more but with 2 the centrifugal force is pulling the props back to neutral
creations-chat 2019-01-23 09:19:23 I‚Äôve got motors so that you can turn the actual propellers themselves to give them more thrust or even feather them if needed but it means at high speeds they get pulled flat
creations-chat 2019-01-23 09:21:45 Ye
creations-chat 2019-01-23 09:23:00 But to make the motors more powerful I‚Äôve added more, and so the pitch keeps rolling back, I‚Äôm already at a point where I have to be constantly pulling them back just to maintain thrust
creations-chat 2019-01-23 09:24:14 I‚Äôm just going to assume that I was just a complete tit for not even seeing that
creations-chat 2019-01-23 09:25:18 Wouldn‚Äôt that mean that the motor stops working tho?
creations-chat 2019-01-23 09:26:31 Niice, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been missing
creations-chat 2019-01-23 09:26:35 Thanks so much

plane-crazy 2020-09-26 11:04:57 Clip taken from the video
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 11:05:36 It does simulate flight however
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 11:05:56 That‚Äôs not what they are tho
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 11:06:58 <@456226577798135808> I took the names from whoever uploaded it to the hall of fame channel, if that‚Äôs wrong then it would have been an error on my part
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 11:07:37 Ok guys I get it, I won‚Äôt make any more videos on Plane Crazy then
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 11:07:51 I didn‚Äôt realise it was taken so seriously
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 11:08:11 <@!299289130964090881> Yes, I said it was an error on my part

<@!320294890644701184>
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 11:08:56 1. Because you can‚Äôt edit videos once they‚Äôre uploaded
2. I only just found out
3. Im not even home rn
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 11:09:32 Because editing is complicated and it must have carried over
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 11:09:58 <@577604979909459989> Yeah that would have been the issue
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 11:10:44 <@577604979909459989> DM me
general 2020-12-08 01:16:50 Arg another DM advertiser from this server. Is it ok to ping a mod for it?
general 2021-03-26 00:51:34 Yo, I made a video on Plane Crazy, I assume I'm not allowed to post it in this server without the content creator role but I just wana make sure :) That correct?
general 2021-03-26 00:51:44 fair dos
general 2021-03-26 00:51:58 No expert roles :(
general 2021-03-26 00:52:17 Not good enough to have the expert role, phat f
general 2021-03-26 00:52:28 hi
general 2021-03-26 00:52:41 yes hi
general 2021-03-26 00:52:51 so whats needed for an expert role üëÄ
general 2021-03-26 00:53:13 i am the big brain
general 2021-03-26 00:54:40 Theres genuinely so many roles in there that I can't find it lmao
general 2021-03-26 00:55:58 its only block count that means anything for expert? So can't I just make a cube of cubes and just get it that way?
general 2021-03-26 00:56:33 Me not having a clue how to build literally anything > giant cube of cubes > expert
general 2021-03-26 00:57:46 Is it cheating if I ask my subs to upvote some of my builds to get an expert role lmao
general 2021-03-26 00:57:56 even if they're terrible
general 2021-10-25 16:47:20 Hi, am writing some stuff for youtube, is plane crazy 2 acc being worked on or is it just people memeing?
