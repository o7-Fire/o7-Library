plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:17:53 ok
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 13:18:21 now thats my kinda plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:48:38 a plane lock would also be good for aircraft carriers to move with em on them
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:51:23 either they know what their doing or they use a tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:51:50 tutorial is cringe
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:52:34 i use wasdqe+mouse cotroll
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:52:52 and occasionally rf
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:54:09 you lock them]
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:56:35 i tried making a trebuchet before, it was quite glitchy but somewhat worked
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:57:18 ohhhhh
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 15:58:49 magnet engines are faster
plane-crazy 2020-07-28 16:01:52 there talking about aircraft carrier catapults
plane-crazy 2020-08-27 01:02:40 dont you just hate people who lag the server, this guy just left right when we started to report em
plane-crazy 2020-08-27 01:04:44 for anyone curious, his username was haktech1

general 2020-08-27 02:39:16 what did you just call me
general 2020-10-16 01:17:26 that one guy who invented cutter bugs when he made the first one was prolly like

general 2020-10-16 01:19:57 bruh
general 2020-10-16 01:20:50 well i mean the us put tank cannons on a plane so anything is possible i guess
general 2020-10-16 01:22:45 its like an italian taco truck but with more aggressive sales tactics
general 2020-10-16 01:24:50 > <@!428703449182371842> you dare say ***TACO TRUCK*** on this italian streets?!?!?!

general 2020-10-16 01:28:49 well ya see historically it was a symbol of perserving slavery
general 2020-10-16 01:30:06 if its for a costume then youl prolly be fine unless some idiot beats you up anyway
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 08:44:33 some jerk with a lag machine
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 08:44:47 
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 08:45:36 i know there are more powerfull ones out there bit it was still annoying
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 08:45:45 *but
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 08:46:45 atleast boats usually look cool while doing it
general 2021-02-06 07:08:14 fellas ive just done hours  worth of work only to find out that the save button seems to be broken
general 2021-02-06 07:08:40 auto save isnt working either
general 2021-02-06 07:08:46 its a bruh moment
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 07:10:11 anyone know what to do if the save button is broken autosave isnt working and you have hours worth of work unsaved?
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 07:12:40 its straight up not even giving me the "are you sure you want to save" thing
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 07:13:41 its just doing nothing, i have a few screenshots
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 07:19:06 i decided to cut my losses and exit and join a new server, but luckily it seems that autosave did work, but just wasn't showing it so yay
general 2021-04-01 09:22:10 are gold blocks just for looks/clout or do they got a use?
general 2021-04-01 09:32:57 
general 2021-04-01 09:33:07 
bug-reports 2022-01-11 04:49:09 For some reason, propellors, rocket engines, ect are just not working, they just don't respond no matter what I do, they are still broken when I rejoin
bug-reports 2022-01-11 04:49:48 I've tried switching their hotkeys and everything, still not working
bug-reports 2022-01-11 04:51:04 It is
bug-reports 2022-01-11 04:51:22 I allwase got it on, and I just checked
bug-reports 2022-01-11 04:51:57 It may be a keyboard issue, or an internet issue, I did just get a VPN so it could be that
bug-reports 2022-01-11 07:24:41 I'm on inf fule
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 01:00:03 is anyone else haveing an issue with bombs rn? ill see the bomb hit the ground but explode in the air a bit behind me, i checked my ping but it wasnt too bad, is anyone else having this problem?
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 01:00:33 ive gone to different servers
plane-crazy 2022-08-03 01:00:56 it looks as if there blowing up at the place i dropped them from
creations-chat 2022-09-29 23:13:46 could i get some verbal feedback for my plane? im seein the downvotes which i expected but i wanna know whats actually wrong with it
creations-chat 2022-09-29 23:20:03 ah, thank you
creations-chat 2022-11-17 05:55:40 its the creations channel, its either gotta be funny or REALLY detailed to not get swamped with down arrows
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:56:55 my motor 2 is broken and in a really weird way some of them are fine, others will only work when im not moving, they will get stuck in one position if i try to use them while moving, using this as wasd control on my plane, jet worked fine yesterday, now all of my planes that use motor 2 are broken
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:57:56 roblox keeps massin stuff up
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:58:22 roblox broke my bomb sight for my bomber
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:58:38 yea
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:58:43 also weirdly enough
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:58:47 on that bomber
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:59:23 when i drop bombs, they explode when they hit the ground, but the actual explosion happens at the place i dropped them, not on the ground
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:59:53 so the bomb hits the ground but the explosion is in the place i was when i dropped it, way up in the air
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:00:26 no but like this is consistant, regardles of lag
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:00:36 it goes off exactly where i was
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:01:16 i tested it by anchoring myself mid air, dropped the bomb and when it hit the ground, i exploded mid air
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:02:02 it also only happens on one bomber, all my other ones are fine
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:02:09 explode where they should
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:02:26 i have a bigger plane
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:02:30 its fine
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:02:35 its just the one
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:02:47 even tried moving it to a new save file
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:02:49 didnt work
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:02:57 its just cursed
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:04:06 the motor 2 one is kinda urgent cuz of how much it is used
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:04:15 the bomb glitches can wait
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:04:21 id rather it be fixed in pc2
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:04:59 yea
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:05:07 everyone using land vehicles
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:05:21 its all sorts of messed up
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:05:32 moving on its own, not responding to input
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:05:38 all sorts of messed up
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:06:17 no, my planes motor 2s actually go againsed air resistance
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:06:27 they want to spin the aircraft
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:06:38 yea
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:06:51 i only notice it at like 300
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:07:32 but only if i never excede 300, if i go above then slow down, its still broken
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:09:22 im thinking of maybe going to use pistons to move the custom controll surfaces
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:09:34 use a non powered motor as a bearing
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:09:47 just make a mechanical linkage
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:10:12 controll my plane like they actually do with hydrolics irl
