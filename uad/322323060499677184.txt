plane-crazy 2019-08-26 20:39:28 hihi
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 20:39:47 I'm going to start making a Luftwaffe ingame
plane-crazy 2019-08-26 20:40:02 transformer bad
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 00:40:19 man I shouldâ€™ve gotten a screenshot of my Messerschmitt before I turned off my PC
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 00:40:52 it was proportioned pretty correctly aswell
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 00:41:00 and it had its iron crosses
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 11:16:56 Speaking of German machinery
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 11:17:38 what plane is that
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 11:17:45 or did you make your own design
creations-chat 2019-08-27 11:19:37 Am I just able to plant an image of my creation in here and it gets put in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2019-08-27 11:20:00 you spaced out the letters as if to say you're sarcastic
creations-chat 2019-08-27 11:20:15 so I might ask someone else about that
creations-chat 2019-08-27 11:21:07 My happy little Messerschmitt BF-109
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 01:04:01 I built a happy little Kubelwagen today
plane-crazy 2019-08-28 01:04:27 So now Iâ€™ve got a King Tiger, a Messerschmitt and a Kubelwagen
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:26:17 all of these planes are nice but why build a passenger plane when you can build yourself a Messerschmitt Bf-109 and dress in a German uniform  https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/563779841212547091/615857541200740352/RobloxScreenShot20190827_113747402.png
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:26:27 oh wait
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:26:40 I didnâ€™t mean to input the long paragraph
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:26:45 into the creations channel
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:26:53 I was meant to separate the link
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:26:55 for fucks sake
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:26:57 wait no
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:27:00 for godâ€™s sake
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:27:10 Yes I know
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:27:29 What Iâ€™m saying is, if I separated the link to be an individual message to the paragraph
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:27:42 it wouldnâ€™t be sat in the creations chat
creations-chat 2019-08-28 01:27:46 without any context

creations-chat 2019-08-29 17:23:57 oh god
creations-chat 2019-08-29 17:24:04 the chat just gave my joke away
creations-chat 2019-08-29 17:24:22 it's in a private server so technically I'm not publicly saying it?
creations-chat 2019-08-29 17:24:46 And I don't exactly support it so
creations-chat 2019-08-29 17:24:59 I mean someone's still going to get me banned anyway
creations-chat 2019-08-29 17:25:08 and there's likely nothing I can do about it
creations-chat 2019-08-29 17:25:09 oh well
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:40:15 free wifi
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:40:20

creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:40:55 funny white van joke
creations-chat 2019-08-29 20:41:46

plane-crazy 2019-08-30 01:32:14 shut up communist
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 01:32:30 Iâ€™ve gave up trying to individualise capitalist Russians and Communist russians
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 01:32:43 because you both speak the same words and drink the same stuff
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 01:32:46 Iâ€™ve gave up
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 01:33:14 you could say that about British people
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 01:33:47 ðŸ˜³
creations-chat 2019-08-31 01:57:21 whatâ€™s the point of a submarine if the gameâ€™s physics donâ€™t allow air inside your ship
creations-chat 2019-08-31 01:57:26 if itâ€™s submerged
creations-chat 2019-08-31 01:57:29 completely
creations-chat 2019-08-31 01:57:47 in fact thatâ€™s just robloxâ€™s general physics
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:10:13 this relates to the game because the game has colours
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:10:21 B)
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:10:42 Thereâ€™s not exactly any nudity

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:22:58 but weâ€™re not exactly talking about too much of an atrocity
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:23:04 haha short person

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:26:08 go to wales and half of the buildings have ceilings lower than my chances of surviving above the age of 70
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:26:48 can we drop a third bomb
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:27:24 weâ€™ll learn from the Germans and do a gas attack instead
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:27:51 no theyâ€™ll just bomb us back
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:28:13 bomb a really innocent country
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:28:17 tokyo looks lively
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:28:25 Though Iâ€™d rather go to Kyoto
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:28:55 Japan sounds like such a nice place but I donâ€™t want to get robbed by crazy asian gangs who hate white peoples
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:29:08 like did you see that movie with that family
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:29:52 <@!304977711988867072>  Iâ€™m not robbing people and rapping just to go to asia
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:29:57 it took me a while to answer that
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:30:20 Japan sounds like a dream place if youâ€™re in the right area
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:30:34 The furthest Iâ€™ve been from home though was Dominican Republic though
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:30:40 Iâ€™m from England
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:31:32 Paris is boring
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:31:42 the people are knobheads
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:31:50 and their best attraction is a giant steel tower
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:32:22 Manchester is great, you spend half of your wages on useless items and then get stabbed by a black man on your way out
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:32:54 I hate England itâ€™s so god damn boring
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:33:14 If I ever learn Japanese Iâ€™ll move to Japan, if itâ€™s not been bombed again
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:33:44 can someone recommend me somewhere good in Europe
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:34:01 Germany was the best but I need better than the best
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:34:12 I went Cologne and Bonn
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:34:46 Manchester is best
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:34:48 London bad
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:35:24 I donâ€™t think anyone noticed my really funny joke so Iâ€™ll repost it
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:36:05 call me kevin is great
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:36:13 we should all praise him
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:36:27 no
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:36:43 heâ€™s best youtuber
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:37:18 hollow from dark soul be like ðŸ’€
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:37:26 fart hole 3
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:38:22 My best creation is probably either my rocket or my Messerschmitt BF-109
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:39:05 you havenâ€™t
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:39:11 I built it in a private server
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:39:22 and I havenâ€™t gone out of that server
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:39:38 plus I donâ€™t have a screenshot and Iâ€™m not turning on my computer at 03:39
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:39:49 to show some crappy rocket I made in like 3 hours
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:40:13 donâ€™t get me wrong it works really well but some sweat would make fun of me because itâ€™s not professional
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:41:49 
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:42:10 how does your rocket run on 2 god damn rocket engines
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:42:24 mine needs like 14
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:42:27 or something
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:42:33 and theyâ€™re large rockets
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:42:46 needs
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:42:49 nerds
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:43:02 why build your own PC when you can spend your hard earned cash on ketamine
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:43:38 thereâ€™s nothing like a good calvin klein in the bathroom
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:44:35 just get the lastest thing from your nearest Curryâ€™s PC world and realise you spent like Â£200 on something you could get for a quarter of the price online
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:45:05 oh
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:45:21 iâ€™m only 7
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:45:24 ðŸ˜³
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:45:34 no Iâ€™m joking
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:45:47 b ruh
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:46:01 breakfast
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:46:24 if I remove the word â€˜eroticâ€™ from the sentence I said before
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:46:28 can I keep it
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:46:39 sod of
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:46:41 f
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:46:48 oh
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:46:55 wasdwadwasdwas
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:47:21 why even build a PC just buy one rather than wasting time and money
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:47:41 but
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:47:44 the effort
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:47:54 could be used to make tea instead
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:48:43 just stick the PC into a bath tub, get in and plug it in at any time you feel like it
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:49:03 friendly advice from a friendly person
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:51:08 stop removing my `funny` images
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:51:53 what the hell is that
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:52:01 not to get political
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:52:08 I love fire hazards
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:52:11 where do I buy one
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:52:22 cool
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:52:46 arson is funny if it doesnâ€™t kill more than 2 people
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:53:49 Iâ€™m waiting for the day that thereâ€™s a way to make wheels not stick out whilst also being able to turn them
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:54:02 what do you call those things on cars that go over the wheels and tires
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:54:15 thatâ€™s pretty good
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:54:20 like really good
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:55:03 I donâ€™t have any builds that look professional but they all do their task, whether theyâ€™re a tank or a plane or a pedo van
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:55:09 or even a rocket
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:55:35 I might build a nice ship that goes at a steady speed and looks clean
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:55:47 why
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:56:23 that looks good
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:57:15 Iâ€™m also thinking of an x-wing with retractable wings
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:57:23 but it sounds pretty hard to me
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:57:37 no
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:57:44 B) is better than ðŸ˜Ž
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:58:01 tutorials are bad
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 02:58:15 ignore my tiger tank that was made from a tutorial
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:01:30 I might make the ultimate stagecoach bus
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:01:38 and charge people Â£3.50
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:01:43 for a ticket
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:01:56 what do you mean if it bends
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:02:00 in what way
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:03:17 this doesnâ€™t look like it would bend
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:03:20 so no it probably wonâ€™t bend
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:03:31 why
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:04:14 ugly
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:04:50 regular stagecoaches are cooler because
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:05:03 stagecoach is dominant to any other public transport service
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:05:05 in the world
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:05:26 not all of them are second story
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:05:47 stagecoach is just the most british way of travelling ever
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:06:02 we do walk sometimes
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:06:08 but most people are lazy
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:06:13 because itâ€™s
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:06:14 Britain
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:06:25 who do you think we are, Europeans?
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:06:31 actually we technically still
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:06:35 are europeans
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:06:58 Who do you think we are, any country in mainland Europe?
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:07:04 I donâ€™t think so
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:07:22 viking boring
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:07:52 that doesnâ€™t compare to who we conquered hundreds of years later
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:08:16 one third of the world = some indians
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:08:58 what
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:09:06 thereâ€™s 190 countries I think
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:09:12 and we conquered 63
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:09:34 thatâ€™s, timed by 3, 189
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:09:40 so it is nearly a third
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:10:24 i donâ€™t know
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:10:38 but itâ€™s still almost 1/3
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:10:55 whjat
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:11:03 Itâ€™s not 1/5
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:11:35 Iâ€™m talking about countries here
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:11:37 not land mass
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:12:27 because
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:12:32 itâ€™s easier to measure
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:12:38 a third of 195
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:12:57 itâ€™s still 63 countries
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:13:00 out of 195
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:13:14 saying 1/3 is better

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:22:48 who think itâ€™s as simple as sharing is caring
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:23:18 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:23:20 yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:23:32 mass starvation and poverty is the equivalent of a bad smell

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:24:31 yes I think we know that
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:24:48 the berlin wall shouldâ€™ve stayed up and weâ€™d be able to watch people in the east slowly starve because of communism

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:30:05 you donâ€™t even need dipping sauces if you have it salted
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:30:33 why is English food culture so bad
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 03:30:48 like we just got some leaves and put them with hot water and milk

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:12:27 15
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:13:27 how the hell do I get different ranks
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:13:50 probably never
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:18:08 An easy way to say I wonâ€™t be getting ranks anytime soon is to say that I donâ€™t have any idea what it means by pitch or yaw with a rocket
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:18:19 I know what yaw means
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:18:43 but Iâ€™m not sure what it means by pitch in terms of a rocket
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:20:52 youâ€™re probably tricking me for some unfunny joke but go on
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:21:21 hmm yes because saying no kidding makes me believe you
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:21:27 but like I said, continue

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:22:46 Alright I understand you
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:23:40 why is it a secret if you say it in a public chat
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:23:44 how does that work
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:24:43 I should probably sleep considering itâ€™s 05:24
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:25:10 yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:25:15 I am in the Uk
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:25:16 UK
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:27:47 so if pitching the rocket is just elevating into the sky like a rocket does
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:28:02 and yaw is to just go sideways
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:29:32 shut up doge profile picture <@456226577798135808> <@456226577798135808>

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:39:12 and itâ€™s not disowning itâ€™s just murder
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:05:05 why unmute yourself when you can spam mods to do it for you until they block you
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:08:02 why do people give the CIS crap
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:08:50 it would be a bit more logical if they could shoot better though considering theyâ€™re droids
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:09:04 it doesnâ€™t sound possible
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:09:25 other than make your plane or vehicle or whatever super glitchy
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:09:30 so you spin off into the sky
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:10:07 and it glitches you to the point where your computer entirely changes itâ€™s siri or

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:17:16 no because theyâ€™re opposite species <@351809528209080324>
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:17:34 males and females are both human which is one species
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:17:53 wait so having an opinion gets me executed
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:17:57 oh

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:32:45 how do people draw like an artist on their PC
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:32:58 I can just about draw something decent with a pencil
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:33:26 I might get one
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:33:47 Iâ€™ve seen someone draw well with a mouse but it seems practically impossible for me
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:33:56 and for most people actually
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:34:34 I mean Iâ€™d buy one but I still have a longsword on my list of purchases
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:34:49 and they sell them for cheap just a few hours away from where I live
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:35:08 to kill people like you who disrespect traps <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:35:12 B)

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:35:54 i think everyone has said that already
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:36:24 thatâ€™s technically gay still because if you both look like girls it can class as lesbian
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 10:36:26 ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³

creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:41:07 <@456226577798135808> Hey man with your submarine, wouldnâ€™t it just fill up with water upon going under? Or is there something ingame that can actually stop that from happening?
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:42:08 How is it considered working then
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:42:14 I mean heâ€™s built it really well but
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:42:53 Why did he even build a submarine
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:42:57 if you can build a bus
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:43:15 what do you mean â€˜.......â€™
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:44:46 I like vehicles that can be used for more than just driving around aimlessly
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:45:14 a submarine would fill up with water, any rockets will instantly explode in water
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:45:31 I have my own fighter jet I named as a V1 viking B)
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:45:48 I also built a Messerschmitt, a Kubelwagen and a Tiger tank
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:46:00 And my own boat with 2nd Reich patterns
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:46:33 my Kubelwagen also has an artillery gun which can be detached from the vehicle
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:46:55 yes but it takes `effort` to make your own missiles
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:47:23 I have lots of builds but I donâ€™t think any of them reach a minimum requirement
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:47:45 I still have no idea what yawing a rocket means
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:47:59 ah
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:48:15 I could implement that
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:48:43 my rocket already flies upwards and I can land it
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:56:29 What do you mean by that, I have a plane that flies and turns well and is over 200 blocks
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:56:36 and thatâ€™s basically going to get me a rank?
creations-chat 2019-09-01 11:59:16 I could also tell everyone my bus is unique and get someone to give me a designer role ðŸ˜Ž
creations-chat 2019-09-01 13:12:14 but why
creations-chat 2019-09-01 13:12:21 thatâ€™s a lot of effort and time
creations-chat 2019-09-01 13:12:31 over some lego game

plane-crazy 2019-09-01 13:12:49 
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 13:13:31 not funny didnâ€™t laugh
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 13:14:59 whatâ€™s the point of using a god damn discord bot for music
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 13:15:09 just open up youtube or itunes or spotify
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 13:15:36 you can have what you want without having to worry about some panda bloke
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 13:15:48 what the hell is stupid about that

plane-crazy 2019-09-01 13:16:01 so
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 13:16:03 How so
plane-crazy 2019-09-01 13:16:15 But youâ€™re all muted

creations-chat 2019-09-01 15:48:01 I've made a basic Gatling gun that turns, spins the barrel and goes up/down
creations-chat 2019-09-01 15:51:54 why
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:20:53 I've built a little control station protected by walls, surrounded by grass with a Gatling gun that spins the barrel, turns and goes up/down. I'm planning to add a T34 battle tank here to use, possibly a helicopter.
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:23:44 I didn't ask
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:24:42 Listen I'm not some professional builder who sweats his mantits on this
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:24:51 so don't expect me to build a masterpiece
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:25:15 beaned
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:25:54 I was posting expecting at least a little bit of feedback from someone?
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:26:34 Saying 'looks like something from 2012 noob haha wasdsawdasdwasdsadwdsadwa' doesn't help me figure out
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:26:40 how to make it not look 2012
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:27:05 I was setting up an untrue example to make Vip look worse than he is B)
creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:27:30 I never said I didn't expect insults either <@!395442152793964547>

creations-chat 2019-09-01 17:30:09 You'll likely say 'its obvious' but there's nothing that's literally telling you
general 2019-12-03 17:21:11 what's up twatters
creations-chat 2019-12-03 20:01:50 how did you make that
creations-chat 2019-12-03 20:01:56 seriously I wanna know
creations-chat 2019-12-03 20:02:15 I mean I might try an ATST instead simply because it's easier
creations-chat 2019-12-03 20:02:28 but knowing how that ATAT works would really help
general 2019-12-03 20:02:39 what's up twatters
general 2019-12-07 17:19:13 bruh when does winter event start

general 2019-12-07 22:21:29 the blocks are
general 2019-12-07 22:21:32 not the wedge pieces
general 2019-12-07 22:22:28 
creations-chat 2019-12-08 12:48:54 I tried making a flak 38, while it's not the most accurate one it works pretty well and the motor2 isn't having a heart attack so I like it

plane-crazy 2019-12-08 17:19:19 that I could've took an idea from
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 17:19:21 but I can't find it
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 17:21:47 also how would I go about making something with conveyors that also turns
plane-crazy 2019-12-08 17:21:52 or is that not possible
creations-chat 2019-12-09 07:59:51 I have Stagecoach single decker bus

general 2019-12-15 19:14:07 just want to know if anyone has a solution or at least a reason why it's happening
general 2019-12-15 19:14:25 no it's not plane crazy
general 2019-12-15 19:14:31 hence why it's not in the plane crazy chat
general 2019-12-15 19:14:33 https://gyazo.com/da9c2f0402836103ed4ae71418e93fc0

general 2019-12-15 19:15:20 https://gyazo.com/af08bf96b4dbfde3bfa3dfb03324a37c
general 2019-12-15 19:15:28 this is with the wedges

general 2019-12-15 19:15:52 they just seem to fall off
general 2019-12-15 19:16:08 https://gyazo.com/102e3cd81a470269e328d99dd6d35b0b
general 2019-12-15 19:16:52 any help anyone?
general 2019-12-15 19:20:22 they don't literally fall off ingame
general 2019-12-15 19:20:32 its confusing
general 2019-12-15 19:20:48 they appear on the model when it's not on the player
general 2019-12-15 19:21:00 they're just named wedge
general 2019-12-15 19:21:04 each one of them
general 2019-12-15 19:21:07 ok
general 2019-12-15 19:21:12 that's the problem I imagine
general 2019-12-15 19:21:13 yes
general 2019-12-15 19:21:13 yes
general 2019-12-15 19:21:16 okay cheers man
general 2019-12-15 19:21:36 because I didn't even do the script myself I stole it from a free model
general 2019-12-15 19:21:42 B)
general 2019-12-15 19:21:51 the models are all my own though
general 2019-12-15 19:23:47 cheers lads
general 2019-12-15 19:26:50 sorted it
general 2019-12-15 19:27:20 nevermind
general 2019-12-15 19:27:27 still not working
general 2019-12-15 19:27:45 also that back part was just me doing a blond moment despite not being blond
general 2019-12-15 19:27:50 doesn't matter now it's sorted
general 2019-12-15 19:27:54 well not sorted
general 2019-12-15 19:27:56 whatever
general 2019-12-15 19:32:22 <@!163143541160148992> okay sorry to tag you but how am I supposed to make it so that wedges actually appear on the model
general 2019-12-15 19:32:31 I can't find a working way to do it
general 2019-12-15 19:32:46 I know almost fuck all about scripting so this was a bad idea in the first place
general 2019-12-15 19:36:13 ok
general 2019-12-15 19:37:57 still not working
general 2019-12-15 19:38:16 sorry to bother you it's just I can't post on devforums yet
general 2019-12-15 19:40:51 ohits because it's meant to be a h rather than a C
general 2019-12-15 19:40:57 I think
general 2019-12-15 19:41:39 okay so
general 2019-12-15 19:41:44 its worked
general 2019-12-15 19:41:48 but now there's another problem
general 2019-12-15 19:41:49 https://gyazo.com/062bafb1644a3e1a3b013deabc5a2d77
general 2019-12-15 19:41:55 im stuck in this specific place
general 2019-12-15 19:43:46 I did that and my studio nearly crashed
general 2019-12-15 19:44:17 I think it means the wedges are welded in place and are there to stay
general 2019-12-15 19:44:23 compared to the rest of it
general 2019-12-15 19:44:32 which moves with me
general 2019-12-15 19:44:59 https://gyazo.com/6d82870877a604049823d6a4dd0e0ad0
general 2019-12-15 19:45:05 studio is just stuck like this
general 2019-12-15 19:45:11 christ
general 2019-12-15 19:46:54 yes
general 2019-12-15 20:11:24 is there an easy way to weld the entire thing
general 2019-12-15 20:11:34 instead of having to weld each individual piece
general 2019-12-15 20:16:46 I really need an answer
general 2019-12-15 20:18:08 <@!163143541160148992> sorry to tag you again please don't spazz out
general 2019-12-15 20:18:19 but is there an easy way to weld an entire model
general 2019-12-15 20:18:26 because I forgot one key thing which was welding
general 2019-12-15 20:28:36 https://gyazo.com/b59f7a6a0137b5191a6b39d509b3b450
general 2019-12-15 20:28:41 I tried using a welding plugin
general 2019-12-15 20:28:50 and i can now walk around in the webbing
general 2019-12-15 20:28:53 but this happens
general 2019-12-15 20:28:57 it just keeps spawning the model
general 2019-12-15 20:36:34 what
general 2019-12-15 20:59:50 https://gyazo.com/ac6f09af58d4e9356d5b7ea2a8cb1b86
general 2019-12-15 20:59:55 it looks like a fucking tumour
general 2019-12-15 21:00:46 I've found 0 solutions online to this
general 2019-12-15 21:00:52 I think I'll just give up
general 2019-12-15 21:00:57 it sounds much easier
general 2019-12-15 21:33:52 my final solution is just to remove all wedges in it and to use regular parts whilst making it still looks like the back is a cross
general 2019-12-15 21:34:01 it's my only theory behind it
general 2019-12-16 16:44:37 https://gyazo.com/848c5d248d49418846d74f9715bd61e9
general 2019-12-16 16:44:52 finished my webbing
general 2019-12-16 16:44:54 and helmet
general 2019-12-16 16:45:06 uniform is just stolen from a group
general 2019-12-16 16:45:14 ill probably ask for their permission later

general 2019-12-16 19:22:31 thoughts?
general 2019-12-16 19:41:05 yes
general 2019-12-16 20:43:08 would you say having a katana, tanto, naginata and nodachi is over-equipping the character a bit?
general 2019-12-16 20:43:09 https://gyazo.com/7aa92cb9d1e6f821db579f04720d66ba
general 2019-12-16 22:43:16 Itâ€™s not actually for a loadout sort of thing yet
general 2019-12-16 22:43:24 I was just seeing what models I could make
general 2019-12-16 22:43:49 If I were to do loadouts Iâ€™d have different armour for each sort of class though
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:14:22 I'm confused, I was playing this game last wednesday yet there was no snow around the map or anything yet, I'm seeing images from last wednesday with snow in the game
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:14:38 oh okay
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:15:17 it snows in february over here

plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:15:59 with the 5 or 6 barrels
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:16:10 or is that not being added until a later update
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:16:30 that was ages ago
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:16:35 I've got a better one now trust me
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:16:47 I thought I changed it
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:16:50 before that
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:16:51 huh

plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:16:58 my proper one
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:17:30 
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:18:02 what do you mean
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:18:08 I built it from scratch
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:18:25 you could say I took inspiration from the youtube one
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:18:34 the youtube one is very innacurate

plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:19:19 they've got big differences
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:19:26 whats your point Zayden
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:20:20 lad or lass can I have a response on how you're saying the 2 planes are the same thing
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:20:29 since they don't look the same in my eyes
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:21:21 no response, I'll end my argument by saying they're 2 different planes and that I'm correct
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:21:25 right cool
creations-chat 2019-12-27 18:24:00 some headers keep saying my BF-109 is copied from a youtube video, and I assure you there's no video of this plane online, I did do a tutorial one like 4 months ago but I got rid of it and made my own because of how inaccurate it was
creations-chat 2019-12-27 18:24:37 
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:37:07 is it possible to have turning wheels that don't stick out like a moonbuggy
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:37:28 what do you mean
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:37:32 I've not played this game
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:37:33 for a while
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:37:36 please elaborate
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:37:45 yes but I mean with the proper wheels
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:37:54 since I don't want mine to be 7 block wide
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:38:24 I'm looking to make more of a car or truck sized thing
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:38:31 
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:38:32 this is what I want to build
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:38:39 but I don't want my wheels to stick out
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:38:54 Zayden I want it for my flak-38
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:39:03 for it to drag the flak gun around
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:39:28 would you say this grey is correct
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:39:31 or should it be lighter/darker
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:39:52 it is grey
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:40:00 if you look at my colour in the colour pallet
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:40:29 should I keep it with the diamond plate texture
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:40:30 or no
plane-crazy 2019-12-27 18:40:54 I'll have it with the metal texture I think
creations-chat 2019-12-27 19:21:13 A bit of a chonky version of the Katyusha artillery truck
creations-chat 2019-12-27 19:21:31 
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:17:43 Not an amazing build, but it's an Opel Blitz with a mounted Flak 38 on the back, the disconnectors are there so I can hold my trapdoors up, I disconnect them upon spawning
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:17:45 
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:25:52 it is one
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:26:01 I just realised the wheels are grey
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:28:04 oh wait the wheels are meant to be grey according to images
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:28:06 right
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:29:53 Britain is superior to America
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:29:56 filthy colonial
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:44:30 I'm sad that it's going to be a challenge if I want to make a giant British flag
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:44:36 I will  just do an English flag
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:45:30 cax you can just do a yellow blocky circle
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:45:37 of it
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:45:37 with some greens and blacks in the middle
creations-chat 2019-12-27 21:45:44 it doesn't look too much of a challenge
creations-chat 2019-12-28 01:00:20 <@!476100923408646147> How do you make planes loop
creations-chat 2019-12-31 03:45:43 I had a sick tie fighter that looked amazing
creations-chat 2019-12-31 03:45:49 but it couldnâ€™t fly
creations-chat 2019-12-31 03:45:52 for some reason
creations-chat 2019-12-31 18:30:06 Made a somewhat decent Hawker Hurricane, downside is you can see the blue flames from the rocket engine at the front, I also don't have a WWII RAF uniform so I'm stuck with my regular uniform
creations-chat 2019-12-31 18:30:07 
creations-chat 2019-12-31 18:47:42 it's not amazing but I've gave my BF-109 a bit of a repaint for winter
creations-chat 2019-12-31 18:47:55 not based off of anything
creations-chat 2019-12-31 18:49:10 
creations-chat 2020-01-04 01:13:09 <@456226577798135808> yo bossman sorry to tag you but how did you make Lukeâ€™s speeder float
creations-chat 2020-01-04 01:13:38 Iâ€™m trying to make a TX-130 Republic tank so it would help if I know how you made yours float

general 2020-01-09 22:55:11 general is for generally just discussing
creations-chat 2020-01-12 10:39:38 didnâ€™t ask
creations-chat 2020-01-12 20:10:50 Messerschmitt BF-109 with a crappy winter camo
creations-chat 2020-01-12 20:11:28 had to escape after literally being shot down, but I forgot my M30 drilling and now some sort of dangerous animal like a Soviet or something, is going to eat me alive while I have no way of defending myself
creations-chat 2020-01-18 10:53:58 Is there a way to use conveyors on a tank, while making it able to turn?
creations-chat 2020-01-19 00:08:18 liking it
creations-chat 2020-01-19 00:08:54 I have a few decent builds but I can't be bothered digging out loads of images
creations-chat 2020-01-19 00:09:44 here's a nice looking (at least in my opinion) Kawanishi N1K2
creations-chat 2020-01-19 00:10:03 a sort of winter camo for my BF-109
creations-chat 2020-01-19 00:10:13 not as good as my original paint for it
creations-chat 2020-01-19 00:11:02 Opel Blitz, turret looks a bit fugly and I know someone will point it out as a spammer gun of some sort, but it functions well
creations-chat 2020-01-19 00:11:49 the disconnectors by the door are just holding up the door, I disconnect them when I spawn it in
creations-chat 2020-01-19 12:56:49 made the mistake of trying to make an AT-ST, anyone know how I can make this thing successfully walk?
creations-chat 2020-01-19 16:05:32 unpainted A6 Juggernaut
creations-chat 2020-01-19 16:05:44 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/383729588272103427/668485958802472976/juggernaut66.png Used this to make it
creations-chat 2020-01-19 16:06:02 although that image is actually backwards
creations-chat 2020-01-19 16:06:09 I used a few more similar to it
creations-chat 2020-01-19 16:06:22 
creations-chat 2020-01-19 16:06:34 no interior as of yet, besides a few seats
creations-chat 2020-01-19 16:15:40 didn't ask
creations-chat 2020-01-19 16:37:38 
general 2020-01-21 21:47:29 can someone tell me how I can plant a red star on my build, I've seen people with red star emojis or something
general 2020-01-21 21:47:32 need it for a build x
help 2020-01-21 21:48:19 not in there
help 2020-01-21 21:48:24 that's why I'm confused
help 2020-01-21 21:48:31 I see people with them but I cannot find it myself
help 2020-01-21 21:52:32 rite got it
help 2020-01-21 21:52:34 cheers hyper x
creations-chat 2020-01-22 18:54:46 Spartan mate would you mind if I interpreted my own (by that I mean copy) your A 74-Z
creations-chat 2020-01-22 19:38:12 cheers
creations-chat 2020-01-22 19:38:39 might make a republic speeder to go with my A6 Juggernaut
creations-chat 2020-01-22 19:39:03 but it would be horrible to have to give it arrow keys because otherwise the speeder and A6 would move at the same time
creations-chat 2020-02-16 12:39:53 My A6 Juggernaut from Star Wars, 1076 blocks, includes a small turret which is based off a clone turret I saw in the first ever SW battlefront, has a boarding station with an officer's desk and a holo-computer thing, a few crates and obviously the juggernaut itself. The Juggernaut is a little bit undersized but I can live with that
