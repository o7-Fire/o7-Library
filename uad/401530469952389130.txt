general 2021-08-05 18:20:58 ?????
general 2021-08-05 18:21:49 the rules say no 40s german symbol. what if im building a german plane from that era and want historical accuracy. would it be ok then?
general 2021-08-05 18:23:26 NSFW is anything you wouldnt want your boss to see
general 2021-08-05 18:24:02 a literal dumptruck swinging around is 100% suggestive

general 2021-08-05 18:24:44 bruh
general 2021-08-05 18:25:03 i hope the bouncy fiji water didnt get removed
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:07:45 A-129?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:09:35 oh the Tiger UHT?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:17:54 in the rank channel, it says VTOL cant use helium. does that mean propulsion? or does it mean no helium at all on the build
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:20:41 damn thats kinda dumb. my F-35 is 700 blocks and uses jet engines for vtol, but is unstable in non-vtol flight so i used helium and ballast blocks. guess i should make a harrier or something without helium and see if i can get the rank
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:21:17 i was talking abt no helium at all
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:21:34 yeah thats cool
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:23:42 i did. it has abt 20 jet engines just for vtol, and about 15 super rockets for flight + 6 jet engines. i used ballast and helium together and in total it took me abt 4 hours of tuning to get it right
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:24:16 it still dips a little when flying so i just turn on the vtol at abt 5% and it fixed it
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:24:31 😩didnt
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:24:51 i kinda dont know how xd
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:24:58 ok gimme a second
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:25:04 my pc takes a while to boot up
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:26:23 what if i made my F-5 vtol 🤔
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:26:41 bruh i said it takes a bit
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:27:32 do you wanna see both or just the F-35?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:27:48 ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:28:02 F-5 isnt done yet so it looks kinda bad xd
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:28:14 hold up my pc is almost done
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:32:17 <@456226577798135808> what vc should i get in
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:32:36 oh i thought you wanted to see functionality but ok

plane-crazy 2021-08-06 07:41:38 iraqi ice cream i see
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 08:15:02 or just downvote them xd
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 08:15:17 i think a downvote is much better than no attention
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 08:17:28 wait, if you post multiple pictures of a build in creations, and they get a collective of 100+ upvotes, does it go in the hall of fame? or is it just 1 picture needs 100+
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 08:18:50 yo quacker, can i get a full view of the B-2?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 08:19:01 like, a video of you sleoly panning around it
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 08:21:26 sheesh that thing is clean
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 08:22:07 yo how does it fly tho? it looks me me that the wings are 2 blocks tall? how did you fine wing panels in em
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 08:23:56 ??? can i see a picture of it when its not spawned?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 08:25:13 oh i see
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 08:25:21 ok that makes much more sense
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 08:26:45 <@!308390576603267073> bro didnt you go like 55t speed numbers somehow
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 08:27:30 oh

creations-chat 2021-08-07 03:25:03 ok
creations-chat 2021-08-07 03:28:32 how can i make my F-5 better?
creations-chat 2021-08-07 03:32:21 Thanks. ill see what i can do.
creations-chat 2021-08-07 03:34:34 im broke xd. the fanta is doable but idk about a new chair. also im 3 states from home rn
creations-chat 2021-08-07 04:35:50 how? the fuselage is 3 blocks wide then and 7 at the widest part of the engine
creations-chat 2021-08-07 04:38:31 also thats a newer F-5 variant. mine is an E from the 70s. probably the only thing i could do is make the intakes smaller and maybe do the same for the engine section but idk. im still p new
creations-chat 2021-08-07 04:41:31 i bet i could maybe make the sides a half block or block thinner
creations-chat 2021-08-07 04:44:26 yeah ok i see it now. the intakes are way to big along with the rest of it. how could i make a less sharp angle to match that of the real F-5?
creations-chat 2021-08-07 04:47:01 i did
creations-chat 2021-08-07 05:54:05 wow that thing looks insane
general 2021-08-15 06:12:23 yo someone in my game is talking about a new map? i see nothing here abt it
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 20:18:29 Anyone know how to make hubcaps for 3x3 cylinder wheels? ive seen a few cars that have some kinda colored circle in the middle of the wheels. how do i do that
plane-crazy 2021-08-15 20:18:56 ok

plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:49:48 thoughts on my trophy truck? ive decided cars are my favorite to make and i want to get good at it. how could i improve?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:50:21 (i already fixed the spare wheels not matching the real ones but i cant screenshot rn)
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 08:50:39 thanks but do you see anything i could fix/make better?
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:00:06 i came for criticism and got compliments :)
creations-chat 2021-08-16 09:13:42 spookston called me gay in an argument once.
creations-chat 2021-08-16 09:16:06 yes thats why it threw me off so bad. all i said was that thr HSTV-Ls gun probably wouldve sucked. it was funny
creations-chat 2021-08-16 09:20:16 why britain suck at making tanks till like 30 years ago? they invented them. they should atleast be good xd
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:22:28 i recognize that. looks like some kinda beechcraft plane i saw at a museum
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:23:20 yes. but only if you use keybinds. mouse wont work
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:23:45 isnt servo only for motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:24:03 wait
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:24:13 i just got a propulsion idea
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:25:04 motor 1 with a 1x4 wing panel on top of it spinning max speed. i wonder it could actually work.
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:25:20 prolly not but it would be an interesting experiment
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:25:32 yes my favorite
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:26:01 aw damn ok.
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:26:29 now i wanna figure out a new wing + motor propulsion system
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:26:35 duh
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:27:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:27:49 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:27:59 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:28:12 really only takes an hour or two of tuning to fly right
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:28:24 ye
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:28:53 helis are fun af
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:29:12 skill issue clearly 🥶🥶
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:31:26 ok does plane crazy edit saves like some kinda glitch? i made an apache as my first heli and had it function correctly. 1 main rotor and a tail rotor to negate the torque. it flew rlly bad cause it was my first, then i flew it again abt a week later and it flies perfectly.
plane-crazy 2021-08-16 09:32:25 fictional women are so hot omg im going to die if i go outside
creations-chat 2021-08-16 09:34:23 yeah so the tank is still meh

Ignore the license plate
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 03:23:16 i hate it so much when people make a good looking big plane like a B-2 or B-24 and then only use the stock control surfaces and ruin the look of the wings
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 03:26:41 me as a plane

plane-crazy 2021-09-01 13:36:26 i would prefer a larger main map but with infinite waters + islands so its not hard to meet up with friends or whatever

plane-crazy 2021-09-02 04:45:05 mine is an F-4E
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 04:45:55 so my nose is too short and needs to point down

plane-crazy 2021-09-02 04:52:22 yes they do
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 04:52:41 they were originally 2 blocks wide but i made them 3.5
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 04:53:03 ah yes, signs
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 04:53:29 ew no tracks
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 04:53:42 barf
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 04:54:26 there are 2 wide tracks. its not that hard to use them
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 04:54:50 water vapor
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 04:55:38 wings create vortexes. especially ehen turningg. those vortexes catch water vapor and make it visible
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 04:56:02 dm me if you want more info
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 04:58:34 wait im ryorda. thats not from vortexes. vortexes are at the ends of the wings. visible vapor in that spot is cause by highly compressed air traveling over and around the plane quickly. its kind of the same thing that causes vapor cones when going mach 1
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 04:59:25 the shockwave catches the water vapor and makes the cone. the air on the wings catches the vapor and makes the trailes

plane-crazy 2021-09-02 07:29:55 its kind of like stiffness but for shock absorption
plane-crazy 2021-09-02 07:30:23 no

creations-chat 2021-09-02 09:04:02 well, it would decrease structural integrity of the wings since the engines are pulling them away from the plane. the thrust probably wouldnt do too much to the fuselage tho.

plane-crazy 2021-09-03 22:41:47 first motorlock tower xd
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 22:59:12 there is
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 22:59:27 i wouldnt do it if there wasnt a need
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:02:51 the vert stab needs to sit 0.5 blocks down. because of the way the after burner is im the plane, i needed to use 3 locks for the tail. but then that made a gap that i couldnt put a block in or else the stabz wouldnt work. so i used the tower the fill the gap, aswell as add a little ridge to the top of the fuselage. also im going to use it for an angle lock in a bit
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:06:27 below is where the engines are but ill try
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 23:09:53 does "first motorlock tower" not say enough?

plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:23:07 garbage fucking plane xd
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:24:18 forward swept wings look cool but are the most retaded things ever
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:25:06 bad, ineffective
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:25:11 as i said
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:25:14 they look cool
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:29:42 dont forget that the tomcat can and certainly would hold its own against modern jets in a fight. the only reason variable geometry wings are so uncommon is because if the maintenance cost.
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:33:01 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:33:46 also explains why the only common variable wings are the b1 and tornado
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:34:20 at high speed: most like the f-14
at low speed: idfk, probably the f-16
creations-chat 2021-09-04 06:39:22 <@!847981335078895680> blocky, moves weird. ultimately uninteresting. i would say generally get better at building. if i were you id make it larger and incorporate a shooting mechanism and autoloader or something.
creations-chat 2021-09-04 06:41:26 ok. do it. challenge yourself.
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 06:41:42 that intake is genuinely painful

plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:32:26 its funny bc american F-5 literally only spent 14 weeks in vietnam before getting turned down for service
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:33:20 everyone used it more

plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:35:22 yes
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:35:29 by the americans
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:35:35 who?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:36:29 they only tested the F-5C for 14 weeks. they later adopted the F-5E over a decade later and actually used it
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:37:53 ive literally only ever heard of russia having 1 F-5
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:38:17 no? they gave them back to Northrop
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:38:54 iirc it was only 14 F-5Cs so it would be cheaper to give then back than make new ones
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:39:07 not until after the war, if at all
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:39:43 hot

plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:40:30 they used it after the war?
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:40:52 omg you are a dumbass
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:41:37 AMERICA GOT THE F-5C IN THE 60S AND USED THEM FOR 14 WEEKS. A DECADE LATER, ***AMERICA*** ADOPTED THE F-5***E***
plane-crazy 2021-09-04 09:43:08 yes like i said

creations-chat 2021-09-07 05:09:01 because hes an annoying, egotistical asshole who belittles new players yet acts like a little angel whenever anyone talks about it. 
like that asshole kid in elementary who would hit you but then act sweet and like the victim whenever questioned by the teacher
creations-chat 2021-09-07 05:11:32 you dont know the whole history lmao
creations-chat 2021-09-07 05:14:43 the past aka 5 hours ago. shut up no one likes you or cares what you think. youve already ruined your reputation and even if you did somehow change in 5 hours no one cares anyway.
creations-chat 2021-09-07 05:18:34 he got a massively inflated ego because two of his builds where well received and has been a massive asshole ever since. he tries to troll but is just unfunny. literally the only reason he speaks is to tell people how shit they are at the game. and as i said, whenever you talk about it he gets all pissy and acts like hes changed and all that bullshit.
creations-chat 2021-09-07 05:21:13 the actual definition plus hes just an all-around ass

help 2021-09-08 10:14:58 you need to get a minimum of 100 upvotes (downvotes are subtracted from the upvotes so if you get 100 upvotes and 3 downvotes you have 97 upvotes) and then you need to dm a mod/admin. then they will post a poll in VIP chat. where you need a score of 10 for it to go in hall of fame
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:15:43 so? if the response is overall positive does it matter?
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:16:24 “oh no i got 5 downvotes im leaving pcc and never playing roblos again <:nooo:787097964946259978>”
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:17:21 try again or wait till someone else upvotes it <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:18:32 a large margin of people think it takes less skill than stuff such as motorlocked planes or micro cars and therefore down vote it. makes sense
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:19:22 tbh im of the same opinion but i only downvote actually bad pixel art
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:20:46 thats how most people who think “less skill = bad” are
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:20:50 they suck if they try it
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:21:05 youre uno reverse is bad
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:21:11 lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:21:50 it will buff out
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:22:44 im of the opinion that “low skill = low skill” and “bad = bad”
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:22:57 🤮
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:23:15 very wrong
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:23:58 if you make a plane that looks good but doesn’t function at all (unless its supposed to be a display plane or a museum piece) youre gonna get downvotes
plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:24:15 thats the point of the cover. to be judged lmao

plane-crazy 2021-09-08 10:27:38 glowy imma be honest with you. youre bad at building. of course youre gonna get downvotes lmao. you seem to have a severe cause of self bias. its extremely important that you remember to try and view your builds as someone elses. it really helps me.

plane-crazy 2021-09-11 04:25:50 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 04:27:07 yes. imma add more wing panels too see if that fixes it
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 04:28:51 yeah that didnt help at all
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 04:30:46 oh
creations-chat 2021-09-11 05:55:37 <@!761479350934831125> i get the size is limiting and the phantom is a pain in the ass (trust me, i really do know lmao), but i think you couldve done way better. 

1: the intakes look more like the F-5s tbh. the phantoms intakes sit on top of the wings, not level with them, are more square than round, and the half wedge on the front of the intake should be the other way around. 

2: the horizontal stabilizers are way too big.

3: the vertical stabilizer is too small

4: the wings are way way too small. 

5: the spine is too tall. 

6: the cockpit framing isnt even painted (????).

7: the fuselage is too long.

7: motorlock the trails into the plane so they arent on the outside.

8: the nose is way too short.
creations-chat 2021-09-11 05:58:10 <@718545872522051606> it looks really good but you should fix the exposed motorlocks
creations-chat 2021-09-11 06:00:12 <@!761479350934831125> also i just realized, you didnt use motor 2 servos for the wings or horizontal stabs?? bruh 💀

plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:14:31 otherwise i wouldnt be helping you
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:16:21 <@456226577798135808> as i said, for the nose, use the half wedge from half blocks

for the shit behind the cockpit, use angle lock. 

move the wings down and generally fix the wing shape
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:16:51 bruh

plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:28:49 but uh
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:28:52 i just realized
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:28:57 da nose is too short
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:29:04 make it a block longer
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:29:28 use half wedge down 1x2
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:29:36 instead of the half wedge down
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:29:41 boom, pro nose
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:31:51 ye dat looks p good
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:32:07 aight, now for the behind of the cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:32:09 the spine
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:32:41 use angle lock so its a constant angle instead of some blocks and a 1x4 wedge or whatever it is
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:33:17 yeah at that scale thats near impossible without a plot full of motors
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:33:52 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:34:08 comically ugly plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:34:29 in the settings of motor 1 , click lock and powered and now you can angle lock
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:34:50 thats a p-51
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:35:05 ok
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:37:05 literally all you need to know is in that 1 message
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:37:37 if you try to angle lock with a powered only motor the plane will have a seizure
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:37:56 yo how the fuck do i permanently lock keys on roblos mobile?
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:38:15 and keep it from closing out of my game when i exit the app

plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:38:38 now connect that to the tower and connect a part to it and bam
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:38:43 custom wedge
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:38:59 ok
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:39:08 the cockpit looks like shit so its best to remake
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:39:29 you can add an angle lock under it to give the right look
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:39:47 this is a great reference image for the cockpit and spine
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 10:44:30 ignore all the disconnectors lol, the keybind for then didnt even show up

creations-chat 2021-09-27 07:45:28 see, id love to give him pointers, but the issue is that everytime he makes a minuscule change, he posts it in creations. it gets really annoying seeing basically the exact same build over and over and over
hes posted the plane 12 times. you cant tell me thats justified after maybe the 3rd or 4th time. he should only be posting it in feedback for now

plane-crazy 2021-09-27 08:42:01 real talk and no trol for a second

the nose on the F-4e is too long, i would shorten it by half a block, the vertical stabilizer isnt tall enough, and the cockpit should be slightly taller than the spine
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 08:43:13 some of that might not be possible to fix now that i think about it
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 08:44:32 aint no way the f-4e have that long of a schnoz

creations-chat 2021-09-27 08:59:45 oh wait i habgr movdel

wings are still wrong, the transition from the intakes into the wings is very abrupt and not rounded at all

wing shape is still wrong. only half of the wing is swept

the horizontal stabilizers are way off, also its missing engines
plane-crazy 2021-09-27 09:01:43 satisfying 
also is this improved version worth posting in creations or are the changes too subtle?

creations-chat 2021-09-27 11:13:06 whats with the block of shit. j bet your build doesnt even resemble a mech. you should try motorlocking

plane-crazy 2021-09-28 22:29:52 tbh there prolly are a few things in there that didnt require locks but idgaf tbh. it was just easier to overlock the shit out of it
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 22:32:40 illegal? i thought it was a glitch that people liked and then rickje turned it into an actual legitimate game feature
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 22:33:15 uh
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 22:33:19 motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 22:33:31 or make a sprocket

creations-chat 2021-09-29 00:26:14 no way its the specific rim
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 01:14:53 or you could just use motorlocking instead of having a massive build
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 01:15:29 its really not as hard as ppl say

creations-chat 2021-09-29 10:50:54 it is not lmao its very basic, cheese grater wings, not detailed, and looks like it has zero motorlock whatsoever
also the proportions suck
creations-chat 2021-09-29 10:53:32 HAHAHAHA

yeah ive seen plenty of good builds that have used none or very minimal motorlock. that n1 could certainly use some however. i wouldnt mention motorlock if i didnt think it needed it.
creations-chat 2021-09-29 10:57:00 you either make it massive so you can use the blocks as intended, use motorlock to make it small-medium, or use no motorlock and make it small and make it look terrible
creations-chat 2021-09-29 10:59:31 6 am creations sucks lmao. bush post something good to cleanse our eyes
or weep.
or anyone please
creations-chat 2021-09-29 11:02:34 at this point i cant build something without atleast 1 motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:06:03 all you needa fix is the circled shit. the rest looks fine
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:09:58 the intakes bein all square and shit. the canopy looks good

prolly shouldve been more clear and said that the body is too thin and the stabilizers should have that double edge
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:11:02 no this

plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:30:37 *dies*
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:31:09 i wonder how many blocks are just from the motorlock towers
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:32:11 what if i removed all the motors and saw the block count
creations-chat 2021-09-29 11:32:26 do it again.
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:32:44 motorlocking is used purely for detail lol
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:32:59 you dont need it to have something that works
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:33:07 its just to make shit look good
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:33:15 or sometimes work better
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:33:32 i dont mix with you pvp heathens

plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:35:12 totally have never done it
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:35:54 tbh a single exposed motorlock can mean the difference between 30 upvotes and 60
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:36:07 unless youre cool like me and use them as detail 😎
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:36:15 what
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:37:13 i use it as little greebily bits like on the under side of cars
plane-crazy 2021-09-29 11:37:36 (and not because i fucked up the tower and put it in the wrong spot lmao)

creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:31:44 i got 150 on my ecto. i forgot to boost my ego gimme a second
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:37:21 lmao thats how it was with my abrams. it got like 70 upvotes and my ego went through the roof. ecto-1 gets hella upvotes and it did nothing lol

hi
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:40:06 tbh i feel like once you get good enough you dont get ego boosts from upvotes, just happy. honestly i did get a little bit more confidence in terms of my motorlock skills from the ecto.
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:43:24 yeah. the best way to measure build quality is by contacting experts or just posting it in here.
i wouldnt say masters are good for feedback since they never really post here lmao
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:46:17 tbh there should be an expert designer chat, since its definitely the hardest expert role to get. then we can all have a secret hang out 😎

plane-crazy 2021-10-09 06:31:00 wow thats an insanely small amount of motorlock for how good that thing looks
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 06:31:36 ye. you could extend that by another 4 blocks if need be
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 06:31:56 could you use small tower?

plane-crazy 2021-10-09 06:33:43 ok then make a tiny tower on the roof and use the tower to put the disconnector in the empty spot
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 06:34:22 ye that you could fix in 20 seconds and have a great vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 06:34:44 laziness

plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:06:59 uh one thing
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:07:32 put a 1x3 delta here
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:10:12 mmm
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:10:23 make it a 1x4 and get rid of that flat bit
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:11:35 wha
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:12:34 oh
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:12:52 ye get rid of those and make it a 1x4
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:13:42 ??
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:14:13 yeah its too small to be noticeable
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:14:28 the wing shape is much more noticeable
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:15:54 would you rather have a small, unnoticeable detail thats semi accurate, or a large one that looks way better
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:16:51 if i were you id make the wing accurate
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:18:21 look at how minuscule the bit the wedges represent is
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:18:46 smol
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:21:53 where
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:22:02 oh
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:22:07 on the leading edge
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:22:26 wait a sec
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:22:50 what happened to the motor for the wing angle
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:23:21 why
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:24:08 the wings angle up, i meant remove the half wedges
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:24:20 since the detail they are supposed to be is so small
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:25:21 ye
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:25:34 tbh i prefer the 1x1 over the 1x3
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:27:44 uh
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 08:27:47 lemme see both

plane-crazy 2021-10-09 17:46:46 so
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 17:47:01 a bot warn is to remind someone not to use a word
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 17:47:19 a mod warn is when a mod goes !warn whoever
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 17:47:40 yeah but its not a real warn
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 17:47:52 it just DMs you saying that the filter censored the word
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 17:48:00 Dyno are real warns
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 17:48:05 these are real
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 17:48:24 these are not
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 17:48:34 you can get punished for mod warns, such as a ban or kick
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 17:48:46 theres no punishment for mee6 warns
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 17:49:06 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 17:50:31 it would be stupid if there was a filter and you still got punished for smth it censored

creations-chat 2021-10-10 22:22:19 yeah but the thing is is that sirens are kind of a weird thing to fixate on in a vehicle building game. i can understand cars, planes, trains, boats, mechs, hell even animals and shit, but why sirens?

yes but why sirens? theres always one or two people who make unique and interesting things. i just think its odd that so many people make sirens.

creations-chat 2021-10-11 21:25:32 thats fine. just call it a custom or smth. dont label yours builds as an existing thing without being able to replicate them well.

hope that didnt sound mean. i just meant it wont be received well if its basically a custom car labeled as an existing one

creations-chat 2021-10-12 05:35:55 studs are the roblox unit of measurement. i believe its like 0.85 meters iirc. so the speed number is not miles per hour. i dont care to know the actual conversation so i just call it speed numbers

creations-chat 2021-10-12 05:56:48 18k sps is 2000mph. so very accurate to the real plane

the real plane would travel at about  sps wait no im stupid

the real plane would travel at 19.6k sps in game
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:01:07 <@!778226997427568662> 
1 meter = 20 studs
19600 (sps)/20 = 980
980 meters per second = 2193 mph

(i rounded away the decimals)
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:03:09 that seems wrong give me a second
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:05:49 <@!778226997427568662> well the math is right but the plane crazy speed of sound is way off. honestly sps is stupid anyway because a robloxian is 25 centimeters tall. since they are 5 studs tall.
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:07:54 im american so i did mph cause im still learning metric conversions
3529 kph is 2193 mph
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:12:54 wait, if 20 studs = 1 meter, and the speed of sound is 343 mps, then the plane crazy speed of sound is 6860 sps, not 3920. so 6860 x 2.8 is 19208 HAHA I WAS RIGHT LETS GO
well i was closer than you 💀😎

bruh. why the fuck did you not tell be 1 meter is 4 studs.

at least i was right when it comes to the old stud size

creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:32:41 <@!434087698316263435> bruh why you downvote all my creations. are you one of those mfs who downvotes just for <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:43:34 hmm, i need an editing software for that but hell yeah. ill do it tomorrow. a block is 0.85 meters so i can count how many blocks the shockwave travels in a second and calculate if the shockwave is an accurate speed with the equation 0.85x = y

or <@!778226997427568662> could do it rn if he has the time
wait that equation might not be enough, gimme a second
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:47:23 damn bruh my brain working over time cause its almost 2 am and im only good at math around 3 hours after ive woken up
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:52:18 ok so if 1 block is 0.85 meters, and the speed of a real explosive shockwave is 340 meters per second, the plane crazy shockwave would need to travel 391 blocks per second to be accurate.
now to test it
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:55:13 i get 50-60 fps on max graphics. the human eye can see about 30-60 so it wont affect the results. also the length of the shockwave duration doesnt matter because i can see how long it did go in however long it lasted and see if its accurate
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:57:40 plane crazy r&d is really fun idk why. 
we should do this more and make 1:1 scale models for scaling. 

btw, do you think you could test it for me? just rq make a black and white checkerboard pattern the length of your plot, then place a plane crazy tnt block on it about 2 blocks away and detonate it while recording
creations-chat 2021-10-12 06:59:42 nah its too interesting to be private. see if the power and scale even effect the shockwave first. if it doesnt then just make it so it wont damage the checkerboard
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:02:08 if the tnt settings do effect the shockwave, im gonna have to calculate what settings are accurate to the real speed of sound
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:09:41 yeah but thats boring as fuck so using meters is harder and more fun.
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:14:13 i already said. its harder and therefore more fun. cry about it. also yeah we were gonna measure the speed of the shockwave. cry about it again.

<@723940197456281640> europeans when its a quarter pounder and not a 0.1133981 kilogrammer
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:16:43 cool. we still wanna measure it. idk why youre crying about us doing math and enjoying it. you need to cope hard if people enjoying something makes you uncomfortable
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:20:02 well first of all, you dont even understand what we’re doing, so that says a lot lmao. second, youre the one spending 10 minutes telling me this is ridiculous and unnecessary
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:22:31 hah aight so we got a lot more math to do. so could you do me a favor and make the measuring stick thing the length of the plot? it’s literally impossible to see the 2500 pressure wave. also im just gonna use capcut which only goes down to 0.1s
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:24:32 its very noticeably different. wait its not, its the same nvm again it is different 

<@!669343312326557716> aight will do
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:27:31 da google doc about video game speed of sound measurements
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:38:52 aight yeah theyre the same. imma calculate how fast it is now gimme a second
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:43:53 <@!720891502108344360> <@!669343312326557716> 
the shockwave moves at 40 blocks per second or 34 meters per second

the shockwave moves slower than my 2012 rav4 💀

the shockwave moved 12 blocks in 0.3 seconds which is 40 blocks per second. 34 meters per second is 76 mph 🗿
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:48:08 i honestly wish the blast pressure wouldve effected the shockwave. it wouldve been much more satisfying to calculate what blast pressure matched the speed of sound

<@!669343312326557716> its about 1327 sps
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:51:10 <@!720891502108344360> in game speed of the shockwave is 136 sps
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:54:26 aight cad, see if fireworks and rockets have a different shockwave. fly wants to see if they do
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 07:55:25 yeah that was an easter egg for plane crazy 2
creations-chat 2021-10-12 07:57:17 🗿

imma be honest im kinda sad how mundane that answer was 

“ok so i wonder if this virtual explosion matches the speed of the real speed of sound. of course we are going to measure it in ingame units and convert them to real life units”

“so it turns out the shockwave follows US interstate speed limits”
creations-chat 2021-10-12 08:07:54 i am genuinely saddened by this. we just spent 2 hours doing math all for it to culminate in a virtual explosion going 76 miles per hour <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-10-12 08:09:57 the sound barrier is either 76 mph or the explosion is magically subsonic 

at least it isnt rocket league where the speed of sound is literally 40 mph
creations-chat 2021-10-12 08:12:38 no we are crying about video game math

<@!720891502108344360> that means ive scored mach 3+ goals ☠️
creations-chat 2021-10-12 08:18:20 fuck it. im saying the explosion is sub sonic. theres more evidence that its subsonic than there is that the speed of sound is 76 mph. besides, a roblox speed of sound being 800 mph is nice bc its only 33 mph off the real speed of sound
creations-chat 2021-10-12 08:20:43 slow combustion <:empty:794431705070174238>

creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:44:51 heres what ive learnt in my time playing
motorlock =/= good
size =/= good
time spent =/= good
effort =/= good
experience =/= good (well a experienced player is more likely to be good but there isnt a direct correlation)
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 18:46:49 <@!698587744842022983> well yeah. but just because your build is massive, and has a ton of motorlock + took you a week to make doesnt mean its automatically good
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 18:47:55 ye
plane-crazy 2021-10-12 18:48:07 but in most cases it will be better

<@!761313821235085324> youll get there eventually. ground vehicles are much easier than planes. also it really is ass. theres just a major lack of detail for a build so massive
creations-chat 2021-10-12 18:54:14 yes. although functionality isnt my no. 1 priority. i strive for good looks and resemblance over all else

plane-crazy 2021-10-13 05:08:42 hello i am expert designer
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 05:08:54 you got any questions or wha
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 05:09:08 sure
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 05:09:31 that is literally the best tiger 1 ive ever seen.
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 05:10:01 ye homie was asking for any designer above tier 3 i think
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 05:12:39 imma do the same
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 05:12:41 wait
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 05:12:57 imma finish T-34 then pirate white tiger
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 05:14:32 it really pisses me off too because they payed for a replica to be built from scratch (that looks amazing btw) and then got impatient and used an IS-2 and filmed before the actual replica was done.
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 05:19:43 my abrams is dogshit at pvp. i didnt bother making it survivable so it gets shredded by guns and rockets.
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 05:20:11 also the tracks are a liability but sometimes its fun to shoot them back at ppl since they are 500 blocks a piece
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 05:20:23 makes sense

creations-chat 2021-10-13 05:31:45 uh……
what about the speed of the pvp weapons? like how fast bullets, rockets, and fireworks travel?
creations-chat 2021-10-13 05:34:26 bullets = barbie scooter speed
rockets = low end RC helicopter
firework = baby
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 05:37:09 can someone send me a picture of a normal motorlock tower?

plane-crazy 2021-10-13 05:40:01 
plane-crazy 2021-10-13 05:41:56 wdym
creations-chat 2021-10-13 05:44:48 since the bullets are literally longer than the ruler, could you make the ruler longer and move the camera up? ill get calculating on the other 2
creations-chat 2021-10-13 05:52:47 rocket = 71 mph (21 blocks in 0.2 seconds = 105 blocks a second. 1 block is about a foot long.)

firework = 109 mph (16 blocks in 0.1 seconds = 160 blocks a second

<@!707133341454958604> so basically, we tested the speed of a tnt block shockwave. a explosion goes the speed of sound. using the ruler you see in cads last two videos. i determined the shockwave moves at 111 fps or 76 mph

(the actual in game speed of sound is about 15 mph faster than the real speed of sound, but we just want to make fun of the roblox explosion effect)
creations-chat 2021-10-13 05:55:05 <@!720891502108344360> how long is that ruler for the gun?
how long is a plot 💀
creations-chat 2021-10-13 06:00:11 ok so imma be generous and say thats a tracer and the actual bullet is a block long. if thats true, than the bullet moves at 50 blocks per 0.1 seconds, or 500 blocks per second. 
500 fps is 340 mph or mach .44 <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-10-13 06:05:43 yeah bro this is a waste if time. its not even fun like what me an amperson were doing.

creations-chat 2021-11-04 16:51:16 lemme see your friends. im curious 

<@!486229249037041664> it got a ton of dv because it has god awful proportions. wings are too thin, cockpit is too tall, vertical stabilizer is the wrong shape, and the horizontal stabilizers are the wrong shape and not angled enough. rest is good tho 💀👍

plane-crazy 2021-11-06 08:26:26 he said 75% so its around 90% now
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 08:26:35 Hey @everyone ,

We've noticed that people are wondering about progress on the rewrite of the game, and I wanted to provide an update to reaffirm that we're still working hard on the game. I'm sure you're aware that I was looking for development help some time ago, and I want to share what the team has accomplished so far.

One of the major points of concern was softcoding the game, since the current game is hardcoded and makes it difficult to add new updates/content. We've been reviewing tens of thousands of lines of code in the game and reworking them, and we're nearing 75% completion of the code rewrite. Alongside this, there are several optimization changes that are being integrated - for example, load times for creations are significantly reduced. A 1.5k block creation in the current game can take between 5 to 20 seconds to load in depending on how stressed the server is, but after rewriting we've gotten it down to about 0.3 seconds! This combined with other network bandwith, clientside, and serverside optimizations will drastically decrease lag in the rewrite.

A few of the other WIP things that I know you're eager to hear about:
- We hired a big group of modelers to help redesign and optimize a new infinite map + current block models (little leak: ||https://imgur.com/a/kQagpi7|| :)) 
- More building block options (a frequent suggestion was a resize tool, and that's being worked on with the new build GUI!)
- A new in-game moderation system!

There are plenty of other things that we've worked on that will be included in the final rewrite, ranging from content changes to quality-of-life changes, but we don't want to rush this and risk delivering a bad experience. Your patience in the meantime is appreciated, and I hope you're as excited as we are for the final product!

Thank you.
plane-crazy 2021-11-06 08:26:58 no lo

plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:00:10 i love your fat little skyhawk
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:01:35 yeah??
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:01:57 ita your build isnt it?
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:02:34 ok so the hull is gona be small. good thing it’s relatively bare
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:03:31 the tank is a m113 hull with that turret rightt
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:06:24 <@456226577798135808> the hull aight too bad. the m113 and specifically that armor package make it extremely easy. just 1 angle locks pretty much thats it
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:06:31 tbh the turret seems harder to build lo
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:09:26 doesnt look too bad i must say. but why all the exposed lock?
plane-crazy 2021-11-07 10:11:07 if you ask me it seems a little overlocked
creations-chat 2021-11-07 10:14:15 he dvs most stuff then says shit like “i dont gotta give feedback on everything”

plane-crazy 2021-11-08 19:51:29 idc leme see da pencil
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 19:52:34 you click lock and toggle on the piston
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 19:52:40 then when you hit the keybind for it
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 19:52:45 it extends like a normal piston
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 19:52:46 but
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 19:52:57 after like 4 seconds it locks and becomes solid
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 19:53:10 allowing you to motorlock it into stuff and itt not bug out like a normal piston
plane-crazy 2021-11-08 19:53:46 maybe

leave it be if you cant handle his criticism
creations-chat 2021-11-09 21:36:20 good constructive criticism isnt hate. if you seriously took that as him hating you have some issues bro
also <@!719168864705052802> you shouldnt use your skill level as a reason someone else should be better. especially considering your 10x better than them

creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:29:20 <@!749835829039464549> delete that shit from creations its disrespectful

also 👇

veterans day is for vets and active service members, memorial day is for all those who died to protect our country
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:31:23 that doesnt take away from the fact that its disrespectful
maybe thats the reason there arent any others <:OkBuddy:652567204453154816>
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 00:32:12 nice intakes
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 00:32:40 wow it looks terrible
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 00:32:52 how long did that take? 30 seconds?
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:35:01 right but still delete the fucking "tomb"
none of the shit youre saying takes away from how fucking disrespectful it is to post such a shitty version of it.
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:39:34 why are you being so shitty about it?
1: its the wrong holiday
2: its looks like shit and is extremely inaccurate
3: its extremely disrespectful to all those who died and couldnt be identified
if you respected the unknown soldiers at all youd remove it
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:41:41 its not just a box, dumbass
<@!749835829039464549> it started that way then memorial day was created so now its just for veterans. you are extremely smart
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:44:43 basically The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is a monument constructed to honor all the American soldiers who died and could not be identified.

<@!749835829039464549> ok cool the build still fucking sucks and should be redone. until then its still incredibly disrespectful
<@!721103577380159490> yes.
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:47:05 exactly, but it adds so much more insult when the build isnt even good. 
the fact that its a memorial for my fellow Americans sacrifice makes it highly offensive to me.
also
<@!749835829039464549> thank you for taking it down.
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:49:28 Exactly.
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:51:50 average day anywhere when someone pulls some shit like that and im around
creations-chat 2021-11-12 01:07:00 its pretty disrespectful. are we supposed to ignore those who died for our country just because we dont know who they are? no. hence the memorial. we have memorials for all service members known or unknown

plane-crazy 2021-11-12 20:53:07 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 20:53:13 but takes less space
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 20:54:45 disconectors need to be on the outside of the tower while springs/tnt can be on the inside, thus saving space
plane-crazy 2021-11-12 20:54:53 especially handy for small builds like this

plane-crazy 2021-11-12 22:39:49 theres like 4 piston locks and 2 towers that contribute to the nose and i literally cannot make it better without exposed pistons

plane-crazy 2021-11-14 06:27:32 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2021-11-14 06:29:13 the front is quite good but the rest is just kinda, eh
creations-chat 2021-11-14 06:34:40 yeah i know the limitations of 3 block wide cars but you really could do better

the back is just, 🤢
no exhausts or license plate

the front could be better. the grill and vents are set too far back. also theres no wing (i just noticed jt but its way too small)

the sides are shit but thats pretty much unavoidable on 3wide cars. if i were you i would put fenders tho
creations-chat 2021-11-14 06:36:54 yes. if you can make that front you can make good fenders
also add side mirrors

the exhaust can just be circle/square emojis i forgor what shape they are

license plate is just a 1x1 sign 💀
or hell, a black square emoji would work
creations-chat 2021-11-14 06:41:27 car is p good imo, the pillars are ass
creations-chat 2021-11-14 06:43:42 because it will make a acceptable mini car into a incredible one
creations-chat 2021-11-14 06:45:54 make it thicker. its pretty large on the real car
also would you like to take this to dms? this slow mode is killing me

<@!498937968015441941> wasnt talking to you 🗿🗿
creations-chat 2021-11-14 06:49:12 piston lock another wing panel onto the bottom of it and use a medium black square emoji for the license plate
creations-chat 2021-11-14 06:51:14 damn you are lazy. why you gotta ruin a build with so much potential?
creations-chat 2021-11-14 06:54:30 hi this is my 3 wide ecto. i think i have some stance when it comes to mini cars

creations-chat 2021-11-14 08:40:35 idk how many times i gotta say this
nolock was good and no one can tell me otherwise

<@!761471985673961472> thats in hof because its really good :|
creations-chat 2021-11-14 08:43:07 it should be 150

<@!720751430595772418> nah ships was impossible to win for average plyers because boat builders are just…built extremely different

nolock was good because literally everyone could participate

nice puma
creations-chat 2021-11-14 19:25:31 bruh i simply cannot make an interior. its nothing more than a skill issue and i refuse to remake the entire fucking heli lmao
also what awesomegamer said
creations-chat 2021-11-14 19:31:32 wing panels and evenly spaced prop engines

<@456226577798135808> the interior is just a bunch of motorlock and engines 💀 

<@!798181566370545744> builds dont need interiors but its not a waste of time since its just more detail
creations-chat 2021-11-14 19:34:07 fake rotors and a bunch of small prop engines on the inside 

<@!798181566370545744> maybe until you get better. post your builds here for tips and shit idk

<@!725358947904651335> why are you being so toxic bro what even happened? are you salty bc you didn't know what a pave hawk is or what
creations-chat 2021-11-14 19:36:55 its just e and q for thrust. the rotor doesnt provide lift

<@!725358947904651335> oh ok youre just an asshole understandable
creations-chat 2021-11-14 19:39:15 yes
creations-chat 2021-11-14 19:44:43 y

creations-chat 2021-11-14 19:49:37 idk lemme see the inside

<@456226577798135808> aight
creations-chat 2021-11-14 19:53:49 oh well thats 1 wide so its pretty much impossible to balance perfectly. but maybe try putting with panels in the wings. also its probably the torque from the rotor, soo offset the weight to negate that

creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:39:57 the germans revolutionized rockets and as i said, invented space travel
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:42:41 the saturn v was designed by wernher von braun, the same guy who designed the v2 rocket 💀
read this about operation paperclip ffs

<@723940197456281640> the ho-229 flew a few times and crashed. i saw the cockpit in person a few years ago
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:45:29 i used him as an example. operation paperclip was over 1500 german scientists
bro pls stfu you sound so stupid
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:47:40 fun fact, i learned all this shit from a tour in huntsville alabama. sick city lots of nasa stuff look it up
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:51:14 at the usaf museum in dayton ohio (where i took the pics below) there are several real cockpits that you can climb into. its sick. i went into a b-29, f-104, and v22 i think

im going back for the 6th time in a few weeks <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:53:41 they have 1 or more of every kind of plane used by the us, and most produced german ww2 planes and quite a few soviet things


<@530364247646011402> first of all, a german designed the saturn 5, and due to operation paperclip, german scientists are the reason humans landed on the moon

second of all, ballistic missiles are nuclear
shut up dumbass
creations-chat 2021-11-16 08:58:04 i didnt get warned last time i posted pics of these pricless historical artifacts that **i** took

<@!721103577380159490> american intelligence operation where 1600+ ww2 german scientists were shipped to the US and basically used to get to the moon

creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:01:19 i swear youre european specifically bosnian
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:03:32 yes its overrated as hell but its also cool as fuck
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:11:28 its not too bad tbh. i believe accuracy is within 3 feet of a target, and with 70 30mm rounds youre bound to get fucked
also 300 is pretty impressive considering its such a specialized plane

<@!722343179994529903> nerd
creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:15:06 nah current tanks too. the depleted uranium rounds can penetrate any tanks roof. 
also correction on the accuracy: its 80% within a 40 foot radius so you have a chance to survive 
<@!722343179994529903> im a military nerd as well but i dont get pissy when someone doesnt like some plane ive never even seen in person 💀

creations-chat 2021-11-18 08:27:57 the f-35 has been in service for years and the A-10 is still going strong. idk what youre talking about

creations-chat 2021-11-19 21:41:08 idk how many fucking times i need to say this
i dont WANT to hide it
if i do hide them, which i have before, the heli doesnt roll when i turn and it makes it feel really robotic and less responsive. cope
also if i add extra props to roll when they are hidden its too much and the heli flips or cant make small adjustments

creations-chat 2021-11-28 06:01:46 yeah you can motorlock, right?

then motorlock delta wings on the edge
creations-chat 2021-11-28 06:03:49 its massive, disgusting color, awful design, ugly in general, low skill, and unimpressive as well. honestly just a massive skill issue. 
what to do better: get good at the game.
creations-chat 2021-11-28 06:06:34 yeah its not hard to put deltas in that at all
yeah it will still make it look 10x better

<@!765318482753224704> lazy, doesnt matter tho since its just to explain what he was talking about, not showcase the build. calm down
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 06:07:23 ye

2: how is that low effort 💀
3: you left out the part where it got more upvotes than any of your builds
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 07:43:01 what hapen
creations-chat 2021-11-28 07:44:13 🇺🇸🇺🇸 damn right 🇺🇸🇺🇸

<@!441939688018935818> help idk wtf is going on
creations-chat 2021-11-28 07:46:17 Talk about low intensity arguments, no yelling or offensive language. Heh, I’m outta here!
creations-chat 2021-11-28 07:48:51 upvoted because really good build, downvoted because i fr hate the design and also colors are kinda fard
almost never use default black and white. my go-to colors for black and white are 35-35-35 and 225-225-225
creations-chat 2021-11-28 07:50:53 i see. ill remov donevotir then becaus personal opinion on the source material shouldnt be part of how someone judges a build
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 07:52:33 oh ok carry on
creations-chat 2021-11-28 07:59:04 hes talking about the hovercraft <:empty:794431705070174238>

what part of a plane is called a fucking air skirt
creations-chat 2021-11-28 08:01:10 also stop using size as an excuse for your builds having extreme inaccuracies. its really not hard to use the right fucking wing panels regardless of size. also those engines 🤮
creations-chat 2021-11-28 08:03:57 quite nice
creations-chat 2021-11-28 08:06:19 btw, weep has an f-15 thats the same size or smaller that looks 10x better than yours 
you really, really need to find a new excuse other than “its smal!!”
creations-chat 2021-11-28 08:08:31 
creations-chat 2021-11-28 08:17:50 better node shaping, accurately sized intakes, good elevators, accurately placed nozzles, and the engines dont suck
creations-chat 2021-11-28 08:26:10 that is significantly less fard than your recent one. also 44 isnt high, thats low medium
creations-chat 2021-11-28 08:29:09 absolutely incredible, genuinely amazing
creations-chat 2021-11-28 08:32:44 high is 90+

creations-chat 2021-11-28 08:45:50 i will say that he sucks but there are high status people (2+ expert roles, masters, inventors, etc)
creations-chat 2021-11-28 08:47:55 <@760595454105878529> Watch your language.
creations-chat 2021-11-28 08:50:46 i dont consider singular experts high status. high rank, yes, status, no. mainly because pretty new players can get experts but still not be respected like experienced ones.
plane-crazy 2021-11-28 08:52:10 i have a meme about this
creations-chat 2021-11-28 08:54:49 i feel like the respect comes from the player themself, not just the rank. like how you can be the most loved TF2 streamer ever and not have every achievement
creations-chat 2021-11-28 08:56:51 <@!603974932585644043> stop these fucking fucking clowns

creations-chat 2021-11-30 06:50:01 how do the engines get air
creations-chat 2021-11-30 06:52:08 its a custom jet, not some fictional type of aircraft. jet engines need air. if it was a custom rocket plane, it wouldnt matter
creations-chat 2021-11-30 06:54:50 yes but they dont need intakes like jet engines do.

<@!765318482753224704> that sounds exactly like something someone who sucks at realism would say
creations-chat 2021-11-30 06:57:01 rocket engines use pure fuel burning for thrust, jet engines mix air with fuel and burn
creations-chat 2021-11-30 06:59:19 to look good <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-11-30 07:01:22 a fictional jet that looks like it literally wouldnt be able to function if it were real looks bad and extremely weird
creations-chat 2021-11-30 07:06:14 <@!765318482753224704> a build can be good and unrealistic (space cruisers, sci-fi vehicles, etc.) but the reason that jet is getting shit on is because its custom. when a build is a custom design, every design element is perceived as intentional. thus, the dude intentionally neglected to put intakes on it, making it either not a jet, or one that couldnt fly
creations-chat 2021-11-30 07:11:10 how the hell do you have expert. i have yet to see a good build from you

creations-chat 2021-12-03 21:52:27 <@431881268775616513>  the roof rack, fins, and windows <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2021-12-03 21:54:46 also the symbols <:nooo:787097964946259978> 

you couldve done way better
creations-chat 2021-12-03 21:59:07 cylinders are way too big for the canisters, use sparklers

motorlock the fins downwards

🚫 would look better for the logos, you could even motorlock a 👻 into it

more side detail

the rear wheels are clipping and dont even have rims

front light bar is floating

light bars could be better in general, the gray is too wide

the rear window framing is too wide

the gray things on the back need to be motorlocked downwards along with the fins

thats all i can think of for now
creations-chat 2021-12-03 22:05:12 <@738064035135750224> your ecto looks pretty messy in a lot of places, also the front could be way better

rest is p goo <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096> 👍
creations-chat 2021-12-03 22:07:42 mainly the doors also random floating half balls

also the roof rack is too wide.

doors are too thin as well


ye my ecto is 3 wide so i couldnt do much, probably could improve the roof tbh
creations-chat 2021-12-03 22:09:51 also, the logos are too high and for some reason the doors dont have windows. fix all that stuff i mentioned you will have extra-pro ecto

general 2021-12-06 07:03:18 do they expire like warns? it goes 3d, 14d, perm(appeal), perm

could it go 3d, 14d, wait a bit and they expire, then back to 3d?
general 2021-12-06 07:04:30 ok so if someone has a 3d ban, they can never get a 3d ban again? only 14d+?

creations-chat 2021-12-07 05:24:12 im gonna assume the first two are a joke cause i cant find what youre referring to, but yeah the headlights are pretty bad
about the looking nothing like the original, thats opinion so i can argue with that
creations-chat 2021-12-07 05:28:22 understandable on the headlights, only good design i could think of would make it look like im copying a friend of mine. but whats wrong with the light bars? i think they look pretty decent for having such little space to work with. also what do you mean by texture job?

creations-chat 2021-12-10 08:44:01 angle lock isnt toggleable motorlock 💀
creations-chat 2021-12-10 08:46:10 yes, but its not toggable motorlock lmao. its when you rotate a locked and powered motor then lock it into something *using* toggleable motorlock. smh doesnt know proper obscure video game terminology
creations-chat 2021-12-10 08:48:36 yes its always been 2 things. of course angle lock cant work without toggleable lock but that doesnt mean they are the same thing

creations-chat 2021-12-10 19:57:59 wtf is wrong with the cheeks
oh wait is it a PL?
creations-chat 2021-12-10 20:00:12 ok looks good but needs more detail on the hull and also make the bit where the cheek armor ends and meets the side composite more smooth

<@!683847069890510887> fuck you want
creations-chat 2021-12-10 20:02:53 ok and another thing, the fenders are too thin and the front plates are too wide. easy fix
creations-chat 2021-12-10 20:06:41 actually the whole tank looks like it has a messed up aspect ratio. hull needs to be wider, turret too. i would just widen the side composite on the turret by a half block on each side, then widen the hull by 1 block. also the mantlet is too thin and the cutout for the sights is too wide.
creations-chat 2021-12-10 20:16:05 helo har, can i have some feedback on this rear window and front (so far) for my ecto?

plane-crazy 2021-12-12 09:51:07 because tbh the only thing i can think of that would work (angle locking a half wedge) would be copying <@!748315167460425788> too much
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 09:52:20 what can i angle tho
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 09:52:27 that isnt a half wedge

plane-crazy 2021-12-12 10:19:25 especially when all the people saying the build is bad are extremely skilled and experienced tank builders
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 10:20:20 its pretty bad
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 10:20:30 the detail isnt the only issue
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 10:21:11 its awful
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 10:21:56 wait
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 10:22:08 is it bismark or bismarck
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 10:23:40 its ok to think your build is good but its really fucking annoying when you cry and shit yourself when people disagree. you seriously sound like a 10 year old
plane-crazy 2021-12-12 10:24:24 make the tank better and learn to take criticism first

creations-chat 2021-12-12 21:59:30 when talking about a video game, where you build stuff, your builds most certainly show your skill level. also i do give feedback but only to people who arent irreversibly bad like you <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2021-12-12 22:02:00 i agree putting effort into builds is a good thing, but when they suck, they suck.

creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:38:18 i was bullied when i was new. i didnt leave because im not a little kid or overly sensitive 😎
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:41:37 i saw all the talented builders and immediately got pissed that i was bad and there were so many people that were better than me and decided to go from shitty 25 block planes to stuff like my t-72 and ecto.

i didnt care about the douchebags, i only cared about thinning out the percentage of people who were better than me 😎
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:44:12 getting pissed helps me do stuff really quickly and well. its strange. btw i started playing plane crazy only about 4 months ago

creations-chat 2021-12-15 05:23:14 <@753399511061233694> 1063 sps is 724 mph 💀💀
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 05:24:03 skill issue
creations-chat 2021-12-15 05:27:45 robloxians are 5 studs tall and 5.5 feet tall. a stud is just barely under 1 foot in length. sps nearly directly translates to fps
creations-chat 2021-12-15 05:30:11 also your math is hella wrong. all you did was multiply a stud length (0.28 METERS) by the sps and called it miles per hour even tho thats meters per second. 297 meters per second is 664.37 mph.
creations-chat 2021-12-15 05:32:33 1 stud = 11 inches. just use fps and youre pretty much right
creations-chat 2021-12-15 05:53:29 about 85

<@!404632014189494293> 🥶
creations-chat 2021-12-15 05:56:39 1 stud = 11 inches. sps is essentially fps. 60 mph to fps is 88. i guesstimated it to be about 85 sps
creations-chat 2021-12-15 06:05:16 with super speed you run at 68 mph or about 109 kmh 😎

creations-chat 2021-12-22 09:52:17 real talk: theres no decals and the engines are way too high. everything else is good. 
not your best plane tbh
creations-chat 2021-12-22 09:55:30 the best way to upgrade the engines is piston lock them down then angle the back of the plane
creations-chat 2021-12-22 10:03:09 yep
the angle of the spine continues but only like 75% as steep
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 10:31:54 <@456226577798135808> hi i need advice

plane-crazy 2021-12-22 10:44:21 oke sick
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 10:44:36 heres the thing
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 10:45:01 it just kinda looks bad because the turret needs a shit ton of locking
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 10:45:04 and thats it
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 10:45:26 idk if im too lazy, too tired, or if i dont have motivation

plane-crazy 2021-12-22 10:48:12 hey can you do me a favor
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 10:48:20 quick test
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 10:48:24 since i cant get on
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 10:49:14 lemme draw a quick diagram to demonstrate
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 10:57:00 ok i had to do this with ny figer so its bad
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 10:57:45 blue = 1x2 half wedges
red = 1 block gap
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 10:57:52 can you see how this looks for me?
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 10:59:28 oh and then can you mirror it but instead of it being a 1 block gap have it be a 0.5 on the y axis?
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 11:00:29 minecraft roof
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 11:01:06 ye
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 11:01:10 its a top view
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 11:01:17 also wdym rotation state
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 11:02:01 uh
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 11:02:21 upwards
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 11:03:24 so
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 11:03:49 remove the wedges directly connected to the red block then angle lock the third wedge
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 11:05:14 delete these, then use motorlock to angle lock a single half wedge in their place
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 11:05:34 <@774696277669314602> Watch your language.
plane-crazy 2021-12-22 11:06:53 mb i just realized how fucking stupid that diagram was

creations-chat 2021-12-23 03:46:58 oh angle lock
creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:18:18 its, realistic. tanks carry spare parts. 
also tanks are literally supposed to be detailed. 

also, designer 4 💀
creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:20:37 that’s literally 1 roadwheel. wdym “that many”
whats with all the low ranks crying about it being detailed
creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:24:24 smooth tanks just simply look bad.

<@!798957190399524865> low rank = skill issue/low experience/both
and yes theres such thing as overdetailing, on planes. you seriously cant over detail a tank because i guarantee theres an armor package that looks like it
creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:26:49 thats cause it’s usually inside the tank/on the turret. but my interior is already cramped and tbh bare sides look ugly
creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:30:01 wait, you build planes, of course you dont want extra detail lmao
creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:32:38 all the detail with planes is in the shaping
for tanks its in equipment and accessories + interior 

<@456226577798135808> yeah but its dumb criticism ngl
creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:35:02 exactly. 

<@456226577798135808> so why dont you build a tank with no detail and see how shit it looks <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

<@!660019099430289418> ye
creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:37:36 **BAD BUILDS ALERT**

creations-chat 2021-12-26 00:17:26 State trooper pulled me over after he tagged me going 115 mph past the weigh station as I was hauling 12,000 lbs of steel beams. I roll down the window & he asks me, "Sir, is this the Dodge Ram that won 4 JD Power & Associate awards and is 2019s motor trend truck of the year!?" I said, "Yes sir, plus it also has a 5 star safety rating & is the most fuel efficient truck in America." He let me off the hook & immediately sped off to his local Dodge dealer to buy a Dodge Ram during RAM TRUCK MONTH so he could get $1,000 cash back! #BlueLivesMatter

creations-chat 2021-12-30 12:32:51 hi you good?
creations-chat 2021-12-30 12:36:39 oh np and thanks
creations-chat 2021-12-30 12:46:41 ok so i can explain half of these things

1: on a reference inage i have all the mirrors are grey which i personally find less bland than just alllll tan (image 1)

2: the bumper is on it its just hard to see because its black which is realistically colored (image 3)

3: that “exposed motor” is a sparkler which is supposed to represent the thing in image 2 but it was either too tall or too short without a piston lock that would be visible inside the wheel well

4: the orange lights are as good as possible without a shit ton of piston locking.

5: the “grill” is a brush guard but ig i can remove it

6: the windows on the mantlet is overly difficult simply due to limited space but ill see what i can do.

rest is good advice thank you

ngl i kinda forgot a lot of stuff now that i think about it oops

also wtf is happening
or happened idk
creations-chat 2021-12-31 10:57:37 yeah but the difference is usually its new/different builds that have the 14th markings as apposed to the exact same thing over and over
creations-chat 2021-12-31 11:01:21 its the build and then a plane crazy remake of this. 🧠 

https://youtu.be/Qe1Evnwu_Wo
creations-chat 2021-12-31 11:04:55 yeah but heres the thing. like i said the video is a meme not a showcase of the build unlike the first post so you cant really say its a blatant repost lol. i understand where youre coming from tho.
creations-chat 2021-12-31 11:06:58 bruh are you not reading my messages or smth? maybe watch the fucking video and youll see why your argument sucks
creations-chat 2021-12-31 11:09:00 <@!723940197456281640> also whyd you delete all your posts in creations? i wanted to look at the mini-morgan <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2021-12-31 11:11:30 ???

creations-chat 2021-12-31 11:13:34 but i really like his mrogoan and fat-15 😔
creations-chat 2021-12-31 11:18:09 also yeah bruh this isnt an argument just a friendly discussion since im pretty sure we’re all friends 

<@!723940197456281640> makes sense but my two 14th posts broke my upvote record one after another <:trollface:775024642104229898>

these people are fucking stupid. they cant see anything about the build past color and markings so they assume everything in 14th colors is just a repost of another build 💀
creations-chat 2022-01-01 06:17:09 it was posted at 11:54 for me so its not the first build of the year for me 🤩

creations-chat 2022-01-01 14:22:48 its very rare to find a unpainted military vehicle used by police. even then the paint color is really wrong which is something you definitely can “control” unlike your skill.

creations-chat 2022-01-02 10:44:18 most of the tanks in 14th that arent custom are like 1.1:1 (due to the uncontrollable limitations of plane crazy)
my humvee before the m1151 mod was exactly 1:1 but idk the scale now.

creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:48:24 *obvious joke message (really easy to tell because it makes no sense) not directed at you*
you completely miss the joke and say “its an easy thing to fix”
i make fun of you because its funny

creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:29:27 blueprints arent everything <:empty:794431705070174238>
there are multiple things you need to get right
detail
shaping
paint
sometimes size but thats rare
creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:31:34 blueprints dont show fine detail and paint accuracy also your overlays are rarely accurate iirc (could be wrong)

also blueprint overlays are really only effective on planes
creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:34:15 hence why its bad to use as your only feedback tool 💀
creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:37:17 yeah not trynna sound mean but if you dont care about detail, thats why most of your builds look mediocre. detail is just as important as proportions
creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:41:39 if your plane looks good on the inside, that doesnt mean it automatically looks good on the outside
creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:44:55 why
its not hard just tedious. motorlock delta wing panels inside themselves for the wing camo, use singular motorlocks for the fuselage, then paint the angled parts that would be too hard to put camo on

creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:36:59 expert designer which most of the time doesnt require a whole lot of skill <:FineTroll:626841259746656289> 

<@!799335319945085018> yes it is. some of the shittiest builds ever get upvoted if its big and not painted badly. also whyd you bring up vtols, you dont have expert vtol 💀
same with terrain
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:41:03 expert designer is usually luck but once you get good you can consistently get over 90 upvotes
most people dont get consistently good until after they get expert designer tho 🗿
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:43:27 p much
shipwright and terrain are basically considered low ranks since theyre almost always so easy
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:45:37 yes but my skill level (with ground vehicles) is decently known so idc 🗿

creations-chat 2022-01-17 21:20:43 i think i have  an idea but it will be extremely difficult and also look like shit cause of the flags dimmensions (2.2x2.5)
creations-chat 2022-01-17 21:30:49 no glass looks like shit, i will add lynynrd skynyrd tho
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 21:38:36 i have to rebuild all this because i placed the piston in a way that it clips into the wheels 👍 👍
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 21:38:46 totally gonna sucvk
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 21:42:51 its called
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 21:43:03 i packed the pistons and lock-powered motors too close
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 21:44:32 the tower cant move a block because then the pistons get fucked
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 21:59:08 now i gotta fix the front wheels :(
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 22:00:36 id say average
plane-crazy 2022-01-17 22:00:45 or slightly above average

creations-chat 2022-01-17 22:54:57 💀
creations-chat 2022-01-17 22:57:23 so, either have a giant black strip the width of the car, or a tiny bit of orange on the wheel 
imma go with the least noticeable one

<@!791976765123592233> if only it was on the actual general lee
creations-chat 2022-01-17 23:08:50 eh good enough
creations-chat 2022-01-17 23:14:12 guh ok 

<@456226577798135808> fixed expos motr
creations-chat 2022-01-17 23:18:16 ok
creations-chat 2022-01-17 23:30:03 its possible but heres the issue, for me at least
it makes it more identifiable as a charger, and it hides some exposed motors, pistons, and gaps
also when i do make it smaller, it has a gap since i need to use angled disconnectors. piston locking wont work cause it will be extremely exposed

creations-chat 2022-02-02 02:24:47 lol no
with a bigger scale you can fit detail and other general shaping a lot easier, with smaller scale it gets much harder due to the extremely limited space, requiring lots of motor and piston lock
creations-chat 2022-02-02 02:27:01 ^^^
creations-chat 2022-02-02 02:29:22 well duh if you make a cardboard box is easy on both scales
but yeah in general id say both are equal effort wise

you dont need any requirements to have an opinion 💀
creations-chat 2022-02-03 20:04:42 people only downvote if the build is bad. its as simple as that
there are way more than 2-3 skilled players lol
creations-chat 2022-02-03 20:09:05 ok so youre coping rn. people downvote bad builds, upvote good ones, and ignore ok ones
dont think your opinion is how everyone thinks and votes are generally biased. if they were this would be a positive ratio 💀
creations-chat 2022-02-03 20:13:33 <:Nice:851152184568578078> 

<@!709400929178222711> lol yes im biased mhm (i upvote my friends builds unless they are really bad, and judge everyone elses fairly based on my opinion)
hars has incredibly high standards, which is allowed
votes arent biased unless you say the better you get, the more critical you get and therefore biased. no one here thinks "oh hes knew lets be nice" its more like "hes bad and new, L" or "hes good and new wow"
creations-chat 2022-02-03 20:16:36 thats how it is in literally every game to ever exist
new players are bad, you get better with experience

plane-crazy 2022-02-11 05:35:26 is figuring out how to make actual fenders that look good
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 05:35:43 because ngl thats the hardest part about building mini cars for me
plane-crazy 2022-02-11 05:35:48 idk about you
creations-chat 2022-02-11 05:41:52 
creations-chat 2022-02-11 05:44:11 no detail
colors are too vibrant
bad shaping
ugly interior 
generally very basic
creations-chat 2022-02-11 05:46:24 yes but specifically your plane <:lasses:848699048181628968>

plane-crazy 2022-02-11 05:55:38 the what
creations-chat 2022-02-11 06:02:20 my cars take around 4-5 days to make
if someone doesnt like them i cry so hard i herniate
creations-chat 2022-02-11 06:05:50 i feel dat
rn the only downvote on my quattro is from an aero rank 2 with the reason that its too small to fit enough detail
man even wants me to put the slight like 2 degree curve on the front 🗿
creations-chat 2022-02-11 06:08:27 the second on fr just doesnt exist. people who build like that and that much are always really supportive. and dont mention hars because hes way under his own standards
creations-chat 2022-02-11 06:10:29 thats not how i think at all
if someone has actual criticism that i can use to make my builds excellent i want to hear it. 
besides i have a bit of an inferiority complex so i dont like any of my builds <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096> 👍
creations-chat 2022-02-11 06:12:44 odd ive never experienced exactly that.

<@!660019099430289418> i wanna use my builds in public servers
plane-crazy 2022-02-12 09:58:57 fucking insNe
creations-chat 2022-02-12 09:59:56 too much work

<@!690727914521493504> feedback?
creations-chat 2022-02-12 10:04:05 ok i agree the first part you mentioned is bad but the hood isnt worth the trouble. my quattro has the angle and it took up almost all the build time to get to work right so i could keep all the detail of a normal flat hood and the angle was barely noticeable in the photos. also that would leave a shit ton of exposed motors and pistons.

im going to explode
creations-chat 2022-02-18 11:41:02 gimme a top view ill do an overlay
also what varient is it
creations-chat 2022-02-18 11:47:53 im just gonna assume it a 104c
creations-chat 2022-02-18 11:50:14 yeah its really bad ngl. i feel like it doesnt require a remake tho.
only issues are the intake length, overall length, wings, and the thickness of the engine area
also the intakes shouldnt angle in like that. they have a pretty sharp cutoff
creations-chat 2022-02-18 11:53:45 everything up until the intakes is fine bro just fix what doesnt line up. keep the fuselage and fix the other stuff
creations-chat 2022-02-18 11:56:30 nose is fine simply due to limitations, intakes really could be better, even if extended 0.5 but whatever. and how can you not fix the engine width?
creations-chat 2022-02-18 11:58:58 bro. finish it. even in this super disproportionate state its in its still one of the best 104s ive seen. i dont wanna see it abandoned
creations-chat 2022-02-18 12:01:41 yes do

creations-chat 2022-02-25 19:18:26 its still bad

no thats my actual opinion lmfao
creations-chat 2022-02-25 19:23:32 assuming its a plane
the top of the nose is too flat, has massive holes 
the side is inconsistent
the overall shape is a giant rectangle
and the wings are weirdly shaped

there are some other things i would mention but it seems to just be wip syndrome
creations-chat 2022-02-25 19:25:40 i know what the tb3 is
yours just has no resemblance
well besides the very front
creations-chat 2022-02-25 19:27:44 ok so is it a fucking tb3 or something based on a tb3 make up your mind before crying about people now knowing what it is
also i admit the wings are fine that just looked weird from the first angle
creations-chat 2022-02-25 19:30:06 so if its slightly based off the tb3 dont say it IS the tb3 
just say its custom ffs

also what could i use to make the ridges on the roof
creations-chat 2022-03-11 18:52:53 so youre essentially asking me to put details that would require piston lock in something thats too small for a motor tower 🗿
ill try to improve the roof and grill but theres nothing to do about the turret and also most of that stuff is represented

plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:37:30 theres maybe 10 actually good mini builders and the rest are shit
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:37:34 theres no middle ground
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:37:55 yea
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:38:15 i almost exclusively build mini and roscale shit
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:38:23 snow pipe

plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:40:03 motor lock is ass
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:40:11 people who use it are the worst
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:40:16 major skill issue havers
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:40:39 thats not my car
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:40:43 nor is it motorlock
creations-chat 2022-06-23 06:51:40 simply make it look good
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:57:28 the difficulty of mini builds makes the learning curve incredibly steep and most people cant or wont climb it which creates an ocean of shitty builds and also negative stereotypes for the actual good builders to deal with. on top of that a lot of mini builders are obnoxious assholes that think that because their preferred build scale is more difficult, their automatically better than everyone else.
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:58:39 yeah thats another thing
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:59:15 the challenge with mini builds comes from hiding locks and shit
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:59:28 yep
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:59:40 fr
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:00:05 99% of mini builds fall into two categories
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:00:29 no or very little exposed with shitty details and proportions or lots of exposed and good proportions
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:01:06 i can only think of maybe 6 people who are the 1% with minimal exposed and still good proportions and details
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:01:18 off the top of my head
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:02:12 show the t34
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:02:31 simply dont have exposed and youre good
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:02:34 no

plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:06:01 5 months ago that post wouldve had the upvotes and downvotes reversed or equal around 80-90
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:06:38 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:06:48 i used to think the same way
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:07:25 so i tried every genre and what i couldnt do or got bored of i researched till i was knowledgeable enough to know wack from crack(ed)
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:07:37 eas
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:07:56 personally i dont like making mechs
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:08:05 since i like making irl vehicles
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:08:24 yea
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:08:39 i only like mechs that are all mechanical and functional not just motors in blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:09:17 i think more functions creates a cool look (when done well)
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:09:19 opinion
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:09:52 on mechs, exposed lock and pistons and shit can make it look better than a regular motor only mech
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:10:15 especially on spider walkers
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:10:54 got a pic?
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:12:16 i see
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:13:09 neat
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:14:22 i cant do mechanisms i just make detail and thats it
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:14:27 👍
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:18:33 if only you could fit functionality into mini builds without the overall quality taking a dump <:fat:803333767946698762>

creations-chat 2022-06-23 07:45:44 what is that (if you say f-5 i will cry) 

<@849139320106516491> just because its custom doesnt mean it gets a free pass on looking bad. its way too short and because its wip you should be taking advice, not rejecting it

“oh shit ive gone too deep time to try and play it off like a joke haha”
creations-chat 2022-06-23 07:49:02 the pyramid wedge 😭

<@849139320106516491> i already said its too short which is advice. also adding “stuff” means detail which is mb but still. do it
creations-chat 2022-06-23 07:51:10 yeah replace the pyramid wedge by continuing the nose angle downwards 
dont do just 2 half wedges like a lot of people
creations-chat 2022-06-23 07:53:14 you never made a joke 💀
you made a legitimate statement that you realized was dumb and then said it was a joke minutes later after beinng called out for it
creations-chat 2022-06-23 07:55:32 yeah do a compact torp boat that can barely hold 2 torpedoes
creations-chat 2022-06-23 08:00:36 you said “mfs on their way to post bad builds in creations” or something like that and then angel called you out for also being bad and saying that then you argued for a few minutes and gave up and said it was a joke and that angel is in the wrong for “not having a sense of humor”
creations-chat 2022-06-23 08:03:14 his perception is warped by his ego considering he didnt see anything wrong with his carrier 💀
and he keeps trynna argue. i just wish there was an anti whitename system

creations-chat 2022-06-24 04:12:50 i know you like pop culture cars so a ‘77 trans am would be cool cause you can not only do Ban One, but with slight modifcations you could also make K.I.T.T.

on top of that its a mega sexy car
creations-chat 2022-06-24 04:15:50 how about a sort of wager: if the elvis movie sucks (which i doubt), do kitt first

creations-chat 2022-06-24 07:31:11 yeah its roscale because the roblox man is actually a video game character that doesn’t physically exist and therefore cannot be scaled to due to the lack of real measurements (for both considering peter griffin is a drawing) and proportions so technically the two can be any size in relation to eachother and still be considered roscale
plane-crazy 2022-06-24 07:44:07 what the fuck is that exposed

general 2022-06-24 11:56:10 not ffrom a 2.7mm
general 2022-06-24 11:57:36 when i was 7 i fell on a rock and my skull split in half like a coconut but my uncle rubbed some dirt in it and told me to walk it off
general 2022-06-24 11:57:41 i turned out ok
general 2022-06-24 11:59:26 bro you literally cannot die from a 2.7mm kolibri. even if it was shot directly into your brain, you would survive because of the not only tiny round, but the miniscule amount of energy it delivers into the surrounding tissue. youre more likely to die from lead poisoning than the initial wound. stop arguing about things you know nothing about
general 2022-06-24 11:59:38 you werent there

general 2022-06-24 12:08:57 best round
general 2022-06-24 12:09:43 ok but fr 9mm vs .45 acp
general 2022-06-24 12:10:11 yes but .45 can kill a dinosaur
general 2022-06-24 12:10:22 yes but .45 can kill a dinosaur

general 2022-06-24 12:37:36 you coulda just said 0.62 miles
general 2022-06-24 12:38:10 its a british invention, what did you expect
general 2022-06-24 12:39:41 more like everything was already designed around the imperial system so completely switching over to metric is impractical and unnecessary when the current 50/50 system works fine
general 2022-06-24 12:40:07 ip grabber
general 2022-06-24 12:40:23 just said
general 2022-06-24 12:41:06 the natives lost and thats how it is
general 2022-06-24 12:42:55 why does it matter. the only people that complain about the us still using imperial are the idiots that dont realize that the us uses metric too
general 2022-06-24 12:43:03 its not like the conversions are hard either
general 2022-06-24 12:43:26 AH
general 2022-06-24 12:45:07 because the population is so used to imperial and the school system (a genuine issue unlike how we figure distance 💀💀) hasnt gone under any significant changes since the 70s
general 2022-06-24 12:45:46 using both is better since you have more options to convey distance in an eyeball situation

general 2022-06-24 12:49:35 americans when they are so british that a tax on tea leads to a massive war

creations-chat 2022-06-29 19:44:05 even worse
the reason you use blueprints is because they arent affected by fov like real photos and 3d models
this is why your f-16 is ass rn
plane-crazy 2022-06-29 19:51:00 get good
creations-chat 2022-06-29 20:06:50 yes but using an overlay thats also affected by fov makes it worse

5: add doors or smth to mimic the doors
6: make the windshield completely vertical
creations-chat 2022-06-29 22:43:05 <@698587744842022983> what is that

creations-chat 2022-06-30 07:36:18 yeah its ace combat
creations-chat 2022-06-30 07:39:35 it just looks horrible. absolutely no resemblance.
my advice is just play the game more and watch guides and shit. in time youll get better.
the fact you openly asked for feedback indicates a healthy mindset towards criticism which will take you and your skill level to new heights. just stick with it man
creations-chat 2022-06-30 07:43:03 also your best friends for making planes is motor and camera lock. learn those two skills.
creations-chat 2022-06-30 07:46:22 theres not really such thing as too little motorlock. imo the issue is improper use which is why i suggested to develop the skill more

<@723940197456281640> make me
dont care, i love the pics

creations-chat 2022-06-30 08:11:12 be careful with customs. they are a hell of a slippery slope. make sure to base it on at least 3 real planes (wether it be the entire fuselage or a flap it doesn’t matter just do it) so it stays believable and doesnt turn out like this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/907487151447494767/920952747233271838/unknown-7.png

creations-chat 2022-07-01 05:54:11 same. rbk is directly responsible for the gigantic drop in quality as he cracked down on toxicity, allowing braindead whitenames to flourish and kill the server

plane-crazy 2022-07-03 18:34:44 ofc its american that plane is a fucking whale
creations-chat 2022-07-03 18:50:50 1 wide is only acceptable if you want a baby plane or if the actual dimensions call for it to be 1 wide
creations-chat 2022-07-03 18:56:12 actually that build sucks and i hate it
creations-chat 2022-07-03 18:59:19 pc players when you ask them to build a good 2 wide f-16
creations-chat 2022-07-03 19:02:32 bro six months was like january that doesnt mean anything in current pc 🗿

creations-chat 2022-07-03 19:08:12 sr and gloken single handedly raising those chances by 25%
creations-chat 2022-07-03 19:10:13 honestly i think the fact there are 15 amazing 2 wide planes for every 1 good 1 wide shows how much harder it is. noobies just cant handle the lazy style
creations-chat 2022-07-03 19:13:12 if being easier makes it superior then ok <:clueless:942802644043464734> 

besides, 3 wide cars will always reign supreme as the best type of build

creations-chat 2022-07-03 19:15:24 also the f-5, f-16, mig-15, possibly the f-18, and many more
creations-chat 2022-07-03 19:17:40 looks pretty 1 wide to me
creations-chat 2022-07-03 19:19:43 i thought you meant the car and i was like wtf
creations-chat 2022-07-03 19:21:45 yeah it gets wider but the initial part of the nose is 1 wide.
a proper roscale f-16 will transition from 1 wide to 2

plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:35:38 THIS is the 1988 LAMBORGHINI countach!
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:35:45 its called an intake
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:35:47 idoit
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:36:10 i like the effort but yeah its fat
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:36:20 do you know how cars work
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:36:57 metal thing get really hot from boom and need air to cool it
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:37:26 air go through radiator and cools down the collant
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:37:34 ice melt
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:37:37 idoiditip
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:38:11 thats what it is
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:38:15 its an intake
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:38:37 no it doesnt
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:39:36 at high speed, air compresses under cars and makes them lift, so fast cars are designed to minimize that which means theres very little air under the car when go fast. plus the air wont just get sucked into the radiator, it will just pass over
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:39:49 if you know literally nothing abt cars then stfu
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:40:39 incredibly inefficient
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:40:49 plus that would leave like no room for people in the car
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:41:08 exactly
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:41:13 so that would just make things worse
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:41:38 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:41:51 thats a joke right
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:41:52 ?
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:42:02 ok good
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:42:15 i know youre and idiot but damn that woulda been negative iq
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:42:19 good idea
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 23:42:37 when it starts melting it will get slippery-er like ice

creations-chat 2022-07-05 07:25:02 actually the supra kinda sucks (when stock, assuming its not a turbo trim). its legendary status comes from how easy the 2jz is to tune. there are 1200+ hp supras out there

creations-chat 2022-07-05 07:46:48 also comparing the supra to the a hellcat (i assume you mean challenger the hellcat) is like comparing apples and oranges. the supra is track oriented while the challenger hellcat (like all american cars) is for the qm

creations-chat 2022-07-09 03:13:34 it helps by alerting you to the issues. its not hard to figure how to fix problems, the difficulty is spotting them on your own builds due to bias
creations-chat 2022-07-09 03:15:36 quit victimizing yourself and get better
no one gives a shit abt "hard work" if it doesnt pay off. in both the real world and pcc
creations-chat 2022-07-09 03:18:07 THEN LEARN
google, reddit, youtube, and <#478584971670454284> exist <:BIG2:588443778554134540>

and yes you are victimizing yourself by saying "waah im made to feel like i suck waaah this community is so bad"
creations-chat 2022-07-09 03:21:04 this channel is shit*
creations-chat 2022-07-09 03:24:11 use more text, dont rely on cam locking so much, and fix your mindset
also watch guides and whatnot
creations-chat 2022-07-09 03:38:32 figure it out
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 03:39:37 ask rickje
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 03:39:43 hes the lazy mf that wont talk abt it
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 03:40:38 why cant he say anything abt it
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 03:40:50 he says he doesnt want to "overhype" the community
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 03:40:58 like wtf does that even mean
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 03:41:02 at least tell us status
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 03:41:12 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 03:41:21 also another layer of idiocy
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 03:41:42 not talking causes more hype since people dont know what to expect and speculate
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 03:41:49 thus causing a hype echochamber
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 03:49:10 no

creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:01:09 might be the quality but it doesnt look like it
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:07:59 this part
i cant see yours cause of the quality

<@564463541248065547> it sucks. lying doesnt help just as much as toxicity
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:10:13 people can have their own opinions and voice them 
thats the entire point of this channel, jackass
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:12:29 bro this is discord not kindergarten no one gives a fuck about other peoples feelings. especially not whiney childrens

"WAAH THIS PERSON SAID I WAS BAD ON THE INTERNET WAAAAAH WAAAAAH"
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:14:36 <@564463541248065547> take notes on this guy getting shit on
he doesnt cry and whine abt it
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:16:38 yes you certainly do. youre second hand crying for the dude with the dogshit forklift
quit acting like peoples mom its weird. this isnt a playground
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:18:58 thats kinda contradictory since you just said you dont play the game much

<@523003901075521536> exactly. we dont caudle feelings. 
<@564463541248065547> if you have a problem with no one babying the shitty noobs, leave. you bitching wont change it
and i did give him helpful feedback you just cant read
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:21:17 its not that hard to understand that "use more text" means use it as detail and instead of cameras 
he understood
you being a noob also doesnt help. dont give feedback if you suck too
plane-crazy 2022-07-09 04:21:57 imma do this with mine
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:23:47 youre treating him like a toddler. 
also no ones going to improve if the person helping is just as shit or worse than them
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:27:08 one of the best, if not the best skill to learn in life is how to cope. you cant live if you let literally ever smidge of negativity destroy your mood. now please shut the fuck up

also how the fuck is me saying his virtual forklift looks bad equivalent to starving him, shooting his children in front of him, and beating him half to death. that comparison is straight up disrespectful to the hundreds of thousands of real north koreans who are tortured to death by their own totalitarian government. please leave this server literally no one at all wants you and your horrible opinions here

creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:35:36 youre not really speechbubble material. just an insignificant asshole that pops up for a bit every now and again
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:39:12 asshole? yes
but nowhere near innactive or insignificant considering what ive been involved with in this community (specifically revolutionizing roscale cars, and re-popularizing mini builds in general)
if you arent in the loop, dont make comments on it please
creations-chat 2022-07-09 04:41:28 because i dont give a shit and neither should you. cyberbullying isnt a real thing.

creations-chat 2022-07-10 01:10:33 ogie i will
creations-chat 2022-07-10 02:33:42 no
make it green or use 128, 114, 98
also use a sparkler for the snorkel
creations-chat 2022-07-10 02:35:51 incredibly based humvee schemes
creations-chat 2022-07-10 02:38:00 humvees come from the factory green 💀
creations-chat 2022-07-10 02:40:03 whoda thunked that green is used for green environments and tan is used for tan environments
creations-chat 2022-07-10 02:43:26 m1151 (my favorite humvee variant) plus 3 tone CARC (my favorite camouflage scheme) = 😍
creations-chat 2022-07-10 02:45:57 1: its not racist to call tan skin color since white people exist
2: its still gay. its called tan 😡
creations-chat 2022-07-10 02:50:35 melon??? 

<@750066581874147389> actually yes
<@706717603258957864> base humvees are all made at one plant then go to rebuild facilities and whatnot for upgrade kits and whatever else
creations-chat 2022-07-10 02:52:42 haha funny 🗿
creations-chat 2022-07-10 02:55:52 technically that humvee is forest green, desaturated reddish brown, and black get it right idiot fartbrain
creations-chat 2022-07-10 02:57:59 ask tinon he knows im 12
creations-chat 2022-07-10 03:00:58 also the top humvee is an m1151a1 while the bottom is a normal m1151
creations-chat 2022-07-10 03:03:11 i know quite a few humvee facts and features
creations-chat 2022-07-10 03:07:15 yknow you could just call the bottom ones scheme NATO three tone camouflage CARC right?
creations-chat 2022-07-10 03:12:57 also it appears the bottom one has smoke launchers and an extended snorkel
creations-chat 2022-07-10 03:24:45 thats part of the a1 package which was already mentioned and the tires are the same.
creations-chat 2022-07-10 03:26:59 yeah also this is the most accurate and simple one https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/995528738685067274/20220709_221352.jpg

also how do you not know what a tie-down strap is 💀
creations-chat 2022-07-10 03:29:22 a tie down strap is a basic thing. its not specific to cars
creations-chat 2022-07-10 03:31:42 oh :(
plane-crazy 2022-07-10 04:18:33 <@466793357318815744> which specific submission got removed?
creations-chat 2022-07-10 04:50:55 <@821642310491570196> you can post copied builds also the front wheel wells suck
creations-chat 2022-07-10 04:54:05 they look big but not huge. proper roscale a-10s are like 1.5 wide 
(obv 1.5+ rounds up to 2)
creations-chat 2022-07-10 04:56:10 just like ur wee <:trollface:775024642104229898> <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-07-10 05:02:40 <@821642310491570196> been looking at the humvee more and the coloring is ass. the paint is too bright and certain parts are the wrong color in general
also the grill is abysmal
and finally its missing quite a bit of detail while also having inaccurate ones (like the turret ring on the roof despite the lack of a turret or any form of weapon)
creations-chat 2022-07-10 05:16:15 
creations-chat 2022-07-10 05:18:24 not my job to help people get good, just to tell them that they should <:clueless:942802644043464734>

creations-chat 2022-07-10 11:25:28 <@456226577798135808> really no other words to describe your steve other than lazy or lame

it doesnt move, theres none of the color variation or shading like on actual minecraft models, and its also minecraft so its just a bunch of prisms (no skill involved when making a rectangle)

there are just way, way better minecraft builds out there (mostly by frogman):

creations-chat 2022-07-10 23:41:57 why did you pick the shittiest 1 wide f-2 to compare?
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/758545164532056084/932637608301985802/unknown.png
(not to mention the f-16 is one wide irl)
creations-chat 2022-07-10 23:45:09 yes

obv it gets wider but the initial part of the nose is 1 wide. if you say it isnt you are fr lying
creations-chat 2022-07-10 23:47:31 "hurrr dur i hate mini planes because uhh hurr durr idk boxne said so!!"
creations-chat 2022-07-10 23:51:39 the majority think it looks bad because theyre either sucking up to a community figure or only care about the shitty public server builds or just dont understand how measurements, or different build genres work. obv everyone has an opinion, but dont shit on things you dont understand (also jets vary in size heavily  so some are 1 wide, some are 2, whatever) but quite a few fighters are 1 wide
creations-chat 2022-07-10 23:54:24 bad 1 wides*
on good ones you need to not only put disconnectors on the side but use a cylinder cockpit in order for the dimensions to not be goofy

youre adding details that arent there to make me look bad, as if im not already known for being a horrible person for other reasons

plane-crazy 2022-07-15 20:02:26 ok
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 20:03:02 its there for the roundness
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 20:03:17 since the f-18 has a flat spine than becomes round
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 20:03:27 but i cant rlly do that convincingly in pc
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 20:05:05 red is where its flat and blue is where it finishes transitioning into a really long half cone
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 20:05:38 not at 1 wide
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 20:05:39 nerd
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 20:06:05 best i can do is blend shit like signs, disconectors, wing panels, and trap doors to simulate it

plane-crazy 2022-07-15 20:08:01 or 50 pistons either
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 20:10:11 for what
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 20:10:25 that would look so goofy

plane-crazy 2022-07-15 20:58:33 the very essence of being a whitename can be boiled down to these two principles
plane-crazy 2022-07-15 20:58:50 1: lacks roles (most important)
2: is a complete fucking dumbass
creations-chat 2022-07-15 20:58:56 use angle locks instead of wedges on the fuselage and nose
also more detail other than goofy paint shading/camo thing

other than that its good

<@456226577798135808> im mostly making this for a cinematic sr and i are gonna make with the dcs music so elevators with functional pitch and roll is worth it (also i literally need the no collisions of the motors because of piston locking bc the intakes go from 2.5->2 wide

creations-chat 2022-07-16 09:34:47 “simple custom angle”
yes i enjoy having to squeeze a motorlock and angle lock in a 1x1 space for something entirely unnecessary 

also camera lock doesnt work because it either makes the wing too fat or too thin cope mald im not taking your shitass advice <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-07-16 09:37:22 not taking advice from you cause you suck.

creations-chat 2022-07-16 09:47:06 fr
main reason is that 1 wides rely on basic motor towers while 2+ wides can just have towers fucking everywhere since they dont have to rely on lock

creations-chat 2022-07-18 06:11:17 WHAT THE FUCK WHY ARE YOU SO BIGOTED 

<@900649045813493810> asked my friends for feedback on my plane
creations-chat 2022-07-18 06:14:05 what were you even trying to say
creations-chat 2022-07-18 06:16:08 idk because your grammar sucks
creations-chat 2022-07-18 06:25:05 you are mean @youlsuf
creations-chat 2022-07-18 07:05:52 damn
creations-chat 2022-07-18 07:30:12 no
creations-chat 2022-07-18 07:33:35 paint sucks, engines are way too big, the winglets suck (exposed motor), fuselage is stubby, the horizontal stabilizers are fucking awful, and the nose is too sharp.
creations-chat 2022-07-18 07:38:01 shading, use motorlock for more painted details (specifically on the letters)

make the stabilizers not super sharp and thin (they may be fine but the angle of the photos doesnt show them)
creations-chat 2022-07-18 07:40:04 nvm
rework the entire plane and learn advanced motorlock
creations-chat 2022-07-18 07:48:07 good that shit fucking sucks
creations-chat 2022-07-18 07:50:32 what the fuck do 2 other peoples opinions have to do with mine

creations-chat 2022-07-19 11:59:05 tried that. the issue you see with the nose is that the angle on top isnt steep enough not the tip.
i was lazy and didnt wanna rebuild the whole nose and in the process redesign the whole front half of the plane

creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:58:06 the iron cross is way older than than imperial germany  has less to do with the ww2 germans than the windmill (which is a hindu symbol anyway) 

boom nuff said
creations-chat 2022-07-20 19:00:12 saying the iron cross is bad or offensive is just a stupid as saying the st george ribbon is
creations-chat 2022-07-20 19:05:15 thats 💀

but i think the point theyre trying to make is that you should be blaming the high command not the (essentially) slave foot soldiers that did the dirty work under the implication that if they didnt they and their families would be executed or put in a camp 

thats not saying there werent supporters in the lower ranks but you do have to remember that the first people the party had to conquer were the germans themselves 

the other people are just horrible at arguing or even having discussions in general. ok im leaving before a mod murders us

creations-chat 2022-07-21 20:03:43 omg a canadian hi i love you

<@448677698773057547> bughatti is french, koensigball is scandinavian i think

<@685909594932773033> yes i know how they work im not a 12 year old who thinks hes smart cause he can identify famous cars <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-07-21 20:05:48 bughatti is overrated too
koen is the only car brand out of the 4 that deserves the praise

also ferarri is ass they sue you if you modify your car that you BOUGHT from them

lambo is just kinda lame they stopped being cool after the 2000s
creations-chat 2022-07-21 20:08:50 bughattis are fat and ugly and rely way too heavily on power since they focus more on luxury, which if fine but then they say their cars are super fast and dont really acknowledge the fact that the cars LITERALLY EXPLODE after going full speed for 5 minutes.

also n00bmaster is here, everyone leave for he is a bad omen
creations-chat 2022-07-21 20:11:28 there are test tracks (especially in the desert area of the US) that are many miles long

<@456226577798135808> yeah but i still think its way less impressive that your car can go 300+ if it cant hold it without exploding. thats why le mans is awesome because the cars need to be fast as shit but last 24 hours straight with minimal breaks
creations-chat 2022-07-21 20:14:29 your mom

<@456226577798135808> simply make tires that cant explode then. they sell cars that cost $2m they can afford to make good tires also yeah i wasnt specific le mans sucks now but it used to be way faster and cooler
creations-chat 2022-07-21 20:18:11 please use punctuation i fr cannot follow you

<@456226577798135808> maybe if the cars didnt weigh more than a dodge challenger they wouldnt need to worry so much abt adding more durable tires
thats what im trynna say. bughattis are fat and gay and if they put their awesome engines in something lighter it would be cool

also how is knowing this basic knowledge misinformed
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:02:45 oh you meant hermaphrodites. yeah ok sure but how many self proclaimed trans genders are real, physical, born that way, hermaphrodites and not people who **think** they are the wrong gender
also dms this is gone on long enough
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:06:49 says you, who thinks genders arent and absolute
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:13:01 i simply know my science and dont bend over backwards for the ones who dont <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:15:21 people arent gay or trans till puberty when they begin to understand their body and other peoples 
there is no such thing as a toddler who even knows what a boy or girl is besides one being cool and the other being gross
creations-chat 2022-07-22 02:17:23 i never said it was a choice
in most cases being exposed to harsh conditions that mentally damage you isnt a choice. a child cant chose to have the shit beat out of them by their parents

plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:01:44 or just a double delta in general
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:02:38 double delta with canards and 1 engine
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:02:41 very basef

plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:03:35 WAIT
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:03:39 i have a suggestion
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:04:01 yknow what would be cool
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:04:29 give it a delta with a swing wing
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:04:43 like the boeing 2707 concept
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:05:12 
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:05:31 
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:06:52 interceptors and specialized planes in general seem dumb
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:07:33 hm
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:07:33 oh
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:08:33 maybe
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:08:50 what type of plane is it?
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:08:57 i assume a fighter bomber
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:10:01 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:10:28 what about double swept wings
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:10:42 like on a lot of the century series fighters
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:11:43 oh hmm
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:12:17 yknow what would be cool
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:12:41 wings that are like on the english electric lightning
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:12:45 but
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:12:52 combined with a delta
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:13:43 so like its a regular delta but theres an extension towards the elevators
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:14:25 and the negative space between the extensions and airframe is where the elevators would fit
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:14:39 yeah kinda
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:14:55 hold on lemme see if i can draw what i mean
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:23:35 like this (red is the wing blue is the elevator)
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:23:44 obv you can adjust it so its less goofy
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:24:11 ye thats the point
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 06:24:46 very streamlined design with massive elevator for good maneuverability at super sonic and low speed

plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:36:32 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:36:44 the draken is still his best tho fr
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:37:18 i wanna learn 2 wides so that gay nerds will stop making fun of me for making baby planes
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:37:30 same
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:37:55 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:38:02 the regular yf-23 wouldve been a better chocie
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:38:23 bc the tomcat is gay
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:39:08 people who avoid overbuilt planes are based and pilled
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:39:47 true
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:39:50 but you suck so
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:39:51 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:39:52 ...
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:39:54 :tr:
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:40:19 malidng
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:40:32 going to become the best 1 wider just to spite you
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:41:02 2 widers are just so much easier
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:41:07 might be better for me
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:41:20 take longer, less bullshit and easier to detail
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:41:29 bc you dont gotta worry abt exposed lock
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:41:35 same
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:41:38 wasnt everyone
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:41:57 its still much easier to hide on larger planes
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:42:07 fr
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:42:10 cant deny that
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:42:27 because they are easier
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:42:28 nerd
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:42:51 take the potential of a 2 wide and make it thinner
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:42:52 me
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:42:53 ez
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:43:04 noses are impossible tho
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:43:08 on both types
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:43:16 every 2 wide uses the same nose
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:43:24 every 1 wide uses one of 2 noses
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:43:27 all 3 suck
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:44:04 find 1 2 wide plane that doesnt just use pyramid wedge + half wedge 1x2
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:44:21 i was thinking pyramid wedge or fully custom angled tip
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:44:25 like on my f-5
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:45:50 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:46:08 ok 1 wide vs 2 wide is a battlefield but i think both can agree that 3 wides are the best
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:46:41 3 wide f-16
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:46:43 lo
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:47:14 f-14s can actually look good when 1 wide unlike most planes
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:47:18 2 wide sucks
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:47:21 3 wide is good
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:47:24 same
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:47:27 they are always mid
plane-crazy 2022-07-22 23:47:54 one dude found a good formula and now every 2 wide tomcat is just

the-dump 2022-07-25 10:45:50 ok cool so can i make a suggestion for the accuracy of the guns?
the-dump 2022-07-25 10:46:33 specifically the “auto rifle”
the-dump 2022-07-25 18:20:05 1: thats a mp34 which is an smg not a rifle
2: when youre out of ammo there shouldnt be repeating clicks like that, just 1 since its an open bolt system meaning the bolt stays back until the trigger is pulled and then is reset by the recoil, which is impossible without a round in the chamber
2: the rate of fire should be a little slower

creations-chat 2022-07-27 05:20:14 airliner builders try not to be incredibly average challenge (impossible)

yes. which is why i was prompted to write that diss
creations-chat 2022-07-27 05:24:26 make the engines round with custom angles, rely less of wedges for everything, add a livery, and add more detail in general
creations-chat 2022-07-27 05:27:29 detail might come with the livery but i meant all the little panel lines and bits of text that are on some models

also add window frames
creations-chat 2022-07-27 05:30:53 if you want tips and tricks for painting talk to me or <@456226577798135808>
np
creations-chat 2022-07-27 05:53:45 well yeah id say my original diss is a little inaccurate for the sake of comedy

a better version would be “airliner builders try not to completely suck ass challenge (impossible)” i just wanted to fuck with you <:clueless:942802644043464734>

creations-chat 2022-07-27 18:31:27 rbk is too much of a boomer to know what custom angles or cameras are
creations-chat 2022-07-27 18:33:46 2 simple reasons for me:

1: they arent affected by bullshit pc lag and also get the same exact angle every time, even if they reset every time you load your build

2: its much lighter than motorlock since cameras weigh nothing and you usually only need some text as a connection

actually 3:
it allows you to have custom angles on builds that are too small to have motorlock
creations-chat 2022-07-27 18:41:12 no im pretty sure thats from a vine of a kid falling over
if i just posted a dead child accidentally im gonna have an aneurysm

creations-chat 2022-07-31 08:51:44 no cause it sucks
creations-chat 2022-07-31 09:03:52 ok
creations-chat 2022-07-31 09:16:04 1: paint looks like diarrhea 
2: massively failed camo attempt
3: no tail rotor
4: counter rotating rotors (skill issue)
5: fat as shit
6: tiny ass cockpit windows
7: looks like if an mi-6 and mi-24 had a kid and because they are related it was born deformed
8: no detail
9: missing exhausts
10: random ass gaps all over the place
11: the belly color is wrong
12: no point for it to be as big as it is
13: nose is fat too
14: goofy ass instruments 
15: no landing gear 
16: its russian 
17: looks like it has an identity crisis. cant decide if its an attack helicopter, transport, or heavy lifter
18: the rotors are tiny
19: 4 intakes 💀
20: goofy ass shaping

BONUSES <:clueless:942802644043464734> 

21: horrid thickness transitions 
22: over-reliance on wedges and other specialized blocks for shaping
23: desperately needs an angle locked tail

theres your 20 reasons.
in conclusion, it sucks just like i said <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2022-07-31 09:20:12 literally everything i said was factual and yeah 20 minutes which is less than a minute for each reason <:clueless:942802644043464734> 

the one towards the back might just be another fucking gap or smth idk but it fucking sucks and you are too egotistical to agree even after having all of its issues pointed out to you

creations-chat 2022-07-31 09:49:19 my house is 85 years old so all the windows are single panes with no insulation around them aside from the original caulk. the plastic wrap acts as insulation and keeps the house (and more importantly my room since it has the biggest window in the house in it) cool in the summer and warm in the winter <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096> 👍

creations-chat 2022-08-04 06:56:09 and your bus doesnt have an functionalily besides suspension blocks and motors connected to some cylinders so you cant use that as an excuse for sucking either

not to mention that functionality puts no limits on looks unless its a pvp build which that clearly isnt
creations-chat 2022-08-04 06:58:44 i did look and it has no mechanisms or anything even remotely worth mentioning besides how bad it is <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2022-08-04 07:01:28 wow you placed some motors holy shit thats so skillful and totally excuses the total neglect of the exterior. also you cant post a build made for functionality and then not show any of the functionality (not like there is any anyway) and expect people to strain their eyes looking for it instead of just looking at the most presented part of the build, the exterior.

creations-chat 2022-08-06 06:56:30 now i just have to channel all my mech experience (none) into making it not walk like it has cerebral palsy
creations-chat 2022-08-06 07:24:32 actively making it walk
creations-chat 2022-08-06 07:39:20 fart rank
creations-chat 2022-08-06 07:47:06 if you ask me, building a tutorial to learn a type of vehicle is possibly the best way to get good at the game when combined with watching guides on game mechanics. i could hook you up with what i consider the good ones and maybe general answer questions in dms if you need
creations-chat 2022-08-06 07:51:02 alr just dm which vehicle types you want. also i suggest customizing the tutorials as well
creations-chat 2022-08-06 07:56:50 looks good but the lerx sucks and the wings are too fat

creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:30:56 the nose to canopy transitions is horrendous
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:33:23 its literally as simple as angle locking the top of the nose

try to make it like this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/653340142014038065/1005393506283569192/IMG_8872.png
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:36:02 and you not giving a shit is why it looks like ass. its a simple thing so it wont be too hard
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:38:30 what
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:40:39 shut up no ones talking to you

then close discord or go to another channel this server doesnt revolve around you
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:42:50 its your build and it looks bad. you posted it in this channel meaning you wanted feedback and now youre crying that i gave you feedback. whats your problem
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:46:55 then do that in <#384021699466756107> because this is the feedback channel. even then posting your build anywhere in this server is automatically saying youre open to feedback. besides its not like im completely altering the design im just suggesting you not make it look like…that. when making a custom plane you have to atleast base it on reality and yours is super goofy. the aerodynamics of the nose and canopy simply do not match or blend well making it look BAD and im trying to help you FIX that. do whatever but your tears arent going to make your plane any better.
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:48:58 here ill shorten it
youre a dumbass that doesnt want to improve because youre too full of yourself and its holding back your build from being great. can you read that?
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:51:04 its just infuriating when you see a build with a ton of potential and the guy making it is braindead <:nooo:787097964946259978> 
also its a minor fix that will make it so much better 😭
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:53:09 fr im always right about everything so if you disagree you are literally disabled
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:55:15 but seriously please just do the simple fix it will make your plane look so much better
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:57:48 popular jets like that are never made well fr

<@504499525067472899> aww you little stinkball you 😊
creations-chat 2022-08-06 08:59:50 bro ong why are you resisting this basic change that will vastly improve your build? if you genuinely dont care that much why dont you just make it look like this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/1005354149862445066/RobloxScreenShot20220806_003023249.png

creations-chat 2022-08-07 08:31:36 simply make a second creations channel for experts only. will motivate whitenames to get good and fix the flooding of horrendous builds in creations drowning out the good good
creations-chat 2022-08-07 08:39:30 increase requirements also all the dumbass kids who randomly upvote because they dont know any better will probably only look at the expert channel while people with actual opinions will be deciding

honestly there should be a rule that if you get 150 upvotes on any build you can get expert regardless of block count
creations-chat 2022-08-07 08:43:00 i havent seen a non meme build get 300 in forever bro (except for my boat <:clueless:942802644043464734> <:clueless:942802644043464734> <:clueless:942802644043464734> )
creations-chat 2022-08-07 08:46:50 yes but that includes rank 1-4 which is dumb
also it probably got leaked
creations-chat 2022-08-07 08:53:46 i dont see how pcc became so lifeless in 3 months. i get banned, come back 3 months later and everyone i know is gone, creations is an endless flow of diarrhea, vip severs are empty, and channels arent being talked in nearly as much
creations-chat 2022-08-07 08:55:52 rikje just needs to give more updates like goddam silence has never helped any game company or their ip besides no mans sky
creations-chat 2022-08-07 08:58:09 ip = intellectual property
creations-chat 2022-08-07 09:00:48 the difference is that tf2 is an iconic and essentially flawless game (not counting community created issues like bots or drama) that many consider timeless and or the best fps ever 

there are hundreds of sandbox games pc isnt special and its a glitchy mess.

<@615232685916553218> intellectual property is a basic term wdym
creations-chat 2022-08-07 09:05:20 all i was saying is that nms is probably the only game that has directly benefited from radio silence from the dev in case someone wanted to correct me for saying that silence has never helped any game or dev. i wasnt comparing it to pc in any way

<@456226577798135808> well yeah but devs leave games for other projects thats standard. the crux of the issue that valve pretends to still care and it blueballs the community which leads to the massive amounts of salt and whatever else that has been poisoning it since 2018

creations-chat 2022-08-07 13:57:01 i hate bad builds
creations-chat 2022-08-07 14:00:18 i was at their level for about 2 weeks then i improved

besides im not at that level anymore which gives me all the reason to hate their builds
creations-chat 2022-08-07 14:03:19 thats like saying “bro you were a child once that means you hating messy annoying little shits with the brain function of a single celled organism is irrational”
creations-chat 2022-08-07 14:05:23 <@195253906333368320> please do this and maybe adjust the standards for expert depending on if the non high rank channel gets less or more vote traffic
yes make expert designer 150 and make it so if your build gets 150 upvotes you can get that specific expert type regardless of block count
creations-chat 2022-08-07 14:07:53 incredibly undeserving of that many votes
creations-chat 2022-08-07 14:10:14 yeah but you also have to remember that a lot of the mods dont play the game or are still the same skill level they were when they joined and dont really have a grasp on our standards
nor do they care

creations-chat 2022-08-07 20:09:02 i still believe in gun rights but full autos and shit like that should stay (mostly) outlawed since they are only practical for mass shootings. no one is gonna be carrying around a full auto for self defense it doesnt make sense <:clueless:942802644043464734> <:clueless:942802644043464734> 
also there should be more laws about storage and in-home safety. almost all gun deaths are self inflicted purposefully or accidentally and thats gay

creations-chat 2022-08-08 05:37:48 he didnt downvote my quattro which is the closest hes come to liking one of my builds. doesnt matter tho cause hes a piss baby who has never made a mini build in his life
creations-chat 2022-08-08 05:41:44 he cries about pixel inaccuracies and exposed motorlock but his builds are so mid. he denies it but he let hof go straight to his head. he also blocked me because i said i hate his asshole friendgroup
creations-chat 2022-08-08 05:47:11 fr. the worst thing about him is that he thinks he now’s everything about all build types. he will rip something to shreds that he has never even attempted to make and jts annoying

<@611251614178869269> if he agrees that his builds are mid he has absolutely no right to have standards that are so unrealistically high and especially on things he isn’t qualified to talk about due to lack of experience. simple as
creations-chat 2022-08-08 05:50:55 theres such thing as an invalid opinion. you wouldnt trust that normal person to be a politician or trust that they know how to solve issues if they know nothing about politics. hars is exactly like that except the lacks he humility to shut up about things he doesnt know abt

creations-chat 2022-08-08 06:48:38 healthcare, civil rights, decentralization of power, etc. the problem with people like you and (previously) me is the media has brainwashed us to be too radicalized to see the smaller things and think everything is black and white when there are 50 shades of gray 

<@513966516958658561> stfu no one cares about you rn
creations-chat 2022-08-08 06:51:00 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2022-08-08 06:54:31 the fact that people dont care about is both sides can be radical and both sides politicians are horrendously corrupt. what they aim to do is divide the people. remember 
"We the people..."
creations-chat 2022-08-08 07:00:07 brainwashed statement
you literally just said "republicans bad liberals good"
creations-chat 2022-08-08 07:05:31 not gonna start an argument on abortion since we've already established we strongly disagree. 
anyway you seem to take minorities and majorities and generalize. like saying all repubs are radical and all liberals arent that far left. 50 shades guh. yes both sides sucks but its the loud minorities like radicals that accentuate the issue of political radicalization in the us
creations-chat 2022-08-08 07:08:01 ok thats just a dumb statement. a party is made up of people, im talking about the people.
all i want is for corruption to be decreased for both sides

looks like its missing railings too. which specific ship is it i wanna go more in depth

creations-chat 2022-08-10 06:46:40 reading books is considered an educational hobby so id call this a hobby (unless you only read wikipedia and nothing else) 
ngl the cold war is the best. you have fast jet, big boat, main shattle tank, etc

also yes stuff like that is why i love doing this. you read about smth and you think “hey that sounds familiar” and then you go down the rabbit hole and learn that some random coat hook has roots in a ww2 tanker wanting to have a secure place to keep his gear on his tank or smth like that

creations-chat 2022-08-11 14:09:13 imma be real this is awful. dont camera lock something just for the sake of having camera lock. all of those angles couldve and shouldve been done with motors and pistons except maybe the wings. also the corsair is p much a perfect cylinder so idk why you made yours 1 wide and 2 tall

imo camera lock should only be used when there isn’t enough room for angle lock without exposed or for pvp builds.
creations-chat 2022-08-11 14:13:27 i see so imma going to go ahead and flex my corsair which was my (technically second) first camera locked  build <:clueless:942802644043464734> <:clueless:942802644043464734> <:clueless:942802644043464734>
