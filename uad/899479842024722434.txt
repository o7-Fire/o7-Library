plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:50:30 yo
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:50:55 i dont got image perms but theres this thing where my rockets freeze in the air
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:51:00 im trying to make a custom rocket missle truck
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:51:06 but the missles freeze in the air my guy
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:51:10 they got no anchor blocks though
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:51:25 i can send it in anyones dms if they wanna see
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:51:33 since liek i've been stuck in this for a couple of hours
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:52:06 amoogos
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:52:22 i havent had this happen before tho
general 2021-11-23 04:55:03 mind if anybody checks <#384021699466756107>  since im raging over a bug
general 2021-11-23 04:55:16 dont mind the fact im very mad currently and have to ask people to check
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:55:41 nop
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:55:59 it didin't work either
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:56:08 i tried many times already none of them work so i came here
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:56:12 perhaps its bug yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:56:18 roblos
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:56:30 none of those really
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:56:55 when theres no motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:56:57 or wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:56:59 on the rocket
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:57:01 it works
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:57:04 but its dogwater
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:57:20 im new to palne crazy
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:57:22 no no custom rockets
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:57:33 one with
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:57:39 how do i fix that then?
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:57:50 nono its like
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:57:51 REALLY NEAR
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:57:58 when i touch it it goes stop motion
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:58:05 what
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:58:17 yeah but like i did that already
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:58:25 my advanced designs use motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:58:29 and motorlock makes it die also
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:58:31 freezes
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:58:35 nope
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:58:42 want me to send some pictures
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:58:44 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:59:04 what
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:59:05 waeawaawa
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:59:16 dang bro
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:59:19 no fix for it then?
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:59:37 my pc is good though..
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 04:59:40 here ill send pics
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 05:00:38 could you add me real quick

plane-crazy 2021-11-23 05:11:11 zad
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 05:11:27 do you know any other way to make rockets then

plane-crazy 2021-11-23 05:15:51 <@!233700700406808576>  hey do you know this
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:33:13 yo do you guys know how to make folding stronger?
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:33:25 since my carrier is quite heavy and not a maxed out torque can really hold it
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:33:47 then it wouldnt move?
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:33:51 or d you mean like angle lock
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:34:03 heh
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:34:11 let me try
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:34:41 it wont move
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:35:10 how do i do it correctly
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:35:18 sorry im new to plane crazy troll
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:35:28 i have powered and lock on
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:35:34 max torque
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:35:35 1 speed
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:35:48 ok
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:36:52 i held it for straight up 30 seconds nothing happen
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:37:20 okay
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:38:00 did not work
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:38:32 i have an anchor block to my carrier does that affect
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:38:45 that aint good
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:38:50 i have to take it out?
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:38:56 ill try that
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:39:26 hold on
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:39:26 lol im an idiot i forgot where i placed the anchor
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:40:08 worst mistake of my life
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:40:42 i probably should have
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:40:44 i cant find it lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:40:50 ill just tryy
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:41:31 public pvp?
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:41:35 how would that work
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:42:34 tbh im just touching every block with the configuration tool
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:43:48 even worse it says i have 1998 anchor blocks which means theres 2
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:46:34 i made progress and its on the roof
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:46:37 so thats alot
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:46:55 idk anymore really
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:46:57 im still trying to find
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:51:13 I GOT 1
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:51:16 I GOT 1 OF THE ANACOR
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:51:17 NEXT
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:52:19 not yet
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:52:23 i still ahve to find the next one lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:52:27 but yes i did
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:56:55 ok done
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:57:05 im gonna try out the physics thing now
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:58:32 it works but the motors keep breaking when im in anchor mode
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:59:33 each fold will have an anchor?
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 09:59:38 sorry im confused
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 10:00:07 so each fold will have an anchor that has physics on yes
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 10:00:24 ill try
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 10:01:05 it wont let me fold even
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 10:02:00 my game crashed
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 10:02:08 nevermind it only froze
plane-crazy 2021-12-02 10:02:48 oh i get you nevermind ill just work on carrier thanks <@!707953054489509978>
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 05:35:48 yo guys im doing an aircraft carrier but the catapult is glitching out
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 05:36:00 whenever i pull it back and try to launch it
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 05:36:05 it just stays there in the air
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 05:36:09 unless i touch it or something
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 05:36:23 
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 05:37:18 just stays like this
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 05:37:27 the suspension isnt on 0 though
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 05:38:45 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 05:44:30 it works when i remove the catapult that above
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 05:44:32 ðŸ—¿
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 05:45:09 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 05:47:04 nvm i got it now to work
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 05:47:10 some cameras i guess what messing around
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:22:20 what does damping do on suspension
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:28:58 
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:29:06 lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:29:20 winter update moment?
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:29:30 but what does damping do on suspension
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:29:46 Same
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:30:25 **who knows what damping does on suspension**
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:30:52 ah ok
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:30:53 so if i max it
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:30:58 oh
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:31:03 same thing with me
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:31:10 so if i max out damping it should not bounce that much?
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:31:26 no winter update
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:31:27 smh
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:31:27 smh
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:31:47 ok let me try that
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:31:51 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:33:16 im confused
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:33:42 gotcha
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:33:54 heh
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:33:56

plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:47:25 dont think the piston mechanic really works for my aircraft carrier bro <@!690727914521493504>
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:47:36 becuase it can go left and right and my gear gets slapped
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:49:43 what does resitution do on ropes anyways?
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:50:21 ayt
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:50:21 ay
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:50:37 aye
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:50:50 anybody know a way to make suspensions less bouncy
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:51:00 since i need to do make a catapult for my aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:51:22 i tried already doesnt work that well though sadly
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:51:25 ill try
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:54:39 doesnt really do that much
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:54:42 20 stiffness is the best right now
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:54:50 it doesnt bounce that much but it still bounces
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:55:05 
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:55:08 im making a catapult for my aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:55:21 the white blocks are the catapult mechanic
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:55:32 its like a gear and thati t pulls back the spring and lets it go
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:55:44 but keeps bouncing when it interacts with the suspensions
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 06:55:49 making the catapult not really work
