plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:01:02 I'm trying to make this helicopter work but my motor just spins the body not the blades

plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:03:08 let me try a snipping tool screenshot
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:03:24 
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:03:51 
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:07:47 pretty much only the body
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:08:03 the rotors spin a little but thats probably just the movement of the body
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:08:06 im trying to fix it
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:09:36 I got it to do some sort of liftoff but the body still spins.
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:09:57 and it doesnt stay airborne for long
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:10:42 I use that for turning XD
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:11:03 So to stop the spinning I just need a powerful rear propellor?
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:11:19 On both sides or like one side
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:13:12 oh cool
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:16:07 The top propeller isn't spinning
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:19:13 I got the rotors spinning  in opposite directions but it still spins the body
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:32:26 I still can't get the single rotor to work
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:43:39 No matter how I configure this the body of the helicopter just wont stop spinning please help
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:44:11 no

plane-crazy 2018-11-04 20:31:18 Just make the body super complicated and wait for them to get halfway done and then just  load in a different creation or start working on a different one and watch them ***struggle***

plane-crazy 2018-11-07 18:36:43 My first attempt at a mech that can walk didn't go well lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 18:37:26 Is there any way to make motors a lot more stiff?
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 18:40:42 I found a way to make them stop dropping after usage
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 18:40:50 just the lock tick box solved it
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 19:28:05 Building an AT-ST and this dude comes up to me and says this
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 19:28:17 its going well
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 19:30:12 it can stand no problem I just need to set up the motors now
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 19:30:14 
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 19:44:31 What does damping do on the suspension block settings?
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 19:50:41 I'm in the process of trying to get this AT-ST to walk
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 19:50:58 it is hard
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 19:52:03 Helium might work.
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 19:52:32 idk what that means
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 19:52:35 but it has two legs
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 19:56:49 
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 19:58:50 The main problem with this AT-ST is that when I try to put one foot forward it messes up the positioning of the other
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 19:59:31 and crap like this
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 20:00:47 and think about adding turning ***that would be a fucking nightmare oh god***
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 20:00:58 but awesome to have
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 20:16:46 make a dick shape car with pistons to knock over enemies xd
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:41:26 can you remove the height limit please
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:41:41 I am making an AT-AT
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:42:45 so like have the build folded down in build mode and then fold it up?
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:43:12 im not sure how a 4 legged mech thing would get onto its legs like that
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:46:26 It wont let me  move it down
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 16:47:08 saving and reloading the creation worked
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:09:03 I'm currently trying to make this
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:09:52 because of height restrictions the legs have to be folded in build mode and i will use jets to raise it up and then motors to lower the legs into standing position before turning off the motors
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 17:30:33 AT-AT in progress
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 18:25:41

plane-crazy 2019-01-02 13:08:17 idk
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 13:11:01 I went in wikipedia and the Maglev's really long nose helps not only with aerodynamics (makes it faster by reducing drag) but it helps make it quieter
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 13:12:22 The maglev holds the world record for furthest distance travelled by a train in a single day at 2525 miles

help 2019-01-02 16:08:32 Can someone tell me how to make a good train chassis?
help 2019-01-02 16:12:03 a good way is using suspension springs on the wheels but there's a better way
help 2019-01-02 16:15:07 i dont know
help 2019-01-02 16:15:32 there's a train contest on right now try looking in <#504630451579781121> they will be using good chassis
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 16:27:39 someone needs 2 ban this dude
help 2019-01-02 16:39:37 <@!434967120393273357> I've figured out how to make the trains turn https://streamable.com/6dr1r

help 2019-01-02 21:50:48 How do you make tank tracks?
help 2019-01-02 22:08:56 I sort of made a prototype https://streamable.com/1ns19
help 2019-01-02 22:14:01 Main issue is the treads bunching up and folding over one another but it works overall
help 2019-01-02 22:14:10 I haven't tested it on an actual vehicle though.
help 2019-01-02 22:18:10 I'm going to implement it to a very basic chassis and see if it works
help 2019-01-02 22:35:09 https://streamable.com/l2ivq
help 2019-01-02 22:35:50 It works with vehicles, though it is by no means a smooth ride. The only issues to fix now are making it roll smoothly and implementing a system to prevent the tracks from falling off the rollers
help 2019-01-02 22:38:53 and a tendency for tracks to fold up and jam when switching between moving forward and reversing, causing unwanted turning
help 2019-01-02 22:41:38 the tanks also tend to jam up completely when attempting to traverse any sort of hill
help 2019-01-02 22:41:51 although they remain functional when moving downhill
help 2019-01-02 22:53:19 Given the nature of the rollers it is difficult to implement a system to prevent the tracks from sliding/falling off
help 2019-01-02 22:54:03 and the tracks have serious issues with grip and are highly prone to sliding
help 2019-01-02 22:54:19 which makes them unable to traverse vertical terrains
help 2019-01-02 23:03:48 <@367588891777171466> Thanks, that actually really helps the whole grip situation 😄

help 2019-01-02 23:10:48 I also got the tracks to go smoothly
help 2019-01-02 23:13:15 nevermind, the tracks just jam up with cylinder rotators it needs to be half block

plane-crazy 2019-01-04 15:24:54 To get level 5 train conductor rank do I have to make the other half off the tracks and use motors to put them on the tracks
help 2019-01-04 15:52:34 you need a motor underneath the base to allow it to spin
help 2019-01-04 15:52:53 and where the actual barrel is, put motors on the sides to allow you to aim up and down

plane-crazy 2019-02-20 22:07:10 Perhaps I could make a latch?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 22:07:30 if magnets can hold then i can use those

plane-crazy 2019-02-20 22:08:27 ok
