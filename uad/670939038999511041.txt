creations-chat 2020-02-26 19:42:14 what do u think of my MiG 25 ?(btw started playing 3 days ago)
creations-chat 2020-02-26 19:45:41 it makes a speed of 650, with boost of a build.in conveyor engine 7000-8000(controllable till 2500)
creations-chat 2020-02-26 19:50:56 and my other two builds : a chopper and a concorde
creations-chat 2020-02-26 19:50:57 
creations-chat 2020-02-26 19:50:58 
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 19:52:51 <@!593884042605101086> u like MiGs ?
creations-chat 2020-02-26 20:01:47 <@!265484911912288257> idk... seems like everyone downvotes everything...
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 20:24:07 can someone tell me pls why people up-and downvote like this
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 20:24:08 
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 20:27:01 i know u
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 20:27:14 u did blacklist me
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 20:27:43 HerrGuggi, with a noobskin
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 20:27:59 i jumped inside ur bombbay
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 20:28:21 i had no vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 20:28:36 just wanted to see ur jet
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 20:29:09 what is ur problem with this now ?
plane-crazy 2020-02-26 20:30:06 well, the rip
creations-chat 2020-02-26 20:36:14 i did my best to copy it, but proper jet noses are hard to build in this game
creations-chat 2020-02-26 20:42:51 but i have to admit, the heli didnt went out that well, and i dont like the nose of my concorde too
creations-chat 2020-02-26 20:45:04 but when i built it i didnt know u have settings for motors, but i will build a better nose now
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:40:04 guys u didnt like my first MiG 25, but here is the second :
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:40:46 its powered by one low tuned conveyor-engine, making insane speeds
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:41:28 its also extremely manuverable and tiny, what makes it perfect for combat
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:43:04 and due to the conveyor engine there is still enough space for bombs ; )
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:44:41 gonna try to build it with conventional engines though, to get proper acceleration and braking, not that laggy stuff
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:45:02 btw its 285 pieces only
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:46:15 i have the conveyor speed only on 10 of 50 or so
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:47:01 the clue behind making the conveyor so slow is to get great steering
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:47:16 <@!287779983445721088> why ?
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:48:00 thats just how the real MiG 25 looks <@!287779983445721088>
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:48:26 just google it
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:49:26 shell i build another jet, and wich one ?(with a "proper" hatch)
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:50:21 <@456226577798135808> go on YT, its basicly a piston, a conveyor, 6 blocks and a half block
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:51:15 <@!287779983445721088> me262 is hard, modern jets would be better for this game
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:52:12 if i build it bigger it would be ok, but i like to build small
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:53:10 <@!287779983445721088> i put one engine in a 2400 block concorde and it goes into space with a speed of 1500-3000+
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:54:01 the nose of that concorde is ugly though
creations-chat 2020-02-27 21:56:48 the conveyor doesnt care about the blocks, it just ever goes the same spped
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:02:46 not really
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:03:50 my big MiG 25 (780 blocks) goes 7000-8000+
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:06:52 idk man
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:08:04 its to short, tracks are to this, surfaces aint right, and the gun is just... uhmm...
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:09:30 make it 4 blocks thinner and double the tracks, that may help
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:09:59 and get a angle at the front
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:13:28 do u have WoT , WoT Blitz or WarThunder ?
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:13:53 there u can see it
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:15:23 see u have to make it smaller
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:16:17 oh and the guy wich built that T95 is a small YTer
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:16:24 lemme see..
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:16:45 but u may see the building there
help 2020-02-27 22:22:51 <@314383347214319616> can u explain me that designer and engineer stuff pls ?
help 2020-02-27 22:24:03 oh thx
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:29:09 what can i say...
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:38:13 well its mainly the nose making it bad, the rest is ok
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:39:21 and u have to consider thats the second thing i ever built in this game( first was just some testing and playing around)
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:40:16 <@!287779983445721088> look at pictures, the engines are pretty accurate
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:41:08 can we met in game so u guys can see it properly ?
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:41:44 JUST come in game pls
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:41:57 ooof
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:42:20 for me its 23:42
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:43:16 ill try to get proper pictures
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:47:51 
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:47:52 
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:47:54 
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:48:43 i still think it looks better in game, but these pics are ok
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:52:20 they are a little bit to wide, but they are positioned right
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:53:36 oh and the game could use some shadows, just noticing
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:56:48 uhm
creations-chat 2020-02-27 22:57:22 its a 2400 blocks build with a conveyor engine, and im playing on a 2012 Laptop
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 02:02:31 <@!195253906333368320> if u dont like controlsurfaces, just use the technic of swifting wings with motors. in ur case u could even try using only the small back wings with two motors, but in my experience this is unstable
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 02:05:04 then why dont try fitting a second motor for rolling ? thats all u need in a jet
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 02:06:06 it works even on the tiniest planes if u have the roll on the main wings
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 02:06:57 my elevators are f r
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 02:07:41 mig 21
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 02:07:52 uhm
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 02:08:04 could u dimm the light ?
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 02:08:25 AFTERburner
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 02:08:55 i would try doing that afterburner with smoke
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 02:09:40 also u can use a spotlight in only one direction
creations-chat 2020-02-28 14:01:12 <@!325320982602448897> the hull of ur chaffe looks nice, but i still dont like the turret
creations-chat 2020-02-28 14:03:17 i thnk the turret front needs to be more sharper, more pointed. its to flat atm
help 2020-02-28 14:07:55 guys i need help with my tiny MiG 25 : i tried less angle for the motor control and did build it with conveyor engine, Magnet engine and conventional rockets, but there is ever the same problem : when it goes more then 400 speed, the nose starts wobbeling, the wobbeling increases with the speed. Do u know anything I could do ? (and no its not the server or internet connection)
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 14:13:28 guys can u help me in <#478584971670454284> ?
help 2020-02-28 14:15:03 u mean ballast in the front ? its already pretty noseheavy
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 14:47:53 guys did anyone ever build a proper v22-Osprey ?
creations-chat 2020-02-28 15:28:46 <@!532941920033439764> try making the engine of ur he162 longer, and paint it lke the rest of ur plane
help 2020-02-28 15:33:12 its really simple :
creations-chat 2020-02-28 15:34:00 make the engine longer
creations-chat 2020-02-28 15:35:21 1 in the front, 2 in the back maybe
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 16:01:23 should i build this or a su 47 next ?
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 16:02:19 
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 16:02:24 
plane-crazy 2020-02-28 16:32:06 yoink ?
creations-chat 2020-02-28 20:53:35 Guys here is my SU-47(some changes at the back)
creations-chat 2020-02-28 20:53:36 
creations-chat 2020-02-28 20:53:37 
creations-chat 2020-02-28 20:59:46 its fully motorsteered, powerd by a low tuned conveyorengine and steerable even at high speeds, extrem manuverable. could be used in combat, even room for bombs inside
creations-chat 2020-02-28 21:06:06 a bit blocky, but nice
creations-chat 2020-02-28 21:07:23 oh and i think the guns may be to bit, especially on the middle turret
creations-chat 2020-02-28 21:11:43 the motors have to be bigger and lower, also the turret needs to be smaller. beside from that a nice plane though
creations-chat 2020-02-29 14:26:20 here is a Eurofighter, powered by a conveyor engine, still needs cockpit interior and proper landing gear. Rolls great, pitches hard.
creations-chat 2020-02-29 14:26:21 
creations-chat 2020-02-29 14:26:22 
creations-chat 2020-02-29 14:27:05 controllable at speeds up to 3000
creations-chat 2020-02-29 17:58:54 eventhough its made with a tutorial, its still ugly
plane-crazy 2020-02-29 19:00:28 show a Screenshot
plane-crazy 2020-02-29 19:34:29 when does the update come ?
creations-chat 2020-03-01 10:06:18 its boring, we had it atleast 10 times here
creations-chat 2020-03-01 10:32:45 <@383178915268526080> that was kind of my idea to use conveyor/ magnet engines to get small, realistic, yet flying Planes. Great build though, would match my SU-47
creations-chat 2020-03-01 10:33:33 or my MiG 25
creations-chat 2020-03-01 10:33:42 (smol one)
plane-crazy 2020-03-01 11:05:52 guys what should i build ?
creations-chat 2020-03-01 12:22:42 videos wont be accepted
creations-chat 2020-03-01 12:22:49 maybe as a gif
creations-chat 2020-03-02 16:07:19 nice... I see some relations with my small MiG 25😉
creations-chat 2020-03-02 16:09:06 i have a bigger one too
creations-chat 2020-03-02 16:09:25 ppl dont like the bigger ones nose though
creations-chat 2020-03-02 16:09:58 I really like ur idea of guided missiles

creations-chat 2020-03-02 16:10:44 hm
creations-chat 2020-03-02 16:12:27 have u a idea what i should build next ? Already built a Cocorde, a SU-47, a big Eurofighter, the MiGs and a few experimental thingys
creations-chat 2020-03-02 16:13:14 hm
creations-chat 2020-03-02 16:13:51 is it the one with the folding wings u can see in Topgun ?
creations-chat 2020-03-02 16:14:32 would have to be biiiig
creations-chat 2020-03-02 16:27:00 im gonna do a fantasy jet
creations-chat 2020-03-04 12:08:36 <@!509641743570829312> looks really nice, but i think it needs to be a bit wider
creations-chat 2020-03-05 18:19:24 its really good
creations-chat 2020-03-05 18:20:11 but in my tradition i would implement a conveyor engine

plane-crazy 2020-03-16 12:04:51 Also its smaller brother, a pure fighter wich is a dream in terms of flight performance
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 12:05:22 what is aegis ?

creations-chat 2020-03-16 14:12:31 also its smaller brother, a pure fighter. its flying really great, could be used as a blue angels plane
plane-crazy 2020-03-16 14:25:18 short or long nose ?

plane-crazy 2020-03-16 14:28:15 what would perfect nose be ?
plane-crazy 2020-03-18 08:14:50 is it worth trying to build the draken (j35d) ? would be really hard to get the curves
plane-crazy 2020-03-18 08:41:48 so guys there are two options : 1. make it big like that one to get the airintakes and other stuff right. 2. make it small so u dont see all the errors made
plane-crazy 2020-03-18 08:41:59 what should I do ?
plane-crazy 2020-03-18 08:51:53 building a mid-sized free build jet now with relations to the draken

plane-crazy 2020-03-19 09:25:53 poor grille
plane-crazy 2020-03-19 10:42:03 why ?
plane-crazy 2020-03-19 10:59:49 a few wingpanels inside and a conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2020-03-19 11:00:29 u have to trim the conveyor somewhat slow
plane-crazy 2020-03-19 11:01:01 and u need control surfaces or motor steering inside
plane-crazy 2020-03-19 11:01:10 and a lot of wingpanels
creations-chat 2020-03-19 14:09:19 he really self- upvoted...

plane-crazy 2020-03-21 13:19:41 but look at all the F4s here
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 13:20:04 none of them has the canopy shape even close to correct
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 14:47:04 a end of building the structur is in sight.... then comes the engineering part to make it fly and then the paintjob
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 14:49:20 we are already close to 2500 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-03-21 16:39:56 nearly done, just the paintjob and some bombs and such stuff left. It flys great, just like a normal plane, but it has astonishing 2800+blocks

help 2020-03-22 14:47:29 but for Horten it has to be IX
help 2020-03-22 14:53:55 ye
help 2020-03-22 14:54:12 the hard thing will be making the engine inlets

plane-crazy 2020-03-22 16:40:44 i sadly can't really play WT because.. well... 2012 Mac Book..
help 2020-03-22 16:41:03 oh nice
help 2020-03-22 16:41:54 but I would make the entire wing front the same way
help 2020-03-22 16:42:36 try both and chose what looks best
help 2020-03-22 16:43:49 ik
help 2020-03-22 16:44:07 but I just doesn't look right in this game
help 2020-03-22 16:44:57 I would have a solution to problems like this in <#507673335816126509> .... feel free to upvote it 😉
help 2020-03-22 16:46:39 and I think the entire wing in the same way would look that bad, and the realism isn't that important in the game(can't really reach realistic wings here anyway)
help 2020-03-22 16:53:09 a slightly above picture would be nice
help 2020-03-22 16:55:03 thats better
help 2020-03-22 16:55:35 a nice paint job and ur ready to go !
help 2020-03-22 16:56:12 oh and for the flying part :
help 2020-03-22 16:56:27 use motor steering and a small conveyor engine
help 2020-03-22 17:10:15 for a conveyor engine u need 2x1x1 blocks
help 2020-03-22 17:10:24 that should be fine
help 2020-03-22 17:10:48 but steering may be hard with the block wings

general 2020-04-08 17:33:40 f4c instead of f4e
general 2020-04-08 17:37:48 <@!244238834852823041> why are the road wheels blocks ?
general 2020-04-08 17:38:16 why not cylinders ?

general 2020-04-08 17:42:43 ye
general 2020-04-08 17:43:05 or just take rockets instead
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 18:08:21 thats better, but the nose is still too fat
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 18:09:02 maybe move the landing gear inside ith a locked motor <@!435946988559925248>
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 18:09:22 ye
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 18:09:39 do it
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 18:10:17 and make the nose not with a wdge, but with a half wedge down and half wedge up 1x2
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 18:10:44 sure
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 18:10:58 there are a lot
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 18:11:16 never seen a yak-141 for example
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 18:12:09 a book about ALL fighters ? i dont believe that
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 18:14:17 <@!435946988559925248> move it in the nose with a locked motor
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 18:14:54 and idk about a pitch down or so, mine hasnt landing gear so i didnt research that
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 18:53:52 <@!435946988559925248> im a bit late but i would
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 18:54:12 1. keep 1 block distance between nose and canopy
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 18:55:01 2. take triangle wedges 1x3 instead of half wedges, the gap isnt that bad
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 18:55:50 omg
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 18:56:01 people are so dumb...

plane-crazy 2020-04-08 19:10:13 <@!435946988559925248> yeah, but use triangle wedge 1x3 instead of half wedge
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 19:10:25 <@!527653676022628353> that doesnt count
plane-crazy 2020-04-08 19:13:09 <@435946988559925248> the small gap doesn't matter and it looks a lot smother like that it

plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:13:14 strange window
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:13:17 too flat
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:14:34 canopy, front window, what ever u call it. the thing the pilot looks through
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:17:37 its no "havlo binglo" whatever that means
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:18:28 <@!287459677611098114> that is to flat. 1x2 or 1x3 wedge would be better
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:18:48 just build ur own one
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:19:15 what plane is that ?
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:19:57 ugh
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:20:06 the m50 is a ugly plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:20:13 why would u build that
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:20:36 i don't care that its unique, its ugly.
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:20:44 urs is not fat enough
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:21:20 but not as fat as the real one
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:21:27 also nose is too long
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:21:41 urs
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:22:28 its not that flat at the top
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:22:50 and urs is like 1 block too long
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:23:43 just build the shape and motor lock the windshield into it
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:26:32 <@!287459677611098114> the shape of the m50s nose is closer to that nose then ur nose :
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:26:40 
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:28:02 urs to flat even though the model is looking upwards
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:28:18 top and bottom have the same curve
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:29:10 that too, but I'm talking about the entire nose
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:30:02 
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:30:16 they are the same curve
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:30:38 top is just interrupted by the windshield a bit
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:33:17 <@549538911089721345> we can go on a trip now
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:33:47 lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:34:49 first get the nose done, then see how it looks
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:35:52 but I would suggest making the shape more like my plane but on both sides and with a longer body, and then motor lock the cockpit into it
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:36:22 
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:37:14 
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 15:37:26 just the nose shape

bug-reports 2020-04-22 10:51:17 <@!217336009455566848> it only happens to suspensions, and on smaller builds u often can make it not happen by putting a rope to the suspension, also its more likely to happen to bigger builds in general. for this particular build it usually happens when turning while driving on rough terrain. Are u sure its the Roblox physics ? And if it is, could it be a solution to program the suspension in another way ?

general 2020-05-19 17:28:14 GUYS
if we manage that there is always someone online in vip1
we can keep outlines there
general 2020-05-19 17:28:59 > wait guggi how's your bote?
<@!448505589983739914> havent really done any further work on it, currently more on tanks
general 2020-05-19 17:29:30 havent played
general 2020-05-19 17:29:44 it gonna look shit without outlines
general 2020-05-19 17:31:10 u guys ever played the game with graphics on 7-10 ?
general 2020-05-19 17:34:53 it doesnt look as bad as i expected it to look
general 2020-05-19 17:39:47 ugh🥴
general 2020-05-19 17:41:54 🤮
general 2020-05-19 17:45:16 NOOOOOOO
general 2020-05-19 17:45:41 OUTLINES REMOVED
general 2020-05-19 17:46:43 thats what it looked like before
general 2020-05-19 17:47:30 now it looks like a crappy kids toy :((
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 18:48:53 i bet there are some people that didnt even play they game but downvote everything that doesnt look like its made by pro on blender
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 20:45:41 this
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 20:45:49 or this ?
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 20:46:31 [additional detail may be added later on]
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 20:47:01 mainly turret hight and form
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 20:47:17 look closely
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 20:48:18 outlines still exist in vip1
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 20:49:10 if there is always at least 1 person in vip1 we will be able to have outlines till rick adds cusstom ones
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 21:02:58 thing is if only outlines were gone it wouldn't be that bad
BUT
u may have noticed-the colour shade changed a little bit with every block
now it doesn't do that anymore.
thats what makes the stuff look like its made out of plastic.
u can paint these shades by hand, but even for small builds, its gonna be a huge amount of work
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 21:03:20 > herrguggi why are you writing a poem
<@!260797229068058634>  YAS <:SoonTM:501066468629413916>
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 21:04:26 but why is it gone now with the outlines ?
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 21:05:09 tHe DiFfeReNt ShAdEs
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 21:05:14 are gone
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 21:05:51 it is making it look like plastic
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 21:05:55 just compare
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 21:06:03 when u have bad graphics
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 21:06:16 outlines got removed anyway
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 21:06:23 wait lemme show u
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 21:09:57 before
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 21:10:09 after
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 21:10:54 this one is comparable good though bcs it already had hand painted shading

plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:33:45 I think we should have both outlines and rgb randomizer able to be toggled
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 15:34:29 u have that for example in vehicle sim
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 20:47:09 does anyone know how rick is progressing with the outlines ?
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 20:49:01 i would really like if he would already give us the colour randomizer
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 20:50:07 i would make both outlines and rgb randomizer individually able to be toggled
bot-central 2020-05-20 20:52:26 ?shelp
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 21:09:32 lower quality
plane-crazy 2020-05-20 21:10:36 imagine normal servers
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 10:51:41 racist ?
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 10:51:58 he is dumb and probably nationalist
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 10:52:36 but USA isn't a race.... to be exact humans dont even have races
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 10:53:17 > isnt it rude to assume someone is from the USA when they speaking english
<@!524324517431214100> if someone said I would be from the use I would take it as an insult, so yes
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 10:54:17 are that outlines <:WhatWasThat:525319504721608705>
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 10:54:43 is it a old picture ?
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 10:55:32 good times...
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 10:55:59 i want my outlines back <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:00:09 i invented an engine that is capable of stable cruising at  nearly any speed, ranging from 200 sps to 2000+ sps. also u dont need to adjust the speed all the time like on a conveyor engine, u can control it like normal in game engines
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:00:18 there
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:00:32 
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:00:53 nope
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:01:10 magnet drives and conveyors accelerate all the time
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:02:01 > remove the magnet and see if it still works
<@!332615504315416586> it doesn't work without magnet, without magnet its just a weird behaving hover drive
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:02:48 > then its a magnet drive
<@!332615504315416586> nope, magnet drives keep accelerating all the time and can't stay at a certain speed
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:03:49 its a hybrid, but it can do things whether a magnet nor a conveyor drive can do
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:04:20 it has only 4 magnets
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:05:03 > All-in-one drive
<@!416254104017305600> well not yet, its speed limit is still around 3-4k, but there will be ways
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:06:08 btw guys do u think I could get inventor rank for this ? 👀
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:06:20 maybe with some more improvements
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:06:42 but I dont understand what they give inventor rank for
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:06:59 wait
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:07:24 <@!340543153922768906> for what stuff do people get inventor rank ?
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:07:51 > go ask some inventors
<@!332615504315416586> asked some, all said its so long ago they couldn't remember
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:08:48 but why
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:09:42 what ranks get u in vip general ?
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:10:41 <@!340543153922768906> what did u even invent ? the rank "crazy inventor" ?
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:11:08 but what kind of stuff
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:11:29 I can only think of a hand full of important inventions
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:11:55 > platformer game
<@!340543153922768906> what's that
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:14:05 the only thing u made in HoF is a feel good inc island
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 13:47:48 is it even allowed to remove stuff from HoF ?
plane-crazy 2020-05-22 13:34:35 upper one two times the speed of the lower one in the opposite direction

plane-crazy 2020-05-24 14:57:48 won't be able to build that small
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 14:58:44 <@!335599526414909451> I know how to build it, but its gonna be hard in small scale
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 14:59:12 or i do the zsh-30
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 14:59:18 *zsu
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 14:59:30 or Smol bt-5
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 14:59:42 uh
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 14:59:50 m3 firefly ?
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:00:33 looks a bit cursed
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:03:07 <@!335599526414909451> u ever tried to build an oscillating turret in plane crazy where there is no gap between turret and tank ?
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:04:39 I knew about the amx 13 with the chaffe turret
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:04:51 oh
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:04:53 nvm
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:04:59 the upper one is fake
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:09:33 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:13:44 what about building the ru 251 chassis so I can build the raketenjagdpanzers, the kanonenjagdpanzers and maybe the ru itself ?
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:14:57 I think I'm gonna do that
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:17:56 actually the plural would be raketenjagdpanzer and kanonenjagdpanzer, but that would confuse the non-germans
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:18:02 and its easy
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:20:28 "panzer" is tank, "jagd" is hunt, so "jagdpanzer" is a hunt tank, or a tank destroyer,  "rakete" can both mean rockets and missiles, in this case its missiles(ATGMs)   and "Kanone" means gun
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:24:08 wich is commonly know as a tank destroyer or TD in the English language
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:26:02 u can reach inf

plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:43:15 also the message was about new blocks in general
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:44:37

plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:47:13 rick didnt think at all here as far as I can tell
plane-crazy 2020-05-24 15:48:10 for example sakura. what's about the swashplate script. is there anything wrong with it ?

plane-crazy 2020-06-01 13:28:20 i see
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 13:28:29 its for outlines
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 13:28:33 i think
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 13:29:05 its a little bit bigger than the block itself, so u have a "outline"
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 13:30:34 <@!217336009455566848> and what about forced RGB randomizer ? it should be easier to program, u could already implement it when still working on outlines(maybe toggleable)

help 2020-06-01 17:59:14 thx
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:02:02 guys look in <#507673335816126509> , what do u think ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:03:00 ah yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:03:23 what about constructive critisism <@!262743221686370326> ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:03:40 would u rather like ancient cannons, or what ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:04:47 well yes, but u wanna put this on tanks or battleships ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:05:08 also just the breach is blocky, rest of cannon not
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:05:36 
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:06:34 > <@!670939038999511041> ehh no blocky cannons rather?
<@!713478592448823380> cant u read ? canon isnt blocky, just the breach
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:06:50 
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:06:57 my suggestion is just this part
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:07:52 > dont add cannons at all
<@!262743221686370326> well ricks gonna add them any way, so would u rather like breach block or ancient cannon ? thats the question.
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:09:06 <@!713478592448823380> why did u downvote ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:09:20 yes, but the front can be built like u want
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:09:45 its just that part at the back
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:10:09 > so there would be different barrel ends
<@!713478592448823380> u could build the barrel however u want
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:10:24 not limited in size or form or lenght
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:13:04 <@!713478592448823380> u can just add a barrel like that
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:13:31 its the breach
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:13:44 that fires stuff and goes up and down
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:14:04 and then everyone can build the rest of the cannon how he likes it
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:14:39 so its way more universal useable than a pre built canon with barrel
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:16:03 basically, yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:16:19 u can just use it more universall
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:16:22 yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:17:33 > a full version of the missile thing
<@!262743221686370326> it doesnt fire missiles, it fires cannon rounds. they are faster, but cant follow the enemy
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:18:10 > a literal brick
<@!713478592448823380> note that it can go up and down, so u dont need additional space for motors
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:23:10 <@!713478592448823380> it would be easier to program without built in motors, but it would take 3 times the space for the 1x1 breach and would be therefor harder to build
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:24:05 also u couldnt have only the front and the motorparts connect to other blocks, wich would require additional space
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:26:21 > Probably need to be less highpoly than that
<@!435817391113371668> probably, but what do u think about the idea itself to have just breach blocks instead of entire cannons ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:30:56 but i still dont understand why they did go for that 17th century cannon design when most builds in game that require cannons are warships and tanks
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:32:21 maybe rick wanna catch more lil kids
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 18:49:44 > Depends i don't know how the shell will react to blocks in front of it
<@!435817391113371668> as rockets, gunfire and fireworks dont react with the blocks of ur own build, i dont think cannonshells will do

help 2020-06-01 19:55:42 > Dunno if it was a recent update or what, but all of my 5x5 cylinders cars ride bumpy as hell now. This had recently started happening to my friend to. I took a closer look at the cylinders and they look like they are not round anymore, and only have maybe 13-17 sides. Why? What was wrong with cylinders beforehand? Why were they changed?
<@!270291665116200962>  it was probably changed for a performance improvement uptate, bcs round stuff decreases the performance massively(it never was exactly round, just a lot more sides, what ofc creates big lag)
general 2020-06-01 19:57:49 > like separate blocks such as a barrel, muzzle, chamber, etc?

plane-crazy 2020-06-02 16:39:18 tho the loss of speed by manuevering is way higher if u are above 10-12k

plane-crazy 2020-06-04 10:52:33 why cant i say this
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 10:53:14 for a plane game it happens that people build historical planes
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 10:53:27 and it happens u talk about that history
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 10:53:42 can u undo the warn ?

plane-crazy 2020-06-04 11:02:03 > someone interested will do that
<@!287459677611098114> well i built the F4 one month after i played the game for the first time, so not a lot to see
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 11:03:22 i could probably make a list of all my builds in half a hour
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 11:03:57 bcs i posted everything and just joined in the end of february
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 11:05:04 imagine playing the game for just 3 months but alredy having 14 days in game time

plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:29:03 we should really rise the requirements to join vip servers
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:29:30 like at least one expert rank

plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:30:55 
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:31:10 i dont want to see stuff like that anymore in vip1

plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:31:51 ik
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:32:00 thats why i said designer II
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:32:05 *III
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:32:35 sad thing is that expert designer is extremely hard to get nowadays
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:32:53 bcs nearly nothing gets to HoF
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:34:31 for two reasons:
1. the guys in vip general dont let a lot to HoF, and half of the stuff getting there is made by mods
2. <#384025409945337856> is spammed with fricking noob builds for some reason
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 13:36:31 i dont understand that anyways, the stuff is way to ugly to post it, yet people do it. i just dont see the point, its getting downvoted anyways, AND, thats my big problem, people just dont see the good builds

general 2020-06-10 17:16:57 wth is the point in these master ranks if vip-general and the low effort spam in <#384025409945337856> dont let anything in HoF ?
general 2020-06-10 17:21:56 <@!216193164199985152> one question : why are there vtol ranks, but no chopper ranks ? its not that hard to get for example a 4k block quadrocopter flying, but its extremely hard to get a chopper of that size flying without spaming rockets or stuff inside

general 2020-06-10 17:28:09 > <@!670939038999511041> chopper ranks exist as helicopter technician
<@!216193164199985152> but i want not one rank, but 6. no one cares about challenge ranks, and the chopper one is a joke
general 2020-06-10 17:30:19 > <@!670939038999511041> you can try suggesting a helicopter category to voxel but i honestly dont think helicopters would fit as a whole category
<@!216193164199985152> i probably will, but i think they will fit. i mean i see more choppers than all other kinds of vtols combined

plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:03:14 my problem is
i have been using conveyor engines on every single plane i built as a main engine, and i never had problems
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:03:28 lol he dumb
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:03:43 u dont need to
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:03:56 just place the conveyor engine right
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:04:28 uh
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:04:53 my 3700 block f4 uses only one simple conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:05:02 works perfect
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:05:46 my 1500 block mig 41 interpretation isnt shaking at any speeds, even at 20k
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:05:58 my flying submarine
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:06:30 maybe ur conveyor is too close to other blocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:06:51 what design do u use ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:08:13 fabric block ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:09:57 i dont have that in my conveyor
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:10:58 wait can u send pic of ur thing ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:11:07 the conveyor ur using
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:14:19 i dont see a lot
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:15:48 thats the one im using. its simple, reliable, small and can be built in nearly anywhere even in small spaces bcs of the bottom configuration(u can also take half blocks and a wing panel)
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:25:22 thrusters ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:25:32 <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:25:45 wdym
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:26:09 do u mena hover drive ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:26:43 do u mean
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:26:48 super rocket
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:27:28 there are no fricking thrusters except hover thruster
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:27:45 just fking say how its called in game
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:28:35 what sht are u talking ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:28:58 > there are no fricking thrusters except hover thruster
.
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:29:37 hover drives are weak
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:29:50 yes they are
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:30:44 man
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:31:15 they are weaker, have less top speed and a bit worse acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:31:21 why would u use them
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:32:31 why tf would u want to go 100sps with a 1 or 9k block creation
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:32:48 with server slowing down thats slower than walking
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:33:10 medaphore ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:33:49 do u mean metaphor ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:34:48 well than its a bad one
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:34:59 bcs u can do that with conveyor too
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:36:31 > bcs u can do that with conveyor too
.
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:37:13 also hover needs more space and blocks than conveyor
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:38:06 so hover needs more space+blocks, is slower and weaker, where is the point in it ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:38:52 > why use conveyor when you can use thrusters
<@456226577798135808> than why tf do u wanna use it ?!
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:39:31 u just said its worse
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:39:40 but before
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:39:45 u said
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:39:55 this
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:40:32 but u cant fricking hover with a hover drive
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:41:09 im speaking about hover and conveyor drives dummi
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:42:25 how are u supposed to hover with something like that
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:42:57 but than u cant use it for forward motion
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:43:56 ^
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:45:09 lemme tell u something
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:45:17 if u wanna hover
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:45:21 and go fast
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:45:52 just put hovers on a build with conveyor engine <:thoink:657279634563399720>
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 08:46:34 theen where is the fricking point in using hover drive over conveyor drive man ?!

plane-crazy 2020-06-13 12:53:03 people should only use the downvote button when a build is really low effort/ not worth posting etc.
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 12:53:08 imo
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 12:53:22 but gonna be hard to convince people
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 12:55:05 what should i say....
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 12:55:27 just search for the oldest thing that mentions me
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 12:55:37 it was hell

general 2020-06-13 23:10:52 no
general 2020-06-13 23:11:41 they dont use a iron cross with that form on a red background in the bundeswehr
general 2020-06-13 23:11:54 wth is wrong with u
general 2020-06-13 23:13:35 what is wrong with u
general 2020-06-13 23:13:41 also
general 2020-06-13 23:14:33 why do animes like gup glorify nzis and other bad stuff like that
general 2020-06-13 23:14:40 seriosly
general 2020-06-13 23:14:53 what is going wrong there
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 23:15:53 uh
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 23:15:59 idk man
general 2020-06-13 23:17:51 a iron cross that is rounded like that hasnt been used since wwII, especially not on a red background, so we got some nzi stuff here
general 2020-06-13 23:18:09 and i dont wanna see that without historical context
general 2020-06-13 23:18:23 and here we clearly dont have historical context
general 2020-06-13 23:19:19 delete that better now
general 2020-06-13 23:20:23 still waiting for an answer
general 2020-06-13 23:20:54 not talking about the skin
general 2020-06-13 23:21:26 but the anime makes all war factions seem like harmless stuff
general 2020-06-13 23:21:47 wich can have a bad influence on not so educated kids
general 2020-06-13 23:22:05 lemme explain
general 2020-06-13 23:24:47 if a kid sees that anime it sees these uniforms, and connect them with good emotions like fun in its brain. that will later be a problem, bcs its gonna be hard to teach that kids how it really was, bcs they are biased. that will lead to adults that dont take some problems as seriosly as they should, and we all know to what problems that leads
general 2020-06-13 23:26:58 the affect may seem not really big, but psychlogically even something as simple as a anime can do a lot to a kid if thats the first thing it cnnects to a topic
general 2020-06-13 23:27:25 le internet
general 2020-06-13 23:28:37 ive only seen scenes, but im pretty sure it wont teach people that wwII was anything but good
general 2020-06-13 23:29:58 > it just girls in a school fighting each other in a tanks
<@!409676438682206218> again, it seems so simple and harmless, but a kid can be influenced extremely easy
general 2020-06-13 23:32:42 the problem is the psychology in the background. no kid will actively do something for it, yet somewhere back in there mind there will be a conection between certain uniforms, symbols and stuff with good emotiones, what will make them biased later on. this is not a active process, the kid cant really do a lot about it, its just how things work
general 2020-06-13 23:33:17 yes
general 2020-06-13 23:33:29 so they wont take it serios later on
general 2020-06-13 23:34:11 they will be like " that cant have been all that bad"
general 2020-06-13 23:35:02 and when there is something like that irl again, they will be like "it wont be that bad" wich can be a big problem
general 2020-06-13 23:35:37 its not so much about the tanks, these are just machines
general 2020-06-13 23:36:08 but they will like some charakters that wear uniforms and symbols

plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:24:22 it may be done if mad helps rick, but it isnt very likely
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:25:00 and that still doesnt explain why u suggest this without knowing what u speak about
creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:30:17 its just not built good enough for HoF, and #vip-general being... uhh
creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:30:28 wait

creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:31:32 but master ranks are below contest
creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:32:12 ik, but it always says "contest winner+ ranks"
creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:32:30 le oof
creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:32:45 tell them master rank should get access
creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:32:57 i mean its harder to get than contest winner

plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:42:26 only 3 times ? u sure ?
bot-central 2020-06-20 16:43:43 is that a roblox game ?
creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:45:18 do u really think u have a chance to get in HoF ?
creations-chat 2020-06-20 16:45:44 vip-general is...
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:48:09 <@!609198621526589450> why dont u like chopper ranks ? whats wrong with them ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:49:19 wth
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:49:31 dont u read the suggestion man ?!
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:49:35 u dumb ?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:50:26 explain me how to get a 4k block chopper flying without helium, gravity or rocket engines
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:50:58 man
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:51:08 have u ever made a chopper
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:51:19 thats a bit bigger
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:52:07 1. at some point blades fly away bcs of centrifugal force
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:52:19 (when rpm is too high)
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:53:15 2. even with the highest possible rpm, u lack lifting power
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:54:02 i had a coaxial swashplate with plot diamenter  8 blades, it already struggled to lift at 1k blocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:54:41 if u have no idea about the game and how big choppers behave, dont downvote
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 16:54:44 <@!609198621526589450>
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 17:21:37 <@!609198621526589450> why tf would i use blocks on blade tips ?! i use wooden control surfaces, thats the lightest thing that **generates lift**
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 17:22:06 u clearly have no idea of choppers
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 17:22:50 <@!386561321422028800> *game is hardcored*

plane-crazy 2020-06-20 19:35:02 man
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 19:35:26 1. that does nearly nothing
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 19:35:49 2. u can only use it for normal blocks, and i only use few of them
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 19:36:49 3. u still have no idea what ur talking about, just show me a chopper with 4k blocks that can lift of the ground
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 19:37:36 u can build a 4k block box with u ballast block and than i wanna see how u get it of the ground with just one swashplate

the-dump 2020-06-30 17:48:06 it was

plane-crazy 2020-06-30 20:05:05 so people can choose what they want

plane-crazy 2020-06-30 20:10:35 we could have a vote in <#529858892075761694> on what cannon version people like:
a) more detailed pirate cannon
b) simpler pirate cannon
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 20:10:54 c) breech blocks and cannon barrel blocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 20:11:08 and maybe more options

plane-crazy 2020-06-30 20:13:30 <@!370594904268734464> to explain it : a breech is the "root of a cannon" that is loaded from the back
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 20:13:57 
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 20:14:07 well

plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:35:11 this game is called PLANE crazy
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 17:35:53 it would probably take less time to softcode the game than to implement all that stuff

plane-crazy 2020-07-07 12:44:31 and both sides are symetrical

general 2020-07-10 22:19:32 middle scale is the easiest

general 2020-07-10 22:23:13 > motor locking the fucking rockets
<@!352928457358835715> they are mainly to counter coriolisforce, wich is huge when ur rotor has nearly 2 plots diameter
general 2020-07-10 22:29:28 its not extremely advanced
general 2020-07-10 22:29:32 its hax
general 2020-07-10 22:30:43 > The build doesn’t look like a build until it’s motor locked: **ADVANCED**
well yes

plane-crazy 2020-07-11 13:54:00 no
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 13:54:27 the drag in pc is way too high bcs only wings have it
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 13:54:40 and its the thing that makes big stuff fall slow
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 13:55:02 according to sakura only one variable needs to be removed
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 13:55:11 and it would reduce lag a lot
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 13:55:55 also drag adds to coriolis force
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 13:57:28 stuff will still fly normal
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 13:57:37 sakura tested it
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 13:57:40 with hax

plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:09:30 > i do have to agree though, that building something from real life/modern society and then just putting some dystopian/post-apocalyptic backstory onto it shouldn't really be allowed for this contest. not saying it isn't a good build
<@!339519624968404993> 
1. its a pretty dystopian looking thing just by itself
2. i wanted to put spikes and fences and steel plates and stuff, but that would have looked dumb
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:09:49 its soviet
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:09:52 also
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:10:43 > how does this look dystopian tho

 tonks
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:49:27 smh all my big builds somewhat failed in pcc
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:50:31 my F4, sci fi mig 41, my project 641 sub, my 9 harriers and my mi 24 were all for contest
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:50:44 the only kinda succesfull were the harriers
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:50:51 but it was a team contest
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:51:55 im just kinda dissapointed at the vote performance
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:52:02 especially on my mi24
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:52:07 and my F4 back then
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:52:23 what
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:52:36 even that shitty pod racer performes better
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:52:43 😢
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:53:31 if people would just care about the build itself
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:54:00 wich one ?
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:54:06 the hoverbike
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:54:21 the thing is
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:54:27 thats just for team contest
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:56:17 the hoverbike is everything but bad
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:56:33 but is it really so much better then mine
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:56:35 cri
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:57:09 i probably wont even post it in creations
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:57:17 it would just dissappoint me
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:57:54 > idk, i slightly prefer the podracer because it's more detailed and more interesting colour scheme
<@!339519624968404993> the colour ok... thats ur opinion 
but more detailed ?!
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:59:33 more detailed....
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 13:59:45 thats my last contest for now
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 14:01:33 > probably would've done better if you weathered it down more/showed its age
<@!335599526414909451> thats the sun on that pic

u can see the colours better here
plane-crazy 2020-07-13 14:02:52 "can even climb"

plane-crazy 2020-07-14 14:14:43 > yeah, thats what i said
<@!315207053343719425> but why cant u just not vote at all ? go to minecraft if u dont like smooth things. there is a reason we have wedges. this game tries to be realistic
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 14:15:57 > mf arguing over 1 downvote <:pain:644301805534183464>

plane-crazy 2020-07-14 14:16:58 and thats pretty unlikely to happen
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 14:18:19 <@!724461096349728824> only themotolocc pic would have enough upvotes then, and that wont get to HoF for sure

plane-crazy 2020-07-14 15:17:56 ok
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 15:18:48 it is blocky, not matching the original in any way, the colour is boring and not fitting, it is low effort, and it has been done so often before

plane-crazy 2020-07-14 15:19:36 oh

general 2020-07-15 16:55:27 obc lost admin
general 2020-07-15 16:55:57 why

and why is there slowmode here
general 2020-07-15 17:11:02 i can imagine rick is just a bit toxic bcs he has too much work and mad wont help him anymore(or maybe something irl). its not the fault of him or anyone here, but i really think he needs to make a proper dev team. i am sure there are people that would do that good and for free.

the other problem is pcc. the toxity is growing with the community, and i feel like people behave less and less adult. on the other hand, people like me get toxic by that behaivior.
there are a lot of problems we have to face, and it wont be a easy time. we better start early.
i dont have a solution at the moment, but i am sure if we work together, we can find one. 

while withdrawing from the staff team might be a powerfull sign to rick, it will make problems only worse over time. 

**We need everyone now.**
general 2020-07-15 17:15:09 > <@!670939038999511041> Rick has had ***AMPLE*** chances to stop this from happening, it's been ***MONTHS*** with ***TENS*** of squabbles over the same shit
<@!195253906333368320> while this is pretty sad, rick is just a human. we dont know if its just him or if he has other problems that make him like that. we should really try to look more for him, so we can know whats the best for him and us.
if i could, i would really make often long vc sessions with rick and the staff to talk about all problems and properly solve them

plane-crazy 2020-07-15 18:18:17 > as i said he isnt rewriting alone
<@!216193164199985152> we know, but he has just people helping out with him doing the biggest part of the work
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 18:19:50 he is doing the main work

<@!216193164199985152> i know, i am not dumb, but it would be really helpfull if rick was telling us regulary in <#490306593242611742> what the momentary situation is in detail
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 18:26:25 or in <#529858892075761694>

<@456226577798135808> i know, idra also
general 2020-07-16 12:33:45 why then
general 2020-07-16 12:34:25 uh
general 2020-07-16 12:34:38 there are many people at that age here
bug-reports 2020-07-16 12:39:34 > thats because of the ropes, not the suspension <@!492887853702053898>
<@!217336009455566848> nope, its if u put too much stress on the motors so they bend
suspension and ropes just makes it more likely to happen, put it also occurs with neither of them
bug-reports 2020-07-16 12:40:44 i may try around, maybe making the motors powered+locked could help
bug-reports 2020-07-16 12:41:50 but in my experience its helping the most to limit the range the wheel can travel by putting blocks above it

plane-crazy 2020-07-16 17:50:24 why does it have to use wheels ?
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 17:51:04 according to that miners rocket crawler thing wouldnt count as land vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 17:51:19 also what about tracks
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 17:51:41 it has no real tracks
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 17:51:57 i think it should be just moving on the ground
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 17:52:45 also chopper ranks when
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 17:54:12 > vtol rank ?
<@!723419054114865202> i think i have made the only helicopter in pcc that hs even enough blocks to get master rank
its way harder to get a big chopper flying than any other vtol
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 17:55:20 no
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 17:55:30 chopper rank would have lower block count

plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:53:41 > <@!670939038999511041>  I kinda doubt it
<@!733931029890596943> noob
1 block = 1 meter

diameter of the real a380s body: around 5-6 meters
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:53:55 this a380
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:54:13 has like 16 block diameter
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:55:24 what scale ?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:56:13 <:wot:695654208837255219>
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:57:22 > 2 blocks = 1 meter
<@!283153622496182274> ah yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:57:33 robloxians are 4 meters high
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:57:37 in ur mind
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:57:39 lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:58:43 the average human is about 1.7 meters high
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:58:54 so blocks are actually less than 1m
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:58:59 but to make it easy
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:59:10 whe just say a robloxian is 2 meters high
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:59:30 and a robloxian is 2 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:59:31 so
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:59:52 > r6 character is 1 meter i am mean

plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:00:11 and dont know what a meter is
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:02:36 robloxian = human

1 block = about 85 cm
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:03:04 really short
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:03:13 i mean
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:03:37 average western male is going to 1.80 meters+
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:03:52 2 meters is often seen nowadays
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 12:04:01 at least where i live

plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:00:36 there is probably no helicopter even close to this size
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:01:23 remember
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:01:46 a true helicopters only source of lift and motion is the main rotor
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:02:13 my main rotor has the diameter of about 1.8 plots
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:02:28 > aNd RoCkEtS
<@!417397161198878731> no
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:02:59 rockets only for countering rotor torque and coriolis force and for yaw, pitch and roll
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:03:35 that wouldnt be a helicopter
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:04:19 this is the only other thing that got master VTOL
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:04:51 and that is the only other helicopter in HoF
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:05:24 its a gif i cant copy

plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:07:20 i cant adjust main rotor blade pitch while rotor is moving
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:07:29 bcs moto is bad
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:07:58 wait how does sakura have 2 vtol ranks
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:08:16 > If u shot ur tail off would u go into a flat spin
<@!417397161198878731> depending on where u shoot it off
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:08:30 the tail rotor itself isnt doing anything
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:08:40 would be way too weak
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:08:58 the job is done by about 300 super rockets in the front and tail
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:09:07 no
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:09:10 even more
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 18:09:14 about 500

general 2020-08-08 18:30:42 also it was planned to be 100 megatons, but they made it smaller bcs they feared it might do too much
general 2020-08-08 18:30:57 > tsar bomb could flatten the whole of london
most nukes could
general 2020-08-08 18:31:28 thats radioactive contamination

creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:09:48 
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:10:04 i think that should be enforced better
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:10:14 especially the WIP point
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:10:41 <#533294912586645521>

creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:13:13 use youtube, streamable, mp4,...
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:13:23 .wmv can easily be abused
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:13:31 so its banned on pcc
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:15:57 > Does .mp4 provide better video quality/better data compression?
im not sure, but it can be watched without downloading. 
a .wmv on the other hand has to be downloaded to be watched and can therefore easily be abused for ip grabs, malware, viruses, etc.
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:16:12 > Are people saying that WIP things cannot be placed in creations-chat?
<@!311638025308209154> its the rules
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:16:22 and they are here for a good reason
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:16:50 is there anything not clear about that ?
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:18:53 u can post pictures of WIP creations in <#504436696021204992> , <#384021699466756107> and <#478584971670454284> , but **not in <#384025409945337856> **
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:19:17 its pretty clearly stated in the rules
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:19:23 so i wonder why he asked
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:19:59 it does
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:21:09 if thats not clear enough for someone

we should seriously question if that someone is allowed here
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:22:03 thats why i said the rule should be enforced harder earlier
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:22:54 its clear enough
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:23:02 its just not enforced enough
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:23:10 thats a big difference
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:23:51 just bcs the chance the police catches u on a crime is low u still shouldnt comit it
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:24:41 > i dont even know what misinterpret means
if u understand something wrong
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:25:10 misinterpret isnt really that much of an english word
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:25:41 in slight variations its used in a lot of languages as its coming from the latin language
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:26:11 its missinterpretieren in german
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:26:18 thats not a far way
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:26:34 what
creations-chat 2020-08-09 00:27:44 > Not creation discussion
its the explanation of a word occuring in a discoussion on <#384025409945337856> , so it belongs right here

general 2020-08-09 10:20:20 so did i
general 2020-08-09 10:20:44 i mean is it a build or a meme contest ?

<@!216193164199985152> the asu is a meme, the a40 is a meme, if u combine both and make it swim u got a even better meme
general 2020-08-09 10:27:40 hyper
general 2020-08-09 10:28:44 the asu is a meme bcs of how its used in the game war thunder
the a40 flying tank is a meme bcs its...   ...well... ...a flying tank
general 2020-08-09 10:29:14 but it didnt really work
general 2020-08-09 10:29:32 > yes and its one of the dumbest concepts ever
thats why
general 2020-08-09 10:30:58 > but calling rbk's creation a "meme" that deserves to be downvoted on is unfair
<@!216193164199985152> i normally would even upvote it if it was in <#384025409945337856> , but the contest should be about what is the best build, and people clearly upvoted the aasu bcs it made them laugh
general 2020-08-09 10:31:41 u can tell there are better builds in this contest
general 2020-08-09 10:32:18 i just dont want again a contest where not the best, but the most mematic build wins
general 2020-08-09 10:33:05 u cant tell me rbk didnt had the meme factor in mind
general 2020-08-09 10:33:26 also he already won a contest, so it isnt that bad for him if he doesnt win
general 2020-08-09 10:34:20 on the other hand other people invested a lot of time and effort to build something great, yet they get beaten by something mematic

hyperbit saying rbks aasu isnt a meme and not understanding why i dont want it to win
general 2020-08-09 10:41:29 ^
general 2020-08-09 10:41:42 it should be about how good a build is
general 2020-08-09 10:42:15 ye
general 2020-08-09 10:42:18 i mean
general 2020-08-09 10:43:00 if there isnt a topic i am really really interested in i wont take part in a contest anytime soon
general 2020-08-09 10:44:37 problem imo is that contest are often not won by how good a build is, but by meme factors and bias towards certain people
general 2020-08-09 10:45:39 bcs
general 2020-08-09 10:45:41 yes
general 2020-08-09 10:46:11 fair enough that was a internet contest so it was in the right place there
general 2020-08-09 10:48:10 also there maybe should be a channel where u can suggest contest topics
general 2020-08-09 12:15:38 a game
general 2020-08-09 12:15:59 it seemed kinda boring to me

plane-crazy 2020-08-09 19:00:11 guys there is a place where its still the winter update
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 19:02:49 explain
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 19:03:27 but only for test server i think
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 19:03:33 and u have limited time
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 19:03:39 before u get kicked
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 19:04:08 idk

plane-crazy 2020-08-09 19:07:29 u can do it too
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 19:07:36 just join a test server
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 19:07:44 and then join pvp mode
bug-reports 2020-08-09 19:15:50 <@!563706357518303243> please dont use a .wmv and delete it as it easily can be abused
use a mp4, youtube or streamable.com instead
bug-reports 2020-08-09 19:18:03 it has already been said here one time, but i think rick didnt see it : if u join the pvp server in the testing place, u get teleported to a place called "rickje's place 85", where the winter update is still in place. after some time u get kicked.
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 19:19:04 <#498473314445033472> if u wanna get some winter event items in test server
plane-crazy 2020-08-09 19:20:47 i have throttle 2.4% or lower when i spawn my mi24

plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:03:14 german moment

plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:05:23 when puris tank doesnt make it to hof, how should mine even have a chance
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:05:51 imagine ERA on addon armour package
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:06:09 imagine not being in hof
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:06:47 is that the bridge thingy in london
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:07:09 is it for contest
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:07:12 ah
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:07:45 the moment when u have miner in ur team
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:08:19 u gonna see
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:08:23 <:SoonTM:501066468629413916>
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:13:46 wdym
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:14:09 correct options
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:14:29 what stuff
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:14:57 like what u can build and do or what
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:15:23 fix motor 2
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:15:38 and finally add breech block and cannon
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:16:27 no
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:18:36 also acivity wanna take part in the contest ?
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:18:53 > Guess i must just choose what needs to be in the next update myself😎
no no
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:19:07 add breech block and different barrle blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:19:20 so everyone gets something he likes regarding cannons
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:19:46 also a invisible block without collission would be nice
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:20:11 ~~and a new map~~
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:21:19 > could try using text blocks
text block only connects to one side, thats often a problem
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:21:39 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:22:23 invisible non collission block shouldnt be that hard to programm
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:22:36 but give it a appearance in build mode
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:23:11 like grey block that is 0.5x0.5x0.5 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:24:01 also if u dont add breech and barrle blocks
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:24:18 no collission is important part
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:24:42 and a small cylinder would be nice
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:24:53 like 0.5 or 0.25 diameter
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:25:16 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:25:29 *also i dont have sparkler*
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:26:30 have u ever tried to make a small barrell
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:26:35 that looks good
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:26:54 oh one more idea
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:27:06 wait i need to comit google translate
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:27:33 a hinge motor
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:27:48 no no
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:28:38 something like that with powered motor in middle but in a 1x1 block space
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:29:05 make one side bigger that connects to 3 sides like a control surface
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:29:17 and the other side only connects to one side
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:29:26 that would be extremely usefull
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:29:40 controls would be like normal motor
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:29:55 maybe without lock option to dont make it buggy
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:30:30 powered+locked is buggy
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:30:40 only powered or only locked is not
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:31:09 but we dont know in wich way the compression would affect it
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:31:14 but anyways
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:31:27 would such a hinge motor block be doable ?
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:32:15 i would try to take a motor and just change its model and connection points
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:32:55 like base it on the motor so it isnt that much work
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:34:18 it would be extremely usefull for all kind of stuff, from folding and doors to tank treads and complex mechanics
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:36:31 so wishlist is :
-breech- and barrel blocks/cannon
-invisible non collission block
-0.5 or 0.25 radius cylinder
-hinge motor
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:36:47 ~~and new map~~
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:37:00 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:37:05 sad but true

bcs actually cannons dont look good
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:45:54 <@!723419054114865202> why
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:46:06 yellow
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:46:26 looks like
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:46:38 no
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:46:40 its hao
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 17:47:19 he still has verify code
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:28:56 to clear things up for u
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:29:41 u can watch a video several times, but only like or dislike one time
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:30:29 for the statistics youtube needs to check if u have watched the video before
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:30:40 that takes a bit of time
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:31:04 while the like will be showed instantly, the views wont for that reason
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:36:17 magnets are the most laggy block
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:38:02 turret needs too be higher
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:38:19 and bigger overall compared to gun
general 2020-08-11 18:44:48 demoted moment
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:45:54 but make the turret a bit higher
plane-crazy 2020-08-11 18:46:02 to get dimensions right

creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:06:25 could be hard to implement, causing lag and be used for nsfw stuff
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:06:49 due to the last point we wont get it for sure as long as there is no in game moderation
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:07:19 also u can use emojis
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:07:37 and i dont see why it would be worth it to implement that
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:08:23 there is no moderation at all and there wont be any anytime soon
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:08:31 so

creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:13:42 👍
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:15:16 so the flaws for u are that u cant put nudes on ur plane crazy house ?
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:16:47 u just wanted something unrealistic without great use and u know nothing about the game and its development
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:17:00 read
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:17:05 rick is too busy

creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:25:35 and we dont have any ingame moderation
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:26:14 not to mention rickje would have to spend a lot of time on something not really needed
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:27:19 rick is working mostly on bug fixes and rewrite as far as im concerned, and some people like acivity help him
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:27:32 acivity asked for ideas for next update lately

general 2020-08-15 21:25:58 at least thats what a lot of russian tanks and for example the kpz 70 do
general 2020-08-15 21:27:06 armored is american english and armoured british
general 2020-08-15 21:27:10 i believe
general 2020-08-15 21:27:39 but thats not a mbt
general 2020-08-15 21:27:47 a lot of ifvs have that
general 2020-08-15 21:28:18 ifv is infantry fighting vehicle
general 2020-08-15 21:28:54 ik this thing
general 2020-08-15 21:28:58 it looks ugly
general 2020-08-15 21:29:26 > thats just a buffed up amx 10rc
<@!310863132727836672> nooo
general 2020-08-15 21:29:52 the amx 10 cr is a td
general 2020-08-15 21:30:01 wheeled tank destroyer
general 2020-08-15 21:30:07 yes
general 2020-08-15 21:30:45 it is a tank destroyer
general 2020-08-15 21:32:24 <:wot:695654208837255219>
general 2020-08-15 21:32:43 > and wheel allow fast offroad
thats a big facepalm moment
general 2020-08-15 21:33:02 wheels are fast on road
general 2020-08-15 21:33:07 but not offroad
general 2020-08-15 21:33:41 bruh
general 2020-08-15 21:33:58 where is ur brain
general 2020-08-15 21:34:24 when u want something armoured to go fast offroad, u give it tracks
general 2020-08-15 21:34:32 bcs of ground pressure
general 2020-08-15 21:34:55 if u want it to go fast on roads, u give it wheels
general 2020-08-15 21:38:49 this is the amx 10 rc (wheeled)
general 2020-08-15 21:39:04 and this the k2 (tracked, mbt)
general 2020-08-15 21:39:17 look at cross country
general 2020-08-15 21:39:38 
general 2020-08-15 21:39:44 u are a bruh moment
general 2020-08-15 21:40:56 its cheaper, smaller and more quiet
general 2020-08-15 21:41:28 that isnt a scout tank
general 2020-08-15 21:41:41 its a cheap alternative to a mbt
general 2020-08-15 21:41:54 bcs argentinia doesnt have much money
general 2020-08-15 21:42:47 that doesnt matter
general 2020-08-15 21:43:22 its about the noise protection
general 2020-08-15 21:43:38 just compare how loud a luchs is compared to a leo
general 2020-08-15 21:43:53 tracks are also louder than tires
general 2020-08-15 21:44:04 not the ww2 thing
general 2020-08-15 21:44:08 facepalm moment
general 2020-08-15 21:46:18 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrDt9S0MovE&t=90s
general 2020-08-15 21:46:21 compare that
general 2020-08-15 21:47:13 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMbSfHGCrGU to that
general 2020-08-15 21:47:34 
general 2020-08-15 21:47:41 u are supposed to compare noise
general 2020-08-15 21:47:56 tracks are way louder
general 2020-08-15 21:48:09 bcs its more quiet
general 2020-08-15 21:48:11 idiot
general 2020-08-15 21:48:43 <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
general 2020-08-15 21:48:53 we talking about real life
general 2020-08-15 21:49:27 when a luchs(first vid) is in quiet mode, its barely even louder than a person walking
general 2020-08-15 21:49:38 while tracks are always loud
general 2020-08-15 21:50:08 bruh
general 2020-08-15 21:50:20 it does on a scouting tank
general 2020-08-15 21:50:26 u need to drive
general 2020-08-15 21:50:31 where is ur brain
general 2020-08-15 21:52:53 also what if u dont have air superiority yet bcs u want to make a quiet advance in enemy territory
general 2020-08-15 21:53:39 > <@!670939038999511041> those american drone things dont make much noise doe
<@!310863132727836672> but are radar detected and shot down
general 2020-08-15 21:53:56 also most scout tanks are from the 70s or earlier
general 2020-08-15 21:54:12 wut
general 2020-08-15 21:54:58 if u have a war against taliban a IFV is more usefull than a mbt sometimes
general 2020-08-15 21:55:24 scout tanks are coming from the 2nd world war and the cold war
general 2020-08-15 21:55:37 where there would have been huge battles
general 2020-08-15 21:55:58 u are just talking beside the point
general 2020-08-15 21:56:33 u stated that wheeled vehicles would be faster offroad
general 2020-08-15 21:56:44 i explained u that thats wrong
general 2020-08-15 21:56:57 u wondered why even make wheeled vehicles then
general 2020-08-15 21:57:07 i explained half a hour why
general 2020-08-15 21:57:25 they are still not faster offroad
general 2020-08-15 21:57:41 bcs they still are pretty heavy
general 2020-08-15 21:57:51 and offroad ground pressure matters a lot
general 2020-08-15 21:58:48 its not just about being stuck
general 2020-08-15 21:58:54 its about tracktion
general 2020-08-15 22:01:56 lol thats top gear
general 2020-08-15 22:01:59 also
general 2020-08-15 22:02:22 challenger is one of the slowest mbts and a land rover not armoured
general 2020-08-15 22:02:47 if u want to use a land rover to scout
general 2020-08-15 22:03:05 u could also just use a motorcycle
general 2020-08-15 22:03:40 yes noise
general 2020-08-15 22:04:20 discoussion was about mbts vs wheeled tanks
general 2020-08-15 22:04:26 land rover is wrong here
general 2020-08-15 22:05:10 at some point the brits could also just buy the leo
general 2020-08-15 22:05:13 its better
general 2020-08-15 22:05:27 ik
general 2020-08-15 22:05:47 thats gonna take a lot of time till then tho
general 2020-08-15 22:05:59 but they already made the embt
general 2020-08-15 22:06:10 l/55
general 2020-08-15 22:06:13 not 44
general 2020-08-15 22:06:22 44 outdated
general 2020-08-15 22:06:24 oh

general 2020-08-15 22:07:54 cryo what are u even talking about
general 2020-08-15 22:08:10 but why
general 2020-08-15 22:08:46 ah yes
general 2020-08-15 22:08:48 so
general 2020-08-15 22:09:33 brits dont buy german stuff bcs "germany" did bad stuff to them 80 years ago
general 2020-08-15 22:09:56 technically it isnt even the same country anymore
general 2020-08-15 22:10:33 and u quit bcs u love to ruin ur economy
general 2020-08-15 22:11:19 germany may pay the most to the eu, but its profiting by far the most
general 2020-08-15 22:11:51 anyways
general 2020-08-15 22:12:46 what is nk
general 2020-08-15 22:12:57 ah
general 2020-08-15 22:12:59 anyways
general 2020-08-15 22:13:05 lets go back to
general 2020-08-15 22:13:20 better challenger
general 2020-08-15 22:14:42 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8Sa_q-Lz6g shorter better vid
general 2020-08-15 22:15:28 but its a better challenger

general 2020-08-17 15:55:24 what the
general 2020-08-17 15:56:00 imo it should be in school like it was for me before holiday
general 2020-08-17 15:56:09 we had half classes
general 2020-08-17 15:56:21 and only every 2nd week
general 2020-08-17 15:56:42 with masks everywhere but in classrooms
general 2020-08-17 15:56:46 lol
general 2020-08-17 15:56:55 i still have 3 weeks of holiday
general 2020-08-17 15:57:59 wut
general 2020-08-17 15:58:46 > It should be like only teacher can have them off while teaching not **EVERYONE CAN**
<@!448505589983739914> u know simple masks mainly protect others, not yourself

that means it would be safer if only the teacher has the mask as only the teacher speaks
general 2020-08-17 15:59:41 > Everyone is talking
<@!448505589983739914> not if u have only half classes with 2 meters between everyone
general 2020-08-17 16:00:01 also the people talking normally meet each other outside of school without mask
general 2020-08-17 16:00:31 > My class don't have 2 meter distance
well there we have the problem
general 2020-08-17 16:01:37 half of the pupils stay at home while the other half goes to school
general 2020-08-17 16:01:52 halfs change every week
general 2020-08-17 16:02:24 thats bad idea
general 2020-08-17 16:03:37 ~~i dont have one~~
general 2020-08-17 16:04:53 >  same for our area. We only have had a total of 22 cases, but our school has direct contact with a city that has been plagued

the-dump 2020-08-19 19:32:35 The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't, by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance sub-system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position where it was, is now the position that it isn't. In the event of the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has required a variation. The variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too, may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computance scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is, however it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subracts where it should be, from where it wasn't, or vice versa. By differentiating this from the algebraic sum og where it shouldn't be, and where it was. It is able to obtain a deviation, and a variation, which is called "air"

general 2020-08-19 22:45:03 224jay's guide on how to: search & destroy undes
(Comes from my experiences)

1. Identifying unde
You can suspect users who applies to these standards as an unde:
- uses image of their roblox / minecraft character for pfp.
- shitty builds, high ego.
- often spams "XD" unironically.
- mostly unranked.
- has "YT", "Gaming", "TV" in their username.
- frequent grammar mistakes.

2. Checking their real age.
 The suspected "unde" user can be either an actual unde, or a manchild with a mental age of 7 year old's.
You can either:
-Pursue them to send screenshot of birthday set in settings > account info.
About 50% of them will send it, and other half will most likely refuse sending it, saying you're not a mod and you have no perms to ask for an info.
You can either:
-continue pursuing.
-ping the chat moderators, and ask them to pursue instead. (There is high chance of chat moderators ignoring it, but once they start pursuing, things will go much easier.)

3. Result
-If the user turns out to be an unde: grab popcorn, ping mod, watch them undes vanish to outer space.
-If the user turns out to be 13+ manchild: it do be bruh moment doe.
-If the user refuses sending screenshot and chat mods ignore it: Yeah. Worst scenario.

general 2020-08-24 00:21:18 <@!356853573197496331> its not the mods that decide wheter u get in hof or not, there is a second voting in #vip-lounge where u have to get a score(upvotes-downvotes) of 10 within 24 hours. that vote often fails due to most people that have #vip-lounge access (contest winner+ rank required) being inactive members that got modeller or inventor rank a long time back when they have been somewhat easy to get.
general 2020-08-24 00:22:25 the problem is that basically the only way to get access is winning a contest(team contest doesnt count), wich is pretty limited by the number, topics and voters behaivior for contests
general 2020-08-24 00:23:35 for some reason obc denied making giving people that got to hof #vip-lounge access with the reason of modeller rank vote, but uh
general 2020-08-24 00:23:40 how can i say it
general 2020-08-24 00:24:26 modeler has nothing to do with modeling something from rl in pc anymore, its just wether the person gets access or not
general 2020-08-24 00:25:16 build something really good, new and original
general 2020-08-24 00:26:08 my mi24 most likely just got to hof bcs there has bever been a helicopter anthing near of its size and detail

<@!689894917207883853> im sorry, but ur thing wont even get anywhere near to 60 upvotes, and for a hof vote it would just get tons of downvotes

plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:17:25 this
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:17:28 or this
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:17:39 or restart from scratch
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:26:03 <@!723419054114865202> concorde needs to land at such an angle so its slow enough to land on normal airports bcs the wings dont really produce lift at slow speeds
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:26:15 and droop snoot is so pilots see runway
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:26:43 swept wing planes on the other hand have enough lift to land at normal angles
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:27:30 
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:27:46 ik
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:27:56 that was the second version
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:28:09 bcs swept wings would have been too heavy and complex
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:28:37 tu160 still looks better
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:29:10 it cant
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:29:14 it doesnt need to
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:29:18 as i explained
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:29:25 the what
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:29:36 they made something wrong there
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:30:20 u only really need a droop snoop on planes with a configuration similiar to the concorde
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:30:48 ~~but if u have a good and working droop snoop u will win contest~~
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:33:08 
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:33:21 one of the best looking planes ever built

change my mind
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:33:50 but not as smooth
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:34:21 f22 and f35 look bad imo
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:35:07 ho 229 looks great also
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:35:24 nah
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:35:32 i mean like
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:36:01 nose is so wide, and it kinda doesnt fit the straight delta wing
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:36:07 eurofighter looks better
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:38:11 i mean like
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:39:01 this part on the f35 actually doesnt look that bad
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:39:03 but
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:39:13 its just too short and fat
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 12:40:43 american planes smol

general 2020-09-03 23:36:56 <@!401780773058772992> forgot to tell u that, but the last pcbc was kinda dissapointing from the builds, most seemed not only really outdated, but also rather average than good. maybe u should really check out <#384025409945337856>  here often and ask people with really good builds.
also, take more time per build and therefor less builds. some only had few seconds
general 2020-09-03 23:38:09 smh
general 2020-09-03 23:38:24 if u wanna swear on mw

general 2020-09-03 23:43:40 > my br0 i have builds that are 2-4 months old before the video comes out. i also stick to the people who apply because i have more info and i dont wanna be a male pp like troll
first of all as i said, they are outdated for a reason, but they never have been really good. i dont wanna say anything against ur choices, but ur quality in terms of filming and editing deserve better builds. u wont seem like a troll if u ask people if they would want to be in ur video, on the opposite, bcs u take so much time and effort for ur videos it would rather be a honour for people
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 23:52:22 > he is talking about amount of people that use motorlock
<@!588596347272167456> but why
plane-crazy 2020-09-03 23:54:09 <@!697644943916662834> its not possible to make the plot size bigger due to the way the game is programmed. the save data increase was a thing done by roblox itself, not by rick

plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:05:29 <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:06:22 i was literally this part but less smooth before the contest started
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:06:31 i fully reworked it
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:06:42 i could have also started from scratch
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:06:48 wouldnt have changed much
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:07:32 > bc of the fact that old builds are not allowed
<@!495822777224396811> i asked puri or some other mod u idiot
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:08:07 <@!495822777224396811> that should be clear for anyone with a brain
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:08:29 <@!495822777224396811> no
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:09:55 idiot accusing me of cheating on contest and talking shit about me
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:10:25 haemen
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:11:07 it should be pretty clear to anyone with a brain that i asked a mod before
otherwise it wouldnt have ended up in #contest-creations
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:12:28 it was reworked to a point where it also could have been a new build, and it was very wip
basically the only thing that stayed the same were the intakes
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:12:53 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:12:58 no
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:13:17 the one with my mi24
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:13:25 distopian
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:13:55 this existed before
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:14:10 he didnt even participate i think
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:14:14 and i havent won
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:14:26 i dont know why he even started it

plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:16:06 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:16:20 i had the front before, but it was nearly fully reworked
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:16:33 and with front i mean just to the intakes
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:16:55 > that nose he showed wasnt even the nose on the mi24 pog
<@!435946988559925248> it was
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:17:32 > why in gods name are we arguing
<@!437078588701933568> haemen started accusing me on cheating on contests out of the blue and then piggles joined him
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:18:07 > nose doesnt even look similar
<@!435946988559925248> bcs it isnt
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:18:48 not to mention it was less than 1/4 and nearly everything was rebuilt
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:19:48 pretty much
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:19:53 mainly the cockpits
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:20:06 cant find a pic of it before contest
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:20:31 no
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:20:43 the nose is rebuilt and the rest didnt exist before
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:22:35 also i have no idea why it would matter to anyone that some parts of the intakes and nose existed before as a mod clearly allowed me to use it
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:22:52 i have no idea
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:24:42 fun fact : puri is so stretchy with his contest rules i would have been allowed to use my custom mbt(wich was half way done) for cev contest if it was changed enough
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:26:04 at the end i lost bcs i didnt want to make the mi24 too mad max kinda style bcs it already looked pretty dystopian imo
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:26:39 the
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:26:52 i dint even participate in that many contests
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:27:45 sst contest was pain bcs i nearly finished
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:28:05 if there were 1 or 2 more days i could have done it
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:31:32 everything but 1. is basically worthless
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:32:26 2 mods here out of nowhere
rare moment
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:32:55 normally there is first one and then comes the other one
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:33:03 but now they came at the same time
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 15:33:07 exactly same

general 2020-09-25 20:23:10 admins are more for behind the scenes stuff
general 2020-09-25 20:23:18 and i think 4 are enough
general 2020-09-25 20:24:38 what about a helper role for more simple stuff like removing .wmvs, low effort stuff in <#384025409945337856> , moderating small arguments and maybe for ranks ?
general 2020-09-25 20:24:53 no

general 2020-10-01 17:18:27 > <@!670939038999511041> VC test is not concrete, as their voice changes are determined by puberty, which can happen a year or two after they turn 13, or even before they turn, making them sound like they are older then they are. Plus it might not work with girls since they're voices are naturally higher, and can sound like a unde boy.
<@!505835349889777685> if someone behaves unde and sounds unde, its up to him to proof with his passport or get banned

general 2020-10-01 17:43:24 i wouldnt start a direct war with china

<@!435946988559925248> do u wanna tell me ur pro usa in vietnam war <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
general 2020-10-01 17:44:37 for good reasons
general 2020-10-01 17:45:14 south vietnam shouldnt have happened in the first place
general 2020-10-01 17:45:58 will korea ever unite
general 2020-10-01 17:46:05 will china ever divide
general 2020-10-01 17:47:19 a unification of korea would take decades, even if its fully wanted by all koreans including goverments
general 2020-10-01 17:47:43 the economic and social diversities are just too high to just reunite
general 2020-10-01 17:48:06 u couldnt even fully open the border at the beginning
general 2020-10-01 17:48:57 > the north would be too much for the south to handle after being invaded
<@!495822777224396811> we are talking about a peacefull, wanted reunification
general 2020-10-01 17:50:05 i'd say the most likely way is a goverment change in the north and/or mass protests there
problem is that asians are not that much of the protesting people
general 2020-10-01 17:51:11 a war is unlikely due to north korea being covered by china
general 2020-10-01 17:51:22 and nuclear weapons
general 2020-10-01 17:51:58 its too late for a war with china

general 2020-10-01 17:53:01 tensions in europe

general 2020-10-01 17:53:19 well yes
general 2020-10-01 17:53:25 but for some reason
general 2020-10-01 17:53:53 the rest of europe doesnt care that much about belarus
general 2020-10-01 17:53:54 for
general 2020-10-01 17:53:56 reasons
general 2020-10-01 17:54:45 imagine china splitting up in several smaller democratic countries
general 2020-10-01 17:54:59 that would release a lot of tensions
general 2020-10-01 17:55:09 and would expose north korea
general 2020-10-01 17:55:49 if chinese people would have the mentality of western people china wouldnt be a thing anymore

<@!177743269105500160> i tried making it a swashplate, but its too big
motors are literally too weak
the motors for blade pitch are locked and cant even be used while the rotor is spinning

plane-crazy 2020-10-11 19:30:19 > how the heck do you motor lock things at an angle
<@!216371990959882241> delayed motorlock
u first angle something with a powered+locked motor and then lock it into something by releasing other locked motors that were hold back by tnt or disconnectors
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 19:31:33 no, usually back
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 19:31:42 as they start from the front

plane-crazy 2020-10-11 19:41:51 <@!216371990959882241>
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 19:42:03 you can use disconnectors instead of tnt
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 19:42:12 also ignore the bus
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 19:44:14 i would angle the entire plate
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 19:44:39 watch the vid
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 19:44:51 ye
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 19:46:32 fixed i guess
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 19:48:57 as we said, angle the entire thing
also i would recommend doing a motorlock tower somewhere in the thing to save space
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 19:49:48 almost sad that its comparably not that much motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 19:50:39 not tryhard

plane-crazy 2020-11-03 16:27:08 thats not the point of pc, and hardly anyone shares ur opinion
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 16:27:25 its the best game on roblox
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 16:27:34 and now go away
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 16:28:33 then get a professional map builder team if u want an update
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 16:28:55 and some devs capable of helping rick rewriting the game
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 16:29:44 a bigger/better map rises the overall game experience on a long term, and therefor makes the game much better
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 16:30:46 i dont want obbies

plane-crazy 2020-11-03 16:39:50 if it sucks and u want updates why dont u just make a better game on ur own
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 16:40:15 can u read
plane-crazy 2020-11-03 16:40:34 if it sucks and u want updates why dont u just **make a better game on ur own**

<@!508745517753434138> then maybe

plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:17:34 he got banned
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:17:41 i think for leaking stuff
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:18:32 mine wont
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:18:48 ye but roblox doesnt
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:19:41 so rick is there a way to copy maps from one game to another game ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:20:50 its probably like lua testing grounds
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:21:09 but way more professional <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:21:23 e
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:21:36 map should be a island imo
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:22:26 rick what if u do another map contest and use the result to search for a map builder
maybe that would attract someone as its a bit easier then
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:22:50 e
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:23:29 that would kill the game if rick had to make it custom
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:23:47 imagine if pc wasnt on roblox
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:24:23 
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:24:41 just make pistons stronger
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:24:51 i still want a hinge motor
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:25:15 > I could possibly make a tornado
<@!217336009455566848> dont
ur gonna kill my laptop
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:25:32 roblox breaking everything seems like
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:26:18 imagine track block
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:26:31 oh and rick
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:26:40 too fat
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:26:56 if motor base was only as wide as the top
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:27:00 it would be fine
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:27:45 rick
how hard would it be to add a normal block that is invisible when spawned and has no collision
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:28:14 > aint those cams
<@!280020722431295488> they have collision
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:28:30 bad connection points
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:28:42 i mean i use signs for that a lot
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:28:57 but it would be way easier if it was just a block
the-dump 2020-11-05 12:29:08 pog
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:29:42 that would be too hard to programm i think
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:29:47 rick
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:29:50 pls answer
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:29:57 > rick
> how hard would it be to add a normal block that is invisible when spawned and has no collision
the-dump 2020-11-05 12:30:21 well
the-dump 2020-11-05 12:30:28 there is still trump
the-dump 2020-11-05 12:30:37 and the electoral college
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:31:51 what if organized Q&A 
a channel like suggestions but with questions to rick
rick picks them and answers them
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:32:51 we can ban such questions
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:33:02 also rick can pick what he wants to answer
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:33:41 not possible
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:34:01 i think ima suggest q&a channel
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:34:53 rick
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:35:01 text block has no collision
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:35:12 its not about lag
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:35:20 its for motorlock stuff
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:35:34 so u dont have cameras that block something
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:36:07 that would be nice
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:36:20 but not what we were talking about
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:36:25 see rick
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:36:31 if u motorock something
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:36:39 u often connect it with cameras
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:37:03 but these cameras sometimes block mechanics like tracks or wheels or turrets or whatever
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:37:20 so it would be usefull if we had a invisible block like cameras
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:37:26 but without collision
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:38:08 i mean u dont collide with it
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:38:14 like text blocks
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:38:59 no
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:39:10 like a text that has no text and welds to all sides
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:39:21 text
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:39:26 not cameras
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 12:39:27 he
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:37:58 <@!484529511468236802> red is shape of tirret without things attached
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:38:52 
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:39:01 here u see base turret shape
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:39:14 its not rounded directly at the gun
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:39:31 at the side its rounded
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:40:05 ik
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:40:21 do turret like that
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:40:25 trust me
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:41:40 also see the turret is half way above track covers without attachements
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:41:54 with the stuff its as wide as the tank
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:42:44 here
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:43:04 top is almost flat, ur gotta motorlock it
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 18:43:46 ik, u build them extra with signs
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 21:25:10 <@!484529511468236802> comit vip1
general 2020-11-06 11:39:34 cameralock is basically pretty useless bcs it doesnt save
general 2020-11-06 11:40:21 depending on the extend u use it
general 2020-11-06 11:40:35 if u use it for 3 things it takes 30s
general 2020-11-06 11:40:44 but if u use it for 50 things
general 2020-11-06 11:42:49 ren
general 2020-11-06 11:43:08 there were some pretty good creations using it a while ago
general 2020-11-06 11:43:14 better than ur thing
general 2020-11-06 11:43:21 some small planes
general 2020-11-06 11:44:06 i need to find them
general 2020-11-06 11:45:19 motolocc still better
general 2020-11-06 11:45:40 yes i can
general 2020-11-06 11:46:15 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/734888496405282846 <@!280020722431295488> found something
general 2020-11-06 11:46:57 oh and
general 2020-11-06 11:47:13 jay used it for his tgpd excavator
general 2020-11-06 11:47:30 this
general 2020-11-06 11:47:50 yes
general 2020-11-06 11:48:01 > I realised he used control surfaces on the tracks
<@!712273624865701921> my idea
general 2020-11-06 11:48:12 just like using signs for barrels and era
general 2020-11-06 11:48:30 > Cam locked wing panels for tracks <:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>?
<@!392334096560554001> no
general 2020-11-06 11:48:37 its a propeller blade
general 2020-11-06 11:48:59 oh and
general 2020-11-06 11:49:15 sakura used camera lock for the nose of a heli a while ago
general 2020-11-06 11:49:44 and shes using the fact that its welded to the main pilot seat for a long time for swashplates
general 2020-11-06 11:50:25 ye
general 2020-11-06 11:50:33 and it doesnt save
general 2020-11-06 11:50:49 u can play around with it, but it isnt really usefull
general 2020-11-06 11:53:00 u cant do that with camera lock
general 2020-11-06 11:54:52 this helicopter uses 500+ locked motors
general 2020-11-06 11:55:05 u cant do that with camera lock
general 2020-11-06 11:56:41 imo its just not useful for actual builds
general 2020-11-06 11:57:25 thats not a creation
general 2020-11-06 11:57:31 it has been done a lot
general 2020-11-06 11:57:40 and its not the most efficient way
general 2020-11-06 11:57:59 camera ?
general 2020-11-06 11:58:24 i mean u can do 2 or 3 things with cameras per build
general 2020-11-06 11:58:28 but if its more
general 2020-11-06 11:58:41 it just takes too long to configure
general 2020-11-06 11:59:43 there is no point in that
general 2020-11-06 12:00:16 impress undes ?
general 2020-11-06 12:01:02 i dont like it bcs i wouldnt find the right cameras anymore <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-11-06 12:01:12 there are too many

and if there werent some occasions of me being rather toxic
general 2020-11-10 14:57:52 who was that
general 2020-11-10 14:58:04 ah
general 2020-11-10 14:58:44 <@456226577798135808> u shouldnt have said that
general 2020-11-10 15:00:09 imagine vip general
general 2020-11-10 15:00:41 for what reason do master ranks not gain u vip gen access ?
general 2020-11-10 15:01:08 e
general 2020-11-10 15:01:22 there are more contest winner than master rank <@!195253906333368320>
general 2020-11-10 15:01:36 not to mention old modeler and inventor
general 2020-11-10 15:02:41 its about 25 people that would gain acess, and most of them either inactive, banned or not in pcc anymore
general 2020-11-10 15:02:59 thats not a influx of players to me
general 2020-11-10 15:04:06 > obc just doesnt want more people to see his secrets that he revealed in vip gen <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
<@!315262125113081856> i got even worse screenshots of stuff he said in mod channels/server, so...
general 2020-11-10 15:04:38 i cant leak them bcs they may be nsfw
general 2020-11-10 15:06:32 > <@!670939038999511041> yes but not going to give master role access and have an influx of players to vip general
<@!195253906333368320> 
> its about 25 people that would gain acess, and most of them either inactive, banned or not in pcc anymore
<@!670939038999511041> 
to be honest i cant think of anyone active other than myself that would gain access
general 2020-11-10 15:06:43 lol
general 2020-11-10 15:07:35 > <@!670939038999511041> just get one of the other ranks to get access then
<@!195253906333368320> how
i wont get modeler bcs vip gen biased, i wont get mod bcs im myself and i wont get contest winner bcs i dont have enough time
general 2020-11-10 15:09:27 > Miner wouldn't go outside

general 2020-11-10 15:11:08 > chances can be low but never 0

general 2020-11-10 15:12:04 <@456226577798135808> saying that wont change anything, ur in <#497142796961054721> not <#384021699466756107>  and <#507673335816126509> is a thing btw

plane-crazy 2020-11-10 15:41:04 a lot of people made it
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 15:41:09 its low effort

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:42:13 this man
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:42:18 not they
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:42:19 he
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:42:46 i mean there are 3 other guys, but they cant do anything with the actual game
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:43:05 yes 3
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:43:17 no
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:44:41 <@!163143541160148992> there is a third
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:45:12 these are the 3 guys helping rick
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:45:24 on developing the game
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:45:42 that was not what i was talking about
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:46:17 
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:46:35 that was the context
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:47:07 it was a side note after i statet there was only rick
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:48:26 they cant actually access the code of the game itself, but they mainly help with 3d models, bits of code etc
for example most block models by now were made by acivity
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:49:02 wouldnt make any sense as mad and rolijok dont care about the game
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 19:50:46 i have a great solution for shredder bug problem i already use

plane-crazy 2020-12-06 00:09:01 this is a farming vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 00:11:43 this can also be a farming vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 00:14:29 didnt find the pic with grass stuff on it
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 00:14:36 but its used for farming

plane-crazy 2020-12-06 00:20:47 well maybe
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 00:20:56 but that would really stretch the rules
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 00:25:03 there gotta be some agricultural use of this thing
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 00:25:10 i just gotta find it

bot-central 2020-12-11 15:51:50 😭
general 2020-12-11 15:52:34 you are called hyper
you are even missing a bit
general 2020-12-11 15:56:39 what was bio
general 2020-12-11 21:59:15 so uh obc

when
general 2020-12-11 22:04:34 first of all nice that u consider the suggestion and even better that it may work with the bot
for the manual checking that could temporarily be made by the victim. idk, maybe its just me, but these downvotes from that one guy still annoy me and i would ofc do the checking for a mod
general 2020-12-11 22:06:47 thats what i meant, the victim looks at the creations and tells wether the downvotes are removed. this ofc only works when there is just one victim, but it would be at least a step in the right direction. but in case it works with the bot that doesnt matter anyways
general 2020-12-11 22:07:35 ik
general 2020-12-11 22:08:07 well in my case its just me :/
but its probably egoistic to want that implemented just for me

plane-crazy 2020-12-13 13:53:21 that shitty "plane"  could fly as good as a fuckin brick irl
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 13:54:01 unlike jojos plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 13:54:26 realistic
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 13:54:44 that jet couldnt even take off
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 13:55:24 canards are pretty useless when u cant steer them
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 13:55:39 why should i
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 13:56:13 u proof that something works and not that something doesnt work
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 13:56:37 you think it could fly
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 13:56:40 so u make it
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 13:57:03 it couldnt
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 13:57:07 engine too small
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 13:57:39 it wont even reach takeoff speed with that engine, intakes and wing placement
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 13:57:53 not to mention the canopy provides horrible view
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 13:58:32 the what
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:00:08 it was not the first aircraft that reached mach 2, and if no one would have believed it would fly, no one would have built it
smh
braindead
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:00:37 ah yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:01:34 
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:01:41 get ur facts right idiot
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:01:55 u never said jet, thats ur problem
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:03:27 dumbass
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:03:38 everything in ur statement is fucking wrong
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:04:17 🤦
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:04:37 jojo is talking shit again
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:05:24 i still wonder how he is not banned for controverse statements causing arguments yet
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:06:17 u made a statement with every single thing in it wrong
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:06:33 u have done it many times in the past, u should know better
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:06:58 lets take a look at ur statement again
plane-crazy 2020-12-13 14:09:18 "the no one believed...." part is wrong, otherwise it wouldnt have been built
it was not the first aircraft to hit mach 2, it didnt even hit mach 2
it didnt proof an excellent fighter. first of all it was a intercepter and not a fighter, and second it didnt really proof excellent, it wasnt called "widowmaker" for no reason

see, literally everything wrong

creations-chat 2020-12-18 15:09:35 lemme guess
"too realistic" "i like blocky builds more"
creations-chat 2020-12-18 15:14:43 each has a own anchor and is attached to the others via cameras and a tnt block. they are placed each by its own

<@!325875263336349696> they somewhat fly, not the quickest due to detailed intake and not much space
creations-chat 2020-12-18 15:18:01 its nothing compared to mi24 or mbt
also with everyone else anchored, graphics at 1 and everything apart from the game itself closed i got some 10 fps, so it worked quite fine
creations-chat 2020-12-18 15:20:04 imagine 2014
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 15:22:30 it was a random idea to make this pic, and the ships each took weeks or months of work, u dont purpose build these for such a pic

general 2020-12-18 16:16:10 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/627195143040139264/690605448646230088 thats several people
general 2020-12-18 16:24:20 if a group picture gets hof can herisson get rank
general 2020-12-18 16:24:23 and 99er
general 2020-12-18 16:25:00 ask obc when he goes online
general 2020-12-18 16:25:24 why not
maybe no ranks, but no hof doesnt make sense
general 2020-12-18 16:27:34 that sentence
general 2020-12-18 16:27:46 maybe but a " , "

plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:17:19 there was no one
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:18:42 it can be done one time by one person, after that its just stupid

plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:21:14 this is literally
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:21:18 the first time

plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:25:39 its specific on meme build and not normal builds

plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:26:43 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:26:53 we are talking about the idea of filling the gap
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:27:01 that obviously is a meme build

plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:30:34 how this conversation would have went if u werent here
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:31:45 it would literally be few words :
"explain yourself"
"oh didnt know u did that before"
"ok"

but instead of this, vip came and turned it into and argument and the guy is just gone now
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:32:15 bruh cant u read what i just said
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 01:32:34 that would have happened if u were not here

plane-crazy 2020-12-22 15:15:43 smoke

seems quite fine, but some exposed motors, something little weird with intakes and the front could be more angled/aerodynamic
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 15:16:06 so it needs some polishing, but overall its fine
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 15:16:21 better than the ace combat thing <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-12-22 15:16:38 thats better
general 2020-12-22 15:16:44 maybe the light a bit mor
general 2020-12-22 15:16:50 how do i say

plane-crazy 2020-12-22 15:19:30 imagine playing pvp
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 15:20:42 is that a list of most common non-custom planes in pc ?
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 15:20:50 there is nothing original in it
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 15:22:01 well no, but as they look pretty similiar to other ww2 fighters they are nothing really original
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 15:22:25 and when made by bad builders there is no difference to other ww2 fighters at all
plane-crazy 2020-12-22 15:25:11 f4u for sure

general 2020-12-23 12:47:33 war thunder is better
general 2020-12-23 12:48:24 kpz70 is a heavy tank in blitz <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-12-23 12:48:46 if it had normal stats
general 2020-12-23 12:48:54 it would be like tier 15
general 2020-12-23 12:49:32 is4 is better
general 2020-12-23 12:51:20 is4 is on the edge of broken
general 2020-12-23 12:51:40 also instead of is7 you can just take wz 113
general 2020-12-23 12:51:42 its better
general 2020-12-23 12:53:11 robo
general 2020-12-23 12:53:18 do u still play blitz ?
general 2020-12-23 12:53:38 are u on eu ?

general 2020-12-23 12:54:36 sad
general 2020-12-23 13:36:45 thats no f16
general 2020-12-23 13:37:06 no
general 2020-12-23 13:37:43 that is eurofighter
general 2020-12-23 13:38:11 that is f16
general 2020-12-23 13:39:39 do u need medical care ?
general 2020-12-23 13:41:38 its
general 2020-12-23 13:41:41 elevator music
general 2020-12-23 13:51:51 what the fuck is that system
general 2020-12-23 13:52:25 how
general 2020-12-23 13:52:30 also location leak
general 2020-12-23 13:52:36 wherever that is
general 2020-12-23 13:52:40 no i mean
general 2020-12-23 13:52:47 that system makes no sense
general 2020-12-23 13:53:02 we have both a 12 hour and 24 hour system here
general 2020-12-23 13:53:06 but
general 2020-12-23 13:53:08 like
general 2020-12-23 13:53:43 we dont say something like pm or am most of the time bcs its in context
general 2020-12-23 13:53:46 but
general 2020-12-23 13:53:58 there is no past 12 for the 12 hour system
general 2020-12-23 13:54:08 well there is
general 2020-12-23 13:54:13 but just for am
general 2020-12-23 13:54:20 no
general 2020-12-23 13:54:24 i talk about
general 2020-12-23 13:54:46 when u say 1 to 13:00 and 8 to 20:00 etc
general 2020-12-23 13:55:09 there is no 12:18 for 0:18 bcs it doesnt make sense
general 2020-12-23 13:55:17 but seems like in australia there is
general 2020-12-23 13:55:41 is there anything with 0:something for u ?
general 2020-12-23 13:56:23 we mostly do here too, but in everyday life we also use 12 hours
general 2020-12-23 13:56:33 thats weird
general 2020-12-23 13:58:59 still doesnt make sense to me
general 2020-12-23 14:00:19 makes my brain hurt
general 2020-12-23 14:01:16 this also means ur day starts at 12:01

general 2020-12-23 14:02:13 god spare us, even tho im atheist
general 2020-12-23 14:02:44 literally hell with all the fires
general 2020-12-23 14:03:57 i cant remember that there ever has been a fire in the area of germany i live in
general 2020-12-23 14:04:23 ik, was in the news all the time
general 2020-12-23 14:05:39 u dont even really know what it is
general 2020-12-23 14:06:15 ok
general 2020-12-23 14:06:25 😭
general 2020-12-23 14:13:01 <@!435946988559925248> russia has a lot of fires in siberia
its continental, so it can be pretty dry and there is a ton of good burning forest
general 2020-12-23 14:13:28 also its hard to access so the fires burn pretty long
general 2020-12-23 14:15:25 tree everywhere
general 2020-12-23 14:17:36 imagine having no real mountains
general 2020-12-23 14:18:57 dont see
general 2020-12-23 14:20:08 thats hills
general 2020-12-23 14:20:12 not mountains
general 2020-12-23 14:20:43 this is mountains
general 2020-12-23 14:21:36 its mountain
general 2020-12-23 14:22:48 does australia have something like this
general 2020-12-23 14:23:25 pretty sure it isnt
general 2020-12-23 14:24:17 look what u said
general 2020-12-23 14:24:26 that would be mount everest

help 2020-12-31 10:51:48 no need to ask jay, was originally my way of doing it (note that miner did something somewhat similar before)
so basically u make them with control panels and propeller blades 
also, not seen on this, but u can also angle sections of control panels with motors
the control panels are connected with text blocks as they have no hitbox
its rather advanced and needs some motorlock, so only try if u feel confident
help 2020-12-31 10:55:57 here u can see it with control panel sections angled

general 2021-01-01 13:07:28 im not there
general 2021-01-01 13:07:39 dont have contest winner
general 2021-01-01 13:07:52 doesnt count
general 2021-01-01 13:08:28 i mean i get why team doesnt get u vip lounge
general 2021-01-01 13:08:39 but i dont get why master rank doesnt get u there
general 2021-01-01 13:09:11 ah yes
general 2021-01-01 13:09:27 wha
general 2021-01-01 13:09:40 it maybe was easy when u got hof
general 2021-01-01 13:09:53 no
general 2021-01-01 13:10:20 nothing against u, but i dont think u will still be able to get hof
general 2021-01-01 13:11:01 i mean my tank almost failed for the single reason that "tanks are not original"
general 2021-01-01 13:11:33 i dont get it
if they want "original" stuff, then why are mem builds not allowed
general 2021-01-01 13:11:53 ik
general 2021-01-01 13:12:47 i mean they may have voted on many tanks, but there are exactly 3 things including tanks in hof
not to mention that there is exactly one person with master terrain rank
general 2021-01-01 13:13:25 me
general 2021-01-01 13:15:11 the score of 75 is easy, the vip gen vote is the hard part
i mean maybe 25% of the people there still actively play the game, probably even less, yet they are the ones to decide that
all of these modelers and inventors may have been good builders in the past, but the game evolved and they didnt bcs they dont play anymore
general 2021-01-01 13:15:41 the times of easy hof are long gone man
general 2021-01-01 13:16:02 now there is maybe one thing in hof per month in average
general 2021-01-01 13:17:16 then explain me how there is a a10 in hof that is neither really detailed nor any original
general 2021-01-01 13:18:21 and imo hof should be a place for really good builds, not for decent but original ones
general 2021-01-01 13:20:21 this got hof smh
general 2021-01-01 13:20:25 dont get that
general 2021-01-01 13:20:55 nothing, but its just decent and not very good
general 2021-01-01 13:21:20 it could be way smoother , with better colour shading and way more detail
general 2021-01-01 13:21:48 if it wasnt for the "original" part there was no way of the fish getting hof
general 2021-01-01 13:22:59 also how was that not considered a meme build but vungis bunny was considered one
general 2021-01-01 13:23:27 neither is a bunny
general 2021-01-01 13:24:32 is obc more of a meme than waluigi ?
general 2021-01-01 13:24:38 or shall i say
general 2021-01-01 13:24:42 closer to a meme
general 2021-01-01 13:25:26 every vote in vip gen is biased to some degree, face it
general 2021-01-01 13:26:09 regarding what kind of build it is and who it made
general 2021-01-01 13:26:36 well thats deserved tho
general 2021-01-01 13:27:04 maybe u dont, but not everyone is like you
general 2021-01-01 13:28:20 do u wanna tell me that isnt biased ?
btw there were only ever modeler votes on two things i made
general 2021-01-01 13:30:28 how is "modeler" for something original
what i understand under modeling is recreating something realistic very accurate
general 2021-01-01 13:30:49 inventer would be for original stuff
general 2021-01-01 13:31:22 also wanna collect some builds that got people modeler in the old days ?
general 2021-01-01 13:34:11 also if i recall correctly miner won a modeler vote on this, wich is without a doubt a awesome build, but not really original
general 2021-01-01 13:35:05 thats as far as im concerned the only modeler vote that was successful so far
general 2021-01-01 13:35:22 and its anything but a original build
general 2021-01-01 13:35:28 ah yes
general 2021-01-01 13:36:22 ye sure that was the part that got him modeler and not the fact that its a awesome and accurate recreation of something real
general 2021-01-01 13:36:56 are u serious
general 2021-01-01 13:38:09 at some point all the old modeler and inventor roles should be revised with a public vote
general 2021-01-01 13:38:33 thing is
general 2021-01-01 13:39:12 master ranks are harder to get than contest winner in case u have enough time for contests
general 2021-01-01 13:40:41 and i dont see why u wouldnt give atleast those vip gen access who got their master rank after the introduction of those, bcs, lets face it, at that point it wasnt easy to get hof anymore
general 2021-01-01 13:41:26 they are hard af rn, u cant tell me something different
general 2021-01-01 13:41:32 and if they shouldnt be that hard
general 2021-01-01 13:41:37 complain to vip gen
general 2021-01-01 13:42:02 cant, not in there <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>
general 2021-01-01 13:42:37 imagine if there were blimp ranks
general 2021-01-01 13:43:30 if fortune changed the helium to rockets or something afterwards without changing the looks, would he be able to get vtol rank ?
general 2021-01-01 13:44:11 <@!577604979909459989> <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
general 2021-01-01 13:44:14 go for it
general 2021-01-01 13:44:21 would be 3rd master vtol
general 2021-01-01 13:44:36 imagine
general 2021-01-01 13:44:46 t114 is just broken
general 2021-01-01 13:45:27 if u dont change how it looks in any way it shouldnt matter as it would have gotten hof aswell
general 2021-01-01 13:47:39 im getting killed by t114 in my 6.3 russian lineup all the time
its just
they can hide almost everything and still shoot
they can pen u everywhere, so your armour only makes you slower
they are faster 
they have quicker reload
general 2021-01-01 13:48:50 and when they only show their turret and u dont hit the cannon with ur is2 ur fucked
general 2021-01-01 13:50:45 me yesterday after i faced the ebr both times when i played russia and germany
general 2021-01-01 13:51:46 ebr should get its wheels fixed and then go to 6.3 or 6.7
general 2021-01-01 21:03:55 war thunder was so fucking frustrating today
general 2021-01-01 21:04:10 i didnt even manage to get 6 kills once
general 2021-01-01 21:04:29 wait what

general 2021-01-07 17:29:04 well uh
my potato laptop has 2.5 ghz
but it depends on other things also
if its not completely trash u should be able to run war thunder, but probably not on max graphics
general 2021-01-07 17:58:10 paint where
general 2021-01-07 18:00:12 some day
general 2021-01-07 18:00:22 yes we do
general 2021-01-07 18:00:32 would be perfect for tracks
general 2021-01-07 18:00:47 ~~so they dont look like the shit u put on ur m10~~
general 2021-01-07 18:01:22 u never wanted to change them <:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2021-01-07 18:07:44 war thunder i see
general 2021-01-07 18:08:04 full client is another 20 gb btw <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2021-01-07 18:08:58 hd textures, vehicle preview, putting bushes and camos on etc
general 2021-01-07 18:09:29 i cant have full client bcs gaijingles poo<:nooo:787097964946259978>
general 2021-01-07 18:10:13 there is a bug for like 2 months now for mac
general 2021-01-07 18:10:32 but they dont care bcs only few ppl play on mac
general 2021-01-07 18:11:45 dont know about that
for mac its that the game constantly keeps crashing if u have full client 
users on the forum got already so far that they know its aircraft hd textures that cause the problem
general 2021-01-07 18:13:15 its my dads pc 
he mostly uses it for editing pictures he made
but its very good
has like 45 gb ram
can easily run war thunder on max graphics
general 2021-01-07 18:13:57 more than 10 times the ram my laptop has <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2021-01-07 18:14:39 imagine only 5

general 2021-01-07 18:15:17 what nation
general 2021-01-07 18:15:23 plane ?
general 2021-01-07 18:15:25 why plane
general 2021-01-07 18:15:40 do tanks and planes for ground rb
general 2021-01-07 18:16:13 also if u want to get to higher tiers quicker play a smaller nation
general 2021-01-07 18:19:19 <@!467765396108476426> if u want to get to higher tiers any time soon play france, italy or sweden 
germany takes eternity 
if ur f2p u will take like a year to get me163
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 18:19:47 did u get star for event yet ?
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 18:19:55 b1 wont get it u

plane-crazy 2021-01-07 18:29:47 ah
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 18:29:52 ye
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 18:30:05 so far it seems like its a rad at lower br
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 18:30:28 might get a good price

general 2021-01-07 18:46:30 i dont know, he didnt answer me

general 2021-01-07 18:46:48 ye
general 2021-01-07 18:48:39 real
general 2021-01-07 18:49:54 when u post nsfw in general while a mod is typing 
🧠
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 18:51:18 ?
what about it
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 18:53:57 wha
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 18:55:14 oh god
its been not even a week
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 18:55:22 or maybe a week
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 18:55:26 but not much
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 19:25:59 im sorry to play it
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 19:26:03 thing is
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 19:26:26 if i want to play the event in anything else and not at 9.0 i have to face it
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 19:26:39 so i rather play it than facing it
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 19:27:01 want the class 3p for my german 9.0 prem lineup
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 19:27:17 still need 1 star bcs i started late
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 19:28:09 i have a feeling its a more surviveable rad at lower br
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 19:28:54 ebr is in war thunder
event tank 
its spammed and almost as broken as r3
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 19:29:17 r3 is still more broken tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 19:29:36 but due to the quantity ebr is getting more annoying
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 19:30:31 r3 should be 6.3 
and ebr also 6.3 or 6.0 once it gets its wheels properly implemented
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 19:32:05 there is a lot to come
general 2021-01-08 10:01:59 just reload the page, its when the page was open for too long or when u deleted ur history and are logged out
general 2021-01-08 10:02:58 use a new link maybe
general 2021-01-08 10:04:08 idk i had the errror before but it was always easy to fix
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 10:07:40 you cant safe it <:bruhaps:646045387911725106>
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 10:08:24 so if u have more than two things u use it for its pretty useless
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 10:09:59 me too
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 10:11:55 imagine if i would have used camera lock for this
would need like 5 minutes every time just to find the cameras
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 10:12:41 delayed motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 10:12:57 wdym
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 10:13:02 folding ?
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 10:13:54 basically u use tnt so the motors dont lock instantly, and by locking wheels outwards step by step i get track tension
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 10:13:59 not in game rn
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 10:15:53 i use these tracks
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 10:17:29 so basically u have normal motorlock but the ends not attached to the sides they r at, but to the opposite side 
that way when it locks both sides go away from each other
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 10:17:59 well and the top of the motors turned inside so they are thin
general 2021-01-08 11:31:14 grand tour is the new top gear
and we love that
general 2021-01-08 11:32:16 imagine believing that shit like gods is real
general 2021-01-08 11:33:03 play eu server only
it sometimes puts u in other server
general 2021-01-08 11:33:30 if that doesnt work make gaijin feed the server hamster
general 2021-01-08 11:34:11 surprisingly i never had ping issues for the entire event so far
general 2021-01-08 11:34:34 what nation r u grinding
general 2021-01-08 11:36:46 u can also be a hamburger 
1.8 mio people here are hamburger
general 2021-01-08 11:37:46 depending on how much u play, u will take maybe 3 month or up to a year to get there
general 2021-01-08 11:37:59 🤢
general 2021-01-08 11:40:13 milchreis 
its pretty good
its with cinnamon and very sweet
general 2021-01-08 11:41:09 <@!467765396108476426> quickest way would be to grind only medium and td line, but u will probably struggle to get a proper lineup sometimes
general 2021-01-08 11:41:36 that doesnt sound very good
general 2021-01-08 11:43:06 i know a more horrible thing
celery juice and carrot juice mixed
general 2021-01-08 11:44:22 carrot juice when mixed with other fruit juices is quite good
celery is just awful, and carrot makes it worse for some reason
general 2021-01-08 11:46:31 ahckerman
general 2021-01-08 11:48:44 ~~i still consider grab a mod~~
general 2021-01-08 11:50:22 it wont be that much fun to play, lemme tell u that in advance
general 2021-01-08 11:50:55 who
general 2021-01-08 11:51:06 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
general 2021-01-08 11:52:59 <@!314383347214319616> do u think going straight for ferdinand is a good idea for vungi 
i have a feeling he will suffer a lot
general 2021-01-08 11:54:01 ^ <@!467765396108476426>
general 2021-01-08 11:54:13 dont do ferdinand
general 2021-01-08 11:55:26 well still better than some french tanks
general 2021-01-08 11:58:26 if u are f2p and dont have a premium it is a very very bad idea to play a tank that costs u 15k sl every time u die
for a comparison to wot : from my experience 1sl equals about 4-6 silver
general 2021-01-08 11:59:10 free to play
general 2021-01-08 11:59:57 its not good for farming sl
general 2021-01-08 12:00:52 not really better than tech tree planes
general 2021-01-08 12:01:20 u mean this one, dont u ?

general 2021-01-08 16:29:42 they just speak german for obvious reasons so i understand what they actually say
general 2021-01-08 16:35:18 unlike for mustach man, stalin doesnt have actual "followers" or something like that in nowadays world, and so its very unlikely that stalin is posted as a kind of propaganda for ones political view, wich sadly isnt the case for mustach man

general 2021-01-09 11:30:18 could be counted as low effort
general 2021-01-09 11:31:22 idk i would have to see it to evaluate

general 2021-01-09 11:36:01 did i just see a guy that is watching tik tok and is simping for taren rant against weebs
general 2021-01-09 20:02:06 you are supposed to shoot the ricardos idiot
general 2021-01-09 20:03:34 yes
general 2021-01-09 20:06:07 idk
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 11:39:33 -the canopy needs to be a bit bigger and the nose way smaller in 
 comparison to the rest

-the intakes should be higher and not that wide

-you dont have any transition between the intake part and the back hull

-the end of the fuselage where the engine sits should be more round

-the overall canopy shape, especially the transition to the nose is kinda 
 weird 


also the paint needs work <:trollface:775024642104229898> 
seriously tho mate, no need to be toxic to that guy and no need to rage 

here is a reference picture (model bcs u can see the shape better) :
i would also suggest u overlay screenshots with blueprints to get the shape right
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 11:49:05 the entire intake part slowly goes into the fuselage, i would use motorlock angles 
just compare
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 11:49:06 
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 14:26:25 e seems better
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 15:11:49 wont play in the next time, but just make a round exhaust and do a smooth transition to the fuselage
general 2021-01-10 15:13:27 sorry, what issue are u talking about ?

general 2021-01-19 10:35:10 its a very speedy glass cannon 
good investment
general 2021-01-19 10:36:14 to me it seems somewhat like a amx 13 with slower reload
general 2021-01-19 10:36:18 so quite good
general 2021-01-19 10:37:13 well uh
im about to get to france mid tier
lorraine and bat chat and stuff
general 2021-01-19 10:37:31 not the fl11
general 2021-01-19 10:37:37 the fl10 at 6.3
general 2021-01-19 10:37:42 thats the good one
general 2021-01-19 10:39:24 ebr is an entire br lower than m18
balance
general 2021-01-19 10:40:08 ye
general 2021-01-19 10:40:31 they should have made the one with the fl11 the event vehicle
that would be balanced
general 2021-01-19 10:40:45 fl10 is just op with its sa50
general 2021-01-19 10:41:18 thing is
it could even get the better round that the amx 13 at 6.3 has
general 2021-01-19 10:41:51 happy birthday robert
general 2021-01-19 10:43:16 did u know that the ebr basically has the panthers gun
general 2021-01-19 10:43:52 french just took it
made it shorter
made better round for similiar pen
boom
general 2021-01-19 10:44:39 they should fix ebr drive model
give it the better round the sherman sa50 and the amx13 have 
and move it to 6.3
general 2021-01-19 10:45:13 winrate isnt even bad
i have like 67% in it
general 2021-01-19 10:45:29 i only have the l44 at 9.0
general 2021-01-19 10:45:41 and the class 3p but i dont wanna use it yet
general 2021-01-19 10:46:32 it stays at its br bcs for one plane kill 30 r3s get killed
gaijin still thinks of it as a aa
general 2021-01-19 10:46:57 ye later 
like in 1.5 or 2 hours
general 2021-01-19 10:47:05 also i like france 5.3 more
general 2021-01-19 10:47:12 than 9.0 germany
general 2021-01-19 10:48:34 balance
general 2021-01-19 10:49:25 i have ussr till 6.3(and one 7.0 i never played), germany either till 5.7 or 9.0 and france till 5.3
general 2021-01-19 10:49:56 thats all u need
general 2021-01-19 10:50:06 wha
general 2021-01-19 10:50:35 <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
general 2021-01-19 10:50:48 ebr is completely overpowered
general 2021-01-19 10:50:51 simply
general 2021-01-19 10:50:53 broken
general 2021-01-19 10:51:57 thing is 
once u take ebr to 5.3 
u hardly see r3s 
so its even better there
general 2021-01-19 10:54:33 
general 2021-01-19 10:54:39 thats not even the worst
general 2021-01-19 10:54:48 i had battles with only ebrs
general 2021-01-19 10:56:40 sounds like the poor thing is about to die

general 2021-01-19 11:06:51 and lorraine
general 2021-01-19 11:07:29 i feel like amx 13 is better than bat chat
general 2021-01-19 11:07:36 but bat chat is 6.7
general 2021-01-19 11:07:44 and amx 6.3
general 2021-01-19 11:08:28 slower reload 
bigger target
only 5 rounds in autoloader
general 2021-01-19 11:08:50 it seems like its not good if u face several enemies
general 2021-01-19 11:09:32 wha
general 2021-01-19 11:09:50 it has 15k repair cost tho
general 2021-01-19 11:10:02 <:pogey:651848693842182144>
general 2021-01-19 11:10:43 why tho
general 2021-01-19 11:11:10 its not
general 2021-01-19 11:11:17 its snowball system
general 2021-01-19 11:12:04 if higher repair cost
only more experienced players that have the sl play
then stats get better
gaijin makes higher repair cost
and so on

creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:19:22 1. 8 hours is nothing, and it doesnt matter how long u needed, the build is shit
2. that people downvote something that looks bad isnt toxic, unlike mass downvoting everything when u get downvotes 
3. stfu

hi JobBohnson
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:28:23 well if u look at his build, its rather bad, low effort and not even painted, so its fair to say its shit 

for context:
and as far as im concerned he downvoted everything in creations bcs people downvoted his build
not to mention he called people toxic for downvoting his build just after he did mass downvote
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:30:47 just search for what he posted in <#384025409945337856> 
use the search bar

no problem mate, ur reaction was quite appropriate for someone who has no context
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 14:42:31 u are the one who complained about downvotes just after u mass downvoted <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 14:46:14 <@456226577798135808> 1. no
2. u should listen to this guy
raging and ignoring what u did wrong wont help u in any way, neither in building nor in good reputation and people liking u
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:57:19 <@!462891443673890827> posting wip pictures will make u get less upvotes on the final product as it isnt that new anymore, and it also is against the rules(literally no mod enforces that tho<:KEKW:670310537300672528> )
creations-chat 2021-01-21 14:59:34 im trying to say that its the best thing to post no wip pictures at all, both for u and for creations channel

do u seriously think having a better rank should get u more upvotes ?!
creations-chat 2021-01-28 13:48:19 people here aint 8yo my guy
standards are way higher, and its good like that
if all kind of pc content was in <#537387160261885962> , it would just be a spam of, well, trash content.
if u want to see ur content there and not being mass downvoted, u really gotta rise ur quality

if its a showcase there is no need to watch the vid if the build isnt good
creations-chat 2021-01-28 13:51:52 This is NOT a good looking blimp

not even close to 

no one is in the position to judge his own builds to that degree, and the community certainly didnt think like you

sorry for toxic but this guys way of thinking is pissing me off a bit
creations-chat 2021-01-28 13:56:41 if its being voted on for hof its still on voting

to be honest tho, quality of the build isnt that good, but maybe it has a chance bcs its "original" to people in vip gen
creations-chat 2021-01-28 14:00:14 its no bad build, but neither a extremely good one, no need to hype it that much
general 2021-01-28 14:16:25 <@!221496030355521536> hi
do u play wt
general 2021-01-28 14:17:17 dont underestimate the radiation tho
general 2021-01-28 14:18:46 but maybe less civilians 
nuking a normal city still is one of the biggest war crimes in history
general 2021-01-28 14:19:25 neither was germany <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>
general 2021-01-28 14:19:35 what nation and br ?
general 2021-01-28 14:19:54 hm
general 2021-01-28 14:20:05 do u have a 5.3 lineup ?
general 2021-01-28 14:20:42 they had everything but poor moral
and japan is smaller and with ussr in north
general 2021-01-28 14:20:55 wanna play in like 5min
general 2021-01-28 14:21:41 its not
murdering half a million civilians is never justified, no matter what
general 2021-01-28 14:22:06 lol
did u ever change it ? first change is free
general 2021-01-28 14:22:24 and so was nuking japan
general 2021-01-28 14:22:52 first
general 2021-01-28 14:22:59 radiation doesnt just go away
general 2021-01-28 14:23:02 second
general 2021-01-28 14:23:31 the people that mainly would have died in a land invasion would have been soldiers, not civilians
general 2021-01-28 14:24:23 soldiers would have died, not young children
general 2021-01-28 14:25:09 not to the degree the bomb killed them
general 2021-01-28 14:26:23 its not
there is a reason the atomic bomb was never used in a war since
its called moral
general 2021-01-28 14:26:56 do u read what i say
general 2021-01-28 14:27:58 a soldier kills other soldiers and can somewhat defend himself, a little kid in hiroshima could not
general 2021-01-28 14:29:43 my guys
general 2021-01-28 14:30:05 do u want to tell me nuking a civilian city isnt something that never should be done
general 2021-01-28 14:30:34 its not
general 2021-01-28 14:30:42 it is simply never justified
general 2021-01-28 14:31:02 life against life isnt how moral works
general 2021-01-28 14:34:11 look at this
in order to stop the train, you would need to kill a fat grandpa by hand and get him over the railing
other option is to do nothing and 5 railworkers die 

what would u do ? would u have the strenght to look the old guy in the eyes and kill him ?
general 2021-01-28 14:34:33 u say u would do it
general 2021-01-28 14:34:34 yet
general 2021-01-28 14:34:42 if u would be in this situation
general 2021-01-28 14:34:49 i bet u wouldnt be able to
general 2021-01-28 14:35:08 u are too thin, u cant stop the train
general 2021-01-28 14:36:36 think about it
u all say u would do something heroic 
yet if u were actually in this situation, chances are u would just stand there and do nothing
general 2021-01-28 14:37:55 i would bet a house u wouldnt actually do what u say
bcs u just cant manage to kill someone just like that 
u would stand there and just be shocked, unable to do anything

<@!718409831639154718> u kinda fucked that amx 13 up <:KEKW:670310537300672528> 
the turret of the amx 13 is in the back, the road wheels should be bigger, there is a bigger slope in the front and the engine deck is a bit higher than where the turret sits, and the back also is different 
i think ur mistake is that u used pictures of the kürassier instead of the amx 13

look :
this is a kürassier :
plane-crazy 2021-02-01 18:11:56 this is a amx 13 75 :

general 2021-02-16 15:50:02 ye
general 2021-02-16 15:50:16 always thought repair cost of lorraine was super bad
general 2021-02-16 15:50:32 but every french tank at that br has 10k+ <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>
general 2021-02-16 15:51:52 surprisingly i can stay stable 
even with matches where i loose like 30k+
only buying new tank drains the sl a lot
general 2021-02-16 15:52:35 bye
general 2021-02-16 15:53:04 i dont really like air
found out bomber is decent for grinding but its even more boring
general 2021-02-16 15:53:13 the f22222222 thingy
general 2021-02-16 15:53:35 one time use
general 2021-02-16 15:53:40 and it brings bad teams
general 2021-02-16 15:53:47 other than that its great
general 2021-02-16 15:54:35 what about that one bomber that comited spaceclimb <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>
general 2021-02-16 15:55:21 bomber spawn most of the time is above 5000m <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
general 2021-02-16 15:56:11 is there any good french prem plane thats not too expensive ?
general 2021-02-16 15:56:50 yes really
general 2021-02-16 15:57:26 is kinda expensive tho
general 2021-02-16 15:57:48 missing 7 ge to buy p47 <:nooo:787097964946259978>

general 2021-02-16 16:01:03 at the beginning not too much
maybe 20
i think ima sell it above 30 but that may take some time
general 2021-02-16 16:02:29 why is class 3 still so cheap <:nooo:787097964946259978>

general 2021-02-20 09:02:40 its less challenging, less rewarding and u cant be sneaky by any means
general 2021-02-20 09:02:48 also it requires less skill
general 2021-02-20 09:02:53 its just boring
general 2021-02-20 09:03:14 but actually yes
general 2021-02-20 09:03:53 idk about u, but for me less skill ≠ fun
general 2021-02-20 09:04:02 .
general 2021-02-20 09:04:51 it doesnt take skill
general 2021-02-20 09:05:02 u dont even have to know armour profiles

general 2021-04-12 19:42:50 hm
general 2021-04-12 19:43:04 ussr doesnt have a good 150mm he
general 2021-04-12 19:43:20 the 125 he in top tier is kinda op
general 2021-04-12 19:43:47 pt 76 is shit
general 2021-04-12 19:43:54 like really shit
general 2021-04-12 19:44:16 mobility is shit, armour is shit, cannon is extremely unreliable and shitty
general 2021-04-12 19:44:34 dont mention that
general 2021-04-12 19:45:55 they mostly have magic angle pen
general 2021-04-12 19:46:10 no
general 2021-04-12 19:46:14 even worse
general 2021-04-12 19:46:16 pt 76
general 2021-04-12 19:47:33 its pretty decent imo
still had it in my lineup at 7.0 and didnt really struggle with it
u dont need the best pen when u have awesome mobility and armour 
also facing dumb wehraboos makes it easy
general 2021-04-12 19:47:45 t44 100 is really really nice tho
general 2021-04-12 19:48:06 is2
general 2021-04-12 19:48:26 asu-85 is better imo
general 2021-04-12 19:48:35 really underrated tank
general 2021-04-12 19:50:02 big he
general 2021-04-12 19:50:06 very good
general 2021-04-12 19:50:30 anything u hit is dead if it isnt the middle of a panther/tiger2 ufp
general 2021-04-12 19:51:12 <@!437078588701933568> looking at my stats rn
asu-85 is so much better than su-100p
general 2021-04-12 19:51:44 look at this
general 2021-04-12 19:51:46 
general 2021-04-12 19:53:44 perfectly balanced
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:01:06 if u have contest winner or a higher rank u get access to vip lounge
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:01:21 master rank isnt enough for reasons
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:01:46 no
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:02:06 u need contest winner, inventor, modeler or a staff rank
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:02:22 expert supreme is easy to get
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:02:42 supposedly master supreme gets u vip gen access but no one has that
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:03:19 indeed my head is positioned higher than my monitor
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:03:41 sad but true
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:04:47 hyper said master rank would be to easy to get 

there are like 20 people with master rank that dont have vip gen access already
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:05:28 and no one except me got a master rank in the last 5 months or so
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:05:51 hof dead for 4 months now
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:06:38 at this point im very certain the next one to get to hof will miner with his VAB and apollo stuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:06:58 but he probably still needs 1 or 2 months to finish
plane-crazy 2021-04-12 20:07:22 miner.

plane-crazy 2021-04-17 15:50:00 is the tower below hollow ?
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 15:50:27 ik
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 15:50:56 if its hollow u can make a spinning motor lock tower inside and connect everything with text blocks
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 15:52:15 u lock two angle motors in each other
maybe use cameras at the end
idk
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 15:54:35 not anytime soon tho i guess
creations-chat 2021-04-17 15:56:03 hi

plane-crazy 2021-04-17 15:57:07 gotta see how it looks painted on the final product
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 15:57:17 but till then it will do
creations-chat 2021-04-17 15:58:17 well not for all people it seems

plane-crazy 2021-04-17 15:59:47 i thought it was a ship
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:00:27 6 hours is nothing
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:01:26 it took me 5 months to make a creation and it only got 260 upvotes 😭 😭 😭
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:01:33 jk
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:04:17 1. i was joking
2. the last time a creation got more upvotes than that was november last year
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:05:10 i honestly cant comprehend how that a10 has 290 upvote
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:05:25 i wouldnt even call it hof worthy
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:06:08 how can this thing have more upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:06:16 than this
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:06:31 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:06:47 ik
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:07:15 bottom got 230 upvotes top got 290
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:07:39 nope
they both in hof, so activity doesnt matter too much
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:08:21 60 upvotes is not a minor difference
plane-crazy 2021-04-17 16:08:34 🤢

the-dump 2021-04-18 14:19:56 start of Stan (feat. Dido) by Eminem, dont know wether it is its own song yet
the-dump 2021-04-18 14:23:25 the part itself seems to be a own song called 'It's not so bad', only found versions with men voices so far, best one yet is by Grailz Beni
the-dump 2021-04-18 14:25:36 ok there is also a song called 'thank you' by dido(so same voice) with same lyrics
general 2021-04-18 14:28:15 best place would be a very deep mine that is in rock water cant pass
general 2021-04-18 14:28:31 burry is a bad idea
general 2021-04-18 14:28:56 u dont want ur ground water passed through nuclear waste

believe me
general 2021-04-18 14:29:43 as long as water can pass through where u have ur nuclear waste its a very very bad idea
general 2021-04-18 14:30:12 there really isnt completely still water
general 2021-04-18 14:30:22 still connected to ground water
general 2021-04-18 14:30:34 why would u even want water
general 2021-04-18 14:30:37 just
general 2021-04-18 14:31:02 make a big bunker somewhere 2km below earth in a mine and put containers filled with ur waste there
general 2021-04-18 14:31:32 no
general 2021-04-18 14:31:48 it just distributes it
general 2021-04-18 14:32:00 wich is exactly what u dont want
general 2021-04-18 14:34:42 nuclear power would be a really good solutions until there is enough sources for renewable energy if there would be save nuclear plants and deposits for the waste 
problem is making such plants and deposits takes longer than just making enough solare and wind energy producing units
general 2021-04-18 14:36:20 there have been corona cases in antarctica already <:bruhaps:646045387911725106> 
humans have something called body temperature
general 2021-04-18 14:36:46 u get something wrong
general 2021-04-18 14:36:47 so
general 2021-04-18 14:36:49 i said
general 2021-04-18 14:37:49 nuclear would be a good temporary solution **if** it was made pretty save, but making it pretty save takes longer than just skipping it and directly going to renewables <@!738702049113538600>
general 2021-04-18 14:38:48 politics smh
general 2021-04-18 14:42:46 <#495286269459300364>
general 2021-04-18 14:42:52 also repost
creations-chat 2021-04-18 15:13:16 pretty nice but please dont repost 10k times like the tank yes ?
creations-chat 2021-04-18 15:17:06 usually way to go is no more than 2 variations of the same build + presence in 2 team pictures max 👍
creations-chat 2021-04-18 15:19:53 dont mean that, talking about <#384025409945337856> 
u have posted variations of ur tank 12 times, thats a bit too much, so would be nice to avoid similar things in the future
creations-chat 2021-04-18 15:23:04 tank no more funne <:bruhaps:646045387911725106>
general 2021-04-18 16:06:24 hackerman
general 2021-04-18 16:08:58 btw <@!484529511468236802> i would use a custom wedge that goes all the way for the top nose
general 2021-04-18 16:09:48 u can bind most custom angles to one key if u limit their travel
general 2021-04-18 16:10:11 then it doesnt matter how many there are
general 2021-04-18 16:13:28 never
he just previewed
general 2021-04-18 16:14:31 ok and
general 2021-04-18 16:15:51 <@!484529511468236802> come to my plot
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 17:47:14 <@!250275097431113728>
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 17:47:47 also bcs camera cant look down 90° ur tank looks even a lil bit wider than it actually is
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 17:48:04 so make it at least 2 blocks wider
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 17:49:41 making just the track covers and the top of the engine deck and the turret a bit wider should be enough and not too hard
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 18:11:43 hm
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 18:11:49 idk
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 18:11:59 is 2.5 blocks per side doable ?
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 18:42:52 maybe make the back 1 or 2 blocks shorter
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 18:43:01 then it should be perfect
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 19:14:56 if u can that would be good i think
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:21:00 something new in hof
plane-crazy 2021-04-18 21:21:06 impossible
general 2021-04-19 11:43:38 yo rick

general 2021-05-14 10:52:02 it wont
general 2021-05-14 10:52:11 just fucking angle and keep ur range
general 2021-05-14 10:53:01 germany in general is a rather bad experience
general 2021-05-14 10:53:18 tigers and especially panthers are very undertiered
general 2021-05-14 10:53:30 but the players are absolute bullshit
general 2021-05-14 10:54:03 panther a and f are awesome
general 2021-05-14 10:54:16 both belong to 6.3
general 2021-05-14 10:54:25 but they are at 5.7
general 2021-05-14 10:54:28 for reasons
general 2021-05-14 10:55:35 compare tiger with other 5.3 heavy tanks
general 2021-05-14 10:55:38 its way better
general 2021-05-14 10:55:51 kv 1 is worse
general 2021-05-14 10:55:57 and no 5.3 tank
general 2021-05-14 10:56:13 is that 5.3 ?
general 2021-05-14 10:56:30 it has worse armour and worse gun than tiger
general 2021-05-14 10:56:38 mobility probably worse too
general 2021-05-14 10:57:24 why
general 2021-05-14 10:57:56 8k is nothing
general 2021-05-14 10:58:24 all but two tanks between 5.3 and 8.0 france have above 9k repair
general 2021-05-14 11:01:22 soviets are great
general 2021-05-14 11:01:30 as long as u press w
general 2021-05-14 11:01:37 they have magic armour
general 2021-05-14 11:01:51 magic angle pen
general 2021-05-14 11:01:57 especially the 85
general 2021-05-14 11:02:28 still can pen jumbo ufp
unlike tiger or panther
general 2021-05-14 11:03:00 panther can pen jumbo but not reliable
general 2021-05-14 11:04:57 jumbo is overtiered
general 2021-05-14 11:04:59 but
general 2021-05-14 11:05:06 german players too dumb to aim
general 2021-05-14 11:05:11 so its still good
general 2021-05-14 11:06:01 with 75 u just shoot cupolas and barrels
general 2021-05-14 11:06:13 comet
general 2021-05-14 11:06:16 no reverse
general 2021-05-14 11:06:36 1 kph
general 2021-05-14 11:07:39 pt 76 is bad
general 2021-05-14 11:07:46 way too unreliable gun
general 2021-05-14 11:09:04 but tiger and panther have pretty stable guns
general 2021-05-14 11:09:14 speaking about that
general 2021-05-14 11:09:40 amx 50 surbias is first french tank so far that has decently stable gun
general 2021-05-14 11:09:44 i really like it
general 2021-05-14 11:09:57 120mm with 6 second reload
general 2021-05-14 11:10:05 very hard punch
general 2021-05-14 11:10:23 the 20mm is nice
general 2021-05-14 11:10:44 i like lorraine
general 2021-05-14 11:10:54 but it should be 7.0
general 2021-05-14 11:11:14 i still cant comprehend how lorraine is 7.7
general 2021-05-14 11:11:33 no
general 2021-05-14 11:11:37 cant kill maus
general 2021-05-14 11:12:20 boom
general 2021-05-14 11:12:41 i mean reliably kill
general 2021-05-14 11:13:14 single cap fields of poland is such a awesome map

creations-chat 2021-05-17 13:41:57 also the AAMs should be mounted on the wing tips 
only late modifications of the f5e had more than two missiles
creations-chat 2021-05-17 13:48:09 in the wt trailer there have still been missiles on the wing tips and the things in the middle are 6 bombs
its this loadout :
creations-chat 2021-05-17 13:50:09 the things under the wings are rocket pods so
creations-chat 2021-05-17 14:18:51 1. no fucking idiot counts that, also the time from u starting it to finishing it says nothing

general 2021-05-18 08:08:21 that doesnt make any sense for the question my guy
general 2021-05-18 08:08:45 u need to do x - x (1.1)^2 = 300
general 2021-05-18 08:09:08 wait
general 2021-05-18 08:09:16 i realized
general 2021-05-18 08:09:26 it isnt compound interest
general 2021-05-18 08:15:23 this is still wrong btw
general 2021-05-18 08:15:24 so
general 2021-05-18 08:17:47 if it is two years u need 150$ interest per year
and if its 10%
u need 1500$ investment
general 2021-05-18 08:17:54 almost too simple

general 2021-05-19 18:29:46 in 2018 presumably 
look at the date
bot-central 2021-05-19 20:37:16 the thing on the shoulder is the sign of the ss, still common around extreme right groups, should be seen as bad as a swas

creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:02:24 its pretty dumb to argue about ranks, especially if u urself dont have decent ones. tbh nothing below expert designer does say anything about the skill of someone, and even expert designer could have been obtained with a meme build. and even then its still nothing more than boosting ur own ego to define skill by ranks. if u want to compare skill u could look at builds, but if the difference isnt too big it really just comes down to personal taste

also maybe stop to argue over such dumb things we already have 2min slowmode

<@!767079066997620767> either dont get in the argument in the first place or just leave it. if its important to u to continue (and that please on a mature level) feel free to use dms
creations-chat 2021-05-20 14:08:04 thats nice and should be the norm, but if u scroll up u will sadly see a few individuals argue on each others skill by comparing ranks, thats why i did that little statement
general 2021-05-20 14:11:53 why
general 2021-05-20 14:12:04 why did u activate that weird steering mode

general 2021-06-06 12:44:19 how did that happen
general 2021-06-06 12:44:35 the earlier post is a better pic imo too
general 2021-06-06 12:44:39 and its still there
general 2021-06-06 12:45:43 the one thats now in hof is the old one that got deleted after the remake got hof
general 2021-06-06 12:46:27 contestwinner+ rank
general 2021-06-06 12:47:54 <@!407275829299773451> did miner say anything after it got put into hof ?
general 2021-06-06 12:48:10 so
general 2021-06-06 12:48:12 he said
general 2021-06-06 12:48:16 dont put it there
general 2021-06-06 12:48:21 but they still did
general 2021-06-06 12:48:22 ?
general 2021-06-06 12:50:48 he first got hof with the old one
then he remade it and got hof with the remake
so the hof post of the old one was deleted for obvious reasons
so far everything is right
but now over a year later they post the old one again
general 2021-06-06 12:50:53 the heck
general 2021-06-06 12:51:25 who decided it ?
general 2021-06-06 12:52:04 normaly hyper makes the stuff
general 2021-06-06 12:53:00 maybe the bot posts everything that gets a star emoji in creations
and someone found the old post that still had the star reaction and reacted with it
general 2021-06-06 12:54:49 he posted it instarblade before
general 2021-06-06 12:56:00 
general 2021-06-06 12:56:15 that was a minute after you posted <@!546223347025969164>
general 2021-06-06 12:56:28 he did
general 2021-06-06 12:57:41 im pretty convinced by this theory now
the old version in <#384025409945337856> still has the star reaction
unlike other stuff that has been removed from hof
general 2021-06-06 12:58:07 yes
general 2021-06-06 12:59:17 ik he stole it
general 2021-06-06 13:00:44 <@!407275829299773451> is there anything that got removed from hof other than rbks rick and morty flying head ?
general 2021-06-06 13:01:33 
general 2021-06-06 13:01:37 this was in hof once
general 2021-06-06 13:01:49 but it doesnt have the star reaction anymore
general 2021-06-06 13:01:58 the rocket still got the star reaction
general 2021-06-06 13:02:10 so probably someone pressed that
general 2021-06-06 13:02:23 bot saw something in creations got a star reaction
general 2021-06-06 13:02:28 bot posted it to hof
general 2021-06-06 13:04:03 how
general 2021-06-06 13:05:16 you mean it doesnt
otherwise that wouldnt bust my theory

bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:28:08 that might be buggy
bug-reports 2021-06-22 16:28:23 try how it works with a conveyor or rockets
general 2021-06-22 16:38:48 if we talk about mass, text blocks are probably lighter
but if we talk about weight helium is lighter due to its volume
general 2021-06-22 16:39:26 how
general 2021-06-22 16:39:48 it doesnt even have a hitbox
general 2021-06-22 16:39:57 weird
general 2021-06-22 16:39:58 tho
general 2021-06-22 16:40:12 how does one calculate mass in plane crazy
general 2021-06-22 16:40:38 that would be weight
general 2021-06-22 16:40:46 mass doesnt account for gravitation
general 2021-06-22 16:41:05 well yesnt
general 2021-06-22 16:41:37 when there is gravitation + something like a atmosphere they are not proportional
general 2021-06-22 16:42:42 if we take helium for example
it doesnt have any weight when u put it on a scale that isnt in a vacuum 
but it still has mass
general 2021-06-22 16:42:55 but that only works irl
general 2021-06-22 16:43:18 roblox doesnt have a atmosphere modeled as far as i know
general 2021-06-22 16:44:28 thats what i mean
general 2021-06-22 16:44:34 so with an atmosphere
general 2021-06-22 16:44:46 how do u determine the weight of helium
general 2021-06-22 16:45:13 u can probably do it molecular mass and that stuff
general 2021-06-22 16:46:50 u could do it with math 
or u can take a block with a vacuum inside, weigh that, fill it with helium and weigh again
general 2021-06-22 16:47:44 impossible in roblox probably
general 2021-06-22 16:48:48 everything has mass

general 2021-08-31 08:44:41 <@!467765396108476426> found a pic where its more intact
it was a 8 bladed coaxial swashplate with almost 2 plots diameter

general 2021-08-31 08:47:04 not even from proto
general 2021-08-31 08:49:19 also apart from that there was no point in asking sakura bcs the thing didnt fail due to bad construction, but due to there being way to much force put on the motors that should move the swashplate

also hi <@!757887014388367401> i got no idea who u are do i know u ?
creations-chat 2021-10-07 13:57:45 i think u could connect everything with text blocks, space it more apart and motorlock the lower part inside of a bigger helis fuselage
not sure tho as i still cant comprehend how its working
creations-chat 2021-10-07 14:03:26 <@!718409831639154718> ur ka50s rotor base is kinda fat, would have done it more like this, but other than that nice choppa

general 2021-10-13 10:56:33 like all the details and stuff ?
general 2021-10-13 10:57:59 if all the details expect the tracks are there he may have failed to lock them correctly bcs it requires several steps

general 2021-10-13 10:58:23 nope
general 2021-10-13 10:59:19 that would be very concerning if hacks are so advanced they can copy stuff from offline accounts

plane-crazy 2022-01-14 18:47:46 and the grey circles need to have no hitbox, thats why i posted the update picture
plane-crazy 2022-01-14 19:14:18 the thing in the video is about 500, the progress so far is almost 1000
bug-reports 2022-01-15 14:34:29 **Bug on Motor 1 speed configuration :**

certain speeds are set lower by a 0.01 increment if u try to configure them on a motor.
So far i found the following cases :

1.12 stays 1.12; 1.13 is set to 1.12; 1.14 is set to 1.13; 1.15 is set to 1.14; 1.16 is set to 1.15; 1.17 stays 1.17   
-> *a motor cant be configured to 1.16 speed*

0.56 stays 0.56; 0.57 is set to 0.56; 0.58 is set to 0.57; 0.59 stays 0.59 (video : https://streamable.com/u6iot9 )
-> *a motor cant be configured to 0.58 speed*

i also found that the motor speed is further set back by another 0.01 increment if the build is saved and then loaded :
for example, if a motor is configured to 0.58 speed, it gets set to 0.57 speed as explained above. When u now save the build and load it again, the motor has a speed configuration of 0.56
bug-reports 2022-01-15 14:55:24 i also found nothing in the dev console that seems even remotely related to that bug, forgot to say that
help 2022-01-15 19:01:07 once u submit something to hof, there is a vote in #vip-lounge where your build needs to get a score of 10 within 24 hours in order to get into hof. if the vote is successful, a mod or admin gives your build a star reaction wich makes the bot put the build into hof iirc

creations-chat 2022-01-27 12:51:21 idk if i understand correctly what u are trying to say, but my original statement was irony, contest winner is way easier to get provided you have enough time to play while the contest is going on
also there is no one with master supreme as of now, and for expert supreme u dont need anywhere near the skill level that is required to get hof or just contest winner, so expert supreme shouldnt get one into vip gen
creations-chat 2022-01-27 13:04:59 no problem with not understanding sarcasm, its hard to see through text sometimes 

also vip gen suggests the contest topics a lot of the time


anyway i argued over the "master rank should get vip gen access" thing with hyper quite a long time ago and if he didnt drastically change his opinion since then he still thinks master is easier to get than contest winner, so nothing will change about it anytime soon

creations-chat 2022-02-06 11:17:04 the intakes transition into the fuselage should be one continuous angle, the paintjob is kinda weird, the exhaust nozzle is a bit small and it would need a bit more detail like small decals, but if those points are addressed it may have a chance to get hof
creations-chat 2022-02-06 11:56:07 with the intake thing i meant the two bumps at the end of the wings, u should try to make it smoother there, and the exhaust nozzle i would make either very complicated like the one i created a few weeks ago or just make it straight and not with wedges

plane-crazy 2022-02-10 12:51:27 nice details but isnt the turret a bit too long
plane-crazy 2022-02-10 12:53:44 maybe try removing 1 or 2 blocks behind the mantlet and make the mantlet a block wider
plane-crazy 2022-02-10 12:54:24 also the barrel seems a bit short

no exposed motorlock there

creations-chat 2022-12-11 19:43:25 it also should be tilted quite a bit towards the left hand side 
and i'd bring some slight gradients into the paintjob to simulate wear and shadows

pretty shitty to more or less be alone developing a game like this
general 2022-12-14 15:14:25 you messed up the canopy and the part behind quite a bit
general 2022-12-14 15:20:53 edz
not in this server anymore
general 2022-12-14 15:22:46 will there be file transfer from pc1 to pc2?
general 2022-12-14 15:27:55 everyone awaken from death
well atleast the few that didnt leave
general 2022-12-14 15:46:09 now get that to be everywhere
general 2022-12-14 15:48:46 idk how exactly it works but could motors for example work on the client itself and then send the results to the server or something like that?
cause with a lot of motors the ping causes them to reset quite often
general 2022-12-14 15:51:01 in pc2 or wdym?
plane-crazy 2022-12-14 16:26:12 you kinda got your priorities wrong
hangar is better than the jet <:EYES:525319504721608705>
general 2022-12-14 16:33:19 its the most upvoted build to this day
general 2022-12-15 16:46:25 there really are not that many aircraft at top tier (apart from the mandatory 3 ka50s that are always there)
general 2022-12-15 16:46:44 tbh cas is the strongest around 5.7-6.7
general 2022-12-15 16:47:21 and why exactly would u take a pershing to 10.7
general 2022-12-15 16:47:38 also you can kill ka50s with 7.62
general 2022-12-15 16:47:43 not that hard
general 2022-12-15 16:50:16 only for air
general 2022-12-15 16:51:32 its decent but only rear aspect
general 2022-12-15 16:53:52 why would you buy a fw190
there are like a million in the tech tree

creations-chat 2022-12-17 11:30:56 What in the world is wrong with you???

His build is 10 times better than the bland single color shit you build(and while you’re trying really hard to make your stuff look better with editing and shaders, lemme tell you something, the only thing that does is show that your build isn’t even good enough to stand on its own)

You’re downvoting his build out of pure spite because it shows you just how far your jet is from being good or let alone the best one out there. And then the reason you come up with to cover that fact is that he doesn’t have a good pc so you can see a few stupid pixels in his screenshot??

Just accept that you’re not as good as you’d like to be and stop trying to make others look worse you prick
creations-chat 2022-12-17 12:15:51 i never said the screenshots were good, i was saying they are the way they are bcs they are a bit cropped in on a screen with bad resolution
my point is that a shitty screenshot is maybe a reason to not upvote a build, but for sure isnt a reason to downvote one
general 2022-12-17 13:02:54 nice but your skids look way too far outwards, i would change that
general 2022-12-17 13:03:26 you sure
general 2022-12-17 13:04:53 ah its your support beams
they should be angled more downwards than they are rn
general 2022-12-17 13:06:00 then you could make the support beams two differently angled trails to mimic the curve
general 2022-12-17 13:06:32 the
general 2022-12-17 13:06:35 what is that
general 2022-12-17 13:07:02 gotta be a prototype
general 2022-12-17 13:08:07 has a different nose, canopy and turret tho
general 2022-12-17 13:08:49 g has curved supports
general 2022-12-17 13:08:58 they shouldnt be that hard to make
general 2022-12-17 13:09:30 kill it with fire
general 2022-12-17 13:10:08 just two trails with different angles should be fine at that scale
general 2022-12-17 13:11:24 motors+pistons
general 2022-12-17 13:12:14 you wanna tell me you actually want to fly with it?
general 2022-12-17 13:12:30 oh well
general 2022-12-17 13:16:20 he did but its way too small
general 2022-12-17 13:20:57 you guys make me afraid of finishing my jet
i planned on excessive piston use to make up for the motor shortage
general 2022-12-17 13:22:15 ill try
general 2022-12-17 13:22:53 dont have the capacity for that anymore anyway
i have 300 motors for basically the entire jet left
general 2022-12-17 13:24:41 <@447221768520859659> did you submit your jet to hof yet?
general 2022-12-17 13:27:12 that isnt edited is it

general 2022-12-17 13:30:22 you can get quite nice unedited images in wt
general 2022-12-17 13:30:30 did this a while back

general 2022-12-17 13:37:35 <@447221768520859659> how about you add a few working trails and we do a touchdown scene at the airport, make good screenshots and then you get hof
general 2022-12-17 13:38:22 thinking rear wheels on the ground with a bit of smoke
general 2022-12-17 13:39:58 low gravity and a few rockets to help maneuvering
you only need to get the thing into position
general 2022-12-17 13:41:21 something like that
general 2022-12-17 13:43:21 pretty sure it was first used on rockets in mid-late 2020
general 2022-12-17 13:45:30 im gonna try to make a nosecone with trails
that should leave aerodynamics unharmed and use less space
general 2022-12-17 13:45:59 thats me
general 2022-12-17 13:46:48 even did a moving nozzle a while back
general 2022-12-17 13:46:53 lemme look for it

general 2022-12-17 13:48:08 https://streamable.com/helcxw
general 2022-12-17 13:49:07 figuring out how to make is the hard part, not actually building it
general 2022-12-17 13:49:31 doesnt have anything with their hitboxes, they are angled
general 2022-12-17 13:49:43 nah its fine actually
general 2022-12-17 13:50:22 but i abandoned the moving nozzle, wouldnt work in a plane that is supposed to fly
general 2022-12-17 13:50:40 also it doesnt work as good anymore as motor lag got worse
general 2022-12-17 13:55:10 its about this big, upper half not as relevant 
about 900 blocks, tho the one in the video should be around 300-400 as it lacks a lot of stuff
general 2022-12-17 13:56:36 thats the non moving nozzle i will use in a actual jet, has a lot more detail and is about 2.5k blocks
general 2022-12-17 13:57:11 show
general 2022-12-17 13:57:48 thats spawned in
general 2022-12-17 13:58:09 2.5k

general 2022-12-17 13:59:26 interesting but not quite how a jet nozzle works
general 2022-12-17 14:00:40 ah 
but the outside changes angle
general 2022-12-17 14:01:48 ye its a interesting mechanism
general 2022-12-17 14:01:58 not really useable in builds tho sadly
general 2022-12-17 14:03:38 show
general 2022-12-17 14:04:15 ah hi
general 2022-12-17 14:05:08 you are saying that as if its sure i will ever finish my current one
general 2022-12-17 14:07:13 i took over 4 months to finish my last build
and that was in 2020
general 2022-12-17 14:09:48 <@559568621312147476> found your f15 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/497142796961054721/1025005215067406396

plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:45:09 looks like something you can build after a few hours of first playing the game
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:46:20 my first ever build was more shape accurate than that
to be fair it was just a mig25 but still
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:46:55 mig25 is a easier shape
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:47:57 nose is fucked up but the rest is fine i think
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:48:44 motorlocked angles, maybe some cylinders etc
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:49:20 to round out the edges
plane-crazy 2022-12-19 01:53:22 ok in retrospect my first build wasnt all that accurate
to be fair that was before anyone utilized motorlock in builds tho

general 2022-12-30 14:46:55 tbh even fighters are way more fun to play in ground battles than in air battles
general 2022-12-30 14:47:11 nicer dogfights in ground rb too
general 2022-12-30 14:47:29 cause no markers or 50 teammates going for the same guy
general 2022-12-30 14:48:38 i think 90% of my aim9b kills is just vautours
general 2022-12-30 14:49:44 how
i dont see those very often
plane-crazy 2023-01-03 18:22:24 From my experience it’s easy while you’re building the thing but a while after you just forget how it works
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 17:58:24 ios photos also classifies a image of a link as art
plane-crazy 2023-01-16 17:58:26 sooo
