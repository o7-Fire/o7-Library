The Tale of Cup (577930642520801301)
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 02:03:38 Does anyone know if theres a way to make it night with the same lighting as day?  I'm trying to build the USS Defiant, so far it's going fine, but it's really hard to build, all the colors of the blocks mix and I have to build upside down.
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 19:35:52 What do you think I'm doing, I do build in day, it not help.
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 19:38:18 no no, from DS9.
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 19:39:02 I haven't watched the movie, but I know theres more defiant class ships.
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 19:39:56 Ah, I see,  well, I'm building the Defiant
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 19:40:34 Yea, exactly that, I found I built it a bit too big, I have to fold alot, making in an interior will be really hard.
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 19:41:29 I'm not sure how those look, but in the last episode I watched, it looked like a kling-on ship.
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 19:41:50 Well, at least my plane crazy version will be kind of accurate.
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 19:42:44 oh,  that's quite curvy, but aren't they all. Looks preetty cool.
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 19:43:38 Looks pretty cool, but small, looks more like some russian cruiser tbh, I don't think amereicans had red decks.
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 19:43:57 Thats pretty cool.
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 19:44:11 Tho, american, the name is amerrican?
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 19:45:32 Didn't you say it's the Uss Missouri?
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 19:45:46 ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 19:46:11 Looks amazing, tho... thats not a destroyer lol.
plane-crazy 2022-06-22 19:47:22 But, it has 4 triple barrel turrets, very well armored carrier.

help 2022-06-22 20:28:19 Anyone know how I could make a flush airlock door?
help 2022-06-22 21:16:13 Does anyone know to make large text, 3x3 and/or rotated.
help 2022-06-23 02:19:51 How can I make a circular sliding door? Like... on some space ships, theres a shuttle bay hatch on the bottom.
help 2022-06-23 20:52:14 Is there any easier way to build upside down? Over half my build is upside down and in the shade.

help 2022-06-23 21:58:54 I made a fold for my ship but suddenly it no longer works, the motor refuses to turn, max torque is at 1000, speed is at 15, nothings blocking it, it worked yesterday, but yesterday I had less blockss on the fold.
help 2022-06-24 02:29:55 I'm building the uss defiant, but it appears I don't have much space for it, I want to fit as much as I can in here, but today,  my rear fold decided not to work. The motor that connected the rear half of the ship with the rest suddenly refused to work, yesterday it worked just fine.
help 2022-06-24 02:34:26 Apart from doing "undo" in saves, I don't think so.
help 2022-06-24 02:39:00 I need help with my ship, I can't wait until pc2 comes out with bigger plots to build the ship, my ship basically broke.
help 2022-06-24 20:27:08 Do motors have a max amount of blocks it can lift/move? My motor suddenly stopped working for some reason.
help 2022-06-24 20:34:24 Sure, like what? I'm working on the uss defiant rn.
help 2022-06-24 20:48:37 for some reason the middle motor doesn't work when I attach blocks to the gray part of it. Does anyone know what to do? I can't continue building if this keeps up.

Edit: I even added rocket engines to the folded part, it didn't even budge, it's like theres a barrier, like I'm in build mode, but I'm not.
bug-reports 2022-06-24 21:33:38 I'm trying to unfold my star ship, but for some reason the top fold refuses to unfold, I'm not sure if its the motor or the plot, but no matter what I did, the gray part of the motor didn't move s long as something was attached to it. I tried adding super engines to push it into place, but it didn't even budge,  I can't continue my build.
bug-reports 2022-06-24 22:41:09 hm, ok, what might that do? You're just reversing the way it's facing.
bug-reports 2022-06-24 23:01:10 Wow, that somehow worked... except my ship was flinged into the void.
bug-reports 2022-06-24 23:02:44 But for some reason, it didn't work with anchor on, any how, when I did turn off anchor, it flew away.
bug-reports 2022-06-24 23:13:43 1
help 2022-06-24 23:15:04 I don't have the gravity slider,  someone helped me in <#498473314445033472> , I guess I should just add some helium so the ship doesn't fly into the void, then somehow fit a bunch more folds.
help 2022-06-24 23:16:05 No, the thing is, it's far from any other blocks that aren't part. of the rear half, and the problem was that the motor wasn't moving a bit.
help 2022-06-25 17:07:55 I'm making a star ship (from star trek),  and I accidentally didn't give the ship a middle block, but the bridge is obviously supposed to be positioned in the middle, my question is, how could I place the captain's chair in the middle of the bridge, if it doesn't have a middle block.
help 2022-06-25 17:09:30 Yea sure, no problem. Folded or unfolded?
help 2022-06-25 17:12:12 It's the USS Defiant, the sensor array (front head) is 10 blocks wide.
help 2022-06-25 17:12:24 
help 2022-06-25 17:13:08 the bridge is in half of the front part
help 2022-06-25 17:13:17 its in deck 1.
help 2022-06-25 17:13:38 the top
help 2022-06-25 17:14:02 behind the light, on the gray top.
help 2022-06-25 17:14:59 But it has to be half a block right of it's position.
help 2022-06-25 17:15:24 I motor lock it in
help 2022-06-25 17:16:05 I could try, but it wont be easy, I never motor locked anything, motor locking a detailed bridge inside deck 1 isnt easy
help 2022-06-25 17:17:38 This is deck 1, I suppose I could motor lock it, and puut the motors down to in front of it.
help 2022-06-25 17:18:23 keep in mind the ship doesn't have a middle part. Alr,  thanks fur ur halp.
help 2022-06-25 17:21:45 Wait, how would I move the bridge half a block to the side?
help 2022-06-25 17:24:16 I'm not sure I have enough space in the front part for it.
help 2022-06-25 18:38:50 How might I be able to add rotated block + wedge text on my ship, like the defiant of course, on deck 1, it has the name.
help 2022-06-25 23:34:42 I'm making the USS Defiant, but it's missing a few important parts, the sides and the cells, but I can't find a way to fold those into place, there isn't much space (I could've made it better, but theres no undoing) Any suggestions on how and where I should make a fold?
help 2022-06-25 23:34:55 
help 2022-06-25 23:40:07 It's a  folded train. I'm not sure what t he question is.
help 2022-06-25 23:50:22 Oh, well then turn on anti copy blacklist
help 2022-06-26 02:38:33 That’s a good idea, if I even knew how to do that, plus anyway, I don’t think theres space for that, that’s like putting a hull inside an identical hull, or a bigger into a smaller, the cells are bigger than the sides, the sides are the size of the hull. But thanks for the help.
help 2022-06-26 02:39:15 Yes, tho, you really need to change up the proportions, or just make the ship longer, it isn’t looking too good, but hey, idk, I make ww2 carriers.
bug-reports 2022-06-26 15:35:22 For some reason I can't move my ship downward, theres nothing blocking it, I checked, had this problem for a while.
bug-reports 2022-06-26 15:48:28 I haven't used more than 1 text block in that build,  what do you mean by translate? Like can I see the text block?  No, I was never able to bring it downward after I removed a ladder.
bug-reports 2022-06-26 15:49:52 I just tried running the delete tool over the floor, nothing there.
bug-reports 2022-06-26 15:49:58 yea it does
bug-reports 2022-06-26 21:30:30 How is that even possible..? And how do I get rid of it.
bug-reports 2022-06-26 22:06:10 ight, tho I can't raise the build, unless I destroy the entire stern of the ship, not sure how a block could have even gotten there.
bug-reports 2022-06-26 22:30:48 pc (mac)
bug-reports 2022-06-26 22:32:56 As I said, That's impossible, unless I destroy my whole stern side.
general 2022-06-26 22:39:46 Yep, I do.
general 2022-06-26 22:40:05 hi ho
bug-reports 2022-06-26 23:03:58 How doo I reload?
bug-reports 2022-06-26 23:04:22 Oh, and I fonud I have a random white block under my ship
bug-reports 2022-06-26 23:04:37 oh... alrrighty, not sure if it'll work, but sure.
bug-reports 2022-06-26 23:05:11 I reloaded it, Can't find any excess blocks
bug-reports 2022-06-26 23:07:36 No invisible or excess blocks.
bug-reports 2022-06-26 23:08:01 oof
bug-reports 2022-06-27 00:50:00 But problem is I can't move it, I would have to destroy so much of it.
help 2022-06-27 00:57:21 For some reason my carrier won't float normally, I've added a bunch of helium in places to make it stable, and the bottom is flat, but it keeps getting the same ressult, it wobbles and falls to the side, and capsizes.
help 2022-06-27 00:57:32 
help 2022-06-27 01:00:25 like ballast on the starboard? (btw, in the image the ship is falling to the starboard side)
help 2022-06-27 01:01:03 alright, thanks
help 2022-06-27 01:01:17 I'ma just work on adding a ton of guns and aa
help 2022-06-27 01:01:22 ight
bug-reports 2022-06-27 02:14:38 o, so ur saying the block is for sure somehow 1 block below the ground?, Ight, I suppose I could do that.
bug-reports 2022-06-27 02:24:54 yea, it worked, thanks for the help.
bug-reports 2022-06-27 02:25:07 I wonder how that block got underground.
bug-reports 2022-06-27 20:10:30 No, why is that important?
bug-reports 2022-06-28 15:30:28 Oh, well, thanks for the help, I finally got my ship a radar.
plane-crazy 2022-06-29 13:39:11 I just searched up CC-1, that ship doesn't exist, but CLC-1 exists. Plus thats clearly a battle ship. (or heavy cruiser)
plane-crazy 2022-06-29 13:40:36 Since when, lexington is a carrier (CV-16)
plane-crazy 2022-06-29 13:41:10 I found USS Northampton tho (CLC-1 later changed to CC-1
plane-crazy 2022-06-29 13:41:47 Oh, so your making the lexington carrier... just before it was a carrier.
plane-crazy 2022-06-29 13:42:20 oh, that explains it.
plane-crazy 2022-06-29 13:43:51 ight

help 2022-07-20 15:19:56 I motor locked wing panels into half blocks to make a roof on my steam-boat, but when I disconnected the motor lock thing, the rear wing panels jump up, and it sometimes falls off the ship.
help 2022-07-21 00:29:51 I made a cruiser turret, but I can't figure out how to patch those holes while still having the cannons be able to move.
help 2022-07-21 12:00:15 But then how would the barrel move, it’s really long and extends into the turret of course,, doesn’t the motor have to be attached to the turret body.
help 2022-07-21 13:36:21 ooh, I motor locked it wrong, I did it like this
help 2022-07-21 13:37:31 So I motor lock the outer barrel into the turret and the inner barrel (the part thats connected to the motor, and holds the rocket/ammo)
help 2022-07-21 13:41:34 Nvm, still didn't work.
help 2022-07-21 13:49:56 now this happened..
help 2022-07-21 13:50:06 oof, well then idk.
help 2022-07-21 13:51:38 Well of course there are blocks around it, the turret.
help 2022-07-21 14:11:57 sad, well, not moving barrrel is fine too I suppose
help 2022-07-21 14:15:14 whenerver I motor lock stuff it always flops onto something and never sticks on the object, I'm making a smoll turret rn.
help 2022-07-21 14:24:30 I motor locked wood wing panels onto my ship to be like a roof, but whenever I disconnect the motor lock part, the back of the wing panels boops upward.
help 2022-07-21 14:27:44 idk
help 2022-07-21 14:28:13 anyone know how to make the turning speed of a ship with a wing panel rudder faster? My steam boat turns really slow.
help 2022-07-21 14:33:53 Yea, but I don't have an inside hull for my bote.
help 2022-07-21 14:34:33 You mean use magnets on the wood wing panels? Ight, tho magnets never work when I use them.
help 2022-07-21 14:35:48 ight, I'll try, tho last time I used a magnet, it couldn't pick up a bit of metal at max strength and distance.
help 2022-07-21 14:41:05 strangely, when I turned on the magent, the roof flew away.
help 2022-07-21 14:42:40 I turned on toggle, range 40, strength 10
help 2022-07-21 14:43:51 weld on
help 2022-07-21 14:47:21 when I turned on  magnte, it jumped up before I disconnected.
help 2022-07-21 18:42:53 I'm making the USS Cobia, but I feel like the bow should be a bit longer, it dooesn't look right, any one have ideas on how to make it longer, and still smooth and good-looking? The wedges are 1x4.
help 2022-07-21 19:11:43 Well then I'll figure out angle locking, tho don't you need space inside the ship for that? Cuz I don't have alot.
help 2022-07-21 19:40:25 well... sorta, There aren't any 1x5+ wedges, that the problem
help 2022-07-21 19:40:49 And I understand why ur like.. "bro what"
help 2022-07-21 19:41:27 Would be convenient for me if there were 1x5 or 1x6 wedges.
help 2022-07-21 19:48:40 just wondering is its possible to anngle lock a hull with this shape
help 2022-07-21 19:50:09 Should I change the bow anyway? or is it good?
help 2022-07-21 20:30:48 Its already really thin, the deck is 5 blocks wide, beam of 8
help 2022-07-21 20:31:48 I tried deploying it into water, for some reason the ship always capsized to the right, even tho no water entered the sship, and I filled the bottom with ballast beams.
help 2022-07-22 14:33:33 Should I add anything? this is the best angle.
help 2022-07-22 14:38:00 You can't, I think its a flying device, I seen a yt use it, its like a drone.
help 2022-07-22 14:41:22 maybe they used photo mode
help 2022-07-22 14:47:35 never heard of "k r n l"
creations-chat 2022-07-22 15:06:08 sure
creations-chat 2022-07-22 15:08:43 
creations-chat 2022-07-22 15:10:47 The deck of the entire ship is black, so I used disconnectors to make it all black, personally, it looks better that way, even tho its wierd.
creations-chat 2022-07-22 15:14:10 hm, no I haven't I should've thought of that.
creations-chat 2022-07-22 15:17:09 Yea I do, I made a space shuttle using one. Tho I'm not too sure If I made it right.
help 2022-07-22 16:32:35 Oh
creations-chat 2022-07-23 01:02:01 Oh, well then I underestimated how good I am at plane crazy,
creations-chat 2022-08-03 03:12:05 Anyone know why people hate tug boats, I never see people build any, and now I  built one, and its getting so many downvotes.. personally I don't understand, but thats what anyone would say. Not sure what I should make next, a tug boat?
creations-chat 2022-08-03 03:16:35 I made another post without the barge. I didn't know if I should add it or not, I was bored so.I added it.
Oh, btw, these are the reference images I used, mostly the first few. https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:400857/mmsi:338631000/imo:9219501/vessel:BRENDAN_J_BOUCHARD#Photos
Edit: I got a random wierd idea, i'll add a conveyor engine to the barge to fling it away, probably a dumb idea.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 03:18:45 Why thank you.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 03:21:51 Alright then, I'll tone down the main colors by 15, add text 1x1s with some life circle things, and random circles, idk, I added ladders, windows, and railings already, maybe too many ladders.
Edit: The red paint was "215, 30, 0" the white was mostly "200, 200, 200"
creations-chat 2022-08-03 13:00:57 alright, tho I didn't use a lakeboat/laker to make the barge.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 13:03:00 Well i'm not saying that, rn I just want to know whats wrong with it, and what to improve on.

Edit: I'm really not sure what to add to it, it looks almost thee same as it does in real life (almost, because the tower is a bit too tall) The walls are obviously empty apart from windows, All I could probably do is remove saturation, fix some details, add 2 random life circle things.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 13:11:50 Thanks for the advice.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 13:14:55 Haha funni, thanks for your thoughts.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 13:21:49 You're kinda right, but thats also how the tug looked, and its not half submerged, new york tugs don't have tall hulls.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 13:25:55 Oh well, I'm exaggerating, I just can't figure out wha could be added rn.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 13:28:01 Haven't seen any, but I just saw a harrier in my server.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 13:34:21 I'm tryring to add windows to my ship.. but circles are censored now..
creations-chat 2022-08-03 13:41:26 Yea that worked, thanks.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 14:41:48 Beecause, it looks like theres hardly much effort, just a bunch of colors.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 14:44:45 Your not getting bullied, its just really low standard compared to everything else, I'm sorry to say, but it looks low-effort
creations-chat 2022-08-03 14:47:20 You should look at references for things you build, and see other's builds for ideas on how to make more detail, ...ok now I think you're getting bullied in some way.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 14:49:29 That I agree with. I'm not being rude, and noone should, its a new player, but even if your new, you should have some sense of building and design in your brain.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 14:51:38 Cuz, this is a building game and server, not a place to love gay and lesbian people. I personally am really not crazy about the pride thing at all.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 14:53:42 That I agree with, but don't expect lots of upvotes for a white platform with a pride flag on it.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 14:55:53 Sure, you can take a look at my builds for inspiration maybe, or ideas, just search up my name and <#384025409945337856> in the search bar.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 15:00:07 Personally, I didn't know the plane crazy discord existed until last year (I played for a while, 2 years maybe)
Try looking at other's builds for inspiration and details and stuff, what I do, is use several reference images
creations-chat 2022-08-03 15:02:49 Don't be so rude, he's new,  I personally support him.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 15:07:07 Good point, even though the build still sucked.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 16:16:01 No way, now I disaagree with you, this is a good chill server.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 16:18:32 Better than the last at least, you should make anything but a flag, flags are just a few colored blocks, maybe make a plane,  or a ww2 truck, that would get upvotes.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 18:07:11 Is my tug any better? I added poles, ladder colors, I lowered the height of the flying bridge, I added the ability to tug ships from the side, and just added minor details. (I'm not trying to showcase, just asking if its any better)
creations-chat 2022-08-03 18:09:20 Then what do I add? As far as I know, thats plenty of detail and all the real tug boat has on it.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 18:12:50 Why thank you, at least someone likes it, I don't see what could be wrong with it, it's got plenty of details.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 18:20:45 Well I'm sorry thats how tug boats look, I'll make the color darker, but Im not moving the flying bridge any lower, it's already 4 blocks above the rest.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 18:25:55 Oh no.
creations-chat 2022-08-03 18:29:25 Not sure why you say that,  but I wouldn't want to ever. Anyway I'm not a good plane builder.

help 2022-08-08 02:49:04 Anyone know how I could make a small 19th century naval cannon?
general 2022-08-08 19:48:57 I don't know if this guy is from this server or a different one (I'm only in 2 roblox servers) but, I think he's trying to scam people... duh. Just wanted to point that out.
help 2022-08-09 14:40:20 Opinions? Should I make the ship shorter, like I'm doing rn (then the ship would have 13 cannon holes rather than 15, as its supposed to) or should I keep it with its original length. The second image has more ugly masts.
help 2022-08-09 14:53:01 That would be really hard, it's already nearly accurate real ship is 12 meters wide, this one is 11 meters wide,  cuz it has a middle point.
help 2022-08-09 14:57:46 Yes, but realistically, a block is a meter wide, high, long.
help 2022-08-09 15:05:01 probably, yea,  but not in <#504436696021204992>
help 2022-08-09 16:51:26 I can't balance my tall-ship, it has a flat hull, and is well balanced, plus a ballast beam on the portside, yet it falls to the starboard side, but doesn't sink.
help 2022-08-09 17:31:14 uh... sorta, yea, that is dumb, but by that I meant, In build mode.. its balanced.. no excess blocks on the side.
creations-chat 2022-08-10 00:28:53 Anyone know why my ship is going 28 sps when I'm in pilot seat, but 7 or less sps when standing, pretty odd.
creations-chat 2022-08-10 00:33:11 fard paint
bug-reports 2022-08-10 00:36:45 my ship is going 28 sps when I'm in pilot seat, but 7 or less sps when standing, is it still same speed??
creations-chat 2022-08-10 02:49:29 <@918581321004089364> Are those sails foldable?  it looks like they are because. they're made of motors and ropes. I need to improve my ship's sails, how'd you make it?
creations-chat 2022-08-10 15:11:01 no,  never, I don't see whats wrong with it.
creations-chat 2022-08-14 15:58:09 Should I remake the superstructure of my aircraft carrier? Also, to the people who downvoted my french ship, I just want to know what I should change. My guess is the superstructure, or just to add more detail.
creations-chat 2022-08-14 16:02:21 Its made from ropes
creations-chat 2022-08-14 16:20:31 So I just spread the bottom of the hull with ballast beams set to 0.28 density?
creations-chat 2022-08-14 16:30:27 But design-wise, should I change the superstructure? I think I should.
creations-chat 2022-08-15 00:40:22 Anyone know how to make good carrier planes? Ridiculously, I built a tinny starter plane, and it flew terribly on my carrier build, but flew fine without the carrier.
creations-chat 2022-08-15 00:42:30 So much negative critics in creations chat 💀
creations-chat 2022-08-15 00:55:03 It worked, but still sucked, I couldn't land the tiny plane anywhere, it couldn't fly straight.
help 2022-08-15 17:17:36 I need to make a plane for my aircraft carrier, but for some reason, the planes I build on my carrier deck keep flying in circles, I could never land it, it just does barrel rolls. Anyone have a good design or something?
help 2022-08-15 17:21:57 that didnt work
help 2022-08-15 17:30:13 just fold it..
help 2022-08-15 17:30:19 but prob upper
help 2022-08-15 17:33:01 but what about the wings
help 2022-08-15 17:51:01 what, why
help 2022-08-15 18:23:58 Should I add anything to my carrier? apart from a plane which I'm alreday struggling to add.
help 2022-08-15 18:56:24 Wow, thats cool, my ship isnt much as good as yours, I can't even put a working plane on it.
help 2022-08-15 19:00:37 oh nice, mine has 2k... its an aircraft carrier
help 2022-08-15 19:01:34 Not that big, half as big as it should be, elevator can only hold small starter planes
help 2022-08-15 21:05:07 that looks really flat, just use a half wedge (from wedges) with half wedge (from half blocks) on top 4 times, to make circle, or use wedges..
help 2022-08-15 21:05:20 I could demonstrate, but am eat rn.
help 2022-08-15 21:35:09 Half wedge
help 2022-08-15 21:35:22 Triangle wedge
help 2022-08-15 21:35:40 Half Wedge
help 2022-08-15 21:36:13 
help 2022-08-15 21:38:04 I think its a meter, like in minecraft, roblox r6 models are 2 meters tall, and as far as I know, most human beings I seen are 5,2 - 5,8 , that can be rounded to 2 meters. So I'm saying, a r6 player is 2 meters tall, a block is a meter tall.
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 21:45:03 is this normal in pc? I don't see it that much.
help 2022-08-15 22:50:38 thats more complicated, but correct

help 2022-08-15 22:54:03 Maybe scattered white stripes, but make sure it blends well.
creations-chat 2022-08-16 15:38:42 What are you talking about? The 2 aircraft carriers, no, enough people like it,  and so do I, if you don't like it, or ships, thats not my problem.
creations-chat 2022-08-16 20:52:34 I still don't know what your talking about.
help 2022-08-19 02:09:21 Anyone know how to stabilize space craft, mine keep spinning and turning.

creations-chat 2022-08-20 03:24:38 Request a role, post good detailed pictures for "evidence"
creations-chat 2022-08-20 03:42:33 wow, I muust see it.
creations-chat 2022-09-03 23:11:21 I like it, its just really wide..
creations-chat 2022-09-03 23:14:09 I fixed the wings a bit. With detail, idk what I'm supposed to do, it a plane it doesn't have random valves and stuff, I put plenty of detail imo, a cockpit, livery, side number, wing supports.
creations-chat 2022-09-03 23:17:10 I mentioned I don't build planes and I know hardly anything about motorlocking wings and other wing and plane detail. I know how to motorlock, but no idea how to hide it, or keep it from flying off.
creations-chat 2022-09-03 23:58:10 Whats wrong with it?
creations-chat 2022-09-04 00:00:27 What
help 2022-09-04 00:07:09 How could I motorlock a  hull design onto my ship, and should I make the funnel wider/longer? it seems short.
help 2022-09-04 00:08:15 I'm not sure, try using trails or half wedges if you want it really thin.
creations-chat 2022-09-04 00:10:57 I'm not that great at making guns, but I used no motorlock as I mentioned, as I suck at that and don't know where/how to hide it, I'm. trying to do camo rn, if you have suggestions tho, please say. the whole ship is folded 3 times, the bow isn't folded, it's normally made with wedges, I think its fine but I'm not a big fan.
help 2022-09-04 01:19:47 Oh thanks, that would be great.
help 2022-09-04 15:01:26 Anyone have designs for double barreled destroyer turrets? My turrets suck (except one)
help 2022-09-04 15:10:17 how to fix..?
help 2022-09-04 15:18:27 the wall is made of half block
help 2022-09-04 20:02:59 because its cylindrical, treat it like its a submarine, you should add a few wings and ballast blocks somewhere
creations-chat 2022-09-04 20:04:43 does anyone have a design for a double-barreled destroyer turret? I need better turrets for my ship.
creations-chat 2022-09-05 01:58:25 Are submarines supposed to do that? It flew down to -5000 altitude.
creations-chat 2022-09-05 02:04:47 Anyone know how I could fit torpedo tubes in the front of my sub, while still being able to turn quickly, cuz turning using a rudder sucks.
help 2022-09-10 02:00:22 Thats cool.
help 2022-09-10 02:00:59 How could I make my imperial shuttle craft stable? (apaart from helium, I alreaedy know that but thats tought o do when your ship isnt a square.
help 2022-09-10 02:31:19 A video of my Shuttle Craft flipping over a lot
help 2022-09-10 15:12:14 I'm building an imperial tiridium shuttle, where should I place the helium, its just rolling over alot rn, I put the helium in a square cieling in main thingy, and a small amount in the nose, its balanced I guess when landed, when taking off the nose dips down when moving forward, idk what to do.
help 2022-09-10 15:38:34 https://streamable.com/njzn8a Anyone know how to fix this? I put helium as the cieling inside and helium in the nose, when landed its balanced well.
help 2022-09-10 22:04:04 Thankss for the tip, also, do you the think the design of it is at least decent, I don't think it is, but I don't know what to add as theres no insignias on it, I'll add guns later, I just want to fix it rn, then I'll figure out the movement.
help 2022-09-10 22:11:37 Hm, its still flipping over, I guess I just didnt put enough helium in the nose? Its falling forward,  and can't just float there.
help 2022-09-10 22:15:53 Probably, The engine of course is in the back, its a conveyor engine at 5 speed. I tried putting more helium in the nose, somehow not enough
help 2022-09-10 22:16:16 Oh wait, just realized the engine isnt even in the middle of the ship.
help 2022-09-10 22:17:12 Anything I should do about the detailing?
help 2022-09-10 22:18:51 Maybe I should put more helium on the main top wing, might lift it up a bit and stabilize it.
help 2022-09-10 22:25:55 I added a bunch of helium to the nose, when its landed its floating the nose up, when its taking off, it still falls down.
help 2022-09-10 22:30:11 Now it flies.. but. its super wobbly, I don't think landing is possible
help 2022-09-10 22:31:20 iddk, I'm not much of a space ship maker.
help 2022-09-10 22:32:09 I still need to make pitch, maybe that could fix it..?
help 2022-09-11 14:31:35 Damn thats cool
help 2022-09-11 14:33:20 Try curving it in the front of the cockpit and a wedge in the back of it, maybe 1x3, If thats not hat you mean by canopy, maybe the back,  you could try using a slightly longer wedge.
help 2022-09-11 14:34:32 Add wings to the sides and top, you should watch a video about it, boat basics episode whatever.
help 2022-09-11 14:36:48 There was a glitch last week that made everyone noobs, I guess you still have it?

creations-chat 2022-09-12 02:22:59 I found this weird thing that someone made, It was hard taking the picture cuz it kept teleporting me away, Somehow this new mechanism is able to. teleport you creations under the baseplate, or flip it or something.

creations-chat 2022-09-14 22:23:53 I suck at hover drives and stuff, the hover thrusteres just went flying...
creations-chat 2022-09-15 00:27:44 Didn't really work that well. Not how its supposed to anyway.
creations-chat 2022-09-15 00:29:52 I did, I guess, I flew the wrong way, plus, how do I turn it off? When I start the engines it just flies away backwarrds.
creations-chat 2022-09-15 00:32:28 Cool helicopter

creations-chat 2022-09-15 01:55:32 Should I build a star wars NR Farstar or a CR90?  Farstar is just cr 90 but cooler, it has a hangar bay.
help 2022-09-15 02:08:46 Honestly, I'm just make a cr90 now, mon calamari is huge anyway, someone said it looks like a bunch of turds... Not sure which cr90 I should make, I found an aircraft carrier version (NR Farstar)
help 2022-09-15 02:36:20 what
help 2022-09-15 02:36:43 I don't know.
help 2022-09-15 02:37:54 You clearly aren't good at determining word meanings, like in ELA....
help 2022-09-15 02:38:38 Its the word "Sure"
help 2022-09-15 02:40:15 Yes you can, it looks like a star wars vessel.  put helium in it, try to balance it with the air, assuming thats a star ship.
help 2022-09-15 03:00:37 meh, I alrready started the corvette, its not too hard to make. Heres some pictures of the bridge, theres a smol interior.
help 2022-09-15 11:29:48 I’m not sure how, adding detail to a cylinder isn’t easy, there isn’t much detail but ur right the colors suck.
help 2022-09-15 19:55:18 BUt how exactly could I make details if its cylinder shaped.
help 2022-09-15 21:02:00 Hm, use a cutter since its less than 3x3
help 2022-09-15 21:02:33 guh
help 2022-09-15 21:02:42 or use a pyrarmind
help 2022-09-15 21:04:19 Yea, you said 3x3
help 2022-09-15 21:04:39 pyramids and cutters are 1x1 therefore they will fit in the nose of your plane
help 2022-09-15 21:05:40 oh
help 2022-09-15 21:05:47 then a half ball might do good
help 2022-09-15 21:06:12 That will be an interesting bomber.
help 2022-09-15 21:07:25 sure.
help 2022-09-16 01:10:47 Use propellors, except that takes up space, also, you should motor lock blocks over the engine or make a custom one.
creations-chat 2022-09-16 01:12:25 Anyone know how I could make a forcefield illusion, kinda, that you can still fly through, like for star wars ship hangars.
help 2022-09-16 01:18:34 Well, you don't have to motorlock it, you can just make custom engines, would look better, and add conveyor engines in it, theres a tutorial on yt somewhere.
help 2022-09-16 01:42:39 Anyone know how I could make a star wars hangar force field?
creations-chat 2022-09-16 02:03:43 Does this hull thing look good? or does it look fat? Also, the turret is motorlocked, its not that tall.
creations-chat 2022-09-16 02:06:45 Should I remove the 1x4 beam a block under the red line? I think it looks wierd, but replacing it with a wedge is kinda wierd too.
creations-chat 2022-09-16 02:10:39 Really? Its supposed to be a circlular tube, its a modified cr90 corvette if you couldn't tell (NR Farstar specifically).
creations-chat 2022-09-16 02:13:30 But should I replace the beams under the red line with wedges? Or maybe half blocks.
help 2022-09-16 02:41:30 angle locked? What why, I'm making a forcefield, I just need a wall you can fly through basically.
help 2022-09-16 02:43:19 That would be a super fast sliding door?
help 2022-09-16 02:47:23 Tho idk how to make it open at all, its a very big force field, 2 in total really. (should I make the completed or incomplete version of my ship, its a conversion of the cr90?)

creations-chat 2022-09-18 02:40:29 Unfortunately didn't work.
creations-chat 2022-09-18 02:42:32 rip ok, I'll use a piano keyboard instead of normal one, and purple square instead of blue, gon look kinda goofy cuz roblox thinks a blue square is inappropriate.
creations-chat 2022-09-18 02:45:38 <:Upvote:490311647492309004> Edit: People above and under me are kinda right.

help 2022-09-18 20:11:09 I'm sure how tho cuz the front is made of wedges, and tbh, I deleted it now.
help 2022-09-18 20:17:03 I'm rebuilding it, I think it may have been cuz of the metal material.
help 2022-09-18 20:29:51 Yea it still sucks.
help 2022-09-18 20:33:12 at least now its not flipping over

help 2022-09-22 20:13:39 I made a cessna 172 type plane, but it keeps flying up, the blue circle is 1 block behind the yellow one, and 2 blocks higher than the center of gravity circle, how could I fix it's flight without destroying the look of the plane?
help 2022-09-22 20:14:15 use one motor set to lock, and a half block on it attached to the wing.
help 2022-09-22 20:16:28 hmm... maybe build a 5x5 circle, or a 3x3 cylinder, with a hole in the middle, put a motor there, and build the turret.
help 2022-09-22 20:17:27

help 2022-09-22 20:21:29 more than I could fit.
help 2022-09-22 20:22:34 no, they aren't able to retract, but I didn't know how to make cessna landing gear, so I made retractable ones cuz it looks good.

help 2022-11-14 21:16:15 Right, left is tiny.
help 2022-11-14 21:24:34 Yea, but theres still a huge visible hole there, plus, it wont float.
help 2022-11-14 21:27:14 
help 2022-11-14 21:52:34 I guess I could, then I'd have to figure out how to float it correctly and if it'll even work.
help 2022-11-14 21:53:53 Hull and waterline. It probably won't float to the waterline if I remove the main hull.
help 2022-11-14 21:55:17 
help 2022-11-14 21:56:34 I can't fold the hull on cuz I had to fold the superstructure on.

help 2022-11-15 22:44:03 Why is my tiny plane working fine in test but terrible on an aircraft carrier, the ailerons are hardly working, once I get it to turn after a while, it just spins in circles.
help 2022-11-15 23:31:17 On landd
help 2022-11-15 23:58:33 oh.. so my plane is fine?
help 2022-11-15 23:59:16 Do you have any good designs for a us naval plane? My carrier is the USS Midway. (carried, corsairs, panthers and avengers)
help 2022-11-16 00:03:49 I have no idea, could be your internet I guess... or the server. My carrier is 5800 blocks and doesn't lag much.
help 2022-11-16 00:07:04 idk, leemme check rn ig. 110ms rn
help 2022-11-16 00:20:45 no, I use motors, motors are enough, if not (as it is with my destroyer) I just ad another motor under the motor.
help 2022-11-16 00:33:43 odd
help 2022-11-16 00:33:49 max torque?
help 2022-11-16 00:37:08 No, why should they be?
help 2022-11-16 00:37:28 What issues.
help 2022-11-16 00:37:39 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
help 2022-11-16 00:38:04 that, that's regarding a tiny plane, it's just not able to turn
help 2022-11-16 00:38:36 also, do you know how to reverse motorlock? theres no space on my plot to make the stern
help 2022-11-16 00:38:37 ok
help 2022-11-16 00:39:27 The top.
help 2022-11-16 00:40:40 I've seen people rerverse motorlock a superstructure out of the hull.
help 2022-11-16 00:40:52 what, the gun decks...?
help 2022-11-16 00:41:30 The motor... or the cameras holding it up.?
help 2022-11-16 00:42:24 I mean to motorlock a hull up out of the hull.
help 2022-11-16 00:42:26 hold on
help 2022-11-16 00:44:29 Green is the hull below waterline, I ned to get that on the stern, or on the top. Red is the plot border.
help 2022-11-16 00:48:39 I don't think I can do that, I spent a while on it. (it's honeslty a very important part of the ship.) This is the top of the fold. And the ship unfolded.
help 2022-11-16 00:50:31 Ight then, I'll try that. So on the bottom I remove the red part and 1 block of the waterline, bring the build 3 blocks down, motorlock the red part out on the bottom and motorlock the hull and waterline an everything at the top.
help 2022-11-16 00:51:14 Ight...
help 2022-11-16 00:51:19 but thats a good idea
help 2022-11-16 00:51:27 might work
help 2022-11-16 00:52:51 Alright, I'll just scour youtube for a guy reverses motorlocking an island out of the hull and copy them.
help 2022-11-16 03:48:41 No, it can, I have a Mac book air and it handles 6300 blocks just fine.
help 2022-11-16 03:49:45 It’s already huge, I made the ship plenty long. The superstructure is slightly shorter than the hull probably, or more, and is in the middle of the ship.
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:03:34 <@860154094072102923> You should fix the front landing gear on your plane, the wheels are huge and discolored, but I think the plane is nice.
creations-chat 2022-11-20 00:06:02 And I just realized its very inaccurate.
creations-chat 2022-11-20 14:53:32 <@773913961883369515> Nice ship, I just think the saucer is a little low, the interior shouldn't bleed into the hull and you should try maybe adding windows, a shuttle bay and/or an insignia, that would be nice. You should repost with more pictures very awesome build.
creations-chat 2022-11-20 15:42:56 Maybe the bridge, it looks... plain, try adding range finders or towers or masts on it. Also, try adding rafts and/or windows and railings. Maybe the stern too, the superstructure looks too far back.
creations-chat 2022-11-20 16:03:32 Wings are doo doo. nose has some holes.
creations-chat 2022-11-20 18:40:43 Alright, I tried making the uss defiant, it didn't go well though.
creations-chat 2022-11-20 18:42:51 Still looks kinda odd, too big.
creations-chat 2022-11-20 18:44:53 agreed, wdym by new-ish tho...?
creations-chat 2022-11-20 19:55:50 Not sure what I could say about it, but it looks really weird, looks more like a modern-ish destroyer.
creations-chat 2022-11-20 19:58:50 Idk, but landing crafts are big rectangles, and amphibious assault ships (LHD thing) are basically aircraft carriers.
creations-chat 2022-11-20 20:01:15 Yea, I know.
creations-chat 2022-11-20 20:03:51 You mean escort/light aircraft carriers? that's what I found, ships like the casablanca or bogue have been made.
creations-chat 2022-11-20 20:36:01 Why not
creations-chat 2022-11-21 00:13:29 Why is the propellor like that??????? And why is it all purple.
creations-chat 2022-11-21 00:15:48 Looks good, fix the nose tho, it looks pretty odd.
creations-chat 2022-11-21 00:18:27 I think the area in front of the wings is a bit too long. What plane is that, it looks nice.
creations-chat 2022-11-21 00:20:48 I like it, but I think the lower black engine part is too exposed, just try changing the color of the armor and propellors and make the armor thing a bit bigger I guess, if you know what I mean. Yea the water wheel doesn't really do the trick.
creations-chat 2022-11-21 00:22:50 I never criticize (unless he build actually sucks like a shredder or a rainbow box.), happy to help, I look forward to seeing the rest, but I'm not much of a plane specialist.
help 2022-11-21 00:24:50 Hey, I think I've seen that ship before, damn awesome one.
creations-chat 2022-11-21 00:25:05 Yep.
help 2022-11-21 00:25:30 Nose looks kind of long. 
edit: hold on, are those minecraft clouds in the sky?
help 2022-11-21 00:27:59 Does anyone know if that kind of ship is bigger than a CVE? I want to know if I could build an accurately scaled ship like that one.
Edit: just realized, anyone know how to motor-lock something out of the hull of a ship? I'm out of space.
creations-chat 2022-11-21 00:30:32 Wait, that's what it's supposed to be, well then it looks very inaccurate.
help 2022-11-21 00:31:48 Btw, anyone know if your ship needs to float in order to get a shipwright rank? Cuz my ship has no space for a stern hull.
help 2022-11-21 00:32:45 Well either way I have a disturbing big hole in my ship.
help 2022-11-21 00:34:30 o. k.
help 2022-11-21 00:35:47 So uh yeah, anyone know how  can patch a hole like that, the ship has 4 folds btw. (top folds are the stern where it has no more space to build.
help 2022-11-21 20:28:18 Oh, I was trying to find it in <#384025409945337856> , do you know if its there?
creations-chat 2022-11-21 20:29:53 <@413827183790915607> Awesome ship! Personally I just think you slightly over detailed in some places, by that I mean adding things without a purpose, also, how dd you make the torpedo launcher, I need a better design for my destroyer.
help 2022-11-21 20:30:03 Oh damn

help 2022-11-25 15:04:24 Thats not very clear, but I can attempt it.
help 2022-11-25 15:07:13 Is this decent? I'm not train person either.
help 2022-11-25 16:12:38 That seems complicated, does what I already have look decent? Also, how do I make one block train wheels right under the car.
help 2022-11-25 16:13:34 Yea, I triede that.
help 2022-11-25 16:14:19 I did that..
help 2022-11-25 19:04:16 Which is better, what should I add, and how could I make the wheels?

help 2022-12-04 16:50:31 Yea, I redid it, now its dis. But I think its still not the best.
help 2022-12-04 16:50:59 Use wedges or angle lock it. Nice ship btw.
help 2022-12-04 18:20:04 In some cases that could be correct, but either way would be really hard to make.
help 2022-12-04 18:21:24 Yeah, you're right, based on this picture, it's entirely wrong. https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR3qW2ZSnBDaySjGSbYIscXxa4jEFvtI7dIKvWx050PK3Tkq6w-JCB52Ec5jhRpBtpvfEk&usqp=CAU now I know why noone built this plane.

help 2022-12-04 20:03:57 I always just use weedges, its easier

help 2022-12-04 20:05:43 Oh, do you still have it? Could I see how you did it?
help 2022-12-04 20:05:48 oh alright
help 2022-12-04 20:06:21 I kinda gave up onn mine rn tbh lol, I can't figure out the nose right, or the elevation of the paint and stuff.
help 2022-12-04 20:07:07 I've made on before, any passenger craft I've made is alway too small.
creations-chat 2022-12-04 20:13:57 Damn, that's really nice, should fix the landing gear tho. The nose has holes, but Its better than mine.
creations-chat 2022-12-04 20:16:54 Just use trails, horns, signs and text to make it. The paint probably isn't too hard, depends on the livery, TWA is kind of funky but it's possible, Indi air is just a red line, KLM is just a blue line, they all have a gray unerside.
creations-chat 2022-12-04 20:19:05 Ima redo mine, it's kinda odd.
creations-chat 2022-12-04 20:38:25 Yeah then you should use red signs (1x3).

help 2023-01-12 03:09:06 Nope
help 2023-01-12 03:26:03 Huh
creations-chat 2023-01-12 03:31:42 <@456226577798135808> reaction bot broke, you should repost I guess, nice plane, no paint or decals tho….
help 2023-01-12 23:28:03 Torus shaped space station. Any tips on the details for the torus or how I could make ops? I wanted to put circular windows in a circle for ops (and a radar atop) or 1 or 4 huge windows angled up like a wedge but idk how.
help 2023-01-12 23:30:12 That doesnt help.
help 2023-01-12 23:40:58 I dont feel like it.
help 2023-01-12 23:41:21 A reference to DS9, its the main command module or the bridge of a space station
help 2023-01-12 23:42:25 How?? you have to angle lock.
help 2023-01-12 23:43:57 That doesn't help..
help 2023-01-12 23:47:05 k, thanks, it helped.
help 2023-01-13 00:29:54 looks good, btw. I just finished making ops, on my station, any.. ideas? I  feel like the middle part is just a short wand.
help 2023-01-13 00:30:55 the upper wings look like they aren't attached to the plane. I think thats all, just fix the wings.
help 2023-01-13 00:32:59 yep
help 2023-01-13 00:33:09 bro what
help 2023-01-13 00:33:13 no
help 2023-01-13 00:35:23 Theres also a bunch of expose motor lock, so maybe put half blocks on the wings. See how that looks.
help 2023-01-13 00:36:30 k
help 2023-01-13 00:37:18 any tips? The strange mid part is bothering me abit.
help 2023-01-13 00:42:18 so a dome under the middle then drop down, and add some radars? I was thinking to add a circular thingy around it, to make it look kinda wider.
help 2023-01-13 00:43:22 oof ok, Ill have to just about destroy the useless vent, but a greenhouse dome is better
help 2023-01-13 01:01:30 no problem
help 2023-01-13 01:51:05 Depends on what theme, I imedietely thought of a triangular pointed fighter.
help 2023-01-13 01:53:27 I just finished my space station, but it doesn't really look finished or right on the outside, what can I improve?
creations-chat 2023-01-13 01:54:50 <@842012556825985106> Because it's basically an oversized gun on a platform with a rectangle attached to it. It has no detail and its huge. I haven't actually seen the C-RAM.
creations-chat 2023-01-13 01:58:01 onestly, I dont and yet... Im not a bad builder, you can make better without motorlock.
help 2023-01-13 01:59:16 I mean how should I change the main cylinder thingy int eh middle cuz it looks goofy, and what *kind* of detail?
creations-chat 2023-01-13 02:03:19 Damn, looks great.
creations-chat 2023-01-13 02:05:58 Anyone have some feedback on this space station? What to add?
creations-chat 2023-01-13 02:08:31 like? Anything I should change to the middle section?
creations-chat 2023-01-13 02:11:03 Yea, I was thinking about the paint, but idk how or where to change it, except for the radars and stuff. Ima redo the middle prat, make it longer.
creations-chat 2023-01-13 02:14:18 I was thinking to add another little circle between the torus and the middle. So I should make the torus slightly more round (with edge wedges), modify the paint, and make the middle part longer and wider.
creations-chat 2023-01-13 02:17:17 I mean, Ive only tried making a space station once, barley anyone made a torus station anyway. I make more ships, you could check my builds.
help 2023-01-13 03:47:13 So i just add a few vents circles and plates to the ring, I added radars to the middle and reworked the lower part.
help 2023-01-13 04:04:49 K, I added ocking ports on each side.

creations-chat 2023-01-13 22:31:25 Is there some kind of ratio of blocks to helium blocks you need to make something hover? Just wondering, cuz I dont want to spend an eternity on helium

creations-chat 2023-01-13 23:02:07 looks the same

creations-chat 2023-01-13 23:08:35 Provide other pictures and we'd believe you.
creations-chat 2023-01-13 23:19:16 barely looks different
creations-chat 2023-01-13 23:21:45 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
help 2023-01-14 00:40:27 no, its in the midle
help 2023-01-14 00:40:31 theres no uue for a motor there anyway
creations-chat 2023-01-14 00:52:17 <:Upvote:490311647492309004> but true, the tail is weird
creations-chat 2023-01-14 00:54:58 nnot sure, jsut make it a little shorter
help 2023-01-14 23:56:56 How do I make a angled and motorlocked funnel?
creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:42:14 What do you mean, it looks excellent.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:44:39 True, might as well call it a custom, I looked over it for a second, it's not identical.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 01:46:53 I don't know, maybe add some radar or scanner on the bottom of the nose.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:00:47 Yer critisizing someone's build for minor inaccuracies while your builds are not as good. His plane looks awesome, might as well just call it a custom and you'd be happy.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 02:05:06 Because the plane was detailed and looked good. I upvoted the build.
help 2023-01-15 02:09:01 Is this ship short , and what should I add to the stern???
help 2023-01-15 02:13:21 I feel like the bridge looks weird
help 2023-01-15 02:41:40 You only have 2 wings, planes have 5 wings
help 2023-01-15 02:42:08 As I had said, copy the top and maybe motor lock some radar or sensor
help 2023-01-15 02:46:41 Odd, I guess the game just demands you have rear elevators.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:16:31 Is that a cruiser? Cuz its around the size of my carrier.
help 2023-01-15 03:50:04 How could I make a good crane in this space?
creations-chat 2023-01-15 03:53:49 How could I make a better crane in this spce?
creations-chat 2023-01-15 04:04:02 damn, looks cool.
creations-chat 2023-01-15 04:18:21 Ive seen someone put friction blocks on the waterline of a ship which made it float really well, just want to confirm this works...    (Ima just put here that I put 337 friction blocks to exclude from block counts)
creations-chat 2023-01-15 04:55:29 How could I improve this? (obviously the stern isn't finished, I pent way too long on this)
creations-chat 2023-01-15 17:28:17 ***Long rudder*** Somehow my ship still has slow turning, how 2 fix?
creations-chat 2023-01-15 17:33:11 Bot told me not to spam.....  Anyone know a good realistic smoke configuration?
creations-chat 2023-01-15 17:37:16 Realistic smoke...
creations-chat 2023-01-15 17:55:59 <:Upvote:490311647492309004>
creations-chat 2023-01-15 18:22:33 the superstructure is really small
creations-chat 2023-01-15 18:26:37 <:Upvote:490311647492309004>
creations-chat 2023-01-16 04:58:17 <@1018940961310658600> Honestly the camp has colors too bright, you can motorlock the camp with just one motor and some delta wings, you don’t have to rebuild anything, and honestly, the bridge and superstructure is lacking detail, not even on close examination cuz I’m on phone rn, it doesn’t look that similar. I jus realized a bunch of imperfectancies
creations-chat 2023-01-16 16:22:17 K, one moment, I recently woke up <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2023-01-16 18:33:05 Annyone have tips/feedback? It doesnt look/feel done.
creations-chat 2023-01-16 18:53:42 Anyone have a good tiny wooden life boat design?
creations-chat 2023-01-16 19:09:48 My ship has pretty terrible turning.
creations-chat 2023-01-16 23:37:43 Which deck is better?
creations-chat 2023-01-16 23:43:10 k then, I tried adding a poop deck (I think thats It) iin the back of the schooner but it doesnt look the best
creations-chat 2023-01-16 23:46:16 Any tips, the poop deck looks weird
creations-chat 2023-01-16 23:49:24 Oh.. that looks a bit more dry tho.
creations-chat 2023-01-17 00:18:24 What can I do to this to... make it more fancy? maybe smaller windows?
creations-chat 2023-01-17 00:20:28 Pretty awesome, now just add deck details and make the torpedoes black.. preferably.
creations-chat 2023-01-17 00:23:26 As in a black square emoji on the top block?
creations-chat 2023-01-17 00:27:13 Motorlock for decks i really good, the deck def should be grayer
creations-chat 2023-01-17 00:35:52 How could I make this window thing better? I suck at motorlock so...
creations-chat 2023-01-17 00:41:44 
creations-chat 2023-01-17 00:44:05 Thats it? thats just going to look iinto the room, which is empty, an will probably remain empty..
creations-chat 2023-01-17 00:49:49 Is this good..?
creations-chat 2023-01-17 00:56:17 Uh..
creations-chat 2023-01-17 00:58:47 Yea Im doing that, hull is white. The ship is highly inspired by Zephxix's Merle.
creations-chat 2023-01-17 01:01:31 Idk, intakes? I don't make jets.
creations-chat 2023-01-18 00:41:52 clearly theres space for windows radars and a superstructure, superstructure isn't finished.
creations-chat 2023-01-18 00:45:18 damn whaat the heck is the superstructure
creations-chat 2023-01-18 00:47:37 what
creations-chat 2023-01-18 02:26:13 Wdym, I 400 is cool, submarine carrier
creations-chat 2023-01-18 03:26:54 Oh, I barely seen the I-400
creations-chat 2023-01-19 02:53:12 <@272125457703501826> even tho the Lexington is supposed to have a superstructure like that, the bridge just looks too tiny, and the smoke from the funnel just looks odd
creations-chat 2023-01-20 03:51:10 <@942893388091498546> what’s an HMS and USS Ford? Haven’t heard of it. How come your ship is flat..ish?
creations-chat 2023-01-20 13:23:37 Yea but hms isn’t a real carrier, neither is uss ford and uss gerald r ford doesn’t look like that
general 2023-01-22 18:24:46 ||Based on minecraft not plane crazy|| How could I minimize the quarter deck of this ship, or just make it better, it looks too long.
general 2023-01-22 18:27:17 this is an off-topic channel and the biggest server Im in, also the only public/community server im in.
general 2023-01-22 18:27:46 Why what?
plane-crazy 2023-05-12 21:37:04 The US
creations-chat 2023-05-12 21:42:18 <@1056144535023001650> awesome shuttle. This is mine… but its in astrocraft, also only one of its kind:
creations-chat 2023-06-11 00:21:45 <@375281006091173890> Is just downvoting every build… i checked
creations-chat 2023-06-11 00:31:49 Right… like that none of the recent creations are any good
creations-chat 2023-06-11 00:35:48 I guess we have different taste idk
creations-chat 2023-06-11 00:38:03 I wasnt specifying that, it looks fine, i mean the actual builds
creations-chat 2023-06-11 01:29:58 Ive never even seen that
general 2023-07-07 01:38:37 Why does everyone want eskeline out? I scrolled up, dont see anything bad

help 2023-07-17 20:45:17 Yes
help 2023-07-17 20:45:49 No, happens on my carrier.
creations-chat 2023-07-17 20:47:24 Yeah, the community kinda sucks, I heard someone say theres nothing good in <#384025409945337856> . Some people just downvote every build they see…
creations-chat 2023-07-17 20:50:22 Really nice
creations-chat 2023-07-17 20:52:24 Kinda why i moved to astrocraft, f3x just seems better and simple after I discovered it. ||Theres a lot of noobs tho, I mean, when I first joined I built a runabout that got commissioned to a faction whilst other players need to ask for help just to get out of or move a ship.||
creations-chat 2023-07-17 20:54:27 Good job.. I guess
creations-chat 2023-07-17 20:59:17 Why? Theres lots of effort in some of the recent builds, and many nice ships and planes if you search for them. ||(Some nice starships I saw got massively downvoted)|| you upvoted black pearl, nice <:clueless:942802644043464734>
creations-chat 2023-07-17 22:08:11 Sheesh, nice ship
