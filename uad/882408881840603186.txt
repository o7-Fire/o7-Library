plane-crazy 2021-12-19 16:47:56 bro fix ur game
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 16:47:57 sshitty
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 16:48:16 pvp impossible
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 16:48:43 u shoot someone and they go invis bc of "client replication errors" or whatever
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 16:48:56 the massive shreddder lost every cutter but still killed me lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 16:49:29 parts floating in the air
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 16:49:34 delayed explosions
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 16:50:03 hitreg is also broken
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 16:50:09 sometimes rockets and just go through people

plane-crazy 2021-12-19 17:14:10 pvp now is just
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 17:14:14 shredders
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 17:14:21 12rockets on 3 wheels
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 17:14:37 and some super fast plane that is impossible to kill due to lag and hitreg
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 17:14:53 same with boats
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 17:15:04 boats is kinda boring bc not many people use them
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 17:15:12 due to limited space and movement
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 17:15:20 and being typically slower
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 17:18:32 rare to find a FUN pvp server rn
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 17:18:54 only good servers are priv servers
plane-crazy 2021-12-19 17:19:10 bc u need to pay robux or be ranked for them so most shredder noobs arent on there

plane-crazy 2021-12-21 00:24:25 apparently there is an "inf terrain generation script" client side
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 00:24:26 lo
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 00:25:01 if i tested it on an alt would i get banned?

plane-crazy 2021-12-21 00:26:52 on plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 00:26:55 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 00:27:12 whats he even doing
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 00:27:33 the only functional exploit i can think of is a camera aimbot in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 00:27:49 but the bullets and speed of vehicles would make it impossible to use
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 00:28:12 probs using cmd-x
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 00:28:15 or inf yield

plane-crazy 2021-12-21 00:35:31 he got out changed the motors to make it possible then bent it perfectly
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 00:35:43 which isnt rlly possible on a human hand bc they use the same muscles or smt
