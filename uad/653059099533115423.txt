creations-chat 2021-07-31 17:34:52 <@456226577798135808> , Don’t ever use legacy glass for that, and Deck is so empty, not much detail there.
creations-chat 2021-07-31 17:43:54 Legacy glass on the bridge window, and for the deck, add like a mini jet , if not, make the runway and taxiway straighter with delta wings, how is it stupid, your carrier is empty
creations-chat 2021-07-31 17:46:33 Then leave it ugly, show us interior of below deck and bridge
creations-chat 2021-07-31 17:49:44 Show us this detailed interior
creations-chat 2021-07-31 17:52:23 Not much detail , How about the bridge
creations-chat 2021-07-31 18:05:07 It’s not even in the water <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>, beats the whole purpose of a carrier, might as well make a runway
creations-chat 2021-07-31 18:07:44 How it works, man I didn’t know carriers don’t touch the water, my bad, I get that’s because of the lag , but at least let it hit the water and anchor it
creations-chat 2021-07-31 18:11:41 No I don’t know what you are talking about, when I anchor in the ocean with a big build I don’t lag
creations-chat 2021-07-31 18:14:17 I guess that’s the problem <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2021-07-31 18:43:06 Oh that’s what I forgot to mention clearly
