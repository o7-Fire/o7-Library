general 2022-01-01 00:13:30 Hello everyone ðŸ™‚ , if you have a creation that you want to post in the creations channel (that follows rule 5 of no creation spamming), do you need permission from an admin to post a screenshot? or can you just post right away and it be removed by an admin if it was inapropriate? Please respond im new here so i know nothing about sharing builds, ive been told there is some kind of requirment, thank you to anyone who can tell me ðŸ™‚
