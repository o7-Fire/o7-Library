plane-crazy 2020-05-18 12:41:45 There was a contest?

general 2020-05-20 14:16:44 Yes
general 2020-05-20 14:17:12 We definitely need a new airport
general 2020-05-20 14:17:23 With an actual interior this time lol
general 2020-05-20 14:25:05 Yeah we all know what happened last time there was gonna be a new map
general 2020-05-20 14:25:53 And the innovation inc base
general 2020-05-20 14:26:04 And water ramps
general 2020-05-20 14:26:54 Oh don‚Äôt forget the random flat rock area
general 2020-05-20 14:27:40 Nope
general 2020-05-20 14:29:24 If he does add the new airport it should be decently far away from the base
general 2020-05-20 14:30:10 Yeah
general 2020-05-20 14:30:35 Some of my planes are as long as the current airport‚Äôs runway lol
general 2020-05-20 14:30:42 I can only use the base
general 2020-05-20 14:31:10 Well the base is sort of a runway
general 2020-05-20 14:32:48 It should at least be as long as the base
creations-chat 2020-05-28 22:11:25 Boeing 747-400 (Still sort of a work in progress)

plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:23:15 If you're applying for a rank you can't use helium in your plane, right?
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:24:15 k
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:24:27 there goes my idea to use the 747 :/
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:24:31 oh well
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:24:41 I could use my 737 or something
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:24:58 oh well the problem is just weight
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:25:27 oh right
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:25:47 It can take off at around 150 studs per second with helium
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:25:59 so I guess I could make it faster
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 00:29:46 yes

creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:53:00 Major work in progress but I need ppl's opinions before I go any further (yes I know I've done delta before)
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:59:53 What torque setting were you using for them
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:01:26 ^
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:02:58 > Still haven't tested the effects of glass, ice or sand
<@!743010779229454346>  ice makes things lose traction, and I don‚Äôt think glass or sand change much
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:04:30 Maybe, but I haven‚Äôt tried. I‚Äôve used ice while testing a monorail
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:06:01 An ice skater mech sounds hard to control tho
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:07:44 Yeah that sounds like it would work
You should try it bc I can‚Äôt build mechs
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:09:16 Well then maybe I should learn how
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:11:11 Yeah but they‚Äôre easy to hit once you do take off. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a fast mech in plane crazy
