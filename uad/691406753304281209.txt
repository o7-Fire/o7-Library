plane-crazy 2021-02-03 20:35:55 sounds like <#623337136267067393>

bot-central 2021-02-03 23:26:21 ?shelp
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:27:14 &suggest Motor 3 (Allows for degree control and locking)
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:28:18 &suggest Rope be a different object than normal ones. Since it is a constraint, this'll be easy to do, but make it where we can attach objects together further than 2 blocks away
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:29:10 &suggest make lights able to be turned on or off before launching
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:29:53 bruh
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:30:02 no wonder the game has such basic stuff
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:30:08 no one can suggest anything
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:30:39 yeah, but I'm not that dedicated towards roblox or discord
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:30:49 I have a life lmao
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:31:03 Imagine if we had logistics tho
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:31:04 üòÆ
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:31:18 instead of depending on keybinds
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:31:47 <@!158294656113836032> I don't have a role so I cant suggest, but r yall planning on adding logistics anytime?
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:31:54 Imagine the creations
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:31:59 fully automated ships
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:32:04 to tell him
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:32:06 why else
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:32:25 üòÆ
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:32:28 they have logistics?
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:33:38 lmao he aint some oracle or demon I'm gonna be shy or afraid to talk to. He just be another dude, just don't be trigger happy with the ping
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:34:04 well set ur status to do not disturb
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:34:16 it exists for a reason
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:34:37 if rickje had his to online I woulda pinged him
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:35:09 and thus I followed the rules
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:35:48 I wasn't asking them to add it, just seeing if they already planned
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:35:56 I already made it clear I wanted it
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:40:26 lol this whole chat is way too discord
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:44:30 I guess I could never reach the brain power yall have üòî
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 23:44:47 https://gyazo.com/da886252cf2ccc6f295f5f2a6a5e22e5
plane-crazy 2021-02-03 23:44:56 Idk about u, but I'm building a flying castle
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:06:19 do motor 2's not reset?
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:06:50 ohhhhhh
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:14:16 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:14:24 ok so I built an omni copter
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:14:42 and Im using motor 2 to tilt the turbines to move it
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:15:09 https://gyazo.com/2af36b21e0481d3f4062497496a8cf74
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:15:26 but for some reason, no matter what, the top ones and the bottom ones move in opposite directions of each other
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:15:33 I tried inverting
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:15:38 I tried rotating the motor
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:15:48 yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:33:38 when she says its too long :c
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:06:02 I don't know HOW it actually does anything, but for some reason when these pistons are shut, the motor doesnt get any lift
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:06:08 https://gyazo.com/6c2379d527aff264e314cecfc71f31f2
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:07:15 they don't, I made them half blocks
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:07:47 I don't mind it being opened, the pistons are there for that anyway
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:07:59 just dont know why they became a necessity
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:08:25 turning, with lift, but not enough
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:08:34 it just falls from its weight
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:08:51 lol its enough when its opened apparently
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:23:04 is there anything like the motor, but its just a joint?
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:26:02 august
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:44:40 https://gyazo.com/59861e18ac47c91f118cfcebbf2bb350
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:44:46 lol my engines are like the death star core
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:44:54 1 good shot in, and the whole thing explodes
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:45:05 but u gotta hit the right spot
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:45:13 these things can take some hit
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 06:45:49 yuh, but these can survive hits on the shell without even damaging the blades
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:19:12 https://gyazo.com/14335e4066f8fc2df575f2af0687b0e7
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:19:14 mmmm
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:21:22 what a great game
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:21:40 never have I seen a roblox game able to handle stuff like this
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:21:58 look at how much is going on at once on that thing
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:22:22 and its keeping it so _**smooth**_
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 07:25:58 the engines steer btw
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 08:20:24 lmao, every plane seat needs an elevator with a suspension system
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 15:37:55 Mmmm I wanna keep working on my flying fortress, but I have to give plasma for 80 bucks üòî
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 15:38:18 Ew
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 15:38:30 Rather buy some carts
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 15:38:35 And gas
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 15:38:38 And a haircut
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 20:19:32 https://gyazo.com/d68b1f1e134778d8eb9dfd715d3d214c
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 20:19:34 mmmm
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 20:20:00 now the top isnt a easy spot to blow the whole engine up
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 20:27:56 has anyone else built something like this yet?
https://gyazo.com/aea4872776b77f729b3f75c122bbdc01
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 20:28:13 idea is inspired by the heli carrier from avengers
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 20:28:40 i purposely gave the engines weakpoints, since defending stuff like that is half the fun üòâ
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 20:36:39 https://gyazo.com/afda8849e7bdd3c6049397dbaf58875c
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 20:36:42 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 20:36:49 elevator for the pilot seat to get down
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:31:25 where can I find the half inner wedge, and the upper half triangle wedge?
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:31:51 sure, if even half wedges were tehre
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:32:22 
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:32:24 tryna make this smooth
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:32:31 but I cant find the wedge for it
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:34:11 
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:34:15 looking for this wedge, but half
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:36:15 also, why r these 2 parts welding together?
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:46:58 my first plane
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:48:00 most of it isnt used when it flys
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:48:14 https://gyazo.com/1906c371a3530b4bc418e93ad67472d5
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:48:48 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:48:54 its janky af
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:48:57 but it flys well
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:49:46 lol, u dont understand how many hours I was sitting there fine tuning the rockets, suspension, and wing panels on this thing
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:57:32 I wish we had the ability to select and move multiple blocks
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:57:38 instead of the whole ship
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 22:57:59 cuz I'd love to lower some stuff so I can build between it and stuff above it
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 17:52:30 anyone else from time to time have their build be like "Oh, this progress? Nah I liked the old version better, I aint gonna actually save."
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 18:48:24 https://gyazo.com/9e335eff94f2948111119742abc51daf
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 18:48:26 mmmm
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 18:48:34 all the engines are updated
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 18:48:50 so now there is less wobble in them
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 18:49:37 lol u might as well be using an exploit if ur gonna use a modified client
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 18:50:00 lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 18:53:47 moments like this make me wish we had a real move tool üòî
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 18:57:09 well a rotate tool would be difficult since everything is perfectly tiled
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 18:57:31 if u rotated something with an odd number of blocks, its pos would be in the decimals
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 18:58:03 even if u did that
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 18:58:32 rotating isnt just like rotating points on a grid
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:12:05 https://gyazo.com/0e1693ba750d04c402d6f4bf92cf109c
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:12:17 time to begin working on the fortress itself üòâ
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:12:44 oh yeah, the cockpit. The floor opens when the driver seat elevator is lowered üòâ
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:14:56 
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:14:58 it is very pog
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:15:17 oooooo
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:15:19 an engine
plane-crazy 2021-02-05 19:15:39 I was thinking of making a manual transmission as my next build
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 01:45:32 bruh ok Im getting tired of this
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 01:45:46 why does it sometimes decide not to actually save when I hit save
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 01:46:10 I adjusted a motor, joined the pvp server after saving it, and the motor is reset
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 01:46:25 its done this 5 times now, but before it was an hour of work each time
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 01:46:38 dont say saved successfully, IF IT DIDNT SAVE SUCCESSFULLY
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 01:50:10 <@!368581738496131072> I did, and yes it said saved successfully, but obv it didnt
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 01:50:30 I'ved saved 3 times before leaving, only to have it not save
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 01:50:39 the save system is obv bugged
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 01:50:50 and needs an error handler, so it knows when it fails
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 01:51:15 and doesnt give false ideas, like a secure feeling that ur ship will be there next time
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 01:51:30 oh its getting a rewrite?
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 01:51:48 wait
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 01:51:52 the whole game is hard coded?
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 01:51:58 OOF
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 01:52:15 Yeahhhh sounds like me when I don't plan on updating my code again
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 02:09:57 <@!368581738496131072> is he planning on adding logistics anytime?
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 02:10:07 bro imagine if we had logistics
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 02:10:20 the kind of builds we could make
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 02:10:26 and not depend on single keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 05:26:10 ah well, at least I still have macros lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 05:51:11 <@!530791063015784455> perhaps lower torque?
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 18:32:07 https://gyazo.com/1e55163a3b495f963b42730d10f15a27
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 18:32:22 just did alot of work, so gonna post this here for when it decides it didnt wanna save
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 18:33:45 good, this time it saved. Just gonna post a gif of me saving every time, cuz I'm sick of this save problem going un noticed
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 18:34:40 OH
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 18:34:45 I REALISED THE ISSUE
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 18:34:51 ITS NOT THE SAVE SYSTEM THATS THE PROBLEM
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 18:35:02 ITS WHEN UR BUILD IS AUTO LOADED ON JOIN
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 18:35:13 Its like it loads a previous save for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 18:35:17 idk how u even manage that
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 19:04:07 ok, how the fuck do u get missiles to lock onto ppl
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 19:04:18 cuz for me, they just decide screw the battle, they goin to a bar
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 19:05:22 mhm
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 19:21:43 eh, visits arent as important as favorites
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 19:22:07 I mean, if I wanted, I could create a script on my pc to join, quit, join, quit, any game
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 19:22:29 visits doesnt mean 100mil ppl have played it
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 19:22:51 lol thats boring, I actually enjoy writing scripts like that
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:11:43 https://gyazo.com/1aedc7711b416aa657150b6cea5d10c8
not as good as mine üòâ
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:13:16 lol this was my first build
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:13:28 the plane takes off by gaining speed, like a glider
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:14:00 its loud af in first person tho lol
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:14:06 so many rockets
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:18:28 dang, so this is what my flying fortress looks like when its in the air
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:19:02 how should I make it hover tho?
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:19:11 for now, it just goes up
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:19:21 but I'd like to make it stay in place
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:19:25 without the hover pads
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:20:29 ehhh I'd rather not take the cheap route
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:20:34 and I'm staying away from rocket engines
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:20:41 https://gyazo.com/3d3b547f04ce7154127065e80ce320ec
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:21:13 they already do
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:21:21 it steers and goes forwards and backwards
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:21:48 yep
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:22:04 yep
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:22:21 What? I don't have any tilt issue
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:22:39 I wanna make it hover in place
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:22:47 without hover pads or cheap methods
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:23:03 Part actually
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:23:16 until its given a name, thats the default instance.new("part"); name

plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:48:15 Anyone remember Lifetime Builders club? I wonder if they have any benefits still..
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:49:15 lol imagine paying for anything on roblox
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:49:31 Sorry, but us lower class can't afford the vbux
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:49:47 got food and bills to pay for
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:50:29 I'm hoping my current project will make me moneyz
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:51:30 I'm close to being able to release the actual product, so I'm just working on the site and token system for it
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:52:06 been programming for 6 years, I hope its finally time to put it to good use üòî
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:53:25 Well, I'm gonna make the product itself like a hub for anything I make. Scripts (not roblox lol), Software, etc
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:53:41 U can use it for free, but u'd have to buy anything u wanna use
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:53:57 or u can subscribe, and be able to use anything and everything, so long as ur subscription lasts
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:55:09 I've made things from a simple script that logs into my online school for me (for attendance) to 2D Game Engine APIs
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:55:23 I aint ever trying 3d again tho, at least not without a team
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:55:33 I tried it once, nooooo way
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 20:56:50 The first thing I wanna sell is my 2d game engine. Its made using C++, but for the game itself, u can use LUA since its easier
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 21:16:18 I forgot I left my game on, with my airship going up
plane-crazy 2021-02-06 21:16:28 Ig I'm in space

  end
end
```

general 2021-02-21 05:37:42 ```lua

  run = true;
  local i = 0;
  local returning = nil;
  while run do
    i = i + 1;
    if obj:GetChildren()[i].Name == target then
      returning = obj[obj:GetChildren()[i].Name];
    end
    if i == #obj:GetChildren() then
      i = i - i + 1;
    end
    if (returning == nil) == false then
      run = false;
    end    
  end
  return obj[target];

general 2021-03-02 09:09:15 And I'm too poor to buy good monitors so I just use em
general 2021-03-02 09:09:31 Me 2 years ago. The pc is shit and so are the monitors

general 2021-03-02 09:17:32 Its trash otherwise. It'd at least look more like what I do if it had a small plant on it
general 2021-03-02 09:18:43 That's actually recommended for college students FYI. Apparently it helps with studying
general 2021-03-03 20:15:38 why don't u try googling it then?

general 2021-03-03 20:15:53 Cuz I tried aswell
general 2021-03-03 20:16:27 Just a dev asking another dev a question jesus
general 2021-03-03 20:18:07 cuz he the only one online, and this is <#497142796961054721>. For general conversations
general 2021-03-03 20:18:40 <@!260797229068058634> Where did I break it?
general 2021-03-03 20:20:01 I need u to read it, cuz apparently I'm reading it wrong. It says don't ping them with _suggestions_, _reports_, or _creations_. I must be missing the "Don't talk to the devs, they don't like discord, thats why they are here"
general 2021-03-03 20:20:28 no
general 2021-03-03 20:20:32 I didn't, thats why I pinged
general 2021-03-03 20:20:39 Indeed, thats why I pinged
general 2021-03-03 20:20:45 So he can jump to the message
general 2021-03-03 20:20:55 I don't need him to
general 2021-03-03 20:20:58 I'm here
general 2021-03-03 20:21:27 no idea, I'm never active here. I just asked rick a dev question
general 2021-03-03 20:22:02 <@!273536574770380800> wow, ok, tell him to leave discord if he rlly doesn't want to be pinged for ANYTHING.
general 2021-03-03 20:22:03 bye
