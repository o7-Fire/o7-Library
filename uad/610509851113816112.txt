bug-reports 2020-08-03 17:44:01 So basicaly, my plane wont take of because the engines wont activate, like- they turn on when spawned but then they just wont work when I press W, ive tried rejoining but still I have that problem, and it is a super rocket engine, so I tried out the blimp I had that had jets and propellars, still didnt work

bug-reports 2021-07-15 10:54:54 Just discovered that when you have coloured the Delta wing control surface and save it, but then load it in again it doesnt save the colour, it just goes back to the regulae colour
Like if I put red it goes back to grey after loading it in again
