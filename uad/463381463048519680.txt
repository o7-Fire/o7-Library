plane-crazy 2018-12-02 02:26:55 I just built a HUGE jet and a HUGE boat and it took ALL day and i lost it ALL
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 02:27:32 it was as big as the square lets you build
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 02:27:50 ok well it took all day to make my jet
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 02:27:56 i dont care about my stupid boat
plane-crazy 2018-12-02 02:28:29 it took me 5 hours to build and fix stuff on it, and another 3 hours of perfecting it

creations-chat 2018-12-05 01:04:37 How many jets are allowed before it says "Jet spamming isnt allowed"
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:04:58 How many jets are allowed before it says "Jet spamming isnt allowed"
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:07:24 I have like 600 LOL
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:07:34 wanted to just go insanely fast
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:07:38 but unfortunately cant
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:08:31 i did a 29x29 square, i had like 36 and I went 600 so yea like 700 rockets might be too many
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:09:36 kinda sucks tho because the point of the ranks was getting the colors
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:21:50 How do people get to 1m speed? i get to 800 and it stops
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:22:37 geez

plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:30:50 i get to 2k
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:30:55 and i cant go further
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:31:28 o
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:31:36 i thought super rockets were better than huge rockets
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:31:53 I just made a big platform and filled the bottom with as many super rockets as i could
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:32:18 so helium and huge rockets?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:32:41 are there helium beams
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:33:06 o 1x4
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:33:07 i found it
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:33:09 ok
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:34:38 should i fill the floor with helium lol
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:35:41 yea thats what i mean
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:35:48 the entire base square with helium
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:36:50 o ok
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:37:17 pointing up? you mean down?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:37:23 if theyre up then ill go down
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:39:34 ye
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:41:07 why not super rockets though?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:42:07 Wouldnt they be stronger?
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:44:28 Yea I did 9 super rockets and 1 huge rocket
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:44:38 and 1 huge didnt lift me up, 9 super lifted me up
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:45:32 woah
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:45:33 thats dope
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:45:38 use super rockets
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:45:40 all the time
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:45:49 590 will be the max for it
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:45:58 my jets cant pass 548
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:46:11 no
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:46:20 that means less stability and lift, and also less control
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:46:26 590 is good dude
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:46:35 heres what u can do
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:46:54 put super rockets behind control surfaces and put panels in between each rocket, they wont fall and it will look cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:47:19 behind them
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:47:50 Here's a speed version of my jet, thats how i did it
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 01:47:55 it maxes at like 640
plane-crazy 2018-12-05 02:26:30 looks cool
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 18:48:16 can u say whats new in the announcements?

plane-crazy 2018-12-16 19:26:30 Why does it take forever for me to be able to open my saves after I leave my plane
creations-chat 2019-01-02 16:44:52 I just scrolled through the creations chat and saw 5 fish
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 02:49:03 i hope they know that no one is reading the rules still, they just click the verification
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 02:49:16 its like the terms and conditions
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 02:49:47 I think there should be a reaction button after every rule
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 02:49:56 MrEpic the cod gun is the same as my name but without the L
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 02:50:06 idk where i got my name from tho, i made it like 7 years ago
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 02:50:29 yea it was
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 02:50:33 same
plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:25:56 yes imperial

plane-crazy 2019-01-12 03:28:56 i only clicked one of the reactions idk why you would see that i put one
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 15:31:13 anyone else unable to fly with vtols? when i move something with motors the whole thing starts glitching and moving in weird directions, and the motors dont turn completely
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 15:34:50 
plane-crazy 2019-03-11 15:36:05 within another spoiler
bug-reports 2019-03-16 04:14:20 i got a bug report
the game
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:10:36 are they ever gonna fix the motors
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:10:57 he broke them in the first place
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:11:02 with the new updates
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:11:27 it was fine til he put out a new update
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:11:48 "noob"
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:12:10 and that 100% means hes telling the truth when someone says it
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:12:36 i know a dev that had the same problem when it broke his entire game, so he just remade it to fit the update
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:13:09 im not talking about the same bug
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:13:37 he could remake the entire motor mechanic
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:14:00 he wouldnt have to rewrite the whole game
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:14:33 if i had the entire game in roblox studio i would
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:14:58 you wouldnt know unless i had it in front of me and i tried
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:15:08 doesnt mean its impossible
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:15:42 or im just estimating myself
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:15:51 you guys know nothing about me, so you never know if i could
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:16:08 orangeskii it probably just took him months to make this entire game, a motor wouldnt take nearly as long
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:20:38 i bet if he made a new version of plane crazy that cost like 80R$ people would play it if he made everything to fit the new physics
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:20:50 then he wouldnt spend that time for nothing
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:21:05 also tons of people bought the tip gamepass over and over so he does actually make some money but not as much as normal devs
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:21:12 i know i said "if"
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:21:43 i know, but im pretty sure they split it
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:22:32 you guys act like the main dev wouldnt make anything from the game, like the owner would horde it all
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:23:28 well why would rick make money from vip servers
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:28:37 orange a motor broken is a pretty big bug, people use motors for tons of stuff
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:29:02 yea they still work they just lock up or they arent in sync
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:29:31 i had a hover plane that was amazing, now it just flops around like a fish
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:30:53 well yea cause new things cause new bugs
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:31:23 yea but id rather have 2 minor bugs on the same item than a big bug
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:31:31 should i have lock on or off
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:31:55 all my planes were reliant on motors working perfect thats why
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:33:13 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 04:36:59 alt+f4 works better
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 04:21:39 are the motors still broken?
