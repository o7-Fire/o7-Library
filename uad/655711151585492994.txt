help 2022-09-04 18:47:03 im sure that the motorlocking doesn't add extra weight but it still doesn't work
help 2022-09-04 18:52:19 well its centered so does it still matter? what i meant was that the junk sitting on the locking is balanced so thats not the issue

help 2022-09-07 18:20:05 so just replace on of the blocks that the motor 2 (that rotates) with a locked motor?

help 2022-09-07 18:21:31 oh well im just gonna watch it again
creations-chat 2022-09-10 12:40:35 <@933772530588717147>  you should have better angles on your chopper in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2022-09-10 12:42:40 like for example a better front view and maybe a bottom view. Its just so we can see how it really looks, since its hard to tell from top view, back view and cockpit view
creations-chat 2022-09-10 12:45:44 my point is that if you want people to see what it looks like, you should have a better front view and side view. its pretty hard to tell what you made looks like with those angles <@933772530588717147>
help 2022-09-10 12:47:01 more and better details. also maybe use material some places
help 2022-09-10 12:47:19 or just add lines so it looks more like a brick
help 2022-09-10 12:47:34 diffrent colors/materials and white stripes, like a brick
help 2022-09-10 12:47:52 (different colors should just be shadings)
help 2022-09-10 12:48:10 nope. i suck at helis
help 2022-09-10 12:48:25 there are helicopter basics yt videos tho
help 2022-09-10 12:49:11 also i recommend you use original colors
help 2022-09-10 12:49:40 that you made yourself
help 2022-09-10 12:49:49 bcs plane crazy's colors looks so bad
help 2022-09-10 12:49:52 oh

help 2022-09-17 20:28:02 no, it doesnt protect from bullets. Im not sure about rockets either. But if you use TNT blocks for floor, it doesnt get damaged
help 2022-09-17 20:28:19 bca tnt blocks cant get destroyed by bullets
help 2022-09-17 20:28:25 and again, im not sure about rockets

help 2022-09-17 21:19:54 i can try to explain
help 2022-09-17 21:20:51 all you need to do is write ''$new'' in bot central, and you should get added to a chat called ''ticket-*random numbers*
help 2022-09-17 21:21:01 there you must have proof for a vehicle/build on what rank u want
help 2022-09-17 21:21:12 for example ''shipwright II''

bot-central 2022-09-17 21:22:09 the fu-
help 2022-09-18 19:50:06 if its pointing nose downwards it may be that there's too much weight on front. I suggest you put 1 or 2 helium blocks near there to see if there is an improvement
creations-chat 2022-09-18 20:08:23 i have a new design now lol. also i used the wrong image i can see. If you look at the other images it will be at least a little bit better
help 2022-09-18 20:12:40 damn.. well better luck next time i guess
creations-chat 2022-09-18 20:12:55 wow thats creative lol
help 2022-09-18 20:29:47 Maybeâ€¦ good luck though
help 2022-09-18 20:30:22 Everyone starts somewhere
help 2022-09-18 20:30:50 It would make sense
help 2022-09-18 20:31:28 And since diffrent materials has different weighs, i would assume its heavier
help 2022-09-18 20:34:01 Well its not done is it? Literally nothing works first try, unless you have the same luck to the point where ypu can win the lottery
help 2022-09-19 04:52:36 i made a plane, but it automatically turns horizontally to the right. Any ideas why this happens?

Not like it doesnt ''fit'' gltiching, but everytime i load the save slot in the anglelocking almost changes location. First time i made it, it fit perfectly. But the first time i loaded it in, it changed position so it didnt fit at all

help 2022-09-20 16:14:52 that is the same everytim
help 2022-09-20 16:14:58 but the results are diffrent
help 2022-09-20 16:16:47 this used to fit perfectly, but then i load another build, then load back, it looks like that
help 2022-09-20 16:16:53 without any changes
help 2022-09-20 16:18:17

help 2022-10-11 17:12:36 <:ElonWhat:559529350261637139>
help 2022-10-13 01:13:45 well, it's lacking good livery for sure
help 2022-10-13 01:15:20 kinda important part of a plane, in my opinion. you could maybe make diffrent shadings of the same color, or just go full camo style
help 2022-10-13 01:17:12 yeah same. darker livery just looks alot better than light gray, for example
help 2022-10-13 01:19:35 but yeah, maybe a few different lookalike colors to your original grey, then it should be alot better.
