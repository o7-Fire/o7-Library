help 2022-01-08 00:54:11 he isnt showing any response...
help 2022-01-08 00:54:46 if he was still here, he should probably not make a tank that has has to much detail
help 2022-01-08 00:54:47 like

help 2022-01-08 00:55:08 i dont think he can rlly manage with such a round turret...
help 2022-01-08 00:55:12 entity
help 2022-01-08 00:55:18 have you heard of the bob semple tank?
help 2022-01-08 00:55:24 I heard its a great tank.
help 2022-01-08 00:55:27 you should make it
help 2022-01-08 00:55:31 the bob semple tank
help 2022-01-08 00:55:38 it was a great tank in ww2
help 2022-01-08 00:55:43 had great statistics
help 2022-01-08 00:55:49 look up the bob semple tank its great
help 2022-01-08 00:56:15 yo entity I think you can actually fit working tracks in that hull
help 2022-01-08 00:56:20 looks possible to me
help 2022-01-08 00:56:55 i mean you were a white name before, admit it.
help 2022-01-08 00:57:26 what do I need to prove?
help 2022-01-08 00:57:38 by default people who join are white names.
help 2022-01-08 00:57:49 and no not all white names are horrible at building
help 2022-01-08 00:57:55 it just proves that they are new to the server
help 2022-01-08 00:58:06 yeah
help 2022-01-08 00:58:11 ik that
help 2022-01-08 00:58:16 he just brought up the topic
help 2022-01-08 00:58:18 anyways
help 2022-01-08 00:58:26 <@!911457409631932448>  you should redo the hull
help 2022-01-08 00:58:44 what tank are you building?
help 2022-01-08 01:00:35 can you show a side view of it?
help 2022-01-08 01:07:16 i think...
help 2022-01-08 01:07:22 u should just make it way smaller tbh
help 2022-01-08 01:07:47 the hull is rlly big.
help 2022-01-08 01:07:53 one of those like huge tanks
help 2022-01-08 01:07:59 would be good if it was like life sized
help 2022-01-08 01:08:03 or a bit smaller
help 2022-01-08 02:52:47 alright

general 2022-01-08 14:09:14 better than before
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:12:50 h
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:14:02 both are called that
general 2022-01-08 14:14:37 nice
general 2022-01-08 14:15:39 so true
general 2022-01-08 14:16:26 wise words
general 2022-01-08 14:16:44 alot of people here agree with you
general 2022-01-08 14:17:14 yesterday some furries were roleplaying with cars with cat ears while i was playing plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:21:51 yeah it was the olympic, it went into military service
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:22:05 yep
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:22:24 then the germans said “cya” and they sunk it
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:22:51 it did
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:23:10 yeah it got hit at like
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:23:14 near the propellers
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:23:23 like there was another ship beside it
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:23:33 but the suction from the propellers were so high
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:23:43 it sucked the ship into the propellers
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:24:03 didnt flood the olympic much tho
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:25:15 hmm
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:25:41 those are tugboats helping the ship dock i think
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:25:50 yeah it was a military ship that got sucked in
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:26:07 the damage was so high because the military ship was designed to ram ships
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:26:18 so the olympic took extra damage
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:27:06 but yeah the tugboat in the back near the propellers was about where the olympic was hit
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:27:31 oh yeah that ship
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:28:04 yeah the HMS hawke
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:28:14 thats the ship that collided
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:29:33 the tip of the bow got crushed
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:29:52 tis a scratch
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:30:33 eh just smudge it off
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:30:49 im sure insurance covers that
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:31:04 spoiler alert
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:31:13 white star line had to pay more for the damages
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:31:35 i think
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:32:01 yes
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:32:17 and then cunard line and white star line merged
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:32:27 causing white star line to practically not exist
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:32:40 cunard and white star became the uhh
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:32:45 cunard star??
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:32:51 idk man then it became cunard
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:32:57 hhh
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:33:18 actually they merged far far after the collision
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:33:36 mmm lemme see…
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:34:38 no blue star line has nothing to do with white star line and cunard
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:34:54 its actually a modern company thats trying to make the “titanic 2”
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:36:02 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:36:10 thats the company that owns cunard
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:36:24 its like a animal that eats an animal
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:36:32 but then another animal eats that animal
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:37:08 that should be correct
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:37:27 i mean in the long run they would be bankrupt
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:37:35 due to how many mega ships they lost
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:37:37 ye
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:37:46 that sounds good to me
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:37:52 sounds legit
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:38:29 they even lost one of their like
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:38:34 architects on the titanic
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:38:45 apperantly he wanted to go down with his own creation
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:39:14 quite true
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:39:41 oh yeah
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:39:49 yeah earlier when it was like
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:39:53 setting sail
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:39:58 there was a fire on board
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:40:05 that weakened the hull
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:40:12 yep
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:40:20 no idea how the heck people spotted that
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:40:37 britannic i think
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:40:53 it was actually slightly longer than the titanic
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:41:33 whichhhh sunk, because the germans said “what is zis geneva convention? I see this as a way to use our large supplies of torpedos!”
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:41:43 yeah the britannic was basically the titanic
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:41:47 just slightly longer
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:41:53 and different ish interior
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:42:23 poop deck
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:42:35 i think originated on pirate ships
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:42:44 of how birds pooped on their decks
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:43:03 like “swab the poop deck”
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:43:22 i interesting
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:43:41 because its not practical to have a huge target
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:43:57 they are made small to be a small target
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:43:59 ish…
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:44:12 some larger to fit more ship guns
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:44:23 but destroyers are smaller
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:44:34 mmm
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:44:40 yep smaller ships have more speed
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:44:49 due to having less weight
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:47:20 sounds good
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:49:12 looks good to me
plane-crazy 2022-01-08 14:49:16 so far

creations-chat 2022-07-13 07:32:06 My name is Cleveland Brown
And I am proud to be
Right back in my hometown
With my new family 
There's old friends
And new friends
And even a bear
Through good times
And bad times
It's true love we share

And so I found a place
Where everyone will know
My happy mustached face
This is The Cleveland Show
