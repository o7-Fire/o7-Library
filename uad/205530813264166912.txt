plane-crazy 2018-10-05 19:01:26 by then they should have figured out that my design isnt really that good, and they made their own thing
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 19:02:02 reeeeee
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 19:04:08 you should
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 19:09:02 just broke 600 blocks
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 19:14:04 i just have 2 blocks that fall off for no reason, but i cant find them
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 19:14:14 and the plane shakes for no reason
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 19:16:40 are they just not welding sometimes out of nowhere?
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 19:20:27 so the two blocks are actually spawning out of thin air
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 19:22:17 https://gyazo.com/07bee548d1ebf924c0b2389b07bd626f
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 19:22:17 and also
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 19:22:25 i dont think he said this ironically
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 19:37:18 so the guy who tried copying me
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 19:37:20 uh
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 19:37:22 after i left
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 19:37:40 he ended up with an ok fuselage with stubby tiny wings and engines strapped everywhere
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 19:43:03 the guy who copied me also has the issue of shaky plane and random detaching blocks
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 23:30:28 see i describe it as a crusade against furries
plane-crazy 2018-10-05 23:30:33 this is the first time you yourself called it that

plane-crazy 2018-10-06 23:03:53 free gau 8 noise
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 02:20:18 is elon musk the new name for little einstein
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:11:06 has anyone had their controls lock up at all
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:11:31 like, the controls you set stop working and aerodynamics dies while you just kind of go in the direction you were going when it happened
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:11:43 it always happens after i shoot the rockets on my blackshark
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:11:52 wait
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:12:10 i think it happens when part of your ship hits the void, but other parts of it are fine
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:12:30 cause the rockets hit the fallenpartsdestroyheight
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:12:34 and then something just breaks
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:13:11 ok
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:13:12 yep
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:13:14 that causes it
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:13:27 as soon as all of my rockets were destroyed, the controls locked
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:13:29 i figure it out
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 22:55:12 are you able to screenshot?
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 19:57:07 isnt that danny's aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 19:58:28 ok so before i use a thrust vectoring rocket to try and get elon musk, i think i should start with simple sounding rockets
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 20:04:23 well he wanted to know who had the aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 20:04:24 probably
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 21:13:21 if we had light block in game
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 21:13:27 that would be very nice
plane-crazy 2018-10-08 22:58:51 wait is that an i-16 in the background towing a hammer and sickle banner
the-dump 2018-10-09 20:37:01 Why did you make a recreation of a meme that died before the normies like PewDiePie even found out about it
the-dump 2018-10-09 20:45:26 no
the-dump 2018-10-09 20:45:26 what

the-dump 2018-10-09 20:47:49 about the same day (give or take 1 day either forward or backwards) as it was banned from the subreddit it came from
the-dump 2018-10-09 20:48:00 which proves that pewdiepie has always been, and will always be a normie, sucking the wounds of dead memes
the-dump 2018-10-09 20:48:22 oh

plane-crazy 2018-10-10 01:05:13 probably because it wasnt even close to having design finished

creations-chat 2018-10-23 23:45:11 how did it do that instantly

creations-chat 2018-10-23 23:45:19 does it just repost anything with an image
creations-chat 2018-10-23 23:46:00 as long as spammers dont figure that out its safe
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:31:02 how can i make my 6 motor propeller thing even faster
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:31:09 it only gets me to like 46 speed
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:31:18 i can glide at that speed but certainly not fly
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:31:54 i got all the speed to 20
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:32:00 no engines on
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:32:08 still not go fast enough
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:33:22 cant think of any ways to make it go faster without using engine
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:34:04 i know they're going the right way
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:34:05 im not stupid
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:34:12 i did something and now i go 84
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:34:15 still not fast enough
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:36:16 what
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:36:23 i just have 7 motors on each other
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:36:28 and prop on end
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:37:04 yes
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:37:06 its going too fast
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:37:20 not sure how to make it faster without
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:37:21 that
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:37:41 wasnt it basically made for redit
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:37:48 *reddit
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:38:58 im replicating though
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:39:18 i dont think a f-82 should have an extra set of wings
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:39:45 id rather not cheat myself
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:39:51 it is a prop plane after all
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:40:14 ill use helium but why would i use jets on a prop plane
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:40:19 the whole point is that it doesnt use jets
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:40:39 but you see
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:40:43 this is not a jet plane
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:40:50 no jets
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:40:50 therefore
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:40:59 propellers
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:41:20 ill make the wings thiccer by 1 panel then ill add some helium
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:41:37 *i just said i was doing that*
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:42:16 does everyone have some deep resentment of propellers that i was never told about
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:42:51 they're great
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:43:26 helicopters tho
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:45:58 propeller blades are great multitools
help 2018-10-24 00:49:38 i hate that the forward and backwards on the engines and everything else was reverse
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 00:54:20 originally when i started doing helicopters i tried making the mi-8's rotor gimbal but it ended up being really wobbly using the massive control surface suspension piston thing
creations-chat 2018-10-24 20:06:26 replacing the engines with super rockets on my vtol means it flies at 380 speed when level
creations-chat 2018-10-24 20:06:43 and it can fly straight up at 250 speed
creations-chat 2018-10-24 20:06:47 which it couldnt do before
creations-chat 2018-10-24 20:09:06 but what if you added the new super rockets on it
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 20:20:11 there is no such thing as bad idea
plane-crazy 2018-10-24 20:20:13 the faster the better
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 02:03:50 why it so hard to find a server witht he update
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 02:04:08 i just want to put super rockets on the blades of my ka-50 which had really slow upwardsing
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 02:27:21 why are none of the servers on the latest update
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 02:27:26 earlier today some were
plane-crazy 2018-10-25 02:27:30 did they just vanish

bug-reports 2018-10-25 20:43:21 and disabling the drive
bug-reports 2018-10-25 20:43:47 it seems like somnehow part of it hits the void
bug-reports 2018-10-25 20:44:03 because when it happens the entire warp cylinder just kind of looks like it cracks in half
bug-reports 2018-10-25 20:44:11 and then it goes back to normal with some of the blocks a bit off

general 2018-10-29 21:08:07 are you platying along with it my dude or did you not get it
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:09:06 HEY HEY WAIT A SECOND
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:09:20 HOW CAN WE HAVE MACH IF WE ARENT SURE HOW LARGE 1 STUD IS
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:09:25 whats the scale here?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:10:04 wouldn't 1 stud  = 1 foot be reasonable
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:10:24 it would make the speed out sound to be 1125 sps
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:10:37 but where did we get 6860 from?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:10:45 is that 1 stud = 1 inch or something
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:16:14 that means we arent even 3 feet tall in the game
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:16:19 how many studs is a block?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:16:24 oh wait
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:16:28 hold on going ingame to measure
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:18:38 ok
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:18:41 math time
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:18:44 2 blocks = 5 studs
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:18:55 1 robloxian (r6) without a hat is 5 studs tall
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:19:01 so one block is 2.5 studs
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:19:26 so uh
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:19:32 1 stud = 1 foot still makes sense
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:20:06 how did they get 6860
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:20:13 it just seems like a random number was chosen
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:20:49 because if 1 foot ***really*** is 1 block, then the speed should be less than 1125, which was the number i got with my scale
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:23:48 it's just kind of unreasonable
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:23:57 i doubt anyone is gonna reach 6860 conventionally
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:24:11 no warp drives, glitches, etc
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:24:44 obviously those are allowed for the supersonic rank
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:25:20 but this kind of puts into question how accurate anything in this gmae is if the speed implies that everything is in a 1/6th scale or something along those lines
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:30:56 so nobody has a clue how on earth they got the number **6860**
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:31:16 im fine if the reason is they just picked a random big number
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:31:19 because then they have a reason
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:32:58 thats one of the reasons why i think the 1 foot = 1 stud should be standarized and then the speed goes to 1125
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:33:17 yes
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:33:25 a robloxian is 5 studs tall
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:33:29 1 foot = 1 stud makes them 5 feet
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:33:46 go so fast you cant even confirm if you have the rank or not
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:33:58 sure
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:34:09 nyoom
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:34:32 yes
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:34:42 how fast would you want it to be if you want it to be provable?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:34:57 is r/iamveryfast a subreddit yet
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:35:36 any of you guys play arma 3?
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:36:34 why is the speed of sound faster than a warp drive
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:37:12 if you get supersonic then you automatically get wrp drive
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:37:22 because 6860 > 2000
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:38:47 difficult if not impossible rip
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:45:39 ok so thats 1 more point to the change the rank category
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:46:58 in <#497865146266419200> i proposed we do a poll if it should be changed so that peopl don't have to near crash the server to get the rank
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:50:19 are you good at leading the planes
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:50:30 since the stuff is local you could do target practice
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:50:46 how many shot down
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:54:14 pew pew
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:56:13 why are half wedges not actually half a block
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 21:58:59 half blocks arent even half, nice
plane-crazy 2018-10-29 22:03:13 oh nice

plane-crazy 2018-10-30 01:45:46 try mounting the seat on a gyroscope
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 01:45:48 dont forget to spin
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 01:46:08 yes put the seat on a gimbal with every degree of T U R N
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 01:47:53 i think the wings are a bit thin but as far as f-22s go its pretty good
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 01:48:06 get some rings
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 01:48:09 spin one
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 01:53:19 before i had wings on my a-164 it broke 800 but now with the ability to actually fly it only goes 450 rip
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 01:53:44 oh yes
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 01:53:56 oh yes
plane-crazy 2018-10-30 01:53:58 eyees

plane-crazy 2018-10-30 21:36:43 what happened?
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 00:43:09 why is the rate of people going from 2 ranks to inventor increasing
plane-crazy 2018-10-31 00:43:17 aren't we supposed to be running out of ideas
general 2018-11-01 11:51:12 Who was the dude who got inventor by building a knife that didn't look like a knife, seemed to not fly that well, and was under 500 blocks?
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:36:19 excuse me W h at
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:36:45 you use uhjk instead of wasdqe?
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:36:56 eq roll, ad rudder ws pitch is superior
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:37:01 s will always be pitch up
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:37:21 every game i can rebind the controls in, i will
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:37:48 if i ever use the keyboard in war thunder i even use the same ksp control scheme
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:40:36 i mostly use mouse but i will stand by wasdqe for life
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:40:52 also if you want to just maintain roll sideways without banking you will have to use rudder
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:41:21 if i had to put ujhk to something, it would be RCS on something that hovers
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:41:39 wait
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:41:46 ksp doesn't even use ujhk for that, it uses ikjl
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:46:25 dude
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:46:30 unpower the motor block
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:46:47 yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:46:52 if its off then it will work like a bearing
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:46:53 instead of a motor
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:47:09 if its powered then it will only move when you press the keys to move it
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:47:11 yes the blades would spin
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:48:04 what
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:48:39 if what makes my helicopters work doesn't make yours work i can't help you
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:48:44 wait
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:48:53 you dont have any jets to move the rotor when its unpowered.
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:48:57 what are you even doing
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:49:23 you would need a lot of stacked rotors if you wanted to have a no jet helicopter
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:49:42 and then at that point the torque from the rotors would be so much that you would need to have it counter rotate anyway
plane-crazy 2018-11-03 15:49:57 and by that point you have a center motor beam thats super tall
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 22:51:24 hm
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 22:51:29 does it still censor frick
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 22:51:41 IT LETS YOU SAY FRICK NOW
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 22:52:09 well it used to be you could say fuck but not frick
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 22:52:56 grаpe
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 22:53:04 just use a cyrillic а
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 22:53:47 ?pingle
plane-crazy 2018-11-06 22:53:49 ?ping
creations-chat 2018-11-07 21:05:51 or just make it easy on yourself and use two rotors counter-rotating
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:50:12 hold on
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:50:42 <@!294956031153405952> didnt you get inventor for a knife or something?
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:51:28 a can?
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:51:30 col
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:51:30 oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:51:32 cool
plane-crazy 2018-11-07 21:51:50 well yes thats what he said
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:50:56 what do you mean counter rotating only works in theory
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:51:03 there's a bunch of helicopters with counter-rotating blades
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:52:10 why did you put different numbers anyway
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:52:20 then one level is giving more lift and so will create a bit of torque
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:52:32 yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:52:44 thats why a lot of make counter-rotating helicopters
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:52:54 so we dont have to bother with tail rotors
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:53:12 doesn't matter really
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:53:42 or you could just make them unpowered and put jets on the ends of the blades if you feel like it
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:54:57 so unlike most people, you make really light helicopters and just rely on two fairly slow rotors?
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:55:26 what
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:55:58 im gonna remove my jets on my blades and try it with just the motors and see how well it flies
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:56:39 its just the angle propeller blades are at
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:57:05 it looks like he zoomed out then panned and took a small section of the screen for some reason
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:57:32 wait
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:57:36 what happened to the way blocks weld
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:57:52 something a bikt broken now
plane-crazy 2018-11-08 23:57:59 my two blades now just weld together
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:58:30 new update broke my heli, blades never welded together before, but now for some reason they do
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:58:37 in fact
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:58:42 all motors seem to be buggered for me
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:58:47 even when unpowered
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:59:01 wait
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:59:03 no
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:59:04 they work
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:59:07 its just that not with engines
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:59:12 yes they are not locked
creations-chat 2018-11-09 03:08:31 wheres the bomber
creations-chat 2018-11-09 03:08:33 i cant see it
creations-chat 2018-11-09 03:08:37 did you paint it black
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:03:23 so its any means possible right? so if i jumped out of my craft to just have the speed marker and somehow reached light speed that would still count?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:14:37 i've managed to fling myself at a speed of 30k
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:14:40 not fast enough.
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:33:42 so for the speed ranks, even if its just a picture of my speed and the skybox because i flung myself so hard im invisible, it still has to go to creations chat right?
creations-chat 2018-11-09 21:34:56 hey
creations-chat 2018-11-09 21:34:57 so
creations-chat 2018-11-09 21:35:23 if i have a picture of my speed because i flung myself past escape velocity using a creation that's not even in frame, i still have to put it here right?
creations-chat 2018-11-09 21:35:26 ok yeah
creations-chat 2018-11-09 21:36:03 wait
creations-chat 2018-11-09 21:36:31 ok nvm gotta make a vehicle that go fast
creations-chat 2018-11-09 21:36:34 instead of me just going fast
bug-reports 2018-11-09 21:37:37 the bug that breaks warp drives is even worse now
bug-reports 2018-11-09 21:38:52 wait nvm
bug-reports 2018-11-09 21:38:57 i just didnt design my drive very well
creations-chat 2018-11-09 21:43:00 alright so i guess the ship to also go the speed isnt actually required?
creations-chat 2018-11-09 21:43:21 orbital velocity i guess? rank says you need the ship to go that speed but people are getting it from just flinging idk
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 21:46:00 is using the parachute count for the rank or not because it looks like it does but the ranks thing says it doesn't
creations-chat 2018-11-10 16:50:47 what
general 2018-11-10 16:56:21 would the changing density thing be like, holding the keys and it slowly sets down and up, or would you set two densities that it can go to
general 2018-11-10 17:00:45 and then add some magnets to give it some pretty strong gravity
general 2018-11-10 17:00:56 wait
general 2018-11-10 17:01:04 if you had magnets pulling on all sides
general 2018-11-10 17:01:11 could you potentially orbit something
general 2018-11-10 17:02:31 just enable the pull loose parts thing for magnet
general 2018-11-10 17:02:47 the reason warp drives will pull in things outside of the drive is because of that
creations-chat 2018-11-10 17:03:31 looks nice
general 2018-11-10 17:08:49 yes
general 2018-11-10 17:09:07 but only on wings for some reason
general 2018-11-10 17:11:05 what
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:26:27 ok so
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:26:31 i know im not in the arena
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:26:35 but for some reason
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:26:40 arena rockets can still blow up and kill people
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:26:44 someone shot me with them and i died
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:27:34 not sure
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:27:47 what
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:27:55 i dont know what you mean test or normal
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:28:14 normal one
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:28:38 i didnt know there was a test one
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:29:29 at the moment there's a bit of a rocket war between rocket armed helis, and i think im winning
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:30:18 what
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:30:31 whats it supposed to be a picture of
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:30:38 upsidedown pogo stick?
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:30:51 just noticed it had a rocket engine
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:32:41 right now the entire server is abusing the rockets not being fixed, and it is loads of fun
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:33:32 its 833 but sure moring
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:37:33 no seriously, if you can join my server, rockets arent patched and we're having a FFA its really fun
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:39:50 wait what
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:40:08 i thought in wot the tanks literally just drove like cars but with a tank model
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:40:38 i also thought wot was like the one war thunder april fools update where it was inflatable shermans shooting carrots
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:40:58 it really seems like it
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:41:22 but if you want realism just play IL-2
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:41:40 il-2 is literally a smulator so just play that for most realism
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:42:44 its easy to deny that though by just playing both games
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:43:06 you only have to spend a few minutes in each to see what they're really meant for
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:44:32 roblox opened in 2004
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:44:41 however in 2004 and 2005 it was named dynablocks
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:45:42 how about we move the argument to something more important, like for instance, why controls for keyboard should ALWAYS be Q E for roll, AD for rudder, and S MUST ALWAYS BE PITCH UP
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:45:54 yes
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:45:59 ew
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:46:01 ew
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:46:16 what kind of madman uses a d for roll
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:46:33 in all my time of playing KSP, i used q e for roll, thats why i use q e for roll everywhere else
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:46:35 because its correct
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:47:02 its not like ksp lets you change the controls
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:47:07 the aircraft games do though
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:47:13 so i change the aircraft games to what makes sense for me
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:47:31 im not gonna buy a joystick what
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:47:38 hold on
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:47:51 >"wot looks better"
>shows picture of PLANE instead of tank
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:48:13 just show us the tanks then
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:48:17 the tanks look nice i want to see the tanks
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:48:29 very nice but what about tank
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:48:39 god
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:48:40 good
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:48:56 FINALLY
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:48:57 TAMLK
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:49:05 now that is a good looking tank
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:49:14 oh yeah show uys a t34 in wot
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:49:47 if a game is fun thats good, but wouldnt it looking nice also be part of the realism
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:50:25 the t34 in wot does look a bit more like a proper t34 at sunset, at least until you look at the tracks which just look off
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:50:45 *g ame p lay*
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:52:02 atgm's need to be nerfed somehow
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:53:37 what do these words mean
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:53:55 i was talking about the stupid names that companies give their stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:53:57 like radeon
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:54:09 all of the computer bits have dumb names for some reason
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:54:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:54:31 but they're all not very good names
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:55:19 i thought you were gonna pull a "well you dont know how these new-fangled computers work" for some reason instead of providing a reason
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:56:52 the helicopter flight model in wt isnt actually very good
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:57:30 its just not very realistic compared to a proper helicopter
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:58:05 what
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:58:15 simulators can be fun what are you talking about
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:58:26 just a few minutes ago you were talking about how realistic WT was
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:58:38 and now you're saying "oh it doesn't have to be realistic then it wouldn't be fun"
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:58:45 i love WT but at least i can criticize it
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:59:13 gaijin brags about having a realistic flight model
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:59:14 but uh
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 02:59:17 its not always the best
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:00:12 if gaijin wants to talk about realism, they should at least do it
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:00:23 so dont pull that "oh go back to DCS you realism scum" stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:00:44 war thunder is supposed to be more realistic than wargaming's stuff
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:01:32 so now both sides have said "realism doesn't mean fun"
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:02:56 im gonna guess that nobody here plays arma
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:03:07 gmod.. simulator
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:03:08 what
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:03:21 gmod's jsut a really good sandbox
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:03:29 arma is great fun
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:06:06 silly french
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:06:39 they dont need any kind of glass because the maginot will protect them before they even get to combat
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:07:21 and not only around the maginot, but also through the ardennes
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:07:30 the forests and hills that the allies thought was impassable for an army
general 2018-11-11 03:09:33 are you a wehraboo
general 2018-11-11 03:10:03 this is probably a good time to say that the germans didnt always have a tech advantages
general 2018-11-11 03:10:08 and the maus would be useless
general 2018-11-11 03:10:22 and any other german superheavy tank would've just been asking to be bombed
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:13:26 f a s t m o v e r,  2 0 0 m   f r o n t
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 03:13:55 oh wow
general 2018-11-12 03:36:12 someone shot my plane and now whenever i fly it the nose just breaks despite being completely welded
general 2018-11-12 03:37:56 that didnt fix it
general 2018-11-12 03:38:00 had to rebuild the nose
creations-chat 2018-11-12 22:51:54 what in the name of myself pinged me
