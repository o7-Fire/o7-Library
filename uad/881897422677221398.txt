plane-crazy 2022-12-04 08:49:02 I asked for an explanation

plane-crazy 2022-12-04 08:49:55 I was in a pvp server
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 08:50:02 They still dont work
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 09:57:27 ive made
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 09:57:30 another shark
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 09:57:37 where the cutters dont work either
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 09:57:49 shall i take a screenshot and show you
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 09:58:51 
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 09:59:03 anything ive placed wrong?
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:00:29 wdym
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:01:29 the shark looks wrong?
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:01:49 thats not really helpfull
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:01:55 i am asking how to fix the vutters
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:02:14 cutter.
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:04:40 do i re do the head
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:23:05 i still wonder how i fix my shark
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:23:10 its fast and everything but
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:23:14 the cutters dont work
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:25:55 yes.
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:26:19 it works completely fine except the teeth
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:27:00 how do i move them half a block
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:27:06 maybe i should re do the teeth?
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:35:49 this one works fine
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:35:51 the teeth
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:35:53 its just slower
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:35:55 way slower
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:36:01 but thats beside the point
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:36:12 maybe i should make the head something like this
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:44:45 the whale looking shark
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:44:49 has working teeth
plane-crazy 2022-12-04 10:44:53 maybe because its rounder?

plane-crazy 2023-03-18 11:37:15 i want you to rate is so far
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 11:37:23 not compare it to a finished build
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 11:38:07 alright if i finish it what would you probably rate it
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 11:38:23 ok
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 11:38:32 i mean 4/10 is reasonable since it isnt finished

plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:10:28 its an interesting ship
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 13:24:19 aight
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 14:30:32 
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 14:30:45 
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 14:30:51 <@757887014388367401>

plane-crazy 2023-03-18 15:10:12 your roblox character
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 08:03:48 finished the stern, the super strcture is done, i put circles where im gonna have the pvp weapons and i detailed the deck
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 08:03:57 the deck isnt done though
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 08:04:06 i only detailed a little of the bow
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 08:04:24 so now i gotta make it move, give it main batteries, ammunition, and just more details
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 08:04:32 and also gonna make a seperate version with interior so
