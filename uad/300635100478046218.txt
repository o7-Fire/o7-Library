general 2021-12-31 13:24:25 hi whats up
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 13:28:36 scuse me
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 13:28:47 is there a way to make individual blocks heavier
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 13:29:29 im trying to make an X-15 esque plane and since the wings are in the back mostly, the weight/wing control doesnt go hand in hand
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 13:30:09 since the engine is supposed to be super heavy in the back (and plane crazy doesnt account for that) i was thinking if there was a way to get heavy blocks
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 13:30:33 i know about helium but the issue is if you do that, the front is just gonna fly up
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 13:30:48 i tried it with an another plane with helium, it just started floating
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 13:31:05 wdym by that
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 13:31:43 ballast blocks amplify weight?
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 13:31:53 OOOH
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 13:31:59 well i didnt know, thank you!
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 13:32:12 thats very comfortable wow
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 13:32:24 pressing three is the screwdriver, right?
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 13:33:14 ik, just forgot thay screweriver is third
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 13:33:21 thank you for your help, really appreciated!
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 13:33:30 the more i learn the more potential i got :)
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 13:34:07 goodnight
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 13:36:42 scuse me, people get upvotes? how?
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 15:51:06 when i place down ballast blocks and update the density
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 15:51:17 the yellow mass line center doesnt move
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 15:51:28 is there a way to manually update the position of the center of mass?
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 15:52:21 makes sense
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 15:52:48 it barely moved despite the density being 10
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 15:56:28 ok seriously going back to my situation
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 15:56:37 placing ballast blocks on my plane doesnt move the mass at all
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 15:56:53 why is that though
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 15:57:23 aw come on is it really because the ballast density change doesnt change the mass center
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 15:57:54 oooh i see
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 15:59:23 will there be a fix to this?
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 15:59:39 is that in the works?
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:00:10 right but
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:00:18 how do i pinpoint the density i need to move my mass properly?
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:00:50 because placing blocks down barely moves the thing and its beyond 66 from what i know
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:01:14 are you guys aussies?
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:01:35 where are you from because its still 1800 here
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:37:07 working on a plane
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:37:25 everytime it goes up i cant control it to lower itself and stabilise and it keeps flipping over and going down
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:37:42 since im using ballast blocks and guessing, does that mean that my weight is far behind the float?
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:39:13 no the controllable gray wings are normal
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:39:14 flat
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:40:27 how do i post images
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:41:08 cant post pic of what it looks like unfortunately
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:42:00 riiight
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:42:12 i read it no need to ping me 4 times
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:42:13 not 2
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:42:14 not 3
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:42:16 but 4
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:42:24 anyway
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:42:35 can i dm you the picture please?
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:42:53 4 times/??
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:42:56 thats overkill
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:43:07 im not stupid ftw
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:43:12 just a link to the message is enough
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:43:34 ok cool
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:43:46 center of the universe lookin
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:43:48 whatever
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:43:50 anyway
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:44:31 smiley
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:44:32 sir
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:44:35 can you help me out
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:44:44 i am bad at this so i need some assistance
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:45:04 i noticed
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:45:18 i just came here to get some help related to a build im making why the hell is this happening to me
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:45:30 yes i didnt read the info board, yes i just found out about it
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:45:38 but why the hell do i need to have it rubbed right into me?

plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:45:53 is that a channel thats related tog etting help with building?
plane-crazy 2021-12-31 16:46:04 my name has my birthyear
help 2021-12-31 16:46:46 hello, having issues with plane, i have ballast blocks nad im trying to guess what i need to balance out the mass and float
help 2021-12-31 16:46:47 
help 2021-12-31 16:47:06 this is what it looks like, except when i go up, instead of stabilizing it starts flipping in the air and falling down
help 2021-12-31 17:16:48 so uh... whats the issue with the plane?
help 2021-12-31 17:17:12 ballasts btw
help 2021-12-31 17:17:33 internal wings?
help 2021-12-31 17:17:44 you mean the back wings?
help 2021-12-31 17:18:00 oh.
help 2021-12-31 17:18:05 well uh the issue here is
help 2021-12-31 17:18:20 im trying to make an X-15
help 2021-12-31 17:18:22 
help 2021-12-31 17:18:29 so i dont wanna ruin the wings in any way
help 2021-12-31 17:18:58 right
help 2021-12-31 17:19:18 ow thats some impressive working
help 2021-12-31 17:19:19 modelling

help 2021-12-31 17:19:26 wish i was that smart lol
help 2021-12-31 17:19:42 do i make entirely new wings inside the body?
help 2021-12-31 17:20:06 yeah thats what im asking
help 2021-12-31 17:20:29 i know but i have no idea whether or not i went overboard or not enough with ballast
help 2021-12-31 17:20:50 and replace with normal blocks?
help 2021-12-31 17:21:10 also one more question
help 2021-12-31 17:21:18 is the super rocket engine the strongest engine
help 2021-12-31 17:21:51 glitch?
help 2021-12-31 17:36:28 are they the conveyor glitch ones?
help 2021-12-31 17:39:32 <@!707953054489509978> sorry for the ping, what else can i do to get the weight and control closer?
help 2021-12-31 17:40:33 what did i even say that was bad
help 2021-12-31 17:40:35 wtf
help 2021-12-31 17:40:40 i just said

help 2021-12-31 17:41:05 but yeah i don't have much space to work with
help 2021-12-31 17:41:37 this is what we're looking at rn
help 2021-12-31 17:41:43 with internal wings
help 2021-12-31 17:41:56 motorlocks? where?
help 2021-12-31 17:42:13 look, im sorry, but im very very new.
help 2021-12-31 17:42:39 its alright, thank you for understanding
help 2021-12-31 17:42:44 but uh, where exactly are motorlocks?
help 2021-12-31 17:43:17 so just use normal Motor, not Motor 2?
help 2021-12-31 17:45:46 im watching a tutorial video
help 2021-12-31 17:45:47 wtf
help 2021-12-31 17:45:58 but uh how can i fit those motorlocks in the back?
help 2021-12-31 17:47:17 you mean in the middle?
help 2021-12-31 17:47:40 i get it.
help 2021-12-31 17:50:33 thats a very good idea

help 2021-12-31 17:50:44 ill see what i can do
help 2021-12-31 17:51:01 like i never used glitches before
help 2021-12-31 17:51:32 is it actually?
help 2021-12-31 17:51:38 damn
help 2021-12-31 17:51:46 so i gotta lift the top up, right?
help 2021-12-31 17:52:46 do motorlocks lower them by like
help 2021-12-31 17:52:50 1 block or half block
help 2021-12-31 17:53:08 double lock twice?
help 2021-12-31 17:53:43 okay
help 2021-12-31 18:05:32 <@!378612526151237642> sorry for the ping
help 2021-12-31 18:05:40 is 3 motorlocks in a row
help 2021-12-31 18:05:42 2 blocks?
help 2021-12-31 18:05:43 or 1.5?
help 2021-12-31 18:06:18 so i need 4?
help 2021-12-31 18:08:00 ye in a stair-like form right?
help 2021-12-31 18:57:57 <@!378612526151237642> sorry for the second ping, i can fly properly! but when it comes to trying to decrease altitude, its really slow, any way to fix that?
help 2021-12-31 19:09:17 yes
help 2021-12-31 19:09:21 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/663088355415818258/926552541511180378/RobloxScreenShot20211231_210628219.png

help 2021-12-31 19:18:14 i did some more tweaking, the issues were with a slightly older ver of the plane
help 2021-12-31 19:18:20 rn its not as desired, but its perfect
help 2021-12-31 19:18:32 thank you for your help! i think i can officially post this in creations
