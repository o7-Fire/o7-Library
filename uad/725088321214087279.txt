general 2020-06-24 04:32:09 No
general 2020-06-24 04:32:24 Exactly
general 2020-06-24 04:32:40 As long as they dont build cutter missiles
general 2020-06-24 04:32:55 Of tutorial planes with gun spam
general 2020-06-24 04:32:59 Or*
general 2020-06-24 04:33:39 They’re just beginners, there’s not much else to say
general 2020-06-24 04:33:53 I have no hate against them
general 2020-06-24 04:34:00 If that’s what you’re asking
general 2020-06-24 04:36:11 People who make tutorials are fine, it’s just that the people who build them take it to the extreme and outright copy it instead of getting inspired by it, that’s what bugs me is that i constantly see tutorial A-10 and P-40s and they say it’s theirs.
general 2020-06-24 04:37:04 Hot
general 2020-06-24 04:37:27 Yeah lol, they ask me if it’s a tutorial and i get really sad
general 2020-06-24 04:37:49 Or they completely fail at guessing my build
general 2020-06-24 04:38:02 And say that my B-24 is a B-17
general 2020-06-24 04:38:09 Or even, a Lancaster
general 2020-06-24 04:38:34 It sucks because it makes me feel bad :(
general 2020-06-24 04:39:16 Expired my sm0l brain cant comprehend complexity
general 2020-06-24 04:39:29 Or why the hell my planes spaz out
general 2020-06-24 04:39:38 And crash
general 2020-06-24 04:40:39 Should i build a ship again?
general 2020-06-24 04:41:01 It’s been a while since I’ve made a WW2 one
general 2020-06-24 12:39:30 Well, they are mods
general 2020-06-24 12:40:01 and this server is almost entirely composed of children since it is about a Roblox game.
general 2020-06-24 12:40:34 over 13
general 2020-06-24 12:40:45 But nonetheless still children
general 2020-06-24 12:40:56 Same
general 2020-06-24 12:43:04 oop
general 2020-06-24 12:44:32 Hey, if you're into that stuff maybe go into a nsfw server, there's plenty <:Picklerickje139:688580461668466730>
general 2020-06-24 12:45:35 And don't treat staff so badly, they're people too.
general 2020-06-24 12:46:57 To sum up, someone complained about the NSFW rule, and how he got punished for posting *nsfw*.
general 2020-06-24 12:47:22 Np. :D
general 2020-06-24 12:47:42 Says the one who complained about a simple rule
general 2020-06-24 12:47:47 piss off
general 2020-06-24 12:48:05 these damn kids
general 2020-06-24 12:48:48 That'll just give a bad image
general 2020-06-24 12:48:56 Just let him rot
general 2020-06-24 12:49:43 Makes sense how he got banned in the first place
general 2020-06-24 12:50:52 nono, let's not jump into assumptions and try and justify a reason to get him perma banned, i know we all want him **Gone** but let the man go.
He's probably never coming back, what a poosi.
general 2020-06-24 12:51:50 Oh the modlogs <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>

general 2020-06-24 13:02:41 Hey creativ, is there any way to transfer owner to someone if the actual owner got banned off of discord?
general 2020-06-24 13:03:27 Well they have been ignoring me so that's a nope

general 2020-07-09 21:37:03 The idea of a map extension has been around for years, i even attempted to create something from scratch.
the idea was brought up a few months ago as well but the topic hasn't been talked about in a while
general 2020-07-09 21:38:19 My map extension had some off road terrain, more ocean and even a really tall mountain. 
things that would've been fun for the map

general 2020-07-09 21:39:12 And an easter egg :)

plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:17:18 It’s like a weird chain of motors

plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:18:53 Who though, i mean who wouldn’t hate people like that
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:20:28 It sorta depends
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:21:28 It may be easy to you, but the difficulty or the understanding of the mechanism could vary from person to person

plane-crazy 2020-07-31 13:17:40 lower the poor cannon
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 13:18:16 and remove the front one because it would tip
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 13:19:14 You could lower the cannon's motor so it doesn't look like it's being held up by 1 miserable motor, also this would help in pvp so a gun doesnt take it out that easily
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 13:19:48 > there are a lot of newbies that dont like critism that why there are always fight lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 13:19:50 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 13:20:08 It's mainly constructive criticism
plane-crazy 2020-07-31 13:21:09 I got a downvote immediately on a build and it made no sense <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>
general 2020-07-31 13:23:00 Intended feature by ric
general 2020-07-31 13:23:20 Or add it as a feature

Not that there’s anything wrong with being gay
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:27:36 The motor lock was implemented to well, lock the motor in place so it wouldn’t move or glitch out when it wasn’t intended to, the whole glitch wasn’t intentional or at least i don’t think so, as far as i remember people found it useful and it was never actually fixed.
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:28:46 I don’t get people who find a way to dislike motor lock other than people who find it annoying when they’re actually trying to keep the motor locked and not more half a block
creations-chat 2020-08-03 04:29:26 I can finally make a 1:1 scale tank now, a good looking one at that.

general 2020-08-13 13:50:15 <:wot:695654208837255219>
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 13:54:15 That bug with the blocks going into each other dates back to 2018, I'm pretty sure rick knows of this but it's not a huge priority to fix it.
This also has happened to me with 1x4 Wedges and Beams
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 13:54:42 Just flip it a few times or place it from another angle

plane-crazy 2020-08-13 14:06:30 There's a camera that's touching the motor, use the cameras like you use blocks.
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 14:06:45 They have a completely square hitbox
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 14:07:03 The camera to the right of the motor is touching it
plane-crazy 2020-08-13 14:07:22 Basically cancelling all movement

creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:15:25 What
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:17:06 The only problem with the decals is that, a lot of people want it but as someone said there's no moderation *In-game*, there's only Rick and Mad that have the power to Ban from plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:17:32 Yeah but i haven't seen him in years.
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:17:54 He was in the discord server a while back.
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:18:02 Then suddenly left and never came back
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:18:06 <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:20:19 The thing is there's not much you can do until some moderation is implemented,  which if i'm not mistaken is being worked on.
You actually should keep evidence somewhere stored of people breaking the rules so when the Moderation becomes a reality, they can be punished.
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:21:20 I heard somewhere recently it was slowly becoming a reality.
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:22:24 Well damn, it's taken so long.
Ever since i was an Admin i had asked for in-game moderation, and literally **everyone** agreed it was a good idea with some minor restrictions that is.
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:22:51 I thought Mad was the one against it, not rick.
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:24:41 I actually agree with the idea of Image panels
creations-chat 2020-08-13 14:25:08 But it might be too much of a headache to counter the trolls

general 2020-08-21 01:50:43 Damn i knew him since the beginning
general 2020-08-21 01:50:46 sad to see him go
general 2020-08-21 01:51:04 he was one of the few people i genuinely enjoyed talking to
general 2020-08-21 01:51:50 He was the most mature 13 year old i had ever met
general 2020-08-21 01:52:12 Old old, around when i was mod.
general 2020-08-21 01:52:59 Most of the old ones have either resigned or removed due to inactivity
general 2020-08-21 01:53:24 My case was due to inactivity but I enjoy joking around that i was removed due to the furry rank i created.
general 2020-08-21 01:54:58 I joined I think 3rd or 4th, when Idra introduced me to the server In-game, was when the game averaged 0-2 people online every day.
general 2020-08-21 01:55:14 I think around Mid 2018 it was?
general 2020-08-21 01:55:46 I still remember you expired
general 2020-08-21 01:55:59 It was so peaceful
general 2020-08-21 01:56:38 I guess that's why most people resigned or left
general 2020-08-21 01:59:03 I don't even know what i did

general 2020-08-24 16:49:42 Rick is the only developer

general 2020-08-24 16:50:49 Well why don't you volunteer to be a developer since you're so good
general 2020-08-24 16:51:38 the community is hard to handle since there's 11k people
general 2020-08-24 16:51:43 and that's not rick's job
general 2020-08-24 16:52:04 The Admins, Voxel and the mod team should handle that
general 2020-08-24 16:52:19 Yes because you're god apparently
general 2020-08-24 16:55:19 I don't think you understand, let me put it in a language that you can understand. Rick is not always stuck to a computer screen, he can take his time since most people here **respect** him and he's the only Developer. He's got a ton of work to do and yet you still have the balls to come here and say that you would handle 11k people by **yourself** when already everyone dislikes you here for complaining
general 2020-08-24 16:57:36 He's popping out updates, 2 years ago the game was DEAD
general 2020-08-24 16:57:42 At least we've got progress
general 2020-08-24 16:58:24 Oh yes, if i knew how to cure cancer i would too. 
Your statement is irrelevant because words can't fix messy code
general 2020-08-24 16:59:20 You complain about the community but you're the one being pissy here
general 2020-08-24 17:01:11 I feel like the community has flaws but it's not chaos.
If the server was filled with people like you it would totally change drastically from being somewhat appealing to shit.
general 2020-08-24 17:01:30 yes because, YOU caused this
general 2020-08-24 17:01:57 Who are you to assume that rick doesn't look at the code?
general 2020-08-24 17:02:03 He's the MAIN DEVELOPER
general 2020-08-24 17:02:08 He's the code man
general 2020-08-24 17:02:56 You're free to speak, this is a public place after all
general 2020-08-24 17:03:20 The code is working, the game is running.
do you want more updates?

general 2020-09-10 11:45:16 why
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 11:55:39 Well, these kinds of people are everywhere, always using **its his opinion** or whatever, you just ignore them instead of feeding the flame as in the second pic you sent.
The hypocritical thing about *PancakeEpic Minecraft101*'s comment is that he was the one who got completely blown away by "nerd" thus he was the kanky bitch all along.
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 11:58:20 Ah, jeez my favorite

plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:03:44 <#478584971670454284>
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:03:47 Not many people help but
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:03:50 you can try
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:06:58 or maybe halfway just rickroll them and let's see how many incomplete builds are lying around in public servers
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:07:24 That's, uncool
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:07:49 why not the rickje cover of never gonna give you up
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:09:31 What's the video name
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:12:29 He's not supporting the shredder motors, we all hate it here.
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:12:56 He is messing around with the people who use it, hence why it's a tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:13:36 you should look it up
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:13:40 it's useful information
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:15:29 And this is what happens when the mods are all on Dnd
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:15:53 It's still very scummy
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:16:10 And i do not condone the use of it
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:17:17 why are people so unstable
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:19:18 Honestly i would've gotten the mods a while ago.
I have nothing against you but seeing this from a spectator perspective, since i barely know anyone here who's discussing, you started this argument.
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:25:15 Very easy once you get the hang of it
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:25:57 Don't invoke him
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:26:10 we were at peace
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:26:15 for a little while
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:27:46 Seriously man calm down, you've already started multiple arguments.
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:28:13 The mods are probably tired stop acting like a chimpanzee
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:29:41 Tank, you can clearly block someone and their messages won't even show up
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 12:30:02 No need to go all rambo with your babbling

plane-crazy 2020-09-10 13:00:26 Then sent to chile
plane-crazy 2020-09-10 13:00:48 We ordered them on the brink of ww1 due to a shipbuilding race in latin america

plane-crazy 2020-09-12 12:52:37 Oh well the problem with your space ship is more due to the design than the functionality i presume, which means i can’t help you much since I’ve never even made a space ship thingy before

general 2020-10-21 01:53:26 Very likely
general 2020-10-21 01:53:54 Guess studying is not his thing
general 2020-10-21 01:54:17 Wait i never said that

general 2020-10-21 01:56:07 Since it’s so shite
general 2020-10-21 01:57:09 Thats just a cylinder though
general 2020-10-21 01:58:35 I mean, it shouldn’t really affect you since it will probably look terrible afterwards on his part.
You can also blacklist him so he can’t copy you if you’re that stressed
general 2020-10-21 01:59:26 But i figure he won’t know how to make it work

plane-crazy 2020-10-21 15:04:41 It's a sandbox game
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 15:05:39 There's only like 1 or 2 people with in-game mod
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 15:05:56 One of them is Rick, which is developing the game
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 15:06:15 Meaning, he's busy all the time
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 15:06:38 Also, there's roblox which does have a report function

general 2021-03-18 03:06:22 No doubt
general 2021-03-18 03:06:53 ** game is being worked on to differ more from Minecraft **
general 2021-03-18 03:07:08 They should start by changing the name

general 2021-03-18 03:09:01 That’s just depressing honestly
general 2021-03-18 03:09:34 I would ask them to take it down if i was mojang
general 2021-03-18 03:10:21 It’s legit just added 2 words to the title of the game
general 2021-03-18 03:13:41 It just never ceases to amaze me how some people, particularly on Roblox, can get away with that much.
general 2021-03-18 03:14:02 It’s a complete ripoff and i doubt they care
general 2021-03-18 03:14:21 They should pokemon bronze the hell out of that game
