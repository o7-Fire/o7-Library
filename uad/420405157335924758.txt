The Tale of smilwastaken (420405157335924758)
general 2021-06-25 04:21:38 Howdy
general 2021-06-25 04:22:00 What the fuck
general 2021-06-25 04:22:22 Genuinely I might learn Linux just to escape that fuck THAT
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:26:21 I need to learn how to make better dive bombers, I retrofitted a fighter that was extremely ineffective into one using rockets (and also making it slightly top heavy) and it's significantly better matched to my playstyle
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:27:18 I don't think you can block yourself man
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:27:44 That's kinda sad ngl
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:27:51 Why live your life with hate
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:28:19 As long as you're not hurting anybody, what's the problem yknow?
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:28:52 And even people who do hurt others, I think they can be reformed into better people
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:29:57 Sclumge, please, touch grass
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:31:17 Juvi isn't much better but oKay
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:33:50 Hate as an option is never good. I believe everyone deserves love and help
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:34:07 So, by your argument, you'd be fine with a furry stabbing you to death?
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:34:17 True
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:34:35 Eh, idc

I'm just here to talk about dive bombers
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:36:18 A good tip it to hide thrusters everywhere
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:37:16 Id show you my current build but in bed and plane crazy does NOT run well on my phone
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:42:22 *what's motorlock*
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:42:50 Bro...
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:42:57 I feel bad
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:48:00 Dive bombers are fun as hell
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:48:27 You can drop down from the skies at mach speed, explode someone, refuse to elaborate, and just vanish
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:54:03 It's a roblox game from 2014
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:54:20 This has to be the most niche community on roblox
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:54:31 It's also night in the USA
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:54:43 Where a large chunk of the community is
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:57:57 I find it funny when theres people in pvp that act like they're a god with a jet engine and you just look up "plane crazy jet" and their exact design is the first result
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:58:30 Tutorials are just annoying imo
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 04:58:38 I can't follow video tutorials for the life of me
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 05:01:49 I just build fictional planes
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 05:02:09 I can't send it cause no image perms but my Little Fly dive bomber is the furthest thing from realistic
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 05:02:24 <:thoink:657279634563399720>
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 05:02:40 I'll dive bomb there asses
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 05:02:53 Don't need to be a good shot when you have four rockets coming for your ass
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 05:03:25 I also camouflaged it, idk if it's working or people are blind but nobody sees me until it's too late

plane-crazy 2021-06-25 05:35:56 Yo I know the perfect name for my next Dive Bomber
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 05:36:04 Deer Fly
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 05:36:20 *They drop down from the skies to bite people and drink their blood*
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 05:40:29 Doesn't it change how fast it extends and retracts
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 05:40:32 The wiki says that
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 05:40:40 Or that it can
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 05:53:09 I'm glad that I discovered how useful mouse motors are
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 05:53:26 Combined with rockets it gives your planes a sorta auto correct for dive bombing
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 05:53:53 It's hard coded, so while they could it's not worth the effort
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 05:54:24 Folding builds
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 06:19:15 Nice curve
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:50:27 Is there anyway to still get the fireworks? I want to make various AA guns and the fireworks seem useful
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:51:09 Wait, you can buy them?
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:51:39 Less wedges when
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:52:04 Do you know off the top of your head it's price? I don't get paid till Monday so
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:52:24 Oh that's nothing alright
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:52:39 <:Pinged:508027985190715457>
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:52:50 I have none of them.
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:52:56 I litterally only started playing recently
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:53:05 200 robux is 2 dollars
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:53:19 I get paid like 350 a week
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:53:54 But ye, I'll just buy it to make an AA gun
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:54:03 I also wanna make rocket arty
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:54:24 Idc
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:54:30 I make things to make them
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:54:42 *I make things to make them*
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:54:54 And also fireworks

plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:56:12 Yknow the Soviet rocket trucks? Ima try to make something like that
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 16:56:19 I'm also gonna make more dive bombers
bot-central 2021-06-25 16:56:35 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 17:07:56 Yeah, it's why it'd best to fit rockets on fast moving objects
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 17:08:26 Not only that, they go faster too
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 17:10:51 Ping is like golf
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 17:11:00 The higher the number the better
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 17:29:38 Did I stutter
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 17:47:17 What kind of games do you like?
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 17:48:30 So like, building and engineering games?
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 17:49:20 Id reccomend rimworld, check it out sometime uwu
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 17:50:37 Rimworld is fun, it's a colony management game that has alot of creative building
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 17:52:03 There always exists crossout and while it could be fun it's grindy as hell
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 17:53:11 They finally forgot they lived in the UK
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 17:53:15 You monster
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 17:54:05 I reccomend space station 13
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 17:54:14 Very chaotic game, has alot of creativity
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 20:58:13 How do yall make stuff like that?
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 20:59:03 With d?
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 20:59:33 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-06-25 21:00:28 <:Pinged:508027985190715457>
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 03:37:40 Question, what is the lightest material? Fabric I assume?
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 03:38:45 I assume it effects speed?
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 03:39:15 I want to make a Zero plane (or atleast attempt it, I suck at building) and I wanna know how to make it light enough to match roughly the zeros actual MPH
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 03:40:16 Wikipedia says that's about right
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 03:40:41 It worked best around 200 but got worse around 216
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 03:41:27 Is the speed equal to mph?
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 03:41:37 In plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 03:42:33 Do you know a way to convert blocks to miles 😅
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 03:55:32 So don't do that, got it
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:08:55 I've spent like an hour on my Zero and I've only just got the cockpits design down
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:08:59 It doesn't even look good
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:09:01 Oh well
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:09:17 I'll finish it, and when I'm done with it I'll retry it when I get better at building
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:13:06 Ah fuck it im scrapping it its trash
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:13:41 It's already massive and it's nowhere near done
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:13:55 God no
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:14:04 I am not going to finish that
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:14:17 Cause I know it won't fly
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:14:24 Especially since I'm only using propellers
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:14:52 Meh
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:32:34 
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:35:28 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:35:50 Update on my Zero: it looks like shit
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:39:13 Meh, I'll finish it
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:40:14 
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:40:28 The purple is not there to stay its only there cause white hurts my eyes
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:45:28 Is fabric or wood planks lighter?
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:46:17 Ah screw it wood planks looks better
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 04:47:18 Holy hell wood planks made me go from 140 to 200
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 05:07:42 It's gotten better (slightly)
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 05:08:18 
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 05:08:53 Next I'm just adding weaponry
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 05:18:30 My Zero is mediocre as hell, it's speed is meh, it's mobility is bad, and it barely looks like a zero
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 05:18:31 But eh
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 05:18:36 Who cares at this point
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 05:26:39 A go-kart
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 05:26:45 With anti air mounted on it
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 05:28:04 Does anyone have any good video recommendations to help with learning building?
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 05:29:10 Well atleast you're honest
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 05:30:58 Thank you man, and yeah I have been practicing but I just want help being pointed in the right direction
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 00:10:41 They're usually silent for me, and you either have nobody doing anything, or someone making dumb vehicles that just constantly annoy everyone
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 00:11:00 Say !rank in the bots channel
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 00:11:03 And just talk
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 01:58:16 I am building my first actually complex plane and it's not looking too bad so far

Who knew using references to get some key features would be useful
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 02:08:28 Basically, that means the code is so old and or usually personalized towards a certain person's style (or old style) that it's hard to edit by new or even the original coder
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 02:09:02 The fastest way to get around it is to throw all of the code out, but that has its own, obvious issues
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 02:13:38 I didn't make my planes fusalage long enough so I have to rebuild it
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 02:38:34 Boats are never seen either
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 02:38:54 That's awesome
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 02:38:59 That looks like the Merrimack?
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 02:39:54 My first ever jet plane isn't looking two terrible but ima have to fix the weight
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 02:40:02 Oh, well, it's still nice
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 02:45:43 What are some really heavy blocks? I wanna get my center of weight closer to the lift
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 02:46:06 Do they change the center of weight alot?
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 02:47:53 Ah, alright
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 02:48:08 My jet barely looks like a jet ;-;
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 02:48:13 I made it huge
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 02:48:14 Oh well
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 02:49:35 It's so top heavy it can't get liftoff without a jump, and even then it won't go up
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 03:00:29 The ballast blocks have been zero help
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 03:00:45 Not being able to see where the yellow arrows stand is not helpful
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 03:01:28 I just had an idea
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 03:01:38 I'll replace some of the internal super rockets with jet engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 03:03:43 Why don't I try to move the lift forward a bit
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 03:04:48 Now the plane looks like it has some fancy sideburns but it's alot better
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 03:11:13 I've gotten my plane to be able to lift off well
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 03:11:20 Now I need to increase its mobility
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 03:18:36 More control surfaces makes it easier to move up and down right?
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 03:49:17 We really need an option to enable a server wide blacklist, so when new people join you don't have to blacklist them
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 03:53:01 Cause pvp is constantly filled with people who join and immediately start flying into your plot while you're building
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 04:12:15 In a bit ye, doing something rn then gotta work on the plane some more
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 04:12:58 I discovered using motors on the back wings makes the mobility skyrocket (bam dum crash) so I'm doing that
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 04:52:51 What does enabling servo do on the motor
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 04:53:41 If you want
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 04:55:09 Robot idea, fuck shredders
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:04:44 This is my Supreme beetle. It sucks but it's an improvement in my "complex planes" department
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:05:07 ;-;
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:05:24 Okay that was added to help balance its weight
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:05:47 You basically told a four year old that their drawing sucks and that if they can't paint the Mona Lisa they suck
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:06:18 I tried those, it was too much of a pain in the ass to balance the plane without seeing the yellow
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:06:24 Yes, exactly
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:06:36 I started playing a week ago
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:06:54 And I refuse to use guides
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:07:24 
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:07:30 The yellow arrows I mean
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:09:30 I'm not good at the game, I'm just slowly improving
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:10:22 Only a couple days ago this was my best
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:10:33 and tbh its still a better plane than my recent one
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:10:55 Its genuinely good, it just looks ugly
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:11:41 Thats camo, or an attempt at it
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:12:33 I learn with my builds and I learnt alot from this one
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:12:46 Ye same
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:13:44 I'm scared to even approach those tbh 😅
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:15:15 Yeah, I always use mouse
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:17:41 Do you ever just
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:18:11 Dude you seem desperate to one up everything I say
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:19:25 Oh fuck I didn't watch my computer I've flown like miles off the map
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 05:20:43 
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:24:07 The plane that im gonna finish tomorrow, the Gray Fox
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:24:17 My second attaempt at a more complex design
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:24:26 well, second attempt thatll actually work
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:26:09 Yes it's shitty, but at the same time I started a week ago so what do you expect :p
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:27:59 Also decrease its weight
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:28:09 Replace it with wood planks
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:29:48 Cut down on blocks in the plane?
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:30:04 Replace the material with wood planks
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:30:06 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:31:27 Show us the plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:33:50 Well, like I said replace the material with wood planks
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:36:01 Reload the plane maybe?
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:36:10 If it's exactly 650 every time it could be bugged
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:36:14 Save and load it
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:36:31 W- what?
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:38:55 Like i said it could be bugged
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:39:26 Myth you are asking for help and rejecting all of it
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:39:42 Atleast *try*
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:43:29 Myth its broken
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:43:41 Reload it and see if that fixes it otherwise rebuild it
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:47:27 Myth get off of plane crazy and discord for a bit and calm down
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:48:37 That's not what im trying to do
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:48:43 I'm genuinely trying to help
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:48:58 I get like this too and that's what helps
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:51:08 Imagine if you had to have intakes on plane crazy
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 07:52:46 I wonder whats the fastest possible speed
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 08:00:55 50 people subscribed to your content pog
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 08:07:21 A 50 drop before a 100 rise
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 08:29:49 Lasofa
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 09:44:11 Ah yes, how to make your link seem legit for a largely American and European server

plane-crazy 2021-06-27 09:59:31 Probably shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 09:59:49 My little fly is litterally at this point just being designed to deal with them
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:04:08 People on pvp be like: I will make a turret and spawn kill people in build mode
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:05:12 Cause pvp is full of people who only get satisfaction by ruining everyone else's fun
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:07:34 The most annoying thing ever is when someone is in a blacklist cube and just spams a guided missile
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:10:32 I had someone have a giant folding battleship build that rammed into my plane that I was building when it opened, so I blacklisted them
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:12:42 I still find it funny when you can find someone's plane on like the first result of "plane crazy fast jet"

plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:16:48 Mine
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:16:51 No crafting
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:16:57 Craft
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:17:01 No mining
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:17:28 Shit craft
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:18:53 Shredder bug?

Do you mean: *I can't win with normal vehicles*
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:19:38 Bro you just need a single rocket and the shredder pisses itself
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:20:07 I was being chased by a shredder that couldn't hit my little fly cause of how small it was
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:20:19 And cause the shredder couldn't control his ball
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:20:47 He could only hit large planes
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:21:06 The plane isn't even that small, he just couldn't hit it
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:21:24 Anytime he got close I just slightly moved up
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:22:27 They rely on the target being big
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:23:10 If there's a bomber plane or god forbid a noob tutorial plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:23:40 real
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:25:41 Bombers don't work in plane crazy sadly
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:25:49 Dive bombers sure
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:25:57 But regular bombers are easy targets
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:27:35 So all shredder ball users?
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:28:01 Bro I just outrun them
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:28:18 They can't get me cause I always have guns on the back of my plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:28:49 Or just have good mobility tbh
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:29:00 They don't know what to do when they don't move in a predictable line
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:31:19 They usually don't know how to use it
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:31:35 Bro I've been playing for a week and the only time a shredder has killed me is when I'm on the ground
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:32:02 I use mouse controls except for my side to side movement and they just get obliterated
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:33:17 I suck at this game lmaoo
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:35:08 This is the best plane I've built so far and it's not even done
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:37:18 They have greater potential maneuverability
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:37:23 But they lack the skill
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:38:50 Wth are conveyer engines
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:38:53 I'm new fjfhfhdj
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:40:06 Idk what either of those are so that doesn't help

plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:42:50 Make soup with the tears of shredder users
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:45:47 Nobody would use it cause the only people who'd want to use it couldn't
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 10:48:32 Fun fact, large animals don't die of cancer cause they get cancer so often that the cancer kills the cancer
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 21:06:11 Is WASD or Mouse better for planes with motor controlled wings?
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 21:07:10 That's what I'm thinking
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 21:08:44 I just need to learn how to set up a plane for WASD
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 21:19:25 I looked it up
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 21:19:33 That's way easier than I thought it would be
plane-crazy 2021-06-27 22:00:52 My mom is dead
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 00:24:51 Wasd controls are weird
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 00:25:03 I like them but they're weird
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 00:25:14 They look nice
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 00:25:51 I'd make a boat but I can barely make planes
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 00:26:22 My planes float
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 00:27:00 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 00:28:48 Smooth enough
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 00:29:32 Time to make a wasd controlled plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 00:29:44 Does more control surfaces = faster turning?
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 00:31:03 It's also weird
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:32:46 i blacklisted someone on pvp and they got pissed
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:32:59 yes i am a girl
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:54:45 Especially since everyone here hates everything 😎
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:55:27 Idk, I've just had a bit of toxicity here, probably just cause I'm new
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:55:33 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:55:36 I am a girl
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 01:56:38 They said I'm sus for having trans girl
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 03:38:18 Yall have any tips for balancing wasd planes? No matter what I do with ballasts it's either going to tilt to the right or the left
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 03:38:52 It's tilting to one side
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 03:39:05 Perfectly
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 03:39:26 Not that I'm aware
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 03:40:11 I wonder if it's my faux propellers I put on the front
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 03:40:12 1 sec
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 03:40:34 Yup.
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 03:40:45 I'll just put some real propellers on
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 03:45:09 And any way to increase side to side mobility? My control surfaces aren't doing it well
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:48:42 Here's my Zero
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:48:48 Not good but for a noob I think I did alright
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:49:38 For a noob i think i did okay
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:50:30 And here's the kamikaze version
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:51:43 I know
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:51:50 I just wanted to pack as much bomb as possible
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:52:30 Tbh I didn't even think, I just thought "add bomb"
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:53:09 I'm not even playing lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:54:21 The kamikaze version isn't even used seriously
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:54:46 It's used as a "you have a large slow moving object what did you think would happen
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:55:36 I didn't make this seriously lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:55:55 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:56:00 I might try that sometime
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:56:09 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:56:25 Spam shredders on it and you have retrofitted your build
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 04:56:44 Suicide build
creations-chat 2021-06-28 04:59:38 Ik it's total shit but it's the best thing I've built so far so
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:02:34 Dont you need 359 people to forge a sword?
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:02:57 An iron sword
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:03:23 Idk, I just read it somewhere
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:08:09 God dang
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:14:50 I've been playing for a little over a week and this is all I can manage
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:15:00 Just do what you want, and do it how you want
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:15:39 I can't fold either, so I just don't
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:16:54 Get used to people saying advanced terms without explaining
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:19:17 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:19:31 Obviously the feathers
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:22:24 What weighs more

0.1×10^(1) of iron or 1k of feathers
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:22:39 Wanna bet

plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:25:14 How many pounds of gunpowder could you eat before you die
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:25:25 Including time it takes to ingest
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:25:55 So the limit is 23.993369
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:26:01 Good to know
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:26:32 How many pounds of cheese could you eat before you cease
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:27:02 So the limit is actually 483.19 pounds
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:27:45 A budget that's entirely used for cheese
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:29:40 People who do that are annoying ngl
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:29:53 I've had people break through blacklist walls
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:29:57 They're annoying
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:30:08 Cause they do everything to try to get you to react
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:30:30 Then they break back in
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:30:36 I ignore them cause they give up

creations-chat 2021-06-28 05:55:36 At that point I was pissed to find out the faux propeller I have been using was breaking the stability of the plane so I just gave up
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:56:22 When I get better at building I'm gonna try to make a Zero again
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:56:34 I'm still proud of this but I know it's pretty bad
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:57:54 Shredder balls are best fought with excessive missiles
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:58:03 And fast aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:58:09 Well, not even just fast
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 05:58:19 A mobile aircraft will destroy them
creations-chat 2021-06-28 06:09:49 Okay
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 06:22:05 I suck at dogfighting tbh
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 06:22:18 I'm better at bombing runs

plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:11:26 I think ima try to build a boat after work tomorrow, don't know what kind but something lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:13:44 My best plane is this shit
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:13:56 My poor attempt at a zero
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:14:53 It's not even bad in terms of flight, a bit wonky to control but it wasn't horrid
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:15:07 It's guns aren't very good but it's missile is pretty alright
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:15:18 It also has a camera at the top of the cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:16:39 Oh yeah, here's my meme kamikaze version of the zero
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:16:54 It's pretty good for slow or large targets but sucks otherwise
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:19:01 Mhm

plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:21:27 Ww1 tank pog
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:21:46 I kinda wanna build a monitor ironclad
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:22:09 Cannons will be hard but if all fails I'll just use missiles
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:22:18 Oh god now I wanna play rts games
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:22:20 I miss them
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:22:40 I suck at building
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:22:54 And I've never built a boat
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:23:12 My Zero is the only build I like
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:23:17 And it's mediocre at best
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:23:48 It's cause whatever people say I don't give a damn
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:24:00 When I make something I like I share it
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:24:08 If others don't like it who gives a damn
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:24:45 Bro that ship is awesome
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:25:15 I take advice, but their idea of advice is "you suck stop playing"
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:25:52 Least he has the guts to try
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:26:43 And? I've seen them too
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:27:30 Am I slandering other people's builds?
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:27:36 Genuinely
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:27:43 I don't think im slandering other people's builds?
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:28:28 What was wrong with it?
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:28:42 Use the rank command again maybe?
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:28:55 Like I said, least they're trying
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:30:23 YES AGREED
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:30:49 I like youtubers that teach you how to do smaller parts of things, and then let you figure out how to piece it together
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:33:19 I wish you luck man
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:33:47 Wait, I think I saw you in game earlier
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:33:58 Actually no
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:34:08 It was a similar build but it was an aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:35:02 Gerald
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:35:42 Okay but fr, just do something generic like falcon
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:36:19 My zeros callsign is useless
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:38:05 Aircraft carrier with mini fighters that can be piloted individually
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:38:28 My Zero would blow it up on contact
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 07:40:44 Why is it out of its nest
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:00:41 I focus on making my builds glass cannons, might as well focus on speed and strength instead of trying to make or survive
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:01:25 A term that means something that can't take much damage but powerful
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:07:31 I've considered making a suicide bomber that stabs in the front with shredders, stabs through the object, and hooks onto it so It can detonate
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:08:19 Kinda but it can also be used to disable instead of destroy
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:10:37 Lava spitters are meme weapons
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:12:19 Bro that was from last year
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:15:31 I physically cannot touch grass
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:16:29 No grass is obliterated in my mere presence
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:17:39 23.74 inches
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:17:46 Or on Tuesdays, 2 feet
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:26:16 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:26:33 Flood the damn place with whatever you want, who cares how downvote bombed you get
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:26:54 I got 4 upvotes on my little fly and that made me happy
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:28:36 You get within 10 feet of that you're losing a limb
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:29:02 Hey, that's only -67 upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:29:06 It could be worse
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:29:27 Considering it was my first build that worked that wasn't total shit
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:29:37 I still use it to this day just cause it's good
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:31:18 I don't care how many downvotes I get, I liked the build so I post it

plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:34:31 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:34:35 Piss them off
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:35:09 They got mad at me for the build then started being transphobic so idc what happens at this point
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:35:56 Best thing is all of my builds have effort even if they look like shit
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:36:39 About 10 days or so
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:36:51 Mhm
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:37:34 Post the everything
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:37:42 Have every block in a build and make it work
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:39:07 Tomorrow after work ima build the monitor, or try too
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:39:13 Will it look good? Ha no
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:39:17 But I'll try so
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:40:27 No

plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:42:25 My little fly has mostly become an anti shredder device dudjdjdj
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 08:52:12 Just go to random caves and you'll find it
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 09:00:56 Paint it desert camo
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 09:01:21 At that point it would confuse the enemy so much they become easy targets
plane-crazy 2021-06-28 09:03:26 Niceeeeee
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 02:33:53 my first attempt at a boat. looks like trash, is trash, but it floats and can swim
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 02:34:20 the centerpiece is a rotating turret a la the monitor, but with machine guns. its trash but eh
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:01:59 My kamikaze is actually pretty effective once you get the timing down
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:04:34 Make a kamikaze plane
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:04:43 When they get too close set off the bomb
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:05:44 Question, does increasing Blast pressure or radius have any negatives to them?
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:05:53 It's fun
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:05:56 Not viable
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:05:58 But fun
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:10:54 Anybody have tips for how to stop explosive block explosions from being delayed
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:11:47 Yeah but why not
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:11:58 The funny meme requires it
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:13:32 Damn, was hoping there would rb an easier way of doing it
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:14:34 Ye my Zero rips apart then explodes
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:15:01 When it should explode then rip apart
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 03:16:30 I hope the next map we get has a larger ocean
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 07:01:45 It's garbage, but it works so
plane-crazy 2021-06-29 13:18:03 That's every plane without wings
general 2021-06-29 16:44:39 That's not a game
general 2021-06-29 16:44:43 That's an addiction
general 2021-06-29 16:44:58 Marc I hope you become a sock
