plane-crazy 2019-02-27 03:48:11 For example the gozanti class
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 03:48:26 That can either carry cargo walkers or fighters
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 03:48:38 For cargo?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 03:48:40 Or what
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 03:49:11 Ok
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 03:49:51 Try a YT-1300 freighter
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 03:50:05 It's what the Millennium falcon is
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 03:50:35 Or barleen class heavy freighter
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 03:50:42 Barleen class
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 03:50:50 It was on force awakens

plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:38:53 
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:38:55 This was the first elevator test
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:39:14 It's so blocky lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:39:25 But I have no save space left so I can't add more detail
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:39:30 I wish I could

plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:41:56 K well gtg do research on my carrier I'm basing it off the Yorktown my favorite carrier
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:42:12 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:42:20 Do u not research ur builds?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:42:41 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:42:49 For research
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:42:54 About the carrier
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:43:12 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:43:18 I'm cracking open my books
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:43:36 I do *exstensive* research for my builds
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:43:48 To make them as close as possible to the real thing
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:43:59 I use either reference photos or 3d models
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:44:06 There r a ton online
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:44:33 But for specific things like the Yorktown I  will do books
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:44:42 Yes the Yorktown has no 3d models
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:44:48 It's a shame
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:45:03 Is that what ur basing urs off of?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:45:27 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:45:45 When ient base I meant that I worded it incorrectly
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:45:50 *ment
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:45:54 My bad
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:46:17 Do your carriers have planes?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:46:28 I like adding planes I can sit in and fly around
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:46:39 And bomb or attack people
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:46:49 But I can never land cause of the speed
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:47:00 So parachute blocks will be handy
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:47:10 Why
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:47:12 I do
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 06:47:36 ?

creations-chat 2019-05-08 04:17:13 and with the last ounce of will in my body i give you it color coded so you can copy it and pass it as your own,
Red is the engine part that moves the entire thing
Yellow is what i call first gear it moves when the engine is on
Green is second gear the 3 pistons are used for moving the counter shaft and output shaft into position
Blue is for third gear the one piston is used for connecting the input and output shaft together
Grey is nothing really important 
Black is where you can attatch it to the main body of your vehicle
(also forgot to add this put on the far left that motor/block thing is your output)
creations-chat 2019-05-08 04:18:03 the bit colored pink is output, also requesting rank inventor pls
plane-crazy 2019-05-08 04:18:59 <@!437078588701933568>  yes

plane-crazy 2019-05-10 01:55:02 wait so ur saying for DCT
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 01:55:09 add another shaft ontop?
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 01:55:32 the problem isnt adding more gears thats easier
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 01:55:41 the problem is getting the combinations right
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 01:55:59 there is a maximum amount of combinations i can do before i repeat them
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 01:56:11 and since i cant use 2x2 cylinders that limits it by alot
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 01:57:44 o my gawd
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 01:57:51 how did i not think of that
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 01:57:54 im on it
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 01:58:40 k
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 01:58:46 only one thing
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 01:58:58 idk which materials have more or less friction
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 01:59:02 ik ice has the least
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 01:59:08 and fabric has the most
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 01:59:19 but apart from that i got no clue where everything else places
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:06:23 looking good
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:06:54 k so turns out using different materials just makes the thing slip and not change the speed
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:07:37 i tried all of em
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:07:48 np
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:07:48 im gonna write down all the combinations i can make
plane-crazy 2019-05-10 02:07:54 then see if there r any i missed

plane-crazy 2019-06-03 05:29:02 o
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 05:29:12 now i feel sad
creations-chat 2019-06-03 06:36:29 i probably put this off for to long but i finnaly did it i made a working car using my gear box design
creations-chat 2019-06-03 06:36:55 a little run down of how it works
creations-chat 2019-06-03 06:37:43 these rockets were once a motor but it was to weak and couldnt push the wheels so i used rockets instead, these act as the "engine" powering the input shaft
creations-chat 2019-06-03 06:39:23 Moving across the input shaft the red gears work to use gears one and two while the yellow and blue use three and four, by moving them in different directions i can order them into making the correct gear combinations for the different speeds, 1 slow, 2 kinda slow, 3 moderate speed, 4 jesus calm down and take the wheel
creations-chat 2019-06-03 06:41:02 the output shaft is shown here (top rod) aswell as well as the counter shaft (below rod) counter shaft connects the input and output shafts for different speeds, the orange gear also is used in first gear
creations-chat 2019-06-03 06:42:15 here is it all together basically how it works in a summary is the input shaft stays at one continues speed, the counter shaft allows the gears to be moved back in forth to create new combinations, the combinations allow the output shaft to spin at different speeds and move the car
creations-chat 2019-06-03 06:42:27 also the most advanced steering ever right here
creations-chat 2019-06-03 06:43:03 phew thats all of it, requesting rank inventor pls this gear box keeps me awake at night

plane-crazy 2019-06-03 08:52:10 Vip
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 08:52:58 Arm on key means you can press the button twice 9r if you have explode on impact it will arm the bomb
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 08:53:21 Impact speed sets the speed the bomb must be going at once it hits the ground to explode
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 08:53:47 Lol ty
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 08:54:48 If its at 0 once it touches it will explode but lets say its at 50 it has to be going 50 or above to explode
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 08:55:29 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 08:55:47 What would you have it set to
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 08:56:22 So it would have to be going atleast 50 speed to explode
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 08:56:25 Ok

plane-crazy 2019-06-03 08:58:05 Ok so
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 08:58:18 Lets say you have an explosive
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 08:58:33 And you have arm in key on aswell as explode on impact
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 08:58:49 Aslong as you dont hit the keybind that will arm the bomb
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 08:58:54 It wont explode
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 08:59:00 But once you hit it
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 08:59:05 And the bomb drops
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 08:59:10 It will explode
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 09:03:50 Wdym
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 09:04:41 Is explode on impact on?
plane-crazy 2019-06-03 09:04:56 And speed is at 0

plane-crazy 2019-06-28 07:42:58 The system i use
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 07:43:10 Has an anchor block that the creation is rotated around
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 07:43:23 And i put it down so i dragged him into the see
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 07:43:30 Using my tentscles to gram him
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 07:43:37 *tentacles

plane-crazy 2019-06-28 07:46:48 So i wrapped my tentacoes around him
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 07:47:04 Used the anchor block to tilt the ship under
plane-crazy 2019-06-28 07:47:17 Yes

bug-reports 2019-10-21 07:04:34 Motor torque fixes nothing right now
bug-reports 2019-10-21 07:04:54 Motor 2 servo is oofed and has no torque or speed
bug-reports 2019-10-21 07:05:32 And motor 2 mouse control just summons kithulo and banishes you to the 7th dimension
bug-reports 2019-10-21 14:14:05 To put it into perspective currently my stukas cockpit refuses to close and the wings are so slow I crash into the ground after a dive cause I cant pull up, my tiger tank has turned to summoning cthulu and the turret has turned into a helicopter, my HMS Exeter has decided that her guns and hull have better things to do and become increasingly more concerned about reaching the 8th dimension, my millennium falcon refuses to bend its front down and will constantly do loops now and can you guess what they all use together? That a right kids motor 2
bug-reports 2019-10-21 14:32:49 Gg
bug-reports 2019-10-21 14:33:28 At least one good thing we pulled out of this is that we found new ways to tap into the speed force

bot-central 2020-09-25 04:14:47 -mapsuggest Use the maps from the two competitions that were held as candidates for new maps so we dont have an overflow of new submissions, the ones for the two contests already had guidelines to follow and I bet some people still have their maps around this would make the selection smaller and easier to manage aswell as being able to implement the map sooner since its already complete.

plane-crazy 2022-11-02 21:49:15 Feels like the creation channel is so brutal now
plane-crazy 2022-11-02 21:49:47 some people who arent the best share something they build and it gets downvoted to hell and back
plane-crazy 2022-11-02 21:50:47 sometimes the builds arent even half bad, i bet its demotivating for people
plane-crazy 2022-11-02 21:53:44 its a shame creations used to be a channel people could just show off builds and get judged off their creativity not skill
plane-crazy 2022-11-02 21:54:04 like yea skill has a place and good builds are cool but cut people some slack
plane-crazy 2022-11-02 21:54:14 Half wedge
