general 2020-11-15 23:00:00 if I make a plane and it does a backflip as soon as it goes off the ground what's wrong with it?
general 2020-11-15 23:00:22 ty
general 2020-11-15 23:00:25 how do I fix that tho lol
general 2020-11-15 23:00:48 k ty
general 2020-11-15 23:04:53 I've added like 20 ballast beams to the front and my plane still flips
general 2020-11-15 23:05:43 > <@!335973946585251863>  that’s not how you fix it
<@!466793357318815744> I asked how to make it stop backflipping
general 2020-11-15 23:06:05 what do you suggest then/
general 2020-11-15 23:06:40 they're like 1.5 blocks away
general 2020-11-15 23:06:52 center of lift is 1.5 blocks ahead of the center of mass
general 2020-11-15 23:07:34 > <@!335973946585251863>  ok first, is the center of lift and mass centered with each other? Like merged together?
<@!466793357318815744> center of lift is 1.5 blocks ahead of the center of mass
general 2020-11-15 23:08:17 > <@!335973946585251863>  you need to get them as vented as possible, that’s most likely the reason it’s doing that thing
<@!466793357318815744> I'm out of room in my plane rn, adding wings isn't possible and removing blocks makes holes in the plane
general 2020-11-15 23:09:05 
general 2020-11-15 23:09:28 <@!466793357318815744> the front of it closes and the stuff in the back falls down because of motors but other than that not much motion
general 2020-11-15 23:10:52 it's a spaceship lmao
general 2020-11-15 23:10:57 no
