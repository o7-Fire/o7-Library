plane-crazy 2020-10-05 14:23:36 i’m gonna make a better lay-out when everything is ready and working
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 14:30:12 anyone knows a solution? D:
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 14:46:22 if i would cut it in half, the weight would be exactly the same
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 14:46:30 so i don’t understand any of this logic
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:04:36 i’m already struggling with this stupid submarine for 4 days, THERE IS LITTERLY NO LOGIC FOR IT TO SPIN LIKE THAT
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:08:06 it just goes upside down slowly
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:08:20 for no reason
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:08:34 i’m trying everything but nothing works
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:08:49 no why?
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:08:52 it’s a submarine
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:09:18 i’m placing ballast blocks already everywhere
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:09:31 and it keeps spinning the same way everytime
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:09:33 what
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:09:43 i did
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:10:26 ballast tanks are for it to dive right?
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:10:59 you want to join my server to help? or should i send a video of it
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:11:09 video?
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:11:26 i’m already trying... for 4 days
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:12:13 but what if i have a uno reverse card
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:13:46 so i have to place ballast tanks throughout the ship to make it dive, but does that fix the spinning?
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:55:53 i give up! i’ll just make it so it’s upside down on the plot!
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:58:05 a submarine
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:58:11 i wont make it so it’s upside down
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:58:20 it keeps going upside down when i go into the water
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:58:33 i can send a video of it
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 16:58:35 yea
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:11:03 i can’t make the stupid video shorter it just wouldn’t load, and i need nitro if i want to send long videos, i’ll just send it in DMs
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:11:33 it just loaded
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:12:02 it still doesn’t send it to discord tho
plane-crazy 2020-10-05 17:20:25 > <@417278507941363742> so your sub is going upside down when submerged, right
<@456226577798135808>

general 2021-04-03 13:51:14 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 14:12:22 there needs to be a block that sticks to other blocks (like normal blocks stick together) on one side only, and all other sides it doesn't stick (or all other sides are 0.9)
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 14:13:21 are golden bars a full block in length?
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 14:17:14 is there any block that has at least 2 sides that don't stick to other blocks (are shorter than 1) but do have at least 1 side that does stick to other blocks?

plane-crazy 2021-04-06 15:16:10 my piston just hangs down while all the others are retracted
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 15:16:32 what does that do?
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 15:17:15 i don't really understand what motorlock does
plane-crazy 2021-04-06 15:17:25 i could test it

the-dump 2021-10-05 14:02:11 hoping to build this in plane crazy
the-dump 2021-10-05 14:02:39 was planning no making it a space ship but it looked a lot like a ship so i kinda changed it
the-dump 2021-10-05 14:02:52 asteriods could also be ice (mining ice) or something
the-dump 2021-10-05 14:03:04 i'm gonna get some small mining planes too
the-dump 2021-10-05 14:03:15 it also has explosive boats
the-dump 2021-10-05 14:03:24 i've only folded once
the-dump 2021-10-05 14:03:26 (a destroyer)
the-dump 2021-10-05 14:03:47 runway is big
the-dump 2021-10-05 14:03:52 it's mostly for my planes
the-dump 2021-10-05 14:04:18 right what?
the-dump 2021-10-05 14:04:27 oh
the-dump 2021-10-05 14:04:35 i'm not gonna get big planes
the-dump 2021-10-05 14:04:38 just some small ones
the-dump 2021-10-05 14:04:51 also, i'm probably gonna build a lot less missiles
the-dump 2021-10-05 14:04:57 and i'd like to get a big interior
the-dump 2021-10-05 14:05:11 i'm gonna fold it on top
the-dump 2021-10-05 18:12:21 what hull should i do for my AC
the-dump 2021-10-05 18:12:35 or this
the-dump 2021-10-05 18:13:04 idc
the-dump 2021-10-05 18:13:09 it's not mine lol
the-dump 2021-10-05 18:13:40 ah

plane-crazy 2021-10-06 18:25:02 oppinions on the hull
plane-crazy 2021-10-06 18:25:10 the shape on the ground
plane-crazy 2021-10-06 18:25:42 
plane-crazy 2021-10-06 18:46:04 yes, but it's just for decoration.
plane-crazy 2021-10-06 18:46:11 i might make them go straight
plane-crazy 2021-10-06 19:07:27 the hull is gonna be a bit smaller
plane-crazy 2021-10-06 19:07:36 i'm more worried about folding stuff on top of it
plane-crazy 2021-10-06 19:07:48 because i don't have a lot of space
plane-crazy 2021-10-06 19:25:21 i want three lines (decortion)
plane-crazy 2021-10-06 19:26:15 ty
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 10:38:27 isn't it too long and fat?
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 10:38:59 
plane-crazy 2021-10-09 10:53:55 I JUST JUMPED FROM ABOVE ONTOP OF THIS SHIP AND FELL TROUGH THIS 1 WIDE HOLE INTO THE PILOT SEAT

the-dump 2021-10-18 18:25:59 ...with three guns
the-dump 2021-10-18 18:27:15 two or three guns??
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 12:40:13 why wont the pistons go down? they keep getting stuck, the same goes with going up
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 12:41:08 i painted the walls ice before, but that didn't work
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 12:41:35 yes
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 12:42:14 
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 12:42:22 could it be that wedge?
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 12:43:21 nope
plane-crazy 2021-10-19 12:44:18 half wedges?
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 16:09:47 how big is a plot?
plane-crazy 2021-10-20 16:16:56 52 x 52 x 39
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 19:43:02 when i shoot the tnt explodes at the orange circles, i am using 4 super magnets to launch 2 tnt with a disconnector part. i have them on max impact
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 19:43:34 stupid thing
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 19:43:40 i agree
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 19:44:03 how could i fix it?
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 19:44:19 i could try decreasing the magnet strength, but that would reduce the range
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 19:44:22 ?
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 19:44:40 i have them armed on impact, but when i use the disconnector it gets armed
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 19:44:55 i did think about that, but i want to have like 12 projectiles
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 19:45:05 i wouldn't have enough keys
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 19:47:42 i could also shorten the barrel
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 19:47:47 but that would make it ugly
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 20:03:06 i think i should increase the range
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 20:05:12 next try the tnt exploded inside the barrel /: anyone got any ideas on how to fix this
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 20:10:15 this is inside the barrel
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 20:10:40 it keeps exploding inside
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 20:10:56 that would make it ugly
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 22:10:49 hmm yes, my bad

plane-crazy 2022-04-28 18:07:58 I think there should be more aa things in PC2, because the thing I dislike about plane crazy (I still like PC) is that there are mostly fast planes which are basically impossible to shoot down (or require you to respawn like 10 times in order to finally shoot something down)
plane-crazy 2022-04-28 18:15:02 your build ugly
