bot-central 2022-06-19 04:48:37 hm
bot-central 2022-06-19 04:48:53 so we should talk in longer sentences, that way we level up faster
bot-central 2022-06-19 04:49:11 i mean its a pretty generic color to be honestr
bot-central 2022-06-19 04:49:36 so what are you leveling up for? the ability to post something in creations?
bot-central 2022-06-19 04:50:09 ah nice
bot-central 2022-06-19 04:50:19 i have two builds that im really proud of
bot-central 2022-06-19 04:50:58 i built them both myself, no tutorial. They are the darkstar from top gun maverik, and a v22 osprey. adding more text to level up fast now
bot-central 2022-06-19 04:51:35 unnecessary comas, and periods. go. now, they appear to make sentences look much longer, and better.

bot-central 2022-06-19 04:55:21 im currently working on a cargo plane
bot-central 2022-06-19 04:55:28 but the propellers don't work
bot-central 2022-06-19 04:55:34 it flaps its wings
bot-central 2022-06-19 04:55:45 exactly
bot-central 2022-06-19 04:55:58 youve seen it too?
bot-central 2022-06-19 04:56:03 nice
bot-central 2022-06-19 04:56:50 i know it works because when i was working on my osprey i used motors to align the wings at that obtuse angle, but i overshot the distance and if i spammed the button fast enough it would actually fly a bit

creations-chat 2022-06-19 22:07:17 ok\
creations-chat 2022-06-19 22:09:44 it really does
creations-chat 2022-06-19 22:12:27 this is the original darkstar, i couldnt quite get the cockpit or the wingspan right, but oh well
creations-chat 2022-06-19 22:31:48 they left the knob of the trapdoor on the righthand turret unpainted, a clear mess-up and symbol of failure.
creations-chat 2022-06-19 23:01:31 i did, its rgb code 10, 10, 10.
creations-chat 2022-06-19 23:06:41 no markings on the darkstar except ones too tiny to replicate, the height it just right don't know what's wrong about it, its all black in the movie so it is an accurate paint job, you can see the trails but not in flight, and the cockpit does not need a 1 block interior. Also, me "making fun" of the amazing build that somehow did not get put on the wall of fame was me being sarcastic.
creations-chat 2022-06-19 23:15:07 yes
creations-chat 2022-06-20 00:22:34 im building the hindenpeter
creations-chat 2022-06-20 00:33:30 the hindenpeter is making great progress
creations-chat 2022-06-20 01:00:02 sorry i know they add weight, but are they just for submarines? im building the hidenpeter and its going to be hard to adjust height
creations-chat 2022-06-20 01:21:09 are you kidding? i love club battle: ground unlearned!
creations-chat 2022-06-20 01:23:35 ace battle i love it
creations-chat 2022-06-20 01:35:30 im horrible at faces, let alone pixel art faces, my painting skills will either run this hindenpeter or make it the most upvoted thing in the server
creations-chat 2022-06-20 02:22:39 should i spend the next hour putting in the smile or should i just slap some propellers on it and get VTOL engineer 2 and in the hall of fame
creations-chat 2022-06-20 03:18:08 do you guys know how hard it is to equally balance helium blocks and ballast blocks in a hidenpeter
creations-chat 2022-06-20 05:02:22 Rip someone just pinged me in <#384025409945337856> and got muted
creations-chat 2022-06-20 16:38:30 why thank you *cough cough* blue team *cough cough*
creations-chat 2022-06-20 16:43:30 tbh i just saw that red team builds where getting upvotes, so i took the peter off my hindenpeter and colored it red. Sue me
creations-chat 2022-06-20 18:08:42 any thoughts on my front zeppelin? (yes i know it sucks, so tell me what i should improve and not how much it sucks)
creations-chat 2022-06-20 18:19:00 i do like that idea, i think i might build a second zeppelin with that in mind. Although do you happen to have a tutorial with how to do the thing where you have 2 parts of a ship, and you use motors and cameras to fling them together?
creations-chat 2022-06-20 18:22:21 ty
creations-chat 2022-06-21 03:31:00 im making a zeppelin, ive decided on this nice side design, but i dont know what to do for the diagonal edges. Any advice?
creations-chat 2022-06-21 17:01:00 so if i have like 50 ballast tanks i can counter the effects of helium? just change your reply to a yes yes or something
creations-chat 2022-06-21 18:24:58 figured out how to make a motor lock! anyone know how i can make the motors not exposed?
creations-chat 2022-06-21 18:26:59 sorry i meant motor fold, ive been playing this game for i dont know how long but still learning the technical terms. whats motorlocking?
creations-chat 2022-06-21 18:30:55 ok
creations-chat 2022-06-21 18:38:22 is it ok to ping a mod in <#705941616199991307>? they havnt responded yet and i posted like 2 hours ago
creations-chat 2022-06-21 18:40:24 alright cool
creations-chat 2022-06-21 20:35:49 <@!887490533990223902> that truck is amazing lets get it on the wall of fame
creations-chat 2022-06-21 22:27:32 helium distribution. help.
creations-chat 2022-06-21 22:29:57 thanks, ill just make my motor lock look like a turret and call it good
creations-chat 2022-06-21 23:40:58 hey dontcallmebad, i asked earlier if you can use ballast tanks outside of water, do you have to connect them to ballast blocks/beams?
creations-chat 2022-06-21 23:45:31 im currently going insane over weight distribution in a zeppelin, so i guess it would still technically apply (except the fact that i cannot make air heavier)
creations-chat 2022-06-21 23:47:36 ive tried that multiple times, has not worked
creations-chat 2022-06-21 23:49:42 nevermind it works thanks guys
creations-chat 2022-06-22 00:07:10 i think i accidentally made a motor lock, thing is im trying to do a camera fold
creations-chat 2022-06-22 00:36:12 how do i get rid of this ugly motor
creations-chat 2022-06-22 00:48:19 thats genius
creations-chat 2022-06-22 18:10:52 <@!447788748495650816> good game
creations-chat 2022-06-22 19:13:41 nice i now will get bullied for having trash builds and not having a white name
