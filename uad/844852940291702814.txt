creations-chat 2022-04-26 16:39:09 and neither is my other tonk <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
creations-chat 2022-04-26 16:49:56 <@689192740101161002> the plane look a bit too thick ,i dont wanna offense u but might wanna make the plane longer,slimmer,fixing the nose cuz uh it aint suppose to be like that,but meh still an ok build
creations-chat 2022-04-26 16:51:57 well i mean its true,if u take a look at the T90,meat ball launcher,the 1 shot tank then u will notice that all of them are l o n g af
here an example,my newly built tank
<@456615519244648459> it does look better
creations-chat 2022-04-26 17:00:37 <@802715500244893758> the ship is a bit short,the gun portion comepare to the hull is kinda unbalanced and u missing thing like the RUR-5 ASROC grenade launcher that suppose to be on the ship also,so basicly lenghthen the ship front,making the bridge kinda lower cuz its too big,making the gun a bit smaller,its ok to not do so if ur building capability isnt able to do so,adding the RUR-5 ASROC between the bridge and the turret near it,might wanna note that u should also make the turret behind kinda like 0.5 block higher
that all i have to say for now,hope u got some improvement for ur ship,it is good at the current state but could be better,but meh ur choice is ur choice aint gonna interfere 👍
creations-chat 2022-04-26 17:04:46 i dont really know much abt building ship in this game as i only have 1 single destroyer ship in my slot,but yeah hope this can kind of help something

creations-chat 2022-04-27 15:31:27 <@887490533990223902> it kinda ***thicc*** and arent it suppose to be kind of flatter? 
<@456226577798135808> i just notice it kind of look like the north korea tank lmao,north korea tank typicaly have some trait from the typical old russia tank and they would normaly be armed with additional ATGM on the side of le turret

creations-chat 2022-05-03 15:06:51 should i focus finishing my current build or start smth else that actually easier and are NOT oversized and too hard for my capablity limit.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 15:09:07 ima call that a yes as my dumbass brain even barely able to figure out how ima build the hull front
creations-chat 2022-05-03 15:11:11 lemme guess... after the flash? and yeah i dont know adding more of those trash scrap lying around since u in a wasteland where everything is literal trash and yes add something like a broken vehicle,maybe a downed heli or a broken down car that got deformed and missing alot of it part?
creations-chat 2022-05-03 15:15:38 so basicly,u in a wasteland that basicly became like that after a war broke out,what do u want? these,smth like a broken tank,it will add smth to the build and not making it feeling like some random thing happen without explaination,adding a broken road beside it to make it even better,adding some kind of dead tree or bushes,if u dont like the idea of abram then its kinda ok but might wanna add smth like a bush or more of those trash pile and some broken road that got some part of it covered in sant,just do smth that make it kind of having some lore behind and making it looking like an actual wasteland instead of a random house build by broke people in the mid of the desert.

hmn seem u dont like this idea then meh im out of way to help
my dumbass brain aint having much imagination anyawy
creations-chat 2022-05-03 15:17:47 yeah sure sure add a car,and something else like empty box of something like ammunition or supply or smth or smth else dropped by the military or some one else :I and oh ik add a mtfking light pole
creations-chat 2022-05-03 15:19:37 just add a light pole that all :D

creations-chat 2022-05-03 15:22:39 just add a fucking light pole that all the bs u need for it,arent the road suppose to have some kind of light pole that some how survive the fucking blast?
creations-chat 2022-05-03 15:24:22 yes it is movie logic,but in an actual wasteland there is pole that can actually survive the blast if they are far enough,and from how that house got build i guess it kinda far from the nuclear blast,far enough so that the radiation kind of low and the blast wont having much effect on bs there
creations-chat 2022-05-03 15:26:59 well i mean he kinda true cuz the community looking from outside it good but inside it actually not good,i dont think ima survive here for longer,even after able to make some build that people actually like bet i wont survive for month after posting that

creations-chat 2022-06-05 13:58:13 might mind u abt making it shorter as the blade gonna collide with the focking tail when spinning and dude ah1 blade aint that long either...i think its only reach to the nose
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:01:37 why everyone keep escalating the arguement... <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:04:04 yeah i mean he got bad english,doesnt try to make the arguement die down and instead making it even worse by keep trying to fight back knowing people already know his weakpoint to fucking penetrate and win in arguement against him blah blah <:empty:794431705070174238>
<@504577008383033344> then idk
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:06:31 u mean he keep sending link of his build? i think he just kind of asking for feedback rather than trying to beg for upvote,just talked to him earlier and idk the sintuation is just confusing
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:11:31 alr this is getting confusing and me i wanna die
<@504577008383033344> yeah that abt right
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:14:03 depending on what plane u currently based on,Airbus or boeing or whatever
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:16:37 ur plane kind of inspired from the boeing 777 so meh
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:19:08 shit an airbus? nah i dont think so,more like a boeing 737 <:empty:794431705070174238> (if u ever question then yes im enthusiastic abt both commercial and military aircraft)
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:21:26 <@774696277669314602> do this <:hahaa:773727260539617280> (ur ecommerical bullshit resemble the 737 more,trust me looking at the nose)
or u can do a320 livery
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:23:32 ima take that back ur aircraft resemble a airbus a320 due to it round nose instead of pointy like sparrow
but yeah just do smth simple like this british airway livery for the a320
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:25:42 no its a320,737 nose is more pointy while the a320 is more round which is exactly what in the pic mf sent,***round*** <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:27:44 uh i think abt 1.5block is fine 
<@786157960770093096> both aircraft cockpit window are literally the same,so i declare it the focking a320,u cant argue with that <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:30:15 and was abt to tell u that i took that back as 1 block seem to fit the scale better <:KEKW:670310537300672528> 
<@774696277669314602> i think blue gonna fit perfect with ur plane 
<@786157960770093096> meh i do prefer boeing but for the sake of accuracy yeah i declare it the a320 <:empty:794431705070174238>
no one give much fuck abt the window they only give fuck abt the nose
creations-chat 2022-06-05 14:33:07 hmn yeah sure <:empty:794431705070174238>

creations-chat 2022-06-06 13:20:01 yeah the cancer f cancer in mw
creations-chat 2022-06-08 04:57:02 both harrier and f22 kinda overrated,f22 yeah have sophisicated technology but if u give that same technology used on the f22 to a su27/30/35 then it no different beside u also got the same plane for a much cheaper price,harrier aint that strong due to the fact that it maneuverability is just trash,the thrust came out from some small ass nozzle that doesnt have after burner making the fuck lose speed quickly when maneuver,slow speed and slow climb rate,easy to get out maneuvered and out speed
creations-chat 2022-06-08 04:59:13 nah dont worry it just some stuff that is actually true just not 100% <:hahaa:773727260539617280> 
and yes i hate f22,shit too overrated and beside i'd rather have su to do some maneuver that if u do in f22 u gonna crash miserably
creations-chat 2022-06-08 05:01:30 i mean giving it the radar missle blah blah not the focking shape or it invisible paint cuz russia we aint need that and we already got flare to spam and the maneuverablity to out maneuver the missle <:hahaa:773727260539617280>,beside radar technology already very much got more sophisicated anyway
creations-chat 2022-06-08 05:03:44 yeah ik u cant just spam flare cuz shit u only got like a few of them before u eventully run out and even by the time u run out of flare the enemy can still shoot missle at u cuz *f u c k* ,but yeah u aint gonna spam for long,only able to use them for like a few time (less than 5) before u dead
creations-chat 2022-06-08 05:05:56 arent both have like wtf maneuverablity?

creations-chat 2022-06-30 13:12:05 uh ok,i dont really know much abt the Su,i thought only Su33 and other new Su have canard,not Su30 <:wait:652565313337950230>
creations-chat 2022-06-30 13:21:23 absolutely,where u at so i can call a therapy that good at making people wanna kill them self?
creations-chat 2022-06-30 13:23:43 **look like a Su**
until later on finishing the build it actually look fat than the original <:wait:652565313337950230> (just like mah tank almost finish until i realise that the hull is actually longer than the original and the turret suppose to be angle at 60 deg not 45)
creations-chat 2022-06-30 13:26:17 raid roblox headquarter,kidnap the CEO (which i dont remember the name),threaten to kill him if they dont allow us to see 90 deg from above,release him once they fixed it,get arrested,go in jail for 7 yr,come out just to see the game now died.that how u can improve ur build <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
creations-chat 2022-06-30 13:28:28 what,arent u want to see from 90deg above to be able to overlay and not make ur build fat than the original thus making it better?
creations-chat 2022-06-30 13:33:49 just do it man,the canard is too big
creations-chat 2022-06-30 13:36:23 .w.
creations-chat 2022-06-30 13:44:45 uh idk
creations-chat 2022-07-06 15:53:09 BOIS NEW A10 HAS JUST BEEN SPOTTED
creations-chat 2022-07-06 15:58:39 basicly missle tube at the front and the side supposedly torpedor tube,the cannon at the front should be 127mm in caliber,2 SeaRAM,4 ciws AA,2 support gun which i suppose its 2 auto cannon,oerlikon 30mm or some grenade thrower?
creations-chat 2022-07-06 16:01:13 can u kinda tell me what kind of weapon it using? like what cannon it using what missle it using what torpedor it using blah blah
creations-chat 2022-07-06 16:07:05 well yeah A-10 is overrated anyway,acceleration is no different than a turtle
creations-chat 2022-07-06 16:12:04 and those hole on the side of the ship are for torpedor i suppose?(torpedor normaly gonna get launched from the side,ship like IT caio dulio have it torp launched on the side) the gun tho,"navy gun" well if u say then ig it gonna be a 127mm since the size of the cannon is pretty big... the autocannon,hmn yeah might wanna remake it into smth like a oerlikon 30mm since it would be better :D and yes the current autocannon look goofy...
creations-chat 2022-07-06 16:15:58 might suggest u the oerlikon millenium,its anti air yes
creations-chat 2022-07-06 16:25:59 dunno the fuck to do and what to overhaul on this shit
creations-chat 2022-07-06 16:31:10 found the place that need to be improved,gunno do motorlock,at the time i built this ship(2020) i didnt really know much abt motorlock and didnt wanna try it either,it wasnt until like mid 2021 that i finally experiment with it and yeah just learned how to angle lock like month ago to use that on my oversized tank that i dont know why the fuck i event built as big as the whole plot <:hahaa:773727260539617280> (almost gotta restart it due to the plot limit)
creations-chat 2022-07-06 16:34:54 me meh im a bit lazy so yeah im just gonna use my newly learned knowledge to take that very same ship... and build it again or just delete like 50% of the ship keeping a certain part and then remake the part i deleted with motorlocking technique to make it better instead of goofy-like
creations-chat 2022-07-06 16:38:14 i cant make small thing but cant make big thing either,when i make small thing ima just overdo it and accidentally make it so small... that i cant even add any detail and when i make thing big ima accidentally make it so big that it just take up the entire slot and cost me like a whole week or even month to complete it due to it sheer size <:ElonSad:573361014112780303>

creations-chat 2022-08-12 14:30:38 oh no no,u not only need motorlock,u need to fix that whole thing,btw u new?
creations-chat 2022-08-12 14:33:37 u can watch tutorial,learn how to build from those vid,watching other people show casing,learning their building technique and when u reach a good level post later if u dont want to get absolutely burned alive by this whole sever
creations-chat 2022-08-12 14:35:46 another tip : if u building something just ask the sever,post in here and dont post in creation,people dont like seeing it filled with those stuff,what progess u got,just post in here and ask everyone opinion,which fucker rude to u just ignore and look at the actual tip people provide,from there improve ur skill over time,oh and u might wanna learn motorlocking as soon as possible since it is very cruicial
creations-chat 2022-08-12 14:41:06 u got knowledge on motorlock good but then ur building skill,**it not good**
creations-chat 2022-08-12 14:45:11 lmao same here
creations-chat 2022-08-12 14:54:43 hey chill,no need to be a fucking bi tch,he just a newbie

creations-chat 2022-08-12 15:35:05 imagine they allowing us to say thing like fuck or those racist word that saying 1 mean immediate ban but then when we say smth as little as shit we gonna get muted
the most epic system we will ever seen on the planet earth
creations-chat 2022-08-12 15:37:37 i mean like imagine if they make a system where the normal curse word are not allowed but racial thing are allowed to say,like hell,imagine the amount of the n-word gonna be said each day

plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:27:11 too sad it aint gonna exist
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:27:43 dunno

plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:29:36 tf-
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:29:47 i meant hide it in the body
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:29:49 like the fuck mate
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:29:59 the motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:30:12 ***bruv ur english***
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:30:39 ah
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:30:45 how
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:31:31 bruh
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:31:38 u use a heli from tutorial right?
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:31:53 yeah right fuck no wonder the helium block
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:32:01 fun fact : the helium block doesnt actually work
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:32:21 no like trust me,the moment u turn the rotor on all the helium purpose gonna be disappear
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:32:26 until u turn it off
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:32:32 it only happen to artificial rotor
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:32:37 which is the rotor that we build
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:32:41 and not the one the game provide
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:33:28 well u can place a small propeller on the top
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:33:35 i mean the one the game provide
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:33:53 due to how the game physic work the propeller gonna somewhat help balance the aircraft
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:33:59 not entirely but still helpful
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:34:26 basicly it just lift the top up while the main rotor create the actual lift
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:34:54 and ballast? trust me mate ballast aint making it balance much
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:35:35 ok.
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:35:45 the propeller,they help alot
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:36:06 trust me they help alot more than the helicum or ballashit]
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:36:50 i tested out before and yeah helium really only work for ground vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:37:10 ballast kinda work but it only making ur heli up and down up and down constantly instead of making it actually balance
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:37:31 helium magic gonna be gone 100% the moment u turn up ur heli rotor...
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:37:38 since it aint working
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:38:03 "the lion,the witch and the audacity of this bitch"
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:38:17 great fuck
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:38:28 wat i didnt even call u a bitch
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:38:36 ok
creations-chat 2022-09-06 16:38:55 ah yes the classic "404 error"
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:39:08 yeah im not kidding
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:39:17 artificial engine often just delete their use
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:39:22 and make them essentially a normal block
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:39:29 the moment u turn the engine on
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:39:44 if u turn the engine off or only using the engine the game provide then it work like normal
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:39:52 but with artifical engine well no.
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:40:22 tested it before and its actually true.
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:40:27 oh and the ballast
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:40:36 yes it balance the heli... except it only make it wobble up and down
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:40:50 yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:40:53 or ground vehicle
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:40:59 work great for thing like a B O A T
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:41:08 https://tenor.com/view/boating-dino-motor-gif-24573919
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:41:45 i dont really know how ima be able to make u belive me
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:41:50 but yeah it kinda hard to explain
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:42:12 last time tried the helium on my heli
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:42:17 and i notice that
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:42:21 when i turn on mah engine
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:42:25 the plane gonna stop floating up
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:42:32 and it just gonna fall back
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:42:40 which is the direction the helium is sitting at
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:42:46 but the moment i turn off the engine...
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:42:59 the shit immediately lighting mode into the sky
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:43:06 cuz of the fucking helium
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:43:16 it also fall down btw
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:43:22 anyway
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:43:43 https://tenor.com/view/beamed-by-sqtis-beamed-roblox-beamed-by-beamed-by-sq-gif-24968932
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:44:00 if u questioning anything just try and over use the helium block on ur heli
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:44:05 and u will see wtf im talking abt
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:44:19 m o a r attack angle
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:44:22 or more speed
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:44:24 or longer
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:44:27 blade
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:44:37 oh wait longer blade actually quite a bad idea
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:44:43 since it slower down ur rotor speed
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:44:49 oh
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:44:54 **i dont know**
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:45:07 perhap use the support of the propeller the game provide?
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:45:15 like those small liltte fuck
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:45:55 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:46:01 dont underestimate em
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:46:15 1 of those fucker at the either end can already make a different
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:46:25 that is if ur heli not so big...
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:46:41 OH MY FUCKING GO
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:46:50 WHAT WITH THESE CRINGEY ASS MAVERICK SHIT???
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:46:56 bruh lmao
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:47:06 i sees them everywhere
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:47:10 and they all just cringe
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:47:28 like remember last month when <#384025409945337856> floded with those "maverick was right" shit???
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:47:35 nah those are actually good and not so cringe
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:47:38 but the maverick one
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:48:48 talking abt building
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:48:54 yeah i just remember im building a tank
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:48:57 that started from april
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:48:59 but till now
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:49:07 it still hasnt done
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:49:31 still need to modify alot of thing and expect to need like what 20 more hour due to my trash and slow building???
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:50:19 well yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:51:19 it kinda funny how pc youtuber/builder when making tutorial only make tutorial for the minimal requirement build
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:51:32 and never ever they show a high quality tutorial build lmao
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:52:35 "alot of time" mate have u seen the build?
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:52:44 like rn i can throw my brain off and make the same one in what 10 min???
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:53:33 like dude those dont require much brain work
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:53:39 the one that actually require brain work is the motorlock one
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:54:26 lmao true
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:54:34 man
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:54:37 hope when my tank done
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:54:42 i aint gonna crash any sever
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:54:48 it fucking 3.7k block at this point
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:55:04 and no not like im building it without putting any actual effort in tryna make it look good
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:55:13 and if u ask then its the kranvagn
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:55:32 people say its ez but that is because they aint giving fuck abt the detail and mostly just make goofy ah looking shit
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:55:38 yeah.
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:56:09 fun fact : it took me 3 hour to figure out how ima do frontal pike nose for a tank.
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:56:17 and it actually simpler than u think
plane-crazy 2022-09-06 16:56:49 and my pc just dies

creations-chat 2022-09-13 14:47:24 dunno,perhap me and my skill issue ass who have problem with using block to create a certain angle or certain shape like pike nose of the is7???<:thconking:535171057649188865>
Like fr have u seen the current tank im making rn
creations-chat 2022-09-13 14:53:56 oh,so i can still apply the motorlocking into building?
creations-chat 2022-09-13 14:56:14 ay... welp ig ima need to spend another 40 hour remaking my tank in the game...
creations-chat 2022-09-13 15:02:13 fact : i spending what 15 hour making the turret alone due to my blind ass unable to see the block clear due to lighting and my skill issue ass having hard time working with the motorlock lmao? the hull take another 10 hour to do and it take me abt 2 hour to figure out how ima do the frontal pike nose and the rest yeah spend it to add more detail and till now,the current tank still missing wheel,the tank is uh kran 
<@733874167908401153> well i mean it look like it inspired by the k2 more than the embt
<@680542146054455325> sorry my dumbass just got really confused 🙃

creations-chat 2022-09-14 14:53:23 love how people keep saying their build is custom while in reality it actually look like they tried to build a specific vehicle but then manage to do wrong at some stuff and create a v e r y similar but different looking vehicle
creations-chat 2022-09-14 14:55:26 dont worry absolutely nothing wrong beside the look of the entire thing.

creations-chat 2022-10-02 15:17:28 meh there aint fix for that,best bet is just hold ur fold key even after it done folding for a few more sec before finally releasing it,also did u turn on motorlock?
btw u should kinda make a lock inside so that everytime ur ship done folding,u can just lock it

and the lock just make a simple folding mechanism,might try this on my ship
creations-chat 2022-10-02 15:27:38 uh there a way to make ur missle be able to launch without unanchoring i think,try put a motor under the disconnector or what ever that release the missle,the motor essentially gonna act as a border and make the anchor block dont count it + ur missle as smth belong to the whole part that it anchoring and essnetially allowing ur disconnector to freely work without having the anchoring trouble as long as it only connected with the motor instead of any block belong to the part that the anchor block anchoring.
creations-chat 2022-10-02 15:30:36 oh god thought i read that as ni-
