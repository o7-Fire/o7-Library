plane-crazy 2022-10-03 21:47:34 Oh yeah my friend built a b29 with crap wing connection. And with my really bad flak gun that's really hard to aim I managed to rip his wing clean off without hitting anything but the motor locking. Before he could bomb me
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 21:48:27 I have a 2 0lot long schwerer gustav
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 21:48:56 I use black to make it easier to see where I'm putting stuff whilst building
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 21:49:56 My biggest build is only 3k blocks. It's a schwerer gustav. My smallest build is a rescue boat at 58 blocks or smth
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 21:50:23 It looks like a draken
plane-crazy 2022-10-03 21:50:43 Damn

creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:42:47 And you are the reason people stop playing. You make them feel bad about their builds and  ot want to improve because they only get rude negative feedback. Maybe try being polite
creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:46:55 I said good enough not good. Good enough implies that there is room for improvement but it still isn't bad. And there's a difference between being rude and encouraging someone
creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:52:11 I did not give criticism because that build is better than a few of my builds so I have no room to speak. I was voicing my opinion in a way that implied there was still room for improvement. Being rude isn't criticism it's just disrespect. Now I'm gonna go do something productive instead of bullying whitenames because there build isn't what I am used to seeing
creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:54:14 Doesn't mean I can't actually be respectful and that I shouldn't notice and talk about someone being rude. This isn't worth arguing about anyway
creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:56:16 It is. Not between us though. You haven't done anything I just forgot I was replying to you specifically because I have a rough brain cell count of absolutely none

plane-crazy 2022-12-10 10:19:12 Add more suspension to make them tighter? Idk
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 10:19:26 I sent my dad this




Yeah it's called the YB-40 Flying Fortress, a modified version of the B17G Flying Fortress I think it was, removing the bomb bay and making room for a second turret and more ammunition. The YB-40 however flew at the same speeds as the other B17's when they were fully loaded but flew slowet when the other aircraft had dropped their payloads, leaving them to lag behind. This meant that the other B17's, either, had to slow down to continue flying alongside their modified cousins, or, leave them behind. The other bombers did have guns but not nearly as many as the YB-40, meaning that they could hold their own but not as well as if they had the YB-40's beside them. The YB-40's only flew ten missions in the August of 1943 before being replaced by the faster, more nimble P-51 Mustang B and D variants that were sent to Europe to fight and eventually help neutralize the Luftwaffe.

creations-chat 2023-03-10 20:33:07 A ro-scale A-10 should be 22.62 blocks long, 6.188 blocks tall and have  wingspan of 24.388 blocks.
creations-chat 2023-03-11 07:33:49 Were you in a game with axe earlier
creations-chat 2023-03-11 07:37:04 With an su-27
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 11:26:54 I did that to my friends b29. He had 1 locked motor holding the left wing on and I managed to hit it with my flak 88
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 11:27:33 I then couldn't replicate the shot though
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 11:27:52 And he added more hard points to the wings
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 22:17:05 I wouldn't say any f15 is easy
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 22:17:10 But it would be cool
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 22:19:29 The first blue prince is clearer and easier to see parts on
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 22:19:46 But if you use it in conjunction with a 3d model it will help a lot
plane-crazy 2023-03-11 22:20:09 ...

events-chat 2023-03-18 22:46:58 
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 22:47:47 I cant

plane-crazy 2023-03-18 22:48:22 But I have already done so much motorlocking
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 22:48:31 Hehe
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 22:50:29

https://imagecolorpicker.com/en
plane-crazy 2023-03-18 22:57:09 Np
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 00:08:52 Made some minor changes like an antenna on the port side wing and a navigation light on the starboard wing. As you can see it's pretty fast and it's turning is pretty good
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 00:09:38 Nice
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 00:10:02 And on the back you should have a half wedge down 1x2
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 00:10:30 It took 3-6 hours non stop building to make it lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 00:10:40 Oh
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 00:10:44 I didn't notice
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 00:11:22 The dorsal turret is nice
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 00:12:49 
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 00:13:14 Damn
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 00:13:37 I'm guessing it's just a rly long aileron
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 00:14:41 Yeh that's why I thought it was
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 00:16:23 Good idea
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 00:19:50 I don't even remember how to post on lock lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 00:54:04 Ok
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 00:54:07 Nice
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 02:19:35 Nice
plane-crazy 2023-03-19 03:52:32 Yeah I reckon that's bout right

plane-crazy 2023-03-19 04:33:02 Nice

creations-chat 2023-03-19 21:20:25 That's fucking sick
creations-chat 2023-03-19 21:22:32 What's wrong with its wings
creations-chat 2023-03-19 21:25:18 Can I get some feedback for how to improve my zero
plane-crazy 2023-03-20 04:31:50 That's what they want you to think. They're actually UFO's with their cloaking devices on
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 21:26:23 Why does the slide break?
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 21:27:38 The gap is too deep
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 21:29:14 Put springs in the grip that push ammo up and make it go into the firing chamber when the slide goes forward
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 21:30:44 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 21:30:49 That could work
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 21:31:10 Yeah but that's annoying
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 21:31:29 Suspension wouldn't work actually
plane-crazy 2023-03-22 21:31:49 It would force it to unload when you pull the slide back
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 21:20:01 Nice
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 21:20:13 How long is  stud though?
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 21:20:22 Because I want to calculate knots
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 21:20:37 Ok thanks
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 21:22:44 Ok so my A6M1 Zero goes 326.556 knots
plane-crazy 2023-03-23 21:27:04 Cute tamnk
creations-chat 2023-03-23 21:28:15 It might work and it looks pretty cool. Suspension wheels are kinda funky

plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:52:48 By who's standards
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:53:32 Well will you ever finish it

plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:54:19 But
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:54:25 Will it ever get finishes

plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:55:01 Ok
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:55:38 Well in the meantime I might have to dissect that image (not copy it) and try to build a good looking battleship
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:56:21 Nah the hull looks amazing
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:57:12 Am I right in thinking that the barrels for the guns are made of 2 2x2, and 3x3 cylinders
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:57:34 Well it looks good to me
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 07:59:13 What class/type?
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 08:01:23 Well it's definitely heavy
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 08:01:37 You have any tips for building large battleships
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 08:01:44 ?
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 08:03:17 I do that a ot lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 08:08:21 I'm thinking of building maybe a Bismarck or maybe a Yamato or some British battleship like the HMS Prince of Wales. When you say think of the blueprint what do you mean?
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 08:12:22 Ok
plane-crazy 2023-03-26 08:12:35 Well let's see how fast I quit

creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:45:41 Nope. The first one is obviously built by  less experienced player but the super hornet is fucking hot
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:07:12 <@402617794606399488> legacy hornet and super hornet really basically the same thing. Either way it's hot

the-dump 2023-04-06 05:28:19 Unless you get sand in them
the-dump 2023-04-06 05:28:50 They're like regular socks but big, thick and soft
the-dump 2023-04-06 05:29:09 The biggest I have go a little bit above my ankle

plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:35:25 Like the big July towers with multiple stages of angling?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:35:37 I don't need any more of that in my builds
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:35:54 Yeah I'm not using that

plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:36:56 I like angle locking rotary engines
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:37:16 What
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 04:37:54 This is one of my concept radial engines

plane-crazy 2023-04-08 05:47:27 F15s should be massive
creations-chat 2023-04-08 21:53:58 It's actually smoother than the real thing ngl. I think that the engines just need some looking at and then it's pretty damn hot
creations-chat 2023-04-08 21:56:01 Well it looks like an f22. So I thought it was lol
creations-chat 2023-04-09 01:07:27 How many upvotes does it take to get into hof?

plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:40:29 Or locked motor
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:40:35 I use pistons
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:40:47 U can use both
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:41:39 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:41:54 Well I might have to change to motors then
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:43:11 I reckon locked motors might just weigh less
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:43:18 Idk tho
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:43:35 Oh
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 05:43:42 Yes

plane-crazy 2023-04-09 09:38:13 Couldn't be me
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 09:38:29 Nah I genuinely enjoy it sometimes
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 09:38:48 No ik but most mobile players do
plane-crazy 2023-04-09 09:40:23 Kinda. But I'm mainly a mobile gamer (due to lack of a good pc. That issue has been resolved now I have a sick new laptop) and I usually played shooters so I'm used to high difficulty
creations-chat 2023-04-09 22:44:17 You can always tell if one of my builds is a tut or guide by the amount of motorlocking. If it has heaps of locking it's custom
creations-chat 2023-04-09 22:48:42 Yeah well I did use Namnam guides when I was less experienced but now I just look at a 3d model or some pics and over complicate the hell out of it

plane-crazy 2023-04-19 12:18:30 You can use trails with specific configurations in the engines I think. Ill find the settings but you have 2 of them, for me one a ran kinda colour and one purple
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 12:18:35 I think
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 12:25:10 The red is just to show the trails better
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 12:25:11 But that's the setup I use
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 12:28:12 Idk but I use the trail setup on my su27. When I use snow pipes it gives a strange effect like a smoke pipe I think
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 12:28:14 Hold on
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 12:33:03 This is what happens when u use snow pipes
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 12:40:41 I don't reckon he was using a snow pipe I reckon he had the trails behind it
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 12:48:46 Bro what is ur pfp

plane-crazy 2023-04-19 12:50:38 You can see the snow pipe but snow pipes don't give that effect
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 12:51:50 Because I was just curious
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 12:51:57 That's all you need to know
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 12:52:16 But it's killed this one
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 12:53:10 Ur pfp looked like if I ate it it would taste like blue radpberry
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 12:53:18 How?
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 12:53:58 Snow pipes don't look like that. Or at least idk how to make them
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 12:55:06 I don't think I do
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 12:57:44 Yeah nvm I do
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 12:57:56 I just didn't mess around with the settings enough lol

creations-chat 2023-04-28 21:48:36 I think you underestimate the size of jets
creations-chat 2023-04-28 21:51:58 Since when did I underestimate you?
creations-chat 2023-04-28 21:56:29 Yeah never mind they are 2 blocks wide. Roughly. The measurements of just the fuselage are hard to find but I found an approximate measurement and did the conversions and calculations and its about 1.88 blocks wide
creations-chat 2023-04-28 23:34:01 That's cool
creations-chat 2023-04-28 23:36:37 Yeah. 1.8844 because the fuselage is roughly 4ft 5in
creations-chat 2023-04-28 23:39:16 Wide that is
creations-chat 2023-04-28 23:41:27 How did u do it? 

Also <@407347404858458123> how would you do thatm

<@407347404858458123> I'll find a version on yt and see how to make my own
creations-chat 2023-04-28 23:50:43 Because I reckon a lot of people don't know how
creations-chat 2023-04-28 23:55:03 Yeah but a lot of people don't know how to use them to do stuff like that

plane-crazy 2023-05-25 08:45:28 Why does the bottom of the fuselage angle down
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 08:46:10 Oh... Nvm then
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 08:47:59 The colours for the hull are a bit bright and it would look better  if the front was angled (not necessarily with angle lock) but apart from that it's not bad
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 08:48:58 Yeah
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 08:51:04 It's when you use powered and locked motors (both options in one motor) to angle parts
plane-crazy 2023-05-25 08:51:15 I would recommend watching tutorials

Not bad but the engines look a lil funky. If u want I could teach you how to make some better ones (I'mma do some testing first so that I don't waste ur time. That's even if u want to)
creations-chat 2023-06-16 05:46:59 I'm building a smaller corsair and I'm using angle locking to make a nice engine
creations-chat 2023-06-16 05:49:10 I learnt it pretty early. It's really not hard. If u need help I would recommend yt tutorials or someday if u want I might be able to teach u
creations-chat 2023-06-16 05:54:57 I will when I get home

plane-crazy 2023-06-17 05:33:12 Didnt even work as a concept
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 05:33:55 I think it looks kinda cool
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 05:34:00 The real thing that is
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 05:34:56 And they wouldn't have worked
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 05:35:05 It would be been too heavy and big
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 05:35:28 And the engine for turret traverse would've been too big on its own
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 05:37:29 Learn motor lock and angle lock. Even just basic motor lock will be useful. But most of all I recommend you start with smaller builds and experiment with the different blocks you can use for shaping
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 05:37:58 No
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 05:38:08 Even the Maus didn't make much sense
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 05:38:33 It's kinda badass ngl
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 05:38:57 Imagine seeing it roll up to ur trench slowly knowing you can't destroy it
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 05:39:03 That wasn't the reality

creations-chat 2023-06-29 21:23:52 I recommend that for  the shape you go onto sketch fab and search for a 3d model. You don't have to buy it but just view it (they're free to view)
