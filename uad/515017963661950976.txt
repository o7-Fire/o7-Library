creations-chat 2021-06-08 23:02:17 Does anyone know why nobody makes f22s?
creations-chat 2022-07-22 21:47:06 I know this is random, but should i buy a miniature replica of an f/a-18 super hornet or an av-8b harrier?
creations-chat 2022-07-22 21:52:00 the f-18 has more parts but it costs more
general 2022-09-08 23:21:22 can someone tell me why everyone hates the F-35?
general 2022-09-08 23:22:33 it's pog
general 2022-09-08 23:23:44 explain
general 2022-09-08 23:24:08 ok can you explain other than insulting yourself
general 2022-09-08 23:25:13 *how is it a bad plane*
general 2022-09-08 23:25:43 it's a bad plane because it's a bad plane - yousuf
general 2022-09-08 23:26:20 but you provide no explanation <:wheeze:812696497719083041>
general 2022-09-08 23:28:49 The F-35 is invisible from radar and maneuverability isn't an issue considering it can lock missiles onto targets without even having it's nose face it
general 2022-09-08 23:29:17 omg, good point
general 2022-09-08 23:29:53 not a multirole fighter sooo...
general 2022-09-08 23:30:15 for **everything**
general 2022-09-08 23:30:27 air superiority fighter
general 2022-09-08 23:31:13 k, every jet can do that. An F-15 does strike missions but it doesn't have an "A" in it's name
general 2022-09-08 23:32:36 An F-35A is so cheap rn, I might pick one up
general 2022-09-08 23:32:43 70 million USD
general 2022-09-08 23:33:07 and eurofighters are 120 😭
general 2022-09-08 23:34:14 yeah they should've named it the F/AV-35
general 2022-09-08 23:34:18 but that's too long
general 2022-09-08 23:34:36 that's the F-35B, the one with the hover fans
general 2022-09-08 23:35:44 ok idk why the cost of an F-35 varies between sources, some say 100 million, some say 70 million
general 2022-09-08 23:37:06 110 million is still cheap for a 5th gen fighter regardless
general 2022-09-08 23:38:23 which fighter
general 2022-09-08 23:39:10 let's be honest. F-35 good. F-22 god tier
general 2022-09-08 23:39:51 idk why it says 335 million for an f-22...
general 2022-09-08 23:40:14 fr
general 2022-09-08 23:40:36 as much as I like A-10s they are only good when there are no enemy air defense systems
general 2022-09-08 23:40:54 yeah
general 2022-09-08 23:42:17 <a:e_lookaround:875211665124233257>
general 2022-09-08 23:42:25 i'd like to forget about those
general 2022-09-08 23:42:32 friendly fire incidents
general 2022-09-08 23:45:07 but it's in the name
general 2022-09-08 23:46:20 <:kekR:837122427514912788>
general 2022-09-08 23:48:48 a-10s are so insane that they can maneuver in space kekw
general 2022-09-08 23:49:01 aerospace attack craft
general 2022-09-08 23:50:15 straight up put a hyperdrive on an a-10
general 2022-09-08 23:52:27 emb fail
general 2022-09-08 23:52:36 chill
general 2022-09-09 00:00:21 pog
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 02:03:15 minus the fact that can somehow lock on an F-22 and F-35
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 02:03:29 and that game is just riddled with Su users
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 02:12:25 yeah true
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 02:23:00 can you make a fursuit
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 02:23:32 i love that app

plane-crazy 2022-09-09 02:24:59 draw with this, then screenshoot your work
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 02:25:48 sukhoi fans when the find out Su-57 exists <:sadge:812695384198873108>
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 02:26:00 i don't know what that is
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 02:26:53 have you heard of Midjourney, <@696851246325432321>
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 02:27:12 it's a bot that draws what ever you describe
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 02:27:26 i have it, just give me a prompt and i'll send it here
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 02:27:45 prompt example: "donald trump eating a salad"
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 02:29:21 lol
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 02:29:31 anchor ftw
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 02:38:30 <@696851246325432321> this is what i made using Midjourney
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 02:38:42 well i didn't really "make it" cause it was a bot that drew it
creations-chat 2022-09-09 05:03:11 it looks incredible
general 2022-09-09 05:12:15 This will be the main jet in Top Gun 3
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 05:58:03 this is so based, this lego-competitor made a Ghost of Kyiv set
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 05:59:21 not released yet
plane-crazy 2022-09-09 06:01:48 tbh they're cheaper than lego if they ever got into military

general 2022-09-16 06:15:56 Bro wtf, a Rafale fighter costs almost $200 million <:kekR:837122427514912788>

general 2023-01-02 01:41:44 there are far worse groups you should be concerned about
general 2023-01-02 01:42:32 there's this one group that enjoys 18+ airplane material
general 2023-01-02 01:42:41 they're called aeromorphs
general 2023-01-02 01:42:49 don't ask

general 2023-01-02 01:49:20 and plate carriers of course
general 2023-01-02 01:49:39 im canadian. we recently banned airsoft guns what do you think lol
general 2023-01-02 01:50:54 In all seriousness, they create disney characters as "personas" and draw art of each other. the 18+ degeneracy crap is done by a rogue branch
