help 2020-05-28 09:52:56 Can someone try to explain me why elevators of my Fenrir (Both, front and rear) keep jamming like this?
help 2020-05-28 09:55:09 Also only right side elevators can unjam, I didn't manage to unjam left side. But after respawn both side elevators jam in this position again
help 2020-05-28 10:15:19 Ok, give me a while
help 2020-05-28 10:16:02 
help 2020-05-28 10:18:02 What about front delta that used to keep rear elevator 'assembled'?
help 2020-05-28 10:18:43 I tried to remove some deltas and it jammed again
help 2020-05-28 10:19:10 That's okay
help 2020-05-28 10:19:20 I scrapped one plane because of this already
help 2020-05-28 10:19:38 Weirdly, during testing while building this didn't happen
help 2020-05-28 10:21:13 Where exactly?
help 2020-05-28 10:21:30 I also probably managed to fix rear elevators
help 2020-05-28 10:22:07 Front elevators
help 2020-05-28 10:22:40 5 deg. max angle, 3 speed, 100 torq.
help 2020-05-28 10:23:04 Yup
help 2020-05-28 10:24:44 Normal motor can't follow mouse unnlike Motor 2 :/
help 2020-05-28 10:25:04 That's the front elevators by the way
help 2020-05-28 10:27:34 Right after loading
help 2020-05-28 10:28:10 Setting torq of front elevators on 10 seem to help a bit, going to try respawning on order to check if it one-time fix or permanent
help 2020-05-28 10:30:03 Main wings connected to entire hull, if I want to disconnect them then I have to rebuild sides of hull
help 2020-05-28 10:30:36 Also I set torq of rear elevators on 10 and it seem to help as well
help 2020-05-28 10:32:38 No no, I think I solved problem already, I had to set torq on 10 for both elevators
