creations-chat 2021-06-15 13:55:11 its 2 motors rubbing up on the body of it which causes a bunch of shaking
creations-chat 2021-06-15 13:58:51 this is build mode, pretty cramped in there
creations-chat 2021-06-15 14:22:01 I actually have lol, it vibrates, but not much idk what else i could do to amplify vibration

i do but they dont move around since theres no space
they just hit the inside and the torque they have causes it to shake a tiny bit
creations-chat 2021-06-15 14:24:48 that could work, is it just 2 servos facing eachother?
creations-chat 2021-06-15 14:30:19 you can build whatever, maybe just not put it in creations for upvotes

help 2021-06-17 20:21:02 is roblos fix
help 2021-06-17 20:21:27 motor
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:14:34 I calculated mach 1 in the game as just a tiny bit under 4k sps
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:14:42 because walking speed is 16 sps
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:15:26 what would it be in sps realistically then
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:16:12 how did you calculate that
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:16:24 Height of the character?
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:17:23 5 studs = 1.77m
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:17:42 5 studs (player height) = 1.77 (irl avg height)
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:17:54 speed of sound is 343 m/s
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:18:02 uhmmm
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:18:28 agh what do i have to do again'
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:18:34 oh
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:18:35 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:18:41 343 / 1.77
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:19:03 that * 5
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:19:17 mach one is 968.92 sps
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:19:23 <@!749835829039464549>
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:19:42 close enough to your answer
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:20:12 No
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:20:28 1 stud does not equal one foot
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:20:46 if we assume the height of 5 studs for roblox character is average height of 1.77m
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:20:58 then the character is 1.77 m tall
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:21:08 so 5 studs = 1.77m
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:21:32 because it would be the most likely height for a character
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:21:34 YEAH
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:21:40 and your character is 5 studs tall
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:21:48 assuming your character is average human height
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:21:59 
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:22:14 lets go off of bacon hair then
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:22:52 
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:23:02 5 studs tall
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:23:10 get your fax straight
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:23:14 Yeah ik
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:23:18 each block is 2.5 stud
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:23:22 so 5 studs total???
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:23:41 wat
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:23:55 what are you on about
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:24:07 roblox is scaled down
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:24:10 by alot
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:24:23 what is an eva
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:24:55 well do you agree with my calculation now
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:24:56 or
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:25:09 ok cool no more internet trolling
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:25:42 ??
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:25:49 we werent arguing anyway
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:25:59 just trying to get a good calculation over mach 1
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:26:51 what
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:26:56 no
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:27:17 no
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:27:34 2.5 what
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:27:49 look
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:27:52 in my calculations
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:27:59 I assume regular ol bacon hair
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:28:02 is your avg human being
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:28:07 meaning bacon hair
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:28:10 is 1.77m tall
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:28:13 avg height
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:28:22 but he also is 5 studs tall
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:28:28 so 5 studs = 1.77m
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:29:09 Well if youre going off of the actual roblox size
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:29:13 mach one is insanely fast
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:29:23 because roblox is like mini toys
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:30:06 Before we say what mach 1 is
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:30:15 we have to find out correct length of 1 stud
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:30:25 In my case
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:30:31 i assume bacon hair is average human
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:30:36 why is that a bad assumption
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:30:48 it would be more realistic than the toy scale that roblox is set in
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:31:16 ok
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:31:23 then your answer would be very close to mine
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:31:41 1.8 m
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:31:46 for character height
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:32:21 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:32:47 like i said, it is extremely close to my answer
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:32:58 h
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:33:18 2 of us now have the correct answer  😎
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:33:21 shatap
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:33:26 1 stud is 36 cm
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:34:05 yeah but the character is just 180 cm
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:34:21 bacon hairs are dwarves?
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:34:30 why
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:35:09 I consider bacon hair as an adult
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:35:56 If youre playing some tactical war game
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:36:02 wouldnt consider yourself a child lol
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:37:56 Average human
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:38:04 average roblox character
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:38:14 i do not
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:39:14 at 1k sps 😎
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:39:53 what the hell no
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:41:04 5k is unreasonable for any plane without motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:41:19 5k is unreasonable anyway
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:41:30 you go across the map in 2 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-06-17 21:42:30 you should delete it

plane-crazy 2021-07-16 23:16:54 Well whatever i guess im never going to find out
plane-crazy 2021-07-16 23:17:09 but if i put max drag will it make my hover engines go faster

plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:49:26 if you dont want to build any realistic or complex sort of suspension i came up with this small thing
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:49:27 
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:49:51 Sometimes the piston goes through the half block but it works alright especially for small builds
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:50:00 It kinda is a shock absorber
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:50:33 but i have it disconnected from the block because the suspension extends faster than the piston meaning it takes less time for the wheel to return to the ground if it goes up
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:51:04 basically this design holds the wheel inbetween where it can shorten and lengthen

plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:55:13 my suspension
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:55:26 its really stable because of the piston
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:55:27 no bouncing
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:56:12 i have it on my only tank let me try and get a recording
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:57:58 i try to make the length to be just under the length of the suspension
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:58:05 like in here
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:58:32 And i use quite a bit of force because it also reinforces it on big bumps like the railroad
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:59:10 I already got rid of it but i think i had my suspension on 5 length, piston on 3
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 19:59:29 all the stiffness and max force is based on how heavy your build is obviously
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 20:00:34 yeah something like that if your build is small i would use like 500 force
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 20:01:06 i generally have the suspension set to a low stiffness (50 or so) to reduce the bounciness
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 20:05:01 https://streamable.com/smqa72
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 20:06:01 i love watching the suspension on the rock part lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 20:06:04 so smooth
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 20:06:23 it is infact that tank

plane-crazy 2021-08-17 20:09:50 no unfortunately
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 20:10:11 i built that like a month or two before the contest
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 20:10:33 was my first and only tank
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 20:10:39 i dont really use it that much
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 20:27:05 Am i the only one who finds suspension to be ungodly satisfying
plane-crazy 2021-08-17 20:27:40 car or plane or what

plane-crazy 2021-08-18 00:08:44 "its super fast for its size!1!!!! it goes 400!!!!!!!1"
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 00:08:55 "glitchless"
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 00:19:15 lol dude said my plane uses glitches (motor lock) therefore making its speed meaningless even though motorlock doesnt affect the speed
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 00:19:42 that would be a pretty sad tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-08-18 00:20:25 honestly delete it before 20 other people berate you for how bad it is

help 2021-08-25 23:29:23 youre rotating the axle and not the individual wheels you can turn better and have a bigger angle if you put the servos closer to the wheel
help 2021-08-25 23:29:43 make it stiffer
help 2021-08-25 23:30:42 you need to counter the weight of the wheel on the other side of the servo because motor 2s are weaker than a toothpick

help 2021-09-06 18:47:29 Let me calculate rq
help 2021-09-06 18:48:13 Earlier i did a calculation where 952 sps = mach 1
help 2021-09-06 18:48:28 and mach 1 is equal to 667 knots
help 2021-09-06 18:48:38 so uhmm
help 2021-09-06 18:48:51 952 sps = 667 knots i forget how to do math for that
help 2021-09-06 18:49:08 Oh
help 2021-09-06 18:49:12 667/952
help 2021-09-06 18:49:17 which is 0.7
help 2021-09-06 18:49:25 so for 0.7 sps you get 1 knot i think
help 2021-09-06 18:49:35 or is it the other way around
help 2021-09-06 18:51:06 <@!791976765123592233> actually it was other way round
help 2021-09-06 18:51:11 1 sps = 0.7 knot
creations-chat 2021-09-07 10:06:37 <@702907851001167882> i talked about the scale and speed of sound in this game before, you can look up my messages in <#384021699466756107> containing mach

If you assume the height is 180cm then mach 1 is 952 sps and you can pretty much convert anything using that metric and blocks are 90 cm tall

creations-chat 2021-11-11 22:57:42 well for some reason it has negative votes
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:02:39 Yes it could be a little bit longer tho i agree

i would have to redo a lot of motor folds

i think why your edit looks so off is because i took the sc from the cockpit and that gives it a bit of an angle

creations-chat 2021-12-03 21:46:37 Im not really sure how i should go about fixing that, control surfaces are for the great maneuvrability but i could change that up for a screenshot ig

closer to what

why closer to the nose that would look very weird

ok you know what mine can actually compete with it but still lol
creations-chat 2021-12-03 22:03:31 my biggest goal for this plane was to try and get the angles right and i think i did pretty well

i use them to fly bruh if i post it in creations i will use reg
creations-chat 2021-12-03 22:06:16 Yeah with all the angle locking overlapping non angled stuff i could not make it

I lose a great deal of maneuvrability with any added wing panels and theres no way i would fly with doubled up wings unfortunately

creations-chat 2021-12-27 21:17:00 I forgot to move the circle

I dont see whats necessarily wrong about it tho
i know it looks kinda noobish but I dont know what i could change to fix it

I would argue i used more effort than a 5 year old tho, theres an angle lock, plenty of repositioning to make the wings in the right spots, and no exposed motor lock

plane-crazy 2022-02-25 22:54:07 lol it goes a little quicker when it explodes
help 2022-02-26 00:54:40 i think the issue is because the main rotor is not aligned properly with the center of mass of the heli so when you try to lift from the rotor it rotates the heli
help 2022-02-26 00:55:14 so try altering with ballasts
help 2022-02-26 00:56:04 if it tilts up when you lift then your center of mass needs to be more forward

yeah i do agree about the thick grey part i just dont know what other blocks to use to make it still look like a ring

ik about the slanted wings

but i dont see whats wrong with the nose tho
creations-chat 2022-03-07 20:00:27 
creations-chat 2022-03-07 20:03:00 tf is that


no im not sure how to yet

creations-chat 2022-03-07 20:19:53 You guys set really high standards for people who havent played the game half as long as you, thats why

high standards make people quit lol
creations-chat 2022-03-07 20:27:33 Well, if you think about it this way, *upvotes* increases a person's motivation to build more stuff, not downvotes, and while i appreciate all the feedback, i still feel like a lot a people simply dont have empathy for newer players and think we can just magically jump to the most hyper detailed builds - if you vote on a build not based on how you think you could do it but by how well the person did it for their perceived skill and also telling them how to improve it i think it would be a lot better


well not really what im saying but its just nice to work really hard on something and have it be justified by upvotes
i never said the sole reason to build was to post in creations, literally almost all my builds never go there

no i meant as a mono engine this was my only plane comparable in size
there are 2 motors for each engine
it will create countertorque as a mono engine tho so youd have to deal with that but not too bad

You got the house layout completely wrong (no porch, weird tumor looking sections) looks like you used default colors (way too neon) and some of the colors were wrong anyway (the roof is not black) you could have hid all the mechanisms inside theres plenty of space

Bro youre the one who said "have you ever seen up" if youve seen up then you know the house looks nothing like that and its the wrong image but thats just a dumb lie

took quite awhile to design a prop that didnt rip itself apart
creations-chat 2022-11-04 21:33:30 If the prop spins too fast, the hover drives that power it break because of the centrifugal force
(the motor head flies off and then theres nothing to hover off of so the engine stops)

yeah i can control the pitch of the blades and have a throttle
creations-chat 2022-11-04 21:39:38 it also self rights so thats a bonus

nah if you set hover engines with drag it does it by itself nothing complicated

creations-chat 2022-11-11 14:31:49 quick sketch
Red is the motor (do you know how to set it up?)
Blue is motorlock tower
Also make sure there are springs so you can set the angle before locking

idk probably just the shape, also the exposed motors and cannons, I cant really tell from the image but it looks like the back is lacking details
creations-chat 2022-11-15 18:10:15 I concur
creations-chat 2022-11-19 02:29:52 thats pretty cool make the nose and sides  a little less rough
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:08:48 where are the intakes to provide necessary oxygen to the engine for combustion?
creations-chat 2022-11-20 01:13:48 ah well besides that I think you could have added more detail to the back, the spine is also flat I think it would look nice as a gradual slope from the canopy to the back
perhaps angled rudders would look cool too
creations-chat 2022-11-20 16:59:57 <@719624954542293073> really good ship mustve taken months with all that custom angle lock

creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:06:00 it doesnt even have to be too much, i usually do only a range of like 10 on the RGB thing

Plane Crazy has died. Everyone secretly thought it would happen, but never like this. No players remain online. The only sign of life occuring when both SR_B3N6828 and themorfix45 join to compare the same 15 builds and techniques back and forth with each other. Occasionally a new player will join this once populated game, exploring the different mechanics and available blocks, wondering where it all went wrong. Rickje139 has not been seen or heard from since 2022, only sometimes updating his Discord status to "working hard on Plane Crazy update".  Who would've thought it would come to this. Everyone joked, sure, but it is all too real when it actually happens. Slowly and silently, Plane Crazy drifts to the backpages of Roblox. New generations of building games enjoy golden eras, completely oblivious to what once was.

bug-reports 2022-12-01 16:53:24 Idk if this bug is known but it seems that some people in <#498473314445033472> can't see other people's messages, thus explaining why everyone always reports the same thing 🤔

creations-chat 2022-12-01 19:34:12 Bro got gull wings
creations-chat 2022-12-01 20:07:13 like what is the point of motorlocking if youre going to leave that fart hanging off the wing
creations-chat 2022-12-02 14:34:01 Super blocky, control surfaces look weird on the inside of the wing and theyre all square, canopy was made lazily
Way too flat too
creations-chat 2022-12-02 14:43:24 Also what is this💀
creations-chat 2022-12-02 14:56:18 Plane crazy players when angle lock and half wedges exist
creations-chat 2022-12-02 15:00:50 What im saying is that they could use more than just full triangle and wedgeblocks to make it smoother
creations-chat 2022-12-02 16:49:20 You do
creations-chat 2022-12-02 20:14:38 Well yeah but the b21 is still more round and smooth than that
creations-chat 2022-12-04 03:30:27 <@605240652413796352> putting 100x sharpen filter on a build does not increase its worth, rookie mistake

creations-chat 2022-12-12 22:57:01 Any feedback? This is a skyraider that is only powered through the propellor (hence why its gigantic)
 I will be adding more details but the fuselage and landing gear are done
posting 2nd pic in a minute forgor
creations-chat 2022-12-12 22:59:14 
creations-chat 2022-12-12 23:12:50 Yea because I wanted to make a build that was only powered through the prop so it had to be giant to get it off the ground
general 2022-12-13 16:50:27 I dont downvote everything and that is a wip mostly focused on functionality
Because you havent seen it fly at all
general 2022-12-13 16:51:43 Lmao no i didnt
general 2022-12-13 16:51:56 Its hovers
general 2022-12-13 16:52:52 The problem with the prop is that if i spin it too fast the motors fling out and break the hover drives
general 2022-12-13 16:53:01 So that is why i had to make it fat
general 2022-12-13 16:53:08 To make ot spin slower but have more torque
