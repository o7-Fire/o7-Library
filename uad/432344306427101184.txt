help 2020-05-02 23:45:16 
help 2020-05-02 23:45:19 same amount on the other side
help 2020-05-02 23:45:25 oof.
help 2020-05-02 23:45:44 from testing I found that if its over 200 mph it will well, fly
help 2020-05-02 23:45:46 guess
help 2020-05-02 23:45:49 i waas wrong
creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:53:16 what
creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:53:16 bruh
creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:53:19 is that
creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:53:50 blackhole bomb. it works just lika a real blackhole with some physics and magnet testing. it can also collapse lol
creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:54:18 when it collapses
creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:54:19 like
creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:54:25 all
creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:54:26 hell
creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:54:28 breaks loose
creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:57:24 
creations-chat 2020-05-06 18:57:26 it now glows
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:55:24 im working on a mech currently and its already 1800 blocks and tis just for the head
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:55:49 cool.
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:56:02 yeah i found a way to make mechs that isnt dumb
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:56:16 powered motor mechs i found to be slow and difficult
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:56:31 so i found a way after someone suggested it to make a mech with only unpowered motors
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:56:49 basically i made the knee joint move and then suspension n stuff to act as bracers and sort of "muscles"
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:56:51 and boom.
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:57:08 oh yeah you also put helium in the torso
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:57:12 so it keeps it up
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:57:20 and you use wing panels for stabilizing
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:57:23 its difficult af.
creations-chat 2020-05-06 20:57:54 because instead of normally building the skeleton of your mech and then everything around it, with this you have to build the shell first and then the skeleton
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:01:12 oof.
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:02:03 yeah ive made 8 mechs, 4 were like mini-mechs
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:03:03 its gunnna require the legs to be in a sitting position and the arms to be folded in half
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:03:07 i can send a screen-shot
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:03:49 
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:03:59 That large
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:04:01 aack
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:04:17 Its also to be faithful to the original source materials tis from,
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:04:22 so it has to be able to be deployed
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:04:23 via water
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:04:28 and via helicoptor
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:04:34 so im gunna have to make tiny helicoptors
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:04:35 thanks
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:06:16 Yeah Im aware.
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:06:26 Unlike other mechs in pacific rim its in the chest.
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:06:34 For now theres nothing functional
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:06:47 its all normal blocks and 2 unused motors for decoration
creations-chat 2020-05-06 21:07:07 I'm going to begin work on the legs, then the arms and then the every so painful technical stuff
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 21:15:10 and here we have an example of someone who is new to mechs and decided to make a big one and rocket spammed for movement and made an incredibly clumsy mech
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 21:15:27 that was my ted talk

bug-reports 2020-05-06 21:17:15 and it for some reason sends you so fast past the killzone that the script that does it doesnt have to to well

-Set up actual walking.
-Special effects.
-Arm turning allowing for more mobility.
-Finally, switching from slow pistons to a different mechanism that shoots the fists out for punching like in actual pacific rim.

creations-chat 2020-05-17 04:38:38 <@!479661943901388801> the shape is really impractical and an easy target if you where behind them
creations-chat 2020-05-17 04:38:41 The coloration is poor also
creations-chat 2020-05-17 04:39:16 As using either brighter colors or using constrasting colors makes it harder to find you
creations-chat 2020-05-17 04:39:19 It’s impractical
creations-chat 2020-05-17 04:39:24 The back can be made much thinner
creations-chat 2020-05-17 04:39:29 It’s too easy a target
creations-chat 2020-05-17 04:39:48 If I used my vulture fighter it would’ve been dead from my rocket bombing

plane-crazy 2020-07-11 20:29:18 I once saw someone make a giant space ship, and they did the folding with pistons and I wanted to cry because first off it’s so hard and stupid for what could be easier, and it tanks the game due to the amount of pistons

plane-crazy 2020-07-11 21:20:56 I like how people say build and destroy is better but we innovate and they use generic poopy complex default parts
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 21:21:05 I hate build n destroy :/
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 21:21:10 it’s so easy to make tanks
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 21:21:27 And they can make tiny stupid tanks
plane-crazy 2020-07-11 21:22:28 Even with motor lock there’s only a certain limit that can be used for tiny builds

general 2020-07-13 13:44:59 Phantom forced gae and boring
general 2020-07-13 13:45:32 I quit it
general 2020-07-13 13:45:46 It got boring and repetitive since I’m such a high level and have most guns unlocked
general 2020-07-13 13:46:07 I think the level I was at was 106
general 2020-07-13 13:46:31 That and phantom forces became a breeding ground for exploiters which was fun
general 2020-07-13 13:47:09 And then you have the kids screaming at you for using BFG/M107 or any high level sniper
general 2020-07-13 13:47:29 It’s gotten so bad that I purposely use the BFG to piss people off

general 2020-07-13 13:48:54 Idk the details
general 2020-07-13 13:49:07 I just went on and it happened to start spinning
general 2020-07-13 13:49:16 And I think where it takes you is where you get the melee
general 2020-07-13 13:49:47 It’s as broken as Karambit and you can dash into people and backstab them
general 2020-07-13 13:50:08 It’s my favourite thing to do, run up to people and dash/slide through then
general 2020-07-13 13:50:11 And get that backstab
general 2020-07-13 13:50:31 <@!615876745710534676> it’s reaper but as broken as the karambit

plane-crazy 2020-08-03 19:29:03 not bad for a plane
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 19:29:10 it could use more smoother edges
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 19:29:15 and the front seems a little too blunt
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 19:29:21 (unless its designed like that)
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 19:29:56 the propellers seem outta scale with the body and the front of the plane seems too short once again
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 19:29:58 but overall
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 19:30:04 pretty good compared to the other stuff out there

general 2020-08-18 06:06:23 (If you do your a legend)
general 2020-08-18 06:07:28 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=o-L0_TJ4i-o
general 2020-08-18 06:07:30 That’s carrion
general 2020-08-18 06:07:33 Warning it’s horror
general 2020-08-18 06:07:52 I think I’ve given many children on plane crazy literal nightmares
general 2020-08-18 06:08:18 The thing has nothing on carrion nor is it as grotesque
general 2020-08-18 06:08:34 Legit the thing is just a shape shifting monster-
general 2020-08-18 06:08:35 I have
general 2020-08-18 06:09:13 Dude carrion is much scarier, legit imagine seeing a giant writhering equivalent of the wall of flesh from terraria chasing you down a dark hallway
general 2020-08-18 06:09:36 that doesn’t say anything
general 2020-08-18 06:10:34 I suppose but the thing is more jumpscare based
general 2020-08-18 06:10:39 I don’t like jumpscares :T
general 2020-08-18 06:10:48 Not like they bother me
general 2020-08-18 06:10:50 They’re angling
general 2020-08-18 06:10:53 annoying*

general 2020-08-18 06:11:06 Fuck
general 2020-08-18 06:11:06 not horror
general 2020-08-18 06:11:09 Terror*
general 2020-08-18 06:11:20 Terror is prolonged fear and playing with ones mind
general 2020-08-18 06:11:23 I love terror
general 2020-08-18 06:11:30 it gets my heart going
general 2020-08-18 06:11:37 Aliens, the original did it best
general 2020-08-18 06:11:48 though I can name a few others
general 2020-08-18 06:12:07 <@456226577798135808> stfu this is general we’re talking about horror and posting about it
general 2020-08-18 06:12:53 tfw you watched pet cemetery as a kid and looked at your orange cat with uncertainty for a week
general 2020-08-18 06:13:32 Game design I guess
general 2020-08-18 06:14:00 carrion if you weren’t playing AS it would be much more terrifying since it’s not under your power
general 2020-08-18 06:14:04 Horror/terror
general 2020-08-18 06:14:22 Y e s
general 2020-08-18 06:14:42 Now that would be more terrifying than the thing
general 2020-08-18 06:14:55 Who’s played uh song of horror?
general 2020-08-18 06:15:09 The AI in that game is so scarringly complex
general 2020-08-18 06:15:20 It legit adapts to your specific play style to get you

bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:21:29 idk if it shows it
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:21:32 but the pistons wig out
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:21:38 
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:21:39 and sometimes it does this
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:21:40 and just
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:21:43 kills everything
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:22:13 and its killing my mech because i NEED the poseability for fighting and i cant exactly fight properly if i cant even reach my own chest..
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:23:10 idfk if this has anything to do with it but it popped up in the dev console
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:23:12

plane-crazy 2020-09-06 02:23:59 
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 02:24:00 heres cherno alpha
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 02:24:06 im finishing the arms
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 02:24:14 
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 02:24:24 probably either tomorrow or tonight
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 02:24:30 
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 02:24:35 
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 02:24:40 its like 1:5 scale
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:25:07 it didnt happen on my other giant mech
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:25:09 and only this one
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:25:16 and it only started happening recently
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:25:26 when it was just a small part of the arm it worked fine
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:26:01 and decreasing weight SHOULD have no affect since it isnt the arm itself being buggy, its bugging out the fold ontop and the pistons inside
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:26:10 
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:26:12 this is how its folded
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:26:13 so

bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:41:41 you also jump over and over when spawning in a new server
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:41:58 though some people still can
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:42:00 oddly
bug-reports 2020-09-06 02:44:27 its litterally impossible to play pvp

plane-crazy 2020-09-06 18:28:59 hence why hes the heaviest yaeger
plane-crazy 2020-09-06 18:29:30 well you gotta remember he was built back when the biggest yaegers were category 1-3

creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:19:34 I love breaking into people’s ships and stealing rockets n crap
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:20:02 I once mined into a ship and cut a person’s seat out of the hull and ran off and drowned them
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:20:14 Well “drowned”
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:21:00 My prawn suit is god B)
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:21:31 I’m building the Aurora with a deplorable sunbeam

creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:22:34 One I’m not even done with
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:23:05 My cherno alpha I just started on the feet and it’s gunnw take a week to get it to walk relatively stable
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:23:20 yes I made it 1:5 scale
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:23:22 AKA

creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:23:36 <@!708185644706431038>  cherno alpha from pacific rim
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:23:44 Full scale is impossible
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:23:59 Mines 6 fold
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:24:01 lol
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:24:20 cherno alpha can PVP surprisingly
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:24:33 I fought my friends carrier in the ocean since mine can walk in water
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:24:45 I basically got my right arm blown off by a Yamato
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:24:54 So I slammed my left arm on the front of the bow
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:24:58 And flipped it over
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:25:03 and then jumped on top of it
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:25:14 And sunk it
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:25:16 B)
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:25:45 I’m a god at mechs but if you aren’t used to extremely complex key under you can use it
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:26:51 Just for maneuvering my cherno alpha and all my other mechs use q, e, w, s, a, d, z, x, r, and f
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:27:13 So I can pull some crazy maneuvers and put people into headlocks especially my PVP mech
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:27:31 I once snapped a mechs head off with cutters along the side of my arms when I got it into a headlock
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:27:37 my pvp mech is all physical

creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:27:57 <@!572411935669354528> in bed
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:28:08 Also don’t use textures for it
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:28:35 I don’t like when people use rust
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:28:36 It’s bad
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:28:44 Ugliest thexture
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:28:49 You know when textures we need
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:29:00 We need, force field, and every other texture
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:29:26 We also need a tool that can adjust reflectance
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:29:43 too far
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:29:46 Ruins the game
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:29:57 too many tiny blocks and negates many tactics
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:30:03 and very laggy probably
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:30:19 I don’t like suggestions of: “let us make our own blocks!!!”
creations-chat 2020-09-12 04:30:23 It ruins the purpose of the game

general 2020-10-21 01:06:49 > imagine at the last day of 2020, yellowstone erupts
<@!432344306427101184>
general 2020-10-21 01:06:56 yellowstone is the biggest volcano on earth
general 2020-10-21 01:06:57 lol

general 2020-10-21 01:07:25 yellowstone is a volcano
general 2020-10-21 01:08:09 apparently if yellowstone exploded, the whole entire north american and most of the south american continent is essentially fucked, and the rest of the world will fucken become hoth
general 2020-10-21 01:08:33 <@!431779537634721802> the mons volcanic system on the areian lava plains is completely dead
general 2020-10-21 01:08:37 all of the volcanos are dead
general 2020-10-21 01:08:43 > apparently if yellowstone exploded, the whole entire north american and most of the south american continent is essentially fucked, and the rest of the world will fucken become hoth

general 2020-10-21 01:11:18 its predicted that if it DOES go boom, many heat dependant species will die off very quickly,
general 2020-10-21 01:11:30 its actually theorized that yellowstone is what caused the cambrian extinction

creations-chat 2020-12-13 20:46:33 but i have a question for ya'll. should i do proper treads or fake treads. one is more laggier than the other and can severly impact the viability for it to function.
creations-chat 2020-12-13 20:48:34 my pc can handle it but its not about me, its about wether roblox can handle it or not lol. because server lag exists aswell, and i know tank treads can get laggy pretty fast from all the part collisions rather than in roblox studio where it'd just be an animated part with a standard car rig

creations-chat 2021-01-12 21:00:24 In general it’s to dark. The executor and the ravager were the standard imperial grey. And yeah the back is too short. Also imo you can add more detail n shit to the superstructure/city area, but in general it looks pretty good. Can’t wait to see it finished.

Edit: if you want extra points for shits in giggled or hof add the several hangars that’s on it and if you can maybe mini ties as small as you can make them. That’d be lit. Send me a picture with your engine block if you want critique on how it should look
creations-chat 2021-01-12 21:05:38 Follow official images. I can find a relatively accurate 3D model to follow for you. Also refer to my critique cuz I gave some more advice from a ship builder. https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/executor-b641f58d0b1046328b9300b0b48d779a (this one looks ok but your best bet is using official images from return of the Jedi)

help 2021-05-19 19:38:06 does anybody have a good locking mechanism that would work with a turret on say a battleship?
help 2021-05-19 19:38:09 since like,
help 2021-05-19 19:38:24 making one with pistons breaks it from the sheer amount of motor locking on my battleship
help 2021-06-13 02:06:04 tryna make a single prop ww-2 inspired plane and apparently as expected plane crazy is unrealistic and the wings dont balance out the torque of the prop
help 2021-06-13 02:06:14 and decreasing the torque itself does nothing
help 2021-06-13 02:06:22 and adding a propeller to the back is ugly and unrealistic
help 2021-06-13 02:06:24 any ideas?
help 2021-06-13 02:07:13 or well tilt is a better
help 2021-06-13 02:07:15 word
help 2021-06-13 02:07:20 not a full rotation but i tilt
help 2021-06-13 02:07:38 i dont see a way to realistically keep the integrity of the fighter but also make it fly and look realistic
help 2021-06-13 02:08:20 ???
help 2021-06-13 02:08:24 thats stupid
help 2021-06-13 02:08:43 i wanna make the propeller at the front the main source of thrust
help 2021-06-13 02:09:32 
help 2021-06-13 02:09:37 ive seen someone pull it off
help 2021-06-13 02:09:43 but alright

help 2021-06-13 02:11:59 more of the P40
help 2021-06-13 02:12:29 yeah but i moved it back to accomodate to where the engine would be placed if it actually existed
help 2021-06-13 02:13:17 also its only angled up because planes at the time landed like that. i made it fly without the propeller entirely fly straight
help 2021-06-13 02:17:40 they are though
help 2021-07-01 01:38:56 im too lazy to rejoin and show screenshots

help 2021-08-01 23:52:43 boost the part of your rocket behind you
help 2021-08-01 23:52:49 thats how nasa rockets work.
help 2021-08-01 23:53:14 when segments disconnect a large amount of gas is expelled through ballast tanks which force the part to slow down in comparison to the segment ontop of it
help 2021-08-01 23:53:18 so a collision does not occure
creations-chat 2021-08-09 22:04:18 kek
creations-chat 2021-08-09 22:06:21 the legs provide some of the movement. it is assisted by rockets but its more for stabilizing. so yes and no lmao.

creations-chat 2021-12-19 03:45:10 I looked into it and its not the fold, its more of when i angle the propeller blades to get up and down movement as per how its normally done it likes to rotate to the left

creations-chat 2021-12-20 00:55:55 i mean theres a good chance it probably looks super similar to something someone made but other than that ive been using GAU-8
creations-chat 2021-12-20 00:59:38 bro they look similar but not a copy you numbnut. i have sparklers in the middle and i dont have any of that back casing, and the whole assembly spins so whats your point???

creations-chat 2021-12-20 01:19:56 give opinions on the ship i posted in <#384025409945337856> please its my first proper ship that isnt dog shit
creations-chat 2021-12-20 01:27:26 thanks, the whole issue with rockets was  i wasnt sure how to hide without removing the ability to have an interior on my turrets, and also the destroyer is supposed to be small, hence the big biplane
creations-chat 2021-12-20 01:30:32 its a habit to crop things, also why is a stern torpedo bad just wondering, I mean i never saw it on real warships but i wanna know why its not good,
creations-chat 2021-12-20 01:32:54 ah alright. my next ship which is probably gunna be another destroyer, won't have that issue. though at the time i assumed it would be ok since i could fire it from the side
creations-chat 2021-12-20 01:34:56 i play warthunder, so that should be an explanation enough as to why im not knowledgeable in ship weapon placement. (because all naval is on warthunder is just aids and kamikaze attacks <:empty:794431705070174238> )
help 2021-12-20 01:35:25 just dont use suspension blocks imo making your own is better

creations-chat 2021-12-30 17:36:45 Regardless at the time due to the scale I built it at I had to use cylinder 2 2x2 which have the weird building bounding box and made treads difficult plus I intended on using this for pvp so using pistons to get precise spacing would be a bad idea
creations-chat 2021-12-30 17:38:47 I finished the tank awhile ago, and couldn’t add treads at that point so it just uses them like wheels and attempted to make up for it with detail though it’s not my best

Here it is. Mines somewhat similar to yours but I used suspension instead of strictly pistons on my wheels
creations-chat 2021-12-30 17:47:32 Oh I didn’t see the suspension, nice. I intend on later on returning to this and making a treaded version with the proper suspension systems

general 2022-03-08 16:56:52 You probably use Linux
general 2022-03-08 16:56:58 You seem like the kind to use Linux
general 2022-03-08 16:57:00 ok good
general 2022-03-08 16:57:07 do you use windows II
general 2022-03-08 16:57:16 agreement
general 2022-03-08 16:57:28 I used windows 7 up until last year since
general 2022-03-08 16:57:30 It’s more intuitive
general 2022-03-08 16:57:34 and then upgraded
general 2022-03-08 16:57:45 windows I0 is dumbed down a bit but
general 2022-03-08 16:57:50 still more accessible
general 2022-03-08 16:58:04 Takes up more@space and resources just for an OS
general 2022-03-08 16:58:05 lol
general 2022-03-08 16:58:27 I’ve always been a loyal windows 7 user so
general 2022-03-08 16:58:53 Windows 7 has way more customization with themes n shit and you can do way more in depth stuff but it is old and unsupported by most things
general 2022-03-08 16:59:01 Microsoft said for a good while
general 2022-03-08 16:59:11 windows I0 will probably just keep getting updated but
general 2022-03-08 16:59:26 Keep in mind windows life time means the amount of time they only release it till they release a new OS
general 2022-03-08 16:59:27 so
general 2022-03-08 16:59:31 they’ll still keep it updated

creations-chat 2022-04-08 00:45:10 <@!352986350565457921> that a wing is fairly good but it needs some work. the guns don't stick out as much and need to be less chunky, the engines are a bit iffy, the vertical stabilizers are angled inwards top and bottom slightly, and also don't end abruptly at the front, the crack in the center is more of a V than a cube, cockpit looks a bit big, landing gear are meh, the a wing is too thin and would be about half a block thicker, and on the side front their are vents present.

tldr; use a 3D model next time
creations-chat 2022-04-08 00:49:14 maybe a ton of builds under one theme is kinda meh, i would rather see you attempt to recreate something from the mystery flesh pit, something like this image from the official website

events-chat 2022-05-15 17:52:24 exactly
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:53:03 it should be an auto-disqual accident or not. 

im going to ask rbk for footage of madcat's fights and see if his spinner deaccelerated at all in any of them when hitting
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:53:41 (it should with low torque)
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:55:17 im sure i didnt because rbk checked both chomp and abrams over twice and he said it was good
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:56:20 it was supposed to be 5 but due to size and other factors rbk allowed a torque of 19.98 for the hammer
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:57:12 even if chomp didnt walk for mine atleast i did purposely limit it
events-chat 2022-05-15 17:58:34 i can look. im asking rbk for his footage to see if his motor deaccelerated at all when hitting, it should if the torque was as low as it should be.
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:18:47 <@315262125113081856> rbk showed me jrt's fight with yours

events-chat 2022-05-15 18:24:37 bruh
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:26:29 no
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:26:50 my guy the whole event was around you building a battlebot that functions like the real thing. not do whatever fantasy land thing you want to do.
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:27:28 and before you say anything about chomp, i gave chomp wheels because walking was too difficult for my to do at the time and doing legs would just make it harder for myself to make a version of chomp that isnt massive
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:29:04 no? all it did was make it so i can build it smaller. chomp is about as slow as it would have been with legs. and the turret is the exact same. whats your point?
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:29:36 plus rbk approved that adjustment, last i checked he didnt approve your flippers
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:30:20 LETS GO I TOLD YOU

events-chat 2022-05-15 18:32:04 man, this event was a cluster fuck. next time we should have pre-battle checks and better more defined rules
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:32:31 theres a big difference between being inaccurate and adding a feature that isnt there
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:35:02 I hope the guy that had his win stolen wins. DNC that I lost I just want him to win
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:36:05 
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:36:50 1. High grav was approved

events-chat 2022-05-15 18:37:15 that last part was approved by rbk so take it to the boss

general 2022-05-16 12:38:54 You need a bank account or be 18 to get a digital banking system like PayPal
general 2022-05-16 12:38:59 If you get caught they suspend your account
general 2022-05-16 12:39:03 (You will)
general 2022-05-16 12:39:19 so
general 2022-05-16 12:39:21 good luck
general 2022-05-16 12:39:55 it would still be safer to get a debit card either through your parents or you do it yourself
general 2022-05-16 12:40:03 And use it to get PayPal
general 2022-05-16 12:40:15 because if they suspend your account you have to send your ID proving your 18
general 2022-05-16 12:40:20 Or have a bank account

general 2022-05-24 00:25:05 It’s slang
general 2022-05-24 00:25:10 doesn’t have a proper meaning
general 2022-05-24 00:25:29 my Spanish is super rough sometimes because most of my Spanish was learnt via being around other Spanish speakers and picking up on words

general 2022-05-24 00:41:49 That’s the general rate of thrust, one hover engines = 2 super rocket
general 2022-05-24 00:42:02 But the hover engines don’t have much push to them and it means in turns they become unstable and they also have slower acceleration and can become unstable at speeds past 2000 sps

general 2022-05-24 12:33:07 lmao
general 2022-05-24 12:35:14 It’s because of shorter attention spans
general 2022-05-24 12:35:22 There was a study on this for the drastic change in kids appeal
general 2022-05-24 12:36:45 Higher cases of unmedicated ADHD and shorter attention span from either online media or parents not doing their job and just letting them infront of a tablet their whole childhood as “entertainment”

general 2022-05-25 14:37:06 The reason school shootings keep happening is because people have that attitude and don’t care
general 2022-05-25 14:39:01 clearly almost 2 centuries of them happening hasnt done shit
general 2022-05-25 14:39:43 I’m sorry but i respectfully disagree
general 2022-05-25 14:39:47 horrible mindset

general 2022-05-26 11:51:03 (I have built both of those)
general 2022-05-26 11:51:28 no it’s just a jagdtiger but with a 308mm mortar
general 2022-05-26 11:51:47 panther 2 never existed besides as an unfinished hull
general 2022-05-26 11:52:07 maybe
general 2022-05-26 11:52:20 night chaser do like that one dude did in HOF with the konig tiger
general 2022-05-26 11:52:29 and make a background for your Panther
general 2022-05-26 11:52:33 ez hof win

general 2022-05-26 11:54:42 oooo
general 2022-05-26 11:54:58 only issue is the e-100 never had a turret planned out for it
general 2022-05-26 11:55:08 For testing purposes they used a maus turret
general 2022-05-26 11:55:16 which was never planned to be used in production
general 2022-05-26 11:56:07 If I don’t build a kugelblitz I’m gunna make an IS-7
general 2022-05-26 11:56:12 one of my favourite vehicles
general 2022-05-26 12:02:33 no turret assigned to it either

general 2022-05-26 12:02:54 that’s gay
general 2022-05-26 12:03:25 making up details on a realistic tank from history is like making the p1000 ratte and claim it’s based off of the real thing

creations-chat 2022-05-26 14:03:18 That tank is so out of proportion Jesus. It’s so tall and skinny and the turret looks so weird
general 2022-05-26 14:08:02 Or inability to make organized and efficient motorlock
general 2022-05-26 14:08:29 I see people use like 5 different stacks and complain about it being difficult to hide the motorlock and also have room for other stuff
general 2022-05-26 14:08:49 I’ve yet to see anyone make a good potez 631
general 2022-05-26 14:08:53 and that’s saying something
general 2022-05-26 14:09:07 i might make a Bf-110
general 2022-05-26 14:09:14 French air defense fighter
general 2022-05-26 14:09:23 like a Bf-110 but older
general 2022-05-26 14:10:02 they actually were very effective against enemy German planes for a good whole till Germany brought out their own air defense fighters
general 2022-05-26 14:10:11 It does look good though
general 2022-05-26 14:10:16 I love gull wings

general 2022-05-26 14:11:07 Yes
general 2022-05-26 14:11:26 nobody builds accurate biplanes

general 2022-05-26 14:12:41 i love biplanes
general 2022-05-26 14:13:29 Zach do you only build planes
general 2022-05-26 14:13:37 if so I have to ask if you have an Ho-229
general 2022-05-26 14:13:49 since I have seen no actually accurate and good Ho229’s
general 2022-05-26 14:14:15 It’s hars
general 2022-05-26 14:14:16 No
general 2022-05-26 14:14:46 Do it

general 2022-05-26 14:15:55 Trails look weird on planes tbh
general 2022-05-26 14:16:05 if you build it big enough it works
general 2022-05-26 14:16:25 well what I’m thinking of it has like weird bumps n stuff all over it
general 2022-05-26 14:16:31 oh
general 2022-05-26 14:17:03 When I built my old Ho-229 I built it player scale and used wings angled to get an aerfoil shape
general 2022-05-26 14:17:31 yeah
general 2022-05-26 14:17:50 for me finding space for the verticals wings is what’s hard
general 2022-05-26 14:18:01 Though I did create a pseudo “fly by wire” system
general 2022-05-26 14:18:16 to make it vertically stabilized
general 2022-05-26 14:18:39 huh
general 2022-05-26 14:21:06 I mean modern flying wings just use fly by wire
general 2022-05-26 14:21:10 I did make one in plane crazy
general 2022-05-26 14:21:22 using helium and unstable motor 2’s
general 2022-05-26 14:22:10 i am a welder and feast on the blood of wood workers
general 2022-05-26 14:22:17 Their flesh is good
general 2022-05-26 14:22:38 Learn welding
general 2022-05-26 14:22:40 Useful skill
general 2022-05-26 14:22:49 earn extra money by welding for any military
general 2022-05-26 14:23:07 The navy will pay welding engineers on their ships a fuck ton because welders are hard to come by
general 2022-05-26 14:23:23 plus they never turn you down cuz welders is one of those things you can never have enough of
general 2022-05-26 14:24:34 I mean if you wanna play it safe you can just go do engineering for the coast guard
general 2022-05-26 14:24:43 They still pay well

general 2022-05-26 14:26:48 Do not do the first
general 2022-05-26 14:27:04 I hate all graphic designers for companies because of the shitty simplified logos and
general 2022-05-26 14:27:57 None. Fallout is ass
general 2022-05-26 14:28:35 I might do nuclear engineering and work at a molten salt reactor
general 2022-05-26 14:28:37 Since they’re cool
general 2022-05-26 14:28:45 (nuclear power is the cleanest power)
general 2022-05-26 14:29:03 uh huh
general 2022-05-26 14:29:07 when was the last melt down
general 2022-05-26 14:29:09 problem?
general 2022-05-26 14:29:37 mf’s be like: “nuclear reactors are dangerous when they melt down!!!!” They can’t with modern regulations <:stuff:908917207986208828>
general 2022-05-26 14:30:14 Funfact nuclear fuel and waste  transport containers can survive a train hitting it at full force
general 2022-05-26 14:30:16 so
general 2022-05-26 14:30:58 yes they are very safe and most have an automatic scram system for when the core temperature goes over a limit and it’s normally moderated in an analog fashion
general 2022-05-26 14:31:05 so if power goes out it’s still functioning
general 2022-05-26 14:33:10 nuclear fission is the best green energy because it doesn’t require half the Sahara to power the world, doesn’t need constant cleaning and it doesn’t disrupt natural cycles like hydro power and wind farms
general 2022-05-26 14:33:22 And then there’s modern ways of taking care of nuclear fuel
general 2022-05-26 14:33:24 Breeder reactora
general 2022-05-26 14:33:47 Breeder reactors basically take the spent fuel and keep using it as fuel till it becomes harmless
general 2022-05-26 14:34:13 molten salt reactors are fission reactors but even safer
general 2022-05-26 14:34:36 instead of the fuel being solid if there were problems, the molten salt would solidify in a fuel storage basin and be filled with an inert gas
general 2022-05-26 14:34:37 Which means
general 2022-05-26 14:34:40 no reactor boom
general 2022-05-26 14:35:17 no I just like listening to podcasts about nuclear stuff
general 2022-05-26 14:35:36 Kyle hill is pretty good at explaining nuclear physics and accidents in a well thought out way
general 2022-05-26 14:35:47 https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNg1m3Od-GgNmXngCCJaJBqqm-7wQqGAW
general 2022-05-26 14:35:51 Give his half life histories a listen
general 2022-05-26 14:36:01 That’s where I learned most of what I know about nuclear physics
general 2022-05-26 14:36:21 They should love it
general 2022-05-26 14:36:28 every other source of energy is inefficient
general 2022-05-26 14:37:05 litterally
general 2022-05-26 14:37:13 Modern reactors are the safest place to be in a wasteland
general 2022-05-26 14:37:15 lmao
general 2022-05-26 14:37:49 breeder reactors
general 2022-05-26 14:38:22 basically takes spent fuel and works it down to less radioactive fuel more and more and getting more energy till it turns into something so unradiactive it can be stored normally
general 2022-05-26 14:38:28 And not need a huge ass storage system
general 2022-05-26 14:38:46 If you understand how the nuclear fuel cycle works it makes sense
general 2022-05-26 14:39:06 uranium turns into plutonium, plutonium to neptunium, then to californium and then thorium and so on
general 2022-05-26 14:39:14 They use it like fuel dumbass
general 2022-05-26 14:39:16 not leave it
general 2022-05-26 14:39:42 not how it works
general 2022-05-26 14:40:25 uh huh and we squeeze out as much energy as it can and it turns into harmless radioactive isotopes
general 2022-05-26 14:40:41 mind you breeder reactors are cheap
general 2022-05-26 14:40:53 It’s just government lobbying and the like prevent them from being put into service
general 2022-05-26 14:40:55 Atleast over here
general 2022-05-26 14:40:57 which pisses me off
general 2022-05-26 14:41:26 they don’t stop at Du-235
general 2022-05-26 14:41:30 they keep working it down
general 2022-05-26 14:41:33 till it’s harmless
general 2022-05-26 14:41:44 normally in the form of big facilities
general 2022-05-26 14:42:05 by harmless I mean you can spend a few days around it and be fine
general 2022-05-26 14:42:21 It’s cheaper anyways in the long run
general 2022-05-26 14:42:26 read up
general 2022-05-26 14:42:42 i explained how it works
general 2022-05-26 14:43:12 Chernobyl was 80 years ago pretty much
general 2022-05-26 14:43:29 Fusion is expensive and requires large facilities and expensive equipment just to get the same amount of power
general 2022-05-26 14:43:36 so
general 2022-05-26 14:48:41 the amount of time it’ll take for fusion to go main stream would take so long that in the long run it would be better to switch to fission till fusion becomes better
general 2022-05-26 14:49:03 I do agree is fusion is better overall but
general 2022-05-26 14:49:20 It’s still a developing technology that will take  a year long time to finish
general 2022-05-26 14:49:43 That’s lobbying for you
general 2022-05-26 14:49:54 blame big oil companies and coal mining companies
general 2022-05-26 14:50:29 Most of the world follows America in what it uses for power
general 2022-05-26 14:50:37 If America went nuclear then the rest of the world would follow
general 2022-05-26 14:50:47 no it’s both
general 2022-05-26 14:51:36 Politically nuclear fission and fusion is made artificially expensive and limited politically due to lobbying by people on congress

creations-chat 2022-05-27 12:12:14 Well part of getting in to hof is having a good camera position. That’s the reason I lost HOF with cherno ages ago. they cried because they couldn’t see the legs under the water so
creations-chat 2022-05-27 12:14:33 obc told me it was declined because they couldn’t see the lower half of my legs because my only shot of the jaeger was walking in water. Though I do agree looking back on it now it is a bit ass and most of it comes down to me using 0 motorlock and also shitty folding
creations-chat 2022-05-27 12:16:42 When pc2 comes out I might make another cherno but for now with how broken my game is and how Rick refuses to fix it even if I reinstall roblox, im gunna wait. For big mechs motors will just not work even if I’m in 0g and have no anchor because of client side bugs.


Basically the same bug as what happened with my rockets and fireworks which still pisses me off. Don’t work if I’m moving
creations-chat 2022-05-27 12:19:13 true. I did say if pc2 isn’t out by the end of June I’m gunna dip from the game and move on cuz I’m tired of waiting

events-chat 2022-06-02 13:44:27 <@466793357318815744> battlebot tank track competition
events-chat 2022-06-02 13:44:44 they all have to use tank tracks with a maximum of 4 individual tracks
events-chat 2022-06-02 13:45:19 Only one wheel powers the whole track, loss of movement in both tracks = death
events-chat 2022-06-02 13:45:36 it would be fun to do + basic tank tracks aren’t hard
events-chat 2022-06-02 13:46:29 Suspension isn’t necessary anyways since the terrain is flat on the train tracks
creations-chat 2022-06-02 13:48:10 <@562785676844728351> yo can you show me your rocket accelerator

general 2022-06-02 13:54:10 Why are you using the sunderland
general 2022-06-02 13:54:11 It’s ass
events-chat 2022-06-02 14:34:02 yeah but regardless it’ll still be an interesting event and give a chance for more advanced players (no whitenames or cheaters) to participate
events-chat 2022-06-02 15:08:40 Makes it more fun
events-chat 2022-06-02 15:09:08 Plus my og tonka-tank used tracks and had no flinging problems, just don’t make the tracks tight
events-chat 2022-06-02 15:09:33 That and only having 2 tracked vehicles spawned isn’t very laggy if there’s only one motor powering the drive train
events-chat 2022-06-02 15:10:36 That and there’s always the ability to make it a best 2 out of 3 situation for every fight
events-chat 2022-06-02 15:11:55 plus fights will be longer as people will take less risky fights than if they were using protected wheels
events-chat 2022-06-02 15:14:52 I will keep writing an essay about how cool this would be
events-chat 2022-06-02 16:53:08 <@466793357318815744> do my event idea

creations-chat 2022-06-02 23:49:21 True but the only issue is most no ranks provide useless critiques or hell get upset when their own build is critiqued. I don’t disregard no rank opinions. I’m jokingly racist towards whitenames
creations-chat 2022-06-02 23:51:30 Wdym???? What did tooti do to you. He’s a chill guy who is a bit harsh about his criticism sometimes but he never did anything smh.

creations-chat 2022-06-07 14:17:13 It’s mid. looks better than 99% of them but I’ve also seen a billion f14’s and none of them are ever special so. Sorry but it’s a downvote
creations-chat 2022-06-07 14:25:16 yeah but still overrated and built.

I vote on the actual concept behind the build so if it’s overbuilt even if it’s good it’s a downvote, only exception is if there is something special to how it’s presented or designed

creations-chat 2022-06-16 01:55:59 if a build is overbuilt, non of the other builds are good. its like basically, if everyone's build of one thing is the exact same, none of em are good, hence why i downvote every F14

creations-chat 2022-07-02 21:19:31 ok what am i giving feedback for
creations-chat 2022-07-02 21:21:32 <@401530469952389130> colors look mid, could have some very slight weathering which would make it better aswell as making the color of that fuel jug a darker color, plus i feel as if the wheels and the body of the humvee are too far apart. looks good but those are just some changes i reccomend to make it 100% 10/10

creations-chat 2022-07-10 04:02:07 Yeah you have the mental capacity of a goldfish. V12’s will be around for a long ass time because tanks exist

contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:18:15 unpopular opinion: that helicopter that was just submitted is boring
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:18:32 no, undetailed, you had a whole other 500 blocks you could've abused to make it better
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:18:58 i will give the helicopter tiger thing credit, they used the max amount of blocks they were allowed
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:19:11 if you want a better chance, sorry this might sound harsh but
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:19:15 redo it but better
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:20:49 still has problems
-unsmooth design which could be fixed easily
-boring lazy coloration
-no weathering of any kind to make it look used,
-the viewport is undetailed as fuck and makes it look like a chinese copy of a tiefighter without the signature octagonal viewport
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:21:07 most of these issues require starting over/building at a bigger scale
contest-chat 2022-07-15 01:21:17 sorry but basically im saying, remake it but better

general 2022-07-16 14:09:21 IFV is a class of tank you bozo
general 2022-07-16 14:09:42 unless it’s an armored car which case it is not a tank
general 2022-07-16 14:10:02 Tank is any fighting vehicle that uses tracks but ok
general 2022-07-16 14:10:12 Emo
general 2022-07-16 14:10:15 Emo
general 2022-07-16 14:10:26 lmao!!!
general 2022-07-16 14:10:30 can’t say funny word!!!!
general 2022-07-16 14:11:40 ATGM, 30mm auto cannon
general 2022-07-16 14:11:45 heavy arms fire
general 2022-07-16 14:12:01 both of which can have an explicit anti-tank role
general 2022-07-16 14:12:20 send messages
general 2022-07-16 14:12:28 You need to rank up or smthn
general 2022-07-16 14:13:03 A bmp in my eyes is a tank trying to be an IFV, just like the PT-76 and the object 209
general 2022-07-16 14:13:28 an IFV would have to be a vehicle that either has no armor or only has mounted machine gun
general 2022-07-16 14:13:37 it can still do some damage to lighter vehicles
general 2022-07-16 14:13:51 and also damage things such as tank barrels and tracks alongside running gear
general 2022-07-16 14:14:09 Which can ensure a mobility or armament kill
general 2022-07-16 14:14:24 yes. Problem? <:kiss1:802327654904627210> <:kiss2:802327683769827409>
general 2022-07-16 14:14:41 tank is an overarching term that encompasses IFV’s
general 2022-07-16 14:14:51 IFV is just a highly specialized form of the tank
general 2022-07-16 14:15:20 Only exception is if the vehicle uses wheels
general 2022-07-16 14:15:27 which case it becomes an armored car
general 2022-07-16 14:15:36 which is a whole other umbrella in of itself
general 2022-07-16 14:16:11 half tracks don’t count as tanks imo
general 2022-07-16 14:16:17 They count as armored cars
general 2022-07-16 14:16:20 in my eyes
general 2022-07-16 14:16:45 Only exception is if the half track mounts a tank caliber weapon
general 2022-07-16 14:16:54 ??? We’re not arguing just discussing
general 2022-07-16 14:16:57 What’s your problem
general 2022-07-16 14:17:32 good example is the 8,8 cm flak 37 SFL which is a half track that mounts a German 88mm repurposed for anti tank warefare
general 2022-07-16 14:17:38 yes <:stuff:908917207986208828>
general 2022-07-16 14:17:58 A tank is a broad term with a vague definition so
general 2022-07-16 14:18:35 atgm not attached to vehicle + vehicle wasn't designed for warefare
general 2022-07-16 14:18:38 so
general 2022-07-16 14:18:41 doesnt count
general 2022-07-16 14:19:23 bob semple tank is a tankette
general 2022-07-16 14:19:35 still not a tank, was not designed for armored warefare
general 2022-07-16 14:19:58 tankette isnt determined by size, a tankette is a female tank that mounts only light or heavy machineguns
general 2022-07-16 14:20:17 ???
general 2022-07-16 14:20:20 yeah
general 2022-07-16 14:20:21 it is
general 2022-07-16 14:20:23 had like
general 2022-07-16 14:20:26 no armor though
general 2022-07-16 14:20:48 corregated metal would have been effective against small arms fire and causing richochet
general 2022-07-16 14:21:11 once again, i consider half tracks armored cars unless it mounts a full on tank gun like an 8,8 in the case of the flakbus
general 2022-07-16 14:21:22 which case it is loosely a "tank"
general 2022-07-16 14:21:50 fair but bob semple only mounted machineguns
general 2022-07-16 14:22:15 it COULD have mounted a 37 but with the abysmal interior it would be a nightmare
general 2022-07-16 14:22:26 spg/tank
general 2022-07-16 14:22:42 spgs are tanks sort of, unless they carry wheels like the G6 rhino
general 2022-07-16 14:22:58 im not going to the golden gates above, sorry buddy, im going down velow
general 2022-07-16 14:23:07 well, later versions
general 2022-07-16 14:23:33 early iterations carried low-velocity infantry support guns
general 2022-07-16 14:23:34 so
general 2022-07-16 14:23:59 i mean it does have armor so being 100% realistic, probably could be a troop transport lmao if it had doors
general 2022-07-16 14:24:00 so

general 2022-07-23 21:12:25 I’ve always had the idea to make a moc either out of models or legos of an AT-TE in tank combat against an AT-AT
general 2022-07-23 21:12:33 a rebel AT-TE
general 2022-07-23 21:12:45 though we all know the at-at would lose tbh

general 2022-07-23 21:18:30 MAKE BOXNESS GET LAPPLAND PFP
general 2022-07-23 21:19:03 Twitch is the worst platform to stream on
general 2022-07-23 21:19:08 it’s almost impossible to go viral
general 2022-07-23 21:19:21 Plus twitch takes something like 85% of revenue
general 2022-07-23 21:19:34 meanwhile iirc YouTube does it 50/50 or they take less
general 2022-07-23 21:19:45 twitch has biased and shit moderation
general 2022-07-23 21:19:46 so
general 2022-07-23 21:20:03 YouTube takes way less than twitch so
general 2022-07-23 21:20:18 i get taxes too
general 2022-07-23 21:20:23 ???

general 2022-07-23 21:56:05 Hm…
general 2022-07-24 01:12:10 I have synapse but I don’t use it
general 2022-07-24 01:12:15 don’t wanna get banned
general 2022-07-24 01:12:46 what about it
general 2022-07-24 01:12:56 Exploiting is lame
general 2022-07-24 01:13:04 unless it’s on a shit game
general 2022-07-24 01:13:10 i could say the same about you
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:22:48 <@401530469952389130> that walking is
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:22:51 rough
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:23:25 fair
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:23:36 if you ever want i can help you make a better walking system
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:28:18 well
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:28:21 main suggestion is
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:28:26 rely less on motor 2's
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:28:35 and try to use wing panels to make the walking more organic
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:28:49 and also, suspension is your best friend in inverse-knee mechs
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:30:21 like
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:30:24 its hard to explain but
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:30:33 drag = slower movement in certain joints
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:30:46 motor 2's are only reccomended for where the knee would be
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:32:11 <@401530469952389130>
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:32:17 its best to model the legs like you would a humans
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:32:34 either make up or find where the human-related joints would be and it becomes much easier
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:32:45 plus my gripe with your at-rt is the leg structure is
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:32:48 almost nothing like it
contest-chat 2022-07-25 02:32:49 sorry if im a bit harsh

general 2022-07-28 03:49:17 Honestly his pfp should be the yellow shirt trains kid from the polar express not the main character
general 2022-07-28 03:49:23 The trains kid suits him better
general 2022-07-28 03:49:51 Imagine needing a tutorial to discover motorlock
general 2022-07-28 03:49:56 I rediscovered fire by myself
general 2022-07-28 03:50:23 tell him he either: A. Should’ve waited for Pc2 or B. Built smaller
general 2022-07-28 03:50:26 it’s a skill issue
general 2022-07-28 03:50:29 not a rickje-issue
general 2022-07-28 03:50:31 Get it right
general 2022-07-28 03:51:52 yeah he can help by teaching basic principles. The rest you can do by yourself like the rest of us
general 2022-07-28 03:52:19 All I had was a friend show me basic function of all the blocks in the game and just told me to go crazy
general 2022-07-28 03:52:40 you technically can’t post it here though
general 2022-07-28 03:52:43 If it ain’t yours
general 2022-07-28 03:53:36 Imo it shouldn’t be allowed if someone else built it on his account
general 2022-07-28 03:53:48 If it was a collab it should have appropriate citing

general 2022-07-28 03:56:56 99% of anime has boring shit plots or hell a real and unique story ain’t even present
general 2022-07-28 03:57:16 doesn’t help anime love to copy each other’s stories and somehow make them worse
general 2022-07-28 03:57:19 Too long
general 2022-07-28 03:57:22 can’t be bothered

general 2022-07-28 03:59:36 Never was good at team sports to be honest because I never bothered to do them
general 2022-07-28 03:59:42 cross country is my thing

general 2022-07-28 04:02:01 Can’t trust them
general 2022-07-28 04:02:29 I got nothing to hide. I own a double barrel over and under, a carcano rifle and a Remington rifle
general 2022-07-28 04:02:46 only one of which has ammunition
general 2022-07-28 04:02:53 Shit for bird shooting
general 2022-07-28 04:03:00 Or well

general 2022-07-28 04:03:14 ???
general 2022-07-28 04:03:21 It’s break action
general 2022-07-28 04:04:04 lever
general 2022-07-28 04:04:08 quieter and more control
general 2022-07-28 04:04:22 pump would scare every deer moose and rabbit within a 200 meter range
general 2022-07-28 04:04:29 unless you oil the fuck out of it
general 2022-07-28 11:02:16 You can opt your in settings

general 2022-07-29 22:16:15 Ho229 is my favourite jet in warthunder
general 2022-07-29 22:16:19 It’s so awkward but fun
general 2022-07-29 22:16:33 it can turn quiet literally on a dime and has incredible energy conservation
general 2022-07-29 22:16:44 And the guns are 103 hvap 30’s
general 2022-07-29 22:16:55 Only issue is it’s acceleration is ass until it gets to 500 IAS
general 2022-07-29 22:17:43 It’s a skill issue being 100% honest
general 2022-07-29 22:17:53 Plus the grind is much harder in arcade

general 2022-07-31 11:45:00 maybe don’t try and throw shade on my name while I’m asleep. The criticism I gave was valid and I gave it to try and help you get better at designing your mechs, but thats cool

not my fault your butt hurt over criticism my dude
events-chat 2022-07-31 11:45:55 your using the same points shredder bug users use, just throwing that out there

general 2022-07-31 12:19:57 also dude still made shitty points lol!
general 2022-07-31 12:20:14 couldn’t take minor criticism I could have pulled a hars and picked apart everything wrong with the build
general 2022-07-31 12:20:23 🤪
general 2022-07-31 12:23:11 make the turret on a pair of mega
general 2022-07-31 12:23:12 ???
general 2022-07-31 12:23:12 Legs*
general 2022-07-31 12:23:30 Or Atleast kept the noticeable design que of the maus turret somewhere on the build

general 2022-07-31 12:25:04 Old photo has better colors and detail but
general 2022-07-31 12:25:10 It isn’t hard to make it look good
general 2022-07-31 12:25:31 realism
general 2022-07-31 12:25:53 heavy ass turret with a huge armament on a heavy chassis means thick ass legs and those legs being stumpy
general 2022-07-31 12:26:01 it walks like the tank mechs in warthunder
general 2022-07-31 12:26:47 Yours is still ass and boring to look at
general 2022-07-31 12:27:08 like the legs are generic as fuck, why would their be an arm on a combat turreted mech
general 2022-07-31 12:27:19 and why would the guns be mounted off to the side
general 2022-07-31 12:27:30 There’s no thought logic behind yours
general 2022-07-31 12:28:02 no thought logic = shit build that does not make much sense
general 2022-07-31 12:28:41 no but it doesn’t hurt to put a little bit of thought into your custom vehicles to make them more realistic and in turn make it look better
general 2022-07-31 12:29:09 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
general 2022-07-31 12:29:30 Malding because you can’t accept criticism

events-chat 2022-07-31 12:44:02 plane crazy pvp in un-structured combat is just boring ass fighting
events-chat 2022-07-31 12:44:22 There’s nothing fun to it. Doesn’t help that pistons completely shit themselves when you want to make a detailed pvp build
events-chat 2022-07-31 20:14:44 Pistons no matter what crash you when they’re shot

contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:06:07 Yeah so
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:06:12 I’ve run into a  bit of an issue
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:06:23 Physics
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:06:43 I made an engine like yours not valve based but
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:06:51 it struggled to bring it up a small hill
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:03 And that’s when it’s only powering 1 drive wheel
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:06 Yours
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:14 We need a way to power 4
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:20 Cuz I found out 4 is needed
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:31 yeah it was inline so it did vibrate a bit but
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:49 I need the 3 upper road wheels, the big wheel and the rear idler to rotate on each track
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:50 Which
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:07:56 I’m not 100% sure if that’s even possible
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:09:24 so then why did it just
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:09:25 not
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:09:50 I’m off for the night
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:09:58 cuz I got work tomorrow
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:09:59 but
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:10:11 How much torque does your engine produce
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:10:15 Because I need a lot
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:10:42 My tracks aren’t wide enough for intentional reasons so they struggle to grip even with just motors in use
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:12:02 Can you do like a
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:12:09 Pseudo test
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:12:24 Because I don’t wanna make that complex engine and gearbox and just have it not be able to move under its own power
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:12:30 ok that’s fine
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:12:34 What time will you be on tomorrow
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:12:45 I allocated enough space in my design in theory for the engine if not I can make more

contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:19 I’ll be in vip-1 at 5
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:27 ill copy the engine and gearbox then
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:32 Quick question though
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:51 Do I need 2 engines 1 per track Mark 5 tank style
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:13:54 Or no
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:14:31 hopefully you can because
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:14:49 Saying fitting 2 is hard is more than an understatement
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:15:18 my brain died on that sentence
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:15:55 Since I’m making everything full real should I make an auto loader for my 100mm howitzer
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:16:05 I know an easy Russian style auto loader
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:17:05 Well witj how large the turret will be I should have space for Atleast a 5 stage loader
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:17:17 Worst case scenario I downgrade to a 76mm
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:18:15 Or I can cheat a little and do a magazine style
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:18:21 And just use shorter rounds
contest-chat 2022-08-20 04:18:37 Only issue is doing magazine style limits my elevation and depression

contest-chat 2022-08-28 01:23:01 nobody can see them
contest-chat 2022-08-28 01:23:06 Plus the design work is terrible
contest-chat 2022-08-28 01:23:18 You could have angle locked the front
contest-chat 2022-08-28 01:23:24 and made that angled white stripe so much better
contest-chat 2022-08-28 01:23:35 ^
general 2022-08-28 01:42:31 I love ww1/interwar tanks
general 2022-08-28 01:42:41 T35/T28
general 2022-08-28 01:42:47 I love multiturret tanks
general 2022-08-28 01:43:05 I might make a T35 soon
general 2022-08-28 01:43:09 Overrated
general 2022-08-28 01:43:57 American heavies are awesome
general 2022-08-28 01:44:16 The t29 with the big ass rangefinder is cooler
general 2022-08-28 01:45:05 Yeah it had a big ass battleship rangefinder
general 2022-08-28 01:45:12 Would’ve been able to hit targets from@more than 4 miles
general 2022-08-28 01:45:13 Away
general 2022-08-28 01:46:04 T28 and T95 is the same tank,
general 2022-08-28 01:46:19 The T95 and the T28 can both have their extra tracks removed
general 2022-08-28 01:46:42 I’ve yet to seen a good IS-7
general 2022-08-28 01:46:46 on plane crazy
general 2022-08-28 01:46:49 I might try and make it
general 2022-08-28 01:47:05 The IS-7 and the T-10M are sexy
general 2022-08-28 01:47:10 Anglelockinf
general 2022-08-28 01:47:49 
general 2022-08-28 01:47:53 Only issue would be
general 2022-08-28 01:47:56 Making the breach/mantlet
general 2022-08-28 01:48:15 🤪
general 2022-08-28 01:49:32 Sometimes I wonder how practical a real scorpion tank would be if it had accurate armor layouts
general 2022-08-28 01:49:41 most of the tech in it is present in real life
general 2022-08-28 01:50:12 Fr
general 2022-08-28 01:50:18 They always make the ERA wrong too
general 2022-08-28 01:50:25 Not enough leopard 1’s or other tanks
general 2022-08-28 01:50:30 Or AA’s
general 2022-08-28 01:50:38 I rarely see a gepard
general 2022-08-28 01:51:47 Not enough people build multi-turreted tanks or ww1/interwar tanks
general 2022-08-28 01:52:03 I wanna see an A1E1 independent tank
general 2022-08-28 01:52:05 It’ll be cool
general 2022-08-28 01:52:14 the independent looks awesome
general 2022-08-28 01:52:34 wow
general 2022-08-28 01:52:42 Eh, overrated
general 2022-08-28 01:53:28 I love the Bankannone
general 2022-08-28 01:53:32 Artillery tanks are cool
general 2022-08-28 01:54:49 I rarely see anybody make assault guns or artillery tanks
general 2022-08-28 01:54:53 They’re underrated
general 2022-08-28 01:55:02 stuff like the Bkan 1C and the like
general 2022-08-28 01:55:07 frrrr

general 2022-08-28 01:57:15 Object 120 taran is still cool though
general 2022-08-28 01:57:28 I love when tanks have big ass Infrared spotlights
general 2022-08-28 01:57:30 It looks so cool
general 2022-08-28 01:57:32 Dunno why
general 2022-08-28 01:58:44 I hate wargaming they make up tanks and advertise them as real
general 2022-08-28 01:59:05 75% of the tanks in WOT are paper tanks or just don’t exist
general 2022-08-28 01:59:13 (Jagdpanzer E-100)
general 2022-08-28 01:59:37 plus somehow WOT is more pay to win than warthunder and that’s saying something
general 2022-08-28 01:59:44 Overinflated tech trees
general 2022-08-28 01:59:57 yeah but it doesn’t exist so it’s just like
general 2022-08-28 01:59:59 there
general 2022-08-28 02:00:03 if it was real it’s cooler
general 2022-08-28 02:00:07 nah
general 2022-08-28 02:00:12 It’s something like
general 2022-08-28 02:00:13 10
general 2022-08-28 02:00:15 or the like
general 2022-08-28 02:00:27 yeah the ostwind 2 is ass anyways even if it’s fake
general 2022-08-28 02:00:47 Worlds slowest turn time and a 30mm shell will do Jack shit
general 2022-08-28 02:01:05 I don’t like wot’s health system since it becomes a point and click simulator
general 2022-08-28 02:01:14 + there’s no real skill to it for the most part
general 2022-08-28 02:01:26 a little yeah and I wasn’t a fan of it
general 2022-08-28 02:01:32 I don’t know the exact specifics
general 2022-08-28 02:01:33 But
general 2022-08-28 02:02:06 I just prefer the realistic tank combat in warthunder with a module based system, I play simulator on warthunder for a reason
general 2022-08-28 02:02:14 More fun
general 2022-08-28 02:03:11 don’t wanna put the effort in
general 2022-08-28 02:03:19 plus I don’t even play warthunder much anymore anyways
general 2022-08-28 02:03:23 Tank games are stale now
general 2022-08-28 02:03:48 If you aim for weakspots yes but that’s because APHE is modeled incorrectly but I understand
general 2022-08-28 02:03:57 i don’t really play tanks on warthunder anyways
general 2022-08-28 02:04:00 Not my thing exactly
general 2022-08-28 02:04:03 I prefer planes
general 2022-08-28 02:04:58 I’m almost 9.7 air for more than 3 nations in warthunder because I like air
general 2022-08-28 02:05:30 I love the asu-57 at top tier on warthunder
general 2022-08-28 02:05:33 Immense trolling
general 2022-08-28 02:06:53 Suffer
general 2022-08-28 02:06:53 I love French vehicles
general 2022-08-28 02:06:57 The EBR is godly
general 2022-08-28 02:07:02 I love it so much and it looks so good
general 2022-08-28 02:07:21 ELC bis. Asu-57 but better <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
general 2022-08-28 02:07:30 I love elc bis
general 2022-08-28 02:08:14 What is with tank games and:
1. Nerfing France into the ground
2. Not giving France all their vehicles considering they were a major armored vehicle manufacturer
general 2022-08-28 02:09:40 Because France is a majored armor warefare producer
general 2022-08-28 02:09:42 ???
general 2022-08-28 02:09:58 outside of jokes, not an excuse
general 2022-08-28 02:10:06 also america is worse than France
general 2022-08-28 02:10:30 you know what we need, we need a ww1-interwar tank game
general 2022-08-28 02:10:33 That would be awesome
general 2022-08-28 02:10:49 Trench combat in a A7V fighting a Renault FT
general 2022-08-28 02:11:06 What is with you and asking people 24/7 to play warthunder lol
general 2022-08-28 02:11:13 nothing against it but
general 2022-08-28 02:11:24 
general 2022-08-28 02:11:45 I wish the MI-4AV was removed from warthunder it’s such a shit helicopter
general 2022-08-28 02:12:00 It literally stalls out in hover mode
general 2022-08-28 02:12:02 💀
general 2022-08-28 02:13:18 What tank
general 2022-08-28 02:13:41 I might make a M901 (WALL-E)

contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:11:24 True but this dudes saying they’re not even combustion engines at all
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:12:21 combustion engine by defintion is any engine that uses combustion of fuel to directly or indirectly drive a piston producing torque

contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:19:43 Nah I don’t think so
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:19:56 not unless I make mine more steampunk because I think people are too picky
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:19:57 so
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:20:30 I’m gunna rework the coloring, detail more, give it a more dirty look and give it pin-shading and a dirt wash and make it look worn
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:20:35 So it’s more steampunk-y
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:20:56 Like what do you mean chunky
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:21:01 Are you talking about the mud
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:21:02 Oh

contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:21:37 So
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:21:45 and it gets pretty laggy past that
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:22:06 7-8k
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:22:16 Not my biggest build
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:22:43 my biggest was around 14-15k and it was when I was making a ship from warhammer
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:22:57 I tried optimizing by using beams and eveurhting but
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:09 Best I could do without effecting the look of coloring
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:23:36 People who post as early as possible scare me
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:24:04 like why don’t people just wait till the end and just, make the effort to keep improving and working on it with the extra time

contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:29:54 <@697878770484510831> I’ll explain this once and only once. The concept idea was to take a 20th century vehicle car thing whatever, and make it look steampunk
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:30:28 You have 3 days then, you better make it good
contest-chat 2022-08-28 05:30:35 2 individual submissions per person

contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:55:47 I haven’t heard from night in awhile sadly

contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:56:25 <@466793357318815744> are you gunna end the contest
contest-chat 2022-09-01 13:56:28 Or let someone end early bro
contest-chat 2022-09-01 14:23:19 Ah
contest-chat 2022-09-01 14:23:24 it be like that
creations-chat 2022-09-01 14:24:15 I mean it looks good but it’s an f104.. the f104 is super ugly already but
creations-chat 2022-09-01 16:14:57 50 cals are on the wrong side I think also you should have added a pintle mount MG. Including that sexy coincidence rangefinder is awesome though, you rarely see it
creations-chat 2022-09-01 16:17:28 I’m thinking of the t34 then, my bad. That or the t30 one of them has the 50’s swapped
creations-chat 2022-09-01 16:28:50 Added tracks can make a difference since it’s an extra 20-40mm of spare armor. And in a hull down or angled position it can make a hit you normally won’t survive, survivable
creations-chat 2022-09-01 17:11:11 Cry all you want, hull is not smooth at all, cheese grater wings, camo is not smooth and blocky, jet engines look ass, the AAM’s are just default rockets, and the cockpit/canopy isn’t accurate at all. That’s why I’m downvoting
creations-chat 2022-09-01 17:13:13 That too I could keep going but at that point it’s overkill to keep explaining why
creations-chat 2022-09-01 17:38:58 FYI your Hubble had no zoom. It’s possible with anglelock to make a proper scope that legitimately works. My anti-ship MAC gun has an adjustable manual sight
creations-chat 2022-09-01 18:14:03 Anglelock. Curving glass = magnification
contest-chat 2022-09-01 18:41:25 Rbk is a day late

creations-chat 2022-09-01 23:39:25 No?? It means it’s not original and it makes it boring. You know people rate your build off of its concept right?
creations-chat 2022-09-01 23:41:30 It’s good looking sure but you could’ve chosen something original mate, but you didn’t.
creations-chat 2022-09-01 23:46:42 someone’s mad my steampunk tank is winning.
Also your fine to build whatever but it’s still fine to rate a build off of its originality. Your logic is basically like saying if someone copied the Mona Lisa but almost a direct copy but with a monster energy in it does make it good
general 2022-09-01 23:46:56 Mad

contest-chat 2022-09-08 02:21:33 Owned
contest-chat 2022-09-08 02:55:36 No
contest-chat 2022-09-08 02:57:01 Au-1 is the Corsair produced by vought, F2G is ford/Goodyear and F4U is whatever
contest-chat 2022-09-08 02:57:20 They’re all the same minus a few minor differences which are because of different manufactures
general 2022-09-08 10:02:26 I’m well aware
general 2022-09-08 10:02:54 💀
contest-chat 2022-09-08 10:52:24 They won’t win anyways
contest-chat 2022-09-08 10:52:28 so
contest-chat 2022-09-08 10:52:56 even if someone builds a really good a-10 it’ll lose anyways because of unoriginality
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:01:54 You have no idea how scale works
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:02:06 Personally I’d say no multi role only dedicated
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:02:32 remove the grey areas so people don’t cheat
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:03:03 The only exceptions should be stuff
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:03:08 Like the f117
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:03:15 Or the f111 aardvark
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:03:38 attack/bombers are pretty much the same as a dedicated attack aircraft
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:03:46 only difference is one lacks guns and the other doesn’t
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:03:59 no
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:04:11 f111 aardvark is a strike/attack plane
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:04:26 American equivalent to the mig-27
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:04:44 though your not wrong
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:05:10 F111 was multirole in the fact that it had different models for different purposes such as an electronic warfare variant so if someone builds the ground attack model
contest-chat 2022-09-08 14:05:13 Then it’s ok
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:06:29 Not player scale
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:06:33 Too small
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:06:41 You’d have to scale it up by half a block
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:06:48 in all dimensions
creations-chat 2022-09-08 16:30:25 yo homie how old are you, just curious if your like not English as your first language or whatever
creations-chat 2022-09-08 16:32:46 oh what country dude <@982637637816950835>
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:52:20 you forgot that
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:52:25 there’s armor in the tank
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:52:38 Sure if it’s like paper armor then yeah you can fit 5 dudes into that
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:52:47 But the Sherman was a spacious tank,
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:53:03 You’d have to scale yours by .55-.60
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:53:15 in order for it to be accurate
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:53:37 or in lamemens terms, scale it up by half
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:53:57 which is wrong
creations-chat 2022-09-08 16:54:13 4 bladed propellers are easy
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:54:25 1. That’s not how scale ratios work
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:54:29 2. It’s inaccurate
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:54:52 look at any multi crew tank combat game and you’ll have an idea as to how big tanks really are when compared to the roblox player
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:55:10 (assuming the roblox player is an average middle man height of 5’5)
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:55:57 block ≠ meter
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:56:18 Though for buildings sake for non-roscale things 1 block = 1 meter is a workable scale if you wanna math out the proportions
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:56:29 i do that for my builds to get precise angles
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:56:35 thank Pythagorean theorem
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:57:19 If your gunna do roscale,
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:57:20 Do it
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:57:30 send a screenshot of your progress
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:57:44 easier to figure out if you got a roblox player next to it
contest-chat 2022-09-08 16:57:55 Ok do that and I’ll get back to you

general 2022-09-14 01:27:38 Meh in terms of opinion
contest-chat 2022-09-14 03:42:34 it is true but
contest-chat 2022-09-14 03:42:52 There’s a big difference between strike/attack fighters and pure fighters
contest-chat 2022-09-14 03:43:28 but for this case most fighters are multirole but for this contest to eliminate grey areas it’d prolly be best for no multirole period
contest-chat 2022-09-14 03:43:50 Because as mentioned above by someone else, then it gets sticky with stuff like the su-57 or the f-22 or f-35
contest-chat 2022-09-14 03:43:53 <@466793357318815744>
contest-chat 2022-09-14 03:45:44 <@733724147640827924> su-25 does not nearly have enough hard points
contest-chat 2022-09-14 03:45:59 Iirc the frog foot had 5-6 hard points on each wing not to mention  2 underneath
contest-chat 2022-09-14 03:51:35 I got confused over something
contest-chat 2022-09-14 03:51:37 Disregard that
contest-chat 2022-09-14 03:51:44 The phantom would not be allowed for the contest since
contest-chat 2022-09-14 03:51:53 It is multirole in the fact that it has 2 purposes

contest-chat 2022-09-18 20:37:05 build
contest-chat 2022-09-18 20:37:18 yet you chose to build a strike version of a multirole fighter
contest-chat 2022-09-18 20:37:22 that looks exactly the same
contest-chat 2022-09-18 20:37:27 just seems boring and cheesy to me
contest-chat 2022-09-18 20:37:45 + its not "dedicated" because its a modification of an existing plane to adapt it

general 2022-09-19 13:27:56 The truth
general 2022-09-19 13:28:51 I don’t have any it was a one off joke bro
general 2022-09-19 13:28:57 Plus what are they even gunna do
general 2022-09-19 13:29:01 PCC is locked down tight
general 2022-09-19 13:29:10 all they can do is spam
general 2022-09-19 13:29:47 the servers toast anyways
general 2022-09-19 13:29:57 plus his game is ruined too
general 2022-09-19 13:30:06 that and prototrode told mocmish that it was him
general 2022-09-19 13:30:10 who ruined the server so
general 2022-09-19 13:30:19 Only person who can get banned even by a long shot is proto
general 2022-09-19 13:30:34 But we deleted every channel as a last ditch thing so
general 2022-09-19 13:30:39 I doubt they have the evidence
general 2022-09-19 13:30:52 besides screenshots of us in the members tab which amounts to nothing
general 2022-09-19 13:31:11 Oops
general 2022-09-19 13:31:12 prototrode
general 2022-09-19 13:31:26 Forgot about that
general 2022-09-19 13:31:53 ngl I was expecting to get banned from PCC for association with a raid
general 2022-09-19 13:47:49 I was the one who nuked it
general 2022-09-19 13:47:51 Used a script
general 2022-09-19 13:48:10 But some boxness kid invited a nuke bot or something
creations-chat 2022-09-19 15:35:46 <@294980570885390346> looks good but my god those missiles completely ruin it. That and the color scheme is bland and for an all aluminum skin it’s way too clean, the nose is coloration is blocky and uneven and you should make the engines have interior detail
creations-chat 2022-09-19 15:39:38 If I were you I would just make missiles that look authentic and good instead of ones that work because unless your showing them working they’re not really necessary since your just showing image forms of the build
creations-chat 2022-09-19 15:42:19 too wip to give criticism

general 2022-09-21 16:44:14 It was so ass
general 2022-09-21 16:46:22 Sim is fun if you got time
general 2022-09-21 16:46:41 Get used to long periods of inactivity with tanks
general 2022-09-21 16:46:47 As most shots are 1km+
general 2022-09-21 16:46:53 In sim
general 2022-09-21 16:46:57 And rushing is punished
general 2022-09-21 16:46:58 Hard
general 2022-09-21 16:47:10 Top tier is fun but the only issue is
general 2022-09-21 16:47:14 Nobody plays top tier sim
general 2022-09-21 16:47:28 top tier sim the T-80 is a monster
general 2022-09-21 16:47:36 no
general 2022-09-21 16:47:43 Low velocity guns compared to most nations
general 2022-09-21 16:48:03 you’ll be outranged by American guns and German guns by a long shot
general 2022-09-21 16:48:13 even Russian guns outrange most British tanks
general 2022-09-21 16:48:23 5.0-6.7
general 2022-09-21 16:48:28 that’s the range I play ground sim
general 2022-09-21 16:48:37 Most often than not I only see fireflies able to land hits
general 2022-09-21 16:48:49 but even then I can pen a firefly easily before it can fire
general 2022-09-21 16:48:52 back at me
general 2022-09-21 16:48:56 Uptier
general 2022-09-21 16:49:02 not many people play sim so

general 2022-09-21 16:51:24 Same with APCR
general 2022-09-21 16:51:32 Atleast I think so
general 2022-09-21 16:51:42 Must be rare then
general 2022-09-21 16:52:05 I was in a tiger 2 and a apds shell from a British tank, multiple actually struck my ammo in the back of my turret and it refused to detonate

creations-chat 2022-09-22 22:31:32 The nose is just eh, you could’ve angle locked or camera locked something actually good looking but it’s just 2 blocks and it’s disappointing, kinda ruins the rest of the build. Also the grey livery is just, overused and generic and boring.
Overall well made build but a boring one.

general 2022-09-27 13:11:51 Let me have my ratel in the video
general 2022-09-27 13:12:00 the ratel was exported to nations in that region
general 2022-09-27 13:12:06 ratel 90 and ratel 20
general 2022-09-27 13:12:10 respectively
general 2022-09-27 13:13:21 not that big
general 2022-09-27 13:13:35 compared to their tanks it’s still sort of in scale
general 2022-09-27 13:13:42 The ratel is the size of a bus basically
general 2022-09-27 13:16:30 I’m not sure
general 2022-09-27 13:16:33 But it’s not that big
general 2022-09-27 13:16:38 it’s sort of in scale
general 2022-09-27 13:16:42 Maybe half a block too big
general 2022-09-27 13:16:48 any smaller and the turret would be impossible
general 2022-09-27 13:19:02 The ratel 90 is 9 feet tall and it’s 23 feet long <@448677698773057547>
general 2022-09-27 13:19:08 So basically a bus

plane-crazy 2022-10-13 16:35:19 ok
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 16:35:34 Anybody who says kid instantly loses the argument and I refuse to continue to argue
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 16:35:45 Because they have a mental aptitude of a 2 year old
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 16:37:21 Your ship in specific is terrible because the shapes are inaccurate, it lacks shading, colors aren’t there, no detail, the proportions are off and there are numerous other issues
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 16:37:25 Better?
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 16:37:25 There
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 16:38:56 I don’t know but I said that because the criticism applies to all of them
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 16:39:51 Criticism still applies
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 16:40:15 So it’s not a cr-90 then
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 16:40:22 Don’t call it a cr90 if it’s not a cr90
plane-crazy 2022-10-13 16:40:39 Yes I can

plane-crazy 2022-10-13 16:41:48 Me

creations-chat 2022-10-14 12:17:40 <@901190057648603177> add camouflage. A vehicle of that size wouldn’t just be flat grey it’ll make it a big practice target for any planes, also detail it more and *add weathering* vehicle of that size no matter upkeep would have a lot of weathering from general weather
general 2022-10-14 12:21:34 amen

general 2022-10-17 11:05:35 they’re meant to clip plane wings
general 2022-10-17 11:06:13 The ropes are actually high tensile steel cables hence why they annihilate your wings

general 2022-10-17 11:06:28 Tempest:

general 2022-10-17 11:07:56 All of them  are beautiful
general 2022-10-17 11:08:05 The yak-9k is one of my favourite planes
general 2022-10-17 11:08:21 If you know what your doing that 47mm can be a nightmare
general 2022-10-17 11:08:40 I shoot once and the bomber goes up into a nuke
general 2022-10-17 11:08:55 Inaccurate
general 2022-10-17 11:09:14 1 burst of 2-4 20mm rounds irl could cripple a plane permanently
general 2022-10-17 11:09:18 in the right situation
general 2022-10-17 11:10:10 do they have the uh
general 2022-10-17 11:10:13 Tempest

general 2022-10-24 13:29:39 The slate should be the ground and the walls and ceiling should be plastic
general 2022-10-24 13:29:42 💀💀
general 2022-10-24 13:30:10 Look at what I sent above
general 2022-10-24 13:30:40 Backroom builds are low effort imo
general 2022-10-24 13:31:14 No all of them
general 2022-10-24 13:31:21 it’s just low effort building
general 2022-10-24 13:31:50 It’ll look better than the ugly grass texture

general 2022-10-24 16:45:00 Tooti probably drives straight towards the cap in a heavy tank exposing his side and complains ground is bad

general 2022-10-24 16:45:40 It’s fun
general 2022-10-24 16:46:13 This opinion is false because ground rb is only as fun as you make it so if your doing that all round and are bored then it’s your own fault
general 2022-10-24 16:46:15 brawling is fun
general 2022-10-24 16:46:42 I average 2-3 kills a game brawling at 6.3

general 2022-10-24 16:49:31 like all of your opinions are what 99% of the player base DOESNT think
general 2022-10-24 16:49:31 noob
general 2022-10-24 18:50:03 I downvoted because the nose art is mid
general 2022-10-24 18:50:33 Eveurhting else awesome <@559568621312147476> but the nose art completely ruins the build

general 2022-10-24 19:51:37 <@559568621312147476> im gunna rephrase what i said earlier, i think the plane is really good but if you made the nose art just a little bit better, and also added unique squadron-specific markings or coloration it'll make it stand out

general 2022-10-25 00:55:50 Always liked AC/DC
general 2022-10-25 00:55:53 Blame Ironman 2

general 2022-10-25 00:56:24 I’m not like lactose intolerant people I’ll still go because I’ll hear the music without plugs or with,
general 2022-10-25 00:56:30 I just have sensitive ears
general 2022-10-25 00:56:31 That’s all
general 2022-10-25 00:57:03 Also mind you I’m not a huge metal fan
general 2022-10-25 00:57:05 so
general 2022-10-25 00:57:13 I won’t be going to metal-band concerts

general 2022-10-25 01:02:48 I think nas’s song took the cake this year
general 2022-10-25 01:02:52 Though
general 2022-10-25 01:02:59 Worlds
general 2022-10-25 01:03:21 It’s a big league of legends esports that is actually kinda good
general 2022-10-25 01:03:31 I love the art style

general 2022-10-25 01:05:47 restarting conversation
general 2022-10-25 01:05:51 hi rbk
general 2022-10-25 01:05:56 I have another verbal warning now
general 2022-10-25 10:20:51 I wonder if ammunition is modeled in planes as being able to be damaged
general 2022-10-25 10:20:56 IE: explode
general 2022-10-25 10:21:04 Weird
general 2022-10-25 10:21:08 it should explode
general 2022-10-25 10:21:28 No oil/water
general 2022-10-25 10:21:40 Planes can be anmoracked lol
general 2022-10-25 10:22:04 There’s a case of a Corsair having its ammunition in a gunpod shot and it exploded the wing off
general 2022-10-25 10:24:57 Kind of a shitty mentality to have about it, you should improve it and try again at hof. I’ll tell you the general consensus that was being spoken in vip1,
-nose art is rough
-lacks detail/markings
-no ordnance to make it stand out
-the nose in one spot is a bit rough, and not exactly the smoothest
general 2022-10-25 10:25:17 guarantee if you fix it you’ll have a better chance at getting in
general 2022-10-25 14:44:58 You can put any flag on a French plane though
general 2022-10-25 14:44:59 Lol
general 2022-10-25 14:45:16 I can make a yak-9 look like a German yak1b since it’s the same fuselage
general 2022-10-25 14:48:09 Weird
general 2022-10-25 14:48:14 I’m able to
general 2022-10-25 14:48:49 1 block wide throughout the whole fuselage
general 2022-10-25 18:16:55 What did the sled do to you
general 2022-10-25 18:17:51 AAM:

general 2022-10-25 19:39:23 finished it yesterday
general 2022-10-25 19:39:28 beat empress of light during the day
general 2022-10-25 19:39:32 where its an instant death
general 2022-10-25 19:39:35 no matter your defense
general 2022-10-25 19:40:10 normally she just brings you to 1 heart during the day on mastermode, but for the worthy, a seed that makes the game calamity levels of difficulty, its a one hit no matter defense or buffs at all
general 2022-10-25 19:40:23 literally a bullethell
general 2022-10-25 19:41:03 took me 22 attempts
general 2022-10-25 19:41:06 beat her yesterday
general 2022-10-25 19:41:12 next is moonlord
general 2022-10-25 19:41:31 i love playing anti air

general 2022-10-25 19:44:01 makes dodging way easier
general 2022-10-25 19:44:09 + it compliments a defense build best
general 2022-10-25 19:44:27 what calss
general 2022-10-25 19:44:28 class
general 2022-10-25 19:44:51 if you intend onusing bee gun aswell
general 2022-10-25 19:44:52 yes
general 2022-10-25 19:45:05 ranger doesnt use melee weapons
general 2022-10-25 19:45:09 ranger is purely range weapons
general 2022-10-25 19:45:14 if your using a melee then your doing mixed
general 2022-10-25 19:46:03 oh
general 2022-10-25 19:46:09 i was confused with the beekeeper
general 2022-10-25 19:46:11 mb
general 2022-10-25 19:46:43 your main weapons should be, starcannon, bees knees/bee gun (i prefer bee gun,) and minishark sparringly
general 2022-10-25 19:46:48 also get a new pick homeboy
general 2022-10-25 19:46:53 you should be on molten pick by now
general 2022-10-25 19:47:05 just get mana and bee gun
general 2022-10-25 19:47:11 bee gun is more affective
general 2022-10-25 19:47:28 pre 1.4 reavershark was good all the way to plantera
general 2022-10-25 19:47:31 was nerfed heavily

general 2022-10-25 23:30:31 togther?
general 2022-10-25 23:30:39 wait
general 2022-10-25 23:30:43 fuck
general 2022-10-25 23:32:10 your pfp has gotten worse

general 2022-10-26 13:37:49 they’re both pointy
general 2022-10-26 13:38:04 also banana isn’t optimal for strength and wouldn’t pen regardless of what it’s made of
general 2022-10-26 13:38:42 APFSDS is long and straight because it’s the strongest form, and the ribs serve to strength it in collision because they bend backwards onto eachother keeping the rod straight and preventing it from bending
general 2022-10-26 13:39:05 A, coated banana with DU and titanium will hit angled armor and shell shatter
general 2022-10-26 13:39:10 Purely because the inside is still banana
general 2022-10-26 13:39:26 if the whole banana was DU and titanium then maybe it’s a different story
general 2022-10-26 13:39:30 But it would still be a shitty round
general 2022-10-26 13:39:41 so no nana will not pen
general 2022-10-26 13:40:31 unrealistic for a tank gun
general 2022-10-26 13:40:33 but uh
general 2022-10-26 13:40:35 Maybe?
general 2022-10-26 13:40:42 Air resistance will be a bitch
general 2022-10-26 13:40:54 I can prolly calculate the pressure
general 2022-10-26 13:40:56 Joel on
general 2022-10-26 13:40:57 Hold
general 2022-10-26 13:42:12 Let me find scratch paper rq
general 2022-10-26 13:46:57 <@650085214705549333> to calculate acceleration I need how quickly it took to accelerate to Mach 7
general 2022-10-26 13:47:05 Give a general number
general 2022-10-26 13:47:57 just for sake of Terence
general 2022-10-26 13:48:00 refernece*
general 2022-10-26 13:48:06 Here let’s say it took 10 minutes
general 2022-10-26 13:48:08 there
general 2022-10-26 13:52:28 <@650085214705549333> calculations for a standard banana
general 2022-10-26 13:52:32 Didn’t take account the density and mass of titanium and uranium
general 2022-10-26 13:52:38 Because it would’ve been way too complex
general 2022-10-26 13:52:51 since varying densities and masses are a pain in the ass to work with
general 2022-10-26 13:53:24 you dummy
general 2022-10-26 13:53:26 I finished it
general 2022-10-26 13:53:31 physics god

general 2022-10-26 14:17:32 lol
general 2022-10-26 14:17:40 Desmos better
general 2022-10-26 14:17:57 I use desmos for all my physics shit for when I’m making custom stuff for role playing
general 2022-10-26 14:18:00 And also mathematics
general 2022-10-26 14:18:16 makes conquerers and starcraft strategies so much easier to calculate
general 2022-10-26 14:36:41 Do you know slope formulas?
general 2022-10-26 14:36:50 And basic graphing formulas?
general 2022-10-26 14:37:37 <@650085214705549333> show me your formula
general 2022-10-26 14:38:14 Use this instead: 

(x-h)^2 + (y+k)^2 = a^2
general 2022-10-26 14:38:24 This formula should work better
general 2022-10-26 14:38:29 And is more dynamic
general 2022-10-26 14:39:20 <@650085214705549333> let me know if that formula works for you
general 2022-10-26 14:40:11 Not a circle though
general 2022-10-26 14:40:13 (x-h)^2 + (y+k)^2 = a^2
general 2022-10-26 14:40:16 This generates a circle
general 2022-10-26 14:40:20 Desmos
general 2022-10-26 14:40:21 Graphing
general 2022-10-26 14:40:23 simple stuff
general 2022-10-26 14:40:40 No?
general 2022-10-26 14:40:52 it’s an unconventional equation
general 2022-10-26 14:41:01 Doesn’t use like standard circle formulas
general 2022-10-26 14:41:08 But it worked only experience
general 2022-10-26 14:41:30 ahh
general 2022-10-26 14:41:31 ok
general 2022-10-26 14:41:49 Should be a formula for that
general 2022-10-26 14:41:50 Hold on
general 2022-10-26 14:42:22 v2=u2+2GS(where v is final velocity, u is initial velocity, G is acceleration due to gravity and S is the linear displacement) assumes that gravity remains constant throughout.
general 2022-10-26 14:42:23 Yeah
general 2022-10-26 14:42:24 this
general 2022-10-26 14:43:44 hm
general 2022-10-26 14:44:05 yeah true because gravity differential
general 2022-10-26 14:44:11 Which would require another equation to model that
general 2022-10-26 14:44:15 yeah yours works then

general 2022-10-26 17:45:32 lol just brushes it off
general 2022-10-26 17:45:50 it’s weird?
general 2022-10-26 17:46:05 Begging to buy a design you can easily make yourself in plane crazy
general 2022-10-26 17:46:06 lol
general 2022-10-26 17:46:26 Imagine being such a skill issue you have to beg people to let you buy their work because you can’t figure it out yourself
general 2022-10-26 17:46:30 Like every other player

general 2022-10-26 17:47:04 Upvotes are meaningless now lol
general 2022-10-26 17:47:26 And? Your considered mid at building level
general 2022-10-26 17:47:28 lol
general 2022-10-26 17:47:41 Upvotes don’t correlate to skill
general 2022-10-26 17:47:52 Upvotes are a representation of wether people like your builds or not
general 2022-10-26 17:48:06 ??? I don’t make big builds
general 2022-10-26 17:48:07 lol
general 2022-10-26 17:48:13 Atleast for upvotes
general 2022-10-26 17:48:16 My last post was 5 months ago

general 2022-10-26 17:49:25 I don’t care lol
general 2022-10-26 17:49:36 all my builds I’ve posted are months old
general 2022-10-26 17:49:39 Dumbass
general 2022-10-26 17:50:04 I only play plane crazy now adays to make mechanisms my old builds aren’t a representation of my current skill

general 2022-10-26 17:53:30 no??
general 2022-10-26 17:53:48 I said it isn’t impressive because it’s overbuilt gah damn
general 2022-10-26 17:53:50 Learn to read
general 2022-10-26 17:53:56 Proof?
general 2022-10-26 17:54:05 self explanatory
general 2022-10-26 17:54:21 as in the concept is built too much
general 2022-10-26 17:54:40 it’s boring?
general 2022-10-26 17:54:44 it’s generic?
general 2022-10-26 17:54:57 And?
general 2022-10-26 17:55:03 It’s still boring and lame
general 2022-10-26 17:55:09 Because it’s more fun?
general 2022-10-26 17:55:38 I can I just chose not to because customs or hell fake builds are more fun?
general 2022-10-26 17:55:48 And I have control over things I normally can’t
general 2022-10-26 17:56:17 pug let’s see you build an accurate plane then
general 2022-10-26 17:56:22 oh wait

general 2022-10-26 17:56:42 exactly so then your headass has no room to talk
general 2022-10-26 17:56:46 On accuracy
general 2022-10-26 17:57:05 but you shouldn’t because everything that comes outta that mouth is embarrassing
general 2022-10-26 17:57:25 wrong use of irony

general 2022-10-26 17:57:46 pug your an embarrassment

general 2022-10-26 17:58:03 laughable even
general 2022-10-26 17:58:11 it isn’t fun

general 2022-10-26 17:59:12 fr
general 2022-10-26 17:59:19 I mean I know calculus like the back of my head but

general 2022-10-29 02:26:57 I just watched interstellar for the first time in my life
general 2022-10-29 02:27:06 one of my top movies
general 2022-10-29 02:27:09 Probably number 1
general 2022-10-29 02:28:02 it was cool IFV
general 2022-10-29 02:28:08 IDC*
general 2022-10-29 02:28:29 I am a sucker for anything quantum mechanics or stuff dealing with the dimensions of the universe it’s so interesting
general 2022-10-29 02:29:26 The movie was co-directed by a nasa scientist and the whole point was for the movie to be realistic from a mathematical perspective
general 2022-10-29 02:29:34 Shit like that would ruin the whole point of it
general 2022-10-29 02:30:05 Sure the albecurrie “drive” could “exist” but it was literally thought up as a thought experiment
general 2022-10-29 02:30:10 There is no such thing as negative energy
general 2022-10-29 02:30:30 But there’s also the whole of relativity behind them
general 2022-10-29 02:30:36 albecurrie drives?
general 2022-10-29 02:30:39 no
general 2022-10-29 02:31:30 it was a thought experiment made up to point out the fact that putting negative numbers into einstien’s general relativity equations produces negative but applicable results
general 2022-10-29 02:32:05 It has applied and worked for everything outside of the quantum level, which string theory is attempting to bridge the 2
general 2022-10-29 02:32:21 it’ll probably be millennia before we solve string theory so general relativity is the best we got

general 2022-11-01 00:00:19 he was mad
general 2022-11-01 00:00:22 and made me waste a 500%
general 2022-11-01 00:00:25 yes
general 2022-11-01 00:00:30 but
general 2022-11-01 00:00:42 i wasted a 500% because on average i score 1 base and 2 kills

events-chat 2022-11-08 04:30:08 Yes that’s how you do layered armor on mechs but it’s super cheaty and I don’t think it should be allowed

events-chat 2022-11-08 04:37:19 <:troll:1010751505982292041>
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:37:40 ok I go back to watching battlebots
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:44:05 I’m gaming
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:44:20 It’s bots given to you idiot not your own!!!
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:44:50 It’s the same as last time idiot
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:44:54 You didn’t complain then bozo
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:45:00 why are you complaining now
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:45:20 all bots from the 2021 season 6 are included, including bots on the qualifier rounds
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:45:28 so yes bombshell will be included
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:49:44 also if you make your own bot expect to be checked multiple times before fights
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:49:51 not having a round 2 of last event
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:50:34 <@466793357318815744> here’s my idea, I take chomp right? And I make it it a spinner
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:50:38 instead of a hammer bot
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:50:41 it’ll go ham
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:50:52 no reuse
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:50:54 Reuse is lame
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:50:56 Do something new
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:51:16 Me
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:51:19 I would’ve won but cheater
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:51:26 So I gave the win
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:51:55 your complaining because your trying to abuse loopholes
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:52:15 tooti sometimes you can be as annoying as symptomatic
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:52:19 Jesus
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:52:31 Now I know why I get y’all confused
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:52:56 Read
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:53:02 Stupid questions
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:53:15 if you won then no
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:53:27 hammers were not as fast last time either
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:54:49 I’m gunna be making a bot named PaK 40 and it’ll be my Abrams version of chomp but a spinner instead (gaming)
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:55:02 I’ll keep the really effective armor belt I made for chomp
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:55:51 take your argument to general bozos
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:05:41 
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:05:47 I don’t even moderate it
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:05:51 I just like bullying tooti
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:06:11 yeah rbk typo totally not mine
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:06:24 your talking?
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:06:54 or hear me out, I don’t care for grammar you absolute tongoloid
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:07:07 Walter white Jr headass @
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:07:20 more fun
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:07:27 Cutter armor should be banned though
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:07:32 Cutters can’t cut cutters head on
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:07:35 iirc
events-chat 2022-11-08 05:07:42 Only from the side
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:03 <@466793357318815744> so ive found minor issue
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:04 with torque
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:06 on spinners
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:08 heavy ones
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:11 what torque did huge have
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:17 beause i think the limit i set might be too low
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:28 1.5 makes any medium to heavy spinners impossible to spin fast
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:52 was testing the rules and found something
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:57 but
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:03:57 yeah cuz its big
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:04:15 when testing different blade sizes i found for heavy blades they spin slow as hell
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:04:32 your choice
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:04:35 i dont like rule bending
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:05:07 5 seems to work for me
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:05:11 maybe 7 max
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:05:12 something
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:05:13 idk
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:07:11 <:HOGRIDA:1006435257152716850>
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:07:12 oh yah
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:07:15 when are you back
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:07:19 i wanna show you the new armor i designed
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:10:29 ok
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:10:44 should we add a thing for
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:10:47 what class of bot
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:10:50 like spinner etc
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:11:01 i can do that
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:11:26 not sure
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:11:30 also i dont have an edit link
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:11:44 another row
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:11:55 ok
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:12:04 for ones that are multiple just put
events-chat 2022-11-08 18:12:12 "hybrid"
events-chat 2022-11-09 12:05:53 time to steal this design
events-chat 2022-11-09 12:05:57 <:HOGRIDA:1006435257152716850>
events-chat 2022-11-09 12:49:02 Yes but mind you it’s at rails
events-chat 2022-11-09 12:49:04 Limited space
events-chat 2022-11-09 12:49:18 And getting on the rails, even if it’s just a wheel starts the countdown
events-chat 2022-11-09 12:49:30 and your opponent can abuse your speed to launch you out

general 2022-11-09 13:37:08 no it’s 12 cents
general 2022-11-09 13:37:15 1 roblox credit = 1 usd
general 2022-11-09 13:38:29 1 ROBUX = 1 cent for purchasing
general 2022-11-09 13:38:39 and roblox takes a cent because of sales tax
general 2022-11-09 13:38:55 though weirdly ROBUX dev ex exchange rates are less than a cent
general 2022-11-09 13:38:56 It’s weird
general 2022-11-09 13:39:53 Have you seen the image of a bmp with a su-27 30mm gunpod ontop?

general 2022-11-09 13:42:07 Make an object 906
general 2022-11-09 13:42:18 Object 906 is a beautiful tank
events-chat 2022-11-09 15:59:46 you can do what rbk did last time
events-chat 2022-11-09 15:59:49 be the final fight
events-chat 2022-11-09 15:59:55 I was gunna offer to do that but
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:00:57 Pistons are allowed just don’t lock them
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:01:01 Otherwise it’s glitching
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:01:16 Or well using the glitch in combat
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:01:25 I wouldn’t use pistons though
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:01:33 Very easy to destroy
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:21:29 Good luck
events-chat 2022-11-09 16:21:44 If a bot is a heavy weight bot there’s not much you can do
general 2022-11-09 16:22:27 Doesn’t matter pvp servers are dead as hell anyways
general 2022-11-09 16:22:35 I’ll join a pvp server and only see 1 build

events-chat 2022-11-10 12:03:24 I would armor the top my dude
events-chat 2022-11-10 12:03:36 Just like ice wave last event you are just asking for a knockout
events-chat 2022-11-10 12:03:50 One hit to the top and that bot is going flying
events-chat 2022-11-10 12:04:06 Slow down the spinning
events-chat 2022-11-10 12:04:25 For a big spinner max you need it going is 20
events-chat 2022-11-10 12:04:38 Anymore and it’s inefficient
creations-chat 2022-11-10 12:05:40 no you didn’t mid af expert rank headass 💀

events-chat 2022-11-11 15:44:15 Besides fine tuning
events-chat 2022-11-11 16:32:06 I mean the hammer can consistently fling now
events-chat 2022-11-11 16:32:12 And it’s actually armored and heavier
events-chat 2022-11-11 16:32:51 what even is your bit

general 2022-11-14 01:19:27 they suck because theyre death traps for crew

general 2022-11-14 01:20:02 its much better if your crew survie because they survive with that experience, and they can be sent back out again

general 2022-11-15 15:22:22 it’s Russian
general 2022-11-15 15:22:25 By default it’s shit
general 2022-11-15 15:22:38 they design all their stuff with the T-34 philosophy as I call it
general 2022-11-15 15:22:45 Cheap, shit, and easy to manufacture but death traps
general 2022-11-15 15:23:07 it ends up fucking them over in the long time as they end up with lots of untrained crew as a lot of their crew ends up dying
general 2022-11-15 15:23:11 which you can see in Ukraine
general 2022-11-15 15:23:20 there’s a reason we focus on crew survivability over here
general 2022-11-15 15:23:47 You can heal a crew and give them a new tank as opposed to having to train all new crew
general 2022-11-15 15:23:55 sure it’s more expensive but it’s better in the long run
general 2022-11-15 15:24:07 hence no auto loader for the Abrams and crew survivability being forefront
general 2022-11-15 15:25:07 Abrams X is a technology demonstrator
general 2022-11-15 15:27:44 Did you see they were taking BMP’s, and other infantry chassis and taking t-54 and also t72 guns and putting them on an open turret and making them into tank destroyers, they’re absolutely metal

general 2022-11-20 19:48:42 not even a beta tester:
general 2022-11-20 20:08:34 tor m1
general 2022-11-20 20:08:58 its russian
general 2022-11-20 20:09:02 china just copied it
general 2022-11-20 20:09:06 like they do everything else
general 2022-11-20 20:09:18 (they have 0 original designs with 0 inspiration elsewhere)
general 2022-11-20 20:11:06 j20 is a copy of Mig's design for the SU-57 competition, and also uses stolen information from the F-35
general 2022-11-20 20:11:56 its a copy of the Mig 1.44
general 2022-11-20 20:12:20 https://aviationvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/J-20_Stealth_Fighter_MiG_Comparison.jpg
general 2022-11-20 20:12:26 whats funny is
general 2022-11-20 20:12:41 the mig 1.44 wouldve performed better than the J-20 if it was allocated enough resources
general 2022-11-20 20:12:43 lol
general 2022-11-20 20:13:06 yeah its because the chinese stole design things of the f-35 from lockheed during a hack
general 2022-11-20 20:13:09 thats why
general 2022-11-20 20:13:36 NATF-23:

contest-chat 2022-11-22 12:04:36 How do you motherfuckers do spring lock without it crashing you constantly
contest-chat 2022-11-22 12:04:41 I can only do tnt or disconnector
general 2022-11-22 15:23:49 no shit he missed lock
general 2022-11-22 15:23:52 Not really a big achievement
general 2022-11-22 15:24:16 it’s very hard to lock prop planes to begin with since there’s barely a heat signature to lock
general 2022-11-22 15:24:22 that maneuver kill was beautiful though
general 2022-11-22 15:24:42 Dunno why the clown was diving on a prop plane when he had every speed and energy advantage
general 2022-11-22 15:25:06 axxel 🐴
general 2022-11-22 15:25:39 Yeah
general 2022-11-22 15:25:53 I’ve had aim-54’s completely lose lock on me before in an I-16 type 27
general 2022-11-22 15:25:56 Just because I’m so small
general 2022-11-22 15:25:58 Same with the yak-3
general 2022-11-22 15:26:11 i actually have the most jet kills with my yak3p
general 2022-11-22 15:36:08 I maneuver killed a T-2 early in a yak-3p while listening to Rasputin and then proceeded to force a mig-21 into a turn fighter (the yak-3p is a turn fighter with 3 very good 20’s)
general 2022-11-22 15:36:10 He died

general 2022-11-22 21:25:56 yeah because nobody uses them

general 2022-11-22 21:26:07 i havent rode anything besides a subway in the past like
general 2022-11-22 21:26:09 12 years

general 2022-11-22 21:29:07 yeah and those are the only cool trains
general 2022-11-22 21:29:12 because they actually could do something
general 2022-11-22 21:29:21 sugma
general 2022-11-22 21:29:22 dnc
general 2022-11-22 21:29:39 in the ww1 battlefield they were hella useful when used correctly
general 2022-11-22 21:29:52 multiple times
general 2022-11-22 21:30:00 could provide heavy direct and indirect fire
general 2022-11-22 21:30:15 can be reconfigured to different missions
general 2022-11-22 21:30:19 and could carry LOTS of fire
general 2022-11-22 21:30:32 difference is, you have to drag out that individual artillery pieces,
general 2022-11-22 21:30:49 an armored train, a sufficiently defended one, can bring it all to one place fairly easily
general 2022-11-22 21:30:51 granted,
general 2022-11-22 21:30:55 it needs tracks
general 2022-11-22 21:31:05 hence the "used correctly part"
general 2022-11-22 21:31:12 the ottomans did not use it correctly
general 2022-11-22 21:31:40 then what do you do when you have counter battery fire
general 2022-11-22 21:31:46 it takes ages to move that back on a train
general 2022-11-22 21:31:54 better to have it in one place, on the train
general 2022-11-22 21:31:56 and move
general 2022-11-22 21:32:15 self propelled artillery didnt exist for the most part
general 2022-11-22 21:32:16 back then
general 2022-11-22 21:32:30 it was either towed, pushed or implacements
general 2022-11-22 21:32:53 you wouldnt have a train mid battle..?
general 2022-11-22 21:32:58 it would be back where artillery would
general 2022-11-22 21:32:59 y'know
general 2022-11-22 21:33:01 normally be
general 2022-11-22 21:33:04 *away*

general 2022-11-28 15:39:06 Skill issue
general 2022-11-28 15:39:10 Your like sympto
general 2022-11-28 15:39:20 You say a planes bad because your too lazy to learn how to play a plane
general 2022-11-28 15:39:33 every plane is good for the most part, just each requires a different playstyle
general 2022-11-28 15:40:14 I-185 (m-71) is the best cas
general 2022-11-28 15:40:27 good maneuverability and speed
general 2022-11-28 15:40:31 Good armament
general 2022-11-28 15:40:37 And the guns are incredible
general 2022-11-28 15:41:31 Do-335 is a funny plane I love watching people crash them because they don’t realize you need to regain energy after a gun run
general 2022-11-28 15:41:49 Bf109z:
general 2022-11-28 15:42:02 (I annihilated a whole entire enemy air team with the zwilling)
general 2022-11-28 15:42:26 It was 20 bucks last time I saw it on sale 4 years ago
general 2022-11-28 15:42:30 I’ve had it for a long time
general 2022-11-28 15:42:49 I hate people who do that
general 2022-11-28 15:42:53 They’re completely useless teammates
general 2022-11-28 15:43:06 Fucks up russian and German win rates at that BR
general 2022-11-28 15:43:16 Also people who don’t play anti air after their second spawn piss me off
general 2022-11-28 15:43:29 like no wonder cas kills all of you, nobody is doing anti air
general 2022-11-28 15:44:39 I prefer the bf109k tbh
general 2022-11-28 15:44:40 it’s so much nicer to fly than the F-4 at its battle rating
general 2022-11-28 15:45:48 Outturn low tier spitfires
general 2022-11-28 15:45:48 ta-152 my beloved
general 2022-11-28 15:46:07 No?
general 2022-11-28 15:46:15 you can fight spitfires pretty easily if you know what your doing
general 2022-11-28 15:46:18 Same with zeros
general 2022-11-28 15:46:48 A spitfire trying to energy fight a 109 with an altitude advantage is like caveman throwing rocks at an elephant
general 2022-11-28 15:46:50 It’s useless
general 2022-11-28 15:47:23 having the altitude advantage, which you should in a 109, over any spitfire will make you have a good advantage in a fight
general 2022-11-28 15:47:35 Just don’t let the spitfire drain your energy and fight smart
general 2022-11-28 15:47:37 Be patient
general 2022-11-28 15:47:55 with spitfires your best bet is have the altitude advantage and be patient with fighting
general 2022-11-28 15:48:04 Jumbo is good just don’t suck
general 2022-11-28 15:48:09 Never had to deal with that so
general 2022-11-28 15:48:11 /shrug
general 2022-11-28 15:48:15 They’re always lower than me
general 2022-11-28 15:48:25 I’ve killed them a few times in the ta-152
general 2022-11-28 15:48:32 Good
general 2022-11-28 15:48:43 I hate people who complain about the jumbo
general 2022-11-28 15:48:45 It’s good
general 2022-11-28 15:48:49 They just have a skill issue
general 2022-11-28 15:49:09 jumbo is one of those tanks you shouldn’t expect 100% immunity in and should play it like a medium instead of a heavy
general 2022-11-28 15:49:21 spot angling is your savior in the jumbo
general 2022-11-28 15:49:46 I’ve done work at 7.3 with the jumbo 76 hell I’ve done it with the m6 lol
general 2022-11-28 15:50:02 I am good at using the 8,8 cm flak 37 sfl for its intended purpose
general 2022-11-28 15:50:13 shot down 2 pe8’s in one match
general 2022-11-28 15:50:17 Alongside a spitfire
general 2022-11-28 15:50:19 lol
general 2022-11-28 15:50:51 I halfassed guessed the ranging for the spitfire
general 2022-11-28 15:50:57 Fired and it was right on
general 2022-11-28 15:51:09 I wish the flak 88 had actual flak rounds though
general 2022-11-28 15:51:16 Like the ones in warthunder are just timed fuses
general 2022-11-28 15:51:29 actual flak rounds are filled with metal balls and other shit
general 2022-11-28 15:51:39 And the shell is designed to explode a part like a shrapnel grenade
general 2022-11-28 15:51:58 if the flak 88 had a proper flak round it would be very good
general 2022-11-28 15:52:08 Hell if the bofors 40 or the German 30 had a proper flak round it would be good
general 2022-11-28 15:52:18 The ostwind’s 30mm had a flak round designed for it
general 2022-11-28 15:52:52 I use the flak as an anti helicopter killer
general 2022-11-28 15:55:05 First spawn helicopters are annoying it should be like planes it’s so unfair because there are no anti air first spawn obviously so there’s nothing you can do for the most part
contest-chat 2022-11-28 18:03:58 Still looks shit lol

general 2022-11-28 18:53:15 there’s a history of mods going apeshit here and quitting because of the degenerative brain rot most of the members here have
general 2022-11-28 18:53:59 💀
general 2022-11-28 18:54:09 I get joy killing an HSTVL because of how annoying they are
general 2022-11-28 18:54:34 I will sometimes manually pick off the hstvl’s modules and leave it dead in the water just to torture thwm with the bmd-4
general 2022-11-28 18:54:38 it’s so much fun
general 2022-11-28 18:54:46 I did it to this one HSTVL and he said lots of slurs
general 2022-11-28 18:54:47 lots
general 2022-11-28 18:55:00 kept destroying his barrel and tracks and engine in the bmd-4

general 2022-11-28 18:55:45 Aphe > apfsds

general 2022-11-28 18:56:03 So much nicer
general 2022-11-28 18:56:12 same with my t-55
general 2022-11-28 18:56:33 do you use it as anti air
general 2022-11-28 18:56:44 Or are you another useless anti air player
general 2022-11-28 18:56:46 Ah yeah
general 2022-11-28 18:56:49 Should’ve figured
general 2022-11-28 18:57:01 nobody at top tier plays intentional anti air and do anti-tank instead like idiots
general 2022-11-28 18:57:19 (top tier would be so much more fun if my teammates would play anti air for their intended role instead of anti tank)
general 2022-11-28 18:57:37 ADATS is gaming
general 2022-11-28 18:57:50 honestly I’m gunna be honest, I prefer gun anti air more than I do missiles

general 2022-11-29 13:28:51 Better radar and it can shoot pseudo-flak proximity rounds like on the MANTIS system
general 2022-11-29 13:29:15 ZSU is better for mountainous operations due to its low profile and high number of guns and the high firerate
general 2022-11-29 13:29:28 ZSU is also a better infantry support platform

general 2022-11-29 14:40:21 I@love the panthers
general 2022-11-29 14:40:26 Panther F is my favourite
general 2022-11-29 14:40:29 That and the panther 2
general 2022-11-29 14:40:32 I have both
general 2022-11-29 14:40:37 no
general 2022-11-29 14:40:40 They look awesome
general 2022-11-29 15:33:07 <@559568621312147476> continuing our conversation from earlier, I am a monster with the panther II/F
general 2022-11-29 15:33:15 They’re very good as long range brawlers
general 2022-11-29 15:33:26 Had it when it was available
general 2022-11-29 15:33:28 years ago
general 2022-11-29 15:34:27 No I only had the panther II, no tiger 2 10cm or coelian sadly

general 2022-11-29 22:35:08 (dont tell rickje)
general 2022-11-30 11:38:30 What is with the new trend of saying “NOT FOR LOOKS” when posting a build in creations
general 2022-11-30 11:38:45 like it doesn’t stop people from rating off of looks
general 2022-11-30 11:39:15 Pvp capability comes last when I build
general 2022-11-30 11:39:23 sometimes I’ll try and incorporate it but
general 2022-11-30 11:39:27 not worth it
general 2022-11-30 11:40:20 What map
general 2022-11-30 11:40:25 I hate a lot of maps in warthunder
general 2022-11-30 11:40:33 I miss the castle map it was so good
general 2022-11-30 11:40:36 I loved crawling in it
general 2022-11-30 11:40:50 Kill your
general 2022-11-30 11:40:55 I hate Sweden
general 2022-11-30 11:40:58 They’re so fucking busted
general 2022-11-30 11:41:36 I will play Sweden eventually for the bankannon because I love artillery tanks
general 2022-11-30 11:41:43 I wish america had the paladin
general 2022-11-30 11:42:04 not a proper artillery tank
general 2022-11-30 11:42:13 Assault =/= artillery
general 2022-11-30 11:42:50 yeah t34 is 120, t29 is 105, t30 is the 150
general 2022-11-30 11:43:12 I wanted tbe t-30 when it was available
general 2022-11-30 11:43:19 It would’ve been absolutely bonkers to play
general 2022-11-30 11:43:27 Brawler with the gun of conventional artillery
general 2022-11-30 11:43:38 I love brawling with the panther 2
general 2022-11-30 11:43:56 I have a solid 5 to 1 kdr with the panther 2
general 2022-11-30 11:43:59 It’s so good
general 2022-11-30 11:44:46 I remember the time I got a nuke at 7:7 with the is-3 and dropped it while listening to here comes the sun
general 2022-11-30 11:44:52 🤪
general 2022-11-30 11:46:13 I have a pretty even 1 to 1 kdr
general 2022-11-30 11:46:15 not that good
general 2022-11-30 11:46:27 But a few vehicles I do significantly better in because they fit my playstyle
general 2022-11-30 11:46:36 For example the bmp-1
general 2022-11-30 11:46:38 I love it
general 2022-11-30 11:46:43 I can do brawling run n gun with it
general 2022-11-30 11:46:44 And pop off
general 2022-11-30 11:46:50 Eh
general 2022-11-30 11:46:54 I prefer the m48
general 2022-11-30 11:47:00 Same general mobility for better gun and armor
general 2022-11-30 11:47:17 Your better off getting the marder first
general 2022-11-30 11:47:27 It will boost your sl so much because it’s such a broken vehicle
general 2022-11-30 11:47:42 and since like 100% of the rear is open you can do some trolly stuff
general 2022-11-30 11:48:00 And you can peak the secondary turret and use it to scout people
general 2022-11-30 11:48:12 That’s what I used to do, just peak the rear turret and scout people
general 2022-11-30 11:48:18 I’m 9.7 Russia and
general 2022-11-30 11:48:21 8.0 Germany
general 2022-11-30 11:48:32 and 6.0 France air
general 2022-11-30 11:49:31 America is good it just has to be played right
general 2022-11-30 11:49:39 Definetly requires more skill
general 2022-11-30 11:50:10 m60 is a brawler or a sniper there is no inbetween
general 2022-11-30 11:50:34 the object 906 is my favourite tank at 7.7
general 2022-11-30 11:50:40 It’s so broken I love it
general 2022-11-30 11:51:02 Gun-CAS?
general 2022-11-30 11:51:04 It’s alright
general 2022-11-30 11:51:30 I did it just for the 262 pulkzestörer
general 2022-11-30 11:51:39 That 50mm is godly
general 2022-11-30 11:52:00 like they took a ZSU-57-2 gun and put it on a 262
general 2022-11-30 11:52:13 L
general 2022-11-30 11:52:16 L take
general 2022-11-30 11:52:18 You like trains
general 2022-11-30 11:52:55 Wait there’s an
general 2022-11-30 11:53:00 Me-410 with a 50???
general 2022-11-30 11:53:22 That’s why I always sometimes hear occasional “boom boom boom” loudly in the skies at 5.7
general 2022-11-30 11:53:26 And wondering what it is
general 2022-11-30 11:53:45 I love the Stuka with the 30’s
general 2022-11-30 11:53:48 They’re so good
general 2022-11-30 11:54:12 Idk man I killed an Abrams through the roof with the Stuka that has the 30’s
general 2022-11-30 11:54:30 I use it for cas
general 2022-11-30 11:54:34 It’s good if you use it right
general 2022-11-30 11:54:41 I use it all the way up to 5.7
general 2022-11-30 11:54:49 That’s the one I use
general 2022-11-30 11:54:53 Sure it’s slow and loud but
general 2022-11-30 11:54:58 It’s good if done right
general 2022-11-30 11:55:08 don’t really bring it out if there’s fighters though
general 2022-11-30 11:55:37 but since it has inertia behind it since it’s so heavy, you can do some crazy stuff and get maneuver kills
general 2022-11-30 11:55:42 Upgrade your crew
general 2022-11-30 11:56:04 Your flying stat?
general 2022-11-30 11:56:11 Or just your G’s and tolerance n stuff
general 2022-11-30 11:56:38 It does look better
general 2022-11-30 11:56:59 But hearing the loud put put sound in the skies at 5.7 and not knowing what it is has been answered
general 2022-11-30 11:57:06 Idk it’s good
general 2022-11-30 11:57:14 I like cockpits that have a lot of bars
general 2022-11-30 11:57:46 give me a me-410 with the 75. It was tested
general 2022-11-30 11:58:12 The duck gets an air spawn in air rb and I’m a monster with it
general 2022-11-30 11:58:18 I love killing bombers with the duck
general 2022-11-30 11:58:22 Bring solid HE and just
general 2022-11-30 11:58:24 Go nuts
general 2022-11-30 11:58:44 They’re a push over
general 2022-11-30 11:58:47 never had an issue
general 2022-11-30 11:58:57 Don’t forget the duck has a lot of armor in the cockpit
general 2022-11-30 11:59:04 very hard to pilot snipe the duck
general 2022-11-30 11:59:45 I’ve taken hits to my cockpit from the marder’s 20mm
general 2022-11-30 11:59:52 No damage to the pilot
general 2022-11-30 12:00:09 We know
general 2022-11-30 12:00:12 mig-29 is coming
general 2022-11-30 12:00:31 The early mig-29’s were terrible so it won’t change the meta much
general 2022-11-30 12:00:41 Shit engines, shit guns and mid weaponry overall
general 2022-11-30 12:01:08 read what I said above
general 2022-11-30 12:01:18 There’s timers for after burner?
general 2022-11-30 12:01:21 Or is that an arcade thing
general 2022-11-30 12:01:25 I don’t like arcade so
general 2022-11-30 12:01:39 Oh
general 2022-11-30 12:01:41 Yeah
general 2022-11-30 12:02:11 Late mig-29’s however, they can take on multiple tomcats and win easily, very good rockets, much better radar, very good fuel economy, much better engines
general 2022-11-30 12:03:11 Btw I’m just gunna say this, at 6.7 I got 7 kills with the duck in one spawn
general 2022-11-30 12:03:17 almost had a nuke from my kills with my marder
general 2022-11-30 12:03:55 who
general 2022-11-30 12:04:08 Yeah because they won’t learn how to use it
general 2022-11-30 12:04:56 it’s the same 75 that’s on a pz-4 but with a longer barrel and changes to the breach,
general 2022-11-30 12:05:08 It has more velocity than the pz-4 velocity so it’s not hard to hit your shots
general 2022-11-30 12:05:42 1 75 he from the duck can cripple a b-17
general 2022-11-30 12:05:49 Haven’t tried it on the Pe-8 yet
general 2022-11-30 12:05:51 I will try however
general 2022-11-30 12:06:46 Being a fighter and play anti-cas..?
general 2022-11-30 12:07:00 being one of the yaks, they’re beautiful planes in ground rb
general 2022-11-30 12:07:07 assuming your playing Russia
general 2022-11-30 12:07:11 I love the yaks so much
general 2022-11-30 12:07:13 they’re so good
general 2022-11-30 12:18:37 smoke:
general 2022-11-30 12:19:11 Atleast it’s not helicopters
general 2022-11-30 12:19:14 I despise helicopters
general 2022-11-30 12:19:17 With a burning passion
general 2022-11-30 12:19:47 No it’s annoying fighting them

general 2022-11-30 19:01:55 If you do it just know I’ll target wyverns more in the chance of killing you
general 2022-11-30 19:02:25 I target wyverns religiously because they’re so annoying and drag on matches because they’ll just fly away
general 2022-11-30 19:02:44 Not to mention teammates are dumbasses and try to energy fight a wyvern
general 2022-11-30 19:02:53 Which is the worst possible way of approaching wyvern
general 2022-11-30 19:03:00 so I kill them before my teammates fuck up
general 2022-11-30 19:03:14 best way to kill a wyvern is to simply burn their energy
general 2022-11-30 19:03:21 Force a rate fight, even if your not a turn fighter
general 2022-11-30 19:03:38 The wyvern is fast sure, but it burns energy and struggles to gain it back due to slow acceleration
general 2022-11-30 19:03:45 especially witb bombs
general 2022-11-30 19:04:13 The only planes that can energy fight a wyvern and win reliably are planes like the bf110, xp-50, yak-2 etc
general 2022-11-30 19:04:16 You get the gist
general 2022-11-30 19:04:20 Twin engine heavy fighters
general 2022-11-30 19:04:25 hi queer
creations-chat 2022-11-30 19:05:22 Because it’s just suspension, nothing really unique about it, you should make it powered by an engine
general 2022-11-30 19:05:48 The Tunguska in question:
general 2022-11-30 19:06:33 I teamkilled a frogfoot in top tier with the Tunguska because he was trying to dogfight with a Milan and was letting the Milan annihilate our helicopters
general 2022-11-30 19:06:50 Aka he sucked so bad I put him down
general 2022-11-30 19:07:16 He kept chasing the obviously faster mirage Milan, and kept trying to turn with him
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:08:04 According to your rules
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:08:15 I can submit my ornithopter if I finished it today
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:08:34 and if my ornithopter was better you wouldn’t allow it
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:08:38 You see the point?
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:08:43 An exception for one applies to all
creations-chat 2022-11-30 19:10:22 I meant a proper piston engine with hovertrusters simulating a burn cycle
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:13:57 I don’t even care about your Apache
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:14:06 During the battlebot concept the same logic was applied
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:14:20 nobody was given the exception
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:14:45 Otherwise people would complain and say: “if he can do [blank] then so can I”
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:15:46 Also <@559568621312147476> since gam3 brought it up, your Apache is good just needs color detail and more hull detail overall, like squad markings, weathering etc
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:15:52 and maybe more detail with the weapons
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:16:21 The rear propeller is kinda crap but the main rotor is good
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:17:42 Oh wait nvm I forgot the Apache has a weird rear rotor
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:17:47 nvm ignore that
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:17:51 yah
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:18:08 he can’t

contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:18:36 it’s either you started it the day of or after or you didn’t
contest-chat 2022-11-30 19:19:07 <@448677698773057547> what livery should I do for my ornithopter

contest-chat 2022-12-01 15:03:29 Allowing bobas sets a standard that builds started just before the competition are allowed to be submitted
contest-chat 2022-12-01 15:03:48 if that standard doesn’t apply despite what’s shown then remove boba’s
contest-chat 2022-12-01 15:03:58 Unfair to give one person a free pass and not the other

general 2022-12-02 00:00:21 mines the amx-50 surblinde
general 2022-12-02 00:00:24 or the m103
general 2022-12-02 00:01:02 m103 is a post war heavy tank
general 2022-12-02 00:01:09 armor that could stop an is-3 even close up
general 2022-12-02 00:01:22 and the american ordance 120mm, the same on the t34
general 2022-12-02 00:01:56 wdym
general 2022-12-02 00:02:09 T34, one of the many prototype heavy tanks developed by america during ww2
general 2022-12-02 00:02:17 which culminated in the creation of the t29
general 2022-12-02 00:02:21 and then

general 2022-12-02 00:02:26 describe it

general 2022-12-02 00:06:34 or the t69
general 2022-12-02 00:06:38 both are virtually the same
general 2022-12-02 00:06:43 just slightly different turret
general 2022-12-02 00:07:42 because
general 2022-12-02 00:07:42 amx-50 is cooler imo
general 2022-12-02 00:07:43 bigger
general 2022-12-02 00:07:45 heavier armor
general 2022-12-02 00:07:58 and it has a gun that can go straight through the front of an is-3 from like 3km away
general 2022-12-02 00:08:01 and its big
general 2022-12-02 00:08:05 its so awesome
general 2022-12-02 00:08:15 the surblinde, the one with armor comparable to the tiger is my favourite version

general 2022-12-02 00:11:17 its a worse version
general 2022-12-02 00:11:21 the t69 is a better version
general 2022-12-02 00:11:28 bigger, m103's 120 gun
general 2022-12-02 00:11:41 and a taller profile

general 2022-12-03 02:24:44 and the only way i can tell is theyre ever so slightly
general 2022-12-03 02:24:45 vibrating
general 2022-12-03 02:25:09 man id be happy if rick just updated the game with the rewritten code and save everything for a later update
general 2022-12-03 02:25:59 and then you got mf's making this stuff somehow when i cannot
general 2022-12-03 02:26:02 gotta love rick!!!
general 2022-12-03 02:26:30 i might go apeshit and ping rick and like, force him at gunpoint to outsource his work so this game gets actually, yknow, done

general 2022-12-03 21:30:06 su-57 is a shit plane
general 2022-12-03 21:30:22 no no, its wanted.
general 2022-12-03 21:30:44 the su-57 is in production dumbass
general 2022-12-03 21:30:49 its just russia cant afford them
general 2022-12-03 21:30:54 just like a certain MBT project
general 2022-12-03 21:30:57 that has 14 in the name
general 2022-12-03 21:31:14 they used wood screws in the wings <:iskull:921404249764663336>
general 2022-12-03 21:31:29 production
general 2022-12-03 21:31:33 its in production.
general 2022-12-03 21:31:45 justneut try not to repeat things already disproved
general 2022-12-03 21:31:52 its in production.
general 2022-12-03 21:32:59 its in production.
general 2022-12-03 21:33:46 the only way to win against a slavaboo in an arguement is to just repeat the same piece of information till they get it jammed through their is-3 type beat forehead armor
general 2022-12-03 21:33:50 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
general 2022-12-03 21:34:25 they are, and will continue to be, just rare.
general 2022-12-03 21:34:29 russia thinks theyre common
general 2022-12-03 21:34:33 hence why the su-57 is shit
general 2022-12-03 21:35:04 dedicated dogfighters are designed inherently non-stealthy by nature because of their design being driven towards dogfighting
general 2022-12-03 21:36:51 pcc is pissing me off again

general 2022-12-04 15:40:33 ever
general 2022-12-04 15:41:17 make a wiesel 1a4
general 2022-12-04 15:41:28 literally a go-kart with a 20mm and "armor"
general 2022-12-04 15:41:41 im not joking it uses the sound of a distorted go-kart engine in warthunder
general 2022-12-04 15:41:43 its awesome
general 2022-12-04 15:44:17 
general 2022-12-04 15:44:23 ornithopter
general 2022-12-04 15:44:30 yes those are rocket pods on the top of the "wings"
general 2022-12-04 15:45:25 soon
general 2022-12-04 15:45:29 vip-1 doesnt work
general 2022-12-04 15:45:57 the rocket pods ontop take inspiration from the export lightning variant, the F.53 which could have rockets ontop of the wings
general 2022-12-04 15:47:02 ground attack
general 2022-12-04 15:47:19 lightning f.53 was mostly used for ground attack
general 2022-12-04 15:49:28 yeah the uh, f.53 can carry openable rocket pods that open like landing gear, rockets ontop and underneath, and rockets mounted on the side of the hull
general 2022-12-04 15:49:34 i think the total is something like
general 2022-12-04 15:49:40 150 rockets
general 2022-12-04 15:57:22 I LOVE IT
general 2022-12-04 15:57:23 i have it
general 2022-12-04 15:57:29 no
general 2022-12-04 15:57:33 its even better
general 2022-12-04 15:57:44 surbaisse in french, the tech tree version means "less armor"
general 2022-12-04 15:57:53 surblinde means more armor in french
general 2022-12-04 15:58:02 it has armor comparble to the IS-3
general 2022-12-04 15:58:28 its not that rare
general 2022-12-04 15:58:31 its rare sure,
general 2022-12-04 15:58:34 but not that rare
general 2022-12-04 15:58:40 i bought it off the market for 100 bucks
general 2022-12-04 15:59:11 e-100, is-7,
general 2022-12-04 15:59:13 and uh
general 2022-12-04 15:59:19 prolly the pak-puma
general 2022-12-04 15:59:26 yes!
general 2022-12-04 16:00:17 yeah thats the pak puma
general 2022-12-04 16:00:19 its very rare
general 2022-12-04 16:00:24 its very good aswell
general 2022-12-04 16:00:32 oh
general 2022-12-04 16:01:20 e-100 imo is just a weaker maus
general 2022-12-04 16:01:23 its easier to kill
general 2022-12-04 16:01:38 on the maus, just slightly angling the side of your hull makes you invincible
general 2022-12-04 16:01:46 e-100? you can be shot in the side even if your angled
general 2022-12-04 16:02:06 e-100 is the same br as the maus
general 2022-12-04 16:02:07 7.7
general 2022-12-04 16:02:17 i have the tis-ma
general 2022-12-04 16:02:21 one of my favourite planes
general 2022-12-04 16:02:26 tis-ma is beautiful
general 2022-12-04 16:02:53 yah
general 2022-12-04 16:02:57 they had insane range
general 2022-12-04 16:03:06 you should see the t30
general 2022-12-04 16:03:28 if the t30 with its 150 had its proper rangefinder and aphe rounds
general 2022-12-04 16:03:30 it would be a monster
general 2022-12-04 16:03:36 because it could cross-map an is-3
general 2022-12-04 16:03:45 basically the fv4005 but with actual armor
general 2022-12-04 16:04:06 t-30 was basically a t-29e3 but with a 150mm
general 2022-12-04 16:04:14 mind you not an artillery 150mm
general 2022-12-04 16:04:19 an anti-tank 150mm
general 2022-12-04 16:04:28 dunno why gaijin only gave it HE
general 2022-12-04 16:04:50 imo, T34 > t29
general 2022-12-04 16:04:52 just because bigger gun
general 2022-12-04 16:05:15 i like 120's
general 2022-12-04 16:05:20 it comes with maining russia
general 2022-12-04 16:05:40 it is
general 2022-12-04 16:05:44 its just a marketplace thing
general 2022-12-04 16:05:45 yeah
general 2022-12-04 16:06:00 in warthunder it only has HE though it *should* have AP and APHE
general 2022-12-04 16:06:05 since the armament is an anti-tank armament
general 2022-12-04 16:06:46 yah
general 2022-12-04 16:06:47 the first one
general 2022-12-04 16:06:51 but regardless
general 2022-12-04 16:06:57 t30 should get ap and aphe
general 2022-12-04 16:07:03 100% 1 shot ability
general 2022-12-04 16:10:50 idk
general 2022-12-04 16:10:56 i prefer the super pershing
general 2022-12-04 16:11:03 dont play the normal t26
general 2022-12-04 16:33:41 cone nose
general 2022-12-04 16:33:49 i do not understand doing wing-cone noses
general 2022-12-04 16:33:57 so much work for it just look
general 2022-12-04 16:33:58 rough
general 2022-12-04 16:34:09 and create too much contrast with visual texture
general 2022-12-04 16:34:21 yah but then you gotta do it a crap ton
general 2022-12-04 16:35:04 main reason i dont use it though is even for a build like this, i struggle to spawn in because motors keep resetting constantly
general 2022-12-04 16:35:07 so ill have to respawn like
general 2022-12-04 16:35:11 5-6 times to get a good spawn
general 2022-12-04 16:35:24 dont
general 2022-12-04 16:35:25 thats boring
general 2022-12-04 16:35:28 do the ta-152
general 2022-12-04 16:35:41 no it is for me
general 2022-12-04 16:35:46 oh
general 2022-12-04 16:35:46 doing tiny in
general 2022-12-04 16:35:49 lame
general 2022-12-04 16:35:49 motor 2 locking
general 2022-12-04 16:36:24 i dont like motor 2 angling because it just doesnt work for me,
general 2022-12-04 16:36:32 very high ping doesnt help because roblox hates my wifi
general 2022-12-04 16:36:34 for some reason
general 2022-12-04 16:36:54 wish it did but no matter what server i join i have a constant 10k ping
general 2022-12-04 16:37:01 and its not rare for it to spike to almost 55k server ping
general 2022-12-04 16:37:08 only happens when i join mind you
general 2022-12-04 16:37:19 yeah
general 2022-12-04 16:37:22 stoppers are better for me
general 2022-12-04 16:37:39 since everyones here
general 2022-12-04 16:37:42 what livery for my ornithopter
general 2022-12-04 16:37:47 im gunna steal one from irl helicopters
general 2022-12-04 16:38:27 no my ornithopter is supposed to have a realistic appearence
general 2022-12-04 16:38:32 yeah i dont use springs
general 2022-12-04 16:38:34 they dont help
general 2022-12-04 16:38:40 i just suffer with disconnectors
general 2022-12-04 16:38:59 tnt doesnt help either because exploding lots of tnt is laggy and i wanna be able to use a build in public servers
general 2022-12-04 16:39:34 did they ever fix tnt with blowing off parts of blocks
general 2022-12-04 16:39:38 because it still doesnt work for me
general 2022-12-04 16:39:43 it just destroys the whole thing even at 0 range
general 2022-12-04 16:39:44 lol
general 2022-12-04 16:39:55 only time it works is like
general 2022-12-04 16:39:58 once in a blue moon
general 2022-12-04 16:40:07 nono
general 2022-12-04 16:40:10 i know how to do it
general 2022-12-04 16:40:17 ive had help from boxness n stuff
general 2022-12-04 16:40:18 but
general 2022-12-04 16:40:21 it just doesnt work
general 2022-12-04 16:40:24 probably my ping

general 2022-12-09 11:51:25 it’s said in the Bible
general 2022-12-09 11:51:28 Rules are rules
general 2022-12-09 11:51:38 ok
general 2022-12-09 11:51:43 0 funny bone
general 2022-12-09 11:53:19 <:lo:1014604170449408071>
general 2022-12-09 11:53:33 because they’re para mili
general 2022-12-09 11:53:50 sure not a full scale operation but still para mili
general 2022-12-09 11:53:57 They wouldn’t use western MBT’s though
general 2022-12-09 11:54:00 most likely Soviet
general 2022-12-09 11:54:10 cheap, decently effective
general 2022-12-09 11:54:32 if anything they would probably mount IFV’s the most
general 2022-12-09 11:54:59 I mean maybe but they’re an organization to on that keeps the foundation on their toes so who knows
general 2022-12-09 11:55:14 Yeah but all their stuff is literally all Russian
general 2022-12-09 11:55:16 It’s boring
general 2022-12-09 12:14:58 I think it’s a skill issue on your end
general 2022-12-09 12:15:11 Every person I’ve seen who says ground sucks has a major kdr skill issue
general 2022-12-09 12:15:22 (they say it’s bad instead of learning to be better)
general 2022-12-09 12:16:02 Anyways

general 2022-12-09 14:51:01 
general 2022-12-09 14:51:34 Idk man I consistently one tap the Abrams frontally with the t80uk’s gun launched ATGM
general 2022-12-09 14:51:59 I do just as good if not better with gun launched ATGMs
general 2022-12-09 14:52:21 still bring darts With me though Incase I run into a smart player dueling me in a sniping battle
general 2022-12-09 14:53:04 Tunguska
general 2022-12-09 14:53:11 I love making helicopter players mald
general 2022-12-09 14:53:19 they smoke or pop flares and it does nothing
general 2022-12-09 14:53:21 Beam riding
general 2022-12-09 14:53:31 M50 ontos
general 2022-12-09 14:53:42 you sure
general 2022-12-09 14:53:54 Like 99% of helicopters I see in GRB just fly up
general 2022-12-09 14:53:56 And shoot
general 2022-12-09 14:53:58 that’s it
general 2022-12-09 14:54:02 no peeking strata
general 2022-12-09 14:54:50 I don’t like helicopters because grinding with the mi-4av is miserable
general 2022-12-09 14:54:54 Worst helicopter in the game I swear
general 2022-12-09 14:55:15 Shits so underpowered and slow and stalls out if you roll more than like 20 degrees
general 2022-12-09 14:55:37 Also it’s so unresponsive with my joystick for some reason
general 2022-12-09 14:55:41 Every other heli is fine
general 2022-12-09 14:56:05 yah but my issue is the mi-24’s get there before me lo
general 2022-12-09 14:56:30 in my mi-4 yah
general 2022-12-09 14:56:43 Every time I play friendly mi-24’s get to targets before me
general 2022-12-09 14:56:49 Idk why I’m seeing them
general 2022-12-09 14:56:51 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2022-12-09 14:57:06 even then if I do fix it I bet the ah1g’s are gunna get there before me regardless
general 2022-12-09 14:57:54 I believe the T-14 armata as a tank is fake
general 2022-12-09 14:58:07 I think it’s an aluminum fake ass hull
general 2022-12-09 14:58:14 Atleast the ones we’ve seen
general 2022-12-09 14:58:32 no I just like making fun of Russia
general 2022-12-09 14:58:35 because they’re so bad
general 2022-12-09 14:59:05 They’re ok, just Russia uses them wrong and they still design tanks like they did the T-34
general 2022-12-09 14:59:13 cheap, “effective” but death traps
general 2022-12-09 14:59:48 The reason they have untrained crews is because they keep using their tanks wrong which weren’t built around survivability, and that means all their experienced crews are dying as a result of misuse
general 2022-12-09 15:00:39 Western design focuses on crew survivability so you only lose the tank and not the important crew which can be sent back out
general 2022-12-09 15:00:50 same concept with pilots
general 2022-12-09 15:00:59 It’s easier to replace a plane than it is to replace a skilled pilot
general 2022-12-09 15:01:02 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2022-12-09 15:02:01 Fair but there’s still skill that goes into crewing them that is hard to replace
general 2022-12-09 15:02:22 Only the newer t90 has a different turret
general 2022-12-09 15:02:32 The T90A still uses the standard T72 esc turret
general 2022-12-09 15:05:39 It’s shit
general 2022-12-09 15:05:48 it’s shit.
general 2022-12-09 15:06:27 the T-14 is the same idea as the su-57, a tank designed to keep up with modern standards but the design behind it was halfassed
general 2022-12-09 15:06:44 also production numbers are low because the thjng is so damn expensive
general 2022-12-09 15:06:56 too many setbacks because Russia can’t afford to produce expensive designs
general 2022-12-09 15:07:20 no
general 2022-12-09 15:07:22 There’s only 4
general 2022-12-09 15:07:24 lol
general 2022-12-09 15:07:33 also the t-14 is mid
general 2022-12-09 15:13:02 TRUE
general 2022-12-09 15:13:11 Char-2C my beloved
general 2022-12-09 15:13:16 <:agonized:1037803417000751115>
general 2022-12-09 15:13:22 Why won’t warthunder add it
general 2022-12-09 15:13:24 I want ittttt
general 2022-12-09 15:13:33 shutup
general 2022-12-09 15:13:36 we know
general 2022-12-09 15:13:40 Nah
general 2022-12-09 15:13:46 Char 2c is a maus without the armor
general 2022-12-09 15:13:53 It would have a lot of crew that’s all
general 2022-12-09 15:14:00 The char-2c would be an awesome event vehicle
general 2022-12-09 15:15:01 Char-2c would be just barely taller than the maus
general 2022-12-09 15:15:06 would be awesome though
general 2022-12-09 15:15:15 could do 20 kmph so it could keep up
general 2022-12-09 15:15:22 It wasn’t shit
general 2022-12-09 15:15:28 It’s just France didn’t know how to use tanks properly
general 2022-12-09 15:15:31 against Germany
general 2022-12-09 15:15:34 they used them as Calvary
general 2022-12-09 15:15:46 As opposed to being infantry support platforms like the Germans didn
general 2022-12-09 15:16:58 the char-2c’s gun would’ve been capable of killing most panzer-4 and it’s derivatives the only reason France was ass at using it was because they used it as a propoganda tank through and through, and as a result had little experience using the tank
general 2022-12-09 15:17:26 the char-2c would’ve been effective to some degree in the beginning years of the war, since the gun is decent
general 2022-12-09 15:17:38 and it was fairly reliable aswell
general 2022-12-09 15:17:49 only issues it had was heating but was few and far between
general 2022-12-09 15:18:22 Yeah the logistics are shit because as I mentioned, France used them as propoganda tanks and had little experience in using and maintaining them and the logistics to use them
general 2022-12-09 15:18:46 not the tank, the crew
general 2022-12-09 15:18:55 the char-2c would’ve been effective at range
general 2022-12-09 15:19:09 you see the m3-lee with terrible armor and it was able to do well shooting at range
general 2022-12-09 15:19:12 Same concept applies
general 2022-12-09 15:19:39 True
general 2022-12-09 15:19:43 But they weren’t shit
general 2022-12-09 15:19:51 they had a niche, just a small niche
general 2022-12-09 15:19:58 what

general 2022-12-10 23:49:18 Someone should make the Panavia tornado with that car sized cluster munitions
general 2022-12-10 23:51:26 gr.7 is the smaller version
general 2022-12-10 23:51:29 Or sorry
general 2022-12-10 23:51:31 Better one
general 2022-12-10 23:51:32 To make
general 2022-12-10 23:51:34 The wings are bigger
general 2022-12-10 23:51:57 That or you can make the sea harrier
general 2022-12-10 23:56:30 I did
general 2022-12-10 23:56:35 Sea harrier is faster
general 2022-12-10 23:56:39 And it gets pave ways
general 2022-12-10 23:56:42 I think
general 2022-12-10 23:57:12 Don’t underestimate sraams
general 2022-12-10 23:57:16 They’re decent dogfight missiles
general 2022-12-10 23:57:31 short ass range and only rear lock
general 2022-12-10 23:57:35 But they’re decent
general 2022-12-10 23:57:37 Especially in a downtier
general 2022-12-10 23:57:51 I eat f104’s for breakfast  with sraams
general 2022-12-10 23:59:44 Fair but anybody can dodge a missile
general 2022-12-10 23:59:50 Just turn hard enough
general 2022-12-11 00:00:12 fair but it has speed
general 2022-12-11 00:00:16 It’s like the su-11 of 9.0
general 2022-12-11 00:00:34 Speaking of which the su-11 is good even at 9.7
general 2022-12-11 00:00:39 Against 10.7
general 2022-12-11 00:23:11 Skill issue
general 2022-12-11 00:23:20 They’re rear lock
general 2022-12-11 00:23:32 no for you

general 2022-12-19 14:50:10 And incredible speed and acceleration
general 2022-12-19 14:50:31 I don’t play it in sim
general 2022-12-19 14:50:43 if I play sim I’m using either a bomber or a heavy fighter like the potez
general 2022-12-19 14:50:50 most sim play time is with the potez

general 2022-12-19 15:04:00 Then again the Amx-50’s gun outranges and out pens a T34 and also can pen an Is-3 on the UFP

general 2022-12-30 03:24:00 unless thats the rafale

general 2022-12-30 03:24:57 on the mirage-2000

general 2022-12-30 03:28:56 (shit)
general 2022-12-30 03:29:34 why wont warthunder add the radar lead indicator for swedish jets
general 2022-12-30 03:29:40 literally the main reason tehy dont have tracers

general 2022-12-30 03:32:01 cockpit view should be where it appears

general 2023-01-02 00:09:57 i dont
general 2023-01-02 00:09:58 know you
general 2023-01-02 00:10:01 but ok
general 2023-01-03 13:27:14 Strf-9040 BILL is a better Bradley/warrior
general 2023-01-03 13:27:30 BILL missiles are some of the best in the game
general 2023-01-03 13:27:38 And the strf-9040 bofors 40mm weapon
general 2023-01-03 13:28:47 Honestly I prefer the Bradley over the BMP2M
general 2023-01-03 13:29:01 Purely because the Bradley has a smaller turret
general 2023-01-03 13:29:04 So I can just be a marder
general 2023-01-03 13:29:16 top down
general 2023-01-03 13:29:21 I mostly use IFV’s top down
general 2023-01-03 13:29:42 marder 1a3 top down at top tier is busted somehow
general 2023-01-03 13:30:12 ok maybe I was wrong
general 2023-01-03 13:30:18 but no one shoots my turret in the Bradley
general 2023-01-03 13:30:21 only the BMP2M
general 2023-01-03 13:30:26 anyways marder better
general 2023-01-03 13:30:32 puma with an ATGM basically
general 2023-01-03 13:30:38 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-01-03 13:31:09 the marder 1a3 sure
general 2023-01-03 13:31:18 the 1a is godly at its br though
general 2023-01-03 13:31:29 I think it’s the only IFV at its battle rating to survive an ammo rack
general 2023-01-03 13:31:46 In a brawling sense
general 2023-01-03 13:31:47 yes
general 2023-01-03 13:31:53 bmp is really survivable oddly
general 2023-01-03 13:32:09 And the gun is really good
general 2023-01-03 13:32:15 but
general 2023-01-03 13:32:19 The marder at range triumphs all
general 2023-01-03 13:32:30 Purely because it can hull down and turn into a strv-103
general 2023-01-03 13:33:03 I think they’re both on par IFV’s with different strengths
general 2023-01-03 13:33:32 to be honest I prefer the low velocity 75 over the bmp-2’s gun
general 2023-01-03 13:34:27 I prefer the bmp-3 mostly because
general 2023-01-03 13:34:32 Duel function gun
general 2023-01-03 13:34:48 main reason why the bmd-4 is my most played light tank
general 2023-01-03 13:35:06 Good and fast chassis  with the bmp-3 turret
general 2023-01-03 13:35:11 and the 30mm too
general 2023-01-03 13:35:31 Only issue is the front is like a tiger and not angled at all
general 2023-01-03 13:35:36 So it’s very easy to one shot
general 2023-01-03 13:36:27 I prefer the puma over the 2s38
general 2023-01-03 13:36:44 My main dislike with the puma is how loud it is
general 2023-01-03 13:36:56 You can hear it from across the map and people instantly know there is a puma up
general 2023-01-03 13:37:09 Yah but the puma has a very distinct firing sound

creations-chat 2023-01-05 15:14:31 Exactly, also there’s the issue that you’ll have to use so many trails to even get close to making it smooth and it’s still not smooth? Same with wings, I don’t think any aircraft with it is remotely expert rank worthy, your just filling a plot with repeating motorlock to make something mediocre.

general 2023-01-05 18:10:04 I have the German Sherman

general 2023-01-05 18:10:29 the German Sherman?
general 2023-01-05 18:10:30 No
general 2023-01-05 18:10:34 It’s not available anymore
general 2023-01-05 18:10:51 Yes it was only available on console but it was taken off sale a few years ago
general 2023-01-05 18:10:59 Jumbo 76:
general 2023-01-05 18:11:13 mad
general 2023-01-05 18:11:16 jumbo is good
general 2023-01-05 18:11:21 if you say otherwise you suck
general 2023-01-05 18:11:27 Angle:
general 2023-01-05 18:11:31 (And play smart)
general 2023-01-05 18:11:49 a well positioned and angled jumbo is a unkillable jumbo
general 2023-01-05 18:12:19 fair but in practice nobody shoots there because 95% of the time the tracks absorb the shot
general 2023-01-05 18:12:25 Also who angles that much in a jumbo
general 2023-01-05 18:13:36 I just put the elephant helmet decoration over it and for some reason everyone forgets it’s there
general 2023-01-05 18:13:44 76? Yes
general 2023-01-05 18:13:47 the 75 is fine
general 2023-01-05 18:14:05 Jumbo 75 should be 5.3
general 2023-01-05 18:14:13 And jumbo 76 should be 5.7
general 2023-01-05 18:14:24 Is it?
general 2023-01-05 18:14:29 It’s been awhile since I’ve played america
general 2023-01-05 18:14:41 yeah I do see a reason for a down tier
general 2023-01-05 18:15:26 Anyways my funniest moment with the jumbo was when I shot a jagdtiger’s gun and bounced directly into the ammo
general 2023-01-05 18:15:30 killing it instantly
general 2023-01-05 18:16:01 I’ve gotten good at bouncing off the underside of the tiger-2 and other tanks with similar mantlets
general 2023-01-05 18:16:17 What
general 2023-01-05 18:16:18 It can
general 2023-01-05 18:16:28 Yeah?
general 2023-01-05 18:16:31 Solid AP
general 2023-01-05 18:17:01 I either shoot apcr right at the plate weld
general 2023-01-05 18:17:05 Or just APHE too
general 2023-01-05 18:17:12 normally instantly detonates the ammo

general 2023-01-09 12:25:33 Remember when that dude imported a model off the workshop with an exploit
general 2023-01-09 12:25:38 And it was a hyper realistic tank
general 2023-01-09 12:25:45 and posted it to PCC in the PC map

general 2023-01-11 12:23:50 You have a diner too?
general 2023-01-11 12:24:03 I thought I was the only one with a local 90’s style diner in town
general 2023-01-11 12:24:25 Idk man but olympia diner goes hard
general 2023-01-11 12:25:06 <@448677698773057547> my diner in town
general 2023-01-11 12:25:08 
general 2023-01-11 12:25:12 Looks exactly the same
general 2023-01-11 12:25:20 hasn’t changed at all
general 2023-01-11 12:26:40 I wonder how the vtol f104 would work
general 2023-01-11 13:36:29 J-20 uses engines meant for a significantly lighter *ground attack plane*
general 2023-01-11 13:36:50 I.E. a plane that has most of its weight in ordinance and armor (the su-22m3)
general 2023-01-11 13:37:34 The Saturn engine is a very strong Russian engine dont get me wrong and it can make most planes it’s on super cruise but the j-20 is heavy and unconventional and it means the engine is not good in the j-20
general 2023-01-11 13:37:57 J-20 is a copy of the MiG 1.44 anyways
general 2023-01-11 13:38:20 The MiG 1.44 was a competitor to the su-57 and the resemblance is uncanny
general 2023-01-11 13:39:26 
general 2023-01-11 13:39:34 Clear as day
general 2023-01-11 13:39:49 anyways the j-20 is just an assembly of stolen or bought plans
general 2023-01-11 13:40:18 it is believable considering it’s not the first time MiG sold project plans or older plane designs to China
general 2023-01-11 13:40:25 or had their planes reverse engineered
general 2023-01-11 13:40:43 Yeah
general 2023-01-11 14:24:46 <@553754576709353494> hey

general 2023-01-14 23:55:19 ornithopter is finished, found a solution to the ping issue
general 2023-01-14 23:55:58 yeah but a solution morfix found is putting your main pilot seat outside of the build
general 2023-01-14 23:56:06 and locking outside of that seat
general 2023-01-14 23:56:11 and then getting into a copilot seat
general 2023-01-14 23:56:14 to fly the actual build
