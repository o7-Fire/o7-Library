general 2022-09-13 12:49:09 And teachers before 5th grade noticed that I was failing spelling tests all the time
general 2022-09-13 12:49:22 So they just thought I was stupid
general 2022-09-13 12:50:18 And would always pull me aside during spelling tests and give me one for the previous grade because they didn’t what me to fail
general 2022-09-13 12:51:38 Depends what I purpose the plane has
general 2022-09-13 13:10:42 Good point

general 2022-09-26 22:21:54 Honestly
general 2022-09-26 22:22:11 Joe?!
general 2022-09-26 22:22:36 Evil tentacle spider
general 2022-09-26 22:23:42 do you know who else has dementia
general 2022-09-26 22:24:00 I feel like the third wheel of this conversation
general 2022-09-26 22:24:47 Ahhhhh
general 2022-09-26 22:25:24 His b
general 2022-09-26 22:26:11 When the yes is no and the where is when
general 2022-09-26 22:27:26 I don’t even care when pc2 comes out, the longer it takes the more hard work and dedication go into it
general 2022-09-26 22:28:24 Bro don’t you remember what happened to cyberpunk 2077
general 2022-09-26 22:28:30 It was rushed
general 2022-09-26 22:30:37 Well you have to acknowledge that Rick has an actual life and can’t spend all his time doing what we want
general 2022-09-26 22:31:06 Honestly
general 2022-09-26 22:32:50 Plane crazy has been fine for years, just keep using it until pc2 has reached a quality that would be an improvement from the first
general 2022-09-26 22:34:36 I’m sure everyone is trying their best, Roblox just keeps making things harder to cooperate with and they also have to work with the stress we give them
general 2022-09-26 22:35:16 An impatient community can be hard to deal with even if it’s worth the wait
general 2022-09-26 22:36:24 Be thankful they told us in advance that they were making pc2, if they told us that there was gona be a red dead redemption 3 that would take years to do, people would be more impatient knowing, than if they were never told
general 2022-09-26 22:37:11 Half the community grew up
general 2022-09-26 22:38:50 I just play this game because I love making things with freinds, I have stormworks and that would be a fit replacement for plane crazy but I just love watching people get better and grow their skills in plane crazy
general 2022-09-26 22:39:25 I myself have not reached the skill of a lot of people here, I wouldn’t be able to win a single compilation here
general 2022-09-26 22:40:49 My roscale cars are the only things people ever upvote of mine
general 2022-09-26 22:41:02 And that’s because not a lot of people do them
general 2022-09-26 22:44:03 Also the thing I hate is the super high expectations that people have of plane crazy 2, they are just setting themselves up for disappointment because though the developers are trying their best, there are only certain things they can do
general 2022-09-28 11:46:45 Yo
general 2022-09-28 11:46:49 How y’all doin
general 2022-09-28 11:48:17 Yeah also the more information given the more impatient people get
general 2022-09-29 11:49:45 Hey, I know it’s probably stupid to ask for advice in a server full of people I don’t really know but I’m in a situation I need help with
general 2022-09-29 11:51:48 So I got this friend with anxiety and I usually help make him feel more appreciated and comfort him when he feels like a burden or useless, but recently he has been growing distant and getting angry at me easily and now he just said I thought we were friends and blocked me and I want to know the best thing to do in this situation
general 2022-09-29 11:53:43 Well it’s not that easy, we are online freinds, I’m in Texas and he is in Wisconsin
general 2022-09-29 11:54:46 Thanks, I’ll give him some time and wait for him to reach out if he wants to talk
general 2022-09-29 11:58:23 I’m sorry that happened
general 2022-09-30 13:01:34 Don’t you guys just love that feeling when some random dude with a jet in plane crazy just starts defending your bomber without you saying a thing
general 2022-09-30 13:03:41 Moist

general 2022-10-17 13:28:03 The one dude that had the first large cannon speeding around the map because he used all 10 bullets he had
creations-chat 2022-10-17 13:31:42 People waiting for the cooldown after someone roasted the hell out of them
creations-chat 2022-10-17 13:38:25 What this server has really taught me is that the only reason I thought I was good is because the best people stay in private servers
creations-chat 2022-10-17 13:41:24 Is that why I haven’t been able to get passed the “ok level” of motorlock
creations-chat 2022-10-19 12:04:41 POV: tried his best to achieve rank (he needs it to have opinions)
