creations-chat 2021-04-20 02:20:20 f-f-f-faaaaake

*no hacks, just video editing software*?

then how does it work? because it seems video edited to me, due to the fact that EVERY time you use it, the target circle appears on your screen for the same exact amount of time (unless its a continual video loop put into one file)
creations-chat 2021-04-20 02:23:32 ill go look


OOOOh thats very true.

hmmm still seems weird on HOW it works. confuzzling
help 2021-04-20 02:40:04 can someone help me make a blimp work without helium? (Sorry to be annoying)
help 2021-04-20 02:41:23 shouldnt not use helium?
help 2021-04-20 02:41:41 i have to do it without helium, its pat of the requirements <@!513499940924817408>
creations-chat 2021-04-20 20:02:21 can someone help me make my blimp fly? i can vc (and stream)
help 2021-04-20 20:04:09 can someone help me make my blimp fly? i can vc (and stream)
help 2021-04-20 20:10:26 yea...migs dont have guns. they are too fast, so they use rockets only. the plane would be faster than the guns, as their top speed is Mach 2.15. THis can be proven due to an unhappy incident in which a plane shot itself down. The plane in this case had a top speed of approximately 1.8 Machs. This plane was the Grumman F-11F-1, and the pilot wasn't even going top speed. This plane being much slower than the Mig which goes Mach 2.15, means that the Mig would shoot itself down.
creations-chat 2021-04-20 20:10:57 imagine being the first pilot to have shot himself down while testing a plane :/ scary thought
help 2021-04-20 20:43:54 Incorrect. The bullet momentum will NOT last forever. Eventually the BULLET will slow in speed and the PLANE will not. Thereby running into its own shots.
help 2021-04-22 19:53:23 as i continually pointed out in dms, you are incorrect. THe bullet LOSES momentum quickly.
help 2021-04-22 22:07:18 EXACTLY! thank you
help 2021-04-22 22:07:27 ill dm you about the convo if ur curious
help 2021-04-22 23:59:32 I was summoned?

help 2021-04-23 00:01:06 k im going 😄
general 2021-04-23 00:01:16 I was summoned?
general 2021-04-23 00:01:18 xd
general 2021-04-23 00:01:56 i know how bullets work
general 2021-04-23 00:02:22 what do you mean by that xd
general 2021-04-23 00:02:53 your welcome
general 2021-04-23 00:02:56 >:D
general 2021-04-23 00:03:12 I know that...I have guns
general 2021-04-23 00:03:20 why WOULD you tho
general 2021-04-23 00:03:26 many times the shells get messed up
general 2021-04-23 00:03:59 ok? My fams from texas, I was born in tennessee, we lived in Maine for a bit
general 2021-04-23 00:04:05 xd
general 2021-04-23 00:04:11 I know how it works.
general 2021-04-23 00:04:25 lets dm, this chat is so fast
general 2021-04-23 00:04:45 ooooh apparently since you built a gun, you automatically are smarter than everyone else in the chat
general 2021-04-23 00:05:02 then why bring it up?
general 2021-04-23 00:05:16 I dont need to build the guns to know how they work
general 2021-04-23 00:05:38 thats nice
general 2021-04-23 00:05:44 but building the gun is irrelevant
general 2021-04-23 00:05:54 the discussion was not how the guns were built
general 2021-04-23 00:06:02 so therefore, the built argument is irrelevant
general 2021-04-23 00:06:06 🤷‍♂️
general 2021-04-23 00:06:27 lol
general 2021-04-23 00:06:39 and that was MY point
general 2021-04-23 00:06:50 the bullet slows, the plane will catch UP to a regular machine gun bullet
general 2021-04-23 00:06:56 and if theyre a jet, theyll overtake it
general 2021-04-23 00:06:58 and get hit by it
general 2021-04-23 00:07:05 which is why they invented other types of weaponry
general 2021-04-23 00:07:16 like machine cannons and missiles
general 2021-04-23 00:07:28 LOL he deleted

creations-chat 2021-05-12 02:26:41 as ive said previously. This community is NOT good at choosing what is good and what isnt. People who actually rate based off merit get yelled at, and all the people who do hard work for little show get ignored. But, its important to note that politeness and respect should be upheld.
creations-chat 2021-05-12 02:29:51 ^^^exactly. People need to learn respect, and today's society seems to think no one needs respect. Merit is important, but so is respect.

plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:16:00 looks like the Kōtetsu but upside down
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:17:15 Some can, but it has to have a good crew
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:17:22 the poseidon advantage is range and health
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:17:28 but, one taipan can take it on by boarding
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:18:03 Also, the Tyrant is good against it
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:18:23 Tyrant is amazing if its used right, so is the cutlass, and the shark
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:18:26 yea
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:18:30 poseidon should ALWAYS be paired
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:18:35 preferably with a cutlass
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:18:42 to get speed and firepower with low crew count
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:19:16 I have to, but ofc it all depends on the helmers
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:19:30 yee
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:19:35 the ship is less important tbh
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:19:38 the skill is the big thing
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:19:49 the Binglehopper is overrated tbh
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:19:56 everyone overestimates it
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:20:03 its a new clad
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:20:05 the strongest
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:20:08 but slowwww
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:20:19 2 front cannons, 1 top turret, and 1 rear turret, with 2 swivels
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:20:26 and heavy plating on the center
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:20:47 the best way to beat it is to come from behind and shoot up the rear turret
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:20:52 lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:20:55 I used to be that way
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:21:04 I had lvl 10

plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:23:01 hallengard navy tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:23:03 they were like
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:23:06 amazing
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:23:13 before they all left to go to nova navy
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:23:42 Whitecrest
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:24:28 WCN was literally overpowered
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:24:32 they had the WORST players
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:24:36 but Nahr always gave them the best stuff
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:24:44 they literally ALWAYS had the advantage
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:24:52 yea
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:25:04 the WCN Retaliator used to be SOOOOOOOO op
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:25:08 it had the furthest range
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:25:15 and the most guns pretty much
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:25:17 and it was fast
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:25:22 lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:25:28 i was in 3 of the four navy's
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:25:36 did some pirating
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:25:38 etc etc
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:25:48 yea
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:25:52 well..not pirate
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:25:55 but they acted like pirates
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:26:03 they literally messed their own traders up
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:26:05 yea, invincible
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:26:10 takes 100s of shots to sink lmao
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:26:32 dude, NBN was the most annoying tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:26:37 I rammed them as a pirate once
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:26:38 and boarded
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:26:43 we won the boarding party
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:26:47 with 1/4 the amount of guys
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:26:48 but
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:26:52 they threatened to report us
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:27:09 because "team ramming is bannable" so they said that WE were abusing ram, but we were the other team
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:27:13 ikrrr lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:27:23 i used to take my taipan
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:27:30 and ram the kraken
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:27:31 from the side
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:27:36 if you hit it JUST at the right angle
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:27:39 the crew all falls off
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:27:46 and you can take the cargo with no one to fight
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:28:03 lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:28:08 ammo is cheap tho
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:28:15 if u use the loyalty tokens for it
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:28:30 bro
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:28:37 they literally made the sinks worth so much less
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:28:41 its not even worth sinking anything
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:28:52 and sometimes when they sink, the cargo doesnt drop
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:28:58 so you dont get anything
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:29:29 it is, but its rly bad
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:29:34 sinking the bingle, the best ship
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:29:37 gives like 2000
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:29:51 well, the bingle isnt the BEST ship per say
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:29:53 but its the second best
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:29:56 the best is the alliance
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:29:59 like 9 guns on each side
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:30:02 2 front guns
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:30:13 10 mil dbs to buy or smth like that
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:30:45 yea
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:30:53 sinking an alliance was useless too
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:31:13 good idea
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 22:31:17 i didnt realize we were here tbh
general 2021-05-16 22:31:26 hewwo
general 2021-05-16 22:32:06 lol
general 2021-05-16 22:32:14 dude, the taipan is like the BEST all purpose ship
general 2021-05-16 22:32:20 i will 😉
general 2021-05-16 22:32:37 the taipan is fastest ship, holds like 7 cargo
general 2021-05-16 22:32:42 literally no one can catch it
general 2021-05-16 22:32:52 but its also great for boarding
general 2021-05-16 22:33:04 lol, i think my Tl days are over...atleast for a bit
general 2021-05-16 22:33:09 i got alot of enemies in TL ngl
general 2021-05-16 22:33:45 nah but i made some of the largest pirate crews mad at me
general 2021-05-16 22:33:49 by killing their leaders
general 2021-05-16 22:34:16 i boarded a fully manned tyrant...by fully manned i mean 9 or 10 guys
general 2021-05-16 22:34:23 and the first guy i charged was the helmer
general 2021-05-16 22:34:28 turned out the helmer was the leader
general 2021-05-16 22:34:30 and i killed him
general 2021-05-16 22:34:34 so they were all mad
general 2021-05-16 22:34:40 yeee
general 2021-05-16 22:34:46 but you only wanna trade between certain islands
general 2021-05-16 22:34:59 yea
general 2021-05-16 22:35:20 i suggest Nassau to Salem to Harrisburg to Nassau
general 2021-05-16 22:35:35 Nova trades became crap
general 2021-05-16 22:35:39 once nass was added
general 2021-05-16 22:35:55 yee
general 2021-05-16 22:36:15 if you do it at the right time, you can get like 160 from Nass to Salem
general 2021-05-16 22:36:31 but as a pirate, if you grab the right cargo and sell at the right ports you can get 400 per cargo
general 2021-05-16 22:36:48 lol
general 2021-05-16 22:37:02 man these 2 like five year olds
general 2021-05-16 22:37:12 because of Apple and Epicgames
general 2021-05-16 22:37:38 ngl
general 2021-05-16 22:37:38 dagger is hella good with the right player
general 2021-05-16 22:37:41 i used to use it
general 2021-05-16 22:37:46 i beat a katana
general 2021-05-16 22:37:51 with a frosteel dagger
general 2021-05-16 22:38:38 Apple accused Epicgames of being an appstore, so Epicgames in turn accused Roblox in front of apple, so Roblox then stated that they werent selling games, and changed Games to Discover to get Epicgames and thus Apple of their back. <@!461639155911229440>
general 2021-05-16 22:39:02 mhm
general 2021-05-16 22:39:54 they do, but it only works for swivels
general 2021-05-16 22:40:04 swivels are basically shotgun cannons, for killing crew
general 2021-05-16 22:40:08 really small things
general 2021-05-16 22:40:15 yea
general 2021-05-16 22:40:18 but SUPER SUPER short range
general 2021-05-16 22:40:22 like...unbelievably short
general 2021-05-16 22:40:25 ikr
general 2021-05-16 22:40:38 theres an easier way to take out their manueverability tho
general 2021-05-16 22:40:43 if you shoot the rudder they cant turn
general 2021-05-16 22:40:45 lol
general 2021-05-16 22:40:58 nahhh
general 2021-05-16 22:41:03 waterline is the BEST place to shoot
general 2021-05-16 22:41:05 highest damage
general 2021-05-16 22:41:11 theyre usually half way,
general 2021-05-16 22:41:17 half way underwater, half way above
general 2021-05-16 22:42:14 yea
general 2021-05-16 22:42:25 but then the ottoman started setting their ships on fire and ramming
general 2021-05-16 22:42:26 >:D
general 2021-05-16 22:42:28 big brain move
general 2021-05-16 22:42:32 they should let TL do that
general 2021-05-16 22:43:08 Ancient kamakaziiii

plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:42:26 Freedom of speech actually does not apply to discord since it is privately owned.
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:43:00 Its considered private property owned by the company, and by the people in charge of the server. They are allowed by law to moderate whatever the hell they want, whether its fair or not
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:43:12 same goes with facebook, instagram, and every other form of online communication
general 2021-05-17 02:43:43 literally me. a mad alpaca
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 02:43:51 have fun?
general 2021-05-17 02:45:24 imma settle this quickly. <@456226577798135808> go get help from a trained psychiatrist, you are talking to a bunch of idiots for advice and expecting idiots like me to remember things from a month ago. If you need help, seek GOOD help, not us.
general 2021-05-17 02:46:06 We should simply leave him to get professional help
general 2021-05-17 02:46:08 he doesnt need us.
general 2021-05-17 02:46:15 we wont be able to help him
general 2021-05-17 02:46:31 theres a reason they train people for this
general 2021-05-17 02:46:47 leave it be, you dont want to be part of this
general 2021-05-17 02:47:04 he needs professional help, not our help. just leave him to get help
general 2021-05-17 02:47:57 Guys, literally
general 2021-05-17 02:48:02 just let him get professional help
general 2021-05-17 02:48:07 because WE cannot help him
general 2021-05-17 02:48:09 just dip guys
general 2021-05-17 02:48:17 if doctors cant help, we sure as hell cant
general 2021-05-17 02:48:24 ^^^^
general 2021-05-17 02:49:01 there are meds to make it a little better
general 2021-05-17 02:49:08 literally just leave gim to get real help
general 2021-05-17 02:49:12 we arent doctors
general 2021-05-17 02:49:14 we are idiots
general 2021-05-17 02:50:49 we arent psychiatrists
general 2021-05-17 02:50:51 dont come to us
general 2021-05-17 02:50:56 we are in the same situation as you
general 2021-05-17 02:50:58 atleast most of us
general 2021-05-17 02:51:53 Go get a psychiatrist bro
general 2021-05-17 02:51:57 itll help alot more than we can
general 2021-05-17 02:52:53 exactly
general 2021-05-17 02:53:10 wyou gonna take that chance?
general 2021-05-17 02:53:19 stop actin like an ass, let him get help if he needs it
general 2021-05-17 02:56:41 Why wouldnt we?
general 2021-05-17 02:56:45 🤷
general 2021-05-17 02:57:17 I'd rather try to keep my family and friends safe if possible, even if it risks myself.
general 2021-05-17 02:57:25 We may not get sick, but we can still spread it
general 2021-05-17 02:57:34 you can spread it without feeling the symptoms
general 2021-05-17 02:57:44 I just want to keep my family and friends safe
general 2021-05-17 02:58:40 That is such a stupid idea.
general 2021-05-17 02:58:53 and we kill thousands.
general 2021-05-17 02:59:03 and there is the potential for the virus to MUTATE
general 2021-05-17 02:59:06 and spread AGAIN
general 2021-05-17 02:59:31 dumb moment
general 2021-05-17 02:59:34 ^^^
general 2021-05-17 02:59:38 exactlyyy
general 2021-05-17 02:59:53 the longer you let a virus live the more chance it has to mutate and overcome immunity
general 2021-05-17 03:00:37 800,000,000,000 people
general 2021-05-17 03:00:50 thats stupid
general 2021-05-17 03:01:02 if you include factors of mutation
general 2021-05-17 03:01:05 assuming everyone gets it
general 2021-05-17 03:01:08 lol
general 2021-05-17 03:01:12 many people could dieeee
general 2021-05-17 03:01:59 1 trillion people on earth
general 2021-05-17 03:02:01 times .3
general 2021-05-17 03:02:19 and even if it werent. the earth needs farmers
general 2021-05-17 03:02:22 and factory workers
general 2021-05-17 03:02:23 etc
general 2021-05-17 03:02:37 herd immunity is stupidity
general 2021-05-17 03:02:48 lol
general 2021-05-17 03:03:21 the battle of the socially distanced
general 2021-05-17 03:03:30 thats...not true
general 2021-05-17 03:04:16 not because there isnt enough food, but because it isnt distributed well, yes, BUT, we manage to have more kids than the amount of people that die
general 2021-05-17 03:04:18 quite often
general 2021-05-17 03:04:44 exactly
general 2021-05-17 03:05:02 which means our species is QUITE GOOD at maintaining high populations
general 2021-05-17 03:05:08 LOL tell that to the squirrels
general 2021-05-17 03:05:29 there often have been gay squirrels just saying
general 2021-05-17 03:05:44 ^^
general 2021-05-17 03:06:27 with more curves 😉 hey there gorgeous JKKKKKKK
general 2021-05-17 03:06:48 lets just say, we are but we arent
general 2021-05-17 03:06:58 we...are mammals
general 2021-05-17 03:07:05 we produce milk
general 2021-05-17 03:07:07 we are mammals
general 2021-05-17 03:07:16 we have live child births
general 2021-05-17 03:07:19 we are mammals
general 2021-05-17 03:07:21 lol
general 2021-05-17 03:07:38 we have the characteristics of mammals
general 2021-05-17 03:07:39 therefore
general 2021-05-17 03:07:43 we classify as mammals
general 2021-05-17 03:08:10 Humans are animals, but we are high functioning
general 2021-05-17 03:08:46 we consider ourselves a "higher form" of animals
general 2021-05-17 03:08:52 but not because we are super biologically different
general 2021-05-17 03:08:57 but because we have higher capacity
general 2021-05-17 03:09:17 we have higher brain function, higher awareness, ability to communicate, philosophical ability
general 2021-05-17 03:09:27 things that most animals do not have
general 2021-05-17 03:09:29 but we ARE animals
general 2021-05-17 03:09:40 so? my dog doesnt like dog food...
general 2021-05-17 03:09:57 animals can have likes and dislikes
general 2021-05-17 03:10:05 my cat doesnt like being picked up, while other cats do
general 2021-05-17 03:10:12 they can have preferences
general 2021-05-17 03:10:20 the difference is they act GENERALLY on instinct
general 2021-05-17 03:10:26 we have higher reasoning
general 2021-05-17 03:10:28 but we are still
general 2021-05-17 03:10:31 biologically
general 2021-05-17 03:10:40 some animals can be
general 2021-05-17 03:10:42 but most arent
general 2021-05-17 03:11:01 hahha
general 2021-05-17 03:11:07 neither are squirrels
general 2021-05-17 03:11:15 theres a reason animals can have children
general 2021-05-17 03:11:20 because they arent all homosexual
general 2021-05-17 03:11:25 literally
general 2021-05-17 03:11:32 homosexuality doesnt make anything more or less human
general 2021-05-17 03:11:49 its not a good one
general 2021-05-17 03:11:53 its completely unfounded
general 2021-05-17 03:11:55 and unexplained
general 2021-05-17 03:12:03 but its not applicable
general 2021-05-17 03:12:32 animal is a term based off biology
general 2021-05-17 03:12:35 not mental status
general 2021-05-17 03:12:42 in biological terms we are animals
general 2021-05-17 03:12:48 we are simply high functioning animals
general 2021-05-17 03:12:57 the term animal applies to us BECAUSE we fit within the definition
general 2021-05-17 03:13:09 idk why you dont see that
general 2021-05-17 03:13:32 its...not
general 2021-05-17 03:13:41 everyone else seems to understand...
general 2021-05-17 03:14:19 lol

plane-crazy 2021-05-17 20:31:36 Maybe you should take your own plea, and leave OTHERS alone.
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 20:31:58 if you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone. I'm not being mean to you, i'm being straightforward, because that is what you need.
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 20:32:17 Ya can't pick fights with people then get upset when they strike back.
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 20:33:04 If you are already mad, why you taking it out on everyone.
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 20:33:12 Go get a therapist, dont vent your rage here.
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 20:33:52 I don't care how many you see, this isn't the place to vent on everyone.
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 20:34:01 You need to learn to control your own anger.
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 20:35:40 Everyone else works to control their anger, I don't need your life story, what you are dealing with, because I can't help you. I'm not a therapist, I'm not a friend, I'm just some rando. If you need to vent, find somewhere appropriate to vent because this is not the place, man.

the-dump 2021-05-17 21:12:51 its better to have laws limiting bullet bullet count and clip size
