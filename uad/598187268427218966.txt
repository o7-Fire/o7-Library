creations-chat 2022-04-11 14:08:43 no
creations-chat 2022-04-11 14:11:26 Because I put high graphics to make it more clear but at that cost means i get more render distance so I cant really take it out of the picture cuz he was building at the same time.
creations-chat 2022-04-11 14:13:12 I do, I just like to explain things in a serious way to make the situation funnier for the people to laugh at. <:pain:644301805534183464>
creations-chat 2022-04-11 14:15:25 Yeah, I do, this is just my comedy xD

creations-chat 2022-04-19 10:42:03 why do people hate builds that arent roscale again
creations-chat 2022-04-22 18:06:13 work in progress jaeger with a new arm cuz i thought it would be cool to have a different arm that looks like it shouldnt fit on the body
creations-chat 2022-04-22 18:07:57 the original idea for the jeager was to be able to slap people with it so i wouldnt have to fit on a weapon cuz pie

also cuz funny
creations-chat 2022-04-22 18:12:39 To be fair, it's meant to be. If you watch Pacific Rim the jaegers' proportions are fucked up.
creations-chat 2022-04-22 18:14:52 say that again
creations-chat 2022-04-22 18:16:43 fair enough

i think we can all pretend that the 2nd film doesnt exist

creations-chat 2022-04-22 18:39:46 dam daniel
creations-chat 2022-04-22 20:41:21 Probably gonna name it smth like "Project Sunshine" or smth
creations-chat 2022-04-22 20:44:32 well there is already Cayote Tango so it sounds like they are related but they really arent

Project Sunshine is an mk 3
creations-chat 2022-04-22 20:46:17 mk 3 as in mark 3 jaeger
creations-chat 2022-04-22 20:48:29 just mark 3 (watch the movie / the series then you can understand)

it basically just means its strength and technology
creations-chat 2022-04-22 20:50:40 man looks like hes 3
creations-chat 2022-04-22 20:52:54 i did this, it did have cannons and a head but i deleted it and this is the last pic
creations-chat 2022-04-22 20:54:39 stupid old jaeger build, it was the front of the upper body / chest
creations-chat 2022-04-22 20:56:45 thats for sure mate
creations-chat 2022-04-22 20:58:31 do i post this mf when its done
creations-chat 2022-04-22 21:00:13 Do you mean it looks like a specific one or it just has the same style as delta?
creations-chat 2022-04-22 21:02:03 idk if im going insane or not but i dont see the resemblance  apart from the lime highlights
creations-chat 2022-04-22 21:04:03 well i must admit, i did have delta as an inspiration during my earlier times of building mechs so it sorta shows in my newer mechs (this pic is one of my oldest mechs)
creations-chat 2022-04-22 21:05:47 id about you but cars look mostly like shit to me
creations-chat 2022-04-22 21:07:33 sit back and relax, **JEREMY GET THE POPCORN**
creations-chat 2022-04-22 21:09:16 youre new to this community, if someone doesnt like something its gonna get downvote bombed cuz people too stupid to vote with their own functioning mind so they vote for whatever has more votes

creations-chat 2022-04-22 21:27:31 cope, seethe, mald, cry about it
creations-chat 2022-04-22 21:40:57 mf deserves it
creations-chat 2022-04-23 18:08:44 Aye, don't give a shit about this dude. He just says everything is horrible. Lol

It's funny cuz you shouldn't waste your time on him.
creations-chat 2022-04-23 18:11:19 Honestly, I think its really good. You may want to try making the tones of green on the grass  (specifically the lighter green) a bit darker to blend in more. I think you did an amazing job on it though. <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2022-04-23 18:13:35 I recommend trying to mix the floor's material to be a mix of sand, slate and  cobblestone. You may need to change the tones a bit (lower the red RGB code for cobble stone) but if you do it correctly, it should work well with the style of the build.
creations-chat 2022-04-23 18:15:32 K, still looks great though! Good job, keep it up :D

The style of the build reminds me of my medieval trading district lol
creations-chat 2022-04-23 18:18:09 I'm not necessarily pissed, just try and refrain from making a clown of yourself by calling others dumbasses for a simple mistake.
creations-chat 2022-04-23 18:19:54 Man's giving a good point, saying everything is horrible when you (most-likely) can't do anything half as good is stupid.
creations-chat 2022-04-23 18:21:52 I'm just trying to help this dude, I don't see why you have to be so negative about every build you see. lol
creations-chat 2022-04-23 18:23:34 He ain't stinky. He's just stupid. <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2022-04-23 18:25:24 Try adding more foliage in general.
creations-chat 2022-04-23 18:29:05 Do I finish this or nah
creations-chat 2022-04-23 18:30:49 or do I remake the road on this and remake the interior on this

creations-chat 2022-05-05 12:58:42 It's a troll mech, I don't get how your feeble mind didn't quite catch that from the bo*bs.
creations-chat 2022-05-05 13:00:53 Wasn't meant to.
creations-chat 2022-05-05 13:04:09 amazing

really represents how far we have come.
creations-chat 2022-05-05 13:05:57 Good but using the same tone of blue all over makes it look a tad bit off, try using shades of blue to make  it pop out more.

general 2022-05-05 17:35:14 You're the type of guy to use "Discord mod" as an insult in 2022.

general 2022-05-05 17:37:25 Imagine not being able to write a whole novel for a book about warfare.
general 2022-05-05 17:37:29 Rather cringe.
general 2022-05-05 17:37:42 Primary school, is that?
general 2022-05-05 17:38:16 No you learn it in primary
general 2022-05-05 17:38:52 when I was in primary you learnt French almost every day
general 2022-05-05 17:39:40 Okay, remember you're the kid who thinks grammar is essential and asks for someone who is hated by almost everyone to get banned for saying to "go die".
general 2022-05-05 17:40:35 amazing

creations-chat 2022-05-05 20:42:29 looks odd
the painting is shit
creations-chat 2022-05-05 20:44:49 ah, I see

All I can necessarily suggest is using  RGB pickers, the stage of the game you're at (in this period of time) is too early to be learning complicated color codes.
creations-chat 2022-05-05 20:46:59 The intervals between codes, in my opinion, should be about 5.

creations-chat 2022-05-06 22:00:51 I honestly agree, I have a full essay on stupidity and I would‚Äôve used it if this server had no rules. This is the bare minimum standard for me lmao

creations-chat 2022-05-18 15:49:47 time to remake this mother fucker
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:12:13 Nah, it just looks ugly in general. The shape down to the coloring; it looks like shit. I could see underaged accounts build better than that horseshit.
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:14:11 friends? Friends? You think **FRIENDS** matter in this server? If you cant take insults you need to learn how to cope more.
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:19:42 You need to shut your brain-dead, bone-shackling, feeble-minded imbecile of a soul before I begin to become absolutely dumbfounded by your single brain-celled existence. You are literally the meaning of "stupidity" instead of life. The meaning of life is far different to what you presume you idiotical fumble-weed.

Now fucking cope.

<@738091123590824000> Yes, and I find it rather fascinating how this reaction goes.
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:23:40 Embed fail.
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:25:23 He is simply feeding off of negativity to gain attention, do not feed him to the point of obesity. To put it straight, ignore this imbecile.
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:30:05 Ayo, I need some opinions for what I post first after I finish. Picture 1 = 1Ô∏è‚É£, picture 2 = 2Ô∏è‚É£.
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:32:53 I don't see the slate texture on that. Also the colors are so fucking inaccurate. Learn RGB.
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:34:36 And you aren't either. As the wise ones used to say; every picture has 1000 words. Yours are all synonyms for stupid.
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:36:56 Can't even correctly spell "Cruel". I'm sorry but your stupidity amazes me.
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:38:37 What's it called, exactly?
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:42:19 Exactly what I presumed. You used grammar in a noun. As seen in your past statements, you have not used grammar. From what I am presuming, you have simply copy and pasted this off the web after searching "Spelling Disorder". Dysgraphia is the first to show up.
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:45:48 As I said, out of pure inferring; you are a fucking liar
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:47:44 Ok mommy's boy- Sorry I meant  fetus.

Motherfucker deleted the message. What a loser.
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:50:31 Ok you failed creation. Touch actual grass instead of concrete buildings in a game will ye?

<@404632014189494293> He can't come up with anything better.
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:52:14 I go outside 10 hours a day. Cope
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:57:53 No, no. He's not native nor understands how to write in other languages. He simple went to Google.com and went to translation.

<@738091123590824000> why did i laugh so hard at that lmao
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:59:36 get a mod in here, this kid might be saying racial swears in morse code real no way!!! <@754115484340846676> already did. it didnt scare me

creations-chat 2023-03-22 21:13:14 damn bro, anyways imma post  update log for a remake
creations-chat 2023-05-08 16:47:15 wip stuff

essentially just the torso pelvis and skirt for a mech im working on
creations-chat 2023-05-08 16:51:18 pretty ass since i need to patch up parts in the pelvis
creations-chat 2023-05-08 16:54:51 thanks, i finished the arm frames earlier but far too exhausted from external reasons to set up my pc and everything else for a few pictures.

also this is the same mech from over a year ago kek
creations-chat 2023-05-08 16:57:26 issue i see with most people making mechs is their poor colour choice and  articulation, which is the 2 primary components into making mechs look atleast half decent

also sticking to the same few blocks instead of using varying types for detail (ei stairs for vents or  skis to separate panels)
creations-chat 2023-05-08 17:06:51 also planning to make a showcase on it with more of a narrative plotline with cinematic, so heres a leak  (well a few leaks)
creations-chat 2023-05-11 22:22:14 update
creations-chat 2023-05-14 21:52:40 not quite sure where im going with this
