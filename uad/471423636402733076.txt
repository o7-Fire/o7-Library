The Tale of curiouschain (471423636402733076)
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 15:47:01 Still need detailz
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 16:03:03 Can someone teach me how to make good plane
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 16:03:14 All of my planes end up crashing and being lame
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 16:03:16 Fuck
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 16:03:21 Hell
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 17:13:39 Pirated Windows
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 17:17:39 Magents
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 17:18:13 I always want to die when doing the outside of a build too
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 17:55:17 How do I make this not happen. Yes, I put weighted blocks in the feet. No, removing them doesn't help
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 17:55:57 Shut it
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 17:56:17 My computer wasn't made to record okay
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 17:56:22 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 17:56:24 Feet not anchored
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 17:57:43 I do not understand this thing called delaying. Mostly cause it's not a option in the config.
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 17:59:03 Well that
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 17:59:08 Just made it flop all bout the place
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 18:01:48 Two legged walkers are different.
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 18:02:27 Nope
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 18:04:16 Mega meanie.
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 18:21:33 After a while of trying I decided I will use pistons instead, motors suck for walkers.
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 18:21:55 ?ping
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:56:26 No
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:56:30 This wrong
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:56:39 In soviet russia car rides you
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:57:30 Way better than the squid I tried to make
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:57:45 You got the two tentacles and 8 arms
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:57:51 I think it is 8 arms
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:57:54 Maybe you just got 4 arms
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:57:57 Oh 6.
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:57:58 Yes.
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:58:43 Also, it seems like there are suckers all along the tentacles
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:58:47 Which is wrong as hell
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:59:08 
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:59:14 Look at the tentacles
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:59:26 ~~Well this was just a random image I got don't mind the text I didn't look at it myself~~
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 21:59:54 Yes, only at the end.
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 22:02:35 Yep, grab ships
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 22:02:57 I doubt that you're going for realism seeing as it won't be using its arms and tentacles to move, right?
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 22:03:05 If it is then you're in for one heck of a hard time
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 22:06:06 Then you'll slam dunk the ship against the sea floor
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 22:07:49 Make it so the kraken is holding big guns with its tentacles
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 22:08:41 So it can destroy ships in the proper modern way
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 23:49:19 I still have yet to play around with the weapons this game has
plane-crazy 2019-06-27 23:51:23 Fbi hello yes

plane-crazy 2020-03-07 02:13:11 I got something that spins and like, I got a seat to sit on top of it without spinning too
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 02:13:18 I want to make it move but I have no bloody idea how to ♥️
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 02:17:25 Look man I want to make the spinning thing move and have the seat move too

plane-crazy 2020-03-07 02:38:21 Solution: Just let it do shit with the terrain
plane-crazy 2020-03-07 03:39:02 Man I built my creation the wrong way is it possible to rotate it
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 20:30:44 Is a shape of something, yes
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 21:05:58 Like,
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 21:06:00 What the hell
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 21:06:02 
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 21:06:08 How come I can't fix this
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 21:06:16 Like I don't know what kind of fucking blocks I should use
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 21:08:07 
plane-crazy 2020-03-15 21:08:24
