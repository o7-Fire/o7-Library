help 2022-11-21 17:03:52 I try to make a turret using motor 2 + motorlock to get rid of the space between vehicle and turret itself... apparently It creates so much friction that it can barely turn and when It does It glitches so much that It can teleport the vehicle into space if you will try hard enough... How can I get rid of the problem with that friction ? or make the turret move without these problems ? -worth to note...  I added some 1x0.9 however i want to avoid It as much as I can because It makes builds ugly in most cases. I wonder how people who build tanks do that
