Could I please have feedback for this one? thanks in advance
creations-chat 2021-01-20 14:16:30 > cheese grater wings, but it looks really good other than that
Roger, thanks. I will add motor-controlled ailerons and flaps.

> the wings are way too long and the intakes are too far forward/wings too far back
Thank you, I will try to correct this.

> default landing gear, not pog. And I would complain about there being no motorlock on the wings but Im not a little bitch
Motorlock on the wings?

This was what I did
creations-chat 2021-01-20 14:22:12 Roger that, thanks for the feedback
