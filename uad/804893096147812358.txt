bug-reports 2021-10-02 12:48:11 while doing testing for a competition, I found an issue:

when two things have spawned at the rails, those two things will be treated as if they were black listed. not just that, but you can‚Äôt undo it unless you leave the server
bug-reports 2021-10-04 01:31:32 one creation i have has the problem of when its motor 2‚Äôs are making contact with the body: it will do flips at random intervals

plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:10:56 true battlebots it mostly learned with experimentation

plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:18:25 i‚Äôm stalling until i can post images
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:18:50 my bot folds larger than the plot
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:21:11 hello there

bot-central 2021-12-07 05:37:41 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:41:51 wonder if someone should make a power point presentation for plane crazy battlebots
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:42:15 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:42:42 do yo have image perms

plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:45:43 good point
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:48:27 i just noticed no time limit
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:49:13 no, the fights last as long as needed
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:51:08 maybe someone with rank can make a suggestion for more details
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:51:42 nice
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:54:30 some are tall enough to avoid attacks
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:55:19 i got image perms just now
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:59:09 wait
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 05:59:19 no blacklist rule
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:01:32 wonder how bounds would work
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 06:02:06 this
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 22:19:08 can you show it rn?
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 22:19:31 that‚Äôll do
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 22:20:10 what does it look like in build
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 22:20:28 yes
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 22:20:45 oh
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 22:21:21 here‚Äôs mine folded out
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 22:22:28 it fits in build
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 22:24:53 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 22:25:42 they changed the rules to be more fair, but still has some holes
creations-chat 2021-12-11 19:43:29 not allowed in the rules
bug-reports 2021-12-13 02:24:37 did you both spawn at the rails at some point? i know that two things spawned at the rails will have no collision. the solution is to have someone leave the sever
events-chat 2022-01-18 01:36:24 this could be legal?
events-chat 2022-05-01 00:53:20 Is there still open spots?
events-chat 2022-05-01 01:59:00 Are there still open slots?
events-chat 2022-05-01 01:59:37 yes
events-chat 2022-05-01 02:00:27 alright
events-chat 2022-05-01 02:01:02 wait, what are the still open slots?
events-chat 2022-05-01 02:01:27 yes
events-chat 2022-05-01 02:03:34 i think i'll be good, but i know a few that own those already
events-chat 2022-05-01 02:06:11 are there rules on configurations?
events-chat 2022-05-01 04:05:19 you need to do that if you want fights to last longer than 10 seconds
events-chat 2022-05-04 23:41:28 am i still building uppercut?
events-chat 2022-05-04 23:44:24 well‚Ä¶

bot-central 2022-05-14 14:49:00 -servers
events-chat 2022-05-15 02:29:04 i disagree because you have not made it clear to every competitor, besides, you would happen to be the only one aware of that during the tournament
events-chat 2022-11-08 04:22:30 i can fight, can i get my bot now?
events-chat 2022-11-08 23:58:35 is drive torque limited?
