It‚Äôs a WW1 era hull but I‚Äôm wondering if I should make it in a WW2 refit thing (look up USS Pennsylvania 1944 for ref) or as built sometime around 1918.
creations-chat 2022-07-13 22:12:29 Superstructure smol imo
creations-chat 2022-07-13 22:14:35 Yes, but that‚Äôs a sussy flag which is risky. It‚Äôs better he doesn‚Äôt unless he wants to risk it all.
creations-chat 2022-07-13 22:17:32 Lmao
creations-chat 2022-07-13 22:40:22 Nobody wants to give an opinion?

help 2023-04-07 16:09:02 here is a close shot of the camera, do note that the one pointing right is there due to the config point thing.
help 2023-04-07 16:09:09 and is currently pointing
help 2023-04-07 16:09:25 for whatever reason it only moves the top chunk thats on a motor lock though
help 2023-04-07 16:11:02 oh there has to be an elevation change?????????
help 2023-04-07 16:11:36 oh no wait
help 2023-04-07 16:11:38 i see...
help 2023-04-07 16:11:51 but it still onyl drags the top chunk despite not being properly connected to it
