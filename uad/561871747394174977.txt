creations-chat 2021-05-17 08:47:02 bottom of it, the WIP part are the 4 engine sections. not detailed yet.

lol
creations-chat 2021-05-18 14:22:22 thats the same story when it comes to my endurance from interstellar (that is still WIP)
creations-chat 2021-05-18 15:22:33 <@!627207091378978846> not 1:1. if you would make it 1:1, then it would be 11 blocks wide and about 52 blocks tall. ||it is 11 blocks cause starship is 9meter in diameter, and if 1meter=1 block, i cant make 3mm walls. so it would be 11 since walls add about 2 blocks to the diameter.||

creations-chat 2021-05-23 15:46:53 yes i do, making a smooth hull in plane crazy is actually farely easy if you actually know what all the wedges look like , and what wedges do the best job in different situations.
creations-chat 2021-05-23 15:49:58 you couldve done a much better job if you used the right wedges and maybe some motorlock, but as in the pics u sent, the sparrow **does** look smooth on the front aerodynamic hull, unlike yours.

creations-chat 2021-05-23 15:52:28 you dont have to be as good as Herrguggi to do such a simple motorlock, just experiment around and atleast **actually try** to make it work with motorlock, just saying.

plane-crazy 2022-06-12 08:15:21 because gravity exists i think
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 08:15:42 its easy for the engine to get the transfer down, but when it goes up, its harder for it
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 08:15:56 thats also the reason for it stopping in the position it stopped
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 08:15:57 i think
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 08:16:39 this may cause it to be unstable and stop
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 08:18:14 try a transfer that has like 2 sides
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 08:19:23 so it kinda looks like this
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 08:19:46 if it still stops after that idk
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 08:23:45 yea that as well

creations-chat 2022-09-26 05:36:05 No, not if you use binary. 1's and 0's.
creations-chat 2022-09-26 11:08:58 Mechanical logic gates exist

Im working on the calculator rn, and im using the principle that when you push smth 1 block forward its a 1, and when its idle its a 0.
creations-chat 2022-09-26 11:11:21 Heres a screenshot from a while ago.. 2 full adders connected together

For every full adder i add, the number of numbers its able to process double.
creations-chat 2022-09-26 14:16:35 it is. if i just double what i have there, it can calculatue numbers up to 64. if i add another one again, it can add numbers up to 512.
creations-chat 2022-09-26 14:19:24 just binary numbers, you would have to translate yourself. a binary to 7 segment display converter is much much bigger than what i can fit on a plot.

Working shield generator, deflects most things above 3 blocks in size. the video that shows it deflecting a plane is old and has a less effective version of the shield generator. I tested it in a PVP server once, and it actually worked when it comes to deflecting planes and bombs.
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:23:42 theres no possible way to **reusably** protect against guns....
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:26:38 ye ik
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:27:13 but i could also make the shield non see thru
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:27:26 so when you shoot with guns or rockets you dont know where to shoot inside the shield
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 11:28:32 yea
