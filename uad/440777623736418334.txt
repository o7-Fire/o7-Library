plane-crazy 2019-07-03 15:41:43 Ah,that s0uja guy
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 15:42:07 That guy, i was just gonna use my v weapon with him
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 15:42:14 Too bad he left
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 15:42:40 I was just gonna
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 15:42:50 Kill his PC
plane-crazy 2019-07-03 15:43:00 Or arleast his patience idk
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:55:42 Guys i think i need help, when my aircraft get close to 2000 sps it starts to wobble, i am researching on it but the solution arent clear
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:55:48 Anybody got idea?
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:56:38 Mid wind mounted trapzoidal wing
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:56:45 It’s a F-104
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:57:13 i use normal wing panel
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:58:01 Thing is wing panel aint suitable for high speed
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:58:19 But u wanna use it since i would like to keep it Plane-ish
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:58:32 Side to side
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:58:44 Some model up and down
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:58:58 Like my yakolev141
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 04:59:54 Yep
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:00:09 Maybe
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:00:48 I tried that tho
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:02:09 I mean
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:02:28 My old MIG-25 wobbles too
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:02:34 So i came to conclusion
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:02:46 That high mounted wing arent suitable for high speed
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:03:25 All my high mounted wing aircraft dies when it exceed 1000
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:03:51 So i think the best wing for high speed flight is mid mounted
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:04:08 Btw anybody here got some high speed aircraft?
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:04:15 Like 2000+
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:05:04 I omce exceeded 4250
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:05:08 But none stability
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:05:18 I use magnets to do that tho
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:05:34 Engines wont take you to more than 700
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:05:42 You need magnet drive
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:05:57 I am researching on its mechanic to master it
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:06:05 Nah
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:06:11 Magnet drive on my 104 is smooth
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:06:14 By my setting
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:06:20 Oof
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:06:43 Airliner?
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:07:21 Sad, am mostly focused on fighter
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:08:10 I saw your fan art
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:08:18 It is literally “fan” art
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:08:30 Mov?
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:08:32 Moc
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:08:56 Do you see viet anywhere?
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:09:05 I didnt see him for a while
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:09:54 They wont make it work again lol since they wont beavle to sell their jetpavk if they do so
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:10:05 Bea ble*

plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:10:19 So that’s sad
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:13:02 Well
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:13:06 It is fan art
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:13:07 Really
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:13:11 Lito
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:13:15 Literally *
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:15:03 Guys can i get any info for hypersonic flight?
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:15:13 Like info from guy who got over 4000 or so
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:15:48 I reached 4250 and it did just that
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:15:59 But i saw a guy who went 5000 stabily
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:16:34 Yeah and wing panel just dont work at that speed
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:16:36 It just
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:16:40 Make plane dies
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:17:17 Ohhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:17:24 I see
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:17:25 Thanks man
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:17:41 Now i see why
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:17:41 Thanks a lot
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:18:20 Vox, so when we go faster, the COL move forward
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:18:27 Thus make pitch up moment
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:18:58 So if variable wing are introduced we would be able to adjust COL and make plane stable
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:19:09 Right?
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:20:36 I see
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:20:53 So it’s delta wing and variable wing that’s suitable
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:21:10 Very appreciated vox
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:21:37 Yeah ik but by moving wing backwards
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:21:44 The COL moved
plane-crazy 2019-08-31 05:26:40 I wish ricc would add mouse-following mode for motor

general 2020-09-15 14:23:51 Box with wings is the most typical configuration i had seen.
general 2020-09-15 14:25:13 Kinda satisfying when they be like “HOW ARE YOU FASTER THAN ME”, mate you just spammed a friccin rocket on a cube
general 2020-09-15 14:25:56 Yeah, i was in that situation
general 2020-09-15 14:26:23 Mate you haven’t seen Reshiram guy, he said plane shouldnt turn 9999G
general 2020-09-15 14:26:36 And get upsets when jay does that
general 2020-09-15 14:27:32 Is typical day in plane crazy

general 2020-09-15 14:30:02 Idk if it’s a tradition or something but russian jets tend to be more maneuverable than its american counterpart
general 2020-09-15 14:30:16 Despite having lower TWR
general 2020-09-15 14:30:29 Accurate
general 2020-09-15 14:31:33 American be like, TWR all day long

general 2020-09-15 14:33:59 The IRST of the rafale just spot the raptor

general 2020-09-15 14:39:27 X29 was cursed by its design
general 2020-09-15 14:39:32 Not forward swept
general 2020-09-15 14:39:47 Su47 also uses this thing and it flies pretty good
general 2020-09-15 14:39:52 But
general 2020-09-15 14:40:16 The forward swept tends to have to bare more load than normal one
