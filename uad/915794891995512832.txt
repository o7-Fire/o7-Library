general 2021-12-24 02:59:50 well i think i accidentally made a 3D pen making a plane, close enough right?
general 2021-12-24 03:01:20 At least it still functions as a moving plane but with haywire trails
general 2021-12-24 03:04:33 A long time ago in a land far far away, a shredder hurts my plane
general 2021-12-24 03:06:47 Someone wants to be sent to the 25th island of Greece it seems

general 2021-12-24 03:10:56 I jump to dodge, thats probably why they hate it so much
general 2021-12-24 03:12:49 one time i made this spinning shield lookin thing that had a bunch of trails for the illusion and whenever anything got close they were flung away (physics)
