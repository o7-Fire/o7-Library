plane-crazy 2020-12-23 11:25:10 Is there a way to check why i have a bit more weight on one side?
plane-crazy 2020-12-23 11:25:17 I cant find the area that's a little heavier

plane-crazy 2020-12-31 11:31:27 Is it possible to have like 2 control panels?
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 11:31:34 Like i have a submarine with a plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 11:31:39 I can control both i guess
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 11:31:49 without moving the chair
plane-crazy 2021-01-04 12:18:02 It looks small so :/

plane-crazy 2021-01-04 12:23:06 had to delete the first text so it went out of context

general 2021-01-05 11:21:16 ty <3
general 2021-01-05 11:21:58 Its a cool concept to mess around with, could be better if someone with a better knowledge of the game attempted it
general 2021-01-05 11:40:32 Repainted the plane to look more like the actuall one
creations-chat 2021-01-05 11:54:41 Ah, sorry
general 2021-01-05 12:10:12 I legit dont see a reason for why some people dislike everything :/
general 2021-01-05 12:10:20 Like good builds just being disliked auto
creations-chat 2021-01-05 12:13:02 People who disliked my build: What should i change in order to change your mind :D
creations-chat 2021-01-05 12:16:20 Blocky nose i assume like harsnavary said? And it is a tailsitter, Has a stand to put it for a vertical takeoff. Ill remake the nose and try and get it as smooth as i can
creations-chat 2021-01-05 12:19:12 That's how the og one was launched though, but sure i can do that. Btw how can i make it more round?
creations-chat 2021-01-05 12:24:23 <@456226577798135808> Something like this?
creations-chat 2021-01-05 15:12:50 <@456226577798135808> <@!719168864705052802> Took your feedback and changed it. changed to cockpit almost entirly and i made the circle a little more round like the screenshot i posted earlier. Hope you like it more now!

creations-chat 2021-01-05 15:18:23 The problem is that i want to kinda stick to it being small and not too long like the real thing, I might try and remake the cockpit one more time however its a little tougher i'd say
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:21:40 My plane is supposed to have realy small wings while still having a big body, now i managed to make it however i cant turn well
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:21:53 What can i use for turning better without it just jumping all over the place?

plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:28:36 
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:28:47 The pole at the front is just to push it for a vertical takeoff
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:30:21 rude
creations-chat 2021-01-05 15:33:54 The original build of mine or the original jet itself? In any case i dont think it can be smaller and still look as round
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:34:12 Do you mind marking where to add them?
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:35:00 Oh, ill try it

plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:37:10 
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:37:19 
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:37:31 This one is the best i guess
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:38:51 Its fun to build, annoying to use
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:40:27 Not realy, closest one for the back is just the 2 one i posted
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:45:21 Something like this? I dont know how to use motors as for turning tools too well
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:45:34 Currently all binded to R and F in order
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:47:51 They do
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:47:57 But only up and down
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:50:04 it doesnt get enough lift for vertical by doing that
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:50:09 Yeah maybe
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:50:46 It works, just gotta work on the weight
plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:54:22 bruh weight adding is pain

plane-crazy 2021-01-05 15:54:53 got it

plane-crazy 2021-01-05 16:03:23 Just like the real thing i guess

plane-crazy 2021-01-07 12:47:54 I feel like its not the best currently
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 12:48:02 could use an update
plane-crazy 2021-01-07 12:58:08 Is there a record for the biggest plane in this game?

plane-crazy 2021-01-15 20:42:46 How do some people make jets that are so balanced that they dont even tip down?
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 20:43:05 I can get a plane to be fully centered and have both circles in each other
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 20:43:22 But it always seem to tip down a bit
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 20:46:23 Do i need them to be slightly off maybe?
plane-crazy 2021-01-15 20:47:47 Ive watched some of just rens vids and they are usually a little off, but they fly super well

plane-crazy 2021-01-15 21:00:23 What we realy need is half, 1/4 of a block

plane-crazy 2021-01-16 15:09:17 Not sure if anybody needs this but if you build a dornier do 31 and you decide that the hover engines that are on the sides are 19 studs, then the body of it is 55 studs
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 15:09:57 had to do some research and find out the normal size of the hover engines they have (6.92 meters)
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 15:25:09 you mean heavier?
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 15:25:15 or pvp stronger
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 15:25:25 I dont think so
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 15:55:29 How can i make it more circle shape?

plane-crazy 2021-01-16 16:12:48 I think this is the best i can do if i want a circle like this

plane-crazy 2021-01-18 12:08:13 just smoother
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 12:08:25 it doesnt look like some lego build
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 12:08:54 if you get the sides a little smoother then you can get more upvotes i guess
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 12:09:11 and complaining just attractes trolls that dislike so keep that in mind :/

creations-chat 2021-03-12 20:55:45 <@660180216886329395> maybe move the main pilot seat back so the arms are hidden by the air intake, and hide the motor lock on the wings, overall looks great though

creations-chat 2021-03-22 18:52:31 I'm not sure about making the wings with half blocks, but i did think of using piston lock to get 2 sides wings
creations-chat 2021-03-22 18:55:39 I never used it before but i can get more angles with it, idk if it will work smoothely though since the wing is also angled
creations-chat 2021-03-22 19:01:11 I can maybe do a wing like this, not sure how it will effect the plane though (Will also need a taller tower <:nooo:787097964946259978> )

creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:39:05 The colors are fine, talking about the layout of it
creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:45:15 Not saying you needed to add motor lock to it, just saying the layout is weird, i know the iranian f14 has choppy camo but yours has weird gaps in between.
creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:47:49 If you used alot of lock you can add custom camo too 🦍 🦍 🦍 besides on the folding wings since you cant
creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:51:36 Plus dont see why you're getting mad at me, giving feedback on camo. Shape looks fine
creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:56:49 Delta wing 1x1 is like half a normal wing, doesnt add weight plus you got enough extra space to attach it on the tower
creations-chat 2021-05-14 14:59:41 I just said that delta wing x1 is half a normal 1x1 wing, take 2 1x1 delta wings and it is like a normal one
creations-chat 2021-05-14 15:01:42 Both my f15's fly at the same speed. One with camo and one without. Almost no diffrence. Plus using hover engine so that already adds lag
creations-chat 2021-05-14 15:03:43 If you dont want to do custom camo its fine, just make it look a little better

plane-crazy 2021-05-28 14:59:44 On the body its fine but i am struggeling with mine too
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 14:59:53 since mine is a star
plane-crazy 2021-05-28 15:00:04 Can motorlock signs
creations-chat 2021-05-28 15:01:43 Cockpit looks weird and the nose cone that pops out of the intake feels big
creations-chat 2021-05-28 15:05:13 Not this, i meant that the angle lock you did to connect the top part looks weird. I would go with a flat cockpit top
creations-chat 2021-05-28 15:11:29 using signs and emojis
creations-chat 2021-05-28 15:17:12 Love the idea with those folding wings
creations-chat 2021-05-28 15:19:56 <@!788862386039291915> Where are the intakes though
creations-chat 2021-05-29 08:25:18 Reminds me of mine in a way, looks nice! Add camo though and maybe overlay a blueprint
creations-chat 2021-05-29 08:29:00 In this case some of the camo is wrong, nose needs to be black like 33 33 33 and the belly at around 190 190 190
creations-chat 2021-05-29 09:39:09 <@627813759427018752> cockpit is supposed to be the same level as the rest of the plane, color isnt that good, small intake, wings look weird, the motor flaps for the tail look weird and point out. I suggest overlaying it with a harrier blueprint
creations-chat 2021-05-29 10:07:45 Why did he even add contro surfaces to the tail if he already had a motor flap
creations-chat 2021-05-29 10:21:03 Would look better with israeli camo <:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2021-08-19 21:01:41 Imo make the map like 3x the size we have now and that's it
general 2021-08-19 21:02:12 Not water all around
general 2021-08-19 21:02:18 Water lags the game
general 2021-08-19 21:02:28 
general 2021-08-19 21:03:30 Bigger airport would be sick
general 2021-08-19 21:03:57 I overun it when i try to butter
general 2021-08-19 21:04:11 Infinite is a bad idea imo
general 2021-08-19 21:04:34 Arabic block 🕋
general 2021-08-19 21:04:50 Mashallah
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:05:28 Infinite maps is gonna be shit
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:05:40 I think everyone would be ok if it was 3x
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:05:43 Too big
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:05:53 Its gonna be too big
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:05:57 Pvp would be weird
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:06:04 How big is infinite
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:06:30 When current pvp servers have mostly ground
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:06:43 How is it not gonna kag though
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:06:49 Current water drops your fpw
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:06:51 Fps
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:07:20 From my experience water drops like 10-5 fps depending on the size
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:07:39 What was his normal fps
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:07:54 Outside of water i mean
plane-crazy 2021-08-19 21:08:42 All i want this update is a bigger map and a 2d camera for overlaying blueprints tbh
general 2021-08-19 21:18:24 I dont get the resizing tool, is it like in build a boat or something else? <@217336009455566848>
general 2021-08-19 21:18:54 So you can make like 1:4 of a block?
general 2021-08-19 21:19:39 And then color/delete those specific ones you selectes?

creations-chat 2021-08-31 14:19:07 oh you meant that its not going flat, Ill try making something with it but im not sure if you can make a flat nose that's also thick on the sides
general 2021-08-31 14:37:43 
general 2021-08-31 14:37:47 no way,
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:29:44 you suffer
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:29:47 and then it somehow works
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:30:34 Appriciate it, You need piston lock to adjust angles and stuff with the motor
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:30:42 There's a simple tutorial i can send you
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:31:19 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_JhDXa0W9c
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:31:32 its not exactly my cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:31:35 just realy the basics
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:31:44 so he knows how they actually do it
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:32:40 Su27's/ su30's work the best
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:32:44 when they're mini
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:35:45 what is this
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:36:07 sukhoi ig
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:36:38 can get extreme manoeverbility on any plane
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:36:42 just spam propellers
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:37:03 props dont give lag
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:38:00 Can still give you extreme menuvarbility
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 15:38:27 I used to use control surfaces in the nose but my nose kept pitching up

plane-crazy 2021-08-31 16:00:01 only my mirage can keep the turn with him

plane-crazy 2021-08-31 16:05:25 Nice star
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 16:06:01 did you fix the wing yet
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 16:06:12 so it fits

plane-crazy 2021-08-31 16:09:18 didnt add the engine in the back for it
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 16:09:25 supposed to be something pushing it back too
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 16:09:32 i think
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 16:09:51 are the "canards" functional or not
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 16:09:56 because of the exposed motor on it
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 16:11:46 Is a levcon like a canard but has diffrent airflow since its connected to the wing?
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 16:12:54 Cant this be levcon's then too if purposed to?

plane-crazy 2021-08-31 16:15:30 but its diffrent since no airflow
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 16:16:09 He explained to me that the less wing and the more blocks = higher AOA
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 16:16:53 took the plane to times before 1687 🥶 🥶
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 16:18:01 https://gyazo.com/4e6f6f8d43cef313057a5a1c72ce15b2.mp4 <@!559568621312147476>  High AOA for example

general 2021-09-23 22:38:47 then crashed into the runway
creations-chat 2021-09-23 22:40:01 stock gear just looks bad on it, also they have angled elevators that go down/flat on vtols, not up
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:36:42 you wanted us to make our own custom jets or something
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:41:09 we are creative with how we build the irl planes <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:43:45 designed my version actually yes, there's no israeli camo on the actuall F-15 MTD
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:45:55 its done in the music industry too and in other industries though, taking a sample and putting your own stuff into it making it completely new although you can still see the original piece in it
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:47:58 making custom jets can look like shit too, what's the problem with making jets that already exist and are known
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:50:34 its a shredder ball that has a gun that can move behind its back, i dont see whats so good about it
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:53:08 still a flying ball that has a moving gun
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:55:48 can you show a video of what it does? it just looks like a weird thing
creations-chat 2021-09-24 21:58:10 best
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:00:55 man thinks building jets that arent original is bad and sweaty
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:05:01 That's just a shredder ball lmao
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:07:49 no cutters but it has the same functionality and a shredder ball with the guns
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:09:54 same functionality, all shredder balls have a moving gun like that
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:12:08 you said its original, its not.

<@!622667339825020928> they can still move backwards and forward and aim the gun back
creations-chat 2021-09-24 22:17:28 what's the problem with them being common? having a game where you can build everything includes fighter jets. if you dont like it then cope ig
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:27:13 Try the IAI Kfir, much better mirage 5
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:29:44 Im the F-15 with the camo and canards and dash is the one with the draken
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:31:45 The IAI Kfir is an upgraded mirage 5 though <:m_:778994206948589638> <:m_:778994206948589638> <:m_:778994206948589638>
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:34:08 Its not even a mirage at that point, the entire mirage series has delta wings and thats what makes them special, adding elevators and normal wings kinda throws it off
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:37:02 IAI Kfir tc2 is a twin seater, also i think the mirage 3 also had a twin varient. Mirage 5 just has newer avionics and a longer
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:41:15 Looks great so far, moving intakes?
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:43:40 <@676970337770012683> vertical stabilizer is too small, paint needs more work on imo, back can be smoother

<@580430817550139442> the intakes on the f15 move up and down for airflow
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:46:05 <@580430817550139442> 
https://youtu.be/ZkYqDYuH4uo

Look in 0:44 

<@676970337770012683> why are the elevators higher then the wings? The f15's elevators are supposed to be lower and the wings higher
creations-chat 2021-09-24 23:49:09 Ofc you dont need to add it, just thought the intakes move on yours since they look angled
creations-chat 2021-09-25 15:06:20 <@559568621312147476> cockpit interior can be better

They're first tricked into a deadly tournament of children's games, but then many of them volunteer to come back, realizing the games may be their only chance to win the money they need to survive.

creations-chat 2021-10-28 18:51:35 its a 2x2 cylinder cockpit, not 1x1. I usually use 1x1's though
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 18:53:14 no production vtol jet has thrusters on the wings
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 18:53:22 besides the v22 which is a prop
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 19:01:59 pardon
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 19:04:05 not production
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 19:04:22 also the pogo isnt a tilt thruster
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 19:04:29 nor a tilt wing
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 19:05:21 closest thing to a production wing vtol jet is the vj101
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 19:05:35 no wing tilt
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 19:06:00 not realy
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 19:06:18 you dont need to use an extra engine in the front that way
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 19:06:21 if balanced right
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 19:06:26 the vj 101 did it wrong
plane-crazy 2021-10-28 19:06:54 most vtol tests do

general 2021-11-14 21:49:58 
general 2021-11-14 21:50:38 It's like prototype planes with camo
general 2021-11-14 21:50:42 It just feels off

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 16:27:26 Mirage 4
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 16:27:40 Kfir and mirage 4000 are diffrent
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 16:28:04 Mirage 4000 was made for saudia Arabia but they backed out so it got cancalled
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 16:28:32 Kfir was just a dagger upgrade after france didn't give Israel their mirage 5's even after they paid for them
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 16:28:47 It's just Israeli camo
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 16:28:56 This is mine
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 16:29:02 One engine
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 16:29:15 Mirage 4000 is 2

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 16:31:22 4 is a bomber and 4000 fighter
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 16:31:26 No
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 16:31:32 That's why I want to make one

general 2021-11-16 21:00:41 Understanding friction and the 2nd law
general 2021-11-16 21:00:53 Idk why I just cant understand
general 2021-11-16 21:00:57 Like I get what it is
general 2021-11-16 21:01:16 Friction is always negative to the side we push
general 2021-11-16 21:01:24 Let's say I push right, it goes left
general 2021-11-16 21:01:37 Like the 3rd law in a way
general 2021-11-16 21:01:43 Not quite
general 2021-11-16 21:01:47 But similler
general 2021-11-16 21:01:54 Yeah
general 2021-11-16 21:02:09 Yes
general 2021-11-16 21:02:12 Also mass
general 2021-11-16 21:02:13 Don't forget
general 2021-11-16 21:02:22 Mass also effects friction
general 2021-11-16 21:02:36 The more mass, the bigger the friction
general 2021-11-16 21:02:50 Now I understand those basic concepts
general 2021-11-16 21:02:58 But I just can't put them together
general 2021-11-16 21:04:15 One of my hw questions was that we have a straight floor with a cube on it. The floor has friction and is pulled with a 30 dagree angle in 10N. The friction for both static and kinematic is 0.3
general 2021-11-16 21:04:36 Now I need to get 2 equation
general 2021-11-16 21:04:44 So like Fy and Fx
general 2021-11-16 21:04:49 My brain died already
general 2021-11-16 21:04:55 Something like that
general 2021-11-16 21:05:07 I would send the original question but it's in hebrew
general 2021-11-16 21:05:35 I can make a drawing

general 2021-11-16 21:10:13 i think you say simplfy

plane-crazy 2021-11-27 18:36:26 Or do you just go up
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 18:36:29 Like that's it
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 18:36:50 I mean can you go in a straight line
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 18:37:05 Besides going up
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 18:37:06 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 18:37:41 I mean straight stable flight and not just flying up stable
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 18:37:48 Like cruise
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 18:39:32 That's realy cool
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 18:39:40 Do you think you can make a plane out of it?
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 18:40:09 <@693249246157340713> if you can get it to be faster that can be insane

plane-crazy 2021-11-27 18:56:57 Wait if you press f to like reduce the hover engines you gain wing control? <@693249246157340713>
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 18:57:14 If so you can maybe do some cool "post stall" menuvars
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 18:59:08 I'll experiment with your thing in a few minutes

plane-crazy 2021-11-27 19:29:29 I am using props for pitch and sometimes they just dont respond anymore
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 19:34:28 and it breaks if you flip
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 19:34:58 or mess with the hover thrusters while moving
plane-crazy 2021-11-27 19:41:37 https://streamable.com/dc879d <@!693249246157340713>  does your system also work best when you do light movements

general 2021-12-05 17:10:57 (smartest)
general 2021-12-05 17:11:41 Elevators accelerate for a split second in the start and then it goes to regular speed so the 1st law is applied
general 2021-12-05 17:11:47 No air

Still why is it a tube though
creations-chat 2021-12-18 14:13:52 Then remake it the entire plane is just a tube
creations-chat 2021-12-18 14:15:58 Yeah but you cant realy add anything if it looks like that
creations-chat 2021-12-18 14:29:16 Because it looks like a tube maybe? You realy can't add anything to it unless you remake it
creations-chat 2021-12-18 14:32:42 No idea why you turned it into a fight when I just gave simple feedback 
If you want I can give you feedback like you want
Try adding some more detail to it like a spine and those exsust things on the nose. Try reducing the speed since although it's not a realistic game you can try and make it a little nicer
😁
creations-chat 2021-12-18 14:35:25 If you want I can overlay blueprints on what you currently have and then  you can know what to add

plane-crazy 2021-12-23 00:00:09 Mach 2.5 reached
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 00:00:49 I made my IAI Dagger which is just a mirage 5 into a kfir

plane-crazy 2021-12-23 00:02:35 I don't know tanks well

plane-crazy 2021-12-23 00:02:51 Sadly*
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 00:02:59 They've switched alot of aircraft
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 00:03:04 Like the super phantom
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 00:03:20 On independence day they bring them out since the museum is on military ground
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 00:03:25 But not now
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 00:03:34 It's closed until April for maintenance too
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 00:03:48 Not even corona I think
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 00:03:59 Might be a reason
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 00:04:06 But might be because of the heavy rain
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 00:04:15 Might have damaged them since it's in open air
plane-crazy 2021-12-23 00:04:43 Yet again it's the Israeli airforce museum and they don't give a shit about the aircraft

creations-chat 2021-12-23 21:17:25 Hey guys, just wanted to wish you all happy holidays. Discord is filled with ready-made messages that you don't even read, you just copy and paste to every server, I don't like that, I like writing from my heart. Our friendship, from the deepest to virtual, is very important to me and couldn't ever be represented by a cookie-cutter message from anywhere. So, I'd like to thank you all, you're the best furry roleplaying server I've ever interacted with.

plane-crazy 2021-12-29 17:32:43 Your music sounds like what I would get when I looked up "gaming music"
plane-crazy 2021-12-29 17:33:47 Also <@456226577798135808> your jet has too much aoa for pvp I think
plane-crazy 2021-12-29 17:33:53 Usually stable planes are better
plane-crazy 2021-12-29 17:33:59 For me at least
plane-crazy 2021-12-29 17:34:26 Which faction
plane-crazy 2021-12-29 17:34:42 Most pvp groups I see have them stable
plane-crazy 2021-12-29 17:34:48 And high ass drift aoa for show
plane-crazy 2021-12-29 17:35:45 I just think having more control with high pitch and stuff is better then having a driftable plane for pvp
plane-crazy 2021-12-29 17:36:10 Ones that aren't that necessary in pvp
plane-crazy 2021-12-29 17:36:28 And pulling up and stuff harder
plane-crazy 2021-12-29 17:36:37 Since you drift and lose energy
plane-crazy 2021-12-29 17:37:20 You get speed quick but you still get fucked at low
plane-crazy 2021-12-29 17:37:31 Hard to pull up if you crash
plane-crazy 2021-12-29 17:38:04 Doesn't always work straight up

general 2022-01-29 21:34:25 hover engine
general 2022-01-29 21:34:28 🤨
general 2022-01-29 21:35:05 You take a hover engine and out speed 15 and drag 0, then have it placed to a piston head
general 2022-01-29 21:35:11 The piston is set to lock and toggle
general 2022-01-29 21:35:22 And a bind you wont touch, like 0
general 2022-01-29 21:35:36 Facing it yes
general 2022-01-29 21:35:46 The blue part of the engine facing the grey part of the piston
general 2022-01-29 21:35:55 Not sure, just put it at 0
general 2022-01-29 21:36:09 And make sure they're connected with blocks/signs
general 2022-01-29 21:36:23 You can make a faster engine if you put more hover engines
general 2022-01-29 21:36:30 Depends on your plane setup
general 2022-01-29 21:36:47 What's regular
general 2022-01-29 21:37:25 Again, it depends on your plane
general 2022-01-29 21:37:47 Idk
general 2022-01-29 21:37:54 I use hover for pvp
general 2022-01-29 21:37:57 I can go 1500
general 2022-01-29 21:38:03 More and I wobble
general 2022-01-29 21:38:12 But some people have jets that go 3000 and higher

creations-chat 2022-02-04 10:10:05 Yeah hard to fit with that style of building, My best suggestion rn is to make the front gear. Mine is exposed and I can't hide it which is super annoying

general 2022-02-04 16:40:55 🤨 🤨 🤨 🤨
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:44:47 They're gonna die the fastest I think, they won't be able to point their plane well enough since it's just too menuvarable
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:46:00 It sucks there are mostly tryhard jets in this event too, it could have been so fun to see a prop pvp battle
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:46:33 Yes but I think people limit those stuff more
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:47:06 I get that, it's due to the speed though. No jet gonna be dogfighting at such low speeds
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:48:22 I get that, I'm saying in a more realistic way
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:48:38 I wish the mods limited the menuvarbility or have it at least semi realistic
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:49:09 Not have planes doing 10 full 360's in less then a second
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:49:42 Based on how it seems in a video
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:50:31 I don't want to see an entire pvp match just being a recreation of nam's pvp montages
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:51:32 Control surfaces in the nose > propeller
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:52:22 It's good as well since if you put too much control surfaces in the nose you lose speed + gain alot of lift so it has to be limited
events-chat 2022-02-04 16:53:54 Plus if people make jets why not make old ones to it fits <:nooo:787097964946259978> <:nooo:787097964946259978> <:nooo:787097964946259978>

plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:50:19 Wait mb it's sedan hussein's but box also know how to do it
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:50:35 How can you do it without exposed lock
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:50:51 Cam lock is the only way I thought and I'm not gonna learn it
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:51:29 Lvl 5
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:51:49 But if the entire tower moves then it's still exposed
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:52:13 I get the first way though
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:53:43 Amazing pfp

plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:55:09 Exactly
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:55:36 Can't use cameras so you gotta make it long

plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:59:36 Cam lock?
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 20:59:41 I saw someone make a tower

plane-crazy 2022-02-04 21:00:12 secret wo
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 21:01:07 If you can find a proper easy way to do smooth camo in this
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 21:01:29 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 21:01:35 There might be
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 21:01:56 Just gonna take time since it's locked both inwards and upwards in some places
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 21:02:12 If I won't be lazy af I might
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 21:02:39 For what
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 21:02:50 I wanted to
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 21:02:57 Glitches a bit
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 21:03:28 Although since wing panels are a little taller then normal blocks it might not glitch as much
plane-crazy 2022-02-04 21:03:33 might work

plane-crazy 2022-03-16 10:32:30 mostly the wings
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 10:32:34 and no gun
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 10:34:35 there isnt that much that it makes it look bad
plane-crazy 2022-03-16 10:34:44 that bad at least
general 2022-03-16 11:02:36 tinon do you know physics
general 2022-03-16 11:02:48 how good are you in waves
general 2022-03-16 11:03:11 sound waves going into water
general 2022-03-16 11:03:51 an explosion occurs 45 meters above ground. there's a submarine that's 30 meters below water. how much time would it take for the sound of the explosion to reach the submarine
general 2022-03-16 11:04:00 at first i thought it just wont but doesnt work
general 2022-03-16 11:04:23 how come
general 2022-03-16 11:04:36 ok ill try
general 2022-03-16 11:04:45 it doesnt work ):
general 2022-03-16 11:04:57 yeah but water density
general 2022-03-16 11:04:59 i believe
general 2022-03-16 11:05:11 i can try and do that yeah but idk
general 2022-03-16 11:05:21 we're not that deep into the subject so it might work
general 2022-03-16 11:05:48 p
general 2022-03-16 11:05:48 hel
general 2022-03-16 11:06:16 we didnt learn density yet

general 2022-03-16 11:06:23 sec

general 2022-03-16 11:10:09 a bit is
general 2022-03-16 11:10:48 45/243 + 30/1480 = 0.15[s]
general 2022-03-16 11:10:55 both water and air have diffrent speeds
general 2022-03-16 11:11:16 its without drag iirc
general 2022-03-16 11:11:25 therefore its this
general 2022-03-16 11:11:31 and its the right answer
general 2022-03-16 11:11:45 no drag as in its slow but just not gonna disapear

plane-crazy 2022-03-17 18:23:25 only problem is this part being so thick
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 18:25:03 its thick
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 18:25:07 supposed to be thin
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 18:26:17 everyone makes it so fat for no reason like just add signs or disconectors on both sides
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 18:27:45 all of your builds are broken now
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 18:27:55 still not as thick as one block
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 18:28:23 2 disconectors connected to each/ signs/ piston locked wings would work too
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 18:28:48 still requires piston locking
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 18:29:05 no 💀
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 18:29:10 half motor going half block
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 18:29:13 will just move it to the side
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 18:29:16 you want it in the middle
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 18:32:59 
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 18:33:52 piston locking is easy
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 18:33:54 whats the problem
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 18:34:13 lock + toggle and then wait a few seconds before locking the entire build in place
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 18:35:06 whats the jammer
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 18:35:29 bug bunny
plane-crazy 2022-03-17 18:36:25 yeah but where is it on the plane

creations-chat 2022-03-31 12:32:32 the kfir c-7 is a mirage 5 with canards and an intake in the vertical stabilizer, even if i add a kfir blueprint its still not gonna fit
creations-chat 2022-03-31 12:34:46 how does that make any sense 💀 not making a jet in a while doesn't mean its supposed to look like a weird gripen

<@!720751430595772418> its stealthy because its always on the ground, unseen by radar

who said anything about looking perfect? its just looking at a blueprint and seeing if it actually looks like the thing you made or not

general 2022-04-05 12:46:42 and its so racist
general 2022-04-05 12:46:43 💀
general 2022-04-05 12:47:39 one wide jets arent roscale at all but i dont like making big planes for pvp
general 2022-04-05 12:48:55 they somehow call them roscale and have the roblox player the same highet as the cockpit
general 2022-04-05 12:50:26 roscale
general 2022-04-05 12:50:50 i dont even know how sr got that one block is 0.77 meters
general 2022-04-05 12:51:39 you could probably measure the highet of a roblox player and someone next to an F-15 or some plane, then measure the actuall length of one block
general 2022-04-05 12:51:46 ill do it
general 2022-04-05 12:51:47 sec
general 2022-04-05 12:52:55 <@!526422085875007498> do you have any image of a guy standing next to a plane from a side view
general 2022-04-05 12:53:43 actually nvm ill just get his highet
general 2022-04-05 12:54:59 OM
general 2022-04-05 12:55:01 😍
general 2022-04-05 12:55:02 🔥
general 2022-04-05 13:14:12 tried it on both an F-16 and an F-15 with people besides it and it turns out one block is like 0.1227 meters
general 2022-04-05 13:14:19 ill try and do it better with a car or something
general 2022-04-05 13:14:22 easier to get the highet
general 2022-04-05 13:16:59 no
general 2022-04-05 13:17:02 easy
general 2022-04-05 13:17:12 i'm trying to calculate how big is one block rn
general 2022-04-05 13:17:17 its easy

general 2022-04-05 13:20:57 easy
general 2022-04-05 13:20:57 not 0.5 meters
general 2022-04-05 13:21:00 😎
general 2022-04-05 13:21:47 used this and measured the highet of the man and the car, then just compared it to the actuall car highet and x
general 2022-04-05 13:21:59 got that his highet is 175.4643 meters
general 2022-04-05 13:22:15 then i did 175.4643/100 = 25/x
general 2022-04-05 13:22:23 x = 14.2479 cm
general 2022-04-05 13:22:30 which is 0.1424 meters
general 2022-04-05 13:22:31 easy

plane-crazy 2022-04-16 19:52:11 you're changing the center of gravity and weight, looking at the size of your plane i would put a motor that's facing like an elevator inside that's flat when flying with the wings being normal, and when swept it changes the angle as well

general 2022-04-17 14:23:49 yeah
general 2022-04-17 14:24:43 its so stupid how neo warfare makes models for planes so fast while it takes ptfs 1 year to make a plane
general 2022-04-17 14:24:51 and the models in ptfs arent even that good
general 2022-04-17 14:25:00 + they all use the same script almost
general 2022-04-17 14:25:41 they're not that good but for roblox i suppose its fine
general 2022-04-17 14:25:55 they cant apply physics to them because of their actuall size i think
general 2022-04-17 14:25:59 the jets are actually tiny
general 2022-04-17 14:27:29 
general 2022-04-17 14:27:42 not me

general 2022-04-17 14:28:17 topgun
general 2022-04-17 14:28:53 i get that ptfs has only 1 modeler and coder or something like that but neo legit has around 4 different games and plenty more models
general 2022-04-17 14:29:07 one modeler in neo can make like 2 planes per month
general 2022-04-17 14:29:22 never because they are super lazy
general 2022-04-17 14:29:41 lazy
general 2022-04-17 14:29:56 neo warfare
general 2022-04-17 14:30:11 its good but ass in the same time

plane-crazy 2022-04-18 09:52:12 a plane cant be that small
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 09:52:14 if its roscale
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 09:52:22 you can just compare it to a real human size
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 09:52:29 around 1.5 i suppose yeah
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 09:52:56 thing is planes are tall and every roscale makes it wrong
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 09:53:43 almost everyone makes the cockpit almost the same highet as the player
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 09:54:09 f16's are tall
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 09:55:04 then they have roblox players like this highet

plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:55:53 i have like 40gb left
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:56:01 downloading mods is a little annoying at first
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:56:04 but you get used to it

plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:57:46 if you know how to use radars you're good
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:57:58 But its unrealistic in landings and stuff like that
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:58:20 you can legit fall from 1k and wont die because the gears are so strong
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:58:24 ok
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:58:55 Its harder to lock here
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:59:00 its like dcs in locking
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:59:07 But its fun when you learn how to

plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:59:37 They've made the F-15's AI really fun to go againts
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 16:59:46 it actually fires missiles like a player

plane-crazy 2022-05-04 17:00:01 F-14 won
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 17:00:18 Oh and strike fighters 2 doesnt have multiplayer
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 17:00:23 thats the biggest downside
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 17:00:32 I'm not
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 17:00:46 or il-2 1946

general 2022-06-27 16:38:23 The Harrier, informally referred to as the Harrier Jump Jet, is a family of jet-powered attack aircraft capable of vertical/short takeoff and landing operations (V/STOL). Named after a bird of prey,[1] it was originally developed by British manufacturer Hawker Siddeley in the 1960s. The Harrier emerged as the only truly successful V/STOL design of the many attempted during that era. It was conceived to operate from improvised bases, such as car parks or forest clearings, without requiring large and vulnerable air bases. Later, the design was adapted for use from aircraft carriers.

general 2022-06-30 11:39:25 Very well my friend
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 11:40:18 "its meant for pvp not looks"
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 11:41:12 its not hard to make a pvp build that's like 400 blocks and looks good
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 11:42:38 not maybe
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 11:42:42 its possible
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 11:42:52 most of my pvp jets are like 400
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 11:42:58 and look somewhat good
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 11:43:07 i just need to not be lazy when making them
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 11:44:18 also what's the point of making ugly ass jets just for pvp
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 11:44:30 no
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 11:44:31 you should
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 11:44:40 if you're going for a real life jet then why make it look bad
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 11:44:55 the whole point is so it looks cool when pvping
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 11:45:10 take namnam's jets for example
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 11:45:15 not a huge fan of his pvp builds

plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:01:51 (im not the red plane)
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:03:32 it was white so i couldnt see it well
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:03:35 asked him to paint it red
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:03:37 hi hi
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:04:28 what do you have so far
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:09:29 if plane crazy pvp wasnt so ass then he wouldn't even have that stuck on him
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:09:43 my plane was totally fine
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:09:54 just lost the vertical stabilizer
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:12:38 i dont think you can do that much since its the exact shape
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:13:13 what about your old 57 nose
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:14:15 i think you cant make a new nose unless you angle lock it alot
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:14:52 i say just keep the one you think looks like a copy
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:14:58 the details are gonna be different anyways
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:15:36 something thrizet did that i think you can make better is the camera thing in the nose
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:15:54 I saw someone anglelocking trails once
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:15:57 to make it super accurate
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:16:02 A-10 nose
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:16:10 no
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:16:15 you can use tip jars
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:16:19 it looks better
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:16:24 ill find it
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:16:34 something from the summer events
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:18:02 can work mayb
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:18:55 Not mine its DrDownHill99's but you get the idea
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:19:32 ik
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:19:36 doc is really good
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:19:49 but he never finished builds because he runs out of space
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:20:58 theres someone else who did stuff with sparklers ill find his thing
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:21:08 trails*
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:21:15 
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:21:38 trails have potential but its hard
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:22:02 if you make a nose with the delta wings and then use this to cover up the holes it can work
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:22:07 but its gonna be really hard
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:22:38 belonfs to zach_man248 btw
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:22:46 what requirements
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:22:51 contest?
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:23:37 my nesher is only like 2200 how did you get to 2600 on yours
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:24:10 <:m_:778994206948589638>
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:24:19 slow down and turn graphics down
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:24:47 in the nose
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:25:15 then use control surfaces insted of wing panels
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:25:18 same ammount of lift i think
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:25:41 man
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:26:02 I want to make my lavi have an openable cockpit but then i have exposed lock i think
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:26:10 unless i somehow make it super compact
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:26:41 i saw an F-14 with an openable cockpit and cockpit detail
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:26:42 i want that too
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 12:26:54 slow down

creations-chat 2022-07-01 14:53:47 The Grumman F-14 Tomcat is an American carrier-capable supersonic, twin-engine, two-seat, twin-tail, variable-sweep wing fighter aircraft. The Tomcat was developed for the United States Navy's Naval Fighter Experimental (VFX) program after the collapse of the General Dynamics-Grumman F-111B project. The F-14 was the first of the American Teen Series fighters, which were designed incorporating air combat experience against MiG fighters during the Vietnam War.
