The Tale of beta_developer (477636589674037255)
general 2020-11-28 18:01:26 Yeah
general 2020-11-28 18:02:50 SpaceX sucks  instead of they trying to research they keep sending people to ISS and the flights sometimes get cancelled by weather and etc. ngl.
general 2020-11-28 18:03:12 yeah starship
general 2020-11-28 18:03:43 ~~Imagine getting cancelled by Elon Simps lol~~
general 2020-11-28 18:04:38 Yeah that's right but NASA don't want to back with the  shuttles so this  have a logic
general 2020-11-28 18:05:19 yeah
general 2020-11-28 18:05:23 that's why
general 2020-11-28 18:05:42 yea
general 2020-11-28 18:06:14 SpaceX + Nasa = Nasa and SpaceX dont wasting a TON of money
general 2020-11-28 18:08:21 Man actually NASA isn't  doing nothing because of the PARTNERSHIP with SpaceX so don't come saying it's   bad because it's stopped af also  it's from the US govern  and they wouldn't  waste a lot of money on rocket and etc  yall know.
general 2020-11-28 18:09:14 Yea
general 2020-11-28 18:09:45 M a r  s
general 2020-11-28 18:10:09 imagine needing 2 rockets one from the crew and the lander  when you can  just put 1 on 2
general 2020-11-28 18:10:18 That's SLS
general 2020-11-28 18:10:57 Yeah sometimes i think the Buran could overtake the shuttle but the USSR wasted a lot on military
general 2020-11-28 18:11:11 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2020-11-28 18:12:15 Yeah also the  russian metal (that's sometimes  have fucking low quality)
general 2020-11-28 18:12:23 Yeah
general 2020-11-28 18:13:08 the Blue Origin is a joke  in my opinion
general 2020-11-28 18:14:52 Yeah it likes takes 3-4  years now to nasa do   a move
general 2020-11-28 18:15:01 The  NASA from cold war was pretty  neat
general 2020-11-28 18:15:31 yeeee
general 2020-11-28 18:16:07 I don't like too much SpaceX but they a   cool investment on  the  boosters and droneships
general 2020-11-28 18:16:40 yea bruh
general 2020-11-28 18:17:10 yeah that's cool better than NASA that  looks a fucking cold war time politic
general 2020-11-28 18:17:32 of secret things but it's funder by the US government so can't do nothing
general 2020-11-28 18:18:15 Shuttle External  tanks  and the Shutle itself is now  a joke by those boosters lmao
general 2020-11-28 18:18:25 LOOL
general 2020-11-28 18:18:28 yes
general 2020-11-28 18:18:47 saturn V but T U N  E D
general 2020-11-28 18:22:04 YEA
general 2020-11-28 18:22:25 but it's probable that starship go  in the 1st try  or it just  get boomed
general 2020-11-28 18:22:48 starship´is just a watertower with  some American Airlines Old MD80 silver  livery
general 2020-11-28 18:23:56 <:pogey:651848693842182144> SpaceX starship is kinda boring too see so you just have to see RT things and Crew 2 launchs  and etc
general 2020-11-28 18:24:01 and that's depressing
