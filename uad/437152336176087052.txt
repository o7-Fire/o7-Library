the-dump 2020-05-24 03:57:52 *le tale of how I destroyed an ultra toxic community of 10k people*
the-dump 2020-05-24 03:58:04 ( this story is COMPLETELY true tho )
the-dump 2020-05-24 03:58:55 in short : There's this application called sticknode that has a community around it, it's basically a ripoff of pivot and flash, then the boss in this community is the creator, ralph, and his co-creator ( or shall I say victim ) sean
the-dump 2020-05-24 03:59:13 I joined the community and basically it was a nuclear reactor
the-dump 2020-05-24 03:59:54 people be ultra rude and make a swear word olympic every time, and the creator is loke, cocaine chill all the time
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:00:22 everything was good for some days until I critique on someone's animation.
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:00:45 https://tenor.com/view/nuclear-catastrophic-disastrous-melt-down-gif-13918708
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:01:01 boom, community meltdown
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:01:20 they hated, they made memes about me, they cursed on me till I am dead
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:01:47 but I am like that one penny on the rail that wouldn't flatten no matter how many continental railway passes by
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:02:06 I fought back.
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:02:25 my efforts were futile since I got temp banned for all the wrong reason
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:03:09 after that temp ban I came back and I literally cursed on every user that wronged me and swore I would come back on this community, then I got perm ban.
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:03:30 since I am not an idiot I came back and used a deep web website hacker software
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:03:42 the community crumbled like this :
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:04:08 my friend.
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:04:32 10k people, deprived of their free trial of happiness
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:04:51 uh oh spooky
the-dump 2020-05-24 04:04:54 it's not here anymore

the-dump 2020-08-25 02:44:35 Instead of a meme, please enjoy this video of a kitten https://youtu.be/7VSR4_tAYvw
help 2020-08-25 02:45:58 there is one video about it but it's not even symmetrical
help 2020-08-25 02:46:26 and the chance of finding a tutorial of a 5 bladed prop on other platform ? **absolute zero to nothing.**
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 02:47:58 I dunno, never tried this design before
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 02:48:23 each night, I cringe about Tactiphy's " Tatra " Suspension
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 02:48:41 it's not even a tatra suspension, it's just a swing axle with a camber
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 02:52:07 real ones look like this : ( I know my screen resolution is gay but I didn't choose )
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 02:52:20 suspension that are placed this way
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 02:52:24 pretty simple
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 02:52:41 kinda decent for offroad

plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:55:26 nooooooo
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:55:41 that's not very pogchamp if you do so
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:55:50 I want the tail rotor to actually do something
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:59:23 noooo
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:59:25 oh wait
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:59:27 yeah maybe

plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:59:33 turning...
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:59:43 nah, perfect torque counter doesn't exist
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 03:59:51 so im just going to do manual correcting
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:00:57 im tryna make a swashplate blackhawk
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:01:19 I had this idea but when I realized someone already did it before me ( in the hall of fame )
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:01:38 well, I better hope no one says " copied @12121@!212 "
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:06:36 I can't tell if this is copied from Prototrode or not
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:07:39 better not, otherwise people will activate their ranting-typing-finger-of-fury !
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:08:11 never did.
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:08:54 but yeah, meh
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:09:08 im not going to do the same things I did before.
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:09:15 :>
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:09:30 ugh my heli won't even fly properly
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:09:49 gonna add a lead drag and see if it flies
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:10:27 well, I was warned 3 times before the ban hammer struck
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:10:43 2 warns were completely irrelevent and unrelated to the discord itself
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:11:18 brickzay just does decent builds, not amazing or anything
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:11:23 E
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:11:59 if anyone is a swashplate expert here, please help me
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:13:53 gig ?
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:13:58 who is he ?

plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:40:13 huh
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:40:15 wait
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:40:24 it's just that the control got inverted for some reason
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:42:20 now that my heli can *actually* fly
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:42:38 I need to fix the oscillation
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:45:06 my helicopter actually flies now, but it's really hard to control and the oscillation wasn't the swashplate itself, I think it's a glitch
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:46:23 ship builds are pretty epic\
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:47:44 ack
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:47:51 data problem detected

plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:52:10 im just going to add some touches
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:52:11 coz
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:52:40 it's just a skeleton
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:53:01 ( yes I know I use stock engine for turning now stfu )
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:53:33 DUDE
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:53:41 DELETE IT AND SAVE YOURSELF FROM THE BAN HAMMER
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:54:20 ok, maybe we can just chat and the mods won't see his message

plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:55:02 Cat's ear's tail rotor blade
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:55:21 i know
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:55:57 but yeah it's maybe unlikely they'll scroll up unless they're bloodthirsy moderator finding every way to ban someone for their own ego
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:56:18 smh, rick, fix motors already
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:56:24 or realease Plane Crazy 2
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:57:30 the only problem with normal swashplate is that it's SUPER sensitive to control
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:57:52 adding lead drag like that youtuber did will kill the rotor instantly
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:58:21 either it'll noclip thru the earth
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 04:58:39 or it'll be plane crazy's BIGGEST beyblade
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 05:00:01 same
plane-crazy 2020-08-25 05:00:06 but i'll say it

help 2020-08-25 05:38:58 it may take a bit of time before it lifts without spinning ( because physic's a jerk )

general 2020-08-26 05:11:28 I think this is the origin of the " oof " sound, rather than it coming from a unknown PS2 game, I think it was the sound of Matt Damon pitched down and compressed, he was literally saying " Oof " : https://youtu.be/k-T_hdq5hYQ
general 2020-08-26 05:12:17 im about 70% sure that's where the death sound came from
general 2020-08-26 05:12:25 it's just pitched down, slowed down and compressed

help 2020-08-26 11:52:41 well
help 2020-08-26 11:52:54 is your heli Coaxial or Non-Coaxial ?
help 2020-08-26 11:53:03 Coaxial = 2 layer of rotor
creations-chat 2020-08-26 11:53:38 Blackhawk but with B I G rotor blades
creations-chat 2020-08-26 11:53:47 it did provide more lift
the-dump 2020-08-26 11:54:24 dude
the-dump 2020-08-26 11:54:29 not these memes
the-dump 2020-08-26 11:54:33 they're illegal here

help 2020-08-26 11:55:30 
help 2020-08-26 11:55:47 A chinook only needs 2 rotor blade
help 2020-08-26 11:55:54 that's why there is no tail rotor
help 2020-08-26 11:56:07 and it spins this way as shown as what is supposed to be a GIF
help 2020-08-26 11:56:13 so remove the coaxial rotors
help 2020-08-26 11:58:20 Your typical chinook
help 2020-08-26 11:58:23 flies perfectly
help 2020-08-26 11:58:33 pay attention to the angle of the blade
help 2020-08-26 11:59:06 
help 2020-08-26 11:59:07 here
help 2020-08-26 11:59:20 and the motors should be set the opposite of eachother
help 2020-08-26 11:59:40 so if a motor is RF, the other should be FR
creations-chat 2020-08-26 12:00:02 <@!451853936815636511> I see you're a man of culture aswell
creations-chat 2020-08-26 12:00:15 👍
help 2020-08-26 12:01:48 Reduce the Torque to 1
help 2020-08-26 12:02:11 the power is easily explained, since Torque is literally means " Strength of Rotation "
help 2020-08-26 12:02:28 based on weight ?
help 2020-08-26 12:02:29 bruh
help 2020-08-26 12:02:33 doesn't exist
help 2020-08-26 12:02:41 but yeah, you should add wings
help 2020-08-26 12:02:46 like in the real chinook
help 2020-08-26 12:03:43 it should.
help 2020-08-26 12:04:59 
help 2020-08-26 12:05:06 small ass wing
help 2020-08-26 12:05:15 but yeah, put the wings inside
help 2020-08-26 12:05:26 hol' up
help 2020-08-26 12:05:34 what in the hell do you thing you're doing
help 2020-08-26 12:06:06 when I said " at the tip of the rotor blade " I mean it
help 2020-08-26 12:06:10 put Diamond plate
help 2020-08-26 12:06:16 makes your helicopter more stable
help 2020-08-26 12:06:35 and the helium on top is cringe, most people hide it along with the motors
help 2020-08-26 12:07:04 Like so.
help 2020-08-26 12:07:43 most people also just put heavy ballast to the bottom and heliums on top of the helicopter for stability
help 2020-08-26 12:08:07 my blackhawk has NO heliums at all, so it works like a real helicopter, and it's hilariously hard to control
help 2020-08-26 12:08:49 uh
help 2020-08-26 12:09:03 you should fine tune it
help 2020-08-26 12:09:11 5 weight is recommended
help 2020-08-26 12:09:59 Since helicopter don't use Helium for stabilizer, I turned to real life and put upright rotor blades instead ( super useful for stable helicopter )
help 2020-08-26 12:10:50 it's called a " Swashplate "
help 2020-08-26 12:10:56 I put it so it's very pog champ
help 2020-08-26 12:11:06 and yes, what's a swashplate if it doesn't work ?
help 2020-08-26 12:11:14 it does actually work pretty well
help 2020-08-26 12:11:56 well, generally
help 2020-08-26 12:12:04 it's 1 torque and max speed
help 2020-08-26 12:12:14 or 20 speed
help 2020-08-26 12:12:45 Real helicopter has jet engine to push them foward
help 2020-08-26 12:12:59 
help 2020-08-26 12:13:11 those barrels that looks like a jet engine you see in helicopter
help 2020-08-26 12:13:17 they're not for boosting
help 2020-08-26 12:13:21 they're for moving it
help 2020-08-26 12:13:54 a swashplate does move the helicopter a bit, but generally, it's just for pitch control
help 2020-08-26 12:15:09 nuuu no downloads
help 2020-08-26 12:15:22 most people just use " Gyazo "
help 2020-08-26 12:15:35 I don't use it since i think it's not pogchamp
help 2020-08-26 12:17:29 you need to raise the torque of the 2 rotors
help 2020-08-26 12:18:16 nani
help 2020-08-26 12:18:27 it needs to spin like a windmill
help 2020-08-26 12:18:41 higher the torque = more glitchy it gets
help 2020-08-26 12:18:52 you wanna see what max torque does to a swashplate ?
help 2020-08-26 12:18:53 oh
help 2020-08-26 12:18:57 because
help 2020-08-26 12:19:03 you pressed the wrong button
help 2020-08-26 12:19:11 maybe you pressed R and it goes downward
help 2020-08-26 12:19:15 press F maybe
help 2020-08-26 12:20:36 well, the control needs to be inverted for helis
help 2020-08-26 12:20:45 if a motor for a propeller is RF
help 2020-08-26 12:20:50 then the other should be FR
general 2020-08-26 12:21:38 I once got to a marriage
general 2020-08-26 12:21:41 and there was a band
general 2020-08-26 12:21:48 they were singing a romantic song
general 2020-08-26 12:21:58 it was really lame
general 2020-08-26 12:22:12 but then they go " that look on your **fucking** eyes "
general 2020-08-26 12:22:18 and literally goes full rock mode
general 2020-08-26 12:22:31 just like in the movie " Old School "

help 2020-08-26 12:46:40 super rocket is more speed thus more lift
help 2020-08-26 12:46:47 yessum
help 2020-08-26 12:46:51 👌
help 2020-08-26 12:47:28 because you need to change the pitch of the blade
help 2020-08-26 12:47:34 and also add actual wings
help 2020-08-26 12:47:45 and make the motor unpowered
help 2020-08-26 12:47:57 let the rocket do the job
help 2020-08-26 12:48:06 but it might leave a bit of torque tho
help 2020-08-26 12:48:19 yessum
help 2020-08-26 12:48:24 the blade's angle
help 2020-08-26 12:48:27 of the rotr

general 2020-08-27 07:53:16 he just doesn't accept the fact that he's a noob
general 2020-08-27 07:53:35 things could have gone different direction if he wasn't like this
general 2020-08-27 07:53:45 I would have helped him become atleast a decent player
general 2020-08-27 07:54:43 even tho he wasn't a unde

general 2020-08-27 07:55:08 yep
general 2020-08-27 07:55:13 listen to his own voice
general 2020-08-27 07:55:20 he must've used a voice changer
general 2020-08-27 07:55:25 or something
general 2020-08-27 07:55:34 but maybe he was unde
general 2020-08-27 08:00:49 yeah
general 2020-08-27 08:00:52 exactely
general 2020-08-27 08:00:53 I agree
general 2020-08-27 08:01:01 im going to show you my comment
general 2020-08-27 08:01:22 it's definitive proof he's either a unde, has brain damage or both and is a snowflake

plane-crazy 2020-08-27 12:02:29 no time for break dance

general 2020-08-27 12:05:04 it may sound like a silly word at first
general 2020-08-27 12:05:12 but it actually comes from this :
general 2020-08-27 12:05:40 https://youtu.be/AB6sOhQan9Y
general 2020-08-27 12:06:08 the lord of cinder was an extremely good king that sacrificed himself to extend happiness and whatnots
general 2020-08-27 12:06:13 ( in a nutshell, ofc )
general 2020-08-27 12:06:26 gwyn locked himself in a room for thousands of years to come
general 2020-08-27 12:06:41 and yeah, you kill him because you need to
general 2020-08-27 12:06:49 but then you know what ?
general 2020-08-27 12:06:55 " shadows die twice "
general 2020-08-27 12:07:01 **soul of cinder**
general 2020-08-27 12:07:11 all the souls from the greatest warrior that ever lived

general 2020-08-27 12:07:37 it's not even like, in the main story
general 2020-08-27 12:07:40 it's unimportant
general 2020-08-27 12:07:52 the soul of cinder is just a secret boss
general 2020-08-27 12:08:25 lord of cinder is unimportant because who wants to know who even made the world of dark souls as it is in the game ?
general 2020-08-27 12:08:51 well, people sob after hearing plin plin lon

plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:18:31 hold up
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:19:25 technically, since it can fly, it's a plane
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:19:41 because plane can navigate on land like cars
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:20:04 but it's considered a plane because F L I
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:20:28 well yeah
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:20:43 it's disputable but that's what I think
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:24:17 like
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:24:17 I doubt that infinite speed is the fastest, since I found a new type of speed : Null
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:24:23 it literally said null
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:24:32 only a photo can prove it
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:24:44 which unfortunately I don't have
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:25:00 I only reached it once by using physics constraint glitch
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:25:34 like, I compressed ropes and very stiff suspension mixed with conveyor engine to create the ultimate beyblade
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:26:01 and it just displays a triangle of 3 lines because it's so damn fast
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:26:12 reload it lol
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:26:31 i jumped on it and it flung me to null
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:26:35 it just said null
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:26:46 i don't even know if it's faster than infinity or slower
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:28:19 ok actually let's make pogchamp flinger
plane-crazy 2020-08-28 13:29:11 o my bobuk
general 2020-08-28 13:30:10 I once played Monopoly with my sister, and I got a double on a dice roll, so I advanced twice

general 2020-08-28 13:30:42 then she stepped in my plot and she has to pay

general 2020-08-28 13:31:38 well, I did
general 2020-08-28 13:31:55 but since my sister dumb unde at that time she didn't even bother to read the rules
general 2020-08-28 13:32:20 I tried to explain to her that double on a dice means advance 2x but she still cri
general 2020-08-28 13:32:40 so I just face-booked the rules in her face

plane-crazy 2020-08-29 08:45:44 i'll kick his ass to orbit 7 times in a row if I can
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 08:46:05 my only last resort is flinger 7000 but metal
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 08:46:08 but
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 08:46:15 that's far from getting used
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 08:46:30 or just turret dangled from ropes
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 08:48:35 wether you like it or not, you'll see half of his ass orbiting around in the null zone once I do the funny with him
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 08:50:13 me in VC = death
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 08:53:10 finally
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 08:53:11 after

plane-crazy 2020-08-29 08:54:42 **i'll be the first**
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 08:55:07 here is how to prevent funny
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 08:55:20 I am satisfied
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 08:55:38 now I can make vehicle with realistic steering without motor2 doing the funny
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 08:56:21 very soft suspension to absord funny
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 08:56:27 rope to also absorb funny
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 08:56:37 unpowered motor or else it won't work
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 08:56:38 and then
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 08:56:41 funny is gone
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 08:57:30 begone tank steering

creations-chat 2020-08-29 12:41:56 kinda
creations-chat 2020-08-29 12:42:05 search up " cool color combination "
creations-chat 2020-08-29 12:42:13 or just images of plane
creations-chat 2020-08-29 12:42:16 that's the easy way
creations-chat 2020-08-29 12:42:17 but
creations-chat 2020-08-29 12:42:29 it's hard to actually get a nice color scheme
creations-chat 2020-08-29 12:42:44 you're not a god player unless you have a great choice of color
creations-chat 2020-08-29 12:42:47 whihc I don't have

plane-crazy 2020-08-29 12:45:34 that's it
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 12:45:43 and you can watch prototrode's video on it
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 12:46:58 it's a pretty neat trick for your build
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 12:47:05 prototrode popularized it
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 12:47:14 you could say he was the " inventor ", in some ways
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 12:47:57 that's not very cash money of you to say that to him
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 12:49:44 doubtful

plane-crazy 2020-08-29 13:18:53 this may look like a compact advanced suspension, but don't be fooled by it's appearance, it's a **max-upgraded plebian suspension**
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 13:19:07 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 13:19:09 /you hear me right
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 13:19:23 it's literally the " normal " suspension that noobs use
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 13:19:35 but I cranked the " is it possible ? " meter to the max
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 13:20:32 oh, and realistic steering that doesn't do the shaky funny
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 13:21:00 max upgraded plebian suspension
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 13:21:02 what have I done
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 13:21:18 and I can hear the motor gods crying in my back because there is no way to glitch it out
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 13:22:08 and I went to the toilet earlier and I saw an octopus pointing a gun at me saying " if you do these kind of things again, you're dead meat "
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 13:22:14 im assuming it's the kraken
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 13:22:26 i'd like to see him try
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 13:22:42 once I grab my head phones and listen to BFG division, no way he can kick my ass
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 13:24:14 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 13:24:26 if you don't wanna get rekt by better players, then just don't go to PVP
plane-crazy 2020-08-29 13:24:43 once you enter it, it's the rules of the jungles

creations-chat 2020-08-29 13:40:42 but if you do some kind of free request build commission, hope they have a pill for what the hell's wrong with you

general 2020-08-29 13:57:00 I don't think so
general 2020-08-29 13:57:32 so one day, a farmer loses his horses, the village gathers round and says to him " oh we're so sorry you lost all your horses "
general 2020-08-29 13:57:37 which he then replied
general 2020-08-29 13:57:41 " we'll see "
general 2020-08-29 13:58:17 then, the next day, all of his horses return, of course, the village yet again gathers round and says " wow you're so lucky you got all of your horses back ! "
general 2020-08-29 13:58:25 then he ALSO replied
general 2020-08-29 13:58:29 " we'll see "
general 2020-08-29 13:58:51 the next day, his son tried to mount the horses but he ends up falling, in which it broke his leg
general 2020-08-29 13:59:17 all the village, well, you guessed it, gathers around and says " oh my god you're so unlucky your son broke your leg "
general 2020-08-29 13:59:29 then he YET AGAIN, says " we'll see "
general 2020-08-29 13:59:50 you know it ?
general 2020-08-29 14:00:23 yeah, the next day the military wanted to draft people for the war, looking for young strong mens, but hsi son doesn't get to go to war because, his leg does the funny
general 2020-08-29 14:00:46 well, it's a tale by monks, it basically says that " THERE IS NO ACCIDENT, LUCK DOESN'T EXIST "

general 2020-08-30 13:04:16 never gonn happn
general 2020-08-30 13:04:40 szme
general 2020-08-30 13:09:37 too much bots
general 2020-08-30 13:14:50 plane crazy only got 79%
general 2020-08-30 13:14:53 it needs more like
general 2020-08-30 13:15:02 but I don't doubt why it has 79%
general 2020-08-30 13:16:31 yes indeed
general 2020-08-30 13:16:41 you often get into random fight with unde
general 2020-08-30 13:16:44 unde = udnerage
general 2020-08-30 13:17:18 good fandom = healthy community, no snowflakes, good jokes, actually, take the TF2 fandom for an example
general 2020-08-30 13:17:32 extremely healthy, just a few part with toxic kiddo
general 2020-08-30 13:18:48 FNaF toxic and weird
general 2020-08-30 13:18:54 undertale is *perfect*
general 2020-08-30 13:19:00 **perfect**
general 2020-08-30 13:19:34 **perfect even tho, the kids ruin your social media life if you choose the genocide ending**
general 2020-08-30 13:19:46 **or even talk about opinion, at all**
general 2020-08-30 13:21:06 plane crazy is toxic in-game, you often ( yes ) get in to fight with random strangers, I think the only way to fix this is to add in-game rules
general 2020-08-30 13:21:11 since most players there are unde
general 2020-08-30 13:21:12 or not
general 2020-08-30 13:21:31 but since plane crazy is supposed to be a simplistic game...
general 2020-08-30 13:21:35 I don't know man
general 2020-08-30 13:22:13 like, people's common sense there just **doesn't exist in the space time dimension of our's**
general 2020-08-30 13:22:25 PVP is toxic
general 2020-08-30 13:22:38 but they have to remember that PVP is PVP, it's ruthless
general 2020-08-30 13:22:40 it's WAR
general 2020-08-30 13:23:08 once you step into no man's land, you're either rekting or get rekt
general 2020-08-30 13:23:31 tip for PVP : the most primitive and crude of weapon are suprisingly effective
general 2020-08-30 13:23:48 like, a spinner with just cutters for example
general 2020-08-30 13:23:54 **BUG DESTROYER 5000 MORE LIKE**
general 2020-08-30 13:24:04 shredder bug's weakness is yourself
general 2020-08-30 13:24:22 you're so guillible to go and destroy that spinner but you end up getting rekt 9000%
general 2020-08-30 13:24:32 because spinners, you can't get close to them
general 2020-08-30 13:24:41 or you'll be cut
general 2020-08-30 13:24:49 so use primitive weapons and deception
general 2020-08-30 13:25:32 once they hit the ground, there is a 999% chance the bugs start spasming and have the most intense seizure ever
general 2020-08-30 13:25:39 then you can just get free kills
general 2020-08-30 13:25:53 heh, guillible shredder bug undes
general 2020-08-30 13:26:23 camera welding is actually pretty funny
general 2020-08-30 13:26:36 uh
general 2020-08-30 13:26:37 no
general 2020-08-30 13:26:41 not a beyblade
general 2020-08-30 13:27:14 well, just like in CSGO, there is no stalemate
general 2020-08-30 13:27:23 yes
general 2020-08-30 13:27:33 
general 2020-08-30 13:27:36 extra broken
general 2020-08-30 13:27:45 yup
general 2020-08-30 13:27:49 go and play helix
general 2020-08-30 13:29:13 you know what this thing is ?
general 2020-08-30 13:29:15 this...
general 2020-08-30 13:29:18 this thing
general 2020-08-30 13:29:24 it's the ultimate offroad vehicle
general 2020-08-30 13:29:46 it's very chonk but don't be fooled by it's appearance
general 2020-08-30 13:29:54 and it's suspension is just a spring
general 2020-08-30 13:30:00 just a fucking single spring
general 2020-08-30 13:30:12 but it ends up being the best off road vehicle ever
general 2020-08-30 13:30:25 even tho it's super chonk and super short
general 2020-08-30 13:30:37 
general 2020-08-30 13:30:43 like literally, what the fuck ?
general 2020-08-30 13:31:01 even the swamp can't beat it
general 2020-08-30 13:31:13 it deflates it's own tire to create some sort of " paddle "
general 2020-08-30 13:31:27 it deflates it's own **fucking** tires
general 2020-08-30 13:31:29 like
general 2020-08-30 13:31:31 hwat
general 2020-08-30 13:31:51 there's also a heavier version
general 2020-08-30 13:32:01 and it can go on water
general 2020-08-30 13:32:11 you fucking weeb
general 2020-08-30 13:32:19 how do you even notice that
general 2020-08-30 13:32:23 how unpure can you be
general 2020-08-30 13:32:42 and yet, **even the mud can't beat it**
general 2020-08-30 13:32:46 it has one fatal flaw
general 2020-08-30 13:32:52 **it's super slow**
general 2020-08-30 13:32:57 26 km/h only
general 2020-08-30 13:33:07 yeah  I know right ?
general 2020-08-30 13:33:22 yet it still technically ends up being the best off road vehicle ever ( one of the )
general 2020-08-30 13:33:49 a single fucking spring for each wheel
general 2020-08-30 13:33:52 what even
general 2020-08-30 13:34:01 im just max confusion tho
general 2020-08-30 13:34:23 it deflate it's own tire to create a paddle effect
general 2020-08-30 13:34:34 oh, and another vehicle that looks a bit more pleasant
general 2020-08-30 13:35:01 Darpa ground-x
general 2020-08-30 13:35:09 sadly, it was rejected
general 2020-08-30 13:35:18 look what this mfer can do :
general 2020-08-30 13:35:33 
general 2020-08-30 13:35:38 yep
general 2020-08-30 13:35:40 YEP
general 2020-08-30 13:35:51 even the steepest of hills can't rekt it's amazing suspension
general 2020-08-30 13:36:40 wheel camber ?
general 2020-08-30 13:36:41 nope
general 2020-08-30 13:36:54 early concept picture before it was made
general 2020-08-30 13:37:02 it's a literal christie
general 2020-08-30 13:37:37 here is another weird-ass thing :
general 2020-08-30 13:37:41 
general 2020-08-30 13:37:54 **micheal bay but wheels**
general 2020-08-30 13:38:01 yep, it turns into a track
general 2020-08-30 13:38:18 one of the weirdest shit i've ever seen apart from the sherp
general 2020-08-30 13:38:24 also, sadly, rejected
general 2020-08-30 13:38:39 coz they don't see how it would be beneficiary
general 2020-08-30 13:38:47 i'd say, put that in all the humvees, now
general 2020-08-30 13:39:03

plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:34:23 monk 200%
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:34:43 M O N K
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:37:44 save data update may be epic
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:38:00 but what would be epic and actually worthwhile is game optimization
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:38:14 and stopping the shaking of the motor2
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:38:24 or turning off the shadow contrast
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:39:34 what if I make an advanced offroader in plane crazy ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:39:40 oh god

plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:39:57 of building it

plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:40:45 ur mum
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:41:35 actually, for differential locking : **put super rocket thruster to gain more traction**
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:41:38 **stonks**
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:42:00 I wonder if there is a way to make all your wheel spin the same torque

plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:57:23 I think we need a purge / chaos control in the PCC
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:57:42 while most toxic users have been punished for their krim
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 12:58:05 a minority of them still remains and when they're online, they ruin everything and crashes the party

plane-crazy 2020-09-02 13:01:33 well, general channel is always the place for the most random of craps\
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 13:02:04 the dump channel should be re-moted to a literal dump, where people can talk about anything or do anything
plane-crazy 2020-09-02 13:02:24 0balance, so phoking toxic

plane-crazy 2020-09-04 11:02:44 stealing content ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-04 11:03:11 i've been suspecting that DP has been stealing content or copying ideas from other people since he existed
plane-crazy 2020-09-04 11:03:29 I wasn't really sure but **now** we got him
plane-crazy 2020-09-04 11:04:03 prototrode's data testing video
plane-crazy 2020-09-04 11:04:07 or something
plane-crazy 2020-09-04 11:04:15 " testing save data "

plane-crazy 2020-09-04 11:07:38 it's possible he saw herrguggi's thing where he also test data
plane-crazy 2020-09-04 11:07:43 but I don't think so
plane-crazy 2020-09-04 11:08:07 there is now a 10% chance he's a content stealing pig
plane-crazy 2020-09-04 11:11:29 it does
plane-crazy 2020-09-04 11:11:35 but have you ever seen

plane-crazy 2020-09-04 11:37:29 may the suspension god be in my favors

plane-crazy 2020-09-04 11:57:53 Elitism : I do this so I must be better than you, then everyone agrees
plane-crazy 2020-09-04 11:58:21 or more like : ha, you only got 3 subs, you're a loser, then everyone agrees with that
plane-crazy 2020-09-04 11:58:36 mini modding should be fine
plane-crazy 2020-09-04 11:59:07 in the past, it was REALLY serious as a problem, now it's fine since most toxic users got clapped
plane-crazy 2020-09-04 12:01:43 now there's not much toxic users, just annoying people, just don't let them have fun too much or stuff happens

plane-crazy 2020-09-05 03:39:48 diamond plates
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 03:40:03 but it makes your vehicle heavier too

plane-crazy 2020-09-05 03:50:43 textures off doesn't work like this
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 03:52:55 it's just an advice

plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:32:25 why the fuck does my falken keeps glitching out
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:33:38 dude what in the fuck, I can't even find what's making it have a seizure
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:35:17 it goes super saiyan for no reasons at all
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:35:39 I tested it and didn't add anything, I tested it again and now it has a seizure and teleports to the null zone
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:36:40 this is so damn frustrating
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:37:25 I keep deleting potential blocks but it keeps having a seizure
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:38:18 maybe it's my latency
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:38:26 my avatar is lagging behind
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:38:55 it was perfect until it wasn't...
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:39:28 hell i'll even delete everything to find out
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:39:45 nope it's not my latency
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:39:51 it still is
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:39:54 bro
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:40:08 don't tell me it's going to be like the day plane crazy hitbox broke
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:42:50 I think I found the culprit
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:42:55 it's maybe the way I lock the wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:43:45 or is it the laser ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:45:11 yep, it was the laser
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:45:20 well fonk, it's time to redesign
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:50:28 ok, so if I place the motor in the tip of the fuselage, it goes berserk
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:50:36 new bug found I guess
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:53:46 looks like piston can't even handle motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:53:56 it did handle motor lock but now it doesn't
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:54:06 monk
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:54:37 I just wanted a laser but laser turned into seizure

plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:55:26 **but it doesn't mean im not going to remake it**
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:57:04 the culprit was the piston itself
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:57:07 o my lazer
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:57:20 tiem 4 motor instead
plane-crazy 2020-09-05 10:57:27 wait what

plane-crazy 2020-09-09 13:35:47 original means nothing
plane-crazy 2020-09-09 13:36:16 normal also means nothing since there is no definition for it, you can literally just say " I refuse to become what you call normal "

creations-chat 2020-09-12 03:53:44 <@!402617794606399488> finally a decent looking jet
creations-chat 2020-09-12 03:53:47 gud job
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 03:56:44 however, add a flybar and make it spin at an insane speed, you can carry heavy payloads without problem
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 03:57:14 ballast + motor = ❤️

plane-crazy 2020-09-12 10:07:30 looks slick
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 10:07:36 can it feather ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 10:07:51 otherwise it's not really a swashplate but a thrust vectoring system
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 10:08:01 hm ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 10:08:14 sho me
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 10:08:54 just get gyazo
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 10:12:59 you only moved the blades tho
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 10:13:09 I habe doubt
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 10:39:55 " we fly high, you know that and we don't lie "
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 10:40:04 - every helicopter pilot ever
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:34:58 even tho fully articulated swashplate ( plane crazy style ) works pog, im going to make a REAL one based on blueprint
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:39:41 im literally on a server where everyone makes the rocketmon hover ball tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:39:49 **what the fuck is so cool about it ?**
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:39:58 **same**
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:40:03 *rage*
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:41:42 I think i've done 11 tutorial then the rest is self-taught and help from other peoples
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:42:23 to people who think that not helping others is cool and swag : social suicide guarenteed
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:42:39 a mind is a terrible thing to waste
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:43:40 I knew the swashplate is going to be massive, dangit
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:44:09 unless sakura  or AD randomly pops up, it's not going to be really compact
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:45:09 same for me
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:45:29 play ball !
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:45:48 it's blades better flap and not glitch out
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:45:52 and of course, lead drag
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:49:51 yep
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:49:54 YEP

plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:53:38 ok, so my swashplate design doesn't work with blade flapping, let's try the text design
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:54:12 in game rules NEEDS appliance, now
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 13:54:21 get reports and moderation back !

plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:06:44 what the actual phok
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:06:53 semirigid 4 bladed system 2.22
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:07:06 just place it on the motor that hold the control rod
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:07:20 holy krap
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:07:32 wow really ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:07:48 even tho she doesn't give 2 shits about PCC or the actual game
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:07:58 **it's his most succesful and most played game**
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:08:03 **decides to ignore it**
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:08:13 oh yeah, the hair changes everything
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:08:32 always thought of mad as a girl because of the fucking hair
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:08:36 it ruins everything
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:08:59 tf is wrong with it
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:09:04 nevermind you guys are weird xd
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:10:30 maddatak doesn't care about PC or even the PCC
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:10:37 " im staying out of trouble " he says
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:11:03 well, by staying out of trouble, that was a total A-hole SS move that ruined a community
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:11:24 good thing it was saved at the last moment before meltdown due to multiple perfect timings
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:11:58 lol im trying to restrain myself from saying that maddatak is a she as much as possible
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:12:35 **remaster it**
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:12:48 remastering something always feels badass after the result
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:13:10 but yeah, we all agree, **plebian suspension is K R I N G E**
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:13:15 especially on tanks
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:13:29 use a christie on the suspension next time
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:13:39 and no, you don't nessecarily have to make it bigger
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:16:08 unpowered motor2, oh god why haven't I thought of that first
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:16:22 this could potentially be **INCREDIBLY** useful
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:16:32 from swashplate to suspension and other technical things
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:17:47 just put 0 speed 0 torque and sim sa la boom unpowered motor2
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:17:55 limit it to an angle...
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:18:07 and boom, incredible versatility
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:19:00 if bad guy didn't gave me that idea, I wouldn't be able to make a full articulation or even have the idea of it at all
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:19:07 <:holup:644606306870886440>
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:22:44 3-bladed, symmetrical ?

plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:32:27 <:Bruhje139:602943011634020379>
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:32:39 and the t0nk copy cat
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:40:49 O
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:41:22 put an unpowered motor perpendicular to the steering rack
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:41:29 maybe put ropes to limit it's turning
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:43:23 now time to make rope swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:45:46 augh
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:45:49 you dum dum
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:45:52 not like this
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:46:05 so, the steering shakes ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:46:14 not like this goddamn it
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:47:19 
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:47:34 just put a hinge like that
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:47:51 oh and yeah, I take WR speedrun for fastest time making dependent suspension
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:47:59 **hah ! primitive earthlings !**
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:59:31 super long and chonk
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 14:59:34 ugli
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:34:54 what kind of tomfoolery are you trying to feed him ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:35:15 anti-funny shaky ? easy !
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:36:18 Unpowered motor and suspension and you're done
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:36:55 Don't forget to connect it to the suspension itself !
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:37:34 otherwise, either it'll turn your sus into a planet with wheels orbiting it, or it won't even work
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 03:37:38 " basic sus "

plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:47:32 " don't talk anything "
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:47:44 im no bot nor insane asylum patient
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:48:01 hm yes let's try vip2
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:50:51 he's never going to help you anyways cuz he thinks it's fun to waste a mind
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:51:07 but anyways, you can motor lock trail blocks
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:51:25 and mess with lifetime and transparency to create afterburners
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:52:04 *self-taught*
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:52:09 and obsession over it
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:52:34 but yeah, I watched a couple of videos on yt, then real suspension blueprint and then I realized
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:52:46 **they were all doing it backward**
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:54:07 for example : *why the fuck make a swing axle which has a camber when you can just angle a motor and call it a day*
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:54:15 that's what I did
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:54:23 but apparently, 34 people didn't agree with me
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:54:39 so I deleted my tutorial, but john being john *fucking* downloaded it
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:55:37 and they forgot live axle, shock absorber, torsion bar, etc
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:55:42 so I just did what I did
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:56:15 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:56:22 no one seemed to agree with me
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:56:57 so I go : *fuck this shit, let's make it just like them but complexify it*
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:57:12 
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:57:21 what you are seeing, is just a normal suspension
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:57:26 one spring and poof
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:57:35 except, I upgraded it
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:57:46 lol
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:58:00 
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:58:02 just a spring
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:58:06 literally
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:58:15 no motor connected to it or anything
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:58:42 just a spring, that's it, and it became a really good suspension
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:59:27 m
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:59:29 A
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:59:32 ARGH
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 12:59:46 TRYNA COPY PROTOTRODE ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:00:06 I mean, of course he is as good as me but he uses hax so i'll never be as good as he is
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:00:31 or is it you that thinks it's cringe for the 25443th time this day ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:00:37 O
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:00:54 well then, very simple
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:01:03 in fact, tank suspension is one of the simplest
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:02:47 
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:02:48 that;s it
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:02:57 just 2 unpowerd motor and a spring
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:03:17 and you got a basic christie that works insanely well if you fine-tune it and add ballast
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:03:28 yeah right
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:03:40 zoe : popular online f-
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:03:46 no im not going to tell it
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:04:00 
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:04:17 just an arm, a spring and 2 unpowered motor
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:04:54 otherwise, you can do it the old school style ( which also works insanely well, better than the arm design )
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:05:22 ossilating boogie
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:05:35 LMAO that doesn't exist
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:05:37 let me
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:07:21 ah yes as always, google being an ass when im explaining things
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:07:51 and also as always, people who are so damn obsessed with real life instead of looking at the HUGE picture right in front of them
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:08:20 google being an ass when I need it most
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:08:50 I just kinda got bored of suspension and switched to helicopter instead
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:09:07 because, the more complex they are, the more amazing they feel
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:09:27 smooth heavy duty adjustable ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:09:34 don't slow down there
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:09:44 Adjustable : Rope
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:09:54 Smooth : Fine-Tune the goddamn thing
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:10:21 Heavy Duty : a combination of them 2
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:11:01 " bellcrank suspension most common on japanese tank "
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:11:18 right.
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:11:48 **ossilating boogie**
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:12:02 it's literally just a hinge linked to 2 wheels
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:12:09 add whatever suspension to it if you like
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:12:25 no I don't
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:12:32 where the fuck is the spring
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:12:36 blocked by the shadow ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:12:42 and the camouflage ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:12:58 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:13:21 let me make an ossilating boogie and just turn it into a bellcrank
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:13:33 because I don't use exploits ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:13:45 uh huh much fair indeed

plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:14:46 stop being a shower in french and look at the huge picture right in front of you
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:14:58 if it's a hinge connected to 2 wheels
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:15:07 it's a **fucking** ossilating boogie
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:15:27 says the guys who only do suspension when he's bored
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:15:39 and is also obsessed in turning 3d into 2d
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:15:50 aka obsession with real life
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:16:41 oh god that trash youtuber's tutorial ?

plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:21:12 he makes trash build
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:21:30 he probably copied someone <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:21:47 fuck
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:22:05 no thumbnails, trash content and extreme toxicity, still gets 400 subs
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:22:42 did I mention his grammar is trash ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:22:56 im going to take him out, but im not promising
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:23:45 fortunately I do have a video of me buling him with some 50-second cutter-spinner but it doesn't show the chat and it's micheal P momemnt
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:24:29 false reporting him on YT because the system is broken ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:24:33 heck yes try that first
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:25:32 oh shit there is nothing I can report
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:25:48 godda make up a story with the " other " option then
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:26:05 oh shit even that doesn't work
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:26:27 it takes me to a shitty 4-step pep talk video by YT
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:26:56 also, bouncy suspension ? damping, ropes and ballast
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:27:32 and suspension that is too stiff will always try to go back to it's original position but it can't because it likes to do the funny
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:28:31 what do you mean ropes and ballast ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:28:36 well, you lost me.
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:30:09 this bum can figure it out by himself or get another one who's willing to help
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:30:22 ballast and ropes are the **very** basic of suspension
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:30:26 and you don't even know it
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:31:16 nope
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:31:32 how long did it take you to plan that ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:32:30 YES, THANK YOU GOD DAMN IT
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:36:07 and no thanks I don't even want to clear my name, I already destroyed one community with 11k people, gave up a wiki that was growing, had toxicity before and now him here *not* trying to do what I did in the past
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:36:30 thanks for the motivation
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:37:14 or is it just you who thinks that yourself ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:37:33 yes my name is josh, is there a problem ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:37:48 and trying to be a smartass ? never said im einstein
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:38:05 and insult people ? please don't start an argument
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:39:25 spread misinformation, yes, i'd like to lie to embarass myself
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:41:42 is it just me or I think this guy is trying to make people interested in his " bellcrank " and " japanese tanks suspension "
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:41:54 no thanks and don't start an argument out of it
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:42:17 or are you creating more ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:43:06 because you just did, start an argument because someone doesn't know about a topic you're interested in
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:43:13 yes, good
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:43:23 that's it, you should end an argument like that
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:43:29 not really anymore
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:43:40 uh
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:43:41 erm
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:43:42 cough
plane-crazy 2020-09-13 13:44:48 looks like you're trying to make yourself an expert in the topic you're interested in but it'll really just take that as natural human instinct so it's fine

plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:17:56 is this actually counted as exploit
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:18:04 if it is, then you're in trouble
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:18:39 wot
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:18:44 try me
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:21:05 " it's filters "
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:21:11 then why do I see an exploit window
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:22:04 filter window for the computer or the game ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:22:16 **it is exploit then**
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:22:21 no wait
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:22:31 just to be sure, is it just for the screen or for the game
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:22:49 if it's for the game, 'tis exploit
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:23:30 I didn't ask
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:23:40 I said, if it's a filter for the screen or for the game itself
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:24:06 you literally just avoided it with another unrelated answer
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:24:30 tell me, does it modify the game's graphic for yourself or just the computer screen
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:25:17 **it is exploits, then**
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:25:25 I don't have any social media
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:25:41 tell me if its for the screen or for the game
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:26:05 screen or game ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-17 13:26:29 if you don't know then just say it

general 2020-09-18 11:07:14 like, at one angle, it looks chonk and short, at another, it's " normal " sized
general 2020-09-18 11:07:37 well, sometimes, there are more upvotes than usual
general 2020-09-18 11:08:04 like, for example, poob build gets 4 upvotes, apply upvote boost, gets 8 upvotes
general 2020-09-18 11:08:28 let's just say it, more noob users that upvote everything active = more upvotes

plane-crazy 2020-09-18 11:34:23 stratofortress is quite chonk if you look at it
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 11:34:42 only if there was more weg I woulda have made it cleaner
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 11:42:41 well, I often base my builds off Euclid's Rule Of Geometric Work
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 11:43:01 I know it sounds over the top but making something geometric might look appealing
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 11:43:46 
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 11:44:09 the only example I can find, but there are **many** more

plane-crazy 2020-09-18 12:38:43 they think it's fun to waste a mind
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 12:39:03 it's a horrid thing to do, in terms of common sense
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 12:40:08 " huge ego "
plane-crazy 2020-09-18 12:40:33 I didn't say " I **will** get HoF ", I said I may

plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:07:30 * chimpanzee fight *
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:07:38 I agree, if they are well made
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:08:01 the problem with WW2 builders is that they want to get as close to real life as possible
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:08:05 thus, real life fanatic
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:08:37 they can't agree on what's more realistic and they always fight eachother because of it
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:08:49 me too I don't build ww2 plane
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:09:12 **REMEMBERS POOB CORSAIR I BUILT WHEN I WAS NEW TO THE GAME**

plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:10:04 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:10:28 indeed
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:10:49 real life fanatics, how do they even turn into one ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:11:26 tryna turn 3d vehicles into a 2d screen
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:11:47 by a game based on block measurement to build
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:11:57 you can't make something 3d into 2d, you simply can't
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:12:54 quit flaming about who's flying fortress is better, no one can make it as accurate as in 3d.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:13:30 of course, there is nothing wrong with trying to be accurate to real life
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:13:36 that's fine
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:14:03 but flaming eachother because something's unrealistic ? man, grow up, be more mature
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:14:43 it's literally like 2 chimpanzee fighting over a banana when they can split it in half
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:15:00 there is a fine line between flame and critisism
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:15:45 " wow ur flying fortress looks wrong and super unrealistic lmao "
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:15:52 critisism is this :
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:16:28 " your flying fortress looks decent, you can maybe improve on the wings and nose, they look kinda blocky, maybe add more wedges "
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:16:30 ^
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:16:34 this is critisism
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:17:02 of course, I admit my falken is too smol and the wings looks wrong xd
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:17:08 I will remake later
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:20:52 " wow ur mustang looks ass ", flaming, it's relatively short ( sometimes longer ), with an insult and sarcasm
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 03:21:58 " your mustang might need some improvement, the propeller is a bit shorter y know ", critisism, there is no insults and it gives a bit of an advice

plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:23:11 ^
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:23:15 every real life fanatic ever
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:24:38 turning 3d into 2d in a game based on cube measurement is simply impossible.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:24:42 you can't.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:25:19 I know
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:25:21 but no
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:26:21 I heard of
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:26:22 but no
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:26:26 you **can't**
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:26:44 LEL WHAT
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:26:55 REAL LIFE FANATIC AT IT AGAIN
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:26:57 LET ME SEE
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:28:48 constructive can't have an insult, otherwise, it's not constructive it's negative destructive.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:29:12 no not that
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:29:16 let me explain
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:29:55 real life fanatic always try to get as close as real life as possible, but the problem is, they don't keep it to themselves
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:30:41 and if they see a real life build that doesn't look to their liking, they will immediatly start flaming the creator of the build because either it doesn't look accurate enough or it doesn't have a certain feature
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:30:53 by accurate, i meant, " accurate "
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:31:56 wut
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:32:23 oh, and they often tend to go like " bruh your mustang looks ass mine is better and more accurate lmao "
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:32:27 something like that
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:33:19 of course !
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:33:27 a blocky mustang, sure it's bad
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:33:57 but a decent looking mustang that doesn't have that one feature your's has ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:34:21 it's not bad, you're just tryna being a douche if so
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:34:50 that's why I prefer custom, so em real life fanatic ain't gonna fight like a chimpanzee over it
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:35:07 well, that's kinda vague
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:35:25 by bad, you mean, not looking decent enough ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:35:27 I think so
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:36:13 you mean, it's blocky and doesn't has the right proportions ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:36:17 yeah, that can be bad
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:37:17 lol, his mil mi looks more like custom
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:37:27 but atleast it ain't half-bad
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:37:52 agreed
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:39:23 screenshots the chat to start argument, no thanks.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 11:40:02 oh ok

plane-crazy 2020-09-19 12:07:08 its supposed to be a chinese dragon apparently
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 12:07:18 but all I see is an abomination
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 12:13:11 i just flung a guy into the stratosphere with my swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 12:13:33 I think swashplate can fling objects up to 1k blocks
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 12:14:01 otherwise i'd stick in it and either it will glitch itself out or the opposite
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 12:14:08 but the opposite happens most

plane-crazy 2020-09-19 12:51:58 definition may vary
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 12:52:19 but on pc, jet wash caused by speed reduction
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 12:52:44 that's on-par with jet wash because, engine shuts off you lose speed

plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:06:55 already deleted it no need.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:07:03 but you can scroll up chat.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:08:33 LOTS and LOTS of real life fanatic not even agreeing on the design so I made it like they wanted to then another one says it looks ass, and plus, john joining the game to annoy me even more
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:08:55 so I deleted it and problem solved
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:09:36 they actually do, and there's 1k of em.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:09:50 I just put fanatic for kicks as some coy word
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:10:25 nOOO

plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:11:18 nOOOOoooOo
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:11:32 I can't really get a straight definition for it
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:12:42 but let's say in a shellnut : People acting like undertale fandom member on a build they think don't even look accurate enough because the proportions are wrong, doesn't have a specific feature, isn't smooth enough and etc.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:12:50 but that's just in a shellnut
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:13:05 no
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:13:09 overestimation
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:13:16 17% i'd say
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:13:20 but percentage is pp
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:13:35 I say, 1k people atleast are real life fanatic
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:14:03 if you're ever seen undertale fandom member do their thing, you know what I mean
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:14:23 oh c'mon, giving up because it doesn't look accurate enough ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:14:33 I mean you can always remake

plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:16:43 trying to build as accurate as possible is normal and totally fine
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:17:25 but flaming others because it doesn't look as what your vision of the real life build is, man, get mature
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:17:37 o
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:18:45 if there is an insult with a sprinkle of elitism and sarcasm, it is flaming then.
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:19:25 still arguing because *they made me had to do it*
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:19:33 but ok, no more arguing

plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:23:11 I mean, PF community isn't that bad, but considering the amount of salty unde in there hiding in the disc, welp
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:25:30 PF community has nice people in it, it isn't that bad overall, and some anime pff are actually pretty nice and helpful
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:25:49 but there's too many gay mods and undes there, so the inevitable happens
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:28:56 **yes**
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:29:17 kick because someone using m60
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:29:25 ngl m60 needs nerfing
plane-crazy 2020-09-19 14:29:29 **more smoke**

plane-crazy 2020-09-20 01:48:42 everyone named red that i've ever met on the internet is a hothead
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 01:49:59 he's probably another real life fanatic that saw my b-52 and whines about it.
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 01:50:11 never making another b-52, ever.

plane-crazy 2020-09-20 05:08:37 kinda funny
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:10:17 20 more upvote I woulda have submitted it for HoF, but there's not enough detail, plus the build itself was **extremely** glitchy

creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:15:10 to me\
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:15:53 well, lots of motor lock doesn't mean it's good

creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:16:16 you can see someone used extensive motor lock but his plane just looks a bit bad
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:16:56 well, the problem is, we don't care about stats
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:17:00 we only care about the looks
creations-chat 2020-09-20 05:17:14 so even if you say it goes 5000, nobody cares

general 2020-09-20 14:03:03 M
general 2020-09-20 14:03:17 for me, TNF server

general 2020-09-20 14:04:09 how has it gotten so suddenly popular
general 2020-09-20 14:04:27 they say it's because popular twitch streamer started to randomly play it
general 2020-09-20 14:04:38 and also the " Emergency Meeting " meme
general 2020-09-20 14:05:00 I call for commercializing memes !
general 2020-09-20 14:05:15 apple has done it before
general 2020-09-20 14:05:21 so why not do it for themselves
general 2020-09-20 14:05:40 a dev makes an alt account and post a meme related to their game and pray that it gets popular
general 2020-09-20 14:05:46 60% of the time, **it works**
general 2020-09-20 14:06:01 I call for commercial memes !
general 2020-09-20 14:06:28 and also commissioning twitch streamer to play it
general 2020-09-20 14:06:44 I godda say, that's some effective marketing right there
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 14:07:26 everything is easy for you because you make it with low effort ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-20 14:07:30 me too

plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:04:10 same
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:04:16 corean grammar
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:05:16 this guy gave me 2 strokes
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:05:36 first, claiming that he had a better nose then showing me the cringe boing nose technique from 2018
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:05:54 then, this sentence that is pure corean grammar
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:06:32 2018 technique only good if hidden to make it look smoother
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:06:40 vungiliek made such a nose
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:06:45 it looks gube
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:06:58 he comes
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:07:40 no
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:07:43 it's excellent
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:07:52 not even
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:08:06 cringe boing nose technique doesn't even look smooth and looks ass
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:08:40 real life fanatic detected
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:08:56 now, commit silence, real life fanatic.
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:09:17 YES
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:09:19 AGREED
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:09:44 boeing layer nose technique from 2018 is definite cringe
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:09:55 BUT
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:10:04 we might have a way to remaster it
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:10:07 MOTOR LOCK
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:10:40 combine vertical layer, horizontal layer and triangle, motor lock them together and the resulting nose might look smooth
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:11:01 so maybe boeing nose technique *might* not be so cringe after all
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:11:15 im actually going to make one and see if it actually looks good
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:11:26 if it looks good, **popularizing time**
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:11:51 agreed
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:11:54 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:12:03 im trying that right now
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:12:43 I wanna see if it looks smooth and not eye-hurting old-ass fossil from 2018 cringe technique for boeing planes
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:12:57 let's test
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:19:26 alright I tried
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:19:44 2 layers of it
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:19:58 LOCK
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:20:24 it does look smoother but like, wedgy
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:20:33 I like it more than the old version
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:20:52 but im no expert on cringe 2018 technique
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:20:57 so if anyone is
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:21:04 motor lock em layers xd
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:21:08 see if it looks better
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:21:34 YOU BETTER TRY
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:21:36 OR ELSE
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:21:39 WE WATERBOARD YOU
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:22:11 U, THE EXPERT ON THE 2018 TECHNIQUE, DEW IT FOR THE SAKE OF TECHNIQUES
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:23:15 No explosive for command on lock
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:23:19 but since this is experiment
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:23:21 allowed
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:23:41 coz, explosive, is ( no im going to get lots of hates and I already got lots of hate and I don'
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:23:53 t want more <...212!@>!21.@!@ )

plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:28:21 good lord they got clapped by the mods
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:28:44 and synth also joined in for a bit but then he realized it was cyberbullying and he stopped
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:31:12 I forgot about the existance of mechs until I saw one in creations

plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:35:08 robloc moderation system, doesn't even exist and never will
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:35:53 what if robloc moderation system actually works
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:35:58 <:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:36:09 so many false reports
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:36:13 imagine
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:36:29 and it's also the bestest of all ways to prove if someone is unde or not
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:37:01 if he thinks robloc moderation system works, no doubts, it's a unde dead along.
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:38:00 wedge tank 2.0, 3rd version better not be eye-destroying and have less wedges
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:38:20 actually, let's just make a futuristic tank with ALOT less wedges than wedge tank 2.0
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:38:35 I know.
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:38:40 **eye-shattering**
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 13:39:35 im gon make a futuristic t0nk, but this time it's smooth instead of full japanese spiky blind lobster wedge technique
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 14:06:43 👍
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 14:09:17 with some refinement and dedication + some popularization, the plane nose and intakes of the near future will look much pog indeed
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 14:09:33 **better act fast and make it first**
plane-crazy 2020-09-22 14:09:42 +200
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:24:35 ah yes, new faces during my absence
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:24:48 gub, the more user, the better
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:25:27 your steering is shaking ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:25:33 easy fix, gimme 5 min
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:26:19 aha, I see, people in need to help indeed
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:26:24 the fix is quite simple actually
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:26:46 you just put ropes on the motor2
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:26:52 and tighten them
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:27:04 that's the easiest way, but not efficient
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:27:07 i'll show you
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:27:13 by efficient, I meant, space
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:27:39 I've never made a steering racks but I know physics
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:27:47 I don't think I can help much xd
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:27:54 just put motor2 with anti shake
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:31:20 your typical realistic steering with motor2, it shakes, right ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:32:17 ez
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:32:36 just tighten the ropes until it shakes no more
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:32:48 the easiest way indeed.
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:33:04 but it's not space-efficient really.
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:33:10 **there is another**
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:34:15 
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:34:31 this the other way
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:34:38 hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:34:41 summon the god
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:34:57 <@!262001177422594048>  looks like a job for you, get going.
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:35:42 hmm yes he seems to be offline
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:36:43 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:37:03 ergh
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:38:02 alright, so this is how the other one works, basically, motor2 makes a turn and the springs compress or decompress depending on which way it turns, and it will absorb **all** the shock from shaking
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:38:22 you will see no shaking since the shock is absorbed by the maxed-out springs
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:38:51 u 2
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:39:02 you, and the other guy
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:39:35 kinda took me a while to get an anti-shake " mechanism "
plane-crazy 2020-09-24 13:49:47 it's not even confusing, just look at the ***motors***
creations-chat 2020-09-24 14:05:31 the second picture

plane-crazy 2020-09-25 10:50:00 and it's fully articulated
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 10:50:06 and he doesn't even use any exploits at all
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 10:51:56 
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 10:52:09 ONE BLOCK

plane-crazy 2020-09-25 10:53:05 yep
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 10:53:21 he's pretty much the new helicopter god, sakura is beaten.
plane-crazy 2020-09-25 13:30:21 alright, after 2 hours of suffering, time to show my playface
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:10:51 someone let a fucking furry in vip1

plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:17:18 lingering on my past to cause argument and trouble, really ? can't they grow up ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:18:16 " hE lOoKs liKe A tYpIcAl ToXiC 8 yEaRs OlD "
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:18:44 " I fOuNd HiS aCcOunT, tIme tO deStrOy him "

plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:21:08 ignoring him is best
creations-chat 2020-09-26 00:22:04 nice spaceship
creations-chat 2020-09-26 00:22:20 I'd say, once it gets upvote boost in creations, it has a chance to get HoF
creations-chat 2020-09-26 00:22:39 but hof voting is SUPER picky, and I hate that.
creations-chat 2020-09-26 00:23:12 I'd just be satisfied getting expert or something, master is kinda hard to get
creations-chat 2020-09-26 00:23:37 ja
creations-chat 2020-09-26 00:24:47 but the voting is EXTREMELY picky, I better get real life build if I want HoF
creations-chat 2020-09-26 00:25:13 60 steps
creations-chat 2020-09-26 00:25:30 all of them is pain and suffering.
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:26:12 it's better to ignore this unde in DP's discord also calling me a unde
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:26:32 when he's in a unde-related youtuber discord
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:27:37 I will strike at the slightest provokation, if he makes a video talking shit on me, I better see it wiped out with the precisions never before seen on the internet
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:28:01 uhhh
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:28:04 no

plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:32:51 
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:32:53 more like " a fucking underage "

plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:34:38 if he makes a video talking shit on me, i'll sanction him accordingly
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:34:57 but he probably don't have the balls and plus he's underage himself
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 00:35:00 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:11:20 **ignore the past.**

plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:14:16 but I meant in a joking manner lol
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:14:39 it's a reference to the lyrics of " Rapping for Jeuse "
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:15:02 yeah  I know, it's sick
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:16:54 him
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:18:36 there never was any argument in the first place wdym ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:24:43 it took him 9 hours to photoshop it
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:24:54 and also to come up with it
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:25:06 sike, let's just move on
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:25:43 no, for john
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:25:53 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:26:16 everyone named red that i've ever met on the internet is such a hot head
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:26:36 better to commit silence and minimize trouble
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:28:19 also, you guys talkin' in <#384021699466756107> ? go and talk about flags and r0manians elsewhere
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:35:12 argument and elitism moment

plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:43:33 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:56:53 ok, so first, people doing elitism, then toxic chat, then normal chat then a dead chat
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 03:57:01 that escaladed quickly
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 04:03:46 lmao
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 04:04:19 no more g4y stuff, that's probably one of the reason why PCC was super toxic before
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 04:59:00 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>

plane-crazy 2020-09-26 06:11:08 ye
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 06:25:11 <@!386974424538152960> yo, how do you make fabric wing panel not freak out and fling into oblivion ? ( even when the devil went down to georgia, it still has a seizure )
general 2020-09-26 06:42:39 
the-dump 2020-09-26 06:45:43 make double wishbone suspension
the-dump 2020-09-26 06:46:13 make a non-coaxial helicopter
the-dump 2020-09-26 06:46:41 make a swashplate
the-dump 2020-09-26 06:47:14 fully articulated
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 06:56:43 no
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 06:59:36 it's a he, don't be fewled
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 06:59:41 but then, what does he uses ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:01:48 no argument, ok ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:01:57 I say, A HE !
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:02:04 I have a sister and I know woman well !
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:02:56 synth 300%
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:05:30 he was good.
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:05:39 what's the reason he got banned then ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:05:56 not all
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:06:02 but i'll tell you :
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:06:16 - Fabric has more friction and is also hella light, but glitchy on wings
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:06:30 shitposting everywhere ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:06:55 fabric wing panel is so good for heli rotor blade, or any blades
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:07:02 coz it's lighter
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:07:46 diamond plate also great for heli blades, weight creates a gyroscopic effect
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:08:04 indeed
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:08:21 gyroscope isn't really that hard
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:08:32 spin weight around and call it a day !
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:10:43 generaly, just add more wedges
general 2020-09-26 07:16:56 how come they call BYOB hard rock ?
general 2020-09-26 07:17:26 
general 2020-09-26 07:17:45 it's not even hard rock, it's called a " Goddamn Good Song "
general 2020-09-26 07:18:03 " pop "
general 2020-09-26 07:18:56 POP ? YOU SAY IT'S A POP SONG ? **BLAST OFF !**
general 2020-09-26 07:21:02 why her cloth so fucking straight like a businessmen suit
general 2020-09-26 07:21:31 gimme
general 2020-09-26 07:22:04 *yes*
general 2020-09-26 07:22:36 👌
general 2020-09-26 07:23:17 BYOB guitar intro so fucking hard to play unless you have a stratocasted 8-string
general 2020-09-26 07:23:50 I know better.
general 2020-09-26 07:24:09 I'll never reveal what's the better
general 2020-09-26 07:24:13 **never**
general 2020-09-26 07:26:07 *play along* 😉
general 2020-09-26 07:26:26 if he does the thing...
general 2020-09-26 07:27:36 well, I got 5 minutes of hate for it
general 2020-09-26 07:27:47 and 475 people agreed
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:31:13 45 speed = 430 rpm
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:31:16 sak said
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:31:24 I was too lazy to divide it
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:32:44 1.04 multiplier, hwat
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:33:11 ah no, 10.4
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:33:24 add a dot in 430 and divide it, call it a day
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:33:42 so, each speed =  10.5 more RPM
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:33:53 robloc ain't that accurate
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:34:11 so, 10.5 per speed it seems
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:35:32 indeed
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:36:22 I fucking love that quote
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:37:00 there's also a quote by Niki that says " People calls me a bitch, but they won't stop bringing out the bitch in me "
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:37:13 ye
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:37:41 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:37:48 no, 10.5
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:37:57 coz, superior number
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:38:03 so it was speed
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:38:04 damn
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 07:38:20 revise euclid division I should
the-dump 2020-09-26 07:43:30 good thing mods are offline

general 2020-09-26 07:50:20 once the spanish teacher spotted me and said " aja ! finalemente te encontrado ! es horas de aprender los maneras ! "

general 2020-09-26 07:51:39 who let the noob in
general 2020-09-26 07:54:47 ok, so I made a not-completely symmetrical 5 blade rotor
general 2020-09-26 07:55:10 and it's actually fine so long as you got stock engine driven rotor
general 2020-09-26 07:56:23 lead drag will help, but i'll try motor locking the thing
general 2020-09-26 07:56:24 ok
general 2020-09-26 07:58:18 ooooo, if I motor lock it, it's a bit more symmetrical
general 2020-09-26 07:58:26 alright, what about true motor lock ?

plane-crazy 2020-09-26 11:58:32 since HoF voting is super picky, that's why, but to increase the chance of getting 60 upvotes, **make something from real life**
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 11:58:42 or just something original really.
plane-crazy 2020-09-26 11:59:08 unobtainable

general 2020-09-27 10:46:07 well, the reason rick did that is that people are so dumb they can't even figure out how to fly the tutorial plane due to the camera apparently

plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:27:03 why do i think it kinda sounds like undes asking " who's the hacker " when they can see a floating player right in front of them
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:27:47 no, just no
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:28:47 that mod, too bad I can't remember his name but he was ***o m e g a*** gay, I think he got banned for that

plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:31:55 o k
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:31:59 oh no
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:32:17 if the real life fanatic sees this, their rage will be beyond human
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:32:52 do not do the confused
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:33:52 a custom real life build, that's the purest of rage fuel for them
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:35:46 I literally explained to you the definition of a real life fanatic some days ago
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:38:49 real life fanatic in a shellnut : A person who's obsessed with real life build, and if they find a real life build that looks ' inaccurate ' to them, they'll throw on a fit of rage and whine about the vehicle because it doesn't look ' accurate ' enough according to them
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:38:55 whew, that was kinda hard to define
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:40:02 " bro your mustange is so fukcn wromg, the wingas isn't that lomng and it's ibverted lmao "
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:40:06 ^
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:40:10 every real life fanatic ever
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:40:20 atleast the most intense one
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:40:58 yeah, there is nothing wrong with building as accurate as possible
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:41:25 but, throwing in a fit of pure unfiltered rage at someone's build because it doesn't look accurate enough according to you ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:41:32 so immature lmao
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:41:52 sometimes they don't throw a fit of rage, they will just whine about it
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:42:06 you just have to ignore them and move on lul
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:42:13 uhhh
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:42:59 well, if you tweak them to their liking, it will trigger another real life fanatic that will whine about it
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:43:09 then you tweak it to HIS liking, but another one complains
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:43:13 then it starts a war
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:43:31 I literally do not get real life fanatic's thinking
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:44:02 yeah, they are
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:44:22 koug
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:44:34 they don't even help
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:44:38 they don't give advice at all
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:44:54 they just try and burn you alive for not making your build to their liking
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:45:06 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:45:13 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:45:14 yup
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:45:53 L I E S

plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:46:05 cough
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:46:13 not even
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:46:36 I mean, you may like some of his techniques, but people has different taste tho
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:46:42 yup
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:47:44 2707 won contest yes, coz it actually looks half-decent compared to the others

plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:48:22 advice ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:48:25 **advice ?**
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:48:37 it was only him tweaking it to his liking, that's literally all he did
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:49:00 the swashplate help was gube but for other builds ? it's just tweaking to his liking
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:49:37 why do I see a real life fanatic
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:50:03 dude has done 3 things that fits my definition
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:50:23 he tried to give me a pep talk on how good he is at tank suspension and shit
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:50:34 then he says my b-52 nu gud
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:50:40 then this

plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:52:29 there is a super fine line between being a troll, an ass, and an actual critic
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:52:49 real life fanatic
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:52:52 c

plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:52:59 agreed
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:53:49 it's not help, it's beating up someone for a build that considers as " bad " till it's to his liking

plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:54:29 holup, 1 day ago was also argument

plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:55:18 I never was.
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:55:48 I would never beat up a man for his build because it doesn't look to my likings
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:55:55 NEVER.

plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:57:52 that would stratocast the toxicity
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:58:10 one day without an argument, I say that is a bad sign
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:58:53 I don't wanna get back to the old day where there were constant argument everywhere and toxicity was beyond human
plane-crazy 2020-09-27 13:59:31 if there is argument within 7 hours of now, that's the edge of the apocalype

plane-crazy 2020-09-29 00:46:53 y'know, back then, they've NEVER called this attitude toxic, at all, but I guess, society evolves.
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 00:47:06 giving me some tips would be helpful.

plane-crazy 2020-09-29 01:00:17 master supreme, it depends on almost everything
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 01:03:49 be as popular as synthetic was, then have pog builds like puri, and submit to HoF your creations, and pray that it actually gets 10 votes in vip.
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 01:03:59 definitely not an easy task
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 01:04:33 indeed
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 01:04:57 as more the better the builds get, less people get impressed by creations that normally would get into HoF because they've already seen a better build

plane-crazy 2020-09-29 01:20:51 should I ping one if so ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 01:22:01 HOLD UP

plane-crazy 2020-09-29 01:23:48 so I post a picture and it automatically gets into the voting channel
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 01:23:53 understood
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 01:29:28 wait is being in HOF sufficient to get master or do you need to get the block count ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 01:29:58 fork
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 01:30:23 I better get 4k block count if I wanna get a build into HoF

plane-crazy 2020-09-29 03:38:52 but you can just use locked motors
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 03:43:20 how is epic gamer rank even obtained ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 03:43:46 something tells me you need modeler, inventor and expert to get it
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 03:45:44 wha-
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 03:46:01 inventor is unobtainable, so basically, no one can ever get it
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 03:47:25 it's unobtainable
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 03:47:35 due to the controversy surrounding it
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 03:47:59 coz, some unde thought his creation was inventor-worthy and he started WW3
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 03:48:34 and also because someone made a wheel that moves only by weight, gets inventor anyways
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 03:49:31 so, is it forever unobtainable or they're going to decide on something ?
plane-crazy 2020-09-29 03:54:50 yes, I saw the dude who made it was an ancient player lul

bug-reports 2020-09-29 05:46:48 rickje made everything else
bug-reports 2020-09-29 05:47:42 this basically means that, if you change something in the code, everything else will be broken as well
bug-reports 2020-09-29 05:47:50 hard coding extremely bad indeed

plane-crazy 2020-10-01 12:44:34 henlo
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 12:44:45 has the community been a gube boi during my absence or not ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 12:45:50 yikes
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 12:46:00 what is it ? arguments ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 12:46:31 coz if there's constant argument, we're going back to the old days full of elitism bullshit and toxicity that reeks fukushima
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 12:52:58 
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 13:03:28 *i got harrased when i first joined because the community was extremely toxic at that time*
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 13:03:46 *that's why i don't even want to be like the past where they were like they were*
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 13:04:22 *a bad meme*
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 13:04:32 true
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 13:04:36 
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 13:05:13 I think that plane crazy has some kind of unique toxicity that's hard to find
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 13:05:21 it's the " snowflake community " type
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 13:05:59 where someone gets easily offended by something then he gets all toxic about it, then another one sees it and gets offended and repeats the vicious circle
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 13:06:29 people don't expect a game this peaceful with lots of freedom of creativity to be this toxic
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 13:06:37 that's why they're so sensitive to insults
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 13:07:03 coz, it doesn't fit their expectations of what the community would be
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 13:07:54 to fix this, you just have to ping everyone to <#533294912586645521>  and say " don't be a snowflake, if someone makes a joke out of you, don't take it seriously "
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 13:08:23 jokes has never hurt anyone really, it's just that people are super sensitive to insults, that's why
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 13:10:26 RageFlake

They didn't expect a game this peaceful with freedom of creativity to have such a " toxic " community, gets offended by the slightest phrase someone utters about them negatively or jokingly
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 13:11:04 if someone memes about you, just laugh it off, it's not like it bit you in the ass
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 13:22:01 I never critized anything, show me a screenshot damn it
plane-crazy 2020-10-01 13:22:17 I mean, youtube yes, but here, hell no

plane-crazy 2020-10-01 13:23:17 and it's not a rant, it's what it is.

plane-crazy 2020-10-02 14:16:29 
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 14:16:34 just add rockets
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 14:16:43 it works because, crap physics
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 14:17:10 instead of rockets, replace with hover engine if you wish
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 14:19:37 too big ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 14:19:56 you can just replace with hover engine instead of the rocket thrusters to hide them
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 14:20:11 and yes it is ez, im not doing gingster or anything
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 14:20:19 and I wasn't talking about swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 14:20:37 **it was about non-coaxial rotors**
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 14:22:01 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 14:22:09 plop a rocket on and that's it
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 14:32:48 woah the lift on the thing if it would be used tho
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 14:33:53 propeller blade has terrible speed but the lift tho
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 14:34:02 place it vertically and geronimo

general 2020-10-03 04:48:12 put rocket and it makes it non-coaxial
general 2020-10-03 04:48:23 you don't need a tail rotor to counter the torque if you put rocket

general 2020-10-03 04:54:27 happi
general 2020-10-03 04:54:40 ye
general 2020-10-03 04:55:47 how to swashplate ?
general 2020-10-03 04:55:52 rope or motors ?
general 2020-10-03 04:56:19 rope more compac but kinda inconsistent
general 2020-10-03 04:56:50 motor not kompac but very functional and reliable ( glitchy if there is lag )
general 2020-10-03 04:56:58 counter torque ?
general 2020-10-03 04:57:14 so, say, main rotor is 50 speed and 3 torque
general 2020-10-03 04:57:20 no wait
general 2020-10-03 04:57:26 35 speed 3 torque
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 05:26:05 ah yes, now 4 bladed
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 05:26:10 but still inconsistent
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 05:26:34 rope swashplate has always been inconsistent but it's compact and stable atleast
general 2020-10-03 05:27:10 I'm so silent in school, people **actually** thinks im autistic
general 2020-10-03 05:27:25 then they tried to harass me but I just give them a blank stare
general 2020-10-03 05:27:54 and it actually works, it actually fucking works
general 2020-10-03 05:28:15 they tried to steal my backpack to see if I react, I just give an emotionless blank stare
general 2020-10-03 05:28:24 then they just put it back
general 2020-10-03 05:29:16 just emotionlessly and blankly stare into their soul, it's like some kind of glitch in the matrix that scares people away
general 2020-10-03 05:30:11 nah

general 2020-10-03 05:31:07 superb book
general 2020-10-03 05:31:18 so many real life hacks in it
general 2020-10-03 05:31:44 for example : 2 people are having a fight, just step in-between them while eating a snack
general 2020-10-03 05:31:51 they'll instantly stop
general 2020-10-03 05:32:09 or, look at people's eye to clear out a crowd
general 2020-10-03 05:32:24 it'd be like moses opening the sea in 2, literally
general 2020-10-03 05:32:34 but it won't work if you have glasses lel
general 2020-10-03 05:34:26 wait until you try it then.
general 2020-10-03 05:34:29 it actually works

plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:01:00 
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:02:18 you should be grateful a full server saved you from the apocalypse
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:03:10 real
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:06:46 why is everyone stealing build from museum and put it in front of jay
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:07:17 no
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:07:55 <:YouTried:559530066258821131>
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:09:23 when you realized your only chance of getting hof is to make a real life build
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:09:30 
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:10:02 coz I didn't look
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:10:10 but getting custom into hof pretty hard
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:10:30 literally half of the builds there is just real life
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:10:37 but
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:10:50 im not going for real life
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:10:59 custom or nothing
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:11:58 hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:12:26 bro
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:12:29 you
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:12:31 cut
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:12:34 my line
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:12:48 half of the builds are just real life
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:13:02 to get custom, you godda make it look insanely good and also befriend VIP
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:13:16 but befriending vip doesn't exist
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:13:29 so, get an insane amount of luck
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:14:05 no, it's super luck based and picky
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:14:21 to increase chance : **real life build**
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:14:25 but im not going for real life
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:14:28 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:14:34 you just godda make it look good
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:14:44 but someone, people prefer real life
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:14:50 but I will aim for custom
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:14:54 real life not my thing
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:15:21 agony
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:15:41 I looked at blackhawk picture the nose is a bit long and wide
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:15:54 but in a video, it's stubbed and a bit wide
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:15:59 this is getting confusing
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:16:05 i'll go for stubbed nose
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:16:18 > real life not my thing
<:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:16:30 irony
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:17:18 " mad scientist is the hardest jojo you'll never get it "
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:17:24 how about I get it ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:17:48 someone told me that
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:17:57 gonna prove him wrong later
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:18:30 
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:18:41 and yes I think modeler is hella hard to get lel
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:18:46 YES IT IS HELLA EASY TO GET
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:18:55 " HARDEST RANK YOU'LL NEVER GET IT "
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:19:23 I'LL PHAKING GET IT, WACTCH ME <:Trigje139:559518788660232196> <:Trigje139:559518788660232196> 😤
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:19:56 VTOL engineer is the hardest to get in HOF I think
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:20:01 master supreme
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:20:04 yikes
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:20:14 you godda be dedicated to get it
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:20:27 but the best tip to get master supreme is :
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:20:30 **good luck**
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:20:57 it is
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:21:07 I think there is only like 5 people who have it
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:21:18 no, maybe trains are the hardest to get
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:21:37 ground ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:21:38 dude
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:22:08 <:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:22:20 ok so, make a 5k block thing
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:22:40 cram unnecessary motor lock on it
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:22:47 and just add some VTOL function
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:22:53 no life rank ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:22:59 i've already gotten it
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:23:30 every rank
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:23:34 **every rank**
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:24:08 so no life is impossible to get if it includes ranks you can't get anymore
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:24:46 no life might be a little easier to get if we exclude all ranks that are too difficult to obtain like admin or the   rank
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:25:38 the   rank
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:25:42 only voxel has it
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:26:25 poo rank ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:26:32 <:what:644996672048463942>
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:26:55 you can't get incentor
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:26:57 inventor
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:27:09 so basically, no life is impossible to get
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:27:21 coz you can't even get no life
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:28:06 this is completely broken
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:28:11 
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:28:17 the  rank
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:28:44 inventor is impossible to get
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:28:47 so basically
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:28:50 <:Bruhje139:602943011634020379>
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:29:05 you mean
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:29:07 impossible
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:29:11 since it's unobtainable
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:29:20 so is master
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:30:15 gosh blackhawk nose is so annoying
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:30:37 no u
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:33:01 LOOK WHAT HE DID TO ME AFTER I BLACKLIST HIM
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:33:10 <:KEKW:670310537300672528> <:KEKW:670310537300672528> <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:34:27 this is too good I godda save it
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:35:18 lul
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:36:50 I have no talent, I don't even make huge-ass build with lots of detail
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:39:47 yeah, first time I joined
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:40:07 i got unpog move'd by 7 manchilds ( now thankfully all banned )
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:40:22 I regret but then I came back
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:41:02 now it's better without those 7 foking undes that harassed me when I first joinded
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:41:44 he came back <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:42:11 ahhh phok the entire's server's against me or what
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:42:52 I can't really remember the 7 undes who did unpog move but I can remember one of them was vietcong ambush
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:43:17 this guy was a fucking manchild thinking he's the biggest gangster lmao
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:43:33 good thing he was banned or whatever happened to him
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:44:37 https://youtu.be/iW_IxNLNvrY
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:44:45 *there's always a bigger fish*
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:46:00 did I mention he stalked me in the game multiple time with his equally mentally deficient friend and photoshopped a chat of me ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:46:07 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:46:19 good thing he's fucking gone lmao
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:47:01 yeah, I better make a custom helicopter instead of a blackhawk
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:49:13 oh so this was my answer to my question ( that I never asked )
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:49:26 so that's how you easily get master VTOL then
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:49:29 🧠
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:49:43 just make that thing look infinitely better and get 60 uppies
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:50:20 im guessing, prototype bell valor
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:50:57 but still, it beats the shit out of me, why do they always put 3 blades instead of 4 blades
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:51:05 it's literally more stable than 3 blades
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:51:27 they complaint about stability problem and lack of power lift, **fucking make it 4 bladed then**
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:51:45 YET AGAIN
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:52:03 should I punish him or not ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:53:52 IT WAS HIM
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:54:03 THE MAN BEHIND THE BLACKLIST OVERREACTION
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:54:26 40 to 100 chance
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:54:32 but like, it's not a maybe
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:54:40 it's a " probably not "
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:54:45 PUNISH
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:54:56 agony
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:55:49 mechanics ? I spent too much time on mechanics instead of design
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:56:02 but not to worry tho, I can make complex origamis
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:56:09 **robert J lang, boi**
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:56:17 so I understand stuff better
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:57:25 if reports opens up again ( but it never will )
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:57:31 **killer is dead**
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 13:57:36 or he already is
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:02:21 he's using exploits or what ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:02:44 i didn't blacklist him
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:03:04 yep
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:03:12 how
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:03:32 I unblacklist you and it doesn't even budge
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:03:34 sad
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:04:03 l i e s
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:04:23 change this we must
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:05:04 i didn't notice it

plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:08:58 no no harrier and f-35 is SVTOL
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:09:22 HVTOL is mi-24 and mi-26 takeoff
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:09:35 it has to take off horizontally like a plane due to it's weight
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:10:03 
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:10:09 better
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:10:15 now, for everything else

plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:42:39 hm
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:42:49 rope hell stable but inconsistent and can go weirdchamp
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:42:58 motor hella unstable but it obeys
plane-crazy 2020-10-03 14:43:15 but once anythings is wrong, it just goes weirdchamp

plane-crazy 2020-10-04 07:58:45 buff expert shipwright requirement
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 07:59:07 it's too easy to get it since literally everyone makes 6k blocks 4 fold ships
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:00:13 poob.
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:00:41 nerf vehicle specialist, since like, 30 people only make 4k blocks land vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:02:06 exactely
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:02:18 who the phok makes 4k block land vehicles ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:03:59 like, boil the block count down to 1200 for master rank
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:04:17 coz 5x5 cylinder wheel vehicles typically are only around 400 - 800 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:04:40 **there can never be overdetailing**
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:07:00 **overdetailing**
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:07:04 **only made it worst**
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:07:23 there is no overdetailing
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:07:32 there's only making it look good or worst
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:12:29 ugly yourself
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:14:47 got em
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:16:56 yeah but still
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:17:05 they just get them stuck because they don't care about suspension
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:17:17 they kinda just slap a torsion bar that can easily snap
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:17:28 or an ossilating boogie
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:17:49 they don't care about tank suspension, all they do is firepower
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:28:55 
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:29:15 bro, what even is this effect ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:29:19 never happened to me
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:29:47 pretty sure it's another name for dissymetry of lift
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:30:01 but my swashplate doesn't have any of those effects
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:30:14 *they never were*
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:30:22 *it was all hard coded by rickje*
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:32:08 gyroscope = spinning / moving weight around and it makes things stable
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:32:24 that's why some helicopter like mi-26 has to take off horizontally
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:32:31 due to the weight it has
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 08:32:42 it will be more stable to take off horizontally

plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:16:28 AAAAAA
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:17:01 coz, I build mostly technical stuff
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:17:04 and I almost never make planes
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:17:14 and you don't even know if im worst than him
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:17:31 of course he's gonna find my worst build and try to cripple me with it
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:17:49 welp, go and downvote the chonk blackhawk and my wedge tank
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:17:56 I don't have a best build
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:18:21 5 planes isn't much
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:18:36 I almost never make them
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:19:09 phok you dyno
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:19:16 5 emojies and it's considered as spamming
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:20:43 now all I need is more half-triangle wedges
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:20:49 agony
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:20:53 physical pain
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:21:22 oh wait, **motor lock cramming to smoothen it out**
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:21:55 my wedge tank is worst
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:22:07 and I made it intentionally very ugly
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:23:05 oh hey it's the cringe boeing nose technique but now it's smooth and actually looks half-decent
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:23:55 when you are lazy
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:25:19 that's not the cringe technique
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:25:23 that's the *new one*
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:25:31 or the much better one
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:26:14 so it's the *much better one*
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:27:45 17 times the word unde used as an insult, *a record !*

plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:40:34 godda change that
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:41:13 - makes 2k block plane with unnecessary motor lock cramming
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:41:20 - only made like, 10 planes
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:41:31 **what could possibly go wrong !**
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:41:40 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:41:47 **flashback**
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:42:49 it was at that moment I realized that people only really care about the looks of the build
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:43:07 and also that real life fanatics actually exist and can be a problem if they do unpog moves
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:43:45 so basically, im aiming for custom this time
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:43:52 real life only rarely
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:44:03 you actually should
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:44:12 it's kinda better than making real life
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:44:38 tryna turn a 3d thing into 2d, but then something looks wrong and you correct it then you have agony and etc
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:45:38 oh, and it gets worst from that part
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:46:40 you make something and it looks decent to you, then you post it in creations, only to have a downvote bomb and people whining about the proportions being wrong or not having a specific feature even tho you made it as you see fit and it looks right to you.
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:46:58 ***never make real life builds, teenagers.***
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:47:48 just don't listen to these people ( whom I coyed a name for : real life fanatics )
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:47:56 just ignore them to oblivion
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:48:07 it won't cause a big deal if you do
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:49:19 if they harrass you for apparently making a real life build look wrong, **ignore them**
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:49:34 actually, real life fanatics are just horrible judgemental people
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 09:50:02 he is the joke himself

plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:09:58 You literally don't wanna see me back then when I destroyed a community because of my extreme toxicity
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:10:21

plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:12:40 but I think nose looks funnit
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:13:19 custom
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:13:30 I don't think the nose looks funnit but at the same time I do
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:13:49 probably because of the cockpit
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:17:43 ok so

plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:21:42 and the red looks a bit to bright
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:22:42 nono i've seen it there is absolutely no suspension
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:22:49 it's just the anti-shake
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:23:08 am I tripping or the build looks blockier than the photo
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:23:38 there is absolutely no suspension and i've seen it myself
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:23:50 ofc you godda pick the worst picture and show it to me

plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:35:42 more compact but more complex version
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:36:00 
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:36:23 the things on top that makes you go <:EYES:525319504721608705>  is just horizontal shock absorbers
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:36:33 just remove them and motor lock the body on top
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:36:35 ez

plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:36:48 🤮
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:37:47 yes, those are 3x3 wheels
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:38:07 nothing much, just some double wishbone with a steering rack
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:38:35 also, this will trigger you
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:38:59 
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:39:04 it's a single spring
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:39:07 yep.

plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:41:41 live axle ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:41:47 or just a bar
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:42:19 Ren's suspension video made me so <:Trigje139:559518788660232196> that I made a drift + rock crawler hybrid
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:42:32 that's wayyy more compact that his " drift suspension "
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:42:44 anyone who likes suspension, you will be triggered
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:44:17 LOOK AT THIS
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:44:27 LOOK AT THIS THING HE CALLS " DRIFT SUSPENSION "
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:44:47 IT'S LITERALLY MY SUSPENSION TUTORIAL BUT NO SPRINGS AND USELESS WHEEL SYNDROME
plane-crazy 2020-10-04 10:45:12

plane-crazy 2020-10-06 13:47:47 bjew
creations-chat 2020-10-06 13:50:03 the colors looks a bit stock, you should make it darker and monochromatize it ( putting random light gradients everywhere, makes it look good for some reason )

plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:02:25 team battle would be super fun
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:02:37 and it's so simple to script
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:02:45 why not add it altogether
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:02:57 old coding, it's hard coded
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:03:16 there are 2 types of coding : hard coding and soft coding
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:03:39 let me say it in a kindergarden school style
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:03:50 Hard coding = Bad, Soft Coding = Good
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:04:10 in more details
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:04:30 Hard coding = assumes information cannot be changed and thus stays as it is
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:05:05 soft coding = assumes information is flexible thus allowing for less bugs and kinda easier programming but you godda make hella long lines of codes for that
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:05:36 ~~i'll phoking deep fry your ass if you don't stop cringing my teeth~~
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:05:57 cyberpunk 2077, release it

plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:07:56 what's worst phantom forces community, PCC or undertales community ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:08:36 PFC = undes flexing their keyboard and their ridiculous neon lights while reeking of chernobyl radiation
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:09:12 PCC = full of douchebags and pumpous players that can't stop fighting eachother over the simplest of reasons that can easily be established
plane-crazy 2020-10-06 14:09:49 undertales : I can't even explain the amount of toxicity and monkey fights in it

plane-crazy 2020-10-07 12:51:29 next time they bring it back up, i'll strangle them
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 12:52:15 general rules of not being an asshole ( and of maturity ) : not bringing up the bad things from the past
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 12:52:46 bring that thing up again, i'll harvest your pancreas and sell it to the yugoslavian white market for bobux
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 12:54:27 ***nice smooth gradient !***
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 12:57:38 
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 12:57:51 that's how you become pro builder
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 12:58:12 ~~and also make build smooth~~
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 13:06:39 it does
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 13:06:57 ~~yup~~
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 13:08:10 yeah but that gay mod whom likes to be bribed is kinda gomnge so he kinda can't

plane-crazy 2020-10-07 13:18:35 submit it and see if it passes
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 13:21:07 you get confidence and they immediately tell you that you're an egostatistical fuck, just don't listen to them and remember, silence is hella golden if used correctly
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 13:21:50 basically, don't show any emotions ( literally what they use in court so that news reporter can't comment on you )
general 2020-10-07 13:25:00 <@!615356321340063784> yo, fuckin' congrats on becoming a moderator bruv ! 👏

general 2020-10-07 13:25:41 modeler, inventor, contest winner
general 2020-10-07 13:26:15 but it's unobtainable since inventor is unobtainable and modeler is kinda hella rigged
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 13:59:32 The rigging part and the public humiliation part needs citation
plane-crazy 2020-10-07 14:02:55

plane-crazy 2020-10-09 12:47:09 blocky and plain, 2 of the things I don't like
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 12:47:17 it can look better with like, more extra details
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 12:47:40 eg ; extra guns like a huge-ass minigun
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 12:48:44 THIS
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 12:48:54 could do better
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 12:50:30 let me participate in one of ren's contest and stratocast my ego
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 12:50:54 seeing how half of the builds are *not really pleasent to look at*
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 12:59:44 ah fork the contest already ended and they're filming, mega agony.
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:00:12 plus it was WW2 so I don't stand a chance against other competitors
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:00:28 ~~if it was custom, tremble before my might~~
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:17:40 it'd like to express on how bad I think it looks but i'd sound like an asshole
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:18:45 I checked it out and it doesn't look flat
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:18:53 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:21:28 it's flat like an ipad
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:22:25 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:38:00 pr 123k
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:38:25 good luck on making the hydroplane work
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:39:10 HE
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:39:36 YOU UNCULTURED SWINE
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:40:22 hydroplane = wing thing on the bottom lifting the boat, thus gaining lotsa speed
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:40:25 every heard of it ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:40:39 ~~If not then you're truly an uncultured swine~~
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:41:22 can also be used on surf
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:42:26 airbone
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:42:29 AIRBONE
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:42:35 BONE IN THE AIR
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:42:37 AIR IN THE BONE
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:42:41 AIRBONE
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:43:06 AIRBONE

plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:43:31 yes I have with the damn avenger movie and that huge-ass helicarrier
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:45:13 we generally call it a helicarrier
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:45:40 but if there's no propeller then airborne aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:46:49 what do you get from heli and carrier
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:47:23 carrier = is a carrier, huge-ass vehicle to transport planes and other airborne vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 13:47:32 heli = short for helicopter, a VTOL
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 14:06:57 ok, I admit, damping is kinda useless really
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 14:07:09 LIES FROM THE TABLECLOTH !
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 14:07:41 ~~they never were~~
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 14:07:55 racing suspension doesn't exist, kinda
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 14:08:14 they don't care if there's suspension or not in racing tracks coz it's flat really
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 14:09:40 NU

plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:09:46 yeah I remember names unlike others
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:10:41 shadowy
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:11:49 especially if it's a huge-ass mech
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:11:55 imagine how badass that'd be
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:13:30 grabbing shredder bugs with mech hands in vr
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:14:53 at the end of the day, those kids will be laughing at a candle alone in the dark in a cupboard
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:15:28 coz we keep throwing them lil lame " weapons " to the void with them mech hands
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:16:23 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:16:26 good luck
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:17:13 what if I make hydroplane
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:17:53 it'd be fast since there's less drag with the water
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:17:59 maybe even make it fly full on lel
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:21:39 " oh yeah a normal boat "
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:22:29 " hold up what it hovers above the water and goes 3x faster ? "
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:22:41 " IT STARTED FLYING "
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:23:18 " **IT'S A PHOKING GUNSHIP, R U N** "

plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:25:12 it has done so much sheer damage that they stopped shooting at them because of it
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:25:52 then they go like " oh ye it's gube idea coz damage "
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:26:04 but they forgot one thing : **one heat seeking missile and it goes down**
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:26:23 the guns a go go, how'd you even get the reference
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:26:35 first time someone getting one of my reference yo
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:27:08 but no, the project did end up very well and chinooks were less attacked in the war because they couldn't see if it was armed or not
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:27:21 " oh yeah a chinook let's shoot it down lmao "
plane-crazy 2020-10-09 15:27:33 " fork shib it has minigun everyone get down asihuidhf "

plane-crazy 2020-10-10 04:52:07 (93, 109, 196) overall color
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 04:52:14 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>

plane-crazy 2020-10-10 07:56:13 agreed
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 07:56:19 we should remove it, really
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 07:56:26 no one uses it as a chat for creations

plane-crazy 2020-10-10 12:18:05 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 12:18:17 maybe it's because of the angle it's been drawn on

plane-crazy 2020-10-10 12:48:37 it is time to beat the swashplate bacon in YT
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 12:49:24 unpowered motor2, my secret weapon, he'll never guess
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 12:50:18 I thought he was good at swashplate, **until now**
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 12:51:33 he's pretty inactive right now, so there's a window for me to diverge all attention to me
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 12:51:53 but I don't have thumbnails, so I better get a stroke of luck getting many people to watch it
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 12:52:08 I won't say his name because his name is just a total fail
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 12:52:25 it must've taken alot of anti-galaxial power to name yourself like that
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 12:53:07 very good
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 12:53:11 **very good**
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 12:53:23 he uses blocks for full articulation
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 12:53:28 to limit it
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 12:53:54 and the only ones that are actually **very good** at swashplate is YAD, Zasno and sak
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 12:54:10 and for him, he's just a pleb that knows how to make swashplate.

general 2020-10-10 13:37:55 no way
general 2020-10-10 13:38:01 no phoking way
general 2020-10-10 13:38:24 my sister is listening to earfquake instead of the usual blimey eyelash songs or something
general 2020-10-10 13:38:30 finally
general 2020-10-10 13:39:14 no more " im the badd gui n " and those " wish u were gey "
general 2020-10-10 13:41:10 it's a miracle, really
general 2020-10-10 13:48:38 lemme tell you the ebic story of how the gunship came to be
general 2020-10-10 13:49:39 'nam war, troops suffers heavy casualty, they said they needed something heavy and " untouchable " by normal means.
general 2020-10-10 13:50:40 some guy back at the department of defense digged up an old concept of flying in a stable circle while there's a side-gun mounted and constantly shooting, but the DoD said " lmao that ain't never gonna work <:KEKW:670310537300672528>  "
general 2020-10-10 13:51:06 but he didn't listen and modified a skytrain with a bofors on the side then deployed it
general 2020-10-10 13:51:33 the damage was massive so they said " ye good idea now I approve "
general 2020-10-10 13:52:01 so now they modify ac-130 and now it's the titular gunship.
general 2020-10-10 13:52:40 the longer part of the story is it's major flaw but that's not interesting anyways
general 2020-10-10 13:53:45 in very short " bruh it can get shot down by heat seeking missile, oh wait what you have heat-repellent ? oh ok, apply it then "
general 2020-10-11 02:05:08 so roblox was dying when I was sleeping ?
general 2020-10-11 02:05:32 looks like im a survivor then
general 2020-10-11 02:05:34 B))))

plane-crazy 2020-10-11 04:32:19 I don't even remember but I saw him do tons of pointless ban to satisfy his ego or something

plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:50:15 oscillating boogie.
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:50:18 it's on the maus
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:50:27 call it churchill suspension or whatever
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:50:55 it's not bolsterless boogie it's oscillating boogie
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:51:26 it's just one hinge for 2 wheels and it's called oscillating boogie, what do you get from that
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:51:40 yeah right
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:52:00 wouldn't call it oscillating boogie if it didn't exist
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:52:13 sure thing
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:53:20 one hinge for two wheel is oscillating boogie
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:53:43 just putting one or two spring on it isn't gonna change anything at all <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:54:19 watch as he's gonna commit real life fanatism
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:54:21 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:55:11 no, it's flaming someone for getting something wrong from real life.
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:55:32 im not even delusional get a reality check lmao
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:55:44 that's flaming for me
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:56:47 you literally have no right to even call me a snowflake if I literally am against them <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:57:06 I wouldn't get offended by most things people even say
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:57:27 get a reality check ego-filled alzeimer-ridden real life fanatic <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:57:48 one hinge on two wheel, oscillating boogie.
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:58:16 you put one spring and he's just gonna call it a bellcrank because there's a spring.
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:58:21 basically, real life fanatic
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:58:40 wants to get everything as close as possible as blame people for apparently not getting it right
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:58:53 ironic
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:59:00 you blamed me 2 times in a row
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:59:11 lies, just lies.
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 13:59:41 you'll never help me because I don't call putting one spring on one hinge connected to 2 wheel a bellcrank
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:00:08 " epitome of asshole " yeah right that's a compliment
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:01:12 what is that
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:01:21 doesn't look anything like you showed me
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:01:59 christie
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:02:21 
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:02:36 not into tank suspension but that really looks like a christie to me
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:02:50 just because the hinge's different doesn't mean it's a bellcrank imo
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:03:12 actually, just putting a spring on a hinge isn't gonna change anything <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:03:25 one hinge for two wheel, maus suspension
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:03:35 he came at the wrong moment
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:03:50 look away now we're doing palestine vs isreal showdown
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:04:44 if I had a temper it would have already involved full-on cap locks.
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:06:56 don't have the time to go on a wild search for mentions of an oscillating boogie but just imagine this but no horizontal spring and shock absorbers, tadam it's an oscillating boogie.
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:07:08 get it now ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:07:32 one hinge for two wheels no springs no anything, just one hinge for two wheel, maus suspension.
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:07:41 what the
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:08:19 suspension is a feature for a wheel to take shape of the terrain.
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:08:44 shock absorbers are meant to absorb the shock by the spring on the suspension.
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:08:59 bet
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:09:01 just bet
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:09:20 to take shape of the terrain and to give a smooth ride.
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:09:26 no let me demonstrate myself.
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:10:21 ONE HINGE FOR TWO WHEEL
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:10:32 one hinge for two wheel
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:10:49 for two wheels
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:10:50 get it
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:11:12 no need to absorb shock it just exist to give a smooth ride and to take shape of the terrain
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:12:18 
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:12:33 cambridge says smooth ride
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:13:31 this means taking shape of the terrain
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:13:45 " cambridge isn't an expert on suspension "
plane-crazy 2020-10-11 14:14:05 that's an excuse that exist just to exist

plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:59:09 u
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 13:59:59 lifting surface = hydrofoil
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 14:00:15 hydroplane = thing made in such a shape boat is faster by lift
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 14:00:27 so it was hydrofoil
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 14:00:40 
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 14:04:40 well, yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 14:04:49 they have the same durability as one block
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 14:05:01 so if they shoot down a beam, the whole thing disappears
plane-crazy 2020-10-12 14:05:28 also, diamond plate tougher than any other material in the game

plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:23:55 <@!562110003675136006> ropes are the control rod and a part of the upper swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:24:09 they are " omnidirectional " ( moves in all direction )
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:24:49 you can ~~make a religion out of this~~ use it as a control rod and upper swashplate without the need of extra motors.
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:27:42 rope swashplate are the best at stability, but it's movement are inconsistent, but it doesn't affect it's great stability tho ( auto-hover, imagine that ! )
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:28:47 lag kills your swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:29:00 so don't be a max graphic oob when using swashplate.

plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:43:04 I agree
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:44:00 but like, there has never been a community that doesn't have a low amount of toxicity, never.
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:44:36 most of the toxic users have been banned so it isn't really as toxic as it was before
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:45:08 end of 2019 was pretty shit for PCC, that's where I joined, I instantly got bullied.
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:45:28 and there were constant drama and argument, and the elitism was INSANE.
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:45:33 now there's less
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:46:33 one block wide plane ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:46:35 uh
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:47:19 community is still pretty shit but less
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:47:34 you just godda adapt and become as toxic as they are
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:48:00 and if you want help, just ask nicely and seriously, if they don't wanna help you then just ignore them, try again later

plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:55:16 well, the first option is to use poontoons on the sides
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:55:26 but then, the most common one is just using cameras
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:55:31 that's what everyone uses
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 01:55:33 cameras
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 02:12:16 would you guys downvote a build if it has no motor lock ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 02:15:02 would you downvote something if it's not perfectly smooth
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 02:15:18 I wouldn't, if it looks good then it's a green uppie
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 02:15:26 smooth or not
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 02:15:59 yeah

plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:51:40 also why we turnin plane crazy channel into the dump
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:53:13 anyways, addendum : HoF voting is extremely picky, you have to get 10 upvotes in under 24h, you better not have people who got a grudge against you, and if you get really unlucky, they'll just downvote for fun.
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:53:32 to increase chance : build somthing huge and make it look good

plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:54:51 this means they ain't original
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:55:13 original = custom
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:55:29 real life is just ripping something from 3d and tryna slap it into 2d.
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:56:01 you technically are playing in a 2d screen
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:56:05 🧠
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:56:45 coz, you look thru a 2d screen
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:56:47 brain
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:56:56 otherwise, it is 3d in terms of common sense
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:57:18 n
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:57:20 no
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:57:42 you're looking at a 2d screen, and it simulates 3d
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:57:58 so technically, it is 2d
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:58:14 but in terms of common sense, it's 3d if it simulates it in a way

plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:58:49 ILLEGAL COAXIAL
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:59:06 put stock engine to drive only one rotor, make the motor unpowered
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:59:11 ez non-coax
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:59:20 what
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:59:42 im telling him how to do a non coax rotor and im not really insulting him
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 12:59:47 mental deficienty
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:00:06 if coax was intentional, then it's fine
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:00:17 but I see tail rotor so <:Trigje139:559518788660232196>
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:00:31 it's quite easy realy
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:00:37 remove one layer of motor
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:00:43 unpower the motor
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:00:46 oh
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:00:50 just put rockets on the tip
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:00:53 lel
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:01:03 have you unpowered the motor ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:01:13 are the collective correct ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:01:34 coz if they're not then of course physics will make you suffer
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:01:50 well, every blade is at the correct angle, one is not inverted
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:02:04 if one if inverted, ~~suffer~~
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:02:42 2 motor2 ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:02:46 only one is needed
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:02:58 or just put motor1 for adjustable collective
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:03:20 common sense has no meaning
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:03:35 uh
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:03:42 you can always invert the collective you know ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:04:11 yes and ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:04:18 it will make you go down
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:04:28 but to go up, pitch the collective up.
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:04:34 or add more engine power
plane-crazy 2020-10-13 13:04:48 that's the only 2 options

general 2020-10-14 13:06:19 perhaps
general 2020-10-14 13:07:05 iphone 12 pro max same price as the cheese grater, 1099$, all this just for a phone that just has 3 cameras or something.

plane-crazy 2020-10-14 13:10:52 things that would look like they go together
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 13:10:55 lemme get an example

plane-crazy 2020-10-14 13:13:43 phok I can't find it
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 13:13:46 i'll keep looking
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 13:15:30 welp, wherever it is, google is being disfunctional and hooked it off the surface of the web into the 34th page or something
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 13:15:39 but, you could rip out colors from real life
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 13:15:58 and there's also this thing called " monochromatic color scale "
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 13:16:33 it's **not** complicated, it's literally making a camo but spread everywhere in the same color but with very different light shades
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 13:16:38 here is an example
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 13:17:24 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/384025409945337856/689584889439584330/unknown.png?width=861&height=475
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 13:18:03 as you can see, colors are a kind of camo, but not really, they have different light shades but retains the " same " colors
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 13:18:12 sorry if these word give you tumour xp
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 13:20:09 yessum
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 13:20:58 Seems to be the description of what I just explained
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 13:38:03 it is very simple and very efficient
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 13:38:12 it's used on almost every plane build nowadays
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 13:39:08 
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 13:39:37 hidden in the blue blob, a wing panel

plane-crazy 2020-10-14 14:04:24 that body already looking unpleasent
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 14:04:45 but finish it and then we'll see
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 14:06:16 
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 14:06:35 maybe you could change the build and make it something similiar
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 14:06:41 'tis a 24h race car
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 14:06:54 or maybe make a rally car
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 14:07:48 smooth version of the veneno
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 14:08:29 better suspension ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 14:08:46 **say more**
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 14:09:06 
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 14:09:32 triple wishbone with realistic steering and hover shock absorber
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 14:09:39 yes those are 3x3 wheels
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 14:10:31 they say it's useless yet again !
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 14:10:33 <:RickoMode:602011035003519006>
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 14:11:03 get one and see how much better it is than a conventional wishbone
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 14:11:16 like, 6^8049938475^834 better
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 14:11:45 what the
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 14:11:54 dependent axle
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 13:20:38 <:RickoMode:602011035003519006>
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 13:53:31 oh, it's easy really
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 13:53:41 the word you're looking for was " rotor " not blade lel
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 13:54:13 it's really easy, take a conventional coaxial, remove the top layer, unpower the bottom motor, and drive the rotor with stock engines
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 13:54:23 tadam non-coaxial !
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 13:59:05 rotor should look like this and be driven by rockets or any stock engines
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:00:13 DISADVANTAGE : messes up gyroscopic precession, you can make a small fix by adding a diamond plate wing at the tip of the blade, or a huge one with replacing the engine driving the rotor with a hover engine
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:00:19 hover engine 2 gube lel
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:00:59 well, use motors, it's better for adjustable collective !
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:01:46 **no**
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:01:54 **locked motor1**
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:01:59 **adjustable**
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:02:04 **not set**
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:04:27 no
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:04:28 oob
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:04:39 it's obtained in the winter event
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:04:44 and winter is coming
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:05:01 im gonna get that and overflex that overflexer
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:05:10 no wait  I already overflexed him <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:05:50 good luck surviving PCC tho, it can be pretty shit if you come in at the wrong time
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:06:23 and there isn't really many people to actually help you, all they'll say is " hEhE uSe mOtOrLoK kEkWe xDDDD "
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:07:40 you're lucky most of the toxic users here has been clapped by the mods, if you've joined in the end of 2019, you'll get harrassed and that's what they did to me
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:08:11 thankfully those **lactating crap sissies** got clapped by mods
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:08:29 oh god that's the most alabama sentence i've ever spoken
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:09:08 extra details anyone ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:09:23 
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:09:43 don't even know what to add other than making it submersible
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:11:28 rotor kinda high tho
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:11:31 make it shorter
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:11:54 ya want me to help make a helicopter ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:12:07 but I can't help right now because 9 pm moment
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:12:39 you want help with a helicopter, just ping me or YAD ( he's the god, be wise when you summon him ! )
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:14:09 YAD can't really help you in-game because he's prolly engineering a helicopter or something, he can only help you in message, in-game help is limited
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:15:47 I like it, but I think it needs some improvement on the design lel
plane-crazy 2020-10-15 14:15:58 how about you make a custom one instead ?

general 2020-10-18 05:14:42 outtake is the correct term for intake
general 2020-10-18 05:14:47 it's not inside it's outside
general 2020-10-18 05:14:52 outtake
general 2020-10-18 05:16:44 it's no use arguing with intakes anyways

general 2020-10-18 12:44:40 that's excellent
general 2020-10-18 12:45:47 the most effective way of identifying a unde according to me is : if they think roblox moderation actually works, **instant unde no doubt**

general 2020-10-18 12:47:08 most of unde accusation here do be like : i don't like what you do so you = unde
general 2020-10-18 12:48:01 someone saying an opinion and you don't like it ? **unde**
general 2020-10-18 12:53:31 the only reason im getting expert is when I actually make a 4k block build, otherwise I don't see why you have to get a specific block count just for a rank, I only use the necessary blocks at my disposal
general 2020-10-18 12:54:08 otherwise, i might just get it if vip 1 turns into public server
general 2020-10-18 12:54:35 there's 2 guys in expert server
general 2020-10-18 12:55:59 and the term " expert " is doesn't make sense imo, eg : being a shipwright expert would mean you actually know a shit ton about ships and their physics and some other fancy crap

general 2020-10-18 13:04:04 what about another term other than expert ?
general 2020-10-18 13:04:16 expert means you know alot of shit on a specific topic
general 2020-10-18 13:05:20 but then an expert here is just a guy who made something with a large block count ( and some specific requirement ) and it doesn't necessarily means he knows alot of shit about vtol or ships

plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:48:52 " I wish I could be as good as the old masters "
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:55:27 ah
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:55:33 there is 3 options
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:55:44 make your truck FWD or RWD
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:55:56 add hover thruster and ropes to suspension, damping max
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:56:08 and push down with ballast
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:56:15 3 options, there may be others
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:56:36 what the
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:56:44 stock engine push maybe ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:56:47 fabric wheel ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:56:57 suspension can affect the way the car moves
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:57:15 add more damnping, a rope and a hover thruster
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:57:27 and extra live axle ( a bar ) maybe
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:57:41 live axle is just another word for a beam
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:57:57 hover thrusters are essensially shock absorbers
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:58:06 they're so good in offroad
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:58:09 hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:58:12 decrease speed maybe ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:58:35 off-road vehicle genererally aren't make to be fast, they're to go offroad
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:58:48 speed you can commit by boosting
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:59:16 the most common reasons for the vehicle to flip is that the wheels are too close to each others
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:59:25 or maybe there's too much weight at the back
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 13:59:30 too much torque
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:00:10 avrotos shaman torque, that's very torquey irl, but not here
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:00:13 hm
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:00:34 I dunno, ~~remake your entire vehicle with wheels spaced more~~
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:00:43 normal suspension kinda bad
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:00:56 go for the B O N E
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:01:21 there is a compact way to make a B O N E
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:01:52 https://youtu.be/AHNCWMiIV5Q
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:02:09 yeah I know I linked a tutorial from a guy who hates me
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:02:13 nani
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:02:14 it's only
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:02:17 5 blocks tho
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:02:23 **motor lock**
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:02:30 ah no wait
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:02:45 your vehicle has realistic steering ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:02:50 wheels turn ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:02:54 AH
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:03:08 that allows for an epic gamer save
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:03:17 **front-facing suspension**
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:03:26 it's so good I swear
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:03:44 it's a bar, facing foward ( the arrow )
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:03:53 just add a motor and a suspension and that's it
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:04:24 
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:04:28 the bar connected to the wheel
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:04:32 that's it
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:04:55 nope !
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:04:58 just add a bar
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:05:24 it's like your usual christie suspension but faced forward, towards you
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:05:38 in the direction that the arrow is pointing on your plot e.g
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:06:13 the best suspension ever is the most articulated one
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:06:44 there is 2 : pendular and the bar-thing-facing-foward
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:07:13 
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:07:29 that's what the bar-thing-facing-foward does
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:07:36 but more articulate
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:08:14 ah yes 8k image of off-road military vehicle of the future
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:08:32 hope the bar-thing-facing-foward gets implemented everywhere
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:08:52 does the door open ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:08:59 im sure you can fit it
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:09:08 then you can
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:09:52 
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:10:00 too lazy to go in-game and make one as an example
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:10:10 but it's a tank suspension, **facing foward.**
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:10:19 motors are visible
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:10:28 so is the suspension and the wheel
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:10:38 can't really help you in-game because 9 pm moment
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:11:04 **azian geng beng gucci geng B)**
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:11:42 i can teach you the basics of suspension but I do not consider myself a " master " of suspension, nor a teacher, really.
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:12:22 it's better I just publish a video on it with explainations rather than making people mindlessly copy block-by-block.
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:13:38 luigi universe right ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:16:11 I wish motor2 doesn't have a seizure when we put a cylinder
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:16:52 the anti-shake " mechanism " takes up all the space for a suspension
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:17:15 the smallest I can make is 2x3
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:19:06 it actually depends on the way you stack them
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:19:40 it's very messed up and most people can't stack 2 on top of each other without ~~having a tantrum and destroying everything~~
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:21:07 might add some trails to make it look better
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:21:40 lock pipes together so smokes are thic enough
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:23:09 wish there was more guide videos other than PVP ones by destroyer
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:23:50 tired of seeing people suffer because they can't make their build look right
general 2020-10-19 14:24:30 frog
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:26:14 imo practice is not very effective, it's exhausting and numbing
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:26:32 you figured out something, you wanna test it, but then you have more problems
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:26:44 " if you focus on the problem, there will be more problems "
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:27:03 " happiness is a choice, suffering is an option "
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:27:09 yep.

plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:36:51 but yeah that's all I know I don't research mi-24 oftenly
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:37:29 mi 24D ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:37:58 i don't look 5 seconds at a wikipedia page about mi-24 oftenly so I dunno
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:39:26 if only I had a better PC, my builds would be hella better
plane-crazy 2020-10-19 14:39:46 I put a swashplate on a heli more than 400 block it kinda just dies

general 2020-10-21 12:55:26 non-stock decorative engines, that's more complicated but you can still achieve the same results

bug-reports 2020-10-21 14:05:42 I really wanna ping rick for this one but I can't because crimnal
bug-reports 2020-10-21 14:06:18 but this is really, REALLY annoying for me and I think it's a common bug, it's so common that I think it's an intentional easter egg made to troll the player
bug-reports 2020-10-21 14:07:33 basically, at totally random moments, your mouse cursor just locks itself and you can't even move it, in other applications other than roblox, it's fine and you can still move it ( hopefully )
bug-reports 2020-10-21 14:08:17 this happens most when I open up discord tab to see the chat or pressing shift a bit too much and it opens up the control key panels
bug-reports 2020-10-21 14:09:04 this is the only rational explaination I can cook up for it, if you open another tab whilst playing the game, the cursor just locks itself
bug-reports 2020-10-21 14:09:48 but I believe more that it's a totally random easter egg / bug that's made just to troll the player
bug-reports 2020-10-21 14:10:04 first time it happened I thought my mouse broke
bug-reports 2020-10-21 14:11:12 it happens at the seemingly most random moment when you're peacefully just playing the game
bug-reports 2020-10-21 14:12:07 just phoking fix it, it's just like the south park biker sound easter egg, scared the shit out of me the first time I heard it, I thought some virus infected my PC and did that or something
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 14:12:32 they still haven't decided
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 14:12:36 t-2 or mirage III

plane-crazy 2020-10-22 12:56:03 and I say : intakes can pretty much become useless af in the far future of ion-engine and electric-powered planes, and also because a jet engine can just move the air like a fan and doesn't really need intakes but not that I deny that intake is completely useless tho
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 12:57:35 well, some university students made a ion-engine powered plane

plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:20:43 quad wishbone is just not reliable and not compact, and doesn't perform better than a triple
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:21:16 triple is just too good
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:21:30 ( except for the " it's useless " whining part " )
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:22:06 while it may be excellent, it's not articulate enough
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:22:35 i want it to be articulate to the max, which means, elevation as it wishes
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:22:52 ah yes the whining part, the best part about making a triple wishbone
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:23:42 anything beyond triple doesn't necessarily perform better
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:23:55 nope
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:23:56 triple
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:24:12 you made it even worst
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:24:35 get your wheel stuck ? triple wishbone just pops it back in
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:25:34 a real triple wishbone with 3 wishbone layer is inefficient
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:26:00 however, third wishbone in the middle, that's it
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:26:24 not 3 superposed on eachother, that's uncompact
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:26:32 2 and 1 in the middle
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:26:37 triple wishbone
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:27:21 exactly

plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:39:43 to be honest, 4k is just too fucking much, most 5x5 wheel vehicle that looks upper-decent ( had no word to describe ok ? ) are 'round 500 - 1k maximum
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:40:25 unless you're making a vehicle like that huge Barricade car someone made, 4k just needs revision
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:40:42 it's too much, just too much
plane-crazy 2020-10-22 15:41:17 exceptions are land carriers, big tanks with tank threads and AT-AT walkers

plane-crazy 2020-10-23 03:33:23 no
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 03:33:52 what about ion engine
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 03:33:56 m
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 03:35:10 also, why the fuck do we even need air in jet engine if it's basically just spraying gas and lighting it up
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 03:35:45 get a rocket engine
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 03:36:10 i've looked through every explaination and I still don't get it
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 03:36:44 im still gonna say phok intakes, it's useless af, you can still cool it outside
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 03:37:21 what do you even mean " on purpose "

plane-crazy 2020-10-23 03:41:47 how in the fuck am I seeking attention
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 03:43:15 so, jet engine, basically, intake gets air in, compressor makes air smol boi, then we heat it up with gas that we lit with a bit of fire or a spark of electricity, air is hot and expands alot, since it's got nowhere to go, off the back it goes and boom propulsion
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 03:43:33 > I was teach that boi the mechanics or positive net gained electrons, valant electrons, combustion mechanics and all the snaz <:PepeLaugh:697130830081818634>

plane-crazy 2020-10-23 04:23:40 articulate enough.
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 04:23:53 and that's also the problem with independent suspension
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 04:24:24 
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 04:24:45 that's why I prefer swing axle and dependent

plane-crazy 2020-10-23 06:37:17 prediction
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 06:37:52 why don't we do wing designs like the T-2 anymore ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 06:38:17 it's a great design yet it isn't implemented anymore
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 06:38:43 there's less drag and the shape's is swept enough to counter turbulence
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 06:40:32 F-104 and T-2 were the fastest at it's time, it's because of the wing and em engines I think
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 06:40:43 fastest not in top speed but in general

plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:06:04 mkay
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:07:59 im concerned about this
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:08:05 
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:08:26 
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:08:52 how am I complaining
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:09:26 ok, so it doesn't say that posting wip in creation is illegal but still'
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:10:30 that explains it
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:11:07 mkay
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:12:37 if people just doesn't give a phok about the " do not post wip in creations " rules ( and also since almost no one has been warned about it, and the rule also has a loophole ) why not just remove it altogether ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:12:46 > idk but i feel that tawin is unde
same
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:13:24 either they remove the rule or actually make it clear that posting wip in creations is illegal
general 2020-10-23 13:15:06 here is another rule im concerned about
general 2020-10-23 13:15:10 
general 2020-10-23 13:15:38 I think that common sense literally has no meaning and that it only means doing what people generally consider respectable
general 2020-10-23 13:16:06 this leaves a heck ton of spaces for loopholes
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:16:47 doubtful
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:17:44 99.9% of unde accusation be like : I don't like what you do so you = unde
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:18:04 agreed
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:18:15 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:18:25 he's either a manchild or a unde
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:18:55 and also him thinking that we care about him being in the test server
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:19:14 he's saying it almost in a douche-like fashion
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:19:31 " oh yea I get access to test server i am god lfmao obey me "
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:20:02 perhaps

general 2020-10-24 12:41:56 fixed your sentence
general 2020-10-24 12:42:19 what can I say except that anime profile picture troll will never change anyways ?
general 2020-10-24 12:43:07 looking through my chat just to make a billboard
general 2020-10-24 12:43:35 he's probably gonna take years to find the most stupid thing
general 2020-10-24 12:43:50 because, they all are collectively
general 2020-10-24 12:44:01 > why not just *ignore* this guy
say that to piggles
general 2020-10-24 12:44:40 if he hadn't been a snowflake and go like " omg omg y u hate bacon ", none of this would've never happened
general 2020-10-24 12:45:27 just ignore me if I blacklist you for being a bacon, and if you don't whine and act civil, I'll just let you in eventually
general 2020-10-24 12:46:31 don't be a snowflake and go like " omg omg bruh bruh y u blacklist me for bacon "
general 2020-10-24 12:46:50 instead of fixing the problem, all he did was fuel my hate for bacons a million times more
general 2020-10-24 12:47:16 because they're all like piggles
general 2020-10-24 12:47:44 snowflake, unreasonable, extremely uncivil
general 2020-10-24 12:47:52 all of them i've ever met
general 2020-10-24 12:48:03 not suprising why i'd blacklist them
general 2020-10-24 12:48:42 whiteboard made in china
general 2020-10-24 12:48:45 easily breakable
general 2020-10-24 12:48:54 get blackboard made out of woode
general 2020-10-24 12:49:22 > Jojo is gay with his computer
cringe
general 2020-10-24 12:49:44 blackboard made of wood more durable than whiteboard made out of plastic
general 2020-10-24 12:49:58 me being me
general 2020-10-24 12:53:02 better
general 2020-10-24 12:53:23 meanwhile, im gonna also make a blackboard
general 2020-10-24 12:53:30 many more
general 2020-10-24 12:53:34 it's a treasure
general 2020-10-24 12:54:11 ok, how about I explain why I can't differentiate destructive and constructive critisism
general 2020-10-24 12:54:25 good
general 2020-10-24 12:55:07 no no
general 2020-10-24 12:55:13 im not 150 iq

plane-crazy 2020-10-27 02:29:13 why the fuck did a low-effort " drone " get 40 uppies
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 02:29:45 ~~probably because the earth is tilted, time to pop it back upright smhsmh~~

plane-crazy 2020-10-27 02:32:05 ~~if I popped the earth back into it's original 90 degree position maybe people will think straight again~~
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 02:32:25 but also, why is the earth tilted tho ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 02:32:48 it actually looks good
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 02:33:27 upvote boost, many users online at the time
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 02:33:53 man if rickje could add those wind effect when you do a high-g turn in AC7
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 02:34:00 that'd be awesome
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 02:34:36 you go 500 speed, and if you make a sharp turn more than 35 degree, wind things / effect appear on your wings
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 02:36:09 the heck
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 02:36:14 you want it that accurate ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 02:36:25 some top gun sounds radio chatter maybe
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 02:36:33 ~~or just put danger zone smh~~
general 2020-10-27 02:41:11 i will delete gumball profile picture gang if there's 3 more of em

general 2020-10-27 03:26:58 i'll steal your plane of existance if it continues
general 2020-10-27 03:27:58 cringe
general 2020-10-27 03:28:01 just fucking cringe
general 2020-10-27 03:28:21 humans evolved to do this eh
general 2020-10-27 03:29:34 he literally just fucking blew his cover
general 2020-10-27 03:29:47 smh imagine

general 2020-10-27 03:31:45 kekw
general 2020-10-27 03:31:50 ask an exploiter
general 2020-10-27 03:32:30 rickje met me
general 2020-10-27 03:32:35 i didn't meet him
general 2020-10-27 03:32:50 how is it flexing

general 2020-10-27 03:33:15 it is vip1
general 2020-10-27 03:33:29 he only goes in public just to check if something broke
general 2020-10-27 03:34:58 no he knows it
general 2020-10-27 03:35:25 once an exploiter has access to the code, it knows everything
general 2020-10-27 03:35:29 just ask him
general 2020-10-27 03:36:36 meet with him
general 2020-10-27 03:36:41 in game
general 2020-10-27 03:36:51 he doesn't use discord much and he has a good reason not to
general 2020-10-27 03:37:01 **looks at chat from 2 days ago**
general 2020-10-27 03:37:02 yep
general 2020-10-27 03:37:21 chinese
general 2020-10-27 03:39:32 <@!615356321340063784> tech support, they gon turn this into cringe 2019 chat mixed with dump and creation chat
bug-reports 2020-10-27 03:42:56 there is no motors, just blocks, wings, control panel and a propeller engine, and look what happens
bug-reports 2020-10-27 03:42:58 https://i.gyazo.com/c375a8fb0d957c714b8888d810f286df.mp4
bug-reports 2020-10-27 03:43:30 it really seems like if I were to build this specific plane, it would glitch out to the void
the-dump 2020-10-27 03:51:29 this is a bible-accurate angel
the-dump 2020-10-27 03:51:46 basically, angels in evangelions were accurate
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:52:21 if someone calls this self-promotion im stealing your plane of existance
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:52:41 he's just showing how to evade shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:52:56 it's not the same as saying " BRO SUB TO THIS CHANNEL IT'S EBIC XD "
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:53:23 expert terrain specialist
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:53:26 impossible
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:53:38 or maybe because it was easier to get it before
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:53:51 4k block land vehicle, who in the fuck makes them
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:54:03 ( excludes at-at and all that shit )
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:54:12 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:54:19 could you show it ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:55:40 i believe most people with expert terrain specialist just artificially increase their block or just made a 4-legged mech and called it a land vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:56:00 so is the same for people with vtol
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:56:25 yeah but these guys are all ancient users who havent spoken for
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:56:28 nani
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:56:33 train is a land vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:56:47 boi
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:57:20 ah ok
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:57:27 it do be blocky tho
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:57:35 adding wedges on the sides will help
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:57:47 in the corners actually
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:58:06 most vehicle specialist here are ancient users who haven't spoken for a year or so
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:58:13 it was easier to get expert back then
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:58:30 but now, for some reason, they over-nerfed it
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:58:39 4k block land vehicle, who the fuck even makes them
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:59:15 nope, it was real easy to get
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:59:47 2k block VTOL, that's a good number for master
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:59:55 but then, they just increased it to 4k
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 03:59:58 wow
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:00:24 yeah, the rank system is messed up
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:00:39 it's all just about block count and making your build look atleast half-decent
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:00:47 most builds in HoF are fucking huge
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:01:02 huge + looks decent = hof
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:01:09 > like the A-10 dude cant get a master rank because his plane isnt 2k blocks
yeah
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:01:14 he deserves it, it looks gube
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:01:39 2k block plane, that's just some airliner fanatic shit
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:01:51 4k block plane that's even worst
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:01:57 hold up
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:02:16 **if I make a helicarrier that can phase into vtol to plane mode, is it a plane and a vtol at the same time ?**
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:02:23 <:PogU:670373666164572172>
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:02:42 4k block helicarrier vtol into plane mode, get 2 ranks free
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:02:54 no helium, kinda easy if you have enough space
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:03:22 but I believe most plane/vtol build in HoF is purely spammed with helium
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:03:54 f
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:04:06 so, do they give proof then
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:04:58 that's great then
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:05:22 i just thought staff just look 5 secs at a request and accept it
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:05:25 kekw
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:07:19 im still kinda skeptic tho but okay, now I know it's fair game
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:09:05 f-14d is gonna be such a pain to make
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:09:28 im getting expert with that shit, it's probably gonna be huge and have a fold, because i want to
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:09:44 GOD
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:09:47 that much ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:09:58 yet another reason why I don't wanna be mod
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:10:17 i've once been one and I realized, **it sucks ass**
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:10:58 now I partly understand why most mods are assholes in most discord servers, but still, they don't have a reason to ban someone randomly just to fill up their ego
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:11:44 i probably won't be mod, unless I get really charismatic with people ( which will never happen, probably ) and I apply for mod because people like me and I have more power
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:12:46 the only reason I wanna be mod is just slam " **if you do not do what you are told to do, when you are told to do, you will be banned, do you understand ? your asses belong to me now !** " into their face
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:13:04 their suffering is my pleasure
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:13:53 lel
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:14:16 hyperbit and noctua probably the nicest mods i've ever met
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:15:17 i've been a mod on TNF wiki before, it was good at first, but then, as the wiki grew, I had more responsibility, thus more work to do, eventually the wiki blew up and it was teeming of users
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:15:54 11% of the users were trolls that would change the wiki page
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:16:25 sometime wikimedia engine br0ke and it didn't save the page when they changed it, so we have the rewrite the entire thing again
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:16:36 guess whose job was it ? **me**
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:17:09 every other users were too lazy to rewrite the page, and since wikimedia has no blacklist feature, I had to ban and ban again and again, it was endless
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:17:57 they kept creating alt accounts to change the page, so I just gave mod rank to another user who was nice and quitted it altogether, bam problem solved
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:18:18 > When it flies, it keeps turning and becomes unstable
ok, so VTOL is all about physics
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:18:28 <@!525608445357981706>
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:19:10 so you see, wings affect flight performance right ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:20:02 if the wing is the opposite direction relative to the wind ( which means in english : aircraft goes up vertically but the horizontal wings are blocking the air thus slowing it down )
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:20:56 you see how the osprey gets it's flaps 90 degrees back and just leave a bit of horizontal wing ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:21:15 and also why we also do the same thing but with the entire wing
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:21:23 that allows air to flow properly
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:21:49 and also why the osprey has a vertical tail on the ends of the wings of the back
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:22:14 a VTOL needs to be perfectly balanced, or just tilt a bit at the back
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:22:22 imma make a vtol real quick'
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:25:33 oh no, you don't need to be smart in physics
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:25:54 your brain already has stored info of how things move and what it affects, really
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:28:50 
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:29:30 so basically, wings should be the direction of where the thrust comes from the engine, and the control panels should be **assymetrical** to the center of gravity
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:29:59 assymetrical means, it's technically symmetrical but the body isn't
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:30:05 oh, im in vip 2
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:30:09 c'mon
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:30:51 get a rank
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:31:25 ok, so this is assymetrical, the body isn't symmetrical, but the center of lift and gravity are
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:31:46 one rule in making vtol : **perfect balance is a lie**
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:32:32 i've once made a perfectly balance non-coaxial swashplated helicopter with only the tail for yaw and torque, son of a bitch kept spinning and crashing
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:32:47 controls will become sensitive, heli isn't even stable
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:33:10 it's a common glitch, so just make it a bit unsymmetrical
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:33:17 that way it MUCH better
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:33:57 nani
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:34:04 just put numbers
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:34:05 ez
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:34:30 wat you wanna make a flying tank ?
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:34:34 m
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:35:35 numbers become tagged in text boxes sometime, because it has the underage filter on it
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:36:04 input some specific set of number it won't
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:36:11 and there's a lot of them
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 04:36:19 but the filter is broken so rip

plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:29:34 f-14d is actually fucking huge compared to the pilot
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:29:43 
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:30:01 gonna make it b i g then
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:30:30 bigger than that of ren's with some cringe super wedgy cockpit that he tried to hide with transparent glass
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:31:19 
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:31:23 no shit sherlock
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:31:28 wedge
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:31:55 good thing it got unnoticed by most because of the paint and the transparent glass material
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:32:05 and also because he got reps for making decent builds
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:33:35 that's big too
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:33:51 f-14d is just the cat but now it's a leopard
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:35:46 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:36:00 one block wide cockpit
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:36:02 boi
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:36:19 one and a half
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:45:05 add more half-wedges damn it
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:45:11 why stop at 2 only
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 05:45:14 make it complete
general 2020-10-27 06:09:09 yo dyno, you r phoking dumb u don't even do what you're told 2 do

general 2020-10-27 07:45:57 im not really savvy in the real life stuff, okay ? want to make fun of it ? go ahead but just don't fucking get real life fanatic-ie or turn it into cyberbullying, coz that's fucking unpog and it won't get you anything
general 2020-10-27 07:46:30 to me, a missile is just some explosive you put on an aircraft
general 2020-10-27 07:47:15 > how is saying an icbm is a nuke on a missile is being real life fanatic?
nothing wrong with that but argumentally bullying someone for that is real life fanatic guarenteed
general 2020-10-27 07:47:58 search up my chat then

general 2020-10-27 07:49:37 if you wanna discuss the real life stuff, don't do it with me
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 07:51:29 elegeal koxail
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 07:51:35 🚓
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 07:52:23 didn't insult you or try to argumentally bully you tho
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 07:52:32 just said elegeal koxail
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 07:53:03 ok, so you know the drill, unpower the bottom motor, remove one layer of rotor, then drive the rotor with stock engine
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 07:53:10 ez non-coaxial
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 07:53:51 what is fake rotor
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 07:54:12 fake rotor is the tail rotor on your heli but bigger
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 07:54:20 real rotor just produces lift
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 07:55:32 um
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 07:57:01 rotor doesn't really nessecarily need to pitch and roll in the game tho
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 07:57:41 in fact, real life fanatic shouldn't exist because this game's unrealistic, you don't have to put an intake to make a jet engine function, but they exist anyways
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 07:58:03 **also the reason why i said intakes useless because you don't need to add them IN the game**
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 07:58:16 not real life
plane-crazy 2020-10-27 08:03:29 ah yes, wedge tank's son

plane-crazy 2020-10-28 03:47:17 " hell yeah time to add pog nose to our experimental cargo plane "
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:00:59 aircraft is too short, engines are kinda bad, the hell is that propeller doing on the wing, and the wing is wayyy too long
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:01:15 only one black magic spell can save you from these things
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:01:22 **MOTOR LOCK**
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:01:46 if you don't know how to, it's fine I can help you, but there are many tutorials on YT
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:02:34 y'know what these tutorials don't really explain thoroughly, how about I just make an *actual* tutorial on how to motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:02:50 nani
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:02:55 me too but im fine
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:03:01 pentium laptop ecks dee
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:04:52 even then if I make a tutorial it's not gonna get past 100 views or so, because, no damn thumbnail
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:05:24 1:1 doesn't really exist
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:08:59 isn't that the mirage III
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:09:03 holup a sec
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:09:36 
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:09:51 
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:09:58 yeah it is the mirage III
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:10:05 just chile version i guess
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:15:39 john I swear
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:15:53 i meant it **in game**

plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:16:39 well, I mean, if you make custom, then 1:1 is just according to what you're building, there isn't really a scale
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:17:05 but if you're tryna make a real life build accurate to the size of your avatar, things can get wack
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:17:21 just hard
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:17:40 yesb
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:17:42 just hard
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:18:58 i also meant that for the game
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:19:14 since you don't even need to make an intake to make a jet engine function
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:19:35 > i know
doubtful
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 04:20:28 > Then no In takes are for idiots who make un realistic builds

general 2020-10-29 03:34:38 i like this more
general 2020-10-29 03:34:44 > All of the migs are poob change my mind 😎
kinda agree with you
general 2020-10-29 03:35:06 well not until the fishbed
general 2020-10-29 03:35:27 mig-21 it's a bit different otherwise it's still just fifa reskins of one another
general 2020-10-29 03:35:54 yooo
general 2020-10-29 03:35:55 yes
general 2020-10-29 03:37:39 so first it was fifa reskins of the same plane over and over again until the mig 23 that actually is different, then it's reskins again
general 2020-10-29 03:38:18 mig 21
general 2020-10-29 03:39:14 then the next aircraft mig 23 that looks DRASTICALLY different from the copy-pasted intake design that gets chonker and chonker
general 2020-10-29 03:40:08 then mig 25 that also looks different, then it's just copypaste fifa reskins
general 2020-10-29 03:40:35 the only thing russia is good at ( apart from copypasting the same plane over and over again ) is making helicopters
general 2020-10-29 03:40:44 it's the best in the world
general 2020-10-29 03:41:02 I mean, in military vehicles lol
general 2020-10-29 03:41:59 mig 29 doesn't really look different apart from being slimmer and more streamlined
general 2020-10-29 03:42:28 SU jets do actually look a bit different from one another
general 2020-10-29 03:43:03 since proto made a script for symmetrical copy pasting, why not implement the feature into the game altogether ?
general 2020-10-29 03:43:08 that'd be great
general 2020-10-29 03:43:30 if a single exploiter can do it, so can a solo dev with full access to the code
general 2020-10-29 03:44:54 he's never softcoding the game, he's always spending time trying to find the code error that fucked up the game after adding a single line of code
general 2020-10-29 03:45:01 never hard code your game kid
general 2020-10-29 03:46:04 8k line of source code for motor
general 2020-10-29 03:46:06 <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
general 2020-10-29 03:46:52 can't he just fucking recode the game into softcode instead of finding that one error that fucked up everything after adding some line of codes
general 2020-10-29 03:48:50 he does that all the time I think
general 2020-10-29 03:49:18 if he just softcoded the entire game, it will probably take the time around that he's tryna search for the error that fucked up everything
general 2020-10-29 03:49:37 is he ?
general 2020-10-29 03:49:42 **IS HE ?**
general 2020-10-29 03:50:34 or is he just squinting his eyes tryna find the error that fucked up the entire game after adding one string of code while eating cheetos out of a bowl ?
general 2020-10-29 03:50:47 and he didn't even announce he's gonna softcode it
general 2020-10-29 03:51:08 either he makes another major block update with more wedges or he just softcode the fucking thing

general 2020-10-29 03:54:37 almost half of the builds in HoF are fucking huge for no peculiar reason
general 2020-10-29 03:55:06 it seems that bigger = better for those in VIP
general 2020-10-29 03:55:43 some of them just looks plain with no extra details

general 2020-11-08 10:10:49 nope
general 2020-11-08 10:12:37 > jojo are intakes still useless?
in PC, technically, there are already intakes in jet engines, so I dunno, otherwise, 300948976456% of the time we just use super rocket engines, and if you wanna make an intake for your plane, it's not gonna do anything so it's useless to add intakes with blocks, it's not gonna improve your performance
general 2020-11-08 10:12:44 in real life, sure.
general 2020-11-08 10:12:53 it's useful for them jet

plane-crazy 2020-11-08 10:33:24 3 reasons, 1. no civil common sense of the way of chatting, can't take a joke 
2. creating a hate video about me when I was just about to be zen and chill ( and it only made me more toxic )
3. douche.
plane-crazy 2020-11-08 10:33:33 > I can feel a wave of people disagreeing with my opinion

general 2020-11-08 10:37:16 it's not his roblox avatar tho, he probably just took that from some toxic roblox live streamer meme image

plane-crazy 2020-11-08 10:42:19 for jetpack, just use blocks to go up or conveyor to travel faster

plane-crazy 2020-11-08 10:45:25 > when you can ignore?
say that to the face of twitter
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 12:50:20 let me take a wild guess, creations chat got removed because people were arguing like apes again
bot-central 2020-11-09 12:51:06 !servers
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 12:53:18 creations-chat part 2 : now this time we changed it to creations-feedback
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 12:56:54 **laughs in my pet lobster**
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 12:57:56 english
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 12:58:49 that f-22 in creations only got downvotes for it's nokia phone screenshot when the actual build itself looks good ( atleast to me )
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 12:59:07 ~~ok, maybe it's a bit lobster 200%~~
help 2020-11-09 13:03:58 collective not enough perhaps ?
help 2020-11-09 13:04:36 and you godda add ballast to the nose, and you need a horizontal wing in the tail rotor
help 2020-11-09 13:05:03 motorlock wing panels together for the rotor blade for more lift
help 2020-11-09 13:05:50 add helium to the rotor's center ( or rotor mast, don't see why they call it the mast it doesn't look like a long stick in a pirate ship to me, it looks more like the center of the rotor )
help 2020-11-09 13:06:38 color the very tip of the rotor blades in diamond plates, it has more weight, rotor blade weight matters in some cases
help 2020-11-09 13:06:58 that's what im sayin' lol
help 2020-11-09 13:07:30 ya, they don't really teach you these
help 2020-11-09 13:08:17 materials actually do shit in the game contrary to popular beliefs ( other than people knowing that fabric has more friction )
help 2020-11-09 13:08:45 fabric and ice are the carbon fiber of the game, they're the lightest material
help 2020-11-09 13:09:40 metal and diamond plates are the material with more weights than any other fabrics ( which have no weight )
help 2020-11-09 13:10:11 but i don't see the point in using metal since diamond plate looks better and metal just shines a bit but ok
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:13:10 ~~he accidentally deleted alexa~~
creations-chat 2020-11-09 13:14:35 most public server peeps doesn't take plane crazy as a game to build epic good-looking vehicle or to do black magic shit really, they really just mess around with all the items, that's why most build in public looks ass
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:14:55 same
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:15:24 if he deleted alexa, he would do the agony
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:19:35 ok, so this is a drone carrying a shit ton of other drones
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:20:29 but I don't think it's a drone because there's radio chatter from that, and apparently, it's the operator talking
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:20:53 maybe there's 3 or 7 guys piloting it
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:21:10 yes it is
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:21:34 i suggest you dim the tone of the white a bit
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:21:46 and add some hover thrusters for headlights
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:23:41 https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/748399365437259837
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:25:57 chonky and wide
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:28:29 nice
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:29:03 i suggest you add ropes to collective to limit their extension, otherwise it does the funny
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:30:20 motor2 should be set at speed 7 max torque, to avoid summoning the motor kraken and obliterate your swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:30:28 but that's just for motor swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:30:58 real swashplate with the disc thing, I don't really know if it applies or not
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:31:21 but I know motor, and if it goes too fast on something with more motors, funny will incur
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:34:26 i'd rather kick undes in pvp to the 4th dimension because they rage right after I make their shitty little " plane " crash
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:35:55 you connect it usually by half-wedges, the lower swashplate doesn't have the motor that induces feathering ( colored in red ), the swashplate does
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:37:47 ok, this is a fully articulated swashplate if you want, this an old pic when sak taught me black magic
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:39:57 this is my smaller, simplified version of it, in red is the half-wedges that connects, in other colors are the motors
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:40:10 > how it work
Beats the air till it flies
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:40:38 or, rotor blade pitch does the funny and moves helicopter by a complex mechanism
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:42:02 > jojo knows a lot about helis ngl
not as much as an actual engineer does
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:42:45 > but you know a lot about how to make them in pc
not as much as the exploiters lel
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:43:07 they know everything, just like RC helicopter makers does
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:45:07 but not as much as a real engineer tho, these guys practically spend hours, back-bended at a tablet and a paper or a blackboard drawing physics shit for new helicopters to roll into production line as soon as possible and to make sure they don't do the funny
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:46:51 there is a good website to learn shit about helicopter physics

plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:53:05 but it was also because he had a huge-ass 7k block mech
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:54:02 combined with the flinging, constraint and physics lag, well basically it's the best way to crash yourself or softlock the game into infinite lag.
plane-crazy 2020-11-09 13:54:32 never gonna use it except for when funny occurs and needs immediate extermination

<@!526713899958140928> that's called dissymmetry of lift from what I see, it's basically wind wanna do funny with the rotor spinning in one way, so now it kinda tilts the helicopter, one way to fix it is by ~~swashplate~~ having more control over your helicopter or by fine-tuning the weight, this effect also applies to the tail rotor, so putting it on the other side might help, otherwise add delta wing in the direction the rotor is spinning
help 2020-11-09 14:15:41 or it might just be u powering a motor
help 2020-11-09 14:16:01 for an ez non coax, you only need one unpowered motor and only rockets to drive the whole thing
help 2020-11-09 14:16:13 coz powered motor = torque

plane-crazy 2020-11-10 11:16:32 I feel like it needs to not be flat like a pancake and not be that wedgy
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 11:16:56 but even with less wedgy nose, you get chonko mode
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 11:18:39 dunno how to avoid chonko mode but atleast it's smooth ( and the top is agony because there's no more half-triangle wedges like 1x2
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 11:18:47 still waiting for more wedges
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 11:20:05 sure
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 11:20:10 but still agony
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 11:20:31 add more half-wedges or just more wedges or else start revolt

plane-crazy 2020-11-10 11:26:45 there's a video i saw of a b-52 coming in close to the ground at high speed, does a half-cobra and drops all it's payload, then goes on a completely vertical 90 degree power climb

plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:08:02 why would you downvote a guy who reposted, he killed your cat or what ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:09:21 well, it does say " do not spam post creations " but did he spam ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:09:48 is it spamming then ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:10:43 it does seem like you're suggesting that it's spam
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:11:02 don't see any reason to downvote someone who posted 2 times but ok
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:11:51 snip the part where it says no repost in the rules
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:12:03 and also the part about downvoting a repost
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:13:21 eh
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:15:21 fair enough but as far as my reasoning goes, there is no reason to downvote a repost, " community rules " isn't the actual rules and you don't have to follow it, but maybe the rule for no repost was deleted during the revamp but *if you forgot it, then it's not important*
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:15:54 or maybe they just forgot it

plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:48:22 👏
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:49:18 *Sí, claro, vete mientras puedas*
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:49:35 prob after december event
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:49:54 prob = probably
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:50:00 otherwise, more likely, **NEVER**
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:51:10 remaking, but he hasn't even announced it and he never will remake it
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:51:46 PLANE CRAZY 2.22 : NOW PHOK OFF IT'S THE REMASTER BUT WITH EVERYTHING OLD HAVING BETTER GRAPHICS
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:52:04 he ain't never gonna re-code the game
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:53:56 anyone actually use friction block
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:54:04 probably the least used block in the game
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:57:12 monk part 2, only 22 uppies
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 13:57:41 **time for monk part 2.22 : land rover defender remaster**
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:00:46 upvote boost better be present when I finish and post it
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:02:50 600 sps on my stock engine-only jet, I say 700 is possible
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:04:46 50 km/h ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:05:45 divide by 1.6 for km/h
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:06:35 fucking imperial system made by a guy who drank god knows how many absinthes in a bar
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:06:49 metric system is way better
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:09:07 looks nice
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:09:44 you make sure there's little small details like some half-wedges or some cylinders when you finish it
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:09:51 otherwise it looks plain
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:10:19 pretty much where you see fit
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:12:09 640 sps, **NOW SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT, DELTA WING**
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:17:57 650 sps
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:20:29 i believe 650 is the limit for stock engine-only
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 14:20:44 otherwise you get hover engine to go 700
general 2020-11-13 12:45:55 this is triangle nose
general 2020-11-13 12:46:02 *conical* triangle nose
general 2020-11-13 12:47:29 f-22 nose is triangle but a bit flat
general 2020-11-13 12:48:24 imagine reincarnating as the X-32, destined to scream forever in eternity with it's outdated pogchamp intake design
general 2020-11-13 12:48:42 on a more optimistic note, you're pogchamping forever
general 2020-11-13 12:48:54 or on both sides, you're singing choir forever
general 2020-11-13 12:51:08 he from the canada
general 2020-11-13 12:51:13 he a nice person
general 2020-11-13 12:51:38 if you commit uncivil with him, and he gets mad and ban u, you deserved it
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:52:50 hmmm yes expert designer, *de qualidad*
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:52:58 but ngl his builds pretty nice
general 2020-11-13 12:55:14 eh
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:55:51 agreed
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:55:59 now that seems a bit like *spamming*
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:56:55 man  I hate to be rude but he said :
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:57:17 and mirage IIIC is a variant of the Mirage III
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:57:22 > also i seriously doubt its the *first*
same
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:57:29 > he's REALLY trying to get those points
hmmm not really
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:57:53 but if he's overexaggerating like a grindhouse douchebag would, then yes
the-dump 2020-11-13 12:59:16 bri ish shark
the-dump 2020-11-13 13:01:50 if anyone takes down reddit forever, i'll probably send that guy a thank-you note with a cake
general 2020-11-13 13:03:22 pogchamp intake
general 2020-11-13 13:04:34 I mean like, it has huge wings and a single engine which means more effective payload and thrust to weight ratio
general 2020-11-13 13:04:44 so why the pogchamp intakes then
general 2020-11-13 13:05:05 what
general 2020-11-13 13:05:35 they even tried to make an upgraded version of it with an even wider intake
general 2020-11-13 13:06:48 good thing it was suceeded by the A6 intruder
general 2020-11-13 13:07:19 wat
general 2020-11-13 13:08:27 > cf-105 hottest plane ever
says the guy who says that f-104 is ugly but it's fifa reskin is better
general 2020-11-13 13:08:52 pogchamp intakes, go !
general 2020-11-13 13:09:28 > dont deny
i deny !
general 2020-11-13 13:09:35 it's just fifa reskin
general 2020-11-13 13:10:37 okay, so they make the f-22 which is the ultimate fighter, but then they make the f-35
general 2020-11-13 13:11:27 so basically 135 million better than 1 billion
general 2020-11-13 13:11:31 ya
general 2020-11-13 13:11:51 and a higher number is supposed to mean that a plane is superior to it's predecessor

general 2020-11-13 14:42:10 the man who combined cringe and cringe and created the ultimate cringe song
general 2020-11-13 14:42:32 they decided to make an event on the worst musical artist in the world
general 2020-11-13 14:42:39 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-11-13 14:43:02 > And are you any better?

general 2020-11-13 14:43:23 snowflake
general 2020-11-13 14:43:34 but his music is cringe and almost no one can deny it

general 2020-11-13 14:45:10 obc ghost
general 2020-11-13 14:45:29 get mara we got a rabbit in the clouds
general 2020-11-13 14:46:11 i haven't checked the front page in months and this is what I see
general 2020-11-13 14:46:22 
general 2020-11-13 14:46:36 all the games on the front are P2E
general 2020-11-13 14:46:40 pay to enjoy
general 2020-11-13 14:47:05 ignore arsenal
general 2020-11-13 14:47:07 lel
general 2020-11-13 14:48:27 PF is good game if you don't mind the chernobyl community and the lag
general 2020-11-13 14:49:09 <:Duck:606204496695001091>
general 2020-11-13 14:49:13 jk
general 2020-11-13 14:50:32 I think pf community discord doesn't even respect discord's TOS, if that's the case than it should've been taken down since it was created
general 2020-11-13 14:51:04 but discord mods being discord mod, they don't deal with it unless we make them push the pencil
general 2020-11-13 14:51:45 > the toxicity?
and the undes flexing their purple lights ( what the fuck even a mentally deficient person wouldn't play in a purple light )
general 2020-11-13 14:51:52 ranting eh
general 2020-11-13 14:52:09 toxicity now that's the problem
general 2020-11-13 14:52:25 yep
general 2020-11-13 14:52:44 just like PC in the end of 2019
general 2020-11-13 14:52:58 good thing mods actually did their job and banned most of the toxic users
general 2020-11-13 14:54:45 whoever takes down PF's discord and it's YTers affiliates, I'd probably write that guy a thank you note
general 2020-11-13 14:58:45 can't join an arsenal server without seeing a unde ruining the game with some aimbot exploit some low life made while he got nothing to do
general 2020-11-13 14:59:32 time to get those 2000' csgo skills back up and rekt some people
general 2020-11-13 15:01:41 well fuck it seems that modern problem require modern solution
general 2020-11-13 15:02:02 least I headshotted that dumbass hacker and he just quitted
general 2020-11-13 15:03:07 heck
general 2020-11-13 15:03:26 it must be expensive then
general 2020-11-13 15:04:42 more like bots tryna whitelist some words but their cpu is burnt
general 2020-11-13 15:05:16 robloc, 'splain why you spent 7 years writing a whitelist tag system when the blacklist system was already good
general 2020-11-13 15:05:46 **before I grab you by the collar and hold you up a tall bridge with my weak arm**
general 2020-11-13 15:06:34 when it comes to updates, keep your expectation extremely low for roblox
general 2020-11-13 15:08:06 coz sometimes they can do the unpoggest shit possible ( like removal of tix ) which requires a huge anti-galaxial amount of will power to pull off such a monumental disappointment like that
general 2020-11-13 15:08:35 bet
general 2020-11-13 15:08:52 <:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>
general 2020-11-13 15:09:29 they did it
general 2020-11-13 15:14:44 motor 3
general 2020-11-13 15:15:22 imagine real-life accurate plane crazy
general 2020-11-13 15:15:27 *jesus*

general 2020-11-13 15:16:25 plane crazy but now the shape affects the flight performance
general 2020-11-13 15:16:47 noob planes blocky planes are going to be so fucking slow because of the drag
general 2020-11-13 15:16:49 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-11-13 15:17:26 the most primitive weapon is the most efficient, **a motor but with a stick covered with cutters**
general 2020-11-13 15:17:41 if they reach you, they get shredded
general 2020-11-13 15:17:44 ironic
general 2020-11-13 15:18:00 **conveyor engine and hover engine doesn't exist anymore**
general 2020-11-13 15:18:13 **maximum speed with stock engine is only about 700**
general 2020-11-13 15:18:36 the biggest problem if PC followed real life would be the shape of your aircraft and fuel
general 2020-11-13 15:19:01 holy shit, if that was true then blocks will be replaced by fuel tanks
general 2020-11-13 15:19:11 but then they're heavy
general 2020-11-13 15:19:16 phonk
general 2020-11-13 15:19:30 good thing that PC ain't realistic
general 2020-11-13 15:20:00 > pc but realistic
oh shite
general 2020-11-13 15:20:48 vampire car
general 2020-11-13 15:22:42 make a bri ish manowar, sail it on the new map and get the T
general 2020-11-13 15:23:00 good idea we make a boat race on who gets the t first
general 2020-11-13 15:24:01 yes it is
general 2020-11-13 15:24:52 combat mecc
general 2020-11-13 15:25:12 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-11-13 15:26:57 i hadn't played vehicle sim since months ago and now the suspension actually works
general 2020-11-13 15:27:17 *if you can fake it, you can make it*
general 2020-11-13 15:27:54 fuck shredder bugs time to smoke em right out like an insect
general 2020-11-13 15:29:30 that'd be hella hard to code
general 2020-11-13 15:29:40 otherwise make your own text crosshair
general 2020-11-13 15:29:46 but not like it's not worth it
general 2020-11-13 15:29:58 and the " he's softcoding the entire game "
general 2020-11-13 15:30:31 he better not be a mythos, I wanna see PC without bugs and 4 wheels orbiting around a bunch of suspension and motors again
general 2020-11-13 15:30:48 you're lucky
general 2020-11-13 15:31:03 these aren't normal, they're rare on public server
general 2020-11-13 15:31:11 OH SHIT YOU ASKED THE FORBIDDEN QUESTION
general 2020-11-13 15:31:31 **every builder in a 700 mile radius finna come**
general 2020-11-13 15:31:51 > those are cool
c'mon man, that doesn't look pleasing
general 2020-11-13 15:32:07 in fact that's hella trash compared to builds here

general 2020-11-13 15:41:50 besides i've never visited reddit anyways, but by images spread thru social media, i knew these cheeky bastards needed a massive reality check

plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:44:32 he a tutorial user
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:45:41 tutorials don't really teach you anything, sure they might teach you a bit about some mechanics in the game but it's really just copying from some 2d character building 2d vehicles, it's just mindlessly copying something just to get hated by other people because you r oober clan
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:46:00 tries to defy the laws of the universe
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:46:36 > they teach a lot
followed tutorials before, barely taught me a thing <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:47:20 > <@!437152336176087052> youre bad at following rules
what
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:47:26 jam
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:47:47 they taught me how 2 tank steer
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:47:57 they teach you the mechanics
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:48:33 but you just mindlessly copy, that's basically what you do in almost every tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:49:02 actual tutorials actually bother to teach you a thing, they don't just let you copy like a printer
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:49:35 so if you make a tutorial, I urge you to actually tell them how shit works in PC, otherwise the viewer will never get better
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:50:00 with easy, understandable explainations of course
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:51:34 I see those poor oobs in public servers, making a helicopter with a tutorial rotor, their helicopters tries to fly in vain, it was too tail heavy, it kept tipping, and they were raging in the chat because their helicopters didn't work
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:51:59 i've never seen a tutorial explaining that helicopters need to be balanced
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:52:08 or have wings for stability
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:52:21 or explain what a coaxial is
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:53:07 I wanted to help them, but being the *chanclas* they are, they suddenly go silent
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:53:57 so again, I fucking urge you, if you wanna make a tutorial, **'splain and introduce concepts in an easy-to-understand way**
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:54:17 not just make the viewers mindlessly copy from a video without any explaination whatsoever
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:55:07 > the entire concept of making tutorials are getting views they dont really think of actaully explaining what the fuck is happening
Can't agree more
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:55:44 > i use tutorial for inspiration and how it works
someone's who's not a *chanclas*, finally !
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:56:10 aw *pats head*
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:56:14 don't worry u too
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:57:30 **no more shredder bugs mukbang, time to smoke em right out like an insect in his hole**
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:58:00 desperate situation calls for desperate measures !
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:58:13 but yeah you got him a taste of his own medicine
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:59:14 " im gonna give you a taste of your own medicine ! "

more dramatic : " im gonna make you choke on yer own aspirins, pills, remedies and laxatives ! "
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 15:59:38 oh, easy, you get em right in the motor
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:00:15 it seems weird but to me, the more primitive a pvp weapon is, the OPier it gets
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:00:34 just ramming with cutters on, can't do that much damage right ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:00:39 **couldn't be more wrong**
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:00:51 ***that's alot of damage***
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:01:31 why make a pvp fighter that looks good but is kind of unstable and has complicated WASD controls ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:01:56 make a simple, efficient, mouse-controlled plane with some wasd override controls and there you go
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:02:02 doesn't need to be pretty
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:03:01 mouse and manual override controls r the best
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:03:44 easy to aim and you don't need to be a mathematician to estimate where your plane should be pointing according to the camera and FOV of a 3d game to get a hit
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:04:04 mouse more accurate, manual override allows for hard turns
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:04:13 think of it like AC7 high G turn
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:04:21 > <@!437152336176087052> me when motor 2 turret on the ground or water
oh shite
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:05:48 afterburner : spray more fuel when air gonna exit so more thrust coz air expands more
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:05:58 simplest explanation I can cook up
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:06:35 <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:06:56 speed is past about 1100 and you get a nice cloud
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:07:11 I think that in that case, engines should have alot more power then
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:07:26 actually, **make engines have more power**
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:07:48 I want the " super " in super rocket engine to actually do what it's named !
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:08:11 it's " super " so it means it's supposed to be very powerful
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:08:29 heck no
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:08:37 waves are gonna tip my poontoon helicopter
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:08:51 and that FAA handbook will actually be useful for once lmao
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:09:03 " amphibious aircraft handbook "
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:09:20 if there is waves and I land my poontoon heli, well <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:09:37 i godda get going
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 16:09:43 gonna make t for y'all tommorow
general 2020-11-14 07:32:43 that's still fine unless there's lag and people r getting toxic
general 2020-11-14 07:36:53 fonk
general 2020-11-14 13:46:13 > but i suspect japan would be building evas very soon
same, maybe in the next 40 years, but not huge evas with god-like powers, just small, efficient mech with machine guns
general 2020-11-14 13:46:38 for evas, that's probably gonna be as early as 2070
general 2020-11-14 13:47:07 building a huge-ass mech with god-like abilities, well yeah that's gonna be bound to break a shit ton of rules
general 2020-11-14 13:48:06 but already, america bombed 2 cities with the ultimate weapon of destruction, killing many innocent people
general 2020-11-14 13:49:04 so japan making a huge-ass mech that can destroy everything, I don't think that'd really gonna break the rules since america did a similiar thing back in ww2
general 2020-11-14 13:49:24 a nuke is also made to destroy everything, so why can't we make a mechanical god that can also destroy everything ?
general 2020-11-14 13:49:33 > i don't recall america having a giant mech in ww2
they had a nuke
general 2020-11-14 13:49:46 wow yes 7 trillion neurons used
general 2020-11-14 13:49:50 <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
general 2020-11-14 13:50:56 a nuke, the army can build one anytime, so it can technically be used more than once I guess ?
general 2020-11-14 13:51:08 🤮
general 2020-11-14 13:51:27 the cringiest artist in the world, he probably bribed for his grammy
general 2020-11-14 13:51:34 > Honestly I'm happy he isn't listening to K-pop or liking Fortnite
that, I agree
general 2020-11-14 13:51:45 Anyone can make better music than him
general 2020-11-14 13:53:27 > and I saw a lot of disappointed undes
normally, undes like bad, cringy things, if they are disappointed at it, then it must be extremely terrible
general 2020-11-14 13:54:19 gamer thailand probably an immigrant scum, im a siam guy and I can pretty much say, after living here for 15 years, he's no thai
general 2020-11-14 13:54:28 > they were like “what a waste of my time”
<:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
general 2020-11-14 13:54:34 it's *that* bad then
general 2020-11-14 13:55:17 anyone can make better music than kpop
general 2020-11-14 13:57:34 to me, both nas x and kpop is absolutely unbearable
general 2020-11-14 13:57:51 in fact, most modern popular music are unbearable to me
general 2020-11-14 13:58:04 yes
general 2020-11-14 13:58:05 i agree
general 2020-11-14 13:58:15 yep

general 2020-11-14 14:02:49 it has to be this way platinium mix and goroth
general 2020-11-14 14:02:53 my favorite game ost
general 2020-11-14 14:05:45 the track is a bit e h for me
general 2020-11-14 14:06:28 like, it doesn't feel chunky and honestly it just sounds like the grindhouse typical rock of the 80' that aged extremely badly
plane-crazy 2020-11-14 14:10:39 > on a scale of 0/10 how much do you hate exilir?
rayo's number / 10
general 2020-11-14 14:14:06 I think the ranking system is kinda messed up, imo I think it's just reaching a certain block count and make your build look atleast half-decent and then you get a rank
general 2020-11-14 14:14:17 but I can't think of a better system than that so <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
general 2020-11-14 14:16:20 > why does flamingo scream like an idiot
or rather, he is an idiot
general 2020-11-14 14:19:16 prob one of those cringe useless doge profile picture troll or john detoriorating into insanity
general 2020-11-14 14:19:52 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-11-14 14:20:16 john, fucking get out of here you degenerate low life scum
general 2020-11-14 14:20:51 or some doge profile picture troll, can also apply
general 2020-11-14 14:22:21 makin' sure he's dead smh

plane-crazy 2020-11-14 14:27:28 most of the build in the videos were just bad, only the mi-28 actually stood out among all the indecent builds in there
general 2020-11-14 14:35:19 never seen him work so e h

general 2020-11-14 14:57:27 unit classified, new rolve game
general 2020-11-14 14:57:35 better not be laggy af like every game they do
general 2020-11-14 14:57:42 and better not be p2e

general 2020-11-14 15:04:49 - does a point blank hit
general 2020-11-14 15:05:11 every rolve game : no I don't think I will count that as even a hit
bot-central 2020-11-16 13:07:45 !servers
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:08:47 me on a pentium laptop building 650 sps plane without any helium at all : <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:09:32 but then ballast will create gyroscopic precession and it kinda sucks
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:09:36 also adds weight
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:12:37 never happened to me
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:13:03 I just balance my plane with wings on motorlock to get the center of lift close to the center of gravity
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:14:18 ballast creates gyroscopic precession and it just sucks so I don't use ballast, I just add more block or balance with wings
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:14:45 me with a pentium laptop : <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:15:00 pretty much.
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:15:25 once make a 2k block ship, got that silky smooth 9 fps
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:15:41 imagine what would a 6k block ship would be like on my laptop
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:15:43 <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:16:02 <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:16:08 im not alone then
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:16:47 I almost never put any landing gear at all on my planes
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:17:14 I don't care about taking off, it's just sliding and getting off into the air for me
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:17:23 no need for landing gears ( unless it's fancy )
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:17:56 nope, not gonna add a front one, that'll only make it worst <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:19:35 never seen a carrier big enough to fit an average-sized 3 block wide PVP jets
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:19:45 or it's probably just me who's not seen enough
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:19:46 <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:20:12 22, that's good
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:20:19 what about how long then ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:20:48 I guess now that can fit 3 pvp jets then
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:21:16 plane crazy has a massive problem with perfectly balanced build
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:22:00 so I always make the center of mass a bit distanced from the center of lift
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:23:00 I wanna make a perfectly balanced bui-

The game's trash engine : **no, phok you.**
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:23:50 it looks like there is also problem with perfectly balanced airplanes in real life
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:24:18 so that's why the f-16 was made intentionally unstable so it could maneuver faster and have more lift
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:30:54 can't make a huge ship without spending weeks on it and at the end, only getting 20 upvotes because inactive people
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:30:58 **but that was just once**
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:31:27 ***big ship part 2 : REVENGE***
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:31:45 godda time my post when upvote boost
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:32:13 people are online then I get 40 ( atleast )
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:32:54 there are rarely any ficticious fantasy ship
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:33:06 but when there are, they get upvotes, lots
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:33:13 atleast 20 upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:34:40 spends week making ship, only gets 20 upvotes\

plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:37:00 actually puts effort into your build, but then everyone hates it
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:37:02 <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:37:31 it only matters if it looks good to them if you want upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:37:54 but don't ask for opinions, that's the best way to summon the real life fanatics
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:38:14 nope
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:38:50 people who flame u because they think your real life build bad because it doesn't look like it's accurate to real life to them
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:38:58 how to formulate then
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:39:21 yep.
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:39:37 better not call them out except when they really are rotten to the bone
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:40:19 real life fanatics can still be saved from their horrible thinking that it's fine to flame people who doesn't make their real life build accurate enough according to u
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:41:00 thought the intakes were canards but they were intake because I looked for 5 seconds
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:41:35 but yeah, it's literally just fifa reskin, but I don't research migs so if it looks different to you, then mkay
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:41:54 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:43:22 you should've seen argument in early 2020
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:43:39 every 20 minutes, argument about who's build is better or some anime girl or some shit
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:43:47 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:45:27 migs are all fifa reskin of each other, all with their own little modifications, some time they'll actually look different like mig 21 and mig 25, otherwise they're all fifa reskin of eachother
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 13:45:48 they don't look different to me

plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:17:39 why do I feel like that's fake and photoshopped
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:18:02 the outlines are white when it should be according to the color of the block
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:18:23 looks like to me
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:18:46 <:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:19:29 not sure if you can see the white outlines tho
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:19:35 when they're welded together
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:20:48 apparently lua is easy
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:21:01 **looks at lines of codes for a simple car in roblox studio*
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:21:13 ah yes very easy language indeed
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:21:35 but who knows, maybe it's just scratch but with text
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:21:43 and more functions and commands
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:22:05 > what is...lua
your m-
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:22:16 it's the programming language every roblox game uses
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:22:38 if you don't know that, then you, my friend, is uneducated.
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:23:30 you can even import blender model to roblox
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:23:32 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:24:13 im pretty sure lua isn't that hard but the fact that it's such an intensive and demanding language makes it hard
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:24:32 500 lines of codes just for a car with steering
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:24:53 nah maybe like 50
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 14:25:20 if you want a good roblox fps, go play Polybattle, it's basically battlefield on discount

general 2020-11-18 13:31:33 " I keep out of trouble "
general 2020-11-18 13:31:48 mhm, very funny madattak
general 2020-11-18 13:32:08 the only reason was " I keep out of trouble "
general 2020-11-18 13:32:13 look where it has gotten us now
general 2020-11-18 13:32:29 and all his games haven't even gotten an update in 2 years
general 2020-11-18 13:33:05 arctic facility did get a recent update but that was 9 months ago, all the others are just minor " bug fixes "
general 2020-11-18 13:33:26 but ngl they did a pretty nice job on the map revamp and expansion
general 2020-11-18 13:33:41 other than that, they only do " minor bug fixes " every month or so
general 2020-11-18 13:34:22 I finally found the answer to why almost all russian jets look the same
general 2020-11-18 13:34:38 because, ironically, they are all fifa copypaste of eachother
general 2020-11-18 13:37:49 MiG 21 used already-existing airframes and components of the mig-19 and they slapped a new wing, a new uprated engine and a sleeker, more streamlined design, but it is essentially a fifa reskin.
general 2020-11-18 13:38:27 and also the save money, considering the USSR's economic at the era wasn't very organized
general 2020-11-18 13:39:21 so they used existing planes, uprated their designs but still made them look the same since they don't wanna study aerodynamics
general 2020-11-18 13:40:04 MiG has a tradition of always naming their aircraft odd numbers
general 2020-11-18 13:40:25 long story short, migoyan lost a bet
general 2020-11-18 13:41:00 murdering his name 👍
general 2020-11-18 13:42:18 wonder if anyone made a non-stock jet engines using propeller blades as turbines

general 2020-11-18 13:44:06 your m-
general 2020-11-18 13:44:31 > rickje give wheels more power they cant even handle an small offroad
more torque, coz power is already good, but torque is horrible
general 2020-11-18 13:44:47 you can go speed with wheels but it's torque for offroad is horrible

general 2020-11-18 13:46:50 redditor in my school ( who's one of the very few still in existance who isn't cringy af and is actually reasonable and wise ) said that reddit is that way because cynical bastards came in and ruined everything, he blames american humor ( which I totally agree with ) and those gay mods for it ( also agree )
general 2020-11-18 13:47:43 so reddit might not be that was it is today if these cynical fanatics never came in
general 2020-11-18 13:47:46 > never used reddit before
same
general 2020-11-18 13:48:59 reddit is maybe still savable, not like twitter who thinks there's more than 2 genders
general 2020-11-18 13:49:36 if you can convince the entirety of twitter that there is just 2 genders and no more than 2, you are a real life superhuman with extreme inter-personal intelligence
general 2020-11-18 13:52:58 level of savable :

furaffinity users : completely savable, but only those pejorative ones, them who enjoys furry, cannot be saved, doomed for eternity

reddit users : savable, but requires a shit ton of effort to pull their head out of their asses

Kpop fans and twitter : nope, not savable at all.
general 2020-11-18 13:54:22 savable : a word that might not exist but you instantly understand it

my guess : some kind of submarine, probably a U-boat.
plane-crazy 2020-11-19 14:11:17 but it's weird that there's this octagon in the front, maybe it's a spaceship or something

general 2020-11-20 11:58:14 had
general 2020-11-20 11:59:16 so this server was founded in 2017
general 2020-11-20 11:59:39 wait wasn't discord becoming actually active in 2014 ?
general 2020-11-20 11:59:56 coz I was there in 2014, it was a trend to get discord
general 2020-11-20 12:00:02 but now it isn't
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 12:02:05 why would you ask that in the first place
general 2020-11-20 12:05:00 me is agree with that
general 2020-11-20 12:06:02 im wondering, they said " phok useless second jet engines for VTOL ", yet they ensued the F-35 and the yak-37 with a secondary engine used only for vertical takeoff
general 2020-11-20 12:06:56 guess that was more efficient since they had to build an engine around a plane just to make sure it takes off in vtol
general 2020-11-20 12:09:15 same for the A-10, **make a gun, build a plane around it**
general 2020-11-20 12:11:36 the engine was engineered to be state of the art
general 2020-11-20 12:11:57 but then, in the end, p-47 was just an oober clan plane with a special engine.
general 2020-11-20 12:12:06 yes
general 2020-11-20 12:14:19 coz uh

plane-crazy 2020-11-20 12:43:02 
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 12:43:30 i'd say, make a pyramid-like nose, make it 3 block wide and do the cockpit right after it and proceed.
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 12:43:38 atleast that's how I would do it
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 12:44:01 i dunno, ask a guy who's got master rank
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 12:44:32 the intakes would be ( what I think ) 1.5 block wide
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 12:44:37 it has pretty huge intakes

plane-crazy 2020-11-20 12:49:14 well, they were art before a plane is build, that's called a blueprint
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 12:49:22 this is it's blueprint but better after it was built
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 12:50:15 mig-25 is actually H U G E, it's the second heaviest fighter in the world

plane-crazy 2020-11-20 12:52:06 but here, it's plane crazy, so real life fanatics, gtfo, nothing is realistic here.

plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:02:48 alright real life fanatics, GTFO, do your wisecracks elsewhere.
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:03:03 hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:03:14 if it looks good to you then 👍
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:03:42 no, not you lol, im sayin' that so the fanatics don't do the thing they did to me a few months back
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:04:13 will never ever forgive them, stole their plane of existence, and they became inactive 👍
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:05:48 eh, can't really remember, but one guy had cringe anime pfp, one guy had cringe typical american rage gamer pfp, stole their plane of existence, never came back online
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:05:54 why not, sure thing !
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:10:53 is good 👍
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:11:24 maybe add some materials somewhere to make it look better

plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:20:43 he no bacon den, just a guy with bacon hair
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:20:46 👍
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:21:16 rare few bacon hairs that isn't subhuman mentally deficient
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:21:43 he no bacon scum then, so 😎 👍

plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:29:22 fite me
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:30:24 isn't it that oober clan ship from that steampunk contest ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:30:40 i can say, no one won that contest for me since all the build look indecent <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:31:06 if rens can actually force people to make their build actually look good for a contest, appreciate it
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:31:10 and he did after I insisted
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:31:32 ww2 contest, build were better but there were still tons of terrible ones
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:31:44 fav was the me 262 some guy made
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:31:58 liek the smoak coming out of the exhaust
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:32:38 finally someone made a video about helicopter basics
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:33:49 at first, I was like " wtf that guy making a helicopter basic video even tho he does illegal coaxial and barely knows shit about it ? " but then I realized that most people are oober clan on helicopter and they don't really make swashplates, so now im glad that he made the basics tutorials for them oober clan ~~so i won't make one~~
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:34:38 nope ! not even a single bit !, just him teaching how to make helicopter fly but nothing mentioned about pros and cons, just a " make this shit ask no question " style video
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:35:01 he did explain a bit but yeah, im gonna admit, this dude did a pretty good job
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:35:30 *he's good, he's really good, but so long as I am around, he'll always be number 2*
- the mask
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:35:33 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:35:47 agree
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:36:04 most PC tutorials on yt doesn't explain shit and are mostly just made for revenue
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:36:28 98% of the video is just " copy me ask no question " style tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:36:33 same
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:36:52 aight, since there is helicopter basics, time for the advanced part
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:37:11 or maybe I can collab with that kid coz he's good at video but not in the subject itself
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:37:36 i prefer going solo instead of hearing wisecracks from an oober clan that does illegal coaxials
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:38:03 exactly <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:44:13 indeed
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:44:24 someone oughta do it
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:44:46 so it was an airship den

plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:49:09 e
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:50:30 hybrid mouse + wasd control
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:50:36 with wasd you can't aim
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:50:42 but you can maneuver fast
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:50:45 with mouse you can aim
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:50:51 but can't maneuver fast
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:51:03 combine these 2 and leave the cons, bam, perfect.
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:52:07 diamond delta wing are apparently the best wing design to counter turbulence
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:52:14 tested it on a conv engine plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:52:18 worked.
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:52:38 explains why the f-1 and the f-104 has e l o n g a t e d diamond-shaped wings
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:52:43 and short ones
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:52:50 and also the yf-23
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:53:50 oh damn i forgot it was just e l o n g a t e d delta
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:54:11 that's the fighter version of it
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:54:13 f-1
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:54:27 now replaced by f-2 ( japanese reskin of f-16 but better )
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:54:41 totally remastering it
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:55:12 jssdf ah-1
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:55:30 kizakiru or something
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:55:59 **e w**
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:58:16 you know I had to do it to em
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:58:28 cockpit stole from ah-1 otherwise the rest is custom
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 13:58:59 b e u r k
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:00:00 but then, we're on the same level, also beurk f-14
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:00:32 h8 it
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:00:43 F-14D to be precise
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:00:49 from ace combat
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:02:10 eh, looks decent but plain
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:02:53 smooth just makes things look plain
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:03:08 unless you cover it with an ugly blocky camouflage
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:04:51 that thing that jay made with trash camo
plane-crazy 2020-11-20 14:13:37 ah yes making rotor spin at supersonic speed is totally a good idea

general 2020-11-21 01:27:14 ain't gonna roleplay with them, the ad already makes them look like total douchebag
general 2020-11-21 01:27:31 " do something with your life "
general 2020-11-21 01:27:47 someone already made one ( for trains )
general 2020-11-21 01:31:33 who the fuck makes 4k block land vehicles
general 2020-11-21 01:31:41 nerf that block count
general 2020-11-21 01:33:18 3k yes, even 3k is too much
general 2020-11-21 01:33:54 unless you make a huge-ass XXXXXXL car, no one makes land vehicles past 2k or so
general 2020-11-21 01:35:13 yeah I saw it
general 2020-11-21 01:35:21 colors kinda terrible tho
general 2020-11-21 01:35:56 3k block land vehicle, just make a carrier with tank thread then
general 2020-11-21 01:36:04 same
general 2020-11-21 01:36:23 so ?
general 2020-11-21 01:37:08 expert air, considering people make huge folded airliners, block count isn't really a problem I guess
general 2020-11-21 01:37:35 + motorlock
general 2020-11-21 01:37:42 agree
general 2020-11-21 01:38:13 tanks ok, they can easily reach 1k block
general 2020-11-21 01:38:19 cars is eh
general 2020-11-21 01:38:35 AT AT don't count it's just an excuse for making a mech and calling it a land vehicle
general 2020-11-21 01:38:43 hmm
general 2020-11-21 01:38:53 4k block car
general 2020-11-21 01:39:06 4k block tank shouldn't be too difficult if you motorlock it alot
general 2020-11-21 01:39:13 and make it huge
general 2020-11-21 01:39:26 what about 4k block vtol then
general 2020-11-21 01:40:09 yeah but 4k helicarrier that flies without helium
general 2020-11-21 01:40:19 might aswell just make a custom huge-ass helicopter
general 2020-11-21 01:40:26 yes I know that
general 2020-11-21 01:40:52 aka his rocket-powered heli
general 2020-11-21 01:41:03 doesn't even fly with it's main rotor i bet
general 2020-11-21 01:41:08 saw it unfolded
general 2020-11-21 01:41:12 pure rocket spam
general 2020-11-21 01:41:39 hol'up 5 mins ago vilde was junior mod and now he mod
general 2020-11-21 01:41:49 guess we clap him then
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 01:44:43 rank system is block based
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 01:45:15 maybe how about we do a vote for if X person deserves a rank because of his build
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 01:45:36 gets VTOL expert because his build looks good and has sophisticated things
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 01:52:24 if you think that'd make me mad

plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:38:42 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:38:52 otherwise it's not critisism it's just an insult you throw at

plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:41:18 real life fanatic ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:47:36 macross planes are like ace combat's ficticious planes but huge and better
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:48:20 prob where ace combat's F-14D came from
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:52:18 f-104's " ghost " howl
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:52:25 uh-1 starting up

plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:53:52 vietcong screaming " na dao ba trung dao " when throwing a grenade or something
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:55:20 should've told it lmao
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:56:31 nothing on the f-4 is good, it's probably the worst jet plane ever made, so bad that 'murica even considered sending it's old propeller planes to fight with the mig-21's, but the war ended and they never executed it ( because it was also a bad idea )
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:57:08 why would you send ww2 planes to fight the superior jet planes <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:57:26 just send the first gen jets to fight
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:57:56 F-104 would be a pretty good first gen to use against them tree-people
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:58:28 first because they're superstitious and the haunting engine howl on afterburner will creep them out
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:58:39 second is because of it's insane speed\
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:59:07 third is because it's armament is still pretty good for that time
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:59:49 or maybe because it's easy to mass-produce it because of it's single-engine design and sleek, small and cheap advantages.
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:00:10 would definitely replace those stupid f-4 with them f-104
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:00:45 we would've won against those farmers if those HRs didn't get their heads that far up their asses
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:02:03 " oh yeah but f-4 goes mach 2.2 " BS, you godda have to go real high to reach that much speed ( and while you're high, you can't even aim ) , on level flight, it just goes 990 kmh lfmao

plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:18:08 no im not myself when it's not 3 am
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:18:10 *3 am*
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:18:12 better ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:18:13 better.
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:19:29 hm yes problem how to huge engine and huge epic intakes
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:19:31 and also howl
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:19:39 plus inverted wing
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:19:50 3 am engineer time

plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:35:18 get your plane of existence stolen 😎
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:36:21 bet it was him shitposting in general again
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:46:43 diss people's build in public server is fine
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 07:46:51 but in here, it's bound to cause chaos
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 08:10:59 pet helicopter only needs 6x6 helipad to land
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 08:11:59 might aswell land on 1 block if I can balance it perfectly
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 08:14:31 ok what if I install actual skid system instead of a rigid one
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 08:15:47 I make the most mechanically simple swashplate so it's not impossible to cram this much
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 08:16:08 I even have a 3x3 full articulation one but it's buggy as heck
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 08:17:23 well shit, can't deny that 3 am engineering is good
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 08:17:37 actual skid system
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 08:18:01 proof that it works
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 08:18:09 kinda like a tank suspension
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 08:19:12 if heli crash-lands, less chance of swashplate transforming into a comet with motors orbiting it because suspension absorbs impact
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 08:20:03 https://youtu.be/MvMcsJTOYI0
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 08:20:14 helicopter skids are not rigid and almost never were
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 08:20:25 ~~your life is a lie~~

general 2020-11-21 08:47:53 
general 2020-11-21 08:48:11 when macross planes kinda look nicer than those from ace combat
general 2020-11-21 08:48:54 or cfa 44 ripped off of it because macross was made years before the first ace combat game
general 2020-11-21 08:49:14 im pretty sure that's where most of ace combat planes got their inspiration from
general 2020-11-21 08:49:18 aight hol up
general 2020-11-21 08:49:32 1982
general 2020-11-21 08:49:36 macross
general 2020-11-21 08:49:48 there were only pathetic arcades at the time <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-11-21 08:50:34 what
general 2020-11-21 08:50:46 why would you care for the date of the plane that's first seen
general 2020-11-21 08:50:48 aight holup
general 2020-11-21 08:51:10 1982 - 1983, macross original run
general 2020-11-21 08:51:19 the plane's godda be somewhere in them
general 2020-11-21 08:51:32 but it's like, 20 years away from the fist ace combat game
general 2020-11-21 08:51:52 36 episodes
general 2020-11-21 08:52:03 hol'up lemme compare
general 2020-11-21 08:52:32 
general 2020-11-21 08:52:45 
general 2020-11-21 08:53:02 look similiar
general 2020-11-21 08:53:07 grey one is cfa-44
general 2020-11-21 08:53:16 but wouldn't say it's a copy tho
general 2020-11-21 08:53:38 im pretty sure they took inspiration from macross and the x31
general 2020-11-21 08:54:23 searches up x31, gets this
general 2020-11-21 08:54:27 another shit nasa made
general 2020-11-21 08:54:44 doesn't look similiar to the cfa-44 at all <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-11-21 08:55:28 the exhaust of it
general 2020-11-21 08:55:36 
general 2020-11-21 08:55:51 
general 2020-11-21 08:55:55 ya
general 2020-11-21 08:56:10 exhaust from x31, design taken from that macross plane
general 2020-11-21 08:57:06 while macross looks like an epic jet fighter anime, you shouldn't watch it and here's why :
general 2020-11-21 08:57:17 MECH JETS
general 2020-11-21 08:57:18 WHY
general 2020-11-21 08:57:22 AND TERRIBLE STORY
general 2020-11-21 08:57:47 so no, just no, don't watch it, only watch the fight scenes for inspiration
general 2020-11-21 08:58:08 STORIES MADE FROM JAPANESE ANIMATION STUDIOS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD !
general 2020-11-21 08:58:19 Y U MAKE TERRIBLE LOVE TRIANGLE STORY WITH MECH JETS !
general 2020-11-21 08:58:51 curse this studio who made macross, no wonder why they got bankrupt <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-11-21 08:59:02 but ngl their plane design pretty good
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:24:09 3 no-ranker chatting with eachother

plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:31:11 swashplate v-22, **looks like we got a challenger !**
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:34:37 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:34:51 fuckin' put up actual evidence that he is unde then
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:35:14 then why did you accuse him of being a unde in the first place <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:36:05 age ain't no joking matter and if you want to accuse someone of unde, do it seriously with actual evidence <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:36:21 me who wants to make an arsenal bird but can't
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:36:23 agony
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:38:37 hm
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:38:56 kinda looks plain but it's actually decent compared to those builds in public servers
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:39:34 A-10 ain't as bad as this
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:39:49 I don't care about how huge it is but this guy thinks it's minecraft lfmao
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:39:59 it's fucking shit
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:40:11 he thinks plane crazy = minecraft or what
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:40:30 doesn't look as bad as this lmao
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:40:47 so a-10 isn't too bad lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:41:05 
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:41:50 saw this in pvp
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:42:35 I don't even think he even put effort into it otherwise he'd already would've made the decision to go for wedges instead of thinking that plane crazy = minecraft <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:42:49 
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:43:06 atleast it has wedges but the fucking front
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:43:17 again, undes thinking plane crazy = minecraft
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:43:31 
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:43:38 me realizing it's a tutorial build
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:44:07 he do be flexing his nationality
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:44:33 
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:44:48 wtf was he even tryna build
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:45:16 again, another case of people thinking that plane crazy is just a fun lil game to experiment with stuff like bad piggy or something
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:45:37 
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:45:48 i don't think this plane deserves a lag machine lmao
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:46:05 hangars are just excuses for lag machines and block count <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:49:34 i fucking hate it
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:49:51 first time i got it I thought I had a virus or a ghost behind me or something
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:49:53 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:49:57 still hate it
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:50:41 it was bikers from south park but it's still fucking creepy to hear your engine sound like people shaking themselves to death
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:53:01 if I win a dragon platinium contest, I get 100 bobuc or so if I get 1st place
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:53:09 enter 3 contest, gets 300 bobux
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:53:11 get speaker
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:53:17 now I can make my engines howl
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:54:33 win 3 DG contest
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:54:39 damn, the odds are low
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:54:59 someone shittalked about me in DG discord and im pretty sure they're gonna downvote my builds to death
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:55:09 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:55:23 ah yes, just rens, he gives free bobux for random things
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:55:40 yeah, unde discord means terrible builds
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:56:14 fucking shittalking unde tried to call me to " talk " to me like a fucking karen <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:56:34 I immediatly blocked him and told PCC about it
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:56:41 kekws ensue
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:59:02 what
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:59:30 so my stock engine only jet accelerate at 650 but when i turn it doesn't bleed it's speed
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:59:48 and it's pretty maneuverable
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 13:59:57 **and it wasn't even max power**

plane-crazy 2020-11-21 14:53:42 so this ensues :

plane-crazy 2020-11-21 14:53:53 " better ? "
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 14:54:00 " **better.** "
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 14:54:22 then they go away after taking beans or egg salad out of the freezer
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 14:54:32 them phoking friends
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 14:55:37 you see a friend standing guard round your bed at 3 am, give them egg salad in the freezer, they're just hungry

plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:34:26 everything else is shit compared to these 2
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:34:41 + it's only one guy

plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:35:33 both
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:35:55 pop song : generic stupid shit undes listen to
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:36:03 " heavy " metal : also generic shit
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:36:08 kpop song : shit shit
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:37:13 have a listen to mick gordon and " heavy " metal will turn into groove jazz but with electric guitar
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:38:52 yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:39:03 so what
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:39:30 yea
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:39:31 so
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:39:40 r u obligated to believe me ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:39:43 no ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:39:53 then don't start an argument out of everything like you do everyday
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:40:15 hell yeah sabaton pretty good, have you listened to " reign of terror " yet ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:40:25 that's probably their best song
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:48:28 <@!555965248184778753> https://youtu.be/dCnUOVO4lU4 there you go, probably sabaton's heaviest and best song !
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:49:00 mhm
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:49:16 the first one yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:49:24 but this one's the remastered version
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:49:32 primo victoria rearmed
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:49:46 mhm
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:49:59 that looks unde enough to not be a tut
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:50:46 most of tutorials here are just made for money, they don't explain things, it's just " shut up and copy me " style tutorial.
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:51:20 the only person who **doens't** do it for the money but for the sake of making other people brain expand is proto
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:51:37 he actually explains instead of doing a " shut up and copy me " thing
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:51:41 i approve
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 15:51:53 ***everything***
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 01:50:11 yup
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 01:50:33 get like, those huge mig-31 intakes or something ( or just make it accurate to what you're building )
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 02:31:07 make f-104 but uprated then put engine howl to scare the whole map
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 02:31:15 perfect
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 02:31:53 but the only problem is I don't have speaker
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 02:32:03 
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 02:34:05 and also because there isn't enough wedge to make f-104 look good and round
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 02:34:23 agony
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 02:34:32 but we'll see when finish
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 02:37:28 if not enough wedge then I make my own
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 02:37:33 lock on command
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 02:38:22 just put delta wing

plane-crazy 2020-11-22 03:37:35 * eat arm then drag him into sewer *
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 13:09:21 the fuck is both of those builds
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 13:09:50 one has cringe suspension and looks like someone drew it while having cerebral palsy
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 13:10:08 the other has chonk disease and is extremely blocky and has a tumour
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 13:11:16 sure I might never make a huge-ass 3 fold plane like that but atleast I won't make it have lobster tumour syndrome <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 13:11:32 and as for the car, y'all know the monk
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 13:11:50 WHAT IN THE CRISPY FUCK IS THAT NOSE AND BODY
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 13:12:34 huge doesn't mean good on my book, the nose and the overall body just ruins everything
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 13:12:56 wouldn't give my huge plane an extremely wedgy and blocky nose lmao

plane-crazy 2020-11-22 13:43:05 the only guy who can beat any exploiter without using exploit here is YAD
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 13:43:20 I mean seriously, look at his builds in creation
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 13:44:04 he uses 0 exploits at all, and yet he's able to make a full-on extremely advanced F-15 chassis
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 13:45:43 YAD

plane-crazy 2020-11-22 13:47:24 he even makes 1 block tall swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 13:47:30 **one fucking block tall**
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 13:48:23 REALLY good
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 13:48:30 no, EXTREMELY good.
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 13:48:41 **no exploits**

plane-crazy 2020-11-22 13:49:53 man I just wish he could be more online, but he's probably drawing blueprint for the navy's next helicopter
plane-crazy 2020-11-22 13:53:23 im getting a bit bored of swashplates, time to get back to land vehicle and thrust vectoring
general 2020-11-27 12:52:32 anyone ever seen a fighter jet fly irl ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 12:53:12 most tutorials are just shit and all you have to do is to just copy from them.
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 12:53:25 agreed.
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 12:53:34 he doesn't make much tutorials
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 12:53:39 voxel makes good tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 12:54:10 lmao no, vulpen is just here for the money, he's just another " shut up and copy " tutorial guy ( no offense, that's what I think )
general 2020-11-27 12:54:24 r e a l s h i t ?
general 2020-11-27 12:55:05 me : Mirage III, Alphajet, UH-1, F-18 Hornet and I think that's it
general 2020-11-27 12:55:26 I know alphajet is a trainer but anyways
general 2020-11-27 12:55:33 but holy shit they are EXTREMELY loud
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 12:55:58 no one actually made an actual good tutorial for motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 12:56:12 i've watched rens tutorial for motorlock, it seems like he's just " throwing words "
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 12:56:55 proto's tutorial is excellent but it only teaches you the mechanism, and the video was made when motorlock wasn't quite perfected and optimized for builds yet
bot-central 2020-11-27 12:57:43 !servers
general 2020-11-27 12:58:36 maybe go in a random airfield and see em
general 2020-11-27 12:58:55 I saw a B-2 passing over my house, im wondering what the fuck is it doing in thailand
general 2020-11-27 12:59:21 it's shape is unmistable, a flying triangle that's huge and almost silent ? that's the goddamn B-2
general 2020-11-27 13:00:09 some retired airliner ?
general 2020-11-27 13:00:41 normally thailand buys alot of export planes
general 2020-11-27 13:00:52 but the B-2 is kinda banned from export like the F-22
general 2020-11-27 13:01:09 so W H Y was there a b-2 passing over my house
general 2020-11-27 13:02:00 black flying triangle, that's unmistakable
general 2020-11-27 13:02:38 I see lots of heli fly over my skewl
general 2020-11-27 13:02:44 mostly UH-60s
general 2020-11-27 13:03:00 to my suprise they aren't as loud as in the videos I see of them
general 2020-11-27 13:05:25 it was pretty huge
general 2020-11-27 13:05:55 so i'd say it's a B-2
general 2020-11-27 13:20:15 extremely fucking loud, like as if you were standing next to a rocket
general 2020-11-27 13:20:23 even if you cover your ears lmao
general 2020-11-27 13:20:47 I swear I couldn't hear anything for 30 minutes after that
general 2020-11-27 13:21:05 30 minutes, as if a grenade detonated
general 2020-11-27 13:21:27 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-11-27 13:22:10 some loud aircraft I can compare to is the B-1
general 2020-11-27 13:22:36 I thought my ears were getting ripped out when I heard it's afterburners kicking in
general 2020-11-27 13:22:46 still not as loud as a single alphajet <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-11-27 13:23:15 suprising how some smol trainer aircraft is louder than a strategic bomber with 4 engines <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-11-27 13:27:36 makes heli but it's only controlled by the swashplate and there's no turboshaft to go foward
general 2020-11-27 13:27:39 only pitch
general 2020-11-27 13:27:45 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
general 2020-11-27 13:28:15 wanted to add engine to go foward so then it's realistic helicopter but not enough space
general 2020-11-27 13:28:22 otherwise it will ruin the build
general 2020-11-27 13:28:33 and also the weight
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 14:29:04 aight that's another cringe doge pfp

plane-crazy 2020-11-28 03:57:11 made it just for speed, 200 speed in foward flight, not disappointed at all
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 03:58:56 this is my most technologically advanced helicopter yet
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 03:59:13 super stable, no helium of course
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:02:17 it's not illegal to use helium, **unlike making your helicopter coaxial**
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:02:18 <:Duck:606204496695001091>
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:02:28 ( if it's coaxial on purpose then ok )
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:02:59 ( but if coaxial has a tail rotor or if it was based off a real life helicopter with a single rotor, then <:Duck:606204496695001091> )
creations-chat 2020-11-28 04:04:05 ( Super ) T-2 remaster or not ?
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:04:30 wood is not lighter, it's just like default
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:04:44 light materials are fabric and ice
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:04:49 not more than these 2
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:05:01 fabric is somehow better for helicopter rotor
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:05:06 but you should never locc them
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:05:33 I think i'll remaster my T-2 into an F-1
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:05:45 it looks pretty shit and I kinda hate it
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:05:59 
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:07:01 proof that motorlocking doesn't instantly make your build look better by any means
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:08:03 
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:08:07 F-1
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:09:01 T-2
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:09:34 the only difference I can spot is a larger engine, longer fuselage and cockpit, larger intake and larger wings
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:10:24 sepecat is thiccer than f-1
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:10:48 
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:10:54 they look pretty similiar tho
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:12:29 throw that trash t-2 into the dump, get new f-1
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:13:05 pretty weird that it's wings aren't pointed down as much as the t-2, it's almost straight
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:14:34 F-1 is apparently one of the fastest planes in the world
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:14:42 even tho it's only mach 1 capable
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:14:43 kekw
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:15:18 but i've seen a video of it, and holy shit, when they turn on the reheat, the acceleration will probably turn the pilot into pudge
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:15:41 it can easily reach mach 1, that's why they say it's so fast
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:16:00 kekw
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:17:07 american jets can reach mach 2, sure, they can supercruise, sure, but it will take them a tremendous amount of time to reach mach 1 on supercruise
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:17:31 even with afterburners, it's not like it's gonna reduce the time by half, only by a third
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:18:07 but the f-1, while it cannot supercruise and only goes mach 1, when the afterburners kick in, it's acceleration is like a fucking rocket
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 04:19:50 a good opponent for F-1 is the F-104, this thing also has the " **godda go fast** " syndrome

plane-crazy 2020-11-28 08:45:00 simply can't have nice color without having max graphics and a high-quality GPU to actually see how it is
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 08:45:23 I put 80,80,80 in browser RGB, then in PC, they look offset by 2
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 08:45:51 in PC it's 82,82,82 even tho the input is 80,80,80 compared to the accurate browser RGB
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 08:46:06 colors either need to be fixed or I get a high-quality gpu
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 08:46:30 but i've never had a high-quality gpu to actually see the difference
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 08:46:44 but im pretty sure it's still gonna be offset by 2
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 08:48:37 yesb.
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 08:48:56 compared to the accurate and perfect RGB in browser color websites
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 08:48:59 I compared
plane-crazy 2020-11-28 08:49:28 but I don't care, atleast we can fine tune the colors, not like in BaBfT

general 2020-11-28 09:00:53 I h8 anime where, to tease fans, they just throw in a psychotic anime girl that's like a tsundere but psycho ( and that's obviously pretending it wants to kill the main character but they don't even have the balls to )
general 2020-11-28 09:02:09 really annoying for me to have dedicated 7 minutes to a scene where the main character deals with the psychotic girl in a black background and she acts like a tsundere but without the " sweet " part and a sprinkle of psycho
general 2020-11-28 09:03:18 2 types of them exist : the one that really break a leg to act like she wanna kill the main character and the one that is manipulative psycho.
general 2020-11-28 09:03:55 remove these useless characters already, **no more bla bla in front of camera**
general 2020-11-28 09:05:24 I feel like most modern anime today are just choke-full of fanservice and fillers, you can't get actual fun out of them, half of the time, it seems like the story is progressing but it's not
general 2020-11-28 09:05:47 I prefer shows like " legend of the galactic hero " and evangelion
general 2020-11-28 09:05:55 they actually have a story that makes sense
general 2020-11-28 09:06:33 there's so many gundam spinoff I don't even know which one is the main story and which one is a side story
general 2020-11-28 09:08:04 evangelion is the complete opposite of a mecha anime, except for the mecha part
general 2020-11-28 09:08:28 oh so you think it's fun to watch ? **it gives you philosophical stuff to think on and a life lesson at the end**
general 2020-11-28 09:09:39 oh so you think it's " haha robot go boom boom with eachother " ? **you see a robot ripping off another robot and eating it's organs while the pilot is having a mental breakdown**
general 2020-11-28 09:10:12 not much anime
general 2020-11-28 09:10:24 I just spend most of the time playing PC
general 2020-11-28 09:10:42 not really interested in anime, except when it's actually worth watching
general 2020-11-28 09:11:10 i've heard so many talk surrounding evangelion so I decided to watch it, probably stayed in my soul forever.

general 2020-11-29 02:47:34 alright let's move on
general 2020-11-29 02:48:10 who thinks the F-14D super tomcat should've been produced ?
general 2020-11-29 02:48:25 or even that wide wing variant of the f-16
general 2020-11-29 02:48:36 ya
general 2020-11-29 02:49:00 wider wing = less fuel compared to distance traveled
general 2020-11-29 02:49:35 super tomcat and f-16xl should've gone into production
general 2020-11-29 02:49:55 but I guess these aren't as controversial as the **yf-21**
general 2020-11-29 02:50:07 it REALLY should've been built, it clearly was the better choice
general 2020-11-29 02:50:50 it's way more stealthy, is more efficient in fuel, easy to maintain and some other advantages that puts that plastic f-22 to shame
general 2020-11-29 02:51:18 yep
general 2020-11-29 02:51:27 same
general 2020-11-29 02:51:40 I like japan's variant F-2A more
general 2020-11-29 02:52:04 
general 2020-11-29 02:52:24 they buffed the f-16 at the cost of speed or so
general 2020-11-29 02:52:31 but it's better than every aspect
general 2020-11-29 02:52:49 japan is apparently gonna be the first to make sixth-generation fighter jet
general 2020-11-29 02:52:59 based off the X2 shinshin
general 2020-11-29 02:53:33 dassault neuron
general 2020-11-29 02:53:42 is that sixth gen or not ?
general 2020-11-29 02:54:12 but it's not manned and it doesn't really have the aspect of what is considered to be 6th gen, let alone 4th
general 2020-11-29 02:55:13 i put some research into the F-1 and they say it's one of the fastest plane because, it doesn't have to gain altitude for more air to go supersonic
general 2020-11-29 02:55:21 dark.

general 2020-11-29 03:05:12 I don't really want mod, it'd probably he hard to keep up with and people will meme about me to death
general 2020-11-29 03:05:18 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2020-11-29 03:06:00 i'll maybe be mod when times are good enough and I get new gaming laptop
general 2020-11-29 03:06:27 godda replace that trash pentium laptop of mine

general 2020-11-29 03:07:39 what's with plane crazy and the p word
general 2020-11-29 03:07:51 I see p word I go <:RickoMode:602011035003519006>
general 2020-11-29 03:10:21 sixth gen jet
general 2020-11-29 03:11:24 I don't know why but when i search up sixth gen fighter, they're all flying wings
general 2020-11-29 03:11:41 what's with the flying wings
general 2020-11-29 03:11:45 I don't get it
general 2020-11-29 03:12:10 may b
general 2020-11-29 03:12:39 this is what I think would be more accurate to a sixth gen
general 2020-11-29 03:13:11 B2 is just angled and has radar absorbing paint spamming, that's what I think
general 2020-11-29 03:14:05 I think 7th ( or even 8th ) gen is going to look like this
general 2020-11-29 03:14:17 
general 2020-11-29 03:14:30 wings fold for less drag
general 2020-11-29 03:14:34 mach 2 supercruise
general 2020-11-29 03:14:46 mach 3.7 afterburner probably
general 2020-11-29 03:14:53 some unmanned capability
general 2020-11-29 03:15:12 that poster is so innacurate
general 2020-11-29 03:15:25 F-22 doesn't go mach 4
general 2020-11-29 03:15:47 F-15 mach 2.4, it's the fastest jet in the US arsenal
general 2020-11-29 03:16:18 mach 4 afterburner for 7th gen
general 2020-11-29 03:16:31 if you turn, you get turned into a pudge
general 2020-11-29 03:16:47 unless you commit remove leg.exe
general 2020-11-29 03:17:08 now you're less likely to get g-force'd
general 2020-11-29 03:18:24 I read the lore lel
general 2020-11-29 03:18:47 but they say there's not enough evidence the back it up that it's a 5th gen or so
general 2020-11-29 03:18:58 they estimate it's a 6th gen
general 2020-11-29 03:19:12 oh yeah, alternate universe, right.
general 2020-11-29 03:19:32 even tho in some ace combat game, they refer their planet to earth
general 2020-11-29 03:19:35 strange.
general 2020-11-29 03:20:08 concept art for a naval variant of the F-22
general 2020-11-29 03:20:20 hol' up imma check acepedia
general 2020-11-29 03:21:55 fans of ace combat coined the universe of their's as " strangereal " after some grammatical error in one of the games
general 2020-11-29 03:22:37 acceptable.
general 2020-11-29 03:22:44 but it's not **canon**
general 2020-11-29 03:22:59 they say it's 5th gen according to the classification
general 2020-11-29 03:23:16 I'd think, canonically ( assuming ) that it's prob a 7th gen
general 2020-11-29 03:23:44 there's no mention I found about saying that the X-02 is a fifth gen, except according to the classification
general 2020-11-29 03:23:46 hmm
general 2020-11-29 03:23:49 gibe source
general 2020-11-29 03:24:11 they say fifth gen because of the classification
general 2020-11-29 03:24:19 but I believe it's more of a 7th gen
general 2020-11-29 03:24:27 gibe source I wanna see and confirm
general 2020-11-29 03:24:34 if they really said that it's a 5th gen
general 2020-11-29 03:24:51 otherwise it still count as 5th gen because classification
general 2020-11-29 03:25:22 
general 2020-11-29 03:25:34 
general 2020-11-29 03:25:46 ya it's 5th gen in their universe then
general 2020-11-29 03:25:51 acceptable.
general 2020-11-29 03:26:39 the heck
general 2020-11-29 03:26:44 who's next
general 2020-11-29 03:26:48 <:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>
general 2020-11-29 03:27:49 bandai did a fail, they made ace combat 3 set in 2040, now they have to follow that lore, it's a damocles sword on em
general 2020-11-29 03:28:19 they damocles'd themselves <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-11-29 03:28:53 now they're gonna make as much spinoffs as possible to avoid following the lore
general 2020-11-29 03:29:09 never set a game into the future, kids
general 2020-11-29 03:29:26 you put a damocles sword on yourself because now you have to follow the lore <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-11-29 03:30:24 I expect ace combat 10 to have nemo destroying everything ( in the real world and not the simulation ) and have it as a final boss
general 2020-11-29 03:30:44 hell, even earlier maybe, ace combat 8

general 2020-11-30 12:51:25 you couldn't be more wrong.
general 2020-11-30 12:51:28 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
general 2020-11-30 12:51:49 who the fuck reads anarchist theory
general 2020-11-30 12:52:04 probably some lone-ass guy in his room having nothing left to do in his life.
general 2020-11-30 12:52:25 anarchy = revolt anarchism = revolt but overall
general 2020-11-30 12:52:37 so is this even political ?
general 2020-11-30 12:53:04 what's the point of saying that anarchism is the ideology of anarchist if you steer into politics territory ?
general 2020-11-30 12:53:23 I don't see much there so don't go too far off
general 2020-11-30 12:53:34 basically revolt
general 2020-11-30 12:53:37 ok
general 2020-11-30 12:54:00 why do revolt usually start = coz the leader was an ass
general 2020-11-30 12:54:14 same thing you said
general 2020-11-30 12:54:47 revolt, basically.
general 2020-11-30 12:54:53 revolt except bad
general 2020-11-30 12:55:44 then if you tryna do grammar dictator, tell me the right word for people arguing like apes for no reason / malicious reason
general 2020-11-30 12:56:11 mhm, and the mods are the congressmens ?
general 2020-11-30 12:56:25 he tryna turn PCC political
general 2020-11-30 12:56:26 m
general 2020-11-30 12:56:28 very m
general 2020-11-30 12:56:31 triple very m
general 2020-11-30 12:56:54 or you don't know anarchism and you're tryna speak to a wall
general 2020-11-30 12:57:30 ok so i got the definition of anarchy and anarchism
general 2020-11-30 12:57:39 they're the same thing whether you like it or not
general 2020-11-30 12:57:55 it's basically revolt but there's no one to control it no goverment
general 2020-11-30 12:58:11 says the guy who's tryna compare PCC to a political system
general 2020-11-30 12:58:33 kewl, now go compare discord to anarchism and we'll see what you get
general 2020-11-30 12:59:01 that's what I searched
general 2020-11-30 12:59:08 and it means revolt without government
general 2020-11-30 12:59:13 and also bad
general 2020-11-30 12:59:47 belief in abolition of all government
general 2020-11-30 12:59:48 revolt
general 2020-11-30 13:00:05 basically the same thing since they're both tryna overthrow a power
general 2020-11-30 13:00:14 basically, revolt
general 2020-11-30 13:00:39 so then revolt
general 2020-11-30 13:00:44 = anarchy
general 2020-11-30 13:00:59 coz state is being an ass to them
general 2020-11-30 13:01:24 your bus might crash at any moment and you won't even know it
general 2020-11-30 13:01:31 final destination
general 2020-11-30 13:01:47 because no one even reads anarchist theory ?
general 2020-11-30 13:02:13 and that it's just some thing someone made to justify that anarchist and anarchism ain't the same thing except it is ?
general 2020-11-30 13:02:21 <:what:644996672048463942>
general 2020-11-30 13:02:35 anarchism = anarchy = revolt but bad
general 2020-11-30 13:03:03 so in fact, creations chat is anarchy because people revolt against eachother for malicious reasons
general 2020-11-30 13:03:27 don't need that " anarchist quantum space time theory of the universe " thing or whatever
general 2020-11-30 13:04:23 is that so eh
general 2020-11-30 13:04:33 so now we're gonna need a goddamn book to prove that
general 2020-11-30 13:04:43 like that anarchist theory thing !
general 2020-11-30 13:05:14 coz apparently some guy made 2 google search on what anarchy and anarchist is, gets obsessed with their differences and made a half-assed theory about it
general 2020-11-30 13:05:36 revolt but bad = anarchy
general 2020-11-30 13:05:45 is date even relevant ?
general 2020-11-30 13:05:50 does that change anything ?
general 2020-11-30 13:06:10 which part of it then
general 2020-11-30 13:06:19 even if it has google in it
general 2020-11-30 13:06:38 so what I have to tweak it to the 1800'
general 2020-11-30 13:07:25 guy picks up dictionnary, becomes obsessed with the origin and difference of anarchy and anarchism, then make a half-assed theory about it.
general 2020-11-30 13:07:28 fixed.
general 2020-11-30 13:07:30 happy now ?
general 2020-11-30 13:07:40 never happy I see
general 2020-11-30 13:08:58 alright then, then let's do what that half-assed author did and become obsessed with the difference between 2 words and make a half-assed theory about it, now you can make people claim they know shit about the difference of 2 words when they're essentially based on the same thing and make an argument out of it
general 2020-11-30 13:09:24 does that even matter
general 2020-11-30 13:09:35 not even a single bit
general 2020-11-30 13:09:52 doesn't change the fact that it was based on the same idea
general 2020-11-30 13:09:55 revolt but bad
general 2020-11-30 13:10:00 anarchy
general 2020-11-30 13:10:04 anarchism
general 2020-11-30 13:10:41 could say the same about you and your half-assed " aNaRcHy tHeoRy "

general 2020-11-30 13:12:36 dead game
general 2020-11-30 13:12:52 people still play it because apparently you become cool kid
general 2020-11-30 13:13:31 while it was still popular af in the past, no one was considered kewl kiddo for playing it, you'd still be regular gamer
general 2020-11-30 13:13:45 now it makes you the cool kid because apparently some pie guy played it
general 2020-11-30 13:13:58 and it's gonna become fucking popular again
general 2020-11-30 13:14:08 and it won't make you the cool kid no longer
general 2020-11-30 13:15:10 in the next 2 years it's gonna jump-start it's popularity again and won't even make you the cool kid like it used to now
general 2020-11-30 13:15:26 i'd just make you a regular gamer like it was before in the 2010'
general 2020-11-30 13:16:11 I already am
general 2020-11-30 13:16:19 😎 👍
general 2020-11-30 13:16:54 now I put on my ray ban sunglasses and let him eat my fuel exhaust coming out of my afterburners because I am a rank above his designer
general 2020-11-30 13:17:14 ah yes him too

general 2020-11-30 13:17:41 *higher ?*
general 2020-11-30 13:18:27 drag dead body to shore
general 2020-11-30 13:18:46 draw a pentagon
general 2020-11-30 13:18:56 offer to Gilles
general 2020-11-30 13:19:06 sucessfully covered crim
general 2020-11-30 13:19:56 before : OCEAN EVAPORATING OMG
general 2020-11-30 13:20:03 now : O SHITE IT'S RISING
general 2020-11-30 13:21:32 I bet 2 dollars no one will ever have omplete, concrete and real proof of global warming backed up with second arguments and full paperback details.
general 2020-11-30 13:21:56 if someone actually does that, then take my 2 dollars
general 2020-11-30 13:22:08 really ?
general 2020-11-30 13:22:15 well it seems im still holding it
general 2020-11-30 13:22:24 otherwise it didn't vanish off my hand
general 2020-11-30 13:22:52 reject science or reject some foolish claims ?
general 2020-11-30 13:23:12 yet again darkzified couldn't even be more wrong
general 2020-11-30 13:23:46 give me full and complete concrete and real verificable proof of it and i'll pay you a beer.
general 2020-11-30 13:23:56 or make one since no one has one
general 2020-11-30 13:23:58 hmm
general 2020-11-30 13:24:05 alright then
general 2020-11-30 13:24:20 whoever does that, you get paid a beer
general 2020-11-30 13:25:24 do a full proof of global warming ( maybe even while holding a beer for badass effect ) and get a(nother) beer
general 2020-11-30 13:25:48 hm sure
general 2020-11-30 13:26:20 not my fault if most of people who claim that global warming exist lives in one of the hottest countries in the world
general 2020-11-30 13:26:57 and antartica doesn't seem to be melting any time soon, it'd probably just stay still there for some thousands of years
general 2020-11-30 13:27:33 alright let's see proof of global warming and I'll see what I can do to debunk them
general 2020-11-30 13:27:48 ooo nasa
general 2020-11-30 13:27:59 they're expert they can't be lying amirite ?
general 2020-11-30 13:28:03 let's try to debunk em
general 2020-11-30 13:28:46 ***nasa has a time traveling machine now ?***
general 2020-11-30 13:29:43 first proof easily debunked, you can't rewind thousands of years back and measure the precise carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere
general 2020-11-30 13:29:53 and this is nasa's website
general 2020-11-30 13:29:57 alright next
general 2020-11-30 13:30:41 alright so claims of global warming by 2 degree without any sources as you say
general 2020-11-30 13:31:27 for all I know, if there is no **actual** evidence about global warming at all, then it is bullshit.
general 2020-11-30 13:31:41 ah shit here we go again with intake useless
general 2020-11-30 13:31:48 **i meant that for the game**
general 2020-11-30 13:31:53 **not real life**
general 2020-11-30 13:32:44 one source, aka nasa and common sense
general 2020-11-30 13:33:06 ok so greenhouse effect does exist, it is real
general 2020-11-30 13:33:55 but physics don't go like " oh yeah let's go sicko mode on earth all of a sudden and attempt to fry everyone in it "
general 2020-11-30 13:34:22 hearsay, you mean common sense
general 2020-11-30 13:34:27 something you'll probably never have
general 2020-11-30 13:35:15 so we apparently broke the lil' blanket on our atmosphere and greenhouse effect goes sicko mode because there's more openings
general 2020-11-30 13:35:20 mhm alright
general 2020-11-30 13:35:33 acceptable but does it warm the earth this fast ?
general 2020-11-30 13:36:32 ok so since we throw a shit ton of metal tangled with thin metal things in a huge metal thing that flies and send it to the lil' blanket in the atmosphere and pierce it
general 2020-11-30 13:36:51 then ok greenhaus can god sicko mode all of a sudden because there's some holes
general 2020-11-30 13:37:14 could say that to anyone
general 2020-11-30 13:38:09 the earth ain't flat otherwise you'd see the edge of it and you can fall off of it lmao
general 2020-11-30 13:38:26 fonk
general 2020-11-30 13:38:39 I realize that
general 2020-11-30 13:38:48 but how many majority are we talking about
general 2020-11-30 13:38:49 m
general 2020-11-30 13:39:35 m
general 2020-11-30 13:39:35 I might wanna be an artist but I might end up being the guy who completely destroyed any proof of global warming after this
general 2020-11-30 13:39:50 search up the meaning of edgy then
general 2020-11-30 13:40:09 global warming fake and global warming real are both really controversial and popular belief
general 2020-11-30 13:40:33 what did that guy do
general 2020-11-30 13:40:59 ban wave in this week now who's next
general 2020-11-30 13:41:10 mayb
general 2020-11-30 13:41:24 source if you're saying so
general 2020-11-30 13:41:40 otherwise we'll say it's " hEaRsAy "
general 2020-11-30 13:42:10 because apparently you don't have a single ounce of something called " common sense "
general 2020-11-30 13:42:29 yes ???
general 2020-11-30 13:42:45 denying global warming is opinion
general 2020-11-30 13:42:56 providing proof for it is common sense to do
general 2020-11-30 13:43:01 11
general 2020-11-30 13:43:21 22
general 2020-11-30 13:43:52 7528724972492482586246814268481641974184197418631865914814814174184861486148614824809259724924296428642862496486248624
general 2020-11-30 13:44:04 ip adress stealer ?
general 2020-11-30 13:44:40 what about nasa eh
general 2020-11-30 13:45:20 it's the united nations not some global warming group
general 2020-11-30 13:45:48 UN
general 2020-11-30 13:46:17 based off UNP and UN
general 2020-11-30 13:47:14 I may be stupid as a stupid but if there's no actual concrete proof for something, then it is not worth.
general 2020-11-30 13:47:26 ceo of ceo
general 2020-11-30 13:47:30 im firing all of them
general 2020-11-30 13:47:47 4 post and you reject common sense
general 2020-11-30 13:47:49 lfmao
general 2020-11-30 13:48:46 ok so greenhaus factual but does it fuck up the earth's temperature that fast
general 2020-11-30 13:48:59 said it
general 2020-11-30 13:49:10 and most of the proof mayb can be debunk'd
general 2020-11-30 13:49:20 could say the same about you
general 2020-11-30 13:49:25 alright sure
general 2020-11-30 13:51:01 takes me to a web where it's only wooden language to fool you and there's only ever one evidence in each chapter
general 2020-11-30 13:51:03 ok
general 2020-11-30 13:51:09 maybe not fool you but
general 2020-11-30 13:51:25 it's still just wooden language to not give any actual answer
general 2020-11-30 13:51:41 or you didn't even read it and just picked it off the web
general 2020-11-30 13:51:54 no convincing evidence of global warming
general 2020-12-01 13:27:10 worst plane in history
general 2020-12-01 13:27:17 give me
general 2020-12-01 13:28:47 how to plane fast 101 :
general 2020-12-01 13:29:03 The more swept back your wing is, the more turbulence but the more speed there is
general 2020-12-01 13:29:23 the lighter your aircraft is, the more thrust to weight ratio it gets
general 2020-12-01 13:30:01 thrust to weight : according to the internet's claim that made me lose my mind, amount of thrust compared to it's weight
general 2020-12-01 13:30:26 the larger it is, the better, basically kill ratio except plane
general 2020-12-01 13:32:20 flash player is gonna die, quick, play all your favorite flash games while you can
general 2020-12-01 13:33:03 google's only cherry-picked frivolous reason to remove flash from the internet ? **because people are apparently using more " open-browser app " or some shit**
general 2020-12-01 13:33:27 basically they have no reasons to and it's only gonna bastardize them further
general 2020-12-01 13:33:42 might aswell remove HTML from the internet while they're at it
general 2020-12-01 13:33:46 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 13:34:20 roblox filter doing the funnit so you have to separate the text eh ?
general 2020-12-01 13:35:14 man if we don't do something before the deadline, flash might disappear forever from the net
general 2020-12-01 13:35:36 hol' up does this mean we still gonna have flash player if we have it installed and it will still work ?
general 2020-12-01 13:35:44 or they gonna remove that support
general 2020-12-01 13:36:05 even then, there's still flash plugins on chrome store so lfmao
general 2020-12-01 13:36:26 nani ?
general 2020-12-01 13:36:49 it says no engine for any movement
general 2020-12-01 13:36:59 bob telling tomfooleries again smh
general 2020-12-01 13:37:36 rule 2
general 2020-12-01 13:37:40 and it's an I.E
general 2020-12-01 13:37:53 but yeah, only wings for movement
general 2020-12-01 13:38:22 whoever the fuck told you that has the record for having his head as humanely far up his ass as possible
general 2020-12-01 13:38:26 if the earth was flat
general 2020-12-01 13:38:32 then we would see the edge
general 2020-12-01 13:38:39 and fall off of it
general 2020-12-01 13:39:26 nope\
general 2020-12-01 13:39:43 any stock engine to control the airplane then no
general 2020-12-01 13:39:46 nothing
general 2020-12-01 13:40:15 pitch yaw and roll, if any of these are controlled by engines ( any sort at all ) then no
general 2020-12-01 13:40:37 yet again another attempt at bastardizing me further without any context whatsoever
general 2020-12-01 13:40:54 *no convincing evidence, both sides*
general 2020-12-01 13:41:00 according to what I searched
general 2020-12-01 13:41:32 but whoever has convincing evidence for any of the sides, get my beer.
general 2020-12-01 13:41:39 yep
general 2020-12-01 13:41:49 but not hover engines or magnet or anything like that
general 2020-12-01 13:41:53 only stock engine
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 13:42:24 agree
plane-crazy 2020-12-01 13:42:35 i see the laureats already growing 'round his heads for this guy
general 2020-12-01 13:42:57 mid december probs
general 2020-12-01 13:43:08 tre
general 2020-12-01 13:43:29 because, krima
general 2020-12-01 13:43:44 krima
general 2020-12-01 13:43:54 especially for PCC is was terrible
general 2020-12-01 13:44:03 krima update better be good
general 2020-12-01 13:44:08 krima !
general 2020-12-01 13:44:56 what is the worst-looking plane ever ?
general 2020-12-01 13:45:15 yup
general 2020-12-01 13:46:59 for me it's probably the F-8 with it's ugly-ass pogchamp intake, probably just an excuse for " america is original we're the best omg ! " when they realized russian's equivalent of pogchamp intake design was better at the time
general 2020-12-01 13:47:50 it's russian counter, mig-21 just looked better in every aspect
general 2020-12-01 13:48:41 same thing
general 2020-12-01 13:48:56 just make the cockpit an intake lmao
general 2020-12-01 13:49:04 like the russian migs at the time
general 2020-12-01 13:50:57 grammarly when autocorrect exist
general 2020-12-01 13:51:56 an attempt to advertise a thing that's already implemented everywhere, aka autocorrect
general 2020-12-01 13:52:40 get grammarly to CECFR's level and we'll see
general 2020-12-01 13:53:00 otherwise it's just oober clan product that's advertised to death like that shitty raid shadow legends
general 2020-12-01 13:53:38 overhyped shit
general 2020-12-01 13:53:44 overadvertised shit
general 2020-12-02 13:32:59 if you could control decisions made in the vietnam war, what'd you pick to make it better ?
general 2020-12-02 13:34:29 *black sun* or the sun
general 2020-12-02 13:35:12 I'd probably make a major decision and throw away all the trash plastic F-4s, and replace them with updated older planes
general 2020-12-02 13:35:31 the F-100D super sabre is a good option to go
general 2020-12-02 13:36:08 modify it to fit the battlefield's requirement, put AIM-9s and tell your pilot not to be reliant on missiles and you're good to go
general 2020-12-02 13:36:43 I'd also use the navy to my full advantage and spam the Sea Demons
general 2020-12-02 13:36:54 lel
general 2020-12-02 13:37:45 plus, also seeing how a gunship made from a modified plane can cause massive damage, I'd spam that on the battlefield
general 2020-12-02 13:38:33 the original spooky gunship, puff the magic dragon, enters mass production, then gets spammed on the vietcongs from my own commands
general 2020-12-02 13:39:08 we still can't throw a sun on them or anyone to this day
general 2020-12-02 13:39:37 that'd be a pretty good idea but i'd destroy the planet along
general 2020-12-02 13:39:56 i need jeuse ?
general 2020-12-02 13:40:13 I have myself, I don't want jeuse as a teammate im going solo
general 2020-12-02 13:40:27 oh yeah right black sun
general 2020-12-02 13:40:36 toss a black sun on 'nam
general 2020-12-02 13:40:51 but geneva ~~suggestion~~ convention forbids that
general 2020-12-02 13:41:29 swiss don't know shit about war, they've been neutral the whole time, don't listen to em
general 2020-12-02 13:41:39 just drop a black sun when you feel like it
general 2020-12-02 13:42:37 main reason why the f-4 failed : the aircraft's armament was terrible at it's time, pilots were hella reliant on missiles and they were undertrained af
general 2020-12-02 13:42:45 this is why TOPGUN was created
general 2020-12-02 13:42:59 to teach pilots that you simply don't overuse missiles
general 2020-12-02 13:43:04 and heavy
general 2020-12-02 13:43:16 thus betraying maneuverability
general 2020-12-02 13:43:53 they had better aircrafts in the arsenal, **No**, they want to fuckin' test their fancy new plastic f-4
general 2020-12-02 13:44:14 send the sea demons and the f-100d and the outcome would be a whole lotta different
general 2020-12-02 13:44:38 engine failure mostly
general 2020-12-02 13:44:49 improved f-100d
general 2020-12-02 13:44:54 send em to the front
general 2020-12-02 13:45:07 the outcome would be drastically different, i expect.
general 2020-12-02 13:45:23 MIG-21 is no match for the f-4
general 2020-12-02 13:45:29 f-104 hot
general 2020-12-02 13:45:44 YET THEY STILL LOST THE WAR

general 2020-12-02 13:45:57 hol' up
general 2020-12-02 13:46:07 I know
general 2020-12-02 13:46:34 they didn't have thrust vector at the time
general 2020-12-02 13:47:48 I checked and the F-4 is also 3rd gen
general 2020-12-02 13:48:30 ok so if sea demon fail, buy export japanese EJs or Mirage III, send them and america would probably win
general 2020-12-02 13:48:42 F-4E ?
general 2020-12-02 13:48:50 aight 'hol up
general 2020-12-02 13:49:08 nope, it's still 3rd gen
general 2020-12-02 13:49:38 4th gen would be f-14, f-16, panavia tornado, mirage IV and all that shit
general 2020-12-02 13:51:45 A6 prototype did had 2d thrust vector tho, but it never went to use for some reason
general 2020-12-02 13:52:01 expensive ?

plane-crazy 2020-12-03 12:45:27 I mostly just make small boats with no folds
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 12:46:05 I've once made a 3-fold but I realized it wasn't centered, looks ass and would have a tendency to capsize alot
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 12:50:10 if it can kill
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 12:50:14 then it is a good turret.

plane-crazy 2020-12-03 13:47:14 this guy doesn't care about the difficulty, adds full flaps control and 3d thrust vector with perfect balance
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 13:49:21 I may occasionally add 3d thrust vector to my pl0ne but full flap controls ?
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 13:49:34 that means supermaneuverability then

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 12:11:30 a no-ranker in creation feedback ( aka creations chat's 2nd form ) tryna say that my wings are apparently " unproportional " to the fuselage
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 12:12:07 if it was disproportional, would it fly balanced then ?
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 12:12:34 and it is near-impossible to make something disproportionate on the lateral axis of the aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 12:12:50 best to ignore his contribution

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 13:54:32 he'll never be at napoleon's level, and I bet no one will be unless he is the 3rd and final antechrist
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 13:55:13 we've got 2 we dealt with, the 3rd one better be epic final boss battle
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 13:55:27 cesar, easily got ambushed and backstabbed by his allies
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 13:56:05 napoleon got his servitor snitch on personal info and plans that he has to the british and gets rekt in waterloo.
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 13:57:54 this guy

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 13:58:26 no one will ever get to his level unless he's the 3rd and final antechrist
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 13:59:02 we've got 2, now we need the 3rd then apparently the devs said there will be happiness and luck buffed for all of us by 1000% forever
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 13:59:59 antechrist : when a player becomes the top and then turns VERY EVIL ( and conquers alot of territory while doing a shit ton of PVP with his cronies )

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 14:00:48 plus, before the " 44 tips and trick on how to epic pvp " appeared
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 14:01:12 he was probably the best pvper but he commited game over because people eventually got enough of his shit
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 14:01:48 sun tzu, player with intelligence 300 makes " 44 tips and trick on how to epic pvp "
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 14:01:59 influenced the playerbase alot

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 14:04:32 there has been only 1 christ in the world and he commited ebic ascension
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 14:04:46 he's still in the menu screen tryna choose which ability suits best

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 14:05:22 when he comes back he promises luck and happiness buff too for 1000 year
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 14:05:43 I don't trust him he's probably a haxor
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 14:06:11 he got cross'd because he tryna do oober clan magician trick on the guillible players but then he respawned
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 14:06:24 if he come back he's probably gonne trigger 3rd impact smhsmh

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 14:16:00 so how hard can it be to implement it if the chains of the hard-coded game is now broken

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 14:19:35 hard code : plz don't add any line of code because I have a terrible allerg- **SEIZURE**
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 14:19:58 softcode : feel free to add more codes, the more, the better ! <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 14:20:39 hard code : add a line of code, something will break somewhere
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 14:21:04 softcode assumes the information is flexible so you can add any lines of codes and you generally won't encounter problems or so

plane-crazy 2020-12-05 02:22:18 autism is either being mute without being mute or being a total idiot
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 02:22:33 no i've seen it
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 02:22:50 it's either absolute PCC-style idiocy or being mute without being mute

plane-crazy 2020-12-05 02:30:49 better tactic is to silence and build in inner peace
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 02:31:01 seeing how much my statement gives brain damage to people

help 2020-12-05 04:11:08 realistic steering eh'
help 2020-12-05 04:11:27 the motor2 is oober clan and will shake when you add a motor and a wheel
help 2020-12-05 04:11:36 for this, you need an anti-shake mechanism
help 2020-12-05 04:12:49 there is 2 options for anti-shake mechanism for realistic steering
help 2020-12-05 04:14:05 the rope option
help 2020-12-05 04:14:13 you put em in the part that turns the wheel
help 2020-12-05 04:14:24 you tighten them and they'll stop shaking immediatly
help 2020-12-05 04:14:30 the most efficient option but not really compact
help 2020-12-05 04:16:03 2nd option, suspension anti-shake
help 2020-12-05 04:16:12 suspension absorbs the shock of the shaking
help 2020-12-05 04:16:23 compact, decent but not as efficient as ropes
help 2020-12-05 04:16:28 ropes stops completely
help 2020-12-05 04:16:55 the springs doesn't stop completely, the wheels will still shake a tad bit

plane-crazy 2020-12-05 13:57:14 for some reason, some people understand motorlock like they understand themselves  and some people have absolute knowledge of it without literally following a single tutorial, they just look at motorlock and immediately understood how it works.
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 13:57:16 weird
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 13:58:08 glad i got designer IV before they buffed it

plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:00:56 maybe
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:01:14 but it can be benificial if used correctly
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:01:40 hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:01:52 you shouldn't have locked it like that
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:02:11 just like kad who predicted what I was about to say, use camera blocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:02:41 actually let's see what he'll predict for 2021 that'll be fun
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:03:51 don't mind him he's mentally deficient
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:04:00 let him be

plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:05:06 the bigger, the less cramped
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:05:21 I made pvp fighter, and the motorlock for it was a pain to make
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:06:23 thick after burners ?

plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:10:28 blue flame as they call it
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:11:09 yeah you should remove the locc and replace with camera invisible blocks instead
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:11:21 or if this is a custom, place the engine there
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:11:24 <:PogStare:699130318510227537>
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:12:26 there is no camera lock needed
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:12:32 camera blocks become invisible
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:13:42 just place them like you place a block
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:13:50 it becomes invisible when you spawn

plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:37:10 ah yes pcc " helping " other people
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:37:23 leave this to me
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:40:09 <@!527092191189925918> this is how cameras can be used as an invisible block to fill in a gap
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:40:20 
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:40:49 
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:40:57 same thing but the blocks are replaced with cameras
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:41:10 bam.
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:42:06 a-10 super overrated
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:42:27 even tho it should be looked down upon as the worst plane in the US airforce inventory
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:42:55 not to me tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:43:07 it's an overhyped and overrated piece of shit  I dare say
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:43:25 I scold it because it's only stuck to do one role : attack the ground
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:44:33 it has no armor, is built around a gun ( and took 4 years to figure out how to not make the recoil affect flight ), it can easily get knocked down by a coward hiding in the ground with an rpg
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:44:48 and ground attack role ain't supreme
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:45:00 it doesn't go supersonic and can only fire it's guns to defend itself
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:45:18 classic american propaganda lies
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:45:34 it has no armor, an rpg hit and it's guaranteed you die.
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:46:01 no armors
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:46:30 heri believes american propaganda lies ok let's not mind him
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:46:51 it has no armor and a hit from a guided projectile means instant crash
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:47:10 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:47:16 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:47:43 a-10 very scoldable plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:47:47 😎 👍
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:48:08 flares aren't an option
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:48:15 and you believe american lies
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:48:18 😎
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:48:30 yeah it can't engage in an actual fight
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:48:54 and it ain't supreme as a role
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:49:10 the only part where heri is right about himself
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:49:19 mayb
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:50:08 a-10, simply the trash aircraft the airforce uses as a meat shield to deplete uranium elsewhere in a battlefield to support troops
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:50:23 I mean you ain't gonna use the F-22 to shoot some bullets on the ground tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:50:37 all it does is ground attack and it can't do anything else
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:50:42 escort is no option
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:50:47 auxiliarity is no option
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:50:58 you're right about that
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:51:21 but it isn't shit because it actually as a good role
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:51:47 instead of making new aircraft for a measly mediocre role
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:51:52 just modify one
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:51:56 less expensive
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:52:03 and less scoldable
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:52:17 I acknowledge that but it's still a shit plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:52:36 exceptionally tough
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:52:46 sounds like buzzfeed-style american lies to me
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:52:58 nope
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:53:10 you shut up yourself <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:53:34 a-10 has the manual control thing when electronic no work
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:53:56 so then it can glide itself back to base only using your muscles to control the plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:54:08 I make fun of all of you <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:54:23 a-10 shit plane change my mind
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:54:36 you mean the A-10
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:54:46 one bullet and it's either a glide or you plummet
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:55:15 i acknowledge that other jets have no armor
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:55:30 and what makes you say that im only assuming that the A-10 has no armor
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:55:43 most jet planes have no armor
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:55:50 for some reason
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:56:03 no, that's the frogfoot
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:56:08 flying tank basically
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:56:15 atleast this guy can do more than one role <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:56:30 literally the least resistant of all fighter jets
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:56:47 ok I see
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:57:03 atleast kad is smart enough to stop instigating
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:57:06 he smart
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:57:26 a-10 is just as shitty as the F-4, super scoldable
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:58:02 meatshield planes tactic simply doesn't work, america.
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:58:17 first it was the F-4, now it's the A-10
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:58:38 atleast the F-4 could do more than one role and has some better aspect than the A-10
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:58:44 it is no wonder why they call it
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:58:48 *the warthog*
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:59:14 PCC being smart and go silence
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:59:18 good
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:59:20 very good
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:59:22 excellent
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:59:28 PCC being smarter now
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:59:42 silencing when there is argument
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:59:45 outstanding move
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 14:59:53 nothing ok move
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:00:06 frogfoot role is only cas ?
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:00:07 e h
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:00:22 they said it was more than a CAS
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:00:55 remove P
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:00:59 oober clan
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:01:03 😎 👍
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:01:39 su-25 is the russian A-10 but less scoldable
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:02:11 there has been cases with this engaging in normal aerial fights and escort missions tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:02:20 but if it's only cas then it's also shit
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:03:55 I mean I can scold bombers that actually were bad tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:04:38 dedicated bomber aircraft were kinda inefficient
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:05:25 they kept the B-52 because it actually goes faster than most bombers and it's the only aircraft capable of carrying such payloads
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:05:45 and I never said that B-52 was shit, only that dedicated bombers were inefficient
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:05:52 so ?
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:05:59 yeah it is
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:06:01 so
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:06:21 *most*
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:06:32 heri being mentally deficient part 2139485784
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:06:38 yes they are
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:06:58 no
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:07:04 that was only the teaser
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:07:08 😎
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:07:20 mhm
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:07:46 there should be more fighter / bomber or multirole
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:07:48 that way
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:07:51 more efficient
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:08:02 what
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:08:13 sr-71
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:08:38 cas is not a good role to be, it's just you hugging the ground and depleting some lead
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:09:05 english electric has no afterburners yet it goes to mach 2
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:09:23 but it is still a shit role to have for an aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:10:04 air superiority is a good role to get and isn't shit like CAS
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:10:14 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:10:19 that's if you get one
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:11:23 CAS : hug ground and deplete uranium, oh wait is that a missile on my 6 ? i'll just pop the flares, hol' up I depleted all my flares, well shit time to plummet to my death
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:11:52 air superiority : he fly but he atac other plan
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:12:10 and no crash liek oober cas
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:12:24 and gets shot down.
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:12:29 just make a multirole
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:12:33 it's better that way
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:12:42 escort flight yes sure
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:12:56 that adds up money cost
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:13:36 soil compactors
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:14:23 
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:15:02 having a job like this exposed outside to the burning sun is tough
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:15:09 anyone who takes that job is a badass
plane-crazy 2020-12-05 15:15:36 yea but does it filter the sun's uv and heat ?

general 2020-12-06 08:14:29 if it's exposed motorlock that is like, everywhere or instantly noticeable then I don't upvote or downvote
general 2020-12-06 08:14:43 coz the build itself looks good but the exposed motors tho
general 2020-12-06 08:14:58 nice
general 2020-12-06 08:15:52 motorlock or not I only care about the look
general 2020-12-06 08:16:06 eh, doesn't look too bad to me
general 2020-12-06 08:16:36 jeuse
general 2020-12-06 08:16:50 motorlock isn't needed to make a build look good

general 2020-12-07 12:43:50 it already is
general 2020-12-07 12:44:06 virtual youtubers eh
general 2020-12-07 12:44:09 I heard of that
general 2020-12-07 12:44:30 just using a virtual character as a means of escapism for the viewers
general 2020-12-07 12:44:44 im surprised at how effective that shit became
general 2020-12-07 12:45:01 I mean, if you're hiding yourself, then it's fine
general 2020-12-07 12:45:08 but if you're doing that just for views
general 2020-12-07 12:45:11 e h
general 2020-12-07 12:45:19 but if you're doing both, now it's tangled
general 2020-12-07 12:45:45 m
general 2020-12-07 12:46:13 I don't hate anime, I just fucking hate the people who throw shit at eachother over it
general 2020-12-07 12:47:21 every anime profile picture I've met, all of them are just douchebags who will go on a verbal rage when someone wisp an opinion contradictory to their thinkings.
general 2020-12-07 12:47:40 there ARE some anime pfp i've met who are really wholesome and nice but most of them are like that.
general 2020-12-07 12:47:52 if it's pretty and you like it ?
general 2020-12-07 12:48:04 TRUE <:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>
general 2020-12-07 12:48:42 we all have a bit of fear of negative evaluation
general 2020-12-07 12:48:49 from others.
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 12:49:44 ok so, in a shellnut, hardcoding is bad and inefficient because when you implement a new feature / line of code, somewhere in that scripting mess, something's gonna break
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 12:50:04 softcoding is the complete opposite, the more you add, the better, it's the best way to code a game
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 12:50:58 but I don't know the difference of difficulty between these 2 codes so I assume rick just hard-coded the game maybe because it was easier ? but then realized it was a huge mistake taking that shortcut, and now he's apparently re-coding the game into soft
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 12:51:31 maddatack only did the map I think
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 12:51:37 what an oober clan
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 12:53:05 from my teacher's point of view : Hard Code : you write a logical suite of program one by one, it's like not adding the " Repeat Indefinitely " button in scratch, instead you code each lines one by one instead of making the action repeat by how many times you wish
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 12:53:08 but e h
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 12:53:16 I think it's way more complicated than that
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 12:53:53 I heard that mad only did the maps for most of his games, Rojilok scripted the rest.
general 2020-12-07 12:55:04 agree
general 2020-12-07 12:55:41 if anime, is fanaticized too much ( cough, anime pfp throwing shit at eachother for not having the same opinion ) then it is bad.
general 2020-12-07 12:56:42 bravo, good job anime pfps, now people despite anime because of you, you bastardized your very own source of entertainment by your attitude and ego, look where that got you now.
general 2020-12-07 12:57:25 now that we see an anime pfp, we're all *prejudicelially* saying in our heads " *what a fuckin' douche* "
general 2020-12-07 12:58:00 I have met some anime pfp who were actual, civilized, wholesome and nice people but these are only a minority
general 2020-12-07 12:58:13 kinda saddens me really
general 2020-12-07 12:58:39 eh I don't mind that
general 2020-12-07 12:59:41 same thing for furries : ***dudes dresses in literal, disgusting anthropomorphic animal suit and goes to a parade with others of their kinds***
general 2020-12-07 13:00:21 it's like they're saying in itself " bro humanity sucks, time to be an animal that looks and acts like a human "
general 2020-12-07 13:00:56 just fucking accept humanity, don't use means of escapism that's ironically the same thing just for being a bliss ignorance
general 2020-12-07 13:01:06 damn now im being too brutally realist

general 2020-12-07 13:03:08 flat earthers are just people with zero to no common sense
general 2020-12-07 13:03:10 if the earth was flat
general 2020-12-07 13:03:20 WHY HASN'T ANYONE FALLEN OFF THE EDGE YET ?
general 2020-12-07 13:03:56 the only people I allow myself to have a verbal rage on, are people like these
general 2020-12-07 13:04:08 those who doesn't wanna look at even the smallest picture
general 2020-12-07 13:04:28 " there is no worst type of blind people than those who doesn't wanna see "
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 13:04:49 can't remember the name clearly but it's a friend / dev of his ?
general 2020-12-07 13:05:00 yep
general 2020-12-07 13:06:12 yep
general 2020-12-07 13:06:21 how
general 2020-12-07 13:06:23 just how
general 2020-12-07 13:06:39 if it was flat, why aren't there pics of it
general 2020-12-07 13:06:49 and why hasn't anyone fallen off the edge yet ?
general 2020-12-07 13:07:45 <:holup:644606306870886440>
general 2020-12-07 13:08:53 l m a o
general 2020-12-07 13:09:06 if it was flat and it spun like that so much it looks round
general 2020-12-07 13:09:13 why isn't anyone flattened like a pancake yet ?
general 2020-12-07 13:11:46 man I wish I could have twitter and roast the FES extremely badly
general 2020-12-07 13:12:10 I mean anyone could kekw
general 2020-12-07 13:18:30 
general 2020-12-07 13:19:05 **hmm**
general 2020-12-07 13:19:16 copied su-57 and f-22 into one ?
general 2020-12-07 13:19:28 kekw
general 2020-12-07 13:20:21 
general 2020-12-07 13:20:28 fc-31
general 2020-12-07 13:20:40 literally looks like a copypast of the XF-22
general 2020-12-07 13:20:53 and they say " it's as flawed as the old f-4 "
general 2020-12-07 13:21:07 if they actually meant that shit
general 2020-12-07 13:21:37 then I bet 2 dollars they can't even win a dogfight with the F-16
general 2020-12-07 13:22:31 I heard the other day that thai pilot got a lock on a J-20 with an export gripen
general 2020-12-07 13:22:38 L F M A O
general 2020-12-07 13:22:54 gripen is 4th gen plus it's export against a J-20
general 2020-12-07 13:23:12 export means it's generally lower-grade than the actual non-export stock version itself
general 2020-12-07 13:24:11 if they can't even go up against a plane with a generation lower than they are, then all I can say is
general 2020-12-07 13:24:24 **their planes are made in china, that's why**
general 2020-12-07 13:24:27 😎
general 2020-12-07 13:25:34 why does some jet planes lack good images of them
general 2020-12-07 13:26:06 tu-28 doesn't have a good shot of it, only some old photos or displays of it in museums
general 2020-12-07 13:26:34 now all I can do is copy it from a blueprint
general 2020-12-07 13:27:50 hol' up
general 2020-12-07 13:27:54 h o l y s h i t
general 2020-12-07 13:28:19 it's official lesser-known name has more images than the more known and semi-official name that everyone uses
general 2020-12-07 13:28:25 tu-128
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 13:58:34 I think it's worth a shot
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 13:58:37 dew it
plane-crazy 2020-12-07 13:58:47 but the cockpit part I think will be pretty hard to deal with
