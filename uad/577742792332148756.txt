bug-reports 2021-04-08 16:44:02 If you are using a camera and you jump out of your seat you view is now following the camera as if you character was there
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 16:52:07 it is subjective
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 16:52:29 depends how big your gonna make it
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 16:53:03 for avatar scale, that is far too big
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 16:54:37 do you want them to fold or just have that bent shape?
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 16:57:09 if you just want the bent shape there is a method called camera locking, that should work for what you want
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 16:59:33 well how are you going to continue the shape along the sides, it will look wierd
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 16:59:51 and that cocpit seems very far forwards to me

plane-crazy 2021-04-08 17:26:21 it is very hard to look at, hard to differentiat between the different features
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 17:27:24 yeah, a new paint job would make it look a lot cooler as you could see each of the different parts
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 17:28:43 k, I see why you don't want to change the colours, they do look cool
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 17:29:09 but even if you just made the cannon a lighter shade of cammo
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 17:29:44 ye iit would stand out more and so u could see the cannon better

general 2021-05-17 13:15:40 Goocci, if you look at roblox's account there are 5 gucci avatar items that have no description and aren't on sale so I think it has a pretty high chance to be an event
general 2021-05-17 13:18:12 but can't you say the word "gay" without being homophobic though?
general 2021-05-17 13:19:36 lol

general 2022-01-03 18:15:32 yeah but they obviously don't have that much experience, and helium is easy
general 2022-01-03 18:16:16 don't use helium in anything with wings
general 2022-01-03 18:16:37 nothing that gets any lift from wings should have helium, then it really gets stuffed up
general 2022-01-03 18:17:15 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2022-01-03 18:18:03 but for something that would float like a zeppelin or a blimp would, or a 0 g spaceship that wants to stay upright then helium is perfect
general 2022-01-03 18:18:31 previously combatatant 2?
general 2022-01-03 18:19:37 by that what do you mean? use ballast to counteract the lift from the balloons so that it has a stable altitude or using ballasts at the bottom of the build to keep it upright?
general 2022-01-03 18:20:28 it will get bigger plots won't it?
general 2022-01-03 18:20:41 yes
general 2022-01-03 18:21:27 yeah, but keeping it upright can also be done by locating all of the helium at the top fo the build anyway
bot-central 2022-01-03 18:22:15 you failed too
general 2022-01-03 18:22:52 yes
general 2022-01-03 18:23:30 helium is no skill, so using it doesn't prove anything, but it is nice and simple for a large-enough build that has the room

plane-crazy 2022-01-03 18:33:10 wooohooo
general 2022-01-03 18:34:06 you replace enough blocks on the top of your build, or place enough if there is room, so that it starts to float up
general 2022-01-03 18:35:01 then you add a few ballast blocks to the bottom and slowly increase their density until the build doesn't float up or down (normally you want slightly negatively boyant (slightly going down))
general 2022-01-03 18:36:17 you make sure that the ballast is right at the bottom, and the heliums is all at the top, so that when the helium creats an upward force it pulls the top of your build up higher so it is always level, and the wieght of the ballast always pulls the bottom of the build down
general 2022-01-03 18:36:40 cool
general 2022-01-03 18:37:05 they know

creations-chat 2022-02-02 06:41:13 but, deep inside plot number 10, the furthest away from anywhere, arises a new faction: THE DEFAULT faction.  They do not have the appearance or invisible potential of the two glass factions, but they are far tougher, designed for war, they have to hide in the shadows so that they don't get swarmed by glass shredder bugs. They sneak around, destroying strategic locations, like dropping anchor blocks with "Never gonna give you up" radio's attatched to them.

(PC lore part 2 add on more)
creations-chat 2022-02-02 06:57:04 But if only the metal faction had known; in those cities lay a dormant creation, unused since the end of PC1, an ancient creation, still existing in save number 512 of a DEFAULT factions members... A lag machine, as the motor=-locked bomb hits the city it destroys the containment facility for the lag machine, unleashing it upon the world. and the bomber crew can only watch in horror as a knot of ropes, parachutes and springs grow in size from the centre of the city. they see their plane slow down and eventually stop, not continuing forwards, they can't escape it's wrath.

events-chat 2022-02-10 08:28:38 or are those photos just suggestions for what you could build?
events-chat 2022-02-10 08:31:43 but can you build any shape plane you want that matches one of the configurations?

events-chat 2022-02-10 10:02:09 are downwards facing weapons allowed where it doesn't specifically say downards facing?
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:02:56 alr thanks
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:03:23 and are v-tols allowed?
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:03:54 yep, just rotating the engines using motors
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:04:55 yes but hovering
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:15:36 the yousuf is pretty much a helicopter anyway
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:15:57 slow moving, downward facing weapons, and a turret
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:16:53 are you allowed to build one from scratch that fits the perameters?
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:17:11 ok
events-chat 2022-02-10 10:19:46 and can you have a mix of the optional weapons? like one rocket and one firework
general 2022-02-12 00:42:19 ..
events-chat 2022-02-15 09:12:14 Ok, Defenders have to stay within range of their carrier, the Yousuf can fly slow, especially with modifications (I got it flying as slow as 27), and the Yousuf has a turret, which means it could go really really slow and just shoot the enemy carrier with the turret from outside the defenders range. 

But of course this would displease the almighty gods of PCC, and wouldn't be allowed
events-chat 2022-02-15 09:15:53 .



another genius thought...

There is no rules stating you can't take one of the yousuf's propeller's and strap it to the explosives, making a missile
events-chat 2022-02-15 09:17:45 .


and, then again, you could take the mounted turret on the yousuf and attach it to the missile, then remove the bomb, or add the bombs to disconnectors, making a yousuf, in the yousuf, that is disconnected from the yousuf
events-chat 2022-02-15 09:18:25 or 6 if you really wanted to, one for each propeller
events-chat 2022-02-15 09:19:02 same with the doof, that has 2 props, double doof
events-chat 2022-02-15 09:20:03 🧠 📈
events-chat 2022-02-15 09:23:58 ok, the final idea, make a 360 degree thrust vectoring on the yousuf props, and rotate them to face upwards, so the yousuf hovers like a rocket does, then using rockets underneath it, tilt the yousuf around to aim... now it has become a giant sky turret with rockets!
events-chat 2022-02-16 07:47:41 I have had another stroke of genius, anchor blocks aren't banned... 

So, attach your plane onto an anchor block using motor2 and you instantly have a sky turret from any plane that is anchored in place
events-chat 2022-02-16 07:48:16 and nor is helium banned
events-chat 2022-02-16 07:48:35 you could just "modify" a plane to become a zeppelin
events-chat 2022-02-16 08:50:27 👍
events-chat 2022-02-16 09:10:56 fun fact: that is an estimate of the max speed not a rule for the max speed
and if it was a rule then why would it be between two numbers? why not just one number stating the max speed
and why have any amount of max engines at all, why not just limit people to the speed that they can have with that build and then the engines are decided by them

and also if I misunderstood your message and you were talking about it as an estimate then why did you say that?
events-chat 2022-02-16 10:57:02 ok
events-chat 2022-02-16 10:59:29 you can delete it if you are going to
events-chat 2022-02-16 10:59:49 I understand why you dislike the build, it is not in the theme of the event
events-chat 2022-02-16 22:11:16 A serious question; when in the rules it says no motor-lock, is that no motor-locks only for pulling motors in by half a block or no motor-lock at all?

Is it allowed to have a powered locked motor that has been rotated so that it isn't pulled in by half a block?
events-chat 2022-02-16 22:24:58 ok thanks

events-chat 2022-02-20 03:07:53 wdym?
events-chat 2022-02-20 03:08:41 ok I was kinda thinking like a 10 minute build time to build something then you battle, which would be cool, but that idea doesn't seem good
events-chat 2022-02-20 03:11:55 I have an idea for an event, but I don't know how much this will be liked

Sailboat races, you build a tiller steering sailboat (like these two: https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/944457767647854603 and https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/944044368065605642)
then you have to do laps around the water area; weaving in between the jumps, and just going around, and whoever gets to the end first wins
capped speed to, so the main part of it is being good at steering the boat and having a good steering boat.
events-chat 2022-02-20 03:18:13 space ship battles, 0 gravity planes pretty much
events-chat 2022-02-20 03:18:55 I want sailboat races
events-chat 2022-02-20 03:19:17 you need a straight long path for that, and sadly that doesn't exist

events-chat 2022-02-20 03:21:05 how would you abduct cows?
events-chat 2022-02-20 03:22:01 plane crazy doesn't like interactions between two seperate player's builds
events-chat 2022-02-20 03:22:45 either it is just an event about pushing the other opponent or it is a car battle, that is what the cow battles would be
events-chat 2022-02-20 03:23:41 kinda
events-chat 2022-02-20 03:24:09 just an airship battle but with weird builds
events-chat 2022-02-20 03:25:03 that is just dum
events-chat 2022-02-20 03:26:14 ok, so each player has a few explosive blocks on it, and I imagine if it is a cow battle then you would only ram the opponent once, so they would all go off at once

then what if you don't destroy the opponent in your one go?

plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:55:10 alright, I know you probably won't ever care about what I have to say, but...
each type of weapon has a cost, and you have a maximum amount of points you can spend on weapons in the event
like 
gun = 1
rocket = 3
cutter = 0.2

and a max of 10 points or whatever
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:56:48 well it is better than just having a hard cap for each weapon so that everyone uses the same weapon setup
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:57:43 the same weapon setup has 0 creativity in it, and also, it can take some skill to find a good setup, because it should be well balanced
plane-crazy 2022-02-20 23:58:36 nobody would have the same shit because there is a point system rather than a hard cap and I am talking about just the event btw, not teh entirety of plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-02-21 00:01:03 I mean just this event

general 2022-02-21 00:54:40 12.19, you suck
general 2022-02-21 00:55:37 2.94, both rbk and shepdog and I am imagine most of the mods have super low popularity rating (good)
general 2022-02-21 00:56:14 lower is better
general 2022-02-21 00:56:30 4.62
general 2022-02-21 00:56:31 is you
general 2022-02-21 00:56:40 I am 4.17
general 2022-02-21 00:56:52 yes
general 2022-02-21 00:57:06 but the mods have super high popularity ratings because they get pinged a lot
general 2022-02-21 00:57:44 worst possible is infinity, and the best possible is 0
general 2022-02-21 00:58:16 of everyone I have checked darkzified has the worst
general 2022-02-21 00:58:31 goodbye burning TF2 man
general 2022-02-21 00:59:32 rickje is a 6.14

events-chat 2022-02-21 01:45:44 test 2
events-chat 2022-02-21 06:39:24 is the airship event pretty much just the last event but zeppelins?
events-chat 2022-02-22 01:31:24 wings work better I find, just use a cross shape
general 2022-02-22 04:28:55 two
general 2022-02-22 04:29:46 yeah
general 2022-02-22 04:29:58 well I can't change it now
general 2022-02-22 04:30:07 what?
general 2022-02-22 04:30:18 oh, yeah I can do the 24 hour format
general 2022-02-22 04:30:25 or I can just fly around the world
general 2022-02-22 04:30:33 that would be easier
general 2022-02-22 04:31:13 cursed helicopter
events-chat 2022-02-24 02:05:25 as in pirate zeppelins or a seperate event or what?
events-chat 2022-02-24 02:28:52 yeah seems cool, I recon sailboat races would be good 
like I said before https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/752219509171028048/944793466364375061
events-chat 2022-02-24 02:30:30 yeah, that is what I thought when I came up with the races, most people in PCC much prefer the combat side of it
events-chat 2022-02-24 02:30:57 yeah
events-chat 2022-02-24 02:31:18 a sailboat i mean, with tiller steering, it is one of the examples I had in that message
events-chat 2022-02-24 03:42:15 I had to go for an hour but, this is how the tiller steering works https://streamable.com/7dq5fb

events-chat 2022-02-24 03:51:47 I didn't make the smaller ship, only the larger one and I did the wires with angle-lock and I imagine that the smaller ship's creator did the same thing

plane-crazy 2022-02-26 04:01:12 needs more stuff, like add signs and text and little pattern things all around it, like a star wars ship
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 04:07:52 add ladders flush with the wall just for little textures, and add the numbers on it using text
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 04:25:01 <@!668314196764655618> reupload your car, you can't upvote it, that is why it has a bad ratio
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 04:25:45 yeah it does, but make the  blue parts default
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 04:25:55 also still add extra details
creations-chat 2022-02-26 04:29:27 it is also something to be muted for
creations-chat 2022-02-26 04:32:24 you may want to take that down anyway, the mods are muting anyone who speaks about Rush hour and Your Crane. although I am not sure if they will do it with that build, sinc it isn't really talking about it
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 04:48:00 cool, lets see a larger image

general 2022-02-26 19:20:24 we have the answer bois, the official release date for PC2!!!
general 2022-02-26 19:20:54 I recon they should leave camlock as it is, it is useful, just make it save
general 2022-02-26 19:21:30 but why?
general 2022-02-26 19:23:01 but you have to reset it every time you spawn, and then you have to get it perfect every single time
general 2022-02-26 19:23:25 noooo, you just don't understand how good it is
general 2022-02-26 19:23:43 but you don't need to have that, because the block is already there with camlock
general 2022-02-26 19:25:07 I only watched 1 tutorial for plane crazy
general 2022-02-26 19:25:23 and I regret it
general 2022-02-26 19:26:38 all my friends are dodo water at building games, they hate playing plane crazy or besiege or any other game of the sorts
general 2022-02-26 19:27:53 and then they talk about FPS games and saying about how the like how much customisation it has... like wtf is a building game but pure customisation (unless you follow a tutorial)
general 2022-02-26 19:28:55 🗿🗿🗿
general 2022-02-26 19:30:13 for all messages, actually just have the bot add upvote downvote and unlock reactions so that anyone can add them (not really people were toxic enough with the battlebots reactions, don't do that)
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:33:07 iel
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 19:33:37 I thought that was a different roblox game for a while

general 2022-02-27 14:29:09 102.64.147.217?
general 2022-02-27 14:31:57 If I get it you  have to tell me

Guesses = [000.000.000.000, 000.000.000.001, 000.000.000.002, 000.000.000.003, 000.000.000.004 . . . 999.999.999.999] 

that is series notation for an infinite list of all possible IP's
general 2022-02-27 14:33:09 there, it has to be in one of my guesses
general 2022-02-27 14:34:06 then your IP adress doesn't exist, because I just made a list of all possible IP adresses and yours isn't in there?
general 2022-02-27 14:35:36 the three dots at the end indicate an infinite series, which means it is all possible IP adresses, therefore I have guessed your IP
general 2022-02-27 14:36:37 LETS GO, I JUST SCAMMED HIM, TIME TO SHARE HIS IP ALL OVER THE INTERNET
general 2022-02-27 14:36:54 hecker
general 2022-02-27 14:39:26 they may but that series still includes all possibilites anyway, it may include things that aren't an IP but it does have all things that are an IP, so all possible IP's are a subset of my guesses.

general 2022-02-27 14:42:26 ekronoplans are a boat that does a fancy aerodynamics and kinda flies but can't really fly only at super low altitudes when they are just meters above the surface.
general 2022-02-27 14:43:11 antonov-A40, I have always suggested this, and scrapman recently made a video about it in trailmakers

plane-crazy 2022-02-27 15:00:54 distraction
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:09:58 why thrust vectoring? why not just stand-alone propellers? with thrust vectoring you loose a lot of manouverability at lower speeds
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:14:07 very good
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:15:06 ok
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:15:54 got it, and what is the point of the folding wings too?
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:17:45 your thrust is probably way below your mass, causing an upwards pitch
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:18:02 that is a rocket
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:18:50 if your centre of thrust is way below your centre of mass then move up your centre of thrust, either add more thrusters higher up, or move your current ones further up.
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:19:18 you don't

you have to figure it out
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:19:36 is it above or below the center of mass?

or center of lift
plane-crazy 2022-02-28 02:20:15 then addd another thrusters higher up, or move that one up.

help 2022-03-01 08:50:44 ^yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 09:04:19 who was it that made that grey and yellow ultra-agile jet (didn't look like a normal fighter jet) that looked like a cruise missile, I want to find it again for a reference
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 09:04:30 I would like to build something somewhat similar, I quite liked the way it looked
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 09:05:00 do you know what I am talking about?
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 09:05:48 it was in <#384025409945337856>

plane-crazy 2022-03-02 09:07:46 c
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 09:08:40 I asked because I was bored, and you said you didn't even want new members
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 09:09:45 do ocean camo <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 09:10:09 ocean camo, really helpful (for a tank)
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 09:10:48 not me
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 09:10:48 ask google about that
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 09:11:16 it is camouflage, so a plane can hide in the over, OCEAN CAMO
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 09:11:56 why the fuck is there sky camo ontop of a plane, where people see the ocean or ground below it, and why is the bottom of the plane grey?
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 09:12:23 some of them have ocean camo on the bottom too nvm, but still
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 09:13:30 also, now that there are more people, does anyone remember who made the grey and yellow fighter jet that looked like a cruise missile?
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 09:14:56 I want to find it in <#384025409945337856>  I can't find the pic
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 09:19:06 so you lied to me, you just hated my build, it wasn't a number of members issue (cries in the corner)
plane-crazy 2022-03-02 09:20:33 alr

general 2022-03-23 10:18:43 train is best, nothing can outperform a train
general 2022-03-23 10:19:20 Nothing can compare to the glorious train
general 2022-03-23 10:20:03 already exists, all flight controllers for drones (recreational drones) are self flying
general 2022-03-23 10:20:23 that includes quadrocopters nad helicopters
general 2022-03-23 10:22:09 but TRAINS THO, way larger carry weight than anything else, way larger carry volume than anything else, good speed but way less fuel than a plane. The only thing that beats it is strength is a ship, but ships are too slow. therefore train, also you might talk about the limit of rails, but rails already exist everywhere and they are already self driving since they are on rails, just hit the GO button.

general 2022-03-25 13:13:14 no, I mean one side has a plane wing as the lif, the other side has no plane wing, just an upwards facing helicopter rotor as lift
general 2022-03-25 13:13:19 and a tail rotor on the back too
general 2022-03-25 13:13:43 not good enough

general 2022-03-25 13:26:42 silencers on each of the barrels?
general 2022-03-25 13:27:45 indeed
general 2022-03-25 13:28:31 I like it, it makes sense for what the plane does, although maybe just  a regular heli could fly as fast as a sesna
general 2022-03-25 13:28:50 it would be good for no-runway remote areas
general 2022-03-25 13:30:15 both people would have to control one section, and also it would have to move slowly because clipping at high speeds between clients, so maybe a big mining truck or giant blimp but I doubt much else
general 2022-03-25 13:30:33 or a giant submarine, and ship too
general 2022-03-25 13:30:40 as long as they go slow

general 2022-03-25 17:10:16 hey why isn't -servers working? I am just getting undefined, which would mean they had just been reset; have they just been reset?
general 2022-03-25 17:10:50 yeah I haven't been online for a few weeks
general 2022-03-25 17:11:04 did you make it yourself?
general 2022-03-25 17:11:28 smh, imagine  not making your pfp
general 2022-03-25 17:15:38 they would be too long, the savedata for a build is pretty large so a share code would either have to be a paragraph long or it links to something saved on the roblox servers (like how road to grambies did it) which would be hard to make, especially with how much savedata plane crazy already uses

creations-chat 2022-03-25 23:42:02 you physically can't downvote the Tiger-1 tank... that is why it is doing well

 MEME_LEGEND, that is a bad tank build, the barrel is waaay too wide for a light tank,and the shape is unrealistic, also those rollers are too big
general 2022-03-25 23:45:23 yes
general 2022-03-25 23:45:35 also answering your own tickets
general 2022-03-25 23:46:14 why do you need a rank soon anyway? It is normally only ~12 hours, it should have taken you longer than that to make the build (if you are getting expert)
general 2022-03-25 23:46:23 other than expert designerw
general 2022-03-25 23:46:29 I made a raft in 10 minutes and got that

general 2022-03-25 23:50:05 thanks
creations-chat 2022-03-25 23:52:58 rollers are the cylinders in the tread that the tread rolls around, and it seems that you have used wheel 2x2 2 for fake rollers, unless you are making it a wheeled vehicle in which case then it is fine.

Shape still matters, the design looks bad, unrealistic tank
the front shouldn't be flat it should curve down slightly and the turret should be further forwards

general 2022-03-25 23:53:48 yes I agree
general 2022-03-25 23:54:13 and yet it got 173 upvotes, with a score of 138
general 2022-03-25 23:54:57 *sniffs the funny white powder*
general 2022-03-25 23:55:46 acid - flacid, who cares
creations-chat 2022-03-25 23:58:05 not the front front, but the area infront of the turret is completely flat (horizontal), even the ebr has slopes going up to the turret. and if the turret is too far back for you to make a slope go back there then move it forwards https://thedailybounce.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WorldOfTanks_h202018-11-262013-41-08-28.png
creations-chat 2022-03-26 00:01:16 is it motorlocked?, then pull the turret forwards with motorlock
creations-chat 2022-03-26 00:07:01 it is glitched, this happens sometimes but most of the time it is for upvoting  (where you can't upvote), that guy just got reaaaally lucky, because that tank would be at about -50 if it wasn't glitched

to make a build that flies, not really
to understand motorlock, it is kinda hard but makes a lot more sense when you finally understand
to make a good pvp build, the guides make it easy as long as you understand motorlock

general 2022-03-28 05:47:24 skill issue
general 2022-03-28 05:49:00 I used to do programming a lot, I was pretty good and I did it as a subject because I was good at it. But all the marks come from writing about your code and nothing about the actual coding, and I am great at the coding part but the writing part I suck at.

so I don't do it as a subject anymore, although sometimes I make games for fun.
general 2022-03-28 05:49:20 I was saying why I hate the subject
general 2022-03-28 05:49:29 hey did you see what I sent before
general 2022-03-28 05:49:35 local INT = Instance.new("IntValue")
    INT.Name = "integer value"
    INT.Value = 10
    INT.Parent = workspace.part
general 2022-03-28 05:49:49 I know
general 2022-03-28 05:50:05 Like anybody here gives a fuck about anyone else here anyway
general 2022-03-28 05:50:29 what? all you wanted was to create an intvalue
general 2022-03-28 05:51:45 Username.varname.value = Username.varname.value + 1
general 2022-03-28 05:53:06 if you have a question about how something works just search up "name of the thing" and then roblox, the roblox development website is really well made especially compared to other programming languages so take advantage of it

general 2022-03-28 06:23:56 also make an entire language from scratch, not just an cipher... ciphers are lame and easy to make. go to this guy he knows his shit about conlangs (constructed languages)
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMjTcpv56G_W0FRIdPHBn4A?app=desktop
and this guy too
https://www.youtube.com/c/Artifexian
they make a lot of videos about languages and alien worlds and realistically constructed fiction
general 2022-03-28 06:25:45 they will make entire speaking systems and grammar and lexicons and all that such, it is really interestic but their videos can also help with just making a cipher

general 2022-03-28 06:55:12 on my image
general 2022-03-28 06:55:16 so I need to extend it
general 2022-03-28 06:55:19 idk how tho
general 2022-03-28 06:55:50 no
general 2022-03-28 06:55:57 it is minecraft enchanting table
general 2022-03-28 06:56:20 it isn't really (that is called galactic)
general 2022-03-28 06:59:05 the more I use it the more I agree with you, I mean, why is "Y" a line, normally the more common letters like the vowels would become smaller like a line, and not something like Y or V, and then E is so complicated to write and same as O, 4 lines is a lot and they all face the wrong direction too.

Because this cipher is based on english the writing direction is left to right, and as such the letters would go left to right (it is easier to write that way) and yet the letter O obviously has all 4 strokes going left. 

and how are those big circles created? because is it naturally written with a paintbrush like japanese? if so then the dots make sense but if it was scratched out of wood or written with a pencil then the dots are hard to make and would naturally evolve out of a language because of that
general 2022-03-28 06:59:11 wait still going
general 2022-03-28 07:00:24 I do the type
general 2022-03-28 07:05:04 can kinda see where you are coming from with the thick lines and all but gamillas is way to straight and on right angles, also the lines that it makes are all connected in gamillas while in Orenthinese (I am calling it that and nobody is gonna stop me) the lines are  commonly disconnected
general 2022-03-28 07:05:21 
general 2022-03-28 07:05:22 gamillas
general 2022-03-28 07:07:37 not really, it is way too hard to write quickly, similar to old english words. and this evolved out of the language when writing became a common skill, and I think that most gamillas can write (just based on my minimal research) especially since they are an interplanetary race in a scifi world
general 2022-03-28 07:08:01 that one was pretty short
general 2022-03-28 07:14:00 I believe that on discord I should stop typing long paragraphs. Firstly, while typing you are often interrupted by someone else who responds to something you are in the middle of saying, which completely ruins the point of typing in the first place. Secondly, long paragraphs are hard to type, they require more strain of your fingers are wear you out for longer, stopping you from typing further down the line when you may need to respond to people quickly. Furthermore while some may say it increases the strength of your argument it is completely useless if your argument is interrupted while you are still saying it. Finally it interrupts the rest of the chat, there may be people who are typing in small messages and if their small messages are interrupted by a larger message it can be very very annoying for them and who wants to be interrupted by a large paragraph. It is for these reasons why I am no longer going to be using large paragraphs on Discord.

Thank you...
general 2022-03-28 07:15:34 alright short typing time

general 2022-03-30 05:34:25 in the cipher?
general 2022-03-30 05:36:59 me when I sed "epic embed fail" after an embed of a GIF, most likely from "tenor" does not happen as such, a shorter word for "does not happen" is "fail". I used epic as it is a funny term used in "Meme Culture." I sed this give to point out your fault and allow you to re-send the GIF, now without error. the GIF is send is typically very short, only about 2 seconds of a looping video. one of the most popular ones used in the "epic embed fail" community is a clip from breaking bad, a television program from the TV network "AMC", or of a man dressed up as "The Joker " from DC Comics laughing and pointing at you for making such an error.

general 2022-04-02 03:40:07 the war thunder insect flies like a regular plane, so just make some motors that move trails (for the fake wings or use trapdoors) up and down then hide wings inside the build so that it flies like a normal plane

to make a proper ornithopter you can't make it look like that, it would be way to hard, you have to make the build around the wings not vica versa
general 2022-04-02 03:47:30 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/923151293067964456 I made this, it took a while but I only posted it because WistaraDim posted a horrible fake "bird wing" design that didn't actually work as a wing <:YouTried:559530066258821131>

general 2022-04-04 16:52:07 why did said trusted friend send the link to the doxxer?
general 2022-04-04 16:54:06 I think there may have been a miscommunication.

did the 16 year old have a close friend with whom they had shared their address, and that close friend sent it to someone who doxxed the 16 year old
OR
did the 16 year old become friends with someone and shared there address with them, then eventually they were doxxed by that someone?

creations-chat 2022-04-10 10:48:23 the gaming controller for a steering mechanism makes it seem like a space ship, otherwise I would say bomber due to the extra pannels on the side which would be watched by more people that bomber planes have, and (from my limited knowledge) cargo planes normally only have 2 people in the cocpit
creations-chat 2022-04-10 11:50:59 in bombers or cargo planes?

ok, cool, also I was thinking of a ww2 bomber

then both cargo and bomber would make sense

but spaceship just for the controller for steering

only cutters allowed
3 cutters per snake segment (you can remove a cutter from one segment and put it on another)
9 cutters allowed in the head (mouth)
all movement (thrusters) must be built into the  head and the first segment
No hover glitch allowed
your snake must be longer than 1 plot
your  snake's segments must be wider than 5 blocks
if you loose your snakes head you die
if you loose your snakes neck (first 2 segments) you die
Must look like a snake (preferably painted to look like an irl snake)
no flying

(I have been doing these same rules with a friend, and it is  fun)

how long is the entire body?
creations-chat 2022-04-23 11:09:49 how long is the body?

thanks
creations-chat 2022-04-23 11:13:13 Wow, ok... I did the maths and that wingspan is the exact ratio that it should be

well actually a little bit longer than it should be (it should be 26.267 blocks)

it does appear too short tho, so for anyone who hasn't realised it is the right length they will probably downvote

events-chat 2022-04-30 21:53:45 alr well can I just reskin it as endgame?
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:54:20 wait
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:54:38 how is this thing working? do people get a random bot or  does everyone choose their bot?
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:57:25 <@466793357318815744> can I join?
events-chat 2022-04-30 21:57:45 I checked
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:00:29 bombshell is a modular bot, it has lots of different weapons, so I think it would be allowed to use any of the weapons they have used... also <@466793357318815744> would bombshell be able to have multiple saves with different weapons since they are a modular bot that switches weapons anyway?
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:02:08 bombshell and weapons

(grabber, horizontal spinner, hammer, verticle spinner)
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:02:53 yep

I will take that
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:07:20 I am allowed to do fancy stuff to make the engine that the ice-wave uses?


ice in ice wave stands for Internal Combustion Engine, it uses a lawnmowere engine to power the spinner. so can I do something that makes an engine sort of effect?
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:08:21 or do I just have to use motors? like a lame person
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:08:43 🙂
events-chat 2022-04-30 22:10:16 do you have to keep the build size relative to the bot? or could minotaur become a build the size of mammoth?

events-chat 2022-04-30 22:59:33 do I have to make the same wheel setup as my bot? (icewave) since icewave's wheels are all hidden and I can't really figure out what setup it uses (although I think it is 4 wheels)
events-chat 2022-04-30 23:00:08 could even be 6
events-chat 2022-04-30 23:01:37 funny shit ever, but also super stupid
events-chat 2022-04-30 23:02:07 you think that my bot gets destroyed?
events-chat 2022-04-30 23:10:45 ... I will explain this

mauve had asked the question "what are you on?" intending it to be "what drugs are you on"

and you replied with mobile, which is taking the question in a different meaning, which I found funny because it is a stupid thing to have done

now I don't care that you are on mobile, I would have had the same  reaction if you said "laptop"
events-chat 2022-04-30 23:11:03 now stop talking about it
events-chat 2022-04-30 23:12:22 no, biteforce uses 4 wheels after season 1
events-chat 2022-04-30 23:12:48 when it wins 89% of its matches, you got so lucky with biteforce
events-chat 2022-04-30 23:13:24 💀
events-chat 2022-04-30 23:13:56 no, I made a biteforce build for the 1st battlebots tourny, I won almost every test battle that I did
events-chat 2022-04-30 23:14:22 not if you build it right, and if it spins fast enough
events-chat 2022-04-30 23:14:59 ok, I will take my biteforce build and verse ANY other battlebot within the rules, and I will thrash them

ANYONE
events-chat 2022-04-30 23:15:17 no
events-chat 2022-04-30 23:15:56 mine is smaller since it is 1st battlebot rules,  and I will still fight you

events-chat 2022-05-01 01:01:14 you have tombstone don't you?
events-chat 2022-05-01 01:01:31 cap
events-chat 2022-05-01 01:03:59 no

that definitely isn't because I have the largest horizontal spinner in the entirety of battlebots or anything
events-chat 2022-05-01 01:08:06 <@466793357318815744> I would agree, you should max out the tip speed of spinners, mine goes over 4,000 sps (4000fps (feet per second), or 2727 mph or MACH 2.2!)
the actual show maxes out tip speed to 250mph, but because of the increased scale maybe max it out to 2500mph or maybe 1000mph or even 500mph
events-chat 2022-05-01 01:08:43 icewave is bigger than sow

events-chat 2022-05-01 04:08:00 yes

I think so
events-chat 2022-05-01 04:08:38 but it is more about trying to jam up the opponents weapon by getting stuck in there with a small expendable bot
events-chat 2022-05-01 04:36:28 if more than half the weight of your bot is unable to move then you are out, that is the rules (I think) there was a team with 5 mini-bots, no main bots and if they lost 3 of there bots then they are all dead

events-chat 2022-05-02 11:18:40 but keep it relative to the size of the real bot
events-chat 2022-05-06 07:52:42 is the use of gears allowed? as in, you use a speed 40 power 5 motor, and you gear it up so that your weapon spins and the equivalent of a speed 200 power 1 motor?
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:26:34 I had 3 in mine and rbk told me to take it down to 1 motor, 5 torque
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:26:56 he doesn't want people to win via launching outa the arena
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:27:13 he want's people to win via destruction
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:27:49 but you can't have 4 motors powering your spinner
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:28:07 only 1 motor, to limit the fling, I don't care if it means your spinner sucks, mine takes 25 seconds to get up to speed now
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:28:41 and it looses all speed upon collision
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:30:33 idk, it doesn't seem to be in the rules but I think it is implied with 
**Change #2:** Your weapon motor torque should be like 5-ish or less

because if you have more than 1 motor is is technically more than 5 torque (unless they are stacked then it would be more than 40 speed; in violation of **Change #1:** Max speed on weapon motors for spinners is 40)

and also he told me personally in VIP 1 when I was testing my bot to unpower 2 of my 3 motors powering the spinner
events-chat 2022-05-06 12:31:15 specifically because he didn't want me to be winning simply because everyone gets flung from my spinner since that makes for boring fights

contest-chat 2022-05-21 01:06:04 no but the mods should understand
contest-chat 2022-05-21 01:07:52 I think it might be a close competition between mine  and yours, we will still have to find out who won now. <:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2022-05-27 05:38:31 I could be bothered to crop it
creations-chat 2022-05-27 05:49:02 look at the shadows on the tail, then look at the background, the shadows on the ramps over the traintracks go in a slightly different direction to that of the tail... but I think there is enough other stuff for it to be known as fake anywa
creations-chat 2022-05-27 05:53:31 they are right, you should just make better builds, my first few builds got horrible downvotes, since then I haven't had any negative score posts, I don't even make big things I mean this got 82 upvotes (back when 100 was incredible)
creations-chat 2022-05-27 06:03:48 needs more than 300 upvotes

<@297120728342331392> since when?
creations-chat 2022-05-27 06:08:11 not if you are building it, don't go for HOF, those builds take months to make; go for a positive upvote count if you are new, I have been in this server for over 2 years and I have nothing over even 3k blocks (my biggest build is from the battlebot event, that got me the event winner role)


<@673249949344989203> the first one looks like a shredder bug, the second has exposed propellers, and the last looks decent, but screenshot your photos, don't take them from a phone of your screen, I can't see them properly and it is an eyesore to look at, so screenshot them please
creations-chat 2022-05-27 06:10:32 150, as I just learnt (150 score, upvotes - downvotes = score)

<@639374429532717056> Antonov A-40, I will always recommend this (I learnt about it before the scrapman video)
creations-chat 2022-05-27 06:12:41 big things

<@738714901849047040> I checked 3 minutes ago, it is 150
creations-chat 2022-05-27 06:15:27 people don't have high standards, you have low build quality

<@523003901075521536> that nose is so pointy
creations-chat 2022-05-27 06:20:10 I just realised... EXPOSED LOCk
creations-chat 2022-05-27 06:23:10 they have to DM a mod, the mod then puts the build up for voting by the VIP's, these people then vote on wether the build should be put into <#627195143040139264> if it does not get passed, then it does not get in, not everything gets into <#627195143040139264>

help 2022-06-08 11:03:01 late reply but:
what is  the scale? that could be star citizen sized nova tank size or a Bob semple sized tank
why are the cheeks (turret front) so flat, that tank has a small cheek angle of ~15  degrees which only increases effective thickness by 1.03 times  (I did the trigonometry for it)
and I doubt anyone is gonna steal that artwork, you don't need watermarks everywhere
help 2022-06-08 11:05:00 what?
help 2022-06-08 11:06:04 so from my understanding, you are asking how to imagine  a 4d world?
help 2022-06-08 11:06:44 It bends down
help 2022-06-08 11:07:53 oh ok, well spacetime doesn't actually "bend" in the common sense of that word, that is just a representation of how to imagine how gravity works
help 2022-06-08 11:09:37 are you talking about this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg?
help 2022-06-08 11:10:50 yeah it doesn't bend, and even it space-time was bending there isn't any external 'gravity' sort of force that pulls everything  down into the folds of the space-time fabric
help 2022-06-08 11:11:06 that is simply a way to visualise it
help 2022-06-08 11:11:52 cap
help 2022-06-08 11:13:12 it is a particle that gives everything mass, the Higgs-boson particle, these particles  are attracted to each other, which makes gravity, I don't know much about sub-atomic particles but that is what I think it is
help 2022-06-08 11:14:09 if there was a fourth dimension stuff would be way more wonky

this is 4d toys, it is a 4d simulation
help 2022-06-08 11:15:09 you can understand how a  fourth dimension would work
help 2022-06-08 11:15:16 and there is no fourth dimension
creations-chat 2022-06-09 09:35:43 someone should piston-lock a whole bunch of wing-lights together into the form of a tiny jet that is smaller than 1x1 stud, then title it "ro-scale"
I don't have the time to do it but I would
creations-chat 2022-06-11 05:29:26 I was making a tiny f-15 out of piston locked wing-lights that would be smaller than your arm, it was going to be called ro-scale

but  then roblox disconnected me for no fucking reason and I lost my 2 hours worth of work... <:hahaa:773727260539617280>

general 2022-06-11 07:41:26 Wdym?
general 2022-06-11 07:42:06 Oh, I had 3 seperate motors on the one weapon
general 2022-06-11 07:42:23 But because of the event I could only power 1
general 2022-06-11 07:42:37 You keep torque the same, max speed
general 2022-06-11 07:42:48 Or it is the same as triple torque
general 2022-06-11 07:42:52 For one motor
general 2022-06-11 07:42:57 Max speed
general 2022-06-11 07:44:12 It is just because of how long the blade is that it launched things so far (rpm * pi * radius * 2)
general 2022-06-11 07:48:13 So for a 70 block (I think) diameter weapon it is rpm * pi * 35 * 2

Or 219 * rpm = 4000 sps (/219)

Rpm = 18.26

Which is not what you asked for but I am bored so I did some maths equations
general 2022-06-11 07:48:47 I like maths

plane-crazy 2022-06-15 07:30:45 so planes arae fine  because you can land on land
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 07:31:02 and cars are fine because you a re on land
plane-crazy 2022-06-15 07:31:17 but trains and boats are limited to areas where other peopleare never there

creations-chat 2022-06-24 13:26:29 <#504436696021204992> for some reason draws the angriest and most argumentative of people, that is why it has slow mode, because people have constantly been arguing for years, they even tried renaming it seeing if that would help (It didn't) (it was called <#384025409945337856>-feedback)

just use <#478584971670454284> or <#384021699466756107> if you want help with a build, you aren't gonna have a good time if you go here

just kidding <:trollface:775024642104229898>

then why do you have no ranks?

I just realised it is only by 9 days
creations-chat 2022-06-24 13:32:42 oh different timezone moment

also ranks aren't the time you spend on discord, it would be more about the time you spend in plane crazy

also, while you may have been here longer than me, you have sent a grand total of 750 messages (rounded) I have over 3.5k messages

also this entire argument started because i jokingly called him a whitename (as an example to eeedpd)
creations-chat 2022-06-24 13:39:30 (event winner is better than any standard expert rank)

creations-chat 2022-06-24 13:47:51 it is always the unique and/or meme builds that get high upvotes (for lower skill), and so a lot of people get their expert designer ranks that way, rather than a jet or tank (really common builds) that is just good quality

general 2022-10-13 20:31:53 This elderly patient named Helen with a full shaved head just barged in to my room while I was sleeping. She was leaning over my bed and calling me Christine and asking about a cup of tea. There were about 4 nurses following her. The nurses tried to escort her out of the room but she slapped them. She was eventually convinced out of the room by saying her mum was there. Now she is out in the hallway screaming "MUUUUUM!!! Please stop me, please stop me now." Apparently the nurses are just trying to make her a cup of tea.

general 2022-10-23 06:12:30 very different, doxxing is finding out someones identity and making it public. DDOS means direct denial of service, when you overload a server in order to crash it or limit traffic

events-chat 2022-11-11 22:01:04 does it have to start inside the build limit or be inside the build limit throughout the fight, or just be able to fit inside the build limit?

events-chat 2022-11-11 22:09:27 ok
events-chat 2022-11-11 22:17:09 rbk, so you made a few new rules last tournament because I had a giant spinner that would send you flying at 4k speed, are you going to put those rules back in?
events-chat 2022-11-11 22:17:39 also I am allowed to participate? because I won the last battlebot tournament
events-chat 2022-11-11 22:20:25 oh and are wings and helium banned?
events-chat 2022-11-11 23:41:57 anyone who wants to test do it in VIP 2, VIP one has big ships and is really laggy
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:01:50 <@434843195025653762> yes that design was flawed remember I won the last battlebot tournament, and it took me three completed battlebots until I made my first good one
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:03:49 things that would help: thicken the supports, add much more weight, your main spinner is blocked by your wheels so move it infront of your wheels, smaller less obvious wheels (rbk's design can get away with it because he has super thick wheels) and make the spinner heavier, almost all of my wins came from launching enemies
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:06:12 I'm not rbk but I have seen some interesting designs. There was one guy with a whole  bunch of mini bots each with only 1 cutter, they were ineffective and were destroyed easily, his main bot had no weapons.
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:07:11 no
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:07:13 he did that
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:07:57 I was also thinking of a design where I would fling these all over the arena (they are called czech hedgehogs)
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:08:25 due to motor torque changes I couldn't get a good launching mechanism
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:08:40 but it wouldn't have worked anyway
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:08:57 but if I can make a wall of them then my eenemy can't pass
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:09:22 and dropping them means I hvae to move around rather than placeing them anywhere in the arena
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:09:48 🧠
events-chat 2022-11-12 01:10:47 and not a dum design because it would work in actual battlebots, but anythign that requires enemies to go up a wedge on the front, builds don't interact with each other that well and they will probably just push you back or go through you

general 2023-01-06 12:51:54 Actually closer to roscale than most tiny “roscale” jets
general 2023-01-06 12:52:51 Roscale
general 2023-01-06 12:53:29 I think people don’t realise how big fighter jets are and how a block is, it is only like 2.5 feet wide
general 2023-01-06 12:54:28 1 wide jets have their purpose, which is mainly for pvp, smaller = faster and more agile = harder to hit, easier to aim with
general 2023-01-06 12:54:46 in total they are 4ft wide
general 2023-01-06 12:54:50 5ft high
general 2023-01-06 12:54:54 (estimated)
general 2023-01-06 12:55:09 lmao imagine using jets for pvp
general 2023-01-06 12:55:20 battle snakes are where its at
general 2023-01-06 12:55:44 😳
general 2023-01-06 12:56:51 capable against other jets? or other builds?
general 2023-01-06 12:57:09 because the average build is not as capable as the average jet
general 2023-01-06 13:07:37 Where was that taken?
general 2023-01-06 13:09:05 But how is there a platform beneath you with studs?

plane-crazy 2023-01-07 08:00:55 if you have the room perhaps make two saves, one with torps, one with a life raft
general 2023-01-08 07:57:48 Hello PCC, I have a proposition to make, a new event, that would last possibly a week or two. It would be almost a giant war, where there are two teams, each one is trying to take over the world. It would be played somewhat on a checkered board, each team would choose where to move their units (players) on this board, when one group of players and another group of players end up on the same tile they hop into a private server and duke it out with PVP builds. If your squad looses then you are wiped off the board. Or maybe your players end up back at your base on the map or something idk. 

But that is the general idea. 

TLDR; week long war in PCC where skirmishes are resolved through PVP battles in plane crazy.
general 2023-01-08 07:58:09 if it sounds bad then I will just pretend I never said that, if not I will put it in suggestions.

general 2023-01-08 08:21:51 so just land battles then
general 2023-01-08 08:22:41 yeah, but you could limit it so that jets are nerfed ingame, like each team can only have 3 jets or something
general 2023-01-08 08:23:14 jets have to use fuel on!

general 2023-01-08 08:24:45 now thats a good idea
general 2023-01-08 08:25:47 another idea for an event that I think would be cool is just the battlebots event (best events) but no cutters, only explosive blocks
general 2023-01-08 08:27:11 I knew that
general 2023-01-08 08:27:15 that would be kinda funny
