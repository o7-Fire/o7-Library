creations-chat 2022-01-06 10:45:02 Lmao, u sure? Viking Line keeps pumping out new ships. While Silja Line uses ship classes, Oh and maybe because you love the ship "Serenade" from Silja Line, actually. I love Serenade and I miss travelling with that ship
creations-chat 2022-01-06 10:48:19 You make me happy when you say u love Serenade, and yes it's pretty awesome to know that Viking Line uh, aims to have their own ship designs. One critical thing, their Viking Grace, was... not as I expected, I once boarded the ship to hopefully see many new features like gaming rooms or somewhat arcades and stuff, however. mostly there were spa, massage rooms, shopping, tax free, clothes and makeup stuff, chill and smoking and idk, pretty boring in Viking Grace, and a lot wet and dirtiness

creations-chat 2022-02-06 13:18:09 yea sure. It's not like I will earn something from the ship. total build hours (yet) : 30 hours. by days it took 2 weeks to build due to school and stuff.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 13:46:19 Alright, three other screenshots. bruh. too much space, no nitro <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2022-02-06 13:49:56 Windows not added yet. am undergoing test for speed. and turning rate for the ship. (wtf is my english)
creations-chat 2022-02-06 13:52:56 yes. (that guy at the bow trying to save me from driving off the edge of the water. Shoutout to that hovering platform)
creations-chat 2022-02-06 13:59:22 I won't post that ship to creations due to toxic high rankers with "ship builder" roles talking smack on me. I keep the best creations out of PCC

you sure? many commented bad deck colour, weird ass hull, and a ugly mid structure of the ship
creations-chat 2022-02-06 14:01:24 Ofcourse, every high ranker, expert designer talks down on potential players.

I get extremely fucked by the "experts"

No way I am gonna post my best builds to get extra downshotted
creations-chat 2022-02-06 14:05:14 Like I said no, I am already mentally damaged by how much fucking ruthless shit I've got across servers and those expert role members. No fucking way I will post it up to get "upvotes".  It's a huge risk if I were to put up a great efforted build.

Because later then, few member with "expert designer" will comment "your ship build just. nah, it's just awful man. you use simple basics. You gotta open your eyes lmao"

And also, "attention seeker". = not gonna post my ship in <#384025409945337856>  lmao
creations-chat 2022-02-06 14:09:41 I'm not expert, like every expert/godly builder in PCC told me, my creations are hot garbage. So my decision is that I'm just a regular builder.
creations-chat 2022-02-06 14:13:32 Go search up creations, from ShaSam_Officials, you will find creations made by me. but not posted by me, from there. I should've earned some roles atleast. but got downshotted believing I did something good **Nevermind, seems like it's gone** (Ignore this comment)

plane-crazy 2022-02-09 09:33:05 My custom fighter jet drawing. A Chinese Stealth Fighter, ‚ÄùDragon Fighter‚Äù or ‚ÄùÈöêÂΩ¢Èæô = Invisible Dragon‚Äù, No cockpit window, instead a protected shell covering the pilot. And how to track or see the outside view, is by cameras. Basically, stealthy fighter pilot working **blindfolded**. And inside the shell there are 360 degrees screen watching all over the aircraft. By cameras. The elevators, difficult to explain. ‚Ä¢ right under the engine, with vertical controls affecting directly to the engines thrust, sort of in mind trying to imagine as effective to manuever(can‚Äôt spell) <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>

creations-chat 2022-02-11 15:45:57 My **first time** on trying to make a highly complicated locking build. (This aircraft is a custom based on my drawing.) I need feedback on how you guys smoothen the sharp edges'n'wedges. I am no pro builder (no roles)
creations-chat 2022-02-11 15:49:23 Literally, this plane is custom. it's **CUSTOM** everyone go "fuck you, fucking ugly plane, go fuck yourself, thank you lmao" 

IT'S NOT A CANOPY WHERE THE PILOT CAN SEE THROUGH.
creations-chat 2022-02-11 15:53:38 for fuck sake chill. the canopy is meant to be like that. This plane is not like the other fighter jets. the canopy is not made of glass. Inside where the cockpit is, is a shell. that protects the pilot. Basically, an aircraft working blind (+ stealthy).

plane-crazy 2022-02-18 23:14:07 I get so fucking triggered by these brainless players, first they guessing it is a Aircraft carrier. then they guess it's Titanic because the hull is painted "a white part :0"
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 23:15:09 Usually then I get ganged up by other brainless people who agree that this ship is indeed, 100% no cap "Titanic"
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 23:15:26 Like, what the fuck is this world
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 23:15:35 Well Idk dude

plane-crazy 2022-02-18 23:16:55 Yea
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 23:18:01 Well some respects and apologies to guessing wrong, but these people I just met is like the 9/10 who starts arguing as if it's my fault for building **the Titanic wrongly**
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 23:18:51 u sure bout dat dude
plane-crazy 2022-02-18 23:19:40 From many aspects and reports, that ship I built is confirmed from 109 people to be exact count, "**Titanic**" or now "An Aircraft Carrier" <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>

plane-crazy 2022-02-26 11:57:34 Now the purpose of this is to be a carrier version of NS Savannah. 

planes instead of passengers. Cargo, still included for the ship's task.
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 11:59:03 The ship isn't made for out at sea task force, it's just a converted cargoship specially made for convoys (now carriers won't be needed)
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 12:02:13 That's why there's still so many windows lmao, obviously carriers are suppose to be protected with their armour too, but the ship isn't cuz it's not focused on it.
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 12:02:16 **ANYWAYS**
plane-crazy 2022-02-26 12:02:45 Can I have a test subject, anybody willing to test land on the carrier?
