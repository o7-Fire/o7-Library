plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:41:34 how do you arrange ballast tank
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:42:50 also would Helium block helps
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 03:43:52 the "apply at center" of helium block means it apply at center of mass right?
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 09:59:41 would it help if Ballast Tank has "apply at center" option like Helium
plane-crazy 2021-02-22 12:37:27 would putting wings on submarines help with balance
plane-crazy 2021-02-23 01:27:58 I give up trying to build a submarine
