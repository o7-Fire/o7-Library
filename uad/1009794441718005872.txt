general 2022-12-06 22:46:37 The MP5 submachine gun was developed by Heckler & Koch company in the early 1960s. It proved to be a highly successful design. In 1966 it was adopted by West German police, border guard and special forces. It proved to be an extremely successful design. Despite its age, the MP5 is in service with nearly 90 countries, including Germany. Its production still continues. This weapon is license-produced in Greece, Iran, Mexico, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Turkey and the United Kingdom. It is one of the most famous firearms of its class. Its only rival in terms of proliferation is the Israeli Uzi submachine gun. The Heckler & Koch MP5 is a blowback operated, selective fire weapon, chambered for a standard 9x19 mm Parabellum ammunition. However this submachine gun is unusual because it fires from a closed bolt and has a roller-delay blowback mechanism, similar to that of the Heckler & Koch G3 automatic rifle. It makes this weapon extremely accurate. This submachine gun can be seen as a scaled-down and rechambered version of the G3. The MP5 is a high-quality, reliable and accurate weapon. Trigger units of the HK MP5 are available with various fire mode options, including semi-auto, full-auto and various burst modes. Modern versions have ambidextrous fire mode controls, mounted on either side of the receiver. Cocking handle is mounted at the front of the receiver, on the left side. First production models of the MP5 were fed from a straight box-shaped magazine. In 1977 a curved magazine was introduced, which is now used as standard. It has 15- or 30-rounds capacity. This SMG is also compatible with 100-round drum magazines. Sights of this submachine gun are similar to other Heckler & Koch weapon models and consist of front post and rear diopter. Red-dot, optical or night sights can be mounted on a quick-detachable clamp. Effective range of fire is up to 100 meters. A number of improvements were made to this SMG over time.

general 2023-01-17 16:10:27 â€¦ Brothers of the mine rejoice!
Swing, swing, swing with me
Raise your pick and raise your voice!
Sing, sing, sing with me
Down and down into the deep
Who knows what we'll find beneath?
Diamonds, rubies, gold and more
Hidden in the mountain store
â€¦ Born underground, suckled from a teat of stone
Raised in the dark, the safety of our mountain home
Skin made of iron, steel in our bones
To dig and dig makes us free
Come on brothers sing with me!
â€¦ I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy, diggy hole, diggy, diggy hole
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy, diggy hole, digging a hole
â€¦ The sunlight will not reach this low
Deep, deep in the mine
Never seen the blue moon glow
Dwarves won't fly so high
Fill a glass and down some mead!
Stuff your bellies at the feast!
Stumble home and fall asleep
Dreaming in our mountain keep
â€¦ Born underground, grown inside a rocky womb
The earth is our cradle; the mountain shall become our tomb
Face us on the battlefield; you will meet your doom
We do not fear what lies beneath
We can never dig too deep
â€¦ I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy, diggy hole, diggy, diggy hole
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy, diggy hole, digging a hole
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy, diggy hole, diggy, diggy hole
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy, diggy hole, digging a hole
â€¦ Born underground, suckled from a teat of stone
Raised in the dark, the safety of our mountain home
Skin made of iron, steel in our bones
To dig and dig makes us free
Come on brothers sing with me!
â€¦ I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy, diggy hole, diggy, diggy hole
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy, diggy hole, digging a hole
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy, diggy hole, diggy, diggy hole
I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy, diggy hole, digging a hole...

Youre a plane crazy player (I hope)! Say, wanna get better at plane crazy?

Well then youve come to the wrong place because I only need **experienced players**

But why is that? Because this is a group about invention, and *science*! Cool right? No! Science is science, it doesnt have a temperature!

Say, save me from this pain and join today!
