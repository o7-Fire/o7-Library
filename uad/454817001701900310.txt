plane-crazy 2020-10-24 16:53:14 bruh tank
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 16:53:29 that's going to be the name of the facility for now on
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 16:54:02 idk guys i think that factory is moving
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 17:01:13 this f8e was supposed to replace my fighter (my chaika i153) but apparently the springs for the adjustable motorlock really just makes it glitch out, like it can fly. It's just that it just glitches out too often
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 17:01:55 and another thing is that those super thrusters are more than what my chaika has but my f8e is somehow slower
plane-crazy 2020-10-24 17:02:08 so it's better off as a showcase build instead of a fighter 😔\

plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:53:01 some kid in plane crazy just pulled up a trump 2020 sign, then the actual politically educated people (like me) proofed him wrong, he actually wanted proof, so i gave him it. And he cursed at me and laughed at my proof, and he showed no proof at all for his point.
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:53:07 sorry if i disturbed you guys
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:53:56 the evidence was about trump flirting with a minor, what he said was that joe sniffs children
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:54:01 he showeed to evidence
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:54:10 trust me politics bore everyone
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:54:28 samn no need to be rude 😔
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:55:23 i litterally didn;t get offended, the guy just pulled up a "joe sniffs children" card and i proved him wrong in discord
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:55:41 proving someone wrong doesn't mean that i got offended
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:55:49 it just means standing by your point and winning
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:56:34 so i don't what yopu mean by me getting "offended" but i guess i see your point..?
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:57:00 nono, he said trump 2020, then he said joe sniffs children
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:57:10 and this was about plane crazy because he did that in plance crazy
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:57:35 woah calm down jamal, i don't give a shit about that guy either, i just wanted to expose him in this chat
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:57:59 and also
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:58:02 you broke a rule.
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:58:32 i litterally just exposed him of bringing politics into a game, like no one is in a game for that.
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:59:04 what does being longer than i have mean anything in this argument
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:59:34 and yes here is a thing that i'm building
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 01:59:37 happy now?
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:00:15 and if you know me well, then you also would realize that i don't give shit either
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:01:41 to prove to you that the trump 2020 guy was being rude and brought politics into a damn game.
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:01:49 but then you started being rude
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:02:38 no, for being a literal dip shit and being rude to others, which that breaks rule number 2 or 1 i forgot
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:02:43 aka me
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:02:54 thats what you come up[ with
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:03:51 that and proved the guy wrong, and proving you wrong but somehow you still being rude and not getting what i'm saying
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:04:15 like the words that i say pass through your ear and leaves through the other
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:05:45 you said that so many times now, like i said, i don't care either. I just wanted to expose him, and also other people might care. The earth 

 revolve around you bud.
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:06:04 if you do not care then just don't say anything
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:06:08 other people might care
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:07:22 alright, now please don't bring your repetitive shit to me ever again, please and thank you. And hopefully you learn to not repeat yourself over and over again, Argument over.
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:08:00 (i'm so smooth at arguing 😎 )
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:11:33 i was about to say something but i'm not going to argue with you again
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:12:00 yes, because i said that the argument wss over
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:12:07 thats why
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:12:20 now i will stop talking before we argue again
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:13:19 just look throughout what we said, he's just going to tell his point of view
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:14:23 you forgot the part where i said "some people also care about this"
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:15:30 this is just pointless i keep on talking back to you and saying that the argument is over, i'll just stop for now, and you'll probably talk back again and "prove me wrong" because i'm not going to continue this
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:16:45 dont mind me i'm just getting this to elevate it up a bit
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:18:19 thanks but you didn't need to thank me i'm just getting this reference to elevate it up a bit
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 02:18:45 it's pog 😳
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 07:52:11 guess who tried copying brickzay's motor locked plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 07:58:10 ngl he didn't even try<:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 08:04:04 oh you're right
plane-crazy 2020-12-31 08:04:17 that was a bold assumption of mine, sorry
creations-chat 2021-01-11 12:35:30 it doesn't say the version but here's the blue print if you can tell which ah 1 is which https://www.the-blueprints.com/blueprints-depot-restricted/helicopters/bell/bell_ah_1_cobra-05331.jpg
general 2021-01-12 22:33:14 quick question, how do i add a suggestion?
creations-chat 2021-01-14 01:56:20 thats the whole purpose of the build, to look used
creations-chat 2021-01-14 01:59:23 metal is pretty much just makes the whole build easier and the main purpose of the build is to be fats and agile, also metal is pretty much just the default material with extra weight and with some slight changes, and it's darker
creations-chat 2021-01-14 02:09:13 then why does my heli not fly at all when i used metal material, i litterally have evidence that metal affects the weight
creations-chat 2021-01-14 02:15:04 https://streamable.com/8equ3x my turns were slower than usual and it felt heavier over all, still could fly so thats a plus. but like i said, it was just a darker version of the default block.
creations-chat 2021-01-14 02:19:41 https://streamable.com/32mypj here it is without the metal, you can tell by it being more brigh tstill the same speed, but it felt lighter in the controls. The only reason why i was falling is because i was testing the turn rate
creations-chat 2021-01-14 02:21:43 but like you said, maybe it could be because of the reflections. But i get your point'

creations-chat 2021-01-23 17:03:25 i'm making a custom plane, can someone give me some feedback?
creations-chat 2021-01-23 17:05:36 i told you that it's not finnished yet, and also the reason why it's not further back is because if i do then then the plane tilts towards the front, but i am going to move the landing gear back a bit once i finnish it
creations-chat 2021-01-23 17:16:14 quick question, which wing type should i use? Because the current one i'm working with isn't that good
creations-chat 2021-01-23 18:28:03 yeah maybe i should add actual thrust so it can fly (maybe though just maybe)
creations-chat 2021-01-23 18:58:13 Oh wait maybe I should add a rudder with elevators, those would look good
creations-chat 2021-01-24 00:06:01 nose it too long, cockpit is too small, and learn how to use single rotor, it's pretty easy. Also your rudder is kind off.. thick, and so are the wings <@!485279335758954497>
creations-chat 2021-03-07 19:55:24 i need feedback, it looks bland
creations-chat 2021-03-07 21:04:37 it's because of the muzzle and also it has cargo for extra detail but it ended up loking less like the kv1
creations-chat 2021-03-25 22:39:54 <@!719168864705052802>  why upvote when you can downvote
creations-chat 2021-03-25 22:43:07 NO

creations-chat 2021-07-06 21:06:17 thats because you're using tracking, i dont use it when fighting <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>, plus i'd rather use the fire works
