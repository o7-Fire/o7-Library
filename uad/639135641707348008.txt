general 2023-05-02 08:57:01 man i just looked in general what did <@813429965546323978> do lol
general 2023-05-02 08:57:37 i do it unintentionally with like 10k block builds
general 2023-05-02 08:58:05 damn the disrespect
general 2023-05-02 08:58:50 man anything over 1k blocks with some angle lock makes basically anyone's pc start struggling
general 2023-05-02 08:59:38 lagging servers is just annoying tbh
general 2023-05-02 09:00:10 im in the middle of making a 108 block tall rocket rn lol
general 2023-05-02 09:00:28 purposely lagging servers i mean
general 2023-05-02 09:02:50 fr
general 2023-05-02 09:03:18 <@813429965546323978> can you even run plane crazy on max graphics while getting 60 fps
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:03:55 is it even gonna come out tbh
general 2023-05-02 09:04:43 what cpu do you have
general 2023-05-02 09:04:55 /ram
general 2023-05-02 09:05:24 not relatable
general 2023-05-02 09:06:14 fr tryna speedrun chat level 3
general 2023-05-02 09:06:55 fr the whole point of pc is to build something then flex it to people
general 2023-05-02 09:07:16 (sarcasm)
general 2023-05-02 09:07:54 tbh most people probably dont care
general 2023-05-02 09:08:19 and anyway people can just blacklist you and turn their graphics down
general 2023-05-02 09:08:54 if someone has a lag machine just get a piston bug thingy which flings everything
general 2023-05-02 09:09:18 counter intuitivity
general 2023-05-02 09:09:23 yea
general 2023-05-02 09:09:42 no
general 2023-05-02 09:09:56 thats why its a good solution
general 2023-05-02 09:10:02 no
general 2023-05-02 09:10:27 shut up you have dementia
general 2023-05-02 09:11:09 can you even motor lock
general 2023-05-02 09:11:36 show a ss of a motor locked build
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:12:26 what the hell is that lol btw that is the most simple motor lock ever
general 2023-05-02 09:12:43 thats not proper motor lock
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:13:12 what is the floor made of
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:13:26 d*evolving
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:14:08 my god this guy is so humble
general 2023-05-02 09:14:32 profox is so humble
general 2023-05-02 09:16:17 bruh <@155149108183695360> shut up
general 2023-05-02 09:16:44 give it to 4chan

general 2023-05-02 09:20:02 yo <@711516970230612030> i think we let 4chan deal with the rest they will make quick work
general 2023-05-02 09:22:19 are those yours?
general 2023-05-02 09:22:48 oh dang thats pretty cool

general 2023-05-02 09:27:24 explain
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:27:41 show us a build
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:27:58 your best
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:27:59 i guess
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:28:29 exposed motorlock isnt always bad
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:29:12 oh i saw that in creations
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:29:16 its pretty solid tbh
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:29:41 sure
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:30:16 its not my favourite
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:30:20 but ive seen worse
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:30:47 why?
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:31:02 also to get rid of exposed lock i would just make bigger builds
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:31:35 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:31:38 its not bad
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:32:39 currently making a nice little rocket
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:35:03 this build isnt terrible but it's pretty old and slightly inaccurate
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:37:09 this is my slightly less scuffed f18
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 09:39:23 man i think this turret may be the new shredder
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:11:24 you could use cylinders
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:11:30 for the cockpit
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:11:38 and angle lock them
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:12:03 what happened with it tho
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:12:08 what did it look like
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:12:48 idk man you need like about 50 days of playtime before its not excusable not to use cylinder cockpits
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:14:05 he's still kind of new
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:14:32 problem with cylinder cockpit is its really difficult to use glass with them because the motors show through
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:14:37 i want glass motors
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:14:40 or invis motors
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:14:59 i started at 20 days
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:15:12 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:15:20 i havent used a cylindrical cockpit yet with builds
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:15:30 do you normally just go for a dark black
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:15:31 or sum
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:15:56 this guy is a sweat with likely over 170 hours playtime
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:16:02 actually
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:16:08 i think
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:16:12 its 2 motors required
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:16:19 one is in the front part of the nose
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:16:26 the other is hidden in the other cylinders
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:16:33 it depends how smooth you want the cockpit
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:17:18 tbh most people shouldn't expect to build as well as swordmaster im pretty sure he is well known for being a good builder
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:17:30 im so dumb
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:17:34 you can use cameras
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:17:40 i do ig
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:18:17 im not that active on here
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:18:27 pov: you live in england and people are striking
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:18:34 what
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:18:56 <@467459282250629120> how many blocks is just the nose there
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:19:34 how the hell does magnet locking work
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:19:58 yeah i havent looked at pc youtube in nearly a year
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:19:59 so
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:20:32 are the blocks loose or not
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:24:24 is magnet lock a perm feature now then
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:24:31 i assume rick knows about it
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:25:21 good news
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:25:35 pretty solid
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:25:43 what are the birds eye and front vies
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:25:45 views**
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:27:45 
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:28:17 that's an even older ss of ur build yea
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:28:26 i saw it earlier on creations
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:29:19 i think he means it has slightly too many curves
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:29:25 or sum
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:29:41 like the canopy looks slightly too tall
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:29:46 from the front
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:29:57 in comparison to the rest of the nose
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:30:16 literally
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:32:00 opinions?
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:32:49 canopy is a bit small
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:33:03 wdym bruh 😭
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:33:38 then make the nose bigger
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:33:48 ik what you mean but why do you mean it 😭
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:35:55 e
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:38:34 mission unsuccessfully completed
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:39:11 yes
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:41:53 why is my rocket swaying on an axis
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:42:23 multiple axis
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:42:33 3 axis
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:44:52 my rocket started falling at around 14k alt

plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:45:56 man its kinda hard when it has angle lock and it like 4k blocks
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:46:10 fr
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:46:23 if needs be make it just over halfway down
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:46:28 and motor lock wing panels over
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:46:54 like place the cylinders just past their halfway point into the nose
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:47:00 so there is a ridge
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:59:27 widest part of the cylinder is hidden inside of the blocks below
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 10:59:36 so there is a small lip/ridge
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 11:00:08 
plane-crazy 2023-05-02 11:11:05
