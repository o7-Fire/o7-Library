general 2021-04-09 02:30:23 people keep telling me that my motor locked b-29 is a tutorial. is there a SINGLE TUTORIAL video in the world ever, that shows how to build a motor locked build, my guess is no.
general 2021-04-09 02:30:44 welp
general 2021-04-09 02:30:58 ah jeez
general 2021-04-12 13:43:13 Can someone tell me what channel to go if I want to report something
general 2021-04-12 13:43:28 Oh wait nvm
bug-reports 2021-04-28 00:36:14 Yo what happened to the half pistons, The arm of the piston just falls off the block and donâ€™t work no more
general 2021-04-28 00:37:53 Anyone notice half pistons broke
general 2021-04-28 00:37:59 Prob not
general 2021-04-28 00:38:12 The arm of the piston falls off
general 2021-04-28 00:38:18 Kinda annoying
bug-reports 2021-04-28 00:44:13 Update: if the piston is extended is reverts back to normal
general 2021-05-02 01:41:50 Yall know that hubhhybbhuhhhhbhububhuubhbububj sound you can sometimes spawn in with, they added another, and it sounds  like Alvin and the chipmunks
general 2021-05-02 01:42:11 A
general 2021-05-02 01:42:21 Invis man
general 2021-05-13 01:17:32 Did motor locks break, they still work they still weld together, but now when I motor lock things the motors rotate... I do t think this has happened before
general 2021-05-13 01:17:55 My god my spelling
general 2021-05-13 01:18:17 Tell me abt it
general 2021-05-13 01:18:35 Oh god

general 2021-05-13 01:21:20 <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
general 2021-06-22 17:00:13 I wish magnets that weld together were actually togglable
bug-reports 2021-06-22 17:05:51 Idk about you but magnets that are togglable and can wield should be able to turn on and off, like motors, but instead just turn on and off the wield ability whilst also continuously powered.
bug-reports 2021-06-22 17:07:26 Wing panel eh?
bug-reports 2021-06-22 17:08:40 Iâ€™m building a float plane that has removeable pontoons, the magnets are connected to the wing panels. Is that the problem?
bug-reports 2021-06-26 17:48:20 Do magnets just not work anymore?
bug-reports 2021-06-26 18:08:55 Magnets are not togglable or weldable
bug-reports 2021-06-26 18:10:28 I donâ€™t understand
bug-reports 2021-06-26 18:12:17 I rejoined the server and when I check the magnet stats, the toggle option turned off
bug-reports 2021-06-26 18:12:25 Why
bug-reports 2021-06-26 18:13:07 I did, still dose the toggle
bug-reports 2021-06-26 18:13:19 Does motor locks have to do anything with magnets
bug-reports 2021-06-26 18:13:37 Iâ€™m moving the magnet into a position that it can be welded together
bug-reports 2021-06-26 18:14:49 Ok I fixed it, I welded the magnets while it was anchored in place
bug-reports 2021-06-26 18:15:03 :â€™(
bug-reports 2021-06-30 20:17:10 If you load in a build using sparklers, if you play the build the sparks letâ€™s wonâ€™t stick to ANYTHING in any orientation in the place the loaded sparklers were, if you place them anywhere else they stick.
bug-reports 2021-07-09 21:00:07 Control surfaces, without any movement, can make my build jump around
general 2021-07-22 21:15:59 Oh my god I am so happy of the undo button the save files, I almost had a heart attack
general 2021-09-04 18:52:13 Anybody know when the estimated release for plane crazy 2 is?
general 2021-09-04 18:52:35 ðŸ¥§
general 2021-09-04 20:01:33 is it just me or did the emogis just stop working
general 2021-09-04 20:05:56 is it just me, or do special characters not work anymore, i can try to paste them in but they just turn into 3 hashtags "###"
general 2021-09-04 20:07:09 its not underage, interestingly, these special charaters work on my older saves
general 2021-09-04 20:08:31 aw
bug-reports 2021-09-04 20:51:45 idk why, but some reason, in some pattern or ammount, signs stop working. I had a build that usesd excessive ammount of signs, and special characters wouldnt work. deleted it and characters started working.. pls why
bug-reports 2021-09-04 21:04:16 yes
bug-reports 2021-09-04 21:04:28 3 tags together "###"
bug-reports 2021-09-04 21:04:54 if the special character is mixed with a letter though, its visible
bug-reports 2021-09-04 21:07:18 thats impossible
bug-reports 2021-09-04 21:07:31 if i load any other save file the special characters work
bug-reports 2021-09-04 21:07:50 its just on a blank canvis or the one im working on
general 2021-09-08 17:22:00 Make the cars fall with style
