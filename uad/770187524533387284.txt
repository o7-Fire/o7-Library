creations-chat 2022-03-01 08:52:02 Thatâ€™s unfortunate, I feel like they should make a hall of fame for pvp builds (seperate to the current one of course), but in the pvp hof, itâ€™s based off of the jest effectiveness in pvp (that will mean you may have to send a video of its manoeuvres and some of its kills)
