help 2023-05-03 17:54:35 ah, yes I it has gravity of -9.81?
help 2023-05-03 17:54:59 it just flies to air
plane-crazy 2023-05-04 14:05:02 Suggestion(I xant suggest there) add transparency setting but max will be 0.85 to prevent Invisible lag machine
plane-crazy 2023-05-04 14:05:23 another siggestion: add weightless blocks to be used as decor
plane-crazy 2023-05-04 14:07:55 Suggestion 3: Its very hard to tell the rotarion of a block while its not placed specially lif its a wedge. Make rhe blocks while in edit less tranceparent
