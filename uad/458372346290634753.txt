plane-crazy 2022-07-28 21:50:32 well all blocks touching weld to eachother
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 21:50:54 maybe it has wedges where they dont technicaly touch eachother but are still welded because that side of the block is counted as weldable
plane-crazy 2022-07-28 21:51:15 oof

plane-crazy 2022-08-21 20:24:26 Since I wanna suggest making tnt in water have a much larger blast radius, but a weaker blast to simulate how depth charges or any explosive in water work in real life

plane-crazy 2022-08-21 20:34:41 Well Iâ€™m not ranked to suggest this, but can somebody suggest this please since I want to be able to make realistic depth charges
bug-reports 2023-04-15 21:41:45 bruuuh please fix the player clients not being synced when it comes to build damage. Been an issue for so long, and ruins pvp cuz half the time you use guns, the guns simply make the enemy invisible, but they are still alive
