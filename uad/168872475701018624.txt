plane-crazy 2020-06-08 13:22:14 Ah yes good pvp
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:04:02 center of thrust should usually be in line with the center of mass if you're looking from the nose of the plane to the tail
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:23:47 <@400114581109997589> center of lift should be in line with center of mass when looking top down
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:24:07 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:24:21 ye
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:24:31 Doesn't matter when you're looking top down
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:24:48 No lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:25:01 center of lift should be on the center of mass looking top down
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:25:09 Exactly on it would be optimal
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:25:35 Thrust in line with center of mass looking nose to tail
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:26:20 Or in front yes
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:26:39 It can be
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:26:43 It'll just make you pitch
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:27:08 That should be your control surfaces job
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:27:24 no that wouldn't help
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:27:30 It would make you keep veering up
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:27:59 They work for control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:28:04 With low torque and speed
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:28:32 No it would pitch the same
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:28:44 It would just take longer to get to maximum pitch
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:29:22 well speed is always nice
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:29:47 No speed makes motor2s spazzy
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:30:33 Nice and low
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:30:53 I haven't played for a while so I can't give you numbers
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:31:46 Youre not supposed to yaw that well
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:31:57 Planes irl use more roll to turn
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:32:25 You'd need to be able to roll
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:32:34 Mouse control doesn't let you do that very well
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:33:34 I usually do that
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:34:00 You have motor controlled control surfaces ye?
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:34:13 Ah
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:34:45 Well for roll you'd need a control surfaces on one side to go up and the other side to fall
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:34:49 That'll make you roll
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:35:14 No it can't
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:35:25 Which is why you need servos yeah
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:35:31 or rebind the control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:35:43 Servo is an option with motor2
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:35:55 It makes it move to a certain angle with a keybind
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:36:10 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:37:05 I wouldn't mix the two tbh
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:37:34 You can use motor locking or utilise control surfaces to avoid connecting wings
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:38:03 But with motor controlled wings
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:38:16 it's not the best to move the entire wing to turn lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:38:51 idk what you're describing
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:39:44 That would work if your control surfaces spanned the entire wing sure
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:40:02 But I'm not so sure about how much control that will give you
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:40:21 They do not connect where the thing moves
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:40:35 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:40:52 Yep
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:41:24 Why are you using suspension lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:41:42 I don't know why you'd need it on a plane
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:42:08 how big is your plane
plane-crazy 2020-06-08 22:42:22 idk

plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:25:34 > custom flaps are pretty unreliable when you wanna have a steady flight
nooo
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:25:45 they can be good
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:26:15 sounds like a problem with the plane
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:26:18 not the flaps
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:26:45 You could also use mouse control with custom flaps
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:27:28 hold up how would you do it without motor2
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:28:00 lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:29:02 we mean
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:29:08 control surfaces?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:29:30 cos flaps are something else
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:29:55 lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:30:19 but yeah those are custom control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:31:46 does anyone have a build with flaps?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:31:52 I wonder if they're at all used
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:32:54 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:34:14 A couple k
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:34:25 like 500 lol

plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:50:00 no?
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:51:04 if you move your com closer to the col you will get more stable flight
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:51:15 control is ehhh
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:52:07 if lift isn't higher than mass, your plane will not take off
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:52:31 lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:54:07 don't forget center of thrust <:thchoink:527880803456122891>
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:54:26 it's barely an issue tho
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:54:34 only for small planes can it cause issues
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:55:32 not unless you really mess up
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:55:42 I'm talking placing the engines not even on the plane
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:57:02 put bombs in the com
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:57:47 if you'd like to get advanced
plane-crazy 2020-06-20 04:58:00 you could add some custom flaps to control your lift

plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:43:08 What
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:45:06 You don't need it in game either if you build it right
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:45:45 The bottom prop should be twice as fast as the top and in an opposite direction
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:46:03 Same size propellers
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:49:03 sure
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:49:21 Oh yeah I got it backwards
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:58:04 just make a better heli
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:58:37 make sure you got the center of mass lined up with the rotors

plane-crazy 2020-07-04 03:59:36 can you zoom out a lot
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:01:16 it's very small so it's probably sensitive to small weight changes
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:01:41 do characters weigh something while sitting?
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:01:57 Compensate for that then
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:02:17 How exactly is it flipping

plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:02:31 ok
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:04:00 I think it's your characters weight
plane-crazy 2020-07-04 04:04:15 just tack a block on the back and see what happens

plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:52:01 I can't see which way they're thrusting but see what changing the tail rotors speeds does
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:52:29 It doesn't need to be same speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:52:55 Fiddle around with it
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:55:48 Uh
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:56:07 Set it back to 30.5 but make the tail speed something like 40
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:56:39 See if it spins more or less
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:57:21 Really?
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:57:31 What do your main rotors look like
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:58:42 boo easy way out
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:59:44 What happens if you use only the tail rotor
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 03:59:54 Ok
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 04:00:32 I thought so
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 04:00:43 Your tail propeller is too small
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 04:01:09 wym looks like there's room to me
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 04:02:04 And you can't place the extra propeller on top?
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 04:02:24 that one would help
plane-crazy 2020-07-05 04:05:18 Did it work

plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:56:47 sneak attack
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:56:55 kamoflaj
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:57:33 at that point are mechs actually better than a tank?
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:58:03 to be fair, I've never heard a tank
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:58:40 how
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 03:59:12 doesn't something like a mortar have a ton of range too
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:00:05 fighting in an open field is a shit idea
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:01:21 because they're not any more effective than tanks <:KEKW:670310537300672528>

plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:03:15 why not use hydraulics
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:03:40 what isn't
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:04:15 Have you ever repaired a mech
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:04:40 ~
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:05:32 mechs are too sensitive imo
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:06:22 you'd need to rely on electronics more for stabilization and they just ain't as reliable as pure mechanical stuff
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:07:08 what if it gets stuck in mud
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:08:39 what if
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:08:42 tiny mech
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:09:36 gl with that
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:10:26 I think exosuits would be the most utility for mechs
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:11:30 armored car carrying armored people
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:12:00 exosuits have prototypes that work
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:14:37 most terrain actually
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:16:19 mechs aren't good for the applications of a tank
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:19:04 it works at small scales
plane-crazy 2020-08-03 04:19:48 don't matter
general 2020-08-03 04:20:25 do muscles have flexibility?
