plane-crazy 2020-11-04 00:19:08 Rip
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 00:19:20 Plane crazy has turned into "if there is no motor lock, it is bad"
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 00:19:34 Sad :(
plane-crazy 2020-11-04 00:19:51 I remember when having 3+ motors in the build was "complex"

creations-chat 2020-11-04 02:42:09 I don't like how reliant everyone is on motor lock. I mean yeah it's amazing in a ton of ways, but I feel like it's just becoming the new way to show off. Maybe I'm alone in that opinion. One thing's for sure: it's funny to see peoples unlocked builds

plane-crazy 2021-01-25 02:11:30 That a game I have spent 3-4 years on, have over 20 alts on, harly ever updates anymore?
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 02:11:34 The game I play almost every day

plane-crazy 2021-01-25 02:12:54 No, not for 1 year
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 02:12:56 I know that for sure
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 02:13:44 I don't really care about new stuff to do in the game, I'd be happy with just a few new blocks every now and then

creations-chat 2021-02-08 20:48:45 Wtf 

You use the 3d model to shape the build <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2021-02-08 20:51:18 I think he's having a seizure
creations-chat 2021-02-08 20:54:06 I use 3d models for my builds

Is there something wrong with that?

Wait, didn't read the whole thing

Shopping surprise...?
creations-chat 2021-02-08 20:56:06 He's either high, having a seizure, or both
bug-reports 2021-03-08 23:21:53 Uhhh what
bug-reports 2021-03-08 23:23:39 No, when I place it in 1 plot it goes to another
bug-reports 2021-03-08 23:23:48 I had it low so the file isn't huge
bug-reports 2021-03-08 23:24:00 Look at where I place the blocks and what plot the blocks go to
creations-chat 2021-03-19 14:06:42 First one kinda looks like a p40 with weird colors lol
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:38:01 Is it just me, or do stukas never die
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:38:32 The rockets either miss entirely even though you had a good shot, or they somehow manage to fly on 1 wing
plane-crazy 2021-03-21 03:38:49 Am I the only one?
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:20:38 Is this normally possible? Shouldn't the flat part of the motor collide with the cylinder?
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:21:55 No
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:21:56 It's not
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:22:08 If it was the block would rotate too
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:22:19 
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:22:29 I am c o n f u s e d

plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:22:47 Yes but
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:22:50 The motor is moving
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:23:22 That doesn't normally happen for me
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:23:54 If i have a bending part in my plane and press the motor after I use the disconnectors the whole thing d i e s
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:24:03 Unlike the prop
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 20:24:06 Nothing happens

plane-crazy 2021-06-14 23:35:23 He didn't load the plane, so idk which one it is
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 23:35:52 But given the f4 is the most popular plane from that era, I'd assume he's talking about that
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 23:37:31 I don't know man, I've never really looked into the origins of planes
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 23:42:52 What does that have to do with someone calling a plane "vietnam plane"
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 23:43:21 I mean....
plane-crazy 2021-06-14 23:43:36 I was just pointing out that he called a plane "vietnam plane"

plane-crazy 2021-11-04 20:13:54 stuff like big starships wouldn't normally be in PVP
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 23:08:17 Yes but i mean it’s small for maneuverability and no lag
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 23:08:22 For jets I mean
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 23:09:48 Most pvp jets are small right?

creations-chat 2021-12-29 13:53:12 Might just be me, but the intakes look a little long. Maybe shorten it by a half block or block?
creations-chat 2021-12-29 13:57:24 Hm... Maybe it's because there's no fuel tanks on the normal f15

which makes it look a little slim even though the length is fine

but pro model nonetheless
creations-chat 2021-12-29 13:59:50 You could try pontoons, that might work for the conformals

creations-chat 2021-12-30 15:09:34 Yes but just 1 color for ever part looks really bad. The real thing would have used different materials for certain parts making them vary slightly in color

Bare minimum you could do is make the wheels a little darker. Maybe 55,55,55
