general 2020-06-06 17:42:06 so in order to post a creation, do you just paste screenshots? or do you have to go through that streamable website?
general 2020-06-06 17:42:35 aight
plane-crazy 2020-06-11 04:56:47 imagine the possibilities of faster servers...
general 2020-06-12 17:41:58 is there a block just like the cutter block?
general 2020-06-12 17:43:27 a regular block, genius. one that isnt made for pvp
general 2020-06-12 17:43:49 ok, thank you
general 2020-06-12 17:44:23 i was looking for a block shaped the same, but where you could mount something on the tip
general 2020-06-12 17:44:39 wdym how
general 2020-06-12 17:47:12 lol
general 2020-06-12 17:47:50 nvm found a way. i can place a camera on the opposite side of it and it will remain there
general 2020-06-12 17:49:15 or not
general 2020-06-15 21:07:21 what's the biggest, buffest folding motor setup you guys can hmu with? the vehicle is 7000 blocks, to show how much torque i need
general 2020-06-15 21:10:03 aight
general 2020-06-15 21:10:30 does it matter how you face the cameras?
general 2020-06-15 21:17:25 lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 21:21:09 is there anything i can do to improve this motor setup?
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 21:22:17 will that make it any better?
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 21:23:04 aight
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 21:24:33 yeah lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-15 21:25:02 i just thought having two would be better, but i think that made it worse
