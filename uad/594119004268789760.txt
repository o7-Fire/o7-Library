plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:42:30 Would anyone want to play planes vs ships/anything that can be bombed Sunday?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:42:59 Am I the only one who does not use motorlock and does not make jets?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:43:06 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:43:35 Idk :D
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:43:59 They use your discord token or something(if discord acc)
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:44:56 Yes or profile
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:46:31 My classmate sent me one, he wanted some help with code, but I opened it using phone(that file only opens in website if you use mobile - python) and found account grabber program lol.
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:46:32 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:46:35 It wont work
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:46:47 It starts working exactly when you press link
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:47:22 Like you wont be abble to do anything, well you kinda can if you make program against it
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:49:14 Depends what kind of code is used
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:49:32 But ussualy you lose access to account when you press it
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:50:36 Something from cold war era
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:50:54 Maybe sabre( I have not seen one)
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:51:31 Or just something which is not jet, because it is overused(they are not so special as it used to be)
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:51:45 Wdym?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:51:59 Mig 27?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:52:10 When it is normal link?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:52:20 Or broken code
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:52:55 <@559568621312147476> you can use link checker websites
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:53:36 Ussually about 1 second
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:55:24 You do not have to copy it, you can change it as you want, that is the point of the game
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:55:35 Block him and report it
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:55:48 Because hacker has complete controll then
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:56:03 Because why not?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:56:34 Well I wrote why, but ok
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:57:07 I suggest to make spaceships or tank destroyers
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:57:19 Or something from dune
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:57:28 Like that hyperdrive thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:57:33 Which guild uses
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:58:38 Depends, for me looks are number one and technical things are second when it comes to cars
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:58:50 Depends how it looks
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 17:59:10 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:01:46 Can someone rate my light bomber? In dms

plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:30:31 Build light bomber
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:30:45 But not irl
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:30:50 From my mind
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:31:25 Ohh I made today autistic version of c 130
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:31:47 Well it is not even c 130, but still
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:32:42 Something out of head
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:32:59 Why people only make copies of irl planesssss
bot-central 2021-11-13 18:33:22 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:35:53 This is kinds cursed
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:36:02 Why three wings on each side?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:36:46 One rear, one in the middle and one in front
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:38:23 I know that, but still why like that?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:38:28 Like it ruins design
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:39:02 And if wings were normal angle, it would be kinda fine
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:41:09 So you say that I can not criticise it?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:43:07 ü§® , I was not talking about technical side, the point was that it does look good with three wings on each side
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:43:54 I did not think that I will meet snowflake in this server
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:44:06 Does someone have ships?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:44:10 For bombing?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:46:09 He litteraly just tolde me stfu because I wrote that 3 wings on each side do not look good. Like jeeez am I not allowed to write anything?
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:47:57 I did not say anything so bad, not even curse
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 18:51:28 <@718409831639154718> boxness

creations-chat 2021-11-13 19:04:01 Well bigger are better 100% for things you mentioned, but the thing is - they are easier targets and I wanted to make mine lighter and faster.

I will remodel it to a bigger one Sunday

bot-central 2021-11-14 12:29:43 -servers
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:16:35 ? I am back in this server after like half a year
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:18:20 Like what did I do wrong? I just posted an image of a build I made. Like others are allowed too, so idk why I can't do it
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:21:30 Just because it looks bad? It is my first that kind of plane smh. Why are all of you so toxic instead of helping or something?
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:27:05 This is quite good *compared* to the builds I see in public servers(kids or very new players I suppose). Now I understand why others called this server toxic :/. Like when I first joined - people wrote suggestions or tried to help me build something instead of calling it goofy or cancerous. I know that it is not good,(not talking about what others make) but it is my first of that kind(and with no motorlock or other stuff).

Edit - well it is not a very good pvp plane, but can work as one, or at least was trying to build that
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:29:52 Umm I wrote that my build is not good, but at least I could get help or something instead of just being toxic. Maybe I wrote that wrong, but still
Edit - yes, I did. I thought that it will stop after your message, but I was wrong.
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:33:03 The thing is - I don't care about upvotes, I just posted it so I can get help(well I kinda got, but still) and just for fun. It is building game after all
Edit - <@757760986848559256> smart? English is my 2nd language and I am trying to seem as understandable as posssible.
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:35:01 As I wrote - I might have wrote that wrong and not as I intended while thinking about this stuff
Edit - <@683847069890510887> Exactly, that is why I needed help to make something better,(which I wrote several times) but I was wrong
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:40:46 Well just calling it shit and goofy without normal tips to at least make it better is not very good feedback in my opinion
Edit - well finally I got some help(acttualy 2nd time).
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:43:48 Umm I think that rockets should be exposed like in real life(I am not talking about how ugly it looks, but the idea of it)
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:45:40 Well I tried to make delta wings
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:50:42 What about this?
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:54:10 Sure, should I  place coloured block or something?
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:56:02 
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:58:35 <@685909594932773033> üëç , I will build new things after some time and will see how much this will help - thanks!
creations-chat 2022-05-04 18:00:38 The main barrel is made out of fireworks btw
