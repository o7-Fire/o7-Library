creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:35:18 A bridge and funnel as well as 2 torpedoes
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:36:59 Those depth charges
I see them alot how useful actually are they?
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:38:18 I might include them in my PT boat though it already has depth charge trays on the back they just don't sink
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:41:20 Not really
Patrol boats can get pretty big
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:41:53 Barrel bombs?
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:43:54 ^
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:47:37 I'm (slowly) designing a fully working I 400 with 8 reloading torpedoe tubes and 3 aircraft which are not only able to launch but are able to come back too and be re fastened into the hanger
I have the Submarine haul I'm going to be using from an older sub of mine
Making small float planes that's tails and wings fold down is quite troubling though
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:50:15 I'm bad at small things (that don't use motor lock)
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:50:59 I don't get how the ranks work
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:52:30 <:MichiFlustered:735209099310137365>
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:55:49 Wait.. do WIP's include assets? Because my Gollioth isn't really a build by itself it's meant to be strapped to the back of my other tanks and stuff
creations-chat 2020-10-11 15:56:43 Ight
creations-chat 2020-10-11 16:04:28 That engine is so sexy
creations-chat 2020-10-11 16:05:19 *I just avoid coloring by using a dark color and pink*
creations-chat 2020-10-11 17:53:03 a-10s are so simple and feel so much much older I love them
creations-chat 2020-10-11 17:57:44 I like the current colors they are abonoxously bright
creations-chat 2020-10-11 18:13:52 I need an algorithm that hits a key for every beat of music 
So that I can make my half track's engine flare every beat
creations-chat 2020-10-11 18:20:05 <@456226577798135808> that's fair but all my builds are dark and so militerized
But something always seems so whimsical about old ww1 Bi planes
I like making them brighter
creations-chat 2020-10-11 18:23:56 my half track plays clint eastwood
creations-chat 2020-10-11 19:00:45 We might start working on another small tank.
Any ideas? We're thinking something amphibious.
creations-chat 2020-10-11 19:04:05 Also we feel like adopt me may be forced to undo the update
Roblox would never take it down it's too much of a cash cow
But we haven't been able to use chat since yesterday so-
creations-chat 2020-10-11 19:04:38 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-10-11 19:07:30 We don't understand how conveyor tanks turn
Because they can't turn like tanks..
creations-chat 2020-10-11 19:09:59 We have only ever made wheel tanks..

No they can't because if you stop turning one set of conveyors it just keeps going forward half speed
creations-chat 2020-10-11 19:12:10 I was going too quickly build a "This us a rick roll" and add it on my plot and then post it and I thought if I did that the mods would get mad so-
creations-chat 2020-10-11 19:12:54 How do the ranks work? Can someone explain?
the-dump 2020-10-11 19:26:58 That moment when you get the Ballance wrong

creations-chat 2020-10-11 20:16:44 It's RGB.. I don't understand why it's RGB but it's RGB
creations-chat 2020-10-11 20:20:34 Yeah oreoning is right.. this community is pretty vile
But most vehicle or military aircraft centered things like plane crazy I noticed tend to attract these same types of people... So yeah..
creations-chat 2020-10-11 20:21:45 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-10-11 20:24:05 Like I'm not building massive things because I don't like playing them I only build light tanks because I find heavier things boring
I don't build jets because I find them boring not because I can't
But the assumption constantly made is that I am terrible because I don't like making ceirtian things
Or you know people just go "shut up furry" but I think that's just a roblox thing
creations-chat 2020-10-11 20:32:39 I'm bitching about the shit I am given for being a furry
Not really about the downvotes.. 
Lol

creations-chat 2020-10-11 20:44:00 Danm
That's sad
It's the exact kind of beautiful abomination that I'd expect to be built
Truely a marvel
creations-chat 2020-10-11 20:59:43 Alright sweet so it does exist
creations-chat 2020-10-11 21:00:37 I was just wondering it's one of my favorite planes because it's fucking wack
But I don't want to build it because it's 90% wing and I hate building normal plane wings let alone 9 of them
creations-chat 2020-10-11 21:01:23 > thats a bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-plane
<@626449107577471012>

Our freind laughed this off understanding but he came over and started bitching at us for throwing shit
I couldn't explain because my tics were acting up
Him yelling made it worse

So yeah not nice guy

You don't need a Heavy bomber in that case
You need a fighter to take care of the bugs
Then if there are things to bomb you use a bomber
creations-chat 2020-10-12 02:02:29 Motherfu- then why are you using it in a game of shredders

creations-chat 2020-10-12 10:37:39 Not really..? Alot of them are pretty high effort especially things like mini hovercraft bikes cars subs because you have to get balancing right..
Also alot of them are meant to be built as part of different things
creations-chat 2020-10-12 10:40:19 Alright
What about this?
This got downvoted dispite it being pretty detailed and it's main goal being small and light weight at 30 blocks so it can be carried by tanks

creations-chat 2020-10-12 17:24:13 It's scale is to smal for e to use tracks and I wanted it to be faster so I used wheels
creations-chat 2020-10-12 17:25:18 also I play on a fucking calculator 
so the lag tracks make isn't ideal..
creations-chat 2020-10-12 17:52:47 what else should I add to the armed half track?
creations-chat 2020-10-12 17:55:02 I tried adding better looking tracks they just reduced it's current high speed by alot
creations-chat 2020-10-12 17:56:44 it functions as a half track with tractor tank steering in the back and truck steering in the front..  that's why i contune calling it a half track even though I took the better looking treads I had on it off
creations-chat 2020-10-12 17:58:16 2 by 2
creations-chat 2020-10-12 18:02:57 <@!359613171495075842>  they are right next to each other with 6 of them (no motor lock in the base for extra wheels)
creations-chat 2020-10-12 18:14:34 I'm bored
creations-chat 2020-10-12 18:17:02 I'll try to ree add the tracks to my half track while maintaining it's high speed...
creations-chat 2020-10-12 18:31:18 Any other **weopons** I should add to my half track
creations-chat 2020-10-12 18:34:40 I was thinking about adding a larger cal turret on top.. but the beauty of the current design is it's kinda more supportive then anything.. I can easily pass as unarmed and thus not a threat when entering a tank battle until I decide to pick an enemy.. or I can use my mines and completely stay out of the fight
A big gun would make it a bigger target
And I can only outrun so many rockets

creations-chat 2020-10-12 19:19:50 Discreet to the point of looking unarmed is fucking brilliant
The experienced players with actually dangerous tanks leave you alone because your unarmed
You hide behind them when the noobs come to destroy you 
Then Just when your outmatched by the rocket spam you deploy your own rockets
Having spent so much time along side the experienced tanks they won't attack you even though it's clear you are armed and the noobs have another threat to deal with

creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:57:25 I think he kinda knew it was going to get downvoted
creations-chat 2020-10-13 12:59:27 *mwahaha*

creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:04:29 <@553225222904479744> I really like how low profile that is
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:06:22 I mean it's intresting..
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:07:53 It's a good hand dryer
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:08:24 Indeed
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:08:58 It's a fenta wing
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:25:20 *yours will probably work better then the actual one
Fucking thing jammed every 5 minutes*
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:25:55 Yeah it was super cool
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:26:25 And scary looking
But a terrible machine gun

Rhino is fucking bae
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:27:11 I love the rhino
I was the weird girl who was into nerf and art
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:32:55 Anyone ever have the double barrel shotgun? I fucking loved that thing it was my go too
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:33:35 That and my orange sniper
I don't even remember what it was called but it was orange had a scope and shot down a block and a half
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:35:47 The rihno was too big for a go too
I keep that at my base

Sniper for main
I don't remember what the sniper was but it shot farrr

Modulus is a good side arm because you can use it for anything and it's reliable

And the zombie strike or elite 2 shot pistol is yes
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:36:28 If your carrying the vulcan or rihno into battle you be looking like gorge from halo reach
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:36:54 I don't have the build for that no thanks
I'ma stick to carrying around a sniper and shotty
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:39:29 I found my sniper
It's called the raptor strike
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:40:21 Though I think mine was a n earlier version of it? It had an actual scope and the berral could be added too.
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:41:53 This fucking thing was best side arm
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:42:15 Take your zombie strike pistol and shoulve it up your ass this was basically a blunderbuss
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:51:04 I mean it was for all the newer ones
It would eat the old tag team darts tho
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:51:20 But nobody uses those
Those
Those were bad
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:52:43 I actually can't think of any good tag team guns except for the micro pistol
And I think they remade that as elite so.. yeah fuck tag team
creations-chat 2020-10-13 13:53:20 Oh wait
The judge was scary
I don't remember if it was good but it was scary looking
creations-chat 2020-10-13 14:25:19 Early wip of my blimp's gene
creations-chat 2020-10-13 14:35:56 Anyone ever see the movie event horizon?
creations-chat 2020-10-13 14:36:21 I wanna build the ship from it
Just because it looks awesome
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:40:16 Flappy boi
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:40:53 Question
Do blimps fly forward and turn with a rudder like a plane or can they turn while stationary?
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:41:29 I know
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:41:45 But I was wondering if they used there engines to turn during like
Docking and shit
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:42:45 They turned upwards
But how do you dock something that needs to be moving forward to turn??
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:43:48 Like
How would they have orentated it when landing it  if it's using only a rudder to turn them
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:44:45 Shit wait so I have to- ohh
Okay got it
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:45:10 Basiclly tank steering but in the form of blimps engines
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:45:50 That's going to be a pain... I think I can pull it off though
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:46:30 I know
creations-chat 2020-10-13 15:47:04 I'm not going to be using a tower my blimp is too small
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:01:38 should I arm my smoll boat?
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:06:11 should I arm my smoll boat?
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:14:38 Wow I really didn't expect that to get so many upvotes because it had my usual lazy paint job..
creations-chat 2020-10-13 16:16:21 Blimp
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:03:44 What type of arms do I put on a blimp? Like how do you pvp with them. I'm thinking I would treat it like a gunship right? A bomber with alot of AA and guns to attack ground targets
But idk
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:05:33 Well it carries bombs and is slow
That's pretty similar to a gunship..
Idk what do I arm it with
How do you pvp with a blimp in PC
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:06:53 Not even like
Just bombing? My bi plane has a max speed of 84 and it's one of my most effective creations
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:07:21 It's basically a heavy bomber mixed with a gunship
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:08:23 It has a boost that can go over 3000 speed
But it's main bombing speed is 84 and it spends most of it's time like that
It's main use is heavy carpet bombing and then being used as a gunship
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:09:13 That's why It doesn't
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:10:18 That boost is a very very last resort
It's max speed is 80 something
It slowly buzzes over spawn carpet bombs dumps fireworks and rockets 
That's what it does
I'm wondering if the blimp should be similar or..?
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:15:58 
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:16:12 this slow ass thing destroys in pvp
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:17:06 who?.. what's this chat being flooded with now?..
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:18:31 I let people copy my stuff none of it is really complicated or good enough for me to be too protective over it
general 2020-10-13 17:41:18 People in that tank probably got pretty banged up
general 2020-10-13 17:41:45 ?

general 2020-10-13 17:48:16 But fucking weird
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:49:56 Also for the blimp
Are the 2 wing near the rail alerons or elivators
Because it seems wrong to tilt the whole ass thing up to go up given its a helium balloon on crack it should do that on its own
creations-chat 2020-10-13 17:50:36 And Idk where the hell else alerions would be..

general 2020-10-13 18:31:16 Any group that is even remotely related to military vehicles is flooded pretty much instantly with weird GUP anime people and ww2 obsessives
People who fantasise ww2 germany and Soviet Russia just for there tech.. it's honestly creepy..

general 2020-10-13 23:22:23 <@456226577798135808> that's a base blueprint you can tell alot about a ship from it but nothing you wouldn't already know having built the other versions
That is really fucking annoying that that is the only one tho :/
creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:23:07 wip 2 of the blomp
creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:24:20 Its an early WIP
creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:24:39 I'm still working on the cabin and then will do the rudders and engines
creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:25:18 Diamond Metal 
I do it for big things like ship hauls because I have poor vision and it helps me see the shape better
That will be changed later
creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:26:50 I want to have 2 large billboards with like
Lights that just from the bottom of the board and light it up
Basiclly a road side billboard on the sides of the blimp

creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:28:30 Yeah
Like
creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:30:17 Yeah I intended on having a small plane on it
creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:31:16 The blimp is basically my vibe ship
Like it has a bridge a cabin maybe a small sitting area
I want it to remain unarmed.. if I make an armed version I will
creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:32:41 Same I will likely make an armed varient
creations-chat 2020-10-13 23:32:57 But I just want to make a working blimp first
creations-chat 2020-10-14 00:02:22 <@484529511468236802> bro you can't fly that in Detroit the air base is too close and they will shoot your ass down

creations-chat 2020-10-14 00:23:21 <@265819387498332160> it's really annoying.. like I want to hear 70 people all complaining about a self upvote I just want feedback on this engine
creations-chat 2020-10-14 00:25:22 Yeah
They are doing a good job
creations-chat 2020-10-14 00:26:04 I do think there are a few people who still scream about every self upvote and every troll post that just aren't delt with and I don't understand why..
creations-chat 2020-10-14 00:26:31 Yeah

creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:21:41 A bridge and cabin.. and a few other rooms.. idk
Alright I can make it shorter
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:23:32 That's true... Actually yeah I could put it up in the body wtf am I doing
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:25:05 I made the cabin super big like "oh I want all sorts of stuff in it just to chill out"
But there will be space in the envelope to do that
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:28:20 I mean I'm imagining it dosent actually take that much helium to lift stuff up in the game
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:29:49 how is this
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:30:04

general 2020-10-14 01:51:34 Send me the image I will join
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:55:02 decided to go with a bit of a more steampunk esc engine mounted behind the cabin
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:56:44 <@683847069890510887> why ew?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 01:57:57 I'm wondering if you have actual feedback or just want to show disgust while not backing that on anything
creations-chat 2020-10-14 02:00:05 Neat
creations-chat 2020-10-14 02:03:32 Rays a oof
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:06:51 Might use a slow conv engine for take off and landing as it shouldn't tilt the craft at all
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:09:34 Although the current system is janky as hell.. I don't really know how to fix it so.. it working weirdly is better then it not working at all
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:13:40 Hm?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:14:21 Uh huh..
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:14:49 Well luckily I was referring to <@491570111787040778>
creations-chat 2020-10-14 03:16:58 K

creations-chat 2020-10-14 04:16:41 I wanna make a small plane
Like
A crop duster
Or a bush plane
Any ideas for what I should make?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 13:47:54 <:tumbleweed:555390128575479841>
creations-chat 2020-10-14 13:49:40 It's a tumble weed
creations-chat 2020-10-14 13:54:38 <@209005642000760832> why does your tank have 2 motors on each wheel?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 13:57:58 I always just used the one set and then had AD together as reverse with W as forward
And A and D separately to turn
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:09:44 I'm scared
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:15:05 Germany: "what if we mount a railway gun to 2 tank chassis"
Me: "that's a really fucking stupid idea y'all are dumb af but here I am building it"
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:18:24 Thet looks amazing
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:20:57 <:sipp:741899384815616100>
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:21:38 It should
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:21:55 Why?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:22:15 Wtf does that mean
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:25:12 It flies and it's pretty impressive for it's size
I think a small impressive thing is alot harder to make then a large one
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:26:58 <@685909594932773033> I didn't say that
I said it's harder to make it impressive
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:27:54 How is that not enough it's literally hall of FAME
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:30:19 <@685909594932773033> yeah and that's stupid
The van should totally get in it's amused and impressed litteraly everyone
creations-chat 2020-10-14 14:31:39 No we all think it's pretty impressive
And even if it was the former
That should still get it in the hall of fame as it's now a famous build
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:41:45 <@456226577798135808>  lol a truer statement has never been made
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:42:04 I wanna make a crop duster
Which one should I make?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:43:10 That's not-
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:44:17 If I wanted to build a military plane it wouldn't be a crop duster
I want to build a slow ass plane
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:44:33 Which one should I build
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:45:02 Oh my fucking god shut the actual fuck up about the van
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:49:56 Technically 3 speeds
Full ahead
Stop
Full reverse
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:50:12 Yeah I'd use them as a boost
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:51:29 Some of my planes are only conv engines (mainly because I created a super stable 3 speed design that works well a as main engine and boost)
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:51:56 Like my Stuka and CA 3
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:53:01 Flappy bois
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:53:40 This is one "L" away from getting weird
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:53:57 Top
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:55:08 That would only be one laddar
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:55:34 No
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:56:03 I wanna make that one german proposal to mount one of there massive rail guns on 2 PZ4 chassis
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:56:19 Add armor and then roll it out as a tank
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:57:02 It reminds me of the gorrilaz strange times RV

Which is a thing I made once apon a time
creations-chat 2020-10-14 16:57:39 <@325875263336349696> that's what it was
The gustav cannon on 2 tonk bodies

creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:03:06 <:CertifiedMoment:570774089099116548>

creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:04:47 I'ma just... <@195253906333368320> hi yes your chat is bein bad..
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:10:53 <@335599526414909451> bro mod this shit rather then letting it go on please
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:14:05 Okay so if this is over
 what type of crop duster should I make?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:16:24 Thanks staff for attempting to help this channel not be shit post and drama central.. hopefully it gets better now..
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:27:28 Which one should I make?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:30:17 > neither
<@484529511468236802>  why? They are the 2 most common ones and they both look pretty neat..
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:48:37 Not one actual answer? This chat is useless
creations-chat 2020-10-14 17:57:43 Tell me about it -.- iv been asking for opinions on which one I should do all day
general 2020-10-14 17:58:45 > smh imagine driving to school in 2020\
<@363742162757877761> 

Imagine driving too school at all
#bording school gang
general 2020-10-14 18:00:07 <@370594904268734464> shush grammer boi
creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:00:53 The slow mode is needed to keep this chat sane.
Take your drama elsewhere
creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:22:26 > this slowmode is definitely beneficial and i hope its permanent
<@265819387498332160> 
Agreed
creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:27:43 Well see that's what happens when the only conversations you want to have are just screeming about self upvotes or drama rather then actually talking about builds. People who actually want to talk about builds will see this as what it is
A slight inconvenience in exchange for a channel we can actually use now.
creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:47:32 That moment when you take over the sky island in a tank
creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:51:04 <@456226577798135808> same
creations-chat 2020-10-14 18:53:06 It's very helpful
Notice how this chat isn't currently a shit show
creations-chat 2020-10-14 19:56:04 You know you have done right hand your small tank can brrr its way up onto the airport
creations-chat 2020-10-14 19:58:07 That too
creations-chat 2020-10-14 20:00:08 Clown town ^


It makes the chat way more tolerable
creations-chat 2020-10-14 20:06:02 I only really dislike when people downvote for either "Lazy paint" when I just like my builds colored black and pink or for "exposed mechanics" when all my stuff is kinda cyberpunk already and it honestly just adds to the esthetic
creations-chat 2020-10-14 21:03:47 How should I go about doing these bars that stabilize the wings?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 21:07:03 Yeah but I was wondering if there is some other way I should do it or just motors
Because I don't want to use alot of motor lock

What angle would you say those wings are at?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 21:15:34 He's banned from the tank musuam for a very good reason
creations-chat 2020-10-14 21:23:03 Wait isn't it possible to stick angled beams to things with cameras somehow?
If so how does one do that?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 21:27:47 <@484529511468236802> wait so if I angle a set a beam above the wing and angle it to point the right way it will angle correctly?
creations-chat 2020-10-14 22:52:11 The message quality has been significantly decreased seince the cooldown was lowered to 1 minute

Funny how that happens
creations-chat 2020-10-14 22:54:02 2 minutes and the messages people sent were far better then what is currently being sent.
It should stay up at 2 minutes
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 22:54:57 That beautiful moment when your small tank barely 5 blocks tall can scale the cliffs
creations-chat 2020-10-14 22:57:49 I would be okay with 10 minute
This shouldn't really be a general conversation channel
That's what <#384021699466756107>  is for
creations-chat 2020-10-14 23:17:02 Tf you talking about it's super cursed
That thing would flip over
creations-chat 2020-10-14 23:18:44 But they did stop
creations-chat 2020-10-15 02:15:11 My post with the most upvotes is also the one I self downvoted on.. weird
general 2020-10-15 02:16:16 My dog straight vibin
general 2020-10-15 02:16:49 What
creations-chat 2020-10-15 02:19:36 <@456226577798135808> hey how do you get it down there? I'd like to do something similar at some point
general 2020-10-15 02:20:14 It's gross... This is pretty toxic
general 2020-10-15 02:20:31 Can we take the shit posting to <#495286269459300364>
general 2020-10-15 02:21:47 My dog is now sleeping like this
general 2020-10-15 02:22:41 I've made a banshee revevent warthog and wraith.. as well as a spirit and working on a phantom..
creations-chat 2020-10-15 02:57:30 Floof List of my current projects:

Blimp

medium MBT

Bush plane

Builds I plan to work on: 

German rail gun tank proposal

Feel good inc windmill island

New AAV
Russian flying tank
creations-chat 2020-10-15 03:02:57 Was dat
creations-chat 2020-10-15 03:05:11 Also
A wood powered car
I wanna make one at some point
Those were cool
creations-chat 2020-10-15 03:32:47 So instead of building a new car
creations-chat 2020-10-15 03:34:44 I want to add a trailer to my half track that contains the wood gassification engine and champer as well as some exaust pipes  and then behind that a small wood pile
creations-chat 2020-10-15 03:37:29 It's already loosely based off a German half track so with a gassification engine It's about as "WW2 germany is desperate" as you can get.. also it brings my block count on it to 400 so I can get a rank for it
general 2020-10-15 03:56:46 Wrong thing
general 2020-10-15 03:56:47 Oop
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:06:47 What are the black parts?

Also yee it's really good
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:07:59 Mine was smoll and spammy
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:12:29 This is the ship I'm most happy with
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:15:23 Also my post with the most upvotes..
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:18:13 I'm wondering if it's like.. tacky?.. to upload all my current saves to creations as I'm new..
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:29:55 <:peep:672665425028448286>
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:32:12 Nah it's really needed
It honestly should still be 2 minutes
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:36:17 So question

Anyone else do this weird thing where any time I build a smaller boat (which is most of the time Gunboats, PT boats and torp boats are really really fun)
I have this weird desire too make it's control as accurate as possible
So rudder only
With proper speed controls and also a working anchor
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:44:33 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:50:21 Yeah I don't like having any other steering on my boats but rudder
Maybe some props in the front but only for docking and on separate controlls then the turning
creations-chat 2020-10-15 10:39:23 We don't do huge amounts of motor lock because we have blackouts from our DID and will likely not understand what it is we were building

So our builds are kinda capped in quality by that..
creations-chat 2020-10-15 10:41:36 We'll motor lock like.. the wings or tail.. small things.. but none of that shit where your entire jet looks like it went through the shredder as it sits on the build plate
creations-chat 2020-10-15 10:47:53 My skill really is capped
But to be honest I think it should make things more interesting? I have to get all my ranks like that.. so yeah.. that's not saying I don't do motor lock at all just not enough for the build to not be recognizable In Build mode
creations-chat 2020-10-15 10:49:41 I've never built a jet because they bore me.. ive built the mil v12 and an ekranoplan which both had jets though.. my first plane was a Caproni CA 3

creations-chat 2020-10-15 10:59:30 I suck at doing turrets
And the current turret on my tank is kinda ruining it
So I have been for a while considering just ripping it off adding a interior to the tank adding a boom box and peace signs all over it and 2 huge signs dangling on either side of it that says "make love not war"

Because it gets me out of ruining the cool custom body with a horrible gun

creations-chat 2020-10-15 11:03:45 I'm also too scared to get into a game with someone to have them help me with a good gun..
general 2020-10-15 11:04:17 <:sipp:741899384815616100>
general 2020-10-15 11:07:57 Why?
creations-chat 2020-10-15 11:10:11 > scaredy cat
<@433617207734304778> 

Yes I am
Because I want it to not look good but also be really good in pvp.. like well armored..
creations-chat 2020-10-15 11:11:53 I'm not supposed to motor lock for it but it bugs out whenever I try to use them
creations-chat 2020-10-15 11:14:03 Whenever I put any motor lock on a gun it bugs way the fuck out
And I can't get good with WASD the same reason I can't fly a plane with it 
My hands jitter too much
general 2020-10-15 11:16:10 Wait but fortune was here first
general 2020-10-15 11:16:19 They are actually good at the game
creations-chat 2020-10-15 11:50:38 I have no mechs
Idk how to do mechs
Even though I think Howl's moving castle would be a cool one to build
creations-chat 2020-10-15 11:57:00 Actually I upvoted it because it took a solid 2 minutes for me to realize it was huge
He did a good job replicating it which is what he set out to do so.. upvote
creations-chat 2020-10-15 11:58:41 Wait I thought we were talking about the giant tutorial plane
What carrier?
creations-chat 2020-10-15 12:00:09 What?
creations-chat 2020-10-15 12:01:53 Yeah same
That's a good job in my book
I couldn't even tell
creations-chat 2020-10-15 12:27:11 Nice
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:25:30 The only helicopters I'm good at are ones with 2 rotors fixed front and back or side by side or 1 top the other.. I'm bad at helis
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:35:27 Dis boat has no ballast tonk
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:36:43 I want to add some though

Wait really? It has alot of detail already
And I know the color is ass
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:38:19 <@543819153279287327> I have an armed varient with a front mounted gun torpedoes depth charges and mine baskets
I just don't think it looks as nice because it's so culttered in detail
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:39:20 I like how small and simple this one is
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:41:20 Also I'm still learning how to make my pallet more detailed while maintaining the "black pink girl power" thing I have.. 
I think I got there in my half track's new paint but idk
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:43:09 My Long wip submarine has a bay with 2 toothed doors that fold out and lower a mini sub
Although the mini sub is tutorial
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:44:09 I wanna make a cyclops/seamoth at some point
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:45:50 I have an ekranoplan
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:50:28 I have a 2 fold sub I've been working on for forever
 And an I-400 sub that I've been working on too
Bitch carries a sub bat for smaller subs
The I-400s is larger as I carry a Japanese mini sub while the 2 fold is smaller because I used a tutorial sub I found
I also have a Submarine tender that lifts subs up onto the deck for repairs

That's why I want to make the subnautica cyclops I could make it actually work with a seamoth bay
creations-chat 2020-10-15 15:56:21 <@484529511468236802> yeah but it's old.. before I learned motor lock
creations-chat 2020-10-15 16:04:33 I've yet to see a halo covie CAS class cruiser
And I have no guts to make anything more then a phantom
creations-chat 2020-10-15 16:05:46 No.. they are more complicated than that..
creations-chat 2020-10-15 16:16:43 Nothing ever came of this it seams...
creations-chat 2020-10-15 16:20:00 I'm blind leave me be
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:21:03 Why are all the things I want to build so mundane
I'm working on a crop duster and a cement truck
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:28:15 Is motor lock even a glitch at this point? I feel like this is just a bathesda type situation where what started out as a glitch can't be removed because it makes the game better
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:29:23 Use
Exploasives to stop the motors from locking
Use a second motor to rotate it to where you want it
Then lock it by exploading the tnt 
Keep the exploasives set to 0 of course
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:32:08 What type of cement truck should I do? Front or back loaders?
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:38:21 <@716757923103244348> basically is the cement poored from the front or back
Front would probably be easiest tbf
creations-chat 2020-10-15 17:49:22 Still learning how to paint and do that whole thing
I'm Slowly re painting slot of my old builds... But I like my black and pink theme so that's staying I'm just adding more texture and varient too it
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:05:47 Y'all just gotta chill
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:12:11 Can I come to brazil
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:13:45 I'm working on it
Haz to add gassification chamber to half track

Even though I could use my 900 block tank I really wanna do it with my half track
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:14:46 ^
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:15:47 Real helpful -.-
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:20:40 Dats piston
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:22:56 The piston suspension never works for my stuff.. tho my stuff may just be too smoll
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:33:41 So spinny one or not spinny one
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:35:00 I think the spinny ones look cooler so probably spinny...
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:36:18 Dis one seems easy enough
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:38:00 The extra wheels that push down are going to be.. intresting... 

<@716757923103244348> I don't intend on having anything poor out it's not going to be anywhere near big enough.. I don't like making big things because we as a system just don't have the focus
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:41:45 That moment when your low rider is larger then any tank I've ever built
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:44:56 I love that
creations-chat 2020-10-15 18:45:57 Yeah they are weird trucks that you never really think about.. which is why I think it will be fun to make one
creations-chat 2020-10-15 19:05:26 <@484529511468236802> no offense or anything.. I'm terrible at detail so I'm nobody to talk.. but I think the lights could be better.. they are a pretty big feature it's important they look good..
creations-chat 2020-10-15 19:25:19 <@484529511468236802> I like the caseing.. can you make the top of it have control surfaces so there is a gap in the middle too? And then add a spot light behind a white cilinder for the lights...?
creations-chat 2020-10-15 19:28:05 Yeah that way it looks like the metal bars that cover them in the reference.. it looks really good
creations-chat 2020-10-15 19:32:38 What?
creations-chat 2020-10-15 19:35:42 Ooo... Okay that looks awesome
Like completely
Those are awesome
creations-chat 2020-10-15 19:37:41 Wait is the thing in top a window?
creations-chat 2020-10-15 20:25:50 Oof
creations-chat 2020-10-15 20:28:26 Hahahaha seeing his builds it honestly yes
creations-chat 2020-10-15 20:29:55 <@456226577798135808> is honestly one of my favorite builders here.. I just love boats and he builds the boats I don't have focus too and it's amazing
Good job dude
creations-chat 2020-10-15 20:31:25 Yes-
creations-chat 2020-10-15 21:29:26 I want to build my favorite fictonal airship ever
The spirit of adventure from the movie UP
It's my favorite because it's ridiculous be it well designed in such a way it feels like it could be a real airship

Anyways
The airship carries at least 9 planes but I can't identify them.. can anyone else?
creations-chat 2020-10-15 21:32:43 *what?*
creations-chat 2020-10-15 21:37:03 It really is beautiful
creations-chat 2020-10-15 21:38:06 They make sense when you consider where the aircraft are stored and how that would effect weight
I'm excited to do this
That's a 4 fold blimp
creations-chat 2020-10-15 21:39:30 If probably won't be complete for weeks because I'm an idiot with no focus
creations-chat 2020-10-15 21:42:13 We're a DID system... Big complicated builds are so hard for us
creations-chat 2020-10-16 01:42:17 Everyone: this fighter jet is-
Me: crop duster go brrrrr
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:03:00 <@484529511468236802> eee that's amazing
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:04:15 The hell? That looks amazing idk what they are on about
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:07:42 I can't even complete a small blimp but I want to do the spirt of adventure

Im going to get the interior right too
Which means big musuam full of ze bones
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:09:07 Honestly that musuam is going to be one of 2 hardest part
The other part is fitting 9 planes into it with a way to load and unload them
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:11:52 Big ol blomp
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:13:06 Adventure's out there

Also what's the reference plane <@484529511468236802>?
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:14:07 Oo
Foldy boy

Your nose looks a little wonky..
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:15:49 <@378381569645084672> yeah I agree
Zeplins are super uncanny just in there size and how out of place they actually look
These things are fucking massive
And they float barely keeping from just blowing away
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:18:15 It's just insane that this massive structure

Is lighter then you
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:23:07 So I decided to look into the real airship aircraft carrier
And uh

This was no help in couldn't find an explanation of the mechanisms that pulled the planes up or loaded them or anything..
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:24:10 These images are not the most helpful...
They are only the system to get the planes in and out of the blimp

But that's the easiest part..
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:26:47 Also I think we identified the planes
Because this definitely makes the most sense given the location and whatnot of the film and we know pixar did there research
creations-chat 2020-10-16 02:28:24 The house is boring
Fuck the house
I want to build the mile long aircraft carrying dinosaur musuam in the sky blimp
creations-chat 2020-10-16 04:43:33 I think I should start detailing now
creations-chat 2020-10-16 04:46:38 ^
creations-chat 2020-10-16 04:48:00 Has anyone made a proper ratte
With all of its guns working
And an interior including a vehicle bay for light trucks
creations-chat 2020-10-16 04:49:12 Cus I see half finished ones all the time
Where they add the guns and doors but there is no internal bay and none of the other buns but the big ones actually work
creations-chat 2020-10-16 04:52:53 I learn how to do things for the weirdest reasons
I want to build the spirt of adventure so I'm learning blimps
When I get around to doing howl's moving castle I'm going to learn how to make it walk.. and I that's going to be fun
creations-chat 2020-10-16 04:54:03 I don't think Howl's moving castle has been built
I really really want to do it
It's my second favorite movie
creations-chat 2020-10-16 05:03:37 Is it spammy to put firework turrets on the bottom of the blimp?
creations-chat 2020-10-16 06:39:20 Is there any better way to make a small wood pile?
creations-chat 2020-10-16 06:42:16 Alright

creations-chat 2020-10-16 22:24:53 wdyt?
creations-chat 2020-10-16 23:07:21 Getting closer to done
creations-chat 2020-10-17 04:24:26 Do different materials have different weights?
creations-chat 2020-10-17 04:25:45 Ight
creations-chat 2020-10-17 04:26:53 Are they the same weight? <@484529511468236802>
creations-chat 2020-10-17 04:28:54 Alright
And then ice is slippery
Fabric is extra friction.. anything else?

creations-chat 2020-10-18 01:09:22 this guy in a rocket spamming turret just said "this noob needs to learn how to use real bombs rather then strapping rockets onto his plane"

but.. uh..

this was my plane
creations-chat 2020-10-18 01:12:16 <@!265819387498332160> it's rocket rosie.  it was a spotter plane that the pilot strapped bazookas to
creations-chat 2020-10-18 01:44:42 I have many many questions
creations-chat 2020-10-18 02:19:42 <@456226577798135808> I'ma get in and make it furry water ōwō
creations-chat 2020-10-18 02:21:48 Doubt
creations-chat 2020-10-18 03:46:24 I need help
creations-chat 2020-10-18 03:47:42 Like
Okay
I'm bad at airplanes.. especially small ones.. 

And I want help designing a small parasite fighter with actual decent control and Ballance..
That can be launched from an airship based off of these things
creations-chat 2020-10-18 08:38:04 Idec it's getting downvoted I'm so proud of my little grasshopper it's so fun to fly
creations-chat 2020-10-18 08:50:42 What the fuck
creations-chat 2020-10-19 00:58:59 I decided I want some form of "vibe mobile"
Not just unarmed.. but much like my boat it's unarmed with the necessary things for me to live out of it
I.e a cabin and some sitting areas and storage
I could do something like an RV but I think it would be cooler to make some form of military vehicle
creations-chat 2020-10-19 01:14:10 Anyone have a design for windowed hatches in tanks?
creations-chat 2020-10-19 02:05:11 My tank destroyer is now named named pussaiii killa
creations-chat 2020-10-19 02:35:18 I'd like that role
creations-chat 2020-10-19 05:33:11 I drew a thing.. didn't know where to post it..
creations-chat 2020-10-19 05:34:12 What would have been the right channel?
creations-chat 2020-10-19 05:35:59 It's based off of one of my builds 
I tried making an h8k
Failed
But made a super cool looking plane anyways
Then drew it
creations-chat 2020-10-19 05:46:37 This is going to seem super odd
But anyone got any ideas for a small scale cheracter sized keyboard? Like the music instrument
creations-chat 2020-10-19 11:46:37 Can anyone find what this thing is actually supposed to be? I built it based off of a vehicle in the music video for gorrilaz dirty harry
But I don't know what the actual truck is called
creations-chat 2020-10-19 11:51:13 Subnautica had cutscenes??
creations-chat 2020-10-19 16:53:32 Me: I'm bored I'ma make weird armored truck from gorrilaz music video
PCC: Let's have this be your most upvoted thing for some fucking reason?
creations-chat 2020-10-19 16:54:32 I'm already blind
Light mode has better contast

creations-chat 2020-10-20 01:34:22 The time has come
creations-chat 2020-10-20 02:42:31 Best part about making the ratte
I can make the small details whatever the fuck I want
creations-chat 2020-10-20 04:21:29 I understand why the ratte was called "a land Cruiser"
Driving just the suspension around it feels the same as sailing a large ship
You can be going 300 speed and it feels like not going anywhere
creations-chat 2020-10-20 04:25:19 It goes fast it's just so big it doesn't feel like it
creations-chat 2020-10-20 04:26:38 I just realized
The motors are set to speed 15

*It can get faster*
creations-chat 2020-10-20 04:28:22 What exactly is your problem?.. I'm saying it can get faster then it already is and it already is too fast
creations-chat 2020-10-20 07:36:59 Something about this cross section is so fucking satisfying
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:17:03 The bulbous bow
The second best mechanical term
First being the droop snoop
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:24:35 Weird water line.. also no rudder? How do you intend on steering that?
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:25:49 I like how people still complain about up/downvotes like bruh
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:27:31 Because the mini is plane took more effort to detail get looking right as well as just being controllable.
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:28:54 There is alot of effort in that and it takes far far more then 5-15 minutes. Building things at a smaller scale makes it harder as you have to still detail it well and have it be controllable at that small scale
creations-chat 2020-10-20 08:30:32 It looks good? I don't see anything wrong with that build that diserves a downvote. Your only comeplaint is that it's small. That's not a valid complaint

Also <@456226577798135808> looks good
creations-chat 2020-10-20 09:27:08 the turret is getting big enough that it will have 2 floors inside of it and a ladder going from the main tank too the turret
creations-chat 2020-10-20 09:32:22 I think this is the first ground vehicle I will make where the interior will take longer then the exterior and mechanics.
creations-chat 2020-10-20 09:33:36 <@720891502108344360> how is what possible? The ladder? You just make the entire space around the turret open so that the ladder turns around the inside of the tank without hitting anything
creations-chat 2020-10-20 09:40:09 <@720891502108344360> no the turret itself has too floors
Tge screenshot Is a floor below the turret and on the "top deck" of the tank
And below that there are 2 floors within the tank
Also to explain the ladder thing
creations-chat 2020-10-20 09:41:17 No? I'm also building a ratte -.- I just have never built a ground vehicle this big
creations-chat 2020-10-20 12:48:10 Tank turret is chonk
creations-chat 2020-10-20 12:56:59 Those are cool helis!
creations-chat 2020-10-20 12:58:30 Oh
Wait
I thought they were original.. even if they are modified tutorials they look really cool so good job
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:01:34 <@543819153279287327> I had some fun with it
We don't really know what it would have looked like beyond vauge shape and it's gun
I wanted to make mine a tad different then most
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:04:06 Yeah see I ditched the "battleship turret" design and decided to.. basically upscale a tank turret to radiculois scale.. and I think it looks pretty cool
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:05:53 Pretty much
The duel gun is required for it to be a ratte..

Also the body is not detailed at all
I built it's shell and the gun and the door for the vehicle bay and then turned it off because my head started to hurt
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:07:45 I still really like that you can climb up into the turret from the tank through a ladder in the gun well
I've never built a tank big enough to do that before so that was exciting
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:10:36 I'm super sceptical of this thing being any use in pvp.. so I think I'm just going to make it as fun to drive around in non pvp and pvp both as possible
creations-chat 2020-10-20 13:24:09 Satisfying cutaway~
creations-chat 2020-10-20 20:15:41 Is the game safe? I don't want to work on my ratte if it might be deleted..
creations-chat 2020-10-20 20:17:35 When did it start..?
creations-chat 2020-10-20 20:20:37 Oh
Okay
I was sleeping
I should be fine
creations-chat 2020-10-20 20:36:49 Oop. I censored the word the first time then right after said it. Danm I'm stupid
creations-chat 2020-10-20 20:40:22 When I was building my ratte someone came up and said I needed to add a big `no no star`because you can't call it a German super tank without one...
creations-chat 2020-10-20 20:49:12 *it's really weird too see a German cross on a non ww2 tank my brain kinda farts whenever I stumble across it*
creations-chat 2020-10-20 20:50:13 The moon by now
Probably
It's mush
creations-chat 2020-10-20 20:52:32 Yeah but I don't like modern tanks as much as older ones and it's always amusing for my brain to remember "oh yeah.. heh.. they are still a country that has tanks"
creations-chat 2020-10-20 20:58:35 You know what would be cool to make
An Arctic research center
Basiclly
A giant rolling research station with a vehicle bay for snow mobiles
creations-chat 2020-10-20 21:05:15 Also I need help designing a small truck too fit in my vehicle bay of the ratte
creations-chat 2020-10-20 21:06:52 I just need to Know how to do suspension and such as it has to be under 5 blocks tall and 7 blocks wide
creations-chat 2020-10-20 21:36:16 Might make a ladder up the side of the gun like this.. though I really like the overlooks so the gunnery commander can get a clear view
general 2020-10-20 21:47:36 Danm show off <@195253906333368320>
general 2020-10-20 21:47:39 Lol
general 2020-10-20 21:49:56 I just noticed your pfp had a witch hat and that's adorable
creations-chat 2020-10-20 23:31:20 The mechanism to make these back guns work was such a pain. a super complicated toggle stop so that they both can point forward or backwards but don't get stuck
creations-chat 2020-10-21 00:38:03 Vehicle bay.. should be able to fit a truck and and a few gollioths.. not detailed yet
creations-chat 2020-10-21 02:28:57 
creations-chat 2020-10-21 02:29:58 It's not going to stay like that I'm using that so I can see better
creations-chat 2020-10-21 02:31:54 But what do you think if it as a vehicle bay?
creations-chat 2020-10-21 02:47:30 fuck it. more cannons
creations-chat 2020-10-21 02:48:36 yeah fair. I just backlist everyone
creations-chat 2020-10-21 02:50:21 *litterally just adding ship cannons at this point*
creations-chat 2020-10-21 04:19:39 *needs more gun*
creations-chat 2020-10-21 04:22:04 on which ones? top i used trail bottom i used sparklers
creations-chat 2020-10-21 05:15:18 It's basically done just needs to me material-ed?.. and painted
creations-chat 2020-10-21 05:17:18 Yeah.. pretty much
creations-chat 2020-10-21 05:19:10 I'm not really that intrested in keeping accurate to the most generally accepted version of a very very very vauge tank proposal
creations-chat 2020-10-21 09:06:44 I'm starting to run out of keys for my ratte
Anyone have a good "extra keys" thing that works for plane crazy?
creations-chat 2020-10-21 09:07:46 Keys on your keyboard
I've run out of buttons to push and I still have more stuff to control
creations-chat 2020-10-21 09:12:03 No there are too many it lags out the game

The guns (fake and real) on the left and right side each have there own key controls.
 The rear guns and AA are mouse control.
The front AT gun is mouse control.

The main turret is button control.

The whole thing stears with WASDEQ.

The 3 Gollioth tracked mines stored in it's vehicle bay use arrow keys.

The vehicle bay door uses keys.

The truck  that sits in the bay uses keys.

The trucks gun uses mouse.
creations-chat 2020-10-21 09:13:43 I want to add controls for 2 guided missiles stored in silos but I have run out of good keys
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:23:36 Cool graphic I found
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:25:31 It's a graphic because it's displaying the process of something via simplification
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:28:00 So apparently
It was a common thing for Battleships turrets too not actually be connected to the ship.. like.. they were held on rollers by gravity but there was nothing holding them down.. if you were to pick up the ship it's massive turrets would just fall out.. that's.. kinda wack.. apparently the bismarck's were thrown off like that
I knew the bismarck's were thrown off but I assumed that like.. it was because water pressure blowing them out or something
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:33:51 Can someone show me how to make the iorn cross in wing pannels
I've seen it done I just need to know how
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:34:56 <@708185644706431038> yeah I knew that I just need a screenshot of the layout of it.
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:36:32 <a:Pet:704326955507646565>
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:38:18 Ah okay
Thank you
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:39:34 The iorn cross isn't a bad symbol? It's still used today?
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:41:02 ?
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:46:50 I hate that b17 tutorial
It's not even good
Lmao
creations-chat 2020-10-22 00:49:39 Superior japanese engineering go brrr
general 2020-10-22 00:51:00 <a:Pet:704326955507646565>
creations-chat 2020-10-22 01:57:27 I'm going to be doing the paint for my ratte.. what paint should I do? I don't want to do this this looks hella boring
creations-chat 2020-10-22 01:58:50 Well I don't want to do an all grey paint I hate the look of it.. and also it's the most common one I see..
creations-chat 2020-10-22 02:01:16 <@551806781609869313> yeah 
Any tank paint scheme will work..
Because the common "grey" wasn't a paint it was lack of paint.
creations-chat 2020-10-22 02:02:31 I hate it being grey -.-
creations-chat 2020-10-22 02:03:30 I might make a custom paint...
creations-chat 2020-10-22 02:06:18 It's not painted or even given the right materials yes I intended to do that

Also my ratte is supposed to look diffrent then the super common depiction of it which I think I succeeded with
The side guns on mine are almost reminiscent of a battleship
creations-chat 2020-10-22 02:11:21 Also mine has a vehicle bay which I've never seen in another ratte 
So I'm proud of dat
creations-chat 2020-10-22 05:25:39 Can you use tnt for guns to fire other things?
creations-chat 2020-10-22 05:35:59 <@221487880487436288> a better what?
creations-chat 2020-10-22 05:37:24 In an hour? With how detailed this one is I doubt it..
creations-chat 2020-10-22 06:12:39 Someone is bragging about how big there complex is when it looks from the outside like a fucking borg cube mf mine may not be as big but it moves
creations-chat 2020-10-22 06:20:41 Alright
One monstrosity down
One more too go-
help 2020-10-22 06:57:43 I need a design for a compact motor bike.. I want to fit it within my ratte
creations-chat 2020-10-22 09:10:02 wdyt of my lil truck?
creations-chat 2020-10-22 10:00:21 should I add search lights too my ratte?
creations-chat 2020-10-22 10:13:08 <@581846949901369365> I have ratte that I never seem to be finished with
creations-chat 2020-10-22 10:14:09 Hull and then mechanics (IE. Rudder, steering, ballast and engine)
general 2020-10-22 11:07:53 Yay I haz rank!
general 2020-10-22 11:08:16 It took 4 days but mf I got a rank <a:rave:549745590284845077>

general 2020-10-22 14:18:17 How did you access the rank VIP servers?
general 2020-10-22 14:18:46 I see
bot-central 2020-10-22 14:20:06 !expertservers
creations-chat 2020-10-22 14:23:14 I'm dreading a new map because it means there might be a bridge and my ratte may be exposed for what it is-
creations-chat 2020-10-22 14:39:34 *Its bigger then my ratte*
creations-chat 2020-10-22 14:49:24 > wtf why would you make a ratte so small
<@685909594932773033> 
It's roughly to scale of a roblox cheracter but it's smaller then most as I play on a fucking potato
creations-chat 2020-10-22 14:52:11 Because I used wedge blocks for some of the corners. I've considered changing it but.. honestly it's a long list of things I need to do it's still a wip
creations-chat 2020-10-22 15:06:25 How do you do the thing where it shows the borders for blocks?
creations-chat 2020-10-22 15:07:42 Ah.. they are helpfull for some things tbh.. ships hauls especially.. which is why I kinda wanted them
creations-chat 2020-10-22 15:20:48 CA. 3
creations-chat 2020-10-22 15:40:07 I love pissing people off by saying they have sexy ikea jets
creations-chat 2020-10-22 15:41:28 I think the smallest you can get is 3×1
creations-chat 2020-10-22 15:46:42 I made my AA look better
creations-chat 2020-10-22 15:50:03 I understood none of that..
creations-chat 2020-10-22 15:55:37 That's kinda what I was actually going for.. I love the kugelblitz for a really dumb reason..
creations-chat 2020-10-22 15:58:17 The front of sparklers stick to things?

Also I really like the idea of the ratte having these turrets over the other AA.. they look awesome
creations-chat 2020-10-22 16:03:19 Yeah it's awesome
That and it's moving on a tank
creations-chat 2020-10-22 16:41:12 alright I am happy with this AA
creations-chat 2020-10-22 16:44:17 *the original vauge concept didn't specify maus turrets (though I am considering adding them.. idk...) and I like the kugelblitz AA more.*
creations-chat 2020-10-22 16:56:52 <@484529511468236802> hi yes may I scale that down for my vehicle bay on my rat?
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:02:28 As much as I hate the idea of the maus having 2 ratte turrets.. I'm not going to stop being given shit for not having them huh.. ughhhhh ok I'll see how it looks..
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:06:43 As I said.. I hate that depiction of it.. also *I'm keeping the kugelblitz turrets they are amazing you shush*
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:09:37 They feel like ship turrets and I am trying really hard to lean into the land warship feel
The back turrets are the only thing I might change even though I fucking hate the idea of it having maus turrets
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:11:14 Agggghhhhh
But that interpretation of it is soooo badddddddd ahhhhh ok
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:18:36 <@484529511468236802> also the kugelblitz is cook because it was a ball turret
The gunner moved with the gun so if the gun was verticle he faced upwards too.
And it was on a panzer 4 body so he had to do that while already moving
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:28:25 <@456226577798135808> yeah
But the 2 maus turrets are compleatly fucking random and I hate them being there
If they were going to add more tank turrets they would be something more manageable then the maus's.
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:37:38 <@!484529511468236802> I hate you. and I hate everything about this.. but it does look alright.. so..
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:38:48 UGGGHHHHHH I THUGHT THE SIDES WERE AGHH OK
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:40:16 also they look oversized because my maus is kinda small
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:41:46 I don't. I hate tanks. I just want a fucking ratte
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:43:50 As to why the whole thing is smaller it's because I don't want a fold in it.. I play on a potato.
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:51:10 Well.. either a cog using wing pannels.. or pistons.. niether are compact...
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:54:02 <@484529511468236802> bro I'm sorry for the butchering of the maus turrets I'm 2 days without sleep and I thought the sides were flat
creations-chat 2020-10-22 17:55:38 I am
I promise
I'm also making them angled outwards from the sides like a smart mammal rather then the stupid shit I was doing trying to fold the barrel down
creations-chat 2020-10-22 18:01:41 You ever just notice that one thing that would not be hard to fix but you keep passing it off as "nobody will notice so why bother" but you notice and it hurts your soul?
creations-chat 2020-10-22 18:03:39 ||the 2 machine guns on the front are off||
creations-chat 2020-10-22 18:04:55 It hurts. And I have no intent on fixing it rn.
creations-chat 2020-10-22 18:14:59 alright
creations-chat 2020-10-22 18:16:00 <@484529511468236802> here is your turret ree
creations-chat 2020-10-22 18:17:17 Because fuck you that's why 
I need to cover up the locking mechanism of the gun
creations-chat 2020-10-23 04:23:26 
creations-chat 2020-10-23 04:24:52 *Your torpedo carrier needs to worry about my tank*
creations-chat 2020-10-23 04:45:23 <@484529511468236802>
creations-chat 2020-10-23 04:46:33 <@484529511468236802> yeah I want to add something there but I don't know what..
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:39:13 For clerification the Pz4 is so small and cute lil bab because I wanted to be able to fit it in my ratte's vehicle bay
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:45:02 Why
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:46:44 I kinda like how long it is.. it counteracts the massive gun I decided to stick on
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:47:54 Idc about downvotes I was explaining why I left it be long boi
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:39:21 Ehhh I might remake my Pz 4
I mean my current one is OP but... Like.. it kinda looks terrible
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:41:12 <@456226577798135808> YES I fucking love that thing
It's so stupid looking I love it
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:42:22 
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:49:13 Why do people keep coming up to my builds and saying they are shit because they don't have "custom suspension"
Like
They work just fine without your fancy shit wtf you want
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:54:03 <@484529511468236802> I do have piston suspension on my ratte.. I don't on any other builds.. what is it I don't understand it.
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:57:04 <@484529511468236802> this is the suspension for my ratte.. it's the only custom suspension I know off..
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:58:05 How the fu- how does that work?..
creations-chat 2020-10-23 19:02:25 Also 
Fun fact
The ratte's back ramp likes to get stuck on shit
So I have the wheels set to lift the entire body 4 blocks all
When I do so it moves the wheels inwards and so it kinda looks like it's tippy toeing.. the wheels still work like that too so it gives it alot of clearance. But it's much funnier to just leave it anchored like that and afk with ratte rippytowed
creations-chat 2020-10-23 19:49:33 <@484529511468236802> I might make a more compact version of that.. it's pretty danm cool.. like a modern version of the hwatcha are you adding actual rockets?
creations-chat 2020-10-23 20:10:18 There should be a role that blocks people from having a vote staff can use on mass downvoters
creations-chat 2020-10-24 04:49:07 <@591167008855556096> is that supposed to be the gustav gun or the monstur super ultra heavy tank version of it?
creations-chat 2020-10-24 04:51:36 The monster is cool
Though the "isn't the gustav gun on a ratte body" interpritation of it is fucking stupid
I like the idea it would have been mounted on 2 panzer 4 bodies and then heavily armored and giveore guns and AA
creations-chat 2020-10-24 04:58:35 The largest I've built is a light frigate lol
creations-chat 2020-10-24 14:30:45 My Russian tank kicks up snow and I find it endlessly amusing
creations-chat 2020-10-24 14:35:54 It's also pretty convincing.. combined with the tiny bits of smoke around the engine and the gun it looks like heat radiating off of it in the cold winter
creations-chat 2020-10-24 16:35:03 Why the downvotes on my mark 4 <@480746414293647360> (this isn't a complaint this is me asking because I want to work on it but don't know what else to add)
creations-chat 2020-10-24 16:37:08 Oh shit I did 
Sorry Idk why my computer does that so often..
creations-chat 2020-10-24 17:01:25 I mean.. I just looked at a refrence and my mark 4 is the right width the bars are just a bit big.. so..
the-dump 2020-10-24 19:22:06 
creations-chat 2020-10-24 21:09:43 How can a tank with no armor and no guns sit in spawn and destroy other builds at range..?
creations-chat 2020-10-24 21:11:14 Well I'm going to prove that wrong
creations-chat 2020-10-24 21:12:47 Nope

creations-chat 2020-10-25 06:29:15 They really are
Pree dreadnoughts are iornclads with more guns
Like
Basically gun Spam
creations-chat 2020-10-25 06:30:19 It seems odd for it to be in the ocean
creations-chat 2020-10-25 06:41:09 I tried to make it look like an actual ww1 photo
I think I did pretty well lmao
creations-chat 2020-10-25 06:46:32 I kinda like the look of "spam" dreadnoughts with there buldges and tons of guns
creations-chat 2020-10-25 07:01:33 I think I broke my colorizer
creations-chat 2020-10-25 07:17:35 I want to make a Maginot line bunker turret? Do you think I could motor lock the whole thing into the ground and still have the fun move up and down?
creations-chat 2020-10-25 07:18:58 Or if it raise the gun up will it not be able to come back down??
creations-chat 2020-10-25 07:21:57 But the terrain would have to be towering making it kinda pointless
I want to have it clip into the ground and just do a small clearing of custom terrain
creations-chat 2020-10-25 10:38:43 how would I go about doing these bars on this turret?
creations-chat 2020-10-25 10:45:42 ehhhhh idk
creations-chat 2020-10-25 11:26:48 Can someone 1st explain to me how to motor lock builds into the ground.. and second say if this gun would work sticking up top from a motor locked bunker or not
creations-chat 2020-10-25 11:28:07 <@738702049113538600> wdym? Like stuff won't move?
creations-chat 2020-10-25 11:30:15 No they won't..? You can clip stuff into the ground and have stuff down there I just don't know how it works
I want to clip a bunker down there and have a "pop up" Maginot line turret
creations-chat 2020-10-25 11:31:51 You motor lock it into the ground and anchor it
I've seen it done before but I don't know how you do it
Someone did it with an among us map
creations-chat 2020-10-25 11:33:44 Yeah but that doesn't matter if your seat is in the build 
I want to know if having a section of it aviubr the ground
With that turret would work
creations-chat 2020-10-25 17:01:30 My builds sometimes get 54 upvotes and then other times get 2 at about the same quality of build.. it's weird but eh
creations-chat 2020-10-25 17:03:32 Mmm
Colorized images of panzers are sexy af
creations-chat 2020-10-25 17:10:27 *it's starting to look like a real photo lmao*
creations-chat 2020-10-25 17:11:42 I want cillendrical tnt
creations-chat 2020-10-25 17:48:35 I think it's a good start!
creations-chat 2020-10-25 18:25:29 The "snow tracks" have a weird benefit of Making anyone that hits them experience a lag spikes and flip over
And it happens before shredders cut so shredder bugs can't hit my wheels
creations-chat 2020-10-25 18:31:40 <@484529511468236802> your pfp makes me happy
I just like happy doggos
general 2020-10-25 18:49:09 I should stop editing pictures of my builds
general 2020-10-25 18:51:26 <@697893501274161325> yeah it would have
This tank was kinda made in anticipation for that which is why it has all the snow stuff
It's my first winter event so I'm excited to see how the map changes as I have tried not to look into it too much
general 2020-10-25 18:52:05 It actually does kick up some snow
general 2020-10-25 18:52:36 IS 2
general 2020-10-25 18:53:16 Yeah... I'm bad at turrets.. idk what to fix on it.. I just know it looks wrong..
general 2020-10-25 18:54:05 Alright..
general 2020-10-25 18:55:48 I like that tank
general 2020-10-25 18:55:55 I have a long list of tanks I need to make
general 2020-10-25 18:56:43 But everytime I start I get unmotivated and either switch to a different alter and they log off the game or work on one of my existing tanks.. which is why all my stuff is over detailed
general 2020-10-25 18:57:19 Ik.. I just don't know how
general 2020-10-25 18:57:52 Also
general 2020-10-25 18:58:03 Keep in mind
general 2020-10-25 18:59:10 The treads and gaurds where originally 1 block so the tank turret was about the right size.. now it's too small because I made it wider to play with the tracks
general 2020-10-25 19:00:27 I based it off the GUP model which had a weird hatch thing that lifted up to expose the engine and was propped up?.. idk.. I tried to be replicate that
general 2020-10-25 19:01:52 Agreed actually
But the Russian stuff in it is halarious so I did that one
general 2020-10-25 19:13:10 <@484529511468236802> hey when you say rounder do you mean wider or taller?
general 2020-10-25 19:28:05 Hey I'm Japanese can you not -.-
general 2020-10-25 19:29:05 No I'm mad because of what rieperal said
general 2020-10-25 19:29:22 Yeah but it's still offensive even if you aren't referring to me..
general 2020-10-25 19:31:34 It was..
general 2020-10-25 19:34:22 You don't have to hate someone to say something racist or even just offensive in general..
creations-chat 2020-10-25 19:37:07 turret upgrade
creations-chat 2020-10-25 20:31:01 That seems like a pretty bad idea
creations-chat 2020-10-25 20:32:11 I mean.. what about invisible blocks in PVP?
creations-chat 2020-10-25 20:33:30 Eh.. I like the idea to be able to toggle motors invisible
Nothing else though..
creations-chat 2020-10-25 20:34:52 <@484529511468236802> what do you think of the new turret?
creations-chat 2020-10-25 20:36:45 I ping <@484529511468236802> òuó
creations-chat 2020-10-25 20:38:51 I took the snow rope thingies off my tank.. because while they looked really good they slowed it down and it already only has a max speed of 123

<@484529511468236802> I can't.. I'm super tired and I'm going to try start going to bed so my laptop is off..
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:50:21 <@530364247646011402> I have one
It loads torps in the back and moves them to the front to be fired from tubes
It's not finished or painted or detailed so you get no peaks.
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:10:52 I want to make an abram.. but they are so popular if I fuck it up it will be constantly called out.. and I don't think I'm good enough to not fuck it up.. anyone know of a Russian or Chinese or just.. any equivalent tank? Like a tank of the same era same kinda idea but not the abram..
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:14:08 Ooh.. what's with it's lights? I feel like I've seen these around too but hopefully they aren't so common mine will be called shit for some tiny thing by everyone and there mom..
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:18:32 Wow.. it looks so weirdly sleek.. like I kinda like it but it's weird.. it looks so.. modern..ehh
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:19:47 *no*
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:21:24 I'm not bored of popular tanks it's just whenever I build them People go "well it's missing this detail I saw some other one with so bad"
And it just sucks
I might do the T 90
I want to do cold war tanks and modern ish ones as I've mostly done ww2 stuff..
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:23:24 No it just sucks being held to extreamly high standereds because so many people have made something that your's isn't remarkable

<@530364247646011402> I already made that
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:25:44 That's not a-
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:26:56 I was thinking about doing that one
But it looks similar enough to the abram I can see people assuming it's just a really bad abram..
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:30:29 I wanna make a working BT-5 at some point too..
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:31:30 I recently started one but I got bored fell asleep and didn't save it
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:34:15 Soviet tanks kind all look the same
And I like it.. they all have the same esthetic
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:38:34 I think it goes a little bit beyond just the gun
Because I'm including cold war tanks too
They all feel kind of similar it's interesting to me as someone who is into art and design.. how an interwar tank and a cold war tank can feel so similar
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:40:08 Yeah
I really like there smaller ones 
With all the guns and little nobs and whistles exposed
All the little variens of the tankettes.. it's cool
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:42:34 I mean..
No
Other countries just weren't very special and the things russia "copied" were just them feeling the same ground for how to do the whole tank thing as others countries
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:44:42 Wikipedia even does it saying that the Russian flying tank was based off of it's allies Flying tanks
Which.. no? They don't source this either...
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:47:03 My IS 2 was originally a KV 2 lol
I russianed into a Is 2

creations-chat 2020-10-26 07:53:14 For planes? Because building any kind of pontoon boat is terrible
creations-chat 2020-10-26 07:54:48 What the fu- what kind of boats are you building?
creations-chat 2020-10-26 07:57:40 Oh
Okay that might be fair
The largest boat I've made was a 2 fold JMDF MHDD and a 2 fold frigate
creations-chat 2020-10-26 08:37:19 Can someone explain how you do custom suspension?..
creations-chat 2020-10-26 08:39:20 That doesn't explain anything
creations-chat 2020-10-26 09:05:36 Stop calling me out!
creations-chat 2020-10-26 10:02:17 <@524324517431214100> I was doing it to see if someone would notice
I'll fix it lol
creations-chat 2020-10-26 10:04:07 Idk I thought it would be amusing to see how long it took for someone to notice
Not that long apparently
About an hour
creations-chat 2020-10-26 13:20:12 Wtf?
creations-chat 2020-10-26 13:21:13 Okay
No fuck you I need light mode because I'm blind..

creations-chat 2020-10-26 18:59:51 *which is good because I don't have an answer*
creations-chat 2020-10-26 19:01:13 <@456226577798135808> because.. uh.. ***uh***
creations-chat 2020-10-26 19:05:58 *Yes?*
creations-chat 2020-10-26 19:07:29 I don't see anything wrong with this
*All my tanks look this bad*
creations-chat 2020-10-26 20:15:01 Does the ocean freeze for the winter update? I know it snows
I don't know anything else
Does the snow and the ice act differently on your vehicle or..?
creations-chat 2020-10-26 20:17:26 Cool
I'ma do that thing I see people doing in the winter here (we live on a great lake so our backyard ends in water) where idiots drive there semi trucks out onto the ice on big planks of wood as skis and ice fish off of them
creations-chat 2020-10-26 21:15:22 What does thickness and restitution do to ropes?
creations-chat 2020-10-26 21:17:58 Oo
Okay
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:14:41 how is this suspension looking? it's fairly compact and I intend on using it for a panzer 4 *x3*
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:19:00 Trust me
I had to make a single color coded version in the corner of my plot because I kept getting confused as I worked on it
So whenever I would tinker with it I would update the guide so that I knew how it would be..
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:21:10 I'm sure there is some better way of doing it and I'm doing something wrong
But I'm a complete noob and so I'm pretty proud of getting this far with little help from anything as a guide
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:25:42 Wtf are you on a paragraph is 8 sentences. Or are you one of those "it's longer then 7 words I won't read it" people...
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:36:18 What in ze fek
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:41:18 <@462077072399925250> what?
general 2020-10-26 22:45:58 I think I finally understand the logic behind noob spam "block" tanks
general 2020-10-26 22:55:46 > since when did general became the dump

general 2020-10-27 10:48:02 
general 2020-10-27 10:48:19 You do this in plane crazy and one of you is getting flung by suspension
creations-chat 2020-10-27 21:46:53 I'm making a new ratte more closely based in the source material (where as my other one is kinda my interpritation of the concept)
creations-chat 2020-10-27 21:48:27 I've made it's gun.. but honestly the maus seems really boring to build... It's alot of straight lines no detail
creations-chat 2020-10-28 11:20:23 "if I fits, I sits"
creations-chat 2020-10-28 11:48:30 I really really like the armor plates on the side of it.. like the flush black lines and the ladders..
creations-chat 2020-10-28 11:50:39 I'm proud of it
creations-chat 2020-10-28 11:57:31 That maus tho
creations-chat 2020-10-28 11:59:26 That's not really saying much.. the maus is actually a block with alot of flat surface.. but it does have some details and could be painted better... The turret though is... *Shudders*
creations-chat 2020-10-28 12:01:33 Yeah it did
The maus is hella boring to build
Because it's very very lacking detail wise
creations-chat 2020-10-28 12:03:14 It really is
creations-chat 2020-10-28 13:34:37 I might not add an engine room so I can make the vehicle bay bigger because.. I would rather be able to carry my panzer 4 and a truck then a small truck and some usless decorative engines...
creations-chat 2020-10-28 16:42:35 Me looking at this chat wondering what is going on:
creations-chat 2020-10-28 16:48:26 It's a dog.. also Damm and I thought my new rat was big
creations-chat 2020-10-28 16:51:33 If he fits he sits
creations-chat 2020-10-28 16:55:03 my sexy vehicle bay
creations-chat 2020-10-28 16:57:17 The ratte can carry 2 of my panzer 4's and it's kinda wac- LOL poor SL 096
creations-chat 2020-10-28 17:10:54 My ratte gets nocked around in public servers
Which is why I made my Suspension so if you hit my wheels you get flung to England
creations-chat 2020-10-28 17:12:09 It also has anchors but that's more for docking my truck in it
creations-chat 2020-10-28 17:16:42 I changed it to run on Nuclear power.. so it's a much smaller engine? Not unrealistic just different.
Also the vehicle bay is epic 
The whole floor folds down into a ramp
creations-chat 2020-10-28 17:28:16 Weez me ratte sits 3 blocks above the ground on its tracks.. and I have a system that lifts the Suspension up by 6 blocks
creations-chat 2020-10-28 17:30:01 Mitsubishi ki-20 heavy bomber
It was massive with passages and engine rooms in the wings
creations-chat 2020-10-28 17:33:41 <@246412229400985602> no that's not a real plane (well it's based off one kinda but not nearly the same)
He means the parasite fighters..
creations-chat 2020-10-28 21:23:04 Why has nobody made a turtle?
creations-chat 2020-10-28 21:25:35 It's so simple it's radiculois that nobody has made one
creations-chat 2020-10-28 21:28:01 But it's hella historic and could work at least somewhat on pvp for what it was meant for
creations-chat 2020-10-28 21:29:27 No I'm talking about this turtle
creations-chat 2020-10-28 21:35:57 Yeah it was
It was the first Submarine
creations-chat 2020-10-29 17:21:24 Nice maus but the camo is pretty shit..
creations-chat 2020-10-29 17:25:14 I don't like anime
I like tanks
And as someone who likes tanks I think gup is cool -.-
creations-chat 2020-10-29 17:26:15 And also pretty danm clever with it's references/jokes
creations-chat 2020-10-29 17:29:27 <@419477639229865984>
Holy shit that's awesome I've never even thought of making those
Just the castle itself
I love ghibli movies
May I suggest though adding the red gaurds over where the wings flutter?
creations-chat 2020-10-29 17:30:58 Danm

creations-chat 2020-10-29 21:49:09 But ratte go brr
It's still not done
I need to add the AA turrets.. which I've been reluctant on doing it..
creations-chat 2020-10-29 22:16:57 To show off my lil truck duh
creations-chat 2020-10-29 22:21:52 I'm waiting for someone to downvote my post because it wasn't about a truck
creations-chat 2020-10-29 22:27:09 <@720751430595772418> it's because I accidentally tightened the suspension too much when I stopped the tank before getting out in the truck to record.
I actually loosened it in the video and was kinda hoping nobody noticed it being too tight in the first place.
creations-chat 2020-10-30 14:17:39 <@422068861995581440> I did too

I spent a week building a ratte based on my own artistic interpritation of the concept
Then decided to do the normal one everyone does
However I spend so long on big projects because I don't work on them straight on for days on end
I work on them in chunks and do small things in-between like my teliporting half track
creations-chat 2020-11-02 00:54:49

general 2020-11-03 02:59:32 I managed to join back
general 2020-11-03 03:00:05 The map is the same apon my arrival and my half track is fine
creations-chat 2020-11-03 09:35:41 So I was just informed that I'm not allowed to call anything a half track if it doesn't have motor tracks.. I don't know what else you would call these? Like I'm sorry I didn't feel like scaling it up to an impractical scale so I can have laggy ass tracks
creations-chat 2020-11-03 09:37:43 It's a half track -.-
Doesn't matter if it doesn't have motor tracks it's a danm half track.
creations-chat 2020-11-03 09:38:48 Actually that one is an artillery peice I'm working on a flak one
creations-chat 2020-11-03 10:45:19 I built one but the controls were so complicated and it was so hard to get in the air just because of how much the controls required I got rid of it
creations-chat 2020-11-03 11:25:21 Danm
Kettenkrad isn't getting as much love as the bigger half tracks 
Even though it's by far the superior one in cuteness

creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:53:45 Also
Mwahahaha I rarely use motor lock because if I do I'll switch alters and forget what I was doing and confuse myself 


But


It finally payed off mwahaha
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:56:00 Hopefully Rick can get it working as it was again..
creations-chat 2020-11-03 21:58:30 Luckily the only build of mine where motor lock is seriously needed is my ratte and that's just for the side detail pannels

I can pull those up with rope and suspension tho
creations-chat 2020-11-03 22:00:01 Oh

 For good reason he has much scarier a d intresting cheracters like long horse
creations-chat 2020-11-05 05:34:40 I kinda wanna make the finnish race ca- I mean tank
With both systems for steering it had
creations-chat 2020-11-05 05:56:04 <@658140951273013248> I will stab you you ever make that joke again I swear to santa
creations-chat 2020-11-05 06:00:20 I'm also going to make the Russian flying tankette
An Italian flying tankette on basiclly a mini CA 3 glider

I already have a German flying Kettenkrad

Might do some form of american flying small ground vehicle? Idk what yet
creations-chat 2020-11-05 06:02:11 Wait
Fucking duh
A jeep
creations-chat 2020-11-05 07:12:31 
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:08:17 So currently my glider drops the Gollioth and the kettenkrad as 2 different peices separately
So I can drop the Gollioth off one place use it while flying around and then deploy the kettenkrad..

But what if I make it so that it deploys with the kettenkrad as a trailer like this?
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:20:29 <@564503356576628737> there are a few ways that I can do smaller treads
One is to have single cillinders function as normal wheels with motors and angle them downwards slightly and use tank steering
You can also use conveyors and either propeller engines or I've seen control surfaces for smaller things


It's called a kettenkrad it's the best and cutest vehicle ever ò.ó
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:22:19 > yes
> I heard people even considered submersible aircraft carriers
<@564503356576628737> 
Not just considered the I 400 was built and they are also cool as fuck
Not as cool as kettenkrads
But still cool as fuck
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:25:42 Because I kinda dislike when massive builds get a lot of praise for there detail.. because it's way way way easier to detail a massive build then a smaller one
Smaller builds like to scale tanks are way more impressive when they have that level of detail yet don't get the upvotes because they are too small and thus "low effort" and that's kinda bs and annoys me idk..
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:29:43 I disagree. 
Though I guess it is unfair to downvote a single person for something I hate about this community

This is what I agree with vvv
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:33:20 I think it's incredibly abnoxious how people praise massive highly detailed things over tiny highly detailed things

The big thing may have way more space to detail making it take way more time.. but they also have far far more space.. and when people accomplish the same level of detail on a smaller build it's far far more impressive
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:35:39 ~~The cool kids build 8 plot builds fold them out from 2 accounts and link them together idk what your in about.~~
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:37:28 I would love to make a city in plane crazy based off a mass collaboration
That would be so so cool to do though I have no idea how you would organize that
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:39:00 I haven't seen a subnautica based build yet
Which I have been eagerly waiting for with that
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:41:44 I don't intend on doing any contests because I take forever to build fucking anything to my satisfaction

I've spent almost a week now working on this and I'm still not happy with it

(It's a kettenkrad strapped to a glider for deployment similar to the Russian flying tank)
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:44:48 I want to make an oil rig
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:46:51 Well alot of oil rigs are underwater

True
creations-chat 2020-11-05 08:48:28 <@456226577798135808> maybe have the turrets flung off and the masts funnels and bridge caved in so it looks like a wreck

Wait no british turrets were screwed down never mind
creations-chat 2020-11-05 09:21:59 <@456226577798135808> have you done any Japanese pree dreadnought ships?
creations-chat 2020-11-05 12:57:57 Can we all agree the over detailed tank needs to make hall of fame?
creations-chat 2020-11-05 13:19:02 I think it looks good
It's a better jet then I can do
creations-chat 2020-11-05 13:31:50 I think the truck needs some work on the detailing but it's looking really good so far especially with the turret

*It'd be better as a half track tho-*
creations-chat 2020-11-05 13:33:28 That will be my response to all trucks 
"It's great and all but where are the tank treads?"
creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:11:40 <@252286793662070784> hey that's a nice plane. Too bad it seems too dangerous. No pilot could ever fly that. ;)
creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:18:55 Agreed
It and the wind rises are my 2 favorite studio ghibli movies.. which might be why the CA 3 CA 90 and Ki 20/G 38 are my favorite aircraft
creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:21:11 Yeah. The airship's of howl's moving castle are also absolutely amazing
creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:22:58 And the weird dragonfly fliers that occour with variety in both Howl's moving castle and castle in the sky (which also has a bad ass massive airship)

I really want to build the castle at some point
creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:25:55 I built porcos plane a while ago but it was when I first started playing and was really bad.. I might re make it as well as the dream winged plane in the intro to the wind rises.
creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:29:46 Oh god this is going to be so not fun
creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:38:43 They aren't really that bad.. I mean they are pretty easy to avoid or destroy...? I think they are way too hated on.. when they aren't any worse then suicide blocks or any other noob weopon...
creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:40:28 I'm FTM not MTF thankyou
creations-chat 2020-11-06 09:44:44 anyone have a good heavy lift heli that can carry a glider via small hook? if so can you meet me in VIP 1 i really wanna test this
creations-chat 2020-11-06 09:46:51 Really?
creations-chat 2020-11-06 09:48:25 That's pretty fucking stupid... I mean it can fly on its own so it's not that bad but like.. I can't use it as intended now
creations-chat 2020-11-06 09:52:10 I still think this thing is pretty cool.. it carries a kettenkrad a Gollioth and a trailer to carry the Gollioth behind the kettenkrad and these all can be deployed several different ways
creations-chat 2020-11-06 09:58:34 Try what
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:34:10 The main turret exterior isn't fully detailed yet so it is a pretty big contrast your right. I'm working on it tho x3
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:42:53 Thanks! <@739268362420355134>
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:46:41 This is why I don't build sleek planes
When I do build flying shit it's gliders and bi planes that can look janky as fuck
creations-chat 2020-11-06 14:49:24 I want to make this plane but holy fuck these wings are scary

It's a plane from the beginning of the studio ghibli flim "the wind rises"
It's from a dream
creations-chat 2020-11-06 16:22:06 Danm
Okay you can't see it in the screenshots because I'm stupid
But the ratte turret has a plate over where the 3rd gun was originally on the battleship turret.
creations-chat 2020-11-06 16:25:00 Especially when they take the form of rocket spammi g fighter jets who get bored of air battle and so spawn kill ground units while claiming it's not rocket spam because fighter jets do have that many rockets.. even though fighter jets.. don't engage tanks..
creations-chat 2020-11-07 03:53:42 I'm scared
help 2020-11-07 10:04:03 How do you make the German iorn cross with text. I've seen people do it so how do you
help 2020-11-07 10:06:57 Either
help 2020-11-07 10:07:01 Both
creations-chat 2020-11-07 10:10:38 I think you can post WIPs as long as there is significant progress
Like my ratte is still a WIP but I've posted it several times so I can get an idea of how it looks and what to do next
help 2020-11-07 10:13:37 Thankyou
creations-chat 2020-11-07 10:14:35 I would post WIPs here but this chat is so frequently full of bullshit they get drowned out

<@627813759427018752> it looks really good. I would suggest adding cobblestone for a frame of the building though
creations-chat 2020-11-07 12:59:59 kettenkrad go brr

And I ligit only play plane crazy

How do you upload music to get music codes for it.. I can't find what I need in the store
help 2020-11-07 14:33:41 No 
How do you make the music codes
I can't find what I want in the library
bot-central 2020-11-07 15:12:14 !expertservers
creations-chat 2020-11-07 16:13:46 So I originally had a half track that sat in my vehicle bay but it took up too much space it was hard to close the ramp with it in it.
So I made this kettenkrad and well
It actually takes up too little space
The bay could probably fit 2 of them although that would be redundent. What else should I add? Maybe a Gollioth tracked mine?

(Screenshot is pretty deceptive
I'm actually standing at the half way point in the vehicle bay)
creations-chat 2020-11-07 16:15:50 I originally planned too have a shelf containing 3 that I could then launch but the half track was so big I took it out. I could re add it but I wanted to know if anyone had any more intresting ideas
creations-chat 2020-11-07 16:19:46 That's.. not possible
The way the vehicle bay opens it would either need to take off facing down or would need to move out of the bay around the kettenkrad then take off.. that would need me to be on flat ground too though
I have toyed with the idea of creating a varient of my ratte with either a heli pad on the back of the gun or a runway above the ~~engine~~ vehicle bay where a scout plane would be.
creations-chat 2020-11-07 16:21:49 Also it just occurred to me I am talking to the seemingly official P1000RatteMechanic and he hasn't called my build streaming hot garbage yet
 The ratte gods have granted there approval.
creations-chat 2020-11-07 16:25:05 I also want to add the karl gerrat seidge mortor onto the back engine compartment but that might clutter it ***Too much***
creations-chat 2020-11-08 06:52:35 Hey so what's this nub on this turret
I want too know if it has a function I need to replicate or I'd it should be left for decoration.
creations-chat 2020-11-08 14:43:04 This guy jumped onto my ratte and it took me way too long to realize what he was wearing and doing and so I stopped 
Got in my kettenkrad opened the vehicle bay door and put the ratte full speed into the void while pulling out on my kettenkrad
creations-chat 2020-11-08 14:45:11 I was like "Fuck akward I don't know what this guy is doing I just wanted to build big tank please stop ree"
creations-chat 2020-11-08 14:46:44 The monster isn't a tank it's a SPG varient of the ratte.
But yes I do intend on making it at some point whenever I finnish this
creations-chat 2020-11-08 14:51:04 The gun is bigger but I wouldn't really say it looks better... Because we don't have any idea what it would have looked like like at all
The guy proposing the ratte supposedly mentioned how they could put the gustav gun on it for a  SPG and that's pretty much all we know.
creations-chat 2020-11-08 14:53:44 Depends what you want to achieve with it
creations-chat 2020-11-08 14:57:33 Planes are gay

plane-crazy 2020-11-08 16:12:48 <@467765396108476426> dude he jumped on my tank started spouting some not okay shit
So I ran it off a cliff while bailing out in my kettenkrad last minute
creations-chat 2020-11-09 11:58:42 I need a color code for a good sexy soviet green

creations-chat 2020-11-09 21:11:56 <@659802570474258500> hey so I know your working on the T 35
It's my favorite tank and so I want to start working on one as well as I've (significantly atleast) finished my ratte. It's obviously not going to be a copy or anything but one in my build style much closer to scale
What I would like too ask though is if you'd like to share how you are going to do the horseshoe entena because it's kinda stumping me..
creations-chat 2020-11-09 21:21:12 He wasn't crying he's asking for proper feedback which a symbol arrow doesn't exactly provide
creations-chat 2020-11-09 22:07:56 <@659802570474258500> mine is much smaller and much less complex with alot less motor lock then yours
I just need help for the entena
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:06:47 T 35 is cooler then the maus change my mind
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:17:06 This is my go too for size with tanks
I don't like making giant tanks but as compact and close to size as I can without it being a tiny little prop.

Thought I would post it here
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:21:28 <@659802570474258500> it's not super derailed yet but I'll work on it more tommorow
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:23:56 I mean
I had a build stolen from me and made into a tutorial
Now whenever I use my mini sub I have to explain that it's not a tutorial. The guy who made the tutorial is a petty theif and I am Infact out for blood
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:25:34 Also holy shit my ratte got 50 danm upvotes

Guess I'll make a proper showcase of it
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:27:56 I'm currently on mobile.. just search my messages in creations..
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:37:43 I still can't do complex motor lock because my DID (I will disassociate and not being able to recognize what I was doing easily give up on it) which sucks..
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:41:10 I'm gonna get banned for little to no motor lock on my most complex builds dispite understanding how motor lock works
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:43:06 Is there an actual reason they add the swirl in plain engines because it feels like it might be just to amuse me like a "woosh engine soon and go brrrrr "
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:47:02 When I finnish the T 35 I am going to work on lil baby tankette
I'm tired of big tonks
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:48:33 I really liked making the kettenkrad 
I wanna make more smoll things
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:51:16 Guns
creations-chat 2020-11-10 09:56:07 Still needs alot of work
general 2020-11-10 09:56:09 So
Anyone else's game go down
creations-chat 2020-11-10 14:19:49 Bro imagine putting a vehicle bay on a build like wth
creations-chat 2020-11-10 14:22:53 not that I'd know anything about pointless vehicle bays tho.. of course not
creations-chat 2020-11-10 14:24:39 No the kettenkrad could get down fine on its own
creations-chat 2020-11-10 14:26:19 
creations-chat 2020-11-10 14:32:50 Thanks
creations-chat 2020-11-10 15:21:17 I don't really mind shredder bugs
Generally it's jets I don't like
Like you have a fighter jet with 8 rockets attacking my ww2 tank at speeds faster then my computer can handle and this somehow isn't rocket spam
creations-chat 2020-11-10 15:25:13 I build tanks
My tanks are amazing against other tanks so long as they aren't spamming 12 rockets a time
But of course my interwar tank is the perfect target for a modern fighter jet.
Fighters don't use there 12 rockets against interwar tanks
You doing so is still rocket spam even if it dose have that many rockets
creations-chat 2020-11-10 15:27:44 Yeah no
All of my most upvoted stuff are useless in pvp..
But all my pvp tanks get hella downvoted because they aren't motor locked too hell and back and have decent weopons and armor
creations-chat 2020-11-10 15:29:38 I love those rocket cars
When noobs take a tiny tutorial race car and plant all the woepons they can

I have 3 diffrent versions of the teliporting half track specifically to destroy those
They are so fun to tear apart
Sames with block tanks and shredders
creations-chat 2020-11-10 15:31:30 The Teliportation bug is my favorite in pvp
Like ligit it's so good against all the spam if you put it on a small fast tank
creations-chat 2020-11-10 19:28:33 <@294980570885390346> I have them on all my German tanks and for some reason it's only with my ratte where people go "hey that symbol is racist your a na**" even when I explain that's not what the iorn cross means..
creations-chat 2020-11-10 19:41:29 How the hell do people do the thing where they put sparklers back to back for a gun barrel??
creations-chat 2020-11-10 21:35:47 
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:26:10 The slow mode has worked amazingly. Once people stop complaining about it over time it will become clear how well it is working.
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:28:56 How should I go about adding details like rivits to the sprocket covers
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:31:35 ^^^
creations-chat 2020-11-10 23:33:18 It's really funny all the people who complain about slow mode are the same people who trashed the chat before we had it
creations-chat 2020-11-11 08:11:40 Hol up
There is a hammer and sickle on this tonk
creations-chat 2020-11-11 08:18:56 *no it was a German tank*
creations-chat 2020-11-11 10:00:49 <@414359638302130176> um no.. I looked it up and that's wrong
Especially because that photo was taken before the Russians captured it
The germans painted it on so if the allies saw it they would assume it was a captured russian tank not a German project
creations-chat 2020-11-11 10:52:38 Apparently I'm a noob because "real tanks don't have a million gun turrets you spammer"

He was talking about my T 35
creations-chat 2020-11-11 10:55:10 
creations-chat 2020-11-11 10:57:41 "tanks only have one turret" 

The entire interwar period: "am I a joke to you?"
creations-chat 2020-11-11 10:59:13 Ww2 SPGs:
You guys have armor?
creations-chat 2020-11-11 11:00:58 Imagine being a female mark one
That's why I'm trans FTM
Not because of dysphoria no
Because female mark ones are hella gay
general 2020-11-11 11:03:33 Idfr <@414359638302130176>
general 2020-11-11 11:03:46 I think he left
general 2020-11-11 11:03:56 A bit ago
creations-chat 2020-11-11 11:32:29 I mean
It was game changing at the time
Ww1-interwar tanks are ligit my favorite
creations-chat 2020-11-11 11:39:48 So I was thinking
The issue with pvp is it favors small builds with alot of guns right?
Big builds get the same amount of guns as those small builds and can't defend themselves due to it
And they can't have more gun cus then more would just be placed on the spam build

So why not add more powerfull gun types
But make them add alot of weight to your build
For the large builds they are meant for this would be no problem easy peasy but for small spam boxes there things can't be spammed on them as easily
creations-chat 2020-11-11 12:08:38 It stops people from making small planes or cars with the new guns
Helium takes up space still 
It's not big spam cars that are the issue they are easy to pick off
creations-chat 2020-11-11 13:47:58 What in ze fek is that maus
The maus is like
The easiest tank to get right how do you mess it up?
creations-chat 2020-11-11 14:50:08 Is.. that supposed to be a ratte?

I'ma have to revoke this man's breathing rights if that's what it's supposed to be
creations-chat 2020-11-11 21:21:57 This mf goin  goin on about how my ratte is too short and small. bish at least my tank doesn't look like a frozen block of green pea soup
creations-chat 2020-11-11 21:46:52 My ratte is intentionally not supposed to look like that and be more stubby 
(I kinda hate sleek looking tanks from a esthetic standpoint
It just kinda misses the point in my mind and the ratte looks so sleek whenever it's depicted. I hate the maus for the same reason)
It's my interpretation of the ratte concept
creations-chat 2020-11-11 21:49:55 I wanted it too look less like the maus and more like something you'd see in metal slug
Thus more bulky
creations-chat 2020-11-11 21:51:54 I'ma try making this
My first tank was actually an AAV
And I recently refitted it while keeping the same old esthetic.
I want to make a new one tho
creations-chat 2020-11-12 01:37:08 My new AAV. Not detailed yet but all the hard parts are done ^-^
creations-chat 2020-11-12 01:38:41 It's all the different hatches and shit
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:08:27 I'm happy with the turret just not the gun and again currently there are no details on it including paint
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:30:41 Can someone design an AAV turret for me.. I know that sounds lazy.. it's not.. I'm not good at turrets and I think I know how to do it but it would take alot of motor lock because as I've mentioned before I can't do complex motor lock stuff because when I switch alters or disassociate from my DID I completely lose track of what I'm doing and have to re look over the entire thing to figure out what I'm doing... 

Holy shit I've seen that purple car he tried to talk shit on my T 35
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:32:14 It's a bit more then just 2 motor 2s..
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:33:45 That looks amazing thankyou.. I might play with it a bit as mine doesn't have the garnade launcher but just a large machine gun and more storage space
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:35:36 <@674434894616854548> yeah but it has windows and shit and the gun fits in weird
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:37:10 It's not a tank it's an AAV or basiclly a water proof IFV
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:45:36 Wait it has a name.. I assumed it was just called an AAV.. america likes to name a single vehicle for what it's classification is
America is weird
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:48:38 I've only ever heard them called AAVs and  names like that for the varients
creations-chat 2020-11-12 02:50:13 What is it?
creations-chat 2020-11-12 14:02:14 I am pretty happy with how the outside of this is looking
creations-chat 2020-11-12 17:25:53 I wanna make 3 versions of the AAV
This is the standerd version
I'll do the command version and the super heavy lift engineering version with a crain
creations-chat 2020-11-12 18:12:43 Any feedback for my AAV?
creations-chat 2020-11-12 18:16:39 That's.. kinda the point of camouflage isn't it?
creations-chat 2020-11-12 18:18:13 That's fair
It's easier too see them all in game tbf
creations-chat 2020-11-12 18:37:18 That jet thing is radiculois

This has more upvotes then some decent builds
It's a single danm block pull your shit together.

creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:31:25 Sometimes you need opinions on WIPs.. and you can't normally post it here and expect large response because this chat likes to get shit faced
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:32:56 That doesn't help.
It was worse before the slow mode.
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:38:31 Holy shit
This man posted a series of wips then did the same thing on a new different build
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:40:01 *I'm so confused as to how people do those they look so good.*
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:41:56 Why does this have so many upvotes..


Ooo
Okay
Is it alright if I save that to try to do something like it?..
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:45:18 For just playing a few months.. my first tank (an AAV) and this new AAV.. there is clear progress...
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:46:52 No they're completely different builds
The first Is my first tank 
The second is my new one
It's like twice the size has interior and us better in ligit every way
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:49:06 *looks up from drawing tablet*
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:51:42 Aww..
Can I hug it?
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:54:12 I use light mode because I wear glasses but mine don't work while looking at screens so my vision looking at a phone is shit
Light mode has higher contrast
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:56:22 I feel like the back needs improvement but idk how to do that when I have the ramp..
creations-chat 2020-11-13 03:58:29 Well
No
The problem really is

Is it's accurate
All the details on the back of the actual AAV
Are there

It still feels empty because irl it is.. and idk how to fix it
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 12:30:04 *pulls self out of wa wa*
creations-chat 2020-11-13 18:36:11 Wow my new ratte turret got a lot of downvotes what do I need to fix on it
creations-chat 2020-11-13 18:50:19 Can I get some detailed feedback on my new ratte turret? It got hella downvoted and I'm not really sure what to fix..
creations-chat 2020-11-13 18:58:04 But.. I stated why it was a WIP..? I wanted too see feedback on the shape
Can't post it here and expect feedback because shit gets buried under monkeys screaming about self upvotes
creations-chat 2020-11-13 22:45:51 This 
But 
Like


Anti tank missiles
creations-chat 2020-11-13 23:03:09 Yeah it looks pretty wack ngl
creations-chat 2020-11-13 23:12:11 This image gets more cursed the closer you look at it
help 2020-11-13 23:22:48 So does motor 2 just not like massive turrets?
creations-chat 2020-11-13 23:47:27 Torpedo boat with tank treads? How about:
creations-chat 2020-11-14 03:02:02 I need a sound effect to loop for my ratte's engines
I had one but it gave me head aches for some reason
creations-chat 2020-11-14 12:59:19 
creations-chat 2020-11-14 13:03:21 I didn't know this but apparently germany made so many gollioths that after the war they just had too mass junk them in big piles the blow them up with C4 like wtf
creations-chat 2020-11-14 13:06:10 They were tracked mines and tbf they did have a lot of issues
creations-chat 2020-11-14 14:25:55 What the hell
creations-chat 2020-11-14 14:29:36 If I built this in game without giving the context of it being a weasel
I would be considered a noob
creations-chat 2020-11-14 15:08:18 And very few were used
creations-chat 2020-11-14 23:08:37 <@265819387498332160> hey I have one just like that but it's a 2 seater/stores stuff thing
creations-chat 2020-11-14 23:27:32 That moment when you make a SPG so big it extends over 3 plots and moving the gun to fast flips it over
(Making the monster)
creations-chat 2020-11-15 03:50:14 Why thankyou.
creations-chat 2020-11-15 03:52:56 Indeed
I was enjoying your half tracks
They are my favorite vehicles of all time
creations-chat 2020-11-15 03:55:41 I'm kinda unhappy with the gun so that might change at some point
creations-chat 2020-11-15 03:57:42 Thanks
creations-chat 2020-11-15 03:59:19 I'm bad at guns
So I think it's pretty good for me being terrible at guns but not the best anyone could make
I will likely re do the end of the berral at some point
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:01:20 I'm waiting for the inevitable downvote for "unrealisticness that my og "pree dreadnaught" ratte got
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:02:53 Yeah
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:27:24 I've never seen someone do a ratte or monster with the seams in the armor like this so I'm pretty proud of them especially because they use so little motor lock and sit so seamlessly into the hull
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:29:25 It doesn't need to be longer and wouldn't of been longer it was proposed as a SPG varient of the ratte?
creations-chat 2020-11-15 04:49:11 You mean the ikea jets?
creations-chat 2020-11-15 05:21:03 Isn't there a bigger but fictonal German tank? If so should I make it given I've done the ratte and monster?
creations-chat 2020-11-15 05:23:01 Holy shit.. is.. is this even possible in game?
creations-chat 2020-11-15 05:24:47 At the scale of my other ratte?
I don't even know what I would do with all that space
Or all of the interior
How I would connect the interiors of the 4 ratte bodies too the main tank
My plot can barely fit 2 rattes I don't think I could do 4 and a tank
creations-chat 2020-11-15 05:27:17 Maybe it could be done using 3 accounts
2 for the ratte's
One for the main tank body
But
Is it even worth it at that point? It probably wouldn't even get hall of fame as there is no way I could come up with all that interior
creations-chat 2020-11-15 05:41:49 If doing this thing thing with as much detail and interior and what not as my ratte doesn't get me hall of fame
I don't know what will
help 2020-11-15 05:46:32 Is connecting builds between alts possible
Not counting controls or anything but if I hook mine and my alts half of a build together will they stay hooked or will physics fuck itself
help 2020-11-15 05:48:19 I have good internet
I need a good grappling design
I'm going to try to build the Grott which will take somewhere between 3 and 4 different accounts to make
help 2020-11-15 05:51:26 My ratte takes up half my plot
This has 4 plus a whole nother tank body plus a gun the size of a ratte
help 2020-11-15 06:23:40 My estimate is 3 -4 because it needs to be to scale with my current ratte so I can do interior
creations-chat 2020-11-15 15:47:48 I edited a bit too make it look like the gun was still hot from just firing a shot
creations-chat 2020-11-15 18:48:53 I'm working on my monsters steering 
Basiclly giving it 2 modes
Drive mode and a targeting mode
Meaning I can switch modes, stop in place via anchor blocks and then my kepad acts as in place steering turning the whole thing while I aim the gun
It's still usless in pvp but it's incredibly fun to use

creations-chat 2020-11-16 00:29:39 I found a server full of loonys
creations-chat 2020-11-16 03:29:48 Should I steam the guy copying my ratte?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 03:32:47 He dosen't know how to motor lock so the panels at he side stick out

creations-chat 2020-11-16 03:36:59 LOL
creations-chat 2020-11-16 03:43:27 
creations-chat 2020-11-16 03:44:58 "I'm using 1 motor lock instead of 3"
Yeah but you seem to have forgotten that you will have to fit wheels under that..
creations-chat 2020-11-16 03:47:41 He has no idea what goes above that point as evidenced by the fact he started the second deck way too low
He also dispite him apparently making it more accurately to the irl tank can't name what he actually improved or name the tank in question
creations-chat 2020-11-16 03:50:50 I'm just going to say it because it needs to be said just once
*It's not called a ram it's called a bulbous bow reee*

creations-chat 2020-11-16 04:54:27 No way that gets HOF while my ratte, the most detailed one I've seen in creations doesn't..
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:13:55 Dude I am so close to 60 upvotes on my ratte-
*Fricking hype*
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:18:29 You think it will make it in?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:23:10 Hopefully by the time I wake up people have voted up to 60 and I can submit it to hall of fame.. however you do that..
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:24:53 Wdym?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:26:40 ^
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:31:55 I mean
If it doesn't make hall of fame I'll ask for some hard feedback and criticism then strip it down again and re do it with that in mind just like I did the last 2 times
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:35:16 What battleship?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:38:31 I would pick another ship of it's classification and try to go from there improvising where needed
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:42:03 Holy hell these blueprints make no sense.. that's absolutely massive wth
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:43:46 Yeah 
I built one
It's in creations

I mean this is too big for the ratte.
Way too big
Well.. no maybe not.. the layout would just be.. incredibly sloped..
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:46:17 Yeah but these blueprints don't make sense with how it's proportioned
Yourd end up with a tall sleek front and vack rectangle of a tank..
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:47:49 Wdym? <@456226577798135808>
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:49:20 Ah alright
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:51:57 Stop shitting on WIPs in creations they are valid if you need general opinions on something before adding say the turret or wings
Also from personal experience it's way better to get a response there then here
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:53:36 The front one is yeah
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:56:12 Yeah but creations feedback frequently gives no feedback
It's more often full of idiots spamming the same emote or screeming about a tutorial
creations-chat 2020-11-16 17:40:19 Danm
Still stuck at 55 votes on the ratte
creations-chat 2020-11-16 17:41:50 Hi can people please pass judgement on my ratte I wanna get it into hall of fame and am 5 away

creations-chat 2020-11-16 17:48:35 Not HOf

creations-chat 2020-11-16 17:54:25 <@456226577798135808> then I'll just ask and then take feedback and strip it down re work it from the bottom up with it in mind again like I did the first 2 times until I get it right

I'ma start work on stripping it down to make a better one
creations-chat 2020-11-16 19:38:53 1moreree
creations-chat 2020-11-16 19:44:21 I understand motor lock well my problem isn't really one that can be fixed 
I'm a DID system and every time I've tried to work on projects that use a lot of motor lock I disassociate and end up confused about how what I was building works and then try to"fix it" and it just gets worse from there
So I can't do really complex motor lock
Only small amounts of it for stuff like my rattes side pannels or for turrets
creations-chat 2020-11-16 19:55:08 Holy shit
The guy who was copying my ratte last night is still trying
creations-chat 2020-11-16 19:57:44 It's a pretty bad copy as well
creations-chat 2020-11-16 20:18:40 So I parked my blimp above him with the sign saying COPY \/

AND HE FUCKING LEFT
creations-chat 2020-11-16 20:21:52 Also I was right in guessing he didn't remember much above the main deck because he butchered the gun house
creations-chat 2020-11-16 20:37:29 <@746022074216218625> can I commit joke steel and create a furry ratte
creations-chat 2020-11-16 20:45:27 Which one?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 20:57:10 It's hard too someone who blacks out every couple minutes and has foggy memory of what they were doing at the best of times
creations-chat 2020-11-16 21:07:26 Hell yeah I am
creations-chat 2020-11-16 21:10:14 I mean
Really I'm ace but I'm pan romantic
general 2020-11-16 21:14:11 Cookies?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 21:31:23 I hate how war thunders (IE the mod) ratte looks 
The gun is too far back
The armor wouldn't of been that danm sleek
It wasn't the maus
creations-chat 2020-11-16 21:35:14 Yeah but it's the most popular one and its what people tend to think of and it fucking bugs me
creations-chat 2020-11-16 21:38:05 Yeah but there was a single Blueprint
And it doesn't have the front that stupidly sloped or the gun that far back on the body
People say my ratte is short or stubby
No it's accurate to the original blueprints as much as possible
creations-chat 2020-11-16 21:42:48 Except they do.. they have an accurate shape and main gun
The details are what we don't know
And it is incredibly unlikely the front looked like that
Just as unlikely as there being 2 maus turrets on the back
Also the gun being in the middle like that would make the entire thing back heavy
creations-chat 2020-11-16 21:51:01 <@207922337549385728> no but we know what parts of the design looks like and we know enough to know that's not what it would look like
creations-chat 2020-11-16 22:43:43 took me like 2 mins t figure out "wait there are 2 kettenkrads there-"
creations-chat 2020-11-16 22:46:48 I mean
At least the guy isn't copying the ratte itself
Just my lil kettenkrad
general 2020-11-17 00:14:30 If germany is the fatherland

creations-chat 2020-11-17 01:07:04 It needs to be fairly small tho

creations-chat 2020-11-17 23:49:02 I'm making a German zeppelin
But I wanna make a military one not a civilian one
Any suggestions?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 00:18:19 I found the post of my original ratte.. and it's so cringy..
creations-chat 2020-11-18 01:42:25 wdyt so far
creations-chat 2020-11-18 01:46:16 Its not the hindenburg it's a much older style but custom zeppelin.. and yeah it's supposed to be pretty long
creations-chat 2020-11-18 01:54:05 Yea
creations-chat 2020-11-18 05:11:28 What the f-
creations-chat 2020-11-18 05:16:49 wdyt of the first cabin?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 05:19:52 <@660019099430289418> yee 
I'm basing it off this one zeppelin I found with 2 cabins and a bomb bay between them
creations-chat 2020-11-18 05:35:38 <@661877568408125480> it looks good
I suggest using trails (set them off of toggle and to a key you won't press)
To create better runway markings
You can look them up or copy the runway in game for an idea
creations-chat 2020-11-18 05:37:09 Um.. no not at all
I've been trying to figure that out..
creations-chat 2020-11-18 05:39:40 Yeah but they sre pretty obviously new to the game.. you can't be too hard on them that's how you make them not want to play
You guys do this way too often

creations-chat 2020-11-19 04:55:53 I present
The most obscure but honestly one of the coolest peices of airship related technology
creations-chat 2020-11-19 04:58:40 Right? It's pretty brilliant 
It was completely real
I think it's a neat idea and even though we don't have clouds in PC I have added one

It's one of those parts of ww1 airship warfare that is largelyand sadly forgotten. Airship's have been around for a while and they are hella intresting

***it wasn't just germany***
creations-chat 2020-11-19 05:03:44 so here is the zoom out
creations-chat 2020-11-19 05:10:51 Well yeah it's not detailed or painted yet
But functionally it's all there
This thing is huge and it's stats as of now are pretty impressive..
It has 2 5 gun machine gun turrets for a full 360 dagrees of coverage
Has 2 bar racks (they were taken off in that screenshot) that can theoretically carry whatever I want the save has 50 single block bombs but theoretically I can increase the number of bars on the rack and add all 150 bombs
Or I could add rocket turrets, guided missiles or even tanks

It also has 2 internal bomb bays for exploasive spheres one of which currently houses the spy basket but can be fitted too carry bombs as well as the second bay for a total of 150
creations-chat 2020-11-19 05:12:28 2

5 gun

Machine gun turrets
2 turrets
Each side
With 5 guns
creations-chat 2020-11-19 05:14:31 Yeah I recognize that now-
Sorry for the confusion
creations-chat 2020-11-19 05:17:59 It's kinda sad.. it isn't really possible to build massive scale airships in hame.. because they are fucking huge.. and unlike a ship where you can cut off half of it.. you see all of the airship..
creations-chat 2020-11-19 08:36:39 I was going to push the final "WiP" with all the details and what not of my zeppelin before I went too add the helium. 


And now I'm going to wait until it won't be overshadowed by the far more impressive steampunk build-
creations-chat 2020-11-19 08:48:09 Ah so like
Scrap punk
creations-chat 2020-11-19 08:49:52 
creations-chat 2020-11-19 08:58:59 mine is supposed to just be accurate  to ww1 zepplins..
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:22:03 <@291956715749113868> that's not an anchor it's a spy basket I just lowered myself in to get down
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:24:18 They were actually a used and in my opinion are one of the cooler parts if what make up the forgotten airship's of warfare
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:29:14 Also 
For anchoring an airship using teathers and anchor blocks
The best way to do it is to replicate real life


Lower feather with anchor off the nose of the ship once that teather is on the ground cut power to the engines and let the airship tilt tail to nose 90 dagrees.
Once this is done lower a second teather from the tail and once that is anchored on the ground you can real it in too bring your airship to an even level before reeling in both ropes to bring it to the ground.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:41:37 How.. the hell.. is it that big.. I only was able to do a 3 fold because the engines and tail took up so much space... And the gondolas.. mine has pvp use tho
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:51:19 I will also be undergroing this expedition in my own ship to provide scientific consensus on <@291956715749113868>'s findings.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 09:58:05 Brining some experiments on board to test
A conveyor engine, 2 different Teliportation drives, some different engines some weopons and other mechanical peices to test
creations-chat 2020-11-19 10:03:09 
creations-chat 2020-11-19 10:15:03 my max speed going down is 90.. it is 225 to 300 with the other 2 engines on each side I stupidly took off while doing the gondolas and forgot to put back on
creations-chat 2020-11-19 10:18:05 danm... so either you reached an end in that time.. and so I don't have much further or something else happened. I am pretty far out and all my instruments and experiments are still working normally.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 10:23:06 
creations-chat 2020-11-19 10:24:46 Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
creations-chat 2020-11-19 10:26:30 I went to raise myself back up into the airship
And 
Accidentally unanchored it and came very close to the void
general 2020-11-19 12:26:54 <@291956715749113868> my ship makes 2-300 speed with all of it's engines
I'm a fucking dumbass
And I forgot to add 4 of them
So
I'm getting 80 speed rn
general 2020-11-19 12:30:38 Mine flies.. meh stable... Especially with no actual lifting gas and 4 missing engines..
general 2020-11-19 12:31:22 I'm still working on it so I've been using zero gravity until I finnish it before I work on balancing it out
general 2020-11-19 12:34:22 <@291956715749113868> how do you stabalize an airship.. teach me your ways.. am I right in doing all the build before adding the helium and balancing it out? Or should I work out where the engines should be to make it fly stable?
general 2020-11-19 12:34:57 How do I do that
I suck at making stable airship's
I've only gotten kinda close by using set control surfaces..
general 2020-11-19 12:37:16 <@291956715749113868> what about placement for the engines?
general 2020-11-19 12:38:04 Alright
general 2020-11-19 12:39:55 I gave up like an hour ago I got to sleepy
general 2020-11-19 12:40:44 Though I think I got close
My spirit levels I used to stabalize the controls on my airship broke so..
creations-chat 2020-11-19 23:35:05 Anyone have a good design for a small lil search light? I wanna fit some on my zeppelin
creations-chat 2020-11-19 23:52:14 So I was working on my airship
And guy joins private server and goes "can I shoot it down please? And then won't shut up about it
So I'm like
Yeah you can let me spawn it in I get it's pretty epic to use old planes to shoot down zeppel- motherfucker pulls out a guided missile in a seat
And runs it into me
Then does it again
And again
And so I go "danm.. that was disappointing I thought you were going to pull out a plane or something.."
He then goes "wow dude I'm leaving"

Like bruh


Then he just now joins back and goes "I'm not a noob I have premium I have a turret now you happy?"
creations-chat 2020-11-19 23:53:53 Yep


I have no idea who this person is or how they got in my VIP server
creations-chat 2020-11-19 23:56:06 I guess
Again I have no issue with the fact I was shot down
It's the fact he did it in the most.. boring way possible
help 2020-11-20 02:09:21 I don't understand what happened the motors all stopped working they fall apart
help 2020-11-20 02:11:42 What the fuck is going on?
help 2020-11-20 02:14:59 How the fucking game mutalates half of my airship in the save..
creations-chat 2020-11-20 02:16:17 I think I'm going to fucking cry
My airship is literally falling apart and I don't know if I added something or what's going on
The folding dosent work
Blocks are missing from it in the save
And the 4 engines don't respond to controls

creations-chat 2020-11-20 09:31:22 I am very quickly running out of rooms to put in my airship
creations-chat 2020-11-20 10:02:18 Yeah early ones only had interior withen the gondolas
And I was going to do that
But mine is big enough that I could fit decks into the bottom similar to later airships with cabins built into the envelope.
creations-chat 2020-11-20 11:57:49 Airship don

general 2020-11-22 08:14:52 No
general 2020-11-22 08:15:05 Actually
Fuckin
I didn't buy this nitro
general 2020-11-22 08:15:22 It was "gifted" to me by a stalker who was trying to groom me
general 2020-11-22 08:15:36 Years worth of fucking nitro
general 2020-11-22 08:16:46 I don't know if he's a furry
He is a guy who went to my old highschool
And stalks me online now creating false accounts and shit
general 2020-11-22 08:18:08 I'm not even that furry though
I pretty much just draw furry cheracters for other people and shitpost
Hell my "fursona" was created as a joke and just stuck
general 2020-11-22 08:20:02 Not really? I don't identify with animals or uh.. think about animals or any wack shit like that
I draw animal cheracters because they are funner to do then humans
general 2020-11-22 08:20:28 Yes
general 2020-11-22 08:23:13 <@409676438682206218> can't
Phone has no space for me to re download then from my art app
Give me a bit
general 2020-11-22 08:26:19 Not all furrys are nsfw
I'm not


But

Alot of them are -.-
general 2020-11-22 08:26:30 
general 2020-11-22 08:27:04 Not gore

general 2020-11-22 08:31:58 Hahaha
general 2020-11-22 08:32:52 *Slep*
general 2020-11-22 08:34:06 *vib*
general 2020-11-22 08:35:18 *rar*
general 2020-11-22 08:35:37 Aero morphs are just... Weird..
general 2020-11-22 08:35:51 Because they're more fun to draw then humans
general 2020-11-22 08:36:44 You can tell cheracter traits by there visual design on a furry far more easily then on a human
If you do that to a human your stereotyping
general 2020-11-22 08:37:51 If I draw a rihno in a gold chain wearing spikes
Even without the gold chain and spikes
You know he about to beat the shit out of someone cuz he a big bad rihno

If I do that while drawing humans
general 2020-11-22 08:39:03 Yes but anthros add to it even more it's fun to make anthro cheracters and fun to draw them
general 2020-11-22 08:40:59 No..? I started drawing animals long before I was exposed to furries
I don't even consider myself a furry
I consider myself an artist who draws furry cheracters because furry cheracters are fun to work on and far more expressive.
Why do you think cheracters like that have been around for so long?
general 2020-11-22 08:42:28 No because I frequently draw more realistic anthros.. and I don't enjoy drawing humans in either medium
general 2020-11-22 08:43:56 I explained why there is a reason for them to be animals
It lets you do more with just cheracter design.

creations-chat 2020-11-23 04:01:34 Ight
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:08:55 Think I can make a mouse controlled blimp?
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:28:45 THAT WAS THE WRONG CHAT-
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:30:41 I think it's some BS I cannot get any ranks for this
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:40:55 what on it doesn't look good?
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:44:40 <@456226577798135808> what on it doesn't look that good?
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:46:45 It's gondolas have alot of detail.. airships don't have alot of details on the envelope and the one I was going for was long and thin like that
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:52:17 so basically make a new airship. got it
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:54:29 Yeah but making it shorter means re building and re adjusting it's weight, it's interior and it's controls
I'll re paint it
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:56:50 that would mean moving the front gondola back and complete restructuring of how the bottom is layed out.
creations-chat 2020-11-23 05:58:29 all of the bomb strips bomb bays and equipment out the bottom is from the front gondola back
creations-chat 2020-11-23 06:00:24 either way it is practically re building half of it. when I posted the frame of this people said it looked good. i filled in that frame and now it's shit
creations-chat 2020-11-23 06:02:34 i showed that i wanted to make a big airship with 2 gondolas and showed this and the frame
creations-chat 2020-11-23 06:08:19 It's proportioned to look like this
It's not supposed to be an exact recreation of any zeppelin mainly because I can't find good blueprints for any of these.
I can re paint it
But I don't see a reason to move the tail comparing them it looks fine
creations-chat 2020-11-23 06:15:48 What

creations-chat 2020-11-23 16:52:45 I thought it was supposed to be a B17
creations-chat 2020-11-23 16:56:08 Wait like

The white B-17 tutorials I am seeing around..  aren't.. B-17s? I know nothing about planes I swear
creations-chat 2020-11-23 16:57:46 *the 2 tutorials look the fucking same*

Also yeah I see both
creations-chat 2020-11-23 16:59:40 I wanna make a B 17 because I've had some really good designs for the ball turret, the top gun, and the tail and nose guns for a while... But I'm scared it might look like the tutorial

Because I've watched people build them themselves

And end up with something that looks just like the tutorial
creations-chat 2020-11-23 17:01:36 Ik

creations-chat 2020-11-24 19:56:11 what is so bad with my tankette?
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:01:10 I don't understand what I did so wrong with it
I thought that this was one of my better tank/tankette I've made so far
And yet it's getting the most downvotes
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:03:41 
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:07:04 ?
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:29:39 I feel like there might be some confusion so to which end of the tankette is the front

The gun is tied down to face the rear of the tankette
It's done like this because because at some point when I am less loopy I might actually finish it's glider
creations-chat 2020-11-24 20:57:02 Yellow foil is more for probes that need to be lighter
creations-chat 2020-11-24 21:17:40 Mine like

creations-chat 2020-11-25 20:24:33 I am really really having fun with tiny tankettes. any suggestions
creations-chat 2020-11-25 21:41:32 <@!389756407483990028> I would like to state. that is not the longest hog possible
creations-chat 2020-11-25 22:22:55 <@389756407483990028> I mean

Not yet
But I have made a ratte a monster a T-35 and a T 42

Massive ground vehicles are slowly becoming my norm
I can probably figure out how it lengthen the hog
creations-chat 2020-11-25 23:31:21 What other tankettes should I make?
creations-chat 2020-11-25 23:32:52 <@456226577798135808> that's not a tankette
creations-chat 2020-11-25 23:36:19 It's a bit more then just a small tank.. it's perpose and general design is different

The wiesel is far too boring
It's some wedges with rockets
I don't like going those types of tanks...

creations-chat 2020-11-30 01:07:19 I was pinged?
creations-chat 2020-11-30 01:10:56 I did screenshot the chat. and you good sir started by calling peoples tank's trash.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 01:13:17 also I was neutral through that and did not insult you. I wanted you to fold it out so I could land a kettenkrad on it. it was pretty unimpressive though.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 01:14:50 also you claimed to have shipwright in chat which I can now see is wrong. and you claimed you would report everyone to your group and they would hunt us. which hasn't happened. so I am having alot of doubts here.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 01:16:23 was not in your plot. ever. never entered it.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 01:19:09 nobody else was either? you blacklisted them all for talking trash. I stayed silent and shot at you with fireworks. your attempts at trying to get us all banned are pretty wack

Adding snow coming off or adding little sleds into the storage or removing wheels for skis or adding extra bundles for blankets it's so fun
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 08:43:59 You can get rid of the fog and snow effects and even make the ice turn invisible by turning off the snow blaster and then quickly respawning so you de load it
It breaks the whole update

creations-chat 2021-01-14 08:55:11 that's kinda the defining feature of the G.38. it's wings were so huge that engineers walked passageways between them to service the engines mid flight and passengers sat in cabins within them looking out ahead

creations-chat 2021-02-01 16:24:40 <@!177743269105500160>  hey why did you downvote on my CA90's interior? asking cus I wanna improve anything wrong with it
creations-chat 2021-02-01 16:31:57 I wanted judgement on the interior that's all you were voting on?.. the interior is finished
creations-chat 2021-02-01 16:34:31 it was just to show the layout- and the other side is done and on it I cut it in half for the screenshots. and I posted the interior there, which was finished.
creations-chat 2021-02-01 16:36:33 I ligit just want to know the reason for the downvote Im really trying to get the interior on this right

I'm not complaining mind you, but if you have a reason to downvote I want to know it so I can fix it as I really wanna do good on this plane
creations-chat 2021-02-01 16:41:15 The exterior isn't done yet?.. I still have to do cableing and texture the paint. I posted the interior so I could get judgment on it
creations-chat 2021-02-01 16:45:53 where the fuck is camera
creations-chat 2021-02-01 16:48:23 you still never explained why
creations-chat 2021-02-01 17:00:42 that was again, just to show the interior's layout it was supposed to be judging the interior, the build obviously isn't cut in half and isn't saved like that
creations-chat 2021-02-02 15:06:22 Ill get a good 3 screenshots and then repost the CA 90 so I don't image spam okay?
creations-chat 2021-02-02 15:08:23 no I deleted that because it was image spam, so im going to get a few good screenshots rather then a bunch of meh ones.
creations-chat 2021-02-02 15:12:36 thanks
creations-chat 2021-02-02 15:14:45 Ive tried that in the past and nobody watches them so it just doesn't get voted on
creations-chat 2021-02-04 23:11:35 2390
creations-chat 2021-02-04 23:14:22 the interior took wway longer then the exterior-
creations-chat 2021-02-04 23:19:51 also i would just like to add- the only thing I could find about the interior for this plane is that it had a door here and where it's feul tanks were. everything else was improvised
creations-chat 2021-02-05 00:44:18 <@!177743269105500160> once again.. why the downvote?.. anything you actually want me to change on it to be better?
creations-chat 2021-02-05 00:52:05 he downvoted the first post on it's interior too and doged my questions until he landed on "It's a wip and I don't like how it's cut in half" then stopped responding
creations-chat 2021-02-05 00:56:45 im taking it seriously because otherwise nothing will change
creations-chat 2021-02-05 01:08:49 it's anoying that he downvoted it because he's the only one
creations-chat 2021-02-05 01:35:53 wait which part of it is the front doesn't it have like 4 huge entrances
creations-chat 2021-02-05 02:07:16 Well see i did all that and it got labled as image spam and mass downvoted. it is finnished that's why i posted it
general 2021-02-05 02:10:11 Im not in the game right now and face on images are the worst way to look at something. you can see the build I sent clear images
general 2021-02-05 02:12:11 your real reason is mass downvotes don't play those games with me. your the only one who felt my build wasn't "clean enough" and if It was cleaner you'd say it looked to bland.
general 2021-02-05 02:16:52 what's your issue with the tail?
general 2021-02-05 02:17:50 the fact you had too go through all this to justify your downvote long after you gave it shows you were just spamming.
general 2021-02-05 02:18:05 both look fine..?
general 2021-02-05 02:18:58 it looked off.. before you looked at the blueprints.
general 2021-02-05 02:21:34 yeah no mine's not proportioned perfectly because I pulled the wings down as they looked too weird even for me. it just didn't translate well into the game estheitcally. that's the only real huge issue with it in terms of blueprint
general 2021-02-05 02:22:14 he mass downvoted and is trying realll hard to justify it
general 2021-02-05 02:23:05 justified too who lol. you seem to be the only one
general 2021-02-05 02:25:33 ah see I have a pretty good idea why you've been downvoting my builds but yknow-
general 2021-02-05 02:27:08 you were talking about her in those messages
general 2021-02-05 02:30:00 my plane is accurate to the real thing. your asking me to fix things like my tail's angle and my nose and they don't need to be fixed because for the nose, my plane doesn't have the CA 90 A's nose it has the proposed nose design from the wind rises. and for the tail I can't make that custom angle more exsteam without messing up the entirety of the interior which you also downvoted and never gave a good reason for by the way
general 2021-02-05 02:31:26 mate you mass downvoted then when called out for it looked up blueprints too try your danmdest too discredit the built. and again it's as accurate as it can be while retaining interior which I needed to retain
general 2021-02-05 02:33:04 ^
general 2021-02-05 02:34:45 he messed up my ratio on a perfectly good build. waffled around the question as too why for a while pulling out excuses about screenshot quality then overlayed it to blueprints to find small imperfections to the angles
general 2021-02-05 02:36:48 you didn't give actual critisim other then "it looks off.. well um.. screenshots are ba- well no.. uhm.. uhh... inaccurate this angle here be wrong"
general 2021-02-05 02:38:04 he came up with like 3 excuses and then pulled up blueprints to overlay.
general 2021-02-05 02:38:21 no the tail is square the rudder just falls behind the tail.
general 2021-02-05 02:39:15 I did this with an emphasis on interior which is not really possible when your motor locking for every perfect tiny angle
general 2021-02-05 02:39:55 your not helping your being a pain and going "man that sucks you can't just accept my critismsss mann"
general 2021-02-05 02:42:18 your not even as good and accurate as you gold others too. ive looked up your builds they aren't nearly what your holding me too. im not trying to be a pro im trying to build a good looking plane with a nice interior and your "should have just used a custom angle and motor lock to get every perfect angle accurate" is bull
general 2021-02-05 02:43:14 yeah. I am. ive seen your builds they aren't as good as your holding others too
general 2021-02-05 02:46:03 that isn't nearly to the standerds your holding me too. let me just hold it up to blueprints find a nice 1% difference in angle and then downvote for it, oh no that's right I have to downvote first because it looks off then try to find a real reason later when called out, yeah that's how you judge who's pro
creations-chat 2021-02-05 02:54:54 *god that bomber is so bad..* not the build! the build is amazing your doing a good job! the source material is just.. germany wth was your goal with that-?
general 2021-02-05 03:04:03 great and did you build that with emphases on having a full interior?
general 2021-02-05 03:07:01 i don't see how my builds quality is so heavily reduced. your the only one. and because I want to be able to walk around my giant fortress not just fly it. I like having a good working plane over one where i obsess over every angle
general 2021-02-05 03:12:58 god you specifically are why it was better for me to just not post my crap here
creations-chat 2021-02-07 00:14:17 Wdyt so far? it's gonna be porko's plane from the studio ghibli film *porko roso*

creations-chat 2021-02-10 06:23:32 So I finnished my Ju G.38 and was originally going to make the japanese armed heavy bomber variant (the Ki-20) but it took out all my favorite parts of the G 38 so I decided not too. well I just discovered this plane the Miazaki WP-3 a variant of the Ki-20 adopted by pirates that actually maintains all my favorite parts of the G.38

creations-chat 2021-02-19 20:35:41 ditch the shitty ass rope. those blocks are super unstable. instead use trails and motors to control said trails. use wing panels for triangle rigged sails and use blocks and wedges for square rigged sails. here's a diagram of a fully rigged ship and all of it's various sails.
creations-chat 2021-02-19 20:37:48 it's an inside joke not a spelling mistake.
creations-chat 2021-02-19 20:42:27 nah you don't even have to do that. for old sailing ships the motos just end up looking like tie offs

creations-chat 2021-02-20 01:44:37 I didn't back a mass downvoter who's only defense when being called out is "Lol someone crying about downvotes again" so-
creations-chat 2021-02-20 01:48:54 He downvotes everything. and your right I did say i'd mute this chat. the timer wore off. although I can't assume that means anything to someone who ends every other statement with some form of trollface so man I must be a huge hypocrite
creations-chat 2021-02-20 01:51:25 Mmm. deliciously toxic. Ight enjoy your emoji spam, really keep it up, I have better things to do

plane-crazy 2021-02-24 06:33:28 no
the-dump 2021-02-24 06:42:28 Fresh of the build plates with downvotes to Hell
I browsed for a build at which I could excel
An idea for a ship in need of some planning
rope, sails, and wood, but lacking in manning.
What luck, says I, to find such good fortune
A few blocks down later, I spawned my ship in
folded some stuff no idea what's it do
Jumped on the deck, and I yelled to no crew
fold down the thing! speed up the whatsit!
What's that motor spinning? Somebody should stop it!
switch to cam 1! (that's cam 2) Now I've got it!
Trust me, I'm in control!
the-dump 2021-02-24 06:44:20 indeed
the-dump 2021-02-24 06:50:35 I can do more-
creations-chat 2021-02-26 06:13:29 hull for a frigate I just started. because I have a hatred for both myself and the idea that interior is worthless in this game. anyways how does she look so far
creations-chat 2021-02-26 07:25:39 
creations-chat 2021-02-26 08:57:26 that ship tho-
creations-chat 2021-02-26 09:01:47 that's not really a problem I mean several actual ship types have sails like that 
the lack of any rigging is my problem

plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:42:23 so no it doesn't have to be out
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:44:11 fuck Im really upset now..
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:44:28 that was my largest most detailed build I just finnished it
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:44:47 I was in public
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:44:57 but I wasn't even working ON that build
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:45:10 I was working on a small boat
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:45:17 and they got it from my saves
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:45:55 yes.
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:46:19 that was just my first save- so it very well could be running through all of them
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:46:37 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:47:06 it was. that screenshot was taken after i had left and re joined to see
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:47:30 no it was still building
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:47:39 it was building it
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:47:47 block by block really fast
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:48:32 and I think it may have been going through all my saves too because I didn't have that opened
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:49:19 yea
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:50:51 so does that ship
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:51:10 but he still could just delete the rope work
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:55:36 okay no. apparently it wasn't running through my saves because it didn't build anymore afterwards
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:55:52 no
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:55:53 no
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:56:02 it still went in my saves to get the build
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:56:55 someone searched me out to copy specifically that build. likely someone here because I only posted it here
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:57:20 Im not
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:57:22 wtf
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:57:23 no

plane-crazy 2021-03-04 19:59:45 someone here saw my ship, tracked me down, and used exploits to copy it from my saves
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:02:35 a public one. but someone could have looked through the server list
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:03:45 It also could have been one of the 4 people who said they wanted to make a video on it and got mad and said they had already filmed and would do it anyways when I said no..
plane-crazy 2021-03-04 20:03:52 so they could get credit now-

the-dump 2021-04-11 12:54:03 uh- yeah gender is a spectrum mate- even if you think trans/nb people don't exist what about intersex people? or people who- say, get certain parts blown off. are they no longer the gender associated or? see it's blurry.

furries are fucking weird
general 2021-04-11 12:58:42 and I don't get half of these emotes I spam-
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:00:02 man. I have been cucked. good job.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:00:22 <:T_Pure:814983300899930142>
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:01:46 your definition of gender is based on what's in someone's pants right? well someone who is  intersex is literally in between male and female. or sometimes neither. so how do you work that into your idea of gender.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:02:58 You can't right it off as an "epic fail" when it happens as often as it does. there is that funny statistic about it being as common as red-headed people after all.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:03:48 either way- even if it was just 1 person. that still conflicts with your idea of a binary gender set because there is something outside of it. which means it isn't binary.
general 2021-04-11 13:05:15 I FUCKING FEEL THIS
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:08:17 because they are still a person? what are they then. even if it's "genderless" that's still 3 options. which isn't binary. and given there are a near infinite ways it can happen it spreads it out to a near infinite amount of options just off that.

general 2021-04-11 13:09:49 💥
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:10:44 yet again you've evaded the question.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:11:33 thats called s*xes
and again- that's not the case because intersex people exist
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:12:50 you were taught wrong- you can't demonstrate why gender is binary. we can demonstrate why it's not.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:13:46 that's just how it is. Parroting that gender is binary without actually thinking about it is wrong. it's just not.
general 2021-04-11 13:14:40 nobody knows-
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:15:22 the bible was wrong there then. again intersex people exist- that is not a man or a women.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:15:48 this tbh
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:16:47 yeah. so the bible was proven wrong. it said there were 2 genders. we found out that was wrong. therefor why are you still listening to it.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:17:50 Yes.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:18:56 I'm a Shintoist..
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:19:53 And dispite the fact that ancient scholars in the religion said there were only 2 genders. I can confidently say they are wrong. we proved them wrong.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:22:22 even if you write intersex people off as a "Disability" that's still 3. and again given that there is an infinite number of ways that it can happen that's still more then fuckin 2. which is what binary means.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:23:20 where do you put the line then. you agree there are more then 2 but what causes you to say there is a limit if it's not "man and women"
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:24:09 that's transphobia which I do believe is against the rules
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:24:52 then that's making fun of sucide. still pretty fucked mate.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:25:02 wait hold on how?
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:26:17 Intersex people exist. and even if you wright them off as a disability that's at least 3.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:26:57 which is still fuckin 3
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:27:32 yeah. that's not binary. binary is 2. anything other then 2 means there are more then 2 genders.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:28:13 that's still a third option.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:28:19 which is more then 2
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:28:56 not a mental disability if they legit have physically nothing-
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:30:55 you guys are just parroting the same things off each other and stating the same point without actually debating any of the things I say.
as such there is no point to say "2 plus another option even if rare (which it isn't but-) is more then 2" over and over again if your not going to actually give reaction to it other then "no 2"
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:31:47 I wasn't arguing about politics just gender. which isn't inherently political. and you were there too.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:32:29 which is still more then 2- like if they are just gonna parrot this same thing there is no point
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:32:58 adding politics to the end of it doesn't make it politics
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:33:11 and this was calm and collected until you showed up
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:34:51 it wasn't.. a bunch of people piled in and started piling in parroting the same thing off eachother.
you were apart of that
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:35:28 no. gender dysphoria is. the treatment for it being transitioning.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:36:36 this wasn't political until people showed up and labeled it political then tried to get me warned for being political
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:36:54 then why did you spend so long saying "only 2" over and over.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:37:31 thats not what he said.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:39:00 there saying "2 genders anything else is a mental illness" which- even if it's 2 and anything else that's still more then 2 like
bruh
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:39:59 and then in response to me calling out that's more then 2 they just go "it's 2 suck it up" again.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:40:51 and you did it again- this really doesn't help your case
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:41:19 it was- and then it blew up and now people want me warned for that. like bruh
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:41:58 and you demonstrated the same thing twice. good job that's a new high score.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:43:20 I didn't disobey rule 2. you lot got here and started making this spammy- it wasn't until you got here.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:43:59 you still are here though
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:44:18 it was being civilly discussed
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:45:33 we were legit just talking and you guys got here and started spamming the same "2 genders" not listening to anything actually said. that wasn't a joke it killed the conversation. you then went on and tried to have me warned.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:46:18 you not commenting on things you were never a part of exists, you know.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:46:33 that's an insult.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:47:12 if this is so obviously controversial why did you all flood this chat
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:50:55 This was a fucking pile on.
the-dump 2021-04-11 13:51:39 I'm not interested being somewhere I get dogpiled for no reason and warned for just talking.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 02:52:45 sure isnt.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 02:54:47 I don't put real nations flags on my builds.
And I don't particularly like japan.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 02:56:49 well aware.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 02:58:53 People downvoting a good build over a flag they don't like aren't people who's upvotes I wanted in the first place.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:08:49 I don't. It say this as someone who was born in japan it is one of the most exclusionary nations on earth. That said I prefer Japanese WW2 era subs and boats due to their interesting design philosophy. If you can find me a submarine aircraft carrier from a non imperialist power I will gladly build that instead.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:10:53 not aircraft carrying submarines (most large powers had subs with scout planes) submarine aircraft carriers. submarines who's primary weapon is it's aircraft.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:14:53 The real ones weren't exactly artwork either-(its kinda meant to look ugly and cobbled together last second)
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:18:08 Its fine- the fact that everyone whos downvoted has done so for a reason other then the build's quality means there downvotes don't really mean anything to me- its not really feedback its more of "Bleh we dislike u lull"
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:20:25 I like the flag sorry.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:24:30 rip
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:31:46 Thats.. not racism.. I don't like japan ***the country***. I'm literally Japanese.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:53:24 I do it with any of my builds that require a flag mate. And I feel no need to change it it's a nice flag that suits me well.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 03:57:20 Well aware. I don't really care what the community thinks of me though as it's not a very good one and I'd rather just address
 actual feedback
creations-chat 2021-06-20 04:02:52 I like how bright flags look on war machines- adds a bit of colour.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 04:06:38 It's a sandbox game. Im aloud to accessorize my creations to my liking. sorry :/
creations-chat 2021-06-20 04:16:02 they aren't really racist they're just saying whatever to "bully" me (see message above^)
creations-chat 2021-06-20 04:21:26 once again thats kinda the point of a flag- any flag I could have put there would have stood out to much.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 04:25:26 Because I'm not a pirate and its not a combat airship
creations-chat 2021-06-20 04:35:16 any suggestions for my sailing ship btw?
creations-chat 2021-06-20 04:49:42 I think my own I-400 crashed me
creations-chat 2021-06-20 05:47:12 my I 400 is my most downvoted build lol- dispite it being one of my best
creations-chat 2021-06-20 05:50:09 nah I like it there. Im more laughing at the people who down voted it over that-

creations-chat 2021-06-20 10:23:48 10 wing panels matter more when it comes to an up vote then all of the 8000 blocks I guess. Not surprised.

creations-chat 2021-06-20 12:11:42 Man remember when this wasn't the toxic chat. That was nice. Now my last 24 hours here have been watching someone get murdered by words over nothing and being pinged 23 times over my I-400 being too trans. 
Kinda sad really
creations-chat 2021-06-20 12:15:03 should I add a sail above the mainsail?
creations-chat 2021-06-20 12:17:37 nothings perfect lol, there has to be some improvement to be made 
Also yousuf it's undetailed because the drawing I did that it's based from had nothing much there its just part of the design
creations-chat 2021-06-20 12:19:39 It's a ship that ferries people across a river in hell. and It's based off a drawing I did- there never was a flag
creations-chat 2021-06-20 12:21:47 *Ik my I-400 has like 30 down votes just because of 10 wing panels. it's a 8000 block build*
creations-chat 2021-06-20 12:23:48 ight
creations-chat 2021-06-20 12:28:33 I heard "aft 5 inch gun" and thought someone else had made an I-400 and got excited 
am disappointed now- good build you get an upvote but man-
creations-chat 2021-06-20 12:37:53 well aware. I don't really care tho, people down voting for that reason aren't people who's upvotes I want.
creations-chat 2021-06-21 12:55:00 I made a turret- idk what to put it on yet
creations-chat 2021-06-21 12:58:48 The size is a perspective thing- I was trying to hide my character behind it. why would I remove the pink it's my fav color and works well with the pallet I'm using?
also it's named after a warrior cats character- as that tends to be my go too when I don't a good name
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:03:01 That turret I made was hella armored with it so- Its good
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:13:21 I really like mad vulpins building style- like ngl his bombers look nice- There is something about the simplicity I really like idk
*sadly I can't take insperation from the style as it would get called a tutorial lol*
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:16:30 nobody listens if you point it out though. my H6K was constantly called a tutorial. it wasn't one but people inisisted it was
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:22:29 I don't blame him jets are hella lame
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:29:27 I'm pretty decent freinds with the guy- he can build well and puts hella effort into *his* builds- they're same quality as the other stuff on here
he just uses a more simplified building style for his tutorials. I actually like his tutorial style more as something about the simple fuesalages of them- idk I like it and I'm bad at re creating it. I over detail too much
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:34:17 I only half agree with this- the wings suck- like I don't like 'flat' wings and they bug me
I do really like the simplistic fuselage style- specifically on his medium bombers it takes me back to when that sort of simplicity was acceptable in the community over all and I like it for that-
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:37:04 the D C-47 is my favourite in terms of simplicity it's really nice
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:40:50 his tanks are both really bad- and also weirdly detailed- like its not over detailed its got that simplicity but the details that are there are a weird selection of them
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:46:05 tbf literally any tank that isnt perfect would get mas downvoted- same with jets too
this is why I don't post my IRL based tanks anymore it's so pointless yall want every angle and rivet right even on a tank made for pvp
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:48:14 *Ima stick to taking ww2 tanks and like- adding bright paint schemes, fantasy or steampunk elements or random sail boat rigging thanks
I am the embodiment of tank junkie rage- 
my favourite tank is the T-35 landship and my I dispise the M1 abram tanks for lookin to basic- also my main pvp tank for the longest time was a modified american AAV
creations-chat 2021-06-21 13:58:55 actually thats pretty good- I mean ignoring the poor steering system (plane crazy boat mechanics are hard to get at first so Im giving that a pass-) thats a pretty impressive sail boat for a beginner. they can be pretty difficult to pull off and the fact he got the sails moving makes it even more impressive. also he did a trimaran design which I don't see often. overall it's a pretty good sailboat for someone newer to making them
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:02:54 then again my sail boats aren't all that either-
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:05:30 this was one of my earlier ones and yeah its kinda awfull now- (I had no idea how jibs and staysails were done lol)
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:09:04 nah my sloops are a flex- *you don't understand how much of a pain that main sail was aaa*
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:12:40 r u s t (use trails and some slight brown tinges on the parts)
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:17:24 I remember I got such poor feedback when I posted this and I still don't understand why
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:22:10 the longest part wasn't building it but getting it to sail straight and steer- as it's a unsymmetrical catamaran- also thats not my best boat its like one of my least impressive lol
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:27:00 the exposed lock looks fine there lol
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:33:31 opinions on making one of these?
creations-chat 2021-06-21 14:35:34 it's a fox armoured car and I think it could be done but its gonna be a pain-
creations-chat 2021-06-22 18:57:43 re making my favorite tank because my old one was garbage-
creations-chat 2021-06-22 19:02:08 Advice- historically theach tore up all the upper decks and replaced them t fit more guns and better crew accommodations- as such the use of signs as planks on edges, a lack of study railings and an overall cobbled together look of the upper section of the ship is accurate to the historical one (though most depictions overlook this)
creations-chat 2021-06-22 19:05:36 Blackbeard rebuilt half his ship after he captured it. as such it shouldn't be too pretty the whole thing was held together with ducktape and string
creations-chat 2021-06-23 07:15:38 So.. my games saved are screwed- my CA-90, I-400 and large schooner are all gone saved over by a main battletank I was working on- not by me mind you (I haven't saved it to other slots) but when I tried to load them it said the saves were corrupted and then loaded the tank.. so they're just gone now

one was larger and required 8 more trains to aim it (thats the generally displayed one)

creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:17:39 This is called suppression and is discrimitory. No thanks.
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:20:38 Because if I can't display a trans flag on my personal builds without harassment that's suppression and is actively reductive. It forces people to say silent about themselves and their problems and that isn't a good thing.
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:25:54 I mean its not sexuality it's apart of my identity. I put it on my builds to represent myself. and how is putting something on my build shoving it in your face? I'm allowed to do so If I want. the fact I do so isn't an excuse or reason. the real reason people throw a fit about it is simple biggotry
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:28:09 My Identity isn't a problem until people make it one.
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:30:16 I don't choose that as a whole? It's the only thing I have a cute flag for but It's not me as a whole.
Also you literally do have too announce your identity to everyone- that's what a name is and thusly how one introduces themselves. 
this is my last message and I started it before the change topics announcment.
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:32:30 ya'll are all the fail-
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:35:42 You mean people walking up to my t-35 ragdolling on it and sending it flying? yea I noticed
creations-chat 2021-06-24 15:37:53 nope- thats not my suspension as it didn't happen until the update it's something to do with motor 2 Im pretty sure- is not my suspension that flings me its generally the turrets.
creations-chat 2021-06-25 06:31:17 T28 progress
creations-chat 2021-06-25 06:34:43 Its tracks also do that thing- though I might change it's detatchment to used timed charges from front to back - caus GUP scene>accuracy
creations-chat 2021-06-25 06:42:22 Just this-
creations-chat 2021-06-25 06:46:46 I don't..? Irl the tank took a while to convert its drive to just one track set then detach them. I however don't hold my builds to realism that's dumb- my t35 looks too narrow to me if it's accurate- so I widened it, and mmy ratte doesn't have the flak turrets because it looked too cluttered with them to me. I'm not building for realism I'm doing it for fun.
and the absurdity of GUP is very fun.
creations-chat 2021-06-25 06:48:50 then wth is the point of building a BT-5? lol
creations-chat 2021-06-25 06:50:53 Sorry you can't read more then a sentence. <:shruggingpheo:723638011987886135>
creations-chat 2021-06-25 06:53:13 or ya could just you know, stop being pointlessly inflammatory like this. just a suggestion. Might avoid problems in the future idk.
creations-chat 2021-06-25 06:58:09 More inflammation. shame. Ima step away from this now and get back to my building thanks.
creations-chat 2021-06-25 07:26:39 obligitory reminder the tank Im making was 'lost' for decades before being found in some bushes in Virginia. real hidden
creations-chat 2021-06-25 07:30:30 thats not even the funniest part- what's really funny is that of it's 4 track sets (2 removable) it only had 3 when they found it.. so what the hell happened to the fourth one?
creations-chat 2021-06-25 08:30:39 That makes sense- it's still really funny
creations-chat 2021-06-25 13:29:31 someone should do this
creations-chat 2021-06-25 14:03:08 should I make my T-35 into a proper *landship* by giving it random ship parts- kinda like how I did my half track monster forever ago?
creations-chat 2021-06-25 14:07:12 It was- sadly it can't fly anymore as motor 2s broke but It can still drive around- here's the original post https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/820574047590154271
creations-chat 2021-06-25 14:09:18 I just kept adding stuff to my half track until I passed out and that's what came of it- it's one of my favorite builds because it's pure just whatever I felt like-
creations-chat 2021-06-25 14:11:27 ya'll are the only ones insisting we're doing something again.
*someone just went and retroactively downvoted my half-whateverthehellitis. danm that's consistent effort*
creations-chat 2021-06-25 14:17:00 that wasn't my only conversion of that half track- I got a lot of mileage out of that danm thing 
Also no idk what the church is.
creations-chat 2021-06-27 16:22:09 I wanna build the WP-30
Miazaki's version of the Japanese KI-20, itself a variant of the Ju G-38
It keeps the G-38's wing windows and adds like- a ton of turrets and fun stuff
creations-chat 2021-06-27 16:24:20 
creations-chat 2021-06-27 16:42:19 Turns out the monitor and Virginia did a lil bi more then fight- as clear by the results
creations-chat 2021-06-27 16:44:49 ik- it looks like the result of the monitor and Virginia's side fling
creations-chat 2021-06-27 16:47:01 why does this have so many upvotes?.. I mean the hull is fine but the rigging and lack of any attempt at staysails is.. aa
creations-chat 2021-06-27 17:01:51 uh.. no?.. the sails look really off and there are no staysails
creations-chat 2021-06-27 17:04:40 It's not.. thats not my ship- my ships have the opposite problem of having better sails then hulls
creations-chat 2021-06-27 17:06:42 I can only really be critical of older ships- I don't vote on much else as they are my main specialty and the only thing I feel I can cast votes on
creations-chat 2021-06-27 17:23:46 Add them heccin like- wedgy things
creations-chat 2021-06-27 17:40:21 Fair enough- it's honestly pretty good it's just not 100 upvotes good-
creations-chat 2021-06-27 17:42:24 ehhh- there is a lot of room for staysails there
creations-chat 2021-06-27 18:30:17 or if the builds contain things people are scared of :/
creations-chat 2021-06-27 21:14:45 "why are you like this"
creations-chat 2021-06-28 12:17:52 I love the heart shaped AA mounts on the back of US ww2 frigates- like they are just one of those thins I really like for no other reason then "oo pretty"
creations-chat 2021-06-28 12:34:07 I was gonna mount a katusha rocket platform on my T-35-propoganda esc landship version but like- there isn't anywhere that makes sense it's already so crowded
creations-chat 2021-06-28 12:40:30 but there is no where to do it- like the only place is on the engine grate but then they'd fire right into the ship mast/radar/tower thingy on it
creations-chat 2021-06-28 13:57:23 there is a mast and bridge up there
creations-chat 2021-06-28 21:45:46 I have decided to build what has to be the most obscure plane ever- so obscure I can only find 3 drawings of it and found it through a typo- the caproni CA 91
creations-chat 2021-06-28 21:52:19 from what I can tell it's a hypothetical continuation the design philosophies caproni started with the the CA 51 scout plane and continued all the way to the massive CA 90 (one of my favorite planes and one I have previously built) weirdly despite closely resembling it and seeming like the direct derivative  of it- this plane seems to have come before the CA90 as it maintains the closer together engines of the ca 70-80 (an inefficient design that was changed midway through designing  the CA 90)
creations-chat 2021-06-28 21:55:30 The CA-60 is unrelated to said philosophies and was more akin to his other passenger planes he had previously made which had all been developments off of the CA-4 and 5
(you can see how this design could become the CA 60)
creations-chat 2021-06-29 02:17:08 should I paint the CA 91 like my other italian aircraft (bright base color with italian tri color lower wings and tail) or should I go for something more prototype-y or something closer to realistic cammo for a sea plane
creations-chat 2021-06-29 13:49:11 so the CA 91 is a bit bigger then the CA 90 and im going to have to fold the tail- how do I get the custom angle to look right in the transition from the fold (im still kinda learning)
creations-chat 2021-06-29 13:51:14 you can't use motor 2 for a custom angle it spazzes out..
creations-chat 2021-06-29 13:53:49 what-
creations-chat 2021-06-29 14:14:44 wehraboos scare me- ya'll really be likin big ineffective tanks that much that some of yall are willing to drench themselves in the baggage they carried- and like- they weren't even that good as a whole there were far more hilarious failures then the one or 2 good tanks they made and even then by the time they made some good tanks- it was too late for em
creations-chat 2021-06-29 14:16:49 imagine being unable to read more then 7 words smh
creations-chat 2021-06-30 05:04:29 lol when did ya'll decide my ground vehlicles were any good
creations-chat 2021-06-30 05:12:17 I was in PVP and actively bein shot at lol-
bot-central 2021-06-30 05:59:31 !servers
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 13:27:05 idk man I think Italy is pretty dope-
plane-crazy 2021-06-30 13:29:04 my I-400 was so big it used 4 sets of huge suspension convayor engines to move and dive- underwater its dive speed was 200 and its top speed was 400 but in the air it flew at like 20,000
creations-chat 2021-06-30 15:53:44 the weakest part of my new snow mobile is it's gun which is unarmored against bullets and unhoming rockets-but much like the original one thats not really an issue as it moves too fast to be shot at
creations-chat 2021-06-30 16:15:40 fast isn't the right word- its top speed is 230 afterall- I guess a better word is menouverable- like its very very sharp in turning and its sliding around makes it hard to hit
creations-chat 2021-06-30 16:18:03 it also teliports so missiles are just useless-
creations-chat 2021-06-30 16:43:02 my build was shown next to it so-
creations-chat 2021-06-30 16:45:04 that was kinda the point yea-
creations-chat 2021-06-30 16:47:08 my build is also shown on my plot so the rules are fine :/
creations-chat 2021-06-30 17:28:30 you guys are really fussing over nothing but ight I'll delete it smh
creations-chat 2021-06-30 17:30:32 man never heard that one before, good ol "I can't argue with you so let me hurry and discredit so I don't have too"
creations-chat 2021-06-30 17:32:46 Not really, you seem to be though given how adamant you are to ping me every 2 minutes.
creations-chat 2021-06-30 17:36:02 oh my god your still pinging me bruh let me video game in peace
creations-chat 2021-06-30 17:41:12 I was playing bioshock infinite smh
creations-chat 2021-06-30 17:56:21 and proud.
creations-chat 2021-06-30 18:02:46 you gonna back that with anything or just leave a baseless statement?
creations-chat 2021-06-30 18:06:04 I'm not the first person to do that in a mocking manner and Its also not the first time Ive done it- this was just the first time It goot that much attention :/
creations-chat 2021-07-01 02:05:29 Anyone have any more arisoni I should make?

creations-chat 2021-07-01 15:50:25 Incase you thought I had gotten enough of that soviet BDE-
creations-chat 2021-07-01 15:55:05 false-  just simp for whatever country has the wackest shit for me to build- so generally the USSR or japan
creations-chat 2021-07-01 15:57:12 I'm from japan I'm immune to the weeaboo virus thanks-
creations-chat 2021-07-01 16:04:39 Y E S
creations-chat 2021-07-02 17:09:03 gave up the helicopter- someone suggested I do this and honestly it's a way funner sounding build
creations-chat 2021-07-02 17:12:56 like there is a lot of interesting stuff Im gonna have to do- from the large skeletons in the trophy room bit to the aircraft hanger and ramp- the airship might very well be the easiest part
creations-chat 2021-07-02 22:43:48 e x c u s e m e w h a t
creations-chat 2021-07-02 23:09:06 I'm allergic to them- but that's okay it's not like I'm going to crash into a truck full of them after beating cancer or smth
creations-chat 2021-07-04 06:44:29 Freaks of nature span a globe, that's too big to deny
With canine guards, we'll travel there and spit into their eye
I can't wait another day
For my life to waste away
We'll make it a joint venture, before we're in our dentures
My Spirit of Adventure is you!

creations-chat 2021-07-04 17:48:45 *also the trump tank is both really good and also absolute sin*
creations-chat 2021-07-04 17:50:48 this has nothing to do with the creation.
creations-chat 2021-07-04 18:47:36 airships are just too big to build in full scale in game and it's kinda saddening
creations-chat 2021-07-04 18:52:36 like I really like the layout of this ship but it's too big to properly do
creations-chat 2021-07-04 18:59:27 Ya'll gettin political
creations-chat 2021-07-04 19:21:09 i did once- it can't easily move though
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:18:06 Why are so many people slappin the American flags on things rn? like half of these don't even look that good-
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:20:08 ok.. and..? it's just the 4th
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:22:39 I'm not British and why is it on July 4th..? Nothing significant happened that day that I can remember.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:24:59 I'm not. I don't get why you'd celebrate independence day on the 4th didn't you guys win the war later on then july?
and also
what the hell do you even do for "independence day" it seems like just a nationalist flag wave from what i've seen
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:28:05 *also July 4th 1778 isn't the 4th of July because of the whole calendar thing so ya'll still doin this on the wrong day*
what the hell does "celebrate independence" mean though?
teenagers celebrate independence the first time the drive alone
an entire nation doing it seems a bit much
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:30:27 because china gave up on actual communism a while ago and in china the word "communism" is just interchangeable for "government"
doesn't seem that different from the american 4th all things considered.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:35:17 Idk man, disenfranchising native americans, owning the Philippians, bleaching people, reducing panama to a puppet through a coup, reducing every other central American country to a puppet often through coups, forcing much of the eastern nations to their side often through undercutting democracy and with coups- just to fight communism, korea and Vietnam, anything ever involving the stupid tax payed for U-2 spyplane we still use- all sounds good to me.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:38:08 my PC autocorrected it to that because it dislikes proper nouns- you knew what I meant
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:40:30 I'm not a chat lurker I'm here pretty often :/
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:42:56 there isn't an argument  or debate here- nobody has offered anything of note against what I said- and I was adding to a joke myself in laughing about america. one person called out a typo and another person called me a lurker. thats not a debate.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:45:03 that's adding to a joke. if you want to pick that out am I aloud to pick out every other meme sent in this chat as unrelated?
creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:49:04 Sir this is what we would call continuing an argument. stop it.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 02:00:53 I didn't say it was bad- I just don't think it's the best nation to ever grace this earth either- also we were told to drop this
creations-chat 2021-07-05 02:04:54 I don't respect an island that is so full of itself it splits itself into like 7 parts then acts like it's one thing but not really while harrasing  everyone else for 2 centuries and subjugating it's neighbor to the point of mass starvation- several times
creations-chat 2021-07-05 02:06:57 That was also a joke oh my god you guys take everything too seriously- while somehow still spamming memes I don't understand.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 02:08:58 how was what I said any more unrelated then- say this?
like how am I the only one warned for this-
creations-chat 2021-07-05 02:12:11 yeah. I'm the only one warned for continuing 'something' despite it being one a joke (which there doesn't seem to be a problem with here) and two several other people were doing it. ya'll have a double standard and I'm going to just stop posting here about anything other then *my builds*
creations-chat 2021-07-05 02:15:04 with a joke- which nobody ever actually disagreed with you guys just went on about how "omg argument" despite there being no argument- and I got warned
creations-chat 2021-07-05 02:17:09 got it. you guys wat me to stop talking. I'll stop talking.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 03:30:06 120, 100, 70 to 140, 100, 70 in a gradient.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 05:50:18 Color pickers from direct images work poorly for plane crazy due to lighting- it's better to find a direct pallet or to just approximate lots of he pixels into a few shades. there are programs for this.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 07:59:44 I need something to do between long stints of working on my spirit of adventure- any improvements I could make for this?
creations-chat 2021-07-05 08:02:20 there is a lil bit that sticks up there it was kinda intentional-
creations-chat 2021-07-05 08:04:29 that entire front piece would be able to fold down and be used as a snow break for the vehicle 
thats the latch for it
creations-chat 2021-07-05 08:06:53 like? that one looks fine and it's a good place for the motor anyways
creations-chat 2021-07-05 08:10:18 idk how accurate this one is but it gets the idea across. I used several images mostly from modelers as references actual images of this type are hard to find
creations-chat 2021-07-05 08:13:21 that's a lot of motor lock for such a simple build but I'll try it
I will say I will not be doing anything that requires me removing interior-
creations-chat 2021-07-05 08:16:45 also might take a crack at the snow shoe tonk
creations-chat 2021-07-05 08:37:39 what's really amazing is how tank like it really is- like design wise
for ease of production it used a tank's engine and used old armor plating from BTs and obviously the turret
creations-chat 2021-07-05 08:48:06 Aerosan are some of my favorite soviet ground vehicles. they're sleds. with guns. what isn't to love?
creations-chat 2021-07-05 17:33:01 that hull tho
creations-chat 2021-07-05 17:42:05 that's fair enough
creations-chat 2021-07-05 18:13:22 Tu-95. it gets overlooked to often even though it's a dope plon
creations-chat 2021-07-05 18:25:12 early Junkers transport and passenger planes are like- really nice
creations-chat 2021-07-05 19:11:06 and I love it
creations-chat 2021-07-05 19:39:52 I wish ropes had physics- a barrage balloon would be epic
creations-chat 2021-07-05 20:20:26 after my spirit of adventure I might do one of these bigger deployment trucks ^w^
creations-chat 2021-07-05 21:08:55 I wanna make a sci-fi spaceship at some point but every time I make one it just becomes a pseudo airship and I just make another airship
creations-chat 2021-07-05 21:48:57 man just had to talk trash
creations-chat 2021-07-05 22:04:21 I am gonna build a weapon  superior to any of your nooby tanks
creations-chat 2021-07-05 22:09:47 lucky
creations-chat 2021-07-05 22:54:29 No. it is a force if nature. the instrument of god.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 23:38:58 "come look at the submarine I just made"
the submarine:
creations-chat 2021-07-05 23:43:02 your right, your right- let me correct it
creations-chat 2021-07-05 23:52:23 idk I always use wing panels- you can actually see them
creations-chat 2021-07-06 00:05:26 I like yeeting people with rope flags- my mecha destroyer SPG does a good job at sending them to south America
creations-chat 2021-07-06 00:35:53 same
creations-chat 2021-07-06 05:13:32 that moment when someone sees you working on a airship and pulls out their own and it looks like this
creations-chat 2021-07-06 05:19:42 I do this but with boats- to be fair my problem is I work from the inside out- which normally works fine. it's how I get impressive interiors with my tanks, planes and dirigibles (the like one good thing I'm known for)- but with smaller boats it just makes them a bit oversized
creations-chat 2021-07-06 06:00:30 *trying to decide if the spirit of adventure should have proper lighting- like as nice as this is it took like 7 hours of fiddling*
creations-chat 2021-07-06 06:43:22 could also do the steampunk pidgeon from my favorite game-
creations-chat 2021-07-06 06:47:51 
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:00:34 I like it but my favorite jet is the sea vixen so I know nofin
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:34:00 idk I like it- it's nice and simple
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:37:16 like if your just downvoting because "it's not good enough for that many upvotes" without an actual reason to downvote an otherwise allright build, your just gatekeeping simplicity
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:41:18 allright. just wanted to make sure you knew you were being terrible. carry on the gatekeeping then. 

<@!524910047080480769> your boatmobile is good and there isn't a good reason for anyone to downvote it. don't listen to anyone saying otherwise.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:44:58 I get a vote same as everyone else- so pretty sure it does
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:49:55 I was hoping you'd ask- I actually really like the jet but the paint is kinda.. ehhhhhhh
a better gradient from the white to blue and some marking details would really help.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:52:16 the transition from white to blue is weird
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:54:55 oh what the hell- okay I didn't know that (I'm not a jet person) I'll change my vote then
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:57:23 I agree the jet looks great I was just wrong about the paint because it looked odd to me-
creations-chat 2021-07-06 07:59:41 I mean.. both are good though.. sure one is better but the boatmobile is just kind of fine? like there isn't any reason to downvote it and a lot of people saw it and thusly upvoted. I agree the turtle is better but that doesn't leave any reason to dislike the first for just being fine. and all your doing by doing so is dissuading someone from building bigger more complicated builds like the turtle.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:03:59 generally yeah but that's also not always the case. Especially not if the community decides to spread a meme around about it being shit, decides they don't like 5 wing panels on it, decides it's overdone or from a property they don't like or decides it's the wrong version of something based purely on subjectivity-
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:07:59 Idk mahn I could talk lik this if ya want bruh
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:15:53 I want to make like a- mecha thing at some point
something that has legs or maybe wings
probably song bird a scarab or maybe even howl's castle-
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:18:04 doing howl's castle would be fun as so many little bits of it move just slightly. the whole thing is fluid- idk how I would interior it
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:35:24 It's a complex ass build and any examination of it for more then 2 seconds will show that-

but people see a boat with 100 upvotes and get salty about their average over motor locked jet getting less then downvote
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:37:26 he literally just explained how.
danm you guys are quick to jump to insults.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:39:54 the wheels had nothing to do with any of that- but they also work with the build I don't see the problem with a block in the game being used.
the-dump 2021-07-06 08:40:10 
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:42:07 People do this with the wheels, skis, props and jets too
but given your scale allows for it or you just using it for other detailing there isn't a problem with doing it outright
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:44:10 "Alright I'd like to point out that, even though it's very small, I used a fair bit of motor lock. The details I used motor lock for include:
- the black trim going around the whole body
- the flag; double sided text with a piston locked trail
- the wheels"
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:48:44 To bring landing gear flush with other blocks you have to lock it into them.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:50:48 nope. they don't sit flush with half blocks
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:52:51 ok and? it doesn't matter how trivial it's added to everything else.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 08:54:54 again is there anything wrong with it? because you can point out how simple or trivial it is all you want but if there isn't anything wrong with it there really is no reason to downvote.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:02:58 okay and.. there isn't anything wrong with the build?
Sorry people get bored of the 7000th overdetailed jet fighter.
so a simple build posted at the right time attracts a lot of positive attention.
all that trying to start a mass downvote of it does is discourage people from building bigger grander things
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:06:03 but the same applies in reverse- when every "good" build looks the same and the community standard is so high on complicated builds. a small simple but nice looking build looks appealing. this isn't rocket science it's oversaturation.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:08:04 the trailer is really good- the boat needs work
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:10:21 Because this isn't a first time thing- you guys gatekeep and drive out newer people so much over such nonsense.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:14:03 That's not rank farming it's people building things they like? their isn't some nefarious reason or coercive plan it's just a nice looking build made by someone who liked the show or game. sorry your 5000th jet doesn't get as much attention.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:17:36 I wasn't talking about Minecraft- I'm not defending those they're oversaturated as hell just like your jets are.
but not anything that isn't 2000 blocks with more motors then surface blocks deserves a downvote
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:20:20 yeah. but that doesn't mean anything that isn't a 4k block custom angle jet can't have 100 upvotes. downvoting for reasons other then build quality or because it has "to many upvotes" is just petty gatekeeping.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:22:23 don't mince words. that's just gatekeeping again.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:26:37 maybe rather then complaining about something being more liked then you wanted it you guys should take some notes. if a simple ass boat boat gets more upvotes then your stuff maybe rather then trying to start a mass downvote train on it you should think about what it did right to get that much attention in the first place. your not leveling anything. it was level when it was clear what people's opinions on it were. your just mad it got more upvotes then what you guys think is "real effort" regardless of quality or what people actually think.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:28:58 ah yes. the famous "I refuse to acknowledge arguments so let's check that grammar" 
you guys really like this one.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:30:59 this is still misrepresenting my point. I don't care how many upvotes it gets but people downvoting builds because "they have too many upvotes" is just petty gatekeeping.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:33:42 doesn't matter if they are newer or what.
who are you guys to dictate what the entire player base is or isn't allowed to think? this is what gatekeeping is. you guys are a relatively small group trying to dictate what the entire community thinks is okay on arbitrary self serving reasons.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:36:07 really. if your the player base and you hate the boat build- wonder who upvoted it?
strange it's almost like you guys are a majority voice minority.
And not actually representative of the community.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:38:09 Entirely unrelated. I don't see why you need to bring this up every time you speak to me when it is liteally never related.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:42:04 we all get one vote. complaining about lesser skilled people being able to cast their votes and disagreeing with you the minority, is called elitism.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:47:31 I mean. Several people like me here I have several friends in this community. I'm not leaving just because this one channel of elitists thinks I am satan incarnate or some SJW or whatever the hell. I don't care what you guys think of me.
I'm still going to call you lot out on being the minority and it's telling that whenever I do so you guys just reply with either a useless meme or an emoji. 
You never actually have an argument to back your elitism and it's telling.
you guys don't actually have ground to stand on here and no new players have to listen to your nonsense. you guys are like plane crazy boomers and it's just sad.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:50:24 you really have nothing else to get at me for? like you keep going back to that despite it being ENTIERLY unrelated.
and no your ranks don't back your elitism in the slightest- gatekeeping like this is how a community dies.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:53:16 V V V LIKE THIS V V V

once again you guy can't actually back anything so send a bunch of memes screenshots and a literal wall on the stages of grief which have nothing to do with this.
God this chat is so toxic. You guys are the embodiment with everything wrong with "high standards plane crazy"
it's just elitism with shiny paint and no actual backing aside from a video game you wasted more time on.
Reacting to this with more memes, insults or otherwise unrelated comments to my arguments only proves my point further.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 09:58:02 v v v LIKE THIS v v v   Reacting to this with more memes, insults or otherwise unrelated comments to my arguments only proves my point further.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:02:08 I didn't lose. none of you have proven me wrong or even tried too you just continued shouting in your echo chamber until I decided enough new people had seen it to not be dissuaded with posting.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:04:15 and the chorus of the echo chamber continues.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:06:25 v v v LIKE THIS v v v   Reacting to this with more memes, insults or otherwise unrelated comments to my arguments only proves my previous point further.


cute trick. I can say "no you" too.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:09:45 v v v LIKE THIS v v v   Reacting to this with more memes, insults or otherwise unrelated comments to my arguments only proves my previous point further.

see this is funny because It was literally what you just did. yet that flew over the heads of you and all of your friends all responded with the exact same things. this chat is such a toxic meme laden echo chamber that either you can't even recognize your own hypocrisy or you refuse too because it would mean recognizing your wrong.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:13:48 v v v LIKE THIS v v v   Reacting to this with more memes, insults or otherwise unrelated comments to my arguments only proves my previous point further. Same with 5 people saying the same thing over and over again.

welp the echo chamber of people who already disagreed with me when this started have decided that I am "defeated" 
guess that totally and unbiasly proves me entirely wrong
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:19:17 v v v LIKE THIS v v v  (copying my message while saying nothing on it doesn't help your case either it just further proves the echo chamber) Ps. a paragraph is 6-8 sentences.

''we shouted down the original builder therefore we are right"
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:21:45 That was addressed to Prayut.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:26:35 V V V FURTHER PROOF V V V
 No it won't. I was the only one warned last time. the echo chamber consensus is that I'm wrong, political, argumentative, so on so it'd just be me like with the warn.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:29:37 Oh my god literally nobody but you has mentioned the trans flag sthu about it it's unrelated entirely
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:33:00 of course they will. again it's an echo chamber and I'm disrupting the toxicity. why would someone address the problem when they can just let it sit in equilibrium?
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:35:24 also for me being the one continuing these arguments- there are like 7 of you if I'm so wrong why don't you just right me off? I have to keep talking to defend myself as the moment I stop all 7 of you are going to start trash talking *which you always do*
you guys can drop the crap whenever
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:37:27 v v v LIKE THIS v v v   Reacting to this with more memes, insults or otherwise unrelated comments to my arguments only proves my previous point further. 

the fact so many people had to reply to that one message only proves it further. you guys keep falling for this.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:39:36 and I never disagreed with either of those points. my argument was that the appropriate response to that isn't to mass downvote it.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:41:50 I don't think namnamm knows what elitism means :/

ratio doesn't need to be falsely balanced by a bunch of elitists. if it had that many upvotes it was probably for a good reason even if you can't discern it.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:44:46 wrong reply 

this was literally my only point- a bunch of people liked it- a few people hated it and so tried to start a mass downvote. It had nothing to do with the builds quality 

and I only care because downvotes and upvotes should actually mean something. you know related to the build?
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:47:44 oh idk maybe the spamming of a meme around it started by one person that massively changed the upvote downvote ratio. seems that person's opinion has more sway.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:50:05 okay I have shit to do I'm done explaining shit to you. this warn will be fun. you can stop pinging me with replies now.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:53:09 Nah man I have shit to do so I have to leave. if you lot are so insistent on my banning I can just leave. I don't need this server for self assurance like ya'll
creations-chat 2021-07-06 10:55:14 Enjoy your echo chamber then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
general 2023-04-14 04:02:11 I have returned
Way more mellowed out tbh
general 2023-04-14 04:03:18 🤭
general 2023-04-14 04:03:47 I will not start dumb fights anymore
general 2023-04-14 04:04:31 Oh I was here like 2 years ago
general 2023-04-14 04:05:09 And I posted a build that I thought was pretty good at the time
But like I would now agree was awful
But other people thought it was good too
general 2023-04-14 04:05:23 They down voted it because it had a trans flag on it and it started a lot of shit
general 2023-04-14 04:07:30 I built many more bote
Got much better at the game
Got pretty good at micro point guided guided missile systems (where you don't have to enter a camera)
Made drones to let these have super long range from my ships


And then dropped the game for a year
general 2023-04-14 04:07:36 And now I'm back
general 2023-04-14 04:08:38 I have a ton of current vehicles that I just have to sit down and remember how to unfold and unanchor
general 2023-04-14 04:08:48 It took like an hour to figure out my Corvette
general 2023-04-14 04:08:57 I still need to add it's 16 missiles
general 2023-04-14 04:10:10 But to do that I need to design an new missile because the old bug my glitch missiles used to use to bug out builds doesn't work anymore
And then I need to load them into launchers because they sit in 4×4 tubes radially on the deck angled outwards Infront of the deck on a 30° angle
And then I can be done
general 2023-04-14 04:10:26 No actually then I have to do the sounds for it
general 2023-04-14 04:11:58 Name's back to pink
general 2023-04-14 04:12:04 Where it should be
general 2023-04-14 04:13:54 I'ma need a fresh of breath air after that
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:06:21 Yall what's your least favorite but like common/popular building technique
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:07:43 Mine has to be the overtexturing/overdetailing stuff
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:08:44 Like if you don't have a strong understanding of the lines and shapes on your build
And a strong color pallet 

No amount of random sand signs ladders and emojis are going to help
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:09:34 Camera lock is Allright when it's done for smaller stuff
I love me a good Lil gocart
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:10:04 Like when they're well done and not too detailed but nice looking 
Mwa
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:10:44 Camera lock is also super useful for ships and bi planes
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:10:54 No I do
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:10:56 Lots
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:11:25 I'm talking about style of detailing where people like spam the material brush and random objects like ladders
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:11:47 Over the side of there perfectly good ship
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:12:22 I work primarily on ships
And this is like

A very accepted form of detailing for ships for some reason
And I hate it
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:13:13 Nah thats supply loaded but the shape of the tank is bad
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:13:23 The color pallet is good so it works tho
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:13:32 Idk about tanks
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:15:04 Nothing is better then really smooth color pallet that highlights the shapes of your ship 
You don't need to spend hours detailing every turret 
Nobody is going to get that close and that level of detail looks bad from far away
You need good shape color and form
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:15:07 Also value
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:15:46 Before you detail
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:16:28 And like people just don't do it
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:16:36 Hang on ima find an example of what I mean
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:19:48 this
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:19:54 this stuff is awefull
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:20:49 but is done on ships all the time ad hen passed off as looking good for like no reason- I can't tell what's going on in that picture because I can't make anything out because all the texture clash
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:21:21 and this would be a really good build if not for this problem
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:25:24 Jets are a bit different that's camouflage
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:25:57 and it's fine then
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:26:07 tanks are fine too
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:26:18 but like- ew
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:26:29 this could look so much better
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:29:02 there are like 4 colors in this entire build and it looks so much better then the 2 above
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:29:47 because they used shape and color properly
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:30:24 Idk it just bugs tf out of me because this isn't an issue with new players (they are still figuring out the game) it's an issue with the PCC people
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:30:56 why are we being goofy and doing this weird build shit
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:33:13 no fr PCC does this weird complex = better and I think a lot of people lack appreciation for a nice clean build like this one
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:34:06 I strive for both- complex designs using complex methods, simple shapes and pallets
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:34:47 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/893640744647163916 also check this boat out I think it's my favorite I've found so far
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:35:51 I have
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:35:54 It's very good
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:36:24 I was going to use it as an example but it was bigger then the bad examples so didn't demonstrate the point
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:37:10 when my acc gets unbanned in an hour ima do a photo op of all my gen 4 fleet to post in creations
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:38:21 I got banned from chat after someone baited me into arguing about being non binary lol
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:38:31 so I said naughty filter word for gender
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:38:47 which got my acc nuked for 24h
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:38:59 I am lgbtq but I vibe
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:39:29 me too tbh
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:39:52 I'm just here for the botes 😎
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:40:59 If you want to DM about it I can but I want to get back on topic please
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:41:16 neither do I-
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:42:44 I put gay flags on all my builds because it triggers people in game and in creations chat- and I have always found that absolutely hilarious 

but other then that naw I vibe
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:44:32 lol
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:45:35 I am an agent of gay autistic shipworking and nobody will stop me
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:46:07 yes-
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:46:24 come at meh
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:46:56 I was actually assigned intersex at birth hence why I'm non binary now
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:48:48 well that wasn't a U boat it was actually Japanese and while I have since built a U boat with gay flags
I don't see how it matters it's funne either way because it makes other people mad
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:48:59 I was born with parts of both
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:49:10 I have both chromosomes
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:49:56 but because I produce testosterone I cannot get pregnant and do not have a chest
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:50:02 I also present male
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:50:08 I am not
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:50:21 I don't have a knob
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:50:45 'male bone structure' isn't a real medical term
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:50:55 no that's not how anatomy works lol
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:51:00 no
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:51:02 okay
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:51:20 I will explain what I have okay
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:57:11 I was born with mostly female bits but with male balls that had not left my body and a slight protrusion which I maintain (it's not that different from other girls tho) they removed my balls so my bits are mostly male. However I produce a lot of testosterone so I don't have breasts and grow facial hair so I present more masculine.
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:58:18 because it's not just your balls
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:58:35 and mine were internal
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:58:41 my body is still producing it
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:58:54 I shouldn't have had any
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:59:27 also we're not abt to pass it up
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 09:59:47 even if I wasn't intersex- I'd be a real trans ya sillys
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:00:17 and I'd expect ya to respect me and my work as much as anyone else here
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:00:30 and lots of other stuff
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:00:44 well yk what I meant then
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:01:10 both
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:01:38 I'm not actually sure lol-
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:02:06 well no they did but why would I care
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:02:31 it would have been explained to me as like a child
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:02:38 not really
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:02:47 we're more common then red headed people
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:03:01 yep.
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:03:07 that's real
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:03:32 well how would you tell
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:04:00 If you saw me in public how would you know lol I'd just look like a flat chested guy or girl depended on if I shaved
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:05:53 my endocrinal system
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:06:02 I do not
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:07:00 thanks bot
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:07:11 no
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:08:25 I have both hormones and my body is mostly female but fluctuates to male depending on my hormonal levels
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:09:15 well it's not legal to do so in my state because of laws meant to stop trans kids
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:09:52 I actually Identify as non binary now
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:09:59 I disagree
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:10:19 not really
but I prefer they
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:11:33 this is much harder to explain when I can't use anatomy terms :/
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:12:59 for the record- trans people are valid regardless of their assigned gender at birth 

can we talk about boats now 🤭
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:15:53 inflammatory but okay
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:16:06 anyways my beautiful cruiser
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:16:23 
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:16:26 I love this thing
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:16:49 oh I can't show the build rn my acc is banned for a half hour still
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:17:26 I just have to add the 16 missiles and it'll be done
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:17:35 I'm using my point guided missiles
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:18:06 so it'll be PVP capable but like the ship is to big and laggy to be PVP usable so nope
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:18:23 Ima make them mouse guided glitch missiles
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:19:02 It also has an orbit drone that pops up onto the heli pad and takes off allowing me to guide the missiles (which are guided without cameras normally) at long range
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:19:13 nah
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:19:24 I have a design where you don't have to enter a camera
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:20:07 corvette
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:20:10 sorry u rite
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:21:49 I steer away from large ships
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:21:55 small and smart
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:22:09 maybe
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:22:51 it's kinda big too tho
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:24:42 Like the kora class is my largest ship
and this is the kora class next to some other ships
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:25:41 It's not that I can't
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:26:07 It's that I don't like them as much as the simple but well built corvette
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:26:15 or PT boat
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:26:36 like battleships are cool but there's something nice about small boats and destroyers
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:27:22 I built me one of them
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:27:28 a U-boat
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:27:33 I was also building a submarine
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:27:43 and I built a bad I-400 a long time ago
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:27:47 don't look it up
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:27:50 it's bad
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:27:52 I am ashamed
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:30:04 other ships I'm working on include:
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:31:47 that ones fun because It has ship launched guided torpedoes of my own design
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:31:57 which I have never seen anyone else use before
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:32:28 and they don't use cameras they're mouse guided
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:32:48 and can submerge it's to fight subs
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:33:21 all that in a 1*1 torpedo
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:33:30 and then to have 4 of them
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:33:51 plus depth charges plus a search cam plus rockets fireworks and anti air
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:39:06 I make good ships
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:39:11 good airships
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 10:39:15 eh tanks

creations-chat 2023-04-14 13:21:03 can we like- maybe fix the vote system or smth it seems gay as hecc
I remember it being better what changed
creations-chat 2023-04-14 13:24:43 Lol I would love to know what standards are responsible for the downvotes on my poor corvette
creations-chat 2023-04-14 13:29:33 like idc normally but yall know for a fact it is to early for that ratio on THAT corvette
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:17:38 To this day I still wish I had made it just a biiiit longer
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:23:05 my builds tend to go for a more toony style for sure- but they look pleasing to the eye in a way highly detailed realistic builds don't and work better with the game I think
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:29:09 That's a non binary flag
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:32:38 flags can represent anything numnuts 
pirates flew flags that stood for no nation
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:35:17 well no- thats a bit of a misconception. historically almost no pirates flew skulls, that came later when they were written about by Victorian playwrights 
Pirates flew red and black flags depicting other things tho!
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:39:34 It's armorment is ass because accuracy to the real one from japan. 

And the ship is representing me. Me alone. why would I put some country Idc about.
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:41:41 idc what the server likes the server is dumb lol- as for realism

that's what the ship was for you raise flags to show things about the realistic ship you just put them on.
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:44:21 do you get off to putting others down? like literally none of my boats I posted are bad chill.
they're toony and simplistic, but that's a stylistic choice not something to try and spill over on like legit nobody cares butchu
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:47:07 you lot have some high ass standards- like are you fr 
people in here really gonna downvote because a boat hull has a wedge or seam when the rest of the boat is entirely perfect
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:50:13 I don't see what that has to do with anything? what standards are you trying to set you guys look like wine snobs lol literally nobody cares this much about nonsense like this
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:52:52 which look fine? exposed locks look fine in ship hulls they aren't a cardinal sin.
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:54:54 you guys are the only people who have ever had a problem- you're the only two people I've ever seen this toxic lol 
it's so gross you're so high on your own supply

elitist snops fr fr
creations-chat 2023-04-14 14:56:58 You're an egotist and I find your question repugnant. I'm going back to photographing my years worth of builds now lol kindly bugger off
creations-chat 2023-04-14 15:02:20 no but the motors being on the outside bug me so much I hate them so much omg
creations-chat 2023-04-14 15:12:21 there is one painted on in real life in the same place, it'd look better with further detailing of the rest of the ship im sure but ofc I  never did it 

also I don't do it in the water because I really like getting the hull-keel right and you can't see it in the water (thats why I do boats and not big ships)((generally))
creations-chat 2023-04-14 15:14:35 you could make it work with better coloring- I just didn't get to it yet whenever I had the save
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 15:22:21 Ight I think I have posted my boat credentials
creations-chat 2023-04-14 15:33:05 honestly I think the bus looks good just take some screenies during the day and repost because I cannot see it
creations-chat 2023-04-14 15:39:38 It's bringing hell apon your shore
creations-chat 2023-04-14 15:45:57 do I not have it?
so I don't
oh well
creations-chat 2023-04-14 15:56:07 oh- of which one? and which rooms??
creations-chat 2023-04-14 16:02:33 ight give me like a day tho I'm heading to bed lmao
creations-chat 2023-04-14 22:28:29 Because it's an LST so I decided it's livery would be 666 as it's "bringing hell apon the shore"
creations-chat 2023-04-14 22:32:19 Running joke
I'm non binary
And while I'm generally pretty chill now and don't go around talking about it I think it's funny as hecc when you put pride flags on military builds because military enthusiasts get really really upset about it

Because it ruins the realism

As if the rest of the build is somehow ruined by 3 wing panels
creations-chat 2023-04-14 22:36:07 Oh ik I love it it's actually hilarious how triggered the server gets when the pretty boat I posts happens to have 4 pixels of the flag they aren't supposed to like
creations-chat 2023-04-14 22:58:23 Lol

plane-crazy 2023-04-15 00:24:25 or game ID
creations-chat 2023-04-15 00:25:49 ight creations chat how do we get bobox music working in the year of our lord 2023
does pitching it up still work?
creations-chat 2023-04-15 00:33:09 why's that?
creations-chat 2023-04-15 00:35:12 what exactly-  did they do to sounds? it's been quite a while for me since I have played.
creations-chat 2023-04-15 00:53:56 triggered pcc member moment
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:02:16 screenshotted ❤️
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:13:12 Absolutely! A lot of people on here are about to give you some super useless feedback and tear it apart-

dw about them
Ima give you some real advice on building better ships as you're clearly a new builder and I love making ships and helping new people with ships.

so for some quick things I noticed on your build specifically disconnectors can be used in place of where you have ladders to create a smooth look!
loose ropes are pretty ugly in builds- Instead use trails, set them to not appear and then use them to represent ropes and lines, you can get more complex by using motors to angle them!
Never use full white 
use something slightly below it on the RGB
it's hard to see your superstructure as it's just to bright to make out any of the shape

lastly here's some genuinely useful guides I've seen come out recently that I really wish were a thing when I was new 
the channels that posted them (because links are against the rules are)
-Aria ch.
 Advanced shipbuilding tutorials
-Uprising
Plane crazy ship building guide ep.1
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:16:07 I have noticed most my ships that used to run fine like- legit do not run anymore I haven't even been able to show my kitakami because the game breaks when I try to load it
which sucks because it was my largest ship and had 40 launchable torpedoes lol
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:22:49 you could say it's ***plane cra-*
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:24:54 thats- longer then me- I've only been playing for just over 2
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:27:41 my best build's save broke
no longer has it's coolest feature (the 40 launching and guiding deck fired torpedoes)
doesn't fold without breaking my game
and lags out because the game isn't updated
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:33:42 fr it's so depressing I can't even show it here because it's just too broken and I didn't do anything. It also had a launching mouse pointed plane (that I could control from the ship and drop bombs with using no camera) and like- kitakami is an insane ship it was a crazy build and all of it was functional


like the boats on the back could be lowered and guided with my mouse
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:35:43 but because first the save messed up
I no longer have the finished ship
So the torpedoes, aircraft and a lot of other bits are gone

and the whole thing no longer spawns in because plane crazy is broken
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:37:50 that's significantly larger then anything I have ever done but maybe someday 
I'll keep it in mind
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:41:25 god it's so pretty
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:45:57 the complexity was insane-
there were 40 torpedoes on my build
each one is ship launched (meaning once it hits the water it has to restablize and balance) and guided once they hit the water by pointing my mouse at my target. the turrets on the side of the ship that fired the torpedoes were on motor 2s and the torpedoes fired 10 at a time giving me 10 launches per side not that side matters because they're guided anyways.
then there are the 4 deck guns you see on the front which have to sit along and under part of the super structure with 2 of them not hitting it.
and then near the aft several sets of anti air batteries.
along with the catapult which could be swung out over the side of the ship and launch a mouse pointed plane to go and bomb things

all gone


and this is why I stopped playing for a year
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:49:59 No but like Its bs I'm still upset- I built a massive ship with stupid complexity for the sake of "this is to complex to work in plane crazy"
and then the game just deleted it :/

also mate I'm the least ego driven person in this server
I'm not talking this much because I like getting off to my builds (like ik you do)
I'm talking this much because I'm this autistic about this ship
it's a cool ship
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:52:54 that build is ancient and I never finished it or it would have had more detail I'm sure.
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:55:40 If your feedback is negative on principle your opinion means nothing 
you likely did not see my finished ship
mostly because I didn't work on the torpedo launchers in public servers I worked on them in a private friend server.
creations-chat 2023-04-15 01:59:11 like bro downvotes and is negative about everything and doesn't give helpful feedback 
holds an impossible and elitist standard to try and make a weird ingroup for what a "good build" is

and if you do that enough your opinion starts to not matter.

this is why PCC is laughed at by everyone else.
creations-chat 2023-04-15 02:02:23 Yeah- But I don't. and yet they have insisted my stuff is beneath consideration for some reason because it's elitism for elitism's sake. there is no respect for the builds for that person it's just about making a high standard. and all you have to do too not abide by it is keep posting cool ships

it's pretty goofy
creations-chat 2023-04-15 02:06:18 the 2 most recent ones are old and bad yep, the rest of my ships are good like ik my value this isn't an ego trip
creations-chat 2023-04-15 02:08:38 I'm actually not intrested in starting drama or getting banned so- silly me 🤭 Ima go-
creations-chat 2023-04-15 02:24:22 they have builds I like but most of them are ehhhhhh at best
I would never use a tutorial from them or anything- the simple style is just nice
creations-chat 2023-04-15 02:39:02 you border on harassment yk
creations-chat 2023-04-15 02:41:27 sigh- I give up
creations-chat 2023-04-15 04:08:53 only after being harrassed this much online for no reason -.-
creations-chat 2023-04-15 04:35:44 I don't know how to camera lock and like
We get it you have more experience in the Lego game
Stop fanning your balls over the trans person ya won already everyone here already agreed with ya
creations-chat 2023-04-15 05:01:04 and that other one that shall not be named
creations-chat 2023-04-15 06:17:02 I am so dumb I figured out a lot of the client side lag, so it turns out at some point hover engines were changed. and they used to be really good engines for small to medium boats as they could be stable below and above the surface and maintain one speed regardless of movement 

but now they lag your client based on block count and that- makes a lot of sense I need to gut a lot of engines to do some lag proofing : )
creations-chat 2023-04-15 07:11:33 I have like 4 in limbo of development for over a year I felt that
creations-chat 2023-04-15 07:34:55 oh lord
creations-chat 2023-04-15 08:08:14 "Problematic" = gay? or.. what
creations-chat 2023-04-15 10:12:21 I should be less nice- I'm litterally teaching this person how to build one of my turrets because I'm hoping it'll show them how motor locking can be used with small turret stuff
creations-chat 2023-04-15 23:35:37 <@770381790648467496> I am not a tank person by any means by I love your build! it has very good esthetic cohesion. Something most PCC "good" builds mess up
creations-chat 2023-04-15 23:38:51 like the cheiften build's colors do not match it's insane level of detail and because there is no difference in color you can't see a lot of the detail so it looks ugly

but got upvotes for having lots of motor lock? pcc has weird standerds
creations-chat 2023-04-15 23:48:15 The one in creations
creations-chat 2023-04-15 23:52:23 Like the stuff is impressive- but anyone can do it- why does it  have that many upvotes when it's color pallet is so low effort
creations-chat 2023-04-16 09:13:03 Kora class corvette
creations-chat 2023-04-16 09:53:10 That's the same build as one I already posted just at night with some cool angles- also 

no I will nawt
because It makes you mad personally :3
creations-chat 2023-04-16 09:55:17 well that flag is non binary so it has nothing to do with that anyways isn't that convenient!
guess It all worked out in the end.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 09:57:44 also nothing to do with who I prefer- you're clearly quite confused and I don't have time for you sorry not sorry
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:01:55 I like it.

and it makes people like you come crying to me about it. which tells me automatically which people are safe to be around and talk to and which one's aren't.
I never have to ask "are you okay with trans people" because if they are they'll just say" nice build and if they aren't they'll start a mess in this channel

and when you are talking to another person it's usefull to know if they see you as a person from the start

TLDR
to make you upsetti spaghetti so I know I can stay th away from you :3
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:06:40 nah it's the non binary flag and it makes bozos here super uncomfortable because they're awful people.

the fact is

all flags stand out that's kinda the point of a flag.
nobody would question any other changed flag
People don't like that the flag representing the minority they don't like is being posted more commonly then they'd like womp womp cry about it.
I make you guys upset about it on seeing it so I know to distance myself from you and it works.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:09:20 idc- it's not their build it's mine.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:15:19 no it does. normal people don't randomly ping me about it. only weirdoes and biggots do.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:18:06 I like it because it makes biggots mad. simple. when they are mad I can tell they are biggots and avoid them.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:21:15 This is actually toxic- drop the flag thing for a second can we cut it with the realism thing as a whole- realism looks bad in plane crazy's engine you can make build's look good esthetically but they are not going to be esthetically realistic
Also not all builds are going for realism
also also not all builds need too go to realism realism does not mean the build looks good 
the build looking good means the build looks good
if a tank is bright red but looks esthetically pleasing it's a good build. 
despite not being realistic
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:26:19 well that I-400 wasn't finished
the flag would have had a frame and probably had the colors or mats changed to be duller

so I wouldn't say it right there was a good built it had potential to be good if I had kept detailing it the same way all my other ships
the fact the one example of a bad looking ship of mine you can point at is one that wasn't done is telling.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:28:41 it doesn't. at all. but the fact that you think it does ruins your value.
you wouldn't apply this scrutiny to any other flag lets be realll :3

you guys downvote it because you need to let everyone else know that being visibly non binary isn't okay and you think being non binary people are bad! which is biggoted!
And good for you- you signaling like this is nothing new it's called  a virtue signal. I make notes of who downvotes based on it consistently and move on :3
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:32:47 Litterally I was assigned both at birth but pop off
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:34:54 I love reporting people to discord for tos violations 
gotta be my fav activity
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:37:45 no- pop off just means "but okay"

I have both sets of chromosomes and was born with parts of both and with both parts of my endocrinal systems. (which is what it's actually called there is no gendered "bone structure it's hormones and endocrines")
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:39:46 so I am literally biologically both

ya'll actually skipped biology this isn't complicated https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex
we're more common then red headed people
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:46:54 biological gender (what you're assigned at birth) isn't binary you guys just need to actually open a book. it's bimodal. 
it's mostly polarized towards 2 ends with a great deal of stratification in the middle.
binary would mean 2 things.
and it definitely isn't that as I am living proof of
I would have developmentally been female (as all of you would have been) except instead of getting one more chromosome I got more and my body grew parts it shouldn't have. I got surgery to correct those parts but my body still makes testosterone from one internal nut and so I can't get pregnant and I don't have a chest. also I grow facial hair.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 10:59:11 Then what would you call me?
creations-chat 2023-04-16 11:04:06 Howso? I have both chromosomes, female male parts down there but no chest. 
I have male hormones and my endocreinal system fluctuates between a more male and female body meaning I can literally grow a mustache or lose it depending on the time of year
creations-chat 2023-04-16 11:07:04 I'm intersex it's both
But you said their's only 2 options because you don't think intersex people exist which like
creations-chat 2023-04-16 11:10:07 My existence literally makes your whole "there are only 2 gender thing" not work and you just don't have a solution to that 
You were so sure of it too lol :/
Rip
creations-chat 2023-04-16 11:15:55 that.. doesn't change anything. literally, I said I'm both. also nah google has okay info on it the problem is intersex is a broad term to refer to a broad range of experiences so like it's literally different for every intersex person
you're gonna get differing information just because of the sheer variety. even biological gender is complicated and there is so much in between the 2. your "basic biology" was actually "dumbed down biology" and you should take the time to look into the real thing it's pretty intresting
creations-chat 2023-04-16 12:56:18 this is known as the foxbat effect it is well documented
creations-chat 2023-04-16 14:25:39 Trying to get expert shipwright for my corvette and mods haven't responded  L
creations-chat 2023-04-16 14:28:48 You're not going to get anywhere by arguing with anyone who started by saying "your builds are bad look at my amazing builds"
Because they're an egotist 
Quit while you're ahead
creations-chat 2023-04-16 14:31:00 I'm helping you here.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 14:33:07 Actually nevermind carry on jef 🤭❤️
creations-chat 2023-04-16 14:35:13 Oh ik I was trying get them to shut up and take it as a win 
Because they're an idiot
🙄
creations-chat 2023-04-16 15:07:27 Why are none of the good members even remotely good at color or value theory
Like  I'm throwing shade it's annoying how bland the coloring on popular builds is
creations-chat 2023-04-16 15:12:10 No that's not what color and value theory is
It's just having a pallet and utilizing it to highlight the shape and details of your build regardless of real life coloring to draw the viewers eyes to the correct parts of it and make it look visually pleasing
Where as if the colors are too dark or similar or just one color with a lot of tiny details it can be visually confusing and noisy and a lot for the eyes to have to break up
Basically not as nice looking
This isn't conjecture this is art theory
creations-chat 2023-04-16 15:14:32 No that brings back noise and makes it look messy again

Also Jeff my corvette, coast guard boat and missile boat all have enough to have designer range votes and those are my most recent builds so idk what you mean.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 15:16:35 Coloring- like with a pallet
creations-chat 2023-04-16 15:20:14 My dude you literally spend every waking moment in this channel insulting  every build you see for some reason I don't think you get to talk about ego drive out of nowhere
Like legit you just don't like anything that isn't your own
creations-chat 2023-04-16 15:22:18 Im not sitting here for another "creations chat dunk on fonnex for having trans flags on their  boat and daring to defend it" 
You can compare me to whoever
I'm out
creations-chat 2023-04-16 15:55:37 I already expressed it's never surprising
It's called a litmus test
It gets people to self report themselves as bigots
Like <@1004207882784489472>
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:36:36 "exposed locks" ppl moment
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:41:41 my ships generally don't have any issues with looking bad because of them though. like when visible they don't detract anything. This idiot wants an excuse to to poke fun at my build tho so he's picking the exposed motor locks for some random part of my hull to poke at
the real point of that meme was hating the flags :/
creations-chat 2023-04-16 17:49:19 Yeah they did.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:10:29 intended??? I'm sorry intended by what lol naw intersex people just exist making it yes, a bimodal range. this is biology.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:14:38 yeah it was a slur.
Very funny
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:18:14 so should I report you for the rule violation now or-
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:20:22 builds containing derogatory language
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:22:27 you've been being gross to me for days staff will do something.
also it obviously says a slur.
And I have my own screenshot.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:24:38 No literally. for 3 days. you guys are vile what did I do to you
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:33:56 Like how is there only 2 when I'm literally right here in the middle. and then people try to argue that "well you're wrong thats not how biology works" okay I guess I'll just like- disappear" 
suddenly be born with XX cromosones rather then both in diffrent cells
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:36:08 BRUHH JUST GOOGLE WHAT INTERSEX MEANS I CANT
I was born this way I didn't choose anything- I have both chromosomes I am both genders biologically
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:40:28 it manifests differently in different intersex people so I have different chromosomes in different cells of my body

Also no- academia regards intersex as a gradient (bimodally) existing between male and female because each intersex condition is a different mutation  
not bad or wrong 
literally normal evolution like any other human body part we're normal people.
we're actually statistically more common then red headed people.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:42:30 oh yeah but so was every human trait at some point. that's all genetics.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:45:46 had nothing to do with them- 
gender identity is a separate thing (not a mental illness you illiterate)
my gender identity is non binary
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:47:56 oh but we're not anomalies either that looks like a tiny amount of people but that's actually a lot- like statistically very significant 
also your original argument was that it was a defect. which it is not.
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:50:14 no I think it started with the nonbinary flag this time 
I'm a silly lil intersex and ppl got curious abou it this morning
creations-chat 2023-04-16 18:58:25 lol that's so childish I literally did nothing what do you want from me

creations-chat 2023-04-25 12:29:39 That I'm non binary and like making people upset 
I also like pride
creations-chat 2023-04-25 12:31:54 Oh that's because I use default PC colors because I was being quick
I plan on dessating all the flags at some point like i had all my old alliance flags dessated 
They do look vibrant af rn
It bugs me to
I'll fix it
creations-chat 2023-04-25 12:35:27 But It should be noted
All the mfs here who constantly bitch about how I use them 
Don't actually care because they ruin the build 
Or they are unrealistic 
Or they are to repetitive
Or they don't match the vehlicles 
I've torn all these apart before
The real reason is they don't like non binary people being visible 
And a non binary person building good is to visible

This is why the last time it came up i got forever muted by someone's mod freind
creations-chat 2023-04-25 12:58:41 I post in creations to archive not for votes
creations-chat 2023-04-25 13:02:45 Given plane crazy is not stable (my best build a working 1-1  IJN kitakami with all 40 torpedoes and its aircraftcatapult launching)
Doesn't work anymore and I never got screenshots


That's why i post
creations-chat 2023-04-25 19:38:34 ugh creations chat harassing people who clearly have potential want to learn and are literally asking for feedback 🙄

Anyways

On future ships I'd recommend starting with the hull in a top down view from some blueprints too really try and get the shape down. Especially on battleships.
Because not many ships actually flatten out fully and without angle locking you will need to pay close attention to this shape.

Next is the color
Never use full white, you can get close to it but I can't make out a lot of your build because it's too bright to see. Tone down the color in the editor and it'll still look white but be easier to see. To further distinguish parts of the ship you should have several shades of white. 
The easiest way to do this is to take your main color into an online gradient generator and use that.
Then with all those shades you can have different parts of your superstructure stand out from each other just enough to all be made out from each other. 

And finally I think a lot more detailing in the hull deck area could do a lot of good for the build it looks fairly plain
creations-chat 2023-04-25 20:10:08 No <:m_:778994206948589638>
creations-chat 2023-04-25 20:12:10 Why not paint the engines?
Definitely some interesting choices
creations-chat 2023-04-25 20:19:44 These things 
I want them to raise up from the deck and fire as a real one would

Should I use the in game rocket or try to make some form of actual missile loader with magnets or smith
https://youtu.be/0Xwpgf3CeXg
For the record its meant to go on this
creations-chat 2023-04-25 20:22:55 The person litterally asked for the feedback :/
creations-chat 2023-04-25 20:27:02 They said thank-you for it
You're getting mad for someone else rn 🙃

creations-chat 2023-04-26 00:39:35 TRU blame roblox for that the game's running fine it's their recording
I'm on a laptop that cannot handle screencap so ya'll get the roblox slideshow
creations-chat 2023-04-26 00:42:35 yes and every build without one is made by a coward
creations-chat 2023-04-26 01:33:50 
creations-chat 2023-04-26 13:33:00 Coming back to 4 pings I won't read 🤭
creations-chat 2023-04-27 13:11:35 my hot take is that if they wanted to revive game activity and server activity- making HOF 100 votes again would go a long way
it's not about upholding a standard it's about maintaining a community and this game's is so bad fr fr
creations-chat 2023-04-27 14:11:19 yeah there would be a huge spike of entries at first but after it cooled off it'd be pretty good I think
creations-chat 2023-04-27 14:57:09 Nah honey it's dead because you don't highlight when cool things are posted which discourages people from posting cool things.
It's dead because ideas aren't shared to new people
it's just assumed you should have them
we don't share  good builds or ideas for others to take inspiration we share them to set a standard which locks those 'bad' players out
creations-chat 2023-04-27 15:05:53 more would be made if we did a good job highlighting the few
and we don't
or like encouraging anyone to do anything who is even remotely below the bar
creations-chat 2023-04-27 16:26:11 that's been done it's called blacklist

if a submarine player ever blacklists you just give up they know your IP and there is already a torpedo inside of your colin
creations-chat 2023-04-27 16:28:25 good submarine players are like- the ULTRA rares of pc tho
like danm we died off
creations-chat 2023-04-27 16:30:54 it's kinda pointless- any ship big enough for this to make sense it makes more sense to just use guided or jumping torpedoes to take it out 
which is nice 
also break apart torpedoes work stupid well too
basically it doesn't have much use as it'd be to specific
creations-chat 2023-04-27 16:34:26 the most complicated torpedoes are aircraft dropped spiral torpedoes but they work too well it's so unfair
creations-chat 2023-04-27 16:38:52 I wish the build detect bug worked for torpedoes because then you could make area of denial homing torpedoes or mines and it'd be pretty great
Wouldn't make sense on current map but none of this does I just like the functionality of it all
creations-chat 2023-04-27 17:26:11 I don't think flairs would work as well as some kind of chaff would 
Like a bomb of exploadable material behind you that keeps you safe from the missile
creations-chat 2023-04-27 17:39:03 not at all-
creations-chat 2023-04-28 02:31:12 I need to see it painted to judge honestly
obviously it looks bad when all we can see is the wedges
creations-chat 2023-04-28 04:24:35 I am on redesign 3 of my mystery boats aft deck
Anyone got any functioning depth charge racks?
creations-chat 2023-04-28 13:49:12 People down voted the torpedo? Why lol it does exactly what it's meant too
creations-chat 2023-04-28 13:51:42 
creations-chat 2023-04-28 13:54:19 Idk what else they could be down voting on tho like it was just a showcase of them
creations-chat 2023-04-28 13:56:44 Bruh fr what is your problem with me
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:03:28 I've done 2 posts on this boat
It's a wip


And it's because historically it takes me months of procrastination for builds to be finished
But I like posting actively
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:13:38 Well none of thes have been showcases of the ship
I already did that
It's been showcases of other stuff that launches from it that I didn't get to post with the original ship because I'd of been to long and you'd of complained about that
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:17:27 Well the torpedoes are done
And I was posting the torpedoes 
Because they're neat 

Also I'm deleting the I-400 post I'm tired of it getting used whenever someone wants to show an example of my ships

Because legit it was a build I posted Because I was never going to finish it
Was incredibly unfinished
And while I explained all that all the context goes away when people post it with "this is their bad ships" bruh no it is not you mfs pick my worst build I've done to show like I also wasn't happy with the I-400 thats why I stopped working on it
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:21:14 No but fr sorry my flag (meant to be a highly visible symbol representing the identity of the nation operating the ship) was to visible 

I don't identity with japan Russia or India so I don't put their flags on my shit.
They are all awfull countries. 
But I do identify with that flag and they're my ships.
Idk why people complain about flags being high visibility like it's not the point of a flag
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:24:40 Oh idc about what countries did in the past that's stupid
I don't like Japan because they're a racist ethnostate
I don't like India because they're government is fascistic which sucks because India is MASSIVE like stupid big and not covered enough 
And I don't like Russia for the same reason just turn it up times 10
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:33:29 True! Countries are dumb
Hence why I don't put their flags on my labors ifgaf about them
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:51:23 Bruh tf do I do like fr
I post a lot and it's the same build 
But always showing off some smaller system on the build like launching missiles or smth because I give all my ships little recoverable boats and drones and shit and then don't get to post them with the build because it's be to big of a post and yall hate that too

Am I just the worst for being a loud gay and posting frequently?
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:56:20 What
K now I'm confused
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:05:06 No I thought he was attacking me
Like- he was
Then he backed off for some reason
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:09:16 Bruh just kick ppl like this from the Chat fr this mf gives no feedback

Also this is actual unde behavior
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:20:52 Icky
K
So
You're point is dumb
I'm not pushing anything
I'm posting same as anyone else 
My ships have a flag that represent me but it's not being pushed on you its just a symbol I like being on my ships.
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:23:49 Nah
Nothing about my identity should be a secret
This is literally just "well you can be gay just stay in the closet"
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:25:54 I should also point out rq for everyone snickering along with morfix
They don't care about any of this It's super disingenuous 
They just like harassing me and have made this very very clear
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:28:15 No not really
You don't have to look at my ship lol
 But it is mine
And I can put whatever I want on it 
It isn't an attack or forcing you to do anything 
Again this is the "you can be gay as long as you're quiet about it and stay in the closet" shit 
You just don't like it when you have to see non binary people and that's not my problem
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:32:38 No but like think about it for a second 
What is the goal here from this idiot
He doesn't want to see non binary flags on builds in his game
Which okay maybe you're fine with
But let's go with it and say I deleted all the flags
Nobody posts pride builds nothing
It's a completely gay free game that isn't "pushing anything down his throat"
It starts to look like non binary people just don't play the game
Or aren't allowed too without keeping themselves in the closet

That's what I meant
It's the same idea that he's pushing and it's ick
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:39:27 Like when you actually break down his position it's 

"People shouldn't post pride flags in creations and expect anything other then harrasment"

If you want me to stop posting the flags it starts to look like non binary people either don't exist or aren't allowed to post here
And that's where we're at

That's your solution is I delete 6 wing panels before taking screenshots of my build snd PCC doesn't have Lgbtq builds posted because it would be shoving them down your throat 
And what's revealing is that this position literally just means you don't think non binary builds are okay
You would rather have this big argument every time I post then see 6 wing panels
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:41:41 Hey I'm never the one who starts it

Unless you count posting a build as being not allowed because it'll cause drama 
All I do is post and get shit for it for days
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:44:22 You're right
Except for when I want a flag on my build 
I already explained why I don't use country flags I think they're dumb
Why would I credit fucking India for my build idc if they made the original ship 30 years ago I spent hours making this one
I wouldn't use any countries flags they don't represent me or the effort I put into it
So when I want a flag I use ones that do represent me

It's a creative choice
That's all it is and because its over the game I'm posting about it does have something to do with it
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:46:29 None of this is to push anything on anyone else
If you're tired of seeing it you're just tired of seeing non binary people and like idk how to fix that??
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:49:44 None of this is contradictory to what I said earlier
Both are true
I put it there for my own reasons
And also the only reason they gave a problem with it is homophobia/transpobia 

That said idc about downvotes or criticism I'm happy to explain again and again why they are there and all the reasons I like them being on my builds and all that

But mfs really dm gore and shit over this
Like the harassment is insane every time I post anything 
My torpedoes didn't even have a flag because they were on an unfinished build and people downvoted them just over not liking me
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:51:47 Debate isn't about convincing your opponent it's about putting on a show to move over your audience to your position
You know this too
Don't pretend anything I could say would make you less mentally ill
I was arguing your points to break them down for everyone else's benefit you're a lost cause 

Now stop trying to start shit with everyone fr
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:55:08 I explained it's relivence and why they're there and you agreed
This "it shouldn't be there it has nothing to do with the game" doesn't work anymore you conceded it has to do with the game because it's a sandbox game and my creative choice in it .
I don't need more reason then that. 
And the moment you accept that you then have to turn and go "wait so why is everyone upset at a lack of reason if they didn't need one" and the answer becomes pretty obvious
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:57:16 I actually did I spent 3 whole messages breaking it down
They just weren't directed at you because as you've kindly demonstrated you're too fucking mentally ill to read them
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:59:20 Bro don't engage with them think for a second

All flags are pride flags you don't fly a flag you're not proud of like what
They're just arguing to start shit don't take the bait
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:01:29 It won't be the last one this happens every time I post 
My last 2 posts didn't even have flags they only came up because morfix is obsessed with harassing me over them and will bring them up every time if nobody else does 
Hence why he started this
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:03:59 Gay people can be transphobic like him 
Lgbtq people aren't monolithic and he's not special


Also yes I only make boats because 1. Autism and 2. I don't actually play too often and it takes a while. Plus all my boats are capital F functional so they're usually like 4 vehicles in 1 build and it takes a while
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:07:33 That's so many ppl here Tho it's unde shit I hate it because actual debate will be going on and there will be 2 of these mfs doing nothing but flinging their own shit on the wall
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:15:02 Bro is also flinging shit on the wall and thinking literally anyone else cares like bruh is going ape mode in the bathroom and nobody out here in the real world is effected by your mental breakdown 
Stop trying to start shit back up its that easy
Unde fr
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:17:04 Stop engaging he's arguing in bad faith
He doesn't believe in anything or know what he's talking about he just likes arguing for the attention
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:19:08 I'm calling you mentally ill because you're still going and it makes you look mentally ill 
And have been this whole time lol 

Again
Unde behavior fr
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:21:12 Visby class corvette needs a Sombrero and i will not explain

Side note should I do a visby
Like do you think it's something people would like in my more cartoon looking style of build
Because I already have the turret, side panels missile systems and torpedoes developed there is pretty much nothing I'd need to develop for it just angle lock everything into a pretty hull
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:24:30 Exactly
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:26:53 Also I think I could nail the paint because most modern stealth warships in the game are painted badly so you can't make out details and just look trash
But I've done a build in the pallet before and it looked pretty good I think (not my best but yk)
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:29:45 Wow original hottake from morfix how observant 


Chat already moved on from the last argument you started about this literally you do this every time I do anything
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:32:51 Again going back to weird undes who start shit for literally no reason

Morfix everyone
He started the last argument and stepped away when it was going
The moment it ended and I wasn't kicked out of chat he is trying to start another one
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:42:36 I'm putting a visby on my list of consideration vehicles (like I don't have 2 ships to do rn)
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:46:23 <@684812219040792628> I would recommend more trail rigging- diagonal lines are super important for a ship's visual design and it looks good rn but needs more lines over the ship to even out it's composition.

creations-chat 2023-04-28 18:47:53 Like the tank game? what's wrong with it
creations-chat 2023-04-28 19:06:39 well- yes.. that's part of the fun
also fish loss 😭
creations-chat 2023-04-28 19:22:22 roblox is the child exploitation website what about this is surprising-
creations-chat 2023-04-28 21:05:10 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1101561453384839268
Part of me dies every time a really nice build is harmed by the use of either too dark or too bright of colors
It's not that hard white looks bad
Solid colors look bad
You have to tone them down because the game has no lighting 
That's just what it is
creations-chat 2023-04-28 21:07:53 No I was referring to the Canadian plane

But no also all these tanks I can't see detail on because the paint us all one color is just as upsetting
Yall spent hours getting that one armor plate to sit right on the hull of a tank just to blend it all together because you paint it the same color
I don't get it
creations-chat 2023-04-28 21:16:10 Oh yeah it's got other issues
But it'd be infinitely better if I could see the shapes on it
creations-chat 2023-04-28 21:19:36 Also I want to be clear
That person is obviously pretty new I'm not interested in talking too much about their plane it's just fine 
Anyways 
White can look fine like you can pull it off
Just not 250 250 250
It has to be lower and with a tint contrasting your other color
creations-chat 2023-04-28 21:24:21 The TNT locking ----> extreme elitist "I only play in private server because all public servers have cringe Whitename builds" pipeline is real 
What fun is there in being alone in a server where nothing weird can happen
creations-chat 2023-04-28 21:32:02 Cringe 
Pcc elitism fr
creations-chat 2023-04-28 21:37:41 I'm at dinner rn but I've argued about it before 
Tldr plane crazy community uses private servers, ranks and whatnot to form ingroups a vast majority of players will never be a part of
And cannot possibly get into
When all the best people in the community lock themselves in boxes with other "only good players'' it stifles the community over time
This isn't that apparent anymore but it was so bad in like 2021
creations-chat 2023-04-28 21:43:00 I still want to make a Functional blimp that can effectively hunt submarines
Nothings stopping me I have the torpedoes now
It'd literally just be another project
creations-chat 2023-04-28 23:40:36 how is guided "lock on" missile stuff not more used it's not that hard
hoverthrusters push away from people and builds
just translate the force of a hoverthruster into an inverse on your missile (this sounds harder then it is) and it'll fallow anything it gets close enough for the hover to interact with
creations-chat 2023-04-28 23:43:05 hoverthrusters
they exhert force from other builds
you just invert it for your control surfaces to your missile
creations-chat 2023-04-28 23:45:12 I'm not about to give out my personal guided missile designs but it's just motors and text idk why people act like it's a mystery
creations-chat 2023-04-28 23:49:55 Well this is what gets me
they don't exist on yt
the whole PCC seems to act like it's lost tech
but it feels kinda obvious. and its something that SHOULD be used more like my ships have CIWS that locks onto builds if they get close enough on their own and why does nobody else use them this way
creations-chat 2023-04-28 23:54:29 hoverthrusters
creations-chat 2023-04-29 00:17:11 <@963907500523003996> what are you using as shaders?
creations-chat 2023-04-29 02:16:39 Not my dumbass spending 20 minutes creating working "depth charge racks" only to realize I have too redo the whole thing because I can't lock the build with loose physics objects or they clip out
creations-chat 2023-04-29 02:20:32 ew-
creations-chat 2023-04-29 02:40:48 so uh- it turns out the interior layout of this ship was some rather poor planning on my part- if you happen to blow up one of these torpedoes they have a pretty good chance at destroying the core that holds the super structure to the hull, either 1 of 4 hull plates (depending on the torpedo hit) and without my superstructure the boat has no anti air- which was limited before but is severely limited now
and no forward gun

it can also take out the understructure for the other 4 torpedo launchers

hitting this boat with an explosive will fully disable it-
this isn't too bad- like It just means any type of air threat is massively dangerous but as a fleet guard vessel it's okay-
idk I'm pretty unhappy with it but I cannot do much to fix it without redoing half the boat again
creations-chat 2023-04-29 03:23:57 no.

creations-chat 2023-04-29 03:41:11 Yall need someone to pick on who's actually bothered by it fr
I'm a bad candidate 
I just argue or shitpost back in turn 

Also we stan the live performance radish spirit he is perfect
creations-chat 2023-04-29 04:12:10 -'Relic' class (actual ship class is a secret as of rn)
-Status incomplete 
-role ASW and limited surface engagement 
-weopons and deployables 
×1 single rocket turret mouse pointed
×1 5 gun CIWS guided by mouse and build track on
×4 "drooper" anti submarine mouse guided torpedoes 
×(undecided) depth charges launched from stern 

The "relic" class is (not its final name) is a ship still in development from an older time- when it was assumed that PC2 would be out soon, have a new map and larger servers and that on this new map ships would be used pretty frequently due to lag reduction.
It was assumed by the alliance I was in that fleets of pvp ships would be possible
And as we saw it there were 2 threats to any grouping of ships 
Air and submarine 
This is one of 3 vehicles I was asked to make to deter submarines
The other one (being a bouy tender capable of deploying torpedo nets I haven't shown off yet but do work) was the shield of this would be fleet and this was the sword
creations-chat 2023-04-29 04:14:12 Tldr this ship I'm about to finish is going to A
not be useful against anything above the water including aircraft and thus be absolutely unplayable alone
And B
Not make sense in plane crazy anymore
But I still want my functional ASW boat dammit
creations-chat 2023-04-29 04:31:03 "What if we did missiles but.. wrong"
creations-chat 2023-04-29 04:33:09 Nah but this is an awesome concept if I made airships old enough I would so use these
creations-chat 2023-04-29 13:56:22 And that's valid until people just... never left them
Again this isn't as bad anyone but it used to be

-I-400
-Sarancha class hydrofoil

-G-38

All unfinished but builds I wish I could eventually finish
Like the I-400 I had planned is cool
It had working aircraft to go bomb stuff controlled with my mouse 
But like I will never have the inspiration to finish it
Also PCC loved shitting on it as if  a half finished ship as if it's all my ships sm that I literally have no aspiration to work on it
creations-chat 2023-04-30 04:33:52 Most of these are broken when I spawn them now tho

creations-chat 2023-04-30 22:15:01 oh shit they broke hovers
I was working on a K class blimp and the plan was to have it's gun both lock onto builds and also automatically steer the blimp to them by doing this (which I could disengage to take manual control of both parts ofc)

but they broke my method of making hover thrusters lock onto ppls builds
creations-chat 2023-05-01 04:21:10

creations-chat 2023-05-01 07:08:40 The most interesting period of airship history when they were used stupid effectively to just ass German u boats 
And like are still being considered for submarine hunting today because they were just that good at it
creations-chat 2023-05-01 08:08:42 I'm going to keybind them to turn on when acending (as according to the old manuals I've been reading through to work on it they would be pumping air out of the envelope to go up, and pumping in air to go down
Air being heavier then helium which the rest of the envelope is full of)
creations-chat 2023-05-01 08:13:49 It's actually pretty cool I have a pretty good understanding of how this type of blimp works now
And I'm hoping to make mine control and feel similarly 
It's weopons are already pretty spot on are It's engines
And the door up where because the whole thing sits diagonally on its landing  gear you can just climb into the back of the ship

creations-chat 2023-05-02 03:58:12 I have been, and you're right but you are also continuing an argument in this chat for no other reason then you like to argue and insult ppl

creations-chat 2023-05-02 04:03:15 you just conceided  you're just here to argue and insult- which is my problem with you :/

creations-chat 2023-05-02 17:29:47 Makes it useless even as a tampon

I like aiming for just above ro-scale to make it feel good to walk around
I do ships tho I think roscale tanks are pretty cool
Helis too
Jets are whatever
creations-chat 2023-05-02 17:57:13 India has nothing on kowloon
creations-chat 2023-05-02 18:03:39 
creations-chat 2023-05-02 18:05:44 Oh no
Soviet architecture was good, pre planned and cranked out of an assembly line to recover from the war


This city grew organically in an international legal no man's land
These were informal tenements or "slums" stacked onto each other 

Did you guys really not no about this? It was the densest city in history
creations-chat 2023-05-02 18:11:24 Oh yeah it was great
You gotta consider that what came before soviet apartment blocks was a patchwork of feudalism
Where you could have a city house with running water and electricity 
And then drive 10 minutes out to the countryside and get houses with 3 families living in one room and no glass windows

And then this situation was made worse by WW2
Which raised housing across Europe 

The ability to factory build apartments that were very much so better then the single room shacks people were living in (if that) from before was a good move in affordable housing
The soviet union was bad but like  infrastructure was good
They're only seen as bad now because the context of what came before them isn't shown


Also all of them were built in like 3 years which is very very impressive
creations-chat 2023-05-02 18:13:30 Oh yeah Kowloon was real it was insane
It probably shouldn't have been raised but yk British gotta British 
Like they just deleted a city that had been built up from nothing with no government or nothing
Good going
creations-chat 2023-05-02 18:25:05 Don't compare it to other stuff just go look into it it's more insane then any of that it's a genuinely impressive city we just deleted
creations-chat 2023-05-02 18:32:03 Well the "commie block" has been replicated in most places
Like the US and UK have them
And they probably should it's such an efficient way to build affordable housing
creations-chat 2023-05-02 18:35:14 As per usual france and Germany did it the best by bringing in mixed zoning to the whole concept which makes it much better
creations-chat 2023-05-02 18:38:29 Well no- they're full houses 
Better then what people lived in before the war 
Like beyond better 
Even if they were boxes that's not the worst in terms of affordable housing
Kowloon was just boxes stacked on boxes and it was a very functional city 
It was completely organic and impoverished by the nature of its existence 
But it's housing worked 
Ex residents remember the city fondly and miss it
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:07:36 It was destroyed in the 90s most people alive rn were alive when it was destroyed
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:12:29 It- wasn't tho
Drugs and unlicensed doctors aren't necessarily bad
The doctors existed there because there was a market of poor people who were desperate for Healthcare 
Thats a net good
And Drug money funded so much of that city like it ended up ran by the triads
They set up pension funds and nursing homes and schools
Basically took over as a kind of police
So like yes it was worse then living in your comfy American suburban house
But like these were poor people (a lot of refugees from china and the UK both) and they literally built a city to live in because now where else was affordable 
It's impressive
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:15:04 That's because there have been 3 cod maps set there :/

Yall are so privileged oml homeless settlements aren't going to be pretty to you it's poverty fucking duh

What's impressive is how well it functiobed as a city with no oversight or regulations 
It was just a massive community and it probably would have kept along fine
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:17:24 It was made by an actual postal worker in the city
That's right the city had postal workers someone organized at some point
And God help them
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:20:00 Anyone who sees this as anything other then an impressive demonstration of human enguinity and tenacity.
Is horribly privileged and has never been starving before fr fr
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:24:01 Man this logic would make everything bad
Cars are bad under this logic
Breathing is bad

What you're going to breath? You'll just stub your toe in 10 minutes you fucking idiot why breath when it'll just allow for more problems 

Bro is stupid fr
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:27:12 You just gonna ignore the part where I explained why you're stupid
Resorting to insults implies I used them with no bases
But I made it pretty clear how you're argument makes no sense 

That's not my logic I'm breaking down why it's dumb when you do it 
This is unde levels of arguing
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:29:43 Nah love ad hominem means using insults in place of an argument to devalue previous arguments
You made a bad previous argument
I responded to it with an argument and then insulted you for how bad your argument is

There's a difference between the two.

You wanna pull out any other debate terms you don't know shit about?
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:31:49 Lol okay I'm done talking to 12yos I got work bye CChat
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:37:26 Isn't that from the one guy who they tracked down by finding the grain of granite in his countertop tracing it back to a quarry and then seeing where it was shipped too
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:40:06 Wait I need to read up on it I don't think I got that right
creations-chat 2023-05-02 19:43:33 NO LOL I WAS RIGHT
Bro leaked them to impress his nasee discord server 
And the government found him by tracking down the granite countertop he took the pictures on
creations-chat 2023-05-02 20:00:46 Nah it was the granite counter top 
The US state department is just that wild
creations-chat 2023-05-02 20:09:58 that's kinda nice ngl I like the detail on the interior bits
creations-chat 2023-05-02 20:12:11 May I recommend some texturing on the exterior of the gondola? maybe some disconnectors or ladders just to break up all the smooth surfaces
creations-chat 2023-05-02 20:14:27 something like this where the boxyness is more connected to the envelope to kinda explain it's shape
creations-chat 2023-05-02 20:30:41 
creations-chat 2023-05-02 21:13:41 No ik I'm saying the framing on the outside of the boxy bits

creations-chat 2023-05-03 06:23:53 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoia-Marchetti_S.55Ik this is gonna seem weird- but I looking for a build and found this message- and as Italian ww1-2 aircraft are my favorite I figured I should inform you this was a real plane actually and it's very pretty
creations-chat 2023-05-03 06:25:59 YES best plane- best plane ever omg 
never has a plane existed that at all compares
creations-chat 2023-05-03 06:48:55 I wish I was confident enough at how to set up cam lock builds to try and start a G-38
it really is the coolest airplane
creations-chat 2023-05-03 06:51:19 like ik how it works- and I use it on builds but idk how to structure builds with it yk- like I don't know how to make a big shape with it just add shapes 
It's still new to me tho so hopefully that changes 
Im in a pit rn because Idk how to do rounded off shapes with angle lock
and Im making a blimp where that's kinda important
creations-chat 2023-05-03 16:37:22 Do the missiles work?

It's taking me a while but I'm working on a Ca-3 (it was my first ever plane crazy plane so it seems fitting)
creations-chat 2023-05-03 18:04:25 You can use hallow cillenders as planetary rings properly to make old ww1 style machine gun mounting on aircraft
Which is so cool 
Like actually being able to sit in the center of your machine gun mount and have it rotate around you is cool
creations-chat 2023-05-03 19:08:45 Fucking weirdo any anylizing my pfp
Bro is parisocial yk I don't think about you as much as you do me right
Fr get a better hobby then trying to harrass me for attention
creations-chat 2023-05-04 18:46:09 Yall I might quit plane crazy flightpoint Is that much funner
creations-chat 2023-05-04 18:48:12 You gotta kinda cheese it
But you can make shit invisible 
Also I'm doing big Caproni biplanes because I like them
So they're more stable by default
creations-chat 2023-05-04 18:52:53 Like It's not as intuitive as plane crazy
But plane crazy flying is also ass we're just used to that too 
There are some major issues like that I can seem to get torpedoes or missiles not to freeze after launch
creations-chat 2023-05-04 18:55:08 Its- just modeling
I'm a professional artist working in triangles is so much more intuitive then blocks
That's literally how all 3D models work
Meaning BTW you can kinda copy over wire frames of models directly
creations-chat 2023-05-04 18:57:18 Not even a good flightpoint build ew th is that
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:02:51 There was a mirror- it was a just broken
It should come back also you don't even need to use triangles (at least for biplanes) I've used more wedges and beams then anything else on mine
And while it's not done yet it looks really good af and is way funner to figure out and work on then plane crazy
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:05:03 I think what I like so much is that I can know when my shit breaks
It won't be broken forever
Like my ships aren't going to stop working and never get fixed because of a lazy dev 

That said there is no ballast tank yet- and while I got a small test sub to work it was less then ideal
Not to mention custom missiles/torpedoes do nawt work yet
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:07:08 I did too 
I'm on like my forth try at it
Definitely took some getting used too
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:09:28 
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:12:03 Get in an argument in gen chat 
You'll have it in no time
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:14:09 We all just saw morfix do one and the quality drop is- telling
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:17:02 Tru you not gonna get anything positive from this chat specifically 
It will nawt happen
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:19:53 Honey it do be facts

We don't do positive feedback here
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:22:34 Okay but like
They rite tho
Thus chat will just harass new ppl with the stated intention of getting them go leave the community 
There is never any betterment of anyone just harassment 

Like maybe staff should uh
Do something to stop that pattern of behavior idk
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:24:53 
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:27:09 Oh no I agree
But it is taken too far like the goal is often stated to make people leave and that's kinda elitist and gross
Yall we spend our time wasting our life with roblox we not about to have any ground to stand on when it comes to trying to kick people out
Like this trashhole does not need to be gatekept but ppl act like they are the arbiters of build quality
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:29:29 Nah love you can't use the gif if the joke A wasn't written as a pre established joke and B wasn't funny
These are the rules I don't make them
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:31:38 Samee
I have a quirky ass building style and people frequently get on it for having exposed lock I clearly didn't care to or even Try hiding 
Like I'm not going to care
(That or they attack me for that other thing)
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:52:51 It's mostly the other thing
But I don't actually repost
Like ik people say I do
The problem is its always something on a build being shown off that I haven't shown off before
It's pretty much just the other thing
The reposting only comes up because they don't like how often they have to see it and would prefer never too

general 2023-05-10 00:57:57 I just gotta do restoration on the paint and order new decals
But otherwise look at this pretty bike I'm restoring
general 2023-05-10 00:59:41 It was much worse originally
general 2023-05-10 01:02:40 I cleaned up the handlebars replaced the tires cleaned the wheels cleaned the sprockets and chain cleaned the peddles and drive cleaned all the screws and bolts and whatnot cleaned the Seat off and got new springs for it replaced several loose spokes and added a new front reflector from another project
general 2023-05-10 01:03:34 I also fixed its coasting breaks which was annoying af
general 2023-05-10 01:03:56 What do you think restoring is
general 2023-05-10 01:04:30 By clean I mean remove rust and add new paint when nessicary 
Literally restoring damage
general 2023-05-10 01:06:50 I am not going to engage with this  lol
general 2023-05-10 01:11:18 Yes
Cleaning parts to restore the bike   this isn't hard
general 2023-05-10 13:49:56 
general 2023-05-10 13:49:58 This mf
general 2023-05-10 13:57:04 My pc is in storage still
general 2023-05-10 13:57:12 Very cringe
general 2023-05-10 15:04:15 I'm like 
Pretty sure politics aren't allowed
general 2023-05-10 15:04:26 Yall should chill with that
general 2023-05-10 15:04:40 Sure
general 2023-05-10 15:05:20 True
I'd love to argue with this doofus but politics be banned
general 2023-05-10 15:06:14 Eq why does it look like that
general 2023-05-10 15:06:38 Curry is good
general 2023-05-10 15:07:07 I Hate the turret to body ratio on all of these
general 2023-05-10 15:08:20 
general 2023-05-10 15:10:24 I just like posting the meme because funny
general 2023-05-10 15:13:27 All of these vehicles could be replaced by one Toyota
general 2023-05-10 15:14:33 
general 2023-05-10 15:15:01 It fast
general 2023-05-10 15:15:06 Problem solved
general 2023-05-10 15:15:15 Nobody expects the technicals
general 2023-05-10 15:15:47 Okay but yk what's way cheaper
general 2023-05-10 15:15:58 Toyota
general 2023-05-10 15:16:14 Me
general 2023-05-10 15:16:21 I was hungry~
general 2023-05-10 15:16:56 
general 2023-05-10 15:17:29 🔥 🔥 🔥
general 2023-05-10 15:18:32 Nah unlike morfix I'm not self hating and bigoted
I embrace the queer energy
general 2023-05-10 15:19:43 True
general 2023-05-10 15:20:43 Me when there aren't boys to kiss on
general 2023-05-10 15:21:32 I'm biologically intersex 
It's both
So I count
general 2023-05-10 15:21:39 We have 1
general 2023-05-10 15:22:11 That ia not half its full of both
general 2023-05-10 15:23:32 Don't do this I have them blocked for a reason lol
general 2023-05-10 15:24:00 The answer is its complicated but I have parts of both
general 2023-05-10 15:25:29 Nah most intersex people just don't know
And if they do know at birth (and have noticeable differences) they will be given surgery as babies to try and make them one or the other
general 2023-05-10 15:27:51 I had some surgeries but it didn't fix my endocreinal system
And because of anti trans legislation it's really hard to get hormones I'd need to do so because it's not covered by insurance
Which is so fun
I'm so close to being feminine presenting 
Assuming I shave my body all the time and you ignore my lack of chest because my body still makes testosterone
general 2023-05-10 15:28:59 I mean I am but like
I'm intersex
Born this way

I just get fucked over by transphobia too
general 2023-05-10 15:29:41 My body tries to make both
But testosterone is a way more powerful hormone
general 2023-05-10 15:30:06 You're all only male
(And your body only has male characteristics) because of washes of testosterone in the womb
general 2023-05-10 15:33:18 God I hate that bot
general 2023-05-10 15:34:07 Okay no I don't have "breast"
Testosterone suppresses the development of them 
And I do have one remaining internal ball which is what's making the testosterone 
And they never removed for some reason
general 2023-05-10 15:34:58 Yeah well I'm a minor
And some mfs decided its really hard to get surgery to do so as a minor because they hate trans people
general 2023-05-10 15:36:00 One did
And was removed 

Also my parts were sealed over which had to be fixed 
I look pretty normal for a girl down there now but some stuff is bigger because testosterone 
Like what happens to pre surgery trans guys
general 2023-05-10 15:36:51 No I do they're just suppressed because T is a stronger hormone
general 2023-05-10 15:37:52 Honey
Shut up
Literally this isn't about my decision I would be more healthy with the surgery 
Like I have health issues because I can't get the surgery to remove it now
general 2023-05-10 15:38:27 I shouldn't have testosterone
general 2023-05-10 15:39:14 Because I'm way more female presenting and my body is way closer to female
I'd like it if it made estrogen as it would otherwise
general 2023-05-10 15:39:37 Triggered fr
general 2023-05-10 15:40:06 I'm intersex 
I'm actually infertal UNLESS I get rid of it
general 2023-05-10 15:40:46 Not true
I had both
general 2023-05-10 15:40:57 Also not true
general 2023-05-10 15:41:53 Okay see you're being goofy
I have all the parts to produce eggs and get pregnant
I just can't because my body is making testosterone which suppresses them from working
general 2023-05-10 15:42:18 I already did
general 2023-05-10 15:42:21 Several times
general 2023-05-10 15:42:26 Bro is killing me
general 2023-05-10 15:42:53 I had parts of both
This is after surgery
general 2023-05-10 15:43:04 It's complicated every intersex person is different
general 2023-05-10 15:44:37 Actually they do
And I did
It's kinda complicated and I cannot possibly explain the development in pcc but it's true
general 2023-05-10 15:45:54 So like
You don't know what you're talking about
Stop asserting stuff
No if you have both hormones testosterone just suppresses estrogen 
Its a stronger hormone
general 2023-05-10 15:46:35 No
It wasn't perfect hence the surgeries I got
general 2023-05-10 15:47:07 Nah intersex people are stupid common
general 2023-05-10 15:47:43 Again most people don't know
But we're more common then red headed people
general 2023-05-10 15:49:23 Well no
First that's the wrong term
Second intersex people are often infertal 
And because it can be fixed endocrinenally it's just mis diagnosed
Most people who are intersex do not know
general 2023-05-10 15:49:51 Well no it was because my parents wanted a girl
general 2023-05-10 15:49:55 Jokes on them lol
general 2023-05-10 15:50:30 That's what's generally done to intersex people 
They are given surgery to make them one or the other
general 2023-05-10 15:50:40 And that's what happened
general 2023-05-10 15:51:36 Idk what this means
I'm also trans and will admit it happily but that's different then intersex 
That's a social thing
I'm talking biologically
general 2023-05-10 15:52:42 Well idk I just think 3 was too young to decide for me
I wish I got more input on that tbh
general 2023-05-10 15:53:05 Triggered
general 2023-05-10 15:53:15 Lol just leave the chat then
general 2023-05-10 15:53:22 You're the only one complaining
general 2023-05-10 15:54:05 Nothing suggestive was said I'm talking about medical stuff
general 2023-05-10 15:55:10 I'm intersex and it was a conversation about people trying to explain to me how that's not possible
And me explaining that it is

Tldr
general 2023-05-10 15:56:19 They're not lol that's the point
general 2023-05-10 15:56:34 Like they both could
One or the other
But testosterone means they don't
general 2023-05-10 15:56:56 I explained it from the start what
general 2023-05-10 15:57:33 It produces perfectly fertal stuff 
But has nowhere to put it
It's just pooling in there lol
general 2023-05-10 15:57:35 Partying
general 2023-05-10 15:57:42 Vibing if you will
general 2023-05-10 15:58:29 It's illegal in my state until 24
general 2023-05-10 15:58:49 If I get cancer from it before that owell
general 2023-05-10 15:59:04 Yeah this isn't how medical stuff works
general 2023-05-10 15:59:12 I'm 17
general 2023-05-10 15:59:46 Well that'd also be illegal
general 2023-05-10 16:00:11 That's still done
And is also way more complicated then it sounds
general 2023-05-10 16:02:33 It's okay I got this
general 2023-05-10 16:04:07 There have been complications
general 2023-05-10 16:04:41 L
general 2023-05-10 16:05:15 Bro needs a job
general 2023-05-10 16:05:17 Fr
general 2023-05-10 16:05:32 Not u
general 2023-05-10 16:05:42 I thought my bikes were goofy
general 2023-05-10 16:06:27 I love bikes so much guys they are so yummy
general 2023-05-10 16:06:38 My dream car is actually a bakfeits
general 2023-05-10 16:08:29 Babboe my beloved
general 2023-05-10 16:10:14 Counterpoint
general 2023-05-10 16:11:02 I want to build a tall bike too
general 2023-05-10 16:12:28 Tall bikes make me silly happy
general 2023-05-10 16:13:49 The yellow one is actually an old Lamplighter 
So what you'd do is lean it against a lamp
Climb in like a ladder
Light the lamp
Then push off and peddle to the next lamp to light that one and repeat
general 2023-05-10 16:15:48 They get taller now tho
It's a silly hobby thing


I want to build one
general 2023-05-10 16:17:31 So there are 2 ways
For smaller upside down bikes like the white one you can start pushing it running along side it and climb up it while it's moving (with some good balance)
For the really tall ones you lean it against smth tall like a lampost and push off
general 2023-05-10 16:19:29 Here's the tallest bike in the world currently
general 2023-05-10 16:20:26 It's called stoopidtall
general 2023-05-10 16:22:19 I want this so baddd
general 2023-05-10 17:24:36 Just got back from work
general 2023-05-10 17:24:56 And traffic was so bad I have never spent 20 minutes at a crosswalk before
general 2023-05-10 17:25:44 And my ass hurts because I had my bike seat crooked
general 2023-05-10 17:26:13 Truly
general 2023-05-10 17:26:27 Whatever I'm used to it
general 2023-05-10 17:26:34 <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2023-05-10 17:27:18 My ass? Trust me I already do
general 2023-05-10 17:27:32 I did
general 2023-05-10 17:27:45 First thing when I got home
general 2023-05-10 17:28:44 I bike 16 miles every day
8 to work and 8 back
Plus any other trips I make

I don't own a car just a lot of bikes I like very much
general 2023-05-10 17:28:53 I think ik how to use them
general 2023-05-10 17:29:15 TRUE
general 2023-05-10 17:29:53 Every day lol
general 2023-05-10 17:30:00 I have thunder calves
general 2023-05-10 17:30:35 I saw a massive fish in the drain the other day after it rained really hard
Bro was near 5ft
general 2023-05-10 17:31:14 I don't race or anything I like bikes as an alternative to commuting by car
general 2023-05-10 17:31:42 And as goofy creative projects
general 2023-05-10 17:31:56 Yeah it's two completely different things
general 2023-05-10 17:32:17 Suburbia moment
general 2023-05-10 17:32:34 My nearest creek is actually a freeway drain
general 2023-05-10 17:32:37 It has fish tho
general 2023-05-10 17:36:26 Two of my bikes (the blue one is from the 80s) and the black one is what I used to go to pride last year
Hence all the gay and also all the carrying capacity
general 2023-05-10 17:37:09 Indeed
general 2023-05-10 17:38:11 I actually scrapped the gay bike because I wanted to use its parts to make a shopping cart trailer
general 2023-05-10 17:38:19 
general 2023-05-10 17:39:28 It's not in the picture but I wrapped paper ribbon through the spokes to make them rainbow too
general 2023-05-10 17:39:36 Very gay
general 2023-05-10 17:39:48 True
general 2023-05-10 17:42:04 My current bike is built out of like 4 other bikes found in garbage and whatnot and I love it very much
It's frame is from a 80s bike I found it's a great bike
general 2023-05-10 17:43:32 Just be fem instead
general 2023-05-10 17:43:36 Drop the boy

general 2023-05-10 20:30:06 I can build a fully functional typhoon with 24 launch tubes to scale- only for the PVP group to reject it because they sunk it with a ship that drops 20 depth charges
general 2023-05-10 20:31:47 nah it works well in pvp- nobody knows what's goin on
general 2023-05-10 22:44:39 I wish I was the terpitz and could spend my entire life being pounded by british ppl until capsizing and killing 1000

The album has 8 released songs

general 2023-05-11 00:04:35 "Shoot torpedo or rocket fast enough too sink carrier quick before they find us"
general 2023-05-11 00:04:42 No u rite tho

That's all Russia has left
general 2023-05-11 00:10:27 They get one guy to take the knife
Dive down and poke holes in the hull of enemy ships with it

Perfect plan
general 2023-05-11 00:11:29 Ofc tho It's russia so by one man I mean 2000 and only 30 of them get the knives
general 2023-05-11 00:13:01 It's a good thing I can't read
general 2023-05-11 00:14:07 Hand sanitizer is also very yummy just sayin
general 2023-05-11 00:16:25 A girl i knew in the mental hospital fucking tried to drink the hand sanitizer to get drunk off it
And it was so funny because it didn't contain alcohol (duh) but made her sick for like 2 days
general 2023-05-11 00:16:59 They didn't have that left out
general 2023-05-11 00:17:11 I tried to jump in front of a train lol

general 2023-05-11 00:18:32 Oop- uh
general 2023-05-11 00:18:56 Okay so you're actually mentally ill
general 2023-05-11 00:20:10 Bro they have me on a mood stabilizer that has the side effect of making me have really bad dizzy spells
Like I'll fall over

And its really funny because the doctor baisically said "yeah you're skinny we don't know how to make it not do that"
general 2023-05-11 00:20:19 So it just does that
general 2023-05-11 00:21:15 Is he cute or naw

general 2023-05-11 00:27:41 I'm so confused
general 2023-05-11 00:30:25 covered in milk
general 2023-05-11 00:31:29 Remember missile swarms in pvp
general 2023-05-11 00:32:35 I miss them they were funny 
Because it always went the same

You'd start shooting out the seat of the guy with the missiles before they could take off 
Then they'd get mad
Build up some box around the seat
You'd still shoot through it and it'd continue until they rage quit

general 2023-05-11 00:47:17 Yep
general 2023-05-11 00:47:28 Yeah that seems like a bad filter
general 2023-05-11 00:48:01 Ban the slur not words containing it
Like 🦝 would be sensored too
general 2023-05-11 00:49:59 Why are racial slurs banned but ableist, transphobic ones (equally TOS violating) not
Like if you're gonna ban some for TOS do it all the way
general 2023-05-11 00:50:52 I get people warned for words like "yes" all the time

I have like 2 anthro characters I draw

Most of my characters are human and I mostly draw landscape stuff anyways
So idk if that counts

But I like using them as online avatars  and have done coma so maybe?

general 2023-05-15 02:50:11 Miner is cool
general 2023-05-15 02:50:48 Like a cool person I mean (obv his builds are nice)
general 2023-05-15 02:50:59 True
general 2023-05-15 02:51:24 I think it I saw a good to scale t-35 I'd do silly stuff
general 2023-05-15 02:53:19 Ehh
general 2023-05-15 02:53:32 Idk I think small boats go so hard
general 2023-05-15 02:54:10 Ight your hyping him upba bit to much
general 2023-05-15 02:54:43 He's legendary but like

All mini builds?
general 2023-05-15 02:54:53 Consider helicopters
general 2023-05-15 02:55:20 Oh you mean just grandiose
general 2023-05-15 02:55:30 Yeah no big builds are more impressive then
general 2023-05-15 02:56:15 I like functional builds personally 
A build where every missile drone 
and torpedo fires is way cooler to me
general 2023-05-15 02:56:41 Well yeah
general 2023-05-15 02:57:41 Nah my favorite mini builds are the ones that play off that tho
Like I saw a mini soviet fan driven sled
To scale
Had a detailed interior and they chose a varient with a simple cannon to do 
It looked very good
general 2023-05-15 02:58:02 Mini apcs with interiors are always cool too
general 2023-05-15 02:58:36 Nah how
general 2023-05-15 02:58:49 U did nawt
general 2023-05-15 02:59:10 Yeah I think that looks good af
general 2023-05-15 02:59:23 True
general 2023-05-15 02:59:50 Mini ships and planes are noob

Ground vehicles to scale can get pretty cool
general 2023-05-15 02:59:59 Also all airships are minis
general 2023-05-15 03:00:16 I hate bad mini builds
general 2023-05-15 03:00:25 High effort mini builds are great
general 2023-05-15 03:00:35 Spaceships are ez tho its so easy to do
general 2023-05-15 03:00:46 Just the bigger looking and more parts the better
general 2023-05-15 03:01:31 Well yeah but I draw professionally so that's easy for me
general 2023-05-15 03:01:47 Like coming up with good concepts is my bread and butter
general 2023-05-15 03:02:10 True
general 2023-05-15 03:02:38 I like flightpoint because I can do interiors so ez
Ship hulls too
I can have both
general 2023-05-15 03:03:08 I have never tried stormworks
general 2023-05-15 03:04:10 I want too try building vehicles in the create aeronautics mod for minecraft 
I think the potential for submarines and ships is pretty unmentioned in its discourse
general 2023-05-15 03:04:29 It's not out yet tho
general 2023-05-15 03:05:04 I like boat
But am poor
Gotta invest in the good games
general 2023-05-15 03:05:31 You could do ballistic subs that send missiles to cords it's pretty potent
general 2023-05-15 03:06:03 Well yeah
I personally would want to do an I-400
Because the mod makes planes a thing
general 2023-05-15 03:06:55 You can pick them up as minecart contraptions too
So you could store tenders or motor launches in a fucking chest or on deck or some shit
general 2023-05-15 03:07:16 It's wide tho you got lotsa space
general 2023-05-15 03:07:39 You could store the planes in chests
general 2023-05-15 03:07:48 Or an auto launch system realistically
general 2023-05-15 03:08:09 Ik that sounds weird but create is complicated
general 2023-05-15 03:08:23 Well no you'd do it to redeploy them
general 2023-05-15 03:09:17 I don't think contraptions can go in shulkers because you can place shulkers on them and thus infinite storage
general 2023-05-15 03:09:51 I don't know enough about create tbh I need to play it more
general 2023-05-15 03:10:29 Let's be real America had it in the 90s and we just dont know yet
general 2023-05-15 03:11:28 I choose to believe we print abrams from little cardboard 2D cutouts the same way a doom level generates from 2D
general 2023-05-15 03:11:38 On mass
general 2023-05-15 03:11:46 It's black magic
general 2023-05-15 03:12:43 The cardboard goes under these big rollers then a tank gets squeezed out the other side
general 2023-05-15 03:13:53 No I'm pretty sure we paperclipped all their shipbuilders meaning the stuff they bought was combined RND
general 2023-05-15 03:14:54 Like what was Japan gonna do but buy our stuff their shipbuilders were dead or papercliped
general 2023-05-15 03:15:32 TRU
general 2023-05-15 03:15:49 Well yeah thats way later tho
general 2023-05-15 03:15:54 I mean after the war
general 2023-05-15 03:17:38 Japan's carriers are so scuffed
And what's funny is they aren't the only one to do this
The US has like 17 not aircraft carrier aircraft carriers
There are a ton internationally 
If you count amphibious ships or helicopter destroyers or what have you that can all conveniently operate Nato jets

There are a lot more carriers in the world
general 2023-05-15 03:18:18 Ehhh
general 2023-05-15 03:18:24 Not anymore then aircraft carriers
general 2023-05-15 03:18:32 It's kinda dependant on their escort tbh
general 2023-05-15 03:19:06 This is why we have CSG and not single escort carriers anymore
general 2023-05-15 03:19:39 Yeah
The same threats posed to "helicopter carriers"
general 2023-05-15 03:19:56 They can both operate jets one just pretends it can't
general 2023-05-15 03:20:12 Like they're not all that different capabilities wise
general 2023-05-15 03:20:46 There is only one superpower capable of feilding supercarriers
general 2023-05-15 03:21:07 But most large navy have an aircraft carrier even if its a ship that pretends not to be a carrier rn
general 2023-05-15 03:22:12 Wtf is that one destroyer that has the capability to maintain a fleet of 6 helicopters by lowering them down under its helipad (making the helipad long enough to oh idk land something larger like a jet on)
general 2023-05-15 03:22:29 Like I'm sorry in terms of capabilities
That's a bad aircraft carrier
general 2023-05-15 03:22:54 The budget half assed option up there with those ugly soviet ones
general 2023-05-15 03:24:39 I wish soviet missile cruisers/destroyers weren't a pipe dream
They're so cool looking 
My favorite warships esthetically 
And then you look into the logistics around them and their historically poor capabilities to actually defend themselves and its like- "aw but you look so pretty I want you to work so bad"
general 2023-05-15 03:25:48 Oh yeah but the kirov isn't the same type of missile cruiser 
Its pretty inline with Western designs at the time just 

Way fucking big
general 2023-05-15 03:27:38 I'm talking about the goofy ships with missile silos tacked on the side and VLS rockets every 5 feet
Like what are you doing that thing is going to take one hit and everything inside is going to be damaged because there's nowhere you could hit it that can't damage something
The kirov has this same issue
On old battleships you'd call it a turret farm (where you have so many guns you can't hit it anywhere that isn't a magazine) sadly there isn't a term for the equivalent with modern-ish missile dependant ships
general 2023-05-15 03:28:45 Is that the one with the back deck or the side deck
general 2023-05-15 03:29:01 Yeah that's kinda goofy
general 2023-05-15 03:29:18 I think it has charm but like- ehh it was a ship built for the wrong Era
general 2023-05-15 03:29:27 That's all Russian ships tho
general 2023-05-15 03:29:55 True
I like weird looking ships tho my favorite ship is Kitakami
general 2023-05-15 03:30:04 Keiv is pretty
general 2023-05-15 03:30:21 I like the bits that stick out the hull for no reason
general 2023-05-15 03:31:14 No I think I disagree I like most others 
Especially when they look just like baby aircraft carriers 

What looks bad is when they look like cruisers or destroyers with a massive helideck tacked to the back
general 2023-05-15 03:31:58 Idk it kinda has its charm
It's like the ugly pickup truck of carriers
general 2023-05-15 03:32:13 The black mast kinda ruins it
general 2023-05-15 03:32:20 It's out of line
general 2023-05-15 03:33:34 I hate using carriers only to refer to aircraft carriers that is dumb and also not what the navy does 
Anything that can gain aircontrol over the water around it is a carrier to me it does the same thing just more localized
general 2023-05-15 03:33:55 I personally 
It reminds me of battleship designs in a kinda cool way
general 2023-05-15 03:34:15 Like it looks like interwar battleships
general 2023-05-15 03:34:48 Well no I do
I don't think what they started as matters as much as what they are used for at present
general 2023-05-15 03:35:44 Like in ww2 escort carriers were not considered true aircraft carriers

Escort carriers are just the same thing but operate more independently 

So I think it's a bit weird to keep such a strict definition when talking informally
general 2023-05-15 03:36:52 Well no I'm just suggesting that we call things that can launch aircraft as it's primary offense a carrier because it makes more sense

And different navies call their not carrier carriers different things
general 2023-05-15 03:37:03 Like you're familiar with Japan's helicopter destroyers
general 2023-05-15 03:37:26 But India has the same thing they're just amphibious warfare ships
general 2023-05-15 03:37:56 Most countries with navies have something similar it's just called something different because it's not supposed to be an aircraft carrier
general 2023-05-15 03:38:30 And the term helicopter carrier doesn't fit when like

Japan's can just service jets
It can
Like we know this they've done it
general 2023-05-15 03:38:47 They did
general 2023-05-15 03:39:03 Straight up
And it's small and baby and I love it
general 2023-05-15 03:40:06 They did

Guys aircraft carriers with the full hanger and nuclear plant only make sense if you're a global superpower who fights all your conflicts offensively and on the other side of the world 
Offensively they don't make sense
general 2023-05-15 03:40:31 You only need carriers like what the US have if you want to control the whole ocean
general 2023-05-15 03:40:54 But Japan doesn't
It doesn't need a full airwing or for its ship to have infinite fuel it's operating off the coast of Japan
general 2023-05-15 03:41:22 India and China don't really seek to either
general 2023-05-15 03:42:10 Russia didn't 
Russian carriers make a lot more sense when you realize they aren't offensive like the USs the doctrine was defensive
They're big souped up patrol vessels usually to hunt nuclear submarines
Which is why they use helicopters
general 2023-05-15 03:42:41 Yeah
But they're still carriers
general 2023-05-15 03:43:20 Nah Japan has a lot of remote islands

Importantly remote islands Russia likes to fuck with
general 2023-05-15 03:43:48 Well the soviet navy made sense when the soviet union existed

But the Russian navy is a joke
general 2023-05-15 03:44:32 Bro even their subs are jokes now
general 2023-05-15 03:44:40 Like didn't one just expload
general 2023-05-15 03:45:01 Like randomly it was just vibing and then went off because the 30yo torpedoes went off
general 2023-05-15 03:45:35 There is no way the typhoon works
general 2023-05-15 03:45:39 Just no way
general 2023-05-15 03:45:49 I don't have a source for that I just know it
general 2023-05-15 03:46:15 Ik it's everybody's favorite big bitch but it's also russian
general 2023-05-15 03:46:52 Well yeah 
A misconception with soviet subs is that they don't need to be quiet they do this thing with the ice
general 2023-05-15 03:47:20 Well it kinda doesn't 
It vibes under the ice and sits there
general 2023-05-15 03:47:29 Or at least that's what it's supposed to do
general 2023-05-15 03:47:52 (It doesn't because russian navy)
general 2023-05-15 03:48:15 Oh true
Consider all russian subs are ancient
general 2023-05-15 03:48:33 I'm saying the typhoon was good as built
general 2023-05-15 03:48:46 Russia has no working submarine threat
general 2023-05-15 03:48:52 I 100 percent belive this
general 2023-05-15 03:49:23 It's subs fucking blow up for no reason
general 2023-05-15 03:49:44 So is every other ballistic submarine
It was comparable
general 2023-05-15 03:50:05 That's not a problem
general 2023-05-15 03:50:11 Ice sitting
A thing which used to work
general 2023-05-15 03:50:17 It wouldn't be moving
general 2023-05-15 03:50:52 Okay again its really complicated but russian ballistic missile subs having no menuverability did make sense at one point
general 2023-05-15 03:51:25 Fuck wasn't it like the 70s-80s
I don't remember it's been a second since I have been autistic about submarines
general 2023-05-15 03:51:54 Yep
I didn't say it was amazing
But it makes sense for the time
general 2023-05-15 03:52:02 It's a likeable sub
general 2023-05-15 03:52:08 Yeah
general 2023-05-15 03:52:14 So did most US subs
general 2023-05-15 03:52:33 And then the soviet union collapsed so there is no sub theat to us
general 2023-05-15 03:52:51 No you're right they still try to ice sit
general 2023-05-15 03:52:58 In 2023
general 2023-05-15 03:53:05 Bro we can see you we have satellites
general 2023-05-15 03:53:21 Go back to Port and think about what you did bad submarine
general 2023-05-15 03:53:29 Anyways
general 2023-05-15 03:55:02 Missile cruisers 
They goofy
I already said why they goofy (even the beloved battlecruiser)
But they do make more sense when you realize how defensive the soviet navy is
Like it's not offensive like the US

Ofc Russia now uses it entirely offensively and has ever since its never actually been used as designed
general 2023-05-15 03:55:40 Oh ik
Because russian submarines are all like ancient now and rely on strategies for staying stealthy that DO NAWT WORK in current year
general 2023-05-15 03:59:06 Thr kirov is so bad
Like yk how when you look at a US cruiser it's not entirely missile 

That's for a reason 
We learned the lesson in the 1930s you cannot cover your ship entirely in weopon systems because weopon systems require a lot of space for their ammo and that ammo often explodes when hit
If you make a ship covered entirely in missile launches like kirov it has to also be entirely composed of the magazines for them meaning there is nowhere you can hit that won't destroy something very important or cause something big to explode
general 2023-05-15 04:00:20 It's why we took the torpedoes off the decks of our destroyers
general 2023-05-15 04:01:07 Yeah but russian missiles have always been the chokeline for their ships
And couldn't effectively do this
Also you can only pull this shit so many times before someone gets wise to what your doing
general 2023-05-15 04:01:21 And you're out the massive battlecruiser
general 2023-05-15 04:01:37 Famously reliable soviet CIWS
general 2023-05-15 04:01:47 It is
general 2023-05-15 04:02:29 It wasn't meant to operate as a fleet ship because other ships would slow it down

I mean it did because obviously 
But that kinda limited its capabilities
general 2023-05-15 04:05:44 Like it's objectively cool as fuck
But I think it's cool like Yamato is cool

Was it dumb and impractical? Did it's massive fucking guns cause the bridge crew to black out and AA gunners nearby to suffer internal damage? Did it's rangefinders not meet the max range of the guns requiring them to be put on a massive superstructure you could see from Miles away except even that didn't work so they used floatplanes to do range finding except you can't store floatplanes on deck because the massive overpressure from the third turret so you put them in a hanger below deck making the process to launch them take 30 minutes-
Yes
Yes to all of it


But big boat big and cool
general 2023-05-15 04:06:31 Russian navy consists of one guy swimming around with a knife
general 2023-05-15 04:06:45 Cutting the bottom of Ukrainian fishing boats
general 2023-05-15 04:08:03 The Baltic fleet is a spook fr
general 2023-05-15 04:09:54 Me with my ASW boat looking for any sign of good submarine players then realizing I'm the only one left
general 2023-05-15 04:10:17 Also it's cus if you have a bad ping the water kills your fps now
general 2023-05-15 04:10:27 And like I've caused from having big builds in the water
general 2023-05-15 04:10:35 Plane crazy is broken
general 2023-05-15 04:10:55 Well I do
I'm talking about why pvp in the water is dead
general 2023-05-15 04:11:04 Because it always started with someone spawning a big ship
general 2023-05-15 04:11:11 And now big ships don't work
general 2023-05-15 04:11:28 I hope to God flightpoint gets more fleshed out water pvp
general 2023-05-15 04:11:37 And water stuff in general
general 2023-05-15 04:12:15 It takes some getting used too but like
You can do crazy stuff with ships and the detail and interior and whatnot
general 2023-05-15 04:12:40 I'm making a to scale Schnellboot with full interior and working (barely) torps rn
general 2023-05-15 04:13:15 If you want to do ship pvp in plane crazy
I like missiles
Because turn you can target land targets too and force them to come stop you
general 2023-05-15 04:13:24 Kinda but it's limited rn
general 2023-05-15 04:13:31 There's no cannon block rn
general 2023-05-15 04:14:06 I have such a good suggestion for a cannon block but I am banned from the server and it sucks
general 2023-05-15 04:16:33 Basically make a cannon block
Make it rescalable so it can be used on anything from tankettes to battleships

Then you add a shell block which you can limit the amount alloted of a given diameter 
The cannon fires any shell of the same diameter present on your build
After which it's used up and the shell disappears from the build 

Meaning you'd have to do magazines for your cannons and can have different diameters of different guns 
For things like ww1 ships
general 2023-05-15 04:18:15 I meant diameters u rite
general 2023-05-15 04:18:36 Big L
general 2023-05-15 04:19:04 Absolutely
general 2023-05-15 04:19:22 I'm building a to scale LST with full interior but rn the game's block limit is hindering it
general 2023-05-15 04:20:08 I am also doing a schnellboot and I might take on a Pegasus or sparviero or that one soviet hydrofoil 
I wanna do something complicated like that
general 2023-05-15 04:20:55 Also I need to do a laker
It's not possible to do one with the full interior but also to scale in plane crazy because the front compartments get tight
general 2023-05-15 04:21:36 I'm from Michigan it's required I do a laker
general 2023-05-15 04:23:29 do small boats- I have a cute to scale motor launch
general 2023-05-15 04:27:40 you should do a blimp then
general 2023-05-16 20:40:57 Caproni planes try not to be otherworldly challenge (impossible)
general 2023-05-16 20:48:12 Oh no true
The big biplane there was made in the 1930s and was rejected by the Italian airforce as they didn't want a heavy bomber that looked out of date.

Which was a mistake because apparently it handled as well as a small ww1 fighter plane
Being able to make turns on a dime and with all of its machine guns and high bomb capacity it would have been incredibly useful as a close air bomber for Italian campaigns in North Africa
general 2023-05-16 20:48:22 Ofc that didn't happen
general 2023-05-16 20:49:02 The flying barrel as you might know paved the way for ducted engines and later jet engines
general 2023-05-16 20:49:39 A modified version of this plane was the first to fly from Italy to the US without landing
general 2023-05-16 20:51:37 And the ca 3 4 5-93 were all somehow relevant bombers from ww1 into the 30s
general 2023-05-16 20:51:47 Despite being the same fucking plane
general 2023-05-16 20:52:50 I just had to redo half my schnellboots frame because it was off in the back
general 2023-05-16 20:53:36 My personal most sought after block would be an air block that cancels the effect of being underwater so you can do boats and subs with interior
general 2023-05-16 20:54:00 Ehh
general 2023-05-16 20:54:04 Nah use rulers
general 2023-05-16 20:54:08 It's not that hard
general 2023-05-16 20:54:28 Rulers
general 2023-05-16 20:54:37 Rulers
general 2023-05-16 20:54:53 Based
general 2023-05-16 20:55:09 It has ballast tank and pontoon so u rite
general 2023-05-16 20:55:44 <@900865317373374555> hey whats up with the torpedo limitation
Like launched decoupled blocks will only go so far before freezing
general 2023-05-16 20:56:17 No cus it starts again if you get closer
general 2023-05-16 20:56:25 It's like it's physics is tied to the player
general 2023-05-16 20:57:11 I make missile cruisers and smart weopons in plane crazy as my main thing
Its a completely halting bug for that
general 2023-05-18 23:08:46 flightpoint interior is insane
general 2023-05-18 23:12:55 Because the shower is really small 
And sinks on old boats are kinda big and shallow so you could wash off tools and whatnot in the basin
general 2023-05-18 23:13:57 It's not look in the bottom of the fourth picture
general 2023-05-18 23:14:59 Well no lol 
Think industrial sinks
general 2023-05-18 23:15:40 I do nawt touch that discord
general 2023-05-18 23:17:42 Me when I have to tell my commanding officer the boat rocked and I  dropped the last socket wrench overboard
general 2023-05-18 23:18:17 This too
general 2023-05-18 23:18:47 All the pipework and cables in those screenshots run to the blueprint accurate tanks and trunks
general 2023-05-18 23:19:14 It's all blueprint accurate
general 2023-05-18 23:20:07 The massive sink is in the blueprints
general 2023-05-18 23:20:23 Bro the CO cabin has a big one too
general 2023-05-18 23:22:47 The radio room is my favorite
Because it's exactly how a real German ww2 radio room would work
So all the parts are there
Including an old fire extinguisher under the desk and enigma machine with code books
general 2023-05-18 23:24:14 The potted plant is a signalis reference
general 2023-05-18 23:25:45 Because it upsets you every time and you message me about it
general 2023-05-18 23:26:21 That is an enigma machine
And that's as small as I could get and as close as I could get the keys with the clipping limit
general 2023-05-18 23:27:05 You act upset every time
general 2023-05-18 23:30:06 I build my interiored builds from the inside out
So I don't even have the exterior of a S-100 to show its all frame and the interior walls
general 2023-05-18 23:31:43 
general 2023-05-18 23:38:22 Also rq
Last thing
Everything on the interior is *slightly larger*
This is graphical upscaling
Its done in all video games because things in games look smaller to you at scale
So you need to make them bigger
Look up halo gun size comparisons for a really good example
So when you do vehicles (and especially interiors) you shouldn't actually go for to scale because it'll look bad in first person
You should aim just slightly bigger then to scale
general 2023-05-18 23:40:01 I see
And do you eat the salt from salt shakers a lot morfix?
general 2023-05-18 23:40:30 Idk he seems very well informed on it
general 2023-05-18 23:41:16 No I got the joke I'm saying you do it a lot don't ya
general 2023-05-18 23:42:29 Filter bypass hours
general 2023-05-18 23:43:58 
general 2023-05-18 23:46:21 Man you really like thinking about my reproductive organs and bringing them up
I'm not into you dude stop being creepy
general 2023-05-18 23:47:22 Ik it's pretty weird
general 2023-05-18 23:47:37 He keeps bringing it up
Bro thinks about my balls more then me
general 2023-05-18 23:48:09 Because morfix brought it up
general 2023-05-18 23:49:04 Lol
general 2023-05-18 23:49:59 You fak
general 2023-05-18 23:51:20 Bro you brought it up and kept bringing it up
Twice ignored
I just called you out the last time
general 2023-05-18 23:52:08 Then so were you? 3 times
general 2023-05-18 23:52:42 Nah bro is making excuses 
You bring it up every time I say anything here
general 2023-05-18 23:52:52 IN REFERENCE TO HIM LOL
general 2023-05-18 23:52:57 He bypassed the filter
general 2023-05-18 23:53:15 Before it
general 2023-05-18 23:53:51 Bruh I literally did not do anything but call out you breaking rules and you have spun it back onto me
general 2023-05-18 23:54:07 Stop bro
general 2023-05-18 23:56:51 Bruh he went back and edited the other 2 messages where he was trying to bait me by talking about it
general 2023-05-18 23:57:06 Bro is goofy
general 2023-05-18 23:57:30 I haven't broken any rules
You however do a very good job at breaking them constantly to harass me and then covering it up
general 2023-05-18 23:59:11 No see he's doing it rn
Except now he's using innuendo with the whole freinds fridge thing
general 2023-05-19 00:00:03 Morfix bro IT WAS CALLING YOU OUT
general 2023-05-19 00:00:10 Bro is trying to get me banned
general 2023-05-19 00:00:17 By removing the context
general 2023-05-19 00:00:36 He broke the rules
Tried to bait me 3 times

And then I called him out and he's trying to get me warned for it
general 2023-05-19 00:00:57 He also went back and edited the other 2 times when I called them out for it
general 2023-05-19 00:01:19 The suggestive rule
Which he is trying to get me warned for

Nothing I'm saying is anymore suggestive then what he said
general 2023-05-19 00:02:10 Whatever he's trying to warn me for
general 2023-05-19 00:02:38 Yeah this is an innuendo
You ping me every time you brought it up
general 2023-05-19 00:03:19 Nobody should be warned
Like he broke rules but used innuendo
And I called them out after he wanted me warned
That's it
general 2023-05-19 00:04:18 Bro everyone who does motorlock is undiagnosed autistic let's be real it is not as intuitive as we like to pretend
general 2023-05-19 00:05:25 Bros here will really do the "all you have to do is go in motor settings and click lock"

Knowing full well thats not how they learnt
general 2023-05-19 00:06:05 No true 
Just go to YouTube
general 2023-05-19 00:08:17 No I'm saying the community of people obsessed with the details on the nose of their favorite 27 planes
Or who know the exact dimensions of their favorite tank because they gave rebuilt it 999 times
Using weird unintuitive processes specific to THIS GAME
Is autistic 

This statement is not a stretch
general 2023-05-19 00:09:18 Cope
general 2023-05-19 00:09:45 This does not contradict anything
general 2023-05-19 00:10:01 It kinda reinforces the meme
general 2023-05-19 00:11:21 Autism 
You
With the 9 expert roles
Or yhe photographic memory of every jet

You guys are very autistic and its funny
general 2023-05-19 00:11:38 I mean it's not bad 
Idk why yall coping about it sm
general 2023-05-19 00:11:56 No it is nawt dog what
general 2023-05-19 00:12:22 Nah but mild disagreement based on nothing but not wanting to be autistic is cope
general 2023-05-19 00:12:55 I'm diagnosed with it 
Yall are stretching a lot
general 2023-05-19 00:13:51 You'd be right if anything I said was offensive to autistic people
general 2023-05-19 00:13:58 I mean it offended you guys so maybe
general 2023-05-19 00:14:58 Nah this is funny it clearly upsets you guys
If you don't want to look upset stop acting upset
general 2023-05-19 00:15:39 I do nawt want people here to like me
general 2023-05-19 00:17:10 Oh you're cool

Because most of them are clearly a little to out of touch
It's funny I have friends here
I talk to often

But they aren't active here
The people active here are very icky
general 2023-05-19 00:18:35 Which is why I like upsetting them over nonsense things like putting flags on my builds or calling them autistic for being autistic
general 2023-05-19 00:19:00 You don't know my personality because you literally don't know me lol
general 2023-05-19 00:19:44 Lol thus
My point
general 2023-05-19 00:20:04 TRUE
BRO HAS ALL THE ROLES 
Certified autism
general 2023-05-19 00:20:45 It is the only way you get all the rolls
general 2023-05-19 00:21:05 TRUE
general 2023-05-19 00:21:41 Lol
general 2023-05-19 00:22:34 I mean no
But also this is funny
So yes
Actually 
Everyone is autistic here but me
general 2023-05-19 00:22:36 Truly
general 2023-05-19 00:23:03 Well duh the whole thing was bait you just took it
general 2023-05-19 00:23:19 True
general 2023-05-19 00:24:00 No I'm pretty sure I made it clear it was bait from the start but like
Stay mad ig
general 2023-05-19 00:24:40 Yeah because you still are
general 2023-05-19 00:24:45 Acting mad
general 2023-05-19 00:25:09 Act like it then
general 2023-05-19 00:25:32 Good
general 2023-05-19 00:25:38 Keep feeling
general 2023-05-19 00:26:00 I actually have posts here from 2020
general 2023-05-19 00:26:06 I left for a while
general 2023-05-19 00:26:20 Ik incredible it resets if you leave
general 2023-05-19 00:26:43 You will nawt get me out
You can't have all the autism to yourself
general 2023-05-19 00:27:42 I'm still here to spite you specifically
general 2023-05-19 00:28:59 No I don't seriously think anyone's autistic
The community is very autistic as a whole
But that's a meme
Me calling it that got the reaction I wanted tho
general 2023-05-19 00:29:22 Why I like arguing with them
general 2023-05-19 00:29:48 It's not about winning they're all stupid it's literally just about making the terrible people here upset
general 2023-05-19 00:30:02 I already made that joke
general 2023-05-19 00:30:11 L wookie
general 2023-05-19 00:30:33 Am not Alt 
I've been here since 2020
general 2023-05-19 00:30:53 You stole my joke lol (not rry)
general 2023-05-19 00:31:35 Yeah it resets if you leave 
My post history goes back to 2020
general 2023-05-19 00:32:35 I'm on my bed but pop off
general 2023-05-19 00:33:11 Bro is infrared
general 2023-05-19 00:34:13 Your pfp looks like it'd be the default one on some school learning website for kids
general 2023-05-19 00:34:25 It's kinda surreal

general 2023-05-19 01:02:04 I cannot currently have kids
And also i like having money so no kids
general 2023-05-19 01:02:49 Both my partners are non binary
general 2023-05-19 01:02:55 No
general 2023-05-19 01:03:08 TRUE
general 2023-05-19 01:03:56 Like 2 different people
general 2023-05-19 01:04:01 Like I'm with 2 people
general 2023-05-19 01:04:10 No
general 2023-05-19 01:04:15 They're both non binary
general 2023-05-19 01:04:30 No
We live together
general 2023-05-19 01:05:08 Ah yes because I also ||redacted|| my freinds
general 2023-05-19 01:05:51 (I mean I do that too)

Humans are not strictly monogamous 
The nuclear family is a new thing
general 2023-05-19 01:06:07 Ong
general 2023-05-19 01:06:10 No
general 2023-05-19 01:06:31 No?
general 2023-05-19 01:06:35 And no we're not
general 2023-05-19 01:06:38 Lol
general 2023-05-19 01:06:51 The correct terminology
general 2023-05-19 01:08:23 I'm an ex jahovahs witness 

So I don't care much about most religion but do care about extremist religions
general 2023-05-19 01:08:52 This
general 2023-05-19 01:08:57 I mean cults
general 2023-05-19 01:09:12 Like JWs or Christian scientists
Mormons
Those groups
general 2023-05-19 01:09:40 Ehhh yeah
general 2023-05-19 01:09:48 It's both
general 2023-05-19 01:09:53 It's very much both
general 2023-05-19 01:10:39 Hey normal religions don't go out and found an entire state

There's a reason Utah has so many Mormons
And the history is telling
general 2023-05-19 01:11:37 Anyways the nuclear family is a post war thing
Before that most households were multigenerational and most kids raised communaly 
Under this system poly relationship were pretty common
general 2023-05-19 01:12:32 Uh yeah I don't like zionists either
general 2023-05-19 01:12:58 Probably you I'd imagine you're stronger then me
general 2023-05-19 01:13:25 I could outrun you tho my legs are very healthy and I only weigh 120 pbs
general 2023-05-19 01:13:38 Yep
general 2023-05-19 01:14:07 So no having "a partner" is not the default 
Neither is a single family household 
Sleeping around is
general 2023-05-19 01:14:16 Yes
general 2023-05-19 01:14:33 Well no
general 2023-05-19 01:14:46 Probably not marriage 
But sleeping around was very much common
general 2023-05-19 01:15:57 Marriage is it's own legal thing and exists because of monarchies needed a way to determine succession
Like a king would marry someone to pass on the thone 
But both parties could go off and sleep with whoever they wanted
The offspring would just be legally dead (not given the throne)
general 2023-05-19 01:16:15 Again you got it the other way around
general 2023-05-19 01:16:22 Transphobe L
general 2023-05-19 01:17:25 Well you can do that then

I like having 2 partners tho so ima keep doing that too
general 2023-05-19 01:17:58 I should be clear marriage has always been a 1-1 legal thing
Relationships are historically not very 1-1
general 2023-05-19 01:18:58 Both
Historically that line is very common
general 2023-05-19 01:19:22 Well no it's not an affair if everyone knows and is fine with it
And that was usually the case
general 2023-05-19 01:19:55 This was actually put in place to exclude Mormons funnily enough
general 2023-05-19 01:20:20 Yeah kinda
I don't want to get married though because it's a huge money sink
general 2023-05-19 01:20:50 Marriage is expensive and we poor
general 2023-05-19 01:21:48 By being born poor
general 2023-05-19 01:21:55 Ez
general 2023-05-19 01:22:23 I work 3 jobs
Food is expensive
general 2023-05-19 01:22:44 The US
general 2023-05-19 01:22:58 No
general 2023-05-19 01:23:20 No food is pretty expensive
general 2023-05-19 01:23:47 True
general 2023-05-19 01:24:07 Don't get me wrong being impoverished in the US is leages avove anywhere else
general 2023-05-19 01:24:26 Still yk
Well below the property line tho
general 2023-05-19 01:24:56 I do nawt plan on going to turkey
Your country is so bad we eat you once a year as a holiday
general 2023-05-19 01:25:32 BRO REAL
general 2023-05-19 01:25:44 Japan is up there with the most conservative hellholes
general 2023-05-19 01:26:37 It's an ethnostate where work culture is so dominating they string nets across roofs to stop people from jumping
And high-school is viewed as the last time of your life you have individual freedom

Which is why every other anime takes place in highschool
general 2023-05-19 01:27:30 TRUE
general 2023-05-19 01:28:05 It's so bad over there I hate weebs sm because it's hard to talk about how bad Japan is as long as they exist
general 2023-05-19 01:28:31 Also like the anime that does address these issues is often overlooked
general 2023-05-19 01:28:53 China has a lot of the same issues
general 2023-05-19 01:29:15 I do not know that much about india
general 2023-05-19 01:29:33 China has bigger nets and then work camps when people try
general 2023-05-19 01:30:27 Look I have been to American mental hospitals
They leave a lot to be desired 

Chinese reintegration camps though are hell
general 2023-05-19 01:31:54 That's literally the least offensive shit about Japan
This is how I know weeb detected
You picked the thing you'd know about from how weird anime is

As fucked up as their age of concent is its just a symptom of Japan's awfull shit
general 2023-05-19 01:32:52 ^he knows from experience
general 2023-05-19 01:33:45 Nah US propaganda says the opposite 
They like it when you like their military bases there
general 2023-05-19 01:34:30 Oh yeah
That's largely exadurated the US does the same thing to an extent
general 2023-05-19 01:35:49 True
general 2023-05-19 01:35:58 And it's still being made we just got better seats
general 2023-05-19 01:36:10 Like infinitely better seats

Bully me by making me have everything and then have to deal with society
general 2023-05-19 02:02:17 Based technicals
general 2023-05-19 02:02:54 Russia could easily be defeated by like
3 of these and a old ww2 halftrack
general 2023-05-19 02:03:21 True
general 2023-05-19 02:03:36 In lore they are referred to as a technical
general 2023-05-19 02:04:42 
general 2023-05-19 02:05:02 The automated version also exists in lore
As does an armored version
general 2023-05-19 02:05:15 Halo lore vehicles go hard
general 2023-05-19 02:05:43 He just like me fr
general 2023-05-19 02:06:19 I am barely a furry
I draw furry art (among other art) and have some characters
But most of my art isn't furry
general 2023-05-19 02:07:08 My roblox avatar was because hes a cheracter from a comic I did
general 2023-05-19 02:07:28 In that comic all the characters were animals during ww2
Each animal representing something
general 2023-05-19 02:07:43 Ok
general 2023-05-19 02:07:48 Idc if you care
general 2023-05-19 02:08:03 This is goofy tho
general 2023-05-19 02:08:40 Like I change my avatar all the time
It is often furry tho
Am I just not s furry when I take it off
general 2023-05-19 02:08:57 Goofy standard is goofy
general 2023-05-19 02:13:32 Bet
general 2023-05-19 02:15:21 Lol I use what I can get
general 2023-05-19 02:16:50 Also only one of those is pencil I mostly use ink
general 2023-05-19 02:17:16 Nah I'm good
general 2023-05-19 02:18:46 Vegan meat ranges from okay to garbage
If you're going vegan stop trying to eat fake meats you gotta embrace vegan foods 
Like not fake non vegan food
Just other food
general 2023-05-19 02:18:59 Yum
general 2023-05-19 02:19:43 I haven't seen anything to suggest that but I wouldn't doubt it
general 2023-05-19 02:20:19 Bad meme 

Creeper isn't charged
That's just a normal bomb
general 2023-05-19 02:21:15 Why would that be a charged creeper tho
general 2023-05-19 02:21:21 What would be a regular bomb
general 2023-05-19 02:23:10 People wanting the US to apologize for using nukes

But then not all the other bombing we did
Like this is Tokyo after a firebombing by us
general 2023-05-19 02:24:07 FR
general 2023-05-19 02:25:08 Firebombings like that are actually existentially fucking scary
Because it litterally sucks the oxygen out of nearby buildings and basements 
More would suffocate then burn
general 2023-05-19 02:25:21 And the wind it caused was enough to do damage as well
general 2023-05-19 02:25:37 Firebombs did it too 
You just had to use a lot of them
general 2023-05-19 02:25:50 We used a lot of them
general 2023-05-19 02:25:57 Oh no then
general 2023-05-19 02:26:27 Normal fire bombs require oxygen and move hot air upwards
Making wind that sucks upwards and sucking oxygen towards the fire
general 2023-05-19 02:27:17 Firebombing is horrific and like

Bruh if your concerns about allied bombing begin and end at the nukes you do not know enough about ww2 or 1 for that matter
general 2023-05-19 02:27:56 It's called being assertive I didn't need you too
general 2023-05-19 02:28:05 Yep
general 2023-05-19 02:28:37 I agree with the bombs for the record
I don't really care about the past like that arguing over the morality of something that already happened is kinda dumb
general 2023-05-19 02:28:51 TRUE
general 2023-05-19 02:29:08 Wait

For the US or japan???
general 2023-05-19 02:31:00 Nah the people hit by the atomic bombs didn't know that they'd even been hit by an atomic bomb 
Or what it was
Because again this is what all bombs the allies dropped on them did
They all could level cities

From my understanding initially(I'm talking hours after) allot of people thought it was some new higher flying bomber the US had used
general 2023-05-19 02:32:21 Japan didn't belive the US had used anything remarkable 

Until the second one
Even after the second one it took about a day for Japanese bureaucracy to sort out everything
general 2023-05-19 02:32:35 Again firebombs mostly killed with suffocation
general 2023-05-19 02:32:54 This wasn't new
general 2023-05-19 02:33:13 No obviously it was very new
general 2023-05-19 02:34:15 But the first atomic bombs didn't look that differently from other bombs at the time
And the aftermath looked the same
It was only after parts of the Japanese army realized it was just one bomb
general 2023-05-19 02:35:02 The warning warned of bombing and depicted firebombing b29s
general 2023-05-19 02:35:21 Which depicted firebombing b29s
general 2023-05-19 02:35:33 Yeah
general 2023-05-19 02:36:26 So no
The Japanese army assumed it was a pretty normal bombing 
The Japanese navy (and airforce in the area) had almost no knowledge of it
And the government had very delayed response because nobody knew what the fuck was going on
general 2023-05-19 02:37:09 It was a big deal
But only in hindsight
It wasn't that different from any other bombing we did

Which is to say all bombings were pretty fucked these ones aren't to special
general 2023-05-19 02:37:51 Again
This is what a normal bombing looked like afterwards 

Nobody knew it wasn't a normal bombing
general 2023-05-19 02:38:29 That picture isn't of Hiroshima or Nagasaki it's of Tokyo a year earlier
general 2023-05-19 02:38:35 So yeah a normal bombing
general 2023-05-19 02:39:15 And he insisted it wasn't a normal bombing
general 2023-05-19 02:39:41 Yeah but the sarcasm implied it wasn't normal
general 2023-05-19 02:40:28 YEAH IMPLYING IT DOESN'T
general 2023-05-19 02:40:38 When that is a normal fucking bombing
general 2023-05-19 02:40:56 YEAH AND THE SARCASM PROVES ME RIGHT DUMBASS
general 2023-05-19 02:41:10 If your dead how is anyone else supposed to know it wasn't normal
general 2023-05-19 02:41:24 If your not dead  why would anyone belive you
general 2023-05-19 02:43:20 Not to mention there were japanese planes in the air above the city as well
And it was stormy weather 
B29s fly above Japanese airtraffic

Importantly these were navy airforce so even if they did see the planes they would have to communicate that with the army airforce which was its own thing
And then communicate that to the government
Basically nobody realized it was just one bomb for days
And then we Basically told them 

This is highly documented
general 2023-05-19 02:44:05 You guys are literally going "well its a nuke we all know what a nuke looks like" bruh it looks like every other bombing

Thats what they thought it was
general 2023-05-19 02:44:47 No it wasn't
That's been my point the whole time
The Japanese government took almost 4 days to respond and 1 of those days they literally had no idea anything had happened
general 2023-05-19 02:47:05 I'm not talking about what a guy on the ground would experience he's either dead or nobody cares
Nothing any civilian in Nagasaki reported would make its way to the Japanese government until way way afterwards
So to the relevant parties it looked like a normal fire bombing 

The army thought that was what it was because they didn't hear anything different from the navy (who had airspace coverage)
The navy didn't care about it
And as a result the army took forever taking any of it to the government
general 2023-05-19 02:47:35 Nah dude you literally respond with one short quip saying the same dumb wrong shit
general 2023-05-19 02:47:58 And then get mad when I respond because it takes too long for me to type and you get bored after 30 seconds
general 2023-05-19 02:48:30 YEAH BECAUSE JAPAN WAS MILITARIST
general 2023-05-19 02:48:38 THE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE WAS BAD
general 2023-05-19 02:48:46 It took forever to get any information through
general 2023-05-19 02:48:49 Anywhere
general 2023-05-19 02:49:26 Yeah it took almost a day
And then the government spent 2 days sitting on it
general 2023-05-19 02:49:48 This isn't what militarist means oml
general 2023-05-19 02:49:56 Ywah
general 2023-05-19 02:50:03 Thats what they did
general 2023-05-19 02:50:14 Wild right
general 2023-05-19 02:51:29 Fucking insane even

They were literally bogged down first in not knowing it was nukes
Then not knowing what a nuke was
Then not knowing what to do about it
Then not wanting to react

It was a whole 3 day thing
general 2023-05-19 02:52:15 No losers aren't decided via popularity you're wrong
general 2023-05-19 02:52:23 You guys are just bored of arguing
general 2023-05-19 02:52:41 I never said that
general 2023-05-19 02:52:49 Nobody cared
general 2023-05-19 02:52:55 The aftermath looked the same
general 2023-05-19 02:53:25 Yeah to the Japanese government hours later it did
general 2023-05-19 02:53:35 For a whole day
general 2023-05-19 02:55:07 they don't look as different to normal bombings as you might think
And the Japanese string of communication was garbage
It was a factionalist and militaristic state
general 2023-05-19 02:56:05 And how would you 
The Japanese government 
Know that it was only one bomb
general 2023-05-19 02:57:54 Well see
It was cloudy 
And the navy had planes flying over when the American bomber flew over

B29s just fly a lot higher then them and had such regular presence the navy didn't care

If you were on the ground you'd have no idea how many planes there were
general 2023-05-19 02:57:59 And they didn't
general 2023-05-19 02:58:20 (They being the Japanese army who was relying on the navy af to tell them if there were planes flying over)
general 2023-05-19 02:58:55 Yeah because it was just one bomber 
And they didn't know it had a nuke
And the planes couldn't attack it it's a b29 flying well above their service ceiling
general 2023-05-19 02:59:53 Not for one bomber
general 2023-05-19 03:00:08 In the army
general 2023-05-19 03:00:22 The two are completely separate and the navy had air coverage
general 2023-05-19 03:00:43 The two also hated each other
Again chain of communication is why it took so long
general 2023-05-19 03:00:55 This is what I have been talking about this whole time
general 2023-05-19 03:01:23 No it littlerally is
They didn't know it was a nuke for a whole day because of the chain of communication
general 2023-05-19 03:02:34 That's been what I'm arguing
And you meatheads were like "it's a nuke you can see it was just one bomb"
Bro who the airforce the navy the government? Who it's not like one person can see it and tell the government that isn't how it works
general 2023-05-19 03:03:43 And it was detected by the navy who didn't have capable fighters 
And didn't communicate it to the army

From my understanding the single bomber wasn't communicated higher up for hours
general 2023-05-19 03:04:42 Well the fact that they didn't know how many bombs was dropped is why they didn't know
We just covered this
general 2023-05-19 03:05:18 THEY DIDNT KNO THAT
general 2023-05-19 03:05:22 Yeah obviously now
general 2023-05-19 03:05:53 Unbelievable after all that you've circled back around to saying the same dumb thing as the start
general 2023-05-19 03:07:29 "Buh it was obviously one bomb Japan knew it was one bomb because there was only one)
You're an idiot
Who is Japan (the government the population the navy the army??)
Do you think they counted the bombs as they fell? How does that work? We already covered they didn't see the plane so how did Who know it was one
How is this so obvious to them
general 2023-05-19 03:09:55 
general 2023-05-19 03:10:49 Singular "they" has a longer history of use then singular "you"

So start calling people thou or shut up
general 2023-05-19 03:11:23 Okay?? I haven't cared about pronouns once
general 2023-05-19 03:11:49 It's funnier that you go to he in trying to be transphobic tho because I'm way closer to female then male
general 2023-05-19 03:14:02 I fucking wish
general 2023-05-19 03:14:28 Nah bro I was just built different
general 2023-05-19 03:14:51 You want so badly to call me a guy but like that doesn't offend me either
I don't know what you're getting out of it
general 2023-05-19 03:15:27 TRU
general 2023-05-19 03:16:09 PCCs smartest member
general 2023-05-19 03:16:27 LOL
general 2023-05-19 03:16:41 That was some goofy shit
general 2023-05-19 03:17:01 I kinda expected him to keep arguing it ima be real
general 2023-05-19 03:17:19 Yeah both happen
It's got a lot of flavors
general 2023-05-19 03:18:00 That picture is surprisingly on topic
general 2023-05-19 03:18:38 Nah half of chat has already heard it and will get triggered if I do
general 2023-05-19 03:19:06 Also the censor bot doesn't like a lot of the words I need to describe it
general 2023-05-19 03:19:35 Fr
general 2023-05-19 03:19:52 But the anatomical words for private parts isn't allowed
general 2023-05-19 03:20:28 We've been over this I tried they wouldn't let me
general 2023-05-19 03:20:40 I WAS ASKED
general 2023-05-19 03:20:44 Bruh
general 2023-05-19 03:20:52 I get asked every time
general 2023-05-19 03:21:13 AND I DIDN'T
general 2023-05-19 03:21:32 Bruh I said nothing suggestive chill
general 2023-05-19 03:21:47 I said why I wasn't talking about it
general 2023-05-19 03:21:54 Like what
general 2023-05-19 03:22:10 Yeah that's not suggestive
general 2023-05-19 03:23:12 That's not against the rules I was explaining why I didn't talk about it morfix trying to get me banned again
general 2023-05-19 03:24:00 Bruh I didn't break any rules
general 2023-05-19 03:24:37 They literally just don't like me
Which is fine but I didn't break any rules so why would I be warned
general 2023-05-19 03:25:25 Okay
So you're false reporting me because I'm annoying
general 2023-05-19 03:25:31 Bruh
general 2023-05-19 03:27:33 True
Kinda
general 2023-05-19 03:27:52 ngrder
general 2023-05-19 03:27:57 E
general 2023-05-19 03:28:37 Tbf we've actually had no gender arguments today
It was me calling the server autistic and then ww2 Japan
general 2023-05-19 03:29:16 Well that one guy coming in and trying really hard to start one I'm not counting
general 2023-05-19 03:29:55 That wasn't about gender?
general 2023-05-19 03:30:32 No what argument are you referring to
general 2023-05-19 03:31:01 The intersex one wasn't an argument it was one guy trying to be insulting and failing
And was really funny
And beyond that was just them trying to false report me
general 2023-05-19 03:31:12 No actual arguing happened
general 2023-05-19 03:32:07 Ight
general 2023-05-19 03:33:20 
general 2023-05-19 03:33:42 I don't have the emoji
general 2023-05-19 03:33:45 I wish I did
general 2023-05-19 03:33:55 Bruh you crop it
general 2023-05-19 03:34:39 Skill issue

general 2023-05-19 03:37:58 No thanks
general 2023-05-19 03:38:23 Do you want me to crop out the white
general 2023-05-19 03:39:37 Cool down
general 2023-05-19 03:49:44 
general 2023-05-19 03:50:18 I don't know i wasn't sent a looping one
general 2023-05-19 03:50:50 No thanks
general 2023-05-19 03:50:53 (Ew)
general 2023-05-19 03:51:20 
general 2023-05-19 03:52:38 Nah
This chat could throw me out to the wolves and I'd come back pregnant I am unkillable
general 2023-05-19 03:53:07 Bro stop arguing about gender
general 2023-05-19 03:53:12 What's wrong with u
general 2023-05-19 03:53:27 But it's funny
general 2023-05-19 03:53:44 It's
A lazerpig bit
general 2023-05-19 03:53:50 Very funne
general 2023-05-19 03:54:18 Nah
general 2023-05-19 03:55:13 That is not how fact checking works
general 2023-05-19 03:55:57 When has he?
general 2023-05-19 03:56:15 He's pretty good on sourcing and his community gets on his ass when he doesn't
general 2023-05-19 03:57:05 True someone make it
general 2023-05-19 03:57:13 It'd be funni
general 2023-05-19 03:57:41 This is anti intellectual 
I'm not arguing serious anymore because you don't care
Silly mode engaged
general 2023-05-19 03:57:52 Probably
general 2023-05-19 03:58:29 I was raised by 2 bricks and a rubber duck
general 2023-05-19 03:58:44 His name was Alfred James
general 2023-05-19 03:58:59 Me either tbh
general 2023-05-19 03:59:45 Bro okay
It's been out for like a week who had the time
general 2023-05-19 04:00:24 Nah 
Like actual furries are scary
general 2023-05-19 04:01:18 I am not that furry I just draw them sometimes
Usually forgot her people
And have a furry avatar 

Actual furries have to much time and money on this
general 2023-05-19 04:02:07 I haven't actually met any like that
general 2023-05-19 04:02:12 But they are out there fs
general 2023-05-19 04:02:28 True
general 2023-05-19 04:03:15 I wish
general 2023-05-19 04:03:24 I am not that funny
general 2023-05-19 04:03:30 Or that good at digital art
general 2023-05-19 04:03:47 It is
Omg we do not exist in the same spaces clearly
general 2023-05-19 04:04:22 Fine wrong audience for that meme mb
general 2023-05-19 04:04:42 Egg detected
general 2023-05-19 04:05:53 Actually I have a good reason being I have a lot of old stuff backed up
But I do just like getting into arguments with bad people
Most of the active people here are disgusting 
So I match tone and make them mad
general 2023-05-19 04:06:19 But it's fun
general 2023-05-19 04:06:33 (For me idc about anyone else)
general 2023-05-19 04:06:53 True
general 2023-05-19 04:08:27 True
general 2023-05-19 04:08:43 Bro you could make the bad piggies plane on flightpoint
general 2023-05-19 04:08:49 Someone should do that
general 2023-05-19 04:09:49 I don't know what sprocket is
Can it do boats
general 2023-05-19 04:10:02 Stormworks is pretty cool I need to get it
general 2023-05-19 04:10:38 Flightpoint is cool because interior
general 2023-05-19 04:11:14 I'm slowly working on a blueprint accurate LST
general 2023-05-19 04:11:44 True
general 2023-05-19 04:12:07 I've explained it before but I do have a good reason for putting gay flags on builds that isn't just pride
general 2023-05-19 04:13:13 Mostly that what actually hung there was the flag used by the Germans in ww2
And the wall looks empty without it so I have to put something there
So I use flags I like instead
Most of the flags I put are just replacing real country flags because I don't want to rep a real country when I'm the one who did the build
general 2023-05-19 04:13:41 And also the real country is awfull
general 2023-05-19 04:13:57 You'd be sick
general 2023-05-19 04:14:15 What are you using as thrust
general 2023-05-19 04:14:38 Okay Try using hover engines
general 2023-05-19 04:15:08 If not play around with how it's disconnected from the vehicle
general 2023-05-19 04:15:36 
general 2023-05-19 04:17:35 No
general 2023-05-19 04:17:48 I don't think so
general 2023-05-19 04:18:20 I- no I'm pretty sure it's like a meme about playing in a creek wut
general 2023-05-19 04:18:35 Np!
general 2023-05-19 04:20:35 Yeah it's the Netflix meme
general 2023-05-19 04:20:54 That's been used for everything
general 2023-05-19 04:21:55 
general 2023-05-19 04:23:55 I hate PC sm like I have several ships that I will never finish because they bug out now 
Rest in peace kitakami
general 2023-05-19 04:24:32 Chiseld is 16 but yeah
general 2023-05-19 04:24:51 Also yeah no having actual devs you can talk to is great
general 2023-05-19 04:25:06 I already did
general 2023-05-19 04:25:43 No I never toned them down on that
general 2023-05-19 04:25:48 I would have if I could finish it
general 2023-05-19 04:25:52 But broken game
general 2023-05-19 04:26:11 I do
general 2023-05-19 04:26:18 That thing had 40 working launching torpedoes
general 2023-05-19 04:26:26 I really should
general 2023-05-19 04:26:41 I don't know any
Nor have money for games
general 2023-05-19 04:26:51 I do have to get stormworks
general 2023-05-19 04:27:38 I like tanks too I just never got good at making them in plane crazy so i stopped
general 2023-05-19 04:28:03 I can make to scale aerosani in fp tho which is cool
general 2023-05-19 04:28:18 I want to do a T-35 next
general 2023-05-19 04:28:25 Because it's my favorite tank
general 2023-05-19 04:31:47 <@702907851001167882> can I see some builds in sprocket
general 2023-05-19 04:31:55 Like I don't know anything about it
general 2023-05-19 04:32:35 Wait wrong person
general 2023-05-19 04:32:40 Lol ok
general 2023-05-19 04:34:21 T-35 makes me feel funny silly
general 2023-05-19 04:36:17 Power up the thrusters before launch
general 2023-05-19 04:36:51 Oo
general 2023-05-19 04:37:40 Nice truck
general 2023-05-19 04:38:23 There is no Russia
Only east Ukraine
general 2023-05-19 04:39:30 True
general 2023-05-19 04:42:52 
general 2023-05-19 04:43:14 Nah that's epic
general 2023-05-20 02:02:19 real
general 2023-05-22 13:02:49 Mmm
general 2023-05-22 13:04:28 Big plane
general 2023-05-22 13:07:46 It's roscale
general 2023-05-22 13:07:55 Not even oversized
general 2023-05-22 13:08:45 Flightpoint
general 2023-05-22 13:09:19 Based pfp
general 2023-05-22 13:10:01 
general 2023-05-22 13:13:11 My plane is more accurate to the original then the miyazaki depiction
general 2023-05-22 13:13:20 Very goofy
general 2023-05-22 13:16:04 
general 2023-05-22 13:16:12 Nah they talking
general 2023-05-22 13:17:44 https://youtu.be/1OO78jqp2J8
general 2023-05-22 13:18:44 See I generally agree
general 2023-05-22 13:19:03 I don't like anime but I like studio ghibli a lot
general 2023-05-22 13:19:12 And the wind rises is amazing
general 2023-05-22 13:19:18 I have the manga
general 2023-05-22 13:19:21 Can't even read it
general 2023-05-22 13:19:30 I just like the pretty drawings
general 2023-05-22 13:20:48 No fr this is why I can't do anime like all of the "popular "good" ones are still creepy
general 2023-05-22 13:22:13 I don't like girls und panzer it's not a good show
It's fun to make memes about and was seemingly made for the internet
It's okay for that
But as a show it's so bad
general 2023-05-22 13:23:15 Based shork
general 2023-05-22 13:23:52 Blahaj protecs trans kids
general 2023-05-22 13:24:23 The worst studio ghibli movie isn't bad

It's just missing an ending
general 2023-05-22 13:31:47 So Wikipedia claims this thing had 12 machine guns

I count 7
Maybe 8 but I think the thing in the front is a navigator window
So
Idk what the deal with that is
general 2023-05-22 13:53:27 Man I made a ca 3 (tho i gotta redo it at somepoint because i am not happy witb my decision to scale it around the mini gun) and am now doing the ca 90 in flightpoint 

I could next do the ca 70 and have a caproni fighter plane
Or continue with the wind rises theme and do a G-38 or Ca 60 https://youtu.be/Iv8HskEijbA
general 2023-05-22 13:56:04 Ca 60 would be hard considering the complication of getting it to actually fly
general 2023-05-23 13:33:01 Ight so how did they get up there
Because there's a machine gun position up there too
Miyazaki shows them climbing the strut but like climbing it to where??
general 2023-05-23 13:34:23 It's a flag
general 2023-05-23 13:34:38 He's waving a flag
general 2023-05-23 13:36:28 This is the full clip https://youtu.be/eBk2NBOp9g0
general 2023-05-23 13:37:05 And the plane is ofc a caproni ca 90
general 2023-05-23 13:37:45 It was the largest biplane ever built on land 🥺
general 2023-05-23 13:39:43 It's equally impressive at roscale
general 2023-05-23 13:43:21 Yk the ball turret for the B-17
How it did the thing where it had to retract into the plane before landing
And if it's hydrolics got shot up and the plane crashed the guy inside would be smashed to bits

This bomber had one of those too except it wasn't a ball it was like
A tin can
And it wasn't electronic it was operated by cables
general 2023-05-23 13:46:16 You can just block me??.. it hides my messages.. idk like if I bother you sm just block me it takes less effort
general 2023-05-23 13:48:20 Well sorry that it takes up too much space
I'm not going anywhere over a minor annoyance you have
general 2023-05-23 13:48:24 Prick
general 2023-05-23 13:49:07 This movie has the funny meme plane in it too https://youtu.be/Iv8HskEijbA
general 2023-05-23 13:50:57 Well no the "caproni triplane" would better describe the ca 4
general 2023-05-23 13:52:08 The ca 60 was a novaplano 
Or 9 wing
And was literally when you look at it literally 
3 ca 4s stacked back to back with the passenger cabin of a ca 4 passenger variant under it
general 2023-05-23 13:52:38 He just kept doing what worked
general 2023-05-23 13:52:45 Until it didn't
general 2023-05-23 13:53:38 Oh buddy you think that ones goofy
That one made way for jet engines 

You haven't seen the goofy shit that man came up with
general 2023-05-23 13:55:04 No they're normal engines
It's a normal plane
general 2023-05-23 13:55:43 The only wierd thing I can spot about it is I have no idea what the seat near the rear gunner is for
general 2023-05-23 13:56:27 This plane would have still had one pilot when it was invisioned
general 2023-05-23 13:58:23 Idk
Caproni made weird planes tho
general 2023-05-23 13:59:02 (That never even kind of flew)
general 2023-05-23 13:59:15 Nowhere near a strong enough engine
general 2023-05-23 14:00:42 Ofc
general 2023-05-23 14:01:50 Yeah ik other countries got pretty much identical designs working
general 2023-05-23 14:01:57 It was a functional design
general 2023-05-23 14:02:05 Just not with the engine they had
general 2023-05-23 14:02:58 Depends on the country
general 2023-05-23 14:03:45 Oh I don't know anything about that aircraft
general 2023-05-23 14:04:04 I don't find it particularly interesting because it doesn't look as cool to me
general 2023-05-23 14:10:33 The ca 90
general 2023-05-23 14:10:42 Beast of an airplane
general 2023-05-23 14:27:23 Small fighter
general 2023-05-23 14:27:40 So yeah once I finish my ca 90 in fp
general 2023-05-23 14:28:44 Ima do either a rescale of my ca 3 or a ca 70 night fighter 
Because this plane is adorable and I could get it done in like a day
general 2023-05-23 15:20:18 
general 2023-05-24 00:40:48 I like  how I get pinged every time the chat gets homophobic
general 2023-05-24 03:07:25 Based
general 2023-05-24 05:38:48 chuga chuga horse horse
general 2023-05-24 05:54:43 stop doxing me
general 2023-05-25 10:39:34 Im still here

general 2023-05-25 11:22:57 it's signs motors (when your ping is bad) jetpacks suspension (when you stress them to much) hover thrusters (require to many resources from the server and can down servers if there are to many of them) submarines or litterally anything underwater
general 2023-05-25 11:23:04 all broken
general 2023-05-25 11:24:06 no it is not
general 2023-05-25 11:24:14 you have just done it for a while
general 2023-05-25 11:24:21 this game is bad
general 2023-05-25 11:24:27 like objectively
general 2023-05-25 11:24:36 play a real building game they get better
general 2023-05-25 11:25:11 like play stormworks
general 2023-05-25 11:25:43 motor lock is unintuitive garbage that started as a bug shut up
general 2023-05-25 11:25:59 like you shouldn't remove it
general 2023-05-25 11:26:17 it's the only thing the game has going for it
general 2023-05-25 11:26:29 but all thats doing is speaking for how bad the game is lol
general 2023-05-25 11:27:29 nah bud powering is dumb
hot take it's a bad feature bedrock redstone is more accessible and thus better
general 2023-05-25 11:28:19 no it's not most vehlicle games have part clipping
general 2023-05-25 11:28:32 we just have to work for ours in a really stupid way
general 2023-05-25 11:29:20 again plain crazy is not a good game- like it was
but it's not now
general 2023-05-25 11:29:32 move on
general 2023-05-25 11:31:13 https://tenor.com/view/modsoffline-zemo-zemo-mods-offline-dancing-zemo-zemo-dancing-gif-21225734
general 2023-05-25 11:32:07 to be clear in pc's case it's the game that's the problem
general 2023-05-25 11:32:27 the community being bad is just ontop of it
general 2023-05-25 11:33:12 again all theyd have to do to fix the server is lower hof standards a tiny bit
general 2023-05-25 11:33:18 just a tiny bit
general 2023-05-25 11:33:34 activity would spike here
general 2023-05-25 11:33:42 which would spike activity in the game
general 2023-05-25 11:33:44 but uh
general 2023-05-25 11:33:54 probably not worth it given the game is bad
general 2023-05-25 11:34:15 so artificially lower it
general 2023-05-25 11:34:18 easy
general 2023-05-25 11:35:16 lower quality then the best build in hof???
general 2023-05-25 11:35:19 yeah actually
general 2023-05-25 11:35:23 yeah I do want that
general 2023-05-25 11:36:01 that sounds like a good idea I don't think the single best build in hof gets to determine what else gets in hof it should be many good builds
general 2023-05-25 11:37:31 no it's litterally just on the mods here
general 2023-05-25 11:37:39 they just need to let more stuff in
general 2023-05-25 11:39:22 oh ew that's a bad system
general 2023-05-25 11:39:34 democracy doesn't issue quality what
general 2023-05-25 11:40:24 i'm not suggesting that either
general 2023-05-25 11:42:06 I'm glad
general 2023-05-25 11:42:44 morfix is vile he gets no hof
bro spends his entire life in this danm plane game GO OUTSIDE
general 2023-05-25 11:42:46 fr
general 2023-05-25 11:43:51 that'd be the last thing you'd want to do you'd just alienate more people
general 2023-05-25 11:44:38 okay but like- this server is so elitist
general 2023-05-25 11:45:01 no everyone is
general 2023-05-25 11:45:27 ah because my freind
general 2023-05-25 11:45:39 it'd be fine if the rank system was left at that
general 2023-05-25 11:45:42 but some people
general 2023-05-25 11:45:48 vile stupid people
general 2023-05-25 11:46:01 will be disgusting about the ranks
general 2023-05-25 11:46:18 and bruh it's literally a plane game
general 2023-05-25 11:48:12 if you wasted time getting all the ranks in the server for a plane game im sorry but like- you don't get to act like a prick to others
all that actually demonstrates is you're lack of life
general 2023-05-25 11:51:45 it's full of racists bigots and misoganists- it's a server for a military vehicle game played by children that they take way to seriously 

It's not getting nicer
general 2023-05-25 11:52:37 hating women
general 2023-05-25 11:53:17 ?

general 2023-05-25 11:55:08 suffer
general 2023-05-25 11:57:16 I was complaining about people here hating women- literally the oppoisite
general 2023-05-25 11:58:06 people here like in many roblox related servers can get weird about women
general 2023-05-25 11:59:26 oh yeah roblox servers get full of incels too
general 2023-05-25 11:59:33 don't like them either
general 2023-05-25 11:59:59 I'm a they and I want to be neither

general 2023-05-25 12:03:22 they/them

general 2023-05-25 12:03:51 like bruh
general 2023-05-25 12:04:11 no... it's.. english
general 2023-05-25 12:04:53 singular they/them has a longer history in English then singualr you
general 2023-05-25 12:05:21 which is fine?

and also like? why would that stop you from calling me that
general 2023-05-25 12:06:41 like 200 years ago maybe? language changes-
general 2023-05-25 12:06:49 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex
general 2023-05-25 12:06:54 I'm intersex
general 2023-05-25 12:07:08 my body does infact make both
general 2023-05-25 12:08:10 nah we're common as hell 
more common then natural redheads in the US
general 2023-05-25 12:08:39 that is not how that works
general 2023-05-25 12:08:47 mutation happens all the time
general 2023-05-25 12:08:53 both
general 2023-05-25 12:10:09 bruh
general 2023-05-25 12:12:46 okay so I was born with full woom 
the rest on the outside was also female except for some tissue where a pp would be which was larger
I had 2 balls but one was internal
and so they removed the one that was external
general 2023-05-25 12:14:39 okay so 
people like "this" Idk if you're referring to trans or intersex people have always been a thing 
trans people are more "common now" because the social stigma around them has lessoned
the same reasons why there became more left handed people in the 80s
general 2023-05-25 12:16:50 animals aren't trans because the social constructs around gender don't exist for them- but we do see intersex animals
Here is an intersex deer
a doe with antlers if you will
general 2023-05-25 12:17:08 I don't know why they grow like that
general 2023-05-25 12:17:53 it looks AI generated but it's a real thing
general 2023-05-25 12:18:06 that deer was vibin
general 2023-05-25 12:19:27 we weren't talking about politics we were mostly talking about science what
general 2023-05-25 12:21:18 you think that's bad
dude deer are secretly vile animals

here's one that tore off it's opponents head and carried it around
general 2023-05-25 12:22:33 nah it's happened to many times that theory has been ruled out
general 2023-05-25 12:25:42 thats just what researches are saying man idk
general 2023-05-25 12:25:57 deer are crazy
general 2023-05-25 12:26:26 look into the phenomenon??
general 2023-05-25 12:27:05 like thats the current theory? because it happened to many times for the corpse theory to be accurate
general 2023-05-25 12:27:35 from which time it's happened many?
general 2023-05-25 12:28:03 many times?
general 2023-05-25 12:28:59 which time did the article report on?
general 2023-05-25 12:34:33 because if it was the most popular news article (and thus articles parroting it) reporting on the one image that was going around a few years ago that image basically started research onto the whole thing

there have been a lot of times we know about it happening since meaning it's a lot less coincidental leading to the deer picking a fight with a dead deer being less likely as we know deer recognize and avoid dead deer

a more likely theory is they fight to the point one is weak enough or dead for the other to pull its head off
deer locked in a rut like this will fight for days
general 2023-05-25 12:36:15 nah think after days of fighting and pulling the tissue is a lot weaker
general 2023-05-25 12:36:26 deer is dehydrated
general 2023-05-25 12:37:08 no because they're meant to move some ways and not other ways
general 2023-05-25 12:37:30 like the dear isn't pulling with it's neck in ways that will break it's own neck
general 2023-05-25 12:37:49 I mean it might deer are dumb I'm sure we'll find something like that
general 2023-05-25 12:38:01 omg do you know what a raindeer cyclone is
general 2023-05-25 12:38:31 also I need to make sure cheese has their breakfast ruined with the image too
general 2023-05-25 12:39:05 they recognize and avoid dead deer
general 2023-05-25 12:40:41 I- don't know what to look up to check for that the thing I was reading from just asserted it
general 2023-05-25 12:41:38 anyways- uh I want to change topic because I am a spaz (I'm allowed)
general 2023-05-25 12:42:05 raindeer cyclones
general 2023-05-25 12:42:43 it's so stupid]
general 2023-05-25 12:42:50 yk how this happens
general 2023-05-25 12:42:58 so raindeer herd right
general 2023-05-25 12:43:18 so in their brain what they're doing is they see deer infront of them and fallow
general 2023-05-25 12:43:47 very nice
u have good line of deer
general 2023-05-25 12:43:55 one fallows after the next after the next
general 2023-05-25 12:44:16 the problem is when they loop back up on themselves and just don't notice
general 2023-05-25 12:44:25 they have no idea they're going in a circle
general 2023-05-25 12:45:01 let me repeat that
that herd of reindeer thinks they are walking somewhere
general 2023-05-25 12:45:20 and no individual member knows they are walking in a circle
general 2023-05-25 12:46:02 deer are so stupid
general 2023-05-25 12:46:27 oh and then there was that one raindeer cyclone that was struck by lightning
general 2023-05-25 12:47:03 
general 2023-05-25 12:47:17 323
general 2023-05-25 12:47:49 thats not it's just norway
general 2023-05-25 12:47:58 norway was built in unreal engine
general 2023-05-25 12:50:36 
general 2023-05-25 12:51:14 they're so dumb
general 2023-05-25 12:51:18 birds do this too
general 2023-05-25 12:51:40 yeah
general 2023-05-25 12:54:22 yall flightpoint is legit so good go get good at it (mind you I am not yet good at it)

general 2023-05-25 13:49:29 it is-
general 2023-05-25 13:51:23 you can laugh but I feel pretty good about it so far
general 2023-05-25 13:52:23 oh no the video was bad
general 2023-05-25 13:52:36 I need to get a screencap Im just lazy
general 2023-05-25 13:54:00 someone has a motorbike on the workshop and it is the funnest thing I have ever driven in a roblox game it's so stuipid
general 2023-05-25 13:54:55 at least the physics will come
general 2023-05-25 13:55:02 and yk *they will*
general 2023-05-25 13:55:22 because it's the only thing people complain about the game with
general 2023-05-25 13:55:39 "plane crazy has better physics"
general 2023-05-25 13:56:05 plane crazy's are also bad
general 2023-05-25 13:56:20 but people are used to it and want to stay in their safe space
general 2023-05-25 13:56:37 cant try a new game even when their current one is dying
general 2023-05-25 15:18:25 
general 2023-05-25 15:21:36

general 2023-05-25 15:25:47 Or suggest it to cheese for flightpoint
general 2023-05-25 15:28:30 Pc2 just doesn't exist 
It isn't going to happen flat out
general 2023-05-25 15:29:17 Do were lots of projects
general 2023-05-25 15:29:22 It's gone nowhere
general 2023-05-25 15:30:04 If you want a feature in plane crazy 
Or want plane crazy to get a bug fix get on your big girl boots and make your own game

general 2023-05-25 18:15:51 This isn't how masks work
general 2023-05-25 18:16:59 No I wear one because my body makes testosterone so I grow stubble 
And It's annoying to shave all the time
general 2023-05-25 18:17:49 So I wear a mask to cover it instead

general 2023-05-25 19:03:18 It's not a problem
I was just born as both male and female
general 2023-05-25 19:04:30 Okay no
I'm intersex
general 2023-05-25 19:05:51 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex
general 2023-05-25 19:07:12 It literally just means I'm both
general 2023-05-25 19:07:32 The women's 
I'm more feminine
general 2023-05-25 19:08:00 No
general 2023-05-25 19:08:05 That's not how that works
general 2023-05-25 19:08:16 I get the same number as the rest of you
general 2023-05-25 19:08:25 Just a mixed bag of them
general 2023-05-25 19:10:38 Use the girls room because I for all intensive purposes (when I make sure to shave) look like a girl
general 2023-05-25 19:11:06 I would rather die
general 2023-05-25 19:11:39 Shorts
general 2023-05-25 19:12:03 No
general 2023-05-25 19:12:11 Yep
general 2023-05-25 19:12:19 I love them
general 2023-05-25 19:12:57 No
general 2023-05-25 19:13:30 I mean I can but only the same way any girl can
general 2023-05-25 19:14:02 I'm pan if that's what your asking
general 2023-05-25 19:14:34 My body makes both
general 2023-05-25 19:14:56 They're pretty much the same but it think pan is more semantically correct
general 2023-05-25 19:15:16 Well no
general 2023-05-25 19:15:25 Testosterone wins out
general 2023-05-25 19:15:51 It's the stronger hormone
general 2023-05-25 19:17:15 I could if I took testosterone suppressors or had the organ in question that makes it removed
general 2023-05-25 19:17:30 Nah this ain't true
general 2023-05-25 19:18:06 Depends on the trans people
general 2023-05-25 19:18:29 Yeah but not what the usage of that word means
general 2023-05-25 19:19:05 Right I personally am glad I can fuck around lots and not worry about kids
general 2023-05-25 19:20:49 Like I sleep around constantly 
I'm poly and in an open relation with 2 people so I literally get it all the time
And like
I'm so glad I don't have to do anything to make sure I can't get pregnant pregnancy is so so scary to me
general 2023-05-25 19:21:25 OH I meant for bi
Bi means the same its just a less semantically correct term
general 2023-05-25 19:22:00 Nah that's not how bi people use it
general 2023-05-25 19:22:38 Bi people don't exclude enby people
general 2023-05-25 19:22:45 That's dumb
general 2023-05-25 19:23:50 No? Semantically do you not know what that means lmfao
general 2023-05-25 19:24:02 It's like a words thing
general 2023-05-25 19:24:12 Like it sounds better
general 2023-05-25 19:25:22 Top right is a slur now 😔
general 2023-05-25 19:25:46 The slur for me
general 2023-05-25 19:26:25 :/
general 2023-05-25 19:27:51 Yeah 
But in that chart it's being used to refer to people like me 

And hermaphrodite used to refer to intersex people like that is considered kinda a slur now

general 2023-05-25 19:32:41 Hi I'm right here
general 2023-05-25 19:32:46 I'm both
general 2023-05-25 19:33:19 Male and female
general 2023-05-25 19:33:24 It's called being intersex
general 2023-05-25 19:33:55 By being intersex
general 2023-05-25 19:34:33 I was born intersex
general 2023-05-25 19:34:45 It's a medical thing not an identity thing
general 2023-05-25 19:35:28 I mean I think you're a dumb bigot either way but LMFAO
general 2023-05-25 19:35:35 BRO THOUGHT
general 2023-05-25 19:37:32 Now the plot twist is that I am also non binary
general 2023-05-25 19:37:42 Because gender is dumb
general 2023-05-25 19:38:52 But I don't like arguing about trans issues here its not an argument I'm winning a single mf here on
general 2023-05-25 19:40:07 Or we could get cheese to do it now
general 2023-05-25 19:40:32 Not any worse then plane crazys
general 2023-05-25 19:40:40 Plane crazys physics are just as bad
general 2023-05-25 19:40:46 Your just used to them
general 2023-05-25 19:41:33 Also flight point has a dev so like
It'll actually get updates on its physics
general 2023-05-25 19:42:07 Yus
general 2023-05-25 19:43:41 I'll Give you that I am mentally ill
Conveniently the cure for the mental illness is known

general 2023-05-25 19:44:19 Ah well see I'm mentally ill from other stuff too
general 2023-05-25 19:44:57 Working on all of those?
general 2023-05-25 19:46:11 But uh mental health issues (especially clinical depression) doesn't ever really go away so I'm  saddled with it
general 2023-05-25 19:46:17 The big sad
general 2023-05-25 19:49:06 They had me on lots of stuff from the last hospital I was in after the last time but like I'm not the best at remembering my meds
general 2023-05-25 19:54:59 I'm so done honestly

general 2023-05-26 03:43:48 K
general 2023-05-26 03:44:31 7
general 2023-05-26 03:45:51 Bruh
general 2023-05-26 03:48:53 Today is going to be so nothing
general 2023-05-26 03:50:39 Average pcc member
general 2023-05-26 03:51:04 Lol
general 2023-05-26 03:51:12 Absolutely
general 2023-05-26 03:51:49 People here dm me gore videos and death threats
general 2023-05-26 03:53:32 Jokes on yall 
Your girl is mentally ill and very desensitized to gore
general 2023-05-26 03:54:03 I'm both :/
general 2023-05-26 03:54:27 More feminine presenting tho
general 2023-05-26 03:54:58 Omfg yes
general 2023-05-26 03:55:34 What the fuck is a feminine property
general 2023-05-26 03:56:45 Like how do you expect to know how I present over text
general 2023-05-26 03:58:51 Which is fairly feminine?
Like I'm closer to a girl then a guy
general 2023-05-26 04:01:30 It's a good thing we make medications?
general 2023-05-26 04:02:08 What
general 2023-05-26 04:02:23 Antidepressants
general 2023-05-26 04:03:30 My depression is a result of my brain being unbalanced I need antidepressants 
So don't knock them
general 2023-05-26 04:04:04 That's not how that works
general 2023-05-26 04:04:24 It's literally a chemical imbalance in my brain
general 2023-05-26 04:04:39 No amount of trying would fix that
general 2023-05-26 04:04:45 Meds do fix that
general 2023-05-26 04:05:27 I didn't try to switch genders bro
general 2023-05-26 04:05:59 Clinical depression requires medication
general 2023-05-26 04:06:42 No
general 2023-05-26 04:06:56 But you do need the meds
You telling me to stop relying on meds is dangerous
general 2023-05-26 04:07:55 Well that's called somatization 
I also have that
general 2023-05-26 04:09:25 Also don't spread doubt about meds thanks
general 2023-05-26 04:10:13 That opinion would be incredibly destructive to people going through depressive episodes
general 2023-05-26 04:10:28 No your right
general 2023-05-26 04:10:50 Nobodever said they fixed everything
general 2023-05-26 04:10:58 But they are needed
general 2023-05-26 04:11:47 Ight
Well cus someone here was saying some "you should try to work it out on your own"
general 2023-05-26 04:12:29 Nah they're fine for that
Medication is generally pretty safe as long as you use it as prescribed
general 2023-05-26 04:13:46 Then your doctor changes your perscription?
general 2023-05-26 04:14:35 Nah most side effects are pretty much due to weight or body differences
general 2023-05-26 04:16:18 My meds for example continue to make me dizzy because they can't make the dosages small enough for my 100lb ass
general 2023-05-26 04:18:52 What
general 2023-05-26 04:19:15 I think some might?
general 2023-05-26 04:19:24 Different ones work differently
general 2023-05-26 04:20:17 He does that all the time 
It's really sad
Just ignore it
general 2023-05-26 04:21:55 Fr
general 2023-05-26 04:26:23 <:empty:794431705070174238>
general 2023-05-26 04:29:20 If neither of you have clinical 
Depression you don't need them?
general 2023-05-26 04:31:24 I have therapy because I stabbed myself in the chest so the mental hospital got me therapy
general 2023-05-26 04:32:43 Oh yk
general 2023-05-26 04:34:19 It did infact hurt
The knife was long enough it went in through one side of my ribs and pined down the muscles you use to breath as well as my lung and then poked into the other rib
general 2023-05-26 04:34:53 It was stupid
general 2023-05-26 04:35:20 It was a hunting knife
general 2023-05-26 04:36:25 Sorry
Anyways
No the hospital set me up with therapy after that
general 2023-05-26 04:38:41 Least informed lad identified
general 2023-05-26 04:39:04 It's very easy to call it dumb from afar
general 2023-05-26 04:39:30 But not done out of stupidity
general 2023-05-26 10:18:08 Try living in Detroit

general 2023-05-26 11:16:56 I mean true but he didn't consider himself mentally Ill
general 2023-05-26 11:17:26 Yeah it's just the larynx getting pushed out
general 2023-05-26 11:22:26 Feeling silly hours
general 2023-05-26 11:22:45 Time to be silly in the plane crazy chat

general 2023-05-26 11:37:19 I'm from 2020 but left because the server was *really* transphobic
general 2023-05-26 11:39:58 
general 2023-05-26 11:43:20 Like it's still bad now
People randomly interrupt convos to call me slurs 
But in 2020 I literally could not talk
I'd talk
A bunch of people would call me slurs tell me to shut up and leave 
A bunch more people would tell me to stop making the server political and then I'd get muted for a politics rule violation without actually having argued or said anything political
general 2023-05-26 11:44:12 My existence was political and so I wasn't allowed to talk
general 2023-05-26 11:44:19 Very not cool
general 2023-05-26 11:45:53 Yeah I wish it wasn't? I'm just trying to vibe
general 2023-05-26 11:51:05 Not all my original builds were that bad btw 
This was I think pretty good for 2020
general 2023-05-26 11:53:28 I made this account in 2019 to communicate with someone I met in a psych hospital lol
general 2023-05-26 11:56:01 Well your not supposed to share social media or anything so it had to be done on notes 
And my now significant other left me their discord in a sketchbook they let me take with me

general 2023-05-26 13:58:49 Game is lying

general 2023-05-26 14:21:41 Yall is it normal to just not be hungry for like 3 days
general 2023-05-26 14:22:36 Boycotts never work because corporations exist <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-05-26 14:24:01 F16s gonna be in Ukraine
general 2023-05-26 14:40:40 Im watching a bunch of boys trying to figure out how clothing works and it's very funny
general 2023-05-26 14:42:04 Yeah but I take time to dress myself in the morning rather then just throwing on whatever is clean
general 2023-05-26 14:42:17 Like I know every one of you mfs do
general 2023-05-26 14:42:49 Ew
general 2023-05-26 14:43:06 You sleep in your dirty clothes??
general 2023-05-26 14:43:26 Ew
general 2023-05-26 14:44:38 That's- and you're not uncomfortable in day old gross clothes?
general 2023-05-26 14:45:31 I shower twice a day and change clothes every day
general 2023-05-26 14:45:47 Stop shampooing your roots
general 2023-05-26 14:46:29 Lmfao because what do you think the oil in your hair is for
general 2023-05-26 14:47:03 Shampoo kills it
But that oil is good
So don't Shampoo your roots every time just every other couple times
general 2023-05-26 14:47:15 And then condition them
general 2023-05-26 14:47:37 And it'll make your hair softer but less noticably oily
general 2023-05-26 14:48:46 Nah but like
Clothes are so fun
general 2023-05-26 14:49:01 You all miss out
general 2023-05-26 14:49:51 Fair enough
general 2023-05-26 14:51:31 You can wear a crop top and still dress for the cold I do it all the time
general 2023-05-26 14:51:59 Bro is just bad at dressing herself
general 2023-05-26 14:53:23 You can be 40 and still wear whatever you want lol
general 2023-05-26 14:55:54 Like I wore this out into the cold
But I also wore a leather jacket over it and it still looked fine? And I was nice and warm 
You can wear stuff like that out into the cold
general 2023-05-26 14:56:40 I'm both
general 2023-05-26 14:57:47 Lmfao
general 2023-05-26 14:59:37 Nah but if you can't process me being intersex think of it like me being a girl with testosterone
general 2023-05-26 15:00:17 That's not a bypass it's just the term
general 2023-05-26 15:03:11 Pu
general 2023-05-26 15:03:23 🤭
general 2023-05-26 15:03:38 What
general 2023-05-26 15:03:55 True
general 2023-05-26 15:05:11 Yall make me wish I waited longer infront of the train
general 2023-05-26 15:05:41 🤭
general 2023-05-26 15:06:26 Bro imagine having money for a pc
general 2023-05-26 15:06:38 Oh no that continues to be funny
general 2023-05-26 15:06:45 I'm cute and I know it
general 2023-05-26 15:07:03 Why
general 2023-05-26 15:07:23 Mfs none of yall are coming to Detroit to mess with me
general 2023-05-26 15:08:40 The only thing "man like" about my face is that I have more eyebrow
Because my body makes testosterone
general 2023-05-26 15:09:57 Agreed
general 2023-05-26 15:11:23 Nah but like my face looks fine bro is being weird
general 2023-05-26 15:11:55 Nah it really does tho?
general 2023-05-26 15:12:32 How tf do you gender a face
general 2023-05-26 15:13:02 Mine aren't that masculine?
general 2023-05-26 15:13:27 I grow more facial hair that's it
general 2023-05-26 15:14:07 Then tf else do you have to go off of?
general 2023-05-26 15:14:39 But like what about it
general 2023-05-26 15:15:38 Bro biology 101 doesn't gender facial structures because both men and women can have either
general 2023-05-26 15:16:40 Okay??
general 2023-05-26 15:16:46 I didn't say one would
general 2023-05-26 15:20:56 Those are cartoons
general 2023-05-26 15:21:30 No "biology 101" would talk about them
general 2023-05-26 15:22:10 Thats not an excuse your example wasn't applicable to my argument
general 2023-05-26 15:24:19 No?
general 2023-05-26 15:26:09 K
So no it wasn't 
My argument was no anatomy or biology class would gender facial structures because men and women both could have similar facial structures 
And then you tried to argue that no because you can tell a mans face is a man and used a cartoon of a man's face to demonstrate that
general 2023-05-26 15:28:24 Who th are you
general 2023-05-26 15:28:56 Idk you just kinda showed up
general 2023-05-26 15:33:19 It flies

general 2023-05-26 16:07:36 That's not a filter bypass that's a different word
general 2023-05-26 16:08:55 Nah bro it's not even suggestive its a term reffering to gender
general 2023-05-26 16:09:27 You can't warn on the word intersex
There's no alternative for me to use
general 2023-05-26 16:09:34 And the filter doesn't block it
general 2023-05-26 16:10:20 That's fine
I'm defending the word rn
It's fine right 
I can use it
general 2023-05-26 16:11:45 Like I'm not going to get warned for filter bypass for a different non suggestive word
general 2023-05-26 16:12:31 Unbased
general 2023-05-26 16:15:45 Is it bioshock where you heal by brutally stabbing yourself
general 2023-05-26 16:16:14 It's going to be so bad

general 2023-06-01 05:34:35 I love that even tho I'm not active here I get random pings from whenever you guys want to argue about trans people
general 2023-06-01 05:36:45 He may not even know fp exists
general 2023-06-01 05:36:49 Why would he
general 2023-06-01 05:36:59 He's not active here
general 2023-06-01 05:37:09 Or in the community at all
general 2023-06-01 05:37:25 He could realistically have no idea fp exists
general 2023-06-01 05:39:10 Fr
general 2023-06-01 05:39:26 I'd just kms
general 2023-06-01 05:40:13 No
general 2023-06-01 05:40:34 Workshop is gonna make it uts own thing
general 2023-06-01 05:41:22 Imagine being scared of being new to a game again
general 2023-06-01 05:41:48 What a username
general 2023-06-01 05:43:22 Yk it's not actually that different 
You can build pretty much the same way just with stretching instead of placing blocks
general 2023-06-01 05:43:33 You don't have to use triangles
general 2023-06-01 05:45:12 No it's not even that
People here are kinda mentally ill I think
Like yall have been playing the same obscure block plane game for years
It can be scary to leave that comfort zone and no longer feel like an expert in what your doing
general 2023-06-01 05:46:11 That is nawt true
general 2023-06-01 05:46:31 Idk I like it
general 2023-06-01 05:48:50 That's being fixed
general 2023-06-01 05:48:58 The game is like
Super in development
general 2023-06-01 05:51:41 And that's just the back section
general 2023-06-01 05:51:48 No?
general 2023-06-01 05:51:55 Yep
general 2023-06-01 05:52:07 Lol
general 2023-06-01 05:52:26 MK dyno
general 2023-06-01 06:02:06 Cheese making it so you can resize beams and then not mentioning it in any of the dev logs or updates:
general 2023-06-01 20:00:54 Mm
general 2023-06-01 20:34:05 Me when gay month 💛🤍💜🖤
general 2023-06-01 21:37:02 
general 2023-06-02 15:56:22 random ass pings
general 2023-06-02 15:58:00 danm yk yall think about me more then I do
general 2023-06-02 15:59:25 my 2 partners and my aunt
general 2023-06-02 16:00:07 partners as in partners?
general 2023-06-02 16:01:02 lol I'd have to love myself for that
general 2023-06-02 17:10:47 
general 2023-06-02 17:11:31 
general 2023-06-02 17:12:20 I do nawt care
general 2023-06-02 17:12:35 True
general 2023-06-02 17:13:00 Because it's bad
Bros are challenged by the game being bad
general 2023-06-02 17:13:20 Fr
general 2023-06-02 17:13:38 Sir this is a roblox discord
general 2023-06-02 17:15:46 Lol people in this community be thinking that "well no good builds are posted because we just built as good as can be"
Nah fam it's cus all the good builds were built by basement dwelling sweats who just drop off
And the game is to small and you guys are to shitty for new players to even be interested in competing
We will never know if builds can get better because nobody but the same 6 sweats try
general 2023-06-02 17:15:57 Dead community 
No creativity
general 2023-06-02 17:18:42 BTW
This is why flightpoints workshop is important 
Because it let's new players develop on the progress of other older players
Without themselves needing to learn everything about how the game works to reach the skill of people who have played for years like in plane crazy
general 2023-06-02 17:19:07 You post builds to it
general 2023-06-02 17:19:12 Other people can download them
general 2023-06-02 17:19:38 The game makes sure to credit you
general 2023-06-02 17:20:38 That plus Whitelist means the pace of quality and also general player quality is gonna speed up a lot with flightpoint
general 2023-06-02 17:20:48 Hi
general 2023-06-02 17:22:02 Like plane crazy is bad
Play flightpoint
You don't like triangles learn to use stretched blocks
This is the direction this type of game is going and yall are on a sinking ship
general 2023-06-02 17:22:47 Yes
general 2023-06-02 17:23:00 There's a learning curve it's another game
general 2023-06-02 17:23:36 Even less with workshop
general 2023-06-02 17:23:45 You can see what the best players do
general 2023-06-02 17:24:01 Yeah because you're good at PC
A lot of people here are just anxious to be bad at a game again
general 2023-06-02 17:24:08 After spending years in this one
general 2023-06-02 17:24:23 Which is so lame omg try new things you'll be bad at first that's so obvious
general 2023-06-02 17:24:48 No fr
general 2023-06-02 17:25:03 It doesn't stay uncomfortable forever
general 2023-06-02 17:25:17 Yall I am not good at fp yet but ik for sure I will be
general 2023-06-02 17:25:21 Because others are
general 2023-06-02 17:25:34 Bro also believes in the tooth fairy
general 2023-06-02 17:26:39 Fps physics aren't actually that bad
And uh
Pc2 isn't coming out
Your on a sinking ship
general 2023-06-02 17:27:05 Nah you just gotta know what your doing
general 2023-06-02 17:27:25 MK
general 2023-06-02 17:27:32 Then like
general 2023-06-02 17:27:37 Request they be added
general 2023-06-02 17:28:13 You guys are used to stagnet dev but I've had features I suggested added now
general 2023-06-02 17:28:41 And other features I personally have asked for are planned for development now
Mostly around shipbuilding
general 2023-06-02 17:29:07 Yes there are most people build engines in their builds
general 2023-06-02 17:29:25 Also fp has a discord it's linked in the announcements of the "shut down" one
general 2023-06-02 17:29:56 WAIT
general 2023-06-02 17:30:03 Bro is building that in plane crazy
general 2023-06-02 17:30:08 Omg dude get a real game
general 2023-06-02 17:30:14 They make games for that
general 2023-06-02 17:30:22 Your playing the wrong one
general 2023-06-02 17:30:27 Ffs
general 2023-06-02 17:30:53 Literally every other vehicle sandbox
general 2023-06-02 17:31:00 Plane crazy has bad physics
general 2023-06-02 17:31:06 Especially for anything larger
general 2023-06-02 17:31:59 Probably not as bad as you think
Go to the workshop
Get someone else's plane
And fly it
The physics are fine I'd you know what your doing
general 2023-06-02 17:32:30 Lol
general 2023-06-02 17:33:56 Cheese is working on gliding for fp
The physics yall complain about as your #1 are being fixed overtime 
And weren't that bad to begin with
general 2023-06-02 17:38:28 conveyor engines for ships and submarines:
general 2023-06-02 17:40:02 try using hovers in a sub and get back to me
general 2023-06-02 17:40:49 it's great for submarines because you can crash dive
general 2023-06-02 17:41:03 they're bad for planes
general 2023-06-02 17:41:29 larger flying things like blimps or maybe some really really big bombers I can see

general 2023-06-03 19:22:35 I think originally it was like a bi flag or smth
general 2023-06-03 19:23:03 But people got mad at them for trying to stoke infighting like day 1
general 2023-06-03 19:23:45 
general 2023-06-03 19:33:32 
general 2023-06-03 19:42:38 
general 2023-06-04 03:15:01 Me when
general 2023-06-04 03:16:15 It's a biplane from the 1920s so I think a mix of both
general 2023-06-04 03:16:58 It do be goofy
general 2023-06-04 03:18:01 Flightpoint
general 2023-06-04 03:18:07 This
general 2023-06-04 03:19:14 It's different
general 2023-06-04 03:19:20 There's a big learning curve fs
general 2023-06-04 03:19:57 Like some ways it's easier
I would never be able to do this in plane crazy
general 2023-06-04 03:20:35 That red lever actually works and  turns when you open the bomb doors
general 2023-06-04 03:20:43 By far
general 2023-06-04 03:20:52 But again there is a definite learning curve
general 2023-06-04 03:21:53 But I think it's lessened now with the workshop

general 2023-06-04 08:29:21 She's not
The crate is massive 
It's Like a third of my bed in size
general 2023-06-04 08:31:42 
general 2023-06-04 08:32:10 Fr
general 2023-06-04 08:32:29 Well yk
general 2023-06-04 08:32:33 She's learning
general 2023-06-04 08:32:54 Mostly by jumping up in front when people leave the car
general 2023-06-04 08:33:02 Fs
general 2023-06-04 08:33:56 Yeah
It's been the scientific consensus for decades going to Mars is infeasible and stupid
general 2023-06-04 08:34:35 The only people who still push "man on mars" as the next step in science are elon musk types 
Not scientists just hype mongers
general 2023-06-04 08:34:55 In the sinking ship that is pc?
general 2023-06-04 08:34:59 I bet
general 2023-06-04 08:36:04 Cringe
general 2023-06-04 08:37:33 Pc2 isn't real
general 2023-06-04 08:37:57 Hot
general 2023-06-04 08:42:13 Yall this is what we rry want
general 2023-06-04 08:47:02 L
general 2023-06-04 08:48:37 Horse tho 🤤
general 2023-06-04 09:13:38 🐎🥺
general 2023-06-04 09:14:35 Yep
general 2023-06-04 09:14:40 Yep
general 2023-06-04 09:15:42 I will not relent on being a constant mindfuck
general 2023-06-04 09:16:11 Idk who that is
general 2023-06-04 20:49:26 Maybe for a smaller plane but with the bomber being as big as it is no
general 2023-06-04 20:51:49 The bomb release buttons work now too
In a pretty clever way
Basically there are 2 versions of the button one clipped into the other
The one where it's more extended just falls away and clips out of the plane
general 2023-06-04 20:52:01 But so quick that it looks like the button was just pushed
general 2023-06-07 08:18:08 Finished my first good fp build
general 2023-06-07 08:18:18 I like it
general 2023-06-07 08:20:17 It has a functional cockpit
So the control stick moves as you fly the plane
general 2023-06-07 08:39:27 It uses thrusters
general 2023-06-07 08:40:13 That's.. not how radial engines work by the interwar I don't think.. like only early planes have it where you can see the pistons through the front
general 2023-06-07 08:46:22 A caproni ca 70
general 2023-06-07 08:46:29 
general 2023-06-07 08:57:44 I did not know this 

That is incredibly cursed
general 2023-06-07 08:57:55 Yeah
general 2023-06-07 08:58:10 It's blueprints confirm this
general 2023-06-07 09:04:08 Ik the sopwith camel is like
***the*** ww1 airplane
And it is completely undeserved I have no idea how that thing stayed in one peice
general 2023-06-07 09:06:00 Also It's like objectively the most boring one
general 2023-06-07 09:06:04 It looks like an airplane
general 2023-06-07 09:06:10 Like too much
general 2023-06-07 09:09:20 Like in an Era where planes were regularly insane looking how you gonna pick the most normal looking one as your favorite
general 2023-06-07 09:54:34 The wind is still rising
general 2023-06-07 09:55:52 You'd like the other plane I'm working on
general 2023-06-07 09:56:33 Absolutely
general 2023-06-07 09:58:49 Cringe
general 2023-06-07 09:59:13 It's like a building out of ancient Rome
general 2023-06-07 10:02:20 I have the outfit
general 2023-06-07 10:02:38 I'll get around to recreating the scene if I ever finish the airplane
general 2023-06-07 10:03:22 While the Ca 70 wasn't in the wind rises
It was kinda the predecessor to the ca 73 and ca 90 that you do see in yhe movie
general 2023-06-07 10:03:39 It's caproni's night fighter
general 2023-06-07 11:20:42 Cute reskin to replicate the old ca 70 I made in plane crazy (like years ago)
general 2023-06-07 11:29:17 It's a plane from 1920s italy
general 2023-06-07 11:29:51 Yk like
Where antifa was an actual resistance group
They stole a ca 72 and used it
general 2023-06-07 11:31:22 Notice the 3 arrows on the wing? Thats Italian antifa
general 2023-06-07 14:02:28 Someone should tell them antifa isn't a buzzword and was a historical group of importance especially in Italy <:clueless:942802644043464734>
general 2023-06-08 14:30:55 
general 2023-06-08 15:00:51 They pumped me full of chemicals that turned me straight
general 2023-06-08 15:00:54 And now my arms hurt
general 2023-06-08 15:04:02 Idk a few of them
general 2023-06-08 15:04:08 I was just late on 3
general 2023-06-08 15:05:06 I didn't even ask what they were they were just like "you're due 3 shots" and then I let them stab me 😭
general 2023-06-08 15:05:45 Well no now my arm is sore
general 2023-06-08 15:06:17 They weren't covid shots I already had those
general 2023-06-08 15:06:50 I wish

general 2023-06-08 15:12:47

general 2023-06-09 13:00:13 Mhm
general 2023-06-09 13:03:27 I'm building a game shitting bomber rn and this thing has required like 4 different advancements in in game engineering
general 2023-06-09 15:47:14 
general 2023-06-09 15:50:12 
general 2023-06-09 18:27:11

general 2023-06-11 19:20:21 Uh
general 2023-06-11 19:20:23 No
general 2023-06-11 19:20:33 Kinda the other way around
general 2023-06-11 19:20:39 More then anything
general 2023-06-11 19:21:05 I'm not a boy lol
general 2023-06-11 19:22:52 Uh no
general 2023-06-11 19:23:17 I'm not "a trans" either 
Yall we have been over this
general 2023-06-11 19:26:24 I'm intersex
So my body makes testosterone
general 2023-06-11 19:26:28 Still mostly female tho
general 2023-06-11 19:26:56 Also LOL you know girls pluck their eyebrows right
general 2023-06-11 19:27:14 In.. that my body makes testosterone
general 2023-06-11 19:27:47 Oh
In that I'm female in literally every other way
general 2023-06-11 19:28:25 Uh yeah
general 2023-06-11 19:29:19 1 girls can have that
And 2 I'm intersex so my body produces testosterone meaning a lot of the male features you'd get after puberty I have
general 2023-06-11 19:30:21 I'm genetically both
general 2023-06-11 19:30:36 Yes but that's not the term used
The term is intersex
general 2023-06-11 19:30:42 No
general 2023-06-11 19:30:48 Thats a different thing
general 2023-06-11 19:31:08 I was just built different
general 2023-06-11 19:31:13 Idk
general 2023-06-11 19:31:40 I'm both tho
general 2023-06-11 19:31:45 Really mostly female
general 2023-06-11 19:32:58 No
general 2023-06-11 19:33:29 No Idk if I'm genetically both
I'm biologically both
But like I mostly present female in person and prefer that
general 2023-06-11 19:33:39 What??
general 2023-06-11 19:33:58 No I just wasn't born with one
general 2023-06-11 19:34:15 Was born with all them girl parts
general 2023-06-11 19:35:01 Probably
general 2023-06-11 19:35:21 Yeah women are the base model
All it takes is testosterone in the womb
general 2023-06-11 19:35:37 Girls are the standard human
general 2023-06-11 19:38:25 Kinda
general 2023-06-11 19:38:26 Yeah
general 2023-06-11 19:39:19 Well
No I grew other parts 
But I had surgeries to have most of them removed so NOW I am just like a bearded woman
general 2023-06-11 19:40:32 Yeah but as I said that's the wrong term it's intersex :/
general 2023-06-11 19:42:21 There was no argument wut

general 2023-06-14 11:13:14 Fp is pretty great
general 2023-06-14 11:35:09 What's wrong with the developer
general 2023-06-14 11:35:18 Also the map is better then pcs
general 2023-06-14 11:35:23 Like by far
general 2023-06-14 11:36:54 Yeah
general 2023-06-14 11:36:59 Wait
general 2023-06-14 11:37:26 Lmao is your main thing against the game that have weird personal beef with the dev

general 2023-06-14 11:37:58 Nah man everything your saying is weirdly personal
general 2023-06-14 11:38:19 Because it has nothing to do with the game
general 2023-06-14 11:38:30 Yes
general 2023-06-14 11:38:48 You hate it because of stuff that has nothing to do with it
general 2023-06-14 11:38:56 And like get a grip
general 2023-06-14 11:39:06 Also get a new insult lmao
general 2023-06-14 11:40:28 Like your issue with a game has nothing to do with the game and entirely with the dev and like
You can play fp and not interact with the dev? This is a you thing
general 2023-06-14 11:42:25 True
general 2023-06-14 11:43:05 Danm dude sorry a squeeker made a better game then this shit ass one you spend all your time on
general 2023-06-14 11:44:10 
general 2023-06-14 16:26:14 
general 2023-06-14 16:44:24

general 2023-06-15 23:39:01 
general 2023-06-15 23:41:18 yes
general 2023-06-15 23:50:43 no litterally at that scale
general 2023-06-15 23:50:55 I built the frame around a block
general 2023-06-15 23:51:25 homie the fact that it's using beams is the joke
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 00:13:52 yall know the partying was wild up in here
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 00:42:33 
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 00:42:58 ty
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 00:43:29 it's flightpoint
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 00:44:20 it is
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 00:45:28 good game
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 00:47:18 way easier
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 00:47:29 you just gotta learn it
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 00:47:38 you don't even use motor lock the same way
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 00:48:02 like in pc you use it to make more complicated shapes and details
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 00:48:12 but in fp you just use it to move parts

Yall  are goofy for insisting I'm male

general 2023-06-18 22:40:54 A troll
general 2023-06-18 22:41:08 Living under the bridge

general 2023-06-18 22:50:05 Also black and trans people were already included in the rainbow
general 2023-06-18 22:50:29 The rainbow was just good
general 2023-06-18 22:50:36 TRUE
general 2023-06-18 22:50:44 Why is that in the flag
general 2023-06-18 22:51:09 No literally the old flag looked better and was already all inclusive
general 2023-06-18 22:51:23 If you want to specifically have trans people included just fly the trans flag
general 2023-06-18 22:51:30 It also looks better then the progress one

general 2023-06-22 16:24:51 
general 2023-06-22 16:27:07 Nah it can still be implosion
general 2023-06-22 16:27:33 The "banging" was loud
general 2023-06-22 16:27:49 The sub blew up
general 2023-06-22 16:32:18 Fr

general 2023-06-22 19:15:48 L
general 2023-06-22 19:15:59 No probably not
general 2023-06-22 19:16:03 But like
general 2023-06-22 19:16:09 I'm not going to mourn them
general 2023-06-22 19:16:14 I don't know them
general 2023-06-22 19:16:38 Also
general 2023-06-22 19:17:02 There's no reason for me not too
general 2023-06-22 19:17:06 Also
general 2023-06-22 19:17:43 Diving the titanic like we do has been destructive to the wreck and oceanolgists have warned against it for decades
general 2023-06-22 19:17:53 Fuck the companies behind the submarine fr fr
general 2023-06-22 19:18:18 I never said they deserved death
general 2023-06-22 19:18:25 I'm laughing at their death
general 2023-06-22 19:18:39 Because it's funny
general 2023-06-22 19:18:57 Yep
general 2023-06-22 19:19:16 Wow i was edgy on the internet my bad bro
general 2023-06-22 19:19:43 K
general 2023-06-22 19:20:16 We were making memes about it after they died
general 2023-06-22 19:20:21 They died 3 hours ago
general 2023-06-22 19:20:30 Your all late
general 2023-06-22 19:21:13 News coverage of a dibre field started 2 hours ago
general 2023-06-22 19:21:30 
general 2023-06-22 19:22:31 And looking for wreckage was hard because of the titanic right there
general 2023-06-22 19:23:15 The banging is probably just bio interference
general 2023-06-22 19:23:18 Not them imploding
general 2023-06-22 19:23:23 Implosion is way louder
general 2023-06-22 19:23:44 Banging like that is really really common idk why they even reported it
general 2023-06-22 19:23:49 It was so dumb
general 2023-06-22 19:24:25 Here's the thing
It takes 3 hours to get down
More or less
general 2023-06-22 19:24:39 It was a bad sub
general 2023-06-22 19:24:50 And it probably blew up on the way down
general 2023-06-22 19:25:11 Nobody would have been listening for that implosion
general 2023-06-22 19:25:16 At all
general 2023-06-22 19:25:33 Also yeah the Logitech controller isn't why the sub is bad
general 2023-06-22 19:25:44 It's the lack of redundancy
general 2023-06-22 19:26:37 Nah but like when the sub went missing it was basically assumed from the srset they were dead
general 2023-06-22 19:26:56 Anyone who knew scratch about submarines knew where this was going
general 2023-06-22 19:27:49 So when I'm meming on their deaths
Understand I don't know these people
I don't care they're random rich people
And for me and anyone else who knows anything about submarines they were dead yesterday

general 2023-06-22 19:34:38 Hope to God the implosion didn't do anything to the wreck

general 2023-07-12 23:59:27 It doesn't lol
general 2023-07-12 23:59:58 Literally not trans
general 2023-07-13 00:00:13 You're making stuff up so you can call me slurs
general 2023-07-13 00:00:15 Real
general 2023-07-13 00:02:49 I don't even care it's more funny that I'm Literally just not Trans
And they have to pretend I am
general 2023-07-13 00:03:09 Like bro is goofy
general 2023-07-13 00:04:28 That's always been the case
general 2023-07-13 00:05:46 You would be in Ancient Greece getting mad at the philosophers atop the Parthenon for "not knowing what a man is" (they argued about this alot)
general 2023-07-13 00:07:31 Like I might not know what a woman is
But
You don't either
general 2023-07-13 00:07:41 Mf ancient Greece understood this
general 2023-07-13 00:13:54 Yeah they didn't know
general 2023-07-13 00:14:01 We still don't know
general 2023-07-13 00:15:24 Cool
what is a man
general 2023-07-13 00:16:04 What is a male
What is a person
general 2023-07-13 00:16:40 What if he gets it blown off
Is it no longer a man
general 2023-07-13 00:16:55 Wepp what is a woman
general 2023-07-13 00:17:46 Is that how we define men in daily life?
Also not all people you'd call men have those chromosomes
general 2023-07-13 00:18:34 Yeah
general 2023-07-13 00:19:36 You can't define man or woman in any way that includes all men and women 
So the definition isn't absolute 
Or biological 
It's something we just kind of agree too
general 2023-07-13 00:19:59 I guarantee you don't know your chromosomes
general 2023-07-13 00:20:25 I mean nothing about the definition is baser in biology
general 2023-07-13 00:20:42 No I'm suggesting it has nothing to do with it
general 2023-07-13 00:21:01 Humans aren't cars bro
general 2023-07-13 00:21:30 The analogy doesn't truck
general 2023-07-13 00:21:36 Track*
general 2023-07-13 00:21:39 We made cars
general 2023-07-13 00:21:44 We describe man and woman
general 2023-07-13 00:21:58 We can categorize one based on imperical metrics
general 2023-07-13 00:22:46 So if you get in an accident and lose your ding dong are you no longer a man
general 2023-07-13 00:23:01 What is it?
general 2023-07-13 00:24:11 Tf
general 2023-07-13 00:24:16 I didn't say anything
general 2023-07-13 00:24:21 Was it feather
general 2023-07-13 00:25:07 We don't know
I opened this by saying that we have been arguing about that Seince ancient greece
general 2023-07-13 00:25:46 No in philosophy we don't
general 2023-07-13 00:25:51 Know we know they exist
general 2023-07-13 00:26:07 But what is a human 
Define a human in a way that includes all humans
general 2023-07-13 00:26:39 You don't use biological definitions for anything my duder
general 2023-07-13 00:27:09 Do all humans have all of these things?
general 2023-07-13 00:27:17 Because I'm pretty sure you have a small brain
general 2023-07-13 00:28:09 I'm not asking shit 
Socrates asked that
I'm just repeating
general 2023-07-13 00:28:57 You wouldn't
Exactly
We all know
general 2023-07-13 00:29:20 But no definition you can form encapsulates all people
general 2023-07-13 00:29:44 So ridged definitions don't apply to things we all socially agree exist
general 2023-07-13 00:30:12 Obviously there is
general 2023-07-13 00:30:50 We don't agree people are humans baser on any riged definition
We make up what human means
general 2023-07-13 00:31:04 We do the same for gender
For species 
For everything
general 2023-07-13 00:31:32 Babies
Have small brains
are They not human?
general 2023-07-13 00:31:56 If you use that as the standard yeah
general 2023-07-13 00:32:16 Whale babies have bigger brains
general 2023-07-13 00:32:46 You guys are acting outraged by philosophy 101 and it's pretty funny
general 2023-07-13 00:33:08 Literally pigs are smarter then human babies
Babies are stupid
general 2023-07-13 00:33:34 Philosophy is science
The methods we use in science come from a base in Philosophy
general 2023-07-13 00:33:50 This wasn't the question
general 2023-07-13 00:34:25 Blud we already do 
It's the bases or science
general 2023-07-13 00:34:45 We figured out the earth was round with philosophy
general 2023-07-13 00:35:40 Do you think we figured out the earth was round in the 1500s
general 2023-07-13 00:36:09 The ancient Egyptians understood the earth had to be round but okay
general 2023-07-13 00:36:35 None of this is flawed
This is still how philosophy is taught
general 2023-07-13 00:36:58 They literally did
general 2023-07-13 00:37:16 Pythagoras was a philosopher lmao
general 2023-07-13 00:39:21 Pretty much every seafaring people understood it
You have to know the earth is round to understand how stars work 
And they did pretty solidly
general 2023-07-13 00:39:48 Yep
Science is the methodaligized version
general 2023-07-13 00:40:06 It is based on philosophy 
Nothing I said was wrong
general 2023-07-13 00:40:23 They didn't :/
This is largely a myth
general 2023-07-13 00:41:46 Yeah using math
Math is based on presumptions of philosophy 
Bro was a philosopher
general 2023-07-13 00:42:25 You're literally mad at the Socrattic method
general 2023-07-13 00:44:18 My premise is that the "objective" standard is based on subjective premises
We have to assume things for science to work
general 2023-07-13 00:44:22 Which we do
So it does
general 2023-07-13 00:45:52 Literally does
general 2023-07-13 00:46:43 A human is whatever we say it is
Easy
general 2023-07-13 00:47:49 Do we use human to describe monkey? If not its not a very useful use of the term and I'd disagree
general 2023-07-13 00:48:22 Whatever we say is a human
general 2023-07-13 00:48:40 (I don't know
Nobody else does either)
general 2023-07-13 00:48:50 So we just agree on a common definition
general 2023-07-13 00:49:09 You can't either
That's what this whole thing is about
general 2023-07-13 00:50:08 Gender works the same way dude
general 2023-07-13 00:51:14 Is a coma patient a human still?
general 2023-07-13 00:51:23 They don't possess those abilities
general 2023-07-13 00:51:51 Species is a category we made up
general 2023-07-13 00:52:11 So it doesn't tell you anything
general 2023-07-13 00:52:43 I mean no? We run into fuzzy areas with species all the time
general 2023-07-13 00:52:59 Ligers are inconsistent with species
general 2023-07-13 00:53:58 You're almost right 
It's a word with generally accepted meaning that also correlates woth biological/scientific backing
general 2023-07-13 00:54:35 Well what I just said also describes gender
general 2023-07-13 00:55:06 And if ligers can exist and not fit within species cleanly
People can exist and not fit within gender cleanly
general 2023-07-13 00:56:22 There are different things
Just like how lions and tigers are different
general 2023-07-13 00:56:43 We're right back where we started dude
general 2023-07-13 00:57:16 I didn't bring up the earth being round
general 2023-07-13 00:59:33 I'm not getting anywhere ever here
You're going to make a point and then some idiot is gonna go "yeah only 2 genders assigned at birth" really loud 

Having never questioned that
general 2023-07-13 00:59:54 Literally I only argue here because I like arguing
general 2023-07-13 01:00:34 Like I'm right but I'm not going to convince ***you guys*** of that
general 2023-07-13 01:00:51 Yes
general 2023-07-13 01:02:27 Danm it'd be crazy if some people were put in between the 1 and 2 things
general 2023-07-13 01:02:47 Also sorry discord is breaking hard rn for me

And about 7 after getting deep enough
general 2023-07-13 23:42:49 I've only dived deep enough to hit 7 minutes a few times tho
general 2023-07-13 23:43:36 Yall keep saying you want me to die bro I'm way ahead of you stop copying me
general 2023-07-13 23:44:20 I wanted me to die first smh
general 2023-07-13 23:45:19 I'm fuckin working on it
general 2023-07-13 23:45:33 People don't like letting you die for some reason
general 2023-07-13 23:45:37 Very cringe
general 2023-07-13 23:46:17 FR
general 2023-07-13 23:46:54 Lmao
general 2023-07-13 23:47:34 Chicken is so gross
But also like the most humane sustainable meat we produce and it's bs
general 2023-07-13 23:48:20 No okay to be clear
There are ways you can cook chicken to be good 
But it's like never done in American food
So it's gross
general 2023-07-13 23:48:35 Boiled chicken is nasty
general 2023-07-13 23:48:44 Fried chicken is also gross
general 2023-07-13 23:49:03 I have I don't like kfc
general 2023-07-13 23:49:22 I never said it did??(
general 2023-07-13 23:49:37 No I didnt
general 2023-07-13 23:50:07 I just said I think it was gross but that it's superior to beef in every other way
Which was my opinion lmao
general 2023-07-13 23:50:25 I don't like chicken
People should probably eat more chicken tho because it's the better food
general 2023-07-13 23:51:17 Beef is so not
It tastes amazing
I love me some beef
But farming beef is so inefficient compared to chicken
general 2023-07-13 23:52:30 Like 

Pork is fucked up because pigs are smarter then 5 year old infants
And cows are just really inefficient to farm

Fish are also unsustainable to farm and transport
general 2023-07-13 23:52:46 But pork and beef are so yummy
general 2023-07-13 23:53:00 Fr
general 2023-07-13 23:53:07 Salmon goes hard af
general 2023-07-13 23:53:20 Wait no we can fish lobster sustainably
general 2023-07-13 23:53:32 Dog I am not a vegan i eat all those things
general 2023-07-13 23:53:51 Yeah?
general 2023-07-13 23:54:22 Lobster populations are sustainably fished rn

They're only going down because we overfish OTHER fish
general 2023-07-13 23:54:28 And the ecosystem is damaged
general 2023-07-13 23:54:58 Lobster is yummy
general 2023-07-13 23:56:03 Guys fishing is like
So bad
Like 
The ocean is filling with jellyfish because we kill all the fish that eat them and there is no way to kill them
general 2023-07-13 23:56:34 So you've said
general 2023-07-13 23:56:46 Do you ever get tired of repeating yourself?
