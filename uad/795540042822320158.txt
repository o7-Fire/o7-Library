plane-crazy 2022-08-06 16:01:02 <@619312093962829849> Why does my motor 2 break ask soon as a loose block gets onto it
plane-crazy 2022-08-06 16:01:52 Is there a fix? Or should i just use motor 1s
plane-crazy 2022-08-06 16:02:57 Fair enough

plane-crazy 2022-08-12 17:31:00 If you mean make it turn by moving ur mouse, put a motor 2 with wing panels / delta wings
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 17:41:55 Add white list üôè
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 01:44:27 Smash
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 01:45:17 Anybody have solutions to motor 2 jamming when loose blocks are placed

plane-crazy 2022-09-10 02:07:51 And he said give me a goddamn minute

plane-crazy 2022-09-13 02:06:29 Anybody got any fixes to motor jamming
plane-crazy 2022-09-13 02:42:56 No like using motor 2 to move a explosive ball cannon. For some reason any loose pvp block cant be lifted by motor 2‚Äôs
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 17:35:32 Railway cannon
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 17:35:48 One time i made a railway car that shot out at like 2000 speed
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 17:36:01 The car didnt have any boosters
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 17:36:24 I used like 10 wheel shooters and wacky glitches
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 17:40:09 No
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 17:40:23 Magnet cant go that fast
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 17:41:05 I refrain from using magnets as it messes up driving and mechanics and its really messy
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 19:01:10 Motor lock only bring blocks half a block in, which is why you need 2 you need to connect them to some other place to the middle
plane-crazy 2022-10-20 19:01:14 Its really hard to explain
plane-crazy 2022-11-02 16:01:29 Any fix to motors jamming? I cant build a aimable tnt cannon.

plane-crazy 2022-12-02 17:08:06 He isnt supposed to announce it
plane-crazy 2022-12-02 17:08:34 This could be a joke too
plane-crazy 2022-12-02 17:08:36 Who knows
plane-crazy 2022-12-02 17:08:45 I could be lying i could be telling the truth
