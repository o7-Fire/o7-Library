general 2020-05-20 20:12:57 How do I make a suggestion?
general 2020-05-20 20:13:03 Oh thanks fam

general 2020-05-20 20:14:38 Damnit
general 2020-05-20 20:14:52 Wanted to suggest ball socket Motor 2's but cant.
general 2020-05-20 20:15:01 God help me if I try to do any one of those ranks
general 2020-05-21 02:00:50 If someones in a pilot seat, can they take control of the aircraft?
general 2020-05-21 02:01:00 Or if its a twin fuselage, could I release controls over to them?
general 2020-05-21 02:07:55 I need an answer please lads
general 2020-05-21 02:08:07 I just built a F82 and need to know if the co-pilot is just for show
general 2020-05-21 02:26:07 Also is there word of a ball socket motor 2?
general 2020-05-21 02:26:12 Cause that would be hella
general 2020-05-21 02:26:22 Useful for small tail gunner
general 2020-05-21 02:26:54 Like, a ball motor
general 2020-05-21 02:27:04 Powered.
general 2020-05-21 02:27:11 Like the motor 2 it can track your mouse
general 2020-05-21 02:27:14 Yeah
general 2020-05-21 02:27:20 You know what a ball socket is, right?
general 2020-05-21 02:27:30 Its a motor version
general 2020-05-21 02:27:36 I was getting to that
general 2020-05-21 02:27:43 Its for small tail gunners and gunships
general 2020-05-21 02:27:49 It would be a whole hell of a lot easier
general 2020-05-21 02:27:56 Especially tail gunners
general 2020-05-21 02:28:11 Because on a bomber you dont want a massive ooga booga 2 motor setup
general 2020-05-21 02:28:31 What?
general 2020-05-21 02:28:59 I could tell, but what do you mean by motor lock engineering?
general 2020-05-21 02:29:06 How does that help?
general 2020-05-21 02:29:57 Yeah but a ball socket motor would still be really handy
general 2020-05-21 02:31:16 Either way I still think it would be neat
general 2020-05-21 03:05:02 Whats the pilot seat even for?
general 2020-05-21 03:05:09 I cant seem to find something it can control
general 2020-05-21 03:06:28 I did
general 2020-05-21 03:06:39 I sat in the seat in some lads plane who needed a gunner
general 2020-05-21 03:06:42 And It didnt control anything
general 2020-05-21 03:07:01 Is it just a blue seat with a cool name?
general 2020-05-21 03:07:02 Or?
general 2020-05-21 03:08:43 Why have 2 seats then?
general 2020-05-21 03:08:51 If only the builder can use it, why have 2 seats?
general 2020-05-21 03:09:04 I cant be the only one seeing this, right?
general 2020-05-21 03:24:50 So theres no use for a pilot seat if you arent a builder?
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 16:11:10 I believe AMRAAM are anti-radar so they only lock onto planes with an active radar system

plane-crazy 2020-05-21 16:14:45 Droop
plane-crazy 2020-05-21 21:49:43 konigstiger be like
general 2020-05-24 02:48:29 We ever gonna get jets with afterburners?
general 2020-05-24 02:49:22 Actually, yeah
general 2020-05-24 02:49:29 Take a jet, slap a hidden rocket behind it
general 2020-05-26 01:10:43 Where are the landing skis?
general 2020-05-30 07:05:20 Lemme guess, nobody has made a bomb sight yet?
general 2020-05-30 07:07:03 Better question, is there a block affected by altitude and speed?
general 2020-05-30 07:10:28 So, what is it?
general 2020-05-30 07:11:57 How could I use them to form a sort of sight with a camera?
general 2020-05-30 07:12:17 I have some ideas.
general 2020-05-30 07:14:59 Yeah but dive bombing sights are easy because the bomb doesn’t get flung very far forward
general 2020-05-30 07:19:51 Damn
general 2020-05-30 07:19:58 I did see something about a camera guided bomb
general 2020-05-30 07:20:32 I don’t know
general 2020-05-30 07:20:39 It was in creations when I looked up sight
general 2020-05-30 07:22:27 That’s a guided missile
general 2020-05-30 07:22:35 Yeah
general 2020-05-30 07:22:45 Oh yeah
general 2020-05-30 07:22:57 Why tf would you put a camera on a rocket
general 2020-05-30 07:23:01 I know that
general 2020-05-30 07:23:04 I’ve built em before
general 2020-05-30 07:23:19 I just wanna bomb accurately without making a parachute bomb because god I hate those
general 2020-05-30 07:24:18 It kinda is when your at 1400 meters in a B17
general 2020-05-30 07:24:46 Cause if you fly below that flak or some lobotomite with a turret slathered in rockets that barely turns shoots you down
general 2020-05-30 07:25:07 But then there’s nobody to bomb
general 2020-05-30 07:26:05 I do but basically none of them play plane crazy
general 2020-05-30 07:26:16 I may just slap a few control surfaces on it and call it a day
general 2020-05-30 07:26:30 I literally just said none of my friends play plane crazy
general 2020-05-30 07:29:15 I may just slap control surfaces on the bomb to control it just by using falling speed as it’s main accelerator
general 2020-05-30 07:32:15 Mine is a bit, eh
general 2020-05-30 07:32:22 It’s not pretty but it works
general 2020-05-30 07:32:50 How do I make a suggestion?
general 2020-05-30 07:32:55 God damnit

bot-central 2020-05-30 07:33:16 ?rhelp
general 2020-05-30 07:36:45 I’ll try to send a pic of my B17 tomorrow,
general 2020-05-30 07:36:51 It’s kinda ugly but it works.
general 2020-05-30 07:37:00 I’m about to go to sleep
general 2020-05-30 07:37:34 
general 2020-05-30 07:38:39 I can’t for the love of me get propellers to work
general 2020-05-30 07:38:44 *blades
general 2020-05-30 07:38:51 They are too slow
general 2020-05-30 07:39:26 Wdym more motors?
general 2020-05-30 07:39:31 Like, stacked motors?
general 2020-05-30 07:40:22 I thought I could stack them unless they are locked
general 2020-05-30 07:42:34 How do I stack?
general 2020-05-30 07:43:05 What’s the same orientation, the motors?
general 2020-05-30 19:56:55 https://gyazo.com/e8769ac3cf7f8466e975fd40e2532b51 Remodeled my B17 as a tribute to Ye Olde Pub
general 2020-05-30 19:57:11 Far from finished, and already looks better than my old one
general 2020-05-30 19:57:20 (Mostly because of the tail section)
general 2020-05-30 19:59:56 And thanks Vip for the stacked motor suggestion.
general 2020-05-30 20:00:05 Hoping that will get my bird off the ground and steady.
general 2020-05-30 20:01:17 Thoughts/
general 2020-05-30 20:01:19 *?
general 2020-05-30 20:02:56 Yeah, roblox censored Pub
general 2020-05-30 20:03:52 I know
general 2020-05-30 20:03:57 Just kinda sucks
general 2020-05-30 20:05:45 I even put the name in the right spot
general 2020-05-30 20:05:57 
general 2020-05-30 20:06:10 Above and below the left cheek turret.
general 2020-05-30 20:08:14 I believe there was also one on the right cheek turret.
general 2020-05-30 20:08:39 Yeah
general 2020-05-30 20:09:40 The story of Ye Olde Pub is that after being ravaged by flak fire, enemy planes, and losing 2 engines, a Bf 109 was about to kill it.
general 2020-05-30 20:09:50 It didnt, because the pilot felt it wasnt honorable
general 2020-05-30 20:10:08 So he escorted the B17 over the atlantic wall and back to england before waving off and heading back home.
general 2020-05-30 20:10:27 The Bf 109 was piloted by Franz Stigler, and the B17 was Charlie Brown.
general 2020-05-30 20:10:40 They met in the 90s, and I believe both died in 2008
general 2020-05-30 20:17:46 Yep.
general 2020-05-30 20:37:49 For the walkway inside the bomb bay, I used cutters as the walkway, and half wedge downs instead of normal half blocks for the bomb bay edges
general 2020-05-30 20:37:54 Im not sure how to describe it
general 2020-05-30 20:44:38 All im saying is the doors are still flush and open in 2
general 2020-05-30 20:50:27 Screwed up the ticket for AERONAUTICAL ENGINEER [IV]

general 2020-05-30 21:22:57 Anyone notice the amount of sirenhead builds recentley?
general 2020-05-30 21:23:57 Put a phallic shape on it
general 2020-05-30 21:23:59 He wont build it
general 2020-05-30 22:19:50 If I build wings out of b locks instead of panels with it still provide lift?

general 2020-05-30 22:51:43 They really spent all that time trying to kill the bismarck with boats and planes when they could have used tanks
general 2020-05-30 22:52:36 Not if you dont try hard enough
general 2020-05-30 22:52:58 Just put a few shermans on a small ship and drive by the bismarck

general 2020-05-31 01:24:51 Why?
general 2020-05-31 03:32:49 I was tearing down my B17 to see what caused to lean left heavily, and when I got near the end of its dissection, the center of mass was outside the building zone
general 2020-05-31 03:32:50 Wtf?
general 2020-05-31 03:34:26 Is this a known glitch or?
general 2020-05-31 03:34:44 No
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 03:35:47 My plane kept leaning left, and when I did a teardown to figure out why, the center of mass was out of the box and to the left
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 03:35:50 Is this a common thing/
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 03:35:51 *?
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 03:36:01 Can I fix it without completely rebuilding the B17?
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 03:56:54 Can someone answer me?
general 2020-05-31 04:00:13 Good question
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:10:12 god damnit
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:10:19 Already tried that
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:11:30 Already tried that
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:12:18 Didnt work
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:12:33 Ive tried literally everything, im moreso confused as to why my center of mass is outside the building zone

plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:15:12 It yaws left
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:15:41 Already did that
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:15:48 This never happened before.
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:15:59 Ive rearranged the props a bunch.
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:16:01 I did that
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:16:18 Alright give me a minute
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:16:22 Im playing war thunder
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:17:20 I had to record that before getting into a war thunder match

plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:31:26 Done
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:36:22 I spent so much time on that b17
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:36:28 only to find out its broken
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:36:29 cause
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:36:31 you know
plane-crazy 2020-05-31 04:36:38 unholy center of mass

plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:01:47 Theres a mega problem with plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:06:25 Who tf has 20k members to dislike a group?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:06:40 Eltorks SCPF may have been the culprit
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:09:26 I did
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:09:31 Im just confused as to who did it
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:34:57 Thats a sin.
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:37:06 Im in love with the B18
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:37:12 
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:37:17 Such a tall boye
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:38:18 I even designed a bomb bay for it that works like the real one
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:38:19 https://gyazo.com/a0b4ae5ce9e7f5d9e4a480c240c37500
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:41:35 Maybe.
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:41:40 I dont do jets though
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 02:41:46 I do ww2 stuff.
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:09:18 I finished by B-18A "Bolo"

plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:09:25 https://gyazo.com/7f7c1acd22824496240515386f121dc8
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:09:30 Completely prop driven.
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:09:44 No hidden propellors, just stacked motors and a dual custom prop setup
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:11:04 Im really happy with how it turned out
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:11:08 https://gyazo.com/5ed59538e105d8922de970a9c6bbad23
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:11:12 The dorsal and belly gunners work
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:12:38 And the bomb bay is a custom, different kind of 2 door
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:12:59 Unlike most bomb bays, the B-18A (And B34 as well as a few others) Had a 2 stage door system
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:13:09 They were also placed a lot farther back
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:13:52 https://gyazo.com/bc377dc36b8a146f4ca3729ad5f6a000

plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:14:34 949 Block count, no helium
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:14:46 I was suprised to find that it actually wants to pitch up
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:14:56 So I had to use 2 10 density ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:15:08 Each engine nacelle has 5, 50 speed same rotating motors
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:15:57 The right engine spins clockwise with clockwise propellors, but the left engine spins counter clockwise with counter clockwise propellors. This counteracts the torque that would naturally make it drift right or left
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:16:17 My B17 still has the glitch wherein the center of mass is outside the build zone, but Im hoping rick can help me fix it.

plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:49:11 Eh, I think they understand
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:49:17 What do you guys think?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:51:25 They censored second
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:51:29 But is it good or bad?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:51:33 The plane I mean
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:51:59 What do you mean hide the ss?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:52:08 No no no no
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:52:16 The SS were the ones who found people hiding
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:52:51 Eh
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 05:53:15 But what do you think of the plane itself?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:07:02 I already did a XP-82, Spitfire, B17, and a B18A.
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:07:06 What should I build now?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:07:31 I was thinking a B-25 Mitchell
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:08:06 This?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:09:25 This lad?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:09:38 Alright.
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:12:29 Can someone tell me what angle the 1x4 delta wing is at?
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:14:35 Thanks
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:17:08 https://gyazo.com/6d1b6c1ff87043d4deadf2e7d5f5c0bc
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:17:18 Theres how the wings will look.
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:17:24 Well, not really
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 19:17:37 Just a demonstration showing how it works
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 19:35:59 If I place a guided middle inside a bomb bay, will the control surfaces still have an effect on the plane?
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 01:06:36 What if we had a massive group project wherein we constructed a bridge connecting the dock to the lunar area
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 01:06:43 Im not sure if it would work
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 01:07:20 Do magnets stick to other peoples magnets?
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 01:07:31 Then how would we connect and dock it?
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 01:08:05 How would those work?
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 01:10:17 Ngl I kinda want to make a landing craft
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 16:59:38 I hate the god damn apes who use the snakes and camp spawns
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 17:00:47 The thinks that fly everywhere and either are explosive or covered in cutters
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 17:00:54 Im assuming thats a shredder bug
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 17:03:18 <:jonahs1Nervous:706974921711943691> im gonna shit my pants
creations-chat 2020-06-22 07:49:05 Where can I find the firework cannon?
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:03:34 I’ve just now realized how useful flares can be
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:04:02 That can stop tracking rockets from tracking you and going straight for the flare instead
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:04:25 With manual guided missiles your still fucked
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:04:28 I know that
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:04:39 But I haven’t realized how useful they could be in game
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:04:50 Because of the fact there are pre built autonomous tracking missiles
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:04:54 No
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:04:58 But you can make them
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:06:11 Disconnectors, red lights, smoke
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:06:17 There are tutorials
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:09:35 Not player guided ones
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:09:46 Because you don’t see a flare and go wooga booga
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:09:51 But close tracking rockets
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:10:00 If it’s hot on your ass and you fire one
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:10:19 It should theoretically get closer to the tracking area for the rocket than the plane itself
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:10:31 Then it would just kinda shoot off in a direction of kill the flare
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:11:47 Not smoke attracting people
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:11:53 The blocks themselves
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:12:05 You could make flares without smoke and have them still work
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:12:09 It’s just a cool factor thing
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:13:56 You could cover a massive plane in them
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:14:02 And just bitch slap missles
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:14:36 Water jet engine
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:15:43 Gimme sonar block
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:15:54 With a little GUI on your screen
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:16:35 I mean, your ranked
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:16:38 So go suggest it
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:17:44 If simpler games can have it work, I think the lads in development could get it to work
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:18:03 Or just have a massive fucking arm that is on a motor that swivels back and forth and if it stops moving you hit something
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:18:12 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:18:18 That would be nice to not have that happen
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:19:09 Right now I’m trying to design a massive net you can place on the back of a warship
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:19:14 When released, it floats behind
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:19:23 That way if an enemy sub is chasing you they get tangled and slowed down
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:19:30 Or it’s a trap
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:19:46 When you see the top buoys start to jiggle and dive under you’ve found your target
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:20:08 Do you mind showing me?
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:20:20 It pushes people lighso
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:20:51 I meant the ship itself
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:20:58 That sounds really fucking cool
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 16:21:16 Yeah but why have “legitimate” options when I can just be an asshole and catch them in nets
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 21:26:00 I have yet to figure out magnets
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 21:26:09 Someone mind helping me on that one?
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 21:26:55 Idk
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 21:28:27 nvm
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 21:28:29 figured it out
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 21:35:51 nevermind
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 21:35:54 how to they work
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:33:39 Do you ever just make a massive ship
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:33:52 And you get that warm feeling when you can stand on the port and starboard side without it tipping
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:33:57 Just because of the shear weight
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:34:05 Or that you dont even need ballast blocks to assist
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:34:16 Also, do the propellor blades work underwater too?
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:37:36 Time for a twelve motor setup just to get this beast of a dreadnought moving
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:40:22 If I have enough blocks, im double layering the hull.
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:40:30 Just to make this thing able to tank shots
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:40:45 Do rockets set off explosives?
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:45:11 Do materials have an effect on strength?
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:45:16 Like, is metal stronger than wood?
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:58:29 Not even a full 2/3 of the way done and its 1500 blocks.
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:59:03 Guessing 3000-3500+ block count when finished.
plane-crazy 2020-06-23 23:59:11 Even when Im using beams
plane-crazy 2020-06-24 00:24:47 I still want to do that massive multi player bridge across the lake.
the-dump 2020-06-25 16:54:24 
the-dump 2020-06-25 16:58:04 no hes just very hungry
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 00:56:12 Any suggestions for getting a massive behemoth of a ship to turn faster?
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 00:56:28 I have 2 rudders, hidden water propellors, rockets, everything
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:04:47 I need a boat guy
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:05:06 I need a lad to answer a big boat question
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:05:30 I got this proper phat dreadnought
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:05:38 It goes at about 20 knots which I’m fine with
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:05:53 But even with hidden propellers, rockets, 2 external rudders, the turning is shit
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:06:11 I am
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:06:23 It’s about 3780 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:06:27 I’ve tried that
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:06:35 It’s a big boy
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:06:49 Like a proper ass clapper of a dreadnought
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:06:54 I see someone and they get nae naed
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:07:06 I’m working on deck mounted torpedo tubes for it aswell
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:07:38 It’s a mix of German and British dreadnought designs
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:07:50 The hull looks very similar to that of the RN dreadnought
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:08:03 But it’s a German dreadnought with a German naval jack flag
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:08:45 10 rocket deck guns, 2 per turret for a total of 4 turrets
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:09:09 Used to have secondary guns embedded in the hull but got rid of them to allow the building of anti air
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:09:17 Because planes are the big weakness right now
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:10:35 It doesn’t help that my big brain added a second layer to the inside of the hull to allow it to tank explosives and torpedoes
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:10:48 So now the turning blows mega
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:13:22 I wanna turn, not do the kaiser funky and go flying
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:13:41 I should add hover engines to it on the bottom
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:13:45 The Flying Dutchman
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:13:57 But with 405mm guns
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:14:09 You gonna learn today spongebob
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:15:16 Can I still get the submarine commander role?
plane-crazy 2020-06-26 18:15:31 Cause I have a midget sub

plane-crazy 2020-06-28 02:11:51 Should I do a standard wooden deck or a prussian steel deck?

plane-crazy 2020-06-28 02:33:00 Cant
creations-chat 2020-06-28 05:57:20 Flares kinda work
creations-chat 2020-06-28 05:57:28 For rockets with close tracking on
creations-chat 2020-06-28 05:57:33 Not man guided missles
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 06:08:32 if its not guided
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 06:08:36 it’s a rocket
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 06:08:42 if it’s guided
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 06:08:45 it’s a missle
plane-crazy 2020-06-29 05:23:54 I bet he thinks the front wings control pitch
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 19:37:08 How do zeppelins manage to rise and lower?
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 19:37:18 Ive tried using helium and ballast tanks, but it doesnt work.
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 19:37:49 I was hoping it would have something to do ballast.
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 19:37:53 Alrighty then.
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 19:38:12 I was hoping that wouldnt be the case
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 19:38:49 please rick man ice cone
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 19:38:53 i beg
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 20:15:57 zeppelin with a shit ton of bombs coming soon to a theatre near you
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 19:26:37 Has anyone figured out a decent targeting system?
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 19:27:40 yes
plane-crazy 2020-08-19 19:27:45 I will do this
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 04:18:45 Is there a ground effect in this game? And no I dont mean using hover thrusters.

plane-crazy 2020-09-12 04:14:18 I am angry
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 05:36:49 So, the firework cannot be obtained, right?
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 05:37:16 I hope so.
plane-crazy 2020-09-12 06:27:25 Really liked <@456226577798135808> 's Geschützewagen Tiger so I thought id make my own, but i loved the gun design so decided to use it

plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:44:56 Oh.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:45:02 Thats actually kinda cool
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:46:11 TNT armor would be good and effective Schürzen

plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:50:42 <@!392778761701031947>
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:50:52 Shit.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:50:53 Its shit.
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:51:05 Is it explosives?
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:52:32 So its like a leopard if it was just armed with nothing but ditch posts
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:53:44 Engine
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:53:46 Thats how
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:54:13 Stacked motors
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:54:25 Enough space on the inside to spin freely
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:55:20 Take a motor
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:55:24 Put it on another one
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:55:35 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:55:56 If they both rotate in the same direction and are both set to the same speed it doubles it
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:56:06 Then triples
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:56:08 Quadruples
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:56:10 Quintuples
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:56:12 Etc
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:56:53 No
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:57:32 Add motors, adjust motor speeds to your needs
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:57:47 They look cool as fuck
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:57:49 Also speed
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:58:04 Also cooler engine nacelles
plane-crazy 2020-09-16 23:58:22 Yeah but some of us dont like using hidden engines like that

creations-chat 2020-10-07 04:06:29 Like the motor controlling elevation adjustment
creations-chat 2020-10-07 04:07:33 The guns side to side movement is usually controlled by movement of the turret or the gun itself if it’s a case mate, that is called traverse
creations-chat 2020-10-07 04:07:51 The pitch of the gun, the up and down, is the elevation.

plane-crazy 2020-10-10 01:05:00 yeah but i was gonna make a howitzer that utilizes the explosive force to propel a shell
plane-crazy 2020-10-10 01:05:12 but if thats the only way for it to work then I will use it

plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:20:48 i used motor lock for my tank turret
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:20:55 it doesnt traverse anymore
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:21:00 every block is ice
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:21:06 cranked the hell out of torque
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:21:56 i used a motor with motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:21:58 the second i add it
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:22:02 it doesnt traverse
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:22:04 without it its fine
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:22:11 i think its a friction problem
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:24:36 the motor 2 rotates a okay without the motor locks
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 04:24:49 but the second i add the motor with lock it just go brrr

plane-crazy 2020-11-06 16:52:53 but does anyone know why thats happening or nah
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 16:53:06 cause the gun itself isnt clipping with the half blocks on turns
plane-crazy 2020-11-06 16:53:42 then how come i just need to rotate back a single degree then it works again

plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:39:04 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:39:09 my missles keep shaking
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:39:11 they never do this
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:39:47 anyone know how to prevent missle shake?
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:40:13 only happens when it is propulsed
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:41:04 please man i just wanna make my missles stop shaking
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:41:19 Ill record to demonstrate
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:41:33 I think it has something to do with it being a big build?
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:42:04 nvm
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:42:06 fixed it
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:42:14 just gotta anchor it before firing
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:42:22 alright, time for an underwater test
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:43:45 Well that isnt the case considering the same missle design (when i mean same i mean literally identical) never does this.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:43:55 But I found out it was because it wasnt anchored for some reason.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:44:17 As to how it does i dont know but it does.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:44:46 jesus man 18 missles
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:48:31 nope
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:48:34 still fuckin broken
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:52:54 compressing vid to send
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:54:45 its not a plane
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:54:47 its a missle
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:55:05 if i do slow down
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:55:10 i glide down like a bomb
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:55:11 problem solved
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:55:19 second i kick on the engine i go WOOWOOWOOWOOWOOWO
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:56:15 i use super rocket engines on this one
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:56:17 BUT
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:56:30 the same design with a normal engine does the same thing if its big.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:57:50 
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:59:03 ive explained tihs
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:59:11 on the same design with a normal rocket engine
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:59:30 it did it
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 06:59:42 im not?
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:00:02 so
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:00:04 slow it down?
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:00:59 Doesnt fix it
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:01:06 slowing down i mean

plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:02:18 you there bud?
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:02:51 its as short as it gets
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:04:15 gonna try wider turn
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:05:50 Wider turn helped a lot.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:05:58 Still happens a bit but I just gotta practice control.
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:07:36 why
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:07:40 whats wrong
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:07:41 oh

plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:12:13 didnt fix it nvm
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 07:12:20 wider turn did nothing
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 22:55:51 <@!311638025308209154> remember the wobbling thing
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 22:56:04 i took one of my missles and gave it stagnant wings
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 22:56:09 turned it into a rocket
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 22:56:11 still happened
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 23:03:46 nvm fixed
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 23:03:48 thank the lord
plane-crazy 2020-11-16 08:30:11 I have an unhealthy addiction to this game
plane-crazy 2020-11-17 05:11:07 really hate the whole exploding and doing nothing to planes because the explosion happens a bit later than when you press the button to detonate and the plane flies away completely unharmed despite you trying to obliterate it with a missle

plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:32:24 that is so poorly motor locked its hideous
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:36:51 just because im outranked doesnt mean i cannot criticize
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:38:53 want me to give you a medal or somethin?
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:39:14 the problem is the turret is so hollow, and the motors are almost entirely exposed
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:39:18 It looks like a scaffold turret
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:39:33 A much more solid turret with very little gaps would be much better
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:40:06 One shot with a single bullet and I guarantee in the right spot the turret is just gonna explode
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:40:34 Problem is it doesnt
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:41:01 Looks like a k'nex set
plane-crazy 2020-11-21 06:41:35 what?
creations-chat 2020-11-23 20:21:56 Why is there motor lock in the front

plane-crazy 2020-11-27 00:18:08 Wee bit large, if there was no horizontal suspension it could work
plane-crazy 2020-11-27 00:18:29 In the picture

plane-crazy 2020-12-04 01:52:42 how can i induce suction upon another persons build
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 01:53:05 i want to make an underwater lamprey that latches onto ships and subs and extends a spinning cutter to slowly eat away at them before swimming away
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 01:53:43 thats what im trying to figure out
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 01:54:27 maybe just shear force?
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 01:54:34 i mean you can exactly push aside a ship easily
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 01:54:43 but i could use a super rocket to just aim and stay attached
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 01:54:53 im worried this is just gonna be an underwater shredder
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 01:55:04 well no because it travels slowly and acts more like a fish
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 01:55:34 honestly i just wanna make a lamprey
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 01:56:16 does anyone know how to attach to other builds
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 01:56:24 aside from docking ports n stuff
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 01:57:44 also these little devil worshippers are lampreys

plane-crazy 2020-12-06 19:37:12 i just need something that has the level of fine precision that a motor has with the ability to limit its angle
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 19:37:18 also i will remember that

plane-crazy 2020-12-14 01:27:44 Ive seen helicopter blades with propellor blades turned 90 degrees from the others, some vertical, then some horizontal. Is there a benefit to this?
plane-crazy 2020-12-14 01:31:25 yeah
creations-chat 2020-12-14 17:51:03 I’m not sure how they work in plane crazy but in real life it’s basically a fixed bar of steel at one end connected to the suspension arm with a wheel on a tank. It uses torsion (twisting) to create more resistance as you push it upwards, which means it is an effective, simple, and cheap form of suspension
creations-chat 2020-12-14 17:53:11 Big brian
creations-chat 2020-12-14 17:56:41 It’s welded to the hull at one end and poking through a hole on the other end just enough for it to be attached to a suspension arm on a tank
creations-chat 2020-12-14 17:59:08 Exactly, which is why I’m not sure how they work. Maybe using low torque motors?
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:49:32 unfinished apache, dual blade because fuck you
plane-crazy 2020-12-15 00:49:39 front nose camera design isnt mine

plane-crazy 2020-12-17 19:43:51 they arent very effective
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 19:44:02 for ground support its useless
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 19:44:08 chances of hitting are pretty low
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 19:44:23 they have splash damage?
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 19:44:49 i do configure it
plane-crazy 2020-12-17 19:44:54 its just very close range even at max

plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:18:00 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:18:21 If it’s a light enough heli, a single block gone could take it out of the fight
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:18:39 The bigger it is the more damage you can take
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:19:01 Not gonna because guess what we’re talking about you fighting a ground vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:19:08 Dumbass

plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:21:00 Your an edgy piece of shit with nothing left to do aside from argue here
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:21:16 You act as if your some design Jesus when in reality you can’t accept truth
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:21:37 This has been an argument
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:21:48 Do you not know what an argument is
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:22:03 Me and you have been going back and forth on whether you can easily be shot down or not
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:22:11 The fuckin definition does
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:22:18 Attacking is not apart of arguments
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:22:45 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:22:59 That’s not what I said
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:23:13 I said attacking isn’t apart of the definition of an argument
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:23:25 And I’m telling you that yes, you can
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:23:38 You have a chimp brain
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:23:43 I cannot believe how idiotic you are
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:24:07 Your telling me I’m denying facts when you refuse to accept you are arguing with me AND completely misread and still refuse to understand what I had said

plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:26:59 I’ve never seen someone cherry pick evidence this hard
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:27:30 There are multiple definitions for different scenarios otherwise why would there be two definitions

plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:28:24 and? We were arguing over a plane crazy topic
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:28:31 Of whether or not it’s easy to shoot down helicopters
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:29:08 Unfortunately this chimp brain thinks a helicopter traveling at 500 SPS is difficult to shoot down
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:29:14 And doesn’t know what an argument is
plane-crazy 2021-01-01 10:29:21 Or how multiple definitions work

creations-chat 2021-04-23 19:58:42 water isnt wet or dry, it exists in a state between the two.

the definition of dry is "free from moisture or liquid; not wet or moist."
the definition of wet is "covered or saturated with water or another liquid."

water cannot cover itself or be saturated in itself, thats like saying a hunk of milled aluminum is saturated with aluminum.

by the layman's definition of wet, the object had to be originally dry or partially dry.
if you jump in the pool and are completely submerged, are you wet or dry? neither. it is only until you exit the pool that you are wet.

Scuffed Zumwalt AGS

Short barrel, experimental, horrible motor locking, too big, but its a start.

Hate the zumwalt, but I love its weapon system.

The part where I keep misalligning the barrel on purpose is to show that the strength of the trapdoors can seat the barrel properly even if misalligned
