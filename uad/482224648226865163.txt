bug-reports 2020-05-28 05:40:06 When you save a build with colored trails, some wont keep the color saved, no matter what

general 2020-07-13 22:19:13 someone posted a 13 block build yesterday
general 2020-07-13 22:19:23 this was around 610 block

general 2020-07-13 22:20:51 i made it with what i had
general 2020-07-13 22:21:10 i like that plane
general 2020-07-13 22:21:34 honestly, thats a good build
general 2020-07-13 22:23:32 guys, if you like what you built, then that is all that matters.  only you see it all the time, and if you get mad cause some people dont like it, then who cares?  like there opinion should dictate whether you enjoy what you build
general 2020-07-13 22:26:29 caught up in the heat of the moment?
general 2020-07-13 22:27:09 do you like it?
general 2020-07-13 22:27:55 then why will you delete it?  just because a couple of people, who all they did was look at it, alter your feelings about your build?
general 2020-07-13 22:28:25 you were the one who had the idea, biult it, tested it, modifyed it, all that stuff
general 2020-07-13 22:28:36 so if you like it, then keep it
general 2020-07-13 22:29:18 you want to delete 4-5 hours worth of building, all because some internet strangers didnt like it?
general 2020-07-13 22:29:30 your the one seeing it when you play
general 2020-07-13 22:29:38 oyur the one who built it
general 2020-07-13 22:29:53 and yuor the one who should decide whether you like it or not
general 2020-07-13 22:30:04 damn, i cant spell your

creations-chat 2020-08-15 12:09:32 tiger 1 or 2?
creations-chat 2020-09-22 19:26:13 Put a nerf gun on it
creations-chat 2021-04-02 19:04:07 it is a bit basic.  what i suggest is making a plane or tank or anything that is real.  get reference images, draw out how things should go, plan ahead a bit.  during this you will get ideas and strategies on how to make others things.  basically, the more you build, the better you will get
creations-chat 2021-04-12 07:27:14 i realised that after making most of it, but yeah it really is
