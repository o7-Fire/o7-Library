creations-chat 2022-07-04 05:10:56 But fr why the blades bending down during "flight"

But is that realistic?😈

Yes they move using swashplate however the up and down movement is caused by lift

False the swashplate is controlled by yoke yes but the up and down flapping is lift 
Your second statement is correct to my furthest understanding. <:stuff:908917207986208828>

Yes further proves my point, the lift is part of the design to make the blades fold up during flight


Wait all this time by flapping you ment pitch?
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 05:11:25 No
creations-chat 2022-07-04 05:19:27 (intellectual argument)
creations-chat 2022-07-04 05:25:21 Ahh but what you dont know is that the ah1w barely has any flapping ability and at most the "flapping" is always up during flight <:thoink:657279634563399720>

Birds and other animals eat fish then they die and decay. The cycle repeats but on land, eventually getting spread to every animal and plant. So technicly you are eating shit.

plane-crazy 2022-10-29 19:36:14 they basically give the build 0 gravity

general 2022-10-30 05:50:33 No. Steam is like EA in the fact that you have to fucking pay to update most games
general 2022-10-30 05:51:00 Dcs, storm works, and a few others
general 2022-10-30 05:51:16 I do

general 2022-10-30 05:52:07 Ye
general 2022-10-30 05:52:17 What ive been saying
general 2022-10-30 05:52:54 Most multiplayer servers run that so without it its basically like owning the game without an update
general 2022-10-30 05:53:24 Im not saying it is
general 2022-10-30 05:53:32 Im saying it like an update
general 2022-10-30 05:54:10 Because every multiplayer server has it and it tells me to install the "version" in order to be able to join
general 2022-10-30 05:54:52 Sounds like it should be like an update at that point
general 2022-10-30 05:55:09 Fr
general 2022-10-30 05:55:36 I would
general 2022-10-30 05:56:05 I rather do dcs
general 2022-10-30 05:56:29 Also another downside of steam is that you cant get good sales
general 2022-10-30 05:57:02 For ex: the dcs f14 is 25% off rn but on steam its the reg price
general 2022-10-30 05:57:20 Same for many other things
general 2022-10-30 05:57:43 I would never work for steam
general 2022-10-30 05:58:14 THATS WHAT IM SAYING
general 2022-10-30 05:58:35 Jeez

creations-chat 2022-12-05 05:41:50 He asked a question and answered it in one sentence
general 2022-12-05 05:43:16 Welp
general 2022-12-05 05:43:34 Nothing I can do beyond this point to help
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:20:03 Wow they really can just copy any jet, slap canards on it and call it theirs in less then 4 years
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:22:44 
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:28:00 Well when typically designing an aircraft, you tend to research your own needs which leads to a unique shape however china and japan are both well known for copying many aircraft legally and illegally
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:30:03 Im an engineering geek 🤓 also Im bored
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:34:14 Thats not how aerospace engineering works.
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:41:48 Thats a copy, they literally are known for copying. Its different than finding solutions yourself, why do a lengthy process when you can just use a design that already works?
creations-chat 2022-12-05 15:45:48 Because they dont really do that much testing on it. The russians literally test their "state of the art" "stealth" jets on a tripod in a grass circle less then 20 ft above the ground

creations-chat 2022-12-05 16:11:42 The whole planes composite/copper shell deflects it, not some line through a canopy
creations-chat 2022-12-05 16:19:35 Dude its the same as a car basically, exterior shell diverts it as I said. The inner components are protected by a layer of composite that separates it
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 17:19:50 adjustable 1 wide f15 intakes
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 17:20:01 
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 17:21:25 
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 17:23:30 you could use this concept for f16 airbreaks too, just use the trapdoors on top
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 17:23:50 as long as motors dont collide
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 18:35:02 Welcome to use it if you need
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 18:59:37 No its the nose of the f18

plane-crazy 2022-12-05 19:00:19 Its a fuel tank.
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 19:00:41 It looks thick
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 19:01:02 You could prob elongate it, (thats not what she said)
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 19:01:50 
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 19:02:57 Then why is your flat at the back
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 19:03:41 I think it should be longer
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 19:03:50 By 1- or 2 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 19:04:25 Yeah should be longer
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 19:06:04 
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 19:06:36 this isnt one of those cases
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 19:06:53 just make it 1 block longer mate
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 19:06:59 1 block!
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 19:08:12 
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 19:08:57 actually I think you need to move your nose wheel too
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 19:09:41 it should be where the red line is
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 19:09:49 move the fuel tank forward
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 19:09:52 elongate it
plane-crazy 2022-12-05 19:09:56 then all set

plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:20:42 dosnt matter
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:20:50 that problem never should have happened
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:21:06 even the aerospace engineers say the same
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:21:43 perhaps the biggest failing of MCAS was that it 
relied on only one angle
-of
-attack sensor located 
on either side of the plane, not both. “Those 
sensors fail all the time when they get hit by a 
bird or freeze, and engineers decided to use only 
one of them, which is mind
-boggling,”
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:22:32 “The MCAS system was just unbelievably deficient, 
but it was the culture at Boeing that allowed this to 
happen…,”-Travis, a veteran instrument-rated pilot 
and career software engineer
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:23:04 According to the Indonesian findings, MCAS relied on 
only one sensor, which had a fault, and the flight 
crews hadn’t been well trained in how to use it. Also 
they said: There was also no cockpit warning 
light;the Lion Air pilots were unable to determine 
their true airspeed and altitude as the plane 
oscillated for nearly 10 minutes; and every time the 
pilots pulled up from a dive, MCAS pushed the nose 
down again, horribly
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:23:14 (from them, not my words)
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 22:24:02 then you should know that they knew the sensor was bad and were suposed to use more than one

creations-chat 2022-12-18 06:49:05 Actually they were not forced to use anything, they both came up with their designs from scratch on their own with one goal in mind. Be better than the su27


Second. That is why those nozzles are normal because they are common cone, circular nozzles.

plane-crazy 2023-01-31 18:26:20 Well, my many, many, braincells (surprising I know) in my cerebrum I have concluded that this information may prove valuable in future situations I find myself in. According to Oxford research "To remember the information you’ve learned for the long-term, use spaced repetition. Spaced repetition involves reviewing materials in intervals to decrease the deterioration of your memory over time." (Study Smarter And Remember What You Studied For Longer!
 Feb 01, 2021)
I will study like this until I know each angle by heart even if it takes 3 whole minutes. I could also use this information to back up arguments and possibly use it to flex without providing context. A few examples of a use for this information includes: 
- sharing the angle measurements with new players or friends to accomplish a more realistic build. 
- using extra math to use these angles plus motor 1 and spaced blocks a certain distence to stop the motor at the exact angle for a build.

This is probably not going to be 500 words because I have to cut it short so that I can walk up the stairs to get to my next class

The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.
