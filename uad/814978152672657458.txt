bug-reports 2023-03-02 01:29:08 on jon its fr
creations-chat 2023-05-08 23:00:16 respectively, leave forever and don‚Äôt come back
creations-chat 2023-05-08 23:41:45 you lied
creations-chat 2023-05-11 04:03:01 make it but 50x smaller
creations-chat 2023-05-11 21:53:57 1. you can achieve lots of the detail even when small 2. if its meant to be large, then state that its meant to be large. My SR71 that broke my game was  to scale and had a cockpit in ~3x1.2 space with enough convincing detail 3. being a whitename means absolutely nothing about a players skill and there are likely whitenames in this server that can easily create masterpieces. wouldnt be me though. apparently im just a whitename with no image perms
creations-chat 2023-05-11 22:00:17 also me simply trying to provide constructive criticism shouldn‚Äôt be a platform to completely just rant on about ‚Äúwhitenames with no image perms‚Äù because everybody who joins this server was in that position at some point. if i wasn‚Äôt being barraged by studying for end of year exams i could, given time, make something that would easily make me something other than a ‚Äúwhitename with no image perms.‚Äù but apparently i‚Äôm a whitename with no skill that doesn‚Äôt even have image perms so everything i say and post should be completely and entirely ignored, just because of the color of my name.
creations-chat 2023-05-11 22:24:39 yeah, and the sad thing was that my SR71 was extremely detailed. The thing that broke it was a 1/3 3x3 cylinder if im remembering correctly
creations-chat 2023-05-11 22:27:34 sure! in a bit tho. i have to go to a 2 hour orchestra concert, so it might take a while lol
creations-chat 2023-05-21 00:01:15 please kindly leave the server
creations-chat 2023-05-21 02:38:14 bro there is no way the redditor from earlier debunked my statement ‚Äúplease kindly leave the server‚Äù üò±ü§Ø
creations-chat 2023-05-21 14:08:04 russia more impressive to blow up
bot-central 2023-05-22 00:11:03 !rank
creations-chat 2023-05-22 00:11:25 which creation
creations-chat 2023-05-22 00:15:01 the build itself is missing a lot of details such as tubing, general thins sticking out, etc. The wheels don‚Äôt quite fit, and is missing the camo theme.
creations-chat 2023-05-22 00:18:50 i would but im suck in the back of my house because of my brothers grad party
creations-chat 2023-05-22 00:25:34 bruh im in 8th grade i dont know anybody
creations-chat 2023-05-24 13:12:31 me when people give me constructive criticism
creations-chat 2023-05-30 01:00:38 bruh the plane‚Äôs nose is 1 block wide. my guy used broken sparklers to make the cockpit.
creations-chat 2023-05-30 01:03:09 yes, essentially every cockpit posted in this server looks like a triangle; just because this one is slightly off doesnt mean its a sin (extremely small, too)
creations-chat 2023-05-30 01:05:58 ok now when you put it like that‚Ä¶ but even with that small mistake; the build still looks fabulous for the scale.
creations-chat 2023-05-30 01:09:04 the 2 images shouldnt line up bc of the change in dimensions, 3d for the game render and 2d for the overlay. if you want a good reference, try comparing the scale of a simple block in both scenarios
not by as much tho
creations-chat 2023-05-30 03:07:07 üò±
creations-chat 2023-05-31 01:48:16 they give you a warning for a reason
creations-chat 2023-05-31 01:51:22 you‚Äôre also talking here and trying to defend yourself; all of us are allergic to grass
creations-chat 2023-05-31 01:56:21 ‚Äúim just going to see if they enforce the law by committing a quick little robbery‚Äù
creations-chat 2023-05-31 02:15:43 look for yourself
creations-chat 2023-05-31 02:17:45 god i wish I could pull of the ‚Äúwip su-57‚Äù out rn but im on vacation
creations-chat 2023-05-31 02:19:53 cam lock doesnt work on mobile and i left my labtop at home bc im not one of those kids who go to another state just to play a game
creations-chat 2023-05-31 02:40:57 for the time it was likely impressive, but considering the new techniques and quality improvements over the years, it is well below average. the paint job looks very odd and blotchy, the cockpit feels extremely empty, and the slate materials feel extremely out of place. the general build is also very clunky, but that is expected of larger builds from that era
creations-chat 2023-05-31 03:11:09 wait a little bit. pc2 is a little behind schedule
creations-chat 2023-05-31 03:16:26 <@745632714400464927> ok so the general build looks good. the half wedge down could easily be replaced with a 1x2 half wedge down. canopy color should be changed or reverted to a solid material. my main concern is with the camo. just look up on google su57 and reference that for camo. even though the scale is too small to get every detail, at least try matching the colors. 
to summarize: 
fix underside of nose (not steep enough) 
change canopy color/material if you can
rework the camo
creations-chat 2023-05-31 03:19:01 also, the vertical stabilizers could be moved back and fix up they intakes so that the have a more angular approach
creations-chat 2023-05-31 21:20:57 small jet engines
creations-chat 2023-05-31 22:09:32 small/medium jet engine. then angle it a tad bit
creations-chat 2023-05-31 22:57:05 please ban somepnut from pc permanently
creations-chat 2023-05-31 23:04:44 is there any way you could .3 cylinder the gun? (look it up)
creations-chat 2023-06-01 01:40:04 oml that is ancient; you can see the border lines
creations-chat 2023-06-01 02:17:30 
creations-chat 2023-06-01 03:18:16 its cool as an extra image to see the inner workings of your creation, but posting it as your creation just looks weird
creations-chat 2023-06-01 03:20:41 ok now that you say it like
creations-chat 2023-06-01 18:48:54 i cant wait for a u.s destroyer to have colorful pride flags on it!!!
creations-chat 2023-06-01 23:07:58 actual shredder user ^^^
creations-chat 2023-06-02 00:17:41 bc its against the rules?

general 2023-06-02 17:09:59 yes and its too easy to use
general 2023-06-02 17:10:18 i prefer pc over flightpoint
general 2023-06-02 17:10:27 flightpoint dumbs it down too much
general 2023-06-02 17:10:37 pc still poses a challenge
general 2023-06-02 17:10:47 also pc flight physics are better
creations-chat 2023-06-02 20:31:16 nah @ server mods
help 2023-06-02 21:33:20 then fine tune it again
help 2023-06-02 21:38:25 if you‚Äôre not on your death bed, im pretty sure you have a spare hour sometime
bot-central 2023-06-02 21:39:34 !rank
help 2023-06-02 21:40:23 then focus on your other creation
help 2023-06-02 21:40:36 dont go around making 3 or so creations at a time
help 2023-06-02 21:40:48 if youre really gonna focus on 1 project, dont start others
general 2023-06-02 23:22:27 10 stupid

creations-chat 2023-06-05 19:04:45 ive never seen somebody so bad at spelling and grammar. damn ill have to go for 8 years old now
creations-chat 2023-06-05 19:13:17 and really effortless, unoriginal, cheap, and overall ruins pvp overall. keep in mind this excludes shredder cubes
creations-chat 2023-06-06 00:27:22 on God
creations-chat 2023-06-06 00:40:02 On god
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 01:28:08 that started happening when i tried to load my sr71, only got to about 250k ms ping
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 01:30:26 or was it 2 mil‚Ä¶ idk
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 01:30:33 lemme try to find a screenshot
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 01:31:10 nope
plane-crazy 2023-06-06 01:31:13 just 2 mil
creations-chat 2023-06-06 02:49:57 <@579494514595463168> wtf is that f35
creations-chat 2023-06-06 02:55:24 the obese f35? ig thats a decent excuse to messing up your build
creations-chat 2023-06-06 02:57:26 people called my f35 (very very bad) a chinese j35 bc the canopy was that bad. at this point im glad i accidentally saved over it
creations-chat 2023-06-06 05:11:09 i just said i saved over it
creations-chat 2023-06-06 18:53:28 theoretically, would it be possible to smooth out the tip of the nose?
creations-chat 2023-06-06 18:55:54 what im seeing is that you could make a cam lock mess and fix up the weird transitions using cylinders or half cylinder 2s and fill it in to a large extent. though there would still be a little awkward room, the cam lock mess would fix up most of the nose (nvm im a dumbass)
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:05:52 when people give whitenames useful advise, there is a 50/50 chance that they go on a rant about how toxic the server is and that they don‚Äôt get any good advice
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:08:01 a large majority of them are also talentless 11/12 year olds trying to show off their F14 that was made in like 30 minutes (or posting wips in creations)
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:40:18 im fine with the pvp jet combat rn. i just wish that the damage done by shredder bug tutorials was undone
creations-chat 2023-06-06 19:43:01 ok if rocket tracking wasnt so shit it would be fine. plus, you can just use guns
general 2023-06-07 00:43:13 yesterday i had a dream where pc got a major update
general 2023-06-07 00:43:23 when will my dreams come true üò≠üò≠üò≠

general 2023-06-07 17:19:48 nah
general 2023-06-07 17:20:26 he said just a month or so ago that he was still working on it
general 2023-06-07 17:21:10 doesnt mean he isnt working on it

bug-reports 2023-06-09 20:53:38 known
creations-chat 2023-06-09 23:51:30 did you base it off a real tank/bus? btw the paint-job is very bland and just is hard to look at, and for the love of god turn up your graphics quality
creations-chat 2023-06-09 23:53:37 just bc you spent a lot of time on something doesnt save you from the wrath of pcc. (in other words, if you spend a lot of time on something, that doesnt mean the outcome is good or worthy of upvotes (most good builds can take upwards of days))
creations-chat 2023-06-11 05:00:55 server rng (200k ms ping moment)
creations-chat 2023-06-12 16:55:10 u can use the mfbc private server. all you have to do is join and verify in it
creations-chat 2023-06-12 18:02:08 üò≠üò≠üò≠
creations-chat 2023-06-13 15:59:59 omg if you spend time on a build it doesnt mean its good
creations-chat 2023-06-13 16:02:27 no you dont understand; he spent time on his build so you must upvote it
creations-chat 2023-06-13 16:05:19 idk why people are delusional to the belief that if they spend time on their builds, other people will automatically give the praise and upvotes
creations-chat 2023-06-13 16:12:15 wait ur the one making that thing? bro teach me the ways üôè
creations-chat 2023-06-13 16:14:19 oh yeah forgot about that. my 800-900 block su57 is starting to have trouble loading for some reason. plus, my 1600 block sr71 broke a couple months ago. i love plane crazy ü§©ü§©

creations-chat 2023-06-15 01:19:32 Nissian Cube (the car of all time)
general 2023-06-16 19:59:47 bro calm down its just a game
general 2023-06-16 20:00:32 the reason why it‚Äôs likely taking so long is the massive amount of negativity affecting his mental state
general 2023-06-16 20:00:38 possibly demotivating him
general 2023-06-16 20:00:54 he had irl problems and now the entire community is against him
general 2023-06-16 20:01:38 that‚Äôd probably work, but constantly saying ‚Äúoh this rickje guy‚Äù over and over again wont help
general 2023-06-16 20:02:41 (they wouldn‚Äôt understand bc of how inconsiderate this community is)
general 2023-06-16 20:03:01 if pc2 takes a while let him work
general 2023-06-16 20:04:09 *made it but worse
general 2023-06-16 20:04:35 yeah
general 2023-06-16 20:04:43 isnt rickje is college or something

creations-chat 2023-06-17 02:12:23 you‚Äôll learn over time. maybe now‚Äôs not the best time to post your builds
creations-chat 2023-06-17 02:19:59 holy moly bro. i read a lot but im not reading that

bug-reports 2023-06-23 01:00:09 bro its never happened to me what are you talking about
bug-reports 2023-06-23 01:18:35 yeah like epicc is known in here for having the jetpack curse put on him
bug-reports 2023-06-23 01:22:08 yeah he might need a warning
creations-chat 2023-06-24 00:39:37 bro at least try on your builds. 9 year old me couldve built something better in an hour. maybe you should try to learn motorlock and how to actually make a proper build

creations-chat 2023-06-24 00:49:09 average person on the internet (great job, you just called somebody who is autistic autistic)
creations-chat 2023-06-24 00:52:25 people are really quick to use the autism card even though they have their head lodged 3 feet into their rectum. being autistic doesnt mean anything about a person and their personality or intelligence. if you're too stuborn to understand any of this, ok then. dont put it on me or anybody else like me
creations-chat 2023-06-24 00:55:37 so you're saying people who use a relatively basic mechanic makes them better than others? special? if you're too lazy to learn the mechanic then just fuck off and stop bothering me about it
creations-chat 2023-06-24 00:57:43 and? like i said, its an extremely basic mechanic, and being in this discord server makes you a nerd, too.
creations-chat 2023-06-24 01:00:14 if you're in this server that means that you, at one point, into pc. so much so to join a discord server. its ok, you can admit it. everybody in this server has some nerd within them (and that's ok)
creations-chat 2023-06-24 01:02:35 i have the autism card !1!11!111!!!!!!!11!1 ü§ì  (YES YES I CALLED THEM AUTISTIC I WON YES) (also go fuck yourself, you're the type of person to be doing heroin on the streets)
creations-chat 2023-06-24 01:04:58 ok, then surely making fun of people with a mental disorder is the best thing to do (similar to walking up to a dementia patient and making fun of them for forgetting things)
help 2023-06-24 22:44:26 cig not to scale üò§
help 2023-06-24 22:54:41 not enough

creations-chat 2023-06-25 16:38:25 opinions? (ignore the tiny incomplete part on the left)
creations-chat 2023-06-25 17:05:25 yea
creations-chat 2023-06-25 18:52:09 it spawns in fine rn (engines are about 600 blocks)
creations-chat 2023-06-26 05:00:47 f-xx? (no, the ping gods have taken my creation)
creations-chat 2023-06-26 05:04:22 it has like a 1 in 100 probability to spawn in without my ping skyrocketing, so unfortunately i abandoned it (no)
creations-chat 2023-06-26 05:08:19 like 1200 or so but like 1/2 of that are locking motors, so the game doesnt handle it well
creations-chat 2023-06-26 05:10:51 yea. i picked it up for 1k dollas in 2019 right after the pandemic restrictions let off in the us. it randomly crashes sometimes, and after running a higher-end game for a while, it usually dramatically drops frames once the motherboard can't take it. im getting a new one in august though, so that's good. oh yeah, its a laptop, too. (also gtg, its like midnight)
creations-chat 2023-06-27 03:09:21 *edgy terrorist description
creations-chat 2023-06-27 19:07:44 you‚Äôre the average twitter user who complains about america non-stop, yet refuses to look into other countries to live in (all the other options are likely worse)
creations-chat 2023-06-27 19:19:04 at least its not california (i am texan)
creations-chat 2023-06-27 19:23:28 idk jack about florida except for the fact that their beaches are much better than texas‚Äôs gulf of mexico
creations-chat 2023-06-27 19:26:09 info, check for roles and find image perms (then look harder)
creations-chat 2023-06-27 19:30:25 its quite literally in the second most recent post in info
creations-chat 2023-06-29 21:03:08 the simplicity of pc makes for extreme problem solving when trying to create complex creations. games like flightpoint eliminate the problem solving and just take long as hell
