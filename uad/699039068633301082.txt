help 2020-10-18 18:44:14 So, I was doing Just Fish's Bismarck tutorial when I encountered a problem when doing the third fold. Since the hull size is 10 blocks, I tried making it 10 blocks on the 3rd fold, but it only let me do 8 because of the plot barrier. Everything was correct, so i have just no idea what to do..
help 2020-10-18 19:19:49 i did
help 2020-10-18 19:19:57 i followed the entire thing lol
help 2020-10-18 19:22:03 the hull is 10 blocks on the bottom folds, but the plot barrier doesn't allow me to do 10 blocks for the top barrier, instead 8.
