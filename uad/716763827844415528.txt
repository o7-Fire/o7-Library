bot-central 2021-11-09 01:27:59 &suggest **"Repaint" feature [OTHER]**
Let's say you want to repaint a larger build of yours since you don't like the current color scheme. It can take a long time to do so, especially when there's lots of smaller blocks. This feature would allow a user to enter in two separate RGB codes, one that selects blocks of that specific color and another that will repaint those blocks to the new color. This would help save time for people who want to change color schemes without spending an unnecessarily long time doing so.

help 2022-01-04 16:08:14 sorry, I meant the exhaust (thanks for the input though)
how's this for a start?
creations-chat 2022-01-05 03:27:13 <@410455661814480896> made me laugh, well deserved upvote
creations-chat 2022-01-05 14:21:00 it took longer than you would think
creations-chat 2022-01-05 21:17:07 Welcome to <#504436696021204992> 

I honestly think it's a good build, but your presentation of it is imo kinda messed up
creations-chat 2022-01-05 21:29:45 I agree with Summit_Tank, the front is a little wonky with a half cylinder. A half ball would look better
Maybe also lock the tail down and make it more flush with the fuselage
creations-chat 2022-01-05 21:32:18 If you remove 1 or 2 disconnectors from the front end it might
Vertical tail is too tall as well, try taking off the bottom wing panel and just make it 2 blocks tall
Probably, yeah
creations-chat 2022-01-05 23:52:29 Gonna repaint this, any suggestions for schemes? I'd prefer a flat color btw
creations-chat 2022-01-06 00:06:49 <@!659554251994955786> <@!696225961783459871> these good ?
creations-chat 2022-01-06 00:08:59 going for this kinda look, but not sure if the colors are right
idk, I'll paint it then send it to you fellas and see what y'all like more
creations-chat 2022-01-06 00:55:21 Meanwhile your builds:
creations-chat 2022-01-06 02:56:42 i looked for messages sent from him with an image earlier today, I don't think you can find it anymore but it might become a funny meme for the server
"dumpster fire" lol
creations-chat 2022-01-06 03:11:34 <@!696225961783459871> how's this?
creations-chat 2022-01-06 03:18:29 alright, give me a few minutes
creations-chat 2022-01-06 03:21:10 are you sure though? it looks undersaturated
lemme try and find a better picture actually

yeah I know, but it feels way too light
creations-chat 2022-01-06 03:23:15 this looks way better honestly, it was probably the lighting or something
"F-2A"
creations-chat 2022-01-06 03:30:01 yeah that looks a lot better now. I'll figure out the desert one later
just curious, what program did you use to find the values?

cool, thanks to both of you
creations-chat 2022-01-06 03:58:58 <@696225961783459871> <@723940197456281640> Looks very nice, thanks to both of you
I'll get to work on the desert scheme now since R0BL0C0W wanted it

I tried to make the bottom as light as possible so that's why there's a shot of the underbelly
Note to self: can probably make underside of engine lighter, should try tomorrow
creations-chat 2022-01-06 04:06:44 me who uses microsoft edge
<:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2022-01-06 13:41:35 Why does it look like the plane isn't finished from the side? Did you take the pictures at two different times?

Other than that, yeah it looks pretty nice

oh, it's just hard for me to make out where the h stabs are in the top picture
creations-chat 2022-01-06 14:36:46 <@659554251994955786>
Edit: I'm gonna make the nose lighter in a few hours, but I can't get on now so later <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2022-01-06 14:39:55 Custom plane, R0BL0C0W wanted me to make a desert camo
If you look at some of my past messages you'll see the original design
creations-chat 2022-01-06 21:47:38 <@753399511061233694> can you send a video of it working?
creations-chat 2022-01-06 22:13:57 Not a whole lot of clearance there, make the wheels bigger like sharcc said

Just curious, what are you going for?
Yeah, you definitely need bigger wheels for that. Gl building it though
creations-chat 2022-01-07 01:35:40 That's the guns (look on the nose)
it's not as long as it is in the build but mini restraints
creations-chat 2022-01-07 01:39:05 <@725358947904651335> did you look at the blueprint? it has two engines | exposed lock? cope, it's a mini build <:PewPew:532303441293344778> | what do you mean wing control?
<@790634040780390440> yeah, it was too small for me to figure out the second support structure. I might add it eventually but for now no | oh yeah, and the white ones hold together 1x1 control surfaces inside the nose to help maneuverability. I kinda like it, honestly
help 2022-01-07 04:10:27 what? no I didn't, it's the same one
help 2022-01-07 04:10:46 maybe
help 2022-01-07 04:11:07 i've got another plane I wanna make, if I give up on that then I'll start on the bigger one
help 2022-01-07 04:12:57 yes, but I gave up for no reason
I'll start on that other plane tomorrow
help 2022-01-07 04:13:07 and I'm sticking with half wedge down thanks
help 2022-01-07 04:13:44 makes it a little smaller. hw up would mean bigger and I don't want that
help 2022-01-07 04:13:56 no, it's an old Skunk Works plane
I'm not gonna reveal it until I either finish it or flop it or just desperately need help again
thank you, I'm gonna need it lol
help 2022-01-07 04:16:04 nice, are you gonna draw it like I did with mine?
help 2022-01-07 04:16:55 hm
I'd offer to help but it's late for me, so gl with it
help 2022-01-07 04:25:35 It's already a 1x4 and I don't have enough space to do custom angles
help 2022-01-07 04:26:20 Then more exposed locc
help 2022-01-07 04:27:09 I may do something about the v stab tomorrow though
help 2022-01-07 04:27:21 But now I need bed
help 2022-01-07 04:27:51 Talk tomorrow ig

Looks great, both of you. 2 questions:
1) Is that a bomb on the center pylon?
2) How long did it take?
creations-chat 2022-01-09 19:28:45 <@652341016510201856> Original plane? Looks great
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 04:08:33 maybe probably hopefully the first person ever to fly a plane in here
thanks to my friend <@!864953615872950274>
plane-crazy 2022-01-12 04:09:04 when was the first one then?
creations-chat 2022-01-19 21:30:24 <@762747854866612334> engines look great, cool decision using the signs
creations-chat 2022-01-20 00:15:34 I like how you made a detacheable cockpit, I've never seen that before (in PC). Good attention to detail!
help 2022-01-23 02:56:58 i'm awful at cars, need someone to help literally every step of the way
(this is probably the wrong channel for this but idc <:empty:794431705070174238>)
creations-chat 2022-01-24 00:52:39 <@!921250489281159231> I love how you can see it through the fuselage. Can you send a video of it in flight or does it not actually fly?
creations-chat 2022-02-10 14:01:29 "your creation is ok but not outstanding, therefore get downvoted to oblivion"

seriously y'alls standards are too high. that's not always a bad thing but sometimes when someone's proud of something you shouldn't just downvote it because you don't like it, take into consideration things like "what's the skill level", "how long have they been playing", "what are they good at", "how big is it," etc.

what if that's my best build (which it is)? it's not really that hard to get expert, my submission for it wasn't even that good (here: https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/913775331918372874)

anyway thank you for coming to my most-likely-to-be-viewed-as-insane TED rant, my self esteem is gone mostly because of this server so I'm gonna leave soon
