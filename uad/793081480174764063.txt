creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:19:35 So the front is just fine, the problem is the rear
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:23:23 the 1971 one, dummy-
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:25:28 oh fuck, forgot that, I was looking at 1971 photos
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:27:33 yeah fuck it, imma make another car, any recomendations from cars from the 40's to the 70's?
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:29:36 Yeah anyways imma just make another car
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:31:44 bro all of you are saying it's bad, I'm starting to think it's bad aswell, what the fuck do you want me to do?
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:34:02 
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:36:04 Anyways, moving on to another car
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:38:45 yeah imma make the one that's not a truck... Actually, I think imma make a custom car looking at these 40-60's cars
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:40:48 Also guys should I lift the car half a block or have them touching the ground along the wheels
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:43:07 Like a disconnector off ground?
creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:52:31 Alright, thanks for the tip
creations-chat 2022-02-25 03:17:35 This is pretty much a technical build. What do you think this is, guys? A minicopter or a tinycopter
creations-chat 2022-03-03 23:29:58 Yo, everyone. Do you think I should cover this truck's gap with a half block?
creations-chat 2022-03-04 00:07:02 bro at least say yes or no, do I cover the gap
creations-chat 2022-03-04 00:09:41 :/ no lol
creations-chat 2022-03-04 00:13:07 lol ok XD
creations-chat 2022-03-04 00:16:15 alright, thanks for actually giving me tips dude!
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:00:42 yo guys what do you think about this custom minitank
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:02:46 Got some refferences from the Goliath Tank used in WW2, which was explosive, just like mine
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:06:13 
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:12:48 Any honest opinion from the non-expert members in the server that don't have more ranks in their role list than pins in a boy scout's uniform?
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:15:17 Alright, thanks for the tips bro! Should I hide the suspension with more disconnectors?
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:24:42 Changed the colors
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:27:28 yeah, and it works really good. Can destroy an average-sized ground vehicle and it's really fast for it's size, max speed of 220 SPS
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:29:31 (excuse my grammar, I'm not an english speaker. I'm from Southamerica actually)
creations-chat 2022-03-04 20:31:36 this is how it looks with disconnectors covering the suspension, I think I should switch to half wedges
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 20:33:40 <@!698587744842022983>  There's only one way to see that :/, wanna see me stream using it?
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 20:34:18 
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 20:35:17 custom, thanks dude!
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 20:35:56 uh-
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 20:35:59 maybe you can just see me stream
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 20:36:07 why not dude
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 20:36:09 oh.
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 20:36:17 :/
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 20:38:21 alright
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 20:39:09 XD
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 20:46:03 there, added the changes I could add
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 20:46:15 
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 20:52:37 e
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 20:52:45 
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 20:53:25 don't care if I can't ._.
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 20:53:46 it's main purpose was to explode, not to be an actual tank
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 20:54:01 think of the german Goliath Tank used in WW2
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 20:56:43 basically the Goliath tank but with added weapons
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:06:13 .
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:06:14 uh
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:10:41 You just need more shape, the cylindrical body well-
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:10:49 we can say that nobody makes jets like that
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:11:24 and the wing shape is not related to the body shape
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:12:05 hmm.
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:12:29 Maybe just make the top half blocky
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:12:37 and the bottom half just round
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:12:42 like it is right now
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:13:54 lol
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:37:29 oh.
plane-crazy 2022-03-04 21:37:30 Yeah.
creations-chat 2022-03-05 14:27:45 YO IT WORKS ON WATER
creations-chat 2022-03-07 14:55:42 Yo guys, I'm still finishing this little zeppelin. What do you think about how it's looking? Should I fix the fins?
creations-chat 2022-03-07 15:00:51 Same zeppelin with fixed fins
creations-chat 2022-05-21 14:43:47 wait what

creations-chat 2022-05-21 14:47:20 Hey bro
creations-chat 2022-05-21 14:49:18 no, I'm actually in PVP mode
creations-chat 2022-05-21 14:52:07 uh- thanks I guess
creations-chat 2022-05-21 14:53:53 just compared the tank with a lego version of it
creations-chat 2022-05-21 15:05:36 uh- should I try motor locking the middle section of the tank
creations-chat 2022-06-11 12:27:34 here's my Patriot truck again but I updated the back
creations-chat 2022-06-11 12:29:49 even better.
Added some signs at the very back, now the exposed motors in there are harder to see from the side (I also painted the windows)
creations-chat 2022-06-11 12:46:38 yup
general 2022-06-17 13:28:59 lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:18:34 Just made an UFO. It's kind of a drone
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:20:46 What would the I stand for
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:20:48 xd
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:21:43 well then-
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:22:54 I made it with the least amount of motorlock I could
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:22:59 
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:23:15 well- for it's size, the biggest amount of motor lock I could put into it
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:23:20 it looks good for me, and it works
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:23:24 it has good stability
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:23:40 opinion taken
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:23:42 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:25:37 well uhm-
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:25:44 I just made it small as a drone
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:25:48 because I dunno
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:26:40 And to terrorize servers I already got this-
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:27:04 y e s
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:27:24 I said
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:27:31 "Time to make a godly amount of trolling"
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:27:37 then I built it
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:29:06 Time to produce a biblical amount of brutal trolling.
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:30:45 Time to create a galactical, cosmical quantity of the trolling action for the equal of 2.50 hours.
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:31:31 No.
plane-crazy 2022-10-02 16:31:50 <:trollface:775024642104229898>

I don't even know what's wrong with the jet
creations-chat 2022-10-16 13:06:04 Yeah I know, it's supposed to be in the horizontal wing itself but I can't do that
creations-chat 2022-10-16 13:09:01 Bro, check the motorlock of this
creations-chat 2022-10-16 13:11:05 B r o

and now you still say it's poorly made
creations-chat 2022-10-16 13:16:59 Okay dude I get it-
creations-chat 2022-12-14 15:15:58 What else should I add to this plane?

creations-chat 2022-12-18 23:20:53 Remaking my MK IV Tank, but it's a bit smaller
creations-chat 2022-12-18 23:49:14 I don't think it's looking off

really accurate
creations-chat 2022-12-18 23:56:18 Have you seen that scene from All Quiet on The Western Front
when the tanks are raiding the frontline of Soissons
that's what happens
creations-chat 2022-12-19 12:43:37 Finished the MK IV Tank
creations-chat 2022-12-19 12:45:45 if I added 2 guns instead it would be much weaker in PVP
thanks bro
creations-chat 2022-12-19 12:53:38 ...

creations-chat 2022-12-19 13:06:01 I don't think there's a problem with it being too small-

creations-chat 2022-12-19 13:23:24 **Flashbacks**

plane-crazy 2022-12-29 18:13:01 I always built zeppelins like this
plane-crazy 2022-12-29 18:13:09 the bow looked weird-
plane-crazy 2022-12-29 18:13:27 XD mine was too
plane-crazy 2023-01-19 20:38:14 Made this custom plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-19 20:38:25 
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:28:43 I dunno what I just made
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:29:15 I knew you would critcize it
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:29:21 bro I didn't make it specifically to look good

plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:35:12 DON'T LOOK AT THE PLANE IN THIS ANGLE
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:36:31 ._.
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:36:39 God damn that is being dumb

plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:44:00 I'm trying to find it
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:44:45 might be bigger by a block
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:44:51 2 probably
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:46:04 the advantages of being smaller is that you can punch and kick a bully's balls without him expecting it
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 16:46:24 e
