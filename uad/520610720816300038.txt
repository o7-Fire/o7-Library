creations-chat 2022-12-09 20:54:04 its like a CSX train, right?
creations-chat 2022-12-09 20:57:28 if its meant to be somewhat like that i would recommend dimming the color of the blues on it, or atleast making it a bit grimy in some areas with darker colors.
creations-chat 2022-12-09 21:29:00 me, who builds trains sometimes:
<:kek:652566605028524033>
creations-chat 2022-12-09 21:35:26 blue and yellow isnt always ukraine, its usual train colors
creations-chat 2022-12-11 22:41:17 ive been buildin up an island recently without motorlock (i try and do as many builds as i can without it to prove people can build good without it), i would send screenshots but im not rank 3 yet.
general 2022-12-12 15:34:15 wtf did I just appear into
general 2022-12-12 15:35:14 if he sounds cool he probably won't be

the-dump 2022-12-13 13:50:09 
general 2022-12-13 13:50:49 welcome to the plane crazy community, dude.
general 2022-12-13 13:52:14 me when corrupted humor
general 2022-12-13 13:56:35 yeah looks normal to me
creations-chat 2022-12-13 14:04:21 thanks, I had been messing with disconnections before making the first island version and I found that out.
creations-chat 2022-12-13 15:23:43 why tf are people mad about me having a positive score? this isnt a competition lol
creations-chat 2022-12-13 15:25:47 why are you even mad in the first place? thing hasn't even been up for a full hour yet it could get a lower score later.
creations-chat 2022-12-13 15:28:20 @.floppa_nature seems to be atleast kinda angry.

also I feel like this community has pretty high standards, i atleast tried my best but all I get told is to "make a better boat"
creations-chat 2022-12-13 15:30:39 honestly pretty true right there
creations-chat 2022-12-13 15:33:28 in a response to this, my pc can run max graphics but its pretty laggy. i might still try tho.
creations-chat 2022-12-13 15:47:38 don't think basilik realizes you cant put ref images in
creations-chat 2022-12-13 16:30:32 people really won't shut up about the boat when thats not even the main attraction of the build. not everything has to be perfect.
creations-chat 2022-12-13 16:33:42 <#925563336500871268>
creations-chat 2022-12-14 17:52:32 im makin a mini replica of the plane crazy map, what color should i use for grass?
creations-chat 2022-12-14 17:54:55 so which color then

update: got this custom color made, maybe it would work.
creations-chat 2022-12-14 17:56:58 heres the custom color
creations-chat 2022-12-14 18:03:03 startin off by designating areas
creations-chat 2022-12-14 18:06:06 sorry your eyes cant handle it while mine can
creations-chat 2022-12-14 18:11:39 it was one fucking screenshot dude
general 2022-12-14 18:45:26 i have quick question

when doing a rank request ticket, do i send everything in the message with the command or do i do it seperately from the command?
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 15:54:40 tbh, my only actual hope for PC2 is for some form of no-collision building, atleast for signs and such. the amount of times that I've had to find a way to work around a detail sign is uncountable.
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 15:55:00 wtf is that
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 15:55:08 hurts my brain
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 15:55:53 that hurts me mentally dude
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 15:56:40 make the length and spread max then just go right next to the blacklist thing, its annoying enough for other people.
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 15:57:04 does in my book
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 15:57:22 may be fun for you but not for others
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 15:58:09 this is why we need the blacklists to be just one big block
general 2022-12-15 15:59:12 its reaching the "several people are typing" typing display, this makes me concerned for whats going on
general 2022-12-15 16:00:31 what's your opinion on biplanes?
general 2022-12-15 16:01:30 its about to be shredder bugged
general 2022-12-15 16:01:45 agreed
general 2022-12-15 16:02:51 yeah their pretty fun, especially if you can make the engine burst. it looks really cool if the engine were to smoke.
general 2022-12-15 16:04:31 honestly I just built my tank for fun, its only weapon is a firework.
general 2022-12-15 16:04:51 yeah I'm not a pvp guy
general 2022-12-15 16:06:05 reminds me of my giant tut plane project I wanna start
general 2022-12-15 16:06:26 to be fair who's original anyway
general 2022-12-15 16:06:40 literally everyone has thought of atleast one thing the same as you
general 2022-12-15 16:06:48 nothing is original in the pc community
general 2022-12-15 16:07:05 and thats why I won't post it
general 2022-12-15 16:07:44 i have multiple builds ill never post (such as my plot train, it'll get shitted on so hard)
general 2022-12-15 16:08:35 I've explained why tf i won't post it if i do build it
general 2022-12-15 16:10:00 ok but

would this project idea actually be good?

-A steam engine freight train that unfolds into an anti-jet train.
creations-chat 2022-12-15 16:10:41 ok but

would this project idea actually be good?

-A steam engine freight train that unfolds into an anti-jet train.
creations-chat 2022-12-16 15:32:16 guys what type of train should I make? I was feeling old-style freight load being pulled by a steam engine.
creations-chat 2022-12-16 15:43:15 nah, I already got a thomas and I realisticified him. new word, realisticified
creations-chat 2022-12-16 16:19:54 baller sucks, convince me otherwise.
creations-chat 2022-12-16 16:22:01 <@803292176418078720> only in the chest. what about non-existent Santa? red all over his clothing. fucking middle school kids who think their goth wear more red than baller does.

<@504577008383033344> fake
creations-chat 2022-12-16 16:27:12 my hats brown, dumbass. the image is just deepfried enough to make it look red.
creations-chat 2022-12-16 17:44:00 undo button
creations-chat 2022-12-16 17:46:09 if you had pressed the undo button even the day after im pretty sure it wouldve brought the ship back. not 100% sure but mightve worked
creations-chat 2022-12-16 17:48:58 anyways, i just posted a new build in creations and its gettin downvoted immediately. is there anything i can improve about the build?
it was built back in april so if its really bad thats kinda why
creations-chat 2022-12-16 17:52:08 its not even a coal car, its just

a car.
as for the detail part, i kinda like the low-poly style. not really any point in changing my entire style for one build people dont like.
creations-chat 2022-12-16 17:54:16 think imma change the van up a little bit tho, maybe add sidedoor hinges and some new colors to it so its not as bright.
creations-chat 2022-12-16 18:02:47 what do i put in the truck/car?
creations-chat 2022-12-17 15:08:39 im makin the backrooms
creations-chat 2022-12-17 22:40:25 maybe

general 2022-12-19 16:02:50 ello chat
general 2022-12-19 16:05:52 real talk tho, I deny the existence of santa.
general 2022-12-21 14:00:18 no, you only need the mom, but the rng you need for it with just mom is pretty annoying.
general 2022-12-21 14:01:00 ello
general 2022-12-21 14:01:50 do that more and you'll get spam warned
general 2022-12-21 14:02:25 don't apologize, its fine
general 2022-12-21 14:03:09 I know but to the bots that counts as spam
general 2022-12-21 14:04:34 literally my first message on the server got me bot warned for spam, all I did was put "asd" a few times in one message.
general 2022-12-21 14:05:14 SEE
general 2022-12-21 14:05:37 I did that much asd in one message
general 2022-12-21 14:06:00 because I randomly do it, bad habit 8g
general 2022-12-21 14:06:51 asdasdasdasdasdasdasd
general 2022-12-21 14:07:38 just a text to speech saying each letter individually as a horse gallops
general 2022-12-21 14:09:02 why do they call it a flying squirrel if it glides instead of flying
general 2022-12-21 14:09:41 didn't expect a serious answer but ok
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:10:41 yeah this communities standards are high as hell.
or I guess high as heaven if your christian
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:13:30 you say when I get swarmed with "make a better build" message for having a poly style build.
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:18:02 also, calling it easy when this happens
https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1054922768707239966
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:24:33 theres another example of this community having high standards. its a pretty decent build but gets downvote bombed despite them probably following the directions of other users.
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:58:46 that shit was hours ago and your still going on about it?
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:00:48 no just annoyed his still going on about the standards thing. it started back at 11 its been nearly 4 hours. unnecessary responses to "prove" a point just make it seem like your trying to have the last laugh of it all.

<@627546746792443904> never said it was impossible, dumbass. should maybe fully read messages before replying.
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:02:53 honestly its pretty fair that one was downvoted tho, thing was made in april, didnt expect it to do well anyways. i only posted it because i had no idea of what to post. i dont build things just to show off.
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:07:04 all i said was a single swear directed at someone which you allowed me to do earlier, bot. jeez.

as i was trying to say, why are we even still going with this? people have different interpretations of good, but the point im trying to prove is that most people who even scroll through the chat to upvote or downvote builds usually downvote builds that are, in your words, "worse than average" when the builds themselves are still good enough to pass off enough to get atleast the first level of a rank.
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:09:50 i will agree with the charger aswell, i was kinda seeing the proportions myself since im not the biggest builder of cars for that scale

as for the island i think the only reason it got upvotes in the first place is from the grass.
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 21:54:26 they have reports closed so i cant report a dude for 18+ content in the game
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 21:56:07 but im serious about that
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 21:56:55 when your trying to get the bad people off the game but reports are closed and everyone else just sees it as a joking matter:
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 21:58:00 if you see them everywhere then you would see them in every server
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 21:58:50 because reports are closed
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 21:59:18 not really mad, more just dissapointed.
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:00:17 i wasnt trying to call him bru.
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:00:54 his being legit, pc2 has taken 4 years
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:02:12 and roblox in general
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:02:17 their dumbass updates nobody cares about
plane-crazy 2022-12-23 22:02:50 1st
general 2022-12-27 15:45:23 ayo what he playing on that?
general 2022-12-27 15:45:55 I kinda felt he was playing the happy wheels theme in that thing
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 15:47:36 totally not me boutta make a can of soda instead of an actual build
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 15:48:24 it overheated
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 15:50:11 I had the idea for another dumb build, a ship in a bottle that works as a submarine
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 15:51:09 another dumb idea: a submarine that works as a plane
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 15:51:19 just completely flipping functions around
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 15:51:52 in plane crazy its just the opposite
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 15:52:02 theres more subs in the sky than planes in the sea
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 15:56:52 if you did the submarine in the sky thing but with a ship it would jsut be the flying dutchman
plane-crazy 2022-12-27 15:56:58 which would probably be cooler
general 2022-12-27 16:00:31 walter white

I proved you wrong
general 2022-12-29 13:41:29 bup
general 2022-12-29 13:42:10 true

plane-crazy 2022-12-29 14:25:08 5 block rails would be great imo
plane-crazy 2022-12-29 14:25:45 its an **opinion**
general 2022-12-29 14:57:57 you might not some of us others do
general 2022-12-29 14:59:10 hopefully not otherwise people will set it to 0 so they don't get destroyed
general 2022-12-29 15:01:33 all I really want in PC2 is motor acceleration, would make starting up planes alot better if they got propellers
general 2022-12-29 15:03:16 door stuck
general 2022-12-29 15:03:48 hope its alot bigger than the current, the current one is extremely sucky.
general 2022-12-29 15:05:31 im also hoping he shrinks the rail size aswell, the amount of times I've put off making another proper scale rail train due to it being 9 blocks wide (7 if you dont include rail blocks) is insane as hell
general 2022-12-29 15:07:22 im correct
general 2022-12-29 15:09:31 theres only 5 things I want out of pc2
-bigger map
-better rails
-motor acceleration
-quarter block
-better blacklist system
general 2022-12-29 15:10:30 you joking or no?
general 2022-12-29 16:06:48 nobody gives a damnq
general 2022-12-29 16:11:25 canada has the largest amount of gamer females ever
general 2022-12-29 16:20:09 pretty sure his straighter than the pole your mother dances on.
general 2022-12-29 16:21:07 so just because i don't got a rank yet I'm invalid, of course that's how it works.
general 2022-12-29 16:21:38 embed fail
general 2022-12-29 16:22:57 srs talk though I hate how validation in this server is based on name color. I get it I dont got a rank yet but its pretty annoying to just be cut right off because of not having a colored rank yet.
general 2022-12-29 16:24:14 piss color name
general 2022-12-29 16:24:38 piss color name

general 2022-12-29 16:28:46 just say fuck, man.
general 2022-12-29 16:29:28 who deleted the fuck
general 2022-12-29 16:30:13 also how much do you all wanna bet <@697893501274161325> is changing his name color again to call me colorblind again
general 2022-12-29 16:30:54 and who said your chad emoji
general 2022-12-29 16:31:57 speaking the language of 'learn not to distinguish people by name color'
general 2022-12-29 16:32:14 shut up expert rank
general 2022-12-29 16:33:10 it was a fucking response I dont care that much, but I do genuinely hate how people are distinguished by having a rank or not
general 2022-12-29 16:33:30 piss
general 2022-12-29 16:33:59 because its genuinely fucking annoying to be cut off because of your name color.
general 2022-12-29 16:34:33 I said i don't care that much, I do still slightly care.
general 2022-12-29 16:35:02 his slaughter man
general 2022-12-29 16:35:39 hold on turn back to purple you'll have a license to kill
general 2022-12-29 16:36:25 you were created in a lab
general 2022-12-29 16:37:11 im fine with you being that, its just fine to be yourself.

general 2022-12-29 16:41:41 -mythical creature
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 14:03:56 in my case it would be hiding the entire build
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 14:05:25 2 years
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 14:05:30 gonna be 3 soon
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 14:06:06 the meme itself
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 14:06:12 but the game rn is 4
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 14:06:57 soon the meme itself will be able to eat its first steak
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 14:07:28 it evolved into baller, as baller stole alot of the jokes from amongus
plane-crazy 2022-12-30 14:08:49 ok but seriously the baller meme sucks its just a repeat with nothing funny about it.

general 2023-01-09 15:10:59 you were 9 in 2020. and kept rejoining from your underage bans, ban evading if you will, which breaks another rule.

general 2023-01-09 15:21:57 thanks you dark cyan name
general 2023-01-09 15:23:02 but you can't buy access to bloxburg
general 2023-01-09 15:23:29 what size house you got
general 2023-01-09 15:23:50 holy shit portal reference?
general 2023-01-09 15:24:08 the starter house cant even buy you a fucking car dumbass
general 2023-01-09 15:26:20 you cant rob houses, have you even played bloxburg?
general 2023-01-09 15:26:49 your work does not get you 73k from 'sometimes', thats like 3 years if its once a week.
general 2023-01-09 15:27:33 how many times a week then?
general 2023-01-09 15:28:45 that would still take awhile. like over 7 months at the minimum.
general 2023-01-09 15:29:27 working in game only gives you like 250 per.
general 2023-01-09 15:29:57 but it would still take you awhile to level up once.
general 2023-01-09 15:30:41 therefor you would work for ***7 months at minimum***
general 2023-01-09 15:31:14 ***show me. oh right you fucking cant***
general 2023-01-09 15:31:28 none because I dont play the damn game anymore
general 2023-01-09 15:32:29 all jobs are boring and only exist to keep people playing.
general 2023-01-09 15:32:49 when was the update that they buffed jobs then?
general 2023-01-09 15:33:08 that you never mentioned and that you dont have.
general 2023-01-09 15:33:40 doesn't make you have actual friends
general 2023-01-09 15:34:17 also, you said you started in December. what December of what year?
general 2023-01-09 15:34:36 oh then your fucking lying so hard
general 2023-01-09 15:36:01 1 - you say you started in 2022 December. its a month later, probably less. and your saying you have 73k.
2 - you 'leveled up to get 500' but it would take you weeks to level up from the times you gave me.
3 - deleting the starter house doesn't give you much.
general 2023-01-09 15:36:47 I have rhythm game skills
general 2023-01-09 15:37:31 im learning to cook and have played the lyre before if that counts
general 2023-01-09 15:37:57 deleting the house gives you like 8k dude.
general 2023-01-09 15:38:42 there you go again with lying straight to our faces.
general 2023-01-09 15:39:36 mid summer of 2022
general 2023-01-09 15:40:39 you wanna know how much I got from consistently playing the game back then? ***19k.*** and from what I've seen the starter house hasn't changed since then.
general 2023-01-09 15:40:50 I deleted my starter house too, 8k gained.
general 2023-01-09 15:41:36 it was actual hours. I was grinding up to build a nice cabin home.
general 2023-01-09 15:42:19 don't know because guess who quit before he could build it
general 2023-01-09 15:42:42 sleep.
general 2023-01-09 15:43:29 wow nice comeback. maybe return to that mind palace of yours and think of actual ones, which that mind palace is probably filled with slenders dancing because of your 11 year old tiktok brain.
general 2023-01-09 15:44:28 you appear to be aswell if your trying so hard to convince me the starter house gives 40k when its small as fuck to where it wont.
general 2023-01-09 15:45:28 repeating your previous comebacks. what are you, the fat fuck from Tails gets Trolled who started it all?

general 2023-01-10 14:18:14 reverse searched and his a fucking liar

general 2023-01-10 14:19:03 whether it is or isn't your probably getting atleast a warning

general 2023-01-10 14:19:58 yeah
general 2023-01-10 14:20:18 because im not that gullible?
general 2023-01-10 14:20:46 a google image is not a fucking defeat, dumbass
general 2023-01-10 14:21:13 to balance one helium block with one ballast, try 5/10 on the ballast
general 2023-01-10 14:21:57 you showed me two googled badge images thats not defeating me
general 2023-01-10 14:22:26 english?
general 2023-01-10 14:23:14 its both googled images, reverse search pulls through
general 2023-01-10 14:24:01 for a push fun thing place a ballast on bottom and helium ontop, 3/10 on ballast. after launch it'll fall back down and you can push it around with ease without it falling over
general 2023-01-10 14:24:59 yeah and your first image is a google image.
general 2023-01-10 14:25:47 also to add insult to injury, what professional airport worker goes into a roblox discord server to advertise something to a bunch of teens and young adults?
general 2023-01-10 14:26:10 I didnt ping a mod yet to get rank
general 2023-01-10 14:26:57 your scam link is? zero fucking evidence its not a scam, ip grab, ect.
general 2023-01-10 14:27:16 you were literally swearing aswell
general 2023-01-10 14:28:06 whats your first language? because im saying that you have no proof its not a scam link
general 2023-01-10 14:28:47 server links are so much different dude you ain't fooling us
general 2023-01-10 14:29:59 30% of this server is inactive, infact over. it would be more believable if you said 3%
general 2023-01-10 14:32:44 English, dumbass. do you speak it? also, based upon this your trying to tell us there's alot more than 3% that joined. I think the percent that joined is in the negatives.
general 2023-01-10 14:34:06 if its a scam or not your still getting warned for advertising
general 2023-01-10 14:35:54 no lemme tell full story.
dude started advertising, this somehow turned into him trying to convince me he was a worker of cathay pacific. tried giving me proof, reverse image search made this proof a Google image, so he faked his proof.
general 2023-01-10 14:36:26 and since its not in the server his trying to convince the rest of the server that im in the wrong.
general 2023-01-10 14:36:58 yeah because the link seems to be a scam or ip grab
general 2023-01-10 14:37:39 very much so.
general 2023-01-10 14:38:46 didn't you say you were in your home when you sent it?
general 2023-01-10 14:39:01 nobody just records their work casually for no reason

general 2023-01-10 14:44:44 you just said that the more people click the more money you gain, thats not business.
general 2023-01-10 14:45:17 what worker of a professional airline comes into a roblox discord server to advertise a plane group with a sus as fuck link?
general 2023-01-10 14:46:07 scammer bitch got mad i reverse searched his proof and found out their Google. he also got warned by tech for advertising with sus link
general 2023-01-10 14:46:22 thats a very big deal, actually.
general 2023-01-10 14:47:41 people like me, aka pretty much everyone.
general 2023-01-10 14:48:48 if not everyone atleast tech. you get noticed by tech or fuzzy for a bad reason your getting a bad rep immediately if its something like ad-ing
general 2023-01-10 14:49:18 lies that have been reversed back to you by reverse search.
general 2023-01-10 14:50:09 all you've said are full lies. pie of lies.
general 2023-01-10 14:50:58 give me one thing you've said that is not a lie
general 2023-01-10 14:51:21 depends on context
general 2023-01-10 14:51:58 your fucking lying there too, welcome back to the 'To Catch a Scammer' show. I'm your host, world/average.
general 2023-01-10 14:52:42 <@573970670854340628>
general 2023-01-10 14:52:50 his continuing
general 2023-01-10 14:53:52 toxic for giving actual evidence to my claims?
general 2023-01-10 14:54:28 these are all random airport games not related to CPA
general 2023-01-10 14:55:17 learn how to fucking spell. if you work for CPA you would spell correctly
general 2023-01-10 14:55:52 said tuna
general 2023-01-10 14:57:24 said anime mabel from gravity falls
general 2023-01-10 14:57:54 pulling up reverse search
general 2023-01-10 14:59:37 looked at the proof, and lemme just say
general 2023-01-10 14:59:55 ***what airport, professional airport, makes a roblox game? let alone 3?***
general 2023-01-10 15:00:43 to add insult to injury, and I've said this twice
***what worker for an airport goes into a roblox discord server to advertise and break the rules to do so so they can scam teens and young adults.***
general 2023-01-10 15:01:24 because the games unpopular
general 2023-01-10 15:01:56 just get the fuck outta here, nobody believes you.
general 2023-01-10 15:03:16 I hate kebabs, make it papa John's hawaiian pizza
general 2023-01-10 15:03:59 so I'm toxic for proving you wrong? jesus christ your dumb. nobody believes you, why are you still here?
general 2023-01-10 15:04:57 scammer gets mad and calls me toxic for proving his proof wrong
general 2023-01-10 15:05:37 I didnt call the game a scam, fucking dumbas
general 2023-01-10 15:06:32 because its a sus link, no server invite is that long without being an ip grab
general 2023-01-10 15:07:50 welcome back to my show **'To catch a Scammer'** im your host **World/Average** and today we have a case where a scammer blows up in anger because I reverse searched his proof and proved him wrong.
general 2023-01-10 15:08:26 we arent on your cpa server though, get the fuck outta here.
general 2023-01-10 15:09:29 co-owner is madattak, he was only online yesterday.
general 2023-01-10 15:10:06 whys your join date December 21st 2022?
general 2023-01-10 15:11:22 its literally on your fucking profile how am I lying
general 2023-01-10 15:11:51 ping your other acc
general 2023-01-10 15:12:35 im gonna explain this argument you guys hold off the scammer bitch
general 2023-01-10 15:17:34 heres argument context for those who need it:
<@878127726773538816> started sending link scams, server started getting him out. I was one of em. he told us he was part of CPA (Cathay Pacific Airport) and I didn't believe him. everyone dropped it except for me and him. I told him to dm me proof, and he dm'd me two images of badges. quick reverse image search proved they were both from Google, and afterwards he came back here to advertise and make everyone think I was scamming him somehow? then tech warned him and everyone started wondering wtf was going on. more back and forth of proof being debunked, toxic claims, and side turning attempts until now.
general 2023-01-10 15:18:36 you did it was all debunked dumbass
general 2023-01-10 15:19:24 ah boy here we go again. apparently me and others debunking your claims is a lie?
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 15:25:00 proof I did see.
proof I debunked.
proof you lied about me not seeing.
general 2023-01-10 15:25:49 did he shut up?
general 2023-01-10 15:28:22 history books
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 15:30:04 debunked but lied, apparently? you inspect elemented dislikes to make them zero.
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 15:32:33 because it fucking is, your the guy who gave googled proof. I have more proof you literally aren't.
general 2023-01-10 15:32:58 thats not what I said? so far from it
general 2023-01-10 15:34:31 what if I do and I dont do anything? therefor you won't have a reason to ban me.
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 15:36:52 alright, first question
why would they have a discord server? let alone roblox games
general 2023-01-10 15:38:47 maybe zip that mouth shut, twjtter dumbass.
general 2023-01-10 15:39:36 up for it, same with orion.
general 2023-01-10 15:40:51 yogscast?
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 15:43:49 yeah but its just dumb. like hell theres over 20 good plane games out there just pay the developers to add the airports to their games
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 15:44:32 will in a sec, just got one more thing to say
plane-crazy 2023-01-10 15:45:38 no actual proper workers go into a roblox discord server to advertise their companies discord server to teens. and now lemme block this Orion guy im fucking done with this.
general 2023-01-10 15:48:39 alright so orions fucking mad
general 2023-01-10 15:48:57 says he wasn't advertising but he was in reality I think his just a dumbass
general 2023-01-10 15:49:18 so I'm out of that argument, that is finally over with, Jesus fucking christ.
general 2023-01-10 15:51:14 its one of the rare few species that can eat chocolate without being poisoned

general 2023-01-11 13:38:57 I dont get this plane conversation, my slowly developing brain cannot understand
general 2023-01-11 13:39:58 guys madattak is online
general 2023-01-11 13:43:39 I know like nothing about planes despite having a game about building planes in my favorites
general 2023-01-11 13:44:37 because I spent that knowledge on trains and now aperture
general 2023-01-11 13:45:44 me knowing half the lamp signals for trains:
general 2023-01-11 13:46:17 N2, specifically the one in preservation by I think the GNW? forgot the proper name
general 2023-01-11 13:47:21 N2 is 0-6-2 which is kinda a favorite in my book
general 2023-01-11 13:47:37 put an N2 in black and you got my vote
general 2023-01-11 13:48:24 yeah, ryan, but I preferred n2's before he was added to the show way back when
general 2023-01-11 13:49:54 idk but you gotta admit their pretty nice
general 2023-01-11 13:50:59 been thinking of actually building an N2 for rails
general 2023-01-11 13:51:07 would definitely be a fun project
general 2023-01-11 13:52:20 mallards kinda a classic
general 2023-01-11 13:52:39 but flying scotsman is arguably the most famous

creations-chat 2023-01-13 02:12:00 like for the paint? try dark colors, or like ciclano said, add some detail to more parts. whether it just be exhaust pipes or somethin.

also <@577930642520801301> where i would recommend for changing is in small parts, like the connections between the ring and middle or the tip of the middle.

general 2023-01-17 16:16:35 its more for a story build im gonna make. literally just based off portal the game. wake up, get talked to by some robot, you walk through a portal, and you join a tech testing game.

general 2023-01-17 16:17:23 its for a story build

general 2023-01-18 13:42:13 fucking dumb, it was only meant to be in youtube comments anyways.
general 2023-01-18 13:44:03 yuo
general 2023-01-18 13:45:38 saw someone playing plane crazy the other day and claiming they built the "best plane ever".

plane-crazy 2023-01-18 13:50:21 
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 13:52:43 anyways,
do you all take getting called a 'tutorial build' as a compliment or as an insult?
plane-crazy 2023-01-18 14:34:43 or just build the canopy using blocks and angle lock the trails
general 2023-01-18 14:36:34 lure them to a convention and bomb the place. not only will you get your target but you'll also wipe out even more.

general 2023-01-18 14:39:48 yeah but is that harmful?
general 2023-01-18 14:40:12 don't use a plane, those are too trackable.
general 2023-01-18 14:41:44 planes have lights on them usually, thats why I would recommend sneaking in via a boxtruck.
general 2023-01-18 14:42:53 I have a few friends who are furries, their pretty normal people. the most they do is talk about their experiences with furries.

general 2023-01-20 15:06:02 so delete a build you dont use anymore
general 2023-01-20 15:06:13 that's what pretty much all of us do
general 2023-01-20 15:07:05 why would you be there without having your build poaded

creations-chat 2023-01-20 15:37:34 I wouldn't recommend letting that slide. with the upvotes its getting, he can redeem it for a rank. you won't get it because you didn't post it.

I will ask one thing tho, would you be fine with me building a train museum based off your BR 80? got pretty inspired and it would be a nice way to show off my build skills.
creations-chat 2023-01-20 15:44:24 doesn't fix it fully, as your profiting off his build. you can literally redeem it for designer 3 rn and he won't get it because he didn't post it
creations-chat 2023-01-20 15:47:00 just delete it before a mod gets here and warns you
creations-chat 2023-01-20 15:57:42 btw, chimla, would yiu be fine with me building a train museum based off your BR 80? I'm not talking about copying it, instead building trains in the style and displaying them. would you be fine with me doing that?
creations-chat 2023-01-20 16:16:22 first off make it actually a Ferrari if your calling it that
second off, since your going for a stock racecar, try making the backwing thing a bit more sleek

general 2023-01-23 03:53:48 also your literally talking about roblox moderation it's bad enough

general 2023-01-27 15:54:24 tip for being here:
rarely call people by their usernames
general 2023-01-27 15:54:48 most people might find it oddly weird, me being one of those people
general 2023-01-27 15:59:05 anyways how's ya'lls fridays? and if its not friday for you how's ya'lls fries?
general 2023-01-27 16:29:48 yes they prefer that

creations-chat 2023-01-29 00:12:04 learning to motorlock just for a train.
creations-chat 2023-01-29 00:16:07 jesus how do you guys do this for builds regularly
creations-chat 2023-01-29 00:18:17 no issues, surprisingly. i just find it decently difficult to figure it all out. and how im gonna fit it in the whole space, like jesus the entire boiler and smokebox will be locked.
creations-chat 2023-01-29 00:20:19 GNR N2, specifically the one in preservation at the North Norfolk Railway. engine 1744. 0-6-2 for wheel config. really annoying to get made but it'll be worth it.
creations-chat 2023-01-29 00:23:51 thats kinda an issue to do with the train system im using.
creations-chat 2023-01-29 00:26:01 honestly, thats what im doing. the only issue is getting the funnel placed.
creations-chat 2023-01-29 00:33:01 hows this lookin so far?
creations-chat 2023-01-29 01:54:44 so heres the train so far, pretty far from finished. let me know what i can do to improve for when i finish. very much a beginner at motorlock, i was only using what i know.
creations-chat 2023-01-29 03:16:44 i wasnt gonna have it do that
this system is to make it rock back and forth when being hit
creations-chat 2023-01-29 05:15:47 tf do you mean motorlock the wheels? im a beginner at this shit i dont know what you mean
creations-chat 2023-01-29 05:21:13 im a **beginner** i cant do this
just because i did it with a boiler doesnt mean i can do literally anything
creations-chat 2023-01-29 05:23:18 i get that but you gotta understand, not everyone can do everything right off the bat.
creations-chat 2023-01-29 06:21:21 i made a passenger car for my train but when pulling it with the bogey down it just stops moving, but when its up it works fine. is there any way to fix that>
creations-chat 2023-01-30 02:13:14 update to the train, coach 1 is done
creations-chat 2023-01-30 02:15:18 have you been inside a coach before? there are no seatbelts
creations-chat 2023-01-30 02:17:21 game regulations do not require me to, therefor i shall not. welcome to plane crazy, where the only death is you resetting or falling off the edge from your stupidity.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 02:21:59 https://tenor.com/view/lizard-dancing-lizard-cry-about-it-gecko-dance-gif-20175430
creations-chat 2023-01-30 02:24:15 game regulations do not require me to. also its smooth enough to where they arent needed.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 02:26:48 but your regulations are not inflicted unless your in the server.
and i rarely use the vip's.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 02:28:58 correct. as its not your territory, therefor your regulations cannot be inflicted.
general 2023-01-30 13:37:58 e wave
creations-chat 2023-01-30 14:03:11 <@639374429532717056> they weren't originally, there was a conversation going on.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 14:05:23 theres like 3 things wrong
1: Pain was using gifs and videos to bypass it, so that he could speak in a conversation.
2: You didn't see it, so your defending the one in the wrong.
3: Its probably breaking some form of rule.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 14:07:36 no wonder your still a whitename, fjcking dumbass. maybe you should read up a bit on stuff some more.
plane-crazy 2023-01-30 14:08:43 hey <@573970670854340628> we got a dispute going on creations, started with a dude using images to bypass speaking there.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 14:09:55 its literally so simple to get a rank.
build something pretty good
pray the upvotes outweigh the downvotes
get a rank ticket
and jsut wait
general 2023-01-30 14:13:46 the 'gay polish femboy' joke has gotten old, we need a sequel.
general 2023-01-30 14:29:47 I understand the 3% unsure tho, sometimes being obese can be genetic and not a choice you make.
general 2023-01-30 14:53:09 understood.
general 2023-01-30 14:56:57 yeah but the point still stands
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:08:00 or dont make planes in general. make like 1 or 2 and you'll be fine.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:12:00 reject planes, return to train.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:16:31 learn to good train
that's actually what I'm doing in-game, I've been learning motorlock and using trains as a way to test, aswell as learn to make better trains
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:26:17 building a plane for the 1872th time will never have the same experience as building another train. every train class is different in some way, whether it be wheel configuration or boiler size. while every plane is disputing over which one isn't a copycat of another with minimal changes.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:28:51 me.
I dont like it.
because war trains exist aswell.
also if you enjoy doing the same thing over and over with only small changes, your insanity has gone too far.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:31:32 every single plane is similar to another in some way, I get that a passenger plane isn't similar to a biplane but a passenger plane from America is similar to a passenger plane from Japan.
I get trains can be like that aswell and thats why I build everything except vehicles sometimes.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:33:37 it was originally about all types of planes till it had to be military jets because of total creativity.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:36:07 planes have their supremacists too, its why they flood creations chat to the point where we get chains of them in a row.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:39:26 you see theres a thing called gauges
another called trains that run on the plots
creations-chat 2023-01-30 19:07:25 hey so im boutta make the second coach to my motorlock train, anything i should change about this one before doing so?
creations-chat 2023-01-30 19:10:05 so your calling it terrible, sorry for asking for advice on something my guy. not like this is my ***first time doing one of these extreme motorlock builds***
creations-chat 2023-01-30 19:12:34 and you dont need to give me shit for trying to atleast learn. would you rather me try and improve or just do nothing? i was asking for advice, not god damn "everything" as an answer with nothing else.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 19:14:48 people to try and help when they want quality builds
creations-chat 2023-01-30 19:22:43 something i may change on the coach though is the paintjob, changing the browns to reds. would that look good?
creations-chat 2023-01-30 19:24:57 please remove yourself from existance via 518 chicken nuggets, you dont have the right to speak anymore due to all this.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 20:13:29 issue with the text and door is that im using half blocks so it'll still look like shit.
also i dont fully know how to do detailed windows yet.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 20:15:38 literally said it was a learnin experience during that, mate. if it was learning then its probably not gonna be that good.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 21:21:13 whenever i use emojis they get tagged. also, i dont really like using materials unless their strictly required. taking ice and fabric as an example.
and i get that i dont need motorlock, im using the train as a learning experience. its not something im gonna post in creations and pass it off as good, because its not.
general 2023-01-31 13:41:17 probably will
general 2023-01-31 15:31:07 most fun server general to watch

general 2023-01-31 16:00:26 no, its taxes. I'm talking about the prison cells. tax money helps the prisons stay open, therefor their the powerhouse of the cell.
general 2023-01-31 16:01:13 cell phones are more motherboard than anything else
general 2023-01-31 16:02:15 but is plastic the powerhouse then?
general 2023-01-31 16:02:38 the meaning to life has been solved
general 2023-01-31 16:03:47 I prefer the dust from stress toys
general 2023-01-31 16:04:46 how do you pronounce data? I pronounce it data but others pronounce it data.
general 2023-01-31 16:05:27 I only go with data because its easier for me to say
general 2023-01-31 16:05:54 and if your saying it letter by letter, your going to an insane asylum.
general 2023-01-31 16:06:57 I more like data due to pronunciation issues but yours sounds cool too
general 2023-01-31 16:07:59 did we just have a full conversation on the pronouncing of data when it cant even be shown
general 2023-01-31 16:08:10 or heard, I mean
general 2023-01-31 16:10:10 he does have friends dumbass

which jsut vomited in your eye.
general 2023-01-31 16:18:27 meme with
general 2023-02-01 14:05:07 i like and hate chess.
its pretty fun but I have terrible planning ahead when it comes to board games.
general 2023-02-01 14:06:04 most we've gotten is the clock dlc, which adds turn timelimits.
general 2023-02-01 14:08:48 aswell as the buyable crystal skins.
general 2023-02-01 14:10:11 the most planning i have is a wavy pattern of pawns
general 2023-02-01 14:16:58 battleship, I feel, is pretty pog
general 2023-02-01 14:17:55 theres some strategy involved, but mainly its just praying
general 2023-02-01 14:18:17 got that the first time dumbass
general 2023-02-01 14:19:05 place ships then try to shoot down your opponents ships while not being able to see them
general 2023-02-01 14:19:36 what about a card game that doesn't require strategy and is only a bit luck based
aka exploding kittens
general 2023-02-01 14:20:57 basic concept is you have to draw a card to end your turn, but theres a chance an explosion card will be drawn. you have to play a defuse card to survive otherwise you fail.
general 2023-02-01 14:21:53 theres other cards too that force other players to play 2 turns without you having to draw to end yours, one that stops another players action, one that allows you to see the top 3 cards of the draw pile, ect.
general 2023-02-01 14:22:18 its one of my favorite games ngl

general 2023-02-02 15:16:42 IT DOES
general 2023-02-02 15:18:17 me and the boys shall do a small amount of mental trickery and mockery of those unfortunate enough to fall victim to our tricks.
general 2023-02-02 15:20:58 we're a month into 2023 and we're tryna bash it this early
general 2023-02-02 16:02:34 literally do not give a damn
general 2023-02-02 16:02:49 a tier is a tier
general 2023-02-02 16:24:13 what about other stuff like a fuckin stationary display build? those usually get like 60-70 or somethin only if their pretty damn good
general 2023-02-02 16:27:35 what if we lower 4 to 70, 3 to 50? usually for most people those numbers are kinda hard to get.
general 2023-02-02 16:28:34 ive literally just been here watching im not fully sure what the hell your talking about fully
general 2023-02-02 16:29:27 do that for rank 4 designer aswell probably
general 2023-02-02 16:34:03 its already bad enough when over half my builds get that, it takes away my courage to ask for help aswell. because all im gonna be told is to delete the entire build instead of try to improve it.
general 2023-02-02 16:39:19 one thing I agree with tho is changing the expert amount, like I got the amount needed just with a ro-scale glados that took me like an hour to make.
general 2023-02-02 16:43:59 terrain

general 2023-02-02 17:34:44 hi again chat
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 13:40:58 i mean ive built a full sentry turret from tf2 without motorlock so its quite literally 'build heights the limit'
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 13:42:18 the only issue with my builds though seems to be color pallete and style
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 13:43:11 I like doing poly-style builds but nearly everyone just goes "its not smooth enough!!!" pretty much
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 13:45:32 as for color pallete, when I post the builds the pallete i use is either too light or too dark.
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 13:46:16 I like fuckin around with making custom colors though tbh
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 13:46:58 need a black that has a slight shade? 0 0 45.
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 13:47:23 which can also represent oil if turned to foil material
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 14:02:46 since I've kinda learned motorlock, would anyone be willing to help me learn angelock tomorrow?
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 14:04:12 k, ill be in vip1 tmr. what time in est?
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 14:05:59 aight
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 14:06:15 death star making?
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 14:07:45 "#cancel[famousperson]" nearly everywhere
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 14:08:09 exposed motorlock, essentially when you can see motorlock on the finished build.
plane-crazy 2023-02-03 14:11:40 ball 3x3
general 2023-02-03 14:14:43 which according to others means deleting the entire fucking build
general 2023-02-03 14:17:18 thats literally ro-scale irl
general 2023-02-03 14:18:12 thats a build with 32 upvotes mg
general 2023-02-03 14:18:52 build stolen?
general 2023-02-03 14:23:51 rockje johnson
general 2023-02-03 14:31:49 lmao

plane-crazy 2023-02-03 14:44:45 in the game it looks like a damn ladder from the side
general 2023-02-03 14:49:31 looks like a god damn model railroad destination
general 2023-02-03 14:50:20 to you it might not, to me it does
general 2023-02-04 05:53:36 its 1am should I sleep or finish building this giant fuckinv project I cant even post in creations
general 2023-02-04 05:55:16 shut yourself, your the dude who was literally changing name colors to make me look colorblind.

general 2023-02-06 14:12:08 what about tower defense games, like PvZ and BTD?
general 2023-02-06 14:13:33 their both good in their own ways.
general 2023-02-06 14:15:08 PvZ is good for casual play while still offering a decent challenge in the pool levels and onwards
BTD is good for training your strategic planning while being different enough from the competition
general 2023-02-06 14:15:58 also both have good soundtracks
general 2023-02-06 14:17:13 fumos are pog tho
general 2023-02-06 14:18:20 hope you turned off the @ there
general 2023-02-06 14:20:01 boutta write a damn short story on why I should be unbanned

general 2023-02-07 14:08:47 but my point also stands.

general 2023-02-07 14:10:10 but can you stop me from talking? no, welcome to the pcc.

general 2023-02-07 16:19:52 well more semi 2d, you can change camera angles, its just moving in 3d in a 2d space at that point though.
plane-crazy 2023-02-07 16:23:57 nobody did
general 2023-02-08 16:01:49 I saw an emoji fail for once
general 2023-02-08 16:02:56 pov: new player tank

the-dump 2023-02-10 20:14:06 its more than a masterpiece
the-dump 2023-02-10 20:14:10 its perfection
the-dump 2023-02-10 20:14:45 but its a fan version
the-dump 2023-02-10 20:15:17 also fair use <:clueless:942802644043464734>
the-dump 2023-02-10 20:15:56 but does yours have a watermark?
the-dump 2023-02-10 20:16:57 intense editing commence
the-dump 2023-02-10 20:19:02 but its not watermarked by you
therefor
its watermarked by fuzzy
the-dump 2023-02-10 20:19:54 it belongs to you and fuzzy then
the-dump 2023-02-10 20:20:07 therefor
its technically fair use
the-dump 2023-02-10 20:20:37 well now you will be
the-dump 2023-02-10 20:21:43 but it doesn't have your name on it

the-dump 2023-02-10 20:22:32 also trademark is ***trade***
the-dump 2023-02-10 20:22:47 fak yuo
plane-crazy 2023-02-17 20:42:08 public server people remind me that children love to pretend their better than they really are. a 11 year old at most was going around arguing with everyone over how good their builds were. his builds literally looked like something you would see in a kindergarden. he started talking about how good he was at pvp so i told him to build a mouse controlled turret and he started looking up a tutorial to do one before he bypassed a slur and left. i lose faith in these people everyday.
plane-crazy 2023-02-17 20:42:48 this was a non-pvp server too
general 2023-02-21 14:43:30 chat im alive
general 2023-02-21 14:47:24 hola, chat. been awhile.
general 2023-02-21 14:48:13 so my laptop charger stopped working
general 2023-02-21 14:49:05 still isn't working, but im kinda fine with it now, I've needed a break from that thing anyways.
general 2023-02-21 14:49:23 considering the ***49 hours on plane crazy just this week.***
general 2023-02-21 14:50:03 listen building a lab for like 2 months can take a toll on you
general 2023-02-21 14:59:51 seems like returning was a mistake, people still tell others to delete entire builds which pulls us down.
general 2023-02-21 15:05:12 @computerexpert10110
general 2023-02-21 15:07:23 your gonna die in there
general 2023-02-22 15:01:23 sometimes watching general chat is like a movie.
general 2023-02-23 16:37:13 yippee
the-dump 2023-02-24 14:41:00 a -7
the-dump 2023-02-24 14:43:00 so your pissing off the screen
general 2023-02-27 16:22:11 british people actually sound pretty pog in my opinion
general 2023-02-27 16:23:12 one response sticks out against the people getting me to drink cleaning supplies, nice.
general 2023-02-27 16:24:29 not like pog as in cool people, more their accents. accents are pretty cool things in my opinion.
general 2023-02-27 16:25:26 the hell is the point of that? sorry for liking something.
general 2023-02-27 16:26:09 get friciked

general 2023-02-28 15:48:10 first message I've seen from you and I immediately am thinking underage. probably wrong but the mother joke with the laughing emoji caused that reaction for me.

general 2023-02-28 16:38:02 cat sammish
general 2023-02-28 16:39:35 this cat is in the wrong, their sleeping with a pillow.
general 2023-03-01 03:53:05 take that shit for a ride round walmart and your playing mario kart with that thing
general 2023-03-01 03:53:33 200cc
general 2023-03-01 14:19:03 hello chat
general 2023-03-01 14:48:32 I think we need to overthrow the cats in <#917397949938548736> , what do you guys say we do so with dogs?
general 2023-03-01 14:51:22 geometry dash song
kinda underwhelming for the stage
general 2023-03-01 14:52:20 yeah but the beat drop at the fly part is the only good part and the fly part isn't even hard
general 2023-03-01 14:53:23 yeah because you go from that to back on track which im pretty sure has triple spikes and is called easy
general 2023-03-01 14:53:56 not many, barely even play the game anymore so
general 2023-03-01 14:55:36 any form of core fucking sucks. but add rain ambience and suddenly you have 500k views.
general 2023-03-01 14:57:11 lo-fi isn't a form of core most of the time. lo-fi green hill remixes are actually kinda good.
general 2023-03-01 14:58:48 same, I like to listen to stuff like that while building at night, its just kinda calming y'know?
especially for when your motor gets caught on something for the 50th time and its annoying to fix.
general 2023-03-01 15:00:25 then try out "Forwarding the Cause of Science" from the Portal 2 OST while building your next mechanical build, it fits pretty damn well when building mechanical stuff and I dont know why
general 2023-03-01 15:02:22 seen it, satisfying as fuck man
general 2023-03-03 15:40:51 hello chat

general 2023-03-03 15:44:13 because of delays
general 2023-03-03 15:45:12 im fine with being called a furry, honestly, but if it gets to the point where you unironically are calling me one and calling me a bad person for me supposedly being one, that's where it becomes an issue.
general 2023-03-03 15:45:31 ill take one for the team
general 2023-03-03 15:46:13 <@573970670854340628> hey we got an image spammer here, can we get this bitch muted please?

general 2023-03-03 15:52:20 whys the brick coming from behind them
general 2023-03-03 15:52:41 its not
general 2023-03-03 15:52:52 you dont deserve the expert rank if your this unfunny.
general 2023-03-03 15:53:17 never said I did
general 2023-03-03 15:53:43 infact, im fine without it. your claim to humor is sending images over and over hoping to catch someone in a trap.

general 2023-03-03 15:57:31 does that matter when it comes to humor?
general 2023-03-03 15:57:51 I built a mechanical glados that would've gotten me expert but it didn't get me expert.
general 2023-03-03 15:59:39 whenever I post something there now, even if its a cat, it gets deleted. why tf
general 2023-03-03 16:00:08 im not even event blacklisted
general 2023-03-03 16:00:47 I've been here for like 3 months, that does not count as new anymore.
general 2023-03-03 16:01:45 your the guy spamming the same image over and over trying to be funny. your like the class clown who drags out a joke for too long.
general 2023-03-03 16:02:17 neither are you, dumbass.
general 2023-03-03 16:02:25 watch out kids, the person calling me a furry is a spammer who definitely doesn't deserve expert rank.
general 2023-03-03 16:02:54 keep sending the same image and see where it gets you.
general 2023-03-03 16:03:31 not even a threat. its actually pretty fucking annoying now.
general 2023-03-03 16:04:15 that pointing technically made it look like your the nerd emoji.
general 2023-03-03 16:04:55 yeah your goals just to make me mad now, I can fuckin tell. have fun being unfunny as hell, mzte.
general 2023-03-03 16:13:19 (impossible)

general 2023-03-03 16:22:53 betting someone's gonna put a speech bubble on this message
general 2023-03-03 16:23:55 why the barrel

general 2023-03-03 16:29:46 can't do that for awhile because nobody is gonna give me actual tips and instead tell me to delete all my builds.

general 2023-03-08 16:22:52 this turned from talking about how much we love portal and its community to reciting the ads
general 2023-03-08 16:46:11 how did they know it was ww1 if ww2 hadn't happened yet
general 2023-03-08 16:48:27 oh, im dumb.

general 2023-03-10 13:41:47 ello chat
general 2023-03-10 13:53:29 bottom right corner
general 2023-03-10 13:53:56 theres not much chance theres a bomb in the exact bottom right
general 2023-03-10 13:54:05 but if there is im fuckin sorry dude
general 2023-03-10 13:55:14 well we know there's a 1
general 2023-03-10 13:56:13 so you see that 1 between the 3 and 4 right above the bottom right corner your tryna clear?
general 2023-03-10 13:56:21 theres probably one right below that
general 2023-03-10 13:56:27 linking to the 3 and r
general 2023-03-10 13:56:45 because if there was one on both sides, you would have a 2
general 2023-03-10 13:57:32 ye
general 2023-03-10 13:57:58 I said it might be a bomb, so uh
general 2023-03-10 13:58:26 but I was right, there was a bomb there
general 2023-03-10 14:01:32 hm
general 2023-03-10 14:02:16 referring to the bottom right cleared ones, theres probably one below either of the 2's as the one in the corner would just be 1 if it were below the 4.
general 2023-03-10 14:02:57 so now we just gotta find out which 2 its below
general 2023-03-10 14:04:14 rip

plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:41:03 and an autoclicker won't help, haven't tested paint bucket.

-event item
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:45:40 its interesting to think about tho
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:45:56 yeah, gold bars were around for like a week
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:46:13 what would you guys say is the most useless
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:46:29 yeah, just use fabric
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:47:11 I got em too
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:47:20 I just barely use them lol
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:47:34 I've only used them in a damn bank build for the vault
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:48:28 yeah, just wait for the events to start. if rick ever starts them
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:48:57 you dont need gamepasses to make a good build tho
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:50:03 like all gamepasses do is make it easier or give you some slight additions. like speakers
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:50:32 yeah, you get people rickrolling constantly
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:50:36 if they were free
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:50:54 sounds, thats all I use them for.
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:51:14 got a robot your building? add some mechanical sounds for the leg movements.
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:51:32 got a plane with a propeller custom-made? add some propeller sounds
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:51:54 heard their removing that sometime this year.
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:52:09 dunno if its true or not but
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:53:52 yeah. if it is reverted, I hope roblox actually listens past the first 15 seconds to get past the "AUDIO BY [username]" thing
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 13:54:40 plane crazy

plane-crazy 2023-03-14 14:11:51 so I had ideas for portal test chamber elements i could make so I could form actual test chambers, just without the portals
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 14:12:41 yeah I know but you cant have stuff in the exact same spot as you left them if their unanchofed
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 14:12:50 such as the cubes
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 14:13:35 i know how to do the duplicate room, but I want it to feel like an actual damn test chamber
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 14:14:08 how is it portal if there is no puzzle solving
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 14:14:20 literally in some tests you dont even have to use portale
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 14:14:30 if your skilled
plane-crazy 2023-03-14 14:15:45 I might try putting them in the old aperture style, so that it makes sense why there isn't portals yet

general 2023-03-24 16:32:59 simple solution: understand that this entire server is a circus, we are nearly never serious.

general 2023-03-28 12:48:11 think it was like, rise of lyric or smth, not sure.
general 2023-03-28 12:51:05 fuckin really? arm color was worth breaking the law for, alright, sonic fandom was still insane back then.
general 2023-03-28 12:52:09 y'know, the only thing wrong with this image is the middle icon at the bottom.

general 2023-03-28 12:59:38 I technically have this but when you dont know even a quarter of the info at the beginning of the school year its kinda annoying because you can't just breeze through it, you have to do the classes or try and google like 15 things at once.
general 2023-03-28 13:00:49 I thought you were managing to misspell frog
general 2023-03-28 15:38:20 what did I just walk into
general 2023-03-28 15:39:15 "sir you have been trialed for 20 years in prison."
"double it and give it to the next person."
general 2023-03-28 15:39:48 I think techs just too lazy to warn you man
general 2023-03-28 15:40:46 breaking a mirror makes more mirrors
general 2023-03-28 15:41:23 instead theres double standards to hell and back
general 2023-03-28 15:43:30 double standards fucking suck balls tho. theres plenty of cases i can't talk about but in them, women went to jail despite having committed actual bad crimes and in one of them they committed murder with their partner. the man was tried for life, the woman? 80 years, they thought she was dragged into it despite her admitting to coming up with the idea, but the cops didn't fucking believe her.
general 2023-03-28 15:44:43 yeah but thats still what they gave
general 2023-03-28 15:46:18 yeah give everyone the same amount of time for the same crime. like, I accidentally cause a car crash? like a year. this woman committed actual pedophilic acts? 8 months probably.
general 2023-03-28 15:47:02 because people simp for women because their just barely in the lesser population
general 2023-03-28 15:47:37 isn't it like 49.7%

general 2023-03-29 13:02:20 jesus christ. thats worse than my adhd experiences and mine are pretty bad ngl
general 2023-03-29 13:06:54 I genuinely do have adhd. undiagnosed but my mom has diagnosed adhd and I have almost all the symptoms so I guess I have it then. my dad is aware of the whole adhd thing and still gets mad at me when my brain wants to do something other than what he wants to do after like half an hour of doing it.
general 2023-03-29 13:18:04 my dumbass thought this was lego for a few seconds because of the tires

general 2023-04-03 14:43:02 therefore we are all below caveman.
general 2023-04-03 14:43:25 but then I would be above

general 2023-04-03 14:45:28 I would only remind the cooking teacher because cooking is actually a good skill to know

general 2023-04-04 13:53:32 actually run while you can, this place corrupts
general 2023-04-04 13:54:36 let me tell you the story of the war between the colors
general 2023-04-04 13:55:34 well its more an explanation.
here, whitenames and any rank besides expert are essentially peasants, always have been.
general 2023-04-04 13:56:02 you, currently, are a whitename. aka a no-rank.
general 2023-04-04 13:57:02 this server is racist in its colors. because we hate how races go. screw the f1 drivers
general 2023-04-04 13:58:32 so your offended by yourself
general 2023-04-04 13:59:36 sir I am 2 ranks above you in designer you cannot be talking. we are both peasants but ones higher than the other.
general 2023-04-04 14:00:29 and I am fine with this
general 2023-04-04 14:01:00 your acting like a fucking expert when you joined a week ago and didn't talk until now.
general 2023-04-04 14:04:37 enough of the argument, here's some advice from one peasant to another.
1- dumbass questions will land you in monitored appearances. such as asking how to get a role, which your guilty of.
2- we hate femboys here. if you are one, fuck off, your not trusted here and never will be according to the majority of experts.
3- build good god damn it, otherwise we have gifs for insulting you.
4- low ranks are low ranks, and we can only change that by getting upvote percentages in <#384025409945337856> 
5- ping tech only for moderation things, nobody else.

general 2023-04-13 16:28:11 there is no correct way, its just fun to ask it to describe the story of something and see how much it gets wrong.

general 2023-04-17 14:48:52 drink enough from it and it becomes 99% water, it levels up overtime, its not a glitch its an intentional feature
general 2023-04-17 14:49:45 piss tea
general 2023-04-17 14:50:35 hope mine is, foam is the best part
general 2023-04-17 14:51:02 shrimp likes foam

general 2023-04-24 15:07:27 role racism is a massive aftereffect of fishing season
general 2023-04-24 15:08:10 its hard enough to find a good physics based sandbox game on roblox imo
general 2023-04-24 15:08:26 plane crazy's are fine in some situations and better in others
general 2023-04-24 15:08:39 each system has those strengths and weaknesses you gotta keep in mind
general 2023-04-24 15:10:26 yet your literally comparing it to everything else, just let it be what it is instead of tearing its physics system to shreds
general 2023-04-24 15:11:19 actually it can compare. I've played the game and built some stuff, cars for example. nothing really to do once you have a build made.
general 2023-04-24 15:11:38 ive went on
general 2023-04-24 15:13:05 nah bro i think I've done a fine job of not mixing things. if you want me to name more i can name more
general 2023-04-24 15:13:58 theres nothing really to it, its more of a bruhchanica 2 than plane crazy 2
general 2023-04-24 15:15:12 its boring as all hell to do anything in the game, even building which is the entire purpose of the game. plane crazy atleast tries to have some personality
general 2023-04-24 15:15:35 i can argue that
general 2023-04-24 15:16:40 because of plane crazy's basic mechanics, it allows for easiness to learn and test. with flightpoint everything is shoved in your face expecting you to get it all instantly
general 2023-04-24 15:17:13 and yours are?
general 2023-04-24 15:17:48 also maybe learn to spell before getting into an argument here, people are fierce about stuff like that
general 2023-04-24 15:18:38 what a basic response
general 2023-04-24 15:18:53 plane crazy vs flightpoint
general 2023-04-24 15:19:15 correct
general 2023-04-24 15:19:50 since when was i insulting? you called me a crybaby like 5 times before I said you had bad grammar and basic responses
general 2023-04-24 15:20:28 to be fair everyone's is in an argument
general 2023-04-24 15:21:03 and I can walk on watermelons which makes that correct
general 2023-04-24 15:21:58 theres alot of situations this reminds me of, specifically the ones where someone doesn't understand jokes during arguments exist
general 2023-04-24 15:22:32 melon race the forgotten gmod gamemode
general 2023-04-24 15:23:34 can we round that and make it 90%
general 2023-04-24 15:24:12 thanks for rounding
general 2023-04-24 15:24:26 I diverted the argument to melons
general 2023-04-24 15:24:50 basic comeback 2
general 2023-04-24 15:25:27 wait hold on the full amount then would be 184% jesus
general 2023-04-24 15:25:53 cod lobby level argument
general 2023-04-24 15:26:42 your takin this seriously finally when we diverted this to melons wtf is your brain
general 2023-04-24 15:27:55 you clearly care if your tryna insult me even more mate
general 2023-04-24 15:28:16 yeah we can let bygons be bygons finally

general 2023-05-09 14:55:48 yet i still this it was a true ban
general 2023-05-09 14:56:01 you don't need to be reported to be banned my guy
general 2023-05-09 14:57:02 you had that account set up as bait despite using it to get into arguments 24/7 here and bragging in someone's dm's that you'll come back bigger and better
general 2023-05-09 14:57:26 they're probably right
general 2023-05-09 14:57:32 yeah

plane-crazy 2023-07-08 00:18:57 i still have to go through annoyance to color text
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 00:19:37 i hopped into the game with no save loaded
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 00:19:46 placed 2 signs to test
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 00:20:24 i can click the text just fine without the paint tool equipped, but with? goes back to being click-editable.
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 00:21:21 no, didnt work
plane-crazy 2023-07-08 00:21:36 so in general its just the exact same as it was originally
bug-reports 2023-07-08 00:28:00 well the update kinda worked but also doesnt aswell, cant color text no matter what without coloring another block and moving my mouse over the text. its minor but fucking annoying anyways.
bug-reports 2023-07-08 00:30:55 oh and heres that debug menu
creations-chat 2023-07-08 01:15:04 how do i make blocks go under my plot? need it for a build rq and i cannot get it to happen for the life of me
creations-chat 2023-07-08 01:35:43 update: scrapping the build for now until i can actually find a reason to build it other than novelty
creations-chat 2023-07-08 01:37:48 insead, gonna try building a mars rover.
bug-reports 2023-07-08 02:19:54 ill check that in a minute
