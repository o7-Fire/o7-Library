creations-chat 2019-05-07 21:33:12 I tried to recreate a submarine from a game on the Nintendo 3DS called "Steel Diver: Sub Wars", the sub itself is called "Sea Marine"

creations-chat 2019-06-07 03:48:45 Another micro plane for the Microscopic Engineer role... Kinda hard to control but should be good for the job... the propeller at the back has reverse thrust on...

bug-reports 2019-07-23 00:48:00 is it ok if i post a quick video clip of my bug?
bug-reports 2019-07-23 00:48:14 or does it have to be gyazo or something like that?
bug-reports 2019-07-23 00:54:02 anyways, I find these 2 things with the motor pretty annoying... 1st is the motors rotate on their own when launching your creation and 2 the motors can get really shaky when they have the reset thing on.
bug-reports 2019-07-23 01:03:33 This is a clip of the motors moving when not supposed to at launch
bug-reports 2019-07-23 01:04:05 and this is a clip of the motors shaking hard when they have the reset box checked
bug-reports 2019-07-23 01:18:04 no
bug-reports 2019-07-23 01:18:15 should i have it on?
bug-reports 2019-07-23 01:35:40 ye
bug-reports 2019-07-23 01:35:42 i tried
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 15:12:42 Are those underwater propellers out rn from development yet?
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 15:12:52 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 15:13:31 Once they're out I wanna update my submarine I made
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 15:13:59 it has too many propellers in it
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:35:01 found a guy writing inappropriate content on their plot
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 01:36:14 oh ok
help 2019-08-10 01:37:12 found a guy writing inappropriate stuff on their plot, i do not want to post an image of the problem here because its just bad
help 2019-08-10 01:37:40 aight
help 2019-08-10 01:40:04 So yeah, this guy was writing NSFW stuff on their plot (as mentioned before)
creations-chat 2019-08-10 03:26:58 I recreated the core from portal/portal 2, its eyes are fully movable and so are its bar/arm things.
creations-chat 2019-08-10 03:37:41 
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 19:53:14 are all the pieces hidden on land?
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 19:53:26 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 19:53:50 well i feel dumb trying to find a piece underwater with my sub
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 20:01:09 how many pieces are there to get? i didn't look at it fully

creations-chat 2020-07-11 17:52:30 used trails to make a record disc, probably not original but i tried
creations-chat 2020-08-11 17:58:59 I tried making a BT-5 from scratch without tutorials, unoriginal probably but im happy with the results
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:49:38 i think my creation is too strong for plane crazy. I go to move it upward and roblox just straight up crashes
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:51:12 ok turns out moving my other creations up also crashes the game...
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:54:15 ok so it isnt just me
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:54:25 how big is your creation?
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:54:40 oh
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:54:55 yea it was happening to me a minute ago
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:55:07 i have another pic of this happening
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:55:10 
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:56:15 ye same thing i just let this one run a little longer then it stopped responding
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:56:35 probably too many blocks moving at once?
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 18:56:44 or the dreaded NaN?
bug-reports 2020-08-21 19:10:05 this is just a clip of the bug the person above was talking about, roblox runs perfectly fine until you move your creation. there's also nothing that appears in the debug logs on roblox right when roblox crashes
bug-reports 2020-08-22 03:15:41 ye it is, its the liset prime
