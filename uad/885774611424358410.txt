plane-crazy 2023-06-25 14:56:32 guys when i launch my atgm it just gets stuck in the air, how do i fix this
plane-crazy 2023-06-25 14:58:20 why is it caused?
plane-crazy 2023-06-25 14:58:36 so annoying it just ruins builds
plane-crazy 2023-06-25 14:59:02 i did
plane-crazy 2023-06-25 14:59:05 it just freezes
plane-crazy 2023-06-25 15:02:09 i launch it and it stops in the air and only moves when something touches it, but it freezes again right after

creations-chat 2023-07-03 12:06:12 https://streamable.com/ye396b vid of my atgm
creations-chat 2023-07-03 15:58:13 it is lol, i put the build in creations
creations-chat 2023-07-03 16:02:33 yeah thats true, i kinda just built a mtlb and slapped a atgm i made on there and called it a day without changing it lol
creations-chat 2023-07-03 16:05:21 i think i will but instead i will use disconectors and signs and maybe trails as i can do more detail
creations-chat 2023-07-05 21:27:55 tonk
creations-chat 2023-07-05 21:31:55 hey i am trying to post my build in creations but the bot is telling me to stop spamming lol üíÄ
creations-chat 2023-07-05 21:34:42 yay i finally was able to put it in there üíÄ
creations-chat 2023-07-05 22:38:25 it has two layers, the angle of it makes it look like it has more though, i only put 2 there because missiles where penning through the cage haha, thank you for the advice though
creations-chat 2023-07-05 22:40:42 bruh im not adding a radar to a tank, the cage is good, it looks good and works good, it either makes the missile bounch or only destroys the cage, thanks for the adive though (also alot of rockets and missiles now are scatter rockets so the radar wouldnt work)
creations-chat 2023-07-05 22:43:12 i mainly build for design tbh, most tanks with detail get destroyed so fast in pvp lol
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:43:23 right so
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:43:29 with a motor locked missile
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:43:45 i have seen alot with disconectors in the tube with explosive blocks on
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:43:52 meaning they scatter before theyt explode
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:44:04 thats how i make my aa missiles anyways
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:44:14 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:44:21 the cage isnt for defult missiles
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:44:26 its for custom and bombs
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:44:29 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:44:45 if it was for the normal missiles it probably wouldnt work haha
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:45:08 but your radar would be great for the normal missiles, and probably custom because if its fast enough it could just smack the missile
creations-chat 2023-07-05 22:45:42 this has to be the worst thing i have ever seen, a firework will never stop a custom rocket flying at you, like ever.
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:46:38 they wont, there are better ways of doing that if thats what you want to do
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:47:28 destroying missiles comming to you isnt really the best anyways, they are going to blow up anyways so you may aswell just have something to either absorb the damage or bouch it off without exploding since most people dont understand when to explode it cus of the lag
creations-chat 2023-07-05 22:48:08 do you realise i am talking about custom rockets lol, even so flares dont really work, the basic missiles are easy to avoid anyways (also why would i put flares on a tank üíÄ)
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:49:31 they dont lol
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:49:40 firewords got to be the worst aps idea ever
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:49:49 cope cages work the best for custom missiles
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:49:52 without a doubt
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:50:04 they either bounce or absorb the impact
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:51:21 firewords are bad for a aps, end of lol
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:51:51 if you think fire works are good for a active protective system on a TANK (which is where this convo is based on) then im sorry but you are stupid
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:51:57 active protection system
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:52:58 if it cant move then why doesnt the missile just hit somehwre you cant shoot, the fireworks are hard to hit anyways, isnt a cage just easy to make it bounce?
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:53:24 see, this cage will make most the missile bounce or take damage to the cage only (i use this and it works)
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:53:44 thanks man ‚ù§Ô∏è
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:53:58 but fr the missile or bomb bounces
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:54:06 üíÄ
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:54:16 it is a good option
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:54:32 embrace cope cage.
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:54:48 we are talking about the smooth brains that bounce
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:55:41 i use it all the time, most of the time it works, if the missile is mouse guided comming from the air, the person in the plane cant really see if it is going to hit the cage or the tank since from above the cage covers most of the tank
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:55:52 i need to add the fire bucket at the back next
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:56:04 not if you make them good
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:56:30 they do if you understand trajectory and the lag of the game, i have missiles that kill most planes cus i know that i have to explode it infront of the plane
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:58:08 also can i point out, using fireworks isnt an aps, since you have to manually use it, the cage is always there and active
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:58:16 so you dont have to look out for missiles to look
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:58:22 not if you make them scatter
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:58:27 cluster missiles?
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:58:51 cluster missiles are very good if you make them good
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 22:59:13 this feels illegal
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 23:00:01 ik what a cluster bomb is, im saying cluster missiles are much better, to use missiles good you have to explode it infront of where the plane is heading and look at the trajectory, then you can over come the lag and not explode early or late
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 23:00:20 also gg first message in <#384021699466756107>  of the day if you live in the uk
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 23:01:02 but can you shoot planes out the sky with it?
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 23:01:16 from the ground?

plane-crazy 2023-07-05 23:03:43 bro what servers are you joining, most only have 2-3 players spawn and have such bad tunnel vision to see my either at the airport or hidden somewhere
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 23:03:52 the servers bro is joining may aswell be a gta online lobby
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 23:04:49 i always do, they always have bad builds and bad at pvp, hence why i just shoot them out the sky easy with cluster missiles. just fly infront of them and scatter then blow yp
