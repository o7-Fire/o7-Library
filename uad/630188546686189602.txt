creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:50:32 as a shredder expert, there are several key elements missing:
**Explosives**: These things are the bane of most shredders. One strike at the wrong spot and they get blown to bits.
**Cutters**: Their own weapon. Let them fly into it and shred themselves.
*hide the fold a smart person would go after it*
build looks good in general though
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:55:12 but then again
that thing could kill it because most of the shredder users out there just home their mouse on things blindly, allowing for easy aim

creations-chat 2023-04-03 17:03:00 reloading in question (you have to redo every one of them)
below is correct
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:07:09 very funny
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:07:13 verrryyy funny.
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:07:42 low effort build: eww what is this smh bad <:Downvote:490311668556103700><:Downvote:490311668556103700>
building:
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:08:03 the fact that it is a building protects it. somehow. mostly. maybe.
general 2023-04-03 17:16:58 üê¥
creations-chat 2023-04-03 17:18:50 meme build is pretty much inevitable
trucks idk wtf is going on with those
most planes are overdone and tuts though; very few are actually worth seeing

also yes most rankeds are whitenames in disguise (i am a ranked in disguise, however)
creations-chat 2023-04-03 17:21:26 please specify which one (thank you ranked ppl for making this chat 2 minute slowmode with your petty shenanigans)
if you whine about the downvotes not my fault you can't get past the strict expectations here ("harder to use tools = better" apparently even though this is blatantly false)
general 2023-04-03 17:22:40 Hmm
general 2023-04-03 17:23:00 It would appear that you do (unless its like one block)

but instead of a cutter at the end (keep the explosive) it is smoke emitter
if u just wanna go comestic though use sparklers ig
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:44:14 true (they're all tut shredders)
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:44:38 like if you're gonna use cancer at least be clever about it. make it go underwater or smth
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:44:43 not use some shitty tut that is easily blown up by 1 missile
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:45:06 tanks are kinda mid rn tho
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:45:24 half of them are those
the other half are tutbugs
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:45:29 ü§¢
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:45:54 no wheels? no design? no turret on top?
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:46:00 
creations-chat 2023-04-03 17:46:42 then make angle restrictions yourself <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
yeah they do that for some goofy reason
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:47:10 easy solution to this however: spawn somewhere else
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:47:37 ...then blow them up repetitively.
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:47:52 in order to kill them you must not be killed upon spawning
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:48:07 if you're gonna spawn in base while there's that kind of person then i must say your iq must be below 1
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:48:24 once ur build is loaded in and operational, ur killable.
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:48:36 the delay is the build loading in <:BIG1:588443768806703124><:BIG2:588443778554134540>
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:48:59 pvp nowdays is just "missile go brr"
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:49:09 or "ahh im a smelly cutter main"
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:49:42 *tut shreds are ez to kill, they do not make you god.
plane-crazy 2023-04-03 17:49:56 tuts are easy as well bc you know their weaknesses because you have seen it before

general 2023-04-11 15:31:31 you only see the gear, the plane is presumably invisible.

creations-chat 2023-04-13 15:16:52 conveyor and spring engine yes
creations-chat 2023-04-13 15:19:01 hover is generally the best mix between stability and speed; and works with any size build
magnet is for smaller builds or submarines otherwise its ass
conveyor is only good for very small builds otherwise its extremely unstable; also only goes a constant speed. most maneuverable though (and speed king)
spring is too unstable to be used effectively and should only be used on large heavy ground builds (its also tricky as fuck to pull off and not known)

or you can just use super rockets. or small props.
creations-chat 2023-04-13 15:21:53 by unstable i mean its shaky as hell and will fling your build into the void/deadzone probs
