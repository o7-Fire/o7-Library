creations-chat 2020-09-28 10:30:29 Tanks take a while to fabricate so expect a waiting period

In the start its a little complicated but once you get the hang of it it's smooth sailing
creations-chat 2020-09-28 10:37:46 Some bugs are fixable while building

creations-chat 2020-09-28 10:39:21 It gets stuck all the damn time
creations-chat 2020-09-28 10:41:59 Could it be because the bottom blocks are grettinf stuck on the top part of the hull?

creations-chat 2020-10-08 15:39:27 Excellent question
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:01:44 New update:
Conveyer drives can now be used to power shredders

And shredders deal 5x damage
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:03:09 > Expunge this man from the surface of earth
Do it
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:03:25 > make shredders a bannable offense 😎
Best idea ever
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:04:06 Shredders
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:04:26 Cutters are used on other things aswell
Shredders are just plain Anoying
Blacklist them the moment you see them
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:05:01 I just gun spam them and despawn the moment they get close
Like bro you don't deserve the gratification of a kill
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:05:51 Just make a bait box
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:06:07 Let them fly into it

AND KABLOWE
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:06:47 Where'd everyone go
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:08:43 "Dont blacklist shedders, it makes it so they pass through your build and they can kill your character, it destroys your entire build"
They don't have enough IQ to know that
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:09:03 The avarage IQ of a shredder user is -10
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:09:20 Just gun and rocket spam them
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:09:36 And despawn to your plot once they get close
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:09:52 They don't deserve kills
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:11:23 Or best of both worlds

Taunt them
Then slaughter them
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:11:44 Blow all those speakers up immediately
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:12:26 Is the null zone the death barrier st like -4k blocks
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:13:05 I still have a V2 missile I csnt control btw
creations-chat 2020-10-09 21:12:47 <@480815755257184296> the first image reminds me of the spidertron from factorio
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:42:11 I have a question
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:43:03 Aight
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:43:23 Otherwise it's just blank
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:44:53 So either a plus or an iron cross
I'll probably do a ln iron cross
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:45:25 Since I want the battleship to  atleast side with the right country and not algebra
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:47:08 We have 4 years
Year 1 and 2 are at a rivalry of who is the most Anoying
And year 3 and 4 are Banding together to keep them in their zones
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:51:19 <@209005642000760832> thats fucking cursed
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:52:05 You just do something simple
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:52:21 Make an afterburner
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:53:04 Make it double barrel
creations-chat 2020-10-13 21:58:23 What does the sign say

creations-chat 2020-10-14 13:19:40 yea until reports open up
aka never
creations-chat 2020-10-14 13:20:11 and what damage would that inflict>
creations-chat 2020-10-14 13:20:49 correct
nothing
creations-chat 2020-10-14 20:41:48 It's pretty self explanatory really quad
WHY 2 MINUTE COOLDOWN
Might aswell remove this channel now because 2 min cooldown makes any conversation litarly useless
Quad, it says "creations" and you post something that isint creations its gona get removed
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 20:44:10 I don't want to be hard here but what smart-ass made <#504436696021204992> 2 mind
plane-crazy 2020-10-14 20:44:44 Might aswell remove it now because there is no way to speak clearly in that channel now
creations-chat 2020-10-14 21:34:13 I hate those "you must now use [insert random thing here] for 10 minutes" images

Anybody posting them should be executed for crimes against humanity


Also remove this channel or change the cooldown because 2 minute slowmode makes chatting impossible
creations-chat 2020-10-14 21:36:30 2 minute cooldown also stopped any form of chatting in this chat

\/
Because mods are stupid
creations-chat 2020-10-14 21:38:31 What moron actually put it in though and thought "yea that's totally not going to murder the intire purpose of this chat"

I'm not native English so

If the cooldown won't get removed you can practically remove this channel because it serves no purpose anymore
creations-chat 2020-10-14 21:45:37 That atleast makes chatting somewhat possible noe
creations-chat 2020-10-14 21:46:48 Violating Geneva convention lol

general 2020-10-27 19:36:28 gotta love when pvp servers get locked down by a shredder
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 19:50:07 why is the blacklist unfunctional
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 19:50:22 the blacklist does litarly nothing
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 19:50:44 the person who you blacklisted can still remove your craft with 12 spammed rockets
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 19:51:31 ive blacklisted a rocket shredder 0 damage taking build
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 19:51:47 i cant phase through
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 19:51:50 its just the box
plane-crazy 2020-10-29 11:13:44 can someone make the suggestion of the blacklist feature making it so you cant damage or be damaged by the person who you blacklisted
plane-crazy 2020-10-29 11:15:12 and so if you knock off the pilot seat the intire craft becomes uncontrollable
plane-crazy 2020-10-30 13:20:38 plne

creations-chat 2020-11-09 17:26:03 <@690608020723597384>
I'd recommend not choosing bright colors but staying to wood and cloth style seats
Its alot more pleasing to the eye without the bright of the sun colors
creations-chat 2020-11-09 17:28:25 You could add a couple of windows to it like with the graf zepelin
I'd really recommend to work on the shape of the airship first then do the passenger rooms

general 2021-02-18 21:36:38 Don't worry they ruined that map in the test server
general 2021-02-18 21:37:00 They ruined metro in test server
general 2021-02-18 21:37:12 Useless new additions and the parts that made it fun have been removed
general 2021-02-18 21:37:25 Old mall or new mall
general 2021-02-18 21:37:33 Because new mall is giving me errors
general 2021-02-18 21:37:57 Like
general 2021-02-18 21:38:08 Bazaar and desert are the only 2 fun maps now
general 2021-02-18 21:38:14 The rest are mediocre
general 2021-02-18 21:38:31 Desert had its flaws yes
general 2021-02-18 21:39:02 But metro (revamp) , rig(revamp) , prison and so many others do it on 10 fold
general 2021-02-18 21:39:37 So you know how Rig is one of the more negative maps right
