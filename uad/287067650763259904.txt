Replicator rank would be appreciated

I can improve on this build in a couple of ways, the nose should be a bit shorter and the aircraft should be shorter as well.

general 2022-01-07 22:22:10 test
creations-chat 2022-01-09 03:33:38 tail rotor is like that to produce low torque (at low rpms) main rotor is like that because swashplate takes up space, and the rest is my shoddy designing skills
creations-chat 2022-01-09 03:40:14 
creations-chat 2022-01-09 03:44:38 Ill go into a little bit more detail about why the tail looks the way it is:

if i use a motor and 3 prop blades, it wont be enough to counter the torque of the main rotor, so to compensate i use higher rpms, however the tail rotor will now be producing a substantial sideways force making hover impossible"

if i use 3 motors with prop blades on all of them (like the configuration shown on the heli), then i can run them at lower rpms producing less sideways force while still countering the main rotor torque

TDLR: yes
creations-chat 2022-01-09 03:53:16 i invite you to take a look at it if you want, seeing it work is quite cool.
creations-chat 2022-01-09 04:06:03 yup, i could put the swashplate on top of the fuselage like they have it irl, but that would look monstrous
creations-chat 2022-01-09 04:33:42 i see you play dcs as well lol, i mean how big it is it wont look good
