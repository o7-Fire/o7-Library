plane-crazy 2021-03-23 02:57:21 Hey everyone i built my first GUI for Plane Crazy using AutoHotKey(AHK)
It has 4 features. PVP ON, PVP OFF, Auto_Motorlock, and Auto_harmless_TNT

Simple but very useful when making motor lock builds 
Download: https://pastebin.com/DawM7HBP
To use this GUI you must have AutoHotKey
