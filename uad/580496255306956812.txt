general 2022-05-12 13:03:22 I heard about a method to get robux, it's Microsoft rewards
general 2022-05-12 13:03:27 Is that considered legit?
general 2022-05-12 13:03:40 Just for asking
general 2022-05-12 13:04:40 Oh ok, cuz I earned 200 robux in 2 months of sparing points
general 2022-05-12 13:04:55 In my is available

general 2022-05-12 13:05:35 Idk, search Microsoft rewards
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 13:08:26 You know the tank treads right?
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 13:08:48 Well, I got distracted and placed motor 1 block further
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 13:08:55 Now I have to do it all over again
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 14:38:44 Uh ok, I found a problem with conveyors
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 14:38:51 They don't move items
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 14:39:29 Or me that turned on the other side ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 17:18:23 Hi
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 17:19:05 No but I built a howitzer
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 17:22:30 Unluckily for me I still can't send images, need rank 3
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 17:23:06 1 thing I can do, or I write or I build
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 17:23:11 Actually building
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 17:23:19 And testing
general 2022-05-13 09:58:32 yes
general 2022-05-13 10:02:55 2 seconds I left chat and just found over 50 messages
general 2022-05-13 10:04:01 Well I don't think so
plane-crazy 2022-05-13 14:47:21 Seems a giant boat
plane-crazy 2022-05-13 14:47:26 Ship*
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 05:37:11 Simply awesome
general 2022-05-14 11:56:31 Hi people
general 2022-05-15 07:08:16 Good morning everyone
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 07:03:27 About gliding, it's actually possible but you need a particular heavy plane with some helium
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 07:23:58 Holy crap the details on that
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 07:24:25 Graphics bugged when loading, restart roblox
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 07:26:02 The boat that sunk in pearl harbor was because a bombardment if I remember correctly
general 2022-05-16 07:28:34 Seems a tasty yellowcake
general 2022-05-16 10:01:19 Hi
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:02:40 Tank that shoots a physical bullet
general 2022-05-16 10:02:45 I'm 17, why do want to know that?
general 2022-05-16 10:03:32 _bruh_
general 2022-05-16 10:03:44 I don't think an underage can build what I posted in <#384021699466756107>
general 2022-05-16 10:04:35 I think you have more experience than me
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:05:20 It's not a plane, it's a cannon that o transformed into a turret that I transformed into a tank
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:05:44 It's too unstable atm
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:06:40 Atm= at the moment
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:06:54 In this case I meant at the moment
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:07:56 Now, I have a question about the speed
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:08:07 It's counted in mph or kmh?
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:08:26 Or just "speed"
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:11:59 Bonk
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:13:25 Kinda hard to understand, but now I see how works
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:14:10 It's harder for me because I'm not English and I don't talk it usually
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:14:59 For example 1000 speed
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:15:06 28m/s
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:17:39 Minecraft it's definitely easier to measure, that's for sure
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:18:33 oh crap he's doing calculations
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:20:15 So, my cannon bullet almost reaches speed or sound
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:20:37 Basic speed is almost 1050 speed
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:22:10 In ending, 1 speed it's 1km/h so 20000 sph?
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:23:34 I'm definitely dumb at math
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:24:38 A Steve is tall 1.8
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:25:06 Oh ok 1.86 now I remember
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:25:30 Now let's stop talking about minecraft, that's plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:26:46 Anyway, enough speed to pierce
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:27:10 One time it did
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:27:50 Too many magnets will make my game lag and it won't pass trough barrel
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:28:26 For now I have 8 super magnets, before 10
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:31:11 I did it. 47 super magnets
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:31:18 All motor locked
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:31:24 In 1 single block
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:34:07 Are explosives heavier than normal blocks?
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:34:21 Ok good to know
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:35:12 I need to make the bullet to explode on impact
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:57:00 Smol boom
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:57:12 Big freaking boom
general 2022-05-16 10:59:22 üáÆüáπ
plane-crazy 2022-05-16 10:59:54 He ended in backrooms
general 2022-05-17 05:44:04 Hi
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 06:07:13 Exposed motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 07:34:49 I'm actually not spending money but I have 200 robux in account balance
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 07:49:41 Is that a nuclear atmosphere?
plane-crazy 2022-05-17 07:49:59 Seems like a nuke just went off behind the plane
general 2022-05-17 08:06:06 He's the guy who posts pfp
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 05:23:30 uh ok, everything is normal here
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 05:24:11 Just look at the position
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 05:24:22 It scared me when was transforming
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 05:24:29 Motors too fast
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 05:25:15 I built one in PC1
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 05:25:40 100 magnets? Good. Your poor fps will die soon
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 05:26:28 Perforated 2 blacklist walls?
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 05:27:32 Speed for penetration is minimum 1000
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 05:27:47 woah
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 05:28:59 Anyway I found why bullets were jamming when loading
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 05:29:09 Ice is lighter than normal block
general 2022-05-18 05:31:21 Wait that place still exists?
general 2022-05-18 05:31:52 There isn't even one
general 2022-05-18 05:32:25 Oh you mean ingame
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 05:33:24 <@456226577798135808> there is one, and she randomly blacklisted without an apparent motivation
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 05:34:02 (don't mind the bullet passed blacklist)
plane-crazy 2022-05-20 07:54:55 What's wrong with your gui?

general 2022-06-19 10:30:24 About suggestion #11180, that is a good one because ballast block can be configured precisely but helium block have just "apply at center"
