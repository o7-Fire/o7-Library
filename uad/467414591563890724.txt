Anti copy while in flight

When we are using our build, we can make it so certain people cant copy it.
Like we have the anti copy blacklist, but when you launch it just shows everyone your build.
I keep on getting me and my friends builds straight up stolen, block for block, colour for colour.

Its really annoying, and people just straight up steal builds that people work on for ages.
