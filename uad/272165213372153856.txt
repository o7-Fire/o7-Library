plane-crazy 2018-12-08 00:40:51 why is it there?
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 00:41:27 yes. but when i'm flying, how do i remove it.
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 00:41:30 chillax my dude.
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 22:36:42 <@163143541160148992> Send me a close up on the engine of the plane pic you sent.
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 23:48:42 wow..
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 23:48:49 wonder what russia does to it.
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:40:56 Hey..
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:41:27 Wondering why I don't have access to suggestions submissions.
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:47:53 Why do I not have access to <#491710474786832394>?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:48:38 When was this rule implimented?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:49:21 And how do I become ranked?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:50:24 Cause I was about to suggest the option to add keybinds to light blocks, but I don't think that's gonna happen.
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:50:50 *click screwdriver*
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:51:22 clicked the screwdriver, and nothin'.
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:51:41 i mean i clicked it, and clicked the light block.
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:51:47 YES.
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:51:51 That's what I did.
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:52:35 I can only do one lightblock!
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:52:40 and that's it!
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:52:59 maybe cause they just started..
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:53:25 you shouldn't expect every single person to have 5 months of experience.
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:53:37 they MUST learn SOMEWHERE.
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:53:56 That's good for you!
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:54:01 Not everyone is at the same level!
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:54:07 Everyone learns at diffrent paces.
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:55:31 Technically, you're saying that if you can learn rocket science in under 30 minutes, others can too.
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:55:35 so uhh, eyah.
the-dump 2018-12-10 23:56:04 is spam alood h3re?
the-dump 2018-12-10 23:56:05 yes
the-dump 2018-12-10 23:56:07 asfnasdjkas'
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:56:41 The tutorial doesn't go through most mechanics.
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:57:07 the in game tutorial?
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:57:10 or..
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:57:24 it doesn't really explain anything aboot pistons.
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:57:51 but it doesn't have to be that way.
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:58:20 trial and error can be turned into "get taught by someone"\
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:58:31 to make life much easier.
plane-crazy 2018-12-10 23:59:01 steve jobs invented the ipad. i never did.
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:00:14 There are schools for a reason! If trial and error was used in almost every case, schools wouldn't be needed.
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:00:21 Trial and Error are for the small thinsg.
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:00:29 very tiny personal things
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:01:19 all i'm seeing is paper copies of the same people who don't like the idea of teaching a newbie the basics.
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:01:42 Very disrespectful.
plane-crazy 2018-12-11 00:02:22 now we have an answer.
help 2018-12-11 00:06:55 can those weight block thingys weigh lighter than traditional blocks?
help 2018-12-11 00:08:31 that means that the helium block is a good block to use for building, rather than traditional blocks.
help 2018-12-11 00:08:59 unless if this game also mimics helium rl..
help 2018-12-11 00:09:43 i'd say they're great for planes.
help 2018-12-11 00:09:54 are they anchored, or..
help 2018-12-11 00:10:35 yes.
help 2018-12-11 00:10:57 but they aren't loose, or anything.
help 2018-12-11 00:11:16 we have an answer.
help 2018-12-11 00:15:38 How does one connect an engine onto a wing?
help 2018-12-11 00:16:17 I've seen space man, AKA vipEmpire do it, but the picture was from a far away distance, so I couldn't really see what he did.
help 2018-12-11 00:16:33 Tried using half blocks, rotating them, etc.
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 20:29:59 i will sue you.
plane-crazy 2018-12-13 22:35:54 any tips with wedges?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 03:16:30 can you even control it?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 03:16:42 turning, etc..
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 03:16:55 yes.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 03:17:06 hellium plane.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 03:17:24 how does one fly heavy plane with 0 helium?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 03:17:50 i has long wings plane not go like bird.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 03:18:34 alright. more wings, less humans.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 03:19:34 what if weight didn't exist..
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 03:19:39 🤔
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 03:20:48 how heavy is one traditional block?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 03:20:56 like a stock ballast?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 03:21:38 just wanna get a sense of how heavy a single block vursus a stock ballast block.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 03:22:19 1 density is 1 block.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:35:14 for some reason, i'm able to go up a few studs, and glide at a very low speed in my plane..
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:35:36 hellium?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:36:04 like 27
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:36:14 a wut?
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:36:31 it's an airliner..
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:37:15 it just starts gliding at a very low altitude at a very low speed.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:38:00 mk gonna screenshot it.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:39:47 odd..
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:39:54 it doesn't happen anymore.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:40:10 instead, it's just a dumbed down version  of my problem.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:40:22 no not really. the plane its new itself.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:40:44 yes.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:41:18 gonna screenshot my plane instead, so you can check out some faults.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:43:14 
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:43:44 it's a prototype, so..
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:43:48 it's barely even complete.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:43:55 left out the detail.
plane-crazy 2018-12-16 17:44:05 just making the stuff that makes a plane fly..
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:56:16 GG
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:56:51 you've spent multiple hours making a virtual(ly useless) plane.
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:56:56 just kiddin' it's amazing.
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:57:53 if you wish to defeat me
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:58:00 train for another 100 years.
plane-crazy 2018-12-20 00:58:10 no you
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 21:14:25 what triggers the weird engine sounds?
plane-crazy 2018-12-25 21:14:35 ah.
plane-crazy 2018-12-27 21:50:19 wish we had the ability to copy a select area.
plane-crazy 2018-12-27 21:50:36 useful to conserve time building the other wing.
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 15:47:34 once iw as like
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 15:47:51 "just like your honda" as a reply to a joke

creations-chat 2018-12-28 18:46:17 baby steps! just built a car template. speeds maxed at 75 with motors.
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 18:51:05 i'm proud of myself. just took my first giant step into motors.
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 18:52:47 <@!198104634957496320> wheels are a posibility, but what if you wanted to build something a bit more copmplex.
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 18:53:17 you can attach 3x3 cylinders onto wheels..
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 18:53:20 i think.
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 18:53:43 we need gripped cylinders.
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 18:53:53 better cylindres.
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 18:54:04 decals, belguh
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 18:54:34 1x2, 1x3, 1x4 pyramids.
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 18:56:21 how do you get motors to act loose so i can place them on train wheels?
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 18:56:37 ah
creations-chat 2018-12-28 21:22:17 aaand this is the outcome from the car template! drives like butter.
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 21:40:55 having trouble removing a motor on myplot.
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 21:41:06 delete button won't work.
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 21:41:13 done that.
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 21:41:27 and i don't wanna delete my whole plot.
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 21:41:32 ah dev log
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 21:42:55 no errors were found..
plane-crazy 2018-12-28 21:43:14 there were a bunch, but they disappeared.
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:28:23 wish our plots were a bit longer..
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:29:52 6/10 - too bright
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:30:06 go for some colours that are a bit darker.
plane-crazy 2018-12-29 17:30:30 <@!243085529598525441> 4-10. too blocky.
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 20:17:05 has the slot 15 patch come out?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 21:35:29 what happend to infinite torque?

plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:03:48 Welcome to the Plane Crazy Community. Home of the nerd community.
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:05:01 I'd say that's a feature to prevent you from getting stuck if someone joins the game while you're in that plot.
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:05:26 Some bugs aren't bad.
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:05:56 yes.
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:06:02 but some bugs can become features.
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:06:10 The creeper was a bug.
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:07:00 Bugs are rarely features. But when they are, they can be improvised to be less broken, and more usable.
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:07:33 As I said, like the creeper from Minecraft.
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:07:51 It had no intent in being in the game. Now it's the most iconic mob in game.
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:08:31 thats hot
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:09:11 <@!155149108183695360> Your moderation is worse than ROBLOX.
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:09:15 crap it doesn't say dyno
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:10:55 A long time ago when The Plaza was released, the Monorail had an announcement of if the train was leaving, or coming. The voice was recorded by Widgeon, but it got copyrighted.
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:10:59 Therefore it was removed.
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:11:32 *switches to dark mode for the screenshot*
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:12:10 how does one take screenshot in 5 seconds?
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:13:54 Did you know?

Malala had 2 bars in a Pakistani Village when trying to call a family member.
plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:17:09 I can make anyone say anything I want.

plane-crazy 2019-01-17 21:34:39 change the name to newbie server, then

creations-chat 2019-02-05 16:02:23 For the people that were like me before, to get a plane to fly, add a crap ton of super rocket engines inside empty areas, instead of only using 2-3 engines.

plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:33:54 ^
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:34:40 that's like saying it's a bad idea to allow Muslims to enter a country because some of them will do bad things <@!486674992981999648>.
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:35:41 apparently using a useful tool is considered rude.
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:36:13 <@!486674992981999648> free models can be used if you can't create something. it's alright to have  a few free models, but not too much.

plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:37:06 They are for people who *lack* experience to create something they can't.
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:37:16 At least it works.
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:37:33 If you look at the ratings, you'll get a good free model.
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:37:43 There are ways to remove  viruses in free models.
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:37:58 <@!118113664636157953> Take s2newton's cars, as an example.
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:38:30 <@456226577798135808> What's wrong with that? First world problem? Economy is dying?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:39:18 <@!486674992981999648> There is some sketch with Kohl's admin, such as being unable to disable the "would you like to buy model chair?"
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:39:29 There has been some drama..
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:39:53 is that the only answer you can give me other than "i'm better than you stop ping ponging me"
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:40:01 Like, really?
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:40:11 Pinging is a tool used to make it easier for you to find a messaage!
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:40:23 I don't cake.

plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:44:34 cause
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:44:51 it makes no sense to complain aboot a simple ping when there are other bigger problems in the world
plane-crazy 2019-02-27 22:45:05 Even when pings are a *tool*!

general 2019-03-02 21:02:33 it's just sketchy..
general 2019-03-02 21:02:57 he's done this before where it may look like I get profit, but overtime, I loose profit.
general 2019-03-02 21:03:10 but other times, i do gain profit..
general 2019-03-02 21:03:21 he'll decline.
general 2019-03-02 21:03:25 i'll try it, though.
general 2019-03-02 21:05:17 what's even more sketchy is that another user that sended me a trade at the same time has a crap ton of duplicates, much like him

general 2019-03-02 21:10:13 people can trade others things they already have
general 2019-03-02 21:10:32 but the amount that this croc kid has is too good to be true.

plane-crazy 2019-06-27 16:04:02 the outer engines are mainly for decor.

plane-crazy 2019-06-27 16:12:38 "Obviously, that’s a heck of a beastly PC, but Alicja was quick to point out that Cyberpunk 2077’s E3 demo wasn’t an optimised version of the game, so it’s unlikely we’ll need anything remotely this powerful to play it in its finished state, whenever that might be. Needless to say, though, you’re probably going to need something a bit beefier than The Witcher 3‘s recommended Nvidia GeForce GTX 770 or AMD Radeon R9 290 graphics cards to stand a chance of running it."

plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:07:43 okay
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:08:05 i don't think so.
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:08:12 i feel like diversity is the right answer.
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:08:30 you are connected with different people that follow different cultures and such
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:08:44 allows you to see the other side
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:09:20 and not divide from one to another.
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:09:48 i mean
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:09:52 how does that happen?
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:10:24 aren't there more than 1.4 billion chinese out there?
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:10:48 okay, let's say that it somehow happened.
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:10:55 then it's a diversity issue.
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:11:35 we must look at why they are coming in
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:12:29 yes i understand
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:13:01 so you asked if all of a sudden, china was bombarded with africans, and the chinese population shrunk?
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:13:07 that's not diversity.
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:13:52 didn't you asked that? let me check lmao

plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:16:28 i mean
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:16:36 how would that happen with diversity?
plane-crazy 2019-08-12 00:16:47 diversity would be many cultures mixed

plane-crazy 2019-11-18 22:59:08 still going strong
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 22:59:21 it really depends on who makes it and when
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 22:59:30 outdated software?
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 22:59:38 just downlowd new software lmao
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 22:59:51 no
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:00:00 android 8 i upgraded it via downloader
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:00:03 so like
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:00:17 unlike ios, you can actually upgrade your phone to whatever update you like
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:00:29 they stop *automatically*
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:00:33 but you can still update them yourself
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:01:06 for the third time
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:01:14 you can find a new os online
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:01:17 and download it
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:01:46 most consumers would do it if they were educated enough *sigh*
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:02:22 it's just the sad reality. apple is for those who can't really seem to understand the benefits of extra customizability.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:02:27 not only that, but options
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:02:30 and potential
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:03:28 i've done benchmarks, and 27 android phones place before the iphone 11 pro
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:03:33 in terms of performance
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:03:48 top one goes to blackshark 2 pro
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:03:53 those are the ahead ones
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:04:06 28th place is 11 pro
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:04:22 i actually know a few friends who have it.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:04:30 they said it's worth the money.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:05:05 that's true, but you can't really carry a pc around with you.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:05:18 that point is also why i don't buy expensive phones though
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:05:22 laptops are still too big
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:05:25 they need a bag
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:05:33 you can't fit them in your pocket
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:05:58 actually, i find many cheap phones to last the longest.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:06:07 cheap new ones
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:06:15 my LG Stylo 3 has a long way to go
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:06:45 <@!217336009455566848> because you developed them?
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:07:10 i'm literally dissing someone without context don't mind me
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:07:22 <@!454570394343702529> i do
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:07:35 snapdragon 435
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:08:19 i would really love  a baby mode for plane crazy.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:08:26 wouldn't that be awesome?
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:09:20 <@!217336009455566848> i don't have feet, i'm an enviro500 serving canada's capital
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:09:31 solutions?
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:10:34 because we treat him like a regular person, not someone of more authority <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:11:45 will the horns soon have custom audio?
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:11:58 will be making a bus soon and will need route annoucenments
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:14:03 <@!217336009455566848> at any point are we getting custom audio on horns or any new audio-enabling block? plan on making a bus soon and may make route annoucenents (i.e "Route 44. Hurdman. Cerqtui, Qarrante Qatre, Hurdman.)
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:15:17 <@456226577798135808> we could always limit the sound to make it kinda quiet, we could block others sounds,  and/or have a report system
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:15:40 not *the* report system
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:16:16 do we not have like an in game report system like Plaza 2 with plot report?
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:16:21 seen countless dicks in game
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 23:16:41 that's really suprising good sir.

plane-crazy 2021-04-05 01:33:56 i made a map concept
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 01:34:00 
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 01:34:24 the goal was to keep it the same in nature but with more stuff in general
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 01:35:10 water is big already; it just looks small compared to the rest of the map as the map is generally bigger
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 01:36:26 <@!637781561277677582> aren't there advanced graphics options in roblox studio?
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 01:37:00 <@!637781561277677582> yes yes. apparently there are more graphics options for ROBLOX located in ROBLOX studio
plane-crazy 2021-04-05 01:37:15 for other roblox games***

plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:17:52 i dont want to redo it tho as it's still a good build nontheless
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:18:05 yeah exactly
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 00:18:20 no theyre custom

creations-chat 2021-07-05 01:44:35 thoughts? (i call it the Rideau Sarnia Day Cab)
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 13:54:24 they aren't bad, standards are just too high
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 13:56:10 this guy got a shit tonna downvotes
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 13:56:31 people here expect a blender model inside of plane crazy and it's fucking insane
plane-crazy 2021-07-05 13:58:28 that has entirely to do with graphics levels/settings and with the current gpu market...
creations-chat 2021-07-06 00:20:59 how about now?
creations-chat 2021-07-06 02:17:36 if we seriously are basing creations off of effort we have to be considerate of skill levels, as they vary depending on the person. it's my biggest fucking problem in this server.

people don't appriciate different artstyles and progress. they bitch and complain about other's getting upvotes when they downvote other creations.

mods here aren't curators tho, so nothing much can be done about this.
creations-chat 2021-07-06 02:22:28 this
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:26:15 what if... we removed dislikes in <#384025409945337856>...
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:28:18 no not really. people abuse the downvote button like hell.
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:28:33 good builds are being downvoted like crazy, and expectations are too high which demotivates many new users.
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:29:29 it's a cute build with a different artstyle. it's good.
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:29:32 very accurate too.
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:29:56 yes i remember it. barely used it because it had no purpose
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:30:06 had a bad layout
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:30:08 mostly
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:30:43 just dont vote to express disagreement
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:31:52 mm yes, because new players will definitly improve by a simple "use motorlocks and half wedges, it looks too curvy"
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:36:02 expectations have gotten too high to the point people start expecting blender models in plane crazy.

 it's fucking ridiculous how many good builds there are comparative to skillset of the builder. <#384025409945337856> turned into a downvote frenzy and if 90% of builds are downvoted, people won't even bother uploading.

community has become very closed off too. to newcomers trying to learn something, it feels unwelcoming.
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:41:51 these people here expect you to know how to do everything
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:42:59 depression has nothing to do with this, it's demotivating yeah
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:44:09 and yeah, you do have to start somewhere. and that's my fucking point, people pretend to know that without actually realizing what it means
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:44:51 THIS
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:44:54 ego
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:44:57 thats the word im looking for
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:45:20 90% of people here are egotistical hormonal tryhard builders expecting blender models.
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:46:47 i treat ranks more like roblox badges. their a fun little challenge that in theory should help you improve, but it's proving impossible to get higher ranks due to expectations
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:47:04 it's why i really do want dislikes removed until further notice
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:47:49 tiktok has only a like feature, insta has only a like feature and so does twitter. but yet people think of removing dislikes as something that "youtube did and failed"
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:48:57 i'd rather not have chaos
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:49:07 i'm fucking down.
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:50:36 oh
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:50:53 i can't say something bad about neo german terrorists

plane-crazy 2021-07-06 02:51:23 yuck
general 2021-07-06 02:57:35 i'm thinking of creating an alternate plane crazy server, where good builds aren't downvoted into the oblivion, where dolphins can freely be shared without backclash and where hormonal egotistical tryhards aren't to be seen...

moderation will be of better quality too... just not sure where to start or if it'll even start...
general 2021-07-06 02:58:16 why am i 60% certain this is a joke?
general 2021-07-06 02:58:43 this
general 2021-07-06 02:59:04 yes. yes really.
general 2021-07-06 02:59:34 i specialize in non-motorlocked builds as part of a niche. it sucks.
general 2021-07-06 03:00:16 mostly planes and cars for me
general 2021-07-06 03:01:49 it's cool and all, but if it really takes that much effort just to get somewhere here, why the fuck do people post in the first place?
general 2021-07-06 03:02:16 i've already had three people come to me a few seconds ago and say that they don't post in <#384025409945337856> no more because it's just demotivating.
general 2021-07-06 03:07:01 what does that even mean
general 2021-07-06 03:07:02 how
general 2021-07-06 03:07:03 what
general 2021-07-06 03:07:41 yes
general 2021-07-06 03:08:15 yeah and that's my issue tho, if your build doesn't have motorlocks, 80% chance it'll be downvoted.
general 2021-07-06 03:09:38 that's like saying "if i'm a rich black person, it's easy for black people to get rich"
general 2021-07-06 03:09:47 it's very selective
general 2021-07-06 03:09:57 whats the word im looking for...
general 2021-07-06 03:09:59 the phrase
general 2021-07-06 03:27:21 30 dislikes, half as many likes
general 2021-07-06 03:29:54 this isn't mine, it's somebody elses.
general 2021-07-06 03:30:12 this guy got 20 something dislikes and only 8 likes
general 2021-07-06 03:31:25 80%
general 2021-07-06 03:31:40 this guy got a bunch of dislike
general 2021-07-06 03:32:05 i'm generally talking about good builds.
general 2021-07-06 03:32:12 with or without motorlocks now

plane-crazy 2021-07-22 18:05:30 oh
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 18:05:33 my roles were removed
plane-crazy 2021-07-22 18:05:34 yay
general 2021-09-04 05:05:29 Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars 🌠
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:26:51 really wish we could edit the streangth/amount of thrust engines could produce
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:27:22 i dont want to put 50 super rocket engines in a jet powered 747
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:27:39 just wanna have 4 jet engines
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:27:40 thats it
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:28:40 hover thruster/conveyor motors dont cut it; it feels like it's not supposed to happen
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:28:58 like, i want a robust thrust system
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:29:28 if we had modular engines that would be cool
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:29:31 like stormworks
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:29:40 wtf no, it's amazing
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:30:16 in stormworks, you build engines part by part (very simple though); ex; place cylinders, pipes, cooling etc
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:31:22 thats just one option
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:31:46 otherwise i just want thrust more powerful/realistic
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:32:14 yes, but they aren't jet engines
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:32:17 i've used them befoire
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:32:18 like
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:32:20 i want a premade solution
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:32:24 something in the game
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:32:53 want something robust
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:33:02 not solutions that are similar to using a screw driver as a hammer
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:33:39 as in?
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:35:59 non solutions
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:36:46 i'm just sugguesting? not sure where you took offence
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:37:06 too complex
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:38:13 you have some sort of issue with that?
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:38:18 you giving me fanboy vibes
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:39:01 all i simply ask
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:39:04 is more thrust in jet engines
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:39:11 as of now, they're mere props
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:39:15 decoration
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:39:44 thats what you dont fucking get
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:39:52 i am not looking at now
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:39:55 i am looking at the future
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:39:58 when the game is rewritten
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:40:39 that has more layers than a birthday cake
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:41:19 i do not want temporary solutions as i know them
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:41:26 they feel like hammering a nail with a screwdriver
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:42:07 first one is complex, this one is even more complex
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:42:22 the most complex thing I can make is probably a car
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:42:28 semi truck*
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:43:02 this is simple
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:43:05 my build
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:43:10 no motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:43:29 i fixed it
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:43:31 old image

plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:46:20 feel
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:46:36 feels like you're driving death
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:47:15 motorlock is too complex
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:47:19 which way is placed where
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:47:45 what
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:47:49 motorlock in general is stupid
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:48:01 hitboxes shouldn't be that big
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:48:26 if i wanna place a wedge, the hitbox must be the shape of that wedge
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:48:53 motorlock is simply a dumb solution to a dumb problem
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:49:15 why does motorlock exist
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:49:37 it exists because hitboxes are too big
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:50:20 i do not dislike hoverengines because they're complex; they just add extra steps and for what?
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:50:56 and thats the fucking point. why not add extra speed to the existing engiens?
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:51:11 thats. the point.

plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:51:49 you think i dont know this?
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:52:31 all i want is plane crazy to be more like stormworks
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:52:35 more refined
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:52:38 after the rewrite
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:52:50 it's very similar
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:53:03 ok fanboy 🙄
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:53:40 hover engines make zero sense
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:53:43 modular engines do
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:54:58 imagine taking plane crazy suggestions too personally😳
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:55:57 im not building anything though
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:56:01 so what am i really taking
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 03:56:13 my english isn't too good
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:04:08 ***to make things clearer:***

*i want thrust to be more powerful; specifically for turboprops and jet engines.*

**"why not use hover engines dumbass bitch?"**
well, why not have preset engines that already produce enough power? why does engines have to be decoration? if you want to build custom engines, we could simply have a solution that makes more sense, such as having modular (very dumbed down; maybe like five max) engine parts. why do we have to resort to sci-fi and nonsensical technology to build things that already exist?

*i want square hitboxes gone. if i wanna place a triangle, i want the hitbox to take the shape of the block.*

"**why not use motor lock dumbass bitch?"**
you wont need to use motor lock with this anymore.

plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:06:06 whats the screenshot for? 🤨
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:06:38 thats what we're trying to avoid
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:06:52 improvement
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:06:55 quality of life
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:07:58 hitbox should take the shape of the block
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:08:04 then there wont be a need for motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:08:32 collisions
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:10:25 colisions would be the solution
plane-crazy 2021-09-05 04:10:30 toggle it on/off

plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:37:36 this is what i wrote
plane-crazy 2022-01-07 15:37:37 Hello all! 

In Doug Demuro's voice: This, is the all new Rideau Labrador; a four-door convertible, and it's redicoulously fast, attaining a 0-60 in less than four seconds, and today, I'm going to submit it.

Now, what is Rideau, you may ask? Rideau is a fictional crown corporation funded by the Government of Canada. Its purpose is to spread Canadian influence across the world to boost the image of Canada while creating an aditional revenue stream, which is very unheard of for a country, and what's even more unheard of is that it's working.

The Rideau Labrador is built and assembled in Arnprior, Ontario, a shy west of the nation's Capital.

The Labrador has a straight six producing 613 horsepower, leather seats, functioning steering wheel, dual climate control, an infotainment system and an ajustable rear view mirror.
