plane-crazy 2020-11-06 23:11:48 When did u started playing plane crazy tho?
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 20:42:46 Guys?
What's the difference between the normal seat and the pilot seat apart from the color change
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 20:43:30 Apart from the color where your avatar sits, whats the difference
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 20:44:28 if these were the same seats, why adding a different variant with just a different color
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 20:45:26 By Pilot seat I mean the blue variant
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 20:49:10 Anyone knows a difference between the pilot seat(blue) and the normal seat(black)?
Apart from the color difference obv
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 20:49:28 > pilot seat you can control from
<@484529511468236802> Wait
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 20:49:57 So if you want you can get another player to control your build?
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 20:50:56 Ohhhhhh
plane-crazy 2020-11-07 20:51:13 F
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 22:02:27 Guys I checked Integex channel and I found out that he removed all of his vids? Anyone knows why?
plane-crazy 2020-12-20 22:02:31 
general 2020-12-20 22:05:17 Guys I checked Integex channel on youtube, he built a 6.6k block kaga aircraft carrier and some other big builds
general 2020-12-20 22:05:49 
general 2020-12-20 22:06:05 Wait what
general 2020-12-20 22:06:21 Wdym gone?
general 2020-12-20 22:06:38 But why tho
general 2020-12-20 22:07:08 I mean you dont just delete a video that shows one of the best builds in plane crazy like that
general 2020-12-20 22:07:31 Is there reason why he deleted his vids?
general 2020-12-20 22:10:01 Ok but it was still a 6.6k block build
general 2020-12-20 22:10:11 Not anyone can pull smth like that
general 2020-12-20 22:11:23 I struggle a lot to get a "good enough" 600 blocks build so I dont think that building something over 2k is simple
general 2020-12-20 22:11:46 But apart from that do you know why he deleted all of his vids?
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 11:09:28 Lmao
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 11:12:37 I wonder if you could make a lock-on system with a rope and a magnet
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 11:12:45 And a block of tnt
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 11:12:58 So you use the rope and the magnet to stick to someone
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 11:13:09 Oof
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 11:13:35 Oh true
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 11:14:26 I once dreamed of an op sam system that used the lock-pn system that I described
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 11:14:52 And that would send other players into the shadow realm bc of centrifuge force
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 11:15:05 Along with the good ol' tnt block
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 11:15:13 Hm yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 11:15:41 And a gyro block that would orientate itself towards someone that you targeted
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 11:16:09 I see what happened
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 11:16:15 One hecc of a bomb
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 11:18:41 ....
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 11:18:49 Pizza but with extra steps
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 11:19:04 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 11:19:11 I think it's a pizza that u rolled
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 19:43:58 Guys do the devs have any plan about batteries that could be used against Aircrafts as flak, or against ships so WW2 ships could actually be deadly
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 19:45:55 Wait, do we have to build things for them to get reviewed and maybe added to the game?
PS: I'm not really active here so there might be things I don't know
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 19:47:18 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:24:03 Guys anyone thought about building APFSDS rounds to yeet ground targets?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:25:13 an Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot Shot is a type of round used by tanks like the Leopard 2 or the Abrams to kill ennemy tanks
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:26:05 Looks like this
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:26:45 You can see a silver-ish part, it's the part which will penetrate the ennemy tank
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:27:07 The black grains are the explosives used to propel the round
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:28:13 It's absurdly powerful
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:28:38 It's commonly used amongst modern MBTs
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:29:13 Well not yeet
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:29:28 But it will melt the crew of the ennemy tank at speeds above mach 4
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:29:32 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:29:51 Imagine someone creating a MBT which actually uses realistic APFSDS rounds
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:30:23 Well imagine someone creating an APFSDS round
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:30:33 Sadly we don't have big guns in this game
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:30:50 Wait there is gun powder in plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:31:15 Oh ok
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:31:19 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:31:33 So TNT can be used as a propellant?
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:31:41 True
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:31:54 rip
plane-crazy 2021-05-08 09:32:44 Same
help 2021-05-16 12:48:59 I'm making a pvp jet, but I need some ideas.
I already put control surfaces and helium blocks at the front so it doesnt wobble, I also have hover drives as my engines, anything I should add? (apart from the weapons obv)
help 2021-05-16 12:50:51 My cockpit is too small for it...
help 2021-05-16 13:01:18 Actually I managed to make my canopy ejectable in case I get too much damaged

general 2021-06-28 18:56:41 R.I.P Voxel

:pray:  Amen
general 2021-06-28 18:58:57 Why
general 2021-06-28 18:59:29 Is voxel retiring bc of work?
general 2021-06-28 19:01:31 We need a golden statue of Voxel somewhere
general 2021-06-28 19:02:41 Voxel did not die, he *evaporated*, and oh sh- he also summoned demons in the vc
general 2021-06-28 19:03:51 *Oh no*
