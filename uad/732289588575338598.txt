creations-chat 2021-02-10 10:16:52 oh well its strange how the cockpit, front and tail is practicaly identical but if you say you didnt copy then i have no reson to protest.
creations-chat 2021-02-10 10:29:00 I only specified some specific parts, i didnt say you copied the whole thing. I was just curious to see if it was copied but it turns out people think its an argument, its a discussion. i appreciate its not copied but some parts are most defiantly copied.
creations-chat 2021-02-10 10:32:31 i dont see it as an argument but ok lol
creations-chat 2021-02-10 10:34:59 I never said it was copied, i just said parts of it was copied
creations-chat 2021-02-10 10:39:21 the reson i put that comment there was because i was suspicouse, i didnbt mean for the whole thing to blow up into a argument with all this but i guess i know not to put simple things on pcc now, i apolygise and i wont do it again. i was just worried as i thaught someone was using parts of my build as a base for theirs. im sorry and i will shut up now <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2021-02-10 10:41:43 yes thats why i posted it, i double checked and parts where the same. but like you said they are the same heli. (sory i replied to the wrong comment lol)
creations-chat 2021-02-10 10:45:42 same lol im in the middle of a teams meating<:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>
