creations-chat 2022-12-10 23:12:03 yo guys u think it would be possible to make a fox 1 missile?
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 23:12:55 yo u guys think its possible to make a fox 1 missile?
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 23:14:34 u mean a radar guided missile
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 23:14:42 that guides itself if it has a radar lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 23:15:59 no
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 23:16:15 a fox 3 is when the missile only needs an initial radar lock
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 23:16:25 it guides itself through the built in radar
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 23:47:30 So i watched some tutorials and stuff
plane-crazy 2022-12-10 23:47:49 And i think cameras can work as a tracking system
plane-crazy 2022-12-11 12:47:42 Jesus
creations-chat 2022-12-11 13:06:46 Can someone explain to me why the plane crazy community downvotes to hell really good builds?
creations-chat 2022-12-11 13:11:47 There is a really good looking phantom and su 47 if u scroll up a bit, why are they so disliked
creations-chat 2022-12-11 13:16:51 Nah that stuff aint easy to make also why is no motorlocks a problem i thought motorlocks are a problem
creations-chat 2022-12-11 13:20:15 Yo i think ur very experienced, do you think its possible to make a fox 1 missile with tracking?
plane-crazy 2022-12-11 13:20:35 F14 or a bomber
creations-chat 2022-12-11 13:22:53 Yo where i need to see that
creations-chat 2022-12-11 13:25:34 Magnets dont work on enemy builds, also what is a magnet lock
creations-chat 2022-12-11 13:28:13 99 i want to make it track thats the thing, elite so what can it do im just seeing a magnet that catched a landing gear
creations-chat 2022-12-11 13:31:05 I had an idea to use camera lock so if anyone touches the camera the missile is pushed and if he continues to push the missile will track him
creations-chat 2022-12-11 13:33:10 Yeah its the closest thing we got
plane-crazy 2022-12-11 13:33:55 Elite will there be a feature that magnets can connect to other peoples builds
plane-crazy 2022-12-11 13:34:33 Would be great
creations-chat 2022-12-11 20:36:46 what shaders are these
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:43:50 We could just throw guided missiles into it
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:46:20 We could use railguns, and if the community comes together we might find a way to make guided missiles like aim 9s
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:48:33 Have u ever made a missile with a hoover engine
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:50:57 You can stabilize it like add more wing surfaces, or we can make a rocket bomb
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:53:09 Well i think we could strap 12 rockets to a missile with tnt thats powered by a hoover engine and launch it at the shredder ball
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:55:15 Wait are shredders automatic or player guided
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:57:20 Im up
creations-chat 2022-12-12 07:59:23 Aight, ima take a shower in the meantime
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:39:31 Add me for gods sake
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:46:23 Yo people that use shredders, do u just want people to hate u?
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:48:53 Yo can u send me a contact to the spaceship group, ive been working on a project and i need  help of experts
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:51:08 Oh no no its not an anti shredding project its something else
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:54:23 Yo thanks for the group i think i contacted one of em
creations-chat 2022-12-12 08:57:21 Well im not really into spaceship just got something to build yk
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:02:26 Ah they muted me when i rosted a guy that wanted to ban me cuz of my minecraft pfp
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:04:34 To be frank my man you already got a rat not me i just try staying friendly with everyone so like kinda not really a secret yk what i mean
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:10:38 Yo have u seen my roast
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:16:11 Im just a guy
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:42:37 Yo storm how can i find these groups
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:44:45 They arent mentioned much
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:47:26 <@834898687959367751> how can i find these groups
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:49:31 Dont know people dont know names of the groups
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:52:37 Nice stuff, but please dont ruin well built planes in a cool pvp server
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:54:39 Thats not so bad
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:57:34 Yo storm since things as advanced as anti void stuff exist do u think guided missiles would be able to exist
creations-chat 2022-12-12 09:59:39 No like a fox 1 it guides itself like u lock someone and it tracks the guy
creations-chat 2022-12-12 10:02:16 Could u show me a the glitch also do u think it will be possible like u think there is a way we havent discovered yet
creations-chat 2022-12-12 10:05:52 Mhm, do u think its possible to make the missile like when the void tech was discovered before u didnt know it could be made, do u think there is the same thing with that
creations-chat 2022-12-12 10:11:35 Thats just cutting the space and time continum, also check dms
creations-chat 2022-12-12 19:36:47 naw but the wings are actually really well made
general 2023-01-28 23:24:25 did u guys know
general 2023-01-28 23:24:29 napalm sticks to kids?
creations-chat 2023-01-28 23:25:47 wait couldnt u make napalm with flamethrowers and tnt?
creations-chat 2023-01-28 23:33:27 We need a fire effect so that stays but something that would damage overtime, saws would be alright for area denial but we want something flashy like TNT that explodes for 2 minutes
creations-chat 2023-02-03 16:44:56 this is insane tbhj
creations-chat 2023-02-03 16:47:52 it is amazing to be honest
creations-chat 2023-02-03 16:50:37 if u have a better fa18 i would love to see it
creations-chat 2023-02-03 16:57:12 best thing i did is a flying brick, yeah its insane to me
creations-chat 2023-02-03 16:59:31 do you have a better fa18? Also ur telling me that standards are falling but i am 100% sure devs did not expect anything close to that existing
creations-chat 2023-02-03 17:03:16 Finally someone with common sense
creations-chat 2023-02-03 17:05:18 fa 18 is pretty hard to build though, especially since the airframe is pretty slick and while u can argue an f14 is better cuz inlets are harder or something i am talking on how good the fa18 is compared to others and how hard it is to make one, especially with bricky blocks that plane crazy has
creations-chat 2023-02-03 18:12:27 Idk man, i feel like the other one is cleaner, both are great though
creations-chat 2023-02-03 18:38:00 or just a person that is humble
creations-chat 2023-02-08 16:04:23 hey anyone knows how to make bombs that just launch straight forward
creations-chat 2023-02-08 16:06:56 ye i guess
creations-chat 2023-02-08 19:17:51 little modifications to the tutorial a4 skyhawk (cringe ik)
creations-chat 2023-02-08 19:22:15 
creations-chat 2023-02-08 19:31:56 It was my first tutorial build and i decided to go with something easy not overcomplicated
creations-chat 2023-02-08 19:35:36 Yep i do, well this was my first overall real aircraft so that's 1 thing and i don't really play a lot of plane crazy so that's another thing, also it's not my build so, all credits go to madvulpen i think that's what his nick was
creations-chat 2023-02-08 20:49:27 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwmJzAStdYs should i use the cluster bomb and 2 mini missiles from this video for the tutorial a4 skyhawk?
creations-chat 2023-02-08 20:55:53 + 2 rocket pods
creations-chat 2023-02-09 22:14:48 Pc community, what's the quote of the day

creations-chat 2023-04-09 07:57:56 Small ahh wings
creations-chat 2023-05-21 09:03:21 i wonder how a radar works in this game
creations-chat 2023-05-21 09:05:47 wait tf how does that work, i assume scripts. are there any non scripted radars? I saw an f14 that "had" one
creations-chat 2023-05-21 09:08:50 so are there any radars that dont use scripts and have missiles integrated in them?
creations-chat 2023-05-21 09:14:06 wasnt there one made in 2021
plane-crazy 2023-06-21 17:47:39 i wonder if someone made an actual radar, or like a thing that can lock bombs to a specific place
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 10:48:03 no freaking way a dev post
