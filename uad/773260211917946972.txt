plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:44:51 I have a question
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:45:01 how the everliving hecknuggets do I stop motor wobble
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:50:22 alright thanks, but is there any actual advice?
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:50:31 i see
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:51:51 motor 2 and like 4

plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:52:28 oh oof
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:52:37 well basically it's a bigg mech
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:52:42 under 200 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:52:52 but it reaches buildi height
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:53:10 i did
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:53:16 it do be wobblin tho
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:53:46 yes?
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:53:57 what
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:53:59 it's a mech
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:54:14 but that dont work as well
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:54:29 also locked motors dont work
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:54:36 like motor 2 do
plane-crazy 2021-02-19 21:55:22 eh, I could just shelf it for now and work on something else
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 01:33:26 I've been playing for over 200 hours and still can't
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 01:33:47 Same
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 01:33:58 Check out Red Cloud Studios for good mech tips
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:19:32 Hey lads, do any of yas know how to prevent motor 2 from aggressively wobbling?
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:21:12 I mean like for servos
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:21:45 I understand the joke, but this is a legitimate question
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:22:07 Ya done?
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:22:36 Mechs
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:22:44 O
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:22:46 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:23:06 Look up red cloud Studios, they have good mech stuff
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:23:17 I'm still trying get mine to stop wobbling
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:23:48 Oh that's a bigg boat
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:24:07 Then what is it?
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:24:27 ?
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:24:34 Oh nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:24:56 Bruh I don't think even my leviathan could sink that if it was a boat
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:25:06 Oh oof
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:25:26 That thing shouldn't be fast
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:25:31 That's terrifying
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:26:05 *fear*
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:26:54 Anyways I gtg, enjoy breathing
plane-crazy 2021-04-02 20:26:56 Also F
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:12:03 Hey lads, I've been tryna make a mech lately but keep running into issues. Do y'all have any advice?
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:12:45 Oh you know, motor wobble, sliding, tilting, turning, dysfunctional weapons, etc.
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:14:27 I mean like motor wobble with motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:15:02 Still 30
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:17:00 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:17:30 Oh no it got worse
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:17:48 If you want you can join me and see for yourself
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:17:55 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:18:17 4, density 10
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:19:26 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:20:03 It's gotten worse again
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:20:17 It's learned the electric slide
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:33:17 Hey lads, I'm planning on building an eight-legged spider mech, do any of y'all know how to do that?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:34:36 I have an airship that kinda functions as a shredder destroyer
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:35:00 Shredder bugs are unoriginal
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:35:19 Why, do you use shredders?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:35:47 Good
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:35:59 So you do have a positive iq
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:40:57 Alright so I think I figured out the spider legs thing, it's just gonna take a lot of motor 2s.
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:41:17 So wait how do you prevent aggressive motor wobble on motor 2?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:41:36 Crap
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:42:33 There is?
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:44:27 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-04-14 13:44:36 How about that
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 12:15:21 Eyo lads, do any of yas know how to make mech arms move properly?
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 12:15:38 Mine are incredibly shaky
creations-chat 2021-04-29 19:53:35 Bruh that's incredible
bot-central 2021-08-07 22:40:19 !rank
bot-central 2021-08-07 22:40:24 neat
help 2021-08-08 14:32:41 anyone know how to stop the goddamn motor wobble?
help 2021-08-08 14:54:53 Mechs. Legs, arms, etc.
help 2021-08-08 14:57:12 I found that less torque seems to work better, however it can tend to wobble even more while moving, especially with motor2. The problem with more torque is that it always makes the wobbling more... aggressive. How do I fix *that*?
help 2021-08-08 14:58:56 huh, so low torque for motor1 and high torque for motor2?
help 2021-08-08 15:00:41 Alright so let's review:
Motor 1: torque = good
Motor 2: torque = maybe good
help 2021-08-08 15:00:57 torque good or torque bad
help 2021-08-08 15:01:16 so torque bad
help 2021-08-08 15:01:21 torque bad on motor 2
help 2021-08-08 15:01:37 So how do I stop motor1 from moving around n shit while I'm moving?
help 2021-08-08 15:01:58 Aight so either torque 1 or torque 500
help 2021-08-08 15:02:02 cool
help 2021-08-08 15:02:27 But how do I stop motor 1 from moving around a bunch while I'm moving?
help 2021-08-08 15:02:43 Mech
help 2021-08-08 15:02:48 A flying one
help 2021-08-08 15:03:01 The arms always move n stuff while it's flying and then I have to correct them
help 2021-08-08 15:03:17 It's a controlled movement
help 2021-08-08 15:03:27 Like up-n-down type stuff for posing
help 2021-08-08 15:03:36 idk I think 150
help 2021-08-08 15:03:57 So more torque?
help 2021-08-08 15:04:09 oh cool
help 2021-08-08 15:04:21 Yeah that's actually exactly what I was looking for, thanks for helping

bot-central 2022-12-06 21:12:12 oh
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:00:07 even a picture of the grass would do lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:00:24 goddamn, the game is older than half the community
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:01:11 is there literally anything that I've said that would lead you to believe that?
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:01:36 says you lol

plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:04:08 mate I've been typing in english
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:04:29 I have been making sense
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:04:47 mayhaps you just need to reread what I've written
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:05:01 "my guy you were either born in or stuck in 2012"
makes perfect sense
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:05:20 ah, a fellow rainworld fan
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:05:25 never said it did lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:05:53 "I want to say that you looks like both to a 8yo player"
dude have you ever passed an english class
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:06:11 ah, makes sense
sorry
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:06:43 oh joy, rankism
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:06:54 "new member is intrensically stupid"
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:07:05 15
is this really necessary?
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:07:40 ah whoops
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:08:27 how the hell am I supposed to prove my age?
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:08:31 dont got a mic lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:08:55 "doesn't have a mic on his shiddy laptop, must be a 9 year old"
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:09:23 it amazes me that you people can make massive rockets in a lego game yet can't properly reason
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:09:32 lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:09:47 - builds epic planes in a lego game
- can't spell "brick"
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:10:04 bluename using their fucking color to excuse their dumbassery:
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:10:15 well idk what you do but you got an expert role
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:11:00 a defendant lacking evidence cannot be used as evidence
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:11:13 mate why do you think I'm british
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:11:26 I honestly expected better from this community
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:11:35 yall are supposed to be geniuses or somethin
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:12:45 ah yes, always assume negative intent
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:12:56 no fallacies there
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:13:07 "he hasn't provided proof, assume he's lying"
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:13:42 agreed
i've already stated that I'm 15
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:14:25 - man makes a plane over 2000 blocks
- can't properly reason
- immediately insults someone in an argument
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:15:05 your reasoning is flawed and your logic is floppy
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:15:18 how the hell is this community so toxic
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:15:34 - i dont have a mic
- assume im lying
- because that makes sense
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:15:45 miissing an o pal
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:15:50 it dont lol
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:16:16 well it'd be rude to stop a conversation so suddenly
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:16:31 but yall are the good players
you're supposed to *not* be braindead
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:17:18 nah you seem pretty reasonable
pretty sure it's just mig
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 15:17:37 maybe because people keep assuming we're underage?
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 16:28:42 angle locking could do it
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 16:28:57 takes up a lotta space tho
plane-crazy 2022-12-08 20:19:22 damn, that's an impressive amount of detail
