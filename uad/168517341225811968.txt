plane-crazy 2018-11-11 05:10:44 <@!251493349981159436> i find you are everywhere.
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 14:02:24 HMM but are the arena guns finally FE compatible???
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 08:29:05 It's a code that can't really be cracked
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 08:29:59 Its more of a password
plane-crazy 2018-11-16 08:30:34 Depends how you define it
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 05:24:53 dat sl0w
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 05:25:07 700+ speed or bust
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 05:28:15 how about 10k speed
plane-crazy 2018-11-17 05:28:26 <:GWchadMEGATHINK:366999806343774218>
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:28:58 well there is a rule about talking about controversial topics, not sure about that though
bug-reports 2018-11-18 02:35:39 [PVP mode] When I fire an arena gun in front of me it does damage to and removes parts of my character.
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:36:40 uhhh... i got shot by my own arena guns and tried to unload
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:37:13 yes very
plane-crazy 2018-11-18 02:38:49 this is getting annoying when trying to shoot people
bug-reports 2018-11-18 02:46:47 that's dum cause a normal bullet's velocity would add to the velocity of the thing firing it
bug-reports 2018-11-18 02:47:27 wait.. it goes through the glass too
bug-reports 2018-11-22 02:21:02 Are the guns both client and server side? It's causing the physics replication to disconnect from the server when specific parts of assemblies are broken off.
bug-reports 2018-11-22 02:26:19 the problem mainly is that the yellow lines also seem to do damage, and when those do it messes up the physics replication
bug-reports 2018-11-22 02:26:37 like, it causes planes to fly around even if you don't see the wings on them
bug-reports 2018-11-22 02:34:37 also, combat rockets keep getting stuck.
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 07:37:34 Build your mom the size of the Statue of Liberty. No, I'm not being sarcastic.

plane-crazy 2018-12-09 07:59:39 Anything that can fly like a plane but takes off vertically is pretty much a vtol
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 08:00:32 I'm just thinking of rotor tilting vehicles

plane-crazy 2018-12-09 08:01:33 I'm thinking of a type being in a group and not a type defining a group
