creations-chat 2022-01-15 14:10:13 if u wanna ask why my wings is like on mig-29 cause the part on screen is not look really good in my mind (well maybe irl its fine)
bug-reports 2022-01-17 05:33:30 Something wrong with the save
bug-reports 2022-01-17 05:36:13 i tried it
bug-reports 2022-01-17 05:36:16 didnt help
bug-reports 2022-01-17 05:38:53 :/
bug-reports 2022-01-17 05:39:17 then im just gonna keep recoloring it , as its important for wing design
bug-reports 2022-01-17 06:24:17 it happens due to little fps
bug-reports 2022-01-17 06:27:45 its hard to see the wobble , but i tried to show it by making my fps cap 30
bug-reports 2022-01-17 06:28:15 the solution is using less graphics or use fps unlocker
bug-reports 2022-01-17 06:30:38 or its just another bug idk
bug-reports 2022-01-17 07:08:32 the answer no . Fps Unlocker unlocks fps and if your pc is powerfull it will increase
bug-reports 2022-01-17 07:08:49 but its not a save for weak devices
bug-reports 2022-01-17 09:24:23 how is it bug
bug-reports 2022-01-17 09:24:52 it happens only if the BLUE PART has another color , if they are the same colour it wont happen
bug-reports 2022-01-17 09:42:10 the same color = no bug 
different colors = bug
for dumb
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:33:56 
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:34:05 if these parts have different colors
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:34:10 the bug happens
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:34:29 if the color is the same
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:34:42 then nothing happens
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:35:13 k
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:35:28 it saves the color now
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:36:15 there is no , but i would say that its 50 / 50 solution
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:39:56 
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:40:53 no
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:40:56 it wont save
bug-reports 2022-01-17 10:41:08 if one part is using another color
bug-reports 2022-01-17 11:48:36 never happend to me

the-dump 2022-06-10 11:25:33 ?
the-dump 2022-06-10 14:55:58 I agree , it's quite fun game to play . Customise ( build own thing ) is the main feature of this game in my mind

creations-chat 2022-08-30 12:01:44 dude , looks doesn't depend on your build , we must talk about mistakes or anything like that , but you compare it with the help of upvotes and looks genius

creations-chat 2022-10-06 02:24:51 Bug , if you place it horizontal way it does the funny
creations-chat 2022-10-06 02:26:54 Later , i need to fix wing swap , make lerx , add weapons , try to add windoscreen and a lot of stuff
creations-chat 2022-10-06 02:32:48 Ok ok i will make new lerx with custom angle
creations-chat 2022-10-06 02:35:31 Maybe intake ones
creations-chat 2022-10-06 02:37:46 Wdym , there is a lot of free space
creations-chat 2022-10-06 02:39:49 Head ? Front?
creations-chat 2022-10-06 02:41:52 Alr , but the main thing i want to fix is lerx
plane-crazy 2022-10-07 09:50:03 bruh
creations-chat 2022-10-26 14:11:09 Mig-27 wings are impossible to make accurate in Plane Crazy . Maybe the angle
creations-chat 2022-10-26 14:19:19 Firsly Mig-23BN . Secondly the wing must have the same angle as the lerx , even making the wing like this ain't helping . Or i could make the plane shorter which will break the entire plane
creations-chat 2022-10-26 14:21:38 had you tried looking at the post
creations-chat 2022-10-26 14:35:12 Basically a Mig-27 . I don't see any difference between them . It's just a modification of Mig-23B https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDfhHJAzxu4
creations-chat 2022-10-26 14:45:03 mig 23 bn is a modification of mig 23b , it was modified
creations-chat 2022-10-26 15:09:53 brrrrrrrrt . I tried using cylinders , looked ugly af , i had tried it on my previous Mig-27
