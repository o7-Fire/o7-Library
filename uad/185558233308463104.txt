plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:51:57 gotta keep it real with ya
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:52:02 ain't nobody give a hoot
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:52:16 rules
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:53:17 you should make something where people can only talk in chats after they do a certain thing in <#490305554556911646>
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:53:23 which therefore forces people to read the rules
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:53:47 uhuh
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:53:49 do that then
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:54:00 yeah i know
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:54:12 what i'm requesting is a server owner or admin should get a bot that does that
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:54:21 i don't know, pass on the message?
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:54:36 if there's nothing explicitly demanding people read the rules, nobody's gonna read the fucking rules
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:54:49 this came from a conversation
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:54:58 it would have no context if mid-sentence i started typing in <#497865146266419200>
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:55:11 ok you put it there then
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:55:38 yeah i'm not gonna retype all that
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:56:20 if you say 'the only thing keeping you in this server is <#490305554556911646> ' and then freak out when people don't read the rules which half the people don't even know is there
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:56:30 somethin's knocked in your dome
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:56:45 evidence
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:57:01 maybe you do
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:57:02 many people don't
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:57:09 it isn't
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:57:15 everyone *should* love eachother and not fight
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:57:17 but they do
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:57:23 i do but some people don't
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:57:43 at least make it so the bot says "welcome to the server, read the rules please"
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:57:45 i did read the rules
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:57:51 
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:58:04 ^ that'll happen too
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:58:25 i had it ticked before
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:58:34 i can't prove this but you'll have to take my word on it i suppose
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:58:58 i ticked it after you'd said "please read the rules" because i didn't see it before then to be honest
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:59:25 just make the bot say "welcome @user, please read <#490305554556911646> before anything else!"
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 05:59:31 i'll post that in suggestions
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:00:06 some people are stupid and you have to accept that
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:00:16 they need to be explicitly told to read rules
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:00:17 or they won't
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:00:57 some people may view that as not making it a given that one must read the rules
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:01:11 'cos most servers do that
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:01:27 idk man just a suggestion
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:02:25 sorry if i'm comin off as aggressive
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:04:01 <#384021699466756107>
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:04:07 because that's what it started me in
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:04:29 even changing the starting channel to <#490305554556911646> could make a difference
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:04:33 yeah
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:23:33 <@!163143541160148992> why's it the only game you can play?
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:23:59 o
plane-crazy 2018-10-14 06:34:02 my fav is the axe that you implant into someone and they scream until they bleed to death
the-dump 2018-10-15 02:06:01 wh
the-dump 2018-10-15 02:06:08 how is that sexual
the-dump 2018-10-15 02:06:19 the people talking about people making "massive flying cocks" isn't sexual
the-dump 2018-10-15 02:06:20 ok
the-dump 2018-10-15 02:06:59 whatever
the-dump 2018-10-15 02:20:59 i really don't see how that's 18+ though
the-dump 2018-10-15 02:21:09 "your mom" jokes aren't inherently sexual
the-dump 2018-10-15 02:21:46 whatever man
the-dump 2018-10-15 02:22:39 fixed it
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:09:39 "plane"
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:09:52 box with jet engines is more accurate
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:10:10 a plane is a pretty box with jet engines
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:10:22 that's just a cube with jetspam
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:16:41 there's no way that plane is 500 blocks exactly
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:16:48 it doesn't look anywhre near 500
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:17:08 your buddy probably just made his tin can then spammed blocks until it was exactly 500 and then thought that would be good
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:17:26 the block count being exactly 500 is very suspicious to me
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:18:19 he's cheating the system
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:18:21 do you not see
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:18:29 IT'S EXACTLY 500!!!!
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:18:39 no way in hell that piece of shit is 500 blocks
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:18:55 not even on the plane though
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:19:00 he spammed random blocks out side of his plane
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:19:05 no there's not enough room inside the plane
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:19:39 and you must have some absolutely insane luck to get enough space inside that plane to have exactly 500 blocks on the dot
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:20:03 even then, it would be way too heavy to be properly supported by those thin chicken bone wings
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:20:16 and helium would totally mess up the flying dynamics of it
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:20:37 i'd like to join his server and see his baseplate
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:20:46 yeah but not fly properly
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:20:57 that shit would float upwards
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:21:28 that sounds perfect
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:21:29 thank you
plane-crazy 2018-10-16 21:22:43 also since there's no proof he took the picture, the other dude who sent the pic of his carrier could have taken a picture of his own saveslot that has nothing to do with the plane
