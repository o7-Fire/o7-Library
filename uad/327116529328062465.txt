The Tale of cryetone (327116529328062465)
plane-crazy 2020-08-04 20:56:27 Hey guys
help 2020-08-04 21:00:35 I kinda need some help on a build idea
I want to make a keyboard that copies my key strokes. I am only hoping to do wasd but I cant find a solution...
help 2020-08-04 21:04:06 I am not in game rn.
help 2020-08-04 21:04:14 I am just trying to think it over
help 2020-08-04 21:04:50 It needs to be able to be pulled down but be able to go back up when untoggled.
help 2020-08-04 21:05:15 I was thinking springs and ropes
help 2020-08-04 21:05:27 But ropes require me to hold the key down
help 2020-08-04 21:06:10 Pistons work in a reverse way, they push up, it looks ok but not what I'm going for
