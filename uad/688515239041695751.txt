plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:28:08 I'm talking fully functional giant mech
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:28:17 fully working sn10 starship
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:28:37 It's amazing if I get a clip later I'll convert it into a gif or something so y'all can see
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:29:35 Nahhh trust me
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:29:36 <@414359638302130176>

plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:29:55 Literally something out of a different game idk how to explain it
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:30:05 once you see his stuff you'll think twice
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:30:19 its almost like he spent over 10 hours on it
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:30:24 It was amazing
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:30:47 the mech would get back up itself whenever it fell and it walked properly and everything no issues at all
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:31:01 The starship did the belly flop menouver flawlessly
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:31:35 the whole server flocked towards him it was really cool
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:32:15 He left a few mins ago
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:32:25 I'll send some clips once he comes back online
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 10:32:32 I think he has a YouTube channel it might be there

plane-crazy 2021-03-18 11:20:34 I don't think the co-pilot can use the weapons from what i've witnessed
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 11:20:38 i might be wrong tho
plane-crazy 2021-03-18 11:21:02 but yeah the co-pilot (pilot seat) can basically do everything
