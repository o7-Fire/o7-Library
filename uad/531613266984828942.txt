general 2022-07-24 13:40:27 they need to add vr support so you can control motors with vr and stuff
general 2022-07-24 13:40:34 then you can use vr to control a mech
general 2022-07-24 13:41:38 also vr controls with a mech would be so fun just shove a camera on the head
general 2022-07-24 13:41:51 especially full body tracking
general 2022-07-24 13:42:10 what
general 2022-07-24 13:42:42 you dont need to move with vr
general 2022-07-24 13:42:56 you can add some bindings for movement on the controllers

bug-reports 2022-08-01 08:31:16 Sometimes it used to happen to me even if i spawned in base
creations-chat 2022-08-01 15:47:36 well design and decor wise i would say so but i only add new rooms every so often if it feels like something needs to be added
creations-chat 2022-08-01 15:51:30 you could say that however it isnt "complete" right now because i need to smooth out the exterior edges and make it more appealing from the outside too
creations-chat 2022-08-01 15:55:21 ok ima remove it and move it

plane-crazy 2022-08-01 22:55:44 You might have uneven center of mass toward the front
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 22:58:25 <@731358316575588352>  show an image of the plane
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 23:00:00 How slow is the pitching down
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 23:00:22 Because if it is very slow then helium would make it pitch up
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 23:00:54 Ok

<:BIG3:588443788721258534> <:BIG4:588443798842114088>
Ok
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 23:01:46 ?
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 23:06:28 I reckon its the center of mass leaning forward
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 23:06:59 A block of helium might work but i think it affects stability
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 23:07:30 Or try some ballast in the back
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 23:07:41 Not 100% sure
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 23:08:10 Too much weight on the ballast and you will pitch upwards
plane-crazy 2022-08-01 23:16:08 Np

general 2022-08-09 09:47:26 Im making a helicopter with realistic movement
general 2022-08-09 09:47:44 Where the top rotor tilts forwards/back/sideways
general 2022-08-09 09:47:57 But it moves slowly rn
general 2022-08-09 09:48:34 Dont most helicopters have engines on them to make it go faster or is it all in the top propeller tilting?
general 2022-08-09 09:49:26 Because my heli is slow going forwards/backwards
general 2022-08-09 09:49:43 And i know some helis have engines on them to move faster

general 2022-08-09 09:54:15 Lol
general 2022-08-09 09:54:36 I have a vr and hopefully later this year i will get full body tracking
general 2022-08-09 09:54:56 Link full body to a mech <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>

general 2022-08-09 09:58:23 What coding does roblox use
general 2022-08-09 09:58:35 And how long would it take to make
general 2022-08-09 09:58:40 Lol
general 2022-08-09 09:59:27 Just hand controllers wouldnt take too long but full body would probs take forever
general 2022-08-09 10:00:25 I know some C# but it isnt supported in roblox and it uses lua isnt lua like one of the worst coding languages
general 2022-08-09 10:00:30 Or least common
general 2022-08-09 10:02:53 How long would making simple vr controller tracking take
general 2022-08-09 10:03:59 Dam
general 2022-08-09 10:04:31 So it does exist?
general 2022-08-09 10:05:08 Im not talking about tracking software

general 2022-08-09 10:08:52 Once i saw some guy with a big plane that had no wedges and could just about fly saying his builds were better than mine lol
general 2022-08-09 10:09:30 Yes ot someone crashed into it then the plane would fall lol
general 2022-08-09 10:09:34 If*
general 2022-08-09 10:09:54 Bc they didnt have enough engines or wing panels

general 2022-08-09 10:10:43 Lol
general 2022-08-09 10:11:10 They were saying that that plane was better than my facility with almost 10k blocks lol
general 2022-08-09 10:12:20 The facility doesnt have exterior design yet but interior looks pretty good since im redesigning and adding more decor
general 2022-08-09 10:13:02 Nice
general 2022-08-09 10:13:51 They need a thing to allow others to use special control seats that can only use certain keybinds/controls
general 2022-08-09 10:14:14 So you could make a turret on a car which someone else can use
general 2022-08-09 10:14:25 Lol
general 2022-08-09 10:15:48 Lol
general 2022-08-09 10:16:23 I wont be swithing games bc i dont wanna lose my old builds bc i spent ages planning and building them
general 2022-08-09 10:16:34 Like the facility
general 2022-08-09 10:16:54 To PC2 yes
general 2022-08-09 10:17:36 I gradually planned and built the facility room by room over the time of like 2 years

general 2022-08-09 10:21:17 For some reason the facility doesnt fall apart when i reset now
