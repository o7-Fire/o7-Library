general 2021-12-29 08:32:43 oh wow
general 2021-12-29 08:33:14 but that could be a typo as well or maybe hes actually 10 and trying to deny it

creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:26:32 I am new lol
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:33:07 so funny that I forgot to laugh 😑
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:36:13 I'm sorry but I didn't ask for a glass of your opinion 😑
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:38:32 Before you start pointing fingers make sure your hands are clean.
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:43:05 You don't even understand the context. Please keep your thoughts to yourself if they are supposed to offend others. Basic thing. I am not trying to start a fight here just using my brain. Period. 💀
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:45:09 no, we were talking about the helicopter and he just sweared at me for no reason lol
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:47:37 yes, because people are toxic and the rules say not to swear. I prefer the rules instead of toxic people. 😕
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:49:54 yes but it still counts as an offence and it is not allowed to be directed at someone.
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:52:28 Anyway, gonna play my game, not gonna spend my precious time wasting it on an argument that will never be solved. It's common sense cmon guys. I know you can do better, what is toxicity even for? This is an answer I'll prob never know. 🤔
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:54:53 I didn’t realize you all were experts on my life and how I should live it. Continue while I take notes.
creations-chat 2022-01-10 12:58:21 <@&706009538897117185> Where are you at? Look at this, just being toxic and not respecting. Please take the actions you need to take, thanks.
creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:00:37 "Let’s change the subject. I’m bored.” 😑 

<@!668392684729139201> Thats a fine looking build.

creations-chat 2022-02-19 07:59:41 looks very good. Maybe something could be more detail. The black part (where the stages separate) I think should not be just a stripe but its up to you.

Also the back of the yacht will look VERY different than what it is now. Thanks.
creations-chat 2022-07-17 15:27:33 also do not mind pinging me for feedback and suggestions. I also forgot to say that in the hull, there will be 2 floors not 1 as it is now.

creations-chat 2022-09-05 13:22:36 because i was somehow floating and then i became a dwarf by trying to ragdoll <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
creations-chat 2022-09-05 13:33:06 how is fa18 canopy? i tried using some angle lock since im new to it
creations-chat 2022-09-05 13:36:18 i havent decided yet but maybe dual seater and i know that i'll need to make it longer
creations-chat 2022-09-05 14:08:56 I am not copying anyone and I can tell you many people have a similar canopy design to urs without knowing of course
creations-chat 2022-09-05 14:11:09 I do not copy because I know the feeling when someone copies you and it’s frustrating  and when I want to, I make sure to ask
creations-chat 2022-09-05 14:13:11 Dude what did I just tell you. Plus my canopy isn’t even done yet so how can you even judge. Also I don’t want to argue for stupid stuff like this just understand that my canopy might look similar but isn’t a copy
creations-chat 2022-09-05 14:17:40 Dude I know I might have a similar canopy to you but it doesn’t mean it’s the same and you can’t accuse me because it’s not even totally the same and it’s not even finished (that means it might be even changed drastically). It’s just stupid to keep accusing me at this point when I told you multiple times.
creations-chat 2022-09-05 14:20:30 Ok it might be bad looking for you but for me it honestly looks fine plus I’m new to angle lock and I’m proud of what I’ve done
creations-chat 2022-09-05 14:26:22 My guy why you being aggressive all of a sudden for no reason lol I can just angle lock or whatever I’ll find a solution to it
creations-chat 2022-09-07 08:35:15 how's the 3rd floor of my yacht? I am currently working on the lights so some parts are dark for the moment
creations-chat 2022-09-07 08:46:19 Thanks
creations-chat 2022-09-07 08:49:43 this is the outside view (yacht is about 80% done so some parts are not done like the uncoloured helium blocks on the back) oh yeah and this was highly inspired by the Benetti FB284 but it has a fully custom interior and some exterior changes
creations-chat 2022-09-07 08:51:51 the sheer size of this though....
creations-chat 2022-09-07 08:57:51 of course it has and angle lock as well in some parts. this is just the back and a lot of it is in the interior as well like the circular seating area (i send screenshot of that before scroll up if you want)
creations-chat 2022-09-07 09:00:03 Yes lol I just wanted to show how I broke my brain trying to do this
creations-chat 2022-09-07 09:03:36 I really like how the bar came out though (the pool table kinda blocking the view but you can still see most of it)
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:47:31 guys how's the sauna in my super yacht? I just made it and would like some feedback
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:49:46 oo that might be a nice idea. maybe like a subtle steam with a smoke pipe?
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:51:55 ok then thanks for idea
creations-chat 2022-09-08 14:57:09 me rn chilling with popcorn seeing how this scene unfolds

creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:48:49 glxct really doesn't have time to do something productive but instead he argues.... (i do not want to get involved in this i'm just saying....)
creations-chat 2022-09-08 15:50:53 this server deserves the medal for the most childish and toxic people (it isn't something to be proud about kids)

creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:44:25 hows my yacht guys (not done yet)
creations-chat 2022-09-09 11:49:14 No as it’s highly based off the Benetti FB284 but it’s extended and the bow is different from the real one <@725269236125138965>
creations-chat 2022-09-09 13:25:29 Thanks

creations-chat 2022-11-06 21:34:31 what do you think of the new lounge area on my super yacht?

creations-chat 2022-11-06 21:40:19 yep thats what its meant to be lol. this is another lounge area on another floor btw
