general 2023-03-13 04:18:08 list was too long
general 2023-03-13 04:54:00 The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater)
general 2023-03-14 02:15:30 canadians

general 2023-03-14 02:18:53 A-10 has more Blue on Blue incidents than any other USAF aircraft combined, it also has the highest number of civilians killed out of any aircraft, and those numbers only started being recorded in 2005 iirc
general 2023-03-14 02:18:59 in short
general 2023-03-14 02:19:04 FUCK the A-10

general 2023-03-14 02:24:12 general electric considers any shot landing at the most 8 METERS away from  where the pilot was aiming "accurate". it also is "accurate" 50% of the time.
