creations-chat 2021-09-19 18:56:00 I can't comprehend how you can quit the game but not the community
creations-chat 2021-09-19 18:59:16 limitations come with challenges, and that 's more fun to build with for me

plane-crazy 2021-09-19 19:03:48 looks like a rushed attempt to convert a random car for combat
creations-chat 2021-09-19 19:05:46 I would put plot limits down to prevent server laggers mostly, and help with servers that have multiple big builds

plane-crazy 2021-09-19 19:06:09 1x4 triangles
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 19:06:25 it's a 2x4 sharp wedge in total
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 19:06:48 that's as sharp as it gets in terms of pointed noses without motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-09-19 19:17:23 maybe less rush
