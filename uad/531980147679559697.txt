plane-crazy 2021-05-17 21:32:27 You can't even detect curse words but you consider 2 messages as spam, YOU HAD ONE JOB
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 21:33:07 The bot literally said "language!"
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 21:33:54 Well shit why didn't you tell me sooner?
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 21:34:41 Oh yeah I forgot about that
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 21:35:58 Rules for the game? Since when? It's fucking anarchy over here
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 03:52:06 Literally everyone: "WASD for motors is better than making it mouse controlled" Mouse controlled motors:
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 03:52:51 Lmao
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 03:53:35 What the hell is that plane on?
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 03:57:38 I can't believe i'm trying to make a crazy ambitious motor locked abomination that I call the "Death triangle" when I could just get a mouse controlled jet lmao. I only wanted to do it because I just wanted to confuse the shit out of people, plus it would be horrifying(why did it revert to triangle?) to see a triangle zooming toward you.
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 03:59:42 I'm not even close to getting it done but it will be, if I cram a shit ton of motor locks into one space.
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:00:32 I'm still working on the features that it'll have, right now i'm experimenting, trust me it's a pain in the ass.
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:02:11 I gotta get a gun turret, some turning, lots of rockets, a layer of tnt armor so it doesn't die instantly, and a glitch that is only known by me and two other people crammed in there.
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:02:41 I knew it was motor locked lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:04:19 I just want to give you a little hint about the glitch that i'll be using, it makes anything with moving parts(motor 2s) my bitch lmao.
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:05:11 At this point it's the only way to hard counter those damn omni bugs.
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:06:07 At least most shredder users are gone
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:07:04 S T R E S S
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:07:29 Damn that mech is T H I C C
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:09:11 I hate turret abusers so much, almost as much as those stupid omni bug spammers that use blacklist
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:10:42 I mean stationary turrets that camp your spawn and nothing else, it's fine if it's on another build but if it's on its own, then that's just lame.
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:11:44 Someone should AC-130 above their asses
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:12:54 Hol up
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:13:42 Hold on, what about a motor locked hover engine lmao?
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 04:15:47 So if I want to steer well, what engine do I use? I have a problem with the conveyor engine but that may just be me.
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:22:18 https://tenor.com/view/nick-young-question-marks-what-excuse-me-huh-gif-4486363
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:23:29 In what way lmao
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:24:15 Understandable have a nice day
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:25:02 That gave me an idea
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:25:28 I thought you could kill them by how damn fast you go
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:26:24 It has so many thrusters what do you mean?
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:26:53 F
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:27:08 Can it hover or no?
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:29:07 How can you make it fall slow or slow down really fast? I never understood how builds could do that
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:29:24 Omni bugs especially
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:29:54 I had a feeling it had to do with wing panels
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:30:15 Me who motor-locks mine
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:30:50 Damn that's huge
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:31:25 Does it lag due to the sheer number of objects or is it something else?
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:31:38 Fucking death shuriken
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:32:38 Does it lag for you as well?
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:32:58 Then why do you only go 360?
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:33:21 Oh yeah that
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:34:30 What shape do you guys want me to make? It has to be 2D lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:35:16 I'm going to try and make it as overpowered as possible
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:36:02 An overpowered server killer
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:36:29 And plus people get to see shapes just hurling towards them lmao
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:37:01 OP duhhhhhhhhhh
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:37:18 Just a random shape, not too complex
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:38:17 2 dimensional
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:38:37 Plus I probably couldn't build a circle if I tried
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:38:48 Or get a lot of stuff on it
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 05:40:30 Imma just do a square lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 16:01:31 Let me kill it please
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 16:03:13 RIP
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 16:03:28 I wanted to improve my build and then kill it
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 16:25:56 No
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 16:26:10 RIH means Rot In Hell
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 16:42:01 You mean a hex color code right?
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 16:42:19 What orange are you talking about?
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 16:43:42 RIH, that was a typo lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 17:15:45 My build is so broken that homing missiles can't hit me while i'm still

plane-crazy 2021-07-07 17:10:26 Works against shredders really well
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 17:13:54 Ball shredders can't even touch my pvp build lmao
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 17:14:20 While i'm still
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 17:20:35 Invite me to the server real quick lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 17:21:13 Cloaked?
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 17:21:26 How?
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 17:21:50 We need proof lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 17:35:27 If they're building a build for PvP, i'm fine with it. However, if they're building something that isn't related to PvP, I just want them to leave and go to the non-PvP server.
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 17:36:48 Is that too much to ask for? Well it's yes for some stubborn people

plane-crazy 2021-07-07 23:20:42 What's a really good way to go about making my jet's movement mouse controlled?
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 00:15:40 Wrong reply
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 00:15:59 Cars aren't hard if you have a reference to model after
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 00:16:02 There
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 00:16:30 3D models too
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 00:18:40 Nothing is too hard to make(that doesn't require a bunch of motor locking) if you have something to model after. For example, building a tank from scratch is moderately hard, but choosing a tank to model after makes the process so much easier.
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 00:19:23 Looks familiar
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 00:20:59 The same goes for the jet below
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 00:21:29 Ohh you're using angled motor locking
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 03:08:21 That ASS

plane-crazy 2021-07-08 03:23:55 No, it's ok as long as you make the mech design original, and not off of a tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 16:36:00 I like how you encountered this train, two people in Discord that are in the same serverhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/862725672232026132/RobloxScreenShot20210709_000443859.png
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 16:59:47 I'll try lmao
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 18:42:49 What even is a paint block lmao
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 18:43:16 Is it a block after it is painted?
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 18:43:37 I've never seen it
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 18:45:45 You pretty much need to make the material fabric, and you can turn literally anything into a friction block.
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 18:46:09 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 18:46:50 But fabric can be used on any block while the friction block is just a cube
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 18:47:16 Imagine the addition of more friction blocks
plane-crazy 2021-07-08 19:49:05 I hate lag machines

plane-crazy 2021-11-07 03:53:45 It's just having a hard time lifting up or going down

plane-crazy 2021-11-11 04:08:12 3x3x3 is 3^3
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 04:08:55 There’s another plus sigh?
plane-crazy 2021-11-11 04:09:36 What if you put parenthesis around each of the 3+3s
