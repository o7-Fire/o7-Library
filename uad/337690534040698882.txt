help 2019-11-05 21:16:37 are there any ways to make a fighter jet canopy that comes down over the pilots that doesn't lag the plane making it move slower?
help 2019-11-05 21:32:50 originally it came down like _\\|
help 2019-11-05 21:33:59 
help 2019-11-05 21:35:02 helps with hiding wings
help 2019-11-05 21:37:27 its based on a real plane how am i supposed redo the wing placement? either way not the problem
help 2019-11-05 21:39:42 
help 2019-11-05 21:39:52 
help 2019-11-05 21:40:09 i couldn't make it more proportional
help 2019-11-05 21:45:28 the nose isn't what im having a problem with. the problem lies in the canopy slowing the plane down considerably. this is the canopy when down
help 2019-11-05 21:49:25 in reality its moving more around 100
help 2019-11-05 22:27:35 i see, i thought it was because of a "foreign object" colliding with the main body that was slowing it down

plane-crazy 2020-04-04 00:01:50 that pic
plane-crazy 2020-04-04 00:01:58 it could be a sign of long wedge
plane-crazy 2020-04-04 00:02:40 which if we're getting new wedges that'd be cool
plane-crazy 2020-04-04 00:03:25 perhaps its so yoiu can see the part
plane-crazy 2020-04-04 00:04:06 i hope its the new wedges

plane-crazy 2020-04-04 00:05:03 maybe? i was thinking its for drifting

the-dump 2020-04-04 20:58:30 lol
general 2020-04-05 03:12:52 it would be so awesome
bug-reports 2020-04-06 00:17:23 im not sure if this has been reported already but here goes
after using paintbucket tool for materials the load/save feature won't work in that i can't load in a creation i haven't tried saving yet but a friend of mine says it isn't working either
the account the bug happened on was: butterassasin123
bug-reports 2020-04-06 00:18:19 also in oreder to fix it another friend said that leaving and rejoining fixes
bug-reports 2020-04-06 00:18:38 this was done in a vip server so im not sure if it happens outside them
general 2020-04-06 21:28:02 okay so about that cryptic message fonkl said in announcements i think its a sign he's pregnant
general 2020-04-06 21:28:40 shall it be scrambled or sunny?
general 2020-04-06 21:44:30 if ya really wanna know
general 2020-04-06 21:44:39 you can't with it like that
general 2020-04-06 21:44:50 the best way i think
general 2020-04-06 21:45:54 would be to fold the nuke maybe 90 degrees upward on the main piece then it comes down to lay in its transport thing
general 2020-04-06 21:46:50 so rather than one fold its 2 folds one for the nuke and another for the transport/launcher
general 2020-04-06 21:54:38 no
creations-chat 2020-04-06 21:57:04 a custom ground attack aircraft i made

creations-chat 2020-04-06 21:59:15 nah i wanted it to be small
creations-chat 2020-04-06 22:00:02 no so its harder to hit
creations-chat 2020-04-06 22:01:31 also to the guy that said the wings should be bigger, im too afraid to change anything it was hard enough to balance because of its small size
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:17:00 im gonna cry if what ever went wrong is a data corruption
plane-crazy 2020-04-06 22:17:56 madattak

plane-crazy 2020-04-09 02:56:43 ok i need science people to explain something to me
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 02:56:49 so
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 02:56:54 during a mech fight
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 02:57:09 one mech will hit another and both will fly back
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 02:57:19 but at other times
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 02:57:31 only one goes flying back
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 02:57:42 why?
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:00:46 its kinda random
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:00:56 there could be a 5k block mech
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:01:03 and a 1k block mech
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:01:14 and the 1k could send the 5k flying
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:02:04 hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:28:27 <@!437078588701933568> i've thought of putting what basically amounts to grabs ban hammer on my arm
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:28:39 the only problem would be
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:29:08 newtons laws of motion
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:29:16 specifically
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:29:33 any force has an equal and opposite reaction
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:29:52 and the moment i stop moving the hammer
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:30:18 i would be facing 90 degrees from my original direction
plane-crazy 2020-04-09 03:30:36 or shot up 50 studs
general 2020-04-09 14:56:22 ngl i like this new event

plane-crazy 2020-04-15 17:25:46 If I've been bamboozled I just wanna say mods gay
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 00:58:21 I don't understand why people think it's possible to remove water from inside their creations, that's like asking to repeatedly add and remove terrain which I'm near 100% sure would get very laggy very quickly
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 01:00:11 I wish more people understood that fact
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 01:03:30 Honestly I don't think even with custom water its possible
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 01:05:18 Eh kinda hard to define what's inside and outside
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 01:06:13 If I remember right even sea of theaves has a hard time with water clipping into the craft
plane-crazy 2020-04-16 01:10:22 It should be a democratic process for what gets added and taken away

help 2020-04-27 18:56:01 is it possible to make a non coaxial helicopter that doesn't drift to one side?
help 2020-04-27 19:01:01 it tilts to one side and goes in that direcction
help 2020-04-27 19:01:13 without my input
help 2020-04-27 19:03:39 i've tried everything i can with the tail rotor to keep this from happening but nothing seems to help unless i put a thruster pushing it to away from the direction its trying to go
help 2020-04-27 19:04:25 however i don't want to use thrusters to keep it balanced
help 2020-04-27 19:07:00 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuSMhRKAkG8
skip to 0:13 and thats what is happening
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 02:44:56 am i missing something on my main rotor? i can pitch the blades individually and as a collective.
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 02:59:18 pitching tail rotors is hard
general 2020-04-28 19:20:39 i love it when the formatting doesn't cross over to the google doc
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 19:49:58 whats the most upvoted creation?
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 19:55:26 lol thanks
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 00:42:21 im so mad rn, the swashplate i've been making wasn't handling collective pitch control so i spent like 3 hours trying to fix it trying all sorts of different ways and finally i decide on a whim to add another motor the each control rod
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 00:42:27 and it works like a dream
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 00:50:12 i don't think theres images as rick hasn't said anything about em in <#529858892075761694>
help 2020-04-29 02:12:45 <@!386974424538152960> sorry for ping but do you know how can i stop my heli from continuously trying to go right without making it coaxial or am i asking for the impossible?
help 2020-04-29 02:25:46 yea what about it?
help 2020-04-29 02:26:22 it makes adequate thrust to counteract the rotation
help 2020-04-29 02:27:01 i found the word for what im trying to say and its translating tendency
help 2020-04-29 02:27:28 is what intentional?
help 2020-04-29 02:28:10 yea
help 2020-04-29 02:28:31 thats just a slope for climbing
help 2020-04-29 02:52:24 only thing attached to the heli that usually isn't there is the anchor block on a rope
help 2020-04-29 10:45:19 <@429826358827417601> I don't
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 14:48:42 no those legs aren't tutorial
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 05:33:42 thoughts on the new back fins and thrusters?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 05:33:56 
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 12:22:37 I'm no car builder but I imagen you build the chassis first and then a little bit above you make the shell
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 12:23:08 And connect em with lock motors
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 12:24:19 Yes essentially the pull a block half a block toward them
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 12:25:05 And allow for collisions between blocks
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 12:25:26 Super useful stuff
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 15:57:12 do large creations (+1k blocks) still explode when you put a motor 2 on them that doesn't have servo on?
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 15:58:09 servo makes it not mouse followed
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 15:58:31 no
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 15:58:44 im making a mech head and i want it to follow the mouse
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 15:59:13 but atm i can't test cause school work

plane-crazy 2020-05-06 18:32:10 nonsense
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 18:32:31 set the thrusters to the same keybind as the keybind used to make the legs bend
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 18:32:49 and make sure its on/off
plane-crazy 2020-05-06 19:02:01 <@!429379150185234442> for those size legs i think 1 super thruster should do

plane-crazy 2020-05-07 17:43:21 alright seems i wasn't clear by what i meant control length
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 17:43:50 i want to be able to have a max length that it won't stretch past
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 19:54:47 no, a more fitting place for it would be on a f-14 which is like the navy's counterpart to the f-15

plane-crazy 2020-05-08 02:39:01 Oh well it's good anyways
help 2020-05-08 19:05:02 adding weight will just make you sit lower in the water which is bad for obvious reasons so i recommend the you take some ballasts at the front put them below the water line and set them to 0.15 which will help make it float, if thats not enough you can add weight to the back
help 2020-05-08 19:53:15 np
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 23:44:50 Man if you think about it your average plane travels ~400 sps your only going 5% the speed of sound
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 01:17:23 is it based on anything?
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 01:21:27 mmm if they do make that plane i hope it doesn't have those ugly front pitch wings (i forget what the word for them is)

plane-crazy 2020-05-09 17:38:10 mmmmm i hope theres a range for how far away something has to be for noclip to take effect
plane-crazy 2020-05-09 17:38:27 otherwise mech fights are gonna get 100x harder

general 2020-07-27 02:06:54 but i admit defeat
general 2020-07-27 02:11:46 these in my opinion look alot more closer in species than 
 the brute on the right does to a bear

plane-crazy 2020-10-22 13:41:07 the pic/gif has to relate to the conversation
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 00:54:17 cobra
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 00:59:38 > What is the cause of builds spinning (even after aligning the mass weight and wings)?
<@456226577798135808> could be the thrust
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 00:59:57 if its not aligned with the center of mass
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:00:03 it can cause problems
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:00:53 no
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:01:22 i mean if your rocket engines/propellers/jets aren't aligned with you center of mass
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:01:26 you'll spin
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:01:43 and do loopty loops
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:04:13 i will say however that if your nose is heavy placing the thrust below the center of mass can help with that
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:05:34 agnus whats your thrust look like?
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:07:23 i know that putting a motor on some propeller blades can cause a plane to spin if its a single prop plane so is that the problem?
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:08:32 and which way does it spin?
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:09:57 try putting some vertical wing panels like this in the front of it
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:10:21 not control surfaces
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:10:29 wing panels
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:10:57 k
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:11:53 conveyor drives are powered by quantum mechanics
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:12:20 they either work or they don't
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:12:31 and the only way to find out is to test em
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 01:21:06 <@456226577798135808> any difference?

<@!588371976272216066> is it a reverse knee? If so i'd say it could use a bit more mass around the knee. If it's not a reverse knee then add a little more mass to the front of the knee so it extends out a little bit. (i assume its custom)

<@!720751430595772418> make a shaft then to 2 parallel sides place motor2's set power to 0, speed to 0, servo and toggle on then set the angle to 90 (this makes it unpowered and also have an angle limit). Attach some half blocks to the motor2's that go up about half the length of the main shaft

general 2020-12-07 21:50:10 motor 2 is far too weak
general 2020-12-07 21:50:34 it does
general 2020-12-07 21:51:00 but i suspect motor2 is like 100 torque maxed out
general 2020-12-07 21:51:24 and all the numbers inbetween 0 and 100.0 are the decimals
general 2020-12-07 21:51:51 not really
general 2020-12-07 21:52:07 alright
general 2020-12-07 21:52:32 specific angle you need and the part moves at high speed
general 2020-12-07 21:52:44 motor2 just doesn't cut it in those cases
general 2020-12-07 21:53:01 and camera isn't always the best solution either
general 2020-12-07 21:54:05 alrightt ill give the most specific example where a motor 2 just didn't cut it
general 2020-12-07 21:54:47 i made a swashplate a while back but it needed to be angled at 45 degrees from where it was in build mode other wise the heli wouldn't go straight
general 2020-12-07 21:55:10 and motor2 was my only choice at the time
general 2020-12-07 21:55:18 which caused lag
general 2020-12-07 21:56:43 normal motors can't go to a very specific angle then lock there unless your a god of accuracy
general 2020-12-07 21:58:58 are rabbits as lovey dovey as dogs?

plane-crazy 2020-12-08 15:29:29 whats the optimal number of main rotor blades on a helicopter?
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 15:34:22 that doesn't look ultra light
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 19:18:56 swashplate finally done
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 19:19:25 yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 19:19:51 70% of them re just locking
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:38:26 ill be honest the paint/material looks a bit flat
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:38:56 in terms of shape its good
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:39:52 want us to hold a funeral for you?
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:40:24 alright
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:41:35 it also needs a bigger prop
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:43:21 probably
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:45:36 oop didn't see it
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:45:54 sorry
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:49:08 if you want a cylinder that welds
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:49:17 use water prop 2
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 21:49:27 but be warned they're super heavy
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 22:09:02 <@!491570111787040778> gg
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:19:24 man those expectations are brutal sometimes
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:23:44 probably not
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:24:00 its like rolling double dice and trying to get 2 6's
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:25:32 its up to 90 now??
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:25:47 man im happy i got it at 60

plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:33:32 kinda wanna participate in the farming contest
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:33:48 same
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:36:16 after lots of hard work and wanting to cry i've got collective pitch in the tail rotor and main rotor
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:37:12 don't worry man
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:37:19 i hardly understand it
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:38:02 no
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:38:28 never really bothered with cars
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:40:05 this is it in build mode
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:41:23 ngl
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:41:33 making it an actual copter might make me cry
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:41:55 getting it this far has made me wanna pull my hair out
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:42:11 true
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:42:19 idk
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:42:25 maybe ill do it
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:42:29 yea i did
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:43:34 did they have a swashplate?
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:43:52 and thats why they were easy
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:45:00 took like 3 days of straight trial and error to get to this design
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:46:05 yea i made a rope driven swashplate and it killed my computer when in use
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:47:37 theres 2xmotor2s that are in line with the center
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:47:55 and they rotate that giant mass of motos
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:48:22 tail rotor on mine felt more complex than the main one
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:48:44 nah
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:48:52 i don't spin at a specific speed
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:48:57 i adjust the pitch
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:49:02 with a rope
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:49:24 figured it'd be better
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:49:45 yea but what happens when i lower the pitch on the main rotor
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:50:04 its not a full swashplate on the tail
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:50:25 just enough to collectively rotate the blades
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:51:06 
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:52:15 tbh
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:52:30 i didn't think about rotating the blades with a regular motor
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:53:44 well if it ain't broke don't fix it
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:54:06 and that exactly what im gonna live by in this situation
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 02:58:16 that curve up on the bow is good ngl

general 2020-12-15 01:21:58 <@357369485696434177> explosion sensitivity already exists, I think the name for it is impact speed
general 2020-12-15 01:22:32 Yea
general 2020-12-15 01:23:09 No
general 2020-12-15 01:25:08 Only tracers should be visible
general 2020-12-15 01:25:22 So it's no longer piss stream

plane-crazy 2020-12-15 04:21:49 because of the added mass

plane-crazy 2020-12-18 16:11:05 making new tail rotors is hard

plane-crazy 2020-12-18 16:27:10 not strong enough when you've only got 1 main rotor
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 16:27:41 no
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 16:27:50 thats not gonna work either
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 16:28:54 im trying to improve the tail rotor on this
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 16:29:24 i've put too much time into this project to do that

plane-crazy 2021-01-10 18:04:46 man i wish motors were stronger and the ground had more traction
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 18:05:17 then mechs could be true to their from instead of relying on thrusters and helium
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 18:05:49 fabric blocks and max torque only get you so far
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 18:06:07 they're not
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 18:06:28 if they were
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 18:06:37 i wouldn't need thrusters in my mechs
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 18:06:54 :|

When i hover it over the tablet its reading lower pressure levels than before which i assume is a somewhat good sign

plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:42:07 bro join me
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:42:17 not a single mech is copypaste
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:43:07 i've probably seen 30 variations of the b-2 bomber
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:46:42 hmm?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:46:48 i was talking to dread
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:48:05 thats a cap
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:48:20 exactly why we need this contest
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:48:57 hopefully it will if people still want contest winner
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:50:14 bruh every plane i've seen has the same window style based on the plane type
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:50:45 expose yourself more then bozo
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:51:12 i could pull up 3 pics of mechs that are wildly different in chest arms legs etc
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:51:54 you probably could
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:52:10 cause they are
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:52:19 B)
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:53:36 they are but they're mad boring looking in game
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:54:41 planes vs mechs
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:55:15 agreeable but we want mechs to be chosen for contest
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:55:47 
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:57:43 i have but theres like no moving parts in a plane other than landing gear and maybe the ability to hover if your making an osprey/f-35
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:57:56 maybe
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:58:12 BRO
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:58:17 WHAT MOVES ON A PLANE?
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 20:59:50 thats like half of it
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:00:25 forgetting elbows knees ankles sometimes fingers and toes
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:04:35 thats a cap
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:04:49 mechs need all the articulation they can get
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:05:38 sometimes its a luxury but most of the time you really do need 20 something joints
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:05:51 you do
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:05:59 i make pvp mechs for an example
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:06:13 mine have the most basic amount of joints
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:06:18 lik 7
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:06:38 and i lose more often to the mechs that have 20 or so
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:06:53 sure kid fight me in a mech
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:07:25 otherwise its cringe
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:07:38 i will
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:07:45 good
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:07:50 its settled then
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:13:11 i think we should end this by saying planes have been every other contest topic thats not boats since forever and i think its  time to spice things up
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:13:48 its not
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:13:49 but
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:14:22 transformers are included in mechs
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:14:32 so you could make a boat/plane/car too
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:15:09 but not when the contest is boat plane
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:15:23 float*
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:16:22 breh
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:16:24 they did
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:17:40 yea i'd prefer float planes
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:18:40 me too
plane-crazy 2021-09-03 21:19:12 it would be most poggers if ruins were switched for mechs

plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:10:21 not trying to be mean or anythings but whats up with all the activity in <#384025409945337856>? usually only the best builds reach past 90 upvotes
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:10:57 did i miss something?
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:11:10 i guess so
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:11:23 maybe its time for me to upload my mech i've been working on
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:13:08 become elitist get it appealed
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:13:56 yea like looking down on people without custom color names
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:15:56 i dont really like to either but i wouldnt be suprised if it happens
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:18:28 hmmm i feel like thats kinda right but kinda wrong
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:19:29 i mean i've seen masterful builds that got loads of upvotes but no rank
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:20:37 exactly why i said kinda right but kinda wrong too
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:22:48 squeeze more juice
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:23:22 also add more motorlocks
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:23:26 that seems to help
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:24:13 30 upvotes 5 downvotes
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:24:36 supercharger
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:25:26 probably would have to nice looking camo to avoid that fate but yea i've seen that too
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:25:47 good luck
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:26:34 idk sometimes a good color scheme can really bring a build to its full potential
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:27:15 yea that was wrong of me
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:27:26 meant complement
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:28:30 more opinion than facts
plane-crazy 2021-09-21 01:31:03 can i get some thoughts on this so far?

creations-chat 2021-11-23 17:22:28 am i missing something about the kyle build like is it a satire of him being a hero or something? im genuinely confused why that has so many upvotes
creations-chat 2021-11-23 17:47:32 
creations-chat 2021-11-23 17:53:35 <@736201072938582066> would you answer my question I posted above?
creations-chat 2021-11-23 20:11:46 I've done my research and from what I can conclude he shouldn't have been there and shouldn't be considered a hero unless of course, yall have some ulterior more sinister motives? If yall wanna discuss further in dm's sure I'm open to having my mind changed
creations-chat 2021-11-23 20:19:16 idk this probably?
creations-chat 2021-11-23 20:26:49 its mind blowing im seeing it happen before my eyes
creations-chat 2021-11-23 20:31:07 agreed, exactly why the build shouldnt have been posted
creations-chat 2021-11-23 20:38:48 i asked yall to take this to my dms if you wanna discuss further please pay attention next time

events-chat 2022-01-18 05:54:45 How big are the mechs in your experience based on plot height
events-chat 2022-01-18 05:57:51 In my experience there much more cordination involved than swinging first
events-chat 2022-01-18 05:58:30 Ight I'll ping you tomorrow rn tho I need sleep
events-chat 2022-01-18 05:59:59 I won't I'll send you a vid of me parrying a friend and probably some attempts at out maneuvering

events-chat 2022-01-18 23:15:34 Yep I was gaslight from my memories of cool moments during mech fights. I mean they're still cool to me just maybe not from an outsider's perspective
events-chat 2022-01-18 23:18:24 What if 2 events at seperate times if we do multiple hosts

events-chat 2022-01-19 22:35:42 That particular mech could spin its chest so no point
events-chat 2022-01-19 22:36:15 Pretty fast
events-chat 2022-01-19 22:37:07 Yep
events-chat 2022-01-19 22:38:48 No amount of cutting will break those legs

events-chat 2022-01-22 21:15:29 it is a grandpa mech but its how the best mechs (sorry not sorry rbk) work
events-chat 2022-01-22 21:16:09 besides creative freedom is the best part about making mechs
events-chat 2022-01-23 15:35:29 severe skill issue, most mechs are pressing 2 buttons back and forth to walk while sometimes adjusting the chest position/speed
events-chat 2022-01-23 15:36:00 hardly ever have to press more than 3 buttons at a time
events-chat 2022-01-23 16:05:17 yea thats about right, some mechs use up to 6 per arm but its not that bad if you know what your doing <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-01-23 16:33:39 we dont do that in sbe üóø

events-chat 2022-01-30 23:18:50 helium and tnt
events-chat 2022-01-30 23:19:15 not if you balance it right
events-chat 2022-01-30 23:19:54 i think best option would be 1-2 helium blocks 1 tnt and 1 ballast
events-chat 2022-01-30 23:20:12 explosives are banned?

Like in the past I remember even moderately good builds would still be positive. Looking at it now builds like this which atleast to me dont look half bad are way negative.
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 20:25:26 What about it is bad?
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 20:26:11 I've noticed your either in the hundreds or negatives hardly any inbetween
plane-crazy 2022-03-18 20:27:13 I mean yea but I dont think the attempt is that bad

contest-chat 2022-06-24 09:41:23 it doesnt even specify you have to build mechs
contest-chat 2022-06-24 09:43:33 you could build this which is infinitely better than a triangle with a brick dangling off it
contest-chat 2022-06-24 09:46:17 titanfall brick better than space dorito
contest-chat 2022-06-24 09:48:02 man i wanna play tf2 campaign again

contest-chat 2022-06-24 19:33:26 Infinetely more based than anyone who voted starwars
contest-chat 2022-06-24 20:10:35 I only vaguely know what destiny is I'd hope its cool
contest-chat 2022-06-24 22:00:31 preach my brother, theres more to tf than just mechs
contest-chat 2022-06-24 22:01:23 
contest-chat 2022-06-24 22:01:50 some concept art in there but most does appear in game
