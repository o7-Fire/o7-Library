general 2023-04-05 15:09:31 Dans la constitution royale de 1791, elle stipulait que montréal allait être divisé en deux parties ; Le haut canada et le bas Canada. Le bas canada est majoritairement composé de personnes françaises (Canadiens français) et le haut Canada est composé majoritairement de Britanniques, des lois civiles anglaises et lois civiles anglaise. La population est mineure en terme de français au haut Canada. De plus, le fait que le haut canada soit nommé ainsi est lié au faut que les chutes du niagara est leur frontière, le haut canada est en haut des chutes. Je ne sais pas pourquoi je parle de ça j'ai des flashback de mes cours d'histoire de il y a 2 ans. I didn't know what subject to use LOL

help 2023-04-06 04:21:38 i've been creating a suspension system for a jeep rubicon i am planning to do, and i've realised the back part of my system doesn't lift, the error might have occured in the pistons, motor blocks, or suspension i am still unsure. The problem here is that i can't locate the error at all because i, myself reproduced the same thing i did with the front part, so i'm unsure where the error might be located and i would need someone to help me 😭

general 2023-04-06 17:54:48 you hate me then lol i eat a lot, very diversified but i do eat fat and sugar, i go to the gym and i never gain weight even after eating a ton of food, well i do gain weight a little but not fat weight, mostly muscular weight
general 2023-04-06 17:55:20 my body is just like that
general 2023-04-06 17:55:32 burns most of the fat
general 2023-04-06 17:55:52 damn..
general 2023-04-06 17:56:04 lol
general 2023-04-06 17:56:18 the weight means nothing, because muscular weight is also counted
general 2023-04-06 17:56:29 don'T ever stop eating dawg
general 2023-04-06 17:56:31 🔫
general 2023-04-06 17:56:39 bad

general 2023-04-06 17:56:54 bro wth
general 2023-04-06 17:56:57 💀
general 2023-04-06 17:57:17 bro took the "burning the fat" expression too far LOL
general 2023-04-06 17:57:29 totally not
general 2023-04-06 17:57:50 w tonk
general 2023-04-06 17:57:58 tbh
general 2023-04-06 17:58:06 it actually does but whatever
general 2023-04-06 17:58:15 it doesn't matters actually
general 2023-04-06 17:58:23 but if you want to gain or lose fat yes
general 2023-04-06 17:59:56 going to the gym and slowly stop eating a lot of bad fat (as some animal fat for example) and i presise SLOWLY, you need to get your body used slowly to digesting this kind of food and actually using it
general 2023-04-06 18:00:18 well animal fat is okay i guess, but not too much, because if you take too much well then yk
general 2023-04-06 18:01:20 you just need to slowly start getting used to it! our mind loves sugarized, fat, and salty things, everything that a fast food offers, it's a trap let's say.
general 2023-04-06 18:01:26 why
general 2023-04-06 18:01:31 cabbage is so good!
general 2023-04-06 18:01:53 i mean i personnaly love it
general 2023-04-06 18:02:30 it looks funny
general 2023-04-06 18:02:35 fatal?
general 2023-04-06 18:02:38 fatal as in?
general 2023-04-06 18:02:44 your mind telling you no no
general 2023-04-06 18:05:02 trust me the trick is to slowly get used to eating healthy things, remember, meat is extremlly healthy but can also be unhealthy in big quantity and depending on the sort of meat. also sometimes (as in one time every week- 2 times every week) you can give yourself a treat, as a little chocolate bar, this will help your brain tell you if you eat well all wekk then sometimes you could get a little treat right.
general 2023-04-06 18:05:27 lol
general 2023-04-06 18:05:34 damn
general 2023-04-06 18:05:40 your brain is rejecting it
