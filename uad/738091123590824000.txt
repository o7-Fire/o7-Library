But all I can do is accept the world I live in and hug my body pillow next to me. Life is short and not going great. And never will. But that's life.

plane-crazy 2022-05-04 13:54:57 Get good
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 13:55:12 And obtain grammatical skill
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 15:26:56 Coaxial helicopters are cringe
Unless they are intermeshing
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 15:27:56 Also cringe fake rotor coaxial
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 15:28:25 I still don't know how she did it
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 15:28:32 Fucking legend
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 15:29:58 I've tried doing a realistic counter torque tail rotor on conventional designs but without any actual gears or ratios from the engine output I can't do a good one
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 15:30:18 So I just pull a rotodyne and make the props rocket powered
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 15:31:17 This is an old one yuck
But it shows the rockets
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 15:31:29 Idk what I was smoking THAT day
creations-chat 2022-05-04 15:32:38 Man's trying to make the robot in Optimus prime's trailer
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 15:34:19 Dear god
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 15:35:19 Then they became a feature
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 15:35:56 Now I'm able to break the game and make actually good looking planes that aren't 100 times overscale
help 2022-05-04 15:37:13 First you learn how to type in correct English grammar and spelling
help 2022-05-04 15:37:46 Then you use excess amounts of wings and ballast blocks to balance and stabilize the helicopter
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 15:38:29 Bruh
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 15:38:48 What's providing the thrust on the front end üíÄ
creations-chat 2022-05-04 16:13:04 That and shipwright
Only real roles are vtol, robotics, land and air roles
creations-chat 2022-05-04 16:15:47 Shipwright is one of the easiest roles to get
You literally just make a giant floating boat that meets the block requirement up until shipwright V, when you have to actually make it look good
And then you just need a positive 20 ratio

If you want proof of how easy it is to get, look at how many people have shipwright
creations-chat 2022-05-04 16:17:32 If you know what your doing, no
But otherwise yes it's the hardest

creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:41:02 Well then here's some real feedback 

Cockpit is terrible
Nose reminds me of a pencil
Wings are too short
Fuselage does not change shape
Very little design or skill put into detailing
Literally no redeemable qualites of this "jet"
Please delete and watch fireyoblivion tutorials
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:44:15 Literally no hope for this "jet" every part looks terrible and it looks like it's the first thing to get shot down in pvp battles
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:45:58 For comparison this is my pvp jet that I literally only designed for pvp
Still hasn't been shot down and I built it in 1 hour
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:57:22 Poorly done gradient, weird wing design with wing gaps, odd exposed engines minimalist tail front looks like a bird and the speed is pitiful.

Actually wait he's reposted it 4 times
creations-chat 2022-05-05 00:34:45 Yeah but it looks like noobshit
Horrible detail and color scheme
Doesn't even look practical
creations-chat 2022-05-05 00:36:37 Also my mech can do all of those things with like three extra attachments and it probably controls easier *and it's only 30 blocks*

Yes

It has all ranges of motion

It can also walk on water
creations-chat 2022-05-05 00:38:30 Literally add rockets to the arms and it would do that

creations-chat 2022-05-05 00:49:13 Search up Jerry in creations

You can't miss it
creations-chat 2022-05-05 00:51:45 Oh yeah I gave the design to my friends
They must have made a tutorial on it
creations-chat 2022-05-05 00:55:26 Yeah I made Jerry way before I joined PCC
~~originally I designed him to get hit by a really fast spinning stick~~
creations-chat 2022-05-05 13:18:11 Guys a simp for mechs

creations-chat 2022-05-05 16:31:33 Also yeah he's either 13 or 11 tbh the way he talks he's trying to be sneaky about his identity

It's simple; you didn't clearly state your age and your trying to avoid the topic because your afraid of revealing that your a squeaky little boy
creations-chat 2022-05-05 16:33:43 I'm pretty sure he hasn't even hit puberty üíÄ

creations-chat 2022-05-06 12:32:54 Bruh if I showed off my old helicopters I would get downvoted to oblivion
creations-chat 2022-05-06 12:35:22 It's poor quality, wrong design, front is a nightmare, impossible rotor configuration thanks to hover drives, too short, did I say the front is a nightmare because it's giving me nightmares. No sliding door no detail doesn't even look like a pavehawk and the whole thing is just disgusting
AND BLACKHAWK VARIANT ROTORS ARE STRAIGHT FFS
The tail makes me want to vomit the design and quality overall is not deserving of the ratio

*Don't fuck with the helicopter guy*

creations-chat 2022-05-06 13:28:26 The curve needs to be more pronounced
As in, steeper angle downward while smoothing out in the fuselage
creations-chat 2022-05-06 13:30:10 ***I like things that are curvy***

creations-chat 2022-05-07 22:31:53 Black powder is used in gunpowder üíÄ 

Clearly you aren't American or you live in the northeast

<@938196250791141386> the stereotype persists only in the southeast, parts of the Midwest, and California

Everywhere else is poo fard
creations-chat 2022-05-07 22:37:21 I wish it told me what words I couldn't say ffs I'm just doing trial and error at this point
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:03:14 *once again, I'm older than you*
Also California is both north and southwest it's literally most of the coastline
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:04:54 It's called knowing your place whitename, your tank is shid fard and my advice is deleting it and doing any other design
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:12:12 My point still stands the tank is poo fard
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:13:52 I don't see a tank... I see a shitpile<:empty:794431705070174238>

I'm sorry was that supposed to be an insult?
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:26:54 I think we need to do an unde check on this guy he sounds like he's 10 years old or something
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:30:05 Clearly you haven't been here for longer than three seconds so here's a little rundown on how this place works; creations feedback 97% of the time is the place where people insult the mass amount of shitty noob builds (like yours) created by whitenames primarily (people like you without any skill proven by roles). Your lucky people worse than me weren't here because they can actually put effort into they're insults of your poo fard build.

*I hate how I have to explain this because it should be obvious*
creations-chat 2022-05-07 23:31:49 Well ysee I'm a harsh critic

creations-chat 2022-05-08 23:24:20 When will you people realize... Plane crazy 2 WILL NEVER EXIST
It's all a hoax to make us keep playing this game in the hopes that one day, we will have a clipping tool, one day we will have water physics, one day we'll have an infinite map. It's all too good to be true

It's all a trick to boost sales for Roblox sponsored nerf guns
HASBRO IS BEHIND ALL OF THIS
general 2022-05-08 23:26:34 Anyone else waste their money on the boxy buster
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:08:50 *not really it's just a pink blob*
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:13:18 It kinda lacks detail and a good paint job
The back is really weird and is symmetrical on all sides unlike the craft itself, and it doesn't really have any features that stand out or make it interesting
No exterior parts or by the looks of it useful motorlocking
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:15:12 I also doubt the ship is scale or even has an interior
It's just... Bland
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:16:53 Ngl that's when I would be impressed a scale starship would be worth my upvote, even in it's current low detail state
creations-chat 2022-05-09 00:19:13 <@738064035135750224> what exactly makes it steampunk

creations-chat 2022-05-11 22:34:56 Or I could say it's noobshit and you can continue crying about it. I'm not revoking my rating your builds are shid fard
creations-chat 2022-05-11 22:36:41 Clearly you haven't been here very long because rarely is there any actual feedback, and whenever there is, it's not for terrible low effort noob builds, it's for builds that actually can be redeemed

Also get a tri rotor and go monoaxial if your gonna have hover drives running the damn props
Hell the whole rotor is just fucked entirely up and looks like ass
creations-chat 2022-05-12 11:10:30 Just why would make it coaxial when it's already got exterior propulsion of the rotors?!?
Also base design is off and cockpit has more glass
Also wait did this dude put a helium block on top of the already annoyingly oversized coaxial rotors which should have provided enough thrust to begin with to move the damn thing up and be stable-
creations-chat 2022-05-12 11:15:07 Just wtf bro this R-4 is sad a disgrace to Sikorsky
creations-chat 2022-05-12 11:18:12 It's still pretty bad
All the noob builds come in during the beginning of the year and during summer often
creations-chat 2022-05-12 11:22:10 Here's my R-4 I've forgotten about and had in a save file for a solid month
Now I have inspiration to finish it

*Yes I'm going to fix the rotor*
creations-chat 2022-05-12 12:01:32 Bruh look at the scale of the real R-4 mini for it would be 1 block wide
I said that it's not even mini being 2 blocks wide dumbass
creations-chat 2022-05-12 12:31:14 It's been sitting there in the save file FOR a month I haven't been working on it for a month bro can you read?

creations-chat 2022-05-12 12:33:06 Yeah I'd downvote intakes look like poo fard nose is weird wings are too short and overall design is mega cringe

<@588596347272167456> what's your point bro you have a build you haven't finished yet for longer than me
If anything that's a bad thing
creations-chat 2022-05-12 12:35:09 Yeah but I wasn't saying it was long ago I was saying that I haven't worked on it for a month as in that is the exact amount of time it has been what point are you trying to argue here
creations-chat 2022-05-12 12:36:57 Ok and? I still don't see your point here

plane-crazy 2022-05-12 23:57:57 Bruh I'm starting to think plane crazy 2 is just gonna be a fever dream at this point
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 23:58:59 All these promises of better features and suggestions for fixed crap is just too good to be true, especially for a whopping 1 developer to do within a reasonable amount of time
plane-crazy 2022-05-12 23:59:23 It's been like a year since he announced it's development right?
plane-crazy 2022-05-13 00:01:09 Two years?
plane-crazy 2022-05-13 00:01:54 I'm just starting to think plane crazy 2 will never happen, because by the time it's released all the people who cared about it would have left at that point
creations-chat 2022-05-13 00:02:35 That or high effort builds in general
Or something that actually looks good or realistic

creations-chat 2022-05-13 13:04:30 And then dropped a brick on it
creations-chat 2022-05-13 13:06:45 Aight
First off 
Delete the save file
Use a reference picture make it much smaller actually follow the reference picture especially on the wing sizes and use motorlock and angle locking to conceal ugly motors that are currently being used to angle the wings, then it should be somewhat good
plane-crazy 2022-05-13 13:14:13 Oh boy
plane-crazy 2022-05-13 13:14:18 This should be good
plane-crazy 2022-05-13 13:14:59 Trolled too hard

creations-chat 2022-05-13 16:47:28 Yeah so posting a low effort version could only get recieved better
creations-chat 2022-05-13 17:33:10 I'm not against LGBTQ I just think the organization and their actions as a whole have been stupid
Like wtf now when I see a rainbow its always tied to being gay and whatnot
And there's like 30 different flags like bro I didn't know being gay made you a country 
Hell my gay trans friend doesn't even know why there's flags

Thank you for coming to my ted talk
creations-chat 2022-05-13 17:34:52 No dude it's because your build is bad and you clearly don't know what a screenshot is

creations-chat 2022-05-13 23:27:08 "Made for pvp" is just an excuse for something to be shitty and low effort
Bruh im just pointing it out literally every plane that says made for pvp is garbage

creations-chat 2022-05-13 23:32:52 No rules are the best rules
However that means there's no rule stopping me from making rules 
Neither does that mean any rules apply including those of gravity and of the universe
No rules also means that there can always be rules seeing as time and space obey rules
No rules = all rules

Meaning that I should make racism the lawüòé

creations-chat 2022-05-14 15:36:27 Well your higher up than a whitename but still lower than an expert
So your slightly less prone to get bullied
creations-chat 2022-05-14 15:38:50 Pretty bland
Detail is where the gold is at

Even off the production line it had depth
creations-chat 2022-05-14 15:41:01 Very generic and low quality too it literally looks like a drawing
Needs depth
Also better tracks
creations-chat 2022-05-14 15:42:42 Frontal plate is slightly longer no machine guns at all literally blocky and basic

***It needs detail***
Also the back of the turret is wrong there shouldnt be a gap there
creations-chat 2022-05-14 15:47:09 This bs right here

Using lazy grammar and poor spelling, shortened slang words like "u" and b4, and other lazy ways of typing

creations-chat 2022-05-16 10:57:39 Looks like a banana that was painted red and used a cheese grater as wings
I suggest you go for a different design entirely
creations-chat 2022-05-16 11:08:54 <@743080739972710492> pretty ok stallion but it lacks finer detail and engines the 5 rotors section is very clunky and I doubt it's stable mid-air if you use the blades to increase height, the paint is very bright and too revealing of how little detail or effort put into the actual design
Also the landing gear is poo fard the cockpit and there should be 7 rotors
creations-chat 2022-05-16 11:11:44 Bruh wtf are you talking about he didn't even add the engine

creations-chat 2022-05-19 13:34:05 Ysee it's something called physics
Ya need some sort of countertorque otherwise the craft will go in the direction the rotor is spinning
So either make it coaxial with another rotor going the opposite direction or stick rockets on it to propel the rotor instead of a normal motor
I suggest watching fireyoblivion's helicopter basics tutorials
creations-chat 2022-05-19 13:37:11 Bruh I just said that
creations-chat 2022-05-19 13:39:09 Nononono
For one that pulls the craft in the direction of the conveyor drive WHILE rotating the rotor making it uncontrollable
Another is that it's an eyesore and it's really clunky and big on the rotor
creations-chat 2022-05-19 13:41:16 Bruh you got two of the rockets spinning in the wrong direction

creations-chat 2022-05-19 16:42:19 Bruh everyone knows that when you say "based off of" it literally just means you failed to recreate what your "custom" plane is based on

Im pretty sure with a combination of delta wings and conveyor drives you can make a plane go as fast as you would like it
also wtf why do you need 7 alt accounts for fucking roblox

any thoughts?
well im going to make it six rotors so its just a stand-in
creations-chat 2022-05-29 00:31:13 *well duh its missing a tail and any function of a helicopter*
well in order to make it have six rotors it has to have motorlock on the rotor itself so i put that there as a stand in so i could effectively motorlock around the rotating shaft
creations-chat 2022-05-29 00:33:33 the rotor will be complete tommorrow

creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:32:24 Like bruh use a guided cluster missile or a jet with the invisibility glitch on or hell even a tnt shotgun would work

creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:41:34 Introducing my anti shredder flak gun
Essentially it has a shit ton of magnets and tnt clustered together and it fills up the sky as well as lags the whole game, and anything caught in it's blast is destroyed
*Only used for minor amounts of trolling*
I'm away from the computer but in exactly 8 hours I'll have more pictures <@578603895736238100>
Essentially it's just a lot of motorlocked tnt
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:43:42 I added a barrel to it but other than that it's the same
It uses all 150 blocks
And 300 ish trails 2 on each tnt
It was intended to crash the game but it works against shredders too
True<:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-06-02 01:45:46 I don't have any images of it firing sadly but I have a new concept where I put headless pistons on it

Hasn't been fully tested but I know for a fact it will crash my game
*Your right*
Found out that exploding headless pistons can end up really fucking the game so attaching them to explosives and then firing is super lethal
the-dump 2022-06-02 01:48:45 So real!

creations-chat 2022-06-05 13:41:18 Ffs we need to prevent whitenames from posting

creations-chat 2022-06-05 20:19:03 We need active moderators here to fix this crap
Rbk only bothers to look at this channel because he knows it's free modlogs
98% of the time it's arguments centered around low effort builds and whitenames being stupid
creations-chat 2022-06-05 20:21:27 Standards are shifting too because of it
People are just upvoting sub par shit now
creations-chat 2022-06-05 20:23:30 Like this bruh this tank is terrible but it has a positive ratio

It's also showing that the game has a lazy and short term fanbase seeing as giving low effort into builds seems to be working
the-dump 2022-06-05 20:29:19 It's the thing that got defeated by a fellow construction vehicle

creations-chat 2022-06-05 20:31:19 Yeah but I think there are ways to solve the low effort shit, and I think we do it already naturally by insulting and bullying sort of those who are the low effort failures
Essentially it makes them want to prove us wrong and they get better and build better
Maybe there should be a separate channel for people with ranks
creations-chat 2022-06-05 20:41:38 Yeah suggest that

creations-chat 2022-06-23 20:26:52 Bushnoises states in 3rd person referring to how he has been forgotten in this world of digital sandbox games. Realizing his insignificance he looks out from his window. His apartment is so small, yet high enough to see the tops of all the trees in the park. He thought to himself, the scary thought of jumping. Like a cancer the idea spread throughout him. Without him realizing he got up and opened the window, and stared down to the ground, impossibly high suddenly. He stares, pondering his fate. He backs away as he stares at the dead screen. Forgotten in the world, but maybe not here. He closes the window, the computer, and exits the door of his room for the first time in months. Countless stacks of GrubHub boxes border his line to the door. He opens, and finally, feels the sunlight for the first time in months. He stands, waiting for the next command.

creations-chat 2022-06-24 03:33:02 Yeah they do make the image 10 times better but in principle it's free upvotes
creations-chat 2022-06-24 03:35:31 Yeah so it's not fair to people without
But on the other hand it's free upvotes so I'm gonna use it on my mid builds to get them ratio
creations-chat 2022-06-24 03:38:11 Gonna make a blackhawk soon that will go well with that image

help 2022-06-26 00:17:42 Anyone know how to make a decepticon symbol small enough for a wing
help 2022-06-26 00:17:51 With like signs n shit
help 2022-06-26 01:44:41 Whar?
creations-chat 2022-06-26 15:16:04 Yup
All of the harsh critics have left the server or got banned so now low effort SHID is leaking into creations at an alarming rate
creations-chat 2022-06-26 15:20:11 <@595204611434872832> is that supposed to be a plane
creations-chat 2022-06-26 15:23:13 Yeah that's the problem
Without constant backlash for low effort shit builds and harsh self esteem lowering critics standards lower to the point where any random garbage can be posted and nobody ever gets better
You need to adapt to survive and eventually thrive, and without predators things stay the same forever.
creations-chat 2022-06-26 15:25:17 The video isn't, the weird half structure kinda is
Literally just looks like a cobbling of random blocks
We're a dying breed... Good plane crazy players üíÄ

creations-chat 2022-06-26 19:37:18 <@750047439435727000> looks more like a dumpster than a multirole anti tank airdoppable guided missile launcher
The turret is mega cursed too bruh it looks like warpath from transformers G-1

creations-chat 2022-06-26 19:49:15 Yeah and it's because of the lack of harsh critics and criticism that standards have gotten so low and <#384025409945337856> has gone to hell
creations-chat 2022-06-26 19:51:17 The lack thereof has resulted in the creations you see before you.
Just doing my job as hars's replacement <@401409588026408960>
creations-chat 2022-06-26 19:53:19 Hars 2 electric boogaloo
