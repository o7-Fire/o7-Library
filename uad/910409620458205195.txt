creations-chat 2022-11-21 13:38:09 why not just piston lock a pyramid wedge
the-dump 2022-12-13 03:05:20 i dont get it
the-dump 2022-12-13 03:06:41 what
the-dump 2022-12-13 03:07:02 is the joke too dark?
the-dump 2022-12-13 03:07:41 i take that as a yes
creations-chat 2022-12-14 01:55:52 what f-16 is that
creations-chat 2022-12-14 01:58:55 is that exposed motors to the left
creations-chat 2022-12-14 02:25:10 using google lens i found out its a f-16xf
creations-chat 2022-12-14 02:32:25 how did you do this with the main wings
from what i see you used a 1x4 wedge for nose
so if you motorlocked the wings, the wings will be at the same level as the 1x4 wedge.
creations-chat 2022-12-14 02:37:00 you clearly dont get what i mean
creations-chat 2022-12-14 02:41:14 so your main wings are at half of half blocks
do you use piston lock?
creations-chat 2022-12-14 02:46:18 how come the half cylinder wedge out or whatever isn't a full 1x1 in the picture
creations-chat 2022-12-18 16:42:40 how tf did you managed to make the intake 1.5x1
creations-chat 2022-12-18 21:01:39 motorlock tower on top of motor 2?
creations-chat 2022-12-18 21:10:20 you could do something like this to avoid exposed motors
creations-chat 2022-12-18 21:12:23 how about motorlocking but without the motor
creations-chat 2022-12-18 21:19:53 https://streamable.com/uhe2il never seen anyone does it, you could place the motor 2 attached to the cam if you want <@627546746792443904>
creations-chat 2022-12-18 21:24:44 uhh more goofy with cam ig
creations-chat 2022-12-18 21:26:52 cam locking keeps me sane but whatever you prefer ig
creations-chat 2022-12-20 20:09:52 how tf do i do the wing strips at the nose, i have a brain and show me how
