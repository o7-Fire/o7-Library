plane-crazy 2022-03-09 04:28:59 fun fact: 1 stud equals to 0.28 meters, so if you were going 1 stud per second it would (obviously) equal to 0.28 meters a second. Multiply that by 100 (sps) and you get 28 meters a second, equalling to about 62.634 mph, considering that 100 kph is 62 mph you get a pretty nice result, kph is *close* to sps unless you count in the quadruple digits.

so basically, kph is a good measurement for ground vehicles or any slow moving aircraft in plane crazy

plane-crazy 2023-01-07 05:18:05 that happened, right?

creations-chat 2023-07-16 18:47:15 it hasnt been updated in a year, sadly. Even the most upvoted builds of this year didnt get into hof

creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:31:22 don't try & meet peoples expectations here, they'll just raise their expectations even more to spite you. Just try & scrape the bottom of the barrel for actual constructive criticism. If you can't find constructive criticism on Discord head to reddit (ðŸ¤®) they usually have less ego hoggers there.
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:34:04 im stupid by default
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:37:51 I mean in my opinion *most* of their complaints are valid, some of their arguments suck but at least its better than getting yelled at for existing wrongly here. It's why I almost never speak here & just steal other peoples memes in <#495286269459300364>

creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:49:41 speaking of quality, do you think it's possible to reduce the size of this thing I built while still retaining its core features? https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1130193129035804692
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:53:52 alright, my only gripe with this system is that the autoloaders use a conveyor system, which tears a hole in the fabric of space when used sometimes
creations-chat 2023-07-16 22:57:41 real
creations-chat 2023-07-16 23:00:32 I'm planing to remove the cosmetic turret, as that just creates clutter for me, do you think that'd be a worthwhile investment?
creations-chat 2023-07-16 23:11:39 Can disconnectors can be turned into ice? I forgot
aw, I'll attempt to use the trapdoors then.
