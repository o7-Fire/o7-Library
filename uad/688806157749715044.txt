general 2021-12-05 15:44:33 ya like does a drone count, cuz it stands for vertical takeoff and landing
creations-chat 2021-12-05 17:10:45 sorry im not too familiar with war ships and stuff
general 2021-12-05 18:12:11 idk what to do cuz i can make builds that work (sometimes) but cantn design for crap
general 2021-12-05 18:21:57 so i have two versions of a jet, a realistic one and a recolored one with weapons. which one do i post in <#384025409945337856>?
general 2021-12-05 18:22:18 like in separate posts?
general 2021-12-05 18:22:29 lol

creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:02:27 bro i suck at plane crazy. every time i make a build, its functional but looks like crap. how do i not be bad at plane crazy?
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:04:45 maybe i just suck at the game lol idk
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:21:22 lol every single build i have posted to <#384025409945337856> has gotten ***n e g a t i v e   p o i n t s***
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:23:44 i guess the reason why all my builds get negative points is because i joined the server this weekend and havent learned what kind of builds yall like

creations-chat 2022-02-27 04:12:44 there engines are under the wings. They're hard to see since they're the same color as the body
creations-chat 2022-02-27 04:27:01 tbh idk much about planes whats a fuselage?
creations-chat 2022-02-27 04:30:17 well they're not so much stuck to the fuselage as they are stuck to the wings, very close to the fuselage
creations-chat 2022-02-27 04:32:33 one block away from fuselage.
creations-chat 2022-02-27 04:39:44 looks great! thanks!

plane-crazy 2022-03-01 22:15:31 :/
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 22:16:02 i did hover engines on propellor to avoid the blue exhaust from rocket engines
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 22:16:17 but
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 22:16:21 i cant control it

plane-crazy 2022-03-01 22:17:05 wait but
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 22:17:19 dont you need to calibrate the functions to the prop?
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 22:18:53 like,
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 22:19:11 the heli always rollos over in the direction the blades are spinning
plane-crazy 2022-03-01 22:19:18 so what do i do <@!883063424614006878>
general 2023-02-16 06:17:02 can someone help me with something
so im making a submarine and im wondering
what water propeller has the most speed relative to the space it takes up?
general 2023-02-16 18:18:03 yall ever get like super obsessed with something for like a few weeks
then you move onto another thing
general 2023-02-16 18:18:19 ok

general 2023-02-16 18:18:56 just in a dif font
general 2023-02-16 19:07:16 yall know how to fix a folding submarine?
every time i fold it it never stays together

help 2023-02-16 23:37:42 which of these planes should i try and make?
help 2023-02-17 00:43:59 sorry u were too late i already started work on the first one
help 2023-02-17 00:44:20 i might make the second one later on
help 2023-02-17 00:44:42 i like the first two because they have itneresting tails instead of the basic three pointed model
help 2023-02-18 05:40:44 anybody know how to fix this plane?
its very wobbly and when i try to do turns it slows down and is overall janky
someones it keeps rolling to one side even after a let go of the button too

it has 3 small hover drives powering it (the propeller doesnt do anything)
help 2023-02-21 03:53:25 do yall know how to make a tandem rotor heli stop spinning?
help 2023-02-21 03:53:42 it has fake rotors but still spins when it goes upwards
help 2023-02-21 03:53:52 i havent finished the controls yet but i've noticed this on test runs
help 2023-02-21 22:12:40 no
help 2023-02-21 22:12:53 like a real tendem rotor they spin in opposite directions
help 2023-02-21 22:16:34 it looks kinda bad but this shows how it spins
(ik i didnt fly up but it still showcases how the rotors cause it to spin drastically)
help 2023-02-21 22:25:04 i tried reversing the rotors but it only helped slightly
help 2023-02-21 22:25:18 (making them move the same direction
help 2023-02-21 22:38:20 yes
help 2023-02-21 22:50:02 what should i do to fix it?
general 2023-02-22 01:27:46 how to people manage to make helicopters üò≠üò≠
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 01:54:55 can someone help me get a heli to work?
i cant figure out how to control it smoothly and it always spins to the right.
(its a fake rotor heli and its a tandem rotor model)
help 2023-02-22 23:28:20 aye could anyone help me with a heli
general 2023-02-22 23:51:31 is there a block in the game that like balances your plane
general 2023-02-22 23:52:05 zamn <:sad:894024185335140402>
general 2023-02-22 23:52:14 im tryna balance my heli but its hard asf
general 2023-02-22 23:52:53 ye but like
when it goes up its balanced
then when it goes now it almost flips
general 2023-02-22 23:53:17 ri did üò≠
general 2023-02-22 23:53:23 i used tons of ballast blocks
creations-chat 2023-02-22 23:59:29 how do i get the arrows to appear on my thing
general 2023-02-23 00:00:30 how do you get arrows to appear on your thing in <#384025409945337856>
general 2023-02-23 00:01:02 üíÄ
general 2023-02-23 01:09:54 do you guys know how to make a heli stop spinning?
general 2023-02-23 01:13:16 its a tandem rotor doe
general 2023-02-23 01:13:31 but how do i make it where they are always on?
general 2023-02-23 01:14:58 like so i make one propeller slower than the other?
(its the kind of heli with two propellers)
general 2023-02-23 01:15:22 no
general 2023-02-23 01:15:25 tandem rotor
general 2023-02-23 01:15:36 (fake rotors btw)
general 2023-02-23 01:16:25 never gave a go at a tandem rotor heli (let alone a real heli) so figured fake would be easiest
general 2023-02-23 01:16:42 now im kinda too far in to change it
general 2023-02-23 01:17:52 ye i already tried checking out like what direction hey spin n stuff
general 2023-02-23 01:19:48 the part in the center is just unpowered mtoors and there are blades attached with hover engines on them
general 2023-02-23 01:19:58 therefore causing the blades to spin
general 2023-02-23 01:20:25 the blades are made of wing panels and i guess them spinning causes the heli to spin
general 2023-02-23 01:20:39 idk i thought it would be easier
general 2023-02-23 01:21:12 i tried articulating rotors and i found they always messed up
general 2023-02-23 01:21:31 if i fly up or whatever i spin
general 2023-02-23 01:22:19 so should i turn them into articulating rotors?
general 2023-02-23 01:22:26 or what kind of rotor should i go with
general 2023-02-23 01:23:19 idk what to do since ive never worked with a heli before
general 2023-02-23 01:24:26 idk im goin off a fireyoblivion video
basically he made what he called "articulating rotors" that had motors at the base of the blades so he could adjust the angle on the fly
general 2023-02-23 01:26:06 alr
general 2023-02-23 01:26:11 so what rotor should i use
general 2023-02-23 01:26:34 tandem rotor
general 2023-02-23 01:29:34 i guess mostly showcasing
but i still want it to fly and be pretty manuverable
general 2023-02-23 01:30:05 i might make an alt version for pvp
thought it would be more like a bombing thing rather than gunner
general 2023-02-23 01:31:03 so like signs?
general 2023-02-23 01:31:27 what kinda rotor u got?
general 2023-02-23 01:32:11 alr
general 2023-02-23 01:32:29 should i use motor 2s since they can have a set angle?
and then set them to toggle so they stay at that angle
general 2023-02-23 01:33:23 also idk if this is bad or not but since i was trying to keep it manuverable i kinda did this thing where its got the perfect ammound of helium to where it floats like theres no gravity
so i can manuver it around perfectly
general 2023-02-23 01:33:32 at first i was just trying to get rid of it spinning
general 2023-02-23 01:34:27 alr
general 2023-02-23 01:34:33 but with that in mind what should i do
general 2023-02-23 01:34:39 since i already have lift from rockets
general 2023-02-23 01:35:41 basically as of right now, the blade are basically just for show and its really controlled by rockets and healium n stuff
general 2023-02-23 02:03:06 is there anything that acts as a good substitute for wings (like signs) but is properly aligned with the wings?
signs are placed againt a wall but wings r in the middle
general 2023-02-23 06:40:56 hey i forgot what are all the different blocks you can use for a hover engine?
