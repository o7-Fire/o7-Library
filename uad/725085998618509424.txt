plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:04:37 why does hover drive break motor2
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:04:41 it wont sit still anymore
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:05:37 time to learn conveyor engine ig
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:06:43 do you guys use servos for your control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:07:01 if so how do you use propellors or wing surfaces to get the desired effect
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:07:28 you mount control surfaces on top of servos?
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:07:33 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:07:37 m2 set to servo
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:08:22 please confirm

plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:17:45 so i have to ask these questions
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:17:56 so uh what does this game simulate
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:18:00 its a reasonable question
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:18:10 ok what if you sealed those up
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:18:14 would it affect ingame flight performance
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:18:15 y/n
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:18:21 ingame?
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:18:28 ok that was all i was asking

plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:20:53 no idea how it performs in combat
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:22:10 no idea whats going on there
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:22:18 but id like to know how you get an idea
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:22:23 so i can get an idea
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:22:43 physics 1 in america ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:23:13 add swept wing too
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:24:17 true
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:24:25 add optional forward sweep too
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:24:41 im not an expert on anything
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:24:46 i just got here
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:24:53 damn..

plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:58:41 is there a copy paste feature
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:58:50 i want to copy paste my conveyor engines
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 20:58:54 theyre tedious
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 22:24:43 it has multiple parts üò¢
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 01:22:58 i want to build a ufo
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 01:24:45 whats the setup
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 01:24:54 do you mean controls and other configurations
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 01:25:25 idk what motor or anglelock is
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 01:25:32 is that what it is when people load into flight mode
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 01:25:36 and their plane collapses into shaope
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 01:25:51 why would anyone do that
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 01:26:26 oh
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 01:26:34 its for getting the cool shape for the jets
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 01:27:04 sounds tedious for a game but feels great at the end
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 01:28:58 troll
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:36:57 im trying to figure out how to do a shredder
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:37:04 except im not gonna put cutters on it
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 02:37:16 shredder bug*
general 2022-06-13 03:00:01 i saw that one gif of a shredder tearing a long ass rp plane to pieces
general 2022-06-13 03:00:05 and now i wanna build one
general 2022-06-13 03:00:14 funniest shit ive seen all day

plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:09:49 https://tenor.com/view/plane-crazy-shredder-gif-24221292
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:09:49 shredders are so funny lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:11:04 how do shredders even exist
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:11:11 the mechanics that enable this have to be deliberate
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:11:28 im almost in tears haaaahahahahaha
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:13:03 
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:13:40 ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:13:43 i wonder
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:14:04 im gonna try building my own bug tomorrow
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:14:11 since idk how to do quadcopters
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:14:20 im not infected
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:14:27 i just want to be able to use the camera to fly
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:14:37 you cant complain
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:15:04 saw someone fly around at like 3000 sps with this giant thing with lots of arms coming off it
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:15:07 with hover drives
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:15:15 and a center that was spinning in like 2 directions at once
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:15:19 like a gyroscope
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:15:34 that isnt my pic i found it
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:15:41 while i was doing research on shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:16:30 i mean the games premise is great why would anyone kill it with a glitch machine
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:16:34 on purpose
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:16:50 getting killed by a shredder should auto ban u
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:17:07 ive never placed a cutter in my life
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:17:30 when are we gonna get sensors in this game
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:17:42 i want a motor 3 that tracks the nearest player
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:17:57 why not
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:18:09 yeah thats the point
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:18:15 it would also be great for countering shredders
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:18:31 it will also make shredders even better
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:18:33 lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:18:48 since they can just put their arms on the motor 3
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:19:01 and suddenly they have even more clearance as they tear you apart
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:19:07 meaning they can move onto the next victim faster
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:19:13 https://tenor.com/view/plane-crazy-shredder-gif-24221292
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:19:30 shredders are so stupid
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:19:34 im glad i found out about them
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:19:36 <:clueless:942802644043464734>

plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:20:29 how
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:20:37 jet controls are so annoying
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:20:49 i agree but how do you even pull it off
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:20:58 wasd
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:21:03 you mean using servos
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:21:19 e and s?
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:21:22 what
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:21:29 oh

plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:22:12 also imagine having an air fryer that opens and closes
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:22:29 and it actually has cutters mounted on a retractable spinning plate
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:22:39 it comes down and pulverises whatevers inside
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:23:06 i mean yeah
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:23:12 the point is that its a cool premise
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:23:17 also very trolly
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:24:17 <@722156712714305967>

plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:26:00 troll
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:26:15 wait can you motor lock the components for shredder-like flight
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:26:42 lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:26:50 yeah bc it just spins at 800 rpm
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:27:04 and turns your irl-accurate tiger II into rubble
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:27:15 an anchored block start unanchored
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:27:24 ive been wondering too
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:27:30 but i just assumed you couldnt
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:27:33 kinda dumb lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:27:47 airbrake probs

plane-crazy 2022-06-13 03:30:06 cya
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 19:16:01 how do you get shredder bug like movement without building one
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 19:16:41 is that seriously the only way
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 19:16:59 i like how you kinda just float in midair then move where you want at high speed
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 19:17:06 at the click of a button
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 19:17:09 ufo style
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 19:17:20 hm what if i built a shredder bug then put it in a box
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 19:17:25 hmmm
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 19:17:29 let me try that actually
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 19:17:41 helium eh
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 19:17:44 that could work too
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 19:18:50 ok what archetype does that movmeent fall into then
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 19:18:55 shredder bug like movement
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 19:19:02 is it just a bug
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 19:19:18 vtol

plane-crazy 2022-06-13 20:19:25 figured it out
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 20:19:29 (used the wiki)
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 20:19:51 (i hate fandom it should be sold to google or something)
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 20:20:01 (bloated ass site & way too many ads)
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 20:37:04 whats the most stable airborne platform i can have
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 20:37:12 for mounting a gun midair
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:50:27 im messing around with missiles rn
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:50:41 missiles go hard
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:50:56 i want to have multiple missiles which i can fire whenever i want
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:51:51 do delta wings have any benefit at all
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:51:56 interms of ingame mechanics
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:52:08 like drag reduction or high speed performance
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:53:41 hm
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:53:53 i wonder if pc2 will be really enjoyable for all the dudes in pc1
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:54:03 or absolutely horrible for them
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:54:14 so all i need to care about is gravity?
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:54:20 aerodynamic drag is irrelevant?

plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:56:15 do you mean when the 2 sides of the motor fall apart
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:56:22 and suddenly the other side is hovering around
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:56:38 trying to come together
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:58:10 ahaahhaha
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:58:20 confused
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:58:36 how does motor bend 2 objects
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:58:41 are u saying it can bend welded objects
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:58:49 ok that makes sense
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:58:53 any more info
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 00:00:49 so water works like glitter which means if youre in 1cm of water its like youre submerged
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 00:01:01 helium block means its entire weight flies upwards
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 00:01:04 ?

plane-crazy 2022-06-14 00:43:45 how do i get to the 1000 fps range with a plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 00:43:51 sps*
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 00:44:24 i used like 4 hover drives in series
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 00:44:31 whats next
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 00:52:07 ok i added more hovers
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 00:52:14 i got to 970 sps (close enough)
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 00:52:18 but now im super unstable
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 00:52:19 what do
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 00:52:56 the red line is where the hovers are
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 00:53:00 there are 2 layers of them
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:00:49 now its even more unstable
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:00:53 hes joking
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:01:15 normal irl way to deal with unstable aircraft is fly by wire
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:03:50 no thats you
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:03:55 it clearly says "my honest reaction"
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:04:02 "my" in this context is you
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:07:08 its even more unstable
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:29:02 2nd plane and going 1000 sps makes it unstable
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:29:11 tbf i dont ahve a rudder but it shouldnt be this unstable
plane-crazy 2022-06-14 01:31:35 rudder added but still unstable
