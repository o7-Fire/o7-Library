general 2020-07-05 21:35:33 My dad bought a giant pack of "July 4th Poppers" thinking they were fireworks. Turned out you just pulled a string and an bunch of confetti launched out. Our real fireworks were too old or something, and just fizzled out when lit.

plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:26:28 if it still glitches it's a motor problem
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:26:36 if not it's a panel problem
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 21:27:24 panels aren't touching other parts they're not supposed to?

plane-crazy 2023-04-02 15:07:26 yesterday i met a guy with a flying sword that absolutely destroyed my tank
their cutters were penetrating through my motorlock armor straight to the center of the tank, taking apart the motorlock or killing the avatar
they weren't using blacklist, so im confused as to how they did this
anyone here know?
plane-crazy 2023-04-02 15:21:14 they consistently went straight through 5 blocks of x3 motorlocked armor

plane-crazy 2023-05-04 00:26:39 im trying to make a vtol heli type thing that is able to point towards mouse at any pitch while keeping rotors vertical
