general 2020-04-16 14:42:47 and sometimes my plane armed with cutters passes through other creations like I'm a ghost and ends up completely obliterating them because the cutters made contact with ALL of the blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 14:55:15 does anybody know how to control a motorized missile with their mouse?
plane-crazy 2020-04-17 14:56:09 May you educate me on how that is...?
general 2020-04-17 15:00:56 I have a question, how can something such as a turret be controlled with a mouse? I saw a guy do it the other day but his was flinging around so I made my bet that it involved some tricky mechanics.
general 2020-04-17 15:01:59 is that it?
general 2020-04-17 15:02:30 Thank you. I'm gonna start experimenting
general 2020-04-17 16:34:29 bruh whenever I shoot someone with rockets they partially explode and they freeze in the air. BUT ON THEIR SCREEN THEY CAN move, SHOOT AND STILL KILL ME. Its like dealing with an invisible opponent
general 2020-04-17 16:34:58 its happened four freaking times today
general 2020-04-17 16:35:25 exactllyyy I HATE THAT

creations-chat 2020-04-18 01:25:11 ADFX-01 Morgan top view
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:38:28 Opinion: Dogfighting Rockets
- Lesser explosion radius than normal rockets
- Can only be used at speeds of 200 or greater
- Homing
- Only locks onto airborne targets
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:39:26 Encourages people to stop cheesing with tutorial planes decked with guns and rockets and start building things capable of flying at high speeds
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:40:57 But the pro with a 300 part plane and keyboard controls will smother it anyway cuz even a single rocket can blow them apart
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:42:03 Honestly this idea is better than having to manually aim at some kid with a small plane who has like 9 guns on the front
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:42:28 Looks like a lizard
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:43:23 Continuing with the air-to-air missile suggestion
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:43:58 Adding a motor 2 to control rocket angles with your mouse lags any plane with 300+ parts
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:44:26 Great for ground combat but it doesnt look all too well with aircraft, except helicopters
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:46:32 Even if the cheeser adds a super thruster,
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 16:46:46 The missile will one shot the plane

creations-chat 2020-04-19 02:41:26 the funny thing is, my Morgan goes so fast it actually is immune to rocket blows from behind
creations-chat 2020-04-19 02:42:13 Its accurate to Ace Combat, where you have to shoot the plane in the front to destroy its ECM jammers because thats its only weakness
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 16:26:41 I love joining PVP servers with unskilled ground warriors who instantly get obliterated by a kid with a plane that has a turret on top. It really says something about laziness.

plane-crazy 2020-04-21 21:44:34 if only roblox had a better engine that allowed powerful pcs to harness their potential
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 14:53:39 :c I can't seem to get how to make my ADFX-01 mouse controlled with motor 2s and control surfaces. It keeps going haywire because the wings that use motor 2s are at the front
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 14:54:26 ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 14:54:56 cuz currently my ADFX-01 is keyboard controlled
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 14:58:05 see, my problem is that I have a top turret on my plane that allows me to snipe targets with my mouse but its laggy. and if i remove it and use my plane to target instead, my aim sucks because Im bad at keyboard controls.
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 14:58:43 wot
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 14:58:47 ^
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 14:59:33 I guy showed me his plane that could turn like a keyboard controlled jet, but it was mouse controlled.
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 14:59:38 barrel rolls and everything/
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 15:00:03 he said he had motor 2s and control surfaces.
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 15:00:13 No, I looked at his wings
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 15:00:18 they were for sure controlled by motor 2
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 15:00:49 ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-26 15:01:46 WAIT IT WORKS
WTF
general 2020-04-27 18:45:47 ^^^^
general 2020-04-27 18:45:59 discord is being slow tho
general 2020-05-03 21:06:11 1. add more
2. replace certain blocks with wing panels
general 2020-05-03 21:06:21 3. This is kinda tedious but
general 2020-05-03 21:06:27 replace some blocks
general 2020-05-03 21:06:43 with ballast blocks with the density set to lighter than the actual block itself
general 2020-05-03 21:07:19 when you open up the build menu, there should be a ballast block category somewhere.
general 2020-05-03 21:07:37 and on the very far right when you select the ballast block, theres a wrench symbol
general 2020-05-03 21:07:57 click the wrench symbol to set the settings for every ballast block you place
general 2020-05-03 21:09:24 the density is on .28 by default
general 2020-05-03 21:09:29 the lowest is .15
general 2020-05-03 21:09:49 you can make your builds rlly light if you chose to go through that
general 2020-05-03 21:10:14 the helium blocks are the things lifting your build. Im just saying the bllast blocks can replace normal blocks.
general 2020-05-03 21:10:41 imagine a full wood block vs a hollow wood block
general 2020-05-03 21:11:00 then place a ballast block near the back and set its density to a higher amount.
general 2020-05-03 21:11:07 2, 3, etc
general 2020-05-03 21:11:10 experiment
general 2020-05-03 21:11:19 its really just trial and error with that stuff
general 2020-05-09 00:54:56 does everyone here know that if you have fios you can get 500 robux
general 2020-05-09 00:55:27 u can just go to their site and go to promo offers
general 2020-05-15 13:53:28 the latest android (Samsung) is 1400 for base s20 ultra
general 2020-05-15 13:53:39 iphone 11 pro max is like 1100 base or somethin idk
general 2020-05-15 13:54:12 whoever thinks android cameras suck are just looking at them old trashy androids that have aged like 5 years
general 2020-05-15 13:55:05 all the latest gen androids released this year have 48MP or better cameras
general 2020-05-15 13:55:14 and better light handling
