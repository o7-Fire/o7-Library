general 2020-06-04 05:11:26 it involves a camera
general 2020-06-04 05:12:18 and a motor
general 2020-06-04 05:12:33 i'll send a video
general 2020-06-04 05:13:38 i'll compress it
general 2020-06-04 05:13:42 this is a crazy bug
general 2020-06-04 05:16:46 
general 2020-06-04 05:17:23 correctamundo
general 2020-06-04 05:17:27 i was making a turret
general 2020-06-04 05:17:36 all the guns are pointing at me
general 2020-06-04 05:17:40 which is very menacing
bug-reports 2020-06-04 05:18:23 I was making a vertically mounted turret with motor 2s and this happens with the camera
general 2020-06-04 05:18:46 i can play around with this now
general 2020-06-04 05:19:14 lets see if it can make wings diagonal
general 2020-06-04 05:19:46 OH MY
bug-reports 2020-06-04 05:21:47 UPDATE: Also interesting things happen with planes
bug-reports 2020-06-04 05:22:00 original plane
bug-reports 2020-06-04 05:22:03 camera closeup
bug-reports 2020-06-04 05:22:09 spawning plane in

general 2020-06-04 05:34:20 noice
general 2020-06-04 05:34:23 this bug is fun
general 2020-06-04 05:34:31 this means
general 2020-06-04 05:34:35 wait
general 2020-06-04 05:47:16 <@!403158774732292097> how is it not a bug
general 2020-06-04 05:56:16 yes the camera
general 2020-06-04 05:56:19 but it controls my seat
general 2020-06-04 05:56:27 literally
general 2020-06-04 05:59:14 "not a bug"
general 2020-06-04 05:59:22 cameras aren't supposed to do that
general 2020-06-04 05:59:30 kman
general 2020-06-04 05:59:47 make my plane all bendy
general 2020-06-04 05:59:54 original plane
general 2020-06-04 06:00:03 the camera is there
general 2020-06-04 06:00:09 
general 2020-06-04 06:00:16 no motors
general 2020-06-04 06:00:37 sure
general 2020-06-04 06:00:46 i'll test one feature of this
general 2020-06-04 06:02:00 
general 2020-06-04 06:03:56 if the cameras are meant to look at an object
general 2020-06-04 06:04:08 they've done that
general 2020-06-04 06:04:13 but if they do something like this
general 2020-06-04 06:04:18 
general 2020-06-04 06:04:35 cameras technically link objects
general 2020-06-04 06:05:49 i guess it's an unintended feature
general 2020-06-04 06:06:06 a very useful one

plane-crazy 2020-06-04 06:57:02 nothing is holding the sign up
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 06:57:11 and nothing connects it to the plane
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 06:57:29 it's still interesting
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 06:57:38 it's not used a lot
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 06:57:54 did i say it wasn't
