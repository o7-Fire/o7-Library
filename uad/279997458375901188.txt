plane-crazy 2019-06-26 09:53:08 Hello there.
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 09:53:17 Wait a min...
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 09:53:34 Figorboy...Sounds familiar
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 09:53:39 Whatever
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 09:53:49 I do recognise you
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 09:53:54 I mean fungamer
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 09:54:13 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:22:24 ive been trying to build a torpedo on my heli and while that i found that if u use an anchor block the torpedo's engine might fail.
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:22:29 is that a bug?
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:23:00 i mean the engine just stops working but you can hear the noise of the engine
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:23:10 it stops providing thrust for the torpedo
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:24:00 weII i found out what happens when u lock the position of an object, then launch something unanchored
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:24:30 when u do tho....the result is that it'll move for a while and then the engine will stop working and the torpedo will freeze too
plane-crazy 2019-07-06 03:24:45 not exactly freeze but the engine stops working, the torpedo can still be pushed
bug-reports 2019-07-06 03:27:06 when you anchor an object and send a part of the vehicle (like a torpedo) with a detacher. if theres an engine on that part, it will fail to function in a short time.
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 10:48:24 can magnets interact with another player's build?
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 10:48:45 why does it seem people r unsure?
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 10:49:15 i kinda had a test with someone in my server....magnets don't seem to react to anyone else's build
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 10:50:00 did magnets used to interact with other player's vehicles?
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 10:53:30 well that was only expected
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:07:08 has anyone ever made an automatic guided homing missile?
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:07:28 multiple? geez
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:07:39 how do people do it?
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:08:06 no i mean...the biggest problem is the guidance system
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:08:34 oh
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:09:32 wait i don't mean pilot guided missile
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:09:45 like an air to air missile
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:09:58 i can't?
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:10:24 ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:10:27 oh well
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:10:44 it's not like ur wrong cuz ive tried that for so long
plane-crazy 2019-09-22 11:10:49 and it seems impossible
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:38:19 so why do people submit creations?
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:42:33 idk
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:43:16 planecrazy got boring once I actually built some really well functioning creations
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:43:35 maybe I could...find a way to get some challenge?
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:44:16 same

creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:44:52 I just have some random inspiration and then I'd create that build till i get bored
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:45:22 Sandbox building games to me is like...an artist drawing on his canvas
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:46:00 well it's hard for me cuz I love breakthroughs
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:46:09 oh wait
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:46:18 motor2 glitching? how so?
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:46:58 add some torque
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:47:05 make sure it's just enough
creations-chat 2019-10-03 07:48:40 also maybe i can see how it's glitching?
creations-chat 2019-10-08 06:45:28 so how do u get different ranks?
creations-chat 2019-10-08 06:45:37 also what so ranks do?

plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:28:51 I just don't know what will happen to the map...or the platform where the plots will be on will change.
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:30:28 fortnite might never die....but I hope it stays this way
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:30:46 it's still dying

plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:34:38 I'm a noob at this.
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:34:49 my largest creation has 3 folds
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:35:31 it's some sort of battleship right?
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:35:57 well u guys have problems with lag that causes ur vehicle to move slow?
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:36:27 darn
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:36:36 well how do u solve the movement problem?
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:36:57 I don't?
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:37:03 ;-;
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:37:55 wut
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:38:01 wdym
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:38:42 I'm guessing it's some sort of corvette?

plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:41:00 wao neat
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 07:41:17 okay hard to make
help 2019-10-16 04:33:24 I think it’s just how the force is exerted on which part of ur vehicle
help 2019-10-16 04:34:29 And the part of ur vehicle that doesn’t want to move but ur exerting force on it
plane-crazy 2019-10-17 05:26:06 Ohai
creations-chat 2019-10-17 07:39:17 lmao it looks trollish
creations-chat 2019-10-17 07:39:41 would be so funny if someone tries to evade this as a ship
general 2019-10-17 07:43:23 you mean CoD garena?
general 2019-10-17 07:43:28 lol
general 2019-10-17 07:43:59 wut.
general 2019-10-17 07:44:04 uhhhhh
general 2019-10-17 07:44:14 so it's not the garena version?
general 2019-10-17 07:44:31 yeah
general 2019-10-17 07:44:39 yeah
general 2019-10-17 07:44:53 i mean...it's as if they're all god damn bots
general 2019-10-17 07:45:04 or maybe they are bots
general 2019-10-17 07:45:05 yeah
general 2019-10-17 07:45:15 totally not worthy to play again XD
creations-chat 2019-10-17 07:45:43 big rip XD
general 2019-10-17 07:46:08 yes, if you add bots
general 2019-10-17 07:46:11 hahaha
plane-crazy 2019-10-17 07:59:29 lol his craft is sorta trolly
plane-crazy 2019-10-17 23:58:58 The question is, how do you make a mech walk like a mech
plane-crazy 2019-10-17 23:59:20 legs
plane-crazy 2019-10-17 23:59:30 well wheels would be a bit too easy
plane-crazy 2019-10-17 23:59:50 I guess so.
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:00:22 if only I could make some mech that can walk like an actual person
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:00:31 which is seemingly impossible
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:00:56 lol oof
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:01:53 lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:02:16 I've never quite made a mech because I don't have confidence to make one that can ACTUALLY WALK
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:02:48 also even if I made one it might lack features like turning
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:03:06 exactly my point.
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:03:10 it's too experimental
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:03:21 rip
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:04:15 yeah...if i ever made a mech I'd probably use a new method of walking instead.
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:04:20 that seems normal
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:04:59 I'd probably try making something hard to make.
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:05:09 usually anyway
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:05:25 I don't post creations because most of mine r highly experimental
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:06:11 especially the aircraft I had that could reach 500+ and still outmaneuver most aerodynamic craft
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 00:06:36 and it's winged
creations-chat 2019-10-18 01:58:00 that looks like an engine taken out from a car
creations-chat 2019-10-18 01:58:03 what can it do?
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:08:12 hmm...
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:08:27 so it's just an engine?
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:09:09 whats does that even mean...isn't that an engine?
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:09:33 I don't get the difference between an engenine and an engine
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:10:48 It's a part of the vehicle that transfer fuel into gas that runs pistons which generates power.
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:11:11 and engines don't have much of a purpose in a game where rotators have their own power.
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:11:30 no, i mean I have never ever made any "custom engines" because they seem useless
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:11:58 well magnets got fixed recently I think.
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:12:03 which sucked even more.
creations-chat 2019-10-18 02:13:05 then again an engine that looks like an engine and has pistons seems good looking but overall still not very useful.
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 06:00:20 What’s even good about ranks anyway
plane-crazy 2019-10-18 06:00:54 Meh...
creations-chat 2019-10-18 08:02:22 Wut's battlebots?
creations-chat 2019-10-18 08:03:41 Oof.
general 2019-10-21 01:39:07 INGENIOUS 😂
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 01:41:04 *sees transparent blocks*
BRUH
creations-chat 2019-10-21 01:41:59 maybe they're offended by it.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 01:42:42 BRUH 😂
creations-chat 2019-10-21 01:44:43 :/
creations-chat 2019-10-21 01:44:50 yeah
creations-chat 2019-10-21 01:45:03 it could be deemed as serious
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 01:47:20 is that pfp uhhhh...
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 01:47:29 a character from uhhh
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 01:47:33 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 01:47:59 lmao
creations-chat 2019-10-21 01:49:55 It's just miscommunication I guess...
creations-chat 2019-10-21 01:50:12 but seriously though don't say things that offend people
creations-chat 2019-10-21 01:50:28 no, it's when you say anything.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 01:51:07 well is it even possible for someone to not be offended anymore?
bot-central 2019-10-21 01:51:42 remilia scarlet lol
bot-central 2019-10-21 01:52:36 ?help
bot-central 2019-10-21 01:52:50 dyno :/
creations-chat 2019-10-21 01:59:02 why do people even argue about stuff geez
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:01:56 It's kinda hard to make something big NOT lag out
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:02:17 yeah true.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:02:54 it's so annoying when people make planes that are everything
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:03:09 im annoyed by "it can vtol and function like a heli,plane,rover,boat and even submarine"
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:03:28 in actuality they're not really built for these things.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:05:04 exactly lol vtol heli XD
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:05:14 floating boat is fine.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 02:10:52 ur ship is somehow capable of doing that perfectly.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 02:12:15 seems like it.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 02:12:31 the center of thrust is lower than the center of mass?
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:14:25 how does the creations submissions work
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:14:54 I think I care about functionality more than looks.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:15:03 kinda makes my creations look bad.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:15:37 quite fast for a winged craft
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:19:43 ima go look at creations for battleship designs maybe.
the-dump 2019-10-21 02:21:11 send nukes
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:22:04 my godness theres an actual interior for it
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:22:26 tho I mean a uhhh....
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:22:39 highly combat capable warship.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:22:49 the pvp type
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:23:35 k good night then
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:24:43 thats okay actually
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:25:19 Lag makes you tougher?
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:26:08 yeah something like that
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:26:26 I've experienced it on one of my ships...uses about 2600blocks
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:27:13 well then again the anti air is kinda hard to deal with for me.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:28:04 well have u actually fought people with planes fitted with tnt and they ram you?
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:28:08 ugh so annoying
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:28:39 oh...
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:29:04 so don't go to pvp servers or public pvp servers
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:30:03 well still...how do you deal with people who do this "planes fitted with tnt"
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:31:08 well tbh I was thinking of a way to take them down before they take me
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:31:33 like having a sort of ciws like weapon but on a larger scale.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:31:50 but it hasnt worked out...
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:42:05 how
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:45:20 how do u make a flying cutter.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:47:22 anyone know how to counter tnt fitted planes?
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 02:50:53 anyone know how to counter tnt fitted planes?
creations-chat 2019-10-21 02:51:56 "anyone know how to counter tnt fitted planes?"
help 2019-10-21 02:54:09 "anyone know how to counter tnt fitted planes?"
help 2019-10-21 03:00:47 .
help 2019-10-21 03:00:57 well how do you build a spinning cutter?
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:05:39 how do you build a spinning cutter?
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:09:16 I guess nobody knows how to make a spinning cutter.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:16:41 Anyone know how to make a spinning cutter?
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:17:02 wait that's it?
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:17:10 :/
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:17:16 how does that counter tnt planes
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:18:19 I wish there was a proper way to counter tnt planes....
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:18:50 yeah but most of the time they'll destroy you
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:19:00 yeah
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:19:50 well if only there was a way to shoot them down
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:19:54 properly
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:20:40 well they'll hit you first
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:21:10 actually anything that's not a land or naval vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:21:14 ik
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:21:26 it's hard for ships and tanks to do that though.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:21:41 yeah seems like it 😦
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:22:47 well a turret doesnt seem enough...
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:24:14 oh....thats new.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:24:25 new idea
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:24:34 ik I have a bomber with a rear turret
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:25:14 helicopters are kinda vunerable to tnt planes
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:25:24 anything slow it seems.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:26:14 jesus christ it's jason borne
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:27:14 somewhat yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:28:20 I have a plane that reaches about 400SPS and it is so maneuverable that I have trouble shooting with it.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:28:27 it's also winged
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:28:54 well non winged craft seem more maneuverable and fast.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:29:10 because game physics yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 03:30:03 yeah you do need less wings and more and better placed control surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:32:23 What's good about ranks.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:33:02 Whatever I probably don't need ranks.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:33:31 Oh...
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:33:51 Cool then.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:34:05 I'll try to take notice when they start
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:34:37 Nice
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:35:08 Well uhhhh
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:35:17 I realise I can get some ranks already
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:35:26 Lol whatever I'll deal with that later
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:36:15 Tbh I'm more interested in sharing creations than ranks.
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:36:37 Whatever...
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:36:57 Okay
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:37:08 Meh...
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:37:47 Nice
plane-crazy 2019-10-21 08:38:19 Ima leave for a bit bai
creations-chat 2019-10-21 11:45:36 My first post and first thrust based aircraft, has excellent performance in the air along with extra weapon advancements.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 11:55:04 Well good u kinda asked.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 11:55:19 I made this craft from thrust then wings.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 11:55:53 This makes the turning speed of the craft significantly much more maneuverable then when starting with wings.
creations-chat 2019-10-21 11:56:05 It does NOT perform like an aerodynamic aircraft
creations-chat 2019-10-21 11:56:17 And is capable of turning instantaneously
creations-chat 2019-10-21 11:56:39 While being stable
the-dump 2019-10-22 07:33:38 lawl
creations-chat 2019-10-22 07:36:20 :/ hai
general 2019-10-22 07:40:52 neo warfare X
general 2019-10-22 07:41:20 I see hymar
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:33:52 This is a new ship that's WIP so far, tell me how I can improve the looks of this while being able to pvp if you think it's not gud enough.
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:35:01 oof lol
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:35:23 so it's either pvp capability or looks?
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:35:34 rip.
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:36:00 I could remove the torpedoes and theres a dingy in the rear actually
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:36:27 yeah ik
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:36:34 it was originally just for rp purposes
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:36:45 okay lol
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:37:25 ima replace the dingy with mine laying devices
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:40:17 a huge minefield yes
creations-chat 2019-10-23 14:40:29 that's the idea anyway
creations-chat 2019-10-24 02:29:11 Should I just make a vehicle that looks good instead of focus on pvp abilities?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 02:29:26 (At least I’ll try to make it look good)
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:30:58 Would you guys rather see something with better pvp capability or better looks?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:31:19 Oh.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:31:42 Actually I’ve been considering whether I should stop making pvp vehicles.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:32:00 Yeah actually
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:32:26 Then again it’s a massive transition for me.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:32:42 Better details = better looks?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:33:31 Okay, maybe make a more interesting shape?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 02:33:43 Probably lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:33:50 Ah okay
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:34:32 I might as well start off with a simple creation and try to make it look good.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:34:47 Like a dingy? Or a large dingy in this case
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:35:09 Or maybe a ground vehicle? Like a car maybe
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:35:41 Wut
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:35:55 I’m not informed of “his turret”
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:35:58 Actually
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:36:16 Wut
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:36:44 I like the turret
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:37:00 The barrel give me a rail gun vibe.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:37:15 Lol rip
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:37:30 Okay I guess the chassis was ugly for him
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:38:03 “Details can be great, but if done wrong will ruin a build”
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:38:10 Okay then
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:38:39 Well the amagi is massive
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:38:47 So details are....fine I guess
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:39:13 Not really.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:39:26 I’m not very good at making replicas.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:39:33 Because I haven’t tried lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:39:56 A factory
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:40:22 I guess I do functionality over looks
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:40:27 Kinda sucks
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:40:31 Rip
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:41:10 :/ okay

plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:51:39 To the other one
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:52:04 Both made by different players
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:52:14 :/
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:52:45 Okay I guess details do make things better
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:53:01 :/
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:53:22 I’ll have to learn about how to make small details on a vehicle
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:53:36 Or just make an interesting shape for starters
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:54:39 Wow it’s large enough lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:54:52 Amazing XD
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:55:32 I guess I love functionality XD
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:56:08 To be it’s how something works
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:56:16 Not just whether it works
creations-chat 2019-10-24 02:56:58 A church
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:57:07 :/
creations-chat 2019-10-24 02:57:30 Those chairs

plane-crazy 2019-10-24 02:59:04 That was quite the commotion.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 03:00:01 Uhh
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 03:00:20 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 03:02:17 I’m tryna figure out how to make something look good
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 03:02:50 :/
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 03:03:34 :/
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 03:05:10 What do you think about the looks of this guy’s creation? https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/384025409945337856/636253515307810847/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 03:11:30 Just trying learn how to make good looking creations
creations-chat 2019-10-24 03:12:14 I like the t34 over there
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 03:12:56 I’ll be back later bai
creations-chat 2019-10-24 04:55:55 How is that a bad creation?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 04:56:14 It's literally the millennium falcon :/
help 2019-10-24 04:58:07 Maybe it's not totally balanced, plus make sure the center of mass is on top of the center of lift and the stabilizers maybe.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 04:59:11 
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 04:59:25 Why down vote this though? How can he improve his design?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 04:59:36 :/
creations-chat 2019-10-24 04:59:48 Does it have to be the best build in order for it to be good?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:00:16 Jesus lol
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:00:26 Okay
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:00:42 What's the best then?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:01:15 (cool flying pancake I saw it yesterday)
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:01:26 :/
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:01:47 U sure it is possible to make a perfect build?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:02:30 There's no way anyone can make the exact same thing from a picture.
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:02:43 Seems impossible to me
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:03:35 So I don't see how anything is going to improve his design if he has to follow a picture on the internet that probably isn't perfect either
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:03:55 :/
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:04:17 Awesome
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:04:23 What
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:04:27 :/ okay
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:04:33 Is everything bad
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:04:41 When do you say it's good
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:05:16 :/
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:05:33 Well I'll give my opinion on ur car
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:05:46 I think ur build looks awesome
creations-chat 2019-10-24 05:05:57 So sleek too
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:06:38 
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:06:42 I have learned a valuable lesson
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:06:52 No matter how much effort you put, it doesn't matter
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:10:48 :/
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:11:46 Well do you guys judge vehicles by looking at them purely?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:12:40 Sorta disappointed by "high standards" :/
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:13:07 Really
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:13:34 I feel like people post their stuff here just to be criticized about
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:14:02 And it doesn't help because the criticism is just being down voted
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:14:22 It sure feels like it
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:14:55 I feel bad for people who post stuff here and get unmotivated by down votes
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:15:43 That still makes them people 😕
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:16:19 Well that's beside the fact
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:16:27 People still get judged here
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:16:36 It's very uncomfortable to watch
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:17:06 It hurts to know that at least okay?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:18:27 How long did it take you
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:18:47 To get some positive builda
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:19:37 So it took you no time
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:19:51 To get positive builds
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:21:03 You realise people judge builds by looking at them right?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:21:39 Wut was it?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:22:23 I wanna see it tbh
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:23:25 Any early builds you still have rn that r positive?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:26:22 I can still see it?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:27:08 Legendofthesolomon...
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:27:17 It's been bothering me that well
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:27:28 This server is about judging people's builds
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:27:42 Okay
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:27:55 Okay :/
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:28:18 <#384025409945337856> still bothers me
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:29:25 See
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:29:29 That's what bothered me
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:29:33 I saw this actually
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:29:51 Another similar thing was a block getting tons of upvotes
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:30:48 People seriously judge you by looks...But does it matter if you can build something like this and get away with it? Don't say nobody has built this yet I'm sure tons of people have the same dumb idea
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:31:12 Exactly
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:31:24 Like what's wrong with people :/
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:32:06 Well first people say "looks mean everything" and then this comes up
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:32:22 Inconsistent :(
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:33:11 Yes, effort doesn't matter because people judge it by something direct. Like looks.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:33:20 And in this case, memes
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:33:34 It infuriates me to think about it.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:34:09 No it's so straight forward, people don't seem to care about how much effort you place
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:34:52 It's all about the irrational thought on a creation.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:35:10 It doesn't seem fair
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:36:03 So if you don't get negative comments on your builds, you become better?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:36:13 This is becoming an obvious pattern guys
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:36:18 Yes
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:36:22 It is a pattern.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:36:37 No negative comments aren't about advice here.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:36:43 People just say "bad"
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:36:49 It's not helpful
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:36:57 It's discouraging to people
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:37:06 And you guys are the ones behind it
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:37:17 I'm mad because you guys are judging them
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:38:01 Unless you like to watch the world burn, don't make the world burn.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:38:23 Is it even possible for anyone else anymore?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:39:58 Here's how I see it:
-People post their creations here to share.
-you guys say something negative, vague and judgemental.
-people get discouraged
-people try again
ITS A VICIOUS CYCLE
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:40:13 And this ends when people lose all their will to build again
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:40:31 It happens without you seeing it
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:40:38 You can't tell when people leave
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:41:15 Look...It's not as simple
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:42:12 Well I guess I already conveyed my point
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 05:42:33 Nobody is even aware of it
creations-chat 2019-10-24 06:52:35 but u got 6 likes
creations-chat 2019-10-24 06:52:40 nvm
creations-chat 2019-10-24 06:52:50 5 likes 6 dislikes
creations-chat 2019-10-24 06:52:53 :/
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:03:48 don't look at dislikes maybe...
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:04:06 people judge it by looks
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:04:17 (or just by looking once)
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:05:24 how fast though?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:05:48 :/
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:05:52 and why is that
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:06:29 well look at the size first.
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:06:46 I don't think he can fit that
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:07:05 well uhhh....
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:07:43 if it was smaller then it would be harder to go into detail, if it was larger it could have alot of detail but as you've said "could be smaller"
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:08:38 then it would be wide?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:08:48 okay then
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:08:54 I guess he could try
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:09:54 wut.
the-dump 2019-10-24 07:10:19 just for reference
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:10:37 like the one in <#495286269459300364> ?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:11:01 I'm not sure if that's possible for the detail
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:11:16 but okay if he has to do that then the creation has to be larger?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:11:28 (cuz that's too small)
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:12:10 isn't it 7 blocks wide?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:12:39 nine i mean
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:13:06 the front is hard to replicate though...
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:13:34 oh my that's actually nice
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:14:07 if theres a way to reduce friction while walking maybe.
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:14:21 but it's so cool
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:14:29 tons of rotors...
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:14:48 how'd u figure out on how to make this walk the way it is?
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:17:05 he could improve on that yes.
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:17:51 well usually I take inspiration from other vehicles...or irl vehicles
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:18:20 generally carriers do have control rooms on the side to obstruct the runway less.
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:19:30 uhhh
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:19:36 I mean the control room
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:19:45 probably inside
the-dump 2019-10-24 07:20:17 no control room? idk
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:20:27 just placing reference pics in <#495286269459300364>
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:21:37 I'm guessing that the control tower is the control room, which is probably somewhere on the tower on the side of carriers
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:36:46 :/
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:41:43 oh nice.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:43:22 plane crazy is pretty awesome for a sandbox game on roblox...
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:43:55 how is this not on the main page already
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:44:20 maybe people don't notice this game or don't like the genre or something else.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:45:13 it's hard when people complain about bugs i guess.
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:47:27 oh my it looks just like a simple tnt cannons i once built in minecraft, which was probably also build by many people in minecraft XDDD
creations-chat 2019-10-24 07:48:14 I think he meant that you could make the foot larger in area.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:49:17 lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:49:34 I guess not everyone is that good at using terms.
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:50:37 does that even exist is the better question lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:50:52 oh i didnt know lol
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 07:51:24 didn't take notice of this server till 3 days ago

creations-chat 2019-10-24 11:12:58 sorry i afk
creations-chat 2019-10-24 11:13:19 I mean reduce friction on the legs that are supposed to be off the ground
creations-chat 2019-10-24 11:13:43 but since they're balls, the legs that are not supposed to be off the ground touch the ground which creates friction.
creations-chat 2019-10-25 02:00:32 not judging this harshly then.
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 02:11:01 what makes it to <#627195143040139264> anyway?

general 2019-10-25 02:19:07 :/
general 2019-10-25 02:19:42 I'm not exactly new.
general 2019-10-25 02:20:26 :/

general 2019-10-25 02:20:53 2445 is uhhhh
general 2019-10-25 02:21:05 pretty much
general 2019-10-25 02:21:53 probably uhh....the owner XDDD
general 2019-10-25 02:22:09 why can't alex get his roles back though?
general 2019-10-25 02:22:19 you used to have purple?
general 2019-10-25 02:22:25 i dont remember very well
general 2019-10-25 02:22:35 oof
general 2019-10-25 02:22:57 well I havent
general 2019-10-25 02:23:12 they're important?
general 2019-10-25 02:23:45 I don't really need recognition
general 2019-10-25 02:23:56 yeah exactly.
general 2019-10-25 02:24:05 I don't think it really matters what role you have.
general 2019-10-25 02:24:37 wait....the toaster is yours?
general 2019-10-25 02:24:46 the one in <#627195143040139264> ?
general 2019-10-25 02:25:00 not sure
general 2019-10-25 02:25:42 oh.
general 2019-10-25 02:25:49 I like the texture of the bread
general 2019-10-25 02:26:09 the shades of grey on the outside contrast with the inside perfectly
general 2019-10-25 02:26:55 oh.
general 2019-10-25 02:27:08 I guess black didn't look good eh...
general 2019-10-25 02:27:29 I know that it might have been accidental but your toaster looks like a silver toaster.
general 2019-10-25 02:28:12 I wonder how that got you
general 2019-10-25 02:28:19 ???????
general 2019-10-25 02:28:22 wdym
general 2019-10-25 02:28:45 that's even better
general 2019-10-25 02:29:01 ye...
general 2019-10-25 02:29:20 this one is recent
general 2019-10-25 02:29:26 it got downvoted like hell
general 2019-10-25 02:29:43 I got really upset over people judging it.
general 2019-10-25 02:30:04 they said it was too long
general 2019-10-25 02:30:08 ye
general 2019-10-25 02:30:10 also that
general 2019-10-25 02:30:48 and why is that?
general 2019-10-25 02:31:18 having no ranks means could mean that you are a secure person.
general 2019-10-25 02:31:37 :/
general 2019-10-25 02:32:04 30upvotes for hall of fame.
general 2019-10-25 02:32:17 it's not that bad.
general 2019-10-25 02:32:29 infact I like the detail on it
general 2019-10-25 02:32:57 It gives it a new feel to it, you guys probably don't understand fake colours
general 2019-10-25 02:33:13 do you see grey on a white vehicle? no of course not
general 2019-10-25 02:33:22 but it gives it a lively feel rather than boring white.
general 2019-10-25 02:34:04 heres a good example
general 2019-10-25 02:34:10 do you see red on a yellow flower?
general 2019-10-25 02:34:20 but it has grey
general 2019-10-25 02:34:42 theres a direction to it.
general 2019-10-25 02:35:21 but look at the good bits, even if this is bad.
general 2019-10-25 02:35:36 the detail is way way better than most of the ones you've shown.
general 2019-10-25 02:35:43 like the fans in the rear
general 2019-10-25 02:35:53 or the cockpit on the side
general 2019-10-25 02:36:13 plus this guy noticed the elevation on the rear
general 2019-10-25 02:36:33 the colours on the top are detailed
general 2019-10-25 02:36:39 I could go on with this
general 2019-10-25 02:36:49 theres way more good bits than bad bits
general 2019-10-25 02:37:03 you don't need observation to judge some build to be bad guys.
general 2019-10-25 02:37:34 even if it doesnt fly it's a sculpture.
general 2019-10-25 02:37:41 and it's detailed
general 2019-10-25 02:38:08 well you can't even tell it can't fly by the picture.
general 2019-10-25 02:38:18 but it has great artistic value to it.
general 2019-10-25 02:38:50 why is there a massive argument with u guys
general 2019-10-25 02:38:51 :/

general 2019-10-25 02:40:59 curly he's judging you 😦
general 2019-10-25 02:41:21 but he just says bad because he knows you made it.

creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:36:06 I know this might be alot of work but if you want to improve ill give you this advice 🙂
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:38:48 it is now, but how about giving him some thought rather than bare criticism.
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:39:13 the fact still remains, there are limitations so only do what you can.
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:39:19 don't give advice that is impossible
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:42:25 well then how do you think he can build the scope?
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:42:32 I reccomended 5x5
creations-chat 2019-10-25 07:42:43 he is putting effort.

help 2020-01-14 02:13:22 Adding more wings or using a better engine would be the solution.
help 2020-01-14 02:14:06 It’s easy to tell the issue from the pics, the wings are obviously tiny and the plane looks heavy
help 2020-01-14 02:14:41 Wdym by that creativforce
help 2020-01-14 02:15:05 Yeah but he’s already done that, his plane isn’t flipping out of control
help 2020-01-14 02:15:12 It’s that he’s flying at low alt
help 2020-01-14 02:15:21 And unable to fly higher
help 2020-01-14 02:15:46 Wait
help 2020-01-14 02:16:06 How is having yellow high the problem
help 2020-01-14 02:16:45 It’s higher than the engine fyi
help 2020-01-14 02:17:12 Oh crap
help 2020-01-14 02:17:23 Don’t bring it even more back
help 2020-01-14 02:17:30 Bring it forwards
help 2020-01-14 02:17:39 Crap u guys messed up
help 2020-01-14 02:17:43 If it’s too close
help 2020-01-14 02:17:45 That happens
help 2020-01-14 02:17:58 Don’t place it too far back
help 2020-01-14 02:18:05 It makes ur plane unstable
help 2020-01-14 02:18:12 Oof
help 2020-01-14 02:19:16 Why not?
help 2020-01-14 02:19:27 U need to work on stability first
help 2020-01-14 02:20:13 If your stability is good, your turning will improve
help 2020-01-14 02:20:23 However too stable means it’s not maneuverable
help 2020-01-14 02:20:26 Find a balance
help 2020-01-14 02:22:49 Slowly bring the center of mass forwards
help 2020-01-14 02:23:42 Lol it’s the firebrand 😂
help 2020-01-14 02:23:49 Anyway just find a way to do that
help 2020-01-14 02:24:02 The mass, or the yellow bit
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 06:54:12 anything that can provide sufficient turning force to your craft.
plane-crazy 2020-01-14 07:01:35 If theres more mass, then you'll need more force.
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 06:45:59 How interesting
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 06:46:04 
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 06:46:12 😂
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 06:47:32 do u guys vote more based on the pic quality
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 06:49:17 so true it hurts😂
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 06:49:38 😂 😂 😂
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 06:56:55 Idk why some builds have more votes than other builds.
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:23:53 ????
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:24:12 well okay, arm basically is a safety switch
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:24:33 if the tnt isn't armed, it can't explode on contact for example.
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:24:38 yes
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:26:08 First off, what even is "super strength"?
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:26:49 or you could view it as power to ratio?
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:26:51 idk
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:27:20 super strength is already controversial to me
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:31:47 yea
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:48:11 When a newbie goes into ur slot and takes a look at ur creation, it means he/she is interested at what ur building.
plane-crazy 2020-01-16 08:48:46 This happens a lot when I'm building too so it's commonplace for me and totally not annoying
creations-chat 2020-01-17 01:30:42 It’s a submersible? OwO
creations-chat 2020-01-17 01:32:52 But it’s like the dolphins submersible I saw sometime ago.
creations-chat 2020-01-17 01:33:05 Winged submersible
creations-chat 2020-01-17 01:46:51 Oh
creations-chat 2020-01-17 01:47:08 F for respect.
creations-chat 2020-01-17 01:47:32 😂
plane-crazy 2020-01-17 01:56:01 sounds useful.

creations-chat 2020-01-17 01:58:47 also it's not truly a tri is it? it looks like theres 2 rotors in the rear
creations-chat 2020-01-17 01:59:28 lol

creations-chat 2020-01-17 02:05:40 cyclone

general 2020-01-17 02:06:26 rule 10 sounds ridiculous.
creations-chat 2020-01-17 02:13:30 thats a very nice thing to do
general 2020-01-17 06:00:37 :/
general 2020-01-17 06:01:38 Is it truly justified to say someone is toxic when you are yourself?
general 2020-01-17 06:01:57 Interesting question ^
help 2020-01-20 15:16:47 I have a simple question, how do you change smoke colour

creations-chat 2020-01-20 15:37:40 My first ever replica, It's a p40c tommahawk.
creations-chat 2020-01-20 15:38:19 fyi I only built this because my friend penguin made me under peer pressure 😂
creations-chat 2020-01-20 15:39:37 btw tell me where i can improve this build.
creations-chat 2020-01-20 15:40:58 😅
creations-chat 2020-01-20 15:41:03 I don't get it
creations-chat 2020-01-20 15:42:26 Oh I see
creations-chat 2020-01-21 00:33:44 Why are there no votes in <#384025409945337856>

creations-chat 2020-01-21 11:22:47 Why is there a reaction 😅
creations-chat 2020-01-21 11:24:05 Wait in the meantime tell me how to improv.
creations-chat 2020-01-22 00:18:49 What’s interesting is that there are more likes than dislikes when there are more wedges
creations-chat 2020-01-22 00:20:09 Guess it’s not worth posting creations for feedback
creations-chat 2020-01-22 01:30:21 The heck, someone got banned for being underaged.
creations-chat 2020-01-22 01:55:00 so you guys like fictional builds or realistic builds or somewhere in between?
creations-chat 2020-01-22 01:55:52 😅
creations-chat 2020-01-22 01:56:16 and how do u do an ok job exactly
creations-chat 2020-01-22 01:56:43 oh actually tbh I wouldn't be here without pen pushing me to building that p40
creations-chat 2020-01-22 01:56:46 😂
creations-chat 2020-01-22 01:57:02 well u mean build something new?
creations-chat 2020-01-22 01:57:42 yea...and it seems that when someone builds then it gets disliked alot.
creations-chat 2020-01-22 01:58:22 okay
creations-chat 2020-01-22 01:58:27 ill observe a bit
creations-chat 2020-01-22 02:01:05 .
creations-chat 2020-01-22 02:01:15 looks like it's about how much time you spend on one creation
creations-chat 2020-01-22 02:01:39 it's the details on each creation that catch the eye.
creations-chat 2020-01-22 02:01:41 yes^
creations-chat 2020-01-22 02:01:46 seems that way.
creations-chat 2020-01-22 02:02:16 if I need to do that, it'll take alot of time and I only started building replicas cuz of penguininvasion37
creations-chat 2020-01-22 02:02:37 might as well do so when I have the motivation to.
creations-chat 2020-01-22 02:03:20 to get many upvotes, the trick is to treat every creation like an art piece?
creations-chat 2020-01-22 02:08:47 I'ma see if I can make it so details win over functionality if i were to share another post
creations-chat 2020-01-22 03:48:28 lmao
general 2020-01-22 03:59:53 whats going on
general 2020-01-22 04:01:02 uh, nihilism?

How to know if all this is true?

general 2020-01-22 04:02:23 so math and documentation, how do we know it's accurate?
general 2020-01-22 04:02:37 and how do they know why this happens?
general 2020-01-22 04:02:44 how they document it
general 2020-01-22 04:03:11 I already did obviously, I'm just pushing the sword deeper into it's wound.
general 2020-01-22 04:03:24 😂
general 2020-01-22 04:03:48 that's not trash, but it's definitely hard to prove whether what people say is true.

general 2020-01-22 06:03:36 Oh, there are two ways
general 2020-01-22 06:04:32 U can make sure the props face down at some point so it’s a thrust based submarine
or you can make the submarine in a way that it submerges at a certain speed, which is a speed based submarine.
general 2020-01-22 06:05:07 I prefer using submarines that dive at a certain speed, those submarines are faster
general 2020-01-22 06:05:18 The one I have only went 87kts ish
general 2020-01-22 06:05:29 I’ve seen faster
general 2020-01-22 06:06:08 Well I mean warship craft, because everyone’s fastest craft in warship craft goes 195kts right?
