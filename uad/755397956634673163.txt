plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:10:29 How do you guys go past 650
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:10:43 My fastest record is only 640
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:11:18 And because I encounter up and down bobbing of the nose
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:11:56 My worst was being bobbed when I was still not past 300
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:12:10 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:12:28 All my planes are extreme dogfighters
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:12:59 But when you try to push the speed you get bobbed
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:13:05 Uhuh ok

bot-central 2021-02-08 15:19:27 Ha
bot-central 2021-02-08 15:20:56 > fuckable
<@651361636657135617> 
Need saucc?
bot-central 2021-02-08 15:21:11 Heh
bot-central 2021-02-08 15:21:23 It's not on pixiv
bot-central 2021-02-08 15:21:35 Pixiv is way darker
bot-central 2021-02-08 15:22:06 Want it?
bot-central 2021-02-08 15:22:18 Its ok

plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:24:03 Precisely what is H?
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:24:45 Nothing to see here
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:25:21 ^~^
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:27:17 How do you guys defend against shredders?
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:27:33 I used tail guns
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:27:45 And it worked
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:28:52 Yeah ik but the problem was that I couldn't go fast as the phantom forces which we discussed b4 stopped me from going 550+ in level flight
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:29:50 AND it's no use nor going into pvp
The shredders can just push you around and wreck your gaming experience
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:30:18 Uhuh ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:30:41 I can margin at 320 if my luck doesn't run out
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:30:59 I just cant
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:31:10 I have a self destruct for my plane
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:31:25 Those usually works a bit
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:32:02 > my jet is too agile to be chased anyways
<@651361636657135617> yeah and by unknown reasons my A10 is faster then my Mig
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:32:20 That's just pure crap
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:32:46 > how fast
<@436271317772140564> mig=300 top 
A10= 400
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:46:05 Anyone made exotic planes ?
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:46:22 Like Wright Flyer, etc.
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:48:06 Anyone interested in making planes of Chinese origin? 
Like the JF-17 , J-10 and stuff, they dont get cared for a lot
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:48:35 Wait
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:48:58 The Jf17 is an indigenous design
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:49:20 Who?
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:49:25 Me and you?
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:49:33 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:51:23 > j 10 is basically f 16
<@780498934186639380> 
Man I dont want to promote Chinese supremacy but the J10 is a independent design, just redesigning the air inlets would take ages. The canards? Kill me, please.
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:52:22 <@780498934186639380> 
> Man I dont want to promote Chinese supremacy but the J10 is a independent design, just redesigning the air inlets would take ages. The canards? Kill me, please.
<@755397956634673163> The intake of the J10 is rectangular while the F16's more like an oval
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:53:10 Uhuh ok
