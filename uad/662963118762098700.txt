plane-crazy 2021-01-17 17:37:51 i have  a question, does this count as a space?
plane-crazy 2021-01-17 17:38:12 i am looking the way where should the map be
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 09:10:48 fun fact: roblox doesn't like orbital speeds
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 09:12:03 the gaps between blocks and the nozzles don't look good
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 09:17:05 no
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 09:17:49 it is
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 09:22:20 technically i did not used fuel bcuz you can't go faster after some point so at the time when i reached that point i just hold q and this makes the 12047 speed magic for me
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 09:22:56 it is the most powerful bug i know
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 09:23:34 and i was launching with 45 gravity
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 09:26:14 add a bit of weight to the back
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 09:26:33 and try get the yellow dot closer to the leggs
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 10:21:50 the rocket can be reused, the launching system can grab the rocket
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 09:43:57 red dot = main pilot seat, yellow dot = my drone (and the blue text that says me = me)
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 09:44:06 a nice weird bug
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 09:44:16 i can normally control the drone
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 09:45:00 what is that
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 19:17:43 i just made thing with 10 parts that got over 60 000 height
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 19:19:24 no
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 19:26:29 just lowered the part count to 6
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 19:29:29 now it can go to around 40k height, by my math
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 19:41:02 I think I reached the limit with my "vehicle"
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 19:41:06 4 parts
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 19:41:09 and 30k altitude
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 19:43:25 it has just a just a seat, rocket engine, propeller that spins it and fuel
plane-crazy 2021-02-16 19:47:20 i may be able to make a 3 part "vehicle" if i get the center of mass right
plane-crazy 2021-02-21 14:27:13 LO?
