general 2020-11-09 03:17:31 why are peple so harsh
general 2020-11-09 03:17:34 when voting
general 2020-11-09 03:17:50 Nice!
general 2020-11-09 03:19:04 lol
creations-chat 2020-11-09 03:19:25 Why are people voting so harshly
never seen people vote like this
creations-chat 2020-11-09 03:21:55 <@!710208141144489995> Makes sense, but there was a guy who made a decent MIG 21, but got so many downvotes.
creations-chat 2020-11-09 03:25:18 > it was below decent
<@!489910972946055172> Wow, I'm kinda afraid of posting my builds now...
creations-chat 2020-11-09 03:35:09 It's probably great in terms of fly ability and handling. But is bad at details and looks
creations-chat 2020-11-10 00:38:47 Why does a picture of an upvote get more likes than a boeing 737 max 8
