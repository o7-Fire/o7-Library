plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:37:15 Sky dive with a dive bomber
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:37:39 That way, you sky dive along side your plane
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:41:23 Death by snu snu
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:45:13 How do I make warships somewhat viable for PvP lol
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:46:28 Gotta look fancy when you kill someone
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 16:51:29 Do materials effect durability of blocks
general 2021-12-03 16:54:46 You guys put music when you PvP?
general 2021-12-03 16:54:59 I put boss music whenever I see a shredder ball
general 2021-12-03 16:55:33 Doesn't have to be plane crazy though
general 2021-12-03 16:59:27 Also crafts going invisible when damaged some times
general 2021-12-03 17:01:36 I actually thought the reds are tracers
general 2021-12-03 17:03:20 I just assumed them to be tracers because they were easier for me to see
general 2021-12-03 17:05:12 And when it capsizes it reveals itself to be a commerce raider battleship
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 17:07:19 If the only reason warships are not so reliable is because of agility
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 17:07:33 Might as well make them fly like a fighter jet
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 17:07:36 üëç

help 2021-12-03 18:14:39 The entire container just opens up like a flower or just the roof opens
help 2021-12-03 18:14:49 Either one
help 2021-12-03 18:16:59 Wait my brain juice is dryer than asphalt
help 2021-12-03 18:17:15 Basically just a Cardboard box opening?
help 2021-12-03 18:18:28 I just usually keep things simple because the complicated things break more often for me

help 2021-12-03 18:20:25 It looks stupid but its fun
help 2021-12-03 18:21:09 Actually would it be cooler if it was a Tank instead?

help 2021-12-03 18:22:12 I thought you came for advice
help 2021-12-03 18:22:26 And my advice is wacky
help 2021-12-03 18:23:06 Also the Semi and the trailer should act as a catapult lol
help 2021-12-03 18:23:11 A medieval catapult

help 2021-12-03 18:28:20 Best way to enter a PvP server
help 2021-12-03 18:30:13 God how big is your semi
help 2021-12-03 18:31:05 2 plots minimum can work I guess
help 2021-12-03 18:32:24 Let alone throwing the container itself at you
help 2021-12-03 18:33:21 Bruh do you think you can give it enough range to launch containers from airport to base?
help 2021-12-03 18:33:35 That'd be rad
help 2021-12-03 18:34:24 It started out as an ordinary Semi truck
help 2021-12-03 18:34:36 How did it become a medieval catapult
help 2021-12-03 18:35:38 I might as well make my own version once I'm done with my flying ship
help 2021-12-03 18:36:09 Its gonna be military styled though
