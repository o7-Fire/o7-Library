general 2022-04-18 14:36:32 bruh this bot keeps thinking im saying something bad and deleting my messages
general 2022-04-18 14:37:43 wow nvm then guess im leaving
plane-crazy 2023-03-06 02:48:56 hey, does anybody know how to prevent a build with a fold from twitching constantly?
plane-crazy 2023-03-06 02:49:08 I have one that basically snaps into an unfolded position for a second
plane-crazy 2023-03-06 02:49:21 I'm using that one.
plane-crazy 2023-03-06 02:49:43 I would use the other type, but when I do in any build, it causes rotation.
plane-crazy 2023-03-06 02:50:44 that could work, I'll try it.
plane-crazy 2023-03-06 02:51:37 I don't, but I just don't really like normal motors all that much, servos are my favorite.
plane-crazy 2023-03-06 02:53:07 that worked super well.
plane-crazy 2023-03-06 02:54:23 nevermind, it didnt
plane-crazy 2023-03-06 02:54:46 fuck it, fine, I'll try a normal motor.

plane-crazy 2023-03-08 07:58:34 yo, day one here of attempting to fly all the way into the null zone to the point where you die in an airship that only moves with a speed of 18.
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 07:59:10 I'd send a pic of the ship, but I'm not high enough level sadly
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 08:01:57 from what I've heard, you do EVENTUALLY.
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 08:02:13 supposedly, it should take 15 minutes at a speed of about 10k
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 08:02:47 well then, I'm just going till my internet cuts out or something
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 08:03:22 I mean, doing the math with the exact values I was given it should take 5.2 days, so if 5.2 days pass and I don't die, then I'll just quit.
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 08:04:05 no, I want this to be an actual challenge
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 08:04:38 multiple people in the server I'm in keep telling me similar things, but I'm not caving in, I've been to the null zone with fast things so many times that it's really just lame now
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 08:05:01 but going there on a multi-day journey? seems fun to me.
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 08:05:56 I already have my PC running almost 24/7.
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 08:06:20 if I wanna waste my time, let me waste my damn time.
plane-crazy 2023-03-08 08:07:48 either way, I'm likely going to pop in once a day around the same time to give updates. though, it'll likely just end up being updates on how long it's been.
plane-crazy 2023-03-09 08:54:54 so uhh... internet cut out. it only does this like, a few times a year. so ye uh, guess I'm not doing this anymore
