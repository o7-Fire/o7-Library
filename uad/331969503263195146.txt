[Ball Motor / Motor 3] 
[Blocks]

Motors are very useful in building, but some times it is very hard to use, in some cases you want to make something that can rotate 2 axis, maybe something like a gun or a simpler tank turret, the Ball motor would fix that problem, I had an idea that this motor can rotate in 2 or more axis with 4 keybinds that are configurable, it would be greatly useful if it is implemented into the game.
