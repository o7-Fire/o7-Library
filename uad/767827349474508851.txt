creations-chat 2022-11-13 01:24:21 i tried to do a video for tank suspension on the creations chat, nothing worked. not even basic attached files, nor a URL due to the channel-bot saying (image only) yet there are videos in past chat, and text in those chats, so I'm going to upload it here instead, due to the glitchy madness. https://streamable.com/e/1d6dj0
creations-chat 2022-11-13 01:33:23 OMG LOL
creations-chat 2022-11-13 01:35:54 (I just wasted 2 minutes that I could have just been writing a meassage; I do not like slow mode one bit.) [continuing the "omg lol", I would say {I MANAGED TO CONVERT THE WMV FILE TO MP4 AND IT IS .1MB BEFORE IT IS OVER 8MB!}]

creations-chat 2022-11-13 01:43:16 Aftersock, do you know why it does not allow me to upload images or streamable links into <#384025409945337856>

creations-chat 2022-11-13 01:45:53 bruh- when you are so close to lvl 3; https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/384027830192832513/1041166644908667010/card.png?width=705&height=213, anyways is it okay if i upload something on my alt, as if i were to say i am the jeb master in the chat. while including an image of it?
creations-chat 2022-11-13 01:50:37 I ask again, is it okay if i upload on my alt and send an image proving i own my alt (as it is not on my rust_6614 account)
creations-chat 2022-11-13 01:52:40 when you ping me my hopes go "<:Upvote:490311647492309004> " but when its not related to it it goes "<:Downvote:490311668556103700> "

creations-chat 2022-11-13 01:59:54 so you are targeting noobs.
creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:03:33 lol, funny joke (not). the goal of whitenames are to become other names, so they can become an expert, or anything else, if everyone downvotes a single thing due to :whitename: the moderators cannot give the role due to having too many downvotes. It is also not funny <@545785816127897611> neither is it funny <@939960830181642330> and <@1029091633037328404>
creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:06:28 They do not even view the video before they downvote, so what is the point of not posting cringe stuff, if they dont even know if its cringe or not...
creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:10:18 Nerd means someone who is smart, but might be weird in ways, I take that as a compliment as you are saying I am smart, a nerd can mean they look weird, but the inside of someone is better than the outside, and i know you are going to do another nerd gif as I have posted a long paragraph of a message.

creations-chat 2022-12-16 12:23:05 ||Skill issue||
general 2022-12-19 03:23:41 Does anyone have software that I can hook up my PS4 to my PC and show the PS4 input? - Here's a more detailed paragraph involving my issue. Whenever I mean software, I mean like something that can turn the HDMI port on my pc temporarily Into a HDMI-In port. You know, the kinds monitors and TVs use? If you're wondering, I cannot plug the PS4 into my monitor because it doesn't support HDMI. And the monitor is too low definition (1368x728) to support VGA to HDMI connections. It just doesn't work. I'm looking for software that doesn't use anything else other than just casting something via HDMI to my pc. It's like how if you were to connect a newer Android to your pc and use it as a Computer. I am so very sorry for making you read this.
general 2022-12-19 03:24:32 Yeah... I went full on nerd on that.
general 2022-12-19 03:24:47 But thats a real issue I need solved

general 2022-12-21 00:07:55 huh
general 2022-12-21 00:08:26 The grammar here. It sucks.
general 2022-12-29 03:02:40 **Unofficial Grammar Rule #1.** **Don't send messages in bursts,**
 e.g. 
User: **can i** -today at 9:48:00
User2: **Can you what?** -today at 9:48:16 -replied to User's message today at 9:48:00
User: **buy a game** -today at 9:48:46
User3: **what** -today at 9:48:57 -replied to User's message today at 9:48:46

**Conclusion: It may confuse users. Don't do this.**
general 2022-12-29 03:19:20 When people make fun of people. Moderators: It's time.
general 2022-12-29 03:20:48 Hey, At least I didn't take it off of Google Images.
general 2022-12-29 03:21:18 Prove it.
general 2022-12-29 03:23:36 Harrasment
general 2022-12-29 03:24:25 Read rule #1 please.
general 2022-12-29 03:25:04 Then use common sense.
general 2022-12-29 03:26:22 Still, It's not a joke to harass other users.
general 2022-12-29 03:27:22 You're no better than me.
general 2022-12-29 03:30:28 Please stop.
general 2022-12-29 03:31:12 Stop annoying me. That's obvious.
general 2022-12-29 03:32:18 I don't care. I can tell someone to stop if they are hurting my feelings. Ever heard of feelings?
general 2022-12-29 03:39:01 It's an Unofficial Grammar rule. Unofficial means it is not Official. Read the definition of Unofficial here. https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/unofficial
general 2022-12-29 03:39:51 And, it's a joke.
general 2022-12-29 03:40:26 Not all jokes.
general 2022-12-29 03:48:52 More like looking on other servers? I have a life.
general 2022-12-29 03:49:30 Bullied?

general 2022-12-29 04:02:04 LOL
general 2022-12-29 04:03:49 If you keep doing that you will eventually get banned for harassment. If I were you, I would stop. Time to leave.
general 2022-12-29 04:04:26 Im not saying im a mod.
general 2022-12-29 04:05:37 I'm just saying that I have my right to call someone out for harassing someone else or myself.
general 2022-12-29 21:56:28 I'm back.

general 2023-01-23 03:22:10 Conflicting mods. But which one of 50 some mods?
general 2023-01-23 03:22:46 Ever heard of optifine.jar in the mods folder?
general 2023-01-23 03:22:54 Forge is compatible with optifine
general 2023-01-23 03:23:27 Explain this

general 2023-01-23 03:26:12 Not even the official minecraft server
general 2023-01-29 04:50:52 And this, is the general server
general 2023-01-29 04:52:14 there's nothing wrong with that. you can be unique in any way. From usernames to other stuff.
general 2023-01-29 04:52:51 i can run shaders. is that not good enough. also, optifine is needed with my setup
general 2023-01-29 05:00:40 close enough
general 2023-01-29 05:01:48 also general means all, unclassified and other stuff
general 2023-01-29 05:02:38 other than that.
general 2023-01-29 05:03:38 general means a wide variety, but this general is slightly limited due to the fact that this server has actual mods, and rules.
general 2023-01-29 05:03:48 Rules overcome everything, even general
general 2023-01-29 05:05:01 why exactly did you just call an admin?
general 2023-01-29 05:05:33 I know, but there is nothing wrong with small arguments
general 2023-01-29 05:06:17 you dont need to call an admin over something so dumb...
