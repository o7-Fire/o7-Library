creations-chat 2023-01-30 18:49:29 I think you should make it longer
creations-chat 2023-01-30 18:58:50 I think its fine with the how long it is now but you could use half wedges in the up to make the curvature
creations-chat 2023-01-30 19:02:09 It looks pretty good now tbh
creations-chat 2023-01-30 19:48:44 You could try angled lock
