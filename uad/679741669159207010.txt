plane-crazy 2020-05-23 02:36:23 my build wont fly like a plane
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 02:36:34 its almost entirely pannels and wings
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 02:36:44 its got plenty of helium

plane-crazy 2020-05-23 02:40:46 the back portion is filled with them, the inside has them, theres some in the misection, the tail has some
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 02:41:15 i think its the speed, but more super rockets isnt making it any better
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 02:41:20 its faster but still wont fly
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 02:43:36 its hovering
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 02:43:41 but it wont fly like a plane

plane-crazy 2020-05-23 03:39:41 idk
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 13:43:47 I used Conveyor-drive
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 13:43:56 it worked when all other engines couldnt
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 13:44:02 thx for that advice
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 13:44:12 but my turning is a little slow...
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 13:44:23 not sure what to do bout that
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 13:44:39 i rly cant place any more flaps
plane-crazy 2020-05-23 17:37:01 conveyor engine powered Y wing with turning turret, vtol capability, and reversible movement
general 2020-05-23 18:14:14 <@!331490905846448129> thats not a Y wing
general 2020-05-23 18:14:20 thats a DIFFERENT type of ship
general 2020-05-23 18:14:33 That is a BTL Y wing
general 2020-05-23 18:14:38 not a normal Y bomber
general 2020-05-23 18:14:40 there is a difference
general 2020-05-23 18:14:50 its a DIFFFERENT TYPE GENIUS
general 2020-05-23 18:14:57 AS IN CLONES HAD BOTH TYPES
general 2020-05-23 18:15:32 you are not smart are you
general 2020-05-23 18:15:43 The republic AND the rebels used SEVERAL TYPES OF Y WINGS
general 2020-05-23 18:15:50 You showed me the BTL Y wing
general 2020-05-23 18:15:54 thats 1 type used by both
general 2020-05-23 18:15:58 but there are MULTIPLE types
general 2020-05-23 18:16:04 are you stupid
general 2020-05-23 18:16:08 does brain no work you?
general 2020-05-23 18:16:23 aw mad cause you are wrong
general 2020-05-23 18:16:35 you think your plane being so great makes u right
general 2020-05-23 18:16:36 it doesnt
general 2020-05-23 18:16:41 Need not to argue
general 2020-05-23 18:16:43 as in you are wrong
general 2020-05-23 18:17:01 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-wing read up son
general 2020-05-23 18:17:12 There are multiple types of y wings
general 2020-05-23 18:17:16 the clones used BOTH types
general 2020-05-23 18:17:23 the rebels used the streamlined type
general 2020-05-23 18:17:32 which was ALSO used by their predecessors
general 2020-05-23 18:17:33 the clones
general 2020-05-23 18:18:30 genius, let me send you a pic
general 2020-05-23 18:18:50 
general 2020-05-23 18:18:52 THIS IS ALSO A CLONE Y WING
general 2020-05-23 18:18:56 BUT IT IS NOT THE BTL
general 2020-05-23 18:19:05 
general 2020-05-23 18:19:07 note the difference
general 2020-05-23 18:19:10 both clone
general 2020-05-23 18:19:13 but different
general 2020-05-23 18:19:34 it does, its just small because i didnt feel like lengthening it
general 2020-05-23 18:19:51 it has a 4 block kneck section
general 2020-05-23 18:20:00 so?
general 2020-05-23 18:20:04 the colors dont mean anything
general 2020-05-23 18:20:12 the only thing the colors do is distinguish BATALLION
general 2020-05-23 18:20:17 stupid
general 2020-05-23 18:20:26 Let me ALSO point out, the GREEN on mine
general 2020-05-23 18:20:31 it is a CLONE BATALLION
general 2020-05-23 18:20:34 GREEN BATALLION
general 2020-05-23 18:21:06 
general 2020-05-23 18:21:10 thats where the neck section is
general 2020-05-23 18:21:30 hahahha mako you dumb
general 2020-05-23 18:21:39 the colors dont really mean much besides the BATALLION
general 2020-05-23 18:21:49 Green= CLONE GREEN BATALLION
general 2020-05-23 18:21:55 red= CLONE RED BATALLION
general 2020-05-23 18:22:01 Yellow= GOLD LEADER

creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:47:13 Yes they do. That's why it is called a common phrase.

creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:48:45 If you don't, you might require therapy.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:52:25 > this went from some dumbass saying i need a therapist because i called somebody's roblox plane ugly to common english sayings and how you're better than all of us because you know them
I didn't say i was better because I know them, I implied I was better because I have better manners and know when to be partly polite instead of a blundering fool.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:53:07 Again, back to that common phrase, Takes one to know one.

creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:54:15 apaulo. Just because you are as much of an idiot as these two doesn't mean you have to show it off.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:54:28 also, awesome <@!670939038999511041>
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:54:56 K, I will check it out.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:55:09 Cygnus, smartness is relative.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:55:31 the width?
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:55:34 you mean the diameter
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:55:53 do you mean the diameter
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:56:08 you need to tell me what the DIAMETER IS
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:56:09 dummy
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:56:12 not the width
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:56:15 DIAMETER
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:56:34 Width is different than diameter
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:56:37 its completely different
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:56:45 to find the answer you need to correct parts.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:56:53 lets just say the diameter is 5
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:57:04 if the diameter is 5
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:57:09 then the radius is 2.5
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:57:12 which means
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:57:15 98.17 is the volume
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:59:34 Cygnus, no need to worry, by now your brain cells have gone through an apocalypse
creations-chat 2020-06-02 19:01:44 Dead is still fine, and fine is relative.
creations-chat 2020-06-02 19:02:44 I just find it amusing how it seems decent to make fun of someone in a game, most likely because someone does that to them....
