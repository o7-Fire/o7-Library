they just bought that and acted like it came with the happy meal
basically the entirety of the video [I watched it cause I was bored and its so poorly made] is they order an "among us happy meal" and the food is covered in blood, the drink is urine and then theres knocking on the door and every time someone knocks something bad happens the first one was literally just the among us plushie taped to the door'
and the second knocking was also another plushie taped to the door

Has Among Us negatively affected how we view things in the world.
Will a red rectangular fire detector siren with curved angles with a clear glass cover over the siren lights ever look the same again.
Please tell me this isn't true.

Please tell me there is a way to not see red Among Us crew mate.
What even was life before Among Us.
It is like a new phase of the world has started with the awakening of Among Us.
Things in our environment will slowly change into things that appear like they're from Among Us.
All for the end goal of Amogus IRL.
Will I someday have to turn on my fellow crew mate while in the cold steel structure of the Skeld dropship.
Only to utter the words
"Red Sus"

plane-crazy 2022-09-02 19:35:25 most of the time
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 19:35:57 if youre makking a pvp plane idkk how the variable sweep wings could affect performannce
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 19:36:14 unless its just made out of part without drag
