plane-crazy 2019-04-18 22:14:10 do all roblox communities attack you if you dont meet their godlike standards?
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 22:15:37 thanks, i did not know there was a <#478584971670454284> channel. but for the record, i asked two questions and you only ever shouted the answer to the first question at me
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 22:16:34 maybe youre not very accepting of people who like to have their questions answered in a polite way
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 22:17:35 i didnt imply that, i asked a follow-up question that was not answered well, all i got were angry "answers" to my first question
plane-crazy 2019-04-18 22:18:49 sorry <@!163143541160148992> , i realize it wasnt you who was being rude, it was someone else

help 2019-04-18 22:22:21 hi, i havent played for a bit, but my car is not working the way it used to. it can move forward and back fine, but when steering, the car just stops. i recognize that the wheel is hitting against the block in this picture, but that has not been a problem when steering when i played before. I just want to know if this is something permanent or if it will be fixed
help 2019-04-18 22:22:56 constructive criticism only please

plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:38:33 whats wrong with discord mobile
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:38:53 🤦
creations-chat 2019-11-16 21:40:24 minimalist bus with suspension lol
creations-chat 2019-11-16 21:40:33 also has popup rocket booster
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:41:43 it would be nice if you could make anchor blocks control while button pressed only
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:41:47 instead of just toggle
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:42:24 lol sure
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:48:44 what does motor2 do
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:49:24 oh
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:49:33 that’s actually extremely useful
plane-crazy 2019-11-16 21:49:57 gotta put that on my popup missiles somehow lol
general 2020-04-20 03:07:10 hi love the game
general 2020-04-20 03:08:14 just joining to ask if anchor blocks can be given toggle option. in other words, to have the anchor block only be activated while holding a button instead of a toggle
general 2020-04-20 03:08:38 sad
general 2020-04-20 03:08:43 why
general 2020-04-20 03:08:57 fr?
general 2020-04-20 03:09:19 ok then he didnt die
general 2020-04-20 03:09:32 doesnt seem like that difficult a feature to implement though
general 2020-04-20 03:09:57 like adding a toggle button in the settings for anchor block
general 2020-04-20 03:10:01 oki
general 2020-04-20 03:10:55 i have a knife car that works rly well at cutting but if i dont anchor before i chop then it flings lol. so if anchor blocks could be activated only while a key is being held down it would really help
general 2020-04-20 03:11:18 for now i just have to enable before cut then disable to move
general 2020-04-20 03:11:21 but oh well
general 2020-04-20 03:11:43 ive never built a boat in this game
general 2020-04-20 03:11:55 only motor mechanisms or off roaders
general 2020-04-20 03:12:07 and knifes on wheels
general 2020-04-20 03:12:43 a mirror option in build mode would be cool lol. easy building symmetrical stuff
general 2020-04-20 03:13:23 btw, does anyone else's camera default to the fixed position when spawning in a vehicle? it's really annoying
general 2020-04-20 03:13:38 seriously? why???
general 2020-04-20 03:13:42 the fixed camera is the worst
general 2020-04-20 03:13:47 smh
general 2020-04-20 03:14:08 i dont want to have to press Q like 3 times every time i spawn
general 2020-04-20 03:14:35 is it for auto controls for wheels too then
general 2020-04-20 03:14:52 because my battle blender defeaults to fixed camera and has no wings
general 2020-04-20 03:15:32 so you guys dont like the camera change either?
general 2020-04-20 03:15:35 i hate it lol
general 2020-04-20 03:15:50 i dont use cameras
general 2020-04-20 03:16:00 the camera setting is what im talking about
general 2020-04-20 03:16:18 what does the "physics" toggle on the anchor block do
general 2020-04-20 03:16:34 there are a lot of toggles in this game that seem to do absolutley nothing
general 2020-04-20 03:16:39 oh ok
general 2020-04-20 03:17:07 ok, second question, what does the lock toggle do on pistons or motors
general 2020-04-20 03:17:29 oh
general 2020-04-20 03:17:33 that doesnt work then lol
general 2020-04-20 03:17:59 i put my pistons on lock thinking that would do what you said, still got moved around when pushed
general 2020-04-20 03:18:20 oki
general 2020-04-20 03:18:34 why are hover pads so laggy
general 2020-04-20 03:20:39 do you guys like my blender :D
general 2020-04-20 03:20:48 dont mind the guns
general 2020-04-20 03:21:08 it detaches from the base
general 2020-04-20 03:21:15 and spills tnt on everyone lol
general 2020-04-20 03:22:41 my car
general 2020-04-20 03:23:34 oops spillage
general 2020-04-20 03:23:46 no ur gay
general 2020-04-20 03:26:47 why does this game give me horrible render distance by default even tho my pc is definitely capable of more
general 2020-04-20 03:27:50 like what is this render distance, why roblox
general 2020-04-20 03:28:24 yeah
general 2020-04-20 03:28:37 in every other game, automatic gives me good render distance
general 2020-04-20 03:29:03 no
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 03:35:23 they should let us cut tnt
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 03:35:34 tnt is invinsible against guns and cutters
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 03:35:56 yup
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 03:40:25 does anyone else know that one spot in the rails where you get stuck every time
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 03:41:11 this spot. every train i make gets stuck here
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 03:46:42 um ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 14:47:15 will the flamethrower be available again in the next summer event
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 14:52:33 they bought the pass
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 14:52:46 was the winter wheel available in both winter events?
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 14:52:48 I forget
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 18:07:14 are they ever gonna improve the UI
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 18:41:17 update
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:16:01 do you like my biplane
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:16:59 
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:17:22 because there needs to be a way to get in
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:18:06 how so
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:18:30 motor plus propeller blade doesnt make nearly enough thrust
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:19:04 nah
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:19:36 how are jet engines supposed to make a biplane look better
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:19:45 biplanes arent supposed to have rockets strapped on the side
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:20:19 but his argument is that it will make it look better
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:20:31 how does it make it look better if it doesnt affect the appearance
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:20:36 are you dumb?
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:20:51 thanks
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:21:12 it's a small aircraft though
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:21:30 also as i said motors dont make enough thrust
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:21:50 also the propeller i have now fits perfectly
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:22:03 yes, i doubt you're doing the same for my messages though
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:22:27 lol hypocrite
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:22:44 i literally just said a custom engine doesnt provide enough thrust TWICE
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:22:58 and why did you say rocket engines would make it look better if youre telling me to hide them
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:23:04 you literally make no sense
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:23:07 this argument is over
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:26:51 um
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:27:13 no offense but i honestly think my biplane is betetr than the blocky mess that is the first one
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:27:34 also, i dont need tips on how to make a biplane by someone who thinks biplanes have rocket engines
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:28:12 i literally dont care about thrust
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:28:58 i dont care about extra thrust on my BIPLANE
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:29:28 also savoic i cannot take you seriously ever since you told me to "hide rocket engines in the fuselage" to make it "look better"
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:30:10 why would i replace the propelor engine, that's literally the whole point of the biplane
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:30:38 should i say it a third time
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:30:49 a custom engine didn't make nearly enough thrust for the biplane
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:31:02 savoic i cant tell if youre actually serious or just trolling
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:31:11 because god help you if you are serious
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:31:36 lol veterans
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:32:08 because he told me that hiding a rocket engine in the fuselage would make it look better. put the two and two together if you can
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:32:47 savoic, i truly wonder how you came to that conclusion
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:33:01 <@!296280922771292170> idk, motor plus propeller blades
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:33:24 it was just 4 prop blades connected to a block on a motor
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:33:41 it almost touched the ground
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:33:50 well it created barely any for me
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:34:05 il see if i can build it again
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 22:34:14 just dont be a jerk about it like others lol

plane-crazy 2020-04-30 16:55:47 huh, after refueling it from 0 the plane doesnt move
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 16:55:49 must be a bug
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:01:18 this game is inappropriate
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:02:47 why do you keep quoting me
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:03:27 thats not what an oxymoron is
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:03:46 um
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:03:54 you could just google the definition
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:04:09 huh?
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:04:59 cam?
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:05:21 did you even look at the picture

plane-crazy 2020-04-30 19:07:36 what
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 00:25:02 do delta wings have the same physics as normal wings
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 00:30:31 idk tinker with it
plane-crazy 2020-05-01 00:30:36 I think it may be damping

plane-crazy 2020-05-08 15:58:14 i would assume so
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 15:59:46 they should add a gyroscope block that will try to keep your build upright, with adjustable power
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 19:56:58 can there please be a limit on how many spheres idiots can use
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 19:57:53 yes they do
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 19:57:56 i use spheres
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 19:58:04 but a lot of people just use them as lag generators
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 19:59:06 um
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 20:00:33 great now theres a horn spammer
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 20:01:28 mmm
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 20:16:05 chop
plane-crazy 2020-05-10 23:59:20 I wish they’d fill in those random ditches in the grass area
creations-chat 2020-05-11 01:07:48 woww gomna go spase?
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 18:58:26 ugh i hate those flying cutter things that toxic kids use
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 19:02:49 wow thats fast
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 19:03:40 some of us dont pointlessly criticize other people just to gain a false sense of superiority
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 19:04:36 you missed the quarter pounder
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 19:32:02 i made a most impressive land vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-05-11 19:32:50 yes u are
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:13:45 whys this game getting laggier and laggier
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:14:36 um no
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:15:03 this game seems to get laggier after the performance updates
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:15:21 k
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:18:26 why cant i go in blacklisted players' plots after they spawn in anymore
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:18:29 in pvp
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:18:53 must be a glitch in my server or sumn
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:19:21 hopefully so, otherwise it would be unfair to melee vehicles
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:20:18 VPN + google
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:20:44 then there aren't any
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:22:23 just use your imagination
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:22:25 and make one yourself
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 19:22:37 i didnt know so many other people rely on youtube tutorials
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 02:07:38 wth happened to the blacklist barrier disappearing when someone spawns in their build?
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 02:07:59 now that it stays, builds that use cutters cant damage turrets that stay in their base
plane-crazy 2020-06-01 17:25:13 cut a tank in half
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:14:44 do false reporters get warned or anything
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:17:15 lol im not unde
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:17:25 same guy who made that report said this
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:17:31 im 17
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:17:59 yeah, i dont think someone who watches aot would be unde
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:20:30 oh sorry about not putting a report in reports
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:20:35 pls no ban
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:20:58 no thats not what i was talking about
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:21:12 i wasnt even being toxic anyway, he was just mad lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:28:02 people copy my builds all the time
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:28:19 and i mean it, literally every server i join one or two players try to copy
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:28:27 they never get it right though so i dont mind
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:35:42 is it just me or are hover pads laggy
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:36:22 idk what that is but it looks cool
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 02:41:57 they should make cutters heavier to balance out pvp. wouldnt work anymore on those annoying flying cutter missile things lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 21:00:45 what does it mean if a report is removed
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 21:29:25 man pvp is so broken
plane-crazy 2020-06-04 21:29:49 blacklisting someone should not make you able to pass through them. it becomes too OP
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:04:12 when are they going to make it so blacklisting doesnt remove collisions in pvp? it was an accepted suggestion a while ago
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:07:04 ;-;
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:08:04 i feel like this should be enough to let me make suggestions lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-05 15:08:56 where do i submit?

general 2020-06-12 02:32:06 <@!422221846491168812> why did you downvote? Please tell me so I can improve
general 2020-06-12 02:33:35 the suggestion
general 2020-06-12 02:33:37 about pvp changes
general 2020-06-12 02:34:19 wdym?
general 2020-06-12 02:34:30 i can see how i kinda suggets both a nerf and a buff for cutters
general 2020-06-12 02:34:34 but they are in different aspects
general 2020-06-12 02:36:00 well right now, if you blacklist someone, you cannot collide with them. this is abused for cutters to go straight through builds instantly killing them
general 2020-06-12 02:37:06 👍
plane-crazy 2020-06-12 16:30:41 uhh what happened to the button to get out
general 2020-06-15 01:38:01 wait did roblox change scrolling
general 2020-06-17 03:26:57 aHHHH roblox is dOwN
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 17:15:13 wuts the water shooter thing do
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:37:50 is rickje ever going to balance out pvp?
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:38:18 i mean if you blacklist someone then it turns collisions off, making cutters OP
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:38:46 or cutters are so light that they can easily make flying cutters that are op
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:39:20 when collisions are off there is no point on more armor
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:39:36 hmmm
bot-central 2020-06-28 15:39:39 !servers
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:39:53 wow thanks
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:41:56 if i try to join pvp mode will it take me to a public server
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:42:25 oh ok
plane-crazy 2020-06-28 15:45:30 how do i know if someone else is pvp enabled
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:02:24 i suggest using those annoying flying cutter things to be a bannable offense please
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:03:44 i can think of a few solutions
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:03:55 make cutters much heavier so they are less mobile
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:04:24 and yes they are hard to kill when you are a land vehicle and they are a flying cutter going 500 mph with collisions off
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:04:33 me
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:04:58 yeah thats kamikaze
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:05:05 i dont want to also die in the process
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:05:11 it defeats the purpose
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:05:37 but yeah, i would suggest making cutters heavier so they cant fly as well at the very least
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:06:06 yes but when everyone in the public pvp servers uses them that can be a difficult feat
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:06:43 i saw a suggestion earlier of a non-pvp block with the same shape as the cutter
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:06:47 and another block which is the shape but inverted
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:07:23 blacklist abusing is what they do
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:07:40 and no, when they are going 500 mph it would be virtually impossible to hit them with a cannon
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:07:50 uh, no, they aren't slow
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:08:33 but whatever, nobody ever changes their mind on the internet so virtually every argument is pointless
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:08:42 them
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:08:43 me
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:08:45 they
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:09:18 the one that has 36 super rockets strapped on the back
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:09:43 should i block him
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:09:58 this one was in the back
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:10:07 and it wasnt multiple shredder bugs it was just one big one
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:10:58 no you read it
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 15:11:10 ok
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 21:02:17 chop

general 2020-10-20 18:02:49 is this happening for other games too?
general 2020-10-20 18:07:33 the loomian legacy server says its just some servers that are doing this, but otherwise your data should be safe

plane-crazy 2021-05-01 01:11:26 I've tried a few reciprocating mechanisms in place crazy and this one has worked the smoothest for me so far. does anyone know of any better ones? https://streamable.com/3cwajz
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 01:13:14 i'm not sure what it's called
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 01:14:07 yeah lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 01:14:21 thank you
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 01:18:32 yeah, i used that specific mechanism in my domino laying car to push the dominoes
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 01:18:39 i'm just trying to find something more compact ig
plane-crazy 2021-05-01 01:26:18 I suppose it could be used in that way

at least it wasn’t flooded under someone else’s stuff lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-07 17:42:08 has there been any roblox update or anything that has messed with plane crazy physics
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 22:51:20 does setting something as ice material actually make it more slippery
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 22:51:30 oh
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 22:51:31 good
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 22:51:35 that will be useful
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 22:51:51 i see
plane-crazy 2021-05-09 22:51:54 thank you
plane-crazy 2021-05-17 15:26:58 does anyone else have an issue with this game freezing often
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 18:02:29 anyone else have the issue where cutters dont work if theyre attached to suspension?
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 18:02:55 its not for a weapon
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 18:03:07 im making a grinding machine because they look satisfying
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 18:03:14 like those videos on youtube
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 18:03:53 also will the hitboxes for the 7-long beam ever be fixed
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 18:03:57 its literally so annoying
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 18:30:56 why is painting cutters so hard
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 18:31:19 the hitbox is like 2 pixels wide
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 18:32:47 sometimes the back is unreachable
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 18:32:49 but thanks
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 18:35:52 making giant shredder machine, any suggestions
https://streamable.com/mnirhx
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 21:18:18 what does the physics toggle on the anchor block do
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 21:19:28 so it allows the anchor block to move if connected to a rotor?
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 21:19:52 or do you mean the other way around, but that can already happen with it off
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 21:20:25 ive never had issues with that, weird
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 21:20:33 and i use anchored blocks in my mechanisms all the time
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 21:21:03 ah i see
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 21:22:58 this is probably a lesser known issue but
do you know if theres a way to get cutters working again if theyre connected to suspension/pistons etc
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 21:23:06 cause if they are connected to them they dont work
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 21:23:23 i need to connect it to a 0 stiffness suspension to keep it on 1 axis of movement
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 21:24:48 i only use them with self-protect off so i can create like blenders or hydraulic presses lol
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 23:55:48 how long is spawn shield
plane-crazy 2021-07-06 23:56:42 i wish it was disabled on dealing damage to your own build with cutters that are self-protect off
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:05:55 satisfying dominoes
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:07:32 there is black at the end
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:07:35 therefore not gay

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:09:38 😂
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:09:41 is this one ok
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:09:43 or too cringe
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:11:10 why is it called motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:11:13 why motors
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:11:50 was it ever even an intentional feature
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:12:45 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:13:22 i posted it a while ago, apparently nobody really liked it lol

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:14:20 hmmm
ive never used a motor lock before, nor do i know how it works
i just know people use it to condense builds i guess
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:15:16 yeah il probably look into it later
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:46:31 it needs to be a plane or tank to please the majority
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:47:31 is physics on
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 19:22:03 something i didn't know; if you stretch out suspensions long enough, they can bend
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 19:25:23 can this game please save the music setting
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 19:25:34 im sick of having to turn it to client every time
