plane-crazy 2021-03-15 06:37:00 I can't post pictures here bc no + thingy but I made a starship of sorts
plane-crazy 2021-03-15 06:37:24 hmm
I see
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 23:53:14 not concering a build but a player
A user by the name of "Sxlary" or something like that was impersonating dream and scamming some dumb child just now
I feel bad because I reported him through roblox for scamming then gave a detailed description but knowing how badly that stuffs enforced theres nothing I can do now
I looked for the username in the playerbase but no name came up and I can't think of any other way it was spelled
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 23:55:46 nope
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 23:56:01 no x at the end
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 23:56:23 he didn't have the mask
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 23:56:43 I probably spelled it wrong so i said "something like"
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 23:57:06 he didn't have the mask but he *did* have some antlers
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 23:58:37 he was a player with that @ looking like thing next to his username ingame, a symbol that someone is a patron of the game? I dunno im panicing about this idiot fetus
plane-crazy 2021-03-29 23:58:55 someone else was with him
