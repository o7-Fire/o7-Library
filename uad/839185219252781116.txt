help 2021-11-07 21:53:57 there are many stuff that could go wrong if ur plane doesnt work but if its only pointing down them try adding some helium blocks at the front
help 2021-11-07 21:54:17 if it is ONLY pointing down then theoretically that should be solved
help 2021-11-07 21:54:40 but if you dont have enough engine power and wings to create lift the plane will fail all the same
bug-reports 2022-10-13 19:22:29 its prob lag. common with a lot of the pvp servers ive went into and had to deal with the deletion of a block taking 30 seconds, but its not that extreme. maybe check your wifi connection

general 2022-10-17 17:35:07 average cts player mindset
help 2022-10-17 17:36:19 by this do you mean the entire structure including motorlock or just the white things
help 2022-10-17 17:37:17 if its the white things then it is because they are connected to the motorlock chain in the middle. consider using blocks such as wedges to replace them instead so they dont contact the motorlock chain and still looks good
help 2022-10-17 17:38:34 if its the entire structure then thats because its connecting to the motor thats supposed to move it by half a block

bug-reports 2022-10-17 17:50:07 its been here for like months. either paint another block before gliding your mouse onto the sign/text or paint it from the edge

plane-crazy 2022-10-17 18:39:30 for me simply increasing the save slots
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 18:39:31 is enough
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 18:40:04 i have like 100 builds and have to save them in different accounts and have to constantly delete the shit ones i made
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 18:40:24 wish they would add a better form of organization between slots
plane-crazy 2022-10-17 18:40:45 all you can do is load a slot then save it to a different slot then wipe the original slot
