general 2021-05-10 12:26:39 i tried making a realistic truck suspension 
the results: couldnt make the cabin ride smooth while having suspension and regular steering in the front
suspensions in the front did not function because of motors in the way

general 2021-10-05 12:10:19 I was looking for a 427 v8 sound and what I got was an audio of someone saying "vroom vroom" ðŸ˜‚
creations-chat 2021-10-05 12:29:59 Update: this is the most complicated rear-end that I have made because I have to fold and motor lock and somehow make everything fit with no issues
creations-chat 2021-10-05 12:32:07 Is there a way I can fold before the motors lock?
creations-chat 2021-10-05 15:33:50 I figured out a way to do it before seeing your message, I motor locked the rear-end and the roof. Thanks though.
