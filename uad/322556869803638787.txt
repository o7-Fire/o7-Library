plane-crazy 2018-09-08 15:58:20 So how exactly to ranks work
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 15:58:27 Oh, there's a ranks tab
plane-crazy 2018-09-08 16:01:56 Well, I can join a world in abit because I'm pretty sure my pirate ship can earn some sea rank
plane-crazy 2018-09-09 01:22:37 Once I actually get it into the water, I think I have a boat that can give me a decent rank
plane-crazy 2018-09-09 15:36:44 Voted
plane-crazy 2018-09-09 15:36:54 Wait, replicator?
plane-crazy 2018-09-09 15:36:58 Neato
plane-crazy 2018-09-12 13:09:47 Will be making a very large aircraft carrier soon, will soon have the rank if grand sea marshal.  I really want the role, Sounds awesome
plane-crazy 2018-09-14 01:12:32 Well I accidently saved over my gallron which was well over 1000 blocks and boy do I want to cry
plane-crazy 2018-09-14 13:19:12 I made a tiny submarine, only some 100 blocks
plane-crazy 2018-09-14 13:23:36 Once I get back home I might make another pirate ship.
plane-crazy 2018-09-14 13:23:46 I already have a dual master schooner, that flies
plane-crazy 2018-09-15 17:16:48 Yo I'm here hol up

plane-crazy 2018-09-17 13:22:02 Yo you reminded me of an old roblox game, cold winter
plane-crazy 2018-09-17 13:22:30 Basically an open worlds wasteland game, like apocalypse rising, but no zombies
plane-crazy 2018-09-17 13:22:56 Every so often, nuclear winter would set it, and you'd have to get to a bunker or you'd freeze
plane-crazy 2018-09-17 13:31:19 In class.
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 15:39:34 Holy crap I haven't played plane crazy in barely a week yet all this stuff gets added
plane-crazy 2018-10-07 15:41:50 The thing I'm most siked for is probably the paint.  About to get on and see everything
help 2018-10-23 22:28:27 So a guy named gaetjens made both a rocket engine crasher and a literal penis and I was wondering if there is a way to ban him
help 2018-10-23 22:29:04 <@217336009455566848>
help 2018-10-24 00:21:41 I've got a question if anyone can help.  I made a jet, everything is symmetrical and the lift and mass line up perfectly.  However, when taxi-ing or flying, it drifts left for no reason.  Even if my mouse is center on my screen, it still drifts left.
help 2018-10-24 00:22:20 Anyone got any suggestions to fix it?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:43:15 What do ice blocks do?  Do they slide a bit on the ground?
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:43:30 Neati
plane-crazy 2018-11-09 00:43:33 Neato
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 02:55:39 Anyone else having trouble connecting to a server?
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 02:58:43 I think you may have downed quite the few servers
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 02:59:40 False.  Before helium I made a flying pirate ship that self stabilized
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 03:00:38 Guys I think plane crazy went down ._.
plane-crazy 2018-11-10 03:00:52 Oh lovely
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 16:58:34 Allo
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 16:59:07 Awesome, sorry I had to leave so abruptly.  Lost track of time
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 18:48:24 There is an airport
plane-crazy 2018-11-11 18:48:33 You gotta build the 747s lol
creations-chat 2018-11-12 19:56:44 Will post a picture of my warship.  Outside details aren't all the way finished, and there's no interior, but it's personally looking pretty good
creations-chat 2018-11-12 20:05:45 ok posting time
creations-chat 2018-11-12 20:05:57 This is Dusty
creations-chat 2018-11-12 20:08:28 okay my turn.  This is Dusty
creations-chat 2018-11-12 20:08:37

creations-chat 2018-11-12 20:09:11 interior isn't done yet, nor is all the outside detailing, but it still is looking nice personally
plane-crazy 2018-11-19 02:10:36 Hey do you guys know how to send group invites?
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:50:09 Is there a way to suggest contests?  I've got a good one
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:50:25 Ah, thanks
plane-crazy 2018-11-20 01:51:35 There we go.  Contest idea in suggestions
help 2018-11-21 23:31:10 Anyone know how to make flush hinges?
help 2018-11-21 23:32:09 Could you kindly post a picture of an example?
help 2018-11-21 23:32:29 More like the connection of a large vessel
help 2018-11-21 23:33:47 Wait I might have an idea
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:21:57 I've got a real interesting submission.  Its armored, just not what people would expect
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:22:08 for the contest that is
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:23:37 there.  its in contest creations now
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:24:20 dang thats a nice cockpit mate
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 20:24:52 thanks!  figured, well its armored, and it can traverse terrain.  Also, i doubt anyone else had thought of it
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:46:18 Dang.  I was doing well in the contest but I think I'm gonna get beaten.  My railway cannon's got 17 ups but the black orange and blue tanks got 19.  Well I guess ggs because I dont think many people will be voting lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:47:12 Must not have seen that
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:48:43 Saw the 25 tank.  I'll admit I like his color palate
plane-crazy 2018-11-28 19:50:40 Well if I want to win the contest I need some 8 odd votes in an hour and 40 minutes
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 02:06:44 Dang, ggs on the comp.  It was a close one
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 02:07:23 <@267577976349130752>
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:37:58 Thanks.  Nearly said you too before processing it lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:42:22 If 2k people played, it would be only fitting to celebrate
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:43:12 I meant at one time sorry
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:44:12 Ok buddy
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:44:19 Ima have to ask you to calm down there
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:44:42 There is no cursing on this discord
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:45:20 Welp
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:45:37 I agree
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:52:03 Maybe not seperate maps, but more optional craft spawn places. And larger biomes
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 15:52:56 Fair enough.
plane-crazy 2018-11-30 16:32:22 HIIIIIIIII

plane-crazy 2018-12-03 12:58:20 Depends on my mood
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 12:58:25 More of a jazz fellow.
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 13:01:02 I mean, I listen to classic rock but nothing really modern
plane-crazy 2018-12-03 13:02:16 I'm curious to see the trapdoor block.  Haven't been able to get on recently
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:21:57 Hey.  Let's not go around throwing heccs
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:22:57 Welp, time to get me mallet

plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:25:29 I've broken the system
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:25:59 Fair enough.  I suppose I'm an abnormality
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:29:47 Wait I will join you momentarily with my tiny yet suprisingly realistic fighter plane
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:31:04 I meant join you in posting pictures
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:31:36 Hey can we redirect that photo to creations
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:32:18 That part was a bit of a tossup for me.  Sorry
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:33:41 I played the game for quite the while, but haven't been extremely active kn the discord until recently
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:36:35 I can hear that image
plane-crazy 2018-12-04 01:36:51 Ingame now
plane-crazy 2018-12-08 18:52:25 Ello everyone
plane-crazy 2018-12-21 20:32:55 Sorry for the big bit of inactivity.  I've had a lot of stuff to do recently.  I'll try to be on, but I wont be as active as I will when February starts
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 13:17:06 Oh boy
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 13:18:11 I appreciate your attempt to try and solve the problem, but you shouldn't be pinging mods either
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 13:19:03 See which mods are on, and ping one of them.  Do not ping all mods
plane-crazy 2018-12-22 13:19:56 <:okbuddy:518518403686989856>

plane-crazy 2018-12-31 02:18:12 Did a bit of reworking so my old railway cannon can be used for the contest
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 05:33:10 Happy new year yall
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 05:33:36 Was a bit busy
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 05:35:34 I've got a question for those who have been building trains.  How do you have multiple large cars that otherwise would exceed the plot
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 05:36:12 I've been lucky recently, family matters have cooled a bit, aswell as other things slowing
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 05:36:23 Not a full break, but that should be coming soon
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 05:41:37 Goodnight for now yall.

help 2019-02-02 02:18:56 Brief question.  Do ballasts also affect the weight of a craft, or just its buoyancy?
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 02:20:29 Hey I got a quick question.  Do ballasts affect the weight of a craft or just the buoyancy
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 02:21:19 I'll figure it out the hard way lol
plane-crazy 2019-02-10 15:03:57 Checked creations for the first time in a while.  Holy crap a lot of people are making Gustav cannons.

general 2020-08-28 18:30:34 I remember Orangeskii and Proto, as well as the drama they brought lol
general 2020-08-28 18:31:11 Its still nice to see the discord has an active community though.  Maybe now that I have a bit more free time I can reclaim the disc mod rank
general 2020-08-28 18:33:24 Ima see if I can't get some screenshots of my recent builds, they're pretty sick IMO
general 2020-08-28 18:37:14 Mans shmoovin
