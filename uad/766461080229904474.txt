plane-crazy 2021-01-18 17:46:51 lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 17:47:01 That was happened o be before
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 17:47:07 to*
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 17:47:26 I was just like that guy you saw
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 17:47:41 It's a glitch with the parachute
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 17:48:03 But cool German Plane!
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 17:48:10 I'm building the Bismarck
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 17:50:32 It's pretty Big.‚õ¥Ô∏è
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 17:51:31 It looks good
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 14:46:07 So I wanted to build a Titanic from a YouTube video, but non of them were the size I wanted or tutorial's on bigger versions of it. So I took it upon myself to start building my own HUGE! Titanic. (These are the Blue prints and I know they don't look very good, but it's fine.)üõ≥Ô∏è
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 14:51:05 thx
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 14:51:13 I'm starting today
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 20:51:01 So this is what I'm at in my Titanic Build...
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 20:51:27 exactly... üôÇ
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 20:51:52 yeah...
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 19:38:03 I'm having a problem...
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 19:38:25 and I was wondering if anyone knew how to fix it
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 19:39:41 This is a ship I'm building, it looks normal but the motor won't turn to make the ship go together...
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 19:40:59 idk If the  part I'm connecting the bow to is too big or there more weight on one side than the other?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 19:41:38 So if anyone wants to help, please help : (
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 19:44:04 maybe try fixing the way you might have put the motors? But I really don't know.
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 19:48:18 You might have them to close together or a block in the way of closing it
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 19:49:03 because if there a block in the way where the motor is going then it bounces back
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 20:09:29 Uno reverse
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 20:10:08 
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 20:10:30 Your Among Us is getting deleted
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 20:10:49 Maybe it's getting stuck on something?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 20:21:49 Np
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 20:22:49 Which is harder to build?
Titanic or Bismarck

plane-crazy 2021-08-14 17:59:01 They made an MG42
