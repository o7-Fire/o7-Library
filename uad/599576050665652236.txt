general 2020-07-03 15:49:49 <:what:644996672048463942>
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 15:52:30 good luck
general 2020-07-03 17:54:57 no
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 17:57:05 force is not "caused" by the acceleration sorry
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 17:58:02 sorry
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 17:58:20 and force is not caused by acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 17:58:36 the force causes acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 17:58:38 sorry
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:00:29 s-o-r-r-y
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:01:20 yes and it doesn't mean that force is "caused" by acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:01:54 it's the acceleration of a body that's caused from the resultant of forces applied
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:02:09 s-o-r-r-y
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:02:43 the final force is the resultant
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:03:13 and it's the force that causes acceleration not the opposite
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:04:23 you said the force is caused by acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:04:37 which is the  opposite of what i said
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:05:08 A force applied to a body causes acceleration. The force is not caused by the acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:05:42 oh my god
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:06:11 I study aerospace engineering at university, I think I know physics
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:06:36 it doesn't have force
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:06:44 it has kinetic energy
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:07:09 the force is what you apply to make it accelerate
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:07:14 and it gains kinetic energy
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:07:22 This is a formula
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:07:34 It doesn't mean that F is "caused" by a
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:08:09 it doesn't
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:08:24 can you read what I said
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:08:49 The force is what makes the body reach that speed
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:09:46 Because that formula explains how acceleration is compared to mass and force applied
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:09:55 F = a*m
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:10:00 a = F/m
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:10:59 you don't understand
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:11:24 A rocket going at 100000m/s without any acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:11:49 If it's not accelerating, just going at that high speed, the resultant of the forces on it is 0
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:12:04 It's the kinetic energy that is high, not the "force"
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 18:13:16 F = a*m , F is the amount of force you need to apply to a body with m mass to accelerate it at a acceleration
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:03:23 that's another thing
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:03:37 the blade doesn't have a "force"
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:03:41 it applies a force
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:04:15 Which is not a force
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:05:03 I never said you don't
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:05:25 I corrected him on the fact that "force is caused by acceleration"
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:05:50 I repeat, I study aerospace engineering, I think I know physics already
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:06:44 lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:07:19 A force applied to a body causes acceleration, yes, what's wrong
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:10:14 lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:11:01 what black
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:11:52 Photons do have momentum

plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:25:14 It doesn't look hard tho
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:27:02 I come from c, c++ and java so I'm used to this
plane-crazy 2020-07-03 19:27:29 The only language I use where you don't need to define types is kotlin
