help 2022-08-25 13:02:43 even when I find a good symbol that ROBLOX actually recognises, the filter system hashes it out

help 2022-08-26 18:05:19 The whole wing is moving????????
help 2022-08-26 18:05:46 yh why u motor locking that?
help 2022-08-26 18:06:19 just hide more wing panels into the fuselage using the main motor lock
help 2022-08-26 18:07:06 **make more**
help 2022-08-26 18:08:31 can I ask what jet r u building? a euro fighter?
help 2022-08-26 18:08:50 ah
creations-chat 2022-08-26 19:31:20 wdym with the engines?
And ik it hasnt got the streamline, the only size that would work would be to use text shapes that constantly get filtered out cuz Roblox text filter system sucks ass
creations-chat 2022-08-26 19:38:04 Yh thats the plan, Im also gonna see if I can fit a throttle lever
creations-chat 2022-08-26 19:40:06 yh, it would require a lot more motor locking, but It would definitely be a sick feature to add
creations-chat 2022-08-26 19:43:34 I see this now. The model I have been referencing to on sketchfab made it seem more seperated

Comparing my old one to my updated version, is it any better?
help 2022-08-27 17:23:26 Anyone got a copy paste of like a filled line / rectangle that doesnt get filtered by ROBLOX?
help 2022-08-27 17:35:59 Roblox recognises them, but the filter stops them no matter what
help 2022-08-27 17:40:21 Yh Ive seen this vid, they are helpful for bypassing the filter, but it doesnt work on any of the square/rectangle text stickers that roblox recognises. Im tryna make the streamline for the topgun f18, but I think something like the base of control surfaces might have to do.
creations-chat 2022-08-27 17:44:06 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1013133194238906468 The model is very well designed, and overall is pretty good, but the one thing u need to do is work on the tail. The motors are a bit of a mess
help 2022-08-27 18:43:45 trails would be too thin for the streamline, considering its roscale

help 2022-08-28 16:24:42 as in what block should I use for the streamline?
help 2022-08-28 16:25:09 cuz trails are too thin
help 2022-08-28 16:25:30 but signs are too **T H I C C**
help 2022-08-28 16:31:15 yh but they are wings, so they will stick out, and make them look bad
help 2022-08-28 16:31:36 I want to be able to use text symbols, but roblox just filters everything out
help 2022-08-28 16:32:54 Yh thats not a bad shout. The only slight issue would be the small spacing between each sign

plane-crazy 2022-10-01 19:04:25 yh I figured roshade only makes games that use the most modern roblox studio graphics look good, not ones where creators cba to insert singular objects into the game that make it a billion times better.

bug-reports 2022-10-10 01:06:45 you need to paint the behind, or hold down the mouse then hover over the text box

plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:04:16 Are u trying to hit fast targets?
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:04:30 cuz there is the delay between the client and server
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:04:50 cuz spawn invunerability
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:05:05 and blast radius isnt THAT big
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:05:51 yh, remember spawn invulnerability, and server delay
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:07:28 server delay
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:07:44 if u have on impact
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:08:51 server delay
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:08:59 dont know how many times I have to say that lol
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:10:31 depends on ur ping
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:12:20 The client detects impact, and the explosion occurs where the server recognises where the TNT is
plane-crazy 2022-10-12 18:12:38 so if u trigger on impact, the actual explosion is a bit behind
