help 2022-03-19 20:04:38 do i need to make this longer?
help 2022-03-19 20:05:21 thats what i was thinking
plane-crazy 2022-03-24 23:02:34 lol
help 2022-03-29 17:17:16 Any advice as to how I should proceed with the back of the F-16 intake? (Not doing engine yet)
help 2022-03-29 17:32:22 thanks
help 2022-03-29 17:33:10 I just added the start of the nose but sure
help 2022-03-29 17:34:06 
help 2022-03-29 17:35:45 depends on what you like to build: planes, cars, tanks?
help 2022-03-29 17:36:51 ran into a problem with the round wedge out
help 2022-03-29 17:37:29 sure i can just lock it down but then it would cover the half wedge down
help 2022-03-29 17:38:58 like this?
help 2022-03-29 17:39:17 looks better now
help 2022-03-29 17:40:59 the problem is that it would be too complicated to shrink it with the size of the nose and engine. Plus, I also need to keep in mind the structure
help 2022-03-29 17:41:16 im trying to make it as well scaled as possible
help 2022-03-29 17:41:41 bruh im not making an F14
help 2022-03-29 17:42:29 make a modern fighter jet like F-22 or F-35
help 2022-03-29 17:43:51 should i try and make realistic gears too
help 2022-03-29 17:45:31 brb
help 2022-03-29 17:47:41 I guess it mostly depends on the effort you put into the build because the more effort you put in the better the outcome
help 2022-03-29 17:50:00 <@!743627789688766486> see why i dont want to change the size
help 2022-03-29 17:51:24 interior is gonna be a whole different ballgame
help 2022-03-29 17:51:47 just wait for the weird sounds to start when you spawn in
help 2022-03-30 22:02:50 yes
help 2022-03-30 22:03:06 you can also use motorlock to compact it if needed
help 2022-03-30 22:04:02 it depends on the scale he's building at
help 2022-03-30 22:05:30 if its smaller, you could use trapdoors but if its a larger scaled build i would recommend motorlocking blocks or half blocks
help 2022-03-30 22:07:00 try and build a track that has something that can extend while its moving on it
help 2022-03-30 22:07:25 or to keep it simpler, you can just use a bunch of pistons

help 2022-03-30 22:10:30 you can use conveyors but it might be a little harder
help 2022-03-30 22:10:56 i'll send a screenshot of an example
help 2022-03-30 22:12:06 conveyors would be good for the track option
help 2022-03-30 22:13:46 something like this maybe
help 2022-03-30 22:15:47 send an example im confused
