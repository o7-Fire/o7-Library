contest-chat 2022-04-18 14:26:55 <@683847069890510887>  I was cropping the images and thats how they turned out, I will need to find a better way to change them.
contest-chat 2022-04-18 14:34:14 If Pc2 ever comes out I do hope they add very deep oceans, to the point where it is completely black at the sea bed in some parts..
contest-chat 2022-04-19 09:25:01 It appears people do not like the builds that are not custom
creations-chat 2022-04-19 10:33:46 People should make more ocean liners
creations-chat 2022-04-19 10:35:30 If plots were larger , It would allow  a lot  more people to build liners
contest-chat 2022-04-19 10:42:18 It doesn't look like the Egg rocket is even able to move!
