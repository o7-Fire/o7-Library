creations-chat 2021-12-15 23:01:50 Why do people downvote creations so much?
creations-chat 2021-12-15 23:07:21 Why u gotta hate me so much? Why you gotta be so toxic? It was my first submarine anyway, if your gonna talk trash, why don't you guide me on how to make it better?
creations-chat 2021-12-15 23:10:35 Well I mean, this server is just so damn toxic that they gotta bring down people trying to get better at the game.
creations-chat 2021-12-15 23:14:48 Or perhaps maybe you could offer to help me make the build better? Instead of shaming me?
creations-chat 2021-12-15 23:17:54 How about we all start over and never talk about this ever again? I feel like im about to be known and hated by the entire community and I don't want that. I just want to learn to get better at the game. I am down in the dumps today okay? Had a long ass day.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:09:41 FACT: 75% of people that downvote creations most likely do it in an act of jealousy. (Go ahead and criticize me for it, you and I both know it's true.)
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:12:52 Heh, even you know it's true.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:15:50 Well considering tiktok has done many bad things to this world im going to have to agree on this one.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:19:20 still though, A lot of the downvoted creations I see are not that bad to me. Considering that some people dont know how to motorlock which is basically shaming them for it.

general 2021-12-18 23:10:50 
creations-chat 2021-12-18 23:14:06 Ok let's all be real here. Who actually uses stairs in creations? (Buildings don't count.)
creations-chat 2021-12-20 14:29:24 <@!521855442608193537>  The only problem with your suggestion is that you are basically rushing rickje to finish PC2. You have to give him some time to make it perfect. If he releases it too early, major bugs could occur, it is possible we could lose creations/data. which is why it's good to wait until the game is ready to play without it being unstable.
creations-chat 2021-12-20 14:31:32 He could do that, but like I said. There could be major bugs that may occur that could possibly wipe creations/data. Anything can happen. So it's good to let him finish up. The plane crazy we have is good as it is for now.
creations-chat 2021-12-20 14:35:26 I agree. It would make me much more hype for the release if he showed progress, but maybe he is staying silent for a reason. Maybe he doesnt want us to see what the game is really like yet
general 2021-12-29 22:33:30 Ya know, boats must be a certain shape in order to float right. Submarines also count as shipright. it's not just boats. This effects the real world too.
general 2021-12-29 22:48:01 bruh why did my game not autosave after going idle i just lost so much damn progress
general 2021-12-29 23:06:56 Am I bad for upvoting mass downvoted creations to try and make somebody feel better about getting downvoted if they felt kind of bad about it?
general 2021-12-29 23:08:14 I don't really downvote creations anyway. I personally do not think there are any bad creations as long as the person who created it tried.
general 2021-12-29 23:08:41 lol
general 2021-12-29 23:09:31 Exactly. If the person at least tried to build something, I give an upvote.
general 2021-12-29 23:10:20 There are no truly bad creations. If you try to make something, I give an upvote (Unless you tried to make a troll or NSFW creation.)
general 2021-12-29 23:12:05 I have seen a NSFW build, it had the no no very bad word (N.) And made fun of LGBTQ+
general 2021-12-29 23:12:22 Yep.
general 2021-12-29 23:13:44 imagine flexing lol
the-dump 2021-12-29 23:14:57 
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 20:21:59 i think rickje is adding better autosaving to PC2. lol
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 20:25:57 lol good ðŸ—¿
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 20:26:33 all i gotta say about this
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 20:26:36 haha yes
general 2022-02-24 19:58:41 Moving to space engineers so uh... bye for now.
general 2022-03-11 20:38:49 Has anybody here played space engineers?
general 2022-03-11 20:40:07 I know you really liked my better auto save suggestion so has that been implemented or is being working on in PC2 yet?
general 2022-03-11 20:43:30 I have an idea, and it's similar to the game on steam Space Engineers, don't know if you heard of that or not. But small blocks. Small blocks are used for both just small builds, and extra detail to large builds, so that people who know nothing about motor locking can make much better looking builds.
general 2022-03-11 20:45:35 Ayo rickje, I haven't been keeping up with plane crazy for a while, i've been busy. But are you considering adding space to the game? Like, if you reach a certain altitude, the skybox changes to night for you or something, and when you descend, it goes back to day.
general 2022-03-11 20:46:35 everyone goes silent when a link is posted lol
general 2022-03-11 20:53:26 yes
general 2022-03-11 20:54:15 I agree
general 2022-03-11 20:54:17 I hate respawning
general 2022-03-11 20:55:22 You should add large and huge super rocket engines
general 2022-03-11 20:56:01 Didn't you also say once that shredder bugs will be nerfed?

general 2022-10-05 00:55:31 Welcome to the plane crazy community! Where decent looking planes get shit on in the creations channel! ðŸ™‚
general 2022-10-05 00:56:12 Yes but don't post it in creations unless you want to get shit on by the community
general 2022-10-05 00:56:40 but probably russian
general 2022-10-05 00:57:51 the first plane I ever made was a mess
general 2022-10-05 00:58:20 I should try to make a working artillery/mortar
bug-reports 2022-11-12 00:22:18 Incorrect.
bug-reports 2022-11-12 00:22:33 Not even sound effects work.
bug-reports 2022-11-12 00:22:55 I tried to use a minigun sound effect which is on sale in the library and it doesn't play any more.
bug-reports 2022-11-12 00:24:08 BUG REPORT: Camera no longer looks through parts when deploying your vehicle
bug-reports 2022-11-12 00:24:32 This makes it impossible to view in third person if your plane or vehicle is enclosed without transparent parts
bug-reports 2022-11-12 00:25:17 I feel like the recent update broke a crap ton of stuff
bug-reports 2022-11-12 00:25:44 Maybe the update should just be reverted to the previous version so rickje can make some improvements
