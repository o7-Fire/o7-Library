plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:47:21 Is anyone else having their symmetrical creations lean to the right for no reason?
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:47:51 No propellor
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:48:38 
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:48:46 This also happened with a car
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:48:53 Which was also symmetrical
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:49:27 Yup
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:50:02 No ballast, all normal bricks
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:50:06 blocks*
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:51:50 this simple car has the same behaviour, but instead leans to the left
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:52:25 Wait, is it possible that my hats are not symmetrical and somehow one side is heavier?
plane-crazy 2019-03-22 21:54:12 Going bald didn't fix it, I smell a mystery
creations-chat 2019-08-14 10:28:09 Does my submarine have to look like a submarine for me to qualify for the submarine commander?
creations-chat 2019-08-14 10:28:21 I turned my taco truck into a functioning submarine
creations-chat 2019-08-14 11:32:15 !
creations-chat 2019-08-14 11:34:10 mine can be any food truck, but i'd like to think it's a taco truck
creations-chat 2019-08-14 11:39:58 heat seeking delivery
creations-chat 2019-08-14 11:40:44 it's also a functioning submarine but i'm not sure how to show that in an image
