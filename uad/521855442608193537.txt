plane-crazy 2021-04-08 02:40:37 Yep that's my helicarrier
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 02:41:00 It kinda is tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 02:41:29 Thanks
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 02:42:51 oh wait I just realized
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 02:43:01 you can't see the guns on the carrier
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 02:43:25 aaand I can't post images
bot-central 2021-04-08 02:45:35 !rank
bot-central 2021-04-08 02:45:40 oh
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 02:46:13 I used every single gun, rocket, and firework launcher
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 02:46:53 yes
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 02:59:40 trains are useless on it tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 02:59:53 the tracks are all in 1 corner
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 03:00:11 trains are limited to novelty items
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 03:00:26 you can't run like a transport system with them
bot-central 2021-04-08 03:11:39 !rank
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 03:17:05 yeah having smoke pipes be like trails with the on/off or hold mode would be great
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 13:22:13 nice
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 13:22:58 have you considered using signs to create a crosshair?

plane-crazy 2021-04-08 13:26:42 oh
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 13:26:50 So did I apparently
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 13:28:42 oh
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 13:28:45 advanced sonar
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 13:28:57 yeah i saw
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 13:29:38 on the bright side nobody will ever have trouble getting on your ship
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 13:30:12 oh that's smart actually
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 13:31:31 He motorlocked a block to hide the gun he knows how to motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 13:32:05 what is that heli tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 13:32:22 looks like it was carved out of a tree trunk

the-dump 2021-04-08 13:38:56 yeah
the-dump 2021-04-08 13:39:02 great shape tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 13:39:17 hm yes flying arrowhead
help 2021-04-08 13:40:35 Hmm
I guess you could search on google, but getting a lot of pictures with different angles should help you get an idea of the exact shape
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 13:41:59 what does it look like from other angles tho
general 2021-04-08 13:42:44 Pop cat has animevirus?
general 2021-04-08 13:42:44 Pop cat has animevirus?
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 13:42:54 ok yeah

help 2021-04-08 14:01:32 attach is right
help 2021-04-08 14:02:52 I don;t think that's the issue here but reducing torque on motors does help with jitteriness sometimes
creations-chat 2021-04-08 14:04:41 <@!761850987714445344> how many hours do you have in plane crazy?
creations-chat 2021-04-08 14:09:23 Ah, not too much experience, but some. I would consider using wedges and more advanced design tricks
creations-chat 2021-04-08 14:12:00 I should point out that all of you who are insulting it so bad should have some respect for the fact that an inexperienced player felt confident enough to post his build
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:13:17 Minimalism does have its place though
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:15:31 Codename I would reccomend using reference images
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:15:58 It is infinitely harder to build something that exists from memory than with a reference
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:16:27 That is an important skill to learn
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:16:32 look up some tutorials for it
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:17:03 As a learning method, not a crutch
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:17:34 Tutorials teach you skills that you can then use on your own builds
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:18:34 It's obvious that making tutorial builds and keeping them is not a good idea
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:18:54 yes and it's sad
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:19:52 like I said in <#478584971670454284>, reference ***models*** are a way better tool than images, though
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:20:22 It's how I made my helicarrier accurate
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:21:27 It;s also really good to use a physical model if you have it, though that is harder to come by
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:29:33 but that
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:29:37 why tho
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:29:51 that defeats the entire purpose
general 2021-04-08 14:29:58 F
general 2021-04-08 14:29:58 F
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:30:13 custom?
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:31:31 I know what you mean
How do you make your custom ones?
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:34:06 oh you meant plane propellers
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:34:09 wait
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:36:03 ah
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:36:13 why the cameras tho?
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:37:09 oh
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:37:40 I would assume that just using a motor to power the propeller would be more effective and easier
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:37:52 ohhhhhh
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:38:07 true
plane-crazy 2021-04-08 14:39:23 Yeah

plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:12:12 What issues?
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:13:56 sliding can be fixed by making some blocks that contact ground fabric material, and motor wobble is a by-product of high torque i think
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:14:39 Hm
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:14:46 What is the strength at?
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:15:45 Try setting it higher
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:15:56 see if it improves at all
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:17:21 Is the wobble less severe now?
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:17:38 oof
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 14:17:59 I can't actually, I'm in class rn

plane-crazy 2021-04-09 15:02:23 the green stripe is a bit too thick but that's it i think
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 15:11:01 Ngl that's some skilled pixel art
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 15:12:01 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 15:12:49 Wait
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 15:13:06 Save it then turn to glass
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 15:13:15 Then restore the original
plane-crazy 2021-04-09 15:13:17 Yeah
creations-chat 2021-04-09 17:46:54 That heli looks quite good. I might make the colors more muted but that's just me
creations-chat 2021-04-09 17:48:57 Oh i meant like make the red and green values higher or bring the blue value down a bit.
general 2021-04-09 17:56:12 Need air support for that apc?
general 2021-04-09 17:58:09 who needs armor when you can just shred their weapons

plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:01:54 do it it's a cool build
plane-crazy 2021-08-26 17:02:12 the downvotes are mostly trolls anyway

help 2021-08-26 17:25:27 actually that reminds me
help 2021-08-26 17:25:44 there's a cool technique you can use to make removable motor lock
help 2021-08-26 17:26:29 oop my bad
help 2021-08-26 17:26:32 i meant folding lol
help 2021-08-26 17:27:42 basically if you attach the  fold struts to the build with disconnectors, you can then use magnets to weld the pieces together and then remove the folding motor
help 2021-08-26 17:28:07 it only works if you use a motor 2 tho
help 2021-08-26 17:28:19 and the magnets gotta have a range under 15
help 2021-08-26 17:28:46 A friend taught me it
help 2021-08-26 17:28:58 it's not common knowledge as far as i know

help 2021-08-27 12:28:43 I have a question about the general requirements for aeronautical engineer rank
help 2021-08-27 12:30:27 For the requirements "plane cannot use helium" and "all block's must be attached to the plane", what are the exceptions to that?
help 2021-08-27 12:31:34 Cuz I have a plane that uses some helium and disconnectors for its angle locked setup and I'm wondering if that makes it invalid?
creations-chat 2021-08-27 15:29:04 Where?
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 16:26:58 Wdym by no lock
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 16:27:40 Why tf would you not use motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 16:28:23 Rule 3 is worded badly then
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 16:28:44 The only way to interpret it is "don't use motor lock"
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 16:29:24 Phrase it that way then
plane-crazy 2021-08-27 16:29:37 Not "no motor lock, it sucks"
general 2021-08-27 16:35:52 i wanna do something like that for an actual plane now
general 2021-08-27 16:36:30 not for a big plane
help 2021-08-28 15:20:39 Idk what to build but I really want to right now. Any ideas?

general 2021-08-31 16:56:47 ye
plane-crazy 2021-08-31 16:59:48 make the motor very slow so you can fine tune it or place some removable blocks to limit it's angle
general 2021-08-31 17:01:56 yeah
general 2021-08-31 17:03:25 where stock
general 2021-08-31 17:03:47 put the stock back

general 2021-09-16 18:41:25 nope
general 2021-09-16 18:41:43 american education would like you to think that though
general 2021-09-16 18:41:59 to test knowledge given in the lesson
general 2021-09-16 18:42:14 a test without a lesson isn't teaching
general 2021-09-16 18:42:48 ok then take a class that has no bookwork or homework or lectures, only tests
general 2021-09-16 18:42:58 and tell me how much you actually learn from it

because cronch
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 13:37:19 It's a very difficult thing to teach
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 13:38:08 No
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 13:38:12 And you shouldn't
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 13:38:29 It defeats the point of the game
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 13:39:17 Sadly no
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 13:39:25 There's no co-op building
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 13:39:32 Your best bet for becoming skilled is to just play and become familiar with the techniques of building
plane-crazy 2021-09-23 13:40:03 Like all great things it takes time and experience
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:38:25 i think people motorlock half wedges from the half blocks category in
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:38:51 eh
plane-crazy 2021-09-24 12:39:01 ok true that
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 16:58:30 i would imagine that using flares or something like that might help
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 16:58:40 anything you can throw at the rocket to confuse it should work
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 17:01:51 If you're moving fast with a rocket chasing you, i think that activating a parachute and disconnecting it from the build would work great
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 17:02:25 with a large parachute it might even confuse mouse-guided missiles
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 17:03:19 hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 17:04:52 i would say either more debris or try using a shield of some sort
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 17:05:14 wait do rockets collide with the actual parachute from a parachute block?
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 17:05:49 if they do then max size parachutes are an instant barrier

general 2021-09-28 18:43:44 honestly a meh nose is forgivable given the quality of the rest of the build
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 18:44:09 depends on what kind of landing gear you're basing it off of
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 18:45:00 ok that might work well then
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 18:45:40 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-09-28 18:45:56 that type of gear will work tho

general 2021-09-30 18:00:51 i mean, dragon ball is the anime equivalent of kids making up stronger powers to try to beat each other
jjba is extremely loosesly defined in what you can and can't do
general 2021-09-30 18:03:46 true but they get really OP and can be inconsistent as hecc
general 2021-09-30 18:04:52 point taken
general 2021-09-30 18:05:07 still though, the limitations are really unclear
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 12:57:24 do you want an honest answer or a nice one?
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 12:58:31 That kind of car is the exact type of thing that new players build when they don't know any build techniques or design methods, and think that the only thing that's important is going fast
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:00:00 You seem like a person who is not braindead unlike most children on roblox, so I'd recommend looking up stuff like how to motorlock and plane crazy design tips
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:00:41 understandable
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:00:50 oof
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:01:56 So if you take a motor and go into it's settings, you'll see an option called "lock"
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:02:30 if you enable that, when you spawn the motor goes from this <:Motor:559531201237352451>   to this <:IntendedFeature:706289545548660746>
plane-crazy 2021-10-01 13:03:51 it seems like a stupid feature until you realize that it allows you to make multiple blocks occupy the same space.
This allows you to create advanced designs that aren't possible otherwise

general 2021-10-08 16:31:16 if you're talking grades, 85 is a B
general 2021-10-08 16:32:05 ask your teacher about it
general 2021-10-08 16:32:09 or the school idk
general 2021-10-08 16:32:36 but if you're operating on a 0-100 percentage of points scale then 85% is a B
general 2021-10-08 16:33:11 1 sec
general 2021-10-08 16:34:37 actually wait, according to wikipedia's entry on Indonesian grading scale, 83.25% is the lower end of B+.
You should have a B+
general 2021-10-08 16:36:14 yeah bro your grade is getting oofed pretty bad
general 2021-10-08 16:36:53 50%-58.25% is C grade range for you
general 2021-10-08 16:37:11 you should actually talk with your school about that
general 2021-10-08 16:37:31 90 is a high B+
general 2021-10-08 16:37:37 a little below A-
general 2021-10-08 16:38:36 i would guess fabric cuz it's the lightest

plane-crazy 2021-10-18 16:49:49 ah
general 2021-10-18 16:50:43 unde means underage
general 2021-10-18 16:53:07 you gotta be at least 13 to be on discord
general 2021-10-18 16:53:08 it's the TOS
general 2021-10-18 16:58:36 ay man don't disrespect bombs like that
general 2021-10-18 16:59:39 explode on impact works, you just flinging them too fast
general 2021-10-18 17:00:29 gotta focus on flying after i drop them, best to let them deal with themselves
general 2021-10-18 17:00:51 i precision bomb at over 300 sps and it works perfectly
general 2021-10-18 17:01:05 and i dont have a good pc at all
general 2021-10-18 17:01:31 i didn't say cannon
general 2021-10-18 17:02:25 thats just a bowling machine then
general 2021-10-18 17:03:33 ah
general 2021-10-18 17:04:00 there are still better ways of delivering explosive blocks and balls
general 2021-10-18 17:05:46 idk what ignore self does exactly
general 2021-10-18 17:07:05 if you really want you could make shells for your cannon
general 2021-10-18 17:07:42 self propelled shells probably won't explode inside the barrel or come out way too slow
general 2021-10-18 17:08:14 alternatively just arm your explosive while it's in flight
general 2021-10-18 17:10:36 yes explosion is art
general 2021-10-18 17:11:26 tbh if you want the most out of a cannon then use shells 
because you can customize the payload
general 2021-10-18 17:11:59 what if 
cannon + max weight motorlocked ballast block rod
general 2021-10-18 17:12:11 you get bonk machine
general 2021-10-18 17:13:44 slow
general 2021-10-18 17:13:54 missiles way too slow
general 2021-10-18 17:14:32 wait does that actually work?
general 2021-10-18 17:14:54 so like, if its spinning then it'll go fast?
general 2021-10-18 17:15:15 i gotta try that then
general 2021-10-18 17:15:41 bruh
general 2021-10-18 17:16:29 oh i was thinking just put a motor at the back
general 2021-10-18 17:17:15 yeah
general 2021-10-18 17:17:20 hv cannons?
general 2021-10-18 17:17:35 ah
general 2021-10-18 17:18:00 sus
general 2021-10-18 17:18:51 kinda like how spinning a cutter makes it act really powerful
general 2021-10-18 17:31:52 hecc
general 2021-10-18 17:32:12 rickje why
general 2021-10-18 17:32:21 why you patch a feature
plane-crazy 2021-10-18 17:34:22 signs are good for detail
both as  adding depth and for adding text/emoji detailing
plane-crazy 2021-10-18 17:34:41 also use trails, wing lights, other small blocks, etc to break up flat surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-10-18 17:35:13 emoji details are best used inside for controls and stuff imo
plane-crazy 2021-10-18 17:36:18 emoji details also good for wheels and stuff sometimes, as well as markings
plane-crazy 2021-10-18 17:36:32 your choice
general 2021-10-18 17:50:56 what if no

plane-crazy 2021-10-21 15:45:28 oh i thought there were bow and stern thrusters
general 2021-10-21 15:47:20 no
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 15:51:25 you should at least post a picture of it spawned too, and shipwright refers to watercraft
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 15:51:46 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 15:52:31 depends on the builds too
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 15:58:28 Sure but what's the suggestion you want

general 2021-10-21 16:49:39 yeah
general 2021-10-21 16:50:30 you have to factor in way too much for air pvp with guns to be practical
general 2021-10-21 16:53:48 i think that spinning the rocket doesn't add forward speed to it anymore
general 2021-10-21 16:54:15 oh wait i misread
general 2021-10-21 16:55:10 imagine scam link
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 17:07:52 yeah

general 2021-10-21 17:08:45 vpn cost money tho
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 17:09:41 tbh the elitism here probably drives a way a ton of new or undeveloped talent
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 17:12:16 what sucks is when you have a well-made plane that exists but you made on your own and people think it's a tutorial build because a tutorial exists for that type of plane
plane-crazy 2021-10-21 17:13:46 yeah
general 2021-10-21 17:17:32 no

bot-central 2021-10-22 11:56:44 -ms
creations-chat 2021-10-22 13:27:43 my only suggestions are change the rocket colors and maybe repaint the camo
creations-chat 2021-10-22 13:31:48 yeah understandable
if you want to spice up the color scheme a bit I would look through creations for planes with good camo and note the techniques they use

your choice though, the green paint does look pretty good as is
general 2021-10-22 13:33:21 nice
general 2021-10-22 13:37:18 f
general 2021-10-22 13:39:26 iirc you can use motors like normal while not moving
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 16:44:59 remember folks, speed means nothing if your opponent is moremaneuverable
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 16:45:35 all of my aircraft top out at about 500 speed but can evade like crazy
general 2021-10-22 16:50:32 oof
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 16:55:33 fun fact, being faster than your adversary can easily be a bad thing
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 16:56:07 flying past your enemy and into their line of direct fire
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 16:56:35 me with every single gun facing forward
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 16:59:45 yep
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 17:00:06 small is also an advantage in dogfights
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 17:00:32 and low turn radius
plane-crazy 2021-10-22 17:02:18 this strikes me as the jet equivalent of a slow speed bomber

plane-crazy 2021-11-04 16:05:10 because *i* isn't real, any multiple of it is itself except if it's squared

plane-crazy 2021-11-04 17:12:49 shooting pilot while they parachute is a warcrime i think
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 17:14:10 still war crime
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 17:14:21 from wikipedia: "Attacks on parachutists, as defined by the law of war, is when pilots, aircrews, and passengers are attacked while descending by parachute from disabled aircraft during wartime. This practice is considered by most militaries around the world to be inhumane, as the attacked personnel would eventually become POWs if parachuted over enemy territory. Such parachutists are considered hors de combat under the Protocol I addition to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, meaning that attacking them is a war crime."

plane-crazy 2021-11-15 18:13:16 does plane crazy support vr?
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 18:14:13 are you 100% sure?
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 18:15:02 were you able to get roblox to work on it?
plane-crazy 2021-11-15 18:15:26 oh

general 2021-11-16 13:56:39 no it's like 8
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 13:58:59 roblox allows you to put your discord server on the game page on the website
they do support it somewhat
general 2021-11-16 13:59:27 how tf do you get berries in scp-3008
general 2021-11-16 14:02:19 ah
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 14:03:24 I play pvp and non-pvp about equally, and it'd be great if I could go into either mode directly


though having a join friend option on the menu would be epic too
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 14:04:04 the lag that happens when you join a server and everything loads
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 14:04:48 yeah but if I'm joining *just* to immediately go to pvp, I'd like to be able to not have to wait about 10 seconds for the button to be useable
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 14:05:05 ok jeff bezos
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 14:05:26 yeah but the gui buttons don't activate for a few seconds either way
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 14:06:21 we would waste less
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 14:06:58 you wouldn't have to server hop to get where you want to go
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 14:07:25 to pvp mode, to a friend's server, out of a laggy server
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 14:07:29 plenty of reasons
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 14:08:18 thats cuz you spent your college fund on a computer
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 14:08:52 I doubt that if you're saying you don't get lag
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 14:09:08 because I play on a laptop and I lag constantly
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 14:10:04 I have 8gb ram and I can't pull more than 25 fps when spawned in a public server
plane-crazy 2021-11-16 14:10:27 nope

help 2021-11-16 19:45:47 well, the motor lock tower will become a 1 block high thing
help 2021-11-16 19:46:14 which means that the space between where you connect it at the top and where you connect it at the bottom will be 1 block
help 2021-11-16 19:46:30 or the floor
help 2021-11-16 19:46:39 you just need to add 1 more layer of lock

plane-crazy 2021-11-23 13:27:43 mouse-control motor 2 for pitch and yaw would be good
probably want a keyboard-control motor or motor 2 for roll
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 13:28:23 hm
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 13:28:51 wait actually having mouse-control motor 2s for pitch and yaw, but they're set to toggle
plane-crazy 2021-11-23 13:29:40 basically, that allows you to aim it where you want and then keep it in that position
general 2021-11-30 14:09:39 flight training going well i see

plane-crazy 2021-11-30 14:11:57 what do yall use to control your motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 14:12:49 disconnector best
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 14:13:02 no glitch and always useable
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 14:13:35 you can hide the nub or remove it entirely with a little designing
plane-crazy 2021-11-30 14:15:19 if done right, you don't even have to hide anything
general 2021-11-30 14:18:10 oh i thought that was a 172
creations-chat 2021-11-30 14:23:03 what is this even

general 2021-12-03 17:25:43 If you’re concerned that the skill ceiling is going down, just post a god-tier build to raise it again

general 2021-12-03 17:48:36 idk
help 2021-12-03 17:50:26 i'm a bit more confident that it's green now
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 17:51:04 eject and use parachute while holding on to plane
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 17:57:18 160 speed is landing speed
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 17:57:21 below it, even
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 17:57:42 any slower and you'd probably fall out of the sky
plane-crazy 2021-12-03 17:57:56 exactly
general 2021-12-03 18:02:07 what is this
general 2021-12-03 18:02:22 cuz it's hurting my brain too

general 2021-12-03 19:35:24 wdym by no clip
general 2021-12-03 19:35:37 oh
general 2021-12-03 19:35:40 bruh
general 2021-12-03 19:36:02 the increment should be half a block
general 2021-12-03 19:36:12 1 block is just too large
general 2021-12-03 19:36:20 no
general 2021-12-03 19:36:51 we already have half wedges and stuff like that, and if we can't make that kind of stuff in pc2 then it'll be damn infuriating
general 2021-12-03 19:37:43 but half block sized details are very common and not possible with a 1 block increment
general 2021-12-03 19:38:50 imagine bot

creations-chat 2021-12-07 19:29:20 Hi
creations-chat 2021-12-07 19:33:31 You could consider fixing the cheese grater wings and adding a cage for the cockpit glass
plane-crazy 2021-12-07 19:34:23 first one
creations-chat 2021-12-07 19:41:50 worse builds exist

look at his rank though
we can't expect god-tier plane builds out of a shipwright 3
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:04:28 so basically
engine
but pointing up instead of forwards
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:04:38 try to balance it and boom
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:04:52 that's literally it
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:05:23 i have no doubt
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:06:15 then it's probably either not strong enough or not balanced quite enough
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:06:42 or it could be too strong ig
general 2021-12-13 13:07:58 Holy shit
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:11:32 nice
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:11:52 ballast block
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:11:56 and helium maybe?
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:12:09 ah
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:12:14 ok ballast then
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:13:18 i would put props at front, back, and wing tips if possible
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:13:22 for maximum balance
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:13:44 you could also use small hover droves for less noise and more power
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:13:50 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:14:59 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:15:13 although you could put the turning ones in your engines to hide them
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:19:15 front is too strong then
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:19:18 or back is too heavy
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:24:34 hmm
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:25:20 that would seem to indicate that the thrust isn't increasing the same relative amount at the front vs the back
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:25:40 are you by chance using different thrust sources at either end?
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:27:18 true
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:27:33 center engines could be a good method albeit difficult to pull off
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:27:41 nice
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:28:59 paint job could use a little work but otherwise pretty epic
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:29:57 ok
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:35:50 what the
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:38:49 nice
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:41:07 oof
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:45:04 When holy water isn't enough to cleanse their sins

plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:45:32 oof
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:48:49 wait hear me out on this

plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:51:52 oh

plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:52:19 torch it
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:52:31 incredibly
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:54:35 that avatar is a mess
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:54:39 a free item mess
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 13:54:58 he needs a whole ass redo
general 2021-12-13 13:59:13 make the Bartini A-57
general 2021-12-13 13:59:48 a giant nuclear powered submarine with parasite fighter might
general 2021-12-13 14:01:09 ok then how about a player-scale fully detailed UD-4 Cheyenne Dropship
general 2021-12-13 14:01:55 you could also make a CL-1201
general 2021-12-13 14:02:32 i mean kinda but also no
general 2021-12-13 14:02:53 cuz it doesn't launch drones it launches up to 22 f-4 phantoms
general 2021-12-13 14:03:23 it could also carry up to 6,900 troops
general 2021-12-13 14:03:46 and was 1,120 feet wide
general 2021-12-13 14:04:20 oof
general 2021-12-13 14:04:32 damn now I wanna make the cl-1201
general 2021-12-13 14:04:58 one plot, player scale
general 2021-12-13 14:05:06 ima try it after school
general 2021-12-13 14:05:16 may the folding gods be in my favor
general 2021-12-13 14:05:46 also quick question for everyone
general 2021-12-13 14:06:03 when making life-size builds, how big do you consider a single block to be?
general 2021-12-13 14:06:16 personally I use 1 block = 1 cubic meter
general 2021-12-13 14:06:28 it will
general 2021-12-13 14:06:53 also if I succeed in making it you can be damn sure that it WILL fly
general 2021-12-13 14:07:33 I am not one to make a plane and then just not make it fly
general 2021-12-13 14:08:39 i think I will give it all 22 f-4s tho
general 2021-12-13 14:10:27 any new blocks?
general 2021-12-13 14:10:32 or just same old winter event
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 14:11:24 "probably"
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 14:11:38 don't get your hopes up people

plane-crazy 2021-12-13 16:28:12 Sometimes people are just idiots. Don’t let idiots decide how good your build is
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 16:30:27 I think someone called my very obvious b25 an a10 before
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 17:06:08 Yo how big are the plots?
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 17:08:16 I legitimately can’t remember and I can’t access the game right now
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 17:21:02 Thanks
help 2021-12-13 19:01:59 Can I get a little logistical help with planning a build?
help 2021-12-13 19:04:33 so I'm trying to figure out how to make the Lockheed CL-1201 at player scale in the game and, with plots being 51 x 51 x 39
The plane would be 341 blocks wide, 171 blocks long, and the wings are about 4 blocks thick on average
help 2021-12-13 19:04:46 How can I fit this on to a single plot?
help 2021-12-13 19:05:01 Literally any ideas that are helpful are welcome
help 2021-12-13 19:06:00 (sidenote: Rickje please give us larger plots)
help 2021-12-13 19:10:51 yeah I've used a diluted form of that before
help 2021-12-13 19:11:24 ~~watch me~~
help 2021-12-13 19:11:52 im thinking the wings could be on the top and bottom of the plot in order to maximize use of the 51x51 space
help 2021-12-13 19:12:04 and I can kinda squeeze the fuselage in there between them
help 2021-12-13 19:13:06 I might have to break out the dark arts to make this tbh
help 2021-12-13 19:13:20 but by god I am going to try
help 2021-12-13 19:13:30 and I am going to get a 7 plot wide plane
help 2021-12-13 19:13:59 I might actually sacrifice some wing thickness in order to fit the rest
help 2021-12-13 19:14:16 im sure people will understand
help 2021-12-13 19:15:00 I have an angle of attack for this project now
help 2021-12-13 19:15:08 Thanks kokamzy
general 2021-12-13 19:22:51 wait am I allowed to ask one or two burning questions about pc2?
general 2021-12-13 19:23:07 hecc
general 2021-12-13 19:23:30 no im not stupid
general 2021-12-13 19:24:08 but i wanted to know if we'd be getting larger plots and if the resize tool would go in half block or full block increments
general 2021-12-13 19:25:11 im really hoping the resize tool is half block increments because well obviously
general 2021-12-13 19:25:56 quarter would be cool but might be a tad too much
A bit like the discussion of half and quarter blocks for minecraft
general 2021-12-13 19:26:32 which was basically like 'if we give you half blocks in all orientations, you'll want quarter next then eights then sixteenths and so on'
help 2021-12-13 19:27:22 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 19:34:57 tbh noob avatars are kinda endearing actually
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 19:35:21 like you know they know what they're doing and they usually aren't super rude or anything

plane-crazy 2021-12-13 19:40:41 exactly
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 19:42:06 no it's everyone
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 19:42:45 to clarify, just because I say noob avatar people are super chill doesn't mean they're the only ones who are chill
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 19:43:02 similar to how all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares
creations-chat 2021-12-13 19:43:21 I think so yes

more experienced players might disagree tho so be ready
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 19:47:50 
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 19:51:26 Nice
general 2021-12-13 19:52:06 Yea
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:29:51 so the CL-1201 Im making
I have an outline for the wings so far
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:29:53 
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:30:31 the Lockheed CL-1201
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:30:51 the largest plane ever designed
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:31:00 wingspan 341 meters
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 21:41:52 supposed to be yeah
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 22:10:59 yes I know
plane-crazy 2021-12-13 22:11:16 I have the measurements and I'm trying to use them for making it the right size
help 2021-12-13 22:31:35 oh my bad
help 2021-12-13 22:31:46 still gonna build it tho
help 2021-12-14 13:25:04 wait if it's about that big then I think it might be more possible than I originally thought
help 2021-12-14 13:25:21 because people make carriers like that all the time
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 13:36:10 what's the point if it won't fly
plane-crazy 2021-12-14 13:36:42 yeah
help 2021-12-14 15:38:49 my thinking is that if someone can fit an entire aircraft carrier into a plot, then I can manage a plane
help 2021-12-14 15:39:15 We have no recent updates because Rick is really busy making plane crazy 2
general 2021-12-14 16:02:31 probably not
general 2021-12-14 16:03:32 is it really tho?
general 2021-12-14 16:03:39 how so
general 2021-12-14 16:04:10 i mean thats just taxes
general 2021-12-14 16:06:18 ok but uh, does canada have widespread obesity,
semi-regular mass shootings
systematic police brutality
etc?
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 19:28:02 it's hars
you can take his opinion with a grain of salt because the only builds he likes are his own
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 19:28:37 ok then you are even more consistent than I thought
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 19:31:32 i would say it's more that he just criticises builds whenever he speaks
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 19:32:17 criticizing people isn't a life mate
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 19:33:35 i mean i suppose it is a job but not in this particular instance
creations-chat 2021-12-15 19:40:29 can it fly?

good

it's perfect then
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 19:42:29 oof

creations-chat 2021-12-15 19:53:53 Yes shredder bad

Y’all just don’t have an appreciation for art
creations-chat 2021-12-15 19:56:56 I doubt any of you have even played terraria

Yep you haven’t

Also minecraft and terraria are barely comparable games. One is adventure like dnd and the other is sandbox survival
plane-crazy 2021-12-15 20:01:32 Same as usual
plane-crazy 2021-12-16 16:20:03 That would be very epic
creations-chat 2021-12-18 19:44:24 Yeah it looks great

bot-central 2021-12-20 14:09:58 ?shelp
creations-chat 2021-12-20 14:30:39 The reason I detailed it extensively is so that it isn't forcing him to rush. 
Essentially what I'm saying is to release what already exists, then continue to work on it afterwards, perhaps even at a less stressful rate

I want to make it clear that I in no way want to rush Rick, and I understand he's a busy man. My suggestions is what I see as the best possible compromise, preserving rick's ability to work on the game at a less stressful speed while letting everyone get the one thing we all want so desperately
general 2021-12-20 14:43:51 I suppose, but then again no man’s sky was paid iirc, but pc isn’t
general 2021-12-20 14:45:01 Maybe, but also read my whole suggestion
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 16:12:57 Ah yes the really loud plane
plane-crazy 2021-12-20 16:19:38 Yes

plane-crazy 2021-12-20 18:10:39 makes it bad
bug-reports 2021-12-21 16:49:23 They only glitch like that in certain positions 
If you rotate so the arrow points sideways it should save correctly
creations-chat 2021-12-29 21:17:02 Ok so ik im a tad biased in this but what is wrong with my me-262 for it to get that many downvotes

it really isn't blocky tho. I used more wedges than blocks
creations-chat 2021-12-29 21:19:25 What's up with them
help 2021-12-30 17:36:58 Does anyone know a good way to make a stable 5-bladed rotor?

Cuz i know you just like hating on peoples builds for bs reasons

<@!918581321004089364> ikr
creations-chat 2022-04-05 16:31:51 To be completely honest, pcc needs to learn how to properly give constructive criticism and feedback instead of insults

Myself included, though I do try my best


<@!719168864705052802> I’ll do that after you meet your own standards for a build
creations-chat 2022-04-05 16:35:59 I do read, and you just made my point

Cuz your standards are quite literally unmeetable, even by you

help 2022-05-19 18:07:42 you could use text signs to make the extra stuff mostly invisible, but other than that you'd just have to redesign the fold so its smaller

help 2022-08-14 04:43:21 I'm making an Arsenal Bird and I need an engine that will work for it.

Hover drives are too weak unless I use a lot, then they become too laggy

Conveyor drives make it flip out no matter what.

What do I do?
help 2022-08-14 05:07:48 i believe i had about 18-20 full hover drives in order to get 115 speed on the meter
help 2022-08-14 05:09:11 thanks
help 2022-08-14 05:20:55 so turns out i was stupid and forgot that the propellers cause a lot of drag unless angled

general 2022-08-23 23:00:46 The bowser has fun building techniques i hear
general 2022-08-23 23:02:28 Get gunship, start saving for bowser
general 2022-08-23 23:03:14 The stand doesn’t really support the f14 its that big
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 23:08:14 All I’ve heard so far is that there’ll be an infinite ocean
plane-crazy 2022-08-23 23:09:23 You could probably search for posts from Rickje in the search bar to find more info
creations-chat 2022-08-23 23:12:10 There’s a video on YT that shows how to get that exact effect

https://youtu.be/lLB9Fza-qd0
creations-chat 2022-08-24 12:42:18 Yeah that’s fairly accurate
bug-reports 2022-08-26 13:46:07 Im pretty sure this means your actual color is 4,4,153
The color numbers loop back around after 255 iirc
help 2022-10-07 13:41:57 Try adding helium to the weapon to cancel out its weight
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 22:57:19 Let us play pvp dammit
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 23:06:43 Nope
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 23:06:52 I keep getting kicked for an update
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 23:07:28 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-11-08 23:07:32 How
bug-reports 2022-12-05 16:25:54 That actually happens based on when a player joins the server for some reason
bug-reports 2022-12-11 16:43:58 Thats an intentional feature ~~really annoying tho~~
Just respawn and the sounds should be normal
bug-reports 2022-12-11 16:45:08 Yeah, nobody really likes it but we just have to deal with it
bug-reports 2022-12-11 16:45:15 Lucky
bug-reports 2022-12-11 17:20:00 I know
general 2022-12-17 21:27:24 But if you make it too hard, they wont even try
general 2023-01-02 02:09:43 Make it a tiltrotor
general 2023-01-02 02:10:05 Good
help 2023-01-11 17:33:49 There’s a guide on yt for it
help 2023-01-13 17:34:02 A lot of rotation lock
help 2023-01-19 16:22:39 There are steps that come after though 

Nobody improves just by being insulted a lot
help 2023-01-19 16:25:26 I was mostly talking to sci

help 2023-01-19 16:27:53 L
help 2023-01-19 16:28:49 Thats how planning works
creations-chat 2023-03-14 03:12:12 didnt ask for critique
creations-chat 2023-03-14 03:20:06 not changing jack shit cope
general 2023-03-17 00:29:32 nah ai is actually slightly reasonable
general 2023-03-17 00:29:48 more reasonable than roblox mods
creations-chat 2023-03-29 03:35:34 engines are too big for the wings and gear, but nice contra-rotating props
bug-reports 2023-07-07 03:56:35 anyone else getting kicked frequently since the update?
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:10:08 this is new bozo
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:23:45 just confirmed if you place a cylinder against another cylinder's rounded side you get kicked
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:24:37 i think if you place anything on the rounded edge of a cylinder it does it
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:29:03 HOW
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:32:18 dammit still
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:33:55 use opera dingus
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:36:11 it might be a custom kick message for people who use that copy hack to make them think its an error
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:36:31 oh
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:36:37 definitely the anti-copy then
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:37:55 hes showing the image as an example of what an error code looks like
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:38:03 yeah
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:38:25 if it isnt anti-copy then i'd guess the private server kick script got messed up
bug-reports 2023-07-07 04:38:50 those are the only 2 reasons for a script to kick a player i think
