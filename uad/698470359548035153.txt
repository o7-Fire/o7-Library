general 2021-12-04 20:53:16 eh just saying
general 2021-12-04 20:53:20 im just trying to level up
general 2021-12-04 23:32:55 how many people are on this server?
general 2021-12-04 23:33:23 guys shouldnt there be a bigger map for plane crazy
general 2021-12-04 23:33:33 im a scientist from rust lol
general 2021-12-04 23:33:41 ik
general 2021-12-04 23:33:49 exactly
general 2021-12-04 23:33:53 im tired of the old ocean
general 2021-12-04 23:34:03 i want a way bigger map so i can be a bomber
general 2021-12-04 23:34:29 seriously an infinite map?
general 2021-12-04 23:34:39 why cant they make a very big map
general 2021-12-04 23:34:53 maybe they should set up npc targets
general 2021-12-04 23:35:07 no but besides being infinite
general 2021-12-04 23:35:25 wouldnt that lag the game?
general 2021-12-04 23:35:30 if it was infinite map
general 2021-12-04 23:35:42 oh
general 2021-12-04 23:35:58 well hopefully hey have better engines
general 2021-12-04 23:36:09 im tired of having to use rocket engines
general 2021-12-04 23:36:41 wait
general 2021-12-04 23:36:50 i do
general 2021-12-04 23:36:57 as a hyperdrive only
general 2021-12-04 23:37:23 but wait what if u could transfer ur designs from plane crazy 1 to plane crazy 2?
general 2021-12-04 23:37:32 so u dont have to rebuild them all over again
general 2021-12-04 23:38:51 Good
general 2021-12-04 23:39:09 now im happy i dont have to rebuild em again
general 2021-12-04 23:40:01 wait will there be new pvp weapons added?
general 2021-12-04 23:40:19 they should add like 20 mm gatling cannons or something
general 2021-12-04 23:40:23 or artillery cannons
general 2021-12-04 23:40:36 thx
general 2021-12-04 23:41:06 wont let me
general 2021-12-06 13:02:01 Morning

bot-central 2022-01-24 00:41:32 suggestion
bot-central 2022-01-24 00:41:37 pls suggest
general 2022-01-24 00:41:57 wait how do you suggest bc i dont know how to use it
general 2022-03-05 17:40:11 Hey guys when is plane crazy 2 coming out?
general 2022-03-05 17:41:01 Nah im legit serious man lol
general 2022-03-05 17:41:38 Oof
general 2022-03-05 17:42:06 Well lets hope it at least comes out in the end of 2022 or early
general 2022-03-10 21:29:11 Wait plane crazy 2 is out?
general 2022-03-10 21:29:18 Bc i saw a video of one
general 2022-03-10 21:29:28 Oh
general 2022-03-10 21:29:37 I was just confirming if it was fake or not
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 08:43:06 man when is plane crazy 2 coming out?
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 08:43:35 no like the date
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 08:43:56 no im being dead serious
plane-crazy 2022-09-10 08:44:31 cap
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:34:35 Yak 38 nice
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:35:15 U guys when is plane crazy 2 coming out?
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:35:31 Hopefully
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:35:49 I mean hopefully there are better engines so i can refit my plane
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:35:58 Maybe delay?
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:36:33 Man the downside of hover engines is that they slow down when my plane turns so tightly
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:36:49 Oh fair enough
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:37:14 No here is the thing i design my planes to be decently manueverable
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:37:32 And i put super rocket engines combined with hover engines
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:37:46 Some can do that
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:37:58 Wait what?
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:38:02 I didnt know
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:38:38 Tips on how to make my planes not get drag
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:39:22 So like max speed setting and zero drag settings?
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:39:33 For hover engine?
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:39:47 Ok thanks
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:39:53 Another new thing to learn
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:40:03 Bc i make my hover engines max settings
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:41:05 I think it reduces speed or like idk
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:42:59 No to get ur opinion on my jet
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:43:30 The fastest my planes go is around 600
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:43:43 But now my planes i make goes around 520
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:43:58 Dam
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:44:19 One of my creations could go 5k bc it can decently handle the speed
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:44:28 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:44:58 Bc i havent designed a plane yet that can go high speeds and never exceeded the limit
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:45:12 But i could try using my last working magnet engine plane creation
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:46:44 They patched it but i did have a magnet plane go at 2k
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:47:07 I still have a working one
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:47:38 Compared to newer engines
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:48:08 No like as in hover wngines and conveyor are better than magnet engines
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:48:12 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:48:17 But as in they work better
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:49:08 The only cool thing is that i could do reverse thrust with magnet engines
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:49:29 And that too
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:50:29 For what?
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:51:35 Oh ok
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:51:58 Vector thrust basically?
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:52:28 Ah thats cool
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:52:45 I never got to make that type of stuff yet
plane-crazy 2022-09-19 13:52:59 Just been focusing on jet designs and working on my aircraft carrier
