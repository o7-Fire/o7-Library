plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:31:45 Hey. Does anyone know how to make little tiny planes to launch from a carrier?
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:33:51 Yeah, that is a bit big, sorry about that.
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:34:38 Let me count the width of my carrier deck rq
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:35:13 14 bocks wide but I want 3 planes in a triangle formation.
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:35:26 I found a tutorial for a small jet plane and I just put a gun on the front.
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:35:57 but on 1 side a bit of the bridge is taking up 3 blocks of width
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:36:14 doesn't matter to me. I was originally looking at a WWII design but i'm fine with anything
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:39:32 I'm on mobile.
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:40:15 and I think the weight of the ship is messing up how the plane flies
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:41:09 I'm not lagging. My plane just goes straight up and to the left which is where the center of weight of the whole build is.
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:41:31 and it does loops & weird stuff
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:42:03 ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:43:01 now it doesn't have as much thrust
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:43:08 enough thrust*
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:43:34 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_wPHOhqYRU here's the original tutorial i used
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:43:45 I just attached it to a carrier build.
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:44:00 oh
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 09:44:09 ok
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:03:06 The lava spitter causes so much lag
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:04:17 roblox is saying no results
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:04:32 nvm found it
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:05:31 and roblox gave up lol
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:49:13 WElp my game crashed
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:49:15 and it's late
plane-crazy 2021-08-06 10:49:22 yeh
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 05:39:53 is it possible to get invisible blocks?
plane-crazy 2021-08-07 05:40:13 I want to try and make a smoke block invisible to make a musket or something
