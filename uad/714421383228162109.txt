plane-crazy 2022-03-21 17:38:54 what else do you want me to do?
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 17:39:18 surely it is better to check anything than just blindly believe or not believe it?
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 17:40:42 some guy literally just told me it in game
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 17:40:48 so i came here for confirmation
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 17:40:53 what else am i gonna do
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 17:41:11 its less effort to ask here than anything else
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 17:41:25 and i figured people here would probably know
plane-crazy 2022-03-21 17:48:07 yeah but multiple people in here are saying the same thing and will probably know so yeah
plane-crazy 2022-03-22 07:04:09 lmaooo i was in pvp and some guy was moaning that i shot him

plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:03:44 when making missiles, why do people put suspention on the front?
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:03:48 what does it do?
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:04:00 ok
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:04:08 how does the suspention need to be set up?
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 11:04:18 ok
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 14:15:57 does anyone know how to set up suspention on a missile so that it doesnt bounce?
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 14:16:18 yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 14:16:22 impact fuz
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 14:16:28 but i dont want it to bounce
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 14:16:41 ok
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 14:16:56 so how do i set it up to make the missile not bounce
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 14:17:44 im sure you can
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 14:17:47 ive seen it
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 14:18:04 but i use suspension in my missiles and it doesnt work
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 14:18:07 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 14:18:16 but impact fuzes are slightly broken
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 14:18:26 so it bounces and explodes a bit away from the target
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 14:20:53 ahh ok i got it to work
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 14:20:57 nvm
plane-crazy 2022-03-26 14:22:24 yeah lol thats what i do with guided bomb

plane-crazy 2022-04-18 14:36:31 but after that
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 14:36:41 it still kinda goes a bit mental when flying

plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:26:18 how yould you guys suggest doing the nose for a G91?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:26:49 well yeah but like how
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:26:55 what blocks and stuff would i use
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:31:11 this is what ive got so far, how could i improve it?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:33:06 cool
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:33:13 is it a 105mm aa?

plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:35:11 ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:35:33 i havent tried for any ranks because none of my non-m2m planes can yaw üóø
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:35:48 and most use prop engines to keep the nose up
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:36:14 ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:36:32 but for the ranks some of the requirements are yaw and no props
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:36:41 also all my planes have hover glitch drives
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:36:48 and you arent allowed to use the hover engine at all
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:37:19 ok ill try for a rank with this g91 im currently building, i havent put any "banned" things in it yet
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:38:08 i could get aeronautical engineer IV now
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:38:19 i have a big b52 i built, like 3500 blocks

plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:41:29 ok ive applied
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:41:32 hope i get it

plane-crazy 2022-06-03 10:57:27 the nearest spawned player or other players' spawned build (or piece of it)
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 11:00:28 does this look enough like a g91

plane-crazy 2022-06-03 11:27:16 do you guys think the leading edge of these wings would be better with 1x2 delta wings or 1x1
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 11:27:28 i cba to angle lock
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 11:27:42 ok

plane-crazy 2022-06-03 11:34:30 ill see if i can overlay them
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 11:36:36 i think the 1x1 is better but needs to be a bigger wing

general 2022-06-20 18:20:43 what why did that get deleted?
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 05:22:44 is there a release date for pc2 yet
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 05:22:57 ah right lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 05:23:10 so next spring?
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 05:23:17 lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 05:23:38 lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 05:23:39 wait
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 05:23:41 
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 05:23:43 how
general 2022-07-02 17:25:03 vtol isnt supposed to act like helicopters in combat are you dumb
general 2022-07-02 17:25:16 they are simply supposed to take off from small spaces
general 2022-07-02 17:25:19 then act like ets
general 2022-07-02 17:25:21 jets
general 2022-07-02 17:26:21 aircraft carrier (ik ik steam catapults all that but same diff) or in the event of basically a ww3 scenario all airfields would be completely destroyed
general 2022-07-02 17:26:46 well they have pretty much been retired since the 50s, they just used one in desert storm lol
general 2022-07-02 17:27:43 yeah ik but if they can take off vertically then you can store more planes on the flight deck so can have more in a combat ready state
general 2022-07-02 17:27:51 just use missiles or airstrike
general 2022-07-02 17:27:57 more accurate
general 2022-07-02 17:28:05 lol
general 2022-07-02 17:28:55 airstrike and missiles are much more efficient, much more accurate, and much less wasteful
general 2022-07-02 17:30:19 are you taking the piss
general 2022-07-02 17:31:48 a tiny little modern cruiser/destroyer with missiles can do much more in much less time and with a smaller package than any battleship
general 2022-07-02 17:32:10 is he taking the wee wee
general 2022-07-02 17:33:14 and also the enemy forces might have CIWS, and hypersonic low flying stealth missiles are much harder to hit than a 2,000lb shell falling from the sky
general 2022-07-02 17:33:58 why no?
general 2022-07-02 17:34:30 so can a hypersonic cruise missile
general 2022-07-02 17:36:41 not CIWS or anything like Iron Dome, they would have to be intercepted by something long range, however the travel time is ~20 seconds, and they fly low to evade radar AND stealth ones exist, whereas a big ass shell has no stealth capability and can be shot down by both CIWS and an Iron Dome style system
general 2022-07-02 17:37:57 i dont think a military using ww2 style battleships in 2022 would have such technology üóø
general 2022-07-02 17:38:59 oh yeah, that have to be dropped from an aircraft, which takes hours to arm, fuel, and fly over, when a missile can just destroy the ship and the airfield
general 2022-07-02 17:39:24 no CIWS can really have a good chance of destroying any hypersonic missile
general 2022-07-02 17:40:38 yeah, non nuclear ones that would either hit or miss by 5 miles, that could only travel 200 miles, a hypersonic missile can travel >1000 miles much faster
general 2022-07-02 17:41:58 oh, but just now you were arguing about ww2 technology, so are now changing your entire argument? interesting
general 2022-07-02 17:42:40 yeah , just like they dont have ww2 era battleships now, and theres a reason for that
general 2022-07-02 17:43:43 my brother in christ you have no argument, my argument is that we shouldnt be using ww2 battleships now and that hypersonic missiles are the way forward
general 2022-07-02 17:44:23 ok, but what if you have to attack a nation that can defend itself? now you have a multimillion dollar useless piece of metal
general 2022-07-02 17:45:50 ok but you did reply to my argument about hypersonic missiles <@315262125113081856>

the-dump 2022-08-29 06:57:34 goddamn weakling micro organisms
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:12:39 well thats just obvious
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:12:42 china would lose
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:12:51 they got like one big aircraft carrier
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:12:57 they have 60 j20s
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:13:16 america has like  600 f35s
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:13:40 yeah that is true
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:13:51 but america would just bomb the shit out of them
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:14:16 and if the three gorges dam is destroyed, then ~40 million people would either die or be displaced
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:14:27 and loads of industry would be wiped out
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:14:58 china is like north korea but slightly less "bad"
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:15:04 if you know what i mean
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:15:14 they are *slightly* less totalitarian
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:15:26 and the living conditions are mostly a lot better
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:15:39 and chinese people are actually allowed to leave china lol
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:15:44 absolutely not
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:15:51 im pretty sure america does
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:16:09 china has more ships
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:16:20 but american ones are bigger and most are objectively better
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:16:38 america has way more carriers
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:17:00 and all their aviation tech is like 40 years ahead of chinas
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:17:50 well maybe that is an exaggeration
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:17:57 its closer to like 20-30
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:18:01 but the point still stands
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:26:03 h20 is the chinese one
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:26:49 the design does look cool tho i will admit that
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:34:13 b2 entered service in the 90s
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:34:42 the h20 (as far as i know) is not yet in service
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:35:10 and its unlikely they have better technology in china than america
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:35:27 as far as i know there is no chinese area 51 or lockheed skunkworks
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:35:48 where america develop all their futuristic shit
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:37:11 they have a thing called "dream studio" but its nowhere near the scale of the skunkworks
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:37:34 that happened to me when i was researching pe8
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:39:26 only at low tier

the-dump 2022-08-29 07:39:54 yak 3 is great
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:39:59 yak 9 is great
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:40:15 the only thing wrong with them is low ammo count
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:40:26 but you can still get 2 kills easy with bad aim
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:40:32 coz the guns are good
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:48:22 that is a bad jet
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:48:30 a prop can kill that thing
the-dump 2022-08-29 07:48:53 get american jets

creations-chat 2022-12-29 19:22:07 what do you think about my design for a napalm bomb? any suggestions? (reference image attached)
creations-chat 2022-12-29 19:24:22 it works against either unmoving targets or very large targets, i tested it on a boat just now and it worked ok, but yeah if the bomb bounces or spins on the way down then its gonna be unpredictable
creations-chat 2022-12-29 19:31:42 i mean yeah to be fair its not good as a pvp weapon, however theres not really any other way to make a ""working"" incendiary weapon in plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-12-29 19:38:40 ok but you can only use two lava spitters in a build
the-dump 2022-12-29 19:42:13 
creations-chat 2022-12-29 19:44:31 i would, but im trying to get it to look and function like a real life incendiary weapon, and that would be a bit complex to do in whats basically a 1x1 tube
