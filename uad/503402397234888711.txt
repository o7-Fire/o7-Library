[map]
It would be nice to maybe have a lake or something behind the plots. It would give more of a reason to make water vehicles as they're so far away from spawn as of right now like nobody sees them and they can't really go anywhere interesting

general 2021-07-30 02:58:18 uh oh
general 2021-07-30 02:58:29 same whats the link
general 2021-07-30 03:04:11 
general 2021-07-30 03:04:37 it's better than 78% lol
general 2021-07-30 03:05:56 you could probably find it if you scroll up far enough
general 2021-07-30 03:08:02 probably something like being a teacher or something
general 2021-07-30 04:31:02 hi
general 2021-07-30 04:31:03 same
general 2021-07-30 04:32:49 me no like china
general 2021-07-30 04:33:54 did somebody say cancer sticks
general 2021-07-30 04:38:37 I like how you guys judge someone's entire personality based off a discord profile picture
general 2021-07-30 04:39:19 lol
general 2021-07-30 04:40:26 that's debatable but ok
general 2021-07-30 04:41:32 I'd imagine a boat is
general 2021-07-30 04:41:36 not a massive warship tho
general 2021-07-30 04:42:13 the saying "drives like a boat" exists for a reason
general 2021-07-30 04:45:15 make it fly?
general 2021-07-30 04:45:47 try both
general 2021-07-30 04:45:50 like a vtol jet
general 2021-07-30 04:47:15 what about subs
general 2021-07-30 04:47:22 nuclear submarines are nice
general 2021-07-30 04:47:41 depends
general 2021-07-30 04:49:26 the bigger nuclear subs usually sit underwater for a very long time and have multiple ICBMs
general 2021-07-30 04:51:24 I like tanks
general 2021-07-30 04:54:06 tank go boom boom
general 2021-07-30 04:55:02 a friend of mine made a massive trebuche
general 2021-07-30 04:55:07 t
general 2021-07-30 04:56:17 visibility I guess
general 2021-07-30 04:56:21 still not very smart
general 2021-07-30 04:56:33 some are
general 2021-07-30 04:57:36 this is an old american project
general 2021-07-30 04:57:39 I think its cool
general 2021-07-30 04:57:55 true
general 2021-07-30 04:58:00 but tank v tank
general 2021-07-30 04:58:06 that's over 300mm of armor on the front
general 2021-07-30 04:58:09 which was a lot for back then
general 2021-07-30 04:58:15 but ww2
general 2021-07-30 04:58:26 good luck with that accuracy lol
general 2021-07-30 04:58:39 yes
general 2021-07-30 04:58:45 thats why I said tank v tank
general 2021-07-30 04:58:57 planes would decimate that thing obviously
general 2021-07-30 04:59:07 no
general 2021-07-30 04:59:09 tank good
general 2021-07-30 04:59:15 what about the light tanks
general 2021-07-30 04:59:21 Sheridan was a nice one
general 2021-07-30 04:59:27 false
general 2021-07-30 04:59:40 nice
general 2021-07-30 05:00:15 
general 2021-07-30 05:00:25 thats a sheridan
general 2021-07-30 05:00:38 it was amphibious too
general 2021-07-30 05:00:43 spaced armor
general 2021-07-30 05:00:46 good for heat rounds
general 2021-07-30 05:01:00 probably if it had enough fuel
general 2021-07-30 05:01:27 it could go 43 mph
general 2021-07-30 05:01:47 which is like 70 mph
general 2021-07-30 05:01:50 kph
general 2021-07-30 05:02:03 I mean
general 2021-07-30 05:02:08 if you're gonna go boat why a sail boat
general 2021-07-30 05:02:17 eh who needs water
general 2021-07-30 05:02:44 a bit of debris could tear a hole
general 2021-07-30 05:03:01 and no more sail
general 2021-07-30 05:03:13 yes
general 2021-07-30 05:03:30 what's wrong with a massive engine and a few propellers
general 2021-07-30 05:03:34 yes
general 2021-07-30 05:03:53 also a bit of wind can't carry much
general 2021-07-30 05:04:19 a sail boat wouldnt really work in the military as a warship
general 2021-07-30 05:04:25 I eman
general 2021-07-30 05:04:30 in terms of stuff I guess
general 2021-07-30 05:05:02 that doesnt look very stable
general 2021-07-30 05:05:19 can't imagine it was very fast
general 2021-07-30 05:05:38 true
general 2021-07-30 05:05:50 yeah
general 2021-07-30 05:06:06 I still think motor boats would out perform a sailboat
general 2021-07-30 05:06:22 yes I'm talking about now
general 2021-07-30 05:07:20 https://youtu.be/V1dEH07_jKM look at this 8 year old video
general 2021-07-30 05:07:28 I mean
general 2021-07-30 05:07:37 wouldnt a plane or something be better for that
general 2021-07-30 05:08:15 I mean I never really cared about sailboats so I dont know much about them
general 2021-07-30 05:08:23 but if ou need to get somewhere fast you
general 2021-07-30 05:08:27 you're screwed
general 2021-07-30 05:08:50 situational
general 2021-07-30 05:09:02 but that defeats the purpose of sail
general 2021-07-30 05:09:24 I mean what if you needed to get to another continent fast
general 2021-07-30 05:09:28 I'd use a plane
general 2021-07-30 05:10:18 eh
general 2021-07-30 05:10:21 sales are lame anyway
general 2021-07-30 05:12:47 anyways
general 2021-07-30 05:12:57 it's all subjective really but I still like tanks more
general 2021-07-30 05:13:36 exactly
general 2021-07-30 05:14:09 those cannons aren't gonna do much against battle ship armor
general 2021-07-30 05:14:23 they need armor lol
general 2021-07-30 05:14:35 how lol
general 2021-07-30 05:15:05 you could stick a 20mm autocannon with incindiary rounds to a sailboat and it would evaporate
general 2021-07-30 05:15:40 scout boats are for quick
general 2021-07-30 05:16:53 there's fast smaller military boats but a battle ship wouldnt turn nearly as fast as a sailboat ofc
general 2021-07-30 05:17:27 that would be bad news for the crew lol
general 2021-07-30 05:19:05 this would evaporate a sailboat without armor
general 2021-07-30 05:19:32 exactly
general 2021-07-30 05:19:44 uh oh
general 2021-07-30 05:20:01 armor on boats keeps bullet from doing damage
general 2021-07-30 05:20:07 deflection
general 2021-07-30 05:20:21 why do you think the navy does it
general 2021-07-30 05:20:30 yes
general 2021-07-30 05:21:36 imagine what this would do to a sailboat lol
general 2021-07-30 05:21:49 those thousands of bullets would bounce off a modern battle ship
general 2021-07-30 05:22:03 ik
general 2021-07-30 05:22:07 but still even then
general 2021-07-30 05:22:29 you could use an ainti aircraft turret against a sailboat due to its lack of armor
general 2021-07-30 05:23:00 ye
general 2021-07-30 05:23:31 if you get too close you could probably just shoot down the sailboat with assault rifles
general 2021-07-30 05:24:21 some battle ships have rocket launchers as well
general 2021-07-30 05:24:32 rice
general 2021-07-30 05:24:43 incindiary anything would destroy a battle ship
general 2021-07-30 05:25:27 I thought it didnt have armor
general 2021-07-30 05:25:35 lol
general 2021-07-30 05:25:58 hmm
general 2021-07-30 05:26:35 op pls nerf
general 2021-07-30 05:27:11 HE rocket
general 2021-07-30 05:27:35 but it would explode in the process
general 2021-07-30 05:27:49 rocket go boom
general 2021-07-30 05:28:03 the momentum causes internals to explode
general 2021-07-30 05:29:03 are there any sailboats in warthunder
general 2021-07-30 05:29:10 aw
general 2021-07-30 05:29:42 airstrike from one of those aircraft carriers

general 2021-07-30 19:42:35 I have a job
general 2021-07-30 19:42:56 Ikr
general 2021-07-30 19:43:35 My mom manages a cleaning company so I'm working there for now. Pays pretty good too
general 2021-07-30 19:45:13 He's gonna work at a buisness
general 2021-07-30 19:45:21 That sounds like fun
general 2021-07-30 19:45:51 I can drive
general 2021-07-30 19:45:57 But I'm not a weeb
general 2021-07-30 19:46:00 Yeah
general 2021-07-30 19:46:23 Kinda scary at first but after like a day or 2 it's easy
general 2021-07-31 00:45:16 whats a woman
general 2021-07-31 00:50:17 me mic no work
general 2021-07-31 00:50:29 I have the voice of a 30 year old man
general 2021-07-31 01:00:47 are they gonna rework conveyors in the rewrite
general 2021-07-31 01:01:29 are they gonna rework conveyors in the rewrite
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 01:01:49 are they gonna rework conveyors in the rewrite
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 01:03:08 hope not
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 01:03:12 I like glitch engines
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 01:03:17 and they dont really cause any harm
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 01:03:21 unlike lag engines
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 01:03:38 nice
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 01:03:45 I have a lot of glitch engines
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 01:04:01 fastest I've gone without causing a physics explosion is 1.2 million sps
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 01:06:19 nice
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 01:06:23 but I mean while stable
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 01:06:43 like being able to slow down or keep accelerating
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 01:12:42 this is the first actual glitch engine I've ever made and that was like 2 years ago
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 01:12:48 that took a while to send
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 01:18:59 it's not in the helium but yeah from my knowledge without some serious game breaking motorlock and a ton of hovers that's the fastest engine for its size I know possible
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 01:19:26 magnets are pretty nice too
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 01:20:20 magnet engines dont have much torque like at all but they'd be a slower and more stable way than a conveyor engine to achieve infinite speed
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 01:20:45 and hover engines are nice
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 01:21:02 I remember that one time I got a starter plane up to like 1100 speed using a double hover engine
general 2021-07-31 01:26:26 do I smell simps
general 2021-07-31 01:26:47 same
general 2021-07-31 01:29:09 neolithic period
general 2021-07-31 01:29:49 yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 02:05:27 for the most part yes but I found a way to make it variable and for whatever reason conveyor engines say no to physics
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 02:06:05 true
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 02:06:18 when using conveyor engines tho you dont seem to need to worry about gravity
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 02:06:31 when I turn it on even at lowest setting it kinda floats there
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 02:09:11 really? for me its the same way but the other way around
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 02:09:15 magnets are really laggy
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 02:09:42 the way I make my conveyor engines they're super agile, fast and not laggy at all
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 02:10:06 tho conveyor engines are easier to mess up and not good for being inside builds
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 02:10:30 I have like a 20 block conveyor engine that works alright
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 02:10:54 1 conveyor at minimum speed and the others at max
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 02:11:02 make the minimum always on
plane-crazy 2021-07-31 02:11:06 and boom
general 2021-07-31 06:19:10 hi
general 2021-07-31 06:19:23 nice

general 2021-08-01 00:30:16 hi
general 2021-08-01 00:30:37 I have a car but it's a 1999 toyota corolla with 200k miles on it
general 2021-08-01 00:30:44 1b
general 2021-08-01 00:32:08 wow
general 2021-08-01 00:32:11 that's unfortunate
general 2021-08-01 00:32:27 my car is a 1999 toyota corolla
general 2021-08-01 00:32:43 it has 200k miles on it but it runs pretty nice
general 2021-08-01 00:32:54 beans
general 2021-08-01 00:33:43 damn
general 2021-08-02 20:05:24 hi
general 2021-08-02 20:06:01 did those people who pinged madattak get banned
general 2021-08-02 20:06:22 someone pinged him 3 times
general 2021-08-02 20:08:11 excuses
general 2021-08-02 20:08:58 ping madattak
general 2021-08-03 00:34:20 hi
general 2021-08-03 00:35:23 tell the gun to go away
general 2021-08-03 00:36:09 nice
general 2021-08-03 00:38:02 I don't think a .22 would make a hole that big
general 2021-08-03 00:39:12 maybe a shotgun?
general 2021-08-03 00:39:31 also that's impressive penetration power for a .22 to go straight thru an armored humvee
general 2021-08-03 00:41:12 tell yourself to do it
general 2021-08-03 00:41:13 done
general 2021-08-03 00:46:05 roblox studio completely died for me like a few months ago
general 2021-08-03 00:46:27 wouldnt let me build anything but a few 2x4 blocks I couldnt do anything with
general 2021-08-03 00:49:58 hi
general 2021-08-03 00:51:25 I have one of those
general 2021-08-03 00:54:27

general 2021-08-03 02:58:57 bye
general 2021-08-03 03:00:50 half of my saves are of random glitch engine experiments or low effort builds
general 2021-08-03 03:02:44 nice
general 2021-08-03 03:03:25 I don't have the time or patience to make any massive 3000 block detailed builds
creations-chat 2021-08-06 23:52:31 what advice do you guys have for that engine im working on

plane-crazy 2023-04-07 21:12:55 huh
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 21:13:16 I was testing a spinner
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 21:13:45 lol
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 21:16:21 Not sure why but seeing that symbol on wheels get flung into the sky at Mach 5 was hilarious
