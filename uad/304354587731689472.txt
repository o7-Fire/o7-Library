creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:48:58 Doesn't that cause jollts?
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:50:31 I'd imagine turning all the wheels whilst throttle is applied would cause a bit of a shake
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:51:20 Still possible depending on terrain conditions
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:52:33 I doubt that
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:52:50 Such a thing can happen to anyone
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:53:37 With the dynamics Plane Crazy plays with, always having the tune spot on for suspension, torque and in calibration to the weight of the vehicle, it's hard to get it on the first go
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:53:54 Gotcha
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:54:31 I was being literal
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:54:47 Fair point
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:56:03 I was just asking a question though
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:56:31 based upon what I understand, multiple wheels turning at once, even at the finest tune, can cause problems
creations-chat 2020-04-12 08:56:56 Pulling in the quills might be nice
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:09:15 I don't if it was intentional but the floppy orientation of his legs add that extra

creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:12:26 why
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:12:51 O wait, wasn't there are heated argument about how you dont need to give a reason why builds get downvoted?
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:14:41 You recent downvote...?
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:14:53 Like.. the only last posted built
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:17:39 So are we in accordance, reasons for downvotes must be given?
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:18:54 So when is it warranted?
creations-chat 2020-04-12 09:20:22 Closest thing that is to is a yes, thus I shall take it as a answer to the former

creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:04:53 Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed...
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:05:10 I figured
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:05:12 Might
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:05:38 I've found that they sort of stabilize my YT-Freighter, which is a large cargo craft
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:05:51 Could be something to look into
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:06:14 Yes
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:06:32 It's heavier at the back so when I descend it often tilts backwards
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:06:40 but when i elevate the front,
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:06:44 it stabilizes
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:07:16 Wdym?
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:07:37 No
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:08:01 two are underneath the rockets at the back, at each end, then four go along the two wings
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:08:24 So there is more bias at the front
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:08:32 because as said, most of the weight is at the back
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:11:09 m

creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:13:17 Well yeah but that takes a bit of tweaking,
creations-chat 2020-04-12 10:13:34 might as well pop in the movie and watch it at the same time

plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:35:30 Okay I have a slight motor 2 issue which is grinding me like a grindr request
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:36:23 If I put 90 degrees max angle on motor 2 with toggle, pushing the backwards keybind should move it back to it's original position right?...
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:37:15 You got 90 degrees angle, move it back 90, it should be 0 right?
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:38:10 Yes exactly
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:38:14 But it's not
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:38:32 It does not
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:38:39 That's whats confusing me
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:38:57 Nope, tried with both on and off
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:39:23 Doesnt matter, still does the problem
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:39:49 No, dude, it's moving alright
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:40:03 It actually moves 180 degrees
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:41:05 Yeah but it's not going back to the start position
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:41:40 i press it once it does the first tilt in 90 degrees as I had put in, but if I move it backwards it goes 180 to the other side
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:42:18 Thats what I assumed
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:42:30 m and n
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:42:38 2 different
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:43:15 Yeah but that doesn't fit task i need it to do
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:43:20 It has to be 2 different once
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:44:01 Okay, no I'mma just go ask somewhere more sensible because I really dont like your hostility
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:44:07 Guil actually gave me a solid reason
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:44:09 so thx ig
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:51:12 1 keybind to move it one way, the 2nd keybind for the opposite direction
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:51:34 I need it to be 2 different binds working in sync
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:51:46 because it's part of a larger contraption,
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:52:17 my question was just if motor2 goes from start position or if it can work on a 90 -90 basis
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:52:28 but you gave me the answer so now I know
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:52:39 Ty
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:55:37 None at all
plane-crazy 2020-10-25 19:55:45 kept it at 30
