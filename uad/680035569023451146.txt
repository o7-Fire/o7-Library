plane-crazy 2020-12-06 18:22:37 Bonqk
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 21:56:24 For hover drives, can the piston be facing any direction or does it have to be facing the hovers?
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 21:57:19 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 21:57:34 Can it be facing away but have decreased power?
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 21:57:40 Kinda like motors
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 21:57:50 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 21:58:04 Ik motors can be used at at least 2/6 rotations
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 21:58:55 Do disconnectors work for it? It seems like it should
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 21:59:18 Idk
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 21:59:43 Shredder nukes are only good against small builds
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 22:00:04 Shredder bombs are like u drop a clump of shredders on someone?
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 22:01:09 I have a few reasons
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 22:01:19 Also only good on smaller builds
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 22:01:41 Unless ur abusing blacklist in which case nobody likes you
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 22:01:58 Blacklist abuse is annoying
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 22:02:11 But I mean let’s take a 200 block fighter
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 22:02:17 You drop it
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 22:02:20 It hits
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 22:02:34 Does a tiny bit of damage to the middle of the plane
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 22:02:37 And falls off
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 22:02:51 The plane keeps flying with only a small dent
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 22:03:18 Ofc
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 22:03:35 How fast does ur bomber go?
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 22:03:53 I bomb accurately at like 400

plane-crazy 2020-12-06 22:09:34 220 for vers without motorlocks and bombs
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 22:10:35 Bottom line, use hover drives
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 22:10:43 Wait ballast to make it lighter?

plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:19:52 Literally a seat that flies with nothing connected
plane-crazy 2020-12-08 23:23:26 If I make a flying seat that has nothing connected to it. But it flies anyways, will I get upvotes?

creations-chat 2020-12-09 18:38:09 Powered motor lock? NANI <@!300749802009001986> using tnt for motor lock only works in priv servers or if u activate within 5 seconds in pvp since spawn prot will protect you from the damage
creations-chat 2020-12-09 18:40:17 WHOT SERIOUS DANG. MAN I WISH I KNEW THAT. How do u work the disconnectors?
creations-chat 2020-12-09 18:42:30 I have tried toggle motor lock with springs but thats only working on big builds, how do u use disconnectors for toggle lock?

creations-chat 2020-12-09 18:57:27 Change config on the smoke pipes on the 150mm cannons so that when u press keybind to shoot missles, smoke comes out at the same time then stops when u release keybind. Just to make it look good
creations-chat 2020-12-09 19:01:36 only in pvp or priv tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-09 21:38:13 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/786249866761863228

help 2020-12-20 05:23:07 Ok so more wings?
help 2020-12-20 05:23:24 I thought that more wings makes it worse lol
help 2020-12-20 05:23:37 So I chose a plane with tiny wings to base that build off of
help 2020-12-20 05:24:10 Oh I think my problem with big winged builds is that I don’t make the top fin big enough
help 2020-12-20 05:24:25 So it also shakes side to side
help 2020-12-20 05:25:14 Yeah
help 2020-12-20 05:25:18 Something like that
help 2020-12-20 05:25:32 And also why do people always say wasd controls

help 2020-12-20 05:26:00 Ik
help 2020-12-20 05:26:35 Literally everyone is like “Use motor 2 flaps”
help 2020-12-20 05:26:42 Oh
help 2020-12-20 05:26:46 It’s 150 blocks
help 2020-12-20 05:27:03 And I shoved 14 hover drives split between 2 pistons

help 2020-12-20 05:28:56 I put power the entire length of that thing
help 2020-12-20 05:29:18 Meanwhile that’s enough to power my 660 block bomber
bug-reports 2020-12-20 05:30:41 Yeah, when u move locked motors at high speeds, the motor splits and lags behind
bug-reports 2020-12-20 05:30:56 The only way to get it back it to stop and move the motor
bug-reports 2020-12-20 05:31:22 Oh
bug-reports 2020-12-20 05:31:37 It might be the same locked or not
creations-chat 2020-12-20 05:34:26 Use a motor with cameras to slide the trail down a half block

Locked motor takes everything down half a block
creations-chat 2020-12-20 05:36:35 So when u lock a motor it moves everything half a block and careras are invisible. Use a motor with cameras on it which are then connected to the trail. When u spawn the build in, u can move it to the side

Not if u use 2 motors on top of each other to bring it down another block

plane-crazy 2021-01-06 18:51:44 I got shot in the wing, and got in a dogfight with one wing and no vertical stabiliser

help 2021-01-07 22:49:31 my plane with and without bombs, why does it fly so screwed up without bombs?
help 2021-01-07 22:50:16 the really drastic turns are where I tried to use my elevators to stableise myself
help 2021-01-07 22:50:57 why is it tipping the nose down/
help 2021-01-07 22:51:12 shouldnt it be back heavy not front heavy though?
help 2021-01-07 22:51:38 should I add helium on the motorlocks
help 2021-01-07 22:54:07 I cant do a roll via pitch that well but other than that 10 helium helped a bit
help 2021-01-07 22:55:38 ok that turned out to be very annyoing
help 2021-01-07 23:53:14 Sometimes glitches like that are hardware problems. I have a plane with hover drives and literally no wings at all it goes 2200.

plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:36:52 Is that right?
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:37:21 Do u put the control surfaces on the tail or what
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:37:41 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:37:47 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:37:57 Thx I never have done a heli

plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:43:18 Bigger wing builds roll fast but pitch slower
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:43:28 I use hybrid
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:43:39 Glitched mouse and w s elevator support
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:43:49 It’s what gj uses aswell
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:44:01 ?
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:44:06 What is hybrid then
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:44:26 By hybrid do u mean wasd and mouse?
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 00:44:33 Combined

plane-crazy 2021-01-08 01:19:29 What does hover in place mean for a heli? Does it have to be completely still or can it just make the root go on and off to hover in the relative same place?
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 01:20:20 Like perfectly at that altitude?
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 01:21:25 Is 9 sps down count as hovering?

plane-crazy 2021-01-08 13:40:01 and the bombs are on the ground

plane-crazy 2021-01-08 14:43:09 and other times the exact opposite
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 14:43:14 like shown in the video
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 14:44:43 Its minorly annoying, especially when it would have been a good kill
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 14:44:56 its like 1/5 chance that I die like that

plane-crazy 2021-01-08 17:16:14 if u motorlock control surfaces inside blocks its very possible tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 17:16:44 NO WINGS
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 17:16:58 Provide no drag or lift
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 17:17:07 Tail fins
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 17:19:18 He said no wings at all
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 17:19:24 like not even motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-01-08 17:20:19 Its literally impossible

plane-crazy 2021-01-08 18:35:27 Is a jet bomber after dropping bombs considered a fighter jet or is it still a bomber
general 2021-01-09 14:51:48 War thunder on website or steam?

general 2021-01-09 14:57:45 Does it give me anything
general 2021-01-09 14:57:51 Ok

plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:08:50 anyone have a shredder in their pvp server they need me to kill?
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:10:55 I need to fight shredder....
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:11:10 Because all shredders deserve to die
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:11:26 I have been server hopping forever
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:11:40 shredder numbers went down
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:17:57 anyone got a shredder in their server that I can annihalate?
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:29:28 water is 1 density
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:30:05 once drag has done its work, it will stay the same in the water column
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:30:18 adding blocks wont work
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:30:33 as is u add 2 blocks there will be twice the area
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:30:46 therefore density the same
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:31:13 idea
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:31:45 I was just making one lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:32:29 1 block is 0.28 density
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:33:04 2 is 0.56
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:33:15 I just used a balance
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:33:25 ballast on one side
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:33:29 blocks on the other
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:34:16 10 blocks is 2.8 density
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:34:32 and yes the balance works
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:36:50 ok cameras are weightless I see
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:37:32 they are
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:37:48 I just stacked 10 on one side of a scale and nothing on the other side
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:39:01 lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:39:49 hitboxes
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:40:28 hrm
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:40:37 2 wedges way more than block?
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:40:39 nani
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:41:01 A wedge weighs as much as a block kek
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:41:21 Im testing block stuff on a scale
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:41:37 Block = 0.28 density ballast
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:42:15 oh jeez
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:42:39 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:43:45 idk
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:44:28 ok half block weight is reasonable
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:45:44 hrm
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:45:49 da hec
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:46:19 text signs change the center of mass alot
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:46:26 in build mode
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:46:36 but a bunch of them dont even tilt the scale
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:46:53 Its like cameras
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:47:22 U can spam so many that the center of mass is on the left side of the scale but it will still not be affected
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:47:35 even when nothing on the right
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:48:14 I think they wanted them to be weightless but had to include it in build mode
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:48:38 so when u spawn its weightless but they needed a calculation for the build mode indicator
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:49:16 90%?
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:51:26 ok i have proof that cameras are weightless
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:52:11 uploading
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:52:19 to streamable so u can see
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:52:48 https://streamable.com/1wc46m
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:53:01 If thats not weightless idk what is
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:53:11 phantom?
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:53:23 pretti epik
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:54:35 hmmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:54:37 good point
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:55:12 what is ur setup?
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:56:01 mm smart
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:56:11 hold up
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:56:17 can u see camera levitate?
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:56:27 lemme test if text is weightless
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:57:34 5 text 1x3s vs nothing
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:57:57 hehe
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:58:06 we might see a camera levitate...
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:59:14 hold up
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 22:59:25 its weightless but it still falls?
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:00:04 <@456226577798135808> do u know how much a helium block can pull?
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:00:23 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:01:45 how does it fall if its weightless
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:02:11 texts and cameras are weightless I think
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:02:24 but they fall
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:04:06 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:04:12 thats when its neutral?
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:04:39 bruh cameras are weightless but they still fall
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:04:46 I am in a ton of confusion
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:05:23 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:05:49 I am confused rn
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:06:08 both text and cameras are weightkess
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:06:12 but they fall
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:06:17 so w h a t
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:07:12 or weight is broken
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:07:15 like usual
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:07:43 https://streamable.com/1wc46m
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:07:59 I have 500 cameras spammed
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:08:04 scale doesnt move
plane-crazy 2021-01-09 23:08:06 I gtg
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:22:04 Sorry for late response but what do u think the mass is?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:22:25 Even if it’s 0.001
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:22:35 It should have tipped the scale easy
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:22:58 But
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:23:08 500*0.001
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:23:14 0.5
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:23:42 A half block that tips the scales easy is 0.14
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:24:41 0.28 density ballast is 1 block
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:24:49 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:24:54 Ik
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:25:03 The system is wack
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:25:22 0.28 ballast and 1 block balance perfectly
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:25:44 And to that extent 2.8 ballast is equal to 10 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:26:12 A wedge is also the same weigh as a block
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:26:25 Even tho is should be 0.14
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:26:41 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:26:49 W u t
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:26:55 U mean if u make a cube?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:27:14 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:27:25 I only tested basics before I had to go
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:27:33 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:27:40 Half block is half of a block
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:27:45 Some of its correct
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:27:49 Others are not
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:27:58 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:28:04 Half block is 0.14
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:28:09 Block is 0.28
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:28:51 Blocks in terms of ballast weight
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:29:28 I need to test if a seat is heavier on one side or the other
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:34:15 Me I’m presuming?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:34:26 Hehe smol builds go brrrrrrt
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:34:48 Literally my largest working build is 700 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:37:23 Part of me wonders if u could post kill in creations if my jets would get downvoted because of cheese grater or upvotes because of clapping shredders
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:44:36 1
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:45:01 It doesn’t float nor sink, since waters density is also 1
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 01:59:01 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 02:06:26 I am on a mission to prove that cameras are weightless
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 02:35:39 1000 of them are unable to tip a scale
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 02:35:58 People say that cameras are 0.001 density
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 02:37:19 If 1 unit worth of cameras doesn’t tip a scale that is easily tipped by 0.14 units worth of half blocks, idk what else u call weightless
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:23:24 I’m pretty sure that they have no weight at all like cameras
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:23:39 But somehow they get affected by gravity
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:24:16 That’s something I should check but never have
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:24:19 Lemme see
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:28:18 Wut
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:28:52 A block is 0.28 mass and a motor is 0.24
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:29:15 So....
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:29:48 6/7 of a blocks weight
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:29:58 Is a motor
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:30:25 Weight system is messed up
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:30:30 I use a balance
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:30:37 Ballast on one side
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:30:41 Block on other
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:30:51 Let me check explosives
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:32:11 ?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:32:24 Same weight as a block
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:32:54 Explosions are toggled by keybinds unless u hit on impact
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:33:13 In which case it explodes as soon as it hits the floor on another build
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:34:21 Impact speed?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:34:26 I don’t rlly know
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:34:41 I just max blast pressure and radius
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:34:48 And keep speed at stock
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:35:14 ?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:35:18 What do u mean
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:40:04 :lasses:
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:40:12 Does it work here?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:40:25 We’re if u copy emoji it translates it
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:40:46 That’s a rickroll
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:40:51 Don’t event try it
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:41:26 It’s a rickroll lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:54:32 I just had a brain seisure reading above
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:54:51 W h a t
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:55:46 I swear u had missile jamming shit on that thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:56:39 I wasn’t the one that did this but I didn’t help the situation
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:57:14 I was the cyan jet trying to zoom past at Mach and land a shot
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:57:29 Every time the missles declined
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:57:48 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:57:59 Sometimes I missed entirely
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:58:32 Other times it was a straight shot and the missiles literally just repelled away from the thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:58:49 If I didn’t have close tracking i would have hit
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:59:01 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 03:59:20 Custom angles on wings screwed it up
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:00:04 A few of the shots would have hit without close tracking
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:00:11 But I did take like 20 shots
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:00:16 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:00:56 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:01:02 Sometimes it’s nice though
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:01:33 As it is it can completely lock onto a shredder doing 360s
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:01:52 Which is nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:02:10 Nope
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:02:39 My scale is a simple setup
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:02:52 Anchor, 3 blocks above
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:03:05 A motor powered off on the side of the 3rd block
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:03:18 11 blocks centered on the end of the motor
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:03:38 lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:04:01 Getting my su-34 in the air and balanced is a pain
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:04:35 No just no conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:04:53 Rlly?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:05:19 Every time I use conveyor my plane spin around in circles pulling 100g
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:05:38 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:05:48 I used it on one plane never again
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:06:05 Sure
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:10:38 Just look at hof
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:10:56 90% of em are not flying vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:12:23 Camera lock as well prob
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:12:35 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:13:09 Just because we prove you wrong...
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:13:28 Ah yes here comes the kekw storm
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:13:58 Ummmm wut
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:14:27 Am I innocent child or is this MA joke?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:16:48 Yeah I got it
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:23:16 Bomb
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:24:11 Am I the only one here that likes going into public pvp servers?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:25:02 I’m not a gun spammer but I like causing chaos
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:25:32 Oh hell nah
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:25:38 I hate those things
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:25:56 Jets going Mach shooting down everything and everyone in the sky
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:26:12 Or bombing every ship that touches the water
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:26:46 My hitlist is shredder, a-10, ship, plane, turret, car
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:27:02 In terms of what I target first
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:27:12 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:27:19 I forgot about Helis
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:27:30 Under cars
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:27:40 Also car ish
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:27:49 Change car to ground vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:28:13 My hitlist is shredder, a-10, ship, helicopter, plane, turret, ground vehicle
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:28:17 There we go
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:28:20 Fixed
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:28:41 Am I the only one that targets a-10s?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:29:05 With what
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:29:28 That’s precisely the reason I kill them, 90% are tuts
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:29:43 Sometimes I let people go
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:30:03 Not shredders or toxic kids in planes though
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:30:26 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:30:41 Like a yoink van?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:30:50 Where it just grabs u
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:31:02 Hrmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:31:27 Slap a box over a car, use pistons to close box at bottom
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:31:35 Use wedges to get under
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:31:55 Then drive over to the end and yeet the car
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:32:05 I need to consider that
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:32:13 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:32:25 Plop a box on a car
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:32:29 Close the box
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:32:38 Carry the box with the car over to the void
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:32:46 Chuck the box
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:33:06 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:33:25 
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 04:33:33 Mission failed we’ll get em next time
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 11:30:42 Holy shit...
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 11:31:46 He literally gave u feedback lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:32:49 <:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:39:29 Um idk
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:39:59 <@221496030355521536> what is drone pilot role?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:40:15 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:40:33 Ooooooh
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:40:41 Now it’s just contest winner...
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:41:03 H o v e r. D r I v e s
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:41:34 Use hover drives and then motorlock afterburners or whatever u want for the enine
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:41:38 *engine
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:42:26 ?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:42:36 Certain acceleration wym?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:42:58 Interesting
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:43:10 U don’t need to spam hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:43:14 Just 4 or 5
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:43:23 To make it go 400 500
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:43:29 Or something
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:43:56 So only use 5 of em... and how is it cheating
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:44:30 Motor locking super rockets is as cheaty as hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:44:38 And it’s a lag storm
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:44:52 And ticks off everyone in the server with mass noise
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:45:01 What are u gonna use then
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:45:17 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:45:26 That ain’t gonna work
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:45:37 How big is plane?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:46:09 Tbh
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:46:22 Not everything expert worth is insanely good
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:46:48 Some get upvotes just for all the blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:46:54 Or functionallity

plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:53:17 How do u do a mag drive though?
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:53:32 I never bothered learning because conveyor and hover are better
plane-crazy 2021-01-10 23:53:55 Conveyor is mag but faster and more compact

help 2021-01-11 16:21:23 right at 0:20
help 2021-01-11 16:21:43 I land and it just vibes its way right through the wheel

help 2021-01-11 16:28:16 ok I just sacrificed 50 speed for non glitchy treads
help 2021-01-11 16:33:59 but they are always derailing
help 2021-01-11 16:35:43 Ok added half a block of tension and it fixed
help 2021-01-11 16:40:35 ummm
help 2021-01-11 16:40:40 sometimes they glitch
help 2021-01-11 16:40:45 respawn and try again
help 2021-01-11 16:41:16 sometimes it doesnt work because on random occasions the hover thrust dont go through motorlock to the piston
help 2021-01-11 16:42:36 huh
help 2021-01-11 16:42:42 what is ur setup?

help 2021-01-11 16:44:45 idk
help 2021-01-11 16:44:59 try removing the blocks that are motorlocked into the thruster as a test

plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:41:57 I was running on the top and the tread literally clipped into the roof
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:42:10 and after I started running it then the derail came

bug-reports 2021-01-11 21:20:02 beam 1x7 is fine

bug-reports 2021-01-11 21:39:15 ok

plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:12:23 Is the fact that the bottom of one tank tread is 330 blocks a bad thing?
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:15:58 How can someone get their hands on the copy and paste script?
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:16:47 U can use disconnectors for toggle lock
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:17:23 I just slap them so that the flat side is facing out and put a helium on top
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:17:45 As soon as I toggle it, it locks and the flat stick flies away
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 03:17:54 And it’s only 1x4

plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:13:25 Way too op in dogfights
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:13:53 Just bop one and it’s an easy shot
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:14:00 Exactly
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:14:14 Mmmm anti bomber
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:14:23 Happy ship noises
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:14:47 It is never used for that though
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:15:37 But what’s the point of shredding if u already flung them
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:16:17 The whole point is that we are anti shredder here
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:16:55 I am creating a laggy ass tank that will just be an anti shredder
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:17:19 It destroys physics throttle so as soon as shredders touch they lag out
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:17:25 :)
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:17:43 It’s also got cutters on the sides of the treads
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:17:53 Yessir
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:18:06 It’s a 7 wide tread
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:18:58 Using cutter, motor, half wedge down , half wedge in the wedge section, half wedge down, wedge, cutter
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:19:02 In that order
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:19:26 So the actual tread is 5 wide but cutters on each side
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:19:47 It’s big aswell
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:20:22 That need much more tension
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:21:12 I was thinking about it but how, the trapdoors make sure that other parts of the tread don’t hit the ground
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:21:29 So unless u covered the entire thing with trapdoors
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:21:35 Which is a pain
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:21:51 U wouldn’t get anything benificial out of it
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:22:10 Also lock some motors for tension on that thing, the treads are loose
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:22:53 And for the anti derail u can just use a half cylinder that’s ice
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:23:02 2 cylinders are overkill
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:23:05 And bulky
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:23:30 I’m not sure how the weld hitboxes work on trapdoors
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:23:41 I mostly do small builds
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:23:53 My biggest plane is 650 or something
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:24:14 Not to mention I am all about function which doesn’t get u much on this server
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:24:50 I’m hoping that my big tank treads can get me expert terrain
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:25:03 I dunno
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:25:18 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:25:49 You need more tension on your tracks <@!289930922655088640>
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:25:54 They are all wobbly
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:26:07 It would lower chance of derail aswell
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:26:16 Locked motors
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:26:19 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:27:21 Do I event wanna know what that is?
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:27:38 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:29:01 I have a new way to fold, idk if I should reveal tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:29:49 If u come up with a new way to do something I think there’s a chance
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:30:22 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:30:53 I was just trying to make folds without stupid motors sticking out everywhere
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:31:16 Zoinks
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:31:30 That’s pretty poggers
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:32:12 Can u toggle the 0 grav via the thrusters or no
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:33:05 Can u toggle the 0 grav or not?
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:33:22 Like if u turn the hovers off will it stop hovering?
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:34:47 And also will it hold any amount of weight?
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:35:29 I might do that for my tank helicopter if so
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:36:05 If you turn the hover thrusters off
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:36:13 Will it stop hovering?
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:36:17 Or not
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:36:43 Hmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:36:45 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:37:02 I’m still making tank helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:37:12 Oh no
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:37:18 Turret child
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:37:46 Lol I literally warned u about reposting turret in creations
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:38:10 Doesn’t listen and reposts as a new paint job
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:38:31 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:38:41 I need that helicopter tank
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:38:43 ...
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:38:58 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:39:04 Now with hover thingy
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:39:19 I can just use props or something for thrust
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:39:35 Wait
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:39:41 Do hover drives still work?
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:39:55 No on the glitch thingy
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:40:03 Ik they work in general
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:40:13 But on the 0 grav thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:40:33 Nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:40:45 ...
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:40:55 U were literally making a shredder car
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:41:34 Why did u have a car with a shredder in it shell shock
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:42:03 It was 4 wheels on a square block with cutters on a spinning motor
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:42:26 It literally used the same weapon that bugs do
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:42:32 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:42:57 I was in ur server
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:43:17 I made once for a battle bot competition with my friends
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:43:46 I was the tank that kept just destroyed physics throttle every once in awhile
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:44:26 Ur friend in the hover car shot me and I explode causing a lot of lag
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:44:40 The only tank that had treads
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:45:13 About as bannable as lag machines I’m guessing
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:45:21 Which as of now isn’t that bannable
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:46:00 Nope both of those are wrong
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:46:07 So is that
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:46:18 And so is that
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:46:29 Jets
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:46:37 Kill shredders in the sky
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:46:51 Ummmm
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:47:14 Don’t even think about posting that in creations
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:48:33 Exploding shredder
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:48:39 That’s the last thing I need
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:48:58 That’s not nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:49:07 That means u follow a tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:49:11 Which is b a d
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:49:31 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:49:43 He does got a point though
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:50:53 This one kid had a full on double wishbone suspension car with motor wheels, then tries to copy my tank treads with the excuse that he’s bad and doesn’t know anything
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:51:39 I made rens fighter,￼ once a shredder bug, and I think that’s it
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:51:52 In terms of tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:52:20 Don’t bulli, I did make shredder
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:52:37 I haven’t used in like 3 months tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:52:47 What
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:53:09 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:53:21 I thought he just shredded himself or something
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:53:32 Oh well that’s interesting
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:53:53 Fireworks and rockets are broken underwater
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:54:19 Idk how rockets are underwater but I know the surface makes them blow up
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:54:29 Apparently not
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:54:40 Since he blew himself up with em
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:55:35 Why do so many people use motor 2 turrets on planes
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:56:07 Ur just trying to dogfight normally and someone just shoots at u from behind in a fighter jet
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:56:27 I use anywhere from 4 to 8
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:56:40 4 on my main plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:56:46 8 on my F 20
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:56:56 And 6 on my other jets
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:57:05 I have many motorlock bombs
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:57:41 How about good old carpet bomb
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:57:58 It takes a critical hit with a gun to split a ship
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:58:10 It’s easy to split with bombs
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:58:25 I take out most ships with a single dive from missilery
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:58:31 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:58:43 Yeah carpet bomb can do that
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:59:07 I can carry about 200 blocks of payload in a 240 block plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:59:16 <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:59:43 Motorlock and a bunch of hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 04:59:54 It’s a small plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 05:00:02 But big bomb
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 05:00:41 Oh I meant the plane itself is 240 and the payload is another 200, not that the entire thing is 240
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 05:00:59 That would be absurd
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 05:01:07 I should sleep
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 05:01:17 It’s midngiht and I have test
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 13:22:04 This is fine....
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 13:22:45 7 wide treads being made
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 13:23:00 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 13:23:05 lag incoming
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 13:23:37 there is 7 different blocks per tread length as well lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 13:23:48 not just 1x4 and 1x7 beams
general 2021-01-12 13:35:07 how to zero grav without bobux done

general 2021-01-12 13:39:24 public
general 2021-01-12 13:49:32 It cracks under weight
general 2021-01-12 13:50:15 yeah under weight u need more
general 2021-01-12 13:52:38 can u just motorlock hovers in one place?
general 2021-01-12 13:52:51 I think that would work
general 2021-01-12 14:04:11 ***quite a few***
general 2021-01-12 14:14:30 Bluesea you can do 0 grav without bobux with just motorlocking hover thrusters
general 2021-01-12 14:26:26 yawning abyss?
general 2021-01-12 14:26:29 what
general 2021-01-12 14:27:12 This is fine
general 2021-01-12 14:27:34 lol
general 2021-01-12 14:28:02 I can say that I was inspired by that video but im not copying his design in any way
general 2021-01-12 14:29:32 Imagine not commiting big treads with 10k blocks and made of blocks that break the physics throttle
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 14:30:10 Imagine not hover drive and zoom away
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 14:36:24 I would hop in ur server if I wasnt in school

general 2021-01-12 15:44:24 I think there is a way to make war thunder control style planes
general 2021-01-12 15:44:51 like mouse control plane
general 2021-01-12 15:45:00 with a and d for roll axis
general 2021-01-12 15:45:08 and q and e for extra yaw
general 2021-01-12 15:45:31 wut
general 2021-01-12 15:45:40 control surfaces dont work that way
general 2021-01-12 15:45:43 they dont give yaw
general 2021-01-12 15:45:54 not just mouse controled
general 2021-01-12 15:46:02 war thunder mouse control
general 2021-01-12 15:46:17 As someone who uses glitched mouse control I can say this is false
general 2021-01-12 15:46:26 no yaw on control panels
general 2021-01-12 15:46:34 only pitch and roll
general 2021-01-12 15:46:48 yes
general 2021-01-12 15:47:03 normal mouse
general 2021-01-12 15:47:09 not glitched mouse
general 2021-01-12 15:47:16 and with normal maouse u cant roll
general 2021-01-12 15:47:20 same
general 2021-01-12 15:47:43 I use shift ctrl for speed and stuff
general 2021-01-12 15:47:57 mouse for roll
general 2021-01-12 15:48:06 w and s for assisted pitch
general 2021-01-12 15:48:15 and on small planes q and e for yaw
general 2021-01-12 15:48:23 only because thats part of my nose design
general 2021-01-12 15:48:36 yeo
general 2021-01-12 15:48:43 yes
general 2021-01-12 15:48:51 its roll and pitch with mouse
general 2021-01-12 15:48:59 nah

plane-crazy 2021-01-12 16:39:05 Someone in my server literally just asked me are u making the longest tank?
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 16:51:56 And feedback on current tread design?
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 16:53:21 wut
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 16:53:32 I want it to be big
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 16:54:02 Trying to get like 3k blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 16:54:08 idk if ima hit it though
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 16:54:14 maybe if I add details
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 16:54:56 The way I have it, side plating will be easy
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:09:32 How does it look, ignore the messy tensioning
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:09:51 should I increase height?
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:10:17 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:10:30 so make it taller?
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:11:03 ima make it taller by a bit and reduce tensoioning by a bit
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:11:27 why <:trollface:775024642104229898>

plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:31:38 before it was skinny
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:32:38 At this point is where protrode hands over the copy and paste script
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:32:52 because need
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:41:20 hehe I knew the cutters on the sides would help at some point
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:41:45 I sawed this snake in half
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:42:17 physics throttle go brrt
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:49:10 <@!790732709559271444> u wanted the treads taller, how are these?
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:49:23 nop
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:49:45 Unless I literally start motorlocking to increase height, no way
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:49:58 no
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:50:03 the hec
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:50:13 thx
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:50:13 ok now I have an idea tho

plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:50:28 wut
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:50:31 oh god no
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:50:59 you dont say?
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:51:09 I think I could do it though
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:53:29 lol'
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:53:42 I cant do suspension or swash but I can do tank tracks
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:57:07 paint block for intakes
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 17:57:22 only color the end black, so u dont have the entire block
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 18:00:49 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 18:18:02 physics throttle is non existant :)
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 18:19:54 damping is like how bouncy it it, more damping less bouncy
plane-crazy 2021-01-12 18:20:14 stiffness is like how stiff the spring is and how much force it takes to push

plane-crazy 2021-01-12 23:33:42 Not exactly talk about plane crazy but ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 01:26:04 Ok that’s sad, a rocket engine that would power a real life rocket at 5000 mph can’t even hit 600
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 01:27:04 I’m dieing making these treads
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 01:27:21 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 01:31:03 Confusion
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 02:04:31 Why is it so hard to make 3000 block tank treads
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 02:05:41 My treads are fricking gigantic and are only 2500 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 02:09:16 Septagain?
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 02:09:57 I would hop in there with my treads and help crash it but I can’t rn

plane-crazy 2021-01-13 02:21:02 I’m pretty sure that’s cameras

plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:14:44 Idk how any of it works
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:20:09 Ok that’s confusing lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:21:11 Hrm I think I understand
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:22:15 Yeah the 2nd one makes more sense
bug-reports 2021-01-13 03:23:39 I’m pretty sure if u have a material selected, you can’t even change from a block to a main pilot seat in order to place it
bug-reports 2021-01-13 03:24:31 I had fabric material on and I placed some cutters, then when I tried to select the main pilot seat in order to place it I couldn’t, I had to select normal material again
bug-reports 2021-01-13 03:24:54 Idk if this is just fabric cutters or what but it’s a small glitch that’s kinda interesting
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:25:19 Can u turn with that though?
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:26:20 There is a way but tricky
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:26:39 You would have to toggle each side on different keybinds
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 03:26:49 If legs get out of sync, chaos

bot-central 2021-01-13 03:37:21 ?suggest Ability to change materials on more blocks

It would be nice if we could change the materials on more blocks like disconnectors, motors, magnets, ect. This would be helpful on detailed builds that use motorlocks and disconnector roofs but also want detail in materials
bot-central 2021-01-13 03:37:40 Wrong prefix go brrrrr
help 2021-01-13 03:40:01 Can you still get inventor if you make something that changes a old technique in a brand new way which decreases weak spots and increases looks?

plane-crazy 2021-01-13 15:58:03 maybe use low power conveyor engine to overcome the drag from 0 grav without bobux
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 15:58:15 that way its silent

plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:00:45 What is this plane?
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:01:19 H229 looks like a good build but its got so many different forms
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:01:27 some are jets in the nose
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:01:36 some are jets in the back
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:01:43 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:05:47 I have proof that cameras have weight
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:05:55 oooooof
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:06:14 cameras are weighted but the mass indicator is broken

plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:07:10 there
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:07:43 2000 cams will tip the scale, but they are lighter than a freaking half wadge
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:07:52 30 min with jitter click
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:08:19 even though mass is way on the right side, it tips with a tiny bit of weight on the left
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:08:45 so mass indicator is broke
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:08:53 but cameras have weight
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:09:12 wait a minute....
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:09:40 the way the cameras behaved was screwed up
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:09:55 like they had a lot of weight for half a second then went weightless
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:10:17 it dipped down like it was heavier then counterbalance
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:10:26 then dipped up a second later
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:10:36 almost as if it was heavier but then went weightless
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:11:00 thats sus
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:11:10 I need to test that
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:22:22 Ok this is false
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:23:10 I was able to bounce a camera up and down on a spring
plane-crazy 2021-01-13 18:23:34 which proves it was able to be affected by grav

plane-crazy 2021-01-14 17:46:36 if u do a powerful enough tail rotor somehow I guess u could do it

plane-crazy 2021-01-14 17:47:12 I made one and it is special

plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:04:47 conveyor tank treads are so glitchy
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:04:58 they are used for conveyor engine
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:05:08 which in my opinion is 2nd best engine
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:05:23 and sometimes other things like cosmetics
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:05:51 is there glass wing panel?
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:05:53 or no
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:06:30 even to scale thats tiny

plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:07:34 3 wide
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:08:12 By the tail fin it goes up to 2.5 blocks tall not including the fin iteslf
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:08:37 cockpit is like 3 tall
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:08:57 no im just talking abt landing up
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:09:19 player 2 tall
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:09:32 and im talking about my jet
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:11:20 My plane can fly without a wing or vertical stabiliser
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:11:25 and still win a dogfight
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:11:44 that is my glitched mouse is king
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:12:05 I lose my right wing and the control surfaces calculate that and change it
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:12:27 um idk
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:12:41 idk if thats what happens
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:13:00 I have 1-2 control surfaces in my nose aswell
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:13:20 but I was flying without vertical stabiliser before that happened
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:13:35 so I was flying stable, just sideways
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:13:59 the heck is that
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:14:20 ima try taking my vert stabiliser again and see
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:14:29 if it fly straigt with wing in front
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:21:56 its back heavy
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:22:16 put some wings on the back that way the blue and yellow indicator are close
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:22:32 im guessing rn the yellow one is way behind the blue
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:22:41 hence the fact that ur doing backflips
plane-crazy 2021-01-14 19:24:04 that indicator doesnt work if ur using motorlock tho

plane-crazy 2021-01-16 22:51:32 2000 tourque
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 22:53:20 When I use a single motor, it works just fine. All I’m doing is making it twice as powerful

plane-crazy 2021-01-16 23:05:47 Or is it just locked pistons
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 23:05:59 Because piston lock is insanely laggy
plane-crazy 2021-01-16 23:06:27 Locked pistons crashed my game once

plane-crazy 2021-01-18 22:39:26 With a piston under each stack
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 22:39:33 That’s a ton of thrust
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 22:39:37 Oof
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 22:40:23 <:empty:794431705070174238>
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 23:25:48 If set to 0 grav and assuming there is no other thing affecting drag such as wing panels, the build will move on forever as long as it doesn’t get affected by outside forces, the hire the drag, the faster a vehicle will come to a stop with 0 being at never
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 23:26:51 More drag on thrusters, the more force affecting the movement
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 23:27:01 What do u wanna do with the thrusters?
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 23:27:40 <@!499705220637392897>
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 23:28:07 I can’t build for anything so I can’t help u, sorry
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 23:28:19 For speedy builds, 0 drag
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 23:28:45 Ew motor, use a piston unless ur actually using the motor for some function
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 23:29:17 Wut
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 23:29:23 Wym
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 23:29:30 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 23:29:46 I don’t think so
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 23:29:51 Well...
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 23:30:11 Depends on hitboxes of the hover thrusters when spawned
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 23:30:32 Idrk tbh
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 23:31:03 All I know is if I extend, I can’t motorlock in that area
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 23:31:15 That can be a problem in some builds
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 23:34:31 I still need to learn the ins and outs of conveyor drives

plane-crazy 2021-01-19 02:29:36 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 02:30:10 Whenever they touch something, they do dmg
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 02:30:37 The amount of power behind the hit determines the dmg
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 02:30:52 No

plane-crazy 2021-01-19 15:29:24 inside nose of first stage, have vertical control panels, when close to ground use motors to turn it rlly quick and flip the rocket over then do powered landing
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 15:30:21 Its possible but would it be allowed for crazy scientist
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 15:30:48 yeah but engine power alone
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 15:30:54 airbrake isnt engine power

plane-crazy 2021-01-19 15:31:48 <@!195253906333368320> is using a airbrake temporarily to flip a rocket allowed for crazy scientist
plane-crazy 2021-01-19 15:32:22 like the rocket is flying nose first, activate an airbrake for a second so the end falls, then do a powered landing

plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:39:31 <:wot:695654208837255219>
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:39:55 the two ends are connected?
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:39:58 or wjat
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:40:02 in synk?
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:40:19 locked motor wouldnt exactly do it
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:45:11 As far as im concerned its impossible
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:45:29 I thought pretty hard
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:45:46 unless u cam lock whic the legs would be messed up
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:45:56 I dont think there is a way
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:46:08 wait what does reset do on motor
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:46:16 whats reset
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:46:46 what if u had it so that after they got out of synk u just had em reset
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:47:04 and then started again in sync
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:47:49 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:47:52 oof
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:47:55 idk then
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:48:53 hmmmm
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:49:04 what if u ran it on the same internal motor
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:49:25 idk how to do that tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:49:35 make both legs run on one motor
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:49:58 each side is perfectly opposite
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:50:08 ye
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:50:24 each side is in sync with itself but not with eachother
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:50:45 this is why we need gears rick
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:51:06 still wouldnt work tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:51:09 2 way
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:51:23 would run at different times with different forces
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:52:17 no that would get out of sync more
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:52:41 gtg for now
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:54:03 it would be quicker to desynk tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 00:54:13 im bac for a bit

plane-crazy 2021-01-20 04:18:00 For a plane built for speed, I don’t want unnecessary weight
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 04:18:13 My main fighter has 2 locked motors
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 04:18:41 U use conveyor
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 04:18:53 Conveyor doesn’t matter about weight
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 04:19:01 You have said this 10 times
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 04:19:12 No
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 04:19:21 But you have said it a lot
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 04:19:41 And I use glitch mouse so vectored thrust to turn won’t help
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 04:20:05 You can’t activate rocket engines with mouse movement
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 04:20:11 Ummm no

plane-crazy 2021-01-20 04:26:32 W s are elevators
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 04:26:50 9 is cockpit and ejection of glitch mouse setup
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 04:27:21 Oh b is anchor
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 04:27:28 G is gear
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 04:27:46 Q is small amount of yaw left and turn left with gear
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 04:27:52 E is the same thing but right
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 04:27:57 F is missiles

plane-crazy 2021-01-20 18:34:46 I use motorlock bombs and instead of a ballast set to 6 on the motorlock to balance,I have it set to 2.5 and 22 cutters. Spawned it looks the same and weighs the same but if I drop bomb at low altitude the cutters do a little extra dmg

plane-crazy 2021-01-20 18:45:21 simple
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 18:45:57 for glitched mouse users it spawns open, and then you hop into cockpit, press one keybind, and it closes

plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:07:13 fireworks are an underrated dogfight weapon
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:07:16 so are guns
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:07:38 guns are insanely underrated
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:07:49 hehe

plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:09:30 ? most people dont use guns thats why they are underrated
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:09:45 this statement is false
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:09:52 and im talking about planes
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:10:01 not aaa turrets
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:10:10 how many actually use em tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:10:33 you see guns on every plane but they are never actually shot in dogifhgts
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:11:00 not a dogfight worthy opponent, literally a flying turret

plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:12:54 thats what I mean
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:13:07 only turrets actually use guns as an active weapon
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:13:31 any vehicle with fixed arnaments rarely use guns
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:22:54 Same with the canopy but somehow my elevators/canards are fine

plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:37:36 <@!389516889501728779> sorry for ping but did I ever show u the new glitched mouse setup that I was working on? You seemed interested when I was making it but I had to eat dinner <:kek:652566605028524033>
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:37:54 hat
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:38:23 Why do I have so many roles at the rank of vtol 2
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:38:52 I wish magnets worked on other builds
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:39:15 you could make some insane meme ideas from it
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:40:22 interesting
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:41:08 I was thinking of some anti shredder thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:42:23 I was thinking stick a magnet with anchor on a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:42:47 they are immobilized and u can take a shot on even the most powerful ones
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:44:25 It was a thought, not applicable
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:44:38 if magnets worked on other builds it could be possible
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:44:45 but its hard
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:45:03 you could do something like it with a ap missile
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:45:45 they are hard to aim tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:46:00 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:46:06 protrode already has a vid on it
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:46:14 N O
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:46:37 protrode already has a video on an ap missile
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:46:51 still a shredder tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:47:21 wait a min
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:47:28 while motor2 is down
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:47:34 are shredders dead aswell?
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:50:40 ok its essentially a ballast set to 5, anchor block set to the same keybind as ur canopy motor, 2 blocks, adn then 5 helium on top of that then put main pilot on the bottom of that stick where the ballast is and put another seat or pilot seat on the other side to balance it out. That way it acts like normal glitched mouse but when you get in the canopy and close it, the entire seat flies away, leaving u without a weakspot
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:51:44 I paint it white normally
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:51:52 I can send screenshot of unpainted if u want
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:52:15 is it servo or motor 2 in general?
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 19:54:20 unpuri hehe

<@!389516889501728779> another ping ik but here is it just kinda laid out with what is looks like unpainted and how it functions (I use 9 as my canopy key btw)
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 20:03:50 thats really it
plane-crazy 2021-01-20 20:04:05 just an extra 9 blocks to remove a weak point in glitched mouse

plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:32:35 What is a mini b2
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:32:46 It better not be a tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:33:35 Welp i guess it is
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:33:58 Control panels
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:34:01 I’m guessing
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:34:24 Because u aint fitting no yaw servo in there
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:34:45 And stop using tutorials
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:34:56 They are never good
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:35:04 They don’t make u look good
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:35:13 U don’t get anything outta them
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:35:28 It’s just a waste of time
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:35:54 So what you followed a YouTube video, the real skill is making your own plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:36:37 There has never been one functionable tutorial build
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:36:45 They are all under par
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:37:40 Link?

plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:39:45 They all look meh and preform even worse
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:40:55 Lol if u call that mini b 2 tutorial functional...
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:42:48 I’m pretty sure he’s making a b 2 tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:44:38 What are u making then
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:46:59 Make what a and d controlled
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:50:03 W h a t. P l a n e

plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:50:41 I honestly don’t know how he did it so watch the tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:51:02 Because I don’t make mini b 2
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 04:51:13 Ima sleep
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 05:01:32 Yaw I’m guessing is vertical control panels inside the intakes bound to q and e

plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:48:53 Do it
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:49:26 When it’s locked, the motor will now not move unless it is prompted to
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:49:40 Why didn’t u lock it
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:49:57 It’s literally impossible to fold without it
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:50:32 Yeah but it falls apart
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:50:42 Wut
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:51:10 But when you try to move it kinda unfolds right?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:51:37 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 21:51:55 So what’s ur problem with the fold then?

plane-crazy 2021-01-21 22:50:54 tutorial planes are always bad
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 22:51:04 lol

plane-crazy 2021-01-21 22:53:19 :sung::lasses:
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 22:53:21 cri
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:05:02 is the plane balanced?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:05:18 it needs to be balanced and not front/back heavy like a real plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:05:39 do you have many control surfaces?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:05:48 it looks like it should be bananced
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:05:52 balanced*
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:06:13 how many do u have?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:06:21 thats not enough
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:06:31 and also thats a tiny plane for that many blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:06:46 This is my jet
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:06:55 just to put things in reference
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:07:14 your plane is tiny and likely not able to support much
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:07:31 so dont use a tutorial, be creative and make ur own
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:07:52 just start placing blocks and try putting wings on that
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:07:58 have elevators/canards
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:08:06 have a vertical stabiliser
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:08:17 just put control surfaces and delta wings
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:08:40 nice
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:09:01 look at mine
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:09:11 see how I put the delta surfaces so that the wings curve?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:09:24 and how I put the control surfaces inside the shell of the delta wings
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:09:35 this
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:09:45 its delta wings and control surfaces just colored
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:13:15 you know how planes work right?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:13:29 gamerpoints?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:16:41 blocks, 1x4 delta, 1x4 control 1x4 control
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:18:04 well ye
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:18:11 the weight is off balance
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:18:24 vertical and horizontal
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:18:33 horizontal can be canards or elevators
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:18:40 vetical is literally a fin
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:18:47 build it with wings
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:19:25 lul
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:20:35 <:kek:652566605028524033>

plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:23:28 can u send a video?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:24:16 tbh I learned how plane crazy worked off of a just rens tutorial
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:24:23 it kinda teaches u basics
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:24:47 and then from there I started watching gj and boom, glitched maus pvp dude
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:24:58 Can u send a video?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:25:36 and what are u even using for thrust lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:25:42 I see nothing
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:26:07 thats a bit big for one propellor
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:26:15 try putting a large prop or a jet engine
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:26:28 it will be hard for tjat thing to get off the ground
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:26:46 a larger engine
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:26:53 ye that too
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:27:09 propellor is an engine
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:27:17 use a large propellor instead
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:27:23 not small
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:28:06 ye can u send me a clip of it flying?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:28:31 just use x box game bar
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:28:35 or roblox recorder
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:28:47 and then upload to streamable.com

plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:30:25 This is what this jet type can do
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:30:30 with glitched mouse
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:30:36 and hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:31:03 notice I can roll fast, have a pretty good aim and almost never go below 600 sps
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:32:04 try putting gltiched mouse on that now
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:32:21 see how u like
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:32:42 It is 6:30
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:32:51 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:33:01 wait me and vip are same timezone
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:33:06 EsT gang
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:33:15 what time is it for u
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:33:33 oh so u are american
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:33:55 oh
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:34:08 what do u mean? show please
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:34:17 oh that but also elevators
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:34:36 or slanted wings
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:34:44 and big wings is not always the answer
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:34:59 I wish i had a pic of my F-20 on me
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:35:15 big wings can also be a lagfest on smaller fighter
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:35:47 like when my cyan fighter hits fast speeds with youtube open, it spazzes out'
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:36:27 you have to learn how to use the glitched mouse
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:36:44 with more speed, comes faster turning and roll rates
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:37:00 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvrPv6sZgik&t=51s&ab_channel=Gjsolo64
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:37:09 watch it all the way thrugh
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:37:20 it rolls because of his mouse postiton
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:37:34 as of now his plane is controlled by his mouse
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:38:18 there is no left and right steering with this. When u move ur mouse to the side it rolls. To turn, move it to the side, and then center and pull up
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:38:48 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:38:53 what
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:39:04 its just ur mouse position
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:39:15 watch the gj vid i sent
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:39:22 at the end he shows how to control it
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:39:27 like the basics
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:39:56 because of ur mouse postion
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:40:02 https://streamable.com/obvn76
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:40:15 <@456226577798135808> watch how my plane moves in responce to the mouse
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:40:25 when I move to the side it slides to the left
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:40:37 when I move to the other side it rolls to the right
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:40:44 when I move my mouse up it pulls up
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:40:47 same with down
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:40:58 its literally wasd but with mouse
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:41:33 no yaw unless u keybind some
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:41:44 mouse yaw would mess u up
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:42:06 idk
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:42:54 does he know wasd control?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:43:25 or how most planes (not ikfins) turn?
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:44:03 ye
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:44:23 first, turn ur mouse to the side
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:44:26 the plane will roll
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:44:40 then center your mouse again so ur flying sideways
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:44:47 then move your mouse up
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:44:55 and that will make u turn
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:45:10 after that, center ur mouse again and roll back upright

plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:46:08 most times with glitched mouse, weight doesnt matter
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:46:17 my planes are never balanced
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:46:18 at all
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:46:40 most of my planes are front heavy
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:46:49 depends
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:46:59 bigger wing gives more lift
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:47:11 but sometimes can limit maueverability
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:47:30 watch the video

plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:48:21 2:42
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:49:16 the way I saw his mouse it looked like he was constantly pitching up as the mouse was above his character
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:49:18 but ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:49:35 its hard to control
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:49:37 at first
plane-crazy 2021-01-21 23:49:48 but by the end its the best u can get for pvp fightuing

plane-crazy 2021-01-22 00:51:14 wait motorlock too
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 00:51:23 or just power loc
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 00:51:27 ok thank god
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 00:51:34 thank fricking god
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 00:51:47 I have never used power lock
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 00:52:10 well depending on the method it will
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 00:54:15 anyone got a good pvp server?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 00:54:25 ooh nvm
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 00:54:30 a shredder and a biplane
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 00:54:32 noice
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 00:55:04 I like encounter shredder
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 00:55:26 shredder is kil
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 00:55:33 I use 4 rockets
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 00:55:40 and still win 90% of the time
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 00:56:07 theres a ship
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 00:56:13 he just violated life rights
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 00:57:19 hes ded
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 00:57:44 oh I thought I had just killed u
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 00:57:57 I killed a small ship with a similar paintjob
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 02:54:12 ⭐ on a text sign
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 02:54:19 then color it white Ig
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 02:54:33 does that work?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 02:55:48 can u not color stars?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:14:48 Yeah the canards on my custom and the elevators on my su 34 are acting the same as usual
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:14:57 But my canopy is flipping out
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:15:16 I think it’s the way the servo is facing
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:15:44 For me when the motor 2 is horizontal, its fine
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:15:53 But vertical it flips out
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:16:54 I just use untoggled control surfaces on the edges for that type of thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:17:03 That way it’s a tiny gap
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:17:14 And looks good
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:17:31 Ye no keybinds but control automatically off
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:17:47 So it’s essentially a 1x0.9 wing panel
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:18:21 Well by untoggled I meant that it couldn’t move at all
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:18:51 My elevator on my su 34 is kind of messed up in that way but somehow it’s not broke
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:19:49 Like the way i have it, the vertical stabilizers are sticking half a wing panels width out into the area with the elevators
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:20:21 My su 34 is a mess
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:20:35 Everything is moved like half a block to the side or up or down
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:20:52 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:21:29 It’s still got some form of vertical stabilizer
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:21:53 Trust me 0 is doable but a pain as u can’t control it in anywhere under 500 sps
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:21:59 No vertical
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:22:09 I have tried
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:22:36 Wot
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:22:49 Like u don’t tilt the elevators up?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:23:00 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:23:05 Interesting
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:23:11 Dang
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:23:49 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/772979214340849714
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:24:07 That’s why I don’t make planes without vertical stabilizer
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:24:31 I use mouse
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:25:49 Do people still hate mouse control?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:26:14 I do mouse for pvp
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:26:56 I have full glitched mouse on my jets and w s assists
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:27:06 Like canards or elevators
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:27:26 The ability to pitch and roll with mouse
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:27:35 Full glitched mouse
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:27:53 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:28:19 I bomb ships
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:28:23 Because why not
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:29:01 I got like a variation of cutter nuke and carpet bomb
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:29:28 I used a ballast set to 6 on each side of the wing to balance out the plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:29:39 That ballast was dropped with bombs
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:30:03 I replaced a 6 ballast with 22 cutters and a 2.5 ballast
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:30:17 Same weight
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:30:20 So same balance
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:30:42 But when the motorlock explodes, it leaves a little something special for the insides of the ship
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:30:48 Wot
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:30:58 Clusters?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:31:08 U mean motorloc/carpet bomb
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:31:12 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:31:37 I take like 80 blocks of tnt and shove em into one area
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:31:43 That’s what I do
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:31:56 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:32:02 ?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:32:10 I got 40 bombs on each wing
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:32:24 Objection
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:32:41 With a big enough bomb, nothing even survives the first round
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:33:09 Most ships cripple under my carpet bomb of 80, much less 150
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:33:24 T h a t s. W h a t. I. D o
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:33:40 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:33:43 That’s what I mean
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:34:14 Lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:34:26 My bomber looks so innocent
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:34:38 Just a small little jet flying around
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:34:53 Until it drops its entire mass of bombs on u
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:35:03 That sounds like a challenge
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:35:23 I know someone who could crack it easy

plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:40:44 And with a big ass cluster bomb that’s not that hard
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:41:23 Wut
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:41:36 If motor go bye bye then the ship is sawed in two

plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:43:05 Where?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:43:36 Is that the wip post in creations
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:44:17 U have 2 posts in creations
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:44:40 One is a wip ship and the other is like a double decker bus
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:45:00 What do u define as sinking
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:45:15 Like when u actually sink or when ur incapacitated
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:45:18 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:45:34 I’m pretty sure I could take that out in one shot
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:46:19 I could bomb that thing in one round and kill it assuming I hit the target
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:46:25 Epico
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:46:31 More epico
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:46:46 Press f to doubt
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:46:55 F
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:47:13 In response to the fact that he could take a couple of hits
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:47:41 I can tear through my friends carrier that’s like 15 blocks wide in one shot
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:47:46 Even when I don’t hit fold
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:48:12 Ye just hit a single motor and with mouse it’s pretty easy
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:48:28 And ur opponent is incapacitated
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:49:00 I just bomb a random area and watch the thing fricking explode

plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:56:57 Aeronautical 5, that probably took forever
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:57:41 Longer than my treads ima guess
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:57:50 And mah treads are my hardest build
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 03:58:55 I might put side plating on my tonk tread and see if I can get expert land thingy

plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:17:43 can u show ur heli?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:18:09 mine was a stick but I think I could apply the same shitty engineering I did on mine
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:18:20 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:18:35 ok so the tail rotor
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:18:40 its coaxial right?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:19:02 take the tail rotor and replace it with control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:19:22 have the tail always spinning and set the control surfaces to keybinds u want for the turning
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:19:32 oh
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:19:45 whats the point in doing that though, u cant turn then
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:20:03 oh
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:20:07 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:20:16 can u send a video on whats happening?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:20:31 Im no pro either so dont feel bad
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:22:30 thats pretty poggers
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:23:11 compared to when I build an actual heli with that type of style and only a horizontal stabilieser in the back
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:23:14 thats really
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:23:15 good
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:23:25 mmmm sus
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:24:00 I have done vtol but never really mastered helicopter
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:24:49 the only reason I have heli tech is because I slapped rotors and 1x1 everything on a stick and then placed 3 cameras to meet the block count
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:25:22 guns on the side of barrel
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:25:34 ye a motorlocked 401 block one
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:26:21 I could get a aeronautical engineer 2 but im too lazy to convert from my religion of hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:26:52 lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:26:56 interesting
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:27:01 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:27:05 2400 speed gang
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:27:22 glitched mouse hover drive relegion
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:28:21 I need to upgrade my su 34, since trails are weightless I can do so
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:28:43 and replace 2 half wedges with cameras
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:28:55 upgrade speed and look
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:29:07 you are not
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:29:35 depending on where that control surface is
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:29:49 I almost never use it for that but I use it for motorlocking a lot
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:30:14 I always have control surfaces under the nose where they are connected with half wedges
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:30:23 or on the wings where they are connected by deltas
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:30:56 I got 1.5 ballast which means I could replace with 6 tnt
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:32:29 ok detail edited
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:32:32 now for function
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:33:43 function edited
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:34:13 added 6 mote explosives and replaced an ugly half wedge with a camera
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:34:19 wut
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:34:27 oh
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:34:31 I see wut u mean
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:34:41 well I wouldnt like it
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:34:46 I dont spam weapons
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:34:54 but for things like my motorloc bombs
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:34:57 it would break
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:35:43 I got 6 missiles, like 80 tnt, 44 cutters, and 10 guns on this plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:36:01 w o t
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:36:14 50 missiles?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:36:17 the limit is 12
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:36:19 wtf
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:36:35 ye
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:36:40 12 missiles per build
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:36:44 4 fireworks
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:36:45 999 cutters
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:36:47 10 guns
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:36:54 150 explosives
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:36:57 of each type
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:37:04 2 lava spitters
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:37:09 999
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:39:18 totally not a abuse of pvp weapons
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:39:36 I lined every inch of it with cutters
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:39:41 for maximum damage
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:39:58 I had ballast set to 6 on each motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:40:15 then I did 2.5 ballast and 22 cutters on each motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:40:19 so its the same balance
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:40:58 then I went from 2.5 ballast 22 cutters to 0.75 ballast, 7 explosive blocks, and 22 cutters
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:41:04 still balanced
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:41:07 but most damage
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:41:50 trails are epik
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:41:54 change my mind
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:45:22 https://streamable.com/amdwd5
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:45:58 Not even a direct hit, most of the tnt blew up before but the little aftercharge I added just completely oblitterated it
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:47:06 just straight up murder
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:47:19 idk where?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:47:29 timestamp?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:47:40 oh the weird stuka looking thing
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:47:43 idk
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:47:50 oh lemme see
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:47:55 oh oh oh
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:48:01 thats my glitched mouse setup
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:48:08 w o t
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:48:14 ye
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:48:26 it allows me to roll with my mouse
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:48:36 it gives me essentially variable mouse control
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:48:50 wasd but you can make it variable
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:48:54 what
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:49:04 it epik for dogfight too
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:49:18 <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166>
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:49:35 according to what I have seen, thats false
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:49:45 ok, downsides to wasd
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:49:48 one weakshot
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:49:53 slow down on turn
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:50:01 motor shot
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:50:03 = death
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:50:11 wut
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:50:19 I mean your plane slows
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:50:31 because the drag
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:50:39 there less drag on control surfaces
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:50:58 my wasd planes slow from 400 to 200 in a roll
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:51:02 thats what I mean
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:51:28 ye
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:51:50 https://streamable.com/ntluyy if u call this slow turning...
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:52:11 I can turn fast when I want to
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:52:24 not glitched tho
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:52:31 kinda needs vertical assists
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:52:37 but with it u can turn hella fast
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:53:30 you have insane control
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:53:33 and its variable
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:53:45 so you dont have to have problems making small adjustments
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:53:50 wot
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:53:59 ye
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:54:15 you either sacrifice speed on turn or turn speed
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:54:19 either one isnt good
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:54:30 nah
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:54:37 motor 2 is jerky
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:54:44 you cant make small adustments
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:55:21 Thats what I use
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:55:34 I use glitched mouse with vertical assist
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:55:55 I have been trying to tell him glitched mouse is good for the last 5 mins <:kek:652566605028524033>
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:56:02 keybound elevators
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:56:07 and glitched mouse
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:56:15 I can
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:56:21 thats what I have been saying
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:56:35 but u lose speed
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:56:43 and u can do the same with glitched mouse
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:56:49 BRUH
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:56:54 did u look at my plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:57:08 I literally have keybound elevators that I can use for fast turns
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:57:25 BRUH
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:57:32 you can use motor 2s
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:57:35 on elevators
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:57:56 and have custom elevators/vertical assists and the superior roll of glitched mouse
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:58:09 ^^
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:58:23 imagine not jumping out of seat
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:58:58 the 3 seconds a good glitcehd mouse user has to get into a cockpit is worth the extra manueverablity
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:59:07 I use motor 69
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:59:11 try me nerds
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:59:52 no
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 14:59:59 but u can put elevators at 45 degrees
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:00:05 which gives the same power
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:00:09 plus glitched mouse
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:00:15 which gives more power
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:00:22 Thats what I literally use
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:00:34 nobody uses glitched mouse without elevators
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:01:33 the question is do u?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:01:49 missing out on glitche maus
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:02:29 https://streamable.com/ysopyw
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:02:38 do these rolls with wasd controls
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:03:14 I can get in the air in about 3 seconds
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:03:27 my glitched mouse setup flies away aswell
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:03:39 leaving no weakspots that wasd doesnt have
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:03:48 in fact less weakspots
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:05:47 weird tonk
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:05:55 decorative?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:06:10 U can use like conveyors
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:10:36 Should I make a me 262?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:11:18 I think it would be interesting because all I build is jets, so why not build the first one ever made
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:11:53 weird looking
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:12:06 idrk what it is
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:12:21 oh ok

plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:12:30 so idk
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:12:56 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:23:50 Is powered lock alive now or not?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:24:32 The last update killed motor 2s
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:24:41 The next update I want is a restoration  to em
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:33:55 Me-262 engine prototype
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:34:03 
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:34:08 how is this?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:34:13 for an me 262
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:35:24 ye
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:35:35 umm make a motorloc tower in the middle
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:35:42 the engines are under the wings
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:35:55 make a centeral motorloc in the fuselage
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:36:27 idk
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:36:53 <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:38:38 but ye thats a basic me 262 engine with afterburner sounds and a basic on off reverse assuming that u use 2 of em like on a me 262
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:38:53 pretty sure that would work
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:39:20 I have 3 engines on that
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:39:26 one backwards jet
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:39:35 and then a forward jet and rocket
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:39:51 the rocket and forward jet will be shift ctrl powered
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:40:08 no
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:40:21 rocket and jet are toggled to my speed key
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:40:37 and the backwards jets will be on off only one will be reverse thrust and one will be normal
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:40:59 the reverse thrust one will be y and 0
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:41:10 the non reverse will be h and 0
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:41:35 that way y and h will be forward back for the ground
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:41:57 I have 3 pixel arts, cheems, charmander, and 4 pokemon with a pokeball in the middle
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:42:12 I use backspace and equals
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:42:21 and sometimes minus
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:43:32 I use 0
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:43:44 if I press 0 most times my plane explodes
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:43:52 <:trollface:775024642104229898>

plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:52:31 pitch is up and down
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:52:36 yaw is side to side
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:52:40 roll is the other axis
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:53:10 X is yaw
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 15:53:16 Pitch is Y

plane-crazy 2021-01-22 16:59:22 conveyor can only be welded to piston

plane-crazy 2021-01-22 19:50:54 thats the closest I can get before he closes the shredder
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 19:51:03 which the first image is best view
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 19:51:17 one sec
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 19:52:05 they are weird
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 19:52:21 not as effective as the newer shredders
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 19:52:23 slower
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 19:52:27 yeah that thingy
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 19:52:35 that

plane-crazy 2021-01-22 19:56:43 weird
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 19:56:49 useing suspension
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 19:57:17 I am only using suspension on one tread build
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 19:57:24 and that one is hyper compact
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 19:57:47 only use suspension for tensioning treads if ur gonna build a chassis on it
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 19:57:58 otherwise use motorlock for tension
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 19:58:42 that aint a shredder
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 19:58:47 thats a suicidal jet
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:06:21 I just dipped
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:06:29 I was trying to bomb a swashplate
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:11:03 should I mek me 262?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:11:08 I think I can do it
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:11:20 got a basic jet design off of it
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:12:01 motorloc the two engines, use angled lock for a frontal gear
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:14:25 I guess use angled lock for the tops of the engines aswell to make em kinda a block and a half tall
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:21:56 terra former means like creating like maps and stuff?
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:22:07 good idea
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:22:19 give rick a bunch of map ideas :)

plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:32:53 thats too big brain for me to understand
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:33:13 all I understand that protrode does is tank treads
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:33:32 I cant do suspension, ball turrets, ect

plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:39:20 do things
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:39:38 try pushing a max ballast beam with 1 maxforce as opposed to 2500 maxforce
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:47:08 u cant
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:47:23 it was either a roblox glitch or a code glitch
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:47:37 Its nothibg that you messed up
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:48:07 I dont thunk thats it
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:48:15 It killed roblox servers but not motor 2
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:48:28 it shouldnt have at least
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:48:46 the game updated the same day motor 2 broke
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:50:12 heres what I think
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:51:04 Game update came trying to reduce physics lag > When rick tried to reduce physics lag of motor2 he broke it > Update is released, and motor 2 broken
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:52:26 It doesnt seem like it would frick up toggle lock aswell if it was a roblox update
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:52:34 I mean angle lock
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:52:49 powered lock
plane-crazy 2021-01-22 20:58:16 probably this https://discordapp.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/750855794462949466

plane-crazy 2021-01-24 04:57:48 <@!478052269690978322> can you clarify your suggestion a bit? It kind of seems like carriers and stuff would be extremely useless because there would be fire as soon as you took off
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 04:58:12 Bombs would also be a nightmare because you can’t put ur main pilot on a bomb
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 04:58:33 Oh

plane-crazy 2021-01-24 04:58:49 I use glitched mouse
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 04:59:09 So my main pilot is literally connected to 10 other blocks

the-dump 2021-01-24 05:36:35 Of the same thing
the-dump 2021-01-24 05:36:41 Exactly
the-dump 2021-01-24 05:37:17 Does puri care if he gets pinged?
the-dump 2021-01-24 05:37:55 Rbk MiA tho

the-dump 2021-01-24 05:38:54 He’s already been pinged I think
the-dump 2021-01-24 05:38:58 Never responded
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 05:39:20 Not that way
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 05:39:32 More of like somewhat using the code to ur advantage
plane-crazy 2021-01-24 05:40:02 So the control surfaces are capped by ur main pilot as the seat can’t be upside down
the-dump 2021-01-24 05:40:30 Wait wut

plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:20:52 this is epico
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:22:28 this would be really good for a 6 leg walker
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:22:45 where its all on one shaft and you can do the same on the other side and sync them
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:25:35 <@!511559470376026135> if you are still working on that mech I think this could be the answer
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:26:09 and do the same thing but reverse on the other side and link the two together
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:27:57 what did you do?
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:28:10 I have spent like 3 hours brainstorming this lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:28:19 I have another idea
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:28:21 to sync
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:28:35 so ur legs are like 3x3 at the bottom

plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:29:06 oh
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:29:09 and on the other ide
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:29:11 side
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:29:18 wait this wouldnt work
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:29:20 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:29:59 ye
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:30:11 I saw one mechanism but it used a motor for each leg
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:30:21 so I made that bar to go inbetween them all
plane-crazy 2021-01-25 23:30:26 that way they can sync

plane-crazy 2021-01-28 02:07:01 Pretty simple
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 02:07:12 Just slap a piston with 0 settings
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 02:07:53 And then line hover thrusters that are set to 15 speed 0 drag past the piston pad
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 02:08:21 So the thrusters are facing the piston face
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 02:09:17 Most of the time I got 12-14 hover thrusters or sometimes more depending on the size of the jet
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 02:10:11 I normally motorlock them together so it’s 2 stacks of 7 motorlocked together in front of a piston

plane-crazy 2021-01-28 21:07:27 ima test the new ideas I had on hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 21:07:53 so putting it in a weird setup doesnt work but what if I put it in a jet
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 21:12:55 ok its laggy for some reason
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 21:13:08 not pog
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 21:20:35 <@!527653676022628353> you seemed interested in the hover drive experiment, I figured out that lock off, toggle on, distance 1.5, maxforce 2500 is best for hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 21:21:01 Im not sure if that will work in things where there is like a trail motorlocked into the piston
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 21:41:07 finally upgraded my su 34 hover drive setup
plane-crazy 2021-01-28 21:42:25 on my non motorlocked planes its easy

plane-crazy 2021-01-29 03:20:43 Trees means multiple trees
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 03:21:02 Therefore it is appropriate to use trees not tree’s

plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:07:25 depending on the shredder
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:07:38 if it was a basic one, then it would be taken down
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:07:54 if it was a custom it would stay up but be mass downvoted

plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:14:36 as someone who has more than 45 shredder kills under my belt I think I can take him
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:14:55 not to mention I am far more manueverable and can go twice as fast
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:15:09 Im talking about air to air dogfighting shredders
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:15:19 I have killed another 100 with my turret
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:15:24 at least
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:15:32 lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:15:43 plane v shredder im talking

plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:16:24 lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:17:16 I wanna clap him so hard
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:17:27 I was in his pvp server once
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:17:35 he doesnt use hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:17:51 which is an ew for someone who fights shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:18:09 as I have seen shredders that go faster than what his planes do
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:18:17 they can go fricking 700 sps
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:18:32 and hes screwed if any of those get on his trail
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:18:37 ye
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:18:54 oh
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:19:00 the vectored thrust ones
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:19:14 I saw a weird ass vectored thrust box
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:19:26 it has like 10 turrets on each side of the box
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:19:33 rockets attached to the turret
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:20:09 ?
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:20:24 shredders are outdated
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:20:32 the vectored thrust turret rockets
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:20:41 are the new powerful enemy
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:20:51 show
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:21:28 I have a clip of one
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:21:34 of vectored thrust box
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:21:38 but idk if I can find it
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:21:58 it uses 0 grav without bobux
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:22:12 turrets on each side
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:22:18 so its essentially weightless
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:22:24 and it just zooms around
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:22:30 rockets on the turrets
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:22:34 so its mouse controlled
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:22:38 but it has rockets
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:22:41 not cutters
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:22:44 and its faster
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:22:49 and more manueverable
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:23:28 yes
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:23:30 far stronger
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:23:40 shredders are quite weak in my opinion
plane-crazy 2021-01-29 20:24:43 idk

plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:22:28 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:22:36 I show a picture of a plane
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:22:45 yeah im totally making a hotel elevator
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:23:01 yeah like that
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:23:04 elevators
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:25:29 ugh
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:25:38 death cube so bad
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:25:46 its literally a shredder but worse
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:25:51 more annoying
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:25:56 because it has fricking turrets
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:28:36 Can someone align this to a blueprint?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:29:05 because its a build with zero detail meant to piss everyone else in pvp off and it takes absolutely no skill to operate
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:30:14 A more accurate question is why is it good
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:30:32 what skills do u need, moving a mouse and pressing 2 buttons?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:30:50 it literally follows ur mouse
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:31:06 and all you need is 2 buttons, on off thrust, and fire rockets
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:31:13 it follows ur mouse
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:31:23 all u need to press for movement is fricking w
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:31:41 U wanna fight
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:31:48 jet vs shredder cube
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:32:14 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:32:14 bruh
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:32:21 jet vs turret cube

plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:33:23 what do u suggest?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:33:37 I suck at building lol
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:33:39 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:33:47 the elevators or the main wing itself?
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:34:28 lmfao
plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:48:41 hmmmm

plane-crazy 2021-01-30 20:50:29 HMMMM
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 20:07:27 Why such a wide fold?
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 20:07:57 8 mb*
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 20:08:55 100 mb upload is for servers with 30 nitro boosts
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 20:08:57 It’s 8 base
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 20:09:06 And 50 for servers that have 15 boosts
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 20:09:44 Oh ye I see
plane-crazy 2021-01-31 20:10:11 Ikr
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:01:55 pc
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:02:04 better one atleast
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:02:12 can't cri
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:03:20 whenever anyone says this, I cringe internally. Wings panels at least for me have never been the problem. In fact the more wings the less stable it is
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:04:53 for me, up and down means too many wing panels and side to side/completely having a seisure is too much vertical stabiliser
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:05:22 yes, or just use hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:05:39 or if u gonna be a real chad motorlock hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:05:49 but ur plane will most likely have a seisure
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:06:00 kinda a glitch engine
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:06:20 it uses hover thruster to create insane speed
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:06:38 a powerful setup takes up 16 blocks
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:06:52 but that will get u to about 2000 or more speed
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:07:02 so ye
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:07:28 ye
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:07:33 with a good enough pc
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:07:38 almost any plane can do that
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:08:03 for me, a laptop user, I am limited to one very stable plane that can hit that speed without glitching
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:10:01 but most of my jets can hit 1500 for short bursts without lagging
plane-crazy 2021-02-02 03:10:32 only one that I have is really unstable

the-dump 2021-02-04 03:43:59 Pretty sure he’s joking but ye
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:45:58 Bruh
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:46:00 It’s 5 sides
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:46:51 Show
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:47:13 Both fireworks and ladders are 5 side weld boxes
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:48:26 Where is the firework?
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:48:49 Well ye
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:49:14 Wait hol up
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:49:31 5
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:49:53 The only side they don’t weld to is the front where it shoots
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:50:03 Idk
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:50:49 Did ladder hitbox commit death?
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:51:00 I’m confused
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:51:38 Hmm
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:51:41 I’m confused
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:51:48 Because those two should weld
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:52:02 I’m on mobile so gimme a sec
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:54:33 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:54:41 They got a 4 way weld box
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:54:46 As I conclude
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:55:14 The top one is broken
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:56:16 <@!530791063015784455> try rotating them 90 degrees in the way that they are still facing the right direction
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:56:27 For some reason the top side doesn’t weld
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 03:56:43 So if u move that to the side, it’s no longer a issue
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 13:49:42 what is it?
plane-crazy 2021-02-04 13:50:05 ok

plane-crazy 2021-02-08 03:35:20 Apparently it’s patched
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 03:43:46 It was a script that could copy anyone’s build in a few seconds
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 03:44:26 My builds were so bad that I just went in there and horassed him because I knew he wouldn’t copy
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 03:45:30 I just started slapping him with a yeet machine that took 15 min to make
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 03:46:54 Yeah maybe
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 03:47:01 I used wedges though
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 03:47:22 And I was noob when make
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 03:47:26 So I was slow
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 03:47:44 <:trollface:775024642104229898>

plane-crazy 2021-02-08 03:58:08 How did he survive this
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:13:37 Lol yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:17:34 Does anyone know how the guy makes this turn?

plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:17:50 That isn’t my jet but a watcher of our dogfight
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:18:17 I wanna know how the blue plane does like a drift turn
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:18:32 It wasn’t vert tho
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:18:46 I knocked off his rudder early in fight
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:18:54 And it’s not thrust vector
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:19:08 The one that pulled a 250 g turn
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:19:16 The dark dark blue plane
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:19:32 The plane that took the clip was a bystander
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:19:49 I was a random cyan plane that zipped through the background at one point
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:20:18 But what
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:20:23 Ya
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:20:34 I’m confused
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:20:40 He was flat, not sideways
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:20:49 So it wasn’t vert
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:20:52 He was flat
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:21:50 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/773721895941963807/808181285214224404/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:21:55 That’s the plane
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:22:02 Idk how he did it
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:22:07 Not mine
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:22:33 Different paint
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:22:48 Not very
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:23:09 Oh wait the rudder, I’m pretty sure it’s a fixed stabilizer
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:23:12 So no rudder
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:23:38 As most of us glitched mouse users are
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:24:07 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:25:01 Yeah, I see now
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:25:11 He does a lot of cobras and crap during dogfight
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:25:29 I just anchor whenever he does a stall and then hit him when he’s going slow
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:26:00 Or take it in close corners at lower speeds where I can outmaneuver him due to canards
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:26:07 What
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:40:44 Fuel tank or bomb?
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:45:52 Lmao
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:46:18 I think I know what armament ima put on this thing
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:46:30 4 missiles on wings
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 04:46:42 And swap the fuel tanks for cluster bombs
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:21:36 Wait they patched copy and paste script?
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:22:44 What
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:23:10 Was it patched or what?
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:23:21 Plane crazy copy and paste
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:23:38 Wait u have script?
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:23:52 Mobile
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:23:56 😢
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:24:08 Idk I was just reading chat above
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:24:25 I saw no more copy and paste large pieces of building
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:24:35 And I am wondering if the script broke
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:25:06 No
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:25:12 There is a script
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:25:21 Prototrode made it
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:25:46 https://youtube.com/watch?v=3RQ8it-ZDjA&feature=share
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:25:57 Watch the start
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:25:59 U will see
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:26:14 I’m pretty sure it copies blocks over an axis
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:26:40 Like a reflection tool but it keeps the previous blocks
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:27:24 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:27:40 Someone said that got patched farther up in chat, idk tho
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:28:00 Idek, prototrode is a mastermind
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 13:30:12 How did darkbobby25 not end up in <#490306593242611742> I wonder

plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:07:06 I do
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:07:18 the point of hovers is that its variable power
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:07:38 my jets can go 2400, 1500, 1000, 500, even like 300
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:07:46 hovers give variable power
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:07:49 which is why I like
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:07:53 yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 15:08:08 but if u get on ur opponents 6 going the same speed, its good

plane-crazy 2021-02-08 17:24:21 yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 17:24:29 it does change weight
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 17:24:44 try putting one metal block and one fabric block on a balance

plane-crazy 2021-02-08 18:14:52 no matter where they were on the plane
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 18:15:01 it resulted in lacking controls and inverted control
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 18:15:03 hella gay

plane-crazy 2021-02-08 18:17:15 glitched mouse is superior
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 18:17:51 I have held out hour long dogfights against someone with a faster and better turning plane than me
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 18:19:30 ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-08 18:19:54 but when the enemy isn't a 9 year old with a build that goes 300, what happens?

plane-crazy 2021-02-09 02:54:11 Corner wedge has one corner raised
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 02:54:19 The one I’m talking about has 3 raised
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 02:54:28 I forgot name
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 02:55:16 Frick I forgot name
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 02:58:06 No, it’s like a block but one corner is dipped to the ground
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 02:58:14 Does anyone know what that’s called?

plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:03:55 Yeah it’s inner wedge
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:04:12 Is there a half inner wedge up?
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:04:21 Oh wait I can test

plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:08:51 Use streamable
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:09:12 It’s a website <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:09:32 Literally just upload a file to it and then copy and paste the link
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:10:52 Are the rotors at the wrong angles?
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:11:06 Hmm wot
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:11:14 It’s not a 3 bladed
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:11:33 Are they like spinning at the wrong speeds?
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:12:13 So it’s one spinning 25 and the other spinning 50 in the opposite direction right?
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:12:35 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:12:47 And they are spinning opposite directions right?
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:12:57 Hmmm
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:13:25 Are the motors all max torque 1000?
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:13:36 Do that
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:14:01 1000 will help at least
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:14:15 When u start getting to pitching the blades it will
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:14:20 Even if it doesn’t solve now
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:15:11 Mm
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:15:17 Probably too much spinning
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 03:15:36 With a larger base it should work

plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:55:22 They are
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:55:41 I just use a weird setup in my hovers
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:55:45 It boosts power
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:56:36 There are 2 slight things that would give u the slightest hint
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:57:05 Ok nvm there’s 1
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:57:12 No, that’s
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:57:29 Just got custom wedges on front
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:58:44 There is one small small detail u can see in the vid
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 02:59:14 And it’s not on the underside of the plane
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:00:05 No
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:00:28 I just configured it in a way that it indicates when I go stealth or not
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:01:15 It’s somewhat a part as it’s tied to the stealth but it doesn’t help in pulling it off
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:02:00 Nope but correct detail
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:02:31 I’m trying to eradicate that as it’s hella annoying, I think I know how, don’t have time rn
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:02:52 Wym
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:07:55 Oh that’s what u mean
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:08:12 I’m trying to eradicate it
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:08:46 Huh
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:09:02 Ummm i thought it was fine in the first place
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:15:16 No
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:15:19 Far smaller
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:16:04 Nop
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:16:19 It is
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:16:43 There is another small part out the top of that wedge, but it’s white
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:17:09 Yes, I am unable to paint it
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:17:13 Which is hella gay
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:17:53 I painted the parts of the same block around it but I was unable to paint that part
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:18:29 Well I could do that
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:18:36 But I mean that’s kinda gay
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:19:08 I’d rather fix it and not have a stick sticking out of my plane as opposed to paint it over
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:19:36 Helium isn’t a stick
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:20:28 I will say that it’s clipped into the body
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:20:53 Another part of that block is showing but it’s painted over so it’s hard to see
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:21:39 But I don’t want gray plane
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:21:44 That gray is so boring
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:21:55 And also ima fix
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:22:21 By moving it around so I can do it without interfering with hovers and not have it stick out at the same time
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:22:27 No
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:22:35 No
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:23:39 Bye
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:23:48 You are close
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:23:57 Very close
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:24:40 No
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:24:45 Ye
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:25:15 The block is noclipped into a normal wedge
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:25:30 So it is sticking out a bit more than a half block range
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:25:41 And is smack dab in the middle of said wedge
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:25:59 You were close but piston is too long
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 03:26:23 It’s not desynk that causes it

plane-crazy 2021-02-10 18:40:51 older servers are still vulnerable
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 18:41:47 the script is a computer file

plane-crazy 2021-02-10 19:46:52 for some designs you can use a cutter instead of a block and get a more variable camo

plane-crazy 2021-02-10 19:48:19 like this
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 19:48:53 as long as theres blocks or wedges on each side, u can put a cutter in the middle and paint half of it instead of motorlocking 2 half blocks together
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 19:49:43 on the underside it looks like this
plane-crazy 2021-02-10 19:55:06 is ur group like a pvp thing or just good builds?

plane-crazy 2021-02-11 15:27:58 I think just slap ladders on the sides of a 1x1 block
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 15:28:27 the build box is 3 wide but in spawn they will be like 1.3
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 15:35:37 ur hating the entire server if ur using a lag machine
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 15:35:53 thats what I got from the chat above
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 15:36:09 thats bull
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 15:36:26 theres no way that they can patch lag machines
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 15:36:36 they would shut down some innocents builds by doing that
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 15:36:49 ye
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 15:37:02 theres no way to make an AI to target specific builds
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 15:37:07 without having bycatch
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 15:37:14 which would prolly shut down some big builds
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 15:37:54 but I mean some other builds have that
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 15:38:25 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 15:38:32 not many people use balls for lag machines tho
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 15:38:43 most are engine spams or lag bombs
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 15:38:52 both of which are nearly impossible to patch
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 15:39:18 ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 15:40:43

plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:28:54 put helium on the top of the seat
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:29:04 and ballast at the bottom
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:30:09 u need to power thrm
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:30:17 or the wheel wont spin
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:30:28 how is he gonna move if the motors are unpowered
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:31:51 does this look decent?
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:33:25 what do u suggest?
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:35:22 starters?
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:35:41 what are starters
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:35:58 oh wait
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:35:59 nvm
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:36:04 figure of speech
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:36:06 ye
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:36:07 <:kek:652566605028524033>
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:36:16 where do I use that though?
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:37:09 just a half block?
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:43:34 wym by motorlock this down?
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:44:27 I tried replacing with half blocks
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:44:38 oh wait
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:44:42 I see what u mean
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:44:46 I see what u mean
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:44:56 but how to make that work with motor 2 cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:45:09 yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:45:25 except
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:45:35 its kinda hard to motorlock that area more
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:46:03 same
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:46:09 thats why I cheese grater
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:47:12 what
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:47:29 g l i t c h e d  m o u s e
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:48:13 but u can do everything there with glitched mouse assists too
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:48:30 assists
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:49:45 I need piston cockpit if I do ur strategy
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:50:06 and even then its nearly impossible as the piston would weld into the half wedge
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:52:30 I have idea
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:55:36 I got idea
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:57:11 \
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:57:36 bru
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:58:05 it opens fine
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:58:09 doesn't wanna close tho
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:58:33 because piston seisure
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 16:58:42 they don't like motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 17:02:44 had the same issue but the cockpit doesn't open because shorter piston length
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 17:03:01 because
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 17:03:06 I wanna motorlock down
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 17:03:10 but have open
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 17:03:17 so I can use glitched mouse

plane-crazy 2021-02-11 17:21:08 frick u rickje
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 17:21:36 in what reality is a half piston taller than half block
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 17:22:46 I had to add a second piston in order to make it so I can get in without the tnt toggle lock
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 17:22:55 RyanPerson1972

plane-crazy 2021-02-11 17:24:46 hella gay
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 17:25:31 then I don't get enough movement to get in cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 17:25:38 so I had to use half piston
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 17:25:42 and that happend
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 17:26:04 I have to do this

plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:23:43 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:24:22 no
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:24:34 nothing external
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:24:39 just abusing a glitch
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:25:00 its not really teleportation but looks like it on others screen
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:25:18 its glitch
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:25:39 I freeze on others screens but I can move freely
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:25:56 its a bug
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:26:01 u can't toggle server lag
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:26:21 and it works on any server
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:29:32 its not I swear to god
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:29:36 I glitch a block out
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:29:46 and it freezes me until I press said key again
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:29:57 no its a glitch with a block
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:31:04 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/808808947745292289/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384021699466756107/808808972110659584/unknown.png
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:31:13 this isn't a server glitch
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:31:39 it makes me invis and freezes stuff like pistons and sometimes motors/control surfaces where I was
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:32:19 but then I can fly free but the game registers me as at that area for other players, but for me I am flying around
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:32:46 when I retoggle key, what others see teleports to my actual location and I appear again
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:33:13 its weird
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:33:23 those pistons are for hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:33:38 yes
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:33:50 if they attack ur frozen state, they can hurt u
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:34:03 but they can't hurt the actual area where ur invis
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:34:29 thats why I go up to 20000 altitude going 2000+, stealth, and then go back down
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:34:38 u mean like player?
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:34:48 I am not sure
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:35:05 for some reason sometimes I go completely invis no frozen version at all
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:35:13 sometimes control surfaces glitch
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 18:35:21 sometimes my entire plane freezes for others

plane-crazy 2021-02-11 19:07:50 this is a RQ-180
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 19:08:11 This is X-47B
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 19:08:18 not completely
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 19:08:33 its more of the F/A-XX
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 19:08:38 as opposed to neuron
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 19:08:54 eh I mean kinda eggish
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 19:09:30 
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 19:09:35 compare the two planes
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 19:09:50 they are the same design but one is a fighter one is a UAV
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 19:10:00 and the cockpit of F/A is a intake
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 19:10:11 but the wing shape is nearly the same
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 19:10:31 thats the one from ace combat tho
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 19:10:39 the MQ-101
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 19:10:55 we were talking abt X-47B I thought
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 19:11:16 MQ-101 is close to nuron X-47B is close to F/A-XX
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 19:13:00 can I just point out that like a ton of UAVs are fly wing?
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 19:13:48 woah wtf
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 19:14:07 thats kinda cool
plane-crazy 2021-02-11 19:14:17 but in no way shape or form is a fighter

plane-crazy 2021-02-13 19:41:13 Umm there’s a few reasons for this, it can be solved by increasing wing area but that is kinda unhelpful in your situation, other ways is putting ballast at the back, I have like a ballast set to 4 at the back of all my jets and that almost eliminates it. Also put control surfaces at the nose as it can increase stability and improve maneuverability at the same time

plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:09:10 Is it motorlocked
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:09:12 ?
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:09:27 Can u show a build mode pic
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:09:47 Ok, you can shove a ton in there at the cost of some lag then
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:10:07 You what
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:11:07 Why do your motors face down?
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:11:13 For hover drive
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:11:35 Why?
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:12:00 Can’t u make them facing in though?
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:12:19 My friend has 2000 hours in terraria
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:14:25 Why do so many people use motors for hover drives?
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:14:48 I only use motors in 1 occasion, when I’m motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:15:18 If I motorlock drives into blocks I use them instead of pistons
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:15:32 Talking about for hover drives
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:15:48 I have a trick that can max out power on a hover drive with piston
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:16:04 More powerful than motor
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:16:16 And also the fact that it resembles a block is nice at times
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:17:24 And in all my builds I literally use 3 motors base if I don’t do any motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:17:34 Just 3 motor 2s
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:22:23 Umm
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 20:22:25 Wut

plane-crazy 2021-02-13 21:04:38 I am trying to run plen craz on shitty shitty wifi
plane-crazy 2021-02-13 21:05:15 I’m using a hotspot in an area where there is almost no cell service
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 03:07:24 the j
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 17:22:26 Are there like any pvp clubs for plen craz? Ik there’s like good builder clubs but how about pvp?
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 17:23:20 Astronot
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 17:23:25 Why can’t they?
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 17:23:42 And military clubs can?
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 17:23:48 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 17:24:05 How did borchuna and stuff get so popular?
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 17:25:39 Servers that are like clubs for people with good builds
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 17:27:01 From what I heard borchuna and stuff have like a couple hundred members
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 17:27:15 They are private ones and people join through recruiters

plane-crazy 2021-02-14 18:01:52 Same bro
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 18:02:21 But I have other problems, my planes look like crap but have secrets
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 18:02:38 Thankfully I don’t think copy scripts can copy those secrets
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 18:03:41 I’m 90% sure that’s gamer Thailand
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 18:03:57 He’s really bad but copies yt builds flawlessly
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 18:04:27 It’s hard to copy entire builds off of like 3 views of said build
plane-crazy 2021-02-14 18:04:40 Especially when it’s a just rens quality motorlock build

plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:19:58 aircobra is superior
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:52:39 What jet should I make?
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:53:06 I was thinking scorpion
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:55:40 Should I make?
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:55:49 Aight
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:55:59 I think Ik how to do the intakes here
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:56:15 Either 2 fireworks as round intakes or jet engines
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:56:32 Ya
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:57:01 Ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:58:13 Hm ok
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:58:40 I use classic nose design and then shove jet engines in corners?
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:58:53 Ye that should work
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 02:58:57 But how to do nose
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 03:00:14 Ball is always fricked up tho
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 03:01:55 For the rocket pods I guess I use fireworks and maybe motorlock sparklers in there if I’m felling like a chad
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 03:05:57 e

plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:12:08 still?
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:12:23 I just made them rlly long as opposed to where they were <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:12:35 ok

plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:18:55 yeah ik
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:19:05 im testing different designs for comparing
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:19:24 the right is what I originally had and the left is what im doing based on suggestions from here
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:19:38 mirage monday
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:21:59 this one seems like the best one so far right?
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:22:20 made it a block longer than my previous wing
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:22:37 gonna convert other side and then stop fucking with the wings
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:22:51 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:24:08 end wing design
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:26:19 ok now for elevators and vert
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:26:27 yah
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:26:39 of what?
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:26:48 oh its a rank
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:27:11 if u get expert u get access to #colours or something
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:27:34 otherwise u just get different shades of blue and purple from the earlier ranks
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:39:10 **CHEESE**

plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:54:15 GIVE ME MORE SPEED
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:57:51 w h a t
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 16:59:48 hover engine doesn't kill servo
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:03:51 I need to slap more power in my egg
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:04:12 I have 13 thrusters and thats all I can fit so far without doing a nono
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:04:21 then I use cracked hover tech
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:04:33 and motorlock motors into the center of the drive
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:04:42 which also increases le power output
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:09:06 u do hover drive nono
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:09:32 motorlocking thrusters together
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:09:35 big nono
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:11:55 idk magnet
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:11:59 conveyor hates motorlock
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:12:11 and there isn't an inch where ur plane isnt motorlocked
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:12:18 try a lower hover setup
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:12:35 where u don't double up the thrusters
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:13:00 ok

plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:17:23 just hover <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:18:09 I did nono with hover
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:18:13 to get that
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:18:21 normally max is like 2300
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:18:35 but to hit those speeds with nono hover I am highly unstable
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:22:21 kinda hard
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:22:30 conventional planes make it hard
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:22:49 I feel like stealth fighters are easy to make fast
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:23:04 because they are literal pancakes with big areas
plane-crazy 2021-02-15 17:23:08 to put drives

plane-crazy 2021-02-25 03:33:54 Absolutely nothing
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 03:34:15 And anyways I use an augmented setup so destroying said seat is impossible
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 03:35:23 It depends on how it hits. If u destroy the seat, nothing, if u destroy the anchor itself, and the seat fell over. Then my plane would spiral out of control until I hit the flip button
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 03:35:35 And ur not gonna be able to
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 03:35:44 Nothing

plane-crazy 2021-02-25 03:36:13 If the pilot is destroyed,  Otho g happens
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 03:36:20 Nothing*
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 03:36:39 If u precision fire just on the anchor, u can affect them tho
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 03:37:07 I yeet my own pilot seat off all the time
plane-crazy 2021-02-25 03:37:10 It does nothing

plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:48:50 <:PauseChamp:801105292800426004>
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:48:57 Wym
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:49:06 Inside as opposed to on top
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:49:12 They aren’t motorlocked together?
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:49:28 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:49:35 Then it’s just sheer block count
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:49:49 And/or moving parts count killing ur physics
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:49:53 And causing lag
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:51:31 Laughs in I5 laptop
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:52:10 I got 12gb of ram or smthn but it runs horrible
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:52:54 Yes now go past the quadrillions
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:54:18 What if u filled entire plot with helium?
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:54:31 How fast would u commit I wonder
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:55:04 Like inf speed fast?
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:55:09 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:56:00 U have 10k helium
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:56:54 When there no material glitch in helium
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:56:58 <a:cri:811321306644742194>
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:57:46 Ooh
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:57:55 But what if flip?
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:58:11 Wait if u just slap it on bottom
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:58:45 Wot
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:59:16 More
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:59:29 If more or less helium would go faster
plane-crazy 2021-03-02 23:59:46 <:smallbrain:744403534954364988>
plane-crazy 2021-03-03 00:00:11 Would 1 helium block rise faster than a whole plot would
plane-crazy 2021-03-03 00:00:21 Or vice versa
plane-crazy 2021-03-03 00:01:38 What if I macro in a priv while afking to make sure I don’t time out
plane-crazy 2021-03-03 00:01:47 Would I get inf speed eventually?

plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:08:25 Glitched mouse?
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:08:50 It allows u to maneuver plane via mouse
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:08:58 Ayo that’s pog
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:09:38 <@!368581738496131072> do u need help with glitched mouse or were u wondering what it was?
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:09:57 Alr
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:12:34 It’s a abuse of control surface coding
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:13:14 Control surfaces are programmed to keep main pilot straight up, by removing main pilot, control surfaces have no limits
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:13:47 Place main pilot outside plane and replace with pilot
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:13:51 Fly from pilot
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:14:03 Mhm
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:14:10 There are different setups
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:14:34 But the most common one is just main pilot attached to a anchor outside the plane
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:32:02 No, it just makes it so trolls don’t knock it down
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:32:59 Glitchy as hell
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:33:09 They just yeet u around
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:33:15 Wheels or treads
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:33:40 Wheels
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:33:46 Treads are laggy aswell
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:37:22 Image role
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:37:51 And conveyors have a ton of drag/friction so even replacing with ice won’t do much
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:39:29 Even if ur not spamming conveyors
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:39:31 https://youtu.be/sCUsz2xp6e0
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:39:37 It glitches out in other ways
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:39:54 <@!750846285627785237>
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:40:13 Well it will be
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:40:23 <:what:644996672048463942>
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:40:36 It might be with conveyor wedge?
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:41:02 Just use custom wheels
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:41:11 Or send me a pic in dms and I can see the issue
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:53:54 Wait, do guns penetrate through tnt and not just damage or does the tnt stop bullets completely?
plane-crazy 2021-03-22 01:55:34 Damn

plane-crazy 2021-04-23 21:48:35 How are these for specs on a pvp jet? I am too lazy to retype
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 21:50:15 Builder's name: <@!680035569023451146>  / RyanPerson1972
Vehicle Name: Saab 37 (Speed Mod)(Post because roblox physics became pog again)
Dimensions: Length: 19    Height: 6.5 (not including armament which is 7)   Width: 13 
Weapons: 1x8 gun stack and one gun on each side (internal) / 6 wing mounted rockets / 4 top mounted fireworks
Engine: Quad hover setup (16 pads total)
Top Speed: 2300sps
Maneuverability: High
Block Count: 318
Tech: Tally's witchcraft / Optimized glitched mouse setup
Active/Retired: Active
Extra Notes: Given that this mod is still relatively stable, I may add more hovers to increase speed further. Removed two internal rockets due to issues with the canards jamming (Now doesn't jam).
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 21:50:19 ok there
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 21:51:11 depends on target
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 21:51:19 specs on pvp jet, asking if its good
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 21:51:50 for attacking I prefer to be below 1k
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 21:51:53 almost always
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 22:05:23 It didn't revert totally to where it was before they reverted the original update but still its good
plane-crazy 2021-04-23 22:08:44 I could fly this thing really stable before they took back the first update https://streamable.com/w451oz
the-dump 2021-04-26 14:49:26 oh ok

plane-crazy 2021-09-11 01:59:00 anyone know why I can't get into seats after getting out of them?
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 01:59:43 straight up can't get in, I could like 2 days ago
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 01:59:51 I tried replacing the seat
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 01:59:54 reseting
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 02:00:04 alr
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 02:01:18 yeah that worked
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 02:01:54 but its not working in pvp...
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 02:03:16 I am so confused
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 02:03:32 In normal lobbies it works
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 02:03:59 but in pvp it just doesn't work
plane-crazy 2021-09-11 02:05:05 ok, 4th lobby it worked
general 2022-03-19 19:12:43 e
plane-crazy 2022-03-19 21:59:20 for the robotic specialist role, can small propellers be used to turn the walker
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 03:56:23 someone please give me a relatively simple looking, but large plane
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 03:56:29 or a bomber
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:29:43 What is a large bomber that I should make
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:29:53 I want some form of strategic bomber in my Arsenal
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:30:29 Oh hey, my treads actually work for terrain specialist
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:30:51 Despite the fact that they are literally meant to lag and kill players who ram me
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:43:29 How many blocks is a foot
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:43:34 Just a random question
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:44:08 ~~smk do be longer tho~~
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:47:19 Oh ok
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:47:21 Understandable
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:48:02 Was the X-15 actually supposed to carry payload? On one of the schematics I saw Payload Bay, but I can’t find anything else abt it
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:48:55 I was thinking like a single disconnector bomb or some shit lmao
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:49:15 Since it’s such a small space
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:50:10 The only time that happens to me is when unlocked motors go under extreme stress
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:50:14 And glitch the fuck out
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:50:31 Are you trying to do stages
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:50:39 Where you rotate parts
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:51:14 Are the motors moving the parts unlocked?
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:51:44 If the moved parts are being put into the build
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:51:51 You need to lock the motor rotating those parts
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:52:09 Seems kinda smol
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:52:31 Oh wait your not the Kv-1 guy
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:52:37 Idk how large your tank is gonna be
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:52:47 It looks ok but just seems small for your typical tank
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:52:52 Yeah
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:53:21 Oh
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:53:35 Do motor 2s still have seizures if they have motorlock on them
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:54:18 No, like motorlocked parts put on motor 2s
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:55:02 Like if I lock 6 motors together and those are on top of a motor 2
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:55:06 Seizure begins
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:55:37 Hm
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:55:40 It used to happen
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:55:45 Glad it’s fixed
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 14:55:54 Been like a year since I have played plen craz
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:11:21 needs more rotation on the nose
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:11:28 like more than 2 cone pieces
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:11:54 maybe 3 or 4 if you want really smooth
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:12:01 or just no gaps
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:13:12 I cant really talk about smoothness tho because all my builds are simple and meant for pvp
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:13:23 as simple as I can make them
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:13:31 while still making them look half decent
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:14:23 literally all that motorlock is so I can center that engine and make no gaps for motor 2s in the canards
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:17:45 depends which mechanic
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 15:17:48 motorlock, yes
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 22:18:50 Should I make a 6 legged tank looking thing
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 22:20:06 If I make the turret 400 blocks or more, I can qualify for expert robotic specialist
plane-crazy 2022-03-20 22:20:20 I already have the chassis
the-dump 2022-03-21 00:00:19 
general 2022-06-13 23:23:27 Yeah that’s happening
general 2022-06-13 23:23:37 Mf said I won 0.82 BTC
general 2022-06-13 23:24:31 You want me to send? I already sent to an admin
general 2022-06-13 23:24:59 A scam bot
general 2022-06-13 23:26:05 Cry about it?
general 2022-06-13 23:28:04 Is a 1 block wide plane a thing
general 2022-06-13 23:28:14 Actively shutting the fuck up
general 2022-06-13 23:29:18 I’m pretty sure all of my pvp planes are shorter than 25 blocks
general 2022-06-13 23:29:28 Maybe except my draken
general 2022-06-13 23:32:20 https://tenor.com/view/epic-embed-fail-ryan-gosling-cereal-embed-failure-laugh-at-this-user-gif-20627924
general 2022-06-13 23:33:38 Why did my embed die
general 2022-06-13 23:33:42 I have image perms lmao
general 2022-06-13 23:34:11 Oh they changed it?
general 2022-06-13 23:34:25 I haven’t been on this server for like 6 months lmao
general 2022-06-13 23:35:55 I could get robotic specialist but my detail work would bar me from getting the upvotes
plane-crazy 2022-06-13 23:40:11 To increase speed of my draken, should I motorlock more hover thrusters in or reduce wing area
