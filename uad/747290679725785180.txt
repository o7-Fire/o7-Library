general 2022-06-28 11:16:50 How do I counter shredders
general 2022-06-28 11:17:07 I've thought of an idea
general 2022-06-28 11:17:13 Similar to the Israel's iron dome
general 2022-06-28 11:17:31 It's just smaller shredders
general 2022-06-28 11:17:42 But should only be used at shredders
general 2022-06-28 11:17:56 Something like a cluster bomb I think
the-dump 2022-06-28 11:19:23 Bro this is every movie when someone dies
the-dump 2022-06-28 11:59:11 Simp
the-dump 2022-06-28 11:59:21 Nvm, the word is getting kinda cringe
general 2022-06-28 12:38:27 Bro the recoil
general 2022-06-28 14:10:05 What glitch is more game breaking than the shredder?
general 2022-06-28 14:10:08 But I'm only using it
general 2022-06-28 14:10:14 To counter other shredders
general 2022-06-28 14:10:59 54kg can break an autistic squid
general 2022-06-28 14:12:27 You need to open your eyes
general 2022-06-28 14:12:31 And learn how to read
general 2022-06-28 14:13:20 Imma start looking for possible ways to stop a shredder, see wich idea works best, and make a few iterations
general 2022-06-28 14:13:35 My IQ
general 2022-06-28 14:13:37 I'd about 110
general 2022-06-28 14:13:53 I'll list that idea
general 2022-06-28 14:14:02 I'll take bout 3 ideas
general 2022-06-28 14:14:16 300 is enough to kill someone
general 2022-06-28 14:14:23 30mm tank?

general 2022-06-28 14:16:24 So how does the conveyer drive work?
general 2022-06-28 14:16:46 If it has enough radius to catch or stop a shredder, then it's good
general 2022-06-28 14:17:28 How much speed?
general 2022-06-28 14:17:51 Btw these people are using UFO's and spawnkilling
general 2022-06-28 14:18:02 UFO's are a WW2 German thing
general 2022-06-28 14:18:18 So these people are nut Z's
general 2022-06-28 14:18:56 Has anyone made a SU-72 in plane crazy already?

general 2022-06-28 14:25:05 Cuz it's a damn revolver
general 2022-06-28 15:30:34 And ammunition explosion inside tanks
general 2022-06-28 15:31:09 And I think the cobra maneuver works

general 2022-06-29 02:02:47 U need to put on a very weird grip, make it like a bolt action rifle or straight pull, and it's very expensive
general 2022-06-29 02:03:27 Lager PO8
general 2022-06-29 03:16:20 Just had a dream of a liminal rooms
general 2022-06-29 03:16:48 So what it looked like
general 2022-06-29 03:17:04 It's a corridor with some rooms that gets progressively smaller
general 2022-06-29 05:53:34 I quite found a few
general 2022-06-29 05:53:41 The streets here at night is very empty
general 2022-06-29 05:53:44 And so are the houses
general 2022-06-29 05:53:53 Alot of house here are empty
general 2022-06-29 05:54:22 I remember something like a warehouse or mall, but I forgot
general 2022-06-29 05:54:39 But liminal spaces are always familiar, so I don't think I did see it in the first place
general 2022-06-29 05:58:00 🤨
general 2022-06-29 05:59:00 Make a SR-72
general 2022-06-29 05:59:19 And actual Mach 10
general 2022-06-29 05:59:52 Mach 7 in Roblox is 2,625 studs per second
general 2022-06-29 06:00:31 Oh
general 2022-06-29 06:00:44 In the movie It got Mach 10
general 2022-06-29 06:00:47 But it's just movie
general 2022-06-29 06:01:41 So how u do this is "Mach Speed = Feet ÷ 3"
general 2022-06-29 06:01:50 1 real feet is 3 studs
general 2022-06-29 06:03:03 Like Mach 1 is 1125 feet per second
general 2022-06-29 06:03:07 ÷ 3
general 2022-06-29 06:03:19 U get 375
general 2022-06-29 06:03:34 Studs per sec
general 2022-06-29 06:04:06 I'm a milsimer
general 2022-06-29 06:04:09 I like it realistic

general 2022-06-29 06:05:58 Or is my calculator dumb
general 2022-06-29 06:06:00 Math sucks
general 2022-06-29 06:06:27 I searched the A10 speed
general 2022-06-29 06:06:30 It's 616 kmh
general 2022-06-29 06:06:38 Kmh to feet per sec
general 2022-06-29 06:06:51 Wait wrong
general 2022-06-29 06:07:11 676 kmh = 616 fps
general 2022-06-29 06:07:16 ÷ 3
general 2022-06-29 06:07:25 It's right
general 2022-06-29 06:07:26 205
general 2022-06-29 06:07:39 But that's slow as hell
general 2022-06-29 06:07:54 Divided by 3
general 2022-06-29 06:08:00 Gun is good tho
general 2022-06-29 06:08:04 But it sucks to die
general 2022-06-29 06:08:19 1 feet = 3 Roblox studs

general 2022-06-29 06:17:56 That they just want a break

general 2022-06-30 01:45:28 Man
general 2022-06-30 01:46:34 I'm gonna slow down my A10 warthog
general 2022-06-30 01:46:41 All the way to 205
general 2022-06-30 01:49:07 The A10's real speed is 676 mph
general 2022-06-30 01:49:14 I looked at the speed in fps
general 2022-06-30 01:49:18 (feet per sec)
general 2022-06-30 01:49:23 And ÷ 3
general 2022-06-30 01:49:30 Since 1 feet = 3 studs
general 2022-06-30 01:49:34 I get 205
general 2022-06-30 01:49:40 Really?
general 2022-06-30 01:50:06 Bruh
general 2022-06-30 01:50:19 I'll just make 205 the maximum speed
general 2022-06-30 01:50:35 Lemme search up
general 2022-06-30 01:50:40 Bruh
general 2022-06-30 01:51:07 Yeah
general 2022-06-30 01:51:19 What speed is used?
general 2022-06-30 01:52:02 Wait
general 2022-06-30 01:52:05 My calc is wrong
general 2022-06-30 01:52:11 3 studs = 1 meter
general 2022-06-30 01:52:22 Not 1 foot = 1 stud
general 2022-06-30 01:52:30 So I'll make it go 616 studs
general 2022-06-30 01:53:07 I look for the speed, convert it to foot, 1 foot = 1 stud, and that's the speed
general 2022-06-30 01:54:30 Forum said it
general 2022-06-30 03:28:13 An A10 can fly with a whole wing missing and 1 engine only
general 2022-06-30 03:28:17 Actually
general 2022-06-30 03:28:19 It ain't cap
general 2022-06-30 03:28:24 It did happen to my A10
general 2022-06-30 03:28:32 Long gone
general 2022-06-30 03:28:41 Imma look for someone to shoot my A10 down
general 2022-06-30 03:28:56 Btw
general 2022-06-30 03:29:10 It doesn't mean it's a gaurantee
general 2022-06-30 03:29:21 Yes
general 2022-06-30 03:29:40 It did actually happen
general 2022-06-30 03:29:46 My A10 was still flying
general 2022-06-30 03:29:49 One downside
general 2022-06-30 03:30:05 It looses is balance
general 2022-06-30 03:30:12 So flies over the right
general 2022-06-30 03:30:16 Unless I force it
general 2022-06-30 03:30:18 Oh

general 2022-07-20 14:48:06 Does someone here know how to make a cannon in plane crazy that can reload explosive balls
general 2022-07-20 14:48:40 I'm making a 105mm howitzer for a AC-130H
general 2022-07-20 14:53:08 I'm trying to see how I can make a  reloadable cannon
general 2022-07-20 14:56:01 1
general 2022-07-20 14:56:26 The one that has 2 barrels, I didn't say 2 barrels, it was 2 guns, was the 20mm equalizers
general 2022-07-20 14:56:46 1 block wide barrel
general 2022-07-20 14:56:56 Wait I think I found a concept
general 2022-07-20 14:57:04 Leme sketch it
general 2022-07-20 14:57:21 1 block long, the autocannons?
general 2022-07-20 14:59:55 I made the concept now
general 2022-07-20 14:59:59 <#495286269459300364>
general 2022-07-20 15:00:03 I'll send it in a bit
general 2022-07-20 15:00:06 And explain how it works
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:00:43 This looks weird, but once u start understanding how it works, u will see
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:00:50 The red balls are the explosive
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:01:07 The green is the magnet
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:01:27 Blue is to block the barrel, so the explosive ball doesn't fall off
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:01:38 How this works is with the help of gravity, the red balls fall
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:01:59 The green box was supposed to be at the back
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:02:12 Accidentally put it under the explosive balls
general 2022-07-20 15:02:17 ?
general 2022-07-20 15:02:43 Oh
general 2022-07-20 15:02:45 Thanks
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:03:25 Once an explosive is Infront of the magnet, it will start pushing, then once I wanna shoot, a piston should put the blue box down
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:03:30 Forcing the ball to exit
general 2022-07-20 15:03:40 Okay
general 2022-07-20 15:04:01 Damn nice engineering
general 2022-07-20 15:04:37 Is it just a mock-up of how a tank autoloader works?
general 2022-07-20 15:05:58 I'll look a bit in yt
general 2022-07-20 15:06:10 If there's a reloadable cannon
general 2022-07-20 15:06:17 I am not gonna copy a tutorial
general 2022-07-20 15:06:34 ?
general 2022-07-20 15:07:30 Nvm, imma stick with the concept I made, it's good
general 2022-07-20 15:07:43 Not realistic, but it will work
general 2022-07-20 15:07:50 It's like the railguns
general 2022-07-20 15:07:54 But it loads
general 2022-07-20 15:08:36 I'll then see how to motorlock multiple guns in a 1x1 cube
general 2022-07-20 15:09:01 So barrel doesn't look ugly
general 2022-07-20 15:12:23 How many RPM is the gun in plane crazy?
general 2022-07-20 15:12:26 Rounds per minuite
general 2022-07-20 15:12:29 Or second
general 2022-07-20 15:12:55 Nvm, it said 5 rounds per second
general 2022-07-20 15:13:03 60x5=300
general 2022-07-20 15:19:30 It's balls
general 2022-07-20 15:19:32 Literally
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:19:52 Nvm no one's gonna understand the concept, I'll just make it tommorow
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:21:41 Where else can I send images
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:21:45 I got no perms 💀
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:22:00 I forgor I have image perms in <#384021699466756107>
the-dump 2022-07-20 15:32:52 PTSD
general 2022-07-20 15:48:38 I found an idea
general 2022-07-20 15:48:45 On how to make a 40mm Bofor
general 2022-07-20 15:48:54 Adjustable firerate
general 2022-07-20 15:49:12 But keeping it at 2 rounds per second,1 140 rounds per minuite
general 2022-07-20 16:03:41 Stereotype moment

general 2022-07-20 17:08:56 VTOL warship from cod wouldn't leave my mind, I just wanna make AC-130
general 2022-07-20 17:10:24 I am thinking for the VTOL warship
general 2022-07-20 17:10:32 Not like V-22 osprey
general 2022-07-20 17:10:36 Or F-35
general 2022-07-20 17:11:13 I remember using ballast blocks
general 2022-07-20 17:11:23 And setting it up to the max bouyancy
general 2022-07-20 17:11:31 It made me keep flying
general 2022-07-20 17:11:35 I tought someone was trolling me

general 2022-07-21 14:59:35 Why are there alot of downvotes in creations
general 2022-07-25 12:21:58 Motorlocking removed?
general 2022-07-25 12:22:02 Or is it back now
general 2022-07-25 12:22:16 Nvm
general 2022-07-25 12:22:28 I realized that
general 2022-07-25 12:22:35 I just noticed exactly right now
general 2022-07-25 12:57:15 How do I motorlock
general 2022-07-25 12:58:27 My brain is a size of a bullet that hit the man in the car without roof
general 2022-07-25 13:03:43 How am I gonna put 20 huge rockets in my SR-72
general 2022-07-25 13:07:28 I need a brain surgery
general 2022-07-25 13:09:26 I forgor that TF2 exists
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 11:51:32 My Goofy ass brain just discovered how to motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:07:02 💀 💀 💀 💀
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:07:24 U gave me idea to stop nukes
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:07:32 Just use railguns
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:07:39 It's gonna detonate it midair
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:09:46 Im soon gonna make an island
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:09:56 But it's a nuclear silo in disguise
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:10:35 Same
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:10:48 My ass wasted 4 hours finding out how motorlocking works
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:11:36 Has someone made a VR mech before?
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:12:14 Like code Ur VR a little to do keybinds by moving
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:12:31 And set those keybinds to do stuff like move fingers
plane-crazy 2022-07-26 12:12:36 Bruh
