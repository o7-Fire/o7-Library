plane-crazy 2022-12-06 05:34:09 this is not how you make your plane fast
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 05:34:41 and also just using as little drag reducing elements as possible
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 05:35:03 the person who made it said it ate his fps
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 05:35:46 and also motorlocks are like a no-no when trying to go fast
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 05:35:56 motors are **dense**
