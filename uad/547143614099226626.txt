help 2021-02-25 05:46:35 I have a problem with my space shuttle build, the wing control surfaces just don't move with automatic controls they also don't move with set controls I think it is to do with the fact that they are vertical rather then horizontal but that doesn't explain why the control surfaces still don't move when I set the controls myself.
