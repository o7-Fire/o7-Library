plane-crazy 2020-12-28 23:33:55 Decided to go searching for solar systems in the Robloxian galaxy using my probe. This image has been scaled up.
Galylight is the same as the Sun.
Donus, is way too hot. Having magma and lava on it's surface.
Galywayian Moon, thought to be a rocky baron planet. BUT, this Moon is in the habitable zone meaning it can support life. This solar system is 480 light years away from Robloxia.

plane-crazy 2021-01-18 00:53:09 not even the flag is right
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 00:53:44 and then there is a bunch of wing panels on the craft to the left and it makes it look really bad, and the wing panels dont even make it stable
plane-crazy 2021-01-18 00:54:14 and every time i tried to make the whole rocket it literally just looks like a cylinder with a pointy top and a paint scheme

creations-chat 2021-01-18 03:53:55 Changed the color to a more "60's" yellow. Also, yes, I will change the engines, I also thought they were rather small.
creations-chat 2021-01-18 03:55:55 Like, just make them bigger, or like change the shape and make them bigger?
creations-chat 2021-01-18 04:01:41 Alright, fixed the wings, I can still adjust them if needed. Now I need to work on the engines.
creations-chat 2021-01-18 04:03:42 Like, keep them the same size but change it up, or make it bigger? I need more context, sorry.
creations-chat 2021-01-18 04:09:37 What about the part in the middle?
creations-chat 2021-01-18 04:13:20 I tried to use half blocks but it looked way too blocky. Why do I see a motor lock running towards me-
creations-chat 2021-01-18 04:15:22 Alright lol, cya, and thank you.
creations-chat 2021-01-18 04:19:54 Alright, motor lock F1 engine. By the way, the lower wedges are 1x2 half wedges.

creations-chat 2021-01-18 15:51:28 Well, I mean, I don't know what to do because my friend here said they look better like that but I don't know. I can just put panels inside the rocket so it doesn't flip over.
creations-chat 2021-01-18 16:10:46 Any opinions before I start building the 2nd stage? And no, I haven't added the little decoupler ring between the 1st and 2nd stage.
creations-chat 2021-01-18 16:13:42 How could I change them?

Makes we wonder HOW MANY OTHER THINGS I BUILT THAT AREN'T TO SCALE. also: this model is not detailed because i just wanted to see if i could actually get the scale right..
creations-chat 2021-01-26 10:03:42 The head height to the lander is very similar I must say. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/483990499972087839/803565719555276811/5931.png

creations-chat 2021-02-01 12:16:51 omg i just spent all night building a rocket, only for it to not dock to the lander thus defeating the purpose of the rocket and i think i just had a stroke a few minutes ago im literally sweating jesus
creations-chat 2021-02-01 12:18:53 thanks to the devs of this game only like blocking your view with only fog, theres a glitch where motor locking kills magnets, im literally going to bash my head into a wall
creations-chat 2021-02-01 12:20:58 go cover yourself in oil, and im a decent builder (nah im pretty terrible g), hey, at least i aint the one building off of tutorials lol <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-02-01 12:22:58 no, i didnt say you were, i was talking about the public servers, those tutorials, they scare me, those children who say no and yes to anything, the shredders.. my god..
creations-chat 2021-02-01 12:25:00 it doesnt move and glitch out, it appears normal, but they just dont connect once i press the button
bug-reports 2021-02-01 12:26:14 Hello, I want to make a report of magnets being corrupted by motor locking / folding.

My Saturn V, which is a rocket, has a docking method to dock to the Moon lander, well, when I detach the covering, the magnets won't react when I press the buttons.
bug-reports 2021-02-01 12:30:15 In the first image, you can see this docks, I tested this on both space crafts, they worked.
bug-reports 2021-02-01 12:31:21 However, when I try to dock to the lander, it completely just decides to not dock, and YES it's in a 20 block radius of the magnets. Also, the magnets are hidden, maybe that could be why? But on my old Saturn V, they were not hidden and still didn't dock.
bug-reports 2021-02-01 12:32:50 Just because of this one glitch, it has wasted hours of building this, I have took all night and half a day to build this, but god forbid the magnets work.
bug-reports 2021-02-01 15:39:15 bruh, that is what its on
bug-reports 2021-02-01 16:00:33 i have weld and toggle on

general 2021-03-15 07:00:20 I have a friend, he's a furry, but he isn't those cringe ones, it's the really cringe ones in public that make the community look REALLY awful.
general 2021-03-15 07:00:51 In fact, he never even talks to me about it, it's just the weird cringe ones in public acting like human dogs that make it look bad.

general 2021-03-15 07:03:49 It's just the really cringe ones in public barking at dogs like they're dogs that make it look pretty bad. Other than that, the people who are furries are pretty nice, they never mention about being a furry at all, unlike the ones that think they're literal dogs at the park.
general 2021-03-15 07:04:11 Oh god..
general 2021-03-15 07:05:15 I just don't see why people freak out over normal furries, just blame the really bad ones that think they're dogs.

creations-chat 2021-03-30 17:14:45 actually, i just built a base before this one and it worked fine, i even tested it again so it's not roblox's 'fixed' physics. well i mean it doesnt work fine like something you'd see made by some god at the game.

plane-crazy 2021-04-01 21:34:58 Who else finds it annoying when someone comes up to you and asks you how you built your build?
plane-crazy 2021-04-01 21:35:21 I saw someone walk up to Reniscool and asked him how to motor lock, it's like BRUH he already did a tutorial on that.

bug-reports 2021-04-01 23:31:09 I've noticed with my Saturn V rockets, when I dock with the LM the magnets never work, they use the SAME KEYBINDS don't even ask that again please, they have weld on and they are on max strength. It never welds / works. Yet when I put on a motor 2 which sorta destroys the rocket, docking with magnets work.
bug-reports 2021-04-01 23:32:34 <:trollface:775024642104229898>

bug-reports 2021-04-01 23:54:56 interesting..
bug-reports 2021-04-01 23:55:48 no wait i mean i found that "magnets only" breaks it
bug-reports 2021-04-02 00:24:42 But then when I put an unlocked motor to replace the Motor 2 which breaks it, it doesn't break the rocket too much and I'm able to use magnets... very interesting.

plane-crazy 2021-06-26 01:55:19 Why do hover thrusters lag so much?
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 01:56:11 Like I'm afraid I just created a lag machine trying to get into a 'orbit'.
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 01:56:25 A lag machine on accident.
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 01:56:37 Most likely.
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 02:08:39 I just created an actual orbital vehicle.
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 02:09:03 By going 25813.333333 feet (studs) per second you can get into orbit at 180g.
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 02:09:13 And yes I did the math.
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 02:09:19 oh wait
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 02:09:26 hold on my calculations were wrong
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 02:09:41 I need to re test that with more engines.
plane-crazy 2021-06-26 02:09:55 So since roblox doesn't have drag, you can get into orbit.

creations-chat 2021-07-12 17:05:34 True.
bug-reports 2021-07-12 18:47:20 I've notice when splashing down in my capsules that sometimes parachutes decide to have an actual seizure.
bug-reports 2021-07-12 18:48:29 And basically your build decides to be like a gmod prop inside of another gmod prop. We all know what happens then.
bug-reports 2021-07-12 18:52:09 Must be due to the drag.
bug-reports 2021-07-12 18:52:38 Based on bugs I've seen, apparently fabric wing panels don't like existing either. So they both have drag and they're both fabric, could be the same.

plane-crazy 2021-08-04 09:56:57 the rope constraints are made by roblox

plane-crazy 2021-08-04 09:58:49 if you want rope collision just place a bunch of ropes everywhere but dont resize them, they'll have collision joints

creations-chat 2021-08-17 20:01:11 the rocket im currently building seems to be good for all requirements for the top rank of rocket scientist, though if there is one part im confused about is the 4th requirement. what i mean is, the launch pad separates from the rocket allowing it to take off but would this be a problem? not to mention the stages, fairings, and the two stage lander.
creations-chat 2021-08-17 20:03:19 that's the thing they separate when the times comes to do that, it pretty much just gets smaller until it's just one capsule that returns back

bug-reports 2021-08-23 00:53:21 I guess I can't really call this a bug, but when will parachutes be able to NOT go through blacklist walls? I can't even build without being trolled by some low life who has no hobby other than taking time out of their day to make me annoyed.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 01:14:41 progress
current block count at the moment im typing this: 8371

creations-chat 2021-08-23 02:07:26 hull looks pretty accurate in some areas besides it being too short or tall
creations-chat 2021-08-23 02:09:41 upper venting pipes on the third stages are done, oof i forgot to disconnect some disconnectors

creations-chat 2021-08-23 09:42:23 wow, the totally real beluga, not scamming or anything also they got banned instantly
then again beluga's content kinda trash from what ive watched, its all staged.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 09:46:21 yeah it doesnt even take much to find out, you just know it.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 10:30:49 both crafts docked, they both have interiors as well + a 1x3 docking hatch covered into a 1x2 docking hatch to allow horizontal docking as seen here.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 10:33:03 ikr, im pretty proud of it so far
creations-chat 2021-08-23 10:59:50 lol, looking good ngl, a lot of effort went into your rocket you built there
creations-chat 2021-08-23 11:09:38 also ive been checking the fairing / lem extraction jettisons, and they're very smooth, i legit said "this is the ultimate saturn v" and yes i know that's an exaggeration
im just really happy with this rocket
creations-chat 2021-08-23 11:11:53 lol, you just gotta take it smooth, dont rush.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 11:14:18 <:trollface:775024642104229898> haha goodluck

creations-chat 2021-08-23 11:43:26 never say something so cursed again
creations-chat 2021-08-23 11:50:09 working launch escape system
creations-chat 2021-08-23 11:55:44 now i can start attaching super rocket engines to this thing and hoping it flys at 180 g lol
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:00:12 well, this is my fourth one and ive spent three days on now, currently adding propulsion to it to make it fly.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:02:18 nah i wont, i've already added the propulsion for the two spacecrafts. just a matter of spamming super rocket engines and putting wing panels in the 1st and 2nd stage.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:04:40 you too.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:08:30 damn, 10,416 parts at the moment with propulsion in all the stages. i might not add the tower for lag purposes.
creations-chat 2021-08-23 12:38:38 skill solution
creations-chat 2021-08-23 14:49:39 i dont know why but after making my fourth saturn v i feel like i didnt even make it, its like it just appeared in my save files

creations-chat 2021-08-24 02:26:52 thanks to some c-130 and tall pencil like SLS rocket, this picture ended being really small
creations-chat 2021-08-24 02:29:34 no, thats one mistake i made on every creation ive posted in the pcc. the god like launch escape system as it sits in front of the sun.
creations-chat 2021-08-24 02:32:39 i mean for one i would probably have to do it in a streamable video, pictures dont do it well
creations-chat 2021-08-24 02:37:39 One giant sets, and another gets ready to rise.
creations-chat 2021-08-24 02:40:04 thanks
creations-chat 2021-08-24 02:42:09 it already meets the requirements, last thing i need to get is either a cinematic video of this or some screenshots. i'll go with cinematic, it's just cooler in my opinion instead of having 20 different pictures in <#384025409945337856> lol.
creations-chat 2021-08-24 02:44:21 lmfao, what if instead of putting "The Saturn V" on my saturn v post in creations i just say "The Shitfuck V"
creations-chat 2021-08-24 02:47:29 editing and getting actual good shots of the rocket is gonna be a pain
creations-chat 2021-08-24 02:50:10 i guess i should get to recording this, i dont know how im gonna get these shots besides pointing some cameras at one object and hoping they look good, thinking of synth music in the background with a nice beat
creations-chat 2021-08-24 11:56:57 what is with <#384025409945337856> and why wont it let me post two streamable vids

the-dump 2021-08-31 09:47:22 what i mean is, you shouldnt be speaking like a brain dead donkey when you're a fully grown adult
the-dump 2021-08-31 09:48:09 dont get me started on how much no no drawings they have

plane-crazy 2021-09-17 08:21:55 yeah, if someone discourages them they will leave.

plane-crazy 2021-09-20 20:15:08 that's as round as they'll get realistically
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 20:15:17 mainly the upper vertical fin
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 20:16:07 depending on the specific shark, it's vertical fin could either be curved or very straight forward
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 20:20:55 fixed the back fin, but i might make the upper part of it more round, just a row of 1x4s at the moment bru
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 20:23:41 you're not wrong
plane-crazy 2021-09-20 20:30:50 shhhhhh

the-dump 2021-09-30 06:53:09 she had responsibility
the-dump 2021-09-30 06:53:32 and went ahead and got with a new one
the-dump 2021-09-30 06:53:48 my question is, how far is she going to go before she is arrested?
the-dump 2021-09-30 06:54:06 yes
the-dump 2021-09-30 06:54:19 i also have reason to believe, well me and wyatt have reason to believe she might also be 31
the-dump 2021-09-30 06:54:32 oh really? someone who is over 18, that's new.
the-dump 2021-09-30 06:54:53 14

the-dump 2021-09-30 06:55:25 yeah no kidding
the-dump 2021-09-30 06:55:39 i really wish she would change, its sucks because she taught me how to build

the-dump 2021-09-30 06:56:36 she's also done way more than date people under the age of 18
the-dump 2021-09-30 06:56:57 oh, it's very suggestive stuff, illegal

plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:00:32 i didnt realize how small it would look this far away
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:02:56 
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:03:29 thanks
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:05:18 some people think this is to scale, but its actually 10 feet wider than the real saturn v, i dont know about the height and quite frankly i dont want to count it.
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:06:41 however the spacecrafts are quite close to being to scale
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:07:03 the reason the rest of the rocket isnt is due to the third stage being about 2.5 feet out from what it should be
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:07:37 and then the last two stages are just kinda their own scale and dimensions
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:08:32 might make a saturn v that's to scale, it wouldnt be functional because the 1:1 scale is simply too small to do anything
plane-crazy 2021-09-30 10:12:07 and, actually, the reason people think it's to scale is the fact that roblox avatars are just way too blocky and it makes things look small.

plane-crazy 2021-10-11 03:39:42 <@!690727914521493504>, it's impossible, due to roblox being the lazist company there is most of the time, they're ones who control the terrain. The terrain really just a building tool than it is a whole build it's self.
plane-crazy 2021-10-11 03:41:53 I mean it depends if Roblox wants to take the long and more work route, that is making water fall off the map. If they did add water physics it probably wouldn't fall off the map.

creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:30:51 wow bro nice feedback
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:32:58 im all for criticism and stuff but this is what i mean with the pcc, you come in expecting a nice community that will welcome your builds, but instead you're greeted with "delete" 100 times over until you finally give up and actually leave.
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:35:54 fr, like bro, the amount of people who have left this community could've became well known builders but instead they leave because more than half of this community doesnt know how to give actual constructive criticism. hell, i dont even know how to criticize constructively
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:39:14 its not even about if your overly sensitive or not, most people dont want to be in a community with a bunch of douchebags
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:41:18 there is a reason we celebrate the ban of skilletrocks2016 lmao, and if you know, you know.
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:44:07 that's kinda just apart of every community really, cant really change that. also, what i meant by skillet is how she was such a bitch when it came to criticizing a build. she once called someone a minor for building poorly, you could check the message logs though it would be quite hard to do so with her being banned and no longer having an @ in this server.
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:46:10 idk, but she would bitch about someone's build when her builds were worse and then she would copy the builds she just talked shit about.
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:48:27 i do miss building for fun
creations-chat 2021-12-14 06:50:31 thats when i joined the pcc, then it became more of a dread than it did an actual hobby, nowadays i find myself playing pc for 10 minutes with half of that time just being me browsing discord before finally leaving
