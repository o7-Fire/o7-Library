plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:26:00 <@!295568493166985218> oh it becomes easier when i have 3 propellers near the front (with less rockets in the bck as well)
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:27:10 oh ur right, longer wings help
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:27:22 😮
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:27:27 oh ok
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:29:43 whats a disconnector btw
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:30:15 o lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:33:56 idk why this batmobile dude is so bent on spawncamping me lol
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:34:19 his car is neat tho
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:42:41 jameson, i found out that it's easier to turn by tilting the plane to the side, but it flies up a bit too
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:43:18 ooh
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:45:54 whats the diff between delta wings and regular wings?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:46:25 oh
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:55:09 my box plane : D
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:56:28 jesus
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:57:56 destruction: just got revenge on the batmobile that was trying to shoot me down on takeoff
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:59:19 the batmobile can even fly too
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 02:59:26 his car's honestly pretty cool

plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:59:07 what's a good speed for a fighter jet? 600?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:59:25 sometimes, i find that the guns shoot my self at high speeds
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:59:29 how do  i prevent dat
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 21:59:38 oh ok
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:00:02 my thing goes about 400 rn, only managed to fit 4 guns onto it :c
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:00:45 whats a battlebus
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:02:06 guys whats a battlebus
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:07:44 conveyor belts?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:09:36 is it possible to make turrets on aircraft
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:53:48 how do i make a turret?
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:53:53 what special block do i need to use
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:53:55 to make the swivel
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:54:00 o
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:54:08 oh i thought a motor was an engine of some sort
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 22:54:35 😮
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 23:10:59 i have an isssue with my turret: both motors move when i press either f or r and so i cant swing the 2 sections individually--> then i cant aim properly
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 23:11:05 how do i find a way around this
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 23:11:51 ooh
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 23:11:55 thanks bruh <@456226577798135808>
plane-crazy 2018-11-25 23:47:27 ya
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 02:33:58 why do i keep randomly dying when i fire my guns
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 02:34:35 nu they're in front of me
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 02:35:14 see, this is how it looks
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 02:35:19 no
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 02:35:22 they're all on the front
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 02:35:32 ya, u can see in the picture
plane-crazy 2018-11-26 02:35:57 ok
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:47:35 wait whys there an announcement about copying from pictures?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:47:40 what's happening
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:49:05 brick?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:51:03 oh LOL but isnt that a big part of pretty much any design process (taking what's good from other designs and furthur improving em with a few touches of my own)
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:52:15 I once had to fight this 6-winged fighter jet and boi it was hard to gun down with my current place back then

so then i made a similar version except I added a bunch of serious upgrades from stuff i read from this channel > : D
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:52:39 oh ok lemme log on
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:52:59 it looks like a mess tho xd but it works pretty well
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:55:42 the original plane had a huge cluster of engines in the back while this one has 5  forward super rockets and 2 jet engines way in the back 

small fighters like this one cant fit many guns tho
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:56:13 oh lol and the rockets in the middle are for turning
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:56:20 :C
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:56:22 ya
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:56:32 but it's fast tho (like 600-700)
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:57:12 it's rlly maneuverable so that kinda makes up for small size : D
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 03:57:42 i mean, it's so hard to hit anything in this game :c

everything's flying and wobbling around
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:00:11 oi james wuts ur best combat plane?
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:00:12 o
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:00:21 ya
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:00:53 woa that's one huge plan
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:01:02 how fast is it 😄
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:01:18 !!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:02:23 woa that's pretty quick
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:02:59 my plane goes 660 usually but it wobbles when it's diving (then id have to wait a bit for it to stabilize again xddddd)
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:03:08 : O
plane-crazy 2019-01-01 04:03:29 damn
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:34:08 now how... do i properly set up helicopter blades?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:34:38 oof, the actual helicopter body spins as well
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:35:15 oh is that the only working arrangment?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:38:45 nu idea :c wdym fold
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:39:05 btw how do i set up the coaxial rotors? are the blades going to the angled the opposite way?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:41:59 oi what motor settings and configuration should i use to make a working heli?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:42:14 ive made coaxial rotors but the flying still hasnt improved :c
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:45:34 here's what it looks like
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:45:46 ive got a tail rotor in the back : D
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:47:02 <@458451488335986688> are my propeller blades set up in the wrong way?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:50:07 LOL yea
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:57:11 <@205404956759556096> oh thx, what about the motors? is the coaxial thing made up of two motors separated by a block and also facing each other?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:58:18 here's my coaxial set up so far
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:59:15 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:59:28 oh crap now it spins faster than ever LOL
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 01:59:36 strange... i tested it on a flat platform and it worked perfectly
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:01:20 i used this video for help https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubmiikrhri0

and even gave it a try ingame... but hte rotors failed to work for the actual heli i made
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:01:24 :c very strange
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:07:41 this is weird, the same setup didnt work when i used my real heli save
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:07:53 maybe there's some problem with the save im using
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:13:23 no one really actively pvps tho
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:15:49 btw i need help, why does this setup work in his game but not mine?! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubmiikrhri0

ive copied the exact same thing but in my game, the platform rotates as well argh **RAAGE**
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:16:26 cuz im absolutely clueless lmao :c
help 2019-01-02 02:16:51 okay yea im having trouble with my helicopter engine :c (from general)
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:16:57 ok
help 2019-01-02 02:17:18 oi guys, do you have any answers to that? (how the results from video and ingame are diff)
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:21:34 ugh there's no one available now :c
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:23:53 does anyone have a working helicopter I can see?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:26:14 :c same
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:30:16 OI timmiez technician, do you know how to make helicopters?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:30:39 :c oof me
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:30:52 been trying to figure out how to make them for the past hour
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:30:58 the body keeps spinning :c
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:31:09 no matter what configuration i use from those working examples
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:31:22 you mean on the back?
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:32:00 hmmm ill try that
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:34:14 oh shit using engines instead of loose motors really do work
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:35:02 omg i finally figured it out... just set the bottom motor loose and keep the top one powered -_- epic fail
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:35:06 oof me
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:36:22 woa
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:36:22 <@278351709607165953> this is what happens when i  play after 6 hours of sleep
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:36:24 now that;s
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:36:28 a powerplay
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 02:36:32 good idea
plane-crazy 2019-01-02 03:14:16 is there a way to remote detonate my explosive blocks?

I attachted a cluster of them to a disconnector on the bottom of the helicopter but i cant detonate the payload :c
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 05:35:14 my first big plane > : D
plane-crazy 2019-01-03 05:37:24 i planning for it to be a massive bomber, idk what should be its payload: explosive blocks, rockets, or smthing else
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:57:09 how do ppl "fuse" other vehicles into each other?
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 00:57:25 do they use magnets?
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 01:04:58 ay how do people "fuse" different builds together? hax?
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 01:05:31 oi does anyone know anything about this "fusing" ingame? I saw it a buunch of times :c
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 01:05:35 got fused myself too
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 01:06:33 <@!194241218811658240> oh thats the term he used, what he basically did was pretty much suck my build into his somehow
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 01:06:44 sucked it into the same position
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 01:35:32 <@!435946988559925248> can i come too
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 01:35:44 i have a propeller bomber
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 01:40:36 :c
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 01:44:00 david v goliath (it soon toppled afterwards) but LOL

plane-crazy 2019-01-04 07:17:26 final KO
plane-crazy 2019-01-04 07:17:53 this bomber rlly works on those slow planes xdddd
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:25:19 lolol missiles are bad weapons for fighters, they'r etoo slow
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:25:36 actually idk, u could slow down and fire a volley
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:25:48 😮
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:25:55 can i see? 😮
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:26:07 do u have an example of a custo missile?
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:26:34 damn that looks cool, i guess it released by a disconnector
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:27:29 o damn
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:27:40 i should try to fit one into my bomber
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:27:54 have u downed anything using that missile?
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:28:01 (how good is it in pvp?)
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:28:04 o
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:28:47 o shit there's iimpact mode coming? : D
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:29:00 would it be a default setting?
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:29:16 i just wonder, how would  i quickly set all my expllosive blocks to impact mode after it comes out
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:29:28 cuz my bomber carries ~100 of em
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:29:35 o impact mode i think would be
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:29:46 explosive blocks exploding on contact with anything else
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:30:32 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:31:11 oh thx
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:31:18 ya
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:32:12 oh ye, ill have to see thru trials xd
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:32:35 ill try making a giant one with a long 3x3 column of bombs
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:32:54 or a 3x3 cross instead of a rectangle prism if it turns out to be too heavy
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:33:32 rn i use cluster bombs xd but since my bomber goes about 300-400, id have to drop the bombs sooo much earlier since they fly fast too :c
plane-crazy 2019-01-06 22:35:06 wut if u mount a camera in the front?
plane-crazy 2019-01-07 06:19:02 o
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 05:58:08 time to make rope storm
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 05:58:13 that video
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 05:58:15 was
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 05:58:17 inspiring
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:02:53 how tf do u get the ropes to stretch like that
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:06:39 :c
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:12:45 <@458451488335986688> thank allah for ur insightful comment


(btw by launch it do you mean using engines and flying it in a direction? or have the engines facing random directions just to throw it somehwere
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:13:45 oh so do the rope physics just go commit oof and a hurricane forms just like that?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:14:46 oh
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:15:40 :c
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:16:56 LOL
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:20:10 <@458451488335986688> is this what it's supposed to be?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:21:07 o shit :C
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:22:25 do the ropes nee dspecial settings?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:23:02 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:23:08 thx!
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:23:13 helium is op asf tbh
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:26:00 😂 omg
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:27:38 should i use propellers like in the pic or something like superrockets to expand the cube?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:32:39 fuq this engines dont seem to work
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:32:52 time to try magnets
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:36:09 omg nvm this storm is fucking up some serious shit rn
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:39:45 actually my storm isnt working too well
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:39:48 more like rope salad
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:41:00 LOL one them? ok
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:41:02 *on
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:46:35 i just cant get my ropes off the ground like the gif :c
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:46:38 more engines!
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:49:10 it just gets into a giant knot in the middle
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:53:47 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:53:50 have u made one before?
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:55:17 rn im testing out a storm with less blocks
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:55:21 and longer ropes
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 06:55:31 (multiple ropes blocked together)
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 07:08:19 gosh making ropestorm is tirinf as fffffffffffffff
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 07:08:34 !!!!!!!?!!
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 08:10:23 finally
plane-crazy 2019-01-08 08:21:31 just fond out that ppl were able to spam-blacklist me to quickly eject me from muh seat :C karma
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 06:21:29 spaghetti
plane-crazy 2019-01-09 06:22:37 i think i perfected this

plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:52:04 how do i make an elevator? ive tried making a magnet one but the platform wont lift :C
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:57:25 has anyone made an elevator for this game?
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:57:32 im trying to create one using magnets
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:57:33 o
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:57:40 o wat?!
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:57:49 wheels and engines?
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:58:13 oh i thought if i had some on the platform then and others on the building then i could attract the two together
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:58:14 oh
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:58:15 woops
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:58:27 crap, back to square one then
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:58:29 ya
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:58:48 oi vip, what do u use to power the elevator?
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:59:12 oh ropes, oh ok, i just afriad that they might be unreliable
plane-crazy 2019-01-15 23:59:45 https://gyazo.com/249ead3f7dc14aa70f1aa04367c4848a i was trying to recreate something like dis
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:00:03 the things on the outer edges seem to be... motors?!
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:00:52 oh cylinders.... right right
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:00:58 but what do the motors do?
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:01:02 😮
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:02:14 i only know to use motors to spin things llol
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:02:20 : O
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:02:46 ya
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:04:47 wait wat over the top suspension? what is that? springs and wheells or smthing above the elevator?
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:10:15 btw what is that elevator person excatly using the motors for? <@163143541160148992> 


you said something about  "pistons pushing them for the cylinders to make contact with the edges" but i dont understand why the motors need to be pushed by the pistons nor what exactly is caused by that pushing (like how does that help lift the elevator)

are u saying that he's attached cylinders to the front of the motors, and pistons behind the motors so the pistons would push the motors all the way until their cylinders could touch the edges? then when the motors spin they also spin the cylinders like wheels to move the elevator?
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:10:35 oh woa ok ill try that
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:10:59 that sounds even more unreliable than ropes lol, ill see
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:11:21 o crap
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:12:05 btw im fitting the elevator onto my balloon to connect floor 1 and 2 xddd, so i afraid that the motion of the balloon would glitch out my elevator
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:12:17 dat thing in the middle
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:12:25 oh ok lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:12:53 😮
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:13:06 are u using ropes or his cylinder wheel?
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:13:31 😮
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:50:08 wat that
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:50:53 o btw hwat is the "tnt net" which a lot of ppl have talked about earlier? is it like a rope storm but instead the blocks are all explosive?
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:51:35 oh lol, do they attach it to planes or smthing?
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:51:51 o lol
plane-crazy 2019-01-16 00:58:01 ikr it doesnt rlly matter lololol, they're trying to find out who's being evil ingame

plane-crazy 2019-01-22 21:09:00 even tho there's a changelog that says there are 1x3 twedge blocks
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 21:09:20 WHARE
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 21:09:23 😮

plane-crazy 2019-01-22 23:45:08 wugh i think my balloon is a failure it keeps floating in one direction even tho the weight is evenly distributed according to the yellow thing :C
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 23:46:02 i only used blocks, helium, and engines
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 23:46:24 hmm i go check
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 23:54:11 aughhhhhh screw my giant balloon, imma make a war zepplin instead, the balloon base must be unbalanced since i used ropes to link it to the actual balloon section
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 23:54:21 xd
plane-crazy 2019-01-22 23:55:23 LOL
plane-crazy 2019-01-23 00:14:36 make a zepplin
general 2019-01-23 05:12:07 > : D i got them nao!!!!
general 2019-01-23 05:12:23 o nu
the-dump 2019-01-23 06:39:39 <@352928457358835715> LOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLL omg where do u find these crazy picters
the-dump 2019-01-23 18:29:01 
plane-crazy 2019-01-30 00:44:12 has anyone made  a war zepplin here b4
the-dump 2019-01-30 01:31:01 *rraa**AAGHHh**hh*
the-dump 2019-01-30 01:57:32 i shake at the thought of a **paper cut** on his **head**
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 06:58:17 been trying to build a zepplin but i absolutely **HATE** it when parts snap like this
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 06:59:39 o i build these scrap parts so i can adjust where that wedge connects with the actual airframe?
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 07:00:39 o rip
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 07:00:46 o righto
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 07:02:00 this is my ultimate goal XDDDD (absolutely clueless on how to attach those side propellers like that.... maybe i need to split the zepplin in many diff segments on diff heights so the propellers can extend outwards like dat
plane-crazy 2019-01-31 07:03:14 ya i need to fix up the frame first
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:20:41 damn shit my magnet plane fucked up so hard that the server had to kick me :C
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:21:04 !!!
 damn
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:21:26 : O
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:37:31 my magnet plane has a severe shaking problem going on in the back (i improved it a bit by adding a ton of wings there but it still persists) :C
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:38:13 aw crap
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:38:32 yea
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:39:04 <@!530774331081621504> oooo can i  see ur magnet drive? how fast can u go using it?
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:39:08 does it shake?
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:39:17 oh
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:39:21 :C
 oof
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:40:14 my laptop can handle full blown ropestorm but not 10 magnets?! :C
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:40:15 yea
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:40:22 yes **pls** : D
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:41:02 LOL
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:58:55 best way to make a ropse storm is just to make a cube of regular blocks that are attacthed to each other by ropes

then have some blocks on the edges/corners as anchor blocks so after you extend the cube of doom, you anchor the corners to start the **storm**
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:59:12 (oh btw u need propellers facing outwards too to help stretch the thing)
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:59:14 o
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:59:18 ya
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 21:59:27 i made a 7x7
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 22:01:24 footage of what
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 22:02:00 <@!216371990959882241> wait wat footage
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 22:03:44 i wish there was a war game-mode where two teams spawn their creations and destroy the each other for points and giggles xd

creations-chat 2019-02-02 22:05:44 damn but that looks great tbh, you've made the curves etc using the poopy wedges and beams : O
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 22:09:56 ooof
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 22:10:02 LOL
plane-crazy 2019-02-02 23:20:19 jajajaja
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:36:04 i finally have a working magnet plane : D
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:36:53 am trying to turn it into a box without changing up its lift etc :C
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:37:16 ive built half a ring around it and it suddenly now flies at 2k?!
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:37:26 yea
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:37:36 normal speed is 1k
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:37:53 : O
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:45:14 strange how my magnet plane used to shake at speeds around 600 before i changed up the magnet placement an settings, now it shakes at speeds around 2k.... weird

maybe the problem is the amount of wings? idk
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:45:18 o
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:45:23 damn airlock
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:51:08 damn
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:52:15 most i have is w for main engine, e/q for elevation, a/d for turning
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:53:33 ^ yee
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:57:15 xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:57:36 nice!
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:57:55 i usually find it hard to control more than one turret per plane cuz keybinds
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:59:25 damn! mouse controlled motors!
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 05:59:27 ikr
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 06:10:37 😮
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 06:10:44 damn are u ingame rn?
plane-crazy 2019-02-03 06:11:13 wait can i see ur ac130 plzzz

plane-crazy 2019-02-11 00:29:08 yea no kidding... dude went full "booga" that his brain went complete "ooga" and started creating square wheels 😂
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 00:35:09 LOL
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 00:38:13 woa cool submarine
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 00:38:47 wats a wunderwaffe u boat/ac
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 00:42:29 i usually go full-out and drop a tnt net over my targets xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 00:42:55 rn im trying to create an effective SAM
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 00:43:19 so far it flies extremely fast but my control surfaces arent working well enough to control it : C
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 00:45:05 the explosives are also attached to dis connectors so i can fling them around to cover a large area  > : D
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 00:46:28 woa interesting planes xd! looks great
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 00:55:31 LOL tradelands

my fav ship is the steam goose, it just looks awesome
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 00:55:53 but the way nahr made those ships is ridiculous xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 00:56:38 😂
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 00:56:57 it's absolutely stunning!
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 00:57:08 :C
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 00:57:13 :C
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 00:58:06 i prefer this tho, i sailed it alot
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 00:59:06 yeh i remember working with this other dude to cheat people on trades LOL, hauled in 500k more than we usually did
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 00:59:07 : O
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 00:59:33 ur planes about to become a rope storm
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 01:00:25 i use imgur xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 01:00:28 : O
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 01:00:53 tbh id rather just build it in blender xd and import it to studio
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 01:01:29 yeh ur guna need motors for really curved areas
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 01:03:04 o shit right
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 01:03:27 **inventor right there for that snow chimney**
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 01:03:28 woa
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 01:03:32 wat is dat?!
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 01:03:57 LOL WHAT
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 01:04:08 i need to be there
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 01:05:57 goddamn...
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 01:06:16 😂 those balls coming from the ceiling
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 01:07:26 damn maybe i should create a flying wagon thing with four helicopter turbines on the 4 corners so i could fit a minature rave dj area in the middle
plane-crazy 2019-02-11 05:09:53 fack my motors are a bit oof-ed today
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 23:03:58 *plane crazy*
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 23:05:56 i wonder how this would look ingame LOL
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 23:06:31 just straight up eat someone and their creation whole
plane-crazy 2019-02-16 23:19:38 LOL
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 21:34:29 im trying to install a nightclub on my flying machine but how do i get the spotlights to project different colored lights?!
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 21:37:33 ay how do i change the color of the light?
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 21:37:47 trying to build a flying rave club xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-19 21:38:49 oh wow it worked thx

i was using spotlights before xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 02:11:44 wat?
Flies?!
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 02:23:04 i made a nightclub inside my flying noob worm
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 02:28:48 wowee
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 02:28:50 damn
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 02:28:53 that looks great
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 02:34:22 LOL
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:03:13 how do i make the motor propeller turn very fast? The fastest motor setup ive got so far is just
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:04:50 i just rode on someone's jap betty bomber, took a peek at the engine, and saw at least 4 motors in there powering each other so the propeller blades would spin very very fast (visibly faster than my setup)
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:05:18 : O
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:05:47 ?!?!?!
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:06:55 my flying nightclub wont take off :C

but how would i use ropes? would i stick them onto the end of a motor in some way?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:07:38 OH
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:07:42 LOL!
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:11:52 <@!224513422161739776> have u gotten ur motors to spin even faster (than rope speed coaxial motors) by stacking em?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:12:25 im experimenting with 3+ motors to seee if i can reach some crazy sped
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:38:29 why does the propeller not spin? it only spins if i have another set underneath it
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:39:00 lmao
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:39:30 but damn, do u , henkkku, know why im having that issue with my propellers :C
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:39:48 ive been trying to stack em to no success
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:40:03 (they're all rotating in the same way)
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:40:04 nu
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:41:14 frick, still no difference, very very weird
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:41:41 have u created a succesful motor stack of 4+ motors? 

😮 interesting!
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:41:51 !!!!!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:42:13 argh!

does it onl have one set of proeller blades?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:42:18 : D
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:43:17 ive been trying to lift this monstrosity to no avail
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:44:05 i just need propellers that can spin very fast (an i might helium+magnet drive the rest)
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:45:04 woa
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:45:34 how fast can ur heli go?

seems like i might need four stacks of em
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:46:43 ooh yea
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:54:02 ya it looks like a real one tbh
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:54:17 💯 master indeed!
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 05:54:56 ive only built wacky things that fail half the time :C


the biggest thing ive ever built is prolly that flying nightclub oof worm
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 06:06:45 this is legit the only working plane in my accoutn rn
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 06:07:38 ?!
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 06:08:34 WAT
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 06:09:00 hey imperial, how does my magnet drive compare to urs?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 06:09:01 o wait
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 06:09:03 it same thing
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 06:09:04 nvm
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 06:09:05 xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 06:16:45 grrrrrrrrr howwwwwwwwww
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 06:39:13 :C now that's...
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:07:01 ugh i give up on my flying oof rave club, it's too much of a hassle to balance the entire thing out perfectly so it flies straight > : c


Imma change up some unsymmetric stuff up l8r
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:11:06 nice!
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:11:24 oof my nightclub has been pooped
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:25:51 idk, is it a bad thing that the blue shpere's position is so much higher than the peach colored  one?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:27:39 the problem with my flying rave club rn is that its tail always shifts to the right so the whole thing flies in circles  :C idk how to fix it cuz according to the peach sphere, its all balanced out (the wieght)
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:28:01 <@456226577798135808> dont think so, cant rlly change the friction unless u change the wheel material or smthing
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:28:30 yeh :C
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:29:20 ya tbh its prolyl time to use those rocket engines to help the steering xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:35:41 haaalp, how would i fix this issue of the tail moving towards the right :C

i balanced out the weight but i still dont have any clue of whats rlly causing this
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:37:12 the lift an weight is all centered... but thing is, the center of lift is a lot higher than the center of weight


(i used a lot of helium to help lift the heavy oof worm tho)
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:37:29 <@!322970944303923200> try stacking 1x1x7 beams
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:38:04 u can start using 1x1x1 blocks near the top to get a more precise measurement
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:38:08 but just know its that approx area
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:38:21 or ask rickje xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:40:31 but oi turbo, do u have any idea of what might be causing the tail movement for my oof worm?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:40:52 (it in above chat btw)
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:44:00 oof
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:44:01 my life
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:44:19 arghhhhhh


same, this was my first attempt
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:44:35 would be a shame to redo most of its internal structure again
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:44:40 maybe... it's the motors
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:44:52 specifically the ones which lower the propellers to flight mode
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:45:04 cuz sometimes it seems like they dont move in sync somehow
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:45:13 angles get messed up
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:45:16 BUT WOA
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:45:16 a master guy
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:45:22 DO. NOT. speak of such a name
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:46:07 FOR He is omniscient.. he willl kill us all with much impunity on sight of his own name being mentioned here
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:47:17 but damn... i have 0 idea how to fix my damn oof worm drone
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:57:42 <@!221496030355521536> i think i figured out the issue xd

it's how my rotor motors have 1000 units torque each :C
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:57:51 i have to convert them back to the helicopter coaxial ones
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:57:56 LOL
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 07:58:10 ill make the stack tmr
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:39:32 why isnt the motor which connects the propeller blades spinning at all?! ive only got it to spin if i have another set of blades below it, but i dont want a coaxial rotor
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:40:44 oh right, il do it rn
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:46:47 <@456226577798135808> a swashplate seems it would take up too much space on my drone

i was thinking of creating a stack of 3+ motors and only using a single set of rotors for each turbine : C

ive seen propeller planes (integex's fighter, someone's japanese betty bomber) that fly well without using coaxial rotors or swashplates, and their engines are mainly stacks of 4 motors powering this one set of blades
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:47:16 i just have no idea how to get a working stack :C 

this weird issue of the blades not spinning is stopping me
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:48:33 yeh that's what i did, the stack only works for coaxial somehow : C
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:49:28 see the motor spins but not the blades
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:49:55 oh  right, wanna try experimenting on a community vip server? maybe u can try following me to the game too
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:54:06 it works without the rotor!

isnt this weird! this is so bs.... i rlly dont know what's stopping the dumb thing from working with rotors attached  > : (

imma try diff combinations and see
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:54:30 it only works when i dont have any rotors, or when i use coaxial rotors
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:54:41 there's something i must be missing for single rotors to work
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:55:47 they on a rotating obj so the rotating obj spins the blades
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:56:49 ya
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:58:53 okay ill have to find integex and the other boi who created a japanese bomber
(the propeller engine seemed to only accomodate a single set of blades, and i saw that there were at elast 3 motors behind powering each other)

the engines rlly didnt seem to be able to fit another secret set of props inside
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:59:42 oof, okay ill have to get to u later cuz i have no clue where they are rn, am trying to search up pics in tiscord but most planes use coaxials unlike theirs
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:59:51 <@!221487880487436288> ya plz :C
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 18:59:56 are u able to follow me ingame?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:04:43 <@456226577798135808> u know, just ones like these, one set of propellers for each engine, there no way they have coaxial rotors right?
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:07:45 ya but every engine only has 1 rotor, am wondering how they got that one set of propellers to spin without using coaxials OOF
plane-crazy 2019-02-20 19:09:06 wait but my stack of motors dont even spin if im not using coaxial for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:41:24 party in club noob!
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:46:09 why does my game totally freeze up the moment i try to use these 3 rockets to boost my flying nightclub?
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:47:03 the only working parts on this giant machne are the four coaxial rotors :C
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:47:32 ive tried installing a magnet drive too to help boost its speed but that froze the game as well on activation > : (
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:49:23 ya
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:49:55 : / i like mine, i only liked his outer decoration which is the smiley face
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:50:16 no need to bash my entire build lol, it still took a long time and it was my first time creating working rotors too
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:51:13 look, i dont get what gets you so triggered over me just taking inspiration from his goddamn roblox smiley face... what other face can i use?

i just wanted a giant silly thing that can lift something (the nightclub) which ive totally built on my own
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:52:43 i have a legitamate question about my rockets and game freezing and idk what i should do to fix it, but you on the other hand decided to focus purely on the other aspects of the build, totally ignoring my plea for help and be a sour bitch over design
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:52:54 k
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:52:59 i dont want to go about it anyways
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:53:03 absolutely pointless
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:53:32 <@192861290677534722> thx for ur design xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:53:55 found it to be something unique instead of the countless airbus airframes ppl create on a daily basis
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:56:45 oof just found some tiny magnet i forgot from my last save which froze my game


but why do magnets freeze up my game when i activate them? i have built other magnet-drive planes that work smoothly but the magnet drive on my flying smiley freezes my game :C
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:57:10 : C ok
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 05:58:37 lmao oofers are a chat topic again
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:04:13 <@192861290677534722> did you use additional rockets or some hidden rotors to turn ur giant ship side to side?

i just dont like using rockets :C, their flames kill the ship's blockly vibe
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:04:34 o hoi!
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:04:42 oh oof
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:04:46 <@!221487880487436288> : O
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:05:21 lololol!!!!!! nice!

only thing i got working today was the giant smiley dron i built
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:05:55 it finally flies now :D

ive added enough helium beams to it so it can float in the air, then the rotors do the rest of the work to move it forward
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:06:22 ye! 

im in public server building smthing rn, if u want to follow me in
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:06:34 o yea!
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:07:25 btw i was about to add a missile bay to the giant ship but was afraid that he missiles might be too heavy (have to add even more helium)

i built some missiles before
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:07:26 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:07:27 i coming
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:08:07 yeh i should go make light ones instead
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:08:23 the ones i had in mind were giant guided clusterbombs xd

yea
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:08:46 o wait i went to that private server we wetn earleir today, are u in another one?
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:09:34 oh xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:10:07 yay now im in
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:10:47 i wonder what i should build now, the giant smiley ship is too slow for combat
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 06:18:17 i sometimes use rockets and if that fails then it's tiem to re-flip the thing xd
creations-chat 2019-02-21 19:16:13 ya
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 19:42:13 nice looking glow cars xd
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 19:49:03 oh damn! havent seen those in so long!
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 19:49:52 it's dis!
plane-crazy 2019-02-21 19:50:02 one of those old hand cranked thingies
creations-chat 2019-02-22 01:47:14 u should launch it in the sea
creations-chat 2019-02-22 01:52:40 not much need to chase someone down like that and interrogate the dude for an answer tbh


<@!346643048786296833> Oi was it ur betty bomber that had the small bomb plane attached underneath?
creations-chat 2019-02-22 01:53:20 oh i sat on someoen else's betty once
creations-chat 2019-02-22 01:55:12 and was rlly interested about how his motors worked


ok, ik, it's just similar to how there's always a few dislikes on youtube videos, ppl may have their own strange reasons and it just easier to let em be
creations-chat 2019-02-22 02:00:18 LOL what happened
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 02:08:46 yay i finally made a first working rocket artillery piece :D

now ill expand the thing into a full size MLRS
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 02:12:34 o dam i should come too
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 02:18:42 enjoy my made in china oofer

plane-crazy 2019-02-22 05:32:07 ?!?!?!! o nu
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 06:15:15 !!!11!!1!
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 06:17:03 btw here is a big stack of 12 rockets

should i expand it by adding another row or start buiding a tank around it now : O
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 06:18:46 oofie okie

i tried to use magnets to power the tnt earlier, but the magnetic fields kept afffecting the other "rockets" too

plane-crazy 2019-02-22 06:19:56 damn
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 06:21:15 : )

me personally, i would build it right in the middle section, ontop of where the wedges are
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 06:24:38 xd ya

im wondering if i should add a feature which would tilt the side sections of the launch thingy, so the rockets would cover a larger area (disperse them)
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 06:24:40 LOL
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 06:25:03 dont think anyone did tbh, either that or i muted chanel notifs

plane-crazy 2019-02-22 07:34:24 me i think its one of his versatile combat platforms, he had another design and it had at least two modifcations: one was a minelayer with a mounted machinegun on the top, the other had a giant missile launcher to seek out long range targets

this one is another design tho
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 07:34:48 oh right this one deploys mini vehicles xdd
plane-crazy 2019-02-22 07:35:13 big ship!

plane-crazy 2019-02-23 00:09:20 > : O 

the only working motor stack (with a propeller)  i have is one with a block ontop of the 2nd last motor which stops the first 3 motors from spinning except for the front motor... and if i removed that block then the middle motors spin except for the front motor which has the blade attached
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 00:09:31 integex can i pls see ur stack pls pls
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 00:09:54 nu, whats that for?

plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:48:59 idk, is it better to use the first type of cylinder wheels  (the first pair), or the second type (the one in the rear)?
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:49:27 : C
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:49:35 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:49:55 just a general concept for my rocket artillery tank, but yeh, i widen it
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:52:29 <@!511080180966752256> but i wonder which type of wheel would function better, an which type do you prefer? the wheel with a single supension and motor or the two wheels that are attached to two motors which use the same suspension?
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:54:09 ai Imperial, out of the two types of wheels from that pic of my example car, whihc type of wheel would u recommend me use for  this tank?
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:54:32 here is the old pic incase u dont wanna go look for it
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 06:54:54 oh thx a ton!

creations-chat 2019-02-23 20:40:23 My own fictional build: Rocket Artillery

A massive long-range rocket launcher (holds 12 rockets) mounted on a heavy 8x8 chassis. 

The dual purpose high speed rockets, powered by 2 super rocket engines each, can seek out targets anywhere on the map (and can even be fired from behind cover, as they travel along a curved trajectory). They fire all at once so this weapon can also be used to swarm aircraft.

The vehicle itself can travel at up to speeds of 200~, has good off-road capabilities, and can pivot in place.
creations-chat 2019-02-23 20:40:55 Picture of it launching the rockets
plane-crazy 2019-02-23 20:45:47 what is its AA weapon?

plane-crazy 2019-03-12 01:58:48 ye it kinda weird, but it's good to know that what u submit is to appeal to *others*, not rlly urself, so sometimes what ur idea of a high ratings creation wont match theirs

general 2019-03-17 19:19:12 was thinking of just deleting the part, slapping in a glass shattering arudio effect and throwing in a 2-3s long "effect" (like a big cloud of teeny glass cubes after the actual glass pane is gone)

plane-crazy 2019-03-26 18:45:01 "crap"
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 18:45:05 xd
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 18:45:29 looks like a modern design, id build it to be a missile cruiser
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 18:46:00 thats one hell of a submarine
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:24:00 <@!486674992981999648> u building up a fleet? : O
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:24:07 o dam
plane-crazy 2019-03-26 22:24:13 can i see ur boats plz
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 00:57:38 yay i just made an automatic cannon : D
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 00:57:51 : O
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:02:18 that's dumb :C

rank should've been kept
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:03:23 oh not possible to replicate? :C
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:04:30 wtf a block requirement?! :C

oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:05:27 personally, if it's an unique mechanism that can be implemented to other creations, then it's inventor rank material lol, 500 blocks is quite a bit
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:06:01 yeh ik that's why i said personally
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:06:34 btw here's my lil burst-firing cannon > : D https://giphy.com/gifs/OOkaNm1zQz1KJfTUvB
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:07:15 maybe ill give it the ability to reload magazines
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:08:36 : D

imagine it mounted onto ships/planes, would be fun for pvp
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:10:12 yea! the best thing is that it fires all the tnt in one quick burst, so you can lay down some heavy firepower rlly quickly
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:14:14 i wonder how should i increase mag size for my cannon... maybe i create new separate mags that can be fitted onto the cannon after the previous ones run empty, or i make it semi-auto so that i can just have one giant mag feeding the gun (all the balls flowing into the main gun)
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:14:45 : D
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:21:40 you could draw it out lol, or heck, just make some effective pvp machines instead of going for those perfect aesthetics
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:23:22 yeh just try to use all the diff wedges to replicate the stuka body shape
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:24:43 it takes a long time, but ur gunna have to put that in if u wanna end up with an outstanding creation
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:26:19 last time i made a  plane was like... 3 months ago


all u have to do is add enough wings in the right palces to lift the thing into th air
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:26:30 then add engines for propulsion
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:37:47 ww2 jap engineers were insane

plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:39:22 <@!185171693566689280> ya yamato was a failure, especially how they used it LOL
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:39:55 they didnt have the industrial power to build up a fleet so they tried to use yamato to 1v6 the murican boats

plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:49:27 oh ok
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:49:39 see, the problem with semi is that i have to set a diff hotkey for every tnt ball
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:50:13 i say orange and white xdd
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:52:12 <@!250338477202210826> how about ur gun? are u using magnets to shoot the balls?

btw how would ur gun fire? are u going to fire the balls one by one or all at once?

plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:52:53 o damn!

plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:53:57 how did u know?!
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:54:26 btw i find explode on impact hard to do, what is impact speed? mininum speed for detonation?
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:54:35 <@!250338477202210826> but wont balls have diff mass tho
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:55:04 damn...
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:55:29 fuq,see that's why i find it unreliable... it better be minimum speed for explosion or else fuq it
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 01:55:41 no way ur getting exact numbers

plane-crazy 2019-05-09 19:25:17 has anyone made a reliable AA weapon?

the closest thing i have is just a box of 150 explosive balls with a line of magnets behind it that shoots the stuff as a massive cloud of death... but since i have so many balls the weapon lags a lot during firing :C
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 19:26:02 whers titanic
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 19:26:46 <@!304977711988867072> yeh but some planes are extremely fast so hit rate is rlly low

thats why i decided to use a weapon that covers a general area in explosives to make up for bad aim XDDD
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 19:28:10 try lowering torque
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 19:28:36 the end of the motor which connects to the rest of the heli should be loose i think
plane-crazy 2019-05-09 19:41:58 <@!304977711988867072> Here's my AA

plane-crazy 2019-06-23 03:37:08 shit something happened before this :C
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 23:15:16 my first attempt at using explosive cannons on planes
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 23:15:32 worst problem is the lag... there
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 23:15:41 there's a massive lag spike everytime i fire the cannon
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 23:23:30 big miss
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:19:37 ill bomb ur tanks up
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 01:20:26 woa that's one fast tank
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:15:44 hey jameson, have u ever tried using explosive ball launchers on airplanes?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:17:38 i tried one today but the worst problem is that the magnet lags asf when i activate it... so by the time the lag subsides my target's changed position by too much
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:18:40 woa i see ur cannon barrel has a 1 block width, does it launch explosive balls?
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:19:48 tbh ive never seen a functioning tracked vehicle in roblox
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:20:06 no one's made one yet
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:20:15 o crap where
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:20:29 wtf?! I need to see this
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:20:48 'merry xmas
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:22:40 i have my DOUBTS about how well that yellow tracked vehicle kit works... it seems familiar.... like something i played with in blox studio back when  i was a skid
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:23:21 wait, but it seems that the tracks could legit fAll off tho (isnt it a fm?)
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:24:38 OMG IT'S THAT ONE

it does look pretty nice when it's running properly.. but sometimes it glitches out for me and the tracks go oof
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:25:23 those i think are made entirely from spring constraints and stuff like that (ive never rlly worked with those in studio)

i just wanna see someone make a more scripted suspension like
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:26:03 oh yeh lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:27:11 yeh they're prehistoric, but imo they still work a bit better than the ones in roblox :C
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 03:29:01 lmfao vip's post

plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:20:51 i play whatever i like, i dont let ratings decide for myself... i create my own opinion of it by playing it myself lmao
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:21:46 biggest reason why they're trending is because most gamers are young children, and those games appeal to those younger ages

plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:34:33 stil is a thing
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:36:06 more like during the ship heist, you accidentally burn ur entire house down  before leaving and blame it on a hookah Caterpillar
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:36:42 and trip over a crocodile just to get ur head munched off
plane-crazy 2019-07-20 04:37:35 <@!335599526414909451> wdym tactical builds?
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:43:23 <@456226577798135808> Keep ur creation small (keep the block count low)

near the end of the creation, place a magnet facing where you want ur creation to move and adjust its settings to how u want xd
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:44:20 I think the way how magnets work here is that they put some kind of force on any unanchored obj (regardless of whether its attached to the magnet or not)
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:44:36 <@456226577798135808> ye pretty much
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:44:57 u could also use a spring instead of directly attaching the magnet to ur plane
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:45:33 it actually does tbh, i did have magnets in that config before that have moved my creation
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:46:19 i usually use magnets to fire explosive balls lmfao like dis
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:46:50 ^
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:47:40 <@!313403326081531914> yeh fuck, i really dont know why they dont detnate on impact, even tho I armed em all and impact speed is set to 5
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:48:54 <@456226577798135808> oh that's cuz ur magnetic field's facing backwards of ur plane
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:50:34 jesus he plays a lot, lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:51:00 nvm that was rocket artillery
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:51:29 but yeh, basically AAMs would just be those mounted on a plane lel
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:51:39 ya, wait ill find it for u
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:53:36 <@!313403326081531914> try to make the most effective pvp creation ever lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:53:46 i tested a couple concepts but results were bleh
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:53:49 nah :C
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:54:02 ppl are just too busy with their passenger jet shiets
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 02:54:20 <@!587406379451678722> yeh, but they could always be improved
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 03:04:18 try to make an effective ground attack aircraft that doesnt use the pre-made pvp weapons :C
plane-crazy 2019-07-23 03:04:30 if the balls actually exploded on impact, this plane would be decent...
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 18:54:46 if his moderating abilities are exceptional, then i dont see why u shouldnt keep him lol

it's not like it costs anything to employ u guys; ur all volunteers : P
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 18:56:44 i mean, just cuz he doesnt chat much doesnt have to mean he isn't watching over the chat at all tho
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 19:00:22 Not like the age restriction means much anyways... there's almost no way to rlly verify the age of an applicant without demanding their real id's lol
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 19:02:20 Not sure why everyone's soo hyped up about becoming a  mod; shit's volunteer work where you'd have to monitor the chat for nothing :C

Like srsly, what is so hype about this?
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 19:06:06 i only watched the third
plane-crazy 2019-07-25 19:06:53 it's really violent xd, but that's good, since violence of action is what john wick's all about

plane-crazy 2019-07-31 17:49:30 that sounds pretty cool tbh
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 17:49:39 reminded me of this land fortress someone made
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 17:49:42 :C
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 17:50:16 hmmm... what if u convert it to a giant rail fortress?
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 17:50:33 (nvm turns are too damn tight and building space is too small to build anything large)
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 17:50:40 wat
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 17:50:47 ay sir
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 17:51:15 omg is that
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 17:51:18 THE 2010 SONG
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 17:51:55 <@!561734378758340649> im so sad now... all those minecraft parody songs from 2010 that we used to sing
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 17:52:28 not minecraft xd, just what we used to do all those years ago
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 17:53:13 shiet 2013 is when i left elementary school
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 17:53:37 I think all those russian fighter jets are chonk asf, especially the SU series irl
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 17:55:05 it's fucking massive tbh
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 17:57:40 u want chonk?? here's chonk
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 17:57:52 yeh rockets are fugly
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:03:44 damn shit, once ur able to mount flamethrowers, ur ship would be op
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:05:57 hopefully rickje adds new gun weaponry too to go along with the flamethrower
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:06:42 howitzer cannons, dedicated AA guns that launch flak shells whic h would explode once in proximity of another player's aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:06:45 :C
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:07:07 yeh maybe in future
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:07:20 <@!413503076490805280> the flamethrower seems pretty light tho
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:07:58 true :C

better than what we have now tho (measly attempts at SAMs and ball cannons lmfao)
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:08:10 oh righty
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:08:53 definetly not
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:09:08 it's extremely difficult to build large trains and ships
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:09:18 <@!413503076490805280> o y's that?
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:09:57 is it also cos.. well that planes are so damn easy to fly? They're nearly helicopters at this point since most are so light
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:12:47 yeh lol, it's so damn hard trying to hit anything moving as a turret
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 18:12:53 apt?
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 19:34:49 rickje, ive set my explosive balls to explode on impact (impact speed being 5), they're armed but they dont explode even when they hit the ground?!

is it something to do with magnets? cos i used them to launch the balls
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 19:35:30 oh wat... not ground?!
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 19:36:08 but i have a giant rocket artillery pod, and its missiles explode when the explosives touch the ground
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 19:36:25 ikr!!!!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 20:38:39 the fugly bomb
plane-crazy 2019-07-31 20:39:56 yes just.. do it xd

plane-crazy 2019-08-01 05:53:15 yeh true
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 05:53:37 im trying to make a teeny helijet but even that isnt working properly f
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 05:53:45 bottom motor is loose yet still spins like nuts
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 05:55:06 does anyoen have a working coaxial rotor setup?
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 05:55:51 my setup is :

top motor: power on, max speed
mid motor: power on, max speed
bottom motor: powered off, max speed
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 05:57:58 can anyone halp me? my friggon coaxial rotors arent working since they make my heli spin
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 05:58:12 oof
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 06:06:16 oh fuq ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 06:06:45 double the speed & torque..
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 06:09:38 torque is doubled too right?
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 06:15:40 i really dont understand why my heli still spins after changing the motor settings to this (double speed and torque on top)
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 06:18:36 fuck my a$$, yeh ill do that
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 06:19:16 okie:
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 17:55:18 what on earth is a "tsunami base"
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 17:56:06 !!!!!!!1!!1!11
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 18:59:02 still havent figured out a way to fix my coaxial rotors so instead of having one main rotor, i have two lol... now my heli's a miniature tilt rotor
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 19:00:18 lol!
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 19:00:52 wait, is double coaxial supposed to be harder or wat?
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 19:01:44 i just couldnt cancel out the torque from my coaxial rotor

oh fuck
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 19:02:04 lmfao now i just look crazy
plane-crazy 2019-08-01 21:58:28 <@!249373398612967441> woa rlly?

plane-crazy 2019-08-02 00:26:20 not to start shit up but i just dont understand why ppl here get so triggered/annoyed by others copying their creations
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 00:26:33 ?! not paint.net?
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 00:26:48 :C
creations-chat 2019-08-02 01:14:32 Tilt-rotor helicopter : D

A compact personal aircraft modified as a gunship:
It has 6 hardpoints (two underneath each wing , one on the cockpit,  and another under its belly). It is currently equipped with a gun turret, 4 rockets, and a long-range guided missile

Fairly agile but weak to fast enemy airplanes. Strong against land vehicles and ships.

Max Speed: 80
creations-chat 2019-08-02 01:15:15 Launching the underbelly missile:
creations-chat 2019-08-02 01:15:49 Right before being someone's confirmed kill :C

plane-crazy 2019-08-02 01:26:30 <@456226577798135808> read a book, drop the angle dust
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 01:26:50 mind = blown
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 01:27:34 it can lol, simple, wind blows on surface and the air pushes the earth
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 01:28:27 not much, our masses are too small, wind on the other hand can cause a tsunami in a desert since its air is that powerful
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 01:29:25 put a bar of magnets in the middle, cover the outside with explosive balls and boom you've got a cluster bomb (closest to a nuke we can get)
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 01:31:01 <@456226577798135808> because gravity
plane-crazy 2019-08-02 01:31:37 guys i kinda doubt we're talking to someone who's on the same planet

plane-crazy 2019-08-16 21:08:37 ikr, it has no range, at least give it some massive dps to make up for the range difference
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 21:09:14 yea cmon bruh rickje why make spitters like this
creations-chat 2019-08-16 21:09:24 so realistic

plane-crazy 2019-08-16 21:22:41 <@456226577798135808> half the time the player's well hidden within their own design
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 21:22:54 unless ur talkig about those 80 block fighter planes
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 21:22:58 but then they're way too fast
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 21:23:01 for ur flames
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 21:23:04 u have to get too close
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 21:35:12 no way for war thunder to be realistic, too many things to account for and the arcady gameplay would go to shit

plane-crazy 2019-09-17 04:35:25 yolo lets try making some swivel engines
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 04:35:43 (servo motors)
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 04:36:41 oi anyone wanna try using servo motors to make an automatic swivel engine?
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 04:36:54 pls
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 04:56:46 FIRST TIME FLYING WITH A SWIVEL ENGINE XD
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 04:56:51 (an automatic swivel engine)
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 04:59:42 ded
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 05:00:31 u shuld try one too, use servo motors only
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 05:18:59 YASSS my automatic swivel engine is finally capable of replacing control surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 05:19:33 muh "invention"
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 05:20:39 i used motor2 so it's automatic
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 05:21:21 Yea it pretty much flies where i point
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 05:21:45 problem is that it does sway a little even tho it flies in the direction it's going
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 05:21:53 LOL nu
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 05:22:12 i think i just colored my own nick pink via a bot command
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 05:22:37 imma try to improve the swivel a lil to reduce the swaying
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 05:33:47 too much swaying rip https://giphy.com/gifs/iEuQOPTXyshG6o3bKg
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 05:34:13 at least plane is capable of controlling its general direction without control surfaces :C
plane-crazy 2019-09-17 05:34:29 <@!322970944303923200> my 1st attempt at a swivel engine

creations-chat 2019-09-17 06:22:12 **who needs control surfaces??** 

https://giphy.com/gifs/iEuQOPTXyshG6o3bKg
creations-chat 2019-09-17 06:28:09 btw u can reduce the tilt by decreasing max-angle of rotation for the 2 motors controlling its pitch.

Cant completely eliminate swaying due to how the motor controlling roll is always rotating whenever the plane changes its direction oof
creations-chat 2019-09-17 06:38:49 Got the sway from the autmatic swivel-engine down a bit, at the cost of turn radius tho :C At least it **woorks**

plane-crazy 2019-09-18 03:17:50 prolly time to *not use the roblox engine* lol. Unless ur able to create a wind environment + additional physics that would allow ships to hav efunctional sails
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 03:19:46 XD
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 03:21:16 common sense XD

Something pushes the ship from its side, causes it to tip a lil

plane-crazy 2019-09-18 03:49:40 i made one and it could steer my plane without any help from control surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 03:49:53 it's pretty simple tbh
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 03:50:07 3 servo motors to cover all angles of rotation
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 06:31:31 guud ship
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 06:31:59 Mounting automatic swivel engines onto fighters 😄
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 06:32:29 saves adding all those addition steering rocket boosters and control surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 06:34:27 yes i saw

but it looks oustanding tho
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 06:37:39 good question honestly... for the bigger fighter like the one i just made, it was cranked all the way to 40
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 06:37:58 and it swayed a lot less for some reason
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 06:38:59 really dont understand why. It's all due to how the motor responds to the position of cursor on the screen and the current postion/direction of the aircraft. I dont know how the motor2 actually works so... jsut big guesses
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 06:39:11 OH OOPS
plane-crazy 2019-09-18 06:39:13 nvm then

plane-crazy 2019-10-14 23:17:59 Do little things like that even matter? Could literally just ignore them and continue on with the main point of whatever u were trying to argue for before lol.
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 23:20:00 eh well vip u chose to respond to that shit and tilt the entire convo towards just tryna to disprove whatever he's saying without any main focus :/

this is where we are now, just two guys completely tangled up by earlier over-reactions
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 23:20:12 yeh we gotta stop talking about it
plane-crazy 2019-10-14 23:20:34 let's hate on how motor 2s are broke now :C

creations-chat 2019-12-05 18:14:17 wtf is wrong with you guys lmao

It's just a different take on a VTOL. To me it looks something like a low-poly mesh from blender, so it's pretty cute in that way
creations-chat 2019-12-05 18:15:55 <@!451025784228806656> You're just doing it for the sake of being able to do so... lol. Pretty petty shit. Not all creations have to be hyper realistic ffs
creations-chat 2019-12-05 18:16:27 and?
creations-chat 2019-12-05 18:16:41 Nope
creations-chat 2019-12-05 18:17:35 You're putting words in my mouth. There's always an extent when something's too bad, and that's when ppl should step in hard.
creations-chat 2019-12-05 18:17:48 Ikr
creations-chat 2019-12-05 18:19:12 You probably should, because I see this same shitty attitude everywhere in the channel. I remember one guy creating his first tank and immdiately everyone ganged-up to throw mad shade on his lil creation. Poor dude left the server.
creations-chat 2019-12-05 18:20:11 Why tf would he add camo?

plane-crazy 2019-12-08 23:55:13 I'd say 600 is a minimum, after that you just work on the plane's maneuverability

plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:10:00 having pre-made kits is for convenience fffs...

wtf?! Then they might as well remove rockets since we can already make our own with the explosive blocks and shit
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:10:40 I couldn't care less about "rankings" and making breakthrough combat inventions when all i want is a small 1x1 cannon
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:10:49 so no one would have to keep creatig those magnet cannons
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:11:36 Every "cannon" rn needs to have a 1x1 barrel width, and with the barrel added on, it basically comes at least 3 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:11:55 bruh pls!!!!!!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:12:19 There is no fucking points since they would only have limited ammunition
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:13:44 It is easy, no one is debating that at all lmao what are u onto. The problem is that they suck lol. They cant be mounted onto aircraft, and even if u decide to put it on a warship, they're going to be a massive waste of space the moment they've fired.
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:14:20 here's the closest thing you can prolly get to an aircraft  "cannon"
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:14:58 Dude, placing blocks on a grid with only basic use of ur frontal cortex doesnt compare at all to what engineering really is.
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:15:06 It's got a pvp element to it too..
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:15:49 I'm arguing for convenience, so spare me your "engineering" bullshit as if you think of yourselv as one lmao
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:20:30 So i take it that you completely ignored my previous comments lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:21:01 btw i suggested it
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:21:04 <@!531625591380770831> <@!531625591380770831> "It is easy, no one is debating that at all. The problem is that they suck lol. They cant be mounted onto aircraft, and even if u decide to put it on a warship, they're going to be a massive waste of space the moment they've fired."
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:22:34 <@!531625591380770831> yea and you're going to have to carve in more space for each shot... why would anyone do that when they have machine guns and rockets with limitless ammo?
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:23:13 Because there's nothign in between
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:23:21 People create tanks and warships
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:23:24 this is all for them
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:24:04 "pvp mode"
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:24:07 mm
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:25:06 <@!505835349889777685> well there are hundreds of them
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:25:14 it's not YOUR game lmfao
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:25:25 those players who absolutely suck
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:25:36 guys who can barely piece together anything more than a 80 block gun cart
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:27:00 Yea the cannon is literally just the part that fires. Everything else can be a custom extension
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:27:41 what the fuck we're literally going in circles here... talking about how they fucking suck in pvp compared to the current wepaons <@!238017332872478720>
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:27:43 dude wtf
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:27:57 ..... ikr
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:28:24 <@!238017332872478720> we've been discussing that literally 5 minutes before
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:28:37 <@!210141202698338304> excatly, and you cant reload effectively when ur moving fast
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:29:25 "if u try hard enough there'll be enough space" No dude, the plane is only so big lmao
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:29:46 <@!210141202698338304> IKR i used to be big on them, then i gave up
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:30:39 <@!238017332872478720> Extra weaponry... not to mention warships and tanks would make big use of them
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:31:25 ..... what the fuck man they're still too big and inefficient use of space
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:31:33 I FUCKING IDD
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:31:34 DID
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:31:35 bruh
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:31:39 u trollign the crap out of me
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:37:33 ships are real majestic
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:37:38 i never had the patience for em OOOOOF
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:37:54 woa
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:38:00 damn thats a cool ship
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 01:38:24 ww2 equivalent of kiev lol!

oh i c
creations-chat 2019-12-09 02:01:25 <@!210141202698338304> crap what was it, i really want to read it now lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 02:01:55 the noob-21
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 02:02:16 yea OOF
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 02:02:28 at least it's agile asf
the-dump 2019-12-09 02:48:13 
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:01:56 this is what happens to furries https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcjp9pvcrEY
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:02:10 NO
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:02:39 yea that's more like on the cosplay side of things
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:02:55 furries are...
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:03:13 dang u just saved urself death!
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:11:45 holy fucking shit yea what happened? I do remember katz and she was really... extreme and random sometimes, but i never paid much attention to that before
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:12:28 I do remember seeing katz online like.. literally 24/7
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:15:34 cheating is fun as shit if you have real friends by ur side watching u fuck shit up (ngl)
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:15:57 otherwise u might as well just be playing the game properly
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:23:40 here's the basic structure:

piston->conveyor block facing either up or down -> empty space
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:27:32 furrie alert
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:27:41 <@456226577798135808> oh just incase u messed it up
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:27:49 what does the plane look like?
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:29:27 ye ^, but sowwy if te reason behind my posting wasnt clear :C

btw now it might have something to do with the lifting forces on ur plane; how the wings and weight are distributed
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:29:43 engine shuld work fine on its own
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:31:02 shiet, do u wanna show us a pic of whatever the engine is powering?

maybe we culd then narrow the problem down
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:34:49 ohya
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:36:03 damn ryeo just vanished oof, prolly testing thei corrections out or somthing
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:39:01 yeh u got a pic?
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:39:27 o dam!
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:40:36 band is litty
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:40:59 this is the engine i used https://youtu.be/ZQvsCB9CJsw
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:41:02 much easier
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:41:11 it takes on teh structure i described earlier
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:41:45 my plane goes litty with it. shaved off so much weight
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:41:52 o crap
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:42:09 wat wat wat
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:42:13 pls tell
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:43:20 whaaaaaaaaaaaa
the-dump 2019-12-09 05:44:25 ur heating up ur breakfast while im heating up ma dinner
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:49:12 here's how u get real battleship guns: upvote my cannon suggestion in <#507673335816126509>  BAHAHAH!!!!!!!!!
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:49:53 YUESONOFA
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:51:07 btw omfg i just saw that whitelisting usggestion
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:51:11 that would be so lit
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:51:21 having a full bomber crew etc
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 05:52:23 WH..WHA..AREU SRS
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 21:08:31 that is fucking cool and effective
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:22:59 i thought rickje was making this map
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:24:15 ikr
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:24:49 the bridges have curves to them and the island chain looks a lot more realistic (since it's so smoothed out)
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:25:25 BRUH...
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:25:40 wtf?! I'd legit jump in after dec18th and start sculpting
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:26:16 Theres so many ppl here online 24/7 and no one wants to make a proper map?! RAGE!
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:28:18 damn... if only i got to join OOFFFFF
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:28:26 yea!
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:28:45 all they gotta do is follow the general topography, and get the scale right
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:28:52 yea lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:29:52 ^^ excatly
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:29:56 the map has great flow
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:31:43 the bridges here... BRUH moment. They should create a kit of straight sections and turns so they can end up creating diff bridges (going and twisting in diff directions) with a consistent style
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:34:16 If they use blender to turn everything into low-poly meshes, there would be no lag.
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:35:08 Cos any faces of an obj which u dont see dont get rendered
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:35:41 Think about the Jailbreak map. Their ultra low poly designs really work to minimize any lag
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:35:57 oh gud
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:37:11 Oh cos it was just for a submission preview right?
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:37:51 *b r u h* oof
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:39:58 The map structures kinda look like free-models: they just have pretty different styles and dont seem to fit together. Some parts arent really polished, like the bridge, so there's rough edges and etc that players would certaintly notice.

Sorry if i seem kinda rough/hating, i just wanted to specifcy what excatly should be worked on for an official release
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:40:14 that way we all get a great product at the end
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:40:51 I defintely prefer the 1st place concept. The execution can be improved
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:40:55 ^
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:41:11 same
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:41:19 ^^^^^
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:41:33 Have to agree, yea, it's all about having a great map in the end
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:42:00 Should just get the best builders together on the project
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:42:30 <@218240161719386112> the size is massive so it might tkae a long time, unless maybe u try that topographic shader feature to let studio automatically sculpt the terrain?
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:42:46 noiceee that's all yall need other than terrain
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:43:10 yea
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:43:43 excatly. I'll be truly free after the 18th so I can ho[p in after that
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:44:06 yea this should def from a community effort
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:45:10 We should get rickje to approve that we're doing this first, so our finished work wont be for nothing if he.. for some reason.. rejects it LMFAO

idk maybe that's too extreme
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:45:19 Creating a proper map for the game
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:46:32 Yea, but it seems like rickje isnt gonna make it himself :C
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:47:24 oof :C that's sad asf
plane-crazy 2019-12-09 22:47:38 LOL WT

plane-crazy 2019-12-10 02:02:19 OH
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 02:04:27 <@!587406379451678722> wait where would the motor 2 be? On my creation, and then the rope goes under the motor2?
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 02:05:48 <@!505835349889777685> oh like one ned of the motor2 is attached to my dropship

general 2020-01-10 02:53:11 Plane crazy is the reason why we're all here, otherwise it might as well just be named "off-topic"
general 2020-01-10 02:53:29 WAT
general 2020-01-10 02:53:49 (yea, ironic)
general 2020-01-10 02:54:06 ^

general 2020-01-10 02:54:35 lmao!
general 2020-01-10 02:54:57 admin time!!11!11
general 2020-01-10 02:57:11 i honestly dont think enforcing this, until the name change happens, is worth it
general 2020-01-10 02:58:04 Not to stir things up, but people can easily randomly drop in and say something without looking hard at the ongoing convo
general 2020-01-10 02:58:28 lmao
general 2020-01-10 02:58:49 Well it is what people do lmao..

general 2020-01-10 03:03:58 Look bruh you could've chose to just let us talk about anything we please, then step in later after the name-change when everyone would quickly understand. 

Now ur just dealing with the "drop-ins" who'll be coming randomly, and it's getting a teeny bit heated cos people are getting slammed by sudden changes like this
general 2020-01-10 03:04:21 Convo's now fucked up and everybody's bickering
general 2020-01-10 03:05:07 Ngl i talked about plane-crazy here plenty of times before. Been here for about ~year already, when did this rule happen and get enforced?
general 2020-01-10 03:05:39 ye and there'll be more like him.. just get those phat admins to rename the thing so u two dont have to stick around goading the clueless
general 2020-01-10 03:06:40 and no one even thought of re-naming the channel to "off-topic".. incredible!

Try putting some control-engines at the sides here
creations-chat 2020-01-18 08:04:04 The closer they are to the tip of a boat, the faster the turning wuld be
creations-chat 2020-01-18 08:04:30 Oh woops, i just meant engines facing the sides. They're only used for steering lele, unlike the main engines u have powering the boat forward
creations-chat 2020-01-18 08:07:33 oh shiet. Hmm i remember water was tough as hell to move in. I think all u can do atm is to put even more of those steering engines, and crank em on to on/off mode so they'll hit full-power instantly
creations-chat 2020-01-18 08:08:21 Make sure only one side's engines are activated at a time lol, else they cancel each other out so u dont turn (if that's what happned)

<@!379298383795585044> Lol u done pretty well then. I didnt even notice that english wasn't ur primary language until u told me lol.
general 2020-01-24 00:53:05 dad drives a m5 abrams
general 2020-01-24 00:53:24 mark4 > abrams
general 2020-01-24 00:53:32 BRUH sherman was the best bruh
general 2020-01-24 00:53:37 is-2
general 2020-01-24 00:53:42 tiger was also pretty good
general 2020-01-24 00:54:12 sherman was a great medium tank. U can read a lot about why excatly it was the best tank the allies needed
general 2020-01-24 00:56:16 tigers were great for the amount of resources the germans had, cos the germans had a ton of elite tank crewmen who were real familair wiwth their tanks, and the tiger was only really deadly with the right crew.
general 2020-01-24 00:56:28 It kept em alive
general 2020-01-24 00:57:14 personally i think tigers, t34s and shermans were all pretty good. I think the is-2 was good too
general 2020-01-24 00:58:50 Tanks all the same really. Best way to compare diff tanks is to see how they fit into each army's doctrine and unit lol. Each weapon has a purpose so u can just gauge how well they are at that
general 2020-01-24 00:59:09 wait nvm then the differences get even bigger
general 2020-01-24 00:59:18 lolololol!
general 2020-01-24 00:59:33 Tigers would be hella hard to bring to the front-line
general 2020-01-24 00:59:37 all the way from american factories
general 2020-01-24 01:00:42 u see those ring shaped handles on the sherman? Those are what allowed it to be carried by ship and train all the way across the atlantic : O

I wonder how hard it wuld be to do the same with a tiger tank
general 2020-01-24 01:01:01 Ye maus was retarded OOF tho it was cool
general 2020-01-24 01:01:10 Allies had too many planes eep!
general 2020-01-24 01:01:27 <@!155149108183695360> stfu

general 2020-01-24 01:02:37 best ww2 tank. Fight me
general 2020-01-24 01:02:56 jk it was only really good at the beginning
general 2020-01-24 01:03:53 The armor was great and it was pretty fast as well i think. I kinda forgot how excatly the french lost even tho they had great tanks at the start
general 2020-01-24 01:04:16 yea abrams is bullshit. Usa shuld just revert to using shermans
general 2020-01-24 01:05:59 bruh panzer 3 were shit  > : O
general 2020-01-24 01:06:08 the long-barrled panzer 4s were pretty good tho
general 2020-01-24 01:06:24 tiger 2 was slow as hell tho
general 2020-01-24 01:07:30 15-20km/h... that's just pathetic. Tiger 2s were probably bombed to shit
general 2020-01-24 01:07:34 damn bruh
general 2020-01-24 01:07:51 German infantry was op
general 2020-01-24 01:08:05 bruh!
general 2020-01-24 01:08:13 WAT
general 2020-01-24 01:08:22 u mean the civilian militias?
general 2020-01-24 01:09:25 I think even late war, the german infantry was still incredibly good. They still had elite outfits like fallschirmjager out and fighting
general 2020-01-24 01:10:00 XDDDDD
general 2020-01-24 01:11:16 spamming tank + not giving af about crew? sounds like the t34

You can restructure them in a way that doesnt change too much of thei initial handling, and still be able to accomodate whatev it is u wanna add lmao
plane-crazy 2020-01-26 01:07:33 sometimes i just take the basic concept behind a tutorial and go applying it to something else i wanna make

creations-chat 2020-01-29 23:09:22 it's as good as can be: a creation which clearly resembles the historical plane it's based on. Prolly functions nicely since it seemsto have good lift-weight ratio
general 2020-01-29 23:10:26 tbh if u wanna make a ship, just make on in blender or smthing and try to script it a couple functions urself lmfao.

I aint making sh* (ships) here until rickje adds the goddamn artillery cannon!
general 2020-01-29 23:11:00 what happened to that wooden cannon he was making btw? Is he making a diff model now?
general 2020-01-29 23:11:37 I wish a cannon here would just be a type of cylinder, with a ton of weight so ppl arent arming their upgunned tutorial chair-planes with em

plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:29:46 why do we need ray tracing..
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:30:09 that's so completely unrelated to plane crazy
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:30:20 ikr
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:30:40 i suppose reflection wuld be nice

wdym "abused"
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:30:45 abuse of what and for what
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:31:01 And why would u want that restriction?
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:31:14 flip across multiple planes or axis some shit
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:31:37 then scan the area (where the reflection would be) for any overlaps lmfao
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:34:22 why the hell does it even matter if it's abused or what not? The duplication, reflections etc only happens in the build state lmao
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:34:24 ikr
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:34:27 absolutely retarded
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:35:22 can you even explain *how* you "abuse" a build tool?
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:35:51 ikr these guys are out of their minds
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:35:57 <@!389502733490716673> what?! only on your own plot..
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:36:04 and ONLY when ur building
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:36:31 <@456226577798135808> same thing in spirit: they're both build tools that automatically create some sort of arrangement of blocks
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:37:08 yes it does lol
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:37:33 look man if ur unable to intuit even that, then there aint no helping u rn :CCCC ooof
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:37:45 that's literally why half the game functions even exist
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:37:54 the whole save system is to save time
plane-crazy 2020-01-29 23:38:08 so your dumb a$$ doesnt have to rebuild everything every time

general 2020-01-31 22:44:08 ikr their cause is so ridiculous
general 2020-02-01 05:04:54 Im sorry but which lame ass mod thought that amazon pic i posted was "racially sensitive"
general 2020-02-01 05:05:50 it was a terribly hilarious walmart shirt that got deleted from sales on amazon, soon after ppl saw it
general 2020-02-01 05:11:16 and how the hell is that racially sensitive. The word isn't even "nsfw" given the context, and ive seen people using it directly in chat
general 2020-02-01 05:11:34 No uproar was caused at all, some prolly had a nice giggle, and people moved on
general 2020-02-01 05:12:03 Not nsfw lmfao i literally just explained why BR A H!!!!!!!!!
general 2020-02-01 05:12:48 "a walmart shirt on amazon labelled 'daddy's lil slut"

general 2020-02-01 05:13:58 it aint nsfw, im not directing it towards anyone, and it's just part of the label really
general 2020-02-01 05:14:02 theres no visuals at all
general 2020-02-01 05:15:18 <@!322970944303923200> explain why excatly it is nsfw
general 2020-02-01 05:16:48 sure, but that doesnt translate to a whole nsfw picture
general 2020-02-01 05:17:18 the focus was on it being terrible, and the reactions of ppl who saw it on amazon
general 2020-02-01 05:17:29 bruh
general 2020-02-01 05:17:39 and?
general 2020-02-01 05:18:01 ikr, just move on
general 2020-02-01 05:18:55 not facts, just bullshit emotional vitriol yall spitting out lmao. It's almost like you want it to be nsfw
general 2020-02-01 05:19:07 this shouldve been an absolute non-issue
general 2020-02-01 05:19:41 <@!322970944303923200> that doesnt translate to a whole nsfw picture; 
the focus was on it being terrible, and the reactions of ppl who saw it on amazon
general 2020-02-01 05:20:12 so what?! that's just the single word, not the whole picture
general 2020-02-01 05:20:20 there's context attached to the pic ur ignoring
general 2020-02-01 05:20:30 <@456226577798135808> no because that isnt my logic lmao
general 2020-02-01 05:20:35 ok
general 2020-02-01 05:20:48 sure
general 2020-02-01 05:21:40 hey if you can barely explain your own reasoning how a single word, shown as PART of a label ON a t-shirt, with the focus clearly elsewhere translates to the whole picture being NSFW, then it's no one's fault but yours that i cant agree to ur standpoint
general 2020-02-01 05:22:00 these mods are lame as hell
general 2020-02-01 05:22:20 imma just eat this one for now

general 2020-02-07 04:13:53 dats nuts tho 😳
general 2020-02-07 04:14:23 You can use a texture from a high poly mesh, and bring it onto a much lower poly equivalent
general 2020-02-07 04:14:32 cos ppl would have to process that sh*
general 2020-02-07 04:14:54 LOL
general 2020-02-07 04:15:06 <@!587406379451678722> dont dont dont dont 😳
general 2020-02-07 04:15:24 but srsly tho, what are u trying to do with a mesh like that?
general 2020-02-07 04:15:43 Ohh lol
general 2020-02-07 04:15:49 NO
general 2020-02-07 04:15:57 AGH!!!!!!
general 2020-02-07 04:16:17 he's working on a super monster poly godzilla of the meshes
general 2020-02-07 04:18:25 On a more serious note tho, just create a texture off of the original high-poly one, and apply it onto a low-poly copy. It'll look just as good, without all the lag, as long as people dont stick their avatar camers right up to the thing like a goddam microscope
general 2020-02-07 04:18:39 It's how the they do it in wows
general 2020-02-07 04:18:52 sIR..

general 2020-02-07 04:22:46 I mean sure i guess...

it's just what i do when i make meshes, since they'll go into smol game. I try to keep their poly counts to an absolute minimum
plane-crazy 2020-02-07 04:24:32 tfw french occupation so sh* that everyone became commies

general 2020-02-07 04:34:44 Create ur own naval group or smthing lol!
general 2020-02-07 04:36:08 <@!435946988559925248> If u download blender and watch a couple tutorial vids, you'd be just as good lmfao

trust me, then youcan go make whatever u like
general 2020-02-07 04:36:18 :c
general 2020-02-07 04:36:45 the scWipts are what's actually valuable in there
general 2020-02-07 04:36:50 yea it's a mesh creator
general 2020-02-07 04:36:56 pre powerful for its free price
general 2020-02-07 04:37:01 it's real good ngl
general 2020-02-07 04:37:16 anything that isnt an easy polygon, i make it in blender
general 2020-02-07 04:37:33 the interface is complicated af at first, but once u get familiar with it, it'll be faster
general 2020-02-07 04:38:06 not at all it very diferent; what's easy i nstudio is hard in blender, and vice versa. Use both
general 2020-02-07 04:38:11 i go find a vid for u
general 2020-02-07 04:38:27 Yea
general 2020-02-07 04:39:14 Yea lol. The mesh is imported as a mesh "part", which has the same propeerties as any other roblox part (cancollide, color, sizing etc)
general 2020-02-07 04:39:53 <@!435946988559925248> a start : D https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICBP-7x7Chc
general 2020-02-07 04:43:30 <@!426156778007429140> dis https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/BasePart/CanCollide

basically every thing in roblox has a set of properties, like a characteristic u know: how big something is, its name, its physical qualities and stuff.

cancollide is one of em, for "parts" (physical objects), and it's basically a yes/no type setting that controls whether or not an object is gunna be considered by the roblox physics engine
general 2020-02-07 04:43:57 (if an object has collision physics)
general 2020-02-07 04:44:24 if not, then anything would just pass thru the obj, like what battleship was saying
general 2020-02-07 04:44:37 ya it's a big one  LOL

general 2020-02-07 04:47:01 it has  a lot
general 2020-02-07 04:47:05 so much i dont even know
general 2020-02-07 04:47:35 Most people use it for renders (like those front-page game thumbnail visuals u see), but i think that's just retarded
general 2020-02-07 04:47:41 yea
general 2020-02-07 04:47:43 EPIC
general 2020-02-07 04:48:05 it has a LOT of functions, u'd be a happi boi the more u get into it

general 2020-03-12 19:53:19 why are they separate categories lol. Understandings of the physics and bugs are still part of blox physics reeeeeeee
general 2020-03-12 19:53:55 since he doesnt "understand" enough of the blox physics, he doesnt know how to manipulate the properties of his build to his benefit
general 2020-03-12 19:54:16 wh..

general 2020-03-12 19:58:16 what does ur build look like?
general 2020-03-12 19:58:36 yeee
general 2020-03-12 19:59:17 right here
general 2020-03-12 19:59:28 you can upload files from ur pc
general 2020-03-12 20:00:09 !!!!!
general 2020-03-12 20:00:23 you had it on water right?
general 2020-03-12 20:00:57 high chance it migt've been the changes in wieght distrubition as the section holding the jaws rotate
general 2020-03-12 20:01:07 nothing big : D
general 2020-03-12 20:02:22 if desperate, try anchoring the base of the build LOL
general 2020-03-12 20:02:37 oh righttt
general 2020-03-12 20:03:39 if u haven't, change down the torque, then expand the base, cos the top looks really heavy
general 2020-03-12 20:04:58 try it lel
general 2020-03-12 20:05:14 <@!275416878325825546> yea that should help
general 2020-03-12 20:05:24 the wider the better
general 2020-03-12 20:08:56 as long as the jaws are lighter than the base, and the base is stable enough to allow diff movements of the jaws (an whole build), then ur good
general 2020-03-12 20:09:37 add weights to the base and lighten the jaws with yolo
general 2020-03-12 20:09:53 smoke weed and skip school
general 2020-03-12 20:09:59 👍
general 2020-03-12 20:14:08 yea, whatever works really. now die
