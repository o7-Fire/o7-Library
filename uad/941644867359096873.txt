plane-crazy 2023-01-14 11:29:58 Not this kind of space
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 11:30:11 I'm building a mech
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 11:30:19 But it's too big
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 11:30:48 This will be kinda hard
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 11:32:10 since it's a spider and the legs can get in the way when folding
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 11:33:26 If i could send pictures
plane-crazy 2023-01-14 11:34:05 Just search on google MG Exselsus then

plane-crazy 2023-01-14 11:35:48 But i think it is too big to fit it all on one plot
