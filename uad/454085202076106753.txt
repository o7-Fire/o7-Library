plane-crazy 2020-09-30 14:20:34 **a sherman tank its just to round for plane crazy at my skill level**
plane-crazy 2020-09-30 14:21:48 The hull was easy

plane-crazy 2020-09-30 14:31:34 Updated username
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:17:13 I tryed making a b-24 liberator but made it to tall
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:17:56 Not yet
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:18:28 But i learned how to make motor lock custom wings that looks good
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:19:05 2 half blocks with a wing in the middle connected by motor lock
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:21:16 The reason i picked to make a b-24 is because its a plane you don't see much and i have a game were you use a b-24 so i can use it to help with the inside
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:23:14 That seems to be a motor 2
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:24:07 I been learning how to make stuff fold and also learning a bit of motorlocks
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:29:07 Looks like crap and tall
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:29:07 
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:29:56 Its still way to tall
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:30:22 I have most of the stuff like turrets wing and engine on a dif save
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:31:35 Its how big the front turret is
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:32:10 I can either make the turret smaller or make the plane wider
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:32:54 Im also zoomed out
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:33:17 You can see my avatar by my curser
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:35:06 How is it powered
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:36:00 Might need to look at plane crazy b-17 for my b-24
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:36:13 Can i see it not spawned
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:36:19 For the wings
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:38:20 The b-24 is not as popular as the b-17
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:39:56 The stuff im going to have trouble with is the folding, bomb bay and the bombs themself
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:40:05 And landing gear
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:41:16 What glich i know of a few
plane-crazy 2020-10-02 19:42:41 I know of the ragdoll fly glich but not of that one

plane-crazy 2020-10-20 13:20:50 Ii couldnt use custom flaps because of the wing shape

plane-crazy 2020-10-20 13:27:58 wings are like that on the real plane
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 13:29:58 The most annyoing part of making the plane was whenever i motorlocked anything i had to make the top part of the plane on the motorlock
plane-crazy 2020-10-20 13:30:44 Its only 1 and a half block on each side wide
plane-crazy 2020-10-21 22:35:50 Has anyone made a ekranoplan

plane-crazy 2020-10-23 14:21:46 but im trying to make it go just above the water
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 14:22:19 most physics dont exist
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 14:22:59 it has working flaps that dont effect the plane at all
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 14:23:10 its still not done
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 14:23:52 it has like 20 super rocket engines to move because yes
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 14:24:29 well i want it going 1000 speed and going over the water in 1 sec
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 14:25:32 i dont want it doing this

plane-crazy 2020-11-05 15:01:54 The sr71 has its own metal made irl
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 15:03:12 A titanium alloy
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 15:03:29 Sr71 cost alot to use
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 15:04:04 It took alot lf fuel and high cost
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 15:04:56 Talking plane crazy it would take alot of motor locks to make a sc71
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 15:05:04 The shape is weird
plane-crazy 2020-11-05 15:06:10 I havent seen a good sr71 yet
