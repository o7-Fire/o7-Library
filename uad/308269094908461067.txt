bot-central 2019-11-05 20:40:27 &suggest some form of gear block, or the ability to make the water wheel be a part of an axle, so that way if it spins it could spin a wheel.

creations-chat 2019-11-27 22:32:42 More effort on conveyor powered vehicles, conveyors are amazing for trains.

creations-chat 2019-11-30 15:20:14 proof of movement
creations-chat 2019-11-30 15:20:37 i did the same thing with magnet drives, but now we have compact versions of this.
creations-chat 2019-11-30 15:30:51 By surrounding the middle conveyor with more conveyors you can have this not break on accident when building, i made a ball as a example.
