creations-chat 2020-07-02 11:39:11 The Challenge 2. Blocks = 1901. Suspension wheels. Pretty simple paintjob i kept it plain instead of camo because the real challenge 2 isnt a camo tank. This is my first time making a tank at this scale.

creations-chat 2020-07-05 08:23:37 guys update for my Megazord (The big mech from power rangers samurai): The kanji characters on the MegaZord are impossible to recreate. Should I do my best to try and recreate/write/paint the kanji characters or leave it blank?
general 2020-07-05 13:28:09 Does anybody know how to fold giant mechs that are 2X the size of the height limit? like the legs take go all the way to the height limit and then the torso will fold onto the legs? Please mention or dm me if you know. Im trying to build a megazord all by myself cause nobody wants to join me.

creations-chat 2020-07-15 08:15:02 <@!587459840255983616> You can use cylinders if u want (You can use ways to mesh the wheels together, eg. Pistons, fine meshing, locked motors) The advantages of using cylinders allows you to use gear ratios which you need for a realistic car mechanics. I actually tried to make a car that works like a car irl but failed
creations-chat 2020-07-15 08:17:44 just saying, cylinders are better than water wheels for gears cause cylinders vary in size while water wheels do not. You can implement gear ratios for a better working/ realistic car. Trust me, I'm an expert in gears and messed/experimented with gears in plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-07-15 08:19:12 but just do what you think will work better. Im just saying
creations-chat 2020-07-16 06:05:59 > <@!615810446724694018> if I use cylinders it doesn’t really catch easily, at first I had it use cylinders but friction slips and it didn’t allow me to shift easily because of the friction, so I tried using a gear using trails and wing panels but that didn’t have enough spokes, so I decided to use water wheels, then I realized u can’t hook blocks to them so I motorlocked a trail beam into it so they all move as one and to also hook it up to the rear wheels
<@!587459840255983616> fair enough
creations-chat 2020-07-16 06:06:13 i just wish they added actual gears in the game
creations-chat 2020-07-16 06:06:25 imagine the possibilities
creations-chat 2020-07-16 06:17:35 <@!587459840255983616> im just saying, using water wheels doesnt allow you to use gear ratios cause they don't vary in size
creations-chat 2020-07-16 06:17:46 they have a fixed number of teeth
creations-chat 2020-07-16 06:20:15 search up "gear ratios" and you'll see what trying to say
creations-chat 2020-07-16 06:21:12 one rotation of a 5X1 gear is = to 5 rotations of a I x I gear
creations-chat 2020-07-16 06:21:47 i think water wheels can only weld on the sides
creations-chat 2020-07-16 06:21:56 like cylinders

creations-chat 2020-08-06 10:18:11 I just made a working car transmission
creations-chat 2020-08-06 12:42:41 Are u kidding me
creations-chat 2020-08-06 12:42:52 My mp4 file is larger than 8mb
creations-chat 2020-08-06 12:54:39 I made a working car transmission. For all the ppl that don't know what it does, It basically controls the speed/torque of the engine.

Colour codes:
Red, Green, Blue = Engine Shaft, Counter Shaft, Drive Shaft
Yellow, Aqua, Brownish Orange = Gear 1, Gear 2, Gear 3.

Gear 1 and gear 2 work properly but If I this game and ACTUAL GEARS gear 3 would work as well (It doesnt work cause cylinders as gears are friction-based and gearing up produces less torque. Gear 1 has low speed but high torque, Gear 2 has medium speed and medium torque and gear 3 is supposed to be high speed less torque. Feel free to copy.

help 2020-09-02 22:56:37 > <@!615810446724694018> Oi thats because the thrust from the tail rotor is pushing your heli to the side. Research "translating Tendancy", you might need to cram in a magnet drive or super rocket sideways because plane crazy doesnt have airfoils yet :/
<@!133332036441079809> So do I tilt my top rotor to counter the drift

bug-reports 2020-09-02 23:00:49 <@!586086848833519617> Its most likely your swashplate. I used to have the same problem with my old swashplate, I couldn't pitch down and up and it would just tilt diagonally. If you can't design your own swashplate, just look for a compact one on youtube.

general 2020-09-03 03:57:26 in a real heli, the plates on a swashplate tilt, the motors on the bottom acts like the plates and tilts the control rods (Rope)
general 2020-09-03 03:57:52 this wouldnt be happening if you actually built it yourself
general 2020-09-03 03:57:56 and see what i mean
general 2020-09-03 03:58:23 and your complaining how plane crazy physics is the thing breaking your swashplate
general 2020-09-03 03:58:50 do you even know what gyroscopic precession is?

bug-reports 2020-09-05 04:57:32 Hover engines are so unstable
bug-reports 2020-09-05 04:58:14 When I try and use it on my helicopter swashplate
bug-reports 2020-09-05 04:58:18 the pitch gets broken

bug-reports 2020-09-05 04:58:34 Then I replaced the hover engines with super rocket engines
bug-reports 2020-09-05 04:58:41 and the pitch works again

bug-reports 2020-09-05 05:04:06 Blocks in my swashplate that are welded, unweld when the engines go too fast
bug-reports 2020-09-05 07:15:48 Ik the culprit
bug-reports 2020-09-05 07:16:28 Btw the motors werent the things unwelding, My prop was spinning too fast and I think lag made it look like it unwelded
bug-reports 2020-09-05 07:16:45 When I used hover engines, It just completely ignored Gyroscopic precession
bug-reports 2020-09-05 07:17:04 cause I was using hover engines to spin the blades since it provided more thrust
bug-reports 2020-09-05 07:18:14 > Hover engine placement is really important because they are hella powerful. Did you put them on your aerodynamic and center of mass on the dot, or offset?
<@!133332036441079809> I put the Hover engines on the tip of my rotor blades, When I use hover engines to spin my blades it completely ignored gyroscopic precession
bug-reports 2020-09-05 07:20:07 Gyroscopic precession applies to objects that spin, When a force is applied to the spinning object, the force is applied 90 degrees later. When I use hover engines to spin my blades, It completely ignores it and has no delay

creations-chat 2020-09-12 02:10:40 > <@!615810446724694018> dont use wheel blocks for the landing gear on your blackhawk, use cylinders on a motor
<@456226577798135808> Doesnt work
creations-chat 2020-09-12 02:10:47 Wheel blocks have better design
creations-chat 2020-09-12 02:10:54 I dont lie cylinders
creations-chat 2020-09-12 02:10:57 like*
creations-chat 2020-09-12 02:12:00 <@456226577798135808> Cylinders as wheel for my black hawk doesnt work I tried. I like the design of wheels. Cylinders and motors are bland. Wheels add more depth
creations-chat 2020-09-12 05:53:08 <@!719059654113755137> Your thing isn't a gyro. It is a pendulum. People these days keep messing up gyros and pendulums
creations-chat 2020-09-12 05:53:29 Gyros are meant to be spinning
creations-chat 2020-09-12 05:54:45 <@!437152336176087052> can you give me credit for helping you build your fully articulated system?

creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:37:06 <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:37:17 <@456226577798135808> That isn't a swashplate
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:38:21 I cannot see anyway for you to include cyclic pitching
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:38:51 that really isnt a swashplate
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:39:27 I think your mixing up swashplates and fake-lookalike swashplates
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:40:05 You don't even have control rods
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:40:13 and if those locked motors were control rods
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:40:47 I see no way to be able to make the blades rotate
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:40:53 to pitch and roll
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:43:24 <@456226577798135808> So don't go around fooling everyone about swashplates that don't even work
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:44:50 All your doing is rotating the whole rotor
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:44:55 not the individual blades
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:44:58 that isnt a swashpalte
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:45:07 He is claiming its a swashpalte
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:45:09 but it isnt
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:45:14 he is rotating the whole rotor
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:45:18 Swashplates dont
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:45:28 he doesnt even have control rods
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:45:53 its just collective pitching (The ability to control the lift)
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:46:13 he is just tilting the whole rotor not individual blades
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:48:33 <@456226577798135808> this is what a real swashplate should look like
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:50:12 <@456226577798135808> see how the blades can tilt individually to pitch and roll?
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:50:19 dont be fooled by a fake swashplate
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:50:56 a guy posted a fake swashplate
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:51:01 that isnt even realistic
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:51:10 all he is doing is tilting the whole rotor
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:51:59 cause this game needs resizable parts
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:52:03 to be able to fit
creations-chat 2020-09-12 11:52:06 blocks are too big
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:01:20 who else gets demotivated when their creation gets loads of downvotes
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:03:24 never thought of that
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:03:39 no wonder I see ppl that downvoted my build downvote like 5 others as well
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:04:02 lol
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:04:36 All i can see is you tilting the whole rotor
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:04:40 not individual blades
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:04:59 But I can see it can't tilt the blades
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:05:32 I can't see any possible way to individually tilt the blades
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:05:40 Even if you claim that it can
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:05:44 I dont see any way
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:05:59 If you used ropes as control rods I would believe it
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:06:17 Swashplates tilt the blades individually
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:06:19 not the whole rotor
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:06:44 Swashplates don't even tilt a single bit of the whole rotor
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:07:11 bruh do you even know what a swashplate is
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:07:24 They tilt the blades individually to pitch and roll
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:07:36 You are tilting the whole rotor
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:07:38 Bruh
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:07:43 You have no idea what your talking about
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:07:52 IK WHAT U JUST SAID
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:08:10 all your doing is tilting the blades to gain lift, not to roll and pitch
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:08:20 i saw your video....
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:08:27 "helicopter technician"
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:09:47 You litterly stated that you tilt the entire rotor
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:10:27 ok prove to me that the blades can tilt individually
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:10:30 to pitch and roll
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:11:33 Uhh <@!314383347214319616>
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:11:45 <@456226577798135808> read what he said please
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:12:05 I was telling robo rail to read what you said
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:13:29 "which angles each blade up at a somewhat random angle between 5-19degrees"
**Each blade** Just proves you dont tilt each blade individually
creations-chat 2020-09-12 12:18:07 lmao you actaully had the guts to downvote my build since we had an argument how your "swashplate" was fake

bot-central 2020-09-27 10:25:51 -mapsuggest Add bigger water areas. Such as lakes, rivers. Another unique suggest, **Add a dam** Make the dam pretty high and up in the mountains. Add a feature so that people can break the dam and every 10 min, the dam resets.
bot-central 2020-09-27 10:32:28 -mapsuggest If you are going to add new mountains and stuff that is tall,** Make them somewhat proportianate**. I don't like how a 7 block build is as tall as the plateau. Another suggestion, Add weather. **Some suggestions are, Fog, rain, storm, hurricane, tornado, tsunami, hail**. Each of these affects the vehicle in a specific way. Hail and tsunami can destroy vehicles and everything else displaces vehicles.
bot-central 2020-09-28 13:53:16 -mapsuggest I know this may sound a bit absurd, but I suggest make the map 10x bigger than the current one. Yes I know its absoloutly ridiculous. But this is the only way to get what everybody wants. A really commons suggestion is caves. A bigger map = bigger caves.

<@!582834773773254656> From my experience, soft coding is basically how organized your code is. If your code isn't organized, thigns can break easily

help 2020-10-22 03:43:58 <@!323120963015147521> its spinning because you either have 1 rotor and dont have a tail rotor
creations-chat 2020-10-22 12:17:09 its either on inverted or the center of mass. Cause the center of mass basically dictates mouse control.
creations-chat 2020-10-22 12:18:37 oh that normally happens. It isn't a bug its probably the location of your mouse and camera right before you spawn. Cause I had a mouse controlled turret before and I had to face directly forward and my mouse in the center so it doesnt invert

help 2020-11-09 20:59:58 > <@!526713899958140928> that's called dissymmetry of lift from what I see, it's basically wind wanna do funny with the rotor spinning in one way, so now it kinda tilts the helicopter, one way to fix it is by ~~swashplate~~ having more control over your helicopter or by fine-tuning the weight, this effect also applies to the tail rotor, so putting it on the other side might help, otherwise add delta wing in the direction the rotor is spinning
<@!437152336176087052> You can also fix it by using a fully articulated rotor system. That is what the flapping hinges are for
help 2020-11-09 21:01:11 Putting the tail rotor on the other side wont really do anything tho
help 2020-11-09 21:01:19 cause its mainly caused by the main rotor

help 2020-11-09 21:03:46 when your heli is moving forward
help 2020-11-09 21:03:58 since won blade is producing upward and the other downard

plane-crazy 2020-12-03 09:48:11 its your rotor placement
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 09:48:20 It has to be on center of mass
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 09:48:22 if it isnt
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 09:48:35 it will pitch forward or backwards when going up
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 09:48:48 either move your rotor
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 09:48:57 or manipulate the center of mass
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 09:52:49 If it is on the center of mass
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 09:52:54 but it is still pitching
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 09:52:59 you have to fine tune it
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 09:53:04 meaning ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 09:53:12 and change the density so it hovers
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 09:53:24 is it perfect tho
plane-crazy 2020-12-03 09:53:34 It has the be bang smack in the middle of the rotor

creations-chat 2021-01-01 13:10:31 <@!712273624865701921>Something perfectly balanced doesnt mean its perfectly stable. Attach that to a heli fuselage it wont be stable anymore.
creations-chat 2021-01-01 13:15:22 <@!712273624865701921> If you want the most stable heli rotor you need to take in accounts like dissymmetry of lift, translating tendency, coriolis effect, etc. You need a fully articulated rotor system to make a perfectly stable rotor. All you have is a perfectly balanced one.

creations-chat 2021-01-04 14:44:24 It sounds like your real account which is ayomkin is an unde and you made a new account just so u can join this server
creations-chat 2021-01-04 14:47:43 And I’m right. This account is made in 11/16/20.

creations-chat 2021-01-04 14:50:01 Would you look at that. The same day your roblox account was made is the same day you joined this server
creations-chat 2021-01-04 14:57:02 I dm him with the proof. He has 2 accounts. His main account which is Ayomkn is an unde and he made his new one just to bypass the system. Perform a whois and search his discord username on roblox. You will find that he made his account on the same day he join pcc
creations-chat 2021-01-04 15:00:39 This sounds like a case of trying to bypass the verifying system but getting caught and using bad excuses to coverup yourself

general 2021-01-19 11:54:50 having high iq is a burden
general 2021-01-19 11:55:51 iq is just a measure of problem solving skills and how fast your brain works
general 2021-01-19 11:56:19 you see all those high iq people stutter cause their brains are working too fast
general 2021-01-19 11:57:42 something like playing chess every day or puzzles will increase your iq. Immense stress will decrease it
general 2021-01-19 11:59:12 I mean from personal experience I stutter from time to time but it depend on the situation
general 2021-01-19 12:00:18 I dont stutter l-l-l-lik-like that. I stutter l-like this
general 2021-01-19 12:01:04 do u have high iq or no?
general 2021-01-19 12:01:54 I took 3 official tests and all results were basically the same.
general 2021-01-19 12:02:40 holy crap man. He was my childhood. I watched his epic proportions series and crafting dead 5 years ago

general 2021-01-19 12:03:08 he gets around 500k a vid
general 2021-01-19 12:04:48 people with high iq tend to have a lower eq

general 2021-01-31 12:12:31 do any of you get really annoyed, dissapointed and bummed out when you super amazing dream about your crush in highschool and then you wake up realising it was just a dream
general 2021-01-31 12:13:54 lets just say, im super disappointed right now
general 2021-01-31 12:14:49 when you finally break that shell but then you wake up to reality
general 2021-01-31 12:15:32 when your crush finally likes you but then your alarm goes off

general 2021-01-31 12:16:53 those moments feel good and bad at the same time
general 2021-01-31 12:17:36 it feels bad realising how bad reality is
general 2021-01-31 12:18:59 those kind of dreams gives you determination but lowers your self esteem at the same time
general 2021-01-31 12:20:27 when a dream is that significant you will remember it

general 2021-04-06 04:00:12 slowmode is back
general 2021-04-06 04:00:31 the game's way of dealing with lag

help 2021-04-06 12:30:11 yes
help 2021-04-06 12:30:15 but remove the speed
help 2021-04-06 12:30:28 and set max angle to 15
help 2021-04-06 12:30:30 or 10
help 2021-04-06 12:30:49 set it as close you can to the middle

help 2021-04-06 12:38:17 can u send vid?
help 2021-04-06 12:38:28 also if it doesnt go up add less angle
help 2021-04-06 12:38:34 or helium
help 2021-04-06 12:38:55 stable small heli's are a pain to build
