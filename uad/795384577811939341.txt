general 2022-07-19 03:58:46 So I went to bed last night listening to music of yt and I get up and btw is on what I was listening to last night I have never liked btw nor will I ever listen to it
the-dump 2022-07-19 03:59:34 I belong here
general 2022-07-19 04:01:38 I don’t even know
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 06:15:44 What did the update even do??
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 06:18:28 Damn good thing I saved a ship I have been working on since June
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 06:18:49 Nah
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 06:19:18 Plane crazy is the only reason I’m still on Roblox in the first place
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 06:21:22 I just need pc2 to come out already I need those big boi plots my ships are getting bigger and bigger and I’m losing space
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 06:22:14 I’m pushing 120 block long ships I need the space <@217336009455566848>
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 06:27:54 I’m building the uss Alaska and she’s limited to 112 blocks long and I can’t even build the super structure so I request the plots to be at least maybe three times the size they are now
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 06:28:00 <@217336009455566848>
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 06:32:34 Ight but still these 32 by 32 block plots are limiting my ships
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 06:33:12 Wait 50
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 06:33:46 The Alaska is longer than I thought it’s four and a half plots long
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 06:35:04 I just can’t build anything above the turrets because it’s 11 blocks tall
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 06:35:45 The difference is I need hull under the water to even be balanced
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 06:36:21 And I don’t feel like building with helium
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 08:15:37 Hey rickje how big are the plots going to be in pc2?
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 08:17:38 Eh still worth asking
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 08:21:18 Oof
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 08:28:15 I believe that very problem is what rickje is fixing at this very moment
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 08:28:49 Could be wrong but I believe that’s what it is
plane-crazy 2023-07-21 08:47:03 I just re measured my ship she’s 221 blocks long 23 blocks wide and 11 blocks tall from the bottom most point to the deck
