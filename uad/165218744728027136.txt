creations-chat 2019-05-12 02:33:24 Made a mouse controlled turret. I can't get turning left/right yet, but I got up/down working: https://gyazo.com/f1b08836529e94bd711cafb8dbdecd1a
creations-chat 2019-05-12 02:34:51 have mouse controlled turrets been done before?
creations-chat 2019-05-12 02:36:07 i'm not even really sure.
creations-chat 2019-05-12 02:36:20 used control surfaces + unpowered motors + suspension/springs
creations-chat 2019-05-12 02:40:31 Mouse vertical control: MP4 version to see how it works
creations-chat 2019-05-12 02:42:10 it's not
creations-chat 2019-05-12 02:42:19 try it yourself
creations-chat 2019-05-12 02:42:32 only settings you need are an unpowered motor & springs with lengths 5.6
creations-chat 2019-05-12 02:42:47 super limited range
creations-chat 2019-05-12 02:44:47 it doesn't work without them for some reason
creations-chat 2019-05-12 02:44:50 just flops
creations-chat 2019-05-12 02:47:14 The rockets restricts movement a lot because of the mass.
creations-chat 2019-05-12 02:47:27 it goes at least 15% higher without it
creations-chat 2019-05-12 02:52:17 mhm
creations-chat 2019-05-12 02:52:22 the only objects that move with your mouse
creations-chat 2019-05-12 02:55:46 
creations-chat 2019-05-12 02:58:35 not even sure how it works yet
creations-chat 2019-05-12 02:59:45 just popped into my mind and somehow it worked
creations-chat 2019-05-12 03:00:14 i originally thought to use suspension to pop it back in place before I realized i didn't need it, turned out to be crucial.
creations-chat 2019-05-12 03:00:39 works better when used with keybinds, but the whole point is mouse (for some reason keybinds move the control surface all the way but the mouse doesn't?)
creations-chat 2019-05-12 03:01:36 basically, the white part of the control surface welds to the motor & block I think, then the other part pushes the suspension which push against it, causing it to rotate.
bug-reports 2019-05-12 03:12:13 Possible bug:
Control surfaces don't rotate to their maximum with mouse control.

Keybinds (Left) vs. Mouse Control (right):

creations-chat 2019-05-12 03:32:31 Mix of the F-35 and F-22. Reminds me of a megalodon.
creations-chat 2019-05-12 03:35:39 Lol it's prety fat.
creations-chat 2019-05-12 03:35:45 Looks better from behind.
