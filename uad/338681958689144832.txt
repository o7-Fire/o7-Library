plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:04:52 i need help
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:05:00 
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:05:12 when i disconnect the side boosters, one falls way faster than the other
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:05:17 they are both the same
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:05:28 they both have 10 density ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:05:39 and one of the boosters landing legs work
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:05:44 unpower what
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:05:56 no
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:06:01 im going for reusability
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:06:03 i mean
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:06:11 one booster falls faster than the other
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:06:33 they are both the same, one of the boosters legs dont go out, and the one that falls fasters, does work
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:06:45 ok
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:06:50 how can i fix my landing legs?
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:06:55 ill take an image
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:07:08 
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:07:16 
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:07:24 
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:07:33 this is the booster that doesnt let its landing legs go out
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 05:58:57 fixed the falcon heavy
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:29:59 falcon heavy
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:30:01 
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:32:13 -- has staging, side boosters land, same with core stage. Core stage has working grid fins. Upper stage has detachable fairings. Upper stage also has a satellite in it with detachable "mini satellites" after payload release
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:32:22 needless to say
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:32:24 its very yummy
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:34:00 
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:34:30 -- you can also set how far apart you want the boosters to be apart on landing
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:37:53 oh no
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:37:56 its not 3 boosters at once
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:38:54 the staging is liftoff - booster cuttoff, separation - landing of boosters - core stage cutoff and separation - landing - fairing separation - payload separation - deployment of satellite
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:39:31 so its really 2 at the same time for the first landing
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:39:33 and 1 for the second
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:39:45 and the 2 boosters are identical and have the same controls \
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:39:49 so they move in the same direction
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:40:01 but you can choose how far spaced from eachother
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:40:06 with keypad 8
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:41:15 wedges are probably colliding with the wheel and glitching into it
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:41:23 making it spaz out
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:41:35 which would probably derail it
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:41:40 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:41:45 it can spaz out and go anywhere
plane-crazy 2021-01-11 20:42:12 thats a bruh moment
