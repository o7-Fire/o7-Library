general 2023-04-22 23:52:12 dude, i saw the same dude who builded a "pija" picture in a different server
bug-reports 2023-04-23 00:00:15 i dont know if this is a bug or a exploit, but i saw a guy loading a build what was a wall of hover engines, after that, the wall turned into a few pixels that when finished loaded became a real 🍌 / 🍆 picture, i have the user of the guy who did it (probabbly was an alt) and the picture of what he made
bug-reports 2023-04-23 00:01:43 i think what if it is a exploit the hover engines are used for load the pixels or smth, because the same dude haves another pixelarts what doesnt have hover engines
