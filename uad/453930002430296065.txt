plane-crazy 2021-06-04 04:35:25 cant find fireworks anywhere in the build menu. where it be?
help 2021-06-04 05:08:55 hey everyone, the jet i built seems to really like to wobble when coming out of turns, sometimes uncontrollably just going straight too. ive googled around and apparently helium is a good fix? i put it in the nose but it doesn't seem to do much. Gosjo64 on youtube also says put control pads in the nose, also doesn't seem to help that much. any suggestions?

plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:45:54 seems pretty cool but idk what im doing
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:46:23 basically if you lock a motor it compresses itself into half a block
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:46:46 and if you spam them in a certain way you can squish numurous blocks into 1
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:46:53 so like
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:46:57 explosion blocks
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:47:10 you can stuff like 10 explosion blocks in 1 block using motorlocking
plane-crazy 2021-06-08 02:47:56 thats a lot of upvotes
creations-chat 2021-06-08 03:34:01 i upvoted but i think the proportions are just too off for some people, the wing is too large for such a tiny body
