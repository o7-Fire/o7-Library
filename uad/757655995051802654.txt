plane-crazy 2021-11-03 14:42:44 Anyone know how to put more speed on my piston engine car?
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 14:43:18 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 14:45:34 But the motors are unpowered
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 14:46:12 only 3 motors are locked and the rest are unpowered
plane-crazy 2021-11-03 14:46:57 That defeats the purpose of it
creations-chat 2021-11-03 23:39:51 I understand that, I could not hide the exposed motorlock
creations-chat 2021-11-04 15:08:22 I did not try to copy i was inspired so i made mines, theres a diffrence from copying and being inspired
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 21:07:57 aparrently i was in a server with the inventor of the shredder bug
