help 2020-03-15 23:05:15 I want to get a different way of turning while using similar suspension.
help 2020-03-15 23:05:56 Right now it turns the whole suspension system, but I only want to turn the wheels. I have tried but quite frankly I suck at it
help 2020-03-15 23:06:37 I have seen people do it before
help 2020-03-15 23:07:02 uhhh time to search on youtube
help 2020-03-15 23:08:12 <@!486276884611465256> Do you know any tutorials or anything I can use to help?
help 2020-03-15 23:10:42 I only do for specific things like suspension systems
help 2020-03-15 23:11:10 Considering that I new to the game, I consider myself a decent builder

help 2020-03-17 00:21:40 Hey, I wanted to get into building sport, super, and muscle cars, but I need some help with either proportions or suspension, maybe both if you can! Feel free to ping me and add me in game so you could maybe show me how to do some things
creations-chat 2020-03-18 03:25:36 The front of this thing is a disappointment, but it's also my first truck.
creations-chat 2020-03-18 03:26:05 It does bump though, it's a real redneck truck
creations-chat 2020-03-18 03:26:23 And the back is absolutely accurate
creations-chat 2020-03-18 17:56:38 Much better improvement XD
help 2020-03-18 18:10:48 What rank would I request if I build cars and trucks and stuff?
help 2020-03-18 18:16:05 Oh yeah I forgot I can't read
help 2020-03-18 18:16:09 Don't mind me being sped
help 2020-03-18 18:19:06 no, I mean special education
help 2020-03-18 18:19:56 I am an idiot
help 2020-03-18 18:20:01 That's what I'm saying
help 2020-03-18 18:39:30 Any recommendations for what I should do for the front? It's obviously no where near done but I want to see what I should do to improve the looks. In case you can't tell, it's based on a 1990 Dodge Ram.
