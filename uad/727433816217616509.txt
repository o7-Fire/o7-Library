the-dump 2021-07-08 21:36:12 That was irony
the-dump 2021-07-08 21:37:03 Now its starting to sound like you are just salty that you keep dying in that game and blaming hitnoxes

help 2021-07-08 23:47:41 That ship is quite long and tall compared to its width, maybe you should try widening the hull or filling the underwater part with solid blocks so the center of mass will be lower but buoyancy the same
help 2021-07-08 23:50:20 Maybe with motor 2 set to servo?

creations-chat 2021-07-10 23:27:16 Its not critical buoyancy, it handles well and is not tilted its also very stable during turns also this slowmode sucks
creations-chat 2021-07-10 23:30:11 Its a luxury ocean liner thats meant to be slow no helium needed as i always preffer realism
creations-chat 2021-07-10 23:32:55 It has interior and still i wont add any unrealistic aspects to my builds also it not that close ti the water its actually higher than i expected
Edit: bridge is not for passengers and does not need ti be that pretty

help 2022-08-31 23:26:04 Thats not true but alright
help 2022-08-31 23:26:19 Still wood in 2020
help 2022-08-31 23:27:01 Only the lights and color changed
help 2022-08-31 23:27:40 It was either toi tall or too low
help 2022-08-31 23:28:02 And if i did this i could add panelling to the roof
help 2022-08-31 23:28:18 Those are half blocks
help 2022-08-31 23:28:30 Just where the lights are its a block shorter
help 2022-08-31 23:29:04 The short furnishing with the tall roof looked weird
help 2022-08-31 23:29:26 It looked empty
help 2022-08-31 23:29:56 So i added a dark wood panelling to the roof to make it look more cozy and add some texture
help 2022-08-31 23:30:33 It looks better in larger spaces though
help 2022-08-31 23:31:16 Then it will be the same color as the floor
help 2022-08-31 23:31:24 I am not on currently

plane-crazy 2022-09-02 11:09:14 normal amount of blocks
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 11:10:00 i may hit 30k on it once finished
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 11:20:30 possibly the largest ocean liner in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 11:21:10 *mainly becouse noone builds them or knows what they are*
creations-chat 2022-09-02 11:44:13 PCC demo version
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:07:05 people would need a lot of dedication to copy my ship
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:07:14 considering its size
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:07:52 well my ship is aproaching 27k blocks
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:08:18 the block count or the ship itself
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:08:28 alright time to lag the server im in
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:08:55 i have but older pictures
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:09:22 i have mostly interior pics
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:10:41 
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:10:57 its a custom built liner
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:11:12 slitghtly based on Georgic and Britannic III
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:12:04 ah
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:12:33 heres a pic of the smoking room and the swimming pool
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:12:51 the swimming pool still has some issues
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:13:28 i will when i overhaul it
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:14:12 heres a pic of the pool when empty
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:14:38 yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:16:18 i will
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:18:22 my ship has very slight similarities to Britannic III and thats only exterior, interior is fully custom
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:19:11 i am trying my best on it and so far im happy with it
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:21:17 a guy is flexing on me his Britannic, its also a tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:22:42 
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:22:49 im the one on the left
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:23:29 4 folds sideways
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:24:33 i have my own Britannic
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:24:39 around 26,6k
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:25:44 i told him
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:25:57 im an amatuer historian on Britannic and Titanic
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:26:04 he had so many innacuracies
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:26:51 he made a model of a real ship
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:27:13 
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:28:05 the thing is, the colors were wrong, shape was wrong, detailing was wrong, davits were wrong, 99% of the ship was wrong
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:30:49 a model should be accurate, an inspired custom build does not need to be
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:31:17 yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:31:35 that goes under the second thing
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:31:47 well downvotes are not good
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:31:59 redcord
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:32:05 disdit
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:32:54 have a creation with 90+ upvotes
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:33:08 some call them likes
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:33:12 kinda
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:33:25 i mean someone got about 130 votes with a small tent
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:34:00 my first build was horribly downvoted here
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:34:07 and i improved a lot
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:34:52 i spent the last month on my ship, and its still not finished
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:35:21 cause i like ocean liners
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:35:36 and this one is possibly the largest in the entire plane crazy community
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:36:17 there are expert roles for all types of vehicles
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:37:40 good luck lol
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:38:00 expert supreme is doable
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:38:06 but master?
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:40:36 I-153-M62
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:41:02 i have the zhukovsky version
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 12:41:33 on the plane crazy subreddit anything gets upvotes except for shredders
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 13:41:27 random letters after an emoji may make it not tag and if you play with the text scale it can only show the emoji
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:07:50 seeing others builds can make you inspired to improve your build
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:08:12 it gives motivation
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:09:06 i have recently saw a few peoples ships and it gave me motivation to rework all interior on my ship
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:09:31 copying is almost impossible if you are making ships
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:09:50 innovation inc
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:11:04 or have good ideas but not great skills
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:11:52 also spite is the best motivator
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:12:21 yes
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:13:52 its different seeing pictures of a build and seeing one ingame
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:14:29 my friend made one
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:14:38 but i dont have a pic
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:15:29 only about half of the people on this server are active
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:17:19 the anime pfp doesnt help either
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:19:44 and then shredder users
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:20:00 dont insult apes like that
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:22:14 was there even a creation that had balanced like dislike ratio?
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:22:45 most of the time its either disliked down to heck or liked
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:27:50 for example 50 likes 50 downvotes
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:30:30 rickje cleans his spaghetti
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:31:09 they said it was gonna be released this summer
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:31:13 but as expected
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:31:18 didnt happen
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:31:57 im hopefull for this winter
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:32:44 he doesnt want hype to build up
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:33:15 doubt
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:33:40 shredders wont work in pc2
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:34:15 but atleast in pc2 it can be fixed due to the softcode
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:34:29 rickje said cutters work differently
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:35:28 the retexture looks like a large saw
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:36:31 clean spaghetti = good spaghetti
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:38:12 different materials different strenght, weight and buoyancy
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:38:51 conveyor can work as a cheap track
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:43:14 the scale tool will help
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:49:28 meanwhile my ship having no space on for exterior
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:51:11 a block isnt a meter
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:51:37 1 block is 2,5 studs, each stud is 28cm so each block is 70cm
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:52:27 and yes roblox avatars are 1,4 meters tall
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:54:00 Maximum space efficiency
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:54:35 when i was saying i dont have exterior space i meant it
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:55:18 my ship is 200 blocks long, 19 blocks wide and 28,5 blocks tall
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 14:55:40 a larger ship is impossible on a single plot if you want interior
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:03:09 infinite blocks
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:04:01 wait so only normal blocks run out?
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:04:15 also metal is more reflective and has a texture
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:04:22 and weights more
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:05:02 i recently got a new pc
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:05:07 so i always have 10
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:05:36 my old pc could run an empty server at 1 graphics at around 25 fps
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:06:02 also
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:06:13 at 7+ graphics water stops redering trough glass
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:06:18 its odd
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:06:54 they put everything together
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:07:12 why isnt there something like optifine but for roblox
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:07:41 shaders arent
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:08:08 although to optimize roblox you would basically need to change the spaghetti code they made
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:09:26 unless you dont grind
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:09:50 war thunder itself is bad
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:10:04 i played it for 2 years
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:10:14 just the economy and updates are bad
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:10:36 try playing sweden top tier and make money
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:10:48 or france
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:11:20 i have only played bombers when i wanted to get PE-8
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:11:35 then rain down hell in ground battles
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:11:56 i wasnt getting shot down a lot though
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:12:14 rb
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:13:39 i dont know how much meters that is but at around the altitude i spawn at
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:14:05 20k feet is 40k meters?
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:14:08 what
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:14:10 you serious?
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:14:22 a feet is 0,33 meters
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:14:25 around
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:14:52 no
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:15:02 1 meter is almost 3 feet
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:15:23 for example Titanic is 883 feet long but 269 meters long
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:16:20 no
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:16:25 around the height at which i spawn
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:16:31 like 2-5km
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:18:43 with bombers i usually went for bases that were as far from the enemy spawn as possible
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:19:31 first 3 battles for a player are mostly with bots
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:19:36 then the real players come in
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:23:28 war thunder is better than some other pvp games
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:23:38 becouse you can make a mistake and the armor can save you
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:23:42 for tanks at least
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:24:18 in one bomber i lost all my back wings and made it to the airfield
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:24:41 the tail was there but no wings
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:25:03 i just had the rudder and front wings
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:25:22 probably
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:25:55 just had to balance my throttle to either go up or down
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:26:48 also this this is quite off topic on this channel
plane-crazy 2022-09-02 15:27:07 i dont know
general 2022-09-02 15:35:44 if you all ping him they wont stop all of you
general 2022-09-02 15:36:29 i dont think he responds to pings anyway
general 2022-09-02 15:37:08 netherlands arent that big
general 2022-09-02 15:47:00 someone already did
general 2022-09-02 15:48:02 its been so long...
general 2022-09-02 15:51:40 he has been on for quite some time
general 2022-09-02 15:53:07 most of the leaks werent in announcements
general 2022-09-02 15:54:14 calm the masses
general 2022-09-02 15:54:36 anything probably
general 2022-09-02 15:54:56 i taste some trolling
general 2022-09-02 15:55:55 first mention of the pc2 alpha was in march, then in summer, and not even that
general 2022-09-02 15:56:07 blessing of the lords
general 2022-09-02 15:56:52 what if rick is reading all this but just not saying anything
general 2022-09-02 15:57:26 yes
general 2022-09-02 15:58:19 i was just renovating interior on my ship when this chat caught my attention
general 2022-09-02 15:59:32 they said they will ask, there may not be an answer
general 2022-09-02 16:01:41 the basic elements of rick land
general 2022-09-02 16:02:24 we dont know if the scale tool will work to that degree of detail
general 2022-09-02 16:02:46 exactly
general 2022-09-02 16:03:11 seeing the disperse of misinformation, yea we have a lack of information
general 2022-09-02 16:06:13 noone posting creations becouse they want spoilers for pc2
general 2022-09-02 16:07:16 the clock is ticking and still no leak
general 2022-09-02 16:08:18 then be like napoleon
general 2022-09-02 16:10:08 he was kinda mad already
general 2022-09-02 16:10:43 yes
general 2022-09-02 16:11:14 a fake leak is worse than no leak
general 2022-09-02 16:12:12 storm the netherlands and search for rick
general 2022-09-02 16:12:21 its not that large of a country
general 2022-09-02 16:12:42 he said he is dutch
general 2022-09-02 16:13:56 its like the moment before Titanic struck the iceberg, just calm and waiting for a leak
general 2022-09-02 16:14:15 the leak was an unexpected pun
general 2022-09-02 16:14:55 and he said alpha may be released in march
general 2022-09-02 16:15:37 22-28th september is technically when it ends
general 2022-09-02 16:16:21 august 32st?
general 2022-09-02 16:16:46 february 30th
general 2022-09-02 16:18:10 when im looking for leaks i almost never go to development but just search rickje and search trough what he said
general 2022-09-02 16:19:01 so rick was pinged 3 times, mods 2 times and still nothing
general 2022-09-02 16:21:15 probably wont happen
general 2022-09-02 16:23:43 a christmas gift
general 2022-09-02 16:24:22 you mean pc2?
general 2022-09-02 16:25:58 PCC can either be very nice or absolutly ape-ish
general 2022-09-02 16:31:20 what
general 2022-09-02 16:39:30 has the crowd calmed?
general 2022-09-02 16:40:36 there is enough people in this server
general 2022-09-02 16:42:06 only if third of the entire server reacted
general 2022-09-02 16:48:41 yea if rick said who the developers were they would likely get a lot of dms and not all good
creations-chat 2022-09-02 19:54:25 Great Britain was the first propeller driven ocean liner with a steel hull
creations-chat 2022-09-02 19:59:02 you mean antifouling?
creations-chat 2022-09-02 20:01:43 draught is the height from the waterline to the keel, which is painted with *antifouling*
creations-chat 2022-09-02 20:04:05 everyone was a whitename at some point
creations-chat 2022-09-03 13:10:57 Or you can just design a ship to be stable without those things
creations-chat 2022-09-03 14:47:33 almost every ship today is bigger than Titanic, Titanic was only *slightly* larger than Olympic, and less than a year after Titanic it was no longer the largest ship in the world
general 2022-09-03 14:52:26 leak
general 2022-09-03 14:52:28 tunnel
general 2022-09-03 14:53:12 that will be very usefull for me and my ships
general 2022-09-03 14:53:38 cant you check development?
general 2022-09-03 14:55:57 so being loud and annoying caused a leak for pc2
general 2022-09-03 14:57:45 you can riot in every channel until a slowmode is everywhere
general 2022-09-03 14:58:50 take your time to develop pc2 so it wont be bad
general 2022-09-03 14:59:48 starting a riot when rickje is here is not a good idea
general 2022-09-03 15:03:42 why cant people check development
general 2022-09-03 15:03:49 and have to ask here
help 2022-09-13 20:58:39 <@628043186379685889> you did some wrong math in your suggestion, the speed of sound in sps is 1225, not 800 or 900, each stud is 28cm and the speed of sound is 343m/s, so 343/0,28 is 1225
creations-chat 2022-09-21 19:52:27 Suggestion blacklist and whitename arguing who has a lower IQ lol

Edit: your name is white, you dont have roles, thats called a white name
creations-chat 2022-09-21 19:55:20 What color is your name?

Mxrkava trying to be sneaky and changes name color to white
creations-chat 2022-09-21 20:02:04 Changing it back to blue doesnt increase your inteligence

Logic and common sense begs to differ ↓
creations-chat 2022-09-21 20:11:24 Agreed
creations-chat 2022-09-23 11:48:46 <@539807584622739471> why does your shader have the option for a dirty screen
creations-chat 2022-09-23 11:54:24 Its better to not have shaders then

creations-chat 2022-10-12 12:57:36 so like a grate
creations-chat 2022-10-12 12:59:40 they still work, just have a bug
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 05:19:30 He can but the code is so old that many things could break
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 05:19:52 Its kinda the entire point of plane crazy 2
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 05:19:57 Softcoding the game
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 05:20:49 I just cant wait for the optimalization
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 05:21:05 So I can load my 29k block ship without lagging others
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 06:04:56 
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 06:59:34 Big is my desire
plane-crazy 2022-10-14 06:59:58 Infact its the largest single plot ocean liner with full interior
plane-crazy 2022-10-22 11:30:44 The newest is from september 3rd, less than 2 months ago
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 19:52:07 They underestimated my ship and its lights
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 20:13:41 big
plane-crazy 2022-10-24 20:18:07 build tutorials are quite lame
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 11:52:07 closer and closer to 30k
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 11:52:33 yes
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 11:52:43 what other creation has a stern
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 11:52:46 Ocean liner
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 11:53:02 planes have a tail
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:04:49 all of those can be classified as ships
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:05:51 well a space ship doesnt need any lift
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:06:29 thats still not a plane
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:06:51 most planes cannot float in one spot
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:07:57 specialized jet planes that can VTOL
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:08:34 and most planes cannot create thrust without air
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:09:17 becouse planes are built to fly in an atmosphere
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:09:22 space ships are for space
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:10:23 space ships do have engines
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:10:30 most of the time rocket engines
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:11:25 they pivot the engine nozzle
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:11:42 or have additional engines on the side or front
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:12:43 space ships in star wars cannot just go backwards
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:13:39 turn off the engines and use the braking engines
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:14:07 ah yes aerobrake in space
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:14:30 but lot less powerfull
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:15:19 did you even read what we are talking about,
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:15:45 that they have engines to slow down
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:17:54 build
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:17:56 share
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:17:58 profit
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:19:03 hating on new people is kind of bad becouse its killing the game
plane-crazy 2022-10-28 12:19:48 well yes but people are accelerating it
plane-crazy 2022-11-02 13:41:18 Unless you cant hit it
plane-crazy 2022-11-02 13:42:03 Also the trajectory and size of the target is important
plane-crazy 2022-11-02 13:42:41 If someone is constantly changing directions at 1000sps and 1000 studs away it will be difficult to hit
plane-crazy 2022-11-02 13:43:42 Wdym not working
plane-crazy 2022-11-02 13:43:54 Did you build it correctly?
bug-reports 2022-11-11 11:51:12 
bug-reports 2022-11-11 11:51:33 dont know what happened but part of my ship is invisible unless I have the delete tool

bug-reports 2022-11-11 16:59:16 I hope for plane crazy 2, it might be looking grim, but I still have hope
help 2022-11-12 20:46:32 It looks like it has no shape, add some more details to it, like anchor, railing, antifouling, depthmarks and stuff like that
help 2022-11-12 21:48:06 Thats most of the community when you ask them why they downvoted you
bug-reports 2022-11-12 22:02:22 Having many builds as a ship builder does that
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 13:29:52 Oceans will be infinite, land will be larger
creations-chat 2022-11-13 15:54:10 what do you mean hull out of a ship?
creations-chat 2022-11-13 16:14:26 you can prevent the censoring if you put some spaces or other stuff on the text
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 17:13:45 crossed over 30k on my ship
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 17:30:17 it is in its final stages
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 17:30:51 very little has to be done to finish her
bug-reports 2022-11-16 05:49:50 Thats a weird feature that is supposed to apparently reduce lag by turning off lights, however its just annoying
help 2022-11-18 16:02:21 Deeper draught, use half blocks for top floors, add ballast
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 06:15:51 By designing the ship to not be top heavy, so a heavy keel and half block decks above the waterline
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 06:17:45 No they arent, there are exception but mostly they arent
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 06:18:06 Cruise ships are very light
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 06:18:19 And have thin hull and superstructure
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 06:19:32 Ocean liners like the Queen Mary and Imperator had mistakes in the design and were slightly top heavy so they were prone to rolling
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 06:19:55 In fact there isnt a single photo of Imperator on even keel
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:54:08 Well they are twice as light as a normal block
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:54:34 I use metal material on my entire ship
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:54:42 No ballast and little helium
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:55:30 If my ship were to capsize everyone in the server would feel it
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:56:03 
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:56:21 Heres a pic of my newest one
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 07:56:56

plane-crazy 2022-11-21 08:00:15 Im currently in school so I cannot show you
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 08:00:59 Anyway my break is ending so bye for now
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 09:19:55 On my ship I couldnt use motor lock folding even if I wanted to
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 09:21:01 I dont use motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 09:21:12 Seems useless for my builds
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 09:22:00 I dont know how to explain it trough text
plane-crazy 2022-11-21 09:22:12 There are videos of it though
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 15:41:31 I managed to break plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 15:42:04 Noone can build, noone can do interact with anything and everything is frozen
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 15:42:28 I launched my ship in pvp
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 15:42:35 And someone bombed it
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 15:42:51 Technically yes
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 15:43:10 No
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 15:43:14 I only make ships
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 15:46:33 People lost hope in rick making pc2
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 15:46:43 So they say its cancelled
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 15:47:56 Ah thatgame
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 15:48:07 It feels like pc2 from wish.com
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 15:49:04 Vehicle something something
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 15:49:17 If i even remember
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 15:52:15 Thats a good game
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 15:52:38 There is multiplayer
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 15:53:00 Technically yes
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 15:53:16 It isnt like roblox
plane-crazy 2022-11-26 15:53:59 Wanted to say something but forgor what

creations-chat 2023-01-09 17:48:39 1:1 Britannic, thats kinda all my plans
creations-chat 2023-01-12 14:09:39 Love how they sometimes have such a spike that they go backwards
bug-reports 2023-01-12 14:49:39 a set of numbers that could change your life is you share them
bug-reports 2023-01-12 20:15:05 thats why I said *could*
plane-crazy 2023-02-04 17:33:01 "working on the issues" just like the last 100 times
plane-crazy 2023-02-04 17:33:59 its 4.2.
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 13:46:01 Great Eastern had brown/black funnels, not red
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 13:46:50 Also welcome to the club, every relatively large ship will be called Titanic
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 13:47:04 Doesnt matter how it looks
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 13:47:26 Can I crash that server with my ship?
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 13:48:22 This was it a month ago
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 13:48:30 Olympic
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 13:49:04 Or a way bigger ship depending on which one you mean
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 13:49:28 2
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 13:51:34 Its about 30100~ blocks
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 13:52:36 Well I tried to make it the largest Ocean liner with full interior, and I believe I have done it
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 13:52:43 Normandie
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 13:53:24 I know
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 13:54:40 I had a great eastern, but it wasnt detailed so I called it average eastern
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 13:54:54 I also used 4 folds
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 13:55:01 But *sideways*
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 13:56:15 
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 13:57:06 Mine is 19 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 13:58:21 This is my current ship in build mode
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 13:59:48 Building interior sideways can be confusing
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 14:03:24 Couldnt find a recent one without shaders
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 14:04:14 In fact it can be a skill issue, if someone has no idea how to build ships then likely they wont be stable
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 14:05:42 Learn about buoyancy, center of weight, draft, or just slap ballast and helium on
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 14:06:04 Thats kinda becouse of the angle
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 14:07:39 Here is a better one
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 14:07:57 Dont have a foward facing screenshot
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 14:08:42 Its 202 blocks long, 19 blocks wide, 28,5 blocks tall
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 14:17:01 Or that
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 14:17:11 If you dont want to bother with ship designs
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 14:26:35 I used helium on my ship to improve the trim
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 14:26:51 It would sag a bit at the back without it
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 14:54:51 Looks great
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 14:55:51 Meanwhile my rooms onboard my ship
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 14:56:44 I probably have more than 200 rooms on my ship
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 14:59:33 Mine is based on 1920s
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 14:59:54 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:00:15 Although Eastern was the largest ship until 1901
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:01:42 Eastern is 211m long
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:01:50 Titanic is 269m long
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:02:01 But Titanic is over twice the size
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:07:15 Eastern has 7 decks
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:07:38 
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:07:53 Oh wait wrong pic
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:08:10 
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:08:36 At the bow where there arent boilers its 6-7 decks
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:09:41 Huh interesting
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:10:55 Time to lag the server im in by launching my ship
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:11:23 Most things look good at night
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:12:13 Heres a smoking room onboard my ship at night
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:13:54 Oh I remember when I loaded mine full of tnt
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:14:11 The server just gave up a few times
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:14:42 https://youtu.be/hVrLtMw9Jx4
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:28:18 Its hard to make tall sails
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:29:16 Im planning on making a full scale Britannic if pc2 comes out
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:29:53 Funnel becomes rocket
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:31:22 Just needs some WD40 and its fine
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 15:32:44 At least not a shredder
plane-crazy 2023-02-22 16:29:25 Well I would blow up my ship magnificently, crashing the server
help 2023-02-23 06:03:31 One block is 2,5 studs, and each stud is 28cm, so a block is 70cm which is around 2,3~ feet for the inferior measuring system
help 2023-02-23 07:09:31 1,4m is the height of a roblox avatar
help 2023-02-23 12:50:31 Half block is 1,25 but a normal block is 2,5 studs
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:03:33 Just line up center of mass and center of lift
plane-crazy 2023-02-23 16:03:42 And you are basically done
help 2023-02-25 08:59:49 5k is worth more than half a year of salaries
help 2023-02-25 08:59:59 Where I live
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:40:28 No
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:41:10 Its around 4,6
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:41:17 1,4 meters
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:41:56 Basically one block is 70cm
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:42:25 A roblox character is 5 studs tall
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:42:46 Since you can fit in 2 block tall holes
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:43:24 But they can fit
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:43:44 The additional height is hats, which you shouldnt count
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:45:15 What
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:45:17 No
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:45:39 Where did you even get 25cm from
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:46:09 So 5 times 28 is 25?
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:46:38 Which is incorrect
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:47:17 A color, a fruit, and a tree
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:47:48 Its a color anyone can choose
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:48:34 Do planes use hover engines to fly?
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:49:34 You are supposed to use wings, like a real plane
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:49:49 What can you not understand on it
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:51:02 Wow an exploit is very fast
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:51:14 And thats the problem
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:51:27 I have no idea why you still dont understand it
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:53:12 Its annoying to actually design and build a proper plane?
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:54:06 Propulsion is a part of the design and construction
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:55:09 Yea its not realistic
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:55:19 But exploits and glitches are banned regardless, for challenges and stuff
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:56:33 And the engine is at the end of the fuselage
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:57:09 I dont think he can get it if he thinks 5 times 28 is 25
plane-crazy 2023-02-27 22:57:54 What are you, a war thunder player?
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 19:20:19 Well thats a weird thing to say to someone
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 19:21:26 Insults usually arent best to prove a point
plane-crazy 2023-02-28 19:22:23 You said he blocked you
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 19:40:28 Turn on anti copy blacklist
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 19:42:15 Also I would love to see him copy my ship
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 19:42:40 Even at a speed of 1 block per second it would take him 8 and a half hours
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 19:43:17 So he just copies your plot block by block?
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 19:44:03 Ah
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 19:44:25 At that point try to sabotage your build so he wastes his time or just server hop
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 19:46:59 I can make a lot of lag really quickly in pvp servers
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 20:00:13 Noone knows
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 20:00:22 Probably not even rickje
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 21:09:41 Reporting what?
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:06:44 Well I kinda lost any hype I had for PC2
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:07:07 Apparently the plots are increased by 18 blocks in lenght and 2 in width
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:07:18 Which to me is underwhelming
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:09:16 4 years
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:10:28 4 years
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:10:56 Rickje first said in 2019 that maybe he should make pc2
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:11:30 And yea the size increase is very underwhelming
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:11:43 I though it would be 100 or more blocks
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:12:31 As a ship builder the plot size is the most limiting factor
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:12:52 I had to build a ship with 4 folds sideways to make it larger
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:13:53 Where am I trying to go?
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:14:01 Have fun moving my ship anywhere
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:14:09 Its 30026 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:14:47 Would fling at max only 1 fold and the remaining 3 would remain in place
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:15:14 Bombing my ship would crash the server
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:15:41 Maybe but I dont play pvp with it
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:15:59 It doesnt work at that scale
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:16:06 They freeze and get deleted
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:16:09 I have tried
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:16:28 Momentum?
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:16:33 Where am I gonna get that
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:17:00 When unanchored it wont move even if it says 1000 speed
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:17:17 And it has interior so I cannot fit a conveyor engine in
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:17:24 I have a good pc
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:17:34 The servers are strugling
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 23:18:22 Gtx 1650, 64GB ram I5 5700k if I remember correctly

plane-crazy 2023-04-14 12:52:47 Federal statutory law defines a “vessel” to be “every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water.“
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 12:53:45 So the requirement of a boat is it can move something on water whenever its people or cargo
plane-crazy 2023-04-14 12:53:57 So a submarine counts
creations-chat 2023-04-16 09:51:53 <@981570974568837160> for your Titanic, here are the innacuracies: the forecastle is the wrong color, the masts are the wrong color, the funnels are the wrong color, the poop deck is the wrong color, the bridge is incorrect, central bridge support is missing, lifeboat layout is incorrect, funnels arent always venting steam and the steam is vented from both sides of the funnel not just front, the 4th funnel should have a small amount of smoke coming out of it, the crows nest color is wrong, you could have put the railings sideways so it actually looks like railing, these are all the simple changes to the design that are quite easy to incorporate

plane-crazy 2023-06-08 06:03:05 I have no idea what is good and bad on planes
plane-crazy 2023-06-08 06:03:46 The shape reminds me of a plane
plane-crazy 2023-06-08 06:04:03 A flying one
plane-crazy 2023-06-08 06:17:33 I know
plane-crazy 2023-06-10 18:48:49 whats wrong with cursive?
plane-crazy 2023-06-11 10:08:40 If it was a compound steam engine then the pistons wouldnt turn in sync
creations-chat 2023-06-26 04:53:47 Titanics foward superstructure
creations-chat 2023-06-26 19:12:12 There are ways to do it, but as Titanic 1:1 would be around 384 blocks, you would need 8 accounts for it if you decide to not motorlock and fold the walls in a bungled mess
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 09:00:35 Thats what I ussualy do, just bind everthing I dont need to numpad 0
plane-crazy 2023-07-02 09:01:38 My potato laptop I used to play on did have a numpad
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:09:22 Big bote
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:10:48 Due to the hardcoding?
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:12:23 There was a lag fix in pc?
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:12:49 So thats why my computer didnt blow up running 4 accounts
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:14:07 Lag is an integral part of ship building
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:15:46 Whenever im done unfolding I always anchor, 30k+ blocks in the water unanchored are a bad time
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:16:20 That would be almost impossible to code
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:16:50 A large ship wont move anyway so its better to anchor it
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:17:45 Even better as it lags the server even more
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:18:34 I mostly build ocean liners so I have full interior in my ships which makes for 20k, 30k and above blocks builds
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:19:02 Destroying it will make more lag
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:19:31 Or a block that you and other blocks can pass trough
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:20:07 But honestly the only change I would want is to make plots 200x200x200 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:21:12 PC2 is gonna be fixing a lot of the lag issues
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:21:45 Doesnt change much, I would just need a single account and not 4+
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:22:36 Roblox is done in lua and you can publish lua games to steam
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:25:26 That will be in pc2
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 10:26:09 If pc2 comes out that is
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 12:31:58 If you set your graphics to 7 or less it actually isnt invisible
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 21:18:26 One thing that I never saw was a tutorial for a large pssenger ship with interior
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 21:23:26 Sad im not on my pc anymore
plane-crazy 2023-07-03 21:23:35 Or that my ships cant fit in the lava
plane-crazy 2023-07-05 06:31:11 Shredded cheese
creations-chat 2023-07-06 19:38:14 For Titanic, being 269m long, 28m wide, in pc it would be 384 blocks long and 40 blocks wide, so with 7-8 accounts you can build a full scale Titanic with interior
creations-chat 2023-07-07 16:27:39 yea they will get bigger, by 2 blocks in width and a few blocks in lenght
creations-chat 2023-07-10 19:01:10 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1127754334873071697 <@742181369601327215> Your ship has too shallow of a freeboard for its width and superstructure size, I would reccomend removing the top deck of the superstructure and adding a deck for the hull, also the stern mast should be tilted to the back, not to the front, with those changes it could look a lot better
creations-chat 2023-07-10 19:17:56 What will pc2 fix with it? Also have fun waiting I guess


The plots are gonna be 2 blocks wider and a few blocks longer so good luck lol
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 12:13:07 Crew cabins, kitchen, food storage, bathroom, showers, lounge
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 12:13:26 Navigational equipment and bridge
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 12:14:25 That doesnt really matter as long as its in the superstructure
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 12:14:45 Although storage can be below the main deck under the superstructure
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 12:15:17 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 12:15:57 I mostly design ocean liners, dont have much experience building cargo vessels but I know the general idea of the interiors
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 12:23:50 Yes a small one
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 12:32:24 Bridge is at the top of the superstructure along with navigational equipment
plane-crazy 2023-07-11 12:42:35 This is the bridge
creations-chat 2023-07-11 15:11:35 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1128328366420930570 at best you could unscrew that with a wrench, no screwdriver is gonna do anything to it
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 13:57:14 The foward superstructure should be wider and the bridge should be higher
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 14:03:25 I use only wedges for my ships and not angle locks, mainly becouse I build interiors, but I think on a small ship like that angle lock is not neccesary
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 14:06:51 Here are some of my bow shapes using wedges
plane-crazy 2023-07-13 14:08:51 Yea smaller scales can be tricky to do with wedges
creations-chat 2023-07-13 20:30:58 269 meters = 384 blocks
creations-chat 2023-07-14 09:43:45 What is this garbage I just read?
creations-chat 2023-07-14 09:53:24 To make a strong magnetic field you need a lot of current in a coil of copper wire
creations-chat 2023-07-14 10:00:18 No thats not a good idea, tesla coil secondary coils have a ton of thin copper wires, good for very high voltages, very bad for current
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:31:13 1:1?
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:31:41 How many blocks in lenght
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:32:29 Becouse I see 5 folds which is 250 blocks, and thats less that 1:1 scale with oceanic II
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:34:23 267 is still below 1:1
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:34:36 Oceanic II is around 300 blocks long
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:35:04 307 to be exact
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:35:53 1 block is 70cm
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:36:10 Since each block is 2,5 studs and each stud is 28cm
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:36:30 This was confirmed by both rickje and roblox
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:36:38 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:37:39 140cm is about 4-5 feet
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:38:03 307
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:38:39 You can convert cm into meters
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:38:45 70cm is 0,7m
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:39:07 Its easier and not accurate yes
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:41:06 214 blocks
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:41:43 Why do you need feey
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:41:46 Feet
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:42:14 Centi-meter
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:42:38 1/100th of a meter
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:42:51 I never saud that
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:43:14 Yea if you ignore accuracy
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:44:09 Yea its easier, but if you want to make a precise 1:1 build its 0,7m
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:44:50 Just place a block in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:46:24 
plane-crazy 2023-07-14 12:46:42 This is 0,7x0,7x0,7m
creations-chat 2023-07-14 15:08:56 Make the rest of Olympic <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 08:47:32 Will it have interior?
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 08:48:22 Except for the underwater part since is not there
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 08:48:47 Good luck on it
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 09:05:15 Back on my old laptop just being in a server I would get sub 20 fps, and yt I still built a 13k blocks ship even though I had 3-6 fps with it
plane-crazy 2023-07-15 11:16:11 hows this for a big bote
creations-chat 2023-07-16 10:17:35 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1129982472604614696 <@753617470551752766> that lusitania is very blocky
creations-chat 2023-07-16 10:20:02 First ships are almost always downvoted, for your ship its quite low in the water and frankly very bland, you should add details like windows, winches, railings, cargo hatches, deck details and stuff

I agree with doctorhayman that less saturated colors and textures would also help
creations-chat 2023-07-16 10:24:32 And you didnt answer, you just insulted them
creations-chat 2023-07-16 10:34:29 And they asked for feedback for making it better since it was their first ship
help 2023-07-16 11:50:49 do these colors look good for 1940s ocean liner?
help 2023-07-16 11:54:25 alright
creations-chat 2023-07-16 20:00:55 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1130199535164076033 <@845583896963842069> pretty good job on the Titanic, though I have to say the interiors could use quite a lot of improvements and also the boiler rooms arent just boilers but also large uptakes with catwalks and ladders on them, the exterior could also use some work, desaturated colors would help along with less "blockyness", also the pool and grand staircase (if that is the grand staircase) are quite bad, also the engine room is very odd
creations-chat 2023-07-17 09:42:38 The bow could use a better shape, also those portholes could be replaced by black circle emoji and it would look much much better
creations-chat 2023-07-17 09:47:04 Well here is my 1910s ocean liner, black circle emoji as portholes and windows work very well
creations-chat 2023-07-17 09:57:51 Its 23 blocks wide with a 13 block free board and 9 block draught, its as wide as ships should be
creations-chat 2023-07-17 10:00:49 Too skinny bridge?
creations-chat 2023-07-17 10:02:56 Becouse thats how ocean liners of 1890s and early 1900s look like
creations-chat 2023-07-17 10:18:07 Unless you are building Titanic, add custom stuff
creations-chat 2023-07-17 10:41:47 Becouse tanks are very cramped with tiny interior, so it would take a huge amount of effort to make the interior
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 11:31:10 I think its a feature to prevent lag, doesnt work at all to reduce lag and is just annoying though
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 11:31:18 Especially on large builds
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 11:32:14 Its why I stopped putting lights on my ships
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 11:32:44 I dont have night on
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 11:32:49 Simple as that
plane-crazy 2023-07-17 11:37:27 heres a picture of my last ship to use lights, was a huge pain to keep the lights on
creations-chat 2023-07-17 12:25:15 Superstructures are white, always on passenger ships
creations-chat 2023-07-17 12:30:20 Becouse of... Fog?
creations-chat 2023-07-17 12:37:24 No passenger ship ever had superstructures of other colors, only white, if your windows make it look odd, then its the windows that look odd, not the color
creations-chat 2023-07-17 13:30:32 Fun fact: plots are 39 blocks tall, compared to 51 width and lenght
creations-chat 2023-07-17 13:35:25 Yup, the plots are tiny if you are building ships or buidings, and PC2 wont fix this as the plots will be increased to 53x69x(height not known), so multi account builds will still be usefull, my newest ship uses 4 accounts and folds like this
creations-chat 2023-07-17 13:38:17 Can you make plots larger? Consider using folds for your creation. Hard to do when there is no space for more folds
creations-chat 2023-07-17 13:40:20 And fun fact, the height of a plot is 39, but its 38 above the surface, theres a layer where you can build underground, becouse amazing coding
creations-chat 2023-07-17 14:13:48 Here is how I fit my largest single plot ship in, it also has full interior so motorlocking the hull is very complicated
creations-chat 2023-07-17 14:16:23 The only issue is sideways interior

plane-crazy 2023-07-20 09:46:41 Yes
plane-crazy 2023-07-20 21:55:59 Spawning in, my camera instantly switches to a camera on my build, not game breaking just annoying to cycle trough all cameras
