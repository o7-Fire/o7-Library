plane-crazy 2022-01-24 17:32:51 and if so
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 17:32:55 how do i change the center of mass
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 17:33:37 HOLY SHIT ITS NOT TILTING
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 17:33:40 THIS IS A MIRACLE

plane-crazy 2022-01-24 17:59:10 without it being too slow
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 17:59:12 and too hard to control
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 17:59:27 its kinda small so it affects a lot
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 17:59:39 it'll be too fast
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 17:59:41 even harder to control
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 18:00:26 ok cant send images
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 18:00:29 copy and paste broke
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 18:00:37 i use clipping tools or whatever its called
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 18:02:44 and guys
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 18:02:47 should i modify my ac 130

plane-crazy 2022-01-24 18:03:14 wdym
plane-crazy 2022-01-24 18:04:15 2 pair of wings*
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:24:12 what is a good counter against bugs
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:24:17 i have met the single most disgusting bug user ever
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:29:24 bug users on the way to tell me how following a tutorial is skill
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:29:27 üëç
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:29:45 honestly bug isnt even that effective to kill enemies
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:29:50 its just disgusting to play against
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:29:57 this bug chased me for like
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:29:58 2 mins straight
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:30:03 my extremely unstable ac130 still flies
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:30:21 also my ac130
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:30:29 it looks like a tutorial ac130
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:30:34 but i just took inspiration from it
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:30:35 i built it myself
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:30:59 im pretty proud of this creation considering that i have negative iq
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:31:01 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBVou8co15Y&ab_channel=RafailiNuu
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:31:05 this tutorial inspired me btw
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:31:08 no not really
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:31:19 i can stream and you guys can see my ac130 is extremely unstable
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:31:24 and its not so great in pvp
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:31:27 but its still fun to use whatsoever
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:31:47 im thinking about making a vtol
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:31:49 or an armored train
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:33:30 also my ac130 physics is really weird
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 08:33:34 i need to find a fix somehow
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 09:27:44 2 complicated 4 me
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 09:57:38 im not getting in depth in this game anyways
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 09:57:50 its frustrating
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 09:57:55 ive spent time building stuff and stuff
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 09:58:00 i either literally cant make a good shape
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 09:58:04 or cant make the good shape into work
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 09:58:21 how many times i tried to make a helicopter and it didnt work, it jsut spins around or flips back
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 10:00:09 they never seem to work for me
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 10:00:14 im doing something wrong pretty sure
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 10:00:20 but im just too frustrated to go on
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 10:00:23 this ac130 is the furthest i can go
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 10:00:30 i also built some kind of space gunship
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 10:00:32 idk what to call it
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 10:00:36 thats also the furthest i can go
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 10:00:41 considering it works but its extremely drifty
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 10:00:43 if you get what i mean
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 10:00:56 since its powered by floating technologies with hover pad or whatever theyre called
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 10:01:06 at least it flies
plane-crazy 2022-06-30 10:31:01 how does one make a plane more controllable
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:31:11 how do you guys come up with these godly plane designs
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:34:19 modified ac130 thats super fucking hard to control üò≥
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:34:31 it takes like 2 hours to turn around
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:34:38 but it looks cool so ill let it pass
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:35:01 and i hate people mistaking my ac130 as the tutorial one üò≠
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:35:04 they just look similar man
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:35:13 no im but maybe i can add that
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:35:20 yeah ill add that
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:35:33 theres guns in the other side
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:35:58 
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:36:28 its so hard to control this thing
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:36:34 i need to improve it
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:37:17 it just feels so heavy
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:39:52 i think i may or may not have found a fix to it
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:41:14 FUCK
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:41:16 what do i do now
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:41:23 help
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:41:36 save me
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:41:50 oh
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:41:52 propellor blade
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:41:56 that should work
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:41:57 i think
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:43:53 now its going up very easily
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:43:56 but it struggles to go down
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:45:36 PERFECT
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:45:39 i added too much helium in the front
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:46:12 fuck jets
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:46:14 build gunships
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:46:27 but seriously
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:46:30 the community seems to have some kind of
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:46:34 weird obsession with jets
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:46:40 ac130 actually
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:47:04 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:47:19 i name this the ac140
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:47:42 same
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:48:48 he got some good pfp tho
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 10:51:38 then do it
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 11:05:01 are there blocks with the minecraft stair shape here
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 11:05:42 how
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 11:05:48 i remember i saw one before but im not so sure
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 11:08:17 how does one make a good counter to shredder bugs
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 11:08:48 right
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 11:08:55 honestly theres no purpose of using a gunship in this game
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 11:09:01 just make a vtol with a hanging turret
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 11:09:05 its gonna be way better than gunships
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 11:09:18 gunships lack precision with unnecessary mobility
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 11:09:29 but they look cool so im still making one
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 11:10:43 10 out of 10
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 11:39:24 whats a good usage of lava spitter actually
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 11:39:27 i dont see any reason to really use it
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 11:39:59 also final form of my ac 130
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 11:58:08 my plane seems to have a bad balance
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 11:58:21 the head starts falling when flying
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 11:58:32 i need to manually pull up with propellers to prevent it going down
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 11:58:42 is there a way to balance the plane without using helium
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 11:58:52 helium is gonna unbalance the plane and make it super hard to turn down
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 12:15:06 we need someone to build the snowpiercer in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 12:15:25 and we're gonna drive it when the map is covered in snow
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 12:30:25 wtf is that
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 12:33:21 <:what:644996672048463942>
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 12:40:09 that simply does not look like anything
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 12:40:11 even with motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:17:36 overcomplicating simple planes.jpg
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:19:42 now nobody is gonna call my plane a tutorial build
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:19:50 because what kind of psychopath would put this tail in a tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:19:52 literal waste of time
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:21:47 honestly making a bad build is better than copying a good build
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:22:11 (bad build)
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:22:22 i spent hours making this more controllable
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:22:24 and i fucking did it
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:22:45 it looks like
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:22:46 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBVou8co15Y&ab_channel=RafailiNuu
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:22:48 this one
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:22:54 before i uh
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:23:02 it looked like this one before i did a major change today
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:23:12 people mistaked my original one as a tutorial plane üò≠
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:23:22 i feel insulted
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:24:03 i can make it like this
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:24:09 FUCK
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:24:19 that description was weird but i like it
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:24:47 i did
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:24:58 but i changed it for more guns
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:25:02 so its a did
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:25:09 its gonna be too fucking long if i add sparklers
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:25:11 again
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:25:18 i have no idea how to motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:25:30 how do i motor lock this one actually
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:25:41 fff
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:28:04 i lack the ability to motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:28:46 not even the most simple ones
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:32:23 how does motorlock fucking work
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:34:20 MY MOTORLOCK
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:34:22 ATE MY MOTOR2
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:34:23 WTF
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:34:36 how do i fix that
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:35:52 motor lock is so fucking complicated
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:35:59 it effectively gave me autism in 5 minutes
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:36:19 who the fuck even made motor lock
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:37:47 motorlock is just overcomplicating things
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:37:49 just add rescale
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:37:54 and grid movement
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:39:23 https://plane-crazy.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Motor_Lock
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:39:25 i am reading this t hing
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:39:30 and it gives me autism as well
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:40:53 nah this shit is more complicated than algebra 2
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:40:55 i give up
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:42:37 tracking missile biplane might be the most cursed thing ever
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:43:00 i am not sure but im pretty sure faster than a helicopter
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:44:28 ok i understand motorlock now
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:44:30 the thing is
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:44:49 how do i make this thing compress downwards instead of upwards
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:45:36 i have learnt motorlock for like 30 fucking seconds and this is my first comment
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:45:38 thank you so much
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:48:18 why are my motor2s not working after motorlocking
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:50:48 ok motorlock gave me autism again
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:50:52 i fucking give up
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:54:05 none
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:54:06 make ac130
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:57:21 good luck making it work
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:57:30 then make ac130 and make guns in the front instead of the sides
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:58:15 what about use the original propeller and make it not complicated
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:58:31 thats true actually
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:59:23 how do u even compact things into a fucking line
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:59:25 oh wait
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:59:27 yeah right
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:59:36 i know how now
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 13:59:37 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:00:37 MY MOTORLOCKS REFUSE TO WORK PROPERLY WHEN I ADD GUNS
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:00:38 WTF
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:01:22 yeah this little bastard is just racist to guns
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:01:51 he's not racist to rockets tho
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:02:43 why do guns and only guns cant go together
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:05:39 why is it so hard to motorlock guns wtf
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:05:43 why are motorlocks racist to guns
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:05:56 they literally refuse to work if theres guns in front of them
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:06:22 my copy and paste keys are broken
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:06:24 i dont wanna restart
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:09:07 I DID IT
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:09:09 I MOTORLOCKED GUNS
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:09:11 LETS FUCKING GO
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:09:19 i feel like the smartest mf in the world rn
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:09:59 yeah and it also broke my plane effectively
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:10:41 yeah no it doesnt work
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:10:44 i motorlocked it
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:10:48 but its just so fucking weird when it turns
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:10:57 i fucked up the building mechanic
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:11:05 ok i have to reword that
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:11:09 i fucked up the eturning mechanic
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:13:01 i know why its weird now
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:13:02 let me fix that
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:13:11 wait then the guns are gonna be too far down
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:13:14 motorlock.exe
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:15:14 snowpiercer in plane crazie‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:15:39 anyways after doing it its fully unnecessary to motorlock in my build
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:15:53 i have been wasting my time since the beginning
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:36:47 definitely easier than ww1
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:37:02 you gotta do two wings while making it not look weird for ww1
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:37:10 can i have a pic
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:37:14 i have an obession with airships and gunships
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:37:30 now that my gunship is done
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:37:33 airship is next
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:39:16 why tutorial build man
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:39:32 flying dutchman with a balloon on it
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:39:59 still flying dutchman
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:40:07 if you think about it
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:40:14 theres no point to play this game if u dont build your own things
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 14:40:35 anyways enough of this, anyone got a good zeppelin tutorial?
plane-crazy 2022-07-01 16:46:33 wtf is that
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:14:51 observation dome on a plane for whatever reason
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:15:09 me
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:15:50 oh shit
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:15:53 these people
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:16:08 "this dance can help ukraine" ü•∫
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:17:21 youre making me feel like im a bad builder
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:17:22 (i am)
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:17:29 is that from warhammer 40k or something
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:17:31 it looks familiar
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:17:42 yooo
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:17:45 is it armed
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:18:09 i wanted to build a giant space warship for pvp
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:18:12 but im just too bad
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:18:15 also giant builds are just free target
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:18:20 but they look cool anywaYS
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:19:21 the dome looks oddly good
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:19:58 should i add rockets
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:20:05 i feel liek guns are a bit not enough
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:20:25 we cant do shit lmao
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:20:31 probably make a shredder to fight off shredders
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:20:52 https://tenor.com/view/fraz-bradford-meme-world-of-tanks-albania-gif-20568566
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:20:54 average shredder bug builder
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:20:59 average custom builder
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:21:04 FUCK
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:21:21 thanks bro
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:21:22 i love you
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:21:25 thats literally your face rn
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:21:30 not even joking
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:24:59 (at least its original)
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:25:24 look man heres 5 levels of players in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:25:58 1 - follows tutorials to build shredders
2 - follow tutorials to build some other stuff 
3 - builds your own stuff
4 - builds your own stuff and its good
5 - builds your own stuff and it goes in <#627195143040139264>
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:26:16 look at these 2 pieces of shit
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:26:26 theres a black shredder next to it and a mini shredder army
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:27:53 
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:27:59 dude this is literally comedy
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:28:03 i found a big ac130 in my server
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:28:05 and i have a small one
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:28:18 then we started ac130 dogfighting
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:28:32 we have literally the same armaments
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:28:35 and the same flare
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:28:41 but his ac130 is a tutorial one i think
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:29:47 oh its not a tutorial build
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:29:51 no??
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:29:56 gunships are still gonna bombard the smoke
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:29:57 and youre gone
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:30:18 ac130
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:30:19 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:30:21 theres one in my server rn
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:30:35 i mean you can use them as distractions
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:30:38 but its not worth the effort
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:30:42 unless you simply have way too much time
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:31:12 thats gonna be really hard
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:31:18 like really
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:31:22 i think
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:32:36 its stupid to build that
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:32:41 limited ammo and just
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:32:43 its hard to fit in a gunship
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:33:01 well i never tried so im not sure
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:33:06 but it doesnt sound so great on paper
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:33:18 like this thing is enough
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:33:40 do cutters deal more damage with higher velocity
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:34:00 they should make it do higher damage according to velocity
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:34:08 then we can have hypersonic railguns
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:35:39 its satisfying bombarding shredder armies with gunships
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:37:48 gunships easily dominate ground targets
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:37:52 i mean yeah theyre made to be like that
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:37:58 and good gunships can dodge jets
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:38:03 but canat really fight back tbh
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:38:15 its so disturbing when theres a jet behind me, he misses and i miss as well
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:38:24 im not building a big one
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:38:28 plus i dont know about motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:38:34 yes it can
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:38:44 my gunship is literally just a slower jet and with air to ground weapons
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:38:47 its not really that slow
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:39:30 how it feels to play plane crazy pvp :
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:40:04 what.
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:43:49 hypersonic tnt balls and explode on impact?
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:43:53 is it able to react fast enough
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:43:57 to explode before bouncing off
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:47:58 whats a good helicopter engine for beginners
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:48:45 heres my horrible huey model that i need to strap an engine on
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:55:41 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzPiu4YPqYE&t=13s&ab_channel=16clampa
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:55:45 should i build something like this
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:57:09 im not sayisng
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:57:12 im following the tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:57:16 im asking should i build a vtol
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:57:26 is it worth building in this game
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:57:52 i have issues telling are you being sarcastic or youre dyslexic
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:58:22 yeah sorry youre dyslexic
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:58:59 SIR
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:59:00 IM ASKING
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:59:05 SHOULD I BUILD A VTOL LIKE THE TUTORIAL ONE
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:59:11 NOT ASKING SHOULD I FOLLOW THE TUTORIAL
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:59:28 i give up
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 09:59:55 cutters dont do more damage on velocity
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:00:04 which is honestly unfortunate
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:00:30 or really find a way to glitch the cutter to the enemy build
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:00:33 and make it tear through the enemy
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:00:35 as it moves by the glitch
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:01:09 alright im gonna try to build an a10 now
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:01:21 a10 and ac130 are like the horsemen of CAS
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:01:53 i often struggle to build planes tbh
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:04:02 ok i give up
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:04:05 after 2 minutes
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:04:11 i literally have issues building any plane head
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:04:15 or cockpit
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:04:18 or whatever the fuck its called
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:05:03 yeah i know youre dyslexic
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:05:07 can you kindly stop talking
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:05:58 yeah a10 probably sucks in this game anyways
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:06:29 should i build a vtol that looks like this
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:06:34 or the v22 osprey type
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:07:11 which one would be better for pvp
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:07:20 v22 is more of a gunship
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:07:26 this one is more of a jet
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:07:54 i can actually still air to ground guns in the jet type one
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:07:57 so im gonna do the jet one
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:08:02 ok nevermind
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:08:06 i suck at building cockpits
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:08:07 i forgor that
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:11:35 wait what if i like
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:11:38 modify my ac130 to be a vtol
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:15:20 the wheel is behind him
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 10:31:02 thats what she said
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:14:50 jet users when they see a gunship :
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:15:01 it basically equals a single guy when they see a female
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:15:26 bro fr
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:15:39 look at this thing
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:15:43 literally beautiful
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:15:53 fr
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:16:01 i would literally die if a boy did this to me
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:16:04 insert a flamethrower pic
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:17:22 tfw 2 tutorial jets after ur ass
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:18:12 how do u even counter jets properly with a gunship
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:18:37 perfect counter
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:20:14 counter my ass
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:20:15 mf literally
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:20:17 ran away
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:20:20 after i got 2 missiles behind me
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:25:42 wish pvp is more interesting
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:25:46 and jet users are less of a coward
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:25:55 jet users literally refuse to do dogfights and only chase off gunships
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:25:59 gunships and literally gunships only
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:26:07 not even ground targets
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:26:12 because theyre too bad to line up their target
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:26:26 bro took like 5 tries to take down a 250 speed gunshipo
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:26:30 with full 10 missiles
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:26:33 üëç
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:27:49 can i possibly fit 2 rockets into this thing
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:29:18 im too dumb to
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:29:32 my brain can only do this
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:29:46 with 20kx20k ping
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:30:04 its definitely interesting
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:30:23 but again
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:30:27 the pings gonna be real high
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:30:30 from all the things exploding and falling off
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:31:39 me and the boys waiting for them to add votekick
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:31:47 so we can manually fuck off the shredders
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:32:15 yeah thats really cool
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:32:45 its concerning this is true
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:32:56 autosave right before you get kicked
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:32:57 boom
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:34:14 then people are just gonna disable people with actual good builds and skill
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:35:51 ive seen a person
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:35:54 switch from a shredder army
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:35:59 to a singular long shredder
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:36:02 now what this means is
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:36:09 people who build shredders are literally fucking infected
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:36:17 they dont build one but literally entire fucking storage of every shredder possible
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:36:19 and its simply disgusting
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:36:40 vk/IIlIlIlIl
"bruh whats his name!?!?!??!?!"
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:37:47 i can actually add rockets below this thing
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:37:54 but its gonna unbalance the plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:37:58 and make it just harder to pilot in general
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:38:00 should i do it
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:38:25 no image perms or simply clipboard is glitched
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:40:42 i just blind spray shredder armies with a gunship
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:42:06 how does one fit all 10 rockets into a size of 1
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:42:36 i know but like how exactly do you lock them
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:42:37 im new to locking
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:43:37 my dumbass brain :
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:43:45 i know
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:44:24 can you make this rocket not fucking fall
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:44:40 without rotating
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:46:23 this piece of shit is disgusting
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:46:54 this motherfucker chases no one but gunships
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:46:58 no ground targets because he sucks ass
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:48:39 TUT F14 LMAO
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:48:50 i swear 90% of the jet builds you see in pubs are tut builds
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:50:45 i transformed the top one to the bottom one in like 2 days
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:51:00 i dont know what im doing
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:51:01 but its cool
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:51:19 also its funny my top one looks like a tut ac130
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 14:51:23 but i swear i built it myself üíÄ

plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:24:24 it still hits something??
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:26:34 but ac130
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:26:36 literally existed in
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:26:40 vietnam war
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:26:47 had a stroke

plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:44:00 hello.
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:50:08 LMAO
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:50:34 should i add anchor in my build
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:50:38 it can become a literal floating fort
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:50:39 if i do
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:50:55 ill die eventually
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:50:57 so i g uess
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:50:59 guess
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:51:27 no
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:51:28 boats suck
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:52:52 well
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:52:54 as i said
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:53:06 almost 90% of the pvp builds you see are from tut
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:53:40 wtf
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:53:43 blocks become lighter
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:53:45 with ice?
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:54:17 should i make my gunship ice then
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:55:11 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLnKvQdppvY&ab_channel=namnamCh.
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:55:13 bro this man
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:55:16 holy shit
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:55:18 smart as fuck
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:55:27 i am lucky to be the 10% after modifying my plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:55:31 it originally looked like a tutorial one
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:55:35 and people mistook it as one
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:55:59 honestly made me kind of upsetr
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:56:05 but the one i have right now
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:56:14 what kind of psychopath would make that a tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:56:44 fuck
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:56:55 im pretty sure a build like mine wont appear as a tutorial for a long time
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:57:16 because really only psychopaths would overcomplicate stuff like me
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:57:42 it is complicated when you compare it to the original one
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:57:59 my original one is like a really basic ac130
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:58:06 now i built one with fucking rockets
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:58:17 tutorials are always the most complicated
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:58:21 you have no idea wtf are you doing
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:58:28 you just follow it and you never realise if youre doing something wrong
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:58:35 and you'd never even stop before you finish the entire build
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:58:42 but when you finish the entire build, its too late to bugfix
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:58:47 because you literally have no idea how the thing works
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:59:17 fr
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:59:33 i truly respect any builders who build their own shit
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:59:36 literally
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:59:43 even if you build a simple ass plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 15:59:46 at least you did it yourself
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:00:46 i also switched the design of the guns
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:00:50 this is WAY better than my previous one
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:00:56 my previous one always get stuck because its too long
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:01:06 now this one never gets stuck and can hit basically anywhere i point
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:01:39 how do i fix my camera being locked when i spawn
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:01:46 i have to manually switch it
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:01:48 whats causing it
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:02:26 yeah but its annoying to
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:02:29 always press it twice
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:02:54 also i find it funny that you know
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:03:01 gunships are supposed to be slow and heavy right
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:03:09 my gunship is honestly very fucking agile
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:03:24 and by very, i mean actually it can nearly become a jet
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:03:38 i disabled my rudders because
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:03:39 i dont know
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:03:43 my rudders function very weirdly
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:03:52 they change where my plane is facing
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:03:57 but its really changing where its facing
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:04:02 it doesnt change where its going
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:06:00 the fuck?
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:06:55 aman
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:08:07 now that its done.
what do i add next?
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:09:11 honestly
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:09:17 tut builds are still builds
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:09:20 if theyre good then theyre good
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:09:42 "akshully ü§ì"
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:10:36 "its not a tut build i built it myself ü§ì"
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:50:59 how do you guys bring vtol to a full stop and hover
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:51:18 my semi vtol plane can hover but i need to manually pull up for a bit
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:51:26 and it keeps moving as well
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:52:01 i dont know tbh
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:52:11 its the manual pullup that struggles me the most
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:53:12 the front of my plane will be too light if i
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:53:13 WAIT
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:53:14 ICE
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:54:00 ok it still falls
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:54:46 hover thrusters?
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:54:51 is it gonna help
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:56:22 wdym
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:56:38 honestly i have no fix
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:56:43 if i put helium in the front
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:56:49 the front part is gonna be too light
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 16:58:50 i guess ill just manual pullup
general 2022-07-02 17:03:40 honestly why dont irl militaries use vtols instead of normal jets
general 2022-07-02 17:05:08 well yeah but normal jets are expensive as fuck as well
general 2022-07-02 17:05:44 but honestly vtol is just better than jets in every aspect i think
general 2022-07-02 17:05:47 or jets can be faster since
general 2022-07-02 17:05:52 its more concentrated in 1 side
general 2022-07-02 17:06:15 or you can strap a machine gun below it and make it a fucking cas machine
general 2022-07-02 17:06:45 well yaeh
general 2022-07-02 17:06:52 the good old a10 and ac130s will handle the cas
general 2022-07-02 17:07:19 a10 and ac130s are just the classics of the classics
general 2022-07-02 17:07:22 yes
general 2022-07-02 17:08:35 which is why honestly a10 and ac130 arent that good irl
general 2022-07-02 17:08:51 just head inside the warzone and you'll see a shit bunch of anti air
general 2022-07-02 17:08:52 flying towards you
general 2022-07-02 17:09:08 a10 and ac130 are mostly used in unbalanced fights i think
general 2022-07-02 17:09:15 fights where your enemies literally dont have the ability for anti air
general 2022-07-02 17:09:21 then you use them to clean up the shit quickly
general 2022-07-02 17:10:02 honestly
general 2022-07-02 17:10:10 a lot of military shit sounds extremely good on paper
general 2022-07-02 17:10:14 but theres always gonna be counters to it
general 2022-07-02 17:10:34 like bro a flying fort with explosive weaponary
general 2022-07-02 17:10:36 who wouldnt like that
general 2022-07-02 17:10:40 but in reality you just get shot down by aa's
general 2022-07-02 17:11:18 tfw ac130 shot down
general 2022-07-02 17:11:24 (us military is broke now)
general 2022-07-02 17:11:43 in reality ground forces get fucked by enemy vehicles
general 2022-07-02 17:11:49 wait fuck
general 2022-07-02 17:11:51 im dyslexic
general 2022-07-02 17:11:52 nevermind
general 2022-07-02 17:11:54 never fucking mind
general 2022-07-02 17:12:00 ok actually im still not wrong
general 2022-07-02 17:12:21 war is just countering your counter to my counter
general 2022-07-02 17:13:14 they turned brm5 into dcs
general 2022-07-02 17:13:18 üíÄüíÄ
general 2022-07-02 17:14:04 what other air vehicles would fit for good cas
general 2022-07-02 17:14:11 only the good ol' classics a10 and ac130
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 17:15:43 because roblox
general 2022-07-02 17:22:10 well yeah
general 2022-07-02 17:22:20 training is an issue as well
general 2022-07-02 17:23:20 ok honestly after thinking about it
general 2022-07-02 17:23:25 vtol isn‚Äôt even good
general 2022-07-02 17:23:32 just use a fucking helicopter
general 2022-07-02 17:23:33 or a jet
general 2022-07-02 17:23:48 vtol is trying to be both but it‚Äôs not good at any side
general 2022-07-02 17:24:36 like if you‚Äôre only arming it for the front side, just use a jet
if you‚Äôre only arming it for air to ground (for some reason), just use a helicopter
general 2022-07-02 17:24:39 there‚Äôs no point
general 2022-07-02 17:24:43 it‚Äôs even expensive
general 2022-07-02 17:25:17 yeah i know im just assuming
general 2022-07-02 17:25:36 but in what scenario would you reallllly need to take off in such a cramped space
general 2022-07-02 17:26:08 just use a fucking helicopter on battleships
general 2022-07-02 17:26:21 why is it an airfield if doesn‚Äôt support planes
general 2022-07-02 17:26:46 no the logic is just weird
general 2022-07-02 17:27:09 aircraft carriers are supposed to have enough space for jets takeoff
general 2022-07-02 17:27:26 it‚Äôd be confusing if all airfields are gone
general 2022-07-02 17:27:47 jets can honestly do that as well
general 2022-07-02 17:28:00 they‚Äôre expensive as shit but you‚Äôre not wrong
general 2022-07-02 17:28:27 air strikes are precise while artillery strike and shit are really just morale boost
general 2022-07-02 17:28:53 batteships aren‚Äôt precise enough but it works
general 2022-07-02 17:29:04 but here‚Äôs one issue

plane-crazy 2022-07-02 18:37:51 if i add helium to the front
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 18:37:55 it becomes way too light
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 18:38:02 that when i go into flight mode
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 18:38:08 it moves up
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 18:39:53 its not really vtol
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 18:39:55 its actually for hovering
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 18:40:05 since im a gunship, i think adding a hover feature would be really nice
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 18:40:13 its like semi vtol

plane-crazy 2022-07-02 19:02:11 i give up
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 19:02:24 helium makes the front float in flight
plane-crazy 2022-07-02 19:02:42 ballast makes it too light as well

plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:11:24 motor locking
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:11:30 makes builds look really complicated
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:11:37 even though they actually aren‚Äôt
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:15:13 i wanna build a stealth bomber
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:15:16 it looks cool
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:15:27 however i can‚Äôt motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:15:56 also bombers are not great in general
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:16:13 just use a gunship for airstrikes
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:16:43 ballz
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:18:01 honesty plane crazy pvp is
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:18:03 not fun.
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:18:35 none of the machines are actually effective
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:18:51 we have ground vehicles that never mattered and never kills anything
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:19:06 we have gunships that spend 5 mins spawnkilling ground vehicles
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:19:18 we have jets that spend 5 mins spawnkilling gunships
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:19:27 and we have ships that never existed because no one builds them
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:19:54 also bombers that miss 90% of its charge
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:22:10 im a certified gun ship user
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:22:20 i tend to spawnkill any ground vehicles i see
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:22:28 i tend to rage over jets chasing me
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:22:37 and i get joy from bullying ground vehicles
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:22:55 ground vehicles have no power to fight back any type of planes tbh
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:23:01 they‚Äôre just not agile enough
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:23:19 then we‚Äôll realise we can‚Äôt hit each other
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:23:27 because of the funny gun mechanics in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-07-04 17:23:39 hitscan guns flushed

plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:10:30 4 times the firepower
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:10:58 also it cant fly like this
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:11:07 or hover like this
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:11:09 this isnt even a vtol

plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:13:19 la vtol

plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:36:47 i want that
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:45:50 they need to add a full block feature
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:45:56 so alpha doesnt come to me every 2 seconds and act like i know him
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:46:09 he thinks annoying me gets him benefits apparently
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:46:49 <@849557593046777886>
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:47:14 motherfucker really joined me and annoyed me with a shredder
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:47:17 "omg how did i hit that"
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:47:25 how the fuck do u miss with a mouse directed machine
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:47:33 on a fucking osprey with 200 speed
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:48:05 my guy stopped and aimed before going full throttle
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:48:06 how'd he miss
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:49:49 this shit looks weird
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:49:50 how do i fix it
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:50:00 by miss
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:50:00 oh
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:50:06 i mean going full throttle cutter
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:50:08 not guns
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:55:12 how do i make the interiors look less empty
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:55:22 or just keep it like this
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:55:32 seats are too heavy
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:55:35 i only have 2 prop engines
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:57:29 TUTORIAL A10 LOL
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:57:31 where
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 13:58:46 a10 users on the way to miss their bombs
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:01:10 wtf is this
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:02:46 so my osprey tends to start stalling when i switch my propellers foward
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:02:57 any fix to that
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:03:02 adding ballast in the back didnt work
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:03:10 adding helium in the front lifts too much
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:04:16 doesnt work
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:04:20 i use motor 1s
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:05:17 its complicated
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:05:30 im gonna have to do a lot of testing
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:05:33 if im using motor 2s
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:05:39 since i cant only use 90 or 45
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:05:50 my osprey requires a very specific angle to fly
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:05:53 which is what im trying to fix
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:06:47 IT HOVERS
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:06:49 (but it falls while hovering)
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:08:08 anyways if you look my vtol is actually really similar to this one lmao
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:08:30 i actually took some design off it because im just way too bad with the heads
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:08:36 and i had no idea how to make the tail
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:09:02 except my osprey is like 2 times cooler ngl
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:09:28 would hydrofoils even work in this game
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 14:09:39 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uk6UpZ-Qe8I&ab_channel=T7bean
