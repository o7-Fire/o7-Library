general 2020-10-17 04:09:13 Hey, does anyone know what the heaviest block in plane crazy is?
general 2020-10-17 04:10:29 Thank you for boosting my ego
general 2020-10-17 17:07:21 Hey, can someone tell me how I see the helium block count on my planes?
general 2020-10-17 17:07:54 Ah, ok, thanks for the help.
help 2020-10-17 17:11:16 Hey, can someone tell me how I see the helium block count on one of my creations? I'm trying to apply for a rank and I have to show that it has no helium blocks on it.
creations-chat 2020-10-17 17:52:45 What do you guys think I could improve on my Mig-21?
creations-chat 2020-10-17 17:54:39 I just removed the pvp weapons and landing gear to make it look better, and I might add a motor lock later
creations-chat 2020-10-17 17:55:47 What kind of camo do you think would look better? This was my first time doing one, so I looked up a picture and tried to copy that camo from it the best I could.
creations-chat 2020-10-17 17:57:07 Well, I'm pretty new to the game and don't really know many good building tips.
creations-chat 2020-10-17 18:57:58 <@!551806781609869313>  What do you think now? The new camo is based on the picture below.
creations-chat 2020-10-17 18:59:44 Heres what its based off of, I couldn't put the numbers because they kept getting blurred so I put "2nd Lt. Phoenix" instead.
creations-chat 2020-10-17 19:00:57 Fixing that right now.
creations-chat 2020-10-17 19:02:52 Better?
creations-chat 2020-10-17 19:05:16 Is this better? no more bottom fuselage curve. I will start working on the nose
creations-chat 2020-10-17 19:14:44 Removed the curve from the nose, what do you think now?
creations-chat 2020-10-17 19:18:22 Tried to put the 2x1 in it and now I can't have the pointy thing on top because it falls off. nvm adjusted its position and it works now
creations-chat 2020-10-17 19:27:40 Ok added the 2x1 wedge and some other things. And I didn't remove the nose cone it just blends in very well with the back round because its dark green
creations-chat 2020-10-17 19:53:39 I don't like anime, but what you created looked really good
creations-chat 2020-10-18 01:42:06 F-104 that I made, what do you guys think?
creations-chat 2020-10-18 01:45:59 <@!328023271721271296> Yeah, I tried to make it look as good as possible, but in the end I had to make it like that to be able to make the vertical stabilizer look somewhat like the actual plane
creations-chat 2020-10-18 02:25:54 Got some advice and modified the nose and fuselage, what do you guys think I could do to improve it next?
creations-chat 2020-10-18 02:36:50 Also I don't know how, would I use motors?
creations-chat 2020-10-18 02:38:39 Outstanding first words

general 2020-10-20 21:07:02 Wait, so is the new saved data limit 2500 or 250k?
general 2020-10-20 21:07:22 idk
general 2020-10-20 21:07:23 Brb
general 2020-10-20 21:07:29 I think I read an old ping
general 2020-10-20 21:07:50 Yeah I read an old ping
creations-chat 2021-04-25 03:53:58 Yeah, I'll probably put it on a boat rather than a sub
help 2021-04-28 00:16:57 I'm trying to make a plane, but I'm not sure how to build the fuselage to make it look realistic. The plane I'm trying to build is a TBD devastator. Any tips on how to build the fuselage are appreciated.
