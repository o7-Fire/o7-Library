help 2022-09-01 14:11:36 follow up to emphasize my problem, i havent made a working plane in months bc of this
help 2022-09-01 14:11:38 very helpful
plane-crazy 2022-09-01 14:15:02 change my mind: building good planes is not hard because of game physics, but because of the unending stream of bugs
help 2022-09-01 14:29:39 not m2m
help 2022-09-01 14:29:42 just keyboard
help 2022-09-01 14:29:50 m2m is even worse

help 2022-11-22 21:51:19 exposed motorlock how fix
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 21:52:24 wanna see the motorlock tower (its a pvp jet)
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 21:52:52 its just one tower
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 21:52:55 but
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 21:53:00 its quite a large one
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 21:53:07 for performance you see
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 21:53:31 i dont know what angle lock is btw
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 21:54:08 i hvae like 96 hours of playtime
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 21:54:09 i ahvent
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 21:54:25 ok
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 21:54:33 also
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 21:54:43 how do you motorlock stuff to wings without it being exposed
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 21:54:49 or do you not place the motorlock over the wings
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 21:54:59 i.e a su 27
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 21:55:05 where you motorlock intakes to wings
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 21:55:38 ok so yeah
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 21:55:41 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 21:55:41 not place it over wings
help 2022-11-22 22:00:15 ok ill try that
help 2022-11-22 22:01:16 dont work
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 22:11:33 the plane can
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 22:11:39 (hence those propellors)
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 22:11:51 its pretty maneuverable
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 22:11:59 but keyboard controlled
creations-chat 2022-11-22 22:39:40 hey, the su 57 "felon" is farther along than the su 75 "misdemeanor" su 57not a full prototype either, it has serial models, i mean you cant use the fact that its a prototype as an excuse, when it has serial models. but i dont think that its just some haha trash plane either
creations-chat 2022-11-22 22:44:11 in all fairness too, you cant really say that the reason the production has slowed is because of sanctions, when the sanctions pre february 24 were somewhat modest, and its introduction was 2 years ago
creations-chat 2022-11-22 22:54:24 yeah, but that was because of software limitations preventing it from stressing airframe - build quality is a different story
creations-chat 2022-11-22 22:58:13 i suppose so, since both platforms still have upgrades prepared, but i think that part of the problem is the capacity to churn out the same quality as the usa (1/10 defense budget bc usa got those dollaridoos) also i just realized we arent really discussing posts in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 22:59:00 i really dont like how the half wedge down integrates to those half blocks
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 22:59:10 
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 22:59:17 no image perms
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 22:59:20 you need to be chat level 3

creations-chat 2022-11-22 23:11:31 lol its fine
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 23:13:57 easy for you to say
help 2022-11-22 23:17:43 i dont even know where to start on practicing to make an angle locked build
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 23:18:06 i know how to do it
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 23:18:07 but like
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 23:18:12 i dont know how to integrate it

plane-crazy 2022-11-22 23:30:34 no i found a way to do an f16 intake without it

plane-crazy 2022-11-22 23:37:55 you have no idea how tempting it is to search up an intake tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 23:38:04 bc im tired of these intake
plane-crazy 2022-11-22 23:55:45 > make plane, plane not good, do again

creations-chat 2022-11-22 23:56:34 his rank is literally just getting a score of 90 on a creation wdym lol
yeah, how can the rank be undeserved if what makes you deserving of the rank is a score of 90? if you think thats undeserved then its just your standards are too high, thats all
creations-chat 2022-11-22 23:59:08 it wasnt a problem with the f-35, its turning problems were on purpose. a g force limiter was put in place to prevent it from stressing the airframe since it was an early model. its not a problem of the early model
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:01:58 sorry ive never heard that before, can u tell me where u got from? not tryna be aggressive
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:28:17 maneuverability is important, but being able to do something like a cobra isnt since like cmon, are you really gonna use all your speed on one chance
creations-chat 2022-11-23 00:35:58 cobras are cool

plane-crazy 2022-11-24 02:08:02 since the ballast at lowest is better than normal block

plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:01:45 it sounds simple enough
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:01:48 
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:02:03 the placement of my motorlock tower
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:02:07 makes it annoying
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:02:20 look at the heigh

plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:06:13 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 03:06:41 hey i also used disconnectors for part of the intake extension
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 21:47:25 yesterday i was told to move back the intakes on my plane, here's an image of the plane before moving back the intakes
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 21:47:28 the problem is
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 21:47:31 that
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 21:47:40 ohhhh
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 21:47:42 nevermind
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 21:47:45 i dont need it
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 21:47:51 i just big dumb dumb
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 22:11:02 visible arm moment
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 22:11:08 
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:08:42 pov: you dont know how to properly organize a plane
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:09:59 theyre harder for me to use
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:10:03 but ill try
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:17:43 for some reason they sometimes break my motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:17:49 so im only using them on the nose
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:17:51 not on the intakes
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:22:37 are disconnected disconnectors lighter than trapdoors
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:24:53 so why do people want me to use them
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:27:50 cant you just color them
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:27:56 its noticeable
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:27:57 but like
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:36:39 i know
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:36:41 but like
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:36:45 the thing is
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:36:47 ion wanna use it
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:36:50 because it might not look good
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:36:57 but once painted it wont be too noticeable
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:38:19 i mean if youre doing a su 57 trapdoor wings are realistic
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:38:53 thats fair but still
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:39:00 it wont be **that** noticeable
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:39:55 thats like giving my home made omelette to michelin reviewers
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:40:18 crie
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:40:22 : - (
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:41:28 fine, i might do a variant with disconnectors
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:41:29 happy?
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:41:35 i will have two
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:43:58 its also a pvp jet
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:44:16 also how is it more hassle
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:44:22 wdym all the more reason
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:44:53 you have to disconnect the disconnector too
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:45:02 and i havent had any problems insofar as anchoring goes
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:45:16 closing the trapdoor is also 1 button
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:45:33 closing the trapdoor is 1 button
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:45:35 same with disconnector
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:45:37 ok but like
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:45:38 its a jet
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:45:41 what
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:45:49 are they gonna jump outta the plane and disconnect  them midair
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:45:58 i plan on adding them later
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:46:11 i dont think landing is needed in pvp
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:47:22 wdym answer the question
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:47:30 why are you asking the question
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:50:35 what
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:52:00 what
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:52:10 exposed motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:52:36 more exposed motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:54:11 eh, its not really too bad when you hold it down
plane-crazy 2022-11-24 23:54:48 why no hover engine for ranks but you can have conveyor?
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:01:08 hover drive
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:01:16 are conveyor drives complex
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:01:28 are hover drives complex?
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:01:37 so why no hover, but can have conveyor
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:01:55 specifically hover drives are banned of all kinds
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:05:34 what if you dont use them to hover
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:05:39 but just to move forward
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:05:56 ok
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:06:53 neutrogena
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:09:16 neutrogena brand disconnectors
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:32:41 well
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:32:44 my plane
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:32:48 was a complete failure
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:33:33 so is legacy good
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:34:31 ok
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:35:09 my planes motors were SO UNSTABLE that ANYTHING beyond a mere 100 speed made severely limited the movement of the motors
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:35:16 and it turned horribly
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:35:22 i didnt even finish it
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:35:29 but there is something so fundamentally wrong with the design
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 00:35:33 that it doesnt have a right to exist
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:05:22 bro
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:05:25 so you see
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:05:29 im trying to make an f-14
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:05:35 and due to a few limitations
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:05:40 i want it to be big
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:05:58 no, because i have no progress
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:06:00 the problem is
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:06:04 i suck at making noses
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:06:10 like
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:06:19 if i try to make a nose that isnt 1 block with half blocks on the sides in width
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:06:27 then
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:06:28 i just
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:06:29 dont
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:06:40 i have no idea how to make a good looking large nose
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:07:48 like i want it to be 3 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:07:52 or something like that
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:08:04 current progress
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:08:46 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:08:50 medium scale
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:08:54 im used to 2 block wide ones
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:09:21 should i just do a pyramid wedge and some 1x4 wedges?
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:09:32 idk but like
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:09:35 2 block wide
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:09:39 is way easier than 3 block wide
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:10:21 i dont
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:10:32 i cant make a good looking jet
plane-crazy 2022-11-25 01:10:33 at all

plane-crazy 2022-11-25 02:10:14 why use wedge when can use half wedge 2

plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:09:58 tutorials can help early game players to understand what to do since guides and tips videos are kinda scarce (and tutorials show how you can integrate the stuff into everything else) but theres a point where videos wont really help much
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:10:58 man if i ever get an expert rank
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:11:03 then im choosing my name color to be white
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:13:09 all imma say
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:15:32 i dont remember my first build
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:15:34 i deleted it
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:32:28 i love making intakes i love making intakes
help 2022-12-03 16:47:04 bro
help 2022-12-03 16:47:14 so im tryna figure out
help 2022-12-03 16:47:21 how i can cover up the bottom of my intake
help 2022-12-03 16:47:25 since part of it is exposed
help 2022-12-03 16:47:28 here are some pictures
help 2022-12-03 16:47:45 
help 2022-12-03 16:47:59 
help 2022-12-03 16:48:04 ik abt the exposed motorlock
help 2022-12-03 16:48:10 but itll prob be hidden inside fuselage
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 16:49:23 can someone help me out in <#478584971670454284>?
creations-chat 2022-12-03 16:51:46 ive never used angle lock, camera lock, or piston lock and now im trying to put real effort into an f14 and im soo excited to have to make a labyrinth just to get the wings working, because i have a terrible skill issue
help 2022-12-03 16:56:20 but its different for the top
help 2022-12-03 16:56:27 1 sec lemme show u
help 2022-12-03 16:56:54 see those trapdoors arent attached to half block
help 2022-12-03 16:57:04 but what im looking at for the bottom is different
help 2022-12-03 16:57:24 i cant attach anything to that wedge because theres no attachment point there
help 2022-12-03 16:57:37 i could try and circumvent it using some block to attach it, like a trail
help 2022-12-03 16:57:41 but the thing is
help 2022-12-03 16:57:43 if i use a trapdoor
help 2022-12-03 16:57:49 the trail cant reach it without touching half block
help 2022-12-03 16:57:55 wdym
help 2022-12-03 16:58:04 idk how else to make a 1.5x2 intake
help 2022-12-03 16:58:06 its not 1x2
help 2022-12-03 16:58:24 ik i couldve tried to half the half block wedge directly attach to the main wedge
help 2022-12-03 16:58:30 but that would create more motorlock problems
help 2022-12-03 16:58:44 so if i try and place a trapdoor there it touches the half block, thereby not covering up the whole thing
help 2022-12-03 16:58:49 and if i put a disconnector
help 2022-12-03 16:58:56 
help 2022-12-03 16:59:00 then it attaches to other disconnectors
help 2022-12-03 16:59:13 wait a minute
help 2022-12-03 16:59:18 i think i have the stupid
help 2022-12-03 16:59:56 what orientation
help 2022-12-03 17:00:11 
help 2022-12-03 17:00:21 
help 2022-12-03 17:00:46 but those touch the other half blocks on the side
help 2022-12-03 17:01:02 it broke the motorlock
help 2022-12-03 17:01:08 lemme show more images
help 2022-12-03 17:01:24 
help 2022-12-03 17:01:29 
help 2022-12-03 17:01:32 so the line of half blocks there
help 2022-12-03 17:01:42 its attached to those wing panels so that it covers up the intakes better
help 2022-12-03 17:01:50 yeah
help 2022-12-03 17:02:36 i think i might be able to
help 2022-12-03 17:02:43 replace the disconnectors on the bottom with trapdoors
help 2022-12-03 17:02:46 since that might give better clearance
help 2022-12-03 17:02:48 but im not sure
help 2022-12-03 17:06:46 an f14
help 2022-12-03 17:06:50 first plane im putting effort into
creations-chat 2022-12-03 21:22:36 my finally finished 1.5x2 intake, i hope i can hide that exposed motorlock inside fuselage
creations-chat 2022-12-03 21:26:02 excuse me i know its bad
fr tho i can probably hide the exposed motorlock since that is a left side intake
embarassed to say it took like 2 hours of playtime to make that
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 21:28:51 after like 2 hours of **r e s e a r c h & d e v e l o p m e n t**
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 21:28:58 this is the intake i have come up with
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 21:29:02 high quality
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 21:29:16 yeah im dumb bc idk how to make 1.5x2
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 21:29:24 since the intake isnt 1 wide
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 21:29:58 actually prob not 2 hours
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 21:30:02 prob closer to 1 but still
creations-chat 2022-12-03 21:30:11 pretty much but that small gap is ugly

also the way to fix it was painfully obvious i tried just about everything imaginable except for placing a half triangle wedge
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 21:31:34 
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 21:32:24 i have never made an angle lock build
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 21:32:29 im in the progress of making my first one
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 21:32:37 and im not looking forward to trying to make the swing wings
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 21:32:41 since i can barely make an intake
creations-chat 2022-12-03 21:34:34 stick a compass emoji in text on there or something
several compass emojis
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 21:35:03 it worked
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 21:36:13 close enough, maybe they
 can use 2 equal signs i suppose
creations-chat 2022-12-03 21:39:23 say what you will about the (unfinished) plane itself, but its an improvement over the 2nd image (last plane i made)
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 21:40:19 yeah i mean
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 21:40:23 its a minor detail
plane-crazy 2022-12-03 21:40:28 i didnt notice till you pointed it out
creations-chat 2022-12-03 23:10:31 i improved my weird f14 fuselage to have a more defined curve
creations-chat 2022-12-03 23:28:56 who did
creations-chat 2022-12-04 16:02:03 i should def raise the intake
creations-chat 2022-12-04 16:31:53 are the intakes too far back?
creations-chat 2022-12-04 16:50:44 alr ty
creations-chat 2022-12-05 22:59:41 might be the first build im not embarassed to say is mine (even though its not exactly... good)
creations-chat 2022-12-06 00:53:06 how make the intakes extend farther back (its not exposed motorlock just part of the motorlock isnt connected, ill connect it after this post) (note how the intakes dont go as far back as the fewselage)
creations-chat 2022-12-06 21:49:26 wow how did you learn to type considering that youre a bird?

amazing
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:54:58 you wont believe how long it took me to make this
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:55:14 half of it was me tryna make a 1.5x2 intake
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:55:19 and being picky abt the anglelocked spine
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:55:37 and the worst part
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:55:38 
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:56:12 like 6 i think
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:56:18 tomcat yeah
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:56:59 ah
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:56:59 especially since i wanted a precise intake size where it was only 0.5 blocks taller than it was wide
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:57:21 took me like half an hour just to cover up a certain part of the bottom of the intake
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:57:31 and i tried every solution except the correct one which was
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:57:38 to use a triangle wedge
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:57:40 oh
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:57:41 uh
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:57:46 1 sec lemme search up l-39
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:57:55 ok
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:58:20 ok
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:58:40 yep shapes can be a pain
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:59:17 well uh
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:59:26 i might try revising the attachment of the intakes
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 22:59:32 and maybe make the tail not horrendous
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 23:02:19 someone pls give me an idea for a 4th gen fighter to make
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 23:02:24 its gonna be pvp so im not showcasing it
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 23:02:41 why not
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 23:02:48 im too bad at anything other than jets
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 23:02:54 even though im already bad at jets
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 23:06:57 2 things
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 23:07:06 1. look at those intakes, im too unskilled
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 23:07:09 and 2.
plane-crazy 2022-12-06 23:07:12 not 4th gen
plane-crazy 2022-12-07 01:05:45 delta control surfacxe
creations-chat 2022-12-08 21:25:03 stolen creation (you didnt model)

\
creations-chat 2022-12-10 23:30:42 which f-14 angle is more accurate?ik both of them are big dumb
creations-chat 2022-12-10 23:33:31 i could maybe *dabble* in piston lock to kinda change it more finely but prob not


actually it would probably be pretty easy
creations-chat 2022-12-10 23:44:04 its more slanted? prob smthn to do with my terrible skill issue but uh hm ill try to fix it

do you really think i can decipher thaty ive never used blueprints
creations-chat 2022-12-10 23:49:27 shown here
ohhh you were  talking about the INTAKE i didnt realize
yeah i might try to work on that later by doing some more anglelocking because thats not inclined enough for 1x4 or 0.5*2 wedges and thats also a reason i extended motorlock tower
creations-chat 2022-12-10 23:54:53 btw wheres the source for those blueprints? i wanna look at those since they give more precise images than a 3d model
alr thanks
creations-chat 2022-12-11 00:00:37 i cant find em im on theblueprints .com
creations-chat 2022-12-11 00:49:43 would a half wedge down 1x2 be accurate enough for the intake of an f14
plane-crazy 2022-12-11 01:09:43 does it count as exposed motorlock if its inside the glass
creations-chat 2022-12-11 01:15:24 more anglelocking <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2022-12-11 01:18:17 starting to get a little annoyed with my poor design choices
creations-chat 2022-12-11 01:33:46 thanks
plane-crazy 2022-12-11 14:05:22 why doesnt anglelock work with motor 2
plane-crazy 2022-12-11 14:05:37 bc motor 2 doesnt have lock?
plane-crazy 2022-12-11 14:09:30 ok thanks
help 2022-12-11 14:40:31 how fix outlined bit

why



why
plane-crazy 2022-12-11 21:54:02 when you accidentally use the anglelocked motor
creations-chat 2022-12-13 00:19:29 added some more nose smoothing, now im gonna work on exhaust <:nooo:787097964946259978><:empty:794431705070174238>
help 2022-12-13 00:48:40 how do i do something like this https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/1051992071210291220
help 2022-12-13 01:37:16 wdym, like, do they move to clip inside there? if they can move while clipped in smthn, does that mean i can also use it for flaps?
help 2022-12-13 01:37:32 ok thanks
help 2022-12-14 21:55:23 i abandoned the build
help 2022-12-14 21:55:29 sorry for bother
help 2022-12-14 21:55:38 and sorry for ambiguity
creations-chat 2022-12-15 14:48:54 how do i cover the f14 wing sweep
creations-chat 2022-12-15 14:53:14 can i use pistons instead 
why
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:55:02 wait so
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:55:07 if pc2 has a scale tool
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:55:17 thatll mean that the scale will change the items hitbox and space in building
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:55:18 right
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:55:36 so while rickje is at it
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:55:54 wouldnt it be nice if he changed the hitboxes of stuff to more closely match the object
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:56:22 thats fair but like
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:56:28 it would also make future builds way better
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:57:34 yeah but it would remove a lot of limitations people would have
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:57:45 wdym dont recommend
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 14:58:04 ok
creations-chat 2022-12-15 14:59:15 why piston not good option
like piston lock
creations-chat 2022-12-15 15:02:25 piston lock
ok thanks
help 2022-12-15 15:04:59 is this the same as the bleed air door

help 2022-12-15 16:16:20 THX
help 2022-12-15 18:18:55 you could add pontoons but idk how easy that would be to add in
help 2022-12-15 18:19:07 maybe change the material on some blocks
help 2022-12-15 18:19:28 helium blocks maybe if you dont care abt the rank
help 2022-12-15 18:19:46 thrusters maybe if you dont care abt the rank
help 2022-12-15 18:19:58 the ease of adding it in rlly depends on the size

plane-crazy 2022-12-15 23:04:14 is wing panel thickness 0.25 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 23:05:26 no i think its thinner
plane-crazy 2022-12-15 23:05:34 maybe 0.1
help 2022-12-15 23:25:31 why was the motor not turning to full distance? it doesnt look like theres any contact
help 2022-12-15 23:28:13 yeah

help 2022-12-16 18:46:03 sorry if i bothered u but they responded
creations-chat 2022-12-16 20:10:34 i added dinghy little flaps

i mean spoilers

but they r a little glitchy so idk
creations-chat 2022-12-16 20:20:05 spoilers not lookin fire rn
creations-chat 2022-12-16 20:37:42 if youre talking abt the nose, the second (but i think thats just a few slight differences in anglelock) 
if youre talking abt length the first
creations-chat 2022-12-16 20:47:23 ill try to make a few configurations and post them
creations-chat 2022-12-16 23:44:15 (the one on the right looks worse than it would be bc it isnt properly angled but still) the left wing looks a little too long but like its just better
creations-chat 2022-12-16 23:51:35 sry for replying so much later is this better?

thanks
creations-chat 2022-12-17 00:04:53 what am i gonna do, put them on top? isnt it gonna be more noticeable?

i mean i could try clipping them inside the wing covers

wdym connect the wings with clear signs? cant i just use like cameras?

wait nvm the hitbox ill just use clear signs
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 00:15:33 new ace combat plane
creations-chat 2022-12-17 00:27:25 they dont work when clipped <:empty:794431705070174238>

hmm im gonna try something
creations-chat 2022-12-17 00:32:10 hold on i think that the reason they didnt work was bc of weird connectors

nevermind <:empty:794431705070174238>

nevermind again i think it was but i just didnt forget but instead DIDNT SEE THEM
creations-chat 2022-12-17 00:35:45 it worsk thank you
creations-chat 2022-12-17 00:40:02 hm sorry but i dont think i can clip the motor inside since the way i need to put the motor moves the motor too much and so when it rotates it kinda messes up the position of the wing (notice how with the one below the wing i can put the wing right beside it, but with the one clipped in, since it has to be at the same height, i need to do a weird thing with it to make it properly rotate
creations-chat 2022-12-17 00:43:29 the thing dont line up well and if i try to change the position of the wing itself to make it align when swept, then it gonna be messed up when straight

ill just put motor on top of wing and see if that work
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 00:50:32 can you use the same plane for both aero and vtol engineer?
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 00:50:50 ok ty
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 00:57:54 ty
creations-chat 2022-12-17 01:03:01 which one better
creations-chat 2022-12-17 01:06:19 i mean like which one is better, when clipped in or when on bottom? ill try doing the top but i dont think itll be more well hidden. who knows, maybe that'll change after adding vertical stabilizers, but i dont see how it will be more hidden on top? anyways also pls answer original, clipped or bottom
creations-chat 2022-12-17 01:11:04 oh the top as in the top image im so dumb sorry <@761354294859005962>
creations-chat 2022-12-17 01:13:48 once i finish my f14 im gonna upload the last plane i made to creations <:clueless:942802644043464734>

just something for future reference im going to try and put all exposed motorlock i make in hot pink so that its extremely noticeable
would that be cruel or funni?
creations-chat 2022-12-17 01:16:13 ik its actual hot garbage thats why
creations-chat 2022-12-17 02:27:29 because A. im bad (see last plane i made)

anyways imma go now since i went offline a bit ago
the-dump 2022-12-17 14:20:26 
creations-chat 2022-12-17 14:52:36 i followed the advice to clip in the motor and i added some horizontal stabs

i had to make some compromises abt wing thickness and placement of the wings when swept to hide the motors better]
creations-chat 2022-12-17 14:55:58 its better than it was before alright? not much of a standard to be held up to but its better nonetheless
creations-chat 2022-12-17 14:59:37 as in like, add exhausts? yeah the back is awful, the exhausts are especially hard for me so im saving those for last (intake is 1.5x2)
creations-chat 2022-12-17 15:11:17 believe me i tried changing sweep but i don’t want to cut more of the wing than i already have
creations-chat 2022-12-17 15:15:10 wdym by that? sorry i just dont understand 

also i think that the reason you see the sweep as not enough is how when swept the wings sorta align with the elevators using delta wing 1x1 (so youd think it swept 45 degrees) but the front of the wing is using 1x4 delta wings so the sweep would only rlly be around 3.75 degrees off the 60 degree sweep on real f14
help 2022-12-17 15:17:42 does the real f14 have all-moving vertical stabilizers? cuz if it does it'd make my life much eaasier
creations-chat 2022-12-17 15:25:17 you know what? i dont care about accuracy, im making all moving vtps for my f14 and thats that
creations-chat 2022-12-17 15:40:59 if im not willing to anglelock or camera lock, whats better for vertical stab, 1x1 or 1x2 delta?
ty
creations-chat 2022-12-17 15:43:39 hmm, if i use 1x2 ill have to make the vertical stabilizer very tall, 6 block tall, just so that it doesnt look way too short.

il prob test some stuff and decide

im goin with 1x1
creations-chat 2022-12-17 15:52:12 it flies
creations-chat 2022-12-17 16:08:35 and now i gotta spend a bit of time thinking abt how i can make an exhaust
help 2022-12-17 16:12:59 ok sorry to bother u but i already decided that im not going thru the trouble of doing proper stabs, im just doing all moving ones
also the roll kinda sucks since i gotta use tailerons and for some reason they super glitchy and dont reach intended angles 90% of the time so the all moving ones are my main source of turning, ailerons arent needed except for smaller corrections
plane-crazy 2022-12-17 16:15:30 i wonder if i can increase the speed that my f14 has to change wing sweep and use that to do a goofy cobra
creations-chat 2022-12-17 16:15:58 i think <#384025409945337856> bot broke
help 2022-12-17 16:16:31 ye but ion wanna do effort for pitch/yaw, for roll i might just do that

help 2022-12-17 16:20:58 alr tanks
help 2022-12-17 16:21:27 my motor 2's only work properly at speeds below 300 bc elevons and even then they arent perfect
help 2022-12-17 16:25:05 wdym having wing panels at the sides? like having them far out?
help 2022-12-17 16:25:42 ok ty since its variable sweep
creations-chat 2022-12-17 16:28:35 you mean my head?
t'was a stylistic choice, but it makes making good cockpits a little more difficult
only a little tho

creations-chat 2023-01-05 15:13:26 its not just abt doing the nose properly, if the nose is too detailed compared to the rest of the plane it just looks bad


i think that trail noses can look good but you should only use them if yk how to make the whole plane extremely detailed, if you just pick it up from a tutorial on noses then its gonna look bad because it just makes the rest of the plane look bad
creations-chat 2023-01-05 15:16:09 whats the point of these inner wedges, have you ever used them?

creations-chat 2023-04-17 20:42:02 maybe increase wingspan a bit?

thats fair uhh
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 20:43:06 maybe add some more detail or change the material on fuselage and intakes
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 20:43:10 just so that it looks less flat
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 20:43:28 when u look at overhead images
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 20:43:37 it looks kinda plasticy and off
plane-crazy 2023-04-17 20:43:49 so adding some roughness would make it look better
