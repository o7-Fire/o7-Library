plane-crazy 2021-11-19 20:14:50 the bus will have 8 wheels
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 20:15:12 heavily armored, bombing and flying bus
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 20:16:25 nvm, the bus is too long for 8 wheels
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 20:16:28 ill add more
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 20:16:56 too short
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 20:17:02 the wheels are 8 blocks apart
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 20:17:21 the first wheels, closest to the ends are 4 blocks away from the end
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 20:17:32 the rest of those wheels are 8 blocks away
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 20:18:09 12 wheels
plane-crazy 2021-11-19 20:18:29 ths tank with rlly long barrel

plane-crazy 2021-11-20 17:03:40 i just dont know how to make them turn
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 17:03:43 like left and right
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 17:04:30 i tried another set of motors before
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 17:04:34 and it didnt work
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 17:04:46 it just kept going forward
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 17:05:06 what abt for when turning tho
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 17:05:44 i just tried making one of those
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 17:05:50 it was awful
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 17:06:03 im trash at making things
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 17:06:08 and i cant get better
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 17:06:41 i might just make tutorial things
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 17:06:56 i cant make my own cus they always end up trash according to everyone here
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 17:07:34 i wanna show my attempt at the mig-31 but i dont have image perms on this acc
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 17:12:35 im gonna make my own plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 17:24:03 why are intakes so confusing to make
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 17:24:13 im making a custom fighter jet
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:32:56 idrk what to build rn
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:33:05 i want to make a vtol
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:33:07 but
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:33:45 im gonna make a small and super powerful jet
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:34:11 ok, but im going to
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:34:26 someone already made an f22, but ppl still make them
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:34:36 someone already made tanks, but ppl still make them
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:34:40 bro thats so low
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:53:41 i did it
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:53:51 no image perms
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:54:06 k ill have to make it again
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:54:18 i dont keep stupid builds like that
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:55:26 its so easy to slap like max super engines on a working jet
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:55:37 and put them in a way so it works
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:56:24 while testing it out i got bored and wanted to make a 34 Mitsubishi A6M for kamikaze
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:57:22 ik
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:57:39 i just built a regular small plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:57:58 i did nose and engines first
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:59:21 fast and small planes are so easy to make when u spent 90% of ur time on the game making joke planes for testing the game
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 18:59:31 like self testing
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 19:06:05 im not doing the small plane anymore
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 19:06:13 its just boring to re-make it
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 19:19:25 who needs a plane to fast
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 19:19:27 when u have
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 19:19:32 a giant dual fly swatter
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 19:21:15 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 19:21:22 i hit myself with my fly swatter
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 19:21:23 and
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 19:21:29 i went so fast, i noclipped
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 19:21:47 it hit me into someones build rlly fast and it noclipped
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 19:22:35 just went 3000 speed across the map
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 19:23:46 it can deflect a tank
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 19:25:46 MY BUILD IS UNSTOPABLE XD
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 19:25:57 like 3 cars drove into it
plane-crazy 2021-11-20 19:26:05 and they all just got sent flying
general 2021-11-20 20:29:08 i hope i can leave this server soon, cus in my case it would be good

plane-crazy 2021-11-21 11:50:33 guys
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 11:50:49 can i make things spin faster with more motors
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:05:49 my gian fly swatter now has 14 motors that spin it
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:06:01 it can now launch u to speeds up to 20k
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:06:04 and above
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:06:15 and once it has started spinning too
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:06:23 it cant be stopped
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:06:38 nothing can stop my giant fly swatter after it started spinning
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:07:01 nope
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:07:07 gun cant stop it
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:07:28 cutters cant either
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:07:32 and neither can blacklist
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:07:39 since its on my plot
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:07:55 it flings them
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:08:13 also, its basically just a frame
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:08:22 with several small holes in the middle
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:08:38 cant
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:08:41 no image perms
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:08:56 on this acc
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:09:26 its spinning clockwise, but its going so fast it looks like its going counter clockwise
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:09:46 only thing that can stop it is, me
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:09:49 well
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:09:51 thing it
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:09:52 is
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:10:00 its held up by anchor blocks
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:10:02 which
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:10:08 ocaisonally get flung
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:10:15 even tho they are anchored
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:10:21 theres 14 motors
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:10:24 going at full speed
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:10:46 what
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:10:53 i dont have image perms on this acc
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:11:12 the only acc i have image perms on is my main, which is currently dissabled
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:11:24 wait, nvm i got them
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:11:32 
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:11:35 i didnt think i had them
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:12:05 its funny
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:12:23 who needs big when u have stupid
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:12:34 14 motors
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:12:46 im stupid, but im not that stupid
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:12:58 ok
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:13:00 ill get more
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:13:16 motors came off 💀
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:14:39 
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:14:44 it uhh
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:14:50 does something
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:16:10 
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:16:11 it popped
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:16:32 i have flung lots of ppl
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:16:57 
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:17:06 flung that dude over there
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:17:09 when it popped
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:17:18 i should lower the amount of motors
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:18:09 what can i use, other than any type of engine, instead of motors
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:18:18 i tried engines, but it didnt work
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:18:27 it stops it from flinging things
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:21:25 ok
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:21:31 i think i found the limit
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:21:35 7 motors
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:22:45 cant add motorlock to a 2d fly swatter
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:25:07 ok
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:25:08 so
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:25:16 7 motors is the breaking limit
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:25:23 cant add any magnetsd
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:25:26 magnets*
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:25:28 or engines
plane-crazy 2021-11-21 12:51:18

plane-crazy 2021-11-22 15:14:35 wings shorter, look ugly
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 15:14:49 i cant use motorlock, cus it always ends up looking ugly
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 15:15:16 wait, nvm, im using some, those images are outdated
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 15:15:43

plane-crazy 2021-11-22 16:56:52 its suprisingly good at moving backwards and forwards
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 16:57:17 if it didnt have wheels on all 4 sides, it wouldnt work
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 16:57:27 cus the build spins while moving
plane-crazy 2021-11-22 16:57:36 i did

plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:03:35 ez
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:08:10 shredders are for losers
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:08:20 i prefer onplot flingers B)
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:08:35 cus then u cant fling anyone who doesnt want to be flung
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:08:41 and u only fling ppl who want to
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:08:50 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:08:54 i gotta do that
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:09:03 haha
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:11:43 ikr
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:12:24 the only problem i have with my non-movable flinger
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:12:30 is that it can break
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:12:49 cus it has 7 motors moving eachother at max speed and torque
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:12:52 it exploded
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:12:56 explodes*
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:13:01 sending the motors everywhere
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:13:07 and launching the main flinger
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:13:18 and if anyone gets hit by the motors after it explodes
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:13:22 they get launched
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:13:25 same with big builds
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:13:43 even anchor blocks arent safe
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:13:52 if i add any more than 7 motors
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:14:00 it can fling anchored anchor blocks
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:16:23 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:16:30 lemmie guess
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:16:34 lemme*
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:16:49 they flew a plane into it and set off the explosives
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:17:02 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:19:39 there is no such thing as a bad build
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:19:45 except shredders
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:19:52 and giant anime pictures
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:19:55 they
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:19:58 are bad builds
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:20:10 oh, and including the anime girl mechs
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:20:16 that simps build
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:20:31 i have seen them before
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:20:32 they are
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:20:34 just
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:20:41 i hate them
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:21:01 i hate them, more than anything in this constantly expanding universe
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:22:08 no
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:22:28 the only bad builds there are, are
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:22:34 shredders
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:22:37 anime pictures
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:22:42 anime girl mechs
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:22:46 server laggers
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:23:01 also
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:23:07 u was bad at building things once
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:23:29 quit acting like u started this game and was a god at building in nanoseconds
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:23:37 it took tike
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:23:39 time*
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:23:52 you dont get good at things within 1 build
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:23:56 or overnight
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:24:00 things take time
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:24:23 but if its an anime girl
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:24:46 it deserves to burn
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:24:55 i cant even make them
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:25:10 you dont get good at things instantly
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:25:14 it takes time
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:25:25 i never attempted
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:25:42 i havent even made a mech before
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:25:46 because i dont want to
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:25:55 i dont want to make a mech
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:26:09 i prefer to make planes and stuff
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:26:32 same
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:26:41 messing around is more fun than being good
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:27:22 who needs to be good at the game when u can make a giant fly swatter than flings ppl accross the map at 30k speed
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:27:28 and can fling things with 3k blocks
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:27:47 nah
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:28:16 making dumb things are more fun
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:28:34 thats the thing
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:28:35 u dont
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:28:49 u make stupid things, or u make good things
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:29:16 i have been playing since alpha
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:29:19 im not new
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:29:23 i just didnt play much
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:29:53 there are 2 types of builds
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:29:58 smart and good builds
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:30:03 and dumb and bad builds
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:30:08 u cant mix both
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:30:10 both*
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:30:21 2
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:30:27 they are both 1
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:30:32 smart and good is 1
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:31:15 just accept, there are no bad builds except shredders, server laggers, and other annoying builds
plane-crazy 2021-11-25 12:31:33 u cant be bad at a sandbox type game

plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:48:32 that was yesterday
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:48:35 i deleted the build
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:49:29 it is, its roscale after all, its absolute shit at standing
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:49:45 anyway

plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:52:38 the second one is good, but u cant really see it much, you cant see that much details either
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:53:18 mini ships are awesome when they are extremely detailed
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:53:31 it takes tons of effort to make mini builds that are rlly detailed
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:55:26 
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:55:58 lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 16:56:19 whats wrong about it?

plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:08:49 did it work
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:09:02 im gonna make it work properly
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:09:11 im gonna have it get flung and glide
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:09:17 but only have it 1 use, like irl
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:09:52 i have no idea
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:13:27 
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:13:32 
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:13:49 
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:14:02 time for control surfaces
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:15:32 
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:16:33 hm
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:16:45 the flinger works
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:17:21 hm
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:17:25 gliding is hard
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:17:43 AH
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:17:44 what if
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:18:03 i add a rlly weak engine, just enough to keep us in the air for gliding, but not enough to fly
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:18:43 hm
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:18:44 ok
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:18:47 that didnt work
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:19:16 THATS T
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:19:17 IT
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:20:16 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:22:25 when i make cannons, parts usually fly slower with wings
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:22:26 so
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:22:29 
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:22:48 BLOCKS
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:25:31 i did it
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:25:33 I DID IT
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:27:11 these props will be used when launching
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:27:15 to give it some lift
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:28:26 
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:30:06 <@701010664071888976>  I DID IT
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:30:10 HERE
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:30:22 no
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:30:34 working paper plane
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:30:40 that glides
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:30:57 nope
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:31:02 all blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:31:06 and half blocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:31:12 actually
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:31:15 look in the vid
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:31:30 it can fly alot longer, but it depends on the launch
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:32:06 if i use the front props that r used for launch lift, it can glide alot longer
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:32:11 it just lifts the nose up
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:33:46 this is how it glides without using lift props
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:34:07 this is how it glides when using lift props
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:35:28 nope
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:35:30 no helium
plane-crazy 2022-06-17 17:36:58 sure

plane-crazy 2022-08-12 20:36:28 shouldnt be too hard
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 20:38:16 
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 20:38:28 im using my lego set as my reference
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 20:40:49

plane-crazy 2022-08-12 20:55:23 this doesnt seem right
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 20:55:50 lol
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 20:56:35 stfu
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 20:56:43 if that was the case nobody would build anything
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 20:56:57 since building on this game takes messing up
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 20:57:03 and trying again
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 20:57:13 if everyone gave up after every mess up
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 20:57:19 then nobody would build anything
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 20:57:21 so stfu

plane-crazy 2022-08-12 21:25:45 hm
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 21:25:57 the stake cuts off to short
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 21:27:47 the worst part will be the back wheels
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 21:27:53 since they are longer than the front
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 21:28:03 and u dont get much space on the wings

plane-crazy 2022-08-12 21:40:19 LAUNCH IS HAPPENING
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 21:40:20 CYA
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 22:00:56 
plane-crazy 2022-08-12 22:07:34 its pretty good imo for a no motorlock shuttle
general 2022-08-12 22:08:05 artemis 1*
general 2022-08-12 22:08:15 sls is the rocket but artemis 1 is the mission
general 2022-08-12 22:08:26 and the name for the launch
general 2022-08-12 22:08:38 ots only a test launch
general 2022-08-12 22:08:50 the real launch wont be for another year or more
general 2022-08-12 22:09:14 it will  be going into space, past the moon and back to earth
general 2022-08-12 22:09:26 no
general 2022-08-12 22:09:36 few hours
general 2022-08-12 22:10:03 apollo 11 took less than a month
general 2022-08-12 22:10:55 it took a few days for a full moon landing
general 2022-08-12 22:11:01 this is litterally a passby
general 2022-08-12 22:11:19 artemis 1 wont even go into orbit
general 2022-08-12 22:11:26 it goes into earth orbit
general 2022-08-12 22:11:30 not moon orbit
general 2022-08-12 22:11:42 artemis 1 isnt a moon landing mission
general 2022-08-12 22:11:55 none of the artemis missions are
general 2022-08-12 22:12:11 not for 10 + years atleast
general 2022-08-12 22:12:41 the sls block 1 is designed to take a crew to flyby the moon
general 2022-08-12 22:13:09 to make the landing they need to construct the lunar gateway
general 2022-08-12 22:13:14 along with a lander
general 2022-08-12 22:13:34 ...
general 2022-08-12 22:13:42 r u fr?

general 2022-08-12 22:19:43 ceres thats ot
general 2022-08-12 22:19:58 i guess?

general 2022-08-12 22:20:36 it kinda does
general 2022-08-12 22:20:45 they arent connected in any way
general 2022-08-12 22:21:16 no

plane-crazy 2022-08-13 19:09:04 
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 19:31:14 i tried using motor 2 for my shuttle wheels but they just collapse when the shuttle touches the ground
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 19:39:20 
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 19:39:44 lol
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 19:41:57 what?
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 19:42:31 ohhhh
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 19:42:53 
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 19:44:10 
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 19:44:21 
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 19:44:30 they will only be used for roll
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 19:44:40 actually
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 19:44:46 i might be able to do pitch and roll
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 19:56:31 done
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 19:56:38 
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 19:56:56 
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 19:57:21 
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 19:57:51 i just made it how i do shuttles in ksp
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 19:58:01 cus i tried them both doing pitch and roll but
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 19:58:06 it was glitchy
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:01:45 added heat pannel
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:02:23 oh no
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:02:37 not enough space for everything
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:02:53 ill try and do a bit of folding
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:03:57 im making discovery
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:04:31 im doing a no motor lock build
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:09:15 
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:09:17 its challenging
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:10:17 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:10:28 if it was the challenger it would have been better
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:10:36 but its a completely different shuttle
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:12:08 u can see the shuttle isnt white
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:12:16 i added a sort of gray to it
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:12:20 it looks better
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:12:35 even tho the shuttles irl were white
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:14:49 why did i do only 1 wing
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:14:56 i should have done both at the same time
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:16:37 OMG NO
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:17:28 OK
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:17:29 SO
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:17:33 ill try folding
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:24:32 
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:29:08 damn
plane-crazy 2022-08-13 20:29:09 failed

plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:28:45 what is one of the least built planes in pc?
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:29:10 i wanna make smth but not something that is super popular and everyone makes like the f-4
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:29:34 that is one ugly plane
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:30:19 monke
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:31:46 ill probably make the guppy plane another day
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:32:02 i just want to make smth while im waiting for my mc server to come back online
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:33:39 imma make dreamchaser
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:33:54 i was making mig 105 but the angles are super weird
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:34:23 im just trying to do  a quick build
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:34:39 im only playing cus my mc server is broken rn and im waiting for support to get back to me
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:34:52 i made a paper plane glider
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:34:55 without motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:35:34 it uses engines to lift off, the engines then detatch and i have a system to point the nose upwards in a position that keeps it gliding forward
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:38:51 what kind, permanent, 1 week, a day?
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:39:28 it was a joke
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:42:12 anyone know how to make small missiles / bombs?
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:42:20 i want to add some onto my f-16
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:42:31 but a block would be too big
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:42:45 anything smaller than a block is what im going for
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:43:36 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:44:10 my f-16 is gonna have 2 eft's and 4 missiles
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:53:53 is there a round pyramid wedge sort of block?
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:53:57 im designing the eft
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:54:14 yes
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:54:20 oof
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 10:54:49 angle lock just for a small eft that gets detatched is a bit much tbh
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 11:52:13 im gonna make this
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 11:52:22 shouldnt be too hard
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 11:54:11 ok
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 11:55:35 roscale
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 11:55:48 i did make a working roscale car a while ago
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 11:56:08 ill make a working roscale plane r
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 11:56:09 q
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 11:58:16 
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 12:01:02 time to add bomb to roscale plane

plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:06:40 half wedge down 2
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:07:06 the next plane will probably be harder since ive not build much of it
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:07:39 
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:17:36 i tried making a car and a submarine
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:18:00 i was making a giant jeep
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:18:30 and this is the submarine i tried making
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:18:55 its not very good tbh
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:18:59 i was making a shuttle
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:19:21 
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:19:29 i had to go back cus i did it too big
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:21:52 here it is
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:22:45 energia im working on
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:24:25 lol
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:26:30 very old plane
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:26:46 this was when i discovered folding and custom wheels
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:27:36 red arrow
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:32:55 red arrow isnt rlly good when not in a group
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:40:41 
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 13:41:48 old rocket i made
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 14:08:25 sometimes my missile hits ad explodes but doesnt dmg builds
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 14:09:30 shredder moment
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 14:09:44 my missile can take of large chunks but sometimes it doesnt work
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 14:11:52 the missile is super sensetive

the-dump 2022-08-16 23:28:57 the idea of a joke is completely one sided
the-dump 2022-08-16 23:29:16 jokes are based on preferences and humor
the-dump 2022-08-16 23:29:27 meaning jokes are neither funny or unfunny

general 2022-08-30 13:19:22 they are the worst discord bots and servers that use them are among the most annoying
general 2022-08-30 13:19:35 cus u cant do anything in the servers cus of the bots
general 2022-08-30 13:19:39 no
general 2022-08-30 13:19:47 mee6 and dyno r both bad
general 2022-08-30 13:19:54 they litterally spam dm u for caps

general 2022-08-30 13:21:10 space engine is better
general 2022-08-30 13:21:33 its a game on steam, most realistic universe sandox engine there is
general 2022-08-30 13:21:55 its litterally an infinite universe full of real planets, galaxies, stars ECT
general 2022-08-30 13:22:08 nah
general 2022-08-30 13:22:17 good memes in the discord tbh
general 2022-08-30 13:22:30 the worldbox discord has top tier memes 90% of the time
general 2022-08-30 13:22:48 worldbox is sitll in early access tho
general 2022-08-30 13:23:07 sometimes, but when u got the ppl who send good memes on
general 2022-08-30 13:23:17 the higher ranked ppl in the server have better memes
general 2022-08-30 13:23:34 worldbox is still in early beta so u cant rlly complain abt it
general 2022-08-30 13:23:44 they r still developing updates
general 2022-08-30 13:24:17 medieval sandbox game where u create civilizations and explode them
general 2022-08-30 13:24:42 thats like saying SFS needs multiplayer lol
general 2022-08-30 13:25:03 its physically impossible
general 2022-08-30 13:25:12 they would need to rewrite the entire code for the game
general 2022-08-30 13:25:19 fun 2d space game
general 2022-08-30 13:25:39 also, complaining abt a new game that is still in early beta is quite sad tbh
general 2022-08-30 13:25:59 its litterally complaining abt an unfinished game
general 2022-08-30 13:26:19 yes, but its not finished
general 2022-08-30 13:26:25 it only just entered early beta
general 2022-08-30 13:26:36 like SFS has been out since 2015
general 2022-08-30 13:26:43 and thats still alpha development
general 2022-08-30 13:27:16 bruh
general 2022-08-30 13:27:18 r u fr??
general 2022-08-30 13:27:32 worldbox and SFS are both free on mobile with paid content
general 2022-08-30 13:27:47 but on pc sfs and worldbox are paid with all paid content built in
general 2022-08-30 13:28:01 both r very popular

general 2022-08-30 13:28:33 its £10 on steam
general 2022-08-30 13:28:51 tbh, atleast worlbox isnt as toxic as the SFS community
general 2022-08-30 13:29:02 the SFS community is more toxic than fortnite community
general 2022-08-30 13:29:29 never been to their discord clearly
general 2022-08-30 13:29:51 true
general 2022-08-30 13:30:09 no

plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:16:44 i can just put them all into the same bind, but make each one slightly faster than the other
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:16:50 so it moves more with a single click
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:18:01 but there is 5 of them
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:18:09 and if they all go the same, it wont work
plane-crazy 2023-01-21 12:18:22 and i hate it filling my entire numbers

plane-crazy 2023-01-22 17:02:41 
plane-crazy 2023-01-22 17:03:03 
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:15:26 hey guys i got an idea for a build, any of u guys wanna join in
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:15:29 im gonna ask an ai
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:15:40 to give me an ai generated image of a fighter jet
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:15:48 and whatever comes out, i try to make
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:15:52 anyone wanna do this too?
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:17:33 
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:17:36 time to make
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:17:59 i only need 1 side
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:18:08 i can guess what the other side looks like
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:18:29 now, i see no intake at the wings or underneath, so intake must be on the nose
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:19:37 looks like there is also a slight canard there
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:19:49 or whatever its called
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:19:54 the small wing on the nose
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:19:55 so
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:20:00 this will be a difficult build
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:22:36 gonna work on the nose
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:22:40 this will be dificult
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:23:00 cus while u can see it is kinda shaped like an f14, but it has a nose intake
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:23:36 so not only do i have to make the nose angled downwards, flat on the bottom and circular, i have to make the intake in the nose
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:24:10 or
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:24:10 the wing is kinda messed up, so ill have to make it how it shows
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:24:20 i can just "fix" it
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:24:59 u can see the wing is connected to the lower body, like a normal one, but there is a secondary one above it
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:25:08 now, i can make it exactly like that
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:25:09 or
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:25:26 i can give it some polishing
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:29:12 idk how im gonna do the nose intake
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:29:23 i can also just say it has another intake somewhere
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:29:29 dunno
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:29:30 plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:29:53 its a plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:29:55 idk what
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:30:19 its a mix of every russian jet made and an f14
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:30:37 ask the one who designed it
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:41:32 hmm
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:41:39 im gonna ssume where the intake is
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:41:45 im gonna assume its on the side
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:42:24 the side will be alot better than the nose
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:42:33 not talking abt u
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:42:39 this
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:42:42 my build
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:42:56 cant see the intake
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:43:02 so im gonna guess its on the side
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:43:21 didnt see that there
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:43:26 thats gonna be
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 15:43:30 fun....
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:05:24 what should i name the plane
plane-crazy 2023-01-23 16:05:27 this

plane-crazy 2023-03-02 16:20:39 bad gripen attempt
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 16:20:53 but its very noticable that its a gripen
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 16:21:11 if u cant tell the difference between gripen, eurofighter and rafale, u are stupid
plane-crazy 2023-03-02 16:22:12 gripen is square-ish and has intakes on the side, eurofighter is rounder but slightly square-ish with the intake on the bottom and rafale is smooth with intake towards the side and round intakes

plane-crazy 2023-04-06 17:36:53 mouse guided
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 17:36:57 but very hard to control
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 17:37:03 it cant turn properly
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 21:09:16 im gonna test missiles to make it as compact as possible cus the launcher itself is only 4 blocks wide
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 21:10:58 what are ways to close motorlock other than springs and explosives
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 21:11:07 cus i wanna build outside of pvp servers
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 21:11:35 and i dont want my vehicle to spasm and get sent outside the universe whenever i toggle the springs to close the motor lock
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 21:15:34 i tried that, but it didnt work
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 21:15:44 i need to keep it open
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 21:15:48 so i can angle
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 21:15:55 then close
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 21:16:03 i dont want to use springs cus of how buggy
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 21:16:27 they always get glitched inside blocks when i use them and launch me out the stratosphere at a speed of 100k
plane-crazy 2023-04-06 21:17:41 disconectors

plane-crazy 2023-04-06 21:50:10 imma make an me 262 instea
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 14:23:04 i give up on making an me262
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 14:23:10 i need to stop making new things
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 14:23:32 nearly every save i have is either an unfinished or outdated plane
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 14:23:48 im just gonna work on some of the unfinished planes
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 14:24:52 im gonna update this
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 14:24:54 my old f35
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 14:37:21 if i knew how to camera lock i'd use that but idk how
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 14:42:49 so i can mouse control, but its inverted
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 14:43:45 that didnt work
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 14:44:35 perfect, inverted the motors and i have mouse controlled pitch
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 14:44:42 now i gotta do the same with roll
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 14:51:21 hm these ones dont work for roll
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 14:52:34 control surface was blocking it
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 14:52:54 it works, but it works when i angle up and down tho
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 14:53:00 need to do this to the side
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 14:55:06 thats didnt work either
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 14:55:43 ig ill just use regular manual control for that
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 15:00:21 gonna test other stuff for my f35 like vtol and thrust vectoring angles
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 15:16:27 ofc it didnt work
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 15:19:51 engine
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 15:21:30 in winter
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 15:24:49 i wonder if this will work
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 15:25:21 no
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 15:25:29 i messed up on the placement
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 15:25:36 of the vectoring motors
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 15:27:42 
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 15:29:20 problem is the length
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 15:35:01 bruh
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 15:35:09 theres nothing i can do to fix i
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 15:35:18 cus 3 long is the smallest i can get
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 15:37:18 anyone got an f35 with thrust vectoring that can give me some help?
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 15:37:34 for now ill recreate my f16
plane-crazy 2023-04-07 15:39:22 actually ill do my mig 15 cus its older
general 2023-04-07 16:10:12 just found out mig 15's nato designation 💀
general 2023-04-07 16:14:44 look up the nato name for the an22
general 2023-04-07 16:14:51 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
general 2023-04-07 16:15:02 <:trollface:775024642104229898>

plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:43:39 making a train
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:49:27 the tip of the nose is a bit off
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:49:42 its heavily inspired by the LO series maglev
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:53:44 
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:54:57 ?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:55:02 who is the exploiter?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:56:46 
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:57:23 thats what im doing
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:57:44 im making a train heavily designed off of the LO series maglev
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:57:50 
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:57:54 fastest train in the world
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:58:03 im making it designed of that
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 18:58:07 but not a recreation
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:00:46 engines for the first part
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:01:35 the people on this train will be going so fast, they will time travel back to the release date of PC
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:03:03 it is stuck
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:03:11 forgot friction exists
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:05:12 not possible
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:05:15 way too far away
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:08:33 
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:08:54 after struggling to move on the track, it gave up and flew off
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:11:20 what material deals with train track friction the best?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:11:45 ok
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:13:01 
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:13:05 yes
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:13:44 now it cant move at all
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:13:57 i have an idea
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:13:59 MOTORS
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:14:00 HEHEH
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:14:41 i remove the row of engines on the edge and replace it with motors with wheels connected to smoothly drag it along the track
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:17:41 IT WORKS!!!
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:18:48 oh i figured the problem
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:18:52 the clamps
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:18:55 "clamps"
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:19:04 the parts i use to hide the wheels and keep this on the track
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:19:51 this is a problem now
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:19:58 it doesnt fully go on the rail
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:20:39 wing pannels
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:21:09 its extremely glitchy and cant turn
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:27:07 so yeah, it cant turn
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:27:57 ill remake the train
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:28:07 ill have to do a different design too
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:28:13 but for now, ill make a boat
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:28:23 should i make an aircraft carrier or a submarine?
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:28:39 so, giant aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:28:47 ok
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:29:47 im gonna base this on the HMS queen elizabeth
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:29:53 cus ive seen that in person
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:30:24 its huge
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:32:41 nice
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:33:02 this is what i saw
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:33:30 it didnt have any planes on it tho
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:33:34 i think it was just docked up
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:33:41 or they were doing smth with it
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:33:46 it wasnt at a show
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:33:53 it was just at a dock
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:34:26 i also saw the XO1
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:34:50 
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:35:01 and a destroyer
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:35:03 tho
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:35:03 idk what one

plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:35:58 looked like this
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:36:10 but thats what all UK destroyers look like
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:36:52 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:37:07 they r huge
plane-crazy 2023-04-08 19:39:12 what boat r u making?

general 2023-04-12 19:18:45 surprised im alive ngl
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 13:38:14 is it possible to use explosive blocks to propel explosive blocks?
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 13:38:28 wait
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 13:38:35 i think i know how
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 13:39:18 im gonna work on a working gun
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 13:39:42 idk if i should make bullets that explode of bullets with shredder blocks
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 13:46:45 gonna make an SA80
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 13:46:50 ill make it function properly too
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 13:46:58 jamming every 5 rounds
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 13:47:17 having to foward assist every shot
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 13:54:59 cus
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 13:55:00 BANG
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 13:55:09 they dont use magnets IRL
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 13:55:13 do they?
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 13:55:19 they use gunpowder
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 13:57:41 hm
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 13:57:43 yes
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:03:45 
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:04:40 
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:04:47 main barrel part done
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:04:51 gonna do the muzzle
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:04:53 then handguard
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:06:40 inside of the barrel
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:12:37 
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:12:51 ?
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:13:10 imagine having automatic breathing
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:13:16 manual breathing on top
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:13:27 🔛 🔝
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:15:17 bullet
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:15:27 front is a cutter
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:15:31 back has 1 magnet
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:15:46 5.56X45mm
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:15:54 im making an SA80
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:16:07 slightly large SA80
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:16:11 no
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:16:20 im making an SA80 that is slightly larger than real size
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:16:56 what do i set it to
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:19:59 bullet in the chamber
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:20:09 ok
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:20:18 uh turns out the bullet doesnt move
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:20:21 the gun does
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:21:21 yeahhhh
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:22:35 
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:23:16 #
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:23:18 bullet now works
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:23:21 its just very
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:23:33 **patheticaly weak**
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:24:36 i know
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:25:16 temporary modifications
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:25:51 until i can get these fed through a magazine into the chamber
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:25:56 ill keep it like this
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:27:59 this surprisingly doesnt work
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:28:42 guns seem
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:28:44 boring
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:28:45 but
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:28:53 very
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:28:56 fun
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:28:57 cus
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:29:01 i can make it mag fed
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:29:06 ill work on that
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:29:59 mag fed
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:30:00 better
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:30:09 cus more difficult to make
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:31:19 
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:36:04 bullet
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:38:20 
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:40:41 mag
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:40:52 for an SA80
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:41:43 i have the springs to max, ill have those activated then when one bullet goes in, it holds the rest, the bullet will fire, casing thrown out of the moving parts and new bullet in
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:41:55 
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:42:08 just gotta figure out how to fire bullets
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:42:54 rn im just making the test
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:42:57 on how it would work
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:43:00 not the actual thing
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:43:36 a fun thing to do
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:43:56 if i can get the bullet feed to work, anything is possible
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:44:41 feed is working so far
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:44:57 smallest i can make
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:45:01 and still have it work
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:45:38 nice
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:45:40 do they work?
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:45:51 ah
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:45:58 oh yeah
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:46:19 just realised, didnt even make it accurate to the bullet im making
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:48:29 not creative at all
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:48:30 plus
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:48:41 SA80 doesnt use explosive bullets
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:48:57 oh well
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:48:59 cutter
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:49:03 will cut the build
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:49:09 and hopefully cut through
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:49:12 with enough speed
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:49:19 oh well
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 14:49:22 more creative
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 15:04:04 yk what
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 15:04:10 a mag fed is too difficult rn
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 15:04:14 ill do clip
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 15:04:22 what gun should i make?
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 15:06:24 clip fed rifle
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 15:06:28 not magazine fed
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 15:06:33 cus mags r too dificult atm
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 15:12:42 ah
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 15:12:50 what guns do that?
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 15:13:09 wait
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 15:13:10 PISTOL
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 15:13:12 simple
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 15:13:15 pistols are small
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 15:13:20 therefore simple
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 15:13:30 ill make a glock 18
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 15:14:06 ill make that later
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 15:16:47 yeah
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 15:16:50 thats probably a no
plane-crazy 2023-04-19 15:16:56 ill stick with a pistol for now
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 15:42:54 wanna play pc but dayZ must consume my time
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 15:43:00 so therefore i cannot play pc
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 16:29:41 mosin wip
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 16:30:39 balls
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 16:32:02 hole so bullet can go through
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 16:37:00 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 16:44:55 doesnt fall apart
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 16:45:08 id call that a success so far
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 16:50:21 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 16:53:53 the easiest part is gonna be the design
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 16:54:01 hardest is def gonna be the mechanisms and function
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 16:54:53 yes
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 16:55:05 im gonna make it 100% functional
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 16:55:09 including bullets

plane-crazy 2023-04-21 16:57:37 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:02:24

plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:10:25 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:11:46 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:12:47 sights
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:19:22 the bullets can fire
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:19:26 but very slowly
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:19:27 damn
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:21:02 i was
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:21:09 but it just rolled out
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:21:30 it lost all its momentum in the barrel
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:22:12 idk where i can put them
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:22:17 cus its onlt a 1x1 hol
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:22:23 unless
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:22:36 it has some space on the inside for a decent part
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:22:55 i can have it drop down, magnet push it up a wedge 1x2
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:23:10 will they work?
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:24:52 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:24:58 that could work maybe?
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:25:47 imma test
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:28:24 it works
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:28:26 amazingly well
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:28:42 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:34:41 gonna use paint blocks to make it look nice
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:34:49 make the barrel look realistic
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:38:20 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:42:38 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:42:58 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:43:20 gonna work on the rest now
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:43:24 gotta fold
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:47:32 folding
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 17:55:02 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 18:04:47 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 18:11:49 
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 18:19:13 barel
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 18:27:38 sure
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 18:27:42 i tried one
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 18:27:46 they sure arent easy
plane-crazy 2023-04-21 18:27:52 
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:01:09 cool gun inside barrel function
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:01:15 to propell the bullets further
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:01:48 green = magnet blue = block and wedge 1x2
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:02:27 
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:02:37 magnet setting
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:03:10 the wedges are there incase the bullet gets stuck
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:03:21 the keybinds can be set for whatever
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:03:31 backwards will be to propell the bullet forward
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:03:43 forward u would want to set to smth u dont use
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:05:34 loading a bullet directly into there will not work
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:05:43 it will just jam
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:06:07 u would want some parts and a magnet behind where it gets loaded
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:06:23 1 block per block of the bullet and 1 extra infront
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:07:16 should look similar to this
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:07:30 before starting the row that i showed previousely
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:07:50 the bullet should be fed in if u want it to work
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:07:56 building it inside wont work
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:08:06 u can feed it in through a mag, dropping ect
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:08:20 it has to be a loose part
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:36:14 hear me out on that left build
plane-crazy 2023-04-22 10:36:49 lol

plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:20:53 wip bolt test for my mosin
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:21:31 got a looong time for that
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:21:43 im making it fully functional
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:22:51 im making everything functional lol
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:23:17 working bolt system, casing ejection, round firing ect
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:24:30 the bolt can push the round and feed it into the chamber, but it cant pull yet
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:24:45 maybe i make a magnet or smth
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:26:46 it worked
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:27:42 
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:29:30 now i need a way to eject
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:30:35 done it
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:32:45 
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:32:50 ejection
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:34:20 prob gonna redo my mosin
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:34:33 the design was good, but functionality was not
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:34:43 and ill have to completely remake it
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:52:22 i made it fire, but it fires the entire round
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:52:40 i need a way to make it fire the bullet, keep the casing connected to the bolt and the eject the casing
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:52:50 which means i will have to make an entire custom case
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:52:52 bullet
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:52:55 and redo it all
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:57:11 custom shell
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:58:30 blank
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 15:58:43 
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 16:01:58 
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 16:02:48 might just stick with the stick
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 16:03:59 realistic internal
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 16:04:37 vs what it will actually be
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 16:07:13 tracer
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 16:08:52 full round
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 16:13:23 
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 16:19:12 wip bolt
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 16:22:07 closed the bolt
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 16:22:23 YESS
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 16:22:28 the ejection works with the bolt
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 16:34:13 
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 16:34:27 
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 16:50:11 bolt 100%
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 16:50:21 need to build the gun around it
plane-crazy 2023-06-07 17:03:05 making the body
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:11:30 anyone got an idea of what i can do for reloading for my guns
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:11:39 i tried springs, they didnt work
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:11:50 and i tried magnets, but that just makes the build fly
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:17:59 oh
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:18:01 thats a thing?
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:18:23 idk if i have ever used one before
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:18:47 oh yes i have nvm
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:18:53 i just rarely use them
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:19:50 bruh
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:20:03 i tested one out and it wiped over my mag test autosave
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:30:12 we need pyramid wedges with round bases
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:30:19 that should be a thing in pc2
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:37:36 yes
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:37:41 forgot the word
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:37:59 i wanna make bullets, but its annoying cus they either blunt or ugly
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:44:57 AX-50 mag
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:45:16 might need to do a couple changes
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:47:23 smooth
plane-crazy 2023-06-16 15:48:55 3 rounds
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 10:41:37 making a gun is so hard oml
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 10:41:45 the mechanics r so annoying to do
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 10:41:51 they r so simple yet annoying
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 10:49:40 working on an AX50
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 10:50:40 extended the mag
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 10:52:58 i wish shredders could have worked as bullets
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 10:53:05 cutters*
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 10:57:09 
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 11:02:19 fun
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 11:02:50 
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 11:06:27 done the grip
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 11:06:31 gonna do stock now
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 11:36:16 bolt
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 11:38:05 
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 11:42:43 
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 11:42:51 not yet, still making that part
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 12:05:25 it fires
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 12:05:30 the gun fires
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 12:40:58 
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 12:41:05 bolt complete
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 12:41:14 hardest part is done
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 12:41:22 the reloading and ejection mechanism
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 12:52:33 i dont
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 12:52:44 i just eject the full bullet
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 12:52:51 mainly for if it jams
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 12:53:28 seperating the bullet like that is impossible
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 13:14:46 
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 13:20:25 
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 13:31:59 started the stock and made the cheekrest but it seems a bit off
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 13:32:09 gonna move it forward
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 13:33:59 no
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 13:37:22 
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 13:56:10 magnet engine
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 14:14:46 
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 14:21:55 
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 14:23:17 all rounds used
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 14:24:06 nah, i got full rounds
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 14:24:16 i got a mag with 3 rounds inside
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 14:24:34 i can turn it into an air / airsoft rifle and replace each round with some explosive balls
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 14:34:18 
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 14:34:23 nearly done
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 14:58:14 ITS DONE
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 14:58:23 1036 PARTS
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 14:59:10 
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:05:33 i think it jammed
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:05:42 magnets and conveyors
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:11:28 oh yeah
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:11:37 i had a bad picture, couldnt see the full angle
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:13:38 
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:13:48 
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:14:01 i used a different thing for the mag
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:26:20 this thing shoots strong
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:26:21 damn
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:31:13 i tried making it pvp capable
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:31:30 all the rounds exploded in the mag during loading
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:31:58 it crashed my game too
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:32:05 lmao
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:34:32 to load 1 ball at a time
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:35:30 got a 1x4 wedge for smooth loading
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:37:08 the firing mechanism is so strong, it moves the gun
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:37:22 pretty much reverse recoil
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:37:28 it goes forward instead of backwards
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:37:50 it reaches 12 speed when firish
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 15:37:56 the bullets r rlly accurate too
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 16:30:04 what gun should i make next?
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 16:30:17 ill stay with bolt / semi for now
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 16:30:21 oo
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 16:30:22 ok
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 16:30:23 ill do that
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 16:30:29 it will be a good challenge
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 16:30:37 completely different to the AX-50
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 16:31:32 ill need to find a new way for reloading
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 16:31:44 cus the previous one could only hold 2 rounds
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 16:31:52 this one gotta hold 7
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 16:57:55 lol
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 16:59:27 i was a warthunder addict
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 16:59:35 and just decided to use it
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 17:00:07 these will be the rounds
plane-crazy 2023-06-17 17:08:57 gonna be one chunky 1911
