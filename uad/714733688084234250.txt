help 2020-12-03 20:07:26 <@456226577798135808> i think dampening on suspension is the rate kinda that is holds? like high dampening, it will bounce smoothly and larger, and little dampening will be tight and stiffer.. idk for real, im not a physics expert but that's what i think it is from in game experience
creations-chat 2020-12-04 14:29:01 <@!352780509249667075> there are multiple ways to make a smooth helicopter, one of the simpler ones is: 1, instead of being powered by motors, used one propeller attached with an unpowered motor, and put super rockets engines on the blades. Use motors to rotate the blades like regular
creations-chat 2020-12-08 15:50:23 i used regular jet engines so they were a perfect circle, and they are partially custom
creations-chat 2020-12-08 15:53:48 bonk
creations-chat 2020-12-08 15:55:49 <@!347918144062488586> wait you can do that??
creations-chat 2020-12-09 00:03:37 no i just dicided to keep is blocky bc i liked how it looked
creations-chat 2020-12-09 18:34:40 <@!680035569023451146> you use locked motors, and use motors to make the same 4 way point rotate, the more you have the smoother the nose, and the bigger the more you need to have, and remember to have the motor used to rotate locked too or else it will be glitchy
creations-chat 2020-12-09 18:37:36 <@!680035569023451146> do not ue motor 2, use regular motor to move the points, and on the regular motor, have the lock option on, after, set all the differnt points to .25 multiples(0.25,0.5,0.75,1,1.25,etc..) and mess around with rotating it untill you get a smooth nose
creations-chat 2020-12-09 18:43:29 this is how i lock with disconnectors, but it doesnt stop locking all the way, but mostly
creations-chat 2020-12-09 18:47:54 im not a halo guy but to be fully honest, 3-4/10  (10 being HOF worthy)
