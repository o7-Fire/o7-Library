plane-crazy 2022-07-19 22:42:13 anyone know why whenever i build something (aircraft carrier) and i build a plane to fly, the plane directions are reversed, and when i reverse it, it still wont work
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 22:44:12 how tf does someone get suggestions blacklisted
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 22:44:18 must have been some bad suggestions
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 22:50:57 i can get a video if anyone wants to see
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 22:56:34 no i use my mouse
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 22:56:48 why
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 22:56:56 wait a minute
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 22:56:59 i dont think i r ead that right
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 22:57:04 i nevermind i did
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 22:57:50 you know if theres a way to fix it?
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 22:57:58 i've seen people use planes with carriers
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 22:58:01 but im not sure how they did it
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 22:58:36 when i use keys all of my control panels are swapped and stuff
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 22:58:40 like 3 of them go the right way
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 22:58:44 and 2 go the other way
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 22:59:04 when i change them random ones go the other way
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 22:59:12 what if i just build my plane where the yellow thing is
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 22:59:15 maybe it'll work
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 22:59:25 it took him 10 minutes to send
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:00:36 actually wait
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:00:45 <@580743934171676672> my plane has a blue centre of gravity
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:00:58 what does that mean
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:02:15 true
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:02:27 i wish you could create two centres of gravity
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:03:07 yes
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:03:11 i had to change every control
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:03:39 every video i search about for my topic is just random plane crazy videos
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:03:43 not even answering my question
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:04:06 how to have two centres of gravity
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:04:34 how do i add a plane to my aircraft carrier then
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:04:38 if i cant its just a human carrier
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:05:10 literally any size plane
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:05:15 anytime i try to do it
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:05:26 my plane has weird controls
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:05:40 its because my centre of gravity is not where the blue dot is
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:06:18 i know
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:09:10 <@580743934171676672> last ping because you fixed it, truly you're a genius
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:35:30 ive now generated a new problem
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:35:33 so the plane works flawlessly
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:35:42 but when i save and respawn the plane and aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2022-07-19 23:35:46 the plane breaks
