plane-crazy 2021-11-13 22:07:59 bhug report channel is useless then
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 22:08:09 any bug i have experienced
plane-crazy 2021-11-13 22:08:17 must have been experienced by everyone else
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:46:55 sooooo i was in plane crazy right
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:47:02 and i was in pvp mode
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:47:17 and i added a explosive block to my plane
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:47:23 then it exploded
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:47:44 and my cockpit has now been turned into a simulated version of a gun shooting a bullet
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:47:55 my cockpit is the bullet
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:48:24 
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:48:40 we are still accelerating
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:48:52 bout to hit 40k
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:49:22 the immesive speed has left my roblox avatr completely unreconizasble
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:49:31 he has turned into simple polygons
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:49:51 
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:50:03 this stimulateswhat will happen if we go too fast
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:50:44 bout to hit 50k
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:51:16 when we hit close to the speed we are feeling right now in this plane crazy esperiemnt
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:51:25 we reach close to the speed of light
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:51:41 /the light cannot keep up with us and we would appear to simply melt away
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:52:27 in a world such as this chaotic meyhem of building blocks
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:52:37 /i am trapped in a endless void above me
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:52:44 the void below me kills me
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:53:13 /i take refuge on this simple small island unkowing by science itself to be completely still midair in this world
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:53:26 the attempt i create is to escape this simulation
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:53:45 i increase my speed of my plane so much that i reach enough speed to finally be free
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:54:01 my avatr is nothing but a person byu the srtirngs of my creator
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:54:04 he is alive
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:54:11 and he will be free soon
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:54:17 btw 69k coming up
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:54:45 
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:55:07 my avatar has been a slave to thbis game and to everything i put him through
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:55:30 he only has control over himself when he is left in the black nothingness when i exit the computer
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:55:51 he takes this opportunity to finall ybe free of my grasp
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:56:10 to escape the endless world above may be impossible
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:56:30 but with enough speed may he might suceed in freeing himself
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:56:46 he experiences nothing like he has before
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:57:13 his body is put through 80,000mph of pure thrust upwards
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:58:01 however because he is strapped to the seat he stands completely still which makes forces coutner act each outher causing him to glitch himself oiut
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:58:37 once used to be a 3d avatar now only simple 2d flat edges flattened from the immense power
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:59:19 Im narrating the lore of how my avatar is a real person and how hes going to escape the simulaotr of plane crazy by accelerating to light speed
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 00:59:53 basically my plane exploded turning the cockpit into a bullet
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:00:02 and now its shooting up in the air
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:00:31 continuing to accelerate
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:00:41 btw we just hit 100000 speed
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:00:56 
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:01:12 this is what it used to look like at a slower but fast speed
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:01:19 
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:01:45 we are
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:01:52 107k
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:01:54 rn
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:02:51 will the game crash and the plane accelerating still to break the wall holding him in the disconneted game finally free to break out of a roblox server room where is a pure speck to the workers  there
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:03:11 they dont notice him and everything is new to him
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:03:39 the cockpit crashed into the toip of the ceiling but due to the small size the kenetic force wasnt enough top casue any damage
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:04:17 and due to the nature of no physics pertaining the physical limits of of avatar he is left comepletely unscathed by the impact
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:04:45 the cockpit lodges itself into the ceiling for him to get a birdeye view of his surroundings
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:04:54 12k rn
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:05:02 no lag or anything just speed
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:05:24 oh his body just morphed into the cockpit
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:05:34 he has been morphed into the bullet
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:05:39 huh thats new
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:05:48 i guess that can be part of the lore
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:05:57 anyways backj to the story
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:06:47 he jumps down from the cockpit thats lodged into the ceiling and hits the floor his small size and his resistance to damage from falling from heights doest affect him
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:07:04 there a giant computers around him appearing like rows of skyuscrapers
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:07:14 he is not new to anomolys
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:07:32 since he has experienced many weird things in his time in roblox games
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:08:23 he runs through the entire server room and find the exit due to his experience from exiting places likely from his experience playing jailbreak
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:08:44 his time spent being a slave to me seems to payoff in his experience with new situations
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:08:54 150k speed rn
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:09:43 as he makes his escape out of the server room by going under the slit of a door the  he enters the office
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:10:28 the flash doesnt run and the more he runs the faster he gets the flash doesnt do that but he?, the roblox avatar of mine, he can
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:11:46 He enters the office to see workers typing on computers. They look very strange like him but more fleshed out and higher definition
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:11:52 their mouths move aswell
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:11:55 they can blink
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:12:13 this confuses the roblox avatar
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:12:46 he is used to many things but the utter sight of something so horrid and beautiful makes him very shocked
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:12:50 yes
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:13:06 he gazes at these creatures mountains high
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:13:35 the sight he cannot look away
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:13:42 he begins to think
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:13:57 he has completely forgot about running away or living his life free
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:14:46 the curiosity he holds within himself seems more distracting than his orginal goals
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:15:37 meanwhile I come back to my computer after a long day ready to hop on plane crazy i load into a server when i notice my character is not there
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:15:58 i assume another glitch so i try to move around and do random stuff until he reappears
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:16:04 nothing
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:16:31 iots not even as if hes invisible and i can move around but not see him i cant move at all
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:16:51 i can pan my cursor around but i do not move
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:17:15 slightly frustrated i decide to reload the game
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:17:18 same results
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:17:32 i decide to try it on my other computer
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:17:35 no dice
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:17:50 i eventually give up and decide on something else
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:18:09 i turn off my computer in the hjopes that when i come back it might fix itself
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:18:25 i begin to ponder if the roblox shut downs have anythning to do with this
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:18:41 --"foreshadowing"--
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:19:10 back to our avatar he keeps staring almost dead in stare
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:19:35 all the employees then get up and breaks himself out of his daydreaming
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:21:00 there is a announcement to all tyhe employees to come to the metting room the avatar can understand english so he follows them oput of curiosity since he wants to see if anything else is different in this strangely similar world
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:21:48 he enters into the room and sees two big men dressed in suits
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:22:41 these men are dressed like him so he wonders if they are like him since all the employess looked different from him in clothing he hopes he will get something different from these men
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:23:16 btw 220000 speed rn
plane-crazy 2021-11-14 01:23:32 the cockpit and his head has morphed together

plane-crazy 2021-12-15 13:50:55 The Eye of Cthulhu has two phases, and is able to fly through blocks in both of them. During the first, it attempts to float directly above the player, while spawning 3‚Äì4 Servant of CthulhuServants of Cthulhu, which drop Hearts and Stars on death. A servant is spawned with the typical hit sound . Afterward, it charges at the player three times in succession, before repeating the cycle.

When the Eye of Cthulhu falls below 50% / 65% health (1,400 / 2,366 / 3,016), it transforms into its second form (shedding its iris into a mouth), which rams the player more aggressively three times, then hangs in the air for a period. It no longer spawns Servants of Cthulhu, and has no defense, but now has increased contact damage. It now lets out a roar every time it charges.

In Expert Mode, the boss spawns more Servants of Cthulhu than normal, as well as 4‚Äì5 servants upon transforming. In the second phase, it will gain an additional powerful rapid chain dash attack, during which it lets out a higher-pitched roar every time it dashes. These dashes become faster as the Eye of Cthulhu's life decreases, and it can dash nearly continuously when close to death.

If the Eye of Cthulhu is not defeated by dawn (4:30 AM), if all players die, or if the Eye of Cthulhu goes too far off-screen, it will despawn.

help 2022-01-01 14:50:21 2x4 whatever do you know how i could do it?
creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:16:09 First off, I removed It, secondly understand that some people will downvote things and you don't have to interrogate everyone who downvotes your build because you perfect no downvotes score got ruined by someone. I just thought for a moment that the build just looked bad
creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:28:21 Let me just get this off my chest for now. No matter how much effort you put into something all that matters is it was worth the effort and that the person who views it likes it. It doesnt matter if someone put a ton of elbow grease into something of theirs. As long as the build turns out to be worthy of my approval and recognition I upvote it. I tend to upvote a lot of things but what I don't appreciate is when people become entitled to upvotes. Just because it took a person a lot of time to make something doesn't earn my approval. Honestly I can say that this discord is a prime example of what I want to see in all types of voting systems for all things. People here upvote harshly and crap builds will be downvoted. Some people have switched to a more positive way of criticism where even if someone makes something terrible they will applaud it. I think it's better for people to understand that in order to be given appreciation for things they need to show exceptional skill in that area. I kind of missed my time to reply to this but I wanted to make sure I said everything correctly.
creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:31:28 I mean, as much as I would love to tell people what I want to see improvements in people's build that I upvote and that I downvote Theres like 100 builds I upvote and downvote so I can't respond to everyone. Everyone see things as good or bad differently and for me, I couldn't reasonable give any feedback because when I do, it seems that people will begin to explain what I say is wrong so choose not to do it.
creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:34:24 What I will say is reasons that I downvote are lack of detail lack of paint low effort (not including meme builds) or ugly design
creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:37:01 If you use cheese-graters to fly for pvp or general ease of flying with cursor you could motor lock regular wings so you cant see the gaps
creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:39:20 No, that was from my C-130, A mod said the banana was too low effort for my when I posted the build for a expert status
creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:42:18 So your build isn't meshing colors too well. From what I can see, there is not rotating top to the tank and In General about the colors- they are ugly looking. Maybe take a picture of the camo and place it near the screen so you can visualize what the color looks like up close so your two eyes can point out what is too vibrant or too dark or whatever. I think a build at this size needs some motor lock detail or else it looks low effort.
creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:45:02 what I mean by that is that the colors dont mix, Black and yellow look good together, White and a deep brown look good together for a modern design. You should make sure the colors look like they fit together
creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:47:38 The reddish pick color maybe change that and make the colors a bit darker with a more ruddy but vibrant yellow brown. and for the green maybe a more brown green works better like a muddy green. Basically a browner green and a more desert browner yellow and fix the reddish pink to something else idk
creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:49:47 Just make the colors darker. Can you show me the camo you used
creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:53:58 Hey just a quick though to ask. What do you guys think about modded tutorials. I am not talking about a different paint job or an edited small portion. I am talking about the shell of the tutorial but almost every part of it has been changed where the tutorial bit is recognized but everything about it is almost different. For example lets say I took a 13 black plus a380 and make the interior my way changed the engines, rudder, elevators, flaps, landing gears, gear doors, doors maybe some motor lock. What would you say about this?
creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:56:16 Did you read the whole thing I am asking about a tutorial that is radically changed from its original creation
creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:58:19 I don't really see it that way what I do is take small bits of detail they used and apply it to my future builds
creations-chat 2022-01-02 00:01:22 Yeah Im pretty upset that every tank build or cold war airplane gets more upvotes than my builds that are different than the average pc build i see all the time also yes that color scheme is better kiwiburp
creations-chat 2022-01-02 00:03:52 Yes, much better I would say the wheels maybe could be a little bit more colored with a standard color like black or something
creations-chat 2022-01-02 00:06:19 Did you read the full thing, thats literally what I said.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 00:08:43 wdym
creations-chat 2022-01-02 00:47:54 Ok, let me change the question up. Would you say its possible that if I was to make a tutorial then to edit it, it would be possible to make such radical change to it that it could be seen as its own original thing?
creations-chat 2022-01-02 00:50:09 I built a tutorial of a plane because at the time I did not know how to make planes as I did now. I decided to remake the previous work into something new so that my effort could be put in what is already made. I thought instead of scrapping my tutorials, I could use what I had already to build apon what I wanted to create with it.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 00:55:25 Well in some sense I feel as though I took what is already there and made it better than the creator couldv'e done. I see it as maybe a team effort and after I changed it I decided to change it again and again so it was more and more of what I can consider my own creation. Human creator always relies on the copy of another's work to create something the original creator couldn't have created because they intended to set the groundwork for those to continue perhaps on what they had done to make more with what was given. Nothing is ever a original idea and every build in some way has some of what someone else has done. I still see edited tutorials as being bad but with the amount of completely remade things I added to my build I can only see it now as that I made it new. To put it simply I did more than just adding something new I made it completely redone from what it was with only vague pieces of what was reminding me that it was never a complete original idea that started from me but evolved to become itself over the time i spent redoing it
creations-chat 2022-01-02 01:03:15 No, mine was long, also just to mention, I no longer use tutorials. Maybe I should use your example of legos. The way I am redoing my plane right now is as if I took a lego set of the statue of liberty and redid the face because I thought it looked bad then, I redid the dress and torch and more and more individual pieces until certain sections were their own thing. When I say modded tutorials I don't want to give the idea that I added somethings onto it what I mean is that a larger amount of the build I chose to make my way. For my modded tut build the only thing that hasn't been changed is the basic shell of the plane like the nose and body but even still I did change some things but the engines tail flaps wings tips inside gears hatches staircases and more were never a tutorial and are completely my own work. Its going to be upgraded for the second time soon and I will post it soon but trust me that it is almost nothing like it was originally except for the resemblance it still holds.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 01:05:16 Because the time I had finished making it was the time I had finally became capable of my own builds.
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:10:19 The problem is that I feel as though the amount of work I had done would be soured by the thought that its originally a tutorial. If I mention its was originally a tutorial theres sort of a sour view from tutorials being posted as creations as it isnt yours. I discredit the originals workers help if I say its my original creation which isnt true but if I credit him It becomes grouped as an edited tutorial build but I feel it is more than an edited tutorial at this point. I feel like the amount of work I put into it almost makes the original creators very insignificant that if i mention it was originally a tutorial people will see it as another edited tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:10:36 I dont want to discredit the creator but
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:11:09 if i credit him its another tutorial build which groups me with those who slightly edit tut builds and it gets removed from creations
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:11:52 Ok can I show a preview of what I have done so far to give you an idea of what this build really is
plane-crazy 2022-01-02 01:12:07 can you link me a server so i can join you

creations-chat 2022-01-02 02:47:17 nobody wins perhaps we could make ammends .we obviously do not like each other but for ever conversation I would like to end it off on a good note. My build was a tutorial but I want to show you how much I have changed it so I invite you to join me on my provate server to see it yourself. I'll take back the things I said about you can we just maybe get along I don't think you are a bad guy. Heres the link https://www.roblox.com/games/166986752?privateServerLinkCode=07603091586361534102425201470305

creations-chat 2022-01-02 03:31:17 üòê I wasn't mad people seem to think that because I wrote paragraphs. I started arguing with nobodywins because he chose to insult me for the paragraphs and just kept going. Eventually I asked for us to make amends and wanted to show him the build i had to give an example of what i meant by more than just a edit of a tut but he disrespectfully declined. Honestly all i wanted was to show you guys that I had a build that would demonstrate a different type of tutorial editing because I asked peoples opinions on heavily modified tutorials
creations-chat 2022-01-02 03:36:57 Also this just goes to show my earlier point that i made that people really will just bully everyone on this site just for having an opinion. Like I was on a discord for pc part picker and after giving a suggestion for a keyboard I got 3 guys telling me I was wrong and ofc they took iit to a level which shouldn't have gone to.
creations-chat 2022-01-02 03:41:30 Some of you guys really need to chill out. I will take back what I said because I don't really mean it but I would appreciate it if people were going to comment on what I had to say at least read what I said. I'm going to bed its 12:40 am rn for me so I wont respond, bye guys

plane-crazy 2022-01-28 01:26:01 Hot take: Shredders are not nearly as bad as pvp planes. Shredder you can kill they need to get close to you. Pvp planes are like little kids who slap you then run away as fast as possible

creations-chat 2022-02-10 23:41:34 Hey I got a question. With the f-16 landing gear it has a 3 prong extension system. Now motor-locking or angle locking it is easy its just actually having them retract is my issue. How could I solve that because ill be stuck with the small landing gear otherwise.
creations-chat 2022-02-10 23:43:36 The circle is this. No landing gear????? --> Make your own landing gear --> No retraction???? then im stuck here

plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:34:51 whats wrong with it
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:36:06 yeah to fix that you cant have two block of different colors in the same space
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:36:35 like can you show me motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:39:03 ight
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:44:27 Hey guys
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:44:32 question for you
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:44:42 do you think pvp in plane crazy should be updated
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:44:49 the reason i say this
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:45:10 is air pvp dominates and any plane at 700 sps is impossible to hit
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:46:31 the problem i see is rockets arent good at air to air
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:48:41 well if you are in a dogfight at high speed trying to hit someone will close tracking rockets that lag 1 second behind and have a very small close tracking and they miss almost all the time
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:50:35 yes but the problem is you cant even get that close and even if you did you would bounce off at those speeds
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:50:49 They should just have guided missiles
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:50:59 any speed doesnt matter
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:51:09 if you get close you kill them no matter what
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:51:29 no rocket bugs
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:51:34 it hits the build
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:51:40 because its on a guided path
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:53:14 thin barrel?
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:54:00 can you give me a pic of what you mean?
plane-crazy 2022-02-17 01:55:16 Use sparkler
creations-chat 2022-02-17 23:04:27 Realistic rudder and elevators. What you think?
creations-chat 2022-02-18 00:56:59 anyone got a 30k build that they can show me? some dude in randoms claimed he had a 30k build but he seemed shady by lying about his hover count and things didnt add up. i wasnt to see a real 30k block build
creations-chat 2022-02-18 00:59:49 yeah so he was def lyinh.
creations-chat 2022-02-18 01:02:20 39 by 51 by 51 in total 100k possible creations if you use ever single space possible
creations-chat 2022-02-18 01:05:23 Man I sniffed this whole guy out. He was talking about building a carrier then told me he had a 28k block build. I called bs and he whipped out a supposely "12k" build yet it ran fine, no lag. I told him my 9k build crashed sometimes and looked quite bigger then he whipped out a 28k supposively build. I was skeptical of him actually filling 1x3 of the plot size and he told me he had 2k hover engines. I said no way and then i had this eurika moment and told him to use glass. That boy was lying and had like 100 hovers then told me it was some glitch. I told him to send a pic but he was hesistant (super shady) eventuall he stopped talking. Im too good at spotting liars
creations-chat 2022-02-18 01:09:44 People on plane crazy are always trying to pretend things and impress others by lying. Yeah its not a tutorial its totally my build bro and some people just cant admit that their build isnt original. The wrost part was that build was pretty cool except for the colors and he jsut had to ruin it by making fake block count numbers
creations-chat 2022-02-18 01:11:48 I think you might run out. Tommorow I'm gonna test this to try and fill out the most space as possible. Ill do it for plane crazy. It hasn't been done yet and I have time to burn
creations-chat 2022-02-18 01:21:07 You can place the main pilot seat on the edge of the plot and itll take up one space also
creations-chat 2022-02-18 01:23:09 what color should all the 100,000 blocks be?

creations-chat 2022-02-26 16:28:26 Can you tell me a build you liked?
creations-chat 2022-02-26 16:34:05 Thats what I was thinking.
creations-chat 2022-02-26 16:36:18 Aerial Refueling Decals. I cant really make it any better because of tags
creations-chat 2022-02-26 16:46:34 See theres a problem with that. If i did use half wedges on the bottom sides I couldn't even use the pyramid wedge for the front because it would make it look weird. The nose is already flat with some curve but if i was to make that curve it would kill the flat part of the underside.

creations-chat 2022-03-05 14:31:10 The roblox avatar is very unproportional. If you were to make the 747 to the correct size it probably would be too big or too small for the character
creations-chat 2022-03-05 14:33:25 Roblox measurements are kind unreliable since Roblox labels the roblox avatar as 6 feet the speed of sound mach 1 in plane crazy is 7000k sps and just from a visual standpoint thats too fast. I would trust visuals more. The roblox head if it was 2 times smaller would make him more proportional
creations-chat 2022-03-05 14:35:43 This f-35 would technically be realistically correct in size
creations-chat 2022-03-05 14:38:02 It's meant to be small so I can get them on a carrier build. Its an old build and I could only use a small motor-lock section so it wouldn't take up too much space in a carriers plot. I was only using that as a demonstration
creations-chat 2022-03-05 14:41:27 I had the motorlock done up so that it didn't stretch out too far so when I made a carrier I could fit a buch of them on it and at the time I didn't know what angle Lock was

creations-chat 2022-03-07 19:51:47 wdym?
creations-chat 2022-03-07 19:53:52 People downvoted 225 likely because of the horrible nose
creations-chat 2022-03-07 19:58:45 I mean its good but the nose Is killing me. Honestly the way creations goes is if you have some interesting mechanism it will be upvoted to at least 100. High effort meme builds or custom builds might get around 200. Small creations are expected to have tons of detail or henceforth be lower effort. Big bigs usually are mass upvoted as long as theres no glaring problem with it. You should just ask people in creations feedback before you post builds to maximize upvotes
creations-chat 2022-03-07 20:00:48 Just wait for pc2 to make any big builds. I don't even have enough room for realistic wings on my 747

creations-chat 2022-03-07 20:14:22 Dude just fix your build and then show the fixed version to creations feedback and if people approve resubmit it in creations. Its not the end of the world <@!472553877711880211> then prefer downvotes
creations-chat 2022-03-07 20:19:54 Man. All these low ranks come to creations feedback and rant about their build getting mass downvoted like its not their fault for making a bad build and we're the problem. <@!472553877711880211>  High standards are good for a voting system. Everyone votes on their preferences and it seems the votes of negativity outweigh the positives. No one is going to upvote a build they think isn't good
creations-chat 2022-03-07 20:23:11 Exactly. I wouldn't have never learnt angle lock or piston lock if it wasn't for the fact that I had to realize that I needed ways to improve my building
creations-chat 2022-03-07 20:30:22 Harsh criticism breeds anger. Ostracized from the group makes people question their points validity. Watching others builds receiving high upvotes for hard work makes others want to obtain that by making their build better. Posting their build to creations feedback. Making changes. Final approval and high upvotes. They finally come to terms with that their salty attitude only lead them down what they shouldv'e been from the start. <@!472553877711880211>  Whats the point to improving your build if you don't need to work hard for upvotes

creations-chat 2022-03-09 19:34:37 WTF why did it change to creations-chat. People just too soft man
creations-chat 2022-03-09 21:10:43 People saying it was renamed creations chat because toxicity. Mods acting like yt rn removing comments and making bad changes that do nothing to change anything only making the thing in particular less enjoyable. Why was it even renamed, what does that accomplish.
creations-chat 2022-03-09 21:13:07 This just makes me want to be more toxic now.
creations-chat 2022-03-09 21:17:51 Not really <@!270291665116200962> alright I guess I see your point
creations-chat 2022-03-09 21:19:54 Honestly the whole toxicity thing was just 99% of whitenames posting their ugly build then getting butthurt over a troll telling them to delete it
creations-chat 2022-03-09 21:24:54 Unpopular opinion but I think slow mode is better maybe changed to 1 min but having a time limits makes it so that there‚Äôs less spam. People can consistently talk to others and the chat isn‚Äôt blow up with useless stuff like in other channels <@!720751430595772418> language
creations-chat 2022-03-09 21:29:43 Well another way to think of it is that the slow mode is so long that random people who talk about nonsense are turned off by the 2 min timer so people with actual feedback can talk here. If some random person starts a arguement in feedback which they usually do it won‚Äôt fill up to 100+ messages in 5 minutes
creations-chat 2022-03-09 21:31:47 That‚Äôs cause people are talking about the name change
creations-chat 2022-03-09 21:37:18 How so? I post my build into feedback and people tell me what to fix.

creations-chat 2022-03-09 22:40:52 Ima get seriousüóø People who complain about toxicity are butthurt that a troll told them their build was ugly without any way of telling them to fix the build.

creations-chat 2022-03-09 22:46:59 I honestly prefer creations-feedback. If you get to know most of the guys in feedback they are super chill. They just like to troll whitenames or other people. I think they really helped me to improve my building since I was ostracized for getting mad at them and now that I have improved and listened to their advice they well respect me.  I think thats what people should do. Harsh criticism while not always being harsh is much better for people to become better builders.
creations-chat 2022-03-09 22:49:44 Mods should just add a warning or something to tell people what to expect when they come to this channel. "warning this channel has high standards to creations" "don't feed/listen to the trolls"

creations-chat 2022-03-09 23:20:30 Exactly. You don't get rewards unless you put in the work. Even bad builders want to see good posts. You can't get good posts without creating an environment so people want to make an actual effort to get approval.

general 2022-03-10 00:00:39 Its like procrastination and acting weird around other people. I dont experience as much to know it a lot but its like you find yourself acting weird or hyper around others and you cant commit to doing things. I dont study at all and put off work alot

creations-chat 2022-03-10 00:03:41 I spend all my time on plane crazy so it usually takes me a week to perfect things if i have the time which I almost always do
general 2022-03-10 00:05:16 Well you can check with your doctor on that but hyperactiveness and procrastination are common with some people. Its like those people who think they depression because they get sad once. Maybe you might who knows
creations-chat 2022-03-10 00:06:12 I like being respond without waiting but I like it more when the chat isn't a flood of nonsense where trying to go to the top and reading down is impossible. 2 minutes is a little ridiculous though maybe 1 min

creations-chat 2022-03-14 12:36:47 How f-15 nose look so far?
creations-chat 2022-03-14 13:08:15 I'll angle lock the top of the nose.  Is that what's chunky?
creations-chat 2022-03-14 13:14:28 I cant wait till we get resize in pc2 so i can fix this
creations-chat 2022-03-14 13:17:22 f-16 nose and the f-15 nose are pretty similar only the f-16 is fatter at the bottom
creations-chat 2022-03-14 13:19:26 Are the pistons locked? If so does it work in flight?
creations-chat 2022-03-14 13:21:53 Also as big as mine
creations-chat 2022-03-14 13:24:18 Can I see it unlocked
creations-chat 2022-03-14 13:44:44 How do you fold big wings and keep the motor hidden or do you not?
creations-chat 2022-03-14 13:53:46 A big one because they need less motorlock. Try A a330 or 777 767. If you want to make a smaller one with motorlock so that it will look good try a a320
creations-chat 2022-03-14 14:00:53 The 737 nose is a nightmare
creations-chat 2022-03-14 14:02:55 Motor lock definitely required on that one. Also the reason I recommend the a330 767 and 777 is because while they take a lot of time they are easy to make if you know how to shape noses decently and the rounded nose is easier than a 757 or a a320

creations-chat 2022-03-15 03:50:24 They are mad because I downvoted for no reason apparently
creations-chat 2022-03-15 03:56:21 Dude you are so tiring. You ask why I downvoted your build and I tell you that you posted it too much. Then, you tell me that 3 posts of the same thing isn't a lot and get pissed that I downvoted it and tell everyone else how I am downvoting for no reason. Even after I say I am removing my downvote Partially explaining I was wrong without implying it too much you still are pissed and repeat the same crap.

creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:14:11 Step 1: insult someones build telling them whats wrong but using memes or gifs to show what they realistically think of it. Step 2: they get mad at the troll and everyone slams them. step 2 alternative: they ask for help and help is given. **This is literally what happens but most people find the insult toxic or insulting and get mad**

creations-chat 2022-03-24 13:40:18 That's literally part of the building process you want to have the color set to something so you can check the picture incase if the picture's color reflects your own. Also recoloring takes like 2 min

the-dump 2022-04-05 13:22:09 Well i was gonna say that I liked jojo music but i didn't know how to write that out so i just didnt

the-dump 2022-04-05 13:23:54 The older i get the more i see myself becoming more out of touch with the future generation of peoples
the-dump 2022-04-05 13:25:38 Yeah. Theres just something about that word that describes them perfectly. I don't get how people enjoy someone talking with a slow sad song you cant vibe out to that
the-dump 2022-04-05 13:26:18 fire banger beats bops buster funky jumpy
the-dump 2022-04-05 13:27:16 yes
the-dump 2022-04-05 13:29:29 Honestly most of the music I listen to I could guarantee no one has heard of it or at least doesn't hear it to vibe. I cant seem to enjoy most of the new popular songs because my taste is so different to others that every new song sound like the same stuff where is a mediocre beat with mediocre lyrics and singing.
the-dump 2022-04-05 13:30:13 I feel like every "Lil" "someone" is the same person
the-dump 2022-04-05 13:31:04 Yeah he had like one good song that popped off
the-dump 2022-04-05 13:34:34 Then people ask me to play them a song for us to listen to but then become lifeless when I play a song they have never heard of and it just becomes a awkward moment
the-dump 2022-04-05 13:37:21 any single nostalgic song that is made into a epic orchestra remix make is almost always absolute banger

the-dump 2022-04-05 16:25:32 too bad the far left activists who get butt hurt about anything that goes against their worldview want to do anything to silence those who donate to people they disagree with and financially ruin and threaten someone and their loved ones because they spent money the way they wanted to
the-dump 2022-04-05 16:28:48 A website that exists with a social culture of canceling others to ruin them or deplatform them further encouraged by the fact one can send a message to everyone or rally people together while they are standing behind a wall of anonymity and the spread of influence from twitter is only further reached by the media from canceling it produces
the-dump 2022-04-05 16:29:41 yes
the-dump 2022-04-05 16:33:11 Also the anonymity of users on twitter builds up mentality of someone who can create and cause problems without repercussion or setbacks. In a sense, like discord, you don't know who i am so I can say bad things without worrying about it in day to day life
the-dump 2022-04-05 16:34:16 well think about it
the-dump 2022-04-05 16:36:27 You have anthropromophic animals in a video game media where people will take their favorite character and essentially ship them or create fake personas or personalities of these characters based on what is perceived to be their attitude or personatily from assumption
the-dump 2022-04-05 16:37:04 It opens a whole slue of ideas where people share different things where the characters are turned into what the internet thinks they are.
the-dump 2022-04-05 16:37:15 Also
the-dump 2022-04-05 16:38:06 the vast majority of people who make stuff like fanart do make sxly explicit material for money and because the market and demand have shifted to the people who make that stuff
the-dump 2022-04-05 16:38:44 Basically
the-dump 2022-04-05 16:38:49 They get no bitches
the-dump 2022-04-05 16:39:02 So they invent their own version of it
the-dump 2022-04-05 16:39:30 wait what?
the-dump 2022-04-05 16:42:08 Misrepresentation is part of the problem
the-dump 2022-04-05 16:42:12 he isnt a republican
the-dump 2022-04-05 16:42:29 he openly stated he donated money to who he believed would be good canidates
the-dump 2022-04-05 16:42:42 he donated money to republicans and democrats
the-dump 2022-04-05 16:42:57 The thing that probably ticked people off mostly though
the-dump 2022-04-05 16:43:03 was that he donated to Trump

plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:40:55 Bananas are objectively the best fruit and heres why
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:41:00 1. quick to eat
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:41:08 2. taste is pretty good not the best
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:41:33 3. Bananas have their own handles to eat
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:42:09 tryna eat a mango with the seed is torture
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:42:41 I would say the tastiest fruit is pineapple
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:43:08 Pineapple juices too they come naturally and taste like sweet lemonade
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:43:38 You know
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:43:42 the thing is
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:43:52 I really have no reason to care for anyones preferences
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:43:55 I only care
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:44:05 when people make it their buisness to tell everyone
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:44:09 without anyone asking
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:44:11 like

plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:44:48 so goood
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:45:10 blueberries are good when you get a handful of them
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:45:28 pears are apples but better in every way
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:45:52 eating a apple is worse tho
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:45:56 Its so hard to eat
plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:46:02 Like

plane-crazy 2022-04-06 11:46:28 They are really soft

creations-chat 2022-04-13 15:07:42 I'm thinking about making a Stratolaunch f-82 thing But its two AC-130's and its carrying a massive gun of destruction
creations-chat 2022-04-13 15:11:46 Well I have two ideas. One is to have a massive railgun in the middle that shoots tnt balls and bomb bays for the ac-130. That or I scale up on guns like more howitzers or more cannons. Probably gonna do the first. I need a good name for it. If the ac-130 is called the gunship what would a name for a massive gunship be?

creations-chat 2022-04-17 20:57:52 I was thinking how cool would it be to have a ac-130 but you make it like a f-82 so theres 2 of them = more gun basically a strato-launch
creations-chat 2022-04-17 21:02:37 It was an edit of my previous plane. Ill motorlock stuff rather than folding in the future
creations-chat 2022-04-17 21:04:37 Which?
creations-chat 2022-04-17 21:10:18 The Elevators should be bigger than the vertical stabilizers the intakes generally suck and look very small colors feel like they are all over the place too many grays that look too similar. It honestly looks like a cartoon character with the head being bigger than the body. (Front too big and comes up too high) (Make the vertical stabilizers smaller)
creations-chat 2022-04-17 21:28:27 I called it the Yacr-1. Y= prototype, A=attack, C=cargo, R=railgun (like l= laser), ‚Äú1‚Äù because it‚Äôs the first so we started with 1
creations-chat 2022-04-17 21:46:46 Don‚Äôt make the elevators bigger. Nose is that big since it raises like 2 blocks make it raise like 1 block instead. Maybe make a f-16 vertical stabilizer because it really is bothering me that the vertical stabilizers you have are bigger than the elevators. The top colors are nice, but try a different underbelly color (something lighter maybe)
creations-chat 2022-04-17 22:54:18 Yeah maybe a little more gray to the blue

plane-crazy 2022-04-22 13:56:52 1. Magnet blocks are laggy on big builds 2. Don't really work at all/ very well 3. Doesn't work with other peoples builds. 4. Is 1 block big and can be changed for smaller sizes
plane-crazy 2022-04-22 13:57:59 The main idea is that fact its interchangeable with other peoples builds. You don't get that with magnets. Lemme fix it then
creations-chat 2022-04-22 14:37:48 Ask for a appeal durrrr
general 2022-04-22 15:56:10 Yes but when you use magnets to stick to anything they don't work very well. A simpler method is just to have 2 blocks dedicated to stick together. Also magnets lag my 3000 block build
general 2022-04-22 15:57:43 I mean train carts, Ariel refueling, tow trucks, Theres so much that can be made.
general 2022-04-22 15:58:12 Yes that would be cool
creations-chat 2022-04-22 16:00:46 Why don't people make more Airliners.
creations-chat 2022-04-22 16:37:24 I could make like 100 different builds just by editing my 747 for something else. I'm close to finishing my Airforce One but I could have the Yal-1, Cargo version, Make a dreamlifter, passenger variant, Making the flying aircraft carrier version or make the flying missile cruiser, A pan am 747, The doomsday plane, heck a 747 engine testbed, Flying telescope, or a 747x. Probably don't have enough room for the Space shuttle 747 but do you think I should do though.

creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:14:11 Literally. There should be a warning for people posting that their builds or them, can and will get insulted for what they post
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:16:14 Yes.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:19:00 I don't bully people for their builds but I will post a message link of their build with a skull.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:20:49 I would have never learned the new locks and improving without people joking about how my builds were bad. It's not bullying people for their builds its more like people joking about other peoples terrible builds and then they get mad at the trolls.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:23:05 It's really not people shitting on people's builds its just the white names getting mad because people call their creation's bad. They feel like you have to be nice when criticizing builds. As for me I do both I will joke about how bad a build is but if they ask for feedback I'll give it <@652925710976942100> lol I remember that
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:25:20 Hey, thanks for the compliment <@652925710976942100> fr
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:27:38 Yeah but the anonymity of the internet allows me to be rude/annoying without repercussion. Compare me to other people on a normal day and I'll be more tame than most. I just troll unless someone asks for help
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:31:48 Im mostly joking. I spend my time on here looking at creations downvoting the shit ones. Linking the messages of the worst ones with a skull in <#504436696021204992>  and talking with people who respond. If someone asks me for help or asks me for helpful information I'll be as respectful as I can be.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:34:55 Oh yeah I forgot to mention if people respond back to me with insults I will do the same, but thats my basic routine. I just like to boaster my semi unpopular beliefs to egg people on. In general Im not mean unless people are mean to me.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 12:39:23 Just to sum it up because I want to stop talking, I just want to be 100% real to my character which I can't do offline. I am surrounded by liberals who will deathstare me for saying anything that doesn't revolve around their beliefs. I genuinely enjoy being myself contrast to real life where people will sour my character with gossip for what I say. I genuinely want to be a nice person but I also want to be a good person. Good and Nice aren't the same.

creations-chat 2022-04-25 16:40:04 This is what I'm talking about. I criticize a build then some whiner comes and acts like I'm mad, smh.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 16:44:14 Too bad I'll criticize whatever tf I want. Your ego is so massive that you live in a world where no one can say anything bad about your build or they are just mad. I'll end it here, sure. <@839451762205392897> typing <@839451762205392897> I thought you were going to end it here?

creations-chat 2022-04-25 16:51:38 It's bad. The ego of this guy. I don't care how long it took I don't care if you think its good, it isn't. Also no need to name call
creations-chat 2022-04-25 16:54:02 I told him he needed to use a color other than blue. Also I like arguments and he's name calling. Hes directly ignoring what I'm telling him saying "Its good you're wrong." <@738064035135750224> I wasnt calling him names
creations-chat 2022-04-25 16:55:44 Because its literally the only color you use and it looks bad when you use one color. At least color it something other than just blue. Also bypass https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/968192046613528597
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:03:49 I don't if he didn't ask for my criticism. I gave him constructive criticism and he got angry.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:06:21 I told him the whole wing is a aileron the afterburner looks like crap and the color is bad. He could do the simple thing and ask how he could improve and I would tell him gladly.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:08:21 Look up my messages. I have told people what to improve before because they asked. I'm literally doing the same thing hars does <@738064035135750224> Frankie is
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:10:11 You obviously don't know what I do here
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:11:57 I said it above but I'll say it again. I spend my day coming on here seeing the countless terrible builds and downvoting them. If I see something random I want to dump in <#504436696021204992> I'll find some build then crap on it for one thing. I know people will get mad and explain how im not giving constructive feedback. If they dont get mad and ask for how to fix it I will tell them what to fix <@375281006091173890> hello

creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:17:05 This is what I do every day. I tell people whats bad about their builds and not how to fix it. Its kind of hard to tell how to fix it so I wait until they ask but I like to start controversy and I want to get more chat typing points.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:18:59 I told him to use different colors and to add more details for the boat. For the plane to fix the colors and to fix the afterburner and ailerons.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:20:43 Thanks fleet. You're like my one brother who says exactly what I can't but want to say because I suck at talking. Love you man
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:22:30 I literally told what looked bad= aka fix it.
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:24:15 It‚Äôs pretty simple to understand. If your boss says the burgers you make suck then ask him how to make them not suck. <@866848584888877077> Pretty much
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:28:08 I know right. If I say the build is bad they should fix it. Can‚Äôt believe someone doesn‚Äôt understand it

creations-chat 2022-04-27 17:17:12 Well I then recommend that you post the build after you get feedback or it might just be considered a wip. You ask for thoughts so ask chat for thoughts, fix the plane, and then post it

creations-chat 2022-04-27 21:38:57 I don't think the color was the problem. The plane wings are paper thin, the engines are too big or the fuselage is too wide, The windows and wings are positioned too high. The tail is too small The gears are a mess and the nose is indistinguishable from any plane except a c-5 abomination
creations-chat 2022-04-27 21:42:46 Shouldnt the nose be longer and the canards bigger

creations-chat 2022-05-03 14:17:21 Don't use disc as wheel rims use a ‚óâ or ‚óé. The nitro engines look very blocky so maybe better curves. The spoiler is just a capital letter I so more detail or lining. The front looks pretty good but maybe detail the grill so its not just solid black. I don't know if you can but that 1x2 delta wing on the side shouldn't cut off the window like that. Just angle a trail there instead. Space out the back wheels since they look stuck to the chassis. Also the back pat of the build looks weird compared to the front so use a bit of red in the back to make it look like it belongs to part of the build. Color the back a bit of that red or add some red panels back there

creations-chat 2022-05-03 19:28:54 So Fleet and that other guy were talking because fleet downvoted tractor. When they are talking I come into chat and say the build is ass and he lights up. He then goes to search my builds to insult them and keeps going on. I will admit it looked like they were arguing but apparently if you argue but have high rank it's just joking. My point still stands that I wasn't really doing anything wrong i constantly crap on other people's build but I'll admit that i was wrong when saying that they were arguing. <@791976765123592233> Thats just what I do. If they want actual helpful feedback just ask.
creations-chat 2022-05-03 19:32:20 Ik right. I mean the effort someone puts into responding to a troll comment is insane. <@456226577798135808> Well I lost the arguement only because I had less people on my side and he's the same rank level as me.

plane-crazy 2022-05-04 12:04:06 The chairs are white the table is white the overhead light is white. The background is grayer. Your build has less detail the ladders dont work because you use them by themselves the overhead wing isnt shown the black lines around the ceiling where. What is the sand supposed to match. The floor is terrible. I mean the reason it looks so bad is because you didn't add enough detail that has more different colors
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 12:06:36 So then its not even the real thing.
plane-crazy 2022-05-04 12:14:16 Fine whatever.
