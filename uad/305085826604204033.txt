creations-chat 2019-09-24 22:19:10 Currently the only ground attacker that i've made that i'm happy with. Can take a bit of punishment, as i've flown it with an entire wing blown off and the tail gone. I don't feel like I deserve a rank for this, as it's purely built as a ground attacker and not for aesthetics. Block count is around 230-ish.
creations-chat 2019-09-24 22:20:23 cool.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:20:46 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:20:53 Just roblox being roblox, I guess?
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:22:31 cat
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:24:39 am i a weird person for making my planes function over form
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:25:09 i mean
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:25:39 on the topic about my ground attacker, it can take a fair lot of punishment and can go over 450 speed
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:25:59 a lot of punishment as in an entire wing blown off and the tail gone
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:26:05 oh, it just is super rocket powered
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:26:14 it's
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:26:16 a ground attacker
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:26:19 as in it's a plane
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:26:23 that attacks tanks and stuff
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:26:58 yea
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:28:15 then i have a light fighter that has keyboard and mouse steering
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:28:26 so it can invert and stuff, which is cool i guess
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:28:37 Also made a VTOL variant of that.
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:30:37 not so surprising
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:30:42 wh
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:30:48 i mean mouse controlled control surfaces
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:31:02 i'm confused
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:31:25 i joined like an hour ago and all of my stuff isn't that special
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:31:49 interesting
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:32:20 wh-
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:33:24 actually technically i could request lvl 1 aeronautical engineer as my ground attacker is around 230 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:33:29 and flies, without helium
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:37:47 i just get impressed at superior builds
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:40:02 idk, i'm bored
plane-crazy 2019-09-24 22:40:09 prolly gonna build a seaplane or something

plane-crazy 2019-10-16 00:39:52 people don't dare
plane-crazy 2019-10-16 00:39:57 ping the almighty one
general 2019-10-18 14:17:28 oh lawd he a heccin' chonker
general 2019-10-18 14:17:33 yes i made a bulwark-
general 2019-10-18 14:17:35 fly
general 2019-10-18 16:00:49 Yes it's ftd <@339519624968404993>
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 21:37:17 quick question
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 21:37:25 do longer wedges have decreased drag?
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 21:37:39 like, a 1x1 wedge has more drag than a 1x4 wedge
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 21:38:10 ...
plane-crazy 2019-10-24 21:38:15 that's confusing
creations-chat 2019-10-24 21:43:09 Remember that ground attacker from a month or two ago? Yeah, I've updated it. I won't post the block count, but it can turn faster than the hummingbird due to servo controls (i know it isn't anything new) but yeah updated it.
creations-chat 2019-10-24 23:44:29 h m
creations-chat 2019-10-24 23:44:52 it could be preferable
creations-chat 2019-10-24 23:45:06 if you were to remove 1000 from the block count you said it was to keep it accurate
creations-chat 2019-10-24 23:45:13 unless that was your goal
creations-chat 2019-10-25 00:07:30 you're welcome mate
creations-chat 2019-10-25 18:53:59 :P
creations-chat 2019-10-25 18:54:30 no context
creations-chat 2019-10-25 18:54:44 my attacker gets a terrible upvote to downvote ratio
creations-chat 2019-10-25 18:54:46 and i'm like
creations-chat 2019-10-25 18:54:49 Ok...
plane-crazy 2019-10-28 21:38:23 yo dudes
plane-crazy 2019-10-28 21:38:38 whats the community record for the most disliked creation in <#384025409945337856>
plane-crazy 2019-10-28 21:38:43 i need soemthing to beat
plane-crazy 2019-10-28 21:39:00 lets try and see if my heavily disliked ground attacker
plane-crazy 2019-10-28 21:39:05 can win that record
plane-crazy 2019-10-28 21:39:56 lol
creations-chat 2019-12-10 13:49:45 Been messing with conveyor drives, and this thing already goes at silly speeds
creations-chat 2019-12-10 13:50:24 this thing's a crazy skid dragster
creations-chat 2019-12-10 13:51:53 *Hm, I wonder what happens if I increase the force of the piston.*
general 2019-12-10 13:53:06 cate
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 13:53:13 hm
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 13:53:17 i'm just thinking
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 13:53:25 what happens if i put 2 conveyor drives on a craft
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 13:53:30 <:Thinkje139:590548255927173201>
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 13:53:45 This must be done in the name of science!
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 13:54:02 i will experiment more
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 11:08:43 looks like something i would build
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 11:08:46 but it isnèt me
creations-chat 2019-12-16 13:11:00 i have plans
creations-chat 2019-12-16 13:11:03 on making a raven
creations-chat 2019-12-16 13:11:07 ADF-11F
creations-chat 2019-12-16 13:11:30 with detatching module and everything
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:38:33 shame
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:38:45 put a TLS
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:39:02 i see
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:40:43 i see
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:40:48 interesting experiment
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:43:52 kind of like
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:44:01 a magnet engine but can be made slightly more compact
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:44:10 <@!195253906333368320> it does lag a bit when not used for a while
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:44:17 when it isn't used for a bit
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:44:24 My pc's really powerful, btw.
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:44:51 when it's being used, fps remains normal
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:45:01 but when it isn't used for some time, it begins to lag
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:45:20 that's what i've found out in my testing
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:45:34 so it's almost the opposite in terms of lag with magnet drives
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:45:53 magnet drives lag when used, this one lags if you leave it alone for too long without using ti
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 21:45:56 it*
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:06:21 totally 👏  not 👏 a 👏 bad attempt at a X-49 inspired plane
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:06:43 lets see if i can break my old dislike high scores with this one
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:08:17 nice
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:08:43 but like seriously i kinda think what i'm making looks ugly
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:08:52 so oof
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:11:19 lol true
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:14:10 that's some nicely balanced he-
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:14:11 no....
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:14:14 HM.....
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:14:35 no
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:14:36 because look
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:14:43 it would sweep it off
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:14:46 balance
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:14:48 or push it
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:15:37 hm
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:16:11 it feels like it's using cameras
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:16:13 but
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:20:13 ?
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:20:21 I thought signs had opacity?
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:21:55 Opinions on the cockpit?
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:21:58 just the way it's designed now?
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:22:06 only the cockpit, i'm aware it currently-
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:22:07 k
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:22:30 
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:22:35 obc, it's kinda like a futuristic biplane
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:22:38 dont ask
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:23:03 i'm gonna build the topside wings later
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:23:08 aha
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:23:22 yes
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:24:12 I see.
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:24:22 i mean
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:24:29 a lot of my planes have windowblind wings
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:24:31 which
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:24:37 i still admit to having that habit
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:24:40 yeah, i'm gonna try that
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:26:25 <@!195253906333368320> before i tweak with motors
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:26:31 lets see if the damned thing holds together
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:26:41 yep, holdsw
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:26:42 holds
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:32:26 lol
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:32:34 but thinking about it
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:32:37 i'm being smart
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:32:54 as all of my designs look so abhorrently ugly that nobody wants to copy them
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:33:33 hm
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:33:38 watch
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:33:39 as
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:33:52 watch as it just flies up then nosedives
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:34:02 LOL
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:34:29 wait how does one unweld
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:34:43 like explosions with almost no pressure?
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:34:49 oh
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:35:19 oh
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:35:21 L O L
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:35:38 this man makes a helicopter, says fuck it and just puts vertical jets on it
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:35:44 and even then it refuses to fly
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:35:54 and i thought I WAS BAD <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:36:35 corncopter
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:36:41 i mean i'd join and fight but
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:36:47 most of my designs aren't any good
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:37:02 because my designs are always too imprecise
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:37:23 take my heavily disliked ground attacker
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:37:30 it can turn on a dime and is quite fast
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:37:33 but
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:37:41 it can't do anything very well
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:38:45 wait
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:39:05 how does one connect a wing to the side of a motor2?
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:39:17 ...
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:39:27 i mean, not the top
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:39:39 basically impossible.
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:39:40 fun.
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:51:19 getting somewhere, i am (i think)
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:54:06 <@!195253906333368320> am i getting somewhere?
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:54:29 i mean
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:54:41 it looks way better than the windowblind wings
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:55:08 i don't know how to fix that, really.
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:55:22 o h
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:55:33 no, my issue is
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:55:49 the fact that wings can't connect to the very side of the motor
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:56:01 so i basically have to have it
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:56:04 ...
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:56:14 in a private server?
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:57:02 lemme show what i mean
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:57:41 that wing isn't connected, so i have to use the wedge and the thing there
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:57:54 i'm yet to know a way around
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:58:22 yes
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:58:28 kerr
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:59:13 that is issue, that's why i have to have the ugly thing
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:59:29 which is sad
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 22:59:34 but i think i can make it look nicer.
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:01:08 🧐 not bad idea
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:01:22 but then the controls would be way too fucking sensitive
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:02:21 then we encounter the problem of the controls not being sensitive enough
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:02:23 it does
plane-crazy 2019-12-17 23:02:55 i see
creations-chat 2019-12-17 23:16:38 and dont forget about cutter style wedges
creations-chat 2019-12-17 23:16:49 along with corresponding front and back pieces
creations-chat 2019-12-17 23:17:01 so we can make pointier fronts
creations-chat 2019-12-17 23:17:03 that look nicer
help 2019-12-17 23:32:19 looks like it

creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:09:29 thing
creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:09:43 i'm slowly learning on making my designs look better for sure
creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:10:34 yeah,
creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:10:40 this thing looks in my opinion
creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:10:47 millions of times better than my ground attacker
creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:10:57 but it has very shitty yaw issues
creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:11:02 that i don't know how in hell to fix
creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:11:26 h m'st?
creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:11:39 or considering my plane is inspired by the X-49
creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:11:42 and not a replica
creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:11:48 i could make some modifications to it on my own
creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:12:15 like giving it one big tailfin instead of 2 smaller ones on the edges
creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:12:41 exactly what i had on the sides of the wings
creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:13:03 thats what i plan on doing
creations-chat 2019-12-18 13:13:17 in fact, this is funny how all of my previous aircraft had yaw fuckery like this

plane-crazy 2020-03-05 01:16:19 first attempt at aesthetics and it's a hovertank
plane-crazy 2020-03-05 01:16:24 probably not enough pads sadly
plane-crazy 2020-03-05 01:17:41 ehhhhhhh
creations-chat 2020-03-05 20:58:02 I feel like this will be the testbed for all of my weapons. The EXHT-01.
creations-chat 2020-03-05 21:03:42 me too
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 00:36:02 i love hover engines
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 00:39:03 oh well
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 00:39:19 my hovertank literally just raises or lowers its pads to turn
plane-crazy 2020-03-06 00:39:39 not at all

creations-chat 2020-04-07 19:45:27 A new jet i'm building. feedback would be nice but you can hate it, i'm totally ok with that lol
creations-chat 2020-04-07 19:47:00 tbh, i rather admire the people who are better than me, because i am aware of how bad my builds are lol
creations-chat 2020-04-07 19:48:12 yes im aware of the lack of enough control surfaces
creations-chat 2020-04-07 19:48:51 it's loosely based off a mig-29
creations-chat 2020-04-07 19:49:26 im prolly gonna be using servo controls as im trying to avoid doing windowblind wings
creations-chat 2020-04-07 19:52:25 lol
creations-chat 2020-04-07 19:52:37 ditching windowblind wings is a way im gonna get better
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:02:52 motor 2 is a more advanced motor 1 lol
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:03:04 motor 1 is more simple, but motor 2 has servo features, and the ability to follow the mouse
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:03:35 you know what i'd love to see
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:03:45 []x0.9 wings
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:04:16 basically like the 1x0.9 block but instead its with wing blocks, allowing us to make better looking servo control surfaces
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:11:26 <@!500443537389912074> that's really high quality
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:18:02 front ones are canards
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:18:06 rear ones are actually elevators
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:18:54 basically
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:19:04 they're like elevators but usually at the front
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:19:39 well
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:19:40 funny thing is
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:19:45 my canards are my ailerons for some reason
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:19:54 im trying things out and experimenting
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:20:17 i dont really wanna revise the entire wing design
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:56:58 as in
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:57:05 it's
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:57:10 "better than what i can create"
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:57:20 lol
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:57:43 ?
creations-chat 2020-04-07 20:57:56 aha

creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:04:57 shes yet to be painted
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:05:03 yeah
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:05:27 it loses 2 guns, but gains 2 missiles
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:05:32 over my normal fighter armament
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:20:28 paint
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:24:01 also has wing trails activated with pitch up for extra realism ig
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:27:02 you know what's incredibly annoying
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:27:12 i only have around 73k save data out of 260k
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:27:18 and my stuff is already corrupting slightly
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:30:23 as in
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:30:27 when i save stuff
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:30:32 and load it back in
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:30:37 there are some missing blocks
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:30:53 my fighter that i was posting a bit about above is losing some tail blocks that i've had to replace
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:31:05 either it loses them
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:31:09 or they're rotated
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:55:12 wait thats not corruption with the deltas
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:55:16 thats just a bug with them
creations-chat 2020-04-07 21:59:41 not sure
creations-chat 2020-04-07 22:13:59 nice
help 2020-04-08 04:20:23 ...
help 2020-04-08 04:20:34 ive had that issue before, and i'm not sure how to fix it
help 2020-04-08 04:20:54 wheres ur CoM
help 2020-04-08 04:21:03 center of mass
help 2020-04-08 04:21:05 afaik
help 2020-04-08 04:21:14 you want to have your rudder somewhat in line with your center of mass
help 2020-04-08 04:21:22 like
help 2020-04-08 04:21:38 somewhat inline like this
help 2020-04-08 04:21:51 my plane has had little to no yaw issues for some reason
help 2020-04-08 04:21:56 which is very atypical of my designs
help 2020-04-08 04:22:01 but im not sure if that fixes it
help 2020-04-08 04:22:22 i guess?
help 2020-04-08 04:23:08 try it out
help 2020-04-08 04:23:18 try experimenting with different rudder locations
creations-chat 2020-04-08 16:17:05 well here it is, the XF-8492 "Skystreak" Light fighter. Personally, I find it a fitting replacement for the XFA-17 "Hummingbird". She's more of a combatant, but I spent some time making her look better than the hummingbird too.
creations-chat 2020-04-08 16:20:37 Interestingly enough, she even uses cutter blocks in her construction which means i can ram people with this too lol
creations-chat 2020-04-08 16:43:56 opinions?
creations-chat 2020-04-08 16:48:34 striker
creations-chat 2020-04-08 16:48:50 you realize that's my fourth major plane project and i really tried to give aesthetics a go this time
creations-chat 2020-04-08 16:50:23 i'm not that good at building too
creations-chat 2020-04-09 01:29:03 it gets my seal of approval because its better than what i can make
creations-chat 2020-04-09 01:46:55 ok
creations-chat 2020-04-09 01:57:12 well then dont
creations-chat 2020-04-09 01:57:16 whats ur opinion on my jet
creations-chat 2020-04-09 01:57:22 ill dm you it if u cant find it tho
creations-chat 2020-04-09 01:57:25 like
creations-chat 2020-04-09 01:57:29 it's not the best looking
creations-chat 2020-04-09 01:57:35 actually it looks like hot garbage
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 01:33:19 ngl
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 01:33:47 i like how my jets are good enough to easily curbstomp an entire pvp server, but at the same time the moment anybody whos decently good joins in i myself get curbstomped
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 01:34:43 good point
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 01:35:07 then again, i don't really get curbstomped
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 01:35:33 i more or less just get put in an awkward situation where i cant kill them and they have issues killing me
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 01:35:46 i'm bad, but not terrible
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 01:37:13 what ship is that meant to be?
plane-crazy 2020-04-15 01:37:37 it gives me richelieu vibes along with the iowa carrier conversion vibes
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:29:35 not tryna be mean or anything but
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:29:49 that A-10 looks like a horrid mishmash of a Su-25 and an A-10
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:30:07 dragon
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:30:21 eh
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:30:59 ive been playing plane crazy for around a year and still have utter garbage like this
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:31:05 but hey
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:31:11 my stuff is more combat oriented
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:31:16 not meant to look good
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:31:20 i changed those motors to
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:31:21 too
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:31:46 i dont think i have screenshots of my latest versions
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:32:13 legit all of my vehicles are pvp oriented and i intend to keep it that way
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:32:24 but
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:32:31 the planes fight very well
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:32:55 they can go toe to toe against almost any stuff that most servers have
the-dump 2020-05-03 22:35:17 Here. Have a video of what presumes to be James May saying "Cheese".
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:35:39 game 🅱️roke
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:36:01 i honestly dont wanna post anything more to submit
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:36:11 i like my name being toothpaste blue
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:36:16 my stuff doesnt use shifting
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:36:35 because i like my planes to be as glitch free
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:36:39 as possible
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:37:10 Interestingly enough i like to use servo control surfaces on my pvp fighters
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:37:37 because servo surfaces are gamer tools to make ur plane have better turning than half the server
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 22:37:51 It also gives my planes excessive STOL capabilities
the-dump 2020-05-03 22:38:28 nowords
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 16:22:36 have people been experiencing massive amounts of lag involving plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 16:22:38 and desync?
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 16:22:50 if youre wondering what it is, it's adopt me publishing an update
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 16:23:09 ***on peak server hours*** <:thchoink:527880803456122891>
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 16:23:39 adopt me published an update when there were over 700,000 people playing their game and now all of roblox is facing the consequences
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 16:23:59 so if ur wondering where the lag is coming from, there you go
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 16:35:57 yep
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 16:36:01 just another day in roblox
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 16:36:22 because their devs decided to publish an update a little bit ago
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 16:36:28 and roblox is facing the consequences
plane-crazy 2020-05-05 16:37:05 im wondering if its fixed now
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 01:15:53 I've tried many types of engine but none of them seem to work as well as internal rockets
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 01:16:44 I tried magnet drives both with suspension and without
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 01:17:37 The only one that went faster than the rockets was the suspension magnet engine
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 01:18:05 And it was in a burst of acceleration and then slowed down
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 01:19:02 I'd love to make my fighter faster, but I'm not sure what to do
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 01:19:22 It currently goes 550
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 01:19:34 In a straight line
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 01:19:47 It hits 620 in a dive
plane-crazy 2020-05-07 01:21:38 Its main counter is speed, as in my experience with it few enemies beat it in a turn fight
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 05:40:33 yo, just wondering
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 05:40:54 what advantages do the standard jet engines have over rocket engines?
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 05:41:00 in terms of outright combat performance
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 05:44:42 also how do you motor lock sorry
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 05:48:12 ...
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 05:48:40 are you sure thats the actual way to motor lock for decorative purposes and not just for jokes
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 05:49:55 ah
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 05:49:57 thank you.
plane-crazy 2020-05-08 05:50:02 it works

creations-chat 2020-05-15 20:42:20 checking on this, i find it interesting how my most upvoted creation (afaik) is a simple moving gunsight i made
creations-chat 2020-05-15 20:43:30 my aesthetics skills are bad, but hey
creations-chat 2020-05-15 20:43:38 like
creations-chat 2020-05-15 20:43:49 it did take a bit of effort to fit the gunsight
creations-chat 2020-05-15 20:44:28 a majority of the fuselage on the plane i fit the gunsight on was 3m wide and 3m tall
creations-chat 2020-05-15 20:45:57 im still hoping that piston max force gets a buff so it's actually a reliable gunsight

creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:43:49 bruh moment.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:44:06 you're better off posting a single block than a shredder bug
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:47:04 ^
creations-chat 2020-09-16 22:47:23 it is a better shredder, but you can't polish a turd and expect people to like it.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 23:51:27 Holy jesus.
creations-chat 2020-09-16 23:51:37 WHAT IS THAT? 
WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!
creations-chat 2020-09-19 20:11:44 archi why did that remind me of the steel striders novgorod
creations-chat 2020-09-19 20:11:49 not the smol thing

general 2020-09-23 13:18:10 <@!447221768520859659> why did this remind me of the Rhea in from the depths

plane-crazy 2020-09-23 13:23:50 I mean, I'm ranked and I play in Public PVP servers for lols
general 2020-09-23 13:24:27 ooh nice aigaion
general 2020-09-23 13:24:58 lol
general 2020-09-23 16:18:36 yes ik the paint is weird
general 2020-09-23 16:18:58 one with a ship inside it but without the funky paint
general 2020-09-23 16:19:58 yeah
general 2020-09-23 16:20:33 if you want to see wide look at my largest creation in ftd lol
general 2020-09-23 16:20:41 it's the ship on the left
general 2020-09-23 16:21:09 personally i prefer from the depths over plane crazy because i get to work with much more intricate systems and i'm not held back by size limitations
plane-crazy 2020-09-23 16:21:21 moment
general 2020-09-23 23:06:12 
general 2020-09-23 23:07:00 lol
general 2020-09-24 22:13:56 i did a do
general 2020-09-24 22:14:03 
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:15:55 ohno
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:17:27 i feel a grave sense of danger, but hey. bad vehicle isn't a bad vehicle, merely a learning experience. yes the canards are massive. yes that's for aerodynamic balancing. yes i made it as a combat vehicle, wasn't really made to look too good.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:19:19 so the main complaint seems to be canards being fucking massive, i'll see what i can do. Any other feedback before I get back to work?
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:21:16 wedges behind cockpit, alright. The missile placement is just a habit tbh, but I'll look into that too.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:24:18 Exposed motors, a h.... Got that. Intakes I was never really happy with, i need to change those. Engines are well, I'm yet to learn the technique for motor locking jets into rockets to make those look better, canopy again is something I really need to work on, Nose i'm unsure about again, but to be honest I don't mind the exposed motors for now considering that aircraft was the first time I ever used motor lock. ~~Also, what's with the 1 and a half minute slowmode~~ But anyways, yeah the motors need to be fixed
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:26:37 <@!489910972946055172> when it comes to aesthetics my creation was already dead on arrival so...
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:30:14 ~~i'm honestly not sure how to react, like the standards for good builds has gone through the fucking roof to the point i probably couldn't hope to improve. this is why i normally don't go for looks. But hey, feedback is feedback and this feedback makes me wanna improve.~~
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:31:52 lmao you think that's bad when my stuff exists, i normally build for combat effective design rather than looks but hey this shitty EF2000 ripoff is rather good at PVP so ehh, i'm happy with it.
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:33:52 <:welrodUnamused:681707039323324437>
stop trying to one up me in poorly made creations, death
creations-chat 2020-11-19 22:36:53 i mean i do wonder, is my shitty EF2000 ripoff considered low effort? probably is
creations-chat 2020-12-01 11:35:52 <:UH:668028831805734912>
creations-chat 2020-12-01 13:41:42 <@!468458118657867786> just a friendly reminder that maybe self upvoting isn't the best idea
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:04:20 A bit of a worrying craft has been found, not sure if it's been posted yet. Me and a friend ( <@!412694102006824960> ) have spotted this new type of "Bug" that flies at many thousand studs per second, can change directions at insane rates, can almost hover, and is the physical embodiment of all things wrong with this world. Not to mention the person who made this said they were recording a tutorial AND were letting people copy off him.
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:04:44 I'm not sure if It's already known but...
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:07:50 They're m o r e than shredders.
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:07:55 M O R E. than shredders.
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:08:45 That... THING is a threat to the PCC as a whole.
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:10:07 And configs that make it unable to be a submarine
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:10:10 but light as fuck
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:10:39 It's a fucking demon and there's damn no way to hit it.
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:12:14 "low tier" conveyor drive
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:12:27 no?
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:12:40 well that begs the question
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:12:46 do helicopter blades act like that?
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:12:52 fuck
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:13:12 ^
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:13:13 How do we?
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:13:30 It doesn't use melee combat
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:13:33 and guns well
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:13:35 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:14:50 hmm...
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:15:02 They seem to stand still for a moment every time they want to fire at something?
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:19:40 stalkersanta381 thats his name right
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:19:52 oh well
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:20:10 im just gonna take the opportunity to quit plane crazy forever considering i never use private servers
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:20:41 at this point
i think the best course of action might involve direct moderation instead
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:20:55 problem is
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:21:00 only one with moderation powers is rick
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:21:28 yeah, that's the problem
plane-crazy 2020-12-02 20:23:19 nah i think just being in possession of a omni bug should just be a fucking ban
they're so fucking cancerous they don't belong in plane crazy
creations-chat 2020-12-03 20:04:59 When it comes to building in my case, I just build. If I'm trying to replicate something, I'll usually have it loosely based on something real. In context to the updated version, All that was really changed was stuff around the cockpit, mainly trying to make the motor lock less obvious. Oh, and the overwing hardpoints were removed.
creations-chat 2020-12-03 20:11:29 I honestly always feel overwhelmed by the amount of stuff I have to learn just to make something that looks good. I just wanna enjoy building and I can't find the motivation to learn let alone build anything more than basic motor lock. I just wish I could make things that look good without having to bang my head on a wall for 25 minutes just for a small aesthetic improvement that probably wouldn't even matter in the first place. Then again, Plane Crazy isn't my home.
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 00:03:49 i think
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 00:03:53 it might be a DDOS attack but
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 00:03:55 i'm really not sure
plane-crazy 2020-12-04 00:04:12 "service disruption" is apparently their reason this time

creations-chat 2020-12-08 16:36:55 Wait a moment. Now I know that <#384025409945337856> is on looks but hear me out on this one <@456226577798135808>. You should use super rockets instead of jet engines for interior propulsion.

general 2020-12-15 14:25:08 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 23:33:28 if that thing has a worse like to dislike ratio than my terrible looking EF2000 ripoff then i'm gonna feel mildly annoyed

plane-crazy 2020-12-18 23:40:17 <:sip:735797763966632026> i wonder, in pcc, why are jet engines so heavy
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 23:40:20 like
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 23:40:53 why are jet engines in plane crazy so darn heavy? just a bit confused on that
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 23:41:09 ah
plane-crazy 2020-12-18 23:41:39 <@!195253906333368320> i can take that it's fine

bot-central 2020-12-18 23:45:11 I dare say this
bot-central 2020-12-18 23:45:14 but you must
bot-central 2020-12-18 23:45:15 be ranked
bot-central 2020-12-18 23:45:19 in order to suggest things
creations-chat 2020-12-18 23:57:36 <@!444221616524754954> i suggest not self upvoting, the community doesn't really appreciate self upvotes and it doesn't help you in any way

plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:14:11 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:14:41 Every shredder user is a menace to plane crazy and should be eliminated at top priority

plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:15:21 <@292578772333363200> my shitty ef2000 ripoff can make good work on shredders
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:16:08 Lmao
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:16:45 ^
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:17:05 Honestly though
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:17:20 I feel like I want shredders to stay
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:17:44 Because I get a huge feeling of satisfaction from killing the little buggers
plane-crazy 2020-12-19 06:18:21 I literally make my planes to fuck with shredder users

creations-chat 2021-01-05 14:39:39 To be honest, if there's one thing i don't particularly like about Maurinis' bismarck, is that i don't remember the real bismarck having a bulbous bow but maybe it's just me
bug-reports 2021-01-05 14:42:41 You can just replace the camera i believe
creations-chat 2021-01-07 13:21:43 ^
creations-chat 2021-01-07 13:25:03 On another note, totally tempted to make VX-23 in the crimson squadron colours... <:Hmmmmmmmm:785037192502050816>
creations-chat 2021-01-08 16:03:07 <@!766841196534169612> Now, I'm not sure if you can do this due to weight balancing issues, but I slightly suggest moving those two large rockets back a block and then motor locking two jets of the same size into the original position of the rockets. That should hopefully look better, and there's more stuff i can't really talk about just yet due to music class starting back up! Good luck and have a nice day! Just a bit of feedback from me, aka probably the worst builder here
creations-chat 2021-01-08 16:05:33 Nah, i put time into my builds but i never really put effort into making them look particularly good. Especially my most recent designs. Older builds got me to designer 3
creations-chat 2021-01-09 01:04:40 You're welcome. <:ayyyyeee:757256135215546449>

creations-chat 2021-01-13 15:44:08 A little bit of a quick tip is try to motor lock an outline to the wing so it makes the jagged outline smoother. But that's just me.
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 04:13:44 Yeah
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 04:13:51 I've seen one in combat
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 04:14:19 My immediate response was try to verbally abuse them in chat until they left
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 04:17:11 And it is one of the few reasonable responses.
plane-crazy 2021-02-09 04:17:17 Anyways, night

creations-chat 2021-10-20 16:36:02 Looks good, bow seems a bit sharp tho. Try to make it less sharp
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 21:37:31 i would say make the sides a tad bit wider if you can
plane-crazy 2021-11-04 21:37:48 but i don't have a good view of the top so i have no way of knowing
plane-crazy 2021-11-09 16:20:03 Taken away by police I think
