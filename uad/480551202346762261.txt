creations-chat 2019-03-27 20:50:56 Oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:51:49 If you were a dummy you wouldn't know this crap
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:52:41 😂
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:53:49 Looks similar
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:54:02 To me it does
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:54:31 That explains it
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:54:47 What's the new propeller blades for?

plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:56:36 What do you mount them to
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:56:47 Kk
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:57:21 This is why you never ask a pilot to see things as if they knew nothing about planes
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:58:28 Well not all of us are older than 18
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 20:59:31 Wait your a airliner pilot and ur not older than 18?
plane-crazy 2019-03-27 21:00:54 Someone should do a poll 😂

plane-crazy 2019-03-27 21:21:37 Lt look in in-game chat
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 00:23:53 I built a vtol today
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 00:24:30 All I got to do now is add a under carrege so I can reverse space x and lift lifeboats out of water
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:00:05 I wish they would increase the building spaces
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:00:26 Then I would build a flying aircraft carrier
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:00:35 Do it
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:01:00 Oi
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:01:10 I never cared in the first place
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:02:22 I wish I could join lol
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:02:59 Seems legit
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:05:41 Interesting name for a bot
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:06:52 Is there a ornage color for plane crazy
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:07:15 Huh
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:07:29 Can't get to colours
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:07:54 🤦
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:08:17 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:08:44 I posted one today but I frogot to add a photo of the block count
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:08:58 It was over 200 block ship that can float
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:09:18 The boat one does though
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:10:33 I would've got novice if the votes on my creation were likes instead I got 6 dislikes and no likes 😎
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:11:23 Let's go 8 dislikes and no likes on my creation xd
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:13:48 Since I can't access colors Wich color is ornage on the color picker they look brown and red to me
the-dump 2019-03-28 01:14:28 
the-dump 2019-03-28 01:14:35 How task manager works
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:15:43 😂
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:15:56 Love that game
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:16:16 Getting a flight stick for it as soon as I can afford the one I like
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:55:46 What should I do to my vtol to add a lifeboat recovery system but not look ugly
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:56:20 It's 2 and a half 1x7s long
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:56:34 And about 1 1x7 wide
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:57:17 Not a bad idea to do a airdrop boat
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:57:42 Just gotta build a plane to do that but we also don't have rails to slide it
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:58:36 What kind of plane should I build for airdrops
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:59:02 Have a friend load a car inside with parachutes alright Bois where we dropin
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 01:59:48 I don't think a f22 is good for airdrops unless it's the item being airdroped
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 02:00:27 Hoping it doesn't pull the parachutes down to fast and they rip or it's to hevey
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 02:01:32 I was actually thinking about building a boing 747 sky aircraft carrier but the building spots aren't wise enough
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 02:02:34 Oof
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 02:02:38 I type to fast
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 02:02:45 Too*
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 02:03:12 I could use folding but I honestly don't think it would look as good in my opinion
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 02:03:47 Odd
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 02:04:11 I had that happen to me before on a battleship I was building but I couldn't move it down
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 02:05:40 Idk
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 02:06:59 So let's see I'm making a lifeboat recovery craft who wants to help me test  it at some point when it's done
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 20:24:15 Are they gonna add a fuel line to transfer fuel?
plane-crazy 2019-03-28 20:24:44 If so I have some good ideas
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 00:05:17 Seems legit
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 00:05:43 🍿
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 00:06:37 Interesting

plane-crazy 2019-03-29 00:07:31 Oh no not ban fest
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 00:12:56 What should I add to my pontoon boat besides deployable life rafts
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 00:13:35 I might add a radar and have the moter set to w
plane-crazy 2019-03-29 00:18:07 I wonder how I should build my cargo ship
