The Tale of flaresau (239857891492757504)
general 2020-04-30 09:09:36 just curious if questions can be asked here.
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:10:45 I know that the ballast blocks make your craft heavier, but does it add more armor?
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:11:22 Or are there any blocks that'll make your craft have more armor?
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:22:47 Just curious if ballast blocks can provide more hitpoints than regular blocks.
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:23:25 Well, in terms of durability.
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:23:50 I want to make **thick** armor.
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:24:59 What happens if it gets destroyed on my craft?
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:25:56 That's OP.
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:26:30 
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:26:37 Trying to give this a buff.
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:26:44 It gets taken out wayy too much in the air.
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:26:58 Yeah, uh.
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:27:22 It's a bit outdated since it was flying with just engines and rockets.
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:27:36 But now it'll be retrofitted with the new hover thrusters.
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:27:47 For some reason I didn't see them...
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:34:49 Composite armor wouldn't work against lasers.
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:34:59 But they would work against rockets or custom rockets.
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:35:20 Or really just against any explosion.

plane-crazy 2020-05-02 19:58:07 not sure, but its **not** in the block section
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 19:58:50 its just a interactive part that opens and closes whenever you click on it
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 19:58:59 you can also key bind it, i think
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 19:59:10 uh?

plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:00:30 actually no
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:00:36 6-8 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:00:55 yeah, it would
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:01:03 you'd need extra space to put more details
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:01:19 the front of the plane is kinda weird
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:01:44 i mean 6-8 should give plenty of space for interior
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:01:58 you can also use decals
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:02:58 no, because majority of the religious people who play roblox are christians and catholics
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:03:13 just dont hang it upside down
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:03:15 lol
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:04:39 you should use half blocks for the exterior if you want to keep it concealed
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:05:26 at least you're not using f3x building tools
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:06:20 a lot of planes had an external payload in post war
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:06:52 id suggest using half blocks then
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:06:58 <@456226577798135808> i do
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:07:09 well, you see

plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:07:37 and i write exotic stuff
plane-crazy 2020-05-02 20:07:47 so i can humiliate people with my writings

the-dump 2020-05-02 21:48:15 YES OFFICER THIS MAN RIGHT HERE
general 2020-05-02 21:48:57 because the car has more aesthetics than the submarine
general 2020-05-02 21:49:35 the car looks better than the sub
general 2020-05-02 21:49:53 it has more details than the sub
general 2020-05-02 21:50:19 so does the car
general 2020-05-02 21:50:54 what would your creation getting upvoted do for you?
general 2020-05-02 21:50:56 lol
general 2020-05-02 21:51:48 well, yeah it's your first build
general 2020-05-02 21:52:14 it's just lacking aesthetics
general 2020-05-02 21:52:31 aesthetics is the style of your creation
general 2020-05-02 21:52:49 huh
general 2020-05-02 21:53:05 ^

general 2020-05-02 21:55:05 i mean anyone can build
general 2020-05-02 21:55:14 my first creation was horrible
general 2020-05-02 21:55:25 everyone hated it
general 2020-05-02 21:55:33 but i kept building
general 2020-05-02 21:55:40 and gradually i got better and better
general 2020-05-02 21:57:06 is your submarine historically accurate?
general 2020-05-02 21:57:27 is your submarine based on a real one?
general 2020-05-02 21:58:28 uh, theres no reason to call other creations trash
general 2020-05-02 22:00:42 this has taken a real side turn lmao
general 2020-05-02 22:01:05 bruh
general 2020-05-02 22:01:51 to be fair you insulted someone's creation
general 2020-05-02 22:02:07 very epic
general 2020-05-02 22:02:44 i am certified builder

general 2020-05-02 22:12:25 the animation is pretty good
general 2020-05-02 22:12:34 imo it looks natural since its choppy
general 2020-05-02 22:12:58 the first one seems kinda weird because the aiming reticle is just on your screen
general 2020-05-02 22:14:01 i see those everywhere ngl
general 2020-05-02 22:14:27 damn that's good tho

the-dump 2021-10-31 01:23:47 It’s been 24 hours without GPO… I don’t think I’ll live to see UPD 4.5. I’ve been trying to Rokushiki dash to my classes. Stealing Magu’s I find in the cafeteria even when people tell me they’re “just bananas”. I tried to impale my teacher and gripped this kid I saw in the gym for bounty. Soon as he got gripped, I see marines are coming to my location. I don’t know what to do anymore. Skin has been crawling without having my fingers touch my keys and use moves. My index finger is twitching without using my 50 dmg m1’s. I’m starting to hallucinate. Every black person I’ve seen looks like the npcs on Sphinx island. My principal looks like Captain Zhen and I could’ve sworn this girl had her weave built like a kraken. Speaking of krakens, I hear the ocean every time I go into the hallways, and become anxious I might get picked up and flung. I need Roblox back, ASAP. Eventually my ticks of randomly saying “there’s a Suna user on me” will become outbursts. My random sword swing motions will happen with a pencil…. I don’t know how many I may slay. Phoeyu… I need GPO. My life isn’t the same without it.It’s been too long without GPO. It feels like years. I can already feel my mind going numb, by the absence of this game. I cant sleep. I wake up to the noise of the devil fruit notifier yet GPO is not open... My mind is playing tricks on me. I cant go on for much longer. I’ve begin to grind irl. I’ve murdered my family for xp I’ve found several devil fruits in my cupboard. I’m starving for GPO. I cannot hold it in anymore. This world has truly become hell.

the-dump 2021-10-31 01:32:12 This.... This is it... this is the 41st hour of my life without playing Roblox.  I do not know what is real.  I can no longer tell right from wrong.  My moral compass has left me in it's entirety.  I do not know if I need food anymore.  Everything I see, touch, feel, smell, all remind me of Roblox.  I saw a man eating a cheeseburger, and was instantly reminded of the "Cheezburger" gear on Roblox... I saw a man hold someone at knife-point, and all I saw was Murder Mystery 2.  It has gotten so bad to the point where I need to ask the strangers I see if what they are doing really is a "Roblox" reference or not.  The man with the knife I was talking about earlier?  I stopped the robbery mid way through, and asked him "How many chromas do you own?".  He seemed to be incredibly dased, and did not seem to have a single clue as to what I was talking about.  A few seconds passed, and I asked him again, "How many chromas do you own...?".  Again, he hesitated in his answer.  I did not feel like dealing with his rather offensive and silent disposition he had towards me, so I revealed myself as the "sherrif" and shot him 7 times in the chest, and 4 times in the head.  As his wriggling, nearly lifeless corpse fell over, I asked him one more time,  "How many chromas do you own?".  This time he uttered his last words, before being ruthlessly dragged to a painful death: "I own three...".  Finally satisifed with my answer, I nonchalantly walked aware from the murder scene (yet another Murder Mystery 2 reference!).  Fast forward to now, I am in my Jeep (one that has an eerie resemblance to the free model one you can use inside of roblox) and am traveling at 60 studs per second to San Mateo, California.  Whatever David Baszucki can do now won't save him.  I am out only for blood, and no object, no human, no security system is strong enough to stop me from sacrificing him to John Doe to bring back Roblox.  This is it
