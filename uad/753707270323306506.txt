help 2022-03-16 02:33:30 The circle goes one block at center line, wedge 1 *3, wedge1 * 2, wedge, then repeat backwards without the one wedge, the nose so far goes 2 wedge 1 * 4, 2 wedge 1 * 3, 2 wedge 1 * 2, wedge, half wedge down

help 2022-03-16 02:49:12 Then I have some cone
help 2022-03-16 02:49:31 And that‚Äôs not a zeppelin
help 2022-03-16 02:49:51 Do you have any idea the amount of space that would be taken up by the angle lock?
help 2022-03-16 02:50:03 The circle is 17 blocks wide and the plot is only 51

plane-crazy 2022-04-18 20:25:04 Did you not read the last message?
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 20:25:15 ‚ÄúNothing I can do about it‚Äù
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 20:25:20 Suggestions already out
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 20:28:28 See I used the asterisk because that‚Äôs what you do type a multiplication in a calculator on a computer. Math stops using x as multiplication eventually it‚Äôs sort of habitual to use an asterisk instead
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 20:46:51 See dimensions are written that way because of how area is calculated, it‚Äôs multiplication either way
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 20:59:48 It looks fine
plane-crazy 2022-04-18 21:00:02 Better than anything I‚Äôve built so keep going

creations-chat 2022-04-20 21:49:01 I don‚Äôt think the rocket would have to be too terribly big  to fit it

plane-crazy 2022-04-23 15:10:10 Build the largest space station you can
plane-crazy 2022-04-23 15:10:22 Entirely by launching it on rockets
plane-crazy 2022-04-23 15:10:52 Instead of building the space station and flying it up with a built in propulsion system
plane-crazy 2022-04-23 15:11:08 Just separate modules launched up on rockets
