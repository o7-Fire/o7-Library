plane-crazy 2022-02-01 03:35:34 i was going for this
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 03:39:26 wh-
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 03:48:47 wonder if it'd be possible to make a gamerip enderdragon using alts
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 03:49:11 pixel for pixel
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 03:49:28 huge huge
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 03:50:08 sounds like a glitchy pain even if it was done
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 04:14:31 what kinda van
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 04:15:38 here's the progress on the back of my impala
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 04:19:00 fair enough
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 04:20:03 at least you know that if it flys, you can still call it a plane
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:33:49 hate when this happens
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:37:02 how odd, it seems to be a ghost block
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:37:14 it doesn't even move when i move the build
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:38:43 i deleted everything and that one block stayed
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:39:28 build something solely to destroy it out of anger
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:39:50 that's amusing
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:41:11 the hell
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:44:09 fun
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:46:51 
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:48:07 
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:53:07 currently moving this all the way back over to that ghost block so i can try and delete it
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:53:53 it still moves as it would if it was in your plot
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 18:54:07 just for some reason in the middle of the map
bug-reports 2022-02-01 18:55:42 
bug-reports 2022-02-01 18:57:55 you can use them in case you run out of 1x1 blocks
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 20:57:31 
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 20:58:47 never happened
plane-crazy 2022-02-01 21:01:13 impala'a done, just gotta make it move now

plane-crazy 2022-05-14 20:51:59 i wonder if any of you know what this is
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 20:52:46 heh
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 20:54:25 here's a better look at the first room
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 20:55:52 
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 20:56:26 and the last room
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 20:56:40 mhm
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 21:14:01 yup
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 21:25:15 to sum it up, there was a virus that threatened humanity, but the animals were fine so scientists tried to make the remaining humans into animals but it spun outta control and thus the latex beasts were created which assimilate humans into one of them
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 21:26:08 and the music is nice
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 21:30:15 more or less semisolid
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 21:41:53 we won't truly know until someone eats the wall
plane-crazy 2022-05-14 21:46:27 **tasty**
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 22:27:04 always fun getting sent into the ninth dimension
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 22:50:32 it isn't a punishment, rather entertaining
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 22:51:01 also, i knew for a fact someone would react this way
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 22:54:23 not sure you noticed that
plane-crazy 2022-05-18 22:54:57 protogen
plane-crazy 2022-05-27 20:22:26 
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 21:49:16 
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 21:49:31 it's a work in progress, but i'm happy with it so far
plane-crazy 2022-05-31 21:52:23 similar to a grand national
plane-crazy 2022-06-02 17:43:09 ouch
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 01:01:43 i made it bigger
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 01:03:44 looks like something mor made
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 01:06:44 morix
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 01:07:01 used to be friends with em
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 01:07:14 they made immensely detailed jets
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 01:08:05 it needs a gun
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 01:08:46 still neat
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 01:09:16 neat gradients
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 01:11:47 this was the tiny one
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 14:52:41 can any of you help me figure out how i made this shape?
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 14:52:46 i forgot
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 14:54:58 it's on these too
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 15:00:55 upon further inspection, it's locked right here
plane-crazy 2022-06-08 15:04:02 that's apparent
