plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:45:29 ik for a fact the fuselage is the right size
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:45:35 not the wings tho

plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:48:21 bro i said the wings r too small
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:48:40 i did a pic to pic comparison of the ground crew to the fuselage
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:48:47 fuselage is perfect
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:48:51 NOT the wings
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:49:16 if i do that its gonna be underscaled believe it or not

plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:50:18 trying to make dumb ppl understand is almost impossible and i keep forgetting that
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:50:23 cya

plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:53:15 i do
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:53:31 but factually yes
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:54:00 wanna stop arguing about some random builds misscaling now?
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:54:34 yes because thats a fact not an opinion
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:54:38 as ive said many times
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:54:44 the wings r too small
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:55:03 now just accept that instead of spamming this channel

plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:56:54 im literally trying to stop the damn argument
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:58:20 aight so the result is im not changing anything on my an 225 even if ppl keep thinking its 2 short and the wingd r not too small
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:58:51 ye because they r
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 10:59:24 the front of my wing is where the main buran mount is
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 11:00:00 no the only reason ik the wings r too small is cuz ive compared it to some images
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 11:00:49 bruh i swear this is just ridiculous
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 11:01:16 ye and the wings r too small and a bit far back
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 11:01:23 get it now?
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 11:02:13 oml can u just try thinking what would happen if the wing was a bit bigger and farther forward?
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 11:02:45 thats cuz it is
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 11:02:54 now try making a plane the size of mine
plane-crazy 2020-12-06 11:03:08 and then tell me if i should take my 2 yrs to fix mine

plane-crazy 2020-12-06 11:15:01 so u would just end up wasting ur time on comparing a plane to its irl equivalent

the-dump 2021-10-18 14:07:36 use another cable like a normal person?
the-dump 2021-10-18 14:07:45 since it costs almost the same
the-dump 2021-10-18 14:08:04 and then u can actually repurpose that 2nd cable
the-dump 2021-10-18 14:08:11 if u want
the-dump 2021-10-18 14:08:47 ye exactly

plane-crazy 2022-08-14 16:09:46 massive improvement (dont ask y its a to be continued meme its the only pic i have of my old one)
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 16:12:36 its actually an e42 from turboprop flight simulator lol
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 16:12:45 my friend made it
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 16:13:16 its fine its pretty hard to tell from that far away anyways
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 16:14:11 only exception is that 4 engine propeller beluga thing
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 16:14:26 nah he made this ages ago
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 16:14:41 and we both r heavily against tutorials
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 16:15:16 id rather have to fly a box with wings than make a tutorial
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 16:16:26 bad cuz u sent it earlier
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 16:16:33 stop trying to get attention that hard m8

plane-crazy 2022-08-14 16:18:15 i didnt know china made a ww2 fighter
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 16:18:27 based on a mustang
plane-crazy 2022-08-14 16:27:55 welp
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 19:21:50 she needs landing gear and the ability to fly itself but this improvement is astronomical (also this is the only pic i have of the old one dont ask)
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 19:22:59 thx for nitpicking
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 19:23:09 i dont have space to fix that btw
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 19:23:38 right
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 19:24:08 the entire nose
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 19:24:30 yea i rushed that one a bit
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 19:26:14 i might try to improve it sometime but im not sure if i can given theres almost no space to motorlock left
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 19:26:51 but either way this thing is wayyy sexier than before
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 19:28:44 wonder how many others made actually good an225s
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 19:28:53 like better than the tutorial one
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 19:29:21 well at least thats more than the amount that exists irl
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 19:29:35 sadly
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 19:29:49 damn u know him too?
plane-crazy 2022-08-15 19:29:56 i havent talked to him in ages lol
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 09:00:19 ladies and gentlemen the new beast flies
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 09:00:45 massive improvement
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 09:03:14 the old one was 6k blocks
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 09:03:18 the new one is 9.1k
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 09:03:48 and yet unlike the old one
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 09:03:59 i somehow have enough space to carry an external load
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 09:04:12 tho idk what to add on the back
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 09:04:22 i dont wanna add the shuttle cuz thats boring
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 09:04:38 id like some ideas
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 09:07:14 ?
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 09:08:42 the plane?
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 09:18:55 i want something that wont fit inside the plane tho
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 09:18:59 a parade of cars will
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 09:19:06 hmmm
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 09:19:19 train would probably fit inside
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 09:20:13 i want something on the back
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 09:20:21 u know where the space shuttle went
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 09:20:42 except something that isnt a space shuttle and wont fit inside the plane
plane-crazy 2022-08-16 09:20:51 but would make sense for the plane to carry

plane-crazy 2023-04-17 13:40:43 its worth trying to learn first
creations-chat 2023-04-17 13:41:26 rotated motorlocks are the best option
simply cuz of the difference in reliablity
creations-chat 2023-04-17 13:44:06 it doesnt take that much space
but thats the best tip i have for u
its up to u what u do with it

creations-chat 2023-05-03 14:06:40 id love to make the interior a lot better but i literally dont have the space to do so
creations-chat 2023-05-03 14:17:59 blame?

if the build isnt perfect it gets downvoted till it reaches hell
thats why it doesnt matter to me

creations-chat 2023-05-03 17:19:55 welcome to the plane crazy community (oh dont worry about that. thats an average response here.)
creations-chat 2023-05-03 17:24:44 anyways it says to contact staff if someone is toxic so <@335599526414909451> does that response qualify?
creations-chat 2023-05-03 18:20:06 u play scrap mechanic?
nice
creations-chat 2023-05-04 00:08:57 yea these guys expect u to be a hall of fame level player
creations-chat 2023-05-04 01:10:24 when did i complain? i already said it doesnt matter to me
creations-chat 2023-05-04 01:12:32 i never blamed or complained
all i did was tell my friend what i thought of the situation
it wasnt directed at anyone else
and i dont care about HOF at this point
creations-chat 2023-05-04 01:14:45 i havent seen any equally big an225s at least with the proper proportions
theyve always been either a bit smaller or didnt have thick wings
and there arent many an225s in the first place
so i made this last year
creations-chat 2023-05-04 01:16:48 damn yall are rly toxic
u know this level could affect someone right?
creations-chat 2023-05-04 01:18:52 further proving my point
much appreciated
fyi till now u havent told me a single piece of feedback on the plane
creations-chat 2023-05-04 01:21:16 and thats what i was explaining to jake in the first place
<@835005635359801406> how is mid interior supposed to point out whats wrong LOL
anyways imma watch oshi no ko
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:10:41 why are you like this?
this "feedback" isnt helpful at all
if ur gonna be toxic at least tell me whats wrong with my plane
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:36:14 ive been playing the game for like 5 years now and my best piece of advice is build at ur own pace
build something that satisfies u and not the community
ur gonna be the one using ur build the most
the community is only gonna see it once or twice
and at this point they will be toxic rather than give proper feedback
at the end of the day this is a sandbox game, its made for building what YOU want to build and how YOU wanna build it
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:39:28 im asking HOW does the interior need to be fixed or WHAT i should change
not should it be fixed or not
and u needed someone else to point it out for u
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:42:06 i said that to jake to explain to him why im getting so many downvotes
i never even spoke to u
and plus u havent given proper feedback and have just been continuously toxic to me this whole time for no reason
proving my point of the community being shit
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:44:16 i can take downvotes and ur the one not able to take whitenames
uve already lost this argument
ive said multiple times that i was explaining to jake why i got so many downvotes meaning u have no business in it
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:46:17 i dont care about the ones ignoring ur feedback here
im directly asking u for the reason u dont like my build and what specifically i should change
if u "dont wanna waste braincells" arent u just the same as the ones ignoring ur feedback?
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:48:19 theres some progress, specify what to change.
lets start with the nose
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:51:38 oh damn i actually missed that
ill see what i can do when i come back from school
thx for the feedback (finally)
creations-chat 2023-05-04 02:54:00 well dont assume that everyone is the same as those braindeads since that makes u no better than them
got harassed for 2 days straight asking for feedback
creations-chat 2023-05-04 03:00:29 problem with builds that barely fit in the plot is theres almost no room left and i cant add the needed rotation locks to fix a visual issue and that just TANKS the vote
creations-chat 2023-05-04 07:54:16 how about i ignore u instead <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
