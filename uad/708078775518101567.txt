general 2021-05-04 11:45:02 😳 😡 😡
general 2021-05-04 11:46:18 That's what ur mom did last night.
general 2021-05-04 11:46:49 I'll have you know that I am indeed not 12.
general 2021-05-04 11:47:57 Dayum.
general 2021-05-04 11:52:57 I'm working on a Maersk Montana.
general 2021-05-04 11:53:28 Yeah I should do that.
general 2021-05-04 11:55:31 Aa I can't find out how to do that.
general 2021-05-04 11:58:30 <:pain:644301805534183464>
general 2021-05-04 11:58:57 Sad.
general 2021-05-04 11:59:56 <:Yikes:704804144657203220>
general 2021-05-04 12:05:07 Yeah.
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 12:12:46 The supreme Plane Crazy player.
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 12:13:47 His intellect is simply beyond our understanding.
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 12:19:01 Only thing left to do is try and hide the motorlock, but you've probably tried that already.
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 12:19:42 I see.
general 2021-05-04 12:20:04 That seems like a pretty sad life just to run away from an education.
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 12:20:31 That took up a lot more space than I anticipated.
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 12:32:30 Definitely, the cabover isn't that bad but it's not that good either.
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 12:32:54 I think it's mainly due to the colours used.
general 2021-05-04 12:39:35 Very chonk.
general 2021-05-04 12:43:58 You gotta make the hull look more 3D, not just a rectangle with pointy ends but with some shape that resembles the ship. It's also a little too tall. As for the superstructure it's also pretty tall and thick looking, you should make the deck heights shorter or scale down all of the decks entirely.
general 2021-05-04 12:45:49 If all you're looking to do is get upvotes then idk what to tell you man, but it's not about that.
general 2021-05-04 12:46:41 Hate to break it to you but "your own taste" is what others would call an amateur failed attempt.
general 2021-05-04 12:48:51 Cargo ships are super easy to make if you're a beginner at them.
general 2021-05-04 12:49:23 Ship gang. 😎
general 2021-05-04 12:49:52 Epic.
general 2021-05-04 12:51:48 Blueprints and wire frames are key.
general 2021-05-04 12:52:21 Man's gonna make a whole school lmao.
general 2021-05-04 12:53:52 ew
general 2021-05-04 12:56:17 Yeah you gotta fix that hull.
general 2021-05-04 12:56:46 Yeah it is pretty short.
general 2021-05-04 12:57:09 How many folds do you have on it?
general 2021-05-04 12:57:28 Both are as wide as possible?
general 2021-05-04 12:57:48 THen how the heck does it look that short?
general 2021-05-04 12:58:20 Between the two sections?
general 2021-05-04 12:58:47 Yeah that's fine.
general 2021-05-04 12:59:03 I think it's mainly because of how tall the hull is, that's what makes it look so short.
general 2021-05-04 12:59:46 Stop it, get some help.
general 2021-05-04 13:56:20 "gorilla warfare."
general 2021-05-04 13:56:25 😳
general 2021-05-04 15:28:08 Lololol light mode lmao lmao lamo ajahahajshhkwljf
general 2021-05-04 15:32:52 Things got super heated.
general 2021-05-04 15:34:10 Now it's time for you to go work at sea for 2 years and then come back a new man after your midlife crisis is done.
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 17:31:40 Then putting disconnectors shouldn't be a problemo.
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 17:33:04 Oh I see.
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 17:33:06 Hmm.
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 17:33:11 Yeah idk then.
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 17:34:06 Maybe use pistons to get the conveyors to the same height as the disconnectors that make up the tracks so they wont block it from touching the ground.
plane-crazy 2021-05-04 17:35:05 Yeah, it's your choice.
general 2021-05-04 18:46:27 mfs when people are stills arguing about the prequels
general 2021-05-04 18:51:19 *Think again infidel.* <:thoink:657279634563399720>

general 2021-05-05 12:42:04 You must be on a potato pc if it can't run plane crazy man, like jeez.
general 2021-05-05 12:43:00 https://tenor.com/view/political-tww-starboard-politics-gif-18079403
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 12:43:36 You could make a sort of locking mechanism using motors or pistons.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 12:43:43 On the inside of the ship.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 12:44:24 Something like this using a motor to put it in the hole.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 12:47:03 It'd hold together because it's a literal lock, but magnets are easier to use and better.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:14:35 More of a boat I guess.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:20:08 It's tough to get by there anymore.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:20:25 LOL
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:20:47 Because nobody's ever seen anything creative like that before.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:21:08 The reason why most good planes get downvotes is because everyone's seen that crap already.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:24:24 I've never seen it before.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:34:41 Motorlock problems?
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:35:19 What I do is break random blocks around the motors until it works, then I replace them properly because most of the time it's a wrong block placed somewhere.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:38:34 I mean it works so.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:40:01 Then you didn't align them properly.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:40:28 Well you just said it's not aligned so...
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:41:39 Rank has nothing to do with it, I joined yesterday.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:43:06 Could you send a screenshot?
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:44:26 Mhm.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 13:46:21 Definitely.
general 2021-05-05 13:50:11 Stormworks.
general 2021-05-05 14:51:09 At one point everyone has made a giant rectangle with tons of rocket engines on the back and using ONLY delta panels for wings.
general 2021-05-05 14:52:58 bush
general 2021-05-05 14:53:29 That's actually not too bad.

general 2021-05-05 16:08:38 Seriously though stop pinging me.
general 2021-05-05 16:09:11 bruh
general 2021-05-05 16:09:20 what's with the ping
general 2021-05-05 17:17:33 e
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:51:20 Spaceships are rad.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:52:55 What's peoples opinions on private rp servers in plane crazy?
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:54:06 You know Motorness?
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:54:10 The youtuber?
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:54:25 He makes some pretty rad builds.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:54:55 Anyways I'm in his private server and yeah, he does rp sometimes. Stuff like airliners and reactors.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:55:27 It gives access to most things that you'd usually have to pay a lot more for.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:56:10 I like public servers since I get bored pretty quickly when I'm in a private with the same people everyday.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:57:01 Plus you can also play with the people you want to play with, comes in handy whether you're making a yt video, rping, or just hanging out with your pals.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:57:41 Feels bad man.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:58:20 In motor's private server I actually get more lag since everyone there is experienced and have big builds lol.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:58:28 But it depends on which server you're in.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 17:59:38 Let me check if I upvoted yet, I think I did since that's a pretty neat build.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:01:10 Yeah I checked I already had it upvoted.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:01:45 <@!581412939223924767> Anyways with everyone making spaceships it'd be pretty cool if there was a sci-fi space rp private server.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:03:10 They got old fast.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:03:41 Do you know about pc military groups though?
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:04:29 Yeah lol.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:05:16 Oh cool.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:06:46 I've been thinking of making a space station for over a month now but every time I try it ends up too small or ugly.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:07:04 Like sci-fi, not like the ISS.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:08:00 My station is gonna have external docking.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:08:34 Yeah.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:09:12 Lol.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:09:25 My station is gonna be more star citizen style.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:09:41 Basically a replica of this but smaller to fit pc.
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:12:27 What build are you working on rn?
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:13:51 Are you in Keth's Shipyard?
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:14:09 Oh wait yeah I know you.
general 2021-05-05 18:15:20 The next Einstein, his lever of intellect is too great for our understanding.
general 2021-05-05 18:15:43 <:pain:644301805534183464>
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:16:31 No
general 2021-05-05 18:17:55 *Oh no, I suppose 98% of the pcc's builds should be downvoted because they were copied from real life.*
general 2021-05-05 18:19:12 He probably think's it's some sort of abstract art with a deeper meaning lol.
general 2021-05-05 18:20:15 This cube guy is a literal clown lol.
general 2021-05-05 18:20:48 <:thoink:657279634563399720> And the people of culture are the ring masters.
general 2021-05-05 18:21:35 Has anyone asked him why he posted a white cube yet?
general 2021-05-05 18:22:59 His logic is super flawed, he's literally saying that mostly everything here is trash because it was copied from real life.
creations-chat 2021-05-05 18:23:42 Ah so this is where that clown Emir is lurking.
general 2021-05-05 18:24:06 We are all trash guys.
general 2021-05-05 18:24:17 Omg we should all get banned for copying.
creations-chat 2021-05-05 18:25:49 <@!634037409020903444> About the white cube, why?
creations-chat 2021-05-05 18:29:13 By that logic literally everything in plane crazy is bad because it copied real life. Something has air? Automatically bad because real life has air and it copied real life.
creations-chat 2021-05-05 18:32:23 When the <#504436696021204992> is sus. <:trollface:775024642104229898>

general 2021-05-05 18:44:59 This guy think's that you tried to ripoff the design because you didn't credit the zeppelin war devs lol.
general 2021-05-05 18:46:10 No.*
plane-crazy 2021-05-05 18:49:28 hi
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:30:15 Zeppelins themselves are even rarer.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:31:51 Barely anyone has tried to make a cargo ship.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:32:26 K but not a lot of people build it still.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:33:29 Bismarck is overrated.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:41:23 Which part to you have trouble with?
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:41:47 Not bad.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:42:42 Looks like some pretty extensive motorlocking.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:43:33 There's a ship basics video that should help with the capsizing part. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zggkmSzuoIY
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:44:34 You mean not capsize?
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:46:33 That's what she said to you.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:47:17 <:trollface:775024642104229898>
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:48:02 It appears you have won, but at what cost?
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:51:36 Yes virginity is cool, remain pure. <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:54:57 Idk do you want something that looks tactical or something that actually works as camo?
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:55:54 Bigger target tho.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:56:37 If you put greyish-blue colours on the underside and green colours on the top to match the ground it'll actually be somewhat effective.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:57:51 I guess you could use it and call it an experimental cloaking technique.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:58:07 But stuff like the engines and seat will still be very visible.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:58:33 How has nobody thought of that before? Lol.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 11:59:42 K send a pic when ur done.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:04:34 I say redo the cockpit alltogether.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:04:55 SHOW
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:05:47 YOO
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:05:54 Can you do the same to the wings though?
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:07:09 Are you able to camo the wings?
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:11:11 darn
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:11:11 The white is more transparent
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:13:46 
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:14:41 Since the wings wont work you can motor lock a bunch together so it looks like there's only a few wings, that way it'll be harder to see still.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:18:53 White has proven most effective in any scenario, if it's black then it'll stand out in the day but if it's white it works both day and night.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:19:37 Interesting terminology.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:20:11 Any glass plane is gonna look weird as heck.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:21:24 <:thoink:657279634563399720> Special ops pro aerial stealth unit.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:22:00 It does work to some extent, now if we just paint the wings sky color it'll be almost invisible.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:23:22 "Elite Stealth Aerial Unit" sounds badass.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:24:31 Elite Aerial Stealth Corps.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:25:41 Bad Ass Low Launch Stealth Aerial Corps. = Ballsac.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:26:48 Did you try the painted wings yet?
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:28:57 Cease to exist please and thank you.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:30:06 "khaka"
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:31:10 Why do you want to know that?

plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:34:38 Yes indeed, I called your mother the most gay of all gays.

plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:47:03 Let's see it in the air.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:48:47 I think the colors could be a little more accurate.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 12:49:04 You did it before tho
general 2021-05-06 12:50:40 Closed the tab before it played sucker.
general 2021-05-06 12:57:31 Not funny.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 13:01:03 Color could be more accurate but it does kinda work.
plane-crazy 2021-05-06 13:02:08 Why does nobody make the Fitzgerald even though it's just as famous as the Titanic? I've never seen one in plane crazy before.

creations-chat 2022-01-24 12:21:18 I consider 30 upvotes with less than 10 downvotes a success
creations-chat 2022-06-02 15:03:18 <@723940197456281640> my guy that’s not a schooner
creations-chat 2022-06-02 15:06:53 Schooners have tall lengthwise sails, yours just has square sails. Not only does it look like a banana, it’s not even what you say it is
creations-chat 2022-06-02 15:09:42 Yeah I heard you the first time, just saying maybe you need to get your eyes checked or something because that’s like super embarrassing
creations-chat 2022-06-16 18:58:12 This man puts the crazy in plane crazy honestly

general 2022-09-08 19:03:35 Queen Elizabeth II way the ceremonial queen of Canada
general 2022-09-08 19:04:17 Canada is independent but is still classified a dominion under ceremonial British royal family rule
general 2022-09-08 19:05:37 That was before the queen even was a queen, it wasn’t up to her. Treat her like a human being
general 2022-09-08 19:08:03 Have some respect ong y’all so immature
creations-chat 2022-09-12 12:08:29 <@639374429532717056> yo I love the concept of your build

creations-chat 2022-09-16 18:13:39 He’s shitposting dummy
creations-chat 2022-09-16 18:15:43 But look at all those details in the forehead, that’s not just a sand texture, he motorlocked those massive wrinkles in. Even with the exposed motorlock you have to give the build credit where it’s due
creations-chat 2022-09-16 18:18:51 <@784197207125000202> you’re an inspiration to the plane crazy community as a whole and me personally, builds are just amazing, so realistic it looks like a picture

creations-chat 2022-09-17 02:16:07 My reaction to that information
creations-chat 2022-09-22 01:30:00 Well it’s the most I’ve done in a small space, so it’s a new experience for me
creations-chat 2022-09-22 01:34:26 If I can have some suggestions that’d be great but there’s nothing useful about shitting on others builds just because you can do much better
creations-chat 2022-09-22 01:37:08 L opinion then

creations-chat 2023-04-13 17:10:35 Wow that’s a great plane crazy creation <@456226577798135808>, what’s the part count and how did you make it fly?
creations-chat 2023-04-13 17:27:46 The downvotes are from those who are jealous of your build skills manzis
creations-chat 2023-04-14 12:43:35 It’s called a trash build bro 💀 imagine using a religion to defend against people disliking what you make
creations-chat 2023-04-14 12:47:14 My brother that 20 minute, 50 part build is an insult to Islam, no disrespect but if it was done right I can assure you that it would get more upvotes regardless of religion
creations-chat 2023-04-14 12:49:32 It IS you being way too religious, 15 year old extremist “fight for my country” debating politics on roblox martyr looking ass
