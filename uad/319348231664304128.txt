general 2021-07-25 03:25:42 Someone discuss something pointless with me
general 2021-07-25 03:26:55 Caesars legion in new Vegas is better than the NCR
general 2021-07-25 03:27:35 Yes man is too flimsy to ever be a valid option, I'd sooner choose Mr house
general 2021-07-25 03:28:47 Yes man is the player ceasing control on their own; it is ultimately doomed to anarchy
general 2021-07-25 03:29:16 Ave true to Caesar
general 2021-07-25 03:30:23 Caesars legions campaign promises came true under his rule, unlike certain other factions.

general 2021-07-25 03:36:10 Lol china is the largest threat to the continuation of human race.
general 2021-07-25 03:36:44 I personally think they have alot more nukes than public knowledge suggests
general 2021-07-25 03:38:15 Unlikely; their industrial and militant expansion make that counter to their interests

help 2022-02-25 22:28:52 I'm working on a helicopter and got a few questions.
 1. How do you make those cool sliding heli doors I keep seeing on other builds? 
2. When I ascend, my front tilts up, and opposite when descending. How do I fix this without thrusters? I consider using anything other than motors and aerodynamics cheating.
help 2022-02-25 22:38:31 I've done a very stable no thrusters heli in a quadcopter desing, and it works great, but Im struggling to make it happen for a single rotor.
help 2022-02-25 22:57:15 Alright, and as for the tilting issue?
help 2022-02-28 17:40:53 What's the ebst kind of propulsion for a very large battleship?
help 2022-02-28 17:42:25 Aight, I'll goggle that conveyor engine.
help 2022-03-05 04:41:36 Pvp question, I am making a battleship, and I plan to have a drone on board, but I also want to have a guided missile on board. Are there any designs that can reliably hit fast moving targets like jets?
help 2022-03-05 04:43:00 I have the back third of the boat to work with
help 2022-03-05 04:43:01 
help 2022-03-05 05:27:07 I was more wondering about payloads. The issue I have with guided missiles is they bonk the opponent and detonate but don't deal any real damage.
help 2022-03-08 05:22:38 Whats the difference between legacy and normal rockets?
help 2022-03-08 05:22:42 Is one better?
help 2022-05-28 01:26:04 Im building a quad heli airship
help 2022-05-28 01:26:11 and it has an interior cargo bay
help 2022-05-28 01:26:22 and I need some dimensions of yalls smaller ground vehicles
help 2022-05-28 01:26:31 so i can get an idea of how big the inside needs to be
help 2022-08-08 21:54:26 Im building a battleship for PVP mode, And I want to add a harpoon missile. Preferably something with a clusterbomb sort of detonation I can use to take out aircraft. Any good designs/tutorial videos? Picture of the boat included to show the space I have to work with.
