general 2023-07-13 22:37:36 damn, I didn't get the message that the new hat was out and I missed it, at least I got the motor hat
general 2023-07-19 17:27:11 What was the new update?
general 2023-07-19 17:27:43 does anyone know what the update was 4?
general 2023-07-19 17:28:06 It said it was a bug fix
general 2023-07-19 17:28:18 ?
general 2023-07-19 17:28:56 you mean like when you press C it changes between the 3 cameras?
general 2023-07-19 17:29:02 because that always happens to me
general 2023-07-19 17:29:16 someone thought they added superspeed
general 2023-07-19 17:29:27 even though it was in the game for ages
general 2023-07-19 17:30:48 so they fixed a bug I didn't even know about but they didn't fix motor wobble or the weird glitch with the delta wings?
general 2023-07-19 18:42:28 nice
general 2023-07-19 18:43:03 the looks take away from the pvp capability tho
general 2023-07-19 18:52:16 I honestly will never attempt angled lock, the only time I did use it was for my Ranger from Interstellar. You guys are too brave.
general 2023-07-19 18:54:17 hella na
