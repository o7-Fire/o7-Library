general 2022-08-05 19:35:27 People always be hating on the bfg/sfg. Should they really be hated on though?
general 2022-08-05 19:43:05 Ngl NTW is just better
general 2022-08-05 19:43:32 From a non-controversial stand point
general 2022-08-05 19:43:49 Wait
general 2022-08-05 19:43:58 what about cannon ball + can cannon?
general 2022-08-05 19:44:17 it's got 1 shot kill + speed + decent reload time
general 2022-08-05 19:44:23 only down side is velocity
general 2022-08-05 19:44:47 the reload time is d e c e n t
general 2022-08-05 19:45:08 about on par with heavy snipers
general 2022-08-05 19:45:25 plus you can switch guns and it will still reload automatically
general 2022-08-05 19:45:37 pretty sure it's a glitch but it makes it 10x better
general 2022-08-05 19:46:10 can cannon
general 2022-08-05 19:46:35 not only is it a meme, but it's op
general 2022-08-05 19:46:43 it has no right to be so powerful
general 2022-08-05 19:47:06 Specifically can cannon + cannonball
general 2022-08-05 19:47:52 It really only has 2 downsides, reload speed and velocity
general 2022-08-05 19:47:56 thats about it
