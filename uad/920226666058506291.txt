creations-chat 2022-10-08 14:44:16 why dont you try to build the prydwen
general 2022-10-11 22:58:29 finally
i finish my recreation of the Prydwen from Fallout 4 in plane crazy 
it's a shame that i cant upload the image
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 23:03:52 i cant beleave that it took me more than 12 hours to make the prydwen(or something like similar)
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 23:04:25 how can i upload images?
help 2022-10-11 23:09:08 how can i make this thing lift? i have put helium blocks in it but nope
it doesn't lift
help 2022-10-11 23:09:56 (i use anchor blocks to put it in the air but without that, it falls)
help 2022-10-11 23:12:32 ok i'll try that
thx
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 23:17:12 what is that? i dont find any form of plane on that
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 23:21:32 i can't understand how people make planes xd
the only thing that i made and  is kinda similar to a plane is some kind of prydwen and it doesn't lift
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 23:25:28 why it doesn't exist a block that it doesnt stick to other? or some block that can be painted in half?
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 23:25:55 what
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 23:26:07 the 0.9 doesn't stick to others?
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 23:26:33 yes thats what i want
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 23:27:24 damn
i wish i knew that before
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 23:27:58 yes but i mean a block that you can paint in sections and no in the sides
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 23:28:32 like if you could stick half blocks and paint it
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 23:28:47 i have no idea of how motor lock works
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 23:29:19 hold up
my brain can't hold all of that information at once
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 23:30:25 why is my nose bleeding?
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 23:31:13 i thought i was capricornio
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 23:32:19 or maybe my brain couldn't hold all the information of how the motor lock works
plane-crazy 2022-10-11 23:34:46 maybe later

general 2022-10-12 19:27:13 yeah but i get my wood from the moorning wood
general 2022-10-12 19:27:47 so why should i need a 150% power axe if i can kill a bunch of mini bosses to get dark and spooky wood?
general 2022-10-12 19:28:26 i know

general 2022-10-12 19:34:12 yes
general 2022-10-12 19:34:44 the king slime is easiest

general 2022-10-12 19:38:48 how long do you make your hellbridge?
general 2022-10-12 19:39:48 use the obsidian blocks from the tower to make the platforms

general 2022-10-12 19:41:03 yes but i mean
