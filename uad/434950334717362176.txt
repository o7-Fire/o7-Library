general 2021-12-13 12:28:51 Hello i'm 12 years old I might get a Skype account but i'm not sure. I have a sister and i'm her brother, you might know me as CuntDestroyerMC. I have some ranks on some other servers and I help people on the server that I have donated to. I have tried to apply for one, but they would not accept me because they are some pf the bigger Minecraft server like Hive and Wubcraft. I haven't donated because I want to save my money for things that I want to get for my Youtube like Adobe Photohop, ect. And remember i'm 9 so I don't swear. I'm also sorry if my grammer or spelling is a bit off and remember i'm only nine years old. One of the reason I would like to be a mod is because, I just want t help people. I'm a very nice kid at school and I a A+ student. I hope you will respawn to this post soon and thanks for the great server. Keep up the good work.

general 2022-06-13 21:23:14 yes thats the point
the-dump 2022-08-09 14:52:29 My name is [redacted]. I'm 19 years old. My house is in [redacted] where all the villas are, and I am not married. I'm a student and I don't smoke nor drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
