The Tale of Jeff_D (545015944301510668)
bug-reports 2019-02-13 21:14:47 I keep getting removed from this Discord...   Okay, here is a glitch: The landing gear don't respond to retraction once you launch, and they retract when turning.
help 2019-02-13 21:15:40 What does reset do on the motors?
help 2019-02-13 21:18:09 How does it get activated? I turned it on in the settings but it doesn't do so.
bug-reports 2019-02-13 21:21:47 They also turn even when steering is off

bug-reports 2019-02-13 21:49:06 Idk. I used the same account but that might be a Discord error
bug-reports 2019-02-13 21:51:42 Oh it might have been the unclaimed thing. There is also a problem with that :/

bug-reports 2019-02-16 15:25:42 Sometimes, large builds fail to react to keybinds (maybe due to lag)
bug-reports 2019-02-16 15:26:48 Spawning large builds also sometimes causes it to spawn half submerged underwater. Super annoying for anchored builds.
bug-reports 2019-02-16 15:58:48 Light automatically shut off at some time
