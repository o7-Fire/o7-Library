plane-crazy 2021-12-10 23:42:09 Any tips on making an engine w/ pistons move without having a motor spin them all the time?

general 2021-12-14 04:55:06 In the context of a mod saying "what he said is right" to me in relation to someone who just told me to ping rickje like 7 times I think you could understand the confusion.
general 2021-12-14 04:55:26 Even if the thing you were saying was right wasnt that
general 2021-12-14 04:56:21 yess but the way it was presented in comparison with the convo already in place was very confusing

plane-crazy 2022-01-01 01:21:35 Wouldnt a sideways ejection seat be completely fine
plane-crazy 2022-01-01 01:21:46 Like angled up 5 degrees to go up
plane-crazy 2022-01-01 01:22:39 Angled bro
plane-crazy 2022-01-01 01:25:02 Ejecting the seat to the side angled 5-10 degrees upward would ensure no harm to the pilot and still being able to clear most terrain circumstances

plane-crazy 2022-01-01 01:30:44 Half your plane cant just get shot off
