general 2022-09-04 02:09:42 Remember how people said that pc2 was gonna be released in December 2021
general 2022-09-04 02:12:38 Yes
general 2022-09-04 02:12:45 And that never happened
general 2022-09-04 02:17:52 Small malfunction
general 2022-09-04 02:18:03 I can't say minor
general 2022-09-04 02:18:14 It wouldn't let me say minor malfunction
general 2022-09-04 02:18:28 Nice
general 2022-09-04 02:18:58 My highest kill streak was 14 kills in the F105
general 2022-09-04 22:59:39 I wonder when Pc2 is going to be released
general 2022-09-04 22:59:49 It's been over a year since it was introduced
general 2022-09-04 23:00:29 I had just finished freshman year when it was introduced, and I'm just starting junior
general 2022-09-04 23:00:46 Understandable
general 2022-09-04 23:01:49 Don't tempt me
general 2022-09-04 23:04:17 I wonder if my first 2 accounts are still in this server
general 2022-09-04 23:04:31 What?
general 2022-09-04 23:04:42 Yes
general 2022-09-04 23:04:59 Forgot password for first 2
general 2022-09-04 23:05:17 The second one got banned though
general 2022-09-04 23:05:28 I had left the server before
general 2022-09-04 23:05:34 No
general 2022-09-04 23:05:36 From discord
general 2022-09-04 23:05:47 Over something someone did In a server I was in
general 2022-09-04 23:06:06 Need an explanation?
general 2022-09-04 23:07:03 Ok
general 2022-09-04 23:07:15 Just letting you know, I had nothing to do with it
general 2022-09-04 23:10:08 He also since has been arrested
general 2022-09-04 23:11:12 Someone posted a video of them killing an 11 year old girl
general 2022-09-04 23:11:25 And tagged the entire server
general 2022-09-04 23:11:33 No
general 2022-09-04 23:11:51 They kidnapped, and killed an 11 year old girl
general 2022-09-04 23:12:19 Yes
general 2022-09-04 23:13:06 It was them
general 2022-09-04 23:13:20 Most likely
general 2022-09-04 23:13:27 Because the guy was 16
general 2022-09-04 23:13:46 I knew his voice
general 2022-09-04 23:15:29 Kinda weird to post it on discord though
general 2022-09-04 23:15:49 Ok
general 2022-09-04 23:17:08 Once pc2 comes out, I'm planning on building the IAR 95
general 2022-09-04 23:18:10 A lot more than that
general 2022-09-04 23:20:05 What's so bad about that
general 2022-09-04 23:23:34 I forgot how to get image perms
general 2022-09-04 23:24:17 I would rather not
general 2022-09-04 23:25:01 Damn
general 2022-09-04 23:27:31 No seriously, how do I get image perms
general 2022-09-04 23:27:56 Oh wait
general 2022-09-04 23:28:04 I already have image perms
general 2022-09-04 23:28:28 That's my plan
creations-chat 2022-09-05 01:18:22 I meant F15E
creations-chat 2022-09-05 01:20:32 Discord made me downsize it, not my fault, also like I said, it's old.
I don't know what I was thinking at the time
creations-chat 2022-09-05 01:22:40 I was wondering the same thing, (it's zoomed in a little
creations-chat 2022-09-05 01:24:43 152?
creations-chat 2022-09-05 01:27:43 Most of my builds take 1-3 days
creations-chat 2022-09-05 01:58:50 You could try using springs instead of tnt
creations-chat 2022-09-05 02:01:07 I don't use either very much
creations-chat 2022-09-05 02:11:33 1x1 deltas
creations-chat 2022-09-05 04:35:25 This what you meant?
