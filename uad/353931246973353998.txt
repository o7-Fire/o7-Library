The Tale of aprevis (353931246973353998)
help 2020-05-21 00:45:04 So I have this ship and it has two folds, but for some reason on the front fold it always glitches out - like they just come apart randomly and then go back together
help 2020-05-21 00:45:20 I don't know if this is something to do with the torque of the fold motor?
help 2020-05-21 00:45:31 But if anyone knows how to fix that would be amazin
help 2020-05-21 00:47:04 yeah hang on, ill try and replicate it
help 2020-05-21 00:47:25 sometimes it takes one to two minutes to start happening
help 2020-05-21 00:48:42 it also happens with my zeppelin, maybe im just doing folds wrong
help 2020-05-21 00:48:45 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
help 2020-05-21 00:50:58 ok i managed to capture it as a gif -
