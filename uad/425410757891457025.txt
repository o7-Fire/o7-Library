general 2020-11-12 00:35:42 Imagine, doors and sliding doors update
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 17:44:15 I made a working bus (first attempt dont judge) 554 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 17:44:41 I said it’s a first attempt lol
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 17:44:55 Well if they added sliding doors it wouldn’t be a block
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 17:46:38 It would be better if sliding doors were added
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 17:46:43 So it wouldn’t be a full block
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 17:47:03 Or those doors that like fold in half
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 17:48:15 Yes
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 17:48:39 I tried to make a working or semi working helicopter before, but I’m not good at it
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 17:49:00 And this helicopter has a lot of detail
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 17:50:15 But doesn’t work
