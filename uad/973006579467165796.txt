creations-chat 2022-06-05 16:20:56 it's a stereotype that people think white names are dumb asf cus they're new
creations-chat 2022-06-05 16:30:00 White and purple would be a better combo for color
creations-chat 2022-06-05 16:35:23 I like faded lines, like dark purple to light. Try that
Makes builds look VERY nice
creations-chat 2022-06-05 16:37:25 Maybe add some snow camo? Because why not. If it's mostly white it should have some form of camo for snow
Purple needs to be in selective spots, that's why it looks worse
creations-chat 2022-06-05 16:41:01 Mostly spots that have a clean line across the jet. It only looks good for some builds
general 2022-06-05 16:49:11 imagine pc2 releases on d-day

general 2022-06-06 17:43:16 He mostly has synapse. Synapse can just insta-steal builds and he can go into roblox studio to copy them. 
Jokes on him though, synapse logs your roblox password, and basically steals ur ip with all this fancy stuff
general 2022-06-06 17:43:33 L
general 2022-06-06 17:44:11 Just cause it's a paid executor doesn't mean it's 100% safe, and it won't even let you open the scripts despite it being 100% compatible
general 2022-06-06 17:45:12 Someone needs to ban that guy
general 2022-06-06 17:45:18 In-game
general 2022-06-06 17:46:05 the moment he steals my xenomorph dragon it's gonna be the end of him
general 2022-06-06 17:46:30 I wish IP bans existed in roblox games
general 2022-06-06 17:46:33 and vpns dont work
general 2022-06-06 17:49:24 bro he doesnt even copy that good of builds

plane-crazy 2022-06-07 16:24:58 Probably doesn't
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 16:25:06 I believe the script just makes the blocks invis
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 16:27:24 omfg please do lmaoo
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 16:28:20 Yeah, I think they just use synapse and steal the place with others builds attached
plane-crazy 2022-06-07 16:28:47 Jokes on them synapse is actually a token logger aswell

creations-chat 2022-06-07 17:11:57 <@791950688016007168> Very nice 2014. Only issue is that your 2014's arms are tiny compared to the movie. Another thing, the snout is a bit too pointy, and there are some dorsals along his tail. Other than that, best 2014 ive seen

plane-crazy 2022-06-09 19:32:32 Some of the configs
plane-crazy 2022-06-09 19:32:57 It works really well

plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:39:58 If I don't hold z it'll jsut be a regular gravity beam
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:42:06 no
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:42:14 im not gonna make a tut on a gravity beam that took me hours to make
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:42:44 I'm not gonna give hard work off
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:43:01 especially when it ranges 3 plots long and can fling small mechs mid-distance
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:43:10 that's just the power of 1 GRAVITY BEAM
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:43:34 I can
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:43:38 but it'd take up more space ofcourse
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:43:39 yes
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:43:46 it's finely tuned just enough
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:43:59 but that's the most stable and best version
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:44:08 bro
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:44:12 you give me horrifying ideas
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:44:59 the suspensions all have their own unique settings
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:45:01 so does the trails
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:45:47 + some extra stuff to keep it more stable when retracting
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:46:08 it never glitches out fully, just a slight twitch there and it's fixed
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:47:57 maps being remaken so i don't see the point of doing tha
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 17:58:05 it's fun to use; also hours of messing around with designs

plane-crazy 2022-06-21 18:07:08 yeah
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 18:07:21 you can even make it look like a forcefeild if you try hard enough
plane-crazy 2022-06-21 18:07:43 a lot of people use cameras for balancing

plane-crazy 2022-06-22 23:14:45 (it was a dare)
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 02:08:15 i bleieve you can indeedf
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 02:08:17 motorlock a motorlock
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:52:21 I just use roscale to make my builds accurate while it's tiny enough for me to fit in
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:52:41 like Monster Zero for instance; he's pretty damn big, but might aswell make him roscale cause if he was any bigger he wouldn't fit
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:54:03 Add wedges to make it have that rocky feel
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:55:16 i don't thinkthere's any good reason to hate mini builders
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:55:23 it's just people who like to build tiny things
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:55:30 like ???
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:55:51 theym ight like it cus of the challenge
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:56:23 I can build big things on my phone
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:58:27 Them not realizing that bigger builds = more engineering, work, and more imposing it looks
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:58:46 How cool would it be to see some giant wyvern that's mechanized from a massive scale?
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:59:07 that FULLY functions
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:59:22 that's it really
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:59:32 then they say
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:59:35 'EWW EXPOSED MOTOR LOCK'
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 06:59:48 overly long grr counts as spam
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:01:35 I prefer 0 motorlocks, and it still looks 'eh' from the front but looks very good from the side, yet it still manages to take the look as an actual ghidorah
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:01:52 good for side view but eh for front
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:02:10 helps me get the people who say 'ew exposed motorlock' outta my build
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:02:47 I SPECIFICALLY only use motorlock for either; folding or shoving mechanisms in 1 tiny space
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:02:50 it works VERY well
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:03:08 use motorlock towers like uh
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:03:22 this
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:03:27 Friend showed me
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:03:34 It automatically snaps the yellow part right infront of the black
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:03:40 it's very helpful
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:04:10 Basically; motorlock towers angled in a very specific way to make it look like it auto-folded
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:04:23 overlack
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:06:01 double it's simple
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:06:26 anyone that builds only jets/planes/tanks/whatever automatically think builds they can't make look good
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:06:30 unless it looks wack asf
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:06:52 as a mech builder
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:06:55 this looks wack ASF
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:07:02 it's just a cylinder
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:07:11 yeah thaty too
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:07:43 do you think mech building is fun at the end
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:07:45 like the payoff
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:08:18 tbh I do; even fights with shit looking mechs but good functions are fun like all hell
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:08:44 I personally favor looks *slightly* over more than function but they're basically equal
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:09:13 I already have the gravity beam, etc, all nailed down
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:09:23 I agree
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:09:24 opinion
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:09:40 I can get a gif of my grav beam rn to show how it looks
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:10:37 I know a friend named itadori
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:10:44 His harvester mech looks sick asf with the exposed motorlocks
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:11:32 No I don't, but it basically consists of a lotof latters and tech looking stuff
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:11:52 https://gyazo.com/ba97af7e65912affc294e8b097ef788f I basically made a good gravity beam that mains a trail and motors for the looks, the rest is function
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:12:08 I think it goes around 3 plots long?
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:12:21 It can fling big humanoid mechs very far distances too
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:12:26 Fun to play around with
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:15:40 I go for both
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:16:03 I want it to also look like a tounge but duals as the beam
plane-crazy 2022-06-23 07:23:27 if only
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 00:26:00 uh
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 00:26:04 what type of mech are you looking for
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 03:48:03 making a game takes a bit of time
plane-crazy 2022-06-25 03:48:28 dw it'll keep being more delayed and delayed as time goes on

general 2022-08-20 15:44:08 correct
general 2022-08-20 15:44:39 izza bit toxic now
general 2022-08-20 15:44:53 the only way is to motorlock explosives i think
general 2022-08-20 15:44:56 i haven't played in ages
general 2022-08-20 15:45:56 bruv san's gravity beam keeps glitching out despite it being the exact same as the other 2 heads
general 2022-08-20 15:47:50 not that hard once you get the hang of it
general 2022-08-20 15:48:15 yet again motorlocks
general 2022-08-20 15:48:23 just try to minimize everything
general 2022-08-20 15:50:20 istg jaws on some mechs always mess me UP
general 2022-08-20 15:51:03 lmao
general 2022-08-20 15:51:14 ghidorahs fun to make rn
general 2022-08-20 15:51:18 but the jaw GOD FORBID

plane-crazy 2022-08-20 15:52:04 <@750712383227428945> what it looks like rn
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 15:55:43 thankya
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 15:55:55 what in the world LOL
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 15:56:17 i just motorlock it for the grav beam to have enough room 2 fit
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 15:56:24 so it look s like it is currently screaming
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 15:57:30 l0ng
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 15:58:46 the hard part is me needing to make the gravity beams as glitch free as possible
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 16:00:16 yeah if i spin it too fast it glitches
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 16:00:55 here we go
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 16:01:16 adding spiral effects to make it look like lightning
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 16:01:26 also can fling other mechs
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 16:01:28 pretty comical
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 16:02:14 the only issue is that the suspensions keep getting stuck together
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 16:02:21 hopefully PC2 will fix that and i don't need to worry
plane-crazy 2022-08-20 16:03:10 motors

help 2022-11-11 21:16:06 is slate a good material if you were to have a giant mech that could fly
help 2022-11-11 21:20:52 then what would be a good scale material that is light
help 2022-11-11 21:20:54 kind of important
help 2022-11-11 21:24:20 looks kind of ehh
help 2022-11-11 21:25:35 i mean maybe i can make the underbelly plastic since it doesn't require much detail, but main scales slate and cobblestone

help 2022-11-12 09:20:52 it might need more than just helium
general 2022-11-12 10:05:24 someone got a clean asf shot on my ghidorah's gravity beam (think of a fire breath, but electric)
the guy shot the thing and the full mechanism of the gravity beam is unharmed + the pilot seat was connected with no spare parts

creations-chat 2022-11-12 15:28:04 does anyone know some good shaders? i need it to test a build render thingy

plane-crazy 2022-11-12 23:52:26 how
creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:01:23 a rite of passage even
creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:04:17 it's literally a rite of passage here like i said; in order to not become a whitename, make sure the others know you're not cringe and post an actual good build
creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:06:46 post images not videos, and post during the day and not night
creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:10:52 im still baffled on how the FUCK it has upvotes
I DON'T EVEN BUILD JETS, PLANES OR WHATEVER AND EVEN I KNOW THAT IS A DISGRACE
creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:13:07 what is plane crazy becoming the older it gets
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:14:00 what is this
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:14:10 it looks like a knockoff ver ofthis

creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:15:31 it used to be filled with good builds now it's terrible builds once people realize that upvotes are so easy to get
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:15:52 1 sec
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:17:57 im testing horn colors
general 2022-11-13 02:18:53 c
general 2022-11-13 02:19:04 do
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:20:52 im only good at making mechs
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:21:07 anything else im garbage at
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:21:32 yeah its best to hide if you're a whitename
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:21:40 they'll mass downvote you
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:21:54 i got mine from a knockoff poor dragon i made years ago that i forgot about
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:21:58 IM SERIOUS
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:22:02 HOW TF DOES THAT GET UPVOTES
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:22:18 plus what fucking shaders are those
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:23:24 im serious what shaders are those
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:23:32 i might want some cinematic shots of my ghid
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:24:40 i crave mechs of mass destruction
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:24:43 so far it's working
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:24:56 this mech can fling anything with its gravity beams no matter the size
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:25:06 it has flung and knocked back a 4 plot tall jaegar before
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:25:17 nothing can withstand it
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:25:31 it is a long range one too
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:25:42 it was suppost to be made for a cosmetic but i accidentally turned it into a weapon
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:26:53 
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:27:02 the moment that rocket grips behind your build it's done for
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:27:07 it will fling you to oblivion
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:27:17 not even shredders can cut cause how fast it goes
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:27:25 it's a weapon of mass destruction i tell you
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:27:43 it took me 5 hours of trial and error to make
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:28:23 lol you think i know how to make guns at all
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:28:53 i only know how to make organic mechs
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:29:01 except that one time i actually made a pretty cool mechagodzilla 2021 booster
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:29:12 it worked and it was one of my 'first' mechanisms
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 02:29:46 popped out of the back like folds and all; could leap in midair to basically 'pounce' on people
creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:40:55 yes
creations-chat 2022-11-13 02:50:54 god no please
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 03:00:51 there we go

plane-crazy 2022-11-13 03:03:17 yes
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 03:03:17 lots of ships fold the section next to the other
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 03:07:25 yes the neck
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 03:07:52 should i leave my ghidorah wing membrane-less; allows more movement for the wings or have membranes on them
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 03:07:56 less movement
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 18:11:27 bro really came up to me saying 'your magic is weak' when i used my gravity beams (think of fire breath but electric), then proceeded to bring out a shredder bug in an attempt to destroy it LOL
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 18:36:10 its so random too
plane-crazy 2022-11-13 20:17:55 lmao

creations-chat 2022-11-17 01:51:42 im actually debating on remaking the heads and deleting these ones, that is why i am asking
creations-chat 2022-11-17 01:53:45 if i do end up not needing these anymore im welcome to let anyone copy it or it's just a waste of effort LOL
creations-chat 2022-11-17 01:59:57 it's intentionally rigid
bug-reports 2022-11-17 03:13:28 can't run outside of the plot cus the plot itself blacklisted me
bug-reports 2022-11-17 03:13:45 https://gyazo.com/3f0537ffe5d02959a1e85c794c13fdbd
