plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:45:30 that'll be 3 sliders for motors
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:45:31 yuck
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:46:13 mmm
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:46:16 isn't that torque?
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:46:22 well
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:46:24 no it aint
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:46:28 oops
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:50:02 What's the difference between a pilot seat and a regular seat?
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:50:07 excluding the main seat
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:51:08 oh, so the creator can move between seats and control the same?
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:51:14 or is it an input for non-creators
plane-crazy 2018-12-09 03:51:16 hmm
general 2019-09-13 02:34:26 so I just found something really wierd
there's currently a place on the front page
literally just someone's default place
it's kind of old too
and there's 1000 people playing it
they all have the default skin
and in the places there is absolutely no trace of them other than in the name list
and I have absolutely no idea why

general 2019-09-13 02:34:38 anyone have any idea what's going on?
general 2019-09-13 02:37:08 yeah
general 2019-09-13 02:37:26 but it's wierd that they can't be found in the place
general 2019-09-13 02:37:45 and why would someone put bots into a place? you don't get revenue for joins anymore, as far as I know
general 2019-09-13 02:43:06 it's just wierd that it's a default roblox place
general 2019-09-13 02:43:21 my best guess is they're testing the botting or something
general 2019-09-13 02:43:38 whatever they're doing it seems weirdly sophisticated since they aren't visible in game
general 2019-09-13 02:43:42 but other people that arent bots are
