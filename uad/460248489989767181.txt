general 2020-06-15 13:36:16 Would be nice if I could make suggestions in this game
general 2020-06-15 13:37:18 Ranked?
general 2020-06-15 13:37:22 Is there a way?
general 2020-06-15 16:24:35 YESSS
general 2020-06-15 16:24:46 Hearing aid?
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 01:33:38 Yeah, because of that, I have to spend hours testing and adjusting
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 02:45:23 Is it possible to get multiple ranks?
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 02:47:51 Alright, there's my second mission, wish my luck
bug-reports 2020-06-16 06:10:13 Weird, this never happens to me, I can fire when I move, could be the Internet, there's a longer delay if it's very slow
bug-reports 2020-06-16 06:10:34 The longer the delay, the farther the rockets travel before you see them
bug-reports 2020-06-16 06:10:46 I've tested this a few times
bug-reports 2020-06-16 06:11:11 It does shoot, but the Internet renders it too late for you to even see it travelling
bug-reports 2020-06-16 06:14:46 Here's a bug I found, when I place a camera on a build, save it, load it, or even reposition the vehicle in build mode, the camera resets its direction. Might want to check on that
the-dump 2020-06-16 06:20:35 You got me ngl
the-dump 2020-06-16 06:23:06 Ohhhhhh

plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:00:40 But not long ones ofc
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:01:01 Stick to delta wings
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:01:20 Well, wings act like a wall too, to avoid too much steer or roll with the rocket
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:01:43 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 07:02:08 I can't even smile voluntarily
general 2020-06-16 07:02:39 What in tarnation?
help 2020-06-16 07:04:08 A bot will invite you to another channel,  known as a Ticket channel, the bot will ping the Supporters to ask you for your video evidence, and even evidence of any requirements for that rank. Whether you've been accepted or rejected, the channel will be deleted afterwards. Anyways, goodlyck

the-dump 2020-06-16 07:06:11 It's hard to directly set Elmo on fire with low pressure heat because his fur is made of polyester and nylon, which are known to be slightly fire retardant.

the-dump 2020-06-16 08:14:13 Hey
the-dump 2020-06-16 08:14:20 You better put some seasoning
general 2020-06-16 08:14:46 OH
general 2020-06-16 08:15:02 A good suggestion would be adding an Inverted option for control surfaces
general 2020-06-16 08:15:16 Sometimes, automatic controls rotate incorrectly
general 2020-06-16 08:15:22 Inverting it would be nice
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 08:15:44 Wha?
plane-crazy 2020-06-16 08:15:52 Impressive

plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:09:21 Wow, I've been bothered  by the trail paint bug for quite a while, I gave up on coloring my planes lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:09:45 Literally, all my builds were black
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:10:44 Would be nice if I could tune the turning speed of the wheels, when I turn with the wheels, it makes the suspensions jump, which makes my car lose control
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:10:50 Oof
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:10:55 That's a lot
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:10:56 Lol

the-dump 2020-06-17 14:16:05 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:16:12 OOF
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:16:17 SPS?
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:16:28 Studs per second?
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:17:30 It's sad that real life planes are fast with only one thruster, while plane crazy requires you a lot more to fly a replica of that plane based on the size of the blocks...
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:17:38 600 MILESSS
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:17:46 Jk
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:17:52 That's a lot faster
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:18:06 I made the F22 Raptor in game
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:18:21 And it flies at only 315 sps
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:18:39 In real life it's 1200 mph?
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:18:47 Idk how to convert that to sps but
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:18:55 It sure isn't fast enough
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:19:48 I filled the inside with so much thrusters and jet engines, it lags, if I add more engines, there's no point of using it for PVP...
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:20:01 I built the F35B earlier
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:20:05 But won't fly
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:20:38 Nice
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:21:02 Conveyer engines make me lag
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:21:13 And it accelerates unrealistically
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:21:34 And it makes my jet sway
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:21:57 Lol a lot of motors could be very glitchy at high speeds
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:22:02 Sure
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:22:05 Would be a mess
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:22:17 If it glithes
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:22:26 glitches*
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:22:44 I tried
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:22:47 Not fast enough
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:22:56 I even tested with or without drag
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:23:05 My jet is simply too heavy
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:23:20 And this laptop is simply unreliable for heavy games
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:23:32 Yes, I consider Roblox a heavy game
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:23:48 A lot of Roblox games aren't optimized really well
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:24:31 Wait, if your carrier will be amphibious, can it lay eggs?
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:24:42 Mind giving me an egg to grow my own carrier?
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:25:04 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:26:35 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:26:44 Too much thrust and force
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:27:07 Would be nice to have blocks with guns inside
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:27:24 Especially wedges and half wedges
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:27:35 My F22 looks weird with the guns on it
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:27:39 The missiles are fine
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:27:48 Idk how to make a stabilizer
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:28:02 Exactly
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:28:26 Exposing your weapons can just make others target your weakness, weapons
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:28:33 Just a wing?
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:28:56 Sure
general 2020-06-17 14:30:52 If you think that isn't offensive, then accept it
general 2020-06-17 14:31:07 Anyways
general 2020-06-17 14:31:13 Should I make a twitter account?
general 2020-06-17 14:31:26 It's time I get a more depth into gaming communities
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:32:02 I'm confused
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:32:06 Yet fascinated
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:32:21 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:32:31 Monstrosity?
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:32:51 Is that the Loch Ness monster or it's brother?
general 2020-06-17 14:33:17 I'll take that as an affirmative
general 2020-06-17 14:33:48 BRUH
general 2020-06-17 14:34:19 As soon as I opened Play Store, Twitter was on my recommendation
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:35:20 It's easy
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:35:28 Turn off PVP lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:35:29 Jk
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:35:39 Speed is a good way to outrun them
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:35:48 Never fight them with helicopters
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:35:58 Use jets with good steering
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:36:04 Hmm
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:36:34 Nothing you can do, unless you can make a high speed helicopter
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:37:08 Making a high speed helicopter is nearly impossible without risking your computer and life time
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:37:37 Lol
plane-crazy 2020-06-17 14:37:40 Poor players
general 2020-06-17 14:43:39 Yeah
general 2020-06-17 14:43:49 Lets loot the server
general 2020-06-17 14:45:03 Someone mind suggesting "Half Triange  Block 1x2" in <#507673335816126509>?
general 2020-06-17 14:45:37 Woah
general 2020-06-17 14:45:47 Does it emit RGB AIR?
general 2020-06-17 14:46:08 Oof
general 2020-06-17 14:46:10 Aw man
bug-reports 2020-06-20 12:26:12 Hey, why don't the control surfaces rotate distinctively from the front and back like it used to? You could fix this ir maybe add an X axis or Y axis invert option, would be pretty, sadly, I can't make a suggestion, but this could be a solution
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 17:28:27 Does the water jet just damage players or the builds too?
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 17:37:35 OOF
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 17:37:41 Looks nice though
plane-crazy 2020-06-22 17:37:44 But the lag
creations-chat 2020-06-26 15:41:36 Poor Pepe

plane-crazy 2020-07-05 10:16:05 Sad

general 2020-07-05 12:12:38 Would be cool tho
general 2020-07-05 12:13:07 Tbh I'm tired of having to fill a whole build with rocket engines just to make them go at a decent speed
general 2020-07-05 12:13:28 When in reality, it goes much faster, but ofc, this is a game, so not much realism applies here
general 2020-07-05 12:16:12 Lol
general 2020-07-05 12:16:20 Physics matter too
general 2020-07-05 12:16:23 rendering too
general 2020-07-05 14:27:50 Lol
general 2020-07-05 14:27:58 Drills are going to cause lag for dure
general 2020-07-05 14:28:05 sure*
general 2020-07-05 14:28:11 and softcodjnh takes forever
the-dump 2020-07-05 14:28:26 Nice cat
general 2020-07-07 17:26:32 Yes
the-dump 2020-07-08 10:45:48 I'll take it
general 2020-07-09 01:31:54 Eh
general 2020-07-09 01:31:57 Idk
general 2020-07-09 01:32:20 I've seen guys with legs that were feminine, or just thin
general 2020-07-09 01:32:27 ROOF TILING
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:33:19 It would be
the-dump 2020-07-09 01:34:30 AHAHAHAHAHAHA AK GO BRRRR
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:37:54 Both
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:38:02 Ik
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:38:12 It's actually easy to balance a plane
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:38:26 For easy lift, just add a little more mass past the lift
help 2020-07-09 01:52:35 Really?
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:54:31 Yeah, it's a different story with stealth jets and fighter jets
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:54:40 An obvious one is the F35
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:54:46 I had to use so much ballast blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:55:00 And so much engines just to produce balanced lift
general 2020-07-09 01:55:41 I like cabbage
general 2020-07-09 01:55:44 And soup
general 2020-07-09 01:55:50 You?
general 2020-07-09 01:56:01 Imagine pinginf

plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:56:27 Ghast
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:56:30 And yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:56:41 My F35 is gigantic ish
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:57:02 But I want to replicate it's rotating afterburner or thruster
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:57:07 Which was impossible
general 2020-07-09 01:59:11 MAXIMUM POOWWERRRR
general 2020-07-09 01:59:31 ACTUALLY
general 2020-07-09 01:59:38 HE LEFT THEN GOT BANNED
general 2020-07-09 01:59:39 Jk
the-dump 2020-07-09 11:53:10 The intakes also helps with lift
the-dump 2020-07-09 11:53:33 If those wings came off, the intakes can help it keep on the air
the-dump 2020-07-09 11:53:42 Though, you'd have no control
the-dump 2020-07-09 11:54:04 Ouch
the-dump 2020-07-09 11:54:06 Poor guy
the-dump 2020-07-09 11:54:09 True
the-dump 2020-07-09 11:54:15 Ejecting is deadly too though
the-dump 2020-07-09 11:54:23 So, hope that succeeds than crashing
the-dump 2020-07-09 11:54:37 Yeah lol
the-dump 2020-07-09 11:54:40 Ofc

the-dump 2020-07-16 04:42:48 It glides until you let it land
the-dump 2020-07-16 04:44:02 Can you say yes again?
the-dump 2020-07-16 04:45:02 Thanks
the-dump 2020-07-16 04:45:09 Really made my day
general 2020-07-29 08:03:06 I thought that was a map, but I realized it was a nice house someone built
general 2020-07-29 08:03:48 Kind of stinks that I need double propellers to lift my helicopter without spinning uncontrollably

plane-crazy 2020-07-31 02:25:48 Chilling
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 12:26:27 This is weird, I usually get 60 fps in this game, but now I play, joined3 servers, I'm getting lag at 1 fps
plane-crazy 2020-08-21 12:26:48 I'll be testing thisin other games
bug-reports 2020-08-22 02:57:23 <@323461377765277698> Is that from Warframe? I recognize that
general 2020-10-29 08:14:46 Why are pickles sour?

the-dump 2021-06-19 05:43:09 We sell door mats, floor mats, kitchen mats, bathroom mats, and table mats
plane-crazy 2021-06-19 05:48:16 You could try angling those wings using cameras and reselecting their targets. But it's hard to do so, takes a lot of testing and planning
the-dump 2021-07-02 07:45:32 Hm

the-dump 2021-07-02 07:55:24 THINK
general 2021-07-02 07:57:26 I thought homophobia was the fear of gay people, not hate or reject of gay people? I'm not sure
general 2021-07-02 07:57:43 Idek
general 2021-07-02 07:58:00 I thought phobia is fear
general 2021-07-02 07:58:06 e

general 2021-07-02 07:59:52 Don't ask again
general 2021-07-02 08:00:03 I don't want to do it
general 2021-07-02 08:00:07 Not to you

general 2021-07-02 08:00:50 Oh
general 2021-07-02 08:00:55 You can try

general 2021-07-02 08:01:12 A flying turret
general 2021-07-02 08:01:16 Yes
general 2021-07-02 08:01:24 no?
general 2021-07-02 08:01:32 Save a back up
general 2021-07-02 08:01:37 Just in case yk
general 2021-07-02 08:01:50 Lol
general 2021-07-02 08:02:00 Motor locks are the best thing that's happened
general 2021-07-02 08:02:26 That exists irl
general 2021-07-02 08:02:30 Guns of a gun of a gun
general 2021-07-02 08:02:37 Snej
general 2021-07-02 08:02:38 Snek
general 2021-07-02 08:02:54 Snake is snek, and snek is snak, and snak is snack
general 2021-07-02 08:02:56 That means
general 2021-07-02 08:03:04 Snack the snake
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 05:44:15 I'm a bit baffled by how little power the bigger engines provide
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 05:44:23 Their power to weight ratio just feels off
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 05:44:27 Imo
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 05:45:46 Considering how turbines size up exponentially as the chassis does, I think it'd make more sense if they provided more power, and I mean that in jet engines
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 06:10:51 Try using motors connected to the wings
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 06:11:08 You can disguise control surfaces like regular wings
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 06:11:15 But balancing your lift can be hard that way
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 06:11:38 Make sure to enable locking on those motors
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 06:12:31 What
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 06:12:34 Majick?
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 06:12:47 The magic powder?
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 06:12:51 It sounds familiar
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 06:12:55 Monosodium glutamate
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 06:13:11 I heard it goes well with soy sauce
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 06:14:08 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 06:14:27 I wish balladt blocks updated the center of mass in build mode
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 06:14:41 It's quite annoying and time consuming to find the right weight for the ballast block
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 06:15:01 ballast*
the-dump 2021-07-03 06:15:44 Thanos be eating that row
the-dump 2021-07-03 06:15:54 White crust with some purple jam
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 06:16:22 Idk how that works tbb
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 06:16:24 tbh
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 06:16:33 I struggle most with motor-controlled wings
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 06:16:57 Hence, I got a pretty bad laptop, more lag means more chances of glitching for me
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 06:17:02 And motors are no exception
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:03:22 7 blocks?
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:03:31 Can I see?
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:03:46 If you want to show
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:03:49 Ah, okay
general 2021-07-03 13:04:27 But it's better than your typical Boeing airplanes
plane-crazy 2021-07-03 13:04:59 What
