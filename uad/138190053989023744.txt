help 2019-02-18 03:46:31 Howdy
help 2019-02-18 03:47:15 Ive found a big bug in plane crazy that brings me to tears
help 2019-02-18 03:47:34 over 12 hours of work just dissapeared from 3 save spots in my save area
help 2019-02-18 03:47:59 okay
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:48:24 can someone please help me recover my 12 hours of work that dissapeared from 3 save spots?
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:48:48 they have all been rolled back to since I had rebuilt a giant quadcopter Ive been putting a lot of hard work into
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:49:19 I was hoping to finish what I got working, and its all not there
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:49:34 this bug brings me to tears
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:50:26 I was saving after a whole slew of steps in three saves many times
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:53:54 well,  I had gone and built farther and saved like mad what seems to have rolled back in the hours that I was sleeping today
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:54:33 I had a working giant quadcopter last night, and all 3 of my saves were crawled back to before I had even worked on the motors
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:56:08 my Save  data used says 260.654 and max save data 260.000
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:56:55 this is my first attempt at building something big
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:57:04 probably my only big attempt aswell
bug-reports 2019-02-18 03:57:34 my 3 saves acumulated to over 1900 parts, and there at 1433
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:03:17 I'm sorry if what I am saying doesn't make sense
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:08:10 Lots of people saw me working on it and flying it
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:08:39 and I didn't take any pictures when I had it flying, was too tired, and had to sleep
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:11:27 I can clarify that what I see in my 3 save spots is indeed my rebuilt chassis, though the majority of what I accomplished is gone
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:14:24 all my work on rebuilding 2 rear motor housings in better placement is not there
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:24:33 is it common for this game to corrupt players save data?
creations-chat 2019-02-18 04:35:04 has anyone here had a saved work rolled back on them?
creations-chat 2019-02-18 04:36:44 dang, this bug only happened to me
creations-chat 2019-02-18 04:37:22 what I saved this morning in game in 3 different slots is gone
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:47:55 I spoke about that a while ago
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:48:06 the save data
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:48:23 less than a floppy disk's capacity
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:49:23 is saving a project 3 times not allowed?
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:49:41 within the save slots alotted
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:50:58 _facepalms_
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:51:15 _face plants keyboard_
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:51:41 what is the limit, 260 bytes?
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:53:36 how the heck are people building far bigger builds than me  suceeding?!?
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:54:15 even though it asys save successfull its not really saving?
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:54:41 the heck kind of game is this
bug-reports 2019-02-18 04:56:11 and we are restricted to saving space far lower than the first IBM 5150 desktop computers RAM (640Kbytes) in the early 1980s
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:02:01 well my build wasn't that big, and it had a lot of empty space
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:02:07 inside
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:02:40 so your saying my save file on the server from this morning doesn't exist?
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:03:21 I'm just trying to understand  this
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:04:52 what I saved this morning, it told me it was sucessfully saved, will still say that even if the build is over the limit and wont actually save?
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:05:22 then those people who build boats far bigger than what Ive built are geniuses
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:06:27 I'm already sorry I tried to build something I visuallized in a game that doesn't give players a realistic allotment
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:08:30 260kbytes is all they can physically give per player?
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:09:04 not even kilo?
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:10:33 oh dont insult me like that
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:11:57 I'm going off of what you said "actually 260 kilobytes then
and the save limit isn't using bytes as the unit of measurement"
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:13:21 why do they call it that then >.<
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:13:48 the one who use that word next to those numbers in the save gui
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:14:51 I'm sorry, I thought they used bytes, having gone back in and check I was wrong
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:15:28 they dont even give us an option to delete an old build
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:20:41 I think its a bit deceptive for them to give 15 save slots instead of 8
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:22:19 thats very indirect, though I am doing that
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:23:34 my mistake was saving the thing 3 times
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:23:48 trying to keep myself from doing what I did the night before
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:24:18 having backups of ones own build on the system is no good ðŸ˜¦
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:26:41 woa, I just tested saving 1 block in each save space, it consumes a lot more
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:27:00 than what I anticipated
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:28:47 iirc this must be my second time learning this since november, I will be more careful this time
bug-reports 2019-02-18 05:33:10 I find myself going into the mysery of trying to rebuild the thing again, the right way thist time, not as a psychotic saver ðŸ˜„
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 06:44:01 why did they remove the crumbling build effect?
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 06:44:37 anyone know a trick to aligning an inner wedge?
help 2019-02-18 06:46:16 anyone know the trick to aligning inner wedges?
help 2019-02-18 06:46:20 its a pain to find it
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 07:10:43 my giant quadcopter flies ðŸ˜„
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 07:10:46 now that I save it correctly
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 09:11:12 what happened to integex?
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 09:11:24 aww
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 09:11:36 what did he do
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 09:12:06 oh ._.
creations-chat 2019-02-18 11:39:38 can I submit a picture?
creations-chat 2019-02-18 11:50:01 This truck I built back in November, its inspired from the real world "Shockwave" jet racing truck
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 12:07:51 <@!221487880487436288>  why did you leave?
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 12:08:49 oh dang
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 12:08:56 I haven't crashed yet
creations-chat 2019-02-18 12:36:50 Heres a drone I made a couple months back before building the big one
creations-chat 2019-02-18 13:05:01 dang an update
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 13:05:22 well that buffer server didn't finish its job ðŸ˜¦
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 13:05:24 we still got kicked
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 13:05:47 blue ridge mountains?
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 13:06:22 take me home
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 13:06:29 to the place, i once belong
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 13:06:54 I'm a john denver fan aswell ðŸ˜ƒ
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 13:37:11 auto clicker xD
creations-chat 2019-02-18 13:38:02 Oh yea heres my small one designed to fit in vehicles xD
plane-crazy 2019-02-18 16:01:00 LOL
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:13:38 Howdy
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:13:57 how come I can't build anymore after building part of a shell to my UFO?
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:14:13 its only a shell...
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:14:19 its within my building zone
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:14:31 the ufo is 51 x 51 blocks
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:15:08 
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:15:14 what block count?
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:15:31 it is saved
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:15:51 1894
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:16:42 
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:16:48 I am using beams.. to measure
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:17:20 press on the what
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:18:02 the building tab is open...
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:18:13 I keep getting the cannot build sound effect
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:18:29 what did I just say
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:18:44 your telling me to open something I already have open
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:19:04 i have that damn menu open gmurek
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:20:12 
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:20:15 why does it say 0?
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:20:39 we only get 1500 1x1's?!?
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:20:46 thats not enough to do a real build...
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:21:16 I will start using beams...
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:21:27 its gonna look like crap
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:21:38 I wont be able to texture the blocks in diferent colors like I wanted to
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:22:46 i still have to build an interior, and the 4 prop housings
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:24:07 a single one?
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:24:16 ah
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:28:03 do the beams minimize block count aswell?
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:28:11 oh dang
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:28:31 then my project might still be possible, if only we had 3x1 beams
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:33:08 it seems my epic quadcopter project is dead ðŸ˜¦
plane-crazy 2019-04-15 21:33:31 oh well, a giant ufo is still as satisfying
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 13:01:11 Finally I got it ðŸ˜„
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 13:04:39 Erm here we go
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 14:38:21 What do you folks think?
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 16:17:53 does plane crazy not like things sliding directly against each other?
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 16:18:18 <@!381263178589536257> I did
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 16:19:12 aww <@!381263178589536257> why did you leave? I was liking your sentry bot
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 16:20:01 of course I am
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 16:20:06 oh dang
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 16:20:16 that guy was being annoying, lots of super thrusters
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 16:21:02 I got into that game in 2015
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:09:41 
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:09:52 woa
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:10:17 who likes my jupiter 2?
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:10:46 superidra the top glass dome is not a cockpit
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:10:51 that is the forcefield generator
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:11:45 https://i.pinimg.com/originals/64/6d/88/646d887e79c86e23f8fd1b369349bbd4.jpg
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:12:57 took forever to measure out every single circle, though a minecraft circle pixel generator came in very handy
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:13:26 51x51 circle
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:15:08 
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:15:49 what does af mean?
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:18:48 eh?
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:18:57 galaxy?
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:23:30 heres the cockpit window
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:23:40 I am forced to keep the window small because of the design
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:24:09 woaa
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:24:17 is that like the only save he has anymore?
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:25:25 <@!429665143677255681> how did you make that thing only 3k?
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:25:39 my hollow ufo is is already 3300
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:25:49 including a crapload of beams
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:28:21 <@!530774331081621504> you built a fin whale?
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:29:01 oh galaxy miner...
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:29:07 naming their ships after fish o.o
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:29:32 oh
plane-crazy 2019-04-16 23:29:35 interesting
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 00:55:06 oh dang
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 00:59:33 is there a speed limit for motors now?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 00:59:40 erm a weight limit
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:18:14 Why is this spinning slow with 4 motors per rotor maxed out?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:18:37 so things wont work as they should?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:18:55 ive not felt much lag with this
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:20:12 
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:20:17 and this jackrabbit aint helping
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:20:58 erm 2nd guy away from me
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:22:44 well all the motors are spinning the rotor in the same direction
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:23:20 I know that motor on top of motor doubles it
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:23:45 why is it spinning so freakin slow with even 2 motors?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:24:08 of course
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:24:52 my humungous quadcopter spins quite well
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:25:00 so I know that these rotors are not overburdened
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:25:25 what was that?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:25:32 oh settings
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:25:38 sorry, passed my eyes
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:26:39 Bottom
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:27:11 Top
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:27:34 I know how this stuff works -_-
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:27:57 will that hurt it?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:28:11 oh
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:28:28 no toggle, I navigate with 4 keys simultaneously
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:28:36 I use toggle for a hover setup
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:28:58 I might flip the rotor blades, as I saw someone do that earlier
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:29:29 erm not flip, but position them vertically instead of horizontally
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:34:51 this aint working ðŸ˜¦
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:45:35 eh?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:48:57 o.o
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:50:15 holy macaroni
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:52:37 I hope this doesn't get patched
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:54:02 eh?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:54:19 I use bluestacks aswell
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:54:27 migrating over to anbox
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:57:52 holy macarole it flies!
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 01:58:12 with the speed glitch
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:02:15 
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:02:26 4 50 motors so a max of 200 speed per rotor ðŸ˜®
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:06:05 his face scarrs me
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:06:54 this ufo's movement is so slow with all that power, is that causing trememdous server strain?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:07:43 thats behind the car
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:21:17 wow 100 speed is not enough to keep it in stable hover, might have to try 150
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:34:03 would having a flywheel for special effects throw off balance?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:39:40 why are you using the white discord theme?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:39:45 thats hard on your eyes xD
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:41:42 xD
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:44:21 so the blue building compass is for propulsion balance right?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:44:30 and the golden building compass for weight?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:46:01 your a bit vague there
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:46:47 he didn't specify which of them are center of mass
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:47:05 okay
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:47:09 I thought so
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:47:40 my lift setup is equal, yet the blue is poking out of the yellow just a little bit
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:48:20 figorsBoy want me to join you in a game?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:48:23 so you can see first hand?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:48:45 okie dokie
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:50:48 must be rockets
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:51:27 or could it be my center of mass is out of balance
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:57:12 wanna join me?
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 02:58:13 so you can walk around it first hand
plane-crazy 2019-04-17 03:00:35 ok

plane-crazy 2019-09-02 06:02:21 if only we could set motors to 100
plane-crazy 2019-09-02 06:03:06 I can't get the level of control with twice as many motors set to 50 for the speed I am looking for
plane-crazy 2019-09-02 06:04:00 I tried putting motors upside down, and running in reverse, that just equalized the movement I wanted
plane-crazy 2019-09-02 06:05:40 HOW?!?
plane-crazy 2019-09-02 06:05:51 thats amazing

general 2020-06-07 09:00:30 wish half blocks could be combined with half blocks, to make up a unique full block, instead of taking up a full block of space
general 2020-06-07 09:44:48 whats the lock feature for on motor1?
general 2020-06-07 09:44:57 does it prevent any movement to it?

general 2020-06-07 09:54:21 wth was our save data decreased??
general 2020-06-07 09:54:37 repression is repression >.<
general 2020-06-07 09:55:53 so we have even less save space ðŸ˜¦
general 2020-06-07 10:07:24 but the save data limit could have been decreased even farther below the ratio balance :/
general 2020-06-07 10:07:48 lol
general 2020-06-07 10:11:10 or riot for combined half blocks xD
