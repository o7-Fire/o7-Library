bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:18:50 
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:19:15 me and some guy got a plot merged on the game, idk why and here is footage
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:23:16 i just left it
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:23:21 oh
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:23:40 if it comes back ill tell you
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:23:59 ill try seeing if i can add the guy i was merged with
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:25:17 okay
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:25:29 if you need his name, its sushpupy.
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:27:22 also while were still talking
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:27:28 on the train tracks
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:28:03 you guys need to make them so that all turns are able to be done and not just an edge (the switch tracks)
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:28:21 and also make them longer or something
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:28:50 also we should be allowed to get a gamepass for expanded plot or extra amount of blocks etc.
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:29:08 would allow even more creativity for those big builders
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:29:59 oh
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:30:00 okay
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:30:03 fair enough
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:30:39 cause i have so many ideas for the game that i cant even make a message cause it would go over the max characters in a message
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:31:27 ah
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:31:54 and if i drew out a map, could it have a possibility of being considered or reviewed?
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:32:30 dang
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:32:35 ive missed alot lol
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:32:46 i might still draw one even if it wont be considered
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:32:53 cause i cant resist it
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:34:50 it would be nice if there were multiple airports too
bug-reports 2020-06-17 20:34:58 that was one thing i was thinking about
general 2020-09-03 18:08:08 Ball Joints when?
