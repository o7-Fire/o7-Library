creations-chat 2020-10-19 15:51:06 see a cool thing somebody could build is a maths machine. Basically its up to 5. so say you pressed '2+3', a sign with the number 5 would pop out. Would be extremely difficult and would take a whole bunch of working
creations-chat 2020-10-19 15:52:07 I used it to build a Tiger 1
creations-chat 2020-10-19 15:53:09 pls remove slow mode ffs its annoying in this channel
creations-chat 2020-10-19 15:54:51 > <@!558344363416223754> **Never** getting removed,yes theres a height limit for building
<@!720751430595772418> why is it not getting removed?
creations-chat 2020-10-19 15:55:58 > Too many people make this channel a battlefield with pointless arguments and undes getting mad over downvotes
<@!720751430595772418> could it atleast be 30 seconds because an entire minute is a little excessive
creations-chat 2020-10-19 15:57:07 > Nope, mods say its like this to make the words more thought out, its only getting higher or staying the same, it was 2 minutes a little while ago
<@!720751430595772418> ight thats annoying but I see the reasoning behind it

plane-crazy 2021-04-10 04:31:56 I’m a white name because I can’t be asked to submit a build honestly like it doesn’t matter to me too much
plane-crazy 2021-04-10 04:34:21 I’m probably gonna go for a rank soon

plane-crazy 2021-08-21 10:40:35 I need extra details but dk what to add
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 10:40:42 Any ideas?
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 10:41:05 I see the extra tire but that looks ugly on my build
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 10:42:11 So I decided to go without it
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 10:48:05 That’s not a bad idea actually
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 10:48:17 I could make the whole thing quite scenic
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 10:54:07 Ah how about an OP
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 10:55:33 An OP is an Operations Base which were set up in the Middle East as a checkpoint and holding place for troops and vehicles so if I make an OP style environment with large sandbags and piles of sand here and there then maybe I could make something pretty cool
plane-crazy 2021-08-21 10:56:30 Yeah I tried the extra wheel on the build but it looked hella ugly so I decided not to implement it
help 2021-08-21 10:57:22 Cooln’t tbh
creations-chat 2021-08-21 11:34:59 <@!389756407483990028> maybe make the wings slightly thicker at the part where it roots off from the fuselage. I don’t mean like height, just width. Looks good btw.
creations-chat 2021-08-21 11:41:50 Sorry for the trashy drawing but red is what it is now and green is what It could be, utterly your choice though.

creations-chat 2021-09-05 16:22:59 Do you mean the small silver bit at the end of the nose?
creations-chat 2021-09-05 16:25:13 If so, it will be quite hard to implicate that but I could try with a bit of locking
