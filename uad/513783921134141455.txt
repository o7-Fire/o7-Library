general 2020-01-11 03:10:52 talk about a quick ban tho
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:36:53 yo anybody getting a problem
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:37:06 where
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:37:17 the server keeps on having a high delay in physics
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:37:23 but your fps is fine?
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:37:29 My friend says it is too
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:37:36 bro i said FPS is fine
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:37:45 no
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:37:47 not that
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:37:51 theres only like
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:37:54 5 people on
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:38:00 and they have small creations
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:38:08 its server lag from what it looks like
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:38:16 because everyone on is experiencing it
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:38:21 boi
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:38:23 i said
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:38:25 "FPS"
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:38:27 is fine
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:39:02 dude we talking about server physics
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:41:35 server delay is back to ok
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:42:25 chat shows that again
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:43:15 i knew what the zumwalts are and they seem like somewhat easier to build because of the easy shapes from the stealth
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:46:32 also found fix to crane lagging, is that cylinders, conveyors, and pistons really don't like eachother for extended periods of time
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:46:40 so i just gotta move them once and a while
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:46:56 unlike the server lag crane lag was local and affected fps
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:47:39 i have it
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:47:48 worth it if you need it
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:47:55 my internet is average3
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:47:58 average*
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:48:03 the lack of sleep is getting to me
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:48:17 doesn't really affect my play so much
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:48:22 the delay is over mad
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:55:59 obcpro has a nice 1701 there
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:56:39 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/510275245467500544/645709199439036446/2019-11-17_14-37-45.gif did you build that
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:56:54 ok.
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:57:34 best way to trigger fans
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 16:57:41 ***make the discovery***

plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:02:57 quick question, anybody know the block to helium ratio
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:04:05 ok
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:04:22 hmm
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:04:29 maybe called a hot tub or jacuzzi
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:05:01 i dont know why
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:05:04 but theres a glitch
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:05:13 where conveyors have no collisions
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:05:14 some times
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:05:31 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:06:05 I saw a dessert camo'd a-10
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:08:57 an actual heli, instead of madox's sphagetti osprey
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:27:21 still looks russian
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:27:29 you should use the other blue
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:27:36 in the color scheme
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:28:07 
plane-crazy 2020-01-11 17:28:08 that blue

plane-crazy 2020-01-12 00:24:21 so i want to fold this build. any tips on how i should do it? the crane "pulley" is moved via conveyors
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 00:25:38 i know how to fold. i'm asking specifically about this
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 00:26:42 I tried folding by having the second piece underneath the crane, which then gets spun around
plane-crazy 2020-01-12 00:26:50 but haven't founds space to do that

general 2020-01-17 21:54:19 If you have one enabled
general 2020-01-17 21:54:36 turn off your surround virtualizer in your sound system's application
general 2020-01-17 22:07:55 It's because the surround sound virtualizers always seem to kill the directionality
general 2020-01-17 22:08:04 Oh damn

general 2020-01-17 22:08:13 wait
general 2020-01-17 22:08:18 .6 ms?
general 2020-01-17 22:08:21 or 600 ms
general 2020-01-17 22:08:29 oh that's not a lot
general 2020-01-17 22:09:16 .6 ms = 0,0006 right
general 2020-01-17 22:09:22 or is it 0,006
general 2020-01-17 22:10:13 100 seconds?
general 2020-01-17 22:10:20 don't you mean 1000 ms = 1 second
general 2020-01-17 22:11:07 So it would be 0,0006

creations-chat 2020-03-23 19:04:56 Redone Mosquito XET. Great for low flying and fast but the small fuel and prop instead of proper rotors makes it look tiny and makes it fly strangely when overpowered, but still fun to fly.

creations-chat 2020-08-07 14:05:25 I just use it if i’m doing something on my PC, to make things faster
creations-chat 2020-08-07 14:07:07 I mean, i have an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU on my PC, so i could just run AS!3 while doing stuff, but AS!3 and PIPP likes to run without any other apps running. Not because it used much processing power
creations-chat 2020-08-07 14:07:25 > <@513783921134141455> What settings

plane-crazy 2020-08-07 17:06:11 because it gets in the way when landing
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 17:07:05 I tried that, with the motors
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 17:07:08 and the top of the dock
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 17:07:13 is already mostly built
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 17:07:26 but instead of having the little hut, it extends across the top
plane-crazy 2020-08-07 17:08:08 Like this.

But wasn't there one of those catamarans in Wii Sports Resort? that was literally my entire childhood playing the freeroam on that game, and that is very engraved in my brain
@n.#0737  Don’t be sorry. I’ve gotten lots of comments of that, and yeah. Based it off of that. There are plenty of differences visible though. The one in Wii Sports is more like a glorified dock at sea. I’ve put a lot more stuff into this one. Also i might remake the top half to look better.
general 2020-08-08 18:21:31 Guys look i made my telescope in plane crazy!!!

general 2020-08-08 18:47:15 pretty damn funny if they did
plane-crazy 2020-08-08 20:18:45 There has to be a feature that randomizes painted colors by a selected amount

plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:42:59 im on my phone rn, i’ll show it later
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:44:17 but its literally just the launcher itself, desert color, on a hinge with the mechanisms on the bottom, just used google images as references
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:45:20 idk, mods are pretty sus about some stuff
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:45:24 like shaders
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:45:29 <:WeirdChamp:670867805176070145>
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:45:50 that runs post processing
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:45:54 outside of roblox
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:46:01 and its nested in roblox files
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:46:17 but does not inject scripts
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:46:19 if it did
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:46:38 you’d get all those script kiddies complaining about their anti virus
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:46:43 which they dont
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:46:47 cause its legit
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:47:10 and literally does nothing of advantage in a game
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:47:35 roblox talked about it at the dev conference
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:47:47 unlockers, shaders are okay
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:48:58 they are
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:49:17 people here just listen whatever they hear
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:49:32 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:49:53 except they dont lol
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:50:25 it even turns some features off if it detects network activity
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:50:37 and those features also dont provide any advantage
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:50:41 or affect game files
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:51:00 because its literally post processing, keyword post
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:51:24 it aint gonna kill that guy who one shotted you in phantom forces or change your diapers
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:51:54 thing is the game doesnt block reshade
plane-crazy 2021-05-16 15:52:02 these people are making stuff up lol

Yeah id have to agree with the criticisms on the f22 steel but you got this
creations-chat 2021-06-14 14:46:35 Find a good reference on sketchfab, get an ortho view, and create a schematic. Find a scale and build on that. From that pic i cant tell what plane it is without you telling me

creations-chat 2021-06-14 14:52:16 <@!626036997546442763> I know you’re not gonna be working on it anymore but fuselage looks good, stabs and inlets need to be saved tho, if you were to pick it up again.
creations-chat 2021-06-14 14:54:29 (~~Delta wing.~~ my stupid ass thought you meant parallel axis)Or you can use a rotating lock / camera lock if you want a decent rudder

plane-crazy 2021-07-07 23:37:34 OV-1 or the A6 Intruder is also a possibility
plane-crazy 2021-07-07 23:37:53 The A-29 Super Tucano as well, but it isn't much of an unconventional design

plane-crazy 2021-07-10 20:04:44 Im just asking are they a decent scale for the well deck which will be inside that box
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 20:05:19 No, just not aiming for size.
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 20:05:31 Should i add an extra fold for the bow?
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 20:05:51 Cause im thinking it already looks like sufficient space for a bow
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 20:06:19 k
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 20:47:04 yeah its not a carrier
plane-crazy 2021-07-10 20:53:05 should the end of the deck angle down with a wedge or flat edge?

creations-chat 2021-07-12 11:47:56 so your style is making a decent spacecraft then splashing random bright colors on it?

creations-chat 2021-07-13 17:34:38 is it linear scaled?
creations-chat 2021-07-13 17:36:55 color transitions from yellow to brown look better with a non-linear color curve and a hint of red is what im trying to say
creations-chat 2021-07-13 20:01:02 Purple to green is the best option in terms of color theory
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 20:02:43 What helicopter should i build? preferably a seabased one
creations-chat 2021-07-13 20:03:54 If you're taking a portion out of the middle then do purple front. If you're doing a wider range of sampling points then do green first. Omit the ends though, they're a bit vibrant
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 20:04:22 That isnt a helicopter?
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 20:06:44 Sounds like a good idea. Should i also try a UH-1Y? im kinda concerned though because there are a lot of tutorials out there and im worried it'll end up looking like one for the scale i'm going for
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 20:06:58 Floats.
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 20:07:26 I know what the SH-3 is
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 20:07:46 I'll leave it for another day, i'll do the 47 first
creations-chat 2021-07-13 20:32:23 the blueprints are in ortho, the wing and stab is a bit steeper than it needs to be on the front tho
plane-crazy 2021-07-13 23:38:13 ah yes

plane-crazy 2021-07-14 20:57:17 my build is only 9k blocks rn what is he on
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 20:57:24 probably mobile
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 20:58:08 Roblox doesnt read reports they just get mad at you if you do something that flags their UGC filter somehow
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:00:53 for lagging him

plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:16:17 Prebuilts are fine, they just dont give you as much performance for your money
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:16:36 Invent the PCB
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:16:50 Wrong how
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:17:13 thats not what i said? i said for your money
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:17:51 you're paying for people to build your PC and on top of that they're usually shit combinations of parts
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:18:07 Yes
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:19:02 But for the most part this is the case. People are fine with it tho because they dont need much performance for what they do. And yes exactly that
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:19:30 blame blade
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:21:44 we were talking about quantum physics at one point

plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:35:28 triangle wedgeblock 1x3 or 1x4
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:36:02 looks literally just like a wedge
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:36:45 wdym 4 sides
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:37:26 try to draw it out in multiple angles
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:37:34 do you mean a corner wedge?
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:40:24 what do you man
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:40:25 draw it out
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:40:28 because that looks
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:40:32 literally just like
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:40:36 a normal wedge
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:42:19 triangle wedge
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:42:22 wedge block
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:43:02 wedge
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:44:10 and corner wedge
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:44:15 it can only be one of those
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:44:19 so choose
plane-crazy 2021-07-14 21:44:26 because it looks literally just like a normal wedge

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:41:49 It’s literally just a normal wedge tho
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:41:52

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:43:21 Oh
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:45:02 Is the block behind the wedge a triangle wedgeblock
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:45:03 If so
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:45:13 Your ship does make sense if thats the case
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:48:09 Add a conveyor drive on top of your normal propulsion to act as a warp drive
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:48:17 Separate keybind tho
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:49:23 Good
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:49:43 Im in the middle of making an amphibious assault ship and a helicopter but when i finish
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 00:49:51 i'll make a boring machine

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 01:08:13 im asking in advance
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 01:09:17 should it be navy blue or a rusty brown to make it look like a trash sci fi spaceship
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 01:50:19 sure its basically a spaceship cylinder with a giant bore on the front
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 01:50:44 k
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 02:23:10 should i use this or triangle wedge

plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:47:06 For some reason anchoring is splitting my build by a fraction of a block? Doesnt affect the build but its kinda weird
plane-crazy 2021-07-15 05:48:58 Its not a folded vehicle

plane-crazy 2021-07-17 23:12:07 Nah your anti shredder mechanism is most likely just unoriginal or has a flaw, no offense but that is the case with a lot of mechanisms. It isnt a bad thing in terms of build quality but shredder bug users aren’t usually in this discord but rather constantly doing R&D on their tutorial shredders

plane-crazy 2021-07-19 01:42:11 what
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 04:41:03 probably not getting expert designer anytime soon
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:16:01 Damping resists fast changes like vibrations
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:16:23 stiffness is how much force it takes to move it IIRC
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:16:53 free length is how much the suspension sits when not under load
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:17:26 remember that suspension can only move in one direction
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:18:04 I mean, thats pretty much it
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:18:25 One axis, you know what i mean
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:19:17 One suspension for the entire set of wheels means one axis
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:19:43 One for each pair of wheels means one axis but stable vertically
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:20:10 One for each wheel means it is stable vertically and horizontally, to a point
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:20:41 Itll be able to handle a slope that is different one one side of the vehicles
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:20:48 but it wont be able to do much beyond that
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:21:21 In taildragger aircraft, they usually not only suspend from up and down but also relieve force side to side
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:21:47 by being patient

plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:40:32 Multiple binded ones locked together
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:40:45 I didnt mean reload
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:40:47 i said cooldown
plane-crazy 2021-07-19 06:41:05 I can just set up my own macro
