plane-crazy 2022-06-11 10:17:06 Guys, what block should I put in corners of a rotating door to make it work ?
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 12:07:16 Guys, when I spawn my heli, I always spawn where the jet engines are and I can't exit it without deleting. Are there any options ?
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 12:08:35 Basically when I spawn, I spawn in a closed space in my heli and I can't exit it withouth deleting some blocks. Are there any other ways to do it ?
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 12:10:18 It is a closed space in my heli. Not the other way round.
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 13:54:44 Are there any blocks which only stick on bottom,left,forward and right but not backward and up ?
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 13:55:55 It will be clear if I post an image.
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 13:55:58 How to do it ?
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 13:57:47 Doesn't work.
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 14:00:42 Need a block to fill the corner, but allowing the motor to rotate at the same time.
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 14:01:35 half block does stick.
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 14:01:41 Up left
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 14:02:15 thx
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 14:40:47 An 0.5 cylinder would be good imo.
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 14:53:15 People are asking for an 1.5 cylinder. Keep in mind.
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 15:08:34 Why would you need a 1.5 cylinder when we have 1 cylinder and 0.5 cylinder.
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 15:09:20 Just stack an 1 cylinder and a sparkler.
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 15:09:32 *insert khaby lame bruh GIF*
plane-crazy 2022-06-11 15:10:09 You don't need motorlock to stack.
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 06:19:50 Guys, my heli's roll axis isn't stable !  there any stabilizers to control our roll ?
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 06:34:07 Guys, My heli always tilts to the left during take off. What should I do ?
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 07:01:28 Planning to build a shredder. *insert troll face GIF*
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 07:02:06 That's a joke due to legal reasons.
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 07:05:14 Isn't going to Jesus a good thing ??
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 07:05:26 I ain't christian.
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 07:05:33 So idk.
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 07:07:08 I am an atheist.
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 08:47:29 Guys, is there any way to stabilize the roll of my heli ?
plane-crazy 2022-06-12 10:13:21 Guys, are there any blocks which stick to the top and bottom but not the other sides ?
