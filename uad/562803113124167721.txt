creations-chat 2020-06-03 23:19:31 Stage 1?
creations-chat 2020-06-03 23:19:56 I think bc they want to be able to separate each stage

creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:37:57 Ok, I.l just make it thicker from where it is at right now
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:38:07 I think the length is almost right
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:38:28 All I really need to improve is steering and suspension and tires :/

creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:40:49 Idk what should I improve on my exterior?
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:41:15 After I make it and get the rank ima make less block version on it.
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:41:21 Yeh wider is a give
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:41:28 Given* but by how many blocks
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:41:47 .....
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:41:57 That’s a lot of build and rebuild u know that right XD
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:42:15 Oof auto correct be like
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:42:37 I used 1x4 wedges
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:42:45 So it is about 12 blocks wide....
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:43:05 The front seems right but idk...
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:43:11 Maybe I made the car too long?
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:43:30 Ok then....
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:43:38 Hmmm idk what to do about that lol

creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:44:13 Hmmmmmm
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:44:34 Maybe I could keep the wide ness but I could change the wheel base to make it shorter.
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:45:10 Shorter wheel base shorter car less rebuilding to do since I barely have any of my rear done anyways...
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:45:14 Idk what to do....
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:45:24 I feel like I made the car too long anyways.
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:45:38 So since I haven’t done to much on the back yet I might as well :p
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:45:50 Bc then it could all fit without folding
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:46:01 Then I’ll look for other cars to make

creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:47:53 Idk design for functionality
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:48:37 But do you think the turning wheels would even work bc of how laggy it is I think I’ll have to give it some steroids (super rockets) so it can turn
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:49:35 Did you check where both you Center of mass and control points are?
creations-chat 2020-06-24 04:49:49 Bc the closer together they are the more stable the flight will be

creations-chat 2020-08-13 01:42:40 I’d suggest making the base 1 block wider
creations-chat 2020-08-13 01:42:50 Then you could put ballast blocks

creations-chat 2020-08-13 01:44:27 I haven’t made a ship in a while so I’ll just make a new base somewhat based off of your current base

creations-chat 2020-08-14 18:54:19 Neeoomm
creations-chat 2020-08-14 18:56:22 Depends <@550694959011987457>
creations-chat 2020-08-14 18:56:31 Can I see the underside of your car?
creations-chat 2020-08-14 18:56:39 And just the car in general
creations-chat 2020-08-14 18:57:48 Oof your making an engine and driveshaft
creations-chat 2020-08-14 18:58:05 How many blocks of space do you have between that engine?
creations-chat 2020-08-14 18:58:10 And the wheels
creations-chat 2020-08-14 18:58:33 .
creations-chat 2020-08-14 18:58:52 So you have 14 blocks of space between the engine and the wheel? Doesn’t look like it lol
creations-chat 2020-08-14 18:59:28 Can I see the space between the engine and the wheel vertically
creations-chat 2020-08-14 19:00:08 I know 1 simple method
creations-chat 2020-08-14 19:01:02 The thinner part of the motor should be facing the wheel bc that is the part that turns
creations-chat 2020-08-14 19:01:11 Are you going to have suspension?
creations-chat 2020-08-14 19:01:32 K that makes life a bit easier
creations-chat 2020-08-14 19:03:11 So then put the motor with the lighter part facing the wheel then since you aren’t using suspension I’d build out 1 block then place the motor that turns the wheel
creations-chat 2020-08-14 19:04:32 Next put 2 pieces of suspension of either side of the motor, (left and right) then after that put pistons on the ends of the suspension facing the end of the suspension block then connect the pistons to the rest you your build so they don’t budge then set the distance to max

general 2020-09-02 23:17:26 im working on water animaton as well
general 2020-09-02 23:18:03 speaking of knees.-.
general 2020-09-02 23:18:18 i forgot that you can make limbs in blender lol
general 2020-09-02 23:18:30 i cant code lol
general 2020-09-02 23:18:35 only model
general 2020-09-02 23:18:39 im going 1 at a time
general 2020-09-02 23:18:47 i thought roblox used Lua?
general 2020-09-02 23:19:00 k god im not trippin
general 2020-09-02 23:19:09 how u gonna do dat o_o
general 2020-09-02 23:19:27 true
general 2020-09-02 23:19:48 im planning on making the round part split off
general 2020-09-02 23:20:26 while in flight, ill probably make it go in half to make it simpler because into 4 parts is too much to animate lol
general 2020-09-02 23:20:47 wdym?
general 2020-09-02 23:21:00 well i joined them together to animate it a bit easier
general 2020-09-02 23:21:34 then when i want to ill just separate it where i want it to split and ill just change the keyframes
general 2020-09-02 23:21:42 ill have to separate it in half
general 2020-09-02 23:21:55 when i get there and it should work how i want it to
general 2020-09-02 23:22:15 but the part where it will fall will be hard
general 2020-09-02 23:22:32 bc ill have to separately animate EACH part
general 2020-09-02 23:22:36 which is 2 but still
general 2020-09-02 23:22:47 a custom animation especially this is hard
general 2020-09-02 23:22:53 water animation is easy
general 2020-09-02 23:23:01 i just need to figure some kinks out
general 2020-09-02 23:23:06 yes i did
general 2020-09-02 23:23:13 well the casing will be animated as well
general 2020-09-02 23:23:37 
general 2020-09-02 23:23:47 it looks solid but it isnt, just the shading
general 2020-09-02 23:24:12 the bottom is how many points of animation there are
general 2020-09-02 23:24:22 that is the bullet's animation
general 2020-09-02 23:24:29 i like how it turned out
general 2020-09-02 23:24:46 i can show you in Hangar
general 2020-09-02 23:25:16 since i cant screen record bc game bar wont function
general 2020-09-02 23:25:18 yeah
general 2020-09-02 23:25:25 you can change its shape tho
general 2020-09-02 23:25:30 but THAT is hard
general 2020-09-02 23:25:49 you will get mad and leave it
general 2020-09-02 23:25:52 for a dat
general 2020-09-02 23:25:54 day*
general 2020-09-02 23:26:00 then come back and try again
general 2020-09-02 23:26:11 it took hella tme for me to figure out how to move a cube lol
general 2020-09-02 23:26:30 i quit for a week then this server motivated me to make separate parts
general 2020-09-02 23:26:34 such as....
general 2020-09-02 23:27:18 barrel block
general 2020-09-02 23:27:25 it would work if there was a gun remodel
general 2020-09-02 23:27:30 but there isnt
general 2020-09-02 23:27:35 so ill make a conceptual model
general 2020-09-02 23:27:37 wut?
general 2020-09-02 23:27:48 what? the bullet?
general 2020-09-02 23:28:00 ik but it isnt for spamming
general 2020-09-02 23:28:10 this block will be a single bllock limit if added
general 2020-09-02 23:28:19 bc it will be great for tanks
general 2020-09-02 23:28:42 it goes at the start of the barrel, then ill just make tank barrel blocks for all the bullets ill make
general 2020-09-02 23:29:04 and the limit is bc it can do a 3x3 damage radius
general 2020-09-02 23:29:12 can destroy 3 layers of blocks
general 2020-09-02 23:29:18 so like a 3x3x3 area
general 2020-09-02 23:29:28 `or 3x3x4-5
general 2020-09-02 23:29:38 i havent plkayed pl;ane crazy in a while
general 2020-09-02 23:29:42 ive been making this bullet

general 2020-09-03 22:39:11 bc it was being autistic
general 2020-09-03 22:44:47 i just had to redo the whole fucking animation after adding 1 step O_O

plane-crazy 2021-10-26 23:32:30 so......
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 23:32:47 i fixed the handling of the drift car
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 23:33:22 instead of AWD i made it RWD so that it has that uncontrollable rear end when you floor it going straight
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 23:33:42 also allows for tighter corner drifts
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 23:49:58 i can try
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 23:50:11 im putting on a basic body
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 23:50:20 ima actually try motorlocking so i can have optional trim
plane-crazy 2021-10-26 23:56:18 .-.
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 00:15:48 e z
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 02:01:00 A-10 also a very common build seen there

plane-crazy 2021-10-27 02:07:32 this camber got me dying lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 02:07:52 it still drives and drifts just fine
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 02:16:32 ez
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 02:17:30 -.-.
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 02:17:38 watch it just be unpowered motor lock
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 02:18:07 lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 02:18:29 ignore the fact that this is a roblox game and making it adjustable pretty epic

plane-crazy 2021-10-27 02:22:09 both, but it is a drift car lol
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 02:22:17 so the camber make no difference
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 02:22:58 it feels like it slides better with less tire in contact
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 02:23:20 
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 02:23:55 lol wut

plane-crazy 2021-10-27 02:26:01 ima make another one
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 02:26:20 this was mainly a base chassis to see how i could make a drift car without propellers and rockets
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 02:26:24 bc that not fun
plane-crazy 2021-10-27 02:26:30 gotta go motor only lol

plane-crazy 2021-10-27 02:31:33 short wheelbase lol

creations-chat 2021-11-02 23:41:05 lol
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:41:26 change material of tread
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:41:45 different materials have different traction, so try fabric, since it has highest friction coefficient
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:42:05 lol it fine
plane-crazy 2021-11-02 23:42:39 car wheels in plane crazy are usually fabric, but if you want to drift they are a default material i think
