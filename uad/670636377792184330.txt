creations-chat 2020-12-14 16:13:33 <@!569539731088736258> Don't Upvote Ur Own Build, People Will Downvote It Then.
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 17:07:46 Message From My Friend: "Plane crazy is dying. Nothing new. No new map to explore. Inconsistent developer with trust issues. Very poor optimization. Pvp planes broken. Balance non-existent. If this update doesn't bring anything new and exciting, then the game is gonna be dead. By dead I mean that there will only be a handful of experienced players. Sure, there will be new players, but those will die off quite quickly from the aforementioned reasons. My biggest problem is Rickje himself. For the thousands upon thousands of robux that has been donated to the man, nothing has even been added. I am disappointed that the game has gotten this low with copiers, toxicity, and most importantly, arrogance. BUILDING IS REPETITIVE. All it is is to use motor lock techniques to create a very low performing, high quality jet. I am honestly sick of the game and and it results with no rewarding aspects I quit". And I Think Hes Kinda Saying The Truth, But Im Not Sure.
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 17:10:30 He Said That He Will Quit, I Didnt Say I Wanna Quit
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 17:11:47 Ok But Still I Think I Kinda Agree With What He Said, Exept For The Last Thing
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 17:13:52 he already quit
plane-crazy 2020-12-16 19:21:35 ok.

creations-chat 2021-01-05 10:37:35 <@!389516889501728779> the tnt did clearly not hit the A10, Imao either the A10 is ur friend who exploded tnt in the A10, or Roblox physics are broken.
creations-chat 2021-01-07 03:02:30 <@456226577798135808> is it reposted? Well sorry I didn‚Äôt know. I thought I didn‚Äôt post it yet.

creations-chat 2021-01-11 02:35:27 <@!551806781609869313>  I understand, I deleted the video. I will repost it without setting my YouTube video link on it.

plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:40:13 I hope so
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:41:24 why do u wanna know the script? if u also wanna copy others, it for sure won‚Äôt help u get better at the game
plane-crazy 2021-02-07 19:44:52 so how is everyone doing so far? good? maybe bad idk
creations-chat 2021-02-22 22:45:03 first att all why is the nose so long, second why is the roof of the uper deck so high and third, why is that slobe so short?
creations-chat 2021-02-22 22:54:05 yes I know but most of the time I say slobe idk why
creations-chat 2021-02-25 17:00:31 rip next time better I guess
creations-chat 2021-02-25 17:03:47 yea ima try again later, also should I add little bit of smoke for when the main gear touches the ground? bit more realstic.

creations-chat 2021-06-26 14:38:00 I dont remember how long it took, I made it a long time ago, then few months back I made the wingtips tilt, inprove the engines and changing the hole nose.
creations-chat 2021-06-26 14:41:48 I also made a Lion Air 737 MAX 8, not many people liked it tho for some reasion
creations-chat 2021-06-28 11:45:59 I tried making it smaller, but that didnt work out so well, plus im not a expert in motor locking
creations-chat 2021-06-28 11:48:11 Also yes I have some builds that are normal size like a DC-10 I have.

creations-chat 2021-09-12 22:53:49 And wdym with wrong time of the day?
creations-chat 2021-09-12 22:56:25 When I posted that it was 9:32 PM for me
creations-chat 2021-09-12 22:59:09 So I gotta delete it and post it arround midday again? That feels kinda weird to do, deleting and then reposting
creations-chat 2021-09-12 23:03:46 About the the most toxic time of day, so they just downvote everything without inspecting it, is that what u mean with the toxicity?
creations-chat 2021-09-12 23:48:41 You mean the engine on the 777x?
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:43:50 I can‚Äôt right now because my pc is at home. If u want I can show a video of it landing with the ‚ÄòBucket‚Äô reserve thrusters
creations-chat 2021-09-15 10:46:29 
creations-chat 2021-09-15 12:37:05 Wdym with ‚Äúwasted potential‚Äù
creations-chat 2021-09-15 12:56:33 Why do you need to help with the tail?
creations-chat 2021-09-15 13:03:51 Same with me ik also alot of building, and I used a blueprint of a MD-80 and then rebuilding it ingame, so nah I don‚Äôt need your help, plus the tail looks fine
creations-chat 2021-09-15 13:05:53 Maybe because the photo is angled like that you think the tail is weird, and ye ik, but it‚Äôs the photo angle
creations-chat 2021-09-25 12:15:54 lol I created that plane like 3 years ago so yeah true its bad designed
creations-chat 2021-09-25 13:08:48 yeah because one is a tutorial and mine isnt and lol thats not me, and as I said mine C-5 is like 3 years old, im planning to change it to a realistic 1:1 scale orsum
creations-chat 2021-10-04 21:18:51 I see downvotes on my TIE Bomber window, what do I need to change to it? Since when is that an rule lol
creations-chat 2021-10-04 21:21:03 But sure I will post the rest when it‚Äôs done
creations-chat 2021-12-01 15:28:27 I took a screenshot with my mobile because when I‚Äôm taking a picture from the pc and send it, it doesn‚Äôt want to send. Discord issues
creations-chat 2021-12-01 15:30:40 Also it isn‚Äôt about the quality, it‚Äôs about the build itself.
creations-chat 2021-12-01 15:33:27 The runway is mine lol
creations-chat 2021-12-01 15:35:53 First at all ik how to take screen shots (Windows Print Sc) but when I am sending a picture from my pc it didn‚Äôt want to send so I did it with my phone
creations-chat 2021-12-01 15:38:15 The plane needs no fixing, you probably think it‚Äôs bad because your looking at it from only one angle
creations-chat 2021-12-01 15:40:29 you can‚Äôt call something bad when you don‚Äôt even know how it looks like in real life and how it compares ingame
creations-chat 2021-12-01 15:58:01 I did
creations-chat 2021-12-01 16:00:17 I do (Windows Print Sc) tho when I send it to the Discord with a picture made on the pc, it doesn‚Äôt want to send to everyone, idk why probably the new Discord update.
creations-chat 2021-12-01 16:08:36 it‚Äôs not the phone camera, when you take a photo of your mobile on the pc screen, you will always see the pixels, and you can‚Äôt see these pixels when taking the screen shot on your own pc
creations-chat 2021-12-01 16:11:01 the nose is long enough, engines are long enough and everything is fine, ur being toxic and everything u explained is nonsense
bug-reports 2022-03-08 23:12:53 hm does everyone have this issue: load in any build you have that include ballast tanks and cameras, are those settings reset to One (camera) and R and F (ballast tank) or are they still the same as you selected them
bug-reports 2022-03-08 23:15:17 1/One same thing
bug-reports 2022-03-08 23:15:21 u on mobile
bug-reports 2022-03-08 23:15:43 if ur on mobile it should say 1 I think and on pc One
bug-reports 2022-03-09 12:42:41 well how long till this gets fixed back to normal?
bug-reports 2022-03-09 15:05:16 if the game update broke it, then why just dont go back to the previous update so everything gets fixed and then redo the update?
bug-reports 2022-03-09 15:06:14 ye
bug-reports 2022-03-09 15:06:25 and there was sum with display names?
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 00:46:26 question when pc2 comes out, do you keep your save data or do you lose everything completely
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 00:46:57 ok
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 00:47:18 Cause if it doesn‚Äôt, then there is no point of me making sum good rn if it‚Äôs gonna get deleted anyways
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 00:49:05 Ive heard SharkBite 2 will come out, and they say u will lose ur data in that game because it‚Äôs gonna be ‚Äòa different game‚Äô well I hope pc2 won‚Äôt be a different game then but just a huge update
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 00:49:53 then it‚Äôs good also they said something bout infinite ocean?
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 00:50:37 Imagine if it actually does
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 00:51:07 me playing hide n seek: time to just sail away into the unknown
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 00:51:51 Ah then I gotta use my submarine, atleast if the ballast tanks work by then lol
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 00:56:31 About that I am currently working on a huge 747, I still have no idea if it even fits in the building plot but that will prob change in pc2
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 00:57:32 or ima just continue rn I have some space left to make the tail idk if the wings will fit
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 00:57:42 if it doesn‚Äôt fit anymore I will wait
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 00:59:04 I believe I started working on this like 6 or 5 months ago? reasion why I‚Äôm working so slow is 1. Took a lot of brakes from plane crazy 2. Lazy some of the time lol and 3. Ofc school
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 01:00:11 Nice
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 01:00:38 wait u ment this pic as a joke or are U actually building that in plane crazy
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 01:03:44 wait can‚Äôt u fold that
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 01:03:57 oh
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 01:04:28 ye my 747 also reached 7k blocks when 2 engines are still missing, half of the wings and tail section
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 01:05:08 this is the latest pic I have here u see the engines in the other pic u don‚Äôt
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 01:06:01 I believe my 747 is like a block more than 1:1 scale
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 01:06:30 little more fat I guess
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 01:09:49 lol now I wonder what my first build/comment is on this ima search
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 01:12:30 lol ok wth I can get why this got alot of downvotes LOL, it‚Äôs literally the same thing as the 747 I‚Äôm currently working on rn but much more bad
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 01:12:45 even I am embarrassed lmao
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 01:25:13 Idk haven‚Äôt played yet right now cuz I‚Äôm watching yt
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 01:41:53 I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a tutorial plane or not it it build a while ago after all and I don‚Äôt have it anymore I believe the nose is a tutorial, but the rest is custom made
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 01:43:59 Still don‚Äôt get why people make wings angles less then they normally are, prob cuz they are using delta wing 1x2 instead of using 1x1 and then fold the wing so instead of 90 degrees it‚Äôs like 60 orsum idk
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 01:44:23 Its 4 years old anyways
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 01:44:46 wdym u had like delta wings 1x2 and 1x1 right
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 01:44:56 oh
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 01:45:02 well that changes it
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 13:49:46 do the hover thruster on 0 drag and max speed
plane-crazy 2022-03-10 13:50:24 make sure to connect the motor with the hover engine otherwise it will break
bug-reports 2022-03-10 19:22:56 did they fix the bug where keybind controls are reset when you reload?
bug-reports 2022-03-10 19:24:59 oof
bug-reports 2022-03-10 20:01:55 still dont get how changing to summer update could have any effect on a specific block
bug-reports 2022-03-13 01:42:57 okay so the bug where camera and ballast tank keybinds dont save got fixed I think
bug-reports 2022-03-13 01:43:54 only downside I have to rebind all my controls, so ye rebinding my submarine is gonna be a pain
creations-chat 2022-05-27 18:47:31 it doesnt have a rudder so I use that to direct yaw control, for the rest, climbing, looping and spinning is not done by engines
creations-chat 2022-05-27 18:55:32 tried, plus thats the best spot for me to control it
creations-chat 2022-05-27 18:58:46 I can try to motorlock it a lil back but ye, thx for the tip
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:31:58 new plane crazy update makes me have 1 fps when spawning something on water, or just touching the water in the first place
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:32:57 how come others in my server not be affected to it then?
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:34:15 I see boats moving normally without lagging
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:36:35 cant be
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:36:51 same build as few days ago in the water normal 35 fps
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:36:57 now its 1
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:37:05 and a update happened 1 day ago
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:37:59 its weird that it coincided at the same time
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:39:09 ik but then why a few days ago and before that it was normal, then after this certain update I get my builds lagged whenever they touch the water
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:39:35 even when I drop my torpedo's from air into the water, boom 1 fps
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:39:40 before that it was normal
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:40:19 thats known I think
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:41:39 btw about this
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:41:42 no its not my device
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:42:00 I tried it on multiple devices and other wifi networks
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:42:03 still the same
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:42:48 then how come after this certain plane crazy update I be lagging to like 1 fps?
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:44:29 u wanna see a clip of me dropping something in the water at this moment
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:46:13 dropped a torpedo and fps dropped from 60 to 12, while the torpedo is less than 50 blocks this is very weird
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:46:23 useally I shouldnt have my fps so low when doing that
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:47:59 so if I drop 1 block into the water and I get my fps dropped from 60 to 10 - 15, then that is normal?
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:48:34 also my network receive and render also drop to red which useally never happens, they are always in green and yellow
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:49:46 because this issue I have happened at the exact same moment the game updated
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:49:51 thats why
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:52:02 how come? because before that everything was moving smoothly
bug-reports 2022-06-03 17:53:53 im prob not even the only one having these issues all sudden, but anyways ima just continue on without using water stuff, for now atleast I hope
bug-reports 2022-06-03 18:04:59 then im still confused with how it can be only me after this certain update, something in this update change about the water that makes apparently only me get lag spikes and 1 fps?
general 2022-06-03 18:31:02 eh whats the 'no no German swoosh sticker' in <#384025409945337856>
general 2022-06-03 18:32:08 ye what is it?

creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:47:33 then how come this exists:
creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:49:56 plus its not in the <#925099219973460008>  "wips aren't allowed" so idk
creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:53:00 wait why is that under "spam creations"
creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:57:25 still, how come I have posted so many wips, no complaining and now, there is, this screenshot is one example
creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:59:55 so every time I post a WIP, mods will go offline nice to know. also that TIE Bomber window is a WIP because it turned out into this:
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:22:18 what rank is best suitable for this?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:22:59 there isnt a "star wars expert" rank lel
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:23:14 cant
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:23:37 it uses propellers to control yaw because ye, its a TIE it has a way different wing design
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:23:42 plus it uses hover drive
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:24:16 I know that lol
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:24:31 why else would I say this
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:25:34 it can hover (kind of) it can roll, it can pitch it can yaw (using propellers) it can fly in reserve
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:25:44 and many other things
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:25:47 so idk which rank
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:26:14 lucky as in?
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:26:35 problem solved.
plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:27:39 how do I submit it (this will prob be my first rank so idk how exactly)

plane-crazy 2022-06-03 19:42:39 the $new thing
creations-chat 2022-06-05 15:57:01 you said that word yourself I see no difference in me saying it or you saying it
creations-chat 2022-06-05 15:59:03 you do realize why I said that right? you do realize that you started that argument we had? that caused us to be here right?
creations-chat 2022-06-05 16:01:19 you said sorry too late, if you said it earlier I wouldn't have 'flipped' you do realize that right? or if you didn't call my heli bad in the FIRST PLACE  I wouldnt have flipped
creations-chat 2022-06-05 16:03:43 I started it? b what? if I remember correctly you started all of the arguments and yes hes right take this argument somewhere else or just stop it
creations-chat 2022-06-05 16:06:04 what I said is wrong? look at what you said u literally said it too so I see no difference. also <@900045673758588939>  you didnt say sorry immediately after you said it was bad, u said sorry like 30 min later
creations-chat 2022-06-05 16:08:21 exactly what <@900045673758588939>  did I agree, waited till the point I got really mad then "omg mod please this guy said my dad is c** omgggg"
creations-chat 2022-06-05 16:11:36 u said it AFTER I flipped? you should have said it BEFORE I flipped, also yes in my case its worse, but those 30 min after where just straightup the hole server against me because 1 guy calling my builds a tut. and all those 30 min long I get things like "bro u have no skills, bro ur channel sucks, bro etc" no shit it was worse in my case
creations-chat 2022-06-05 16:14:53 you saying "both of you suck at building" wont really fix the argument, just giving more spice to it but yes your right, just stop this argument cuz I agree its a 10 year old argument
creations-chat 2022-06-05 16:17:00 same goes for you, he will sort us both out, because there is always a reason for someone flipping
creations-chat 2022-06-08 13:32:32 about the TIE Defender post, do I have to fix this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/775792219649998859/984085193566597170/IMG_4530.png
creations-chat 2022-06-08 13:54:36 yes that
creations-chat 2022-06-08 13:56:40 that is not the Elite version, thats the normal version of the TIE/d Defender
creations-chat 2022-06-08 13:58:54 use this to hunt them down, make sure to put on a Darth Vader suit

creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:52:20 whats wrong with the Kriegsmarine flag? that cross, is still being used today irl in the german airforce for example.
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:55:42 What‚Äôs the difference between this cross and the one I have one my ship? They are the same.
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:58:16 nobody wins, and exactly its not even a swas, is a luftwaffe cross, so me getting banned from making a cross that exists in real life now is weird
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:00:22 why would I mention that?
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:03:22 no but your comparing my flag to something that is bad while it isnt
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:06:40 if someone takes my flag the wrong way I will correct them.
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:09:00 exactly
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:11:10 with "one" you mean the swas or what?
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:14:24 also if I remove the red and white, there will be absolutely no difference the cross will still be there
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:17:57 I bet you never even seen Graf Zeppelin, it literally has the cross as well so how is mine bad and the real one isnt?
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:20:03 you said "doesn't really match the rest of the carrier" while in fact it does
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:23:19 explain how is too big?
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:25:42 here is the deck, almost exact same color as the one I am building, so why the fuck should I change it?
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:31:56 different photos with different decks, I choosed the one with the dark wood, plus u havent gave me any helpful feedback, if u did u wouldnt be saying "ohhh remove the cross its bad"
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:34:19 and I aint doing that, why? because thats not what the ship looks like
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:39:47 Alr I wanna end the argument so tell me rq, do u want me to remove the iron cross because u don‚Äôt like it?
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:42:13 I asked, do you hate the iron cross and is that why u want me to remove it?
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:44:32 https://tenor.com/view/spi-tobe-bully-maguire-i-missed-the-part-probl-gif-23922704
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:47:03 I alr changed that
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:50:22 I just dont want that because it doesnt fit in the time the ship was build

creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:56:21 I didn't learn only from history class lmao, also they didn't only do bad stuff, you do realize because of them america stepped on the moon and so much other things?
creations-chat 2022-07-20 18:59:17 "they didnt only do bad stuff" exactly because what did I just say? whats the whole reason america put step on the moon and so much other things? because of them.
creations-chat 2022-07-20 19:03:56 exactly
creations-chat 2022-07-20 19:10:57 I support them in terms of technology so what ru gonna do about it?

creations-chat 2022-07-28 17:31:40 ah yes ik that rule I have bin here for like 2 years now, now lets see. does it say "Flap + Spoiler test" or does it say "guys, this is my unfinished plane"?
creations-chat 2022-07-28 17:35:23 exactly, it says Flap + Spoiler test, which means im showing the flaps and spoiler mechanics of my aircraft. if I instead typed "guys, im almost done with my plane" then yes it would be a WIP.
