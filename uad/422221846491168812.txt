creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:25:00 Yeah duh

creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:25:28 It's pride month
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:25:40 So I decided to make a build for it
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:26:56 Lol
creations-chat 2020-06-02 19:27:43 Why are pride related things getting downvoted?
creations-chat 2020-06-02 19:28:13 :/
bug-reports 2020-06-06 04:39:16 Yeah
bug-reports 2020-06-06 04:40:08 That camera lock is pretty helpful for planes
bug-reports 2020-06-06 04:40:38 If you put landing gear on a vehicle it'll think you're making a plane
the-dump 2020-06-07 22:36:52 
the-dump 2020-06-07 22:37:33 :/
the-dump 2020-06-07 22:37:56 I literally just made it
the-dump 2020-06-07 22:38:22 But it's probably been done before
the-dump 2020-06-07 22:39:13 :/
creations-chat 2020-06-08 05:09:51 It would be cool to see more creative and unique stuff in the HOF. Stuff that hasn't been done before. Like the stuff in there is impressive but it appears to be mostly rockets
creations-chat 2020-06-08 05:10:43 It's cool
creations-chat 2020-06-08 05:10:52 A little loud though
creations-chat 2020-06-08 05:16:45 These are 4 builds that really stick out in the HOF
creations-chat 2020-06-08 05:17:42 It is pretty impressive

help 2020-06-10 19:57:51 anchor block
creations-chat 2020-06-10 19:58:50 multiple hours and 2000+ blocks just to get more downvotes than upvotes
creations-chat 2020-06-10 20:01:50 it just seems like the only creations that get good vote ratios are recreations of vehicles that exist in the real world
creations-chat 2020-06-10 20:02:11 yeah
general 2020-06-12 02:33:07 What creation?
general 2020-06-12 02:33:40 Oh
general 2020-06-12 02:33:53 It's a little confusing tbh
general 2020-06-12 02:34:08 Some parts sound like they contradict eachother
general 2020-06-12 02:34:49 More the blacklist stuff
general 2020-06-12 02:35:06 Those seem contradict eachother
general 2020-06-12 02:35:39 Wait I guess I understand
general 2020-06-12 02:36:11 The second part is about blacklisting currently let's you go through someone's build
general 2020-06-12 02:36:25 Yeah nvm
general 2020-06-12 02:37:14 👍
general 2020-06-12 02:42:22 Cool
general 2020-06-12 02:43:04 Mine is very basic and unarmored
creations-chat 2020-10-23 12:33:39 let's see if this plane that i spent hours on still gets a heck ton of downvotes
creations-chat 2020-10-23 12:37:35 wow that's lots of motor locks
the-dump 2020-10-23 12:53:18 i feel bad for that cpu
help 2020-10-23 13:04:03 well you could use motor locking
help 2020-10-23 13:05:07 guns can fire through blocks of your own creation without damaging them

creations-chat 2020-10-23 13:06:05 lol

bot-central 2020-10-23 13:07:24 do i have to have a special role to make suggestions?
creations-chat 2020-10-23 13:07:49 oh ok. 
no idea
but you can circumvent it by editing and making another line
*gets warned*
bot-central 2020-10-23 13:09:20 whats the suggest command?
creations-chat 2020-10-23 13:22:33 *clap clap clap*
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:47:50 > its a toy gun
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:48:18 you shouldn't aim anything that remotely resembles a firearm at a living being
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:48:33 so
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:48:42 that's super irresponsible
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 13:49:37 yikes indeed
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:12:40 i'm not using it to get upvotes i might make an alt livery for it that isn't one of the flags that i identify with
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 14:26:03 noice
general 2020-10-23 14:30:06 -_-
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 14:32:34 pan and bi shredder bugs when?
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:45:44 the first screenshot of my starship got 11 upvotes o=and only a couple down votes but the second got a bunch of downvotes and zero upvotes 😦
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:48:45 what else am i supposed to do to make a plane fly well?
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:49:49 and still have the wings be shape i want them to be
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:51:10 ok... but wouldn't that still make gaps in the wings?
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:52:12 can i have some screenshots of custom flaps
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:53:25 ok
creations-chat 2020-10-23 14:55:09 ok
i'll try it during lunch break
creations-chat 2020-10-23 15:03:06 think about it like turning blocks: r is yaw, t is roll, and y is pitch.. if i remember correctly... t might be pitch an y might be yaw
creations-chat 2020-10-23 15:20:31 how do i make custom wings not have a gap that's a whole block wide?
creations-chat 2020-10-23 15:21:32 ok
help 2020-10-23 18:05:59 Any tips on custom control surfaces
help 2020-10-23 18:09:00 Ok
help 2020-10-23 18:16:22 > use motor 2
What about turning
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 19:27:27 That would end in chaos
plane-crazy 2020-10-23 19:27:30 Probably
creations-chat 2020-10-23 23:42:00 I mean I've been called toxic while being agressively told to leave the server -_- for using a bad shredder
creations-chat 2020-10-24 13:49:35 > wow i scroller up to see and my u boat did like 20 times better than i thought it would
And I'm like "dang the downvotes on my starship got ahead of the upvotes" I don't know what to do to get people to actually like my creations. I feel like this community favors replicas of real life military vehicles and anything else doesn't do well
bot-central 2020-10-25 22:06:05 How do I suggest?
bot-central 2020-10-25 22:06:11 Ok
bot-central 2020-10-25 22:06:15 ?shelp
bot-central 2020-10-25 22:08:20 ?suggest
bot-central 2020-10-25 22:18:03 Dangit
bot-central 2020-10-25 22:18:13 It was just an image link
bot-central 2020-10-25 22:24:33 Wait it sent the first one anyways?
general 2020-10-25 22:24:53 Uhm sorry for the double suggestion
general 2020-10-25 22:26:12 Watch me get a warn or something -_-
general 2020-10-25 22:26:37 When it said the link wasn't allowed I thought that meant it wouldn't put it in the suggestions
bot-central 2020-10-25 22:29:09 I'm so gonna get a warn for this
bot-central 2020-10-25 22:31:04 Or if one of them is removed pls leave the second
bot-central 2020-10-25 22:37:12 Idk what the mod pinging rules are
bot-central 2020-10-25 22:38:44 Ok so it's pretty relaxed
bot-central 2020-10-25 22:40:38 <@335599526414909451> hope you don't mind the ping. I accidentally sent a suggestion twice because I added an image link to my first and the bot said that the link wasn't allowed so I assumed the suggestion wasn't sent. I feel that the second one better explained my suggestion. Could you please remove the first?
the-dump 2020-10-25 23:04:45 Really
the-dump 2020-10-25 23:04:55 This dude just called dogs a furry

the-dump 2020-10-25 23:10:51 "femboy" I'm Nonbinary so your point is kinda broken
general 2020-10-25 23:22:19 I think that T_YL3R thing is a bug
general 2020-10-25 23:22:39 That certainly doesn't sound like something that was intended
bot-central 2020-10-25 23:22:46 Thanks
bot-central 2020-10-26 12:37:43 ?color #00ff00
bot-central 2020-10-26 12:38:00 oh i think i sorta get hex codes
bot-central 2020-10-26 12:39:00 #ffffff would be 255 for all three because every set of 2 digits accounts for a value of one of the colors
bot-central 2020-10-26 12:39:07 color #ffffff
bot-central 2020-10-26 12:39:19 ?color #ffffff

plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:48:22 what
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:48:26 did you do
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:55:49 not bad
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:57:35 but like, anything that didn't have 20 hours, motor locking, and isn't a replica of something from real life gets more downvotes than upvotes
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:58:49 give it full red, green, or blue stripes on the wings and tail fins
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:59:08 camo might be a bit difficult
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 12:59:24 depending on size
general 2020-10-26 13:08:37 oof
general 2020-10-26 13:09:08 life protip: warn yourself for no reason then get warned for warning yourself
plane-crazy 2020-10-26 13:09:27 ok cool

creations-chat 2020-10-28 12:30:24 I don't see any wedges sticking out
bug-reports 2020-10-28 13:05:39 my parachute launched me to oblivion

bug-reports 2020-10-28 13:08:51 ok
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 13:59:03 but i dont think it would stop flying once you start it if you don't counter thrust
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:00:07 the answer is motor locking
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:00:41 ok
help 2020-10-28 14:16:37 no don't think so
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 14:18:11 > It’d be actually pretty good if they added something like a hover rank where they have to create a hover ship that aren’t allowed hover thrusters and must be in perfect balance when not moving and hovering
technically that isn't hovering it's more like zero g
creations-chat 2020-10-28 14:33:42 lol
general 2020-10-28 14:54:34 night

bot-central 2020-10-28 14:58:05 !rank
bot-central 2020-10-28 14:58:17 oh wait
bot-central 2020-10-28 14:58:30 got confused there nvm
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 15:00:05 at the start his plane doesn't have a control surface on the right wing
the-dump 2020-10-28 15:14:23 Yeah
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 15:14:44 Nah
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 15:15:31 But I have had multiple people climbing on my starship when I "land" it. Land in quotes cause I use hovers as landing gear
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 15:16:41 I have 2 additional pilot seats and sometimes I open the cockpit to allow people to ride with me, but no one ever takes the offer
bot-central 2020-10-28 15:26:53 !underandom
bot-central 2020-10-28 15:27:02 ?underandom
bot-central 2020-10-28 15:27:06 ...
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 17:52:34 what's up with that motor 3 suggestion? isn't that exactly how motor 2 works?
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 17:54:29 actually there are a couple differences. That suggestion has a default angle
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 20:51:07 you're gonna want to build the cockpit and some of the structure behind it above the vehicle. put pistons on both sides at the bottom corners of the structure, grey face towards the cockpit, use motor locks to pull the cockpit and the structure down.
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 20:53:58 maybe you did the bindings wrong?
plane-crazy 2020-10-28 20:56:30 > you're gonna want to build the cockpit and some of the structure behind it above the vehicle. put pistons on both sides at the bottom corners of the structure, grey face towards the cockpit, use motor locks to pull the cockpit and the structure down.
in this image i painted my pistons green and motor locks yellow
plane-crazy 2020-10-29 15:11:16 wait Ace Combat is adapted from an anime?
plane-crazy 2020-10-29 15:13:00 that image used as a ref for the space elevator is from the anime

creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:29:08 what about non tutorial shredderbugs?
creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:37:42 i wouldn't call them hideous so much as overused. they were probably cool when there were only a couple players that had them.
creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:39:14 ok :/ i like the looks because they're pretty unique in design to other creations
creations-chat 2020-11-05 14:43:24 use motor 2 on servo mode

help 2020-11-09 23:25:11 probably because it isn't very stable. it may work in the game that it's from but having a vehicle be taller than it is wide or long is a bad idea
general 2020-11-10 03:03:23 I wonder if I could use a HOTAS controller for PC
plane-crazy 2020-11-10 03:10:10 I wonder if it would be possible to play Plane Crazy with a flight stick

plane-crazy 2020-11-12 16:47:41 Hm
plane-crazy 2020-11-12 16:48:04 At least they're less likely to completely obliterate your craft

creations-chat 2020-11-12 21:44:39 wow that is really good
creations-chat 2020-11-12 22:07:47 yeahi've tried to get well taken builds
even one that i spent 10s of hours on, but alas it has never worked
creations-chat 2020-11-12 22:38:33 you did say "like my flag" in the last post though
general 2020-11-13 18:12:08 who woulda thunk that making %90 of your wings the control surfaces would be a bad idea
general 2020-11-13 18:12:40 not like the normal control surface parts
general 2020-11-13 18:12:50 custom control surfaces
general 2020-11-13 18:13:27 yeah i know what the the proper word is but this isn't very serious anyways
general 2020-11-13 18:15:08 my wings shouldn't be flying off
general 2020-11-13 18:16:14 haha
general 2020-11-13 18:16:52 making most of your wings rotate really breaks the physics
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 18:43:41 "plz bring back outlines. I know there's some kind of roblox issue but plz" -_-
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 18:44:22 Yeah I'm not the one who asked
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 18:44:38 I was quoting the suggestion
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 18:45:51 Like the "I know there's a Roblox issue" means that there's not much that the devs can easily do about it :/
plane-crazy 2020-11-13 18:47:01 Me neither
bug-reports 2020-11-14 00:31:04 known issue
bug-reports 2020-11-14 00:32:50 wait the thing where the engines make the weird noises that sound like people spitting or whatever is a feature?
bug-reports 2020-11-14 00:33:08 it happened to me twice today and not once before
bug-reports 2020-11-14 00:37:18 hm
bug-reports 2020-11-14 00:37:36 is the part that you're trying to move connecting to other parts?
bug-reports 2020-11-14 00:38:06 can you screenshot
bug-reports 2020-11-14 00:38:40 thanks
bug-reports 2020-11-14 00:43:22 yeah the blocks of the cockpit are connecting to the blocks that surround them
bug-reports 2020-11-14 00:43:36 use motor locks
bug-reports 2020-11-14 00:44:19 nope
bug-reports 2020-11-14 00:44:44 ????????
bug-reports 2020-11-14 00:45:09 use motor locks to have the cockpit suspended in the air in build mode
bug-reports 2020-11-14 00:45:57 and when you spawn in the piston and cockpit will be pulled down to the body of the plane
bug-reports 2020-11-14 00:46:22 this isn't a bug it's just how the game works
bug-reports 2020-11-14 00:47:08 https://youtu.be/nESCtKwrWqs

bug-reports 2020-11-14 00:52:19 also make sure to uncheck the powered box
help 2020-11-14 02:42:35 you can use smoke generators
help 2020-11-14 02:42:55 or lava spitters but those only work in pvp
help 2020-11-14 02:43:29 i also have question: why does my drone sway after sharp turns?
help 2020-11-14 02:58:29 ok :/
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 01:08:01 Every just get an input mapper to control 2 of your builds
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 01:08:25 Using a controller instead of the keyboard
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 16:30:40 So what control schemes do people use for their custom surface planes?
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 16:31:31 I'm using w/s for pitch
A/d for roll
Q/e for yaw
And r/f for throttle
plane-crazy 2020-11-15 16:55:46 If you have sufficient thrust and the centers of lift and mass are lined up, it should work
general 2021-04-22 14:25:38 i am back after a couple months when i left because of all the homophobia i saw all the time
creations-chat 2021-04-22 14:36:13 oh nice multiple down votes for posting a concept. forgot why i didn't like sharing my stuff
creations-chat 2021-04-22 14:43:13 yeah
creations-chat 2021-04-22 14:53:19 it actually wasnt
creations-chat 2021-04-22 14:57:11 eh too bad i will anyways, just for anyone who may think that it actually is. i went through three iterations to get to the craft in the picture. first i used the pontoons which were inconsistent and bouncy. then i tried the ballast tanks which didn't quite feel right. so i then landed on heliblades which actually worked wel
the-dump 2021-04-22 14:58:56 yeah this kind of stuff is why i left PCC
creations-chat 2021-04-22 15:00:29 i don't see why you need to bring my gender identity expression into this
creations-chat 2021-04-22 15:05:18 that, still has nothing to do with the intended topic of this channel
besides, peoples identities aren't opinions
creations-chat 2021-04-22 16:25:53 you got 67 upvotes

plane-crazy 2021-04-22 17:02:00 i wonder if other players have made hydrofoil boats
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 17:04:08 hydrofoils are a type of boat that rise their hull out of the water
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 17:04:33 kinda hard to describe though. like the ship in The Incredibles 2
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 17:06:40 yeah
plane-crazy 2021-04-22 17:06:56 they basically have wings under the water

plane-crazy 2021-04-26 02:54:00 Hydrofoils are fun. this is actually lifted by propeller blades and not low power water props
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 03:08:41 i'm still impressed that this even works
plane-crazy 2021-04-26 13:40:22 I hope the map expansion comes soon I would like a reason to use my hydrofoils

general 2021-07-25 22:45:49 Imagine being a white name despite having a challenge role 😔
creations-chat 2021-07-25 22:46:35 Something definitely happened
help 2021-07-26 01:53:24 Oh I guess delta wings could work. Instead of trying to angle trail parts.
help 2021-07-26 02:21:41 definitely works
help 2021-07-26 02:26:45 just gotta accept some z fighting
help 2021-07-26 02:35:39 Piston lock? That's new to me
help 2021-07-26 02:38:10 how does it work?
help 2021-07-26 02:48:37 alright
help 2021-07-26 02:49:07 how do i lock on command without explosive blocks though?
help 2021-07-26 03:44:53 Think I've figured out piston lock
general 2021-07-26 13:18:58 Oh hey
creations-chat 2021-07-26 15:54:31 any feedback for this wip Douglas X-3? it's going much better than the one i made yesterday so far though
creations-chat 2021-07-26 16:00:52 yeah :/
not really sure how to get that seamless merge
general 2021-07-26 16:06:33 kill it with fire
general 2021-07-26 16:07:19 that or hand me the unsee juice
the-dump 2021-07-26 16:08:29 not that that one's enforced in my experience
general 2021-07-26 16:11:56 <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
creations-chat 2021-07-26 18:36:35 dont really care. it works
general 2021-07-28 22:35:27 Yes?
creations-chat 2021-07-29 20:12:22 futuristic VTOL that i'm working on. any tips? ("delete it" will not even be something that i'll consider) *also don't mind the anchor, it's temporary*
creations-chat 2021-07-29 20:19:38 i guess i brought that one on myself lol
help 2021-07-29 21:20:35 ok is piston landing gear just a bad idea and the game is trying to tell me not to do landing skis that way by breaking the front one?
help 2021-07-29 21:24:38 all jokes aside, is there a way to fix this?
help 2021-07-29 21:24:39 
help 2021-07-29 21:31:06 who needs landing gear when you have a dropdown cockpit seat
creations-chat 2021-07-29 21:44:36 tamibtianic
general 2021-07-30 00:16:31 imagine smh couldn't be me
general 2021-07-30 00:17:17 what about it?
general 2021-10-28 12:55:04 Might attempt to make a 'thopter today... Not sure quite yet... I have the basic mechanisms thought out
general 2021-10-28 12:55:46 Basically
general 2021-10-28 12:55:55 Just minus the boy part
help 2021-10-28 14:04:30 There isn't a way to make motor 2s go through their restricted motion continuously is there?
help 2021-10-28 14:09:57 Like where it goes to one of its angles and then switches direction and goes to the other, all while holding a single key
help 2021-10-28 14:13:47 I'm guessing not because ornithopters could be much easier to make...
help 2021-10-28 14:13:49 And walkers...
help 2021-10-28 14:53:44 Like this mechanism works for the up and down wing movement but it's big and clunky
help 2021-10-28 15:05:19 I know motor 2 exists. It's not gonna be consistent if I can't hold a key and have the servo cycle while holding it though
help 2021-10-28 15:30:09 Same as you would with planes
help 2021-10-28 21:04:16 and to no one's surprise, motor 2s alone can't get an ornithopter off of the ground
help 2021-10-28 21:16:30 this is what i've got rn
help 2021-10-28 22:17:26 Not sure how to do that in a compact fashion
help 2021-10-28 23:27:20 reports aren't being accepted last i knew
help 2021-10-28 23:27:27 -underandom
help 2021-10-28 23:28:01 i can't work out the wing drive mechanism for my ornithopter
help 2021-10-28 23:35:19 like.. why
bug-reports 2021-10-29 00:13:51 ghost block. nice -_-
bug-reports 2021-10-29 00:14:10 wing panel 1x1 specifically
help 2021-10-29 01:44:45 by all means this should work but the suspension is being fussy
help 2021-10-29 02:09:00 yep
help 2021-10-29 02:09:10 and i figured out the issue up there
help 2021-10-29 02:25:46 noticed that everyone else was kicked
general 2021-10-29 02:43:35 if anyone's wondering what exactly happaened
general 2021-10-29 02:44:09 idk
general 2021-10-29 02:44:16 i'm just sharing what i heard
general 2021-10-29 11:32:49 Rip my ornithopter I guess
general 2021-10-29 11:32:58 Probably got deleted
general 2021-10-29 11:33:12 Cause I never got kicked from the game
general 2021-10-29 13:56:49 Slowly resolving?
general 2021-10-29 13:56:54 And saves are intact?
general 2021-10-29 13:57:02 Cool
general 2021-10-29 13:57:28 Still not expecting to have my Thopter as it was before I left though
general 2021-10-29 13:57:37 I wasn't kicked from the game
general 2021-10-29 13:58:05 So I probably lost in when i didn't realize everyone else was
creations-chat 2021-10-29 15:06:16 Uhh
I think that's a war crime <:Thonk:509498568982134816>
creations-chat 2021-10-29 15:09:43 Oh I see
creations-chat 2021-10-29 15:14:07 Also a good loop hole
general 2021-10-30 21:30:58 this game can be breathe taking at times
general 2021-10-30 21:31:24 especially when your Canopy is compromised :D
general 2021-10-30 21:39:02 like i said. Beautiful
general 2021-10-30 21:39:37 lol
general 2021-10-30 21:39:46 no clue what it is though
general 2021-10-30 21:40:08 at least it's not a thargoid
general 2021-10-31 19:12:22 they're doing limited rollout
help 2021-11-01 03:21:33 Oh hey I'm doing the same thing lol
help 2021-11-01 03:21:40 It's not going great
help 2021-11-01 03:22:15 I'm trying to make a compact single seater type
help 2021-11-01 03:22:31 It kinda just flounders on the ground
help 2021-11-01 03:23:08 The wing shape is the least of your worries
help 2021-11-01 03:23:33 I don't think you'd be able to fit a good mechanism inside the body
help 2021-11-01 03:24:19 Definitely won't fit
help 2021-11-01 03:25:33 No I just got off
help 2021-11-01 03:27:35 Yeah
help 2021-11-01 03:27:46 Same reason I'm making a thopter
help 2021-11-01 03:27:59 Even though I haven't read the book or seen the movie
help 2021-11-01 03:28:12 I've done all kinds of searching on the internet
help 2021-11-01 03:29:44 I've also searched for ornithopters in the server to get an idea of the mechanisms used in them but they're hard to see with the moving and distance from the camera
help 2021-11-01 03:33:10 You should make it longer
help 2021-11-01 03:33:41 Make the back thin out more gradually
help 2021-11-01 03:37:22 It's just a bit inaccurate
help 2021-11-01 03:37:27 Not really sleek
help 2021-11-01 03:38:37 Ah
general 2021-12-15 13:21:33 Anything new with the Christmas update?
general 2021-12-15 13:22:58 Alright
general 2021-12-15 13:23:06 I was assuming not
general 2021-12-15 13:23:43 Eh it's alright
general 2021-12-15 13:24:23 I haven't played in a while
general 2021-12-20 21:34:48 ornithopters
general 2021-12-20 21:34:54 the bane of my existence
general 2021-12-20 21:35:03 how do people do these
help 2021-12-20 22:28:28 why does it gotta be so difficult to make ornithopthers
help 2021-12-20 22:29:40 aircraft that are powered by wingbeat movement rather than propellors or jet engines
help 2021-12-20 22:30:30 alright then
help 2021-12-20 22:30:52 regardless people have made them in PC before
help 2021-12-20 22:31:02 they just aren't common
help 2021-12-20 22:31:10 and are very complicated
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 00:39:42 that feeling when you get back on from an idle kick and your creation totally flips out every time you assemble 😔
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 00:43:13 lmao
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 00:43:25 threw me way away from the map
plane-crazy 2021-12-21 00:43:32 this really sucks
events-chat 2022-01-29 02:27:23 Hmm
events-chat 2022-01-29 02:27:40 Wonder what I should make
events-chat 2022-01-29 02:28:18 👍 
Obviously. Legs are gonna be digitigrade no matter what
events-chat 2022-01-29 02:31:29 Most likely to do a fox-like quadruped
events-chat 2022-01-29 02:40:34 Shouldn't be crazy hard
events-chat 2022-01-29 03:07:40 Make a mech
events-chat 2022-01-29 03:11:12 Oh that
events-chat 2022-01-29 03:11:28 Is already over
events-chat 2022-01-29 05:40:52 day one. very bare.
events-chat 2022-01-29 14:44:41 Alright
plane-crazy 2022-01-30 16:08:14 Looks like it's inspired by a walker that was shown in Scrap Man's new video
events-chat 2022-01-31 05:26:03 Gotta make something for this soon
events-chat 2022-01-31 05:28:44 Nope we've got a week
events-chat 2022-01-31 05:29:22 A week to fine time aesthetics and functionality. As some people may know, I'm bad at both.
events-chat 2022-01-31 05:40:34 No explosives for weapons
events-chat 2022-01-31 13:36:22 What's wrong with Minecraft?
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:04:50 Should I make an Imperial Eagle for the event?
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:05:21 It's a ship from Elite Dangerous
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:06:08 
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:06:24 It looks enough like a plane
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:14:25 Ok how about "a heavily Imperial Eagle inspired jet"
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:15:32 <:thconking:535171057649188865>
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:25:57 I'm not hearing a no :D
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:30:10 :c
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:36:10 That's-
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:36:46 A dumb question, I think that's more dumb of a question than my Imp Eagle question
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:39:04 Like I could've made the Imp Eagle without anyone but me knowing what it actually was
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:49:32 Like I think there are probably at most 2 other people in here that know what Elite Dangerous is
events-chat 2022-01-31 16:50:04 Though that is an entirely random guess, it's just not a very well known game
events-chat 2022-01-31 17:17:01 Like I said. At most 2 other people
events-chat 2022-01-31 17:25:54 Is it actually good?
events-chat 2022-01-31 17:26:13 That just looks very unbalanced
events-chat 2022-01-31 17:29:50 Lol
events-chat 2022-01-31 17:32:35 Mine will likely mostly use vectored thrusters for turning
events-chat 2022-01-31 18:38:29 Yeah pretty much
plane-crazy 2022-01-31 20:31:35 Nice
events-chat 2022-02-01 22:34:28 what have i done
events-chat 2022-02-01 22:34:44 why is it acting like it is attached to weak helium
events-chat 2022-02-01 22:35:04 
events-chat 2022-02-01 22:35:57 guess so
events-chat 2022-02-01 22:36:14 i'm just trying to learn camera lock and this happens
bug-reports 2022-02-01 22:38:25 just me or is camera lock acting weird?
events-chat 2022-02-01 22:39:45 well that's something
help 2022-02-01 22:50:22 learning
help 2022-02-01 22:55:24 make the edges slant in more, more clearance = tighter possible turn radius
help 2022-02-01 22:56:59 you're at least gonna want to use wedge 1x2
help 2022-02-02 02:44:49 I don't think ignore self prevents destruction. I think it just prevents the tnt from chain reacting.
help 2022-02-02 02:45:08 You need private server to turn of tnt destruction
bug-reports 2022-02-02 04:21:03 Guess so
bug-reports 2022-02-02 04:21:12 I seem to have worked it out
contest-chat 2022-04-03 16:52:27 Space :3
contest-chat 2022-04-03 16:53:17 So either gonna restart my Imperial Eagle, or build something like my Arrow Ships that I've made in TerraTech
contest-chat 2022-04-21 01:28:12 Water just said, "I reject your reality and substitute my own!"
events-chat 2022-04-26 01:36:03 Spaceship
events-chat 2022-04-26 01:36:45 Dang
