creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:48:10 <@295784513152221184> looks dumb?! Look at the ADFX-02 Morgan!
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:49:58 This turned from creation feedback to general really quick
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:53:17 <@295784513152221184> I have many example of good looking foward swept planes the ADF-01 falken and the X-02S Strike wyvern
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:54:55 Oof damn
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:56:26 Saying wips without capital letters looks really weird
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:57:58 <@661550706511314944> thats mostly true
creations-chat 2020-11-16 08:59:33 <#497142796961054721> is even worse but is more crowded by more people
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:05:28 <@486947728320888842> real good. What is it anyway?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:07:14 <@486947728320888842> wait lemme think, the ship that both served the republic and the imperial?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:08:58 Ah I finally remember now, used to watch them battle against the hammerhead corvette in space engineers
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:10:29 <@486947728320888842> I tried to build a vtol A-Wing but it failed miserably
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:12:18 <@486947728320888842> wait the star destroyer mounted with a big death cannon that can destroy planets?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:14:33 Never really watched the sequels and I only watch videos reasoning why its bad, the sequel kinda ruined anakin legacy being the chosen one because he erased both sith and Jedi but now palpatine has come back
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:16:49 Rey saying "I am all the Jedi" was really cringy
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:18:26 At least they should've put windu, obi wan, Yoda, anakin and other Jedi voice over Rey because it would've sound more epic
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:20:45 And oh yeah, put a scene where palpatine slapped rey while yelling "you are not the chosen one"
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:22:16 K imma roll out to other channels

creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:30:09 Got rid of them, no one would find them in my backyard
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:31:41 There's a large bush near my backyard, should be a perfect hiding spot for their dead bodies
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:33:12 <@555965248184778753> they peed once they saw me with the 9mm so hell no
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:35:35 I should call a SWAT team against my neighbors under an anonymous identity so they would get suspicious with my neighbor after finding the dead bodies
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:37:49 "To get freedom, you must revolt against the people with the most freedom"
"WE SHOULD GO AGAINST CHILDREN WITH LEUKEMIA"

creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:47:42 Okay I'm not proud to start this chain reaction that would be the change of <#504436696021204992>
creations-chat 2020-11-16 09:49:38 Normal physics and quantum physics doesn't share the same properties and rules, thats not communism

the-dump 2020-11-16 12:08:07 Ah ace attorney, a masterpiece in the meme community
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:11:56 It maybe an unpopular opinion but i hate the pog face, staring face and the weirchamp face
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:12:50 I hate everyone in general especially myself
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:13:18 Whats the difference
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:13:42 Both are basically Memes channel but the <#497142796961054721>  is more crowded
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:14:31 Bruh imagine how many people the mods and admins need to ban because people kept posting Memes on general
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:16:48 "Guys please keep the Memes out of general and post them to the dump, anyway this is the reason why i think half triangle wedge x2 should not be added" -the mods
I will probably get warned so if i dissapear then you know why
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:19:25 There's still no half triangle wedge x2 yet, I NEED THEM FOR MY BUILDS
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:20:05 Half triangle wedge x2 not half wedge
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:21:14 There's only one half triangle wedge and thats the normal one, can someone suggest the admins to add triangle wedge x2
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:21:33 Hmm
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:21:49 HÃ© be still be busy
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:24:26 Oh yeah we need sink wedge too, its basically like the cutter but reverse shape
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:25:04 Ye like that
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:25:39 Normal wedge will take up 2 block wide but a sink wedge will only take 1 blocks wide
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:26:13 Oh my god
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:26:53 Imma go afk
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:33:16 I have a suggestion, can someone make a floating megastructure that has close tracking Rockets and railguns, it also has tunnels that are specifically made for planes to go through and inside those tunnels are structural supports that you have to shoot at. Need my ace combat dream to become true
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:34:20 Yeah
the-dump 2020-11-16 12:35:13 <@719168864705052802> but what?

the-dump 2020-11-16 14:53:15 "To gain freedom, you must revolt against the people with the most freedom"
"WE NEED TO GO AGAINST CHILDERNS WITH LEUKEMIA"

the-dump 2020-11-16 15:06:03 Imagine snorting the juice in canned food. Hmm
the-dump 2020-11-16 15:08:27 "Guys keep the Memes out of general and post them to the dump please. Anyway this is why i think that every type of wedges is useless" -the mods
If i when missing then you know why
the-dump 2020-11-16 15:09:43 <@311638025308209154> alright its fun when you did this the first time but now its getting annoying
the-dump 2020-11-16 15:11:23 <@311638025308209154> bruh just because im not from an english speaking country makes my Memes immediately invalid?
the-dump 2020-11-16 15:14:23 I hate it when people use the "you're not from an english speaking country that means every of your opinion is invalid"
the-dump 2020-11-16 15:17:05 YÃ¨Ã
the-dump 2020-11-16 15:18:40 I would like obi wan screaming "SCRAP METAL" at the unsinkable II

creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:23:23 <@593882288954146836> I feel hurt at a quantum level
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:26:16 <@525244805756878889> I like custom building because it gives me pride
"The best kind of builds is the one made by yourself"
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:28:30 <@525244805756878889> ah okay
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:30:22 <@508428804885053440> Also what the hell are you building
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:31:53 <@508428804885053440> looks more like a megastructure
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:33:37 Tips on how to get up votes:
1. Make your builds stand out
2. Use vibrant colors
3. Don't make it look dumb
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:35:28 <@683069192143896594> I mean vibrant gray, you know you need to focus things on the important part of the build and to make it stand out from the normal hull is by using darker, lighter grey
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:37:00 I hate it when custom builds gets overshadowed by more overrated builds
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:38:36 Like by following others footsteps to the pathway of popularity will make you look like a scumbag in the long run
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:40:26 People now only wants attention, not attention because of affection but because of popularity
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:42:18 In short: people want attention because of fame not affection
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:45:28 We need to use our monke brain
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:46:59 <@626449107577471012> its perfect
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:48:44 Expectation when you finally build a jet: zooming through people and diving into the aircraft carrier hangar to destroy it
Reality: take off and now I'm dead
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:50:15 Reality is often disappointing
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:51:47 Me: about to finally destroy an aircraft carrier
Shredder: and now your dream goes poof
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:53:49 I prefer carrier with angled Decks because they have more space meaning I can take off and land easily without going left and right to avoid obstacles
creations-chat 2020-11-16 15:59:56 <@456226577798135808> metal affects weigh just like fabric affect traction
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:01:55 Still haven't tested the effects of glass, ice or sand
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:03:44 <@683069192143896594> So an ice skater mech is possible?
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:05:16 Okay my theory went up from plausible to possible. Ice skater mech does indeed exist somewhere
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:06:56 <@683069192143896594> have a piston that can extend a fabric block so that when the fabric block touch the ground, it would stop the skating
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:08:28 <@683069192143896594> the problem is that, I cant build mechs too. I like tunnels and jets, thats it
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:10:35 I kinda hate mechs because they just sit there waiting for me to spawn and then kill me when I was just about to take off
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:12:06 But uh my fighter jet can only go to 313kph making me an easy target
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:13:47 My fighter is basically what happens if you combine an interceptor and a strike aircraft
creations-chat 2020-11-16 16:15:18 Slow speeds But hella guns
creations-chat 2020-11-17 01:05:57 There's a military bike in ww2 that you can make
creations-chat 2020-11-17 01:07:52 Military bikes are not that tall
creations-chat 2020-11-17 01:09:26 Well I mean you can still use simpler motor lock for the bike
the-dump 2020-11-17 01:16:53 <@373163551789154326> this bring back bad memories, I stuck my head between two poles when I was a kid
