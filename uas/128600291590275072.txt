creations-chat 2018-11-28 17:25:42 looks like it isnt very stable rip
creations-chat 2018-11-28 17:52:49 <@!274981740513198081> The wings actually have a huge advantage depending how you use them
creations-chat 2018-11-28 17:53:04 when you angle them back it just keeps on accelerating
creations-chat 2018-11-28 17:53:16 it wont pull up or turn as well thought
creations-chat 2018-11-28 17:53:29 when they're out all the way it turns on a time and can go vertical
creations-chat 2018-11-28 18:10:04 <@!274981740513198081> One thing though, it's extremely finnecky, wings too long ? it'll glitch off too short ? wont move too wide same thing with glitching
creations-chat 2018-11-28 18:10:10 you have to make it abosluetly perfect
creations-chat 2018-11-28 18:10:24 even 1 block off causes mine to self destruct basically

creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:47:37 #2 a certian block pattern *Which ill grab a pick of* that alters the airflow to give lift instead of drag
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:47:50 the landing gear i couldnt do properly
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:48:04 mainly cause of how i built it

creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:50:24 but for some reason that pattern on the top messes with how the game renders flight
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:50:31 it gave me a lot more lift idk why
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:50:48 in the middle.
creations-chat 2018-11-29 04:51:06 if i do it any other way even with the same blocks in the same spot with dif rotations it wont fly
