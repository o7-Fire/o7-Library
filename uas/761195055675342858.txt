creations-chat 2021-09-30 21:34:52 Damn that's cool

Edit: yeah, not to be mean but the I assume Lexington class is way better again not to be mean
help 2021-09-30 21:42:07 Trails or sparklers for your size, that's my recommendation
creations-chat 2021-09-30 21:49:57 <@708064765770989568> cool icbm

Edit: <@704723100213706905> I'd suggest to detail the front more and maybe add more color, like blue? Also some text on the truck could be nice
creations-chat 2021-09-30 21:53:38 I'd suggest to detail the front more and maybe add more color, like blue? Also some text on the truck could be nice
creations-chat 2021-09-30 21:57:20 Man bloody everyone uses pyramid and half wedge down one by two, it ain't from a tutorial accept I already.
creations-chat 2021-09-30 21:59:21 Other tree designs and maybe remove the bench outside, btw it have interior, if so pls show so I can try give helpfull feedback
creations-chat 2021-09-30 22:02:25 I know it's hard but just stop talking to subtodrip, if he continues he'll be punished edit: kekw
creations-chat 2021-09-30 22:05:27 Id say, make it one central room with the iconic wooden benches and the thing the priest stands on so it's more one thing
creations-chat 2021-10-01 19:49:46 I suggest sparklers for the barrel because the turret is kinda small so the sparkler size would work better for scale
creations-chat 2021-10-01 20:24:20 more like a 460mm
creations-chat 2021-10-01 20:27:27 Good thinking but I suggest to replace the sparklers when pc2 comes out, it CAN take like a couple months for it to come out

creations-chat 2021-10-04 18:54:06 Yeah gonna fix those, its based off of the pvp version I have which has turrets that dont storm so thats something ill fix, thanks for pointing out tho
creations-chat 2021-10-05 13:58:56 yeah, put tnt in between the motors so it blocks them from locking, do the fold and then explode the tnt, dont forget to activate power and lock on the folding motor
creations-chat 2021-10-05 14:23:22 springs > disconnectors tbh cuz those dont leave the annoying duds that stick out

help 2021-10-13 21:50:29 I'd recommend doing some tutorials and watching motorlock piston an angle lock guides, they are really helpful and made me get sorta good at the game
help 2021-10-13 21:50:50 Your welcome
creations-chat 2021-10-13 21:52:35 True, and with more and more anti shredder/anti noskill movements inside plane crazy groups such as uncf the public pvp experience gets a lot better if I'd say so

help 2021-12-02 11:45:59 You need to make the canopy more one piece, I suggest using some half wedge down and half blocks for it, also the tail should be moved upward a bit and the sides at the front need rework, the thing at the very front is good though your getting there but a work is still needed
help 2021-12-02 11:46:46 ye, the tail needs to be moved up like half a block or made out of other blocks

creations-chat 2021-12-27 21:26:21 Yes, engine wing pieces need to be bit further extended but looks accurate to me
creations-chat 2021-12-27 21:42:19 That little thing is great lol

creations-chat 2022-01-18 19:51:08 (real), now make the napalm a scatter motorlock bomb
creations-chat 2022-01-18 19:57:47 The tail section, what?
creations-chat 2022-01-18 20:12:34 Cool
creations-chat 2022-02-03 19:11:41 I like the concept a lot but maybe some details like shaping or color shading / different materials? Gun could use some details, ladders signs trails texts etc are great for that, also maybe a small platform attached to the gun with a control panel, but thats a suggestion, looks fine as is but can be better
creations-chat 2022-02-03 19:15:41 You're going the right way, now try to take the color on top and bottom add or remove 10 from somewhere in the color code and spray that a bit along the cylinder section, for the rest it looking good! (You could do magnet launcher for funny)

Edit: good idea <@709400929178222711>  it would make it a lot more alive
creations-chat 2022-02-03 19:39:15 Wo nice, now maybe some slight color differences over the balloon section
creations-chat 2022-02-03 19:42:11 Ooh nice, although some props on the side would help
creations-chat 2022-02-03 19:45:51 I cant Rly judge right now because its night mode, if its day i could do better, looks really White on this picture though
creations-chat 2022-02-03 20:45:50 Thats just white tbh- maybe try 155 155 155 or something

Edit: i thought you needed a grey paint, if its accurate then keep it that way
creations-chat 2022-02-06 13:09:18 Very hot! Could we get a picture showing more of the ship?
creations-chat 2022-02-06 13:19:26 Thats a lot of time and effort- more then I put into my builds

help 2022-03-01 09:11:16 half wedge from half blocks and half wedge down + sign blocks work good for a bit of depth
help 2022-03-01 09:11:45 and you can use half cylinder 2 plus some trails for the turbolasers in the mid hull section
help 2022-03-01 09:12:23 no problem, if you need more help feel free to ping

help 2022-03-04 15:19:52 its hard and I am well aware of all the things that can be improved a lot- but its also supposed to go fly so yeah-
help 2022-03-04 15:21:30 I got a lot of experience with making them function but making the entire front deck rotate is another story-
help 2022-03-04 15:26:09 yeah- it keeps getting stuck due to torque
help 2022-03-04 20:58:55 I fixed it with 1 X 0.9 blocks, frontal deck now can spin, more details and stuff needed at the back though

help 2022-03-04 23:28:48 Ohh alr, didn't backread but yeah I never add lights (posses a craptop) and then when I forget 1 trail in the entire build which I can't find back it's just a big pain, so whoever is reading, make sure to make all trails toggle off if you do it that way otherwise it's really annoying
help 2022-03-04 23:32:03 Tracks, use thin ones, body needs more detail, turret needs more detail machine gun bit weird, exposed motorlock on barrel
help 2022-03-04 23:33:54 Yes
help 2022-03-04 23:35:17 I hope this bridge is decent enough (I'll hide the locks if I can)

help 2022-03-05 07:15:52 ;-; hyperdrive;-;
help 2022-03-05 08:22:11 Yeah very true, best way to utilize warpdrives is to accelerate your projectiles to absurd speeds, but you need a decent PC for that
help 2022-03-05 08:25:24 (my opinion and experience in pvp with space ships)
help 2022-03-05 08:25:35 also T N T armor is very, very useful
help 2022-03-05 08:47:55 ice material, helps a lot
help 2022-03-05 09:00:43 ice doesnt impact durability, its just really light, wood also is very light but the textures of ice match normal material better
help 2022-03-05 09:07:31 yeah, and btw if you fold use a motorlock fold (oversized angle lock) its fairly easy to armor so your back wont get shot off with a single gun block
help 2022-03-05 09:14:51 oh alr, I personally use miniature replicas with conveyor engines to evade shots for naval pvp (also back a tnt belt) and a motorlock fold to get the stern part in
creations-chat 2022-03-05 22:23:24 Pretty sure that's namnams thing from the jet guides but more stuff added
creations-chat 2022-03-05 22:25:49 I call it more a guide due to the jet being more of an example and you can apply the knowledge to make your own easily and I don't blame you, I am watching the series too because I need FPS friendly jet due to craptop

creations-chat 2022-04-06 19:37:05 Hmm then everyone (including me) just doesn't meet the hars standard
creations-chat 2022-04-06 19:42:16 As in lower the standard? Could be interesting to see, I do like the fact you say exactly why you downvoted a build so people can fix it
creations-chat 2022-04-06 19:45:23 Just pointed out I think I good what you already do and that you want to become less "strict" only makes it better, that's my opinion though
creations-chat 2022-04-06 20:24:18 <@719168864705052802> what could I improve on this except 
The paint
I can't fix leg exposed locks
And I need some tips on what details to add, if you need references to what sorta thing I'm making search for "86 feldreß"
creations-chat 2022-04-06 20:36:04 I'm using cutters indeed, I used those since they do damage and look decent, thought about delta 1x1 but those mess up movement, and it was a combo of the vanagandr ( pic you used ) and the löwe (featured here) I will try to fix the feet, legs I won't since the angle makes them look shorter then they are

Thanks for the feedback though
creations-chat 2022-04-06 20:38:36 Yes, closely inspired by those two,first wanted to make the löwe, kinda failed so mixed it up with the vanagandr
creations-chat 2022-04-06 20:40:39 Another reason the legs are the way they are, so they can bend at high speed like suspension as shown here

(Old pic)
creations-chat 2022-04-06 20:44:34 Ay atleast it sorta looks like it
creations-chat 2022-04-06 20:46:45 Also would 300-500 SPS be enough speed to compensate for lack of armour? (Yeah, it's for PvP)
creations-chat 2022-04-06 20:49:11 Alright, thanks a lot for the feedback though will work on also hiding the tnt at the legs and then it's finished I think
creations-chat 2022-04-06 20:56:23 It's for public, not organised battles and we'll it can survive fine without legs because it has controls inside the body too which is basically a tnt cube, also those speeds would just be impossible for me to handle on land because skill issue internet, FPS and me having that
I'll see what I can do tho
creations-chat 2022-04-06 21:00:34 Interesting, I would float on my belly with enough downforce to go upside down so I'm not really worried, also it's weird movement make rocket tracking go weird or players not being able to aim at me
creations-chat 2022-04-06 21:02:50 Pain, will make it faster or more armored, prob first one
creations-chat 2022-04-06 21:33:53 Looks a bit off can't really say why, but the cockpit does look good

bug-reports 2022-10-23 12:47:42 and that also fixes the rocket issue fsr

creations-chat 2022-10-26 19:50:30 What tho?
creations-chat 2022-10-26 20:10:44 Consider this is meant for pvp so simplicity is required, if you have any ideas tell me


Please no kamikaze drones are so cringe and annoying, they're like shredders but smaller and faster
creations-chat 2022-10-26 20:13:50 Rather not make smaller and faster shredders, besides this thing already handles like fighter jet
creations-chat 2022-10-26 20:52:16 Could be useful, though, you should treat it like a fighter jet wirg turrets and armor as it's more or less that

bug-reports 2022-11-09 15:06:07 cant wait for pvp to be fixed so I can ruin shredder's days again lol

events-chat 2022-11-14 11:09:02 hmm I could make an 86 feldreß modified to have some giant swords
events-chat 2022-11-14 11:09:15 and abuse some shit called sliding and wing panels
creations-chat 2022-11-18 09:02:12 if only you know how completely braindead tech in this game can get...
creations-chat 2022-11-18 09:25:15 oh right, yeah... ~~the moment you can litteraly change around physics and stuff~~
creations-chat 2022-11-18 09:29:16 you could make a game out of that
help 2022-11-19 08:25:28 Right
help 2022-11-19 08:26:01 What i do is just balance it with helium, add tnt armor and make shredders get copium

creations-chat 2022-11-22 17:46:14 <@653161887156142087> pvp space ship?
creations-chat 2022-11-22 17:49:14 Oh I know what that is

What's the top speed, does it have any armor, <@653161887156142087>?
help 2022-11-22 17:51:25 <@653161887156142087> to prevent arguments, and also would you want it to be a good pvp ship?

events-chat 2022-11-22 21:12:45 Respect
events-chat 2022-11-22 21:13:00 👍
creations-chat 2022-11-22 21:16:34 What is it
creations-chat 2022-11-22 21:22:48 Ah
creations-chat 2022-11-23 12:44:51 <@860154094072102923> PSM is useless
creations-chat 2022-11-23 12:47:21 Learn wasd + glitch mouse instead of shredder bug controls
creations-chat 2022-11-23 12:50:38 thats of exactly no use against people that can actually aim

(or use a space boat)
creations-chat 2022-11-23 12:54:11 also, <@860154094072102923> pvp jets *can* look like something original, and not look like a carbon copy of namnams jet:
creations-chat 2022-11-23 13:05:09 i'd use disconnectors but because of motorlock I was forced to use trapdoors

(the disconnectors welded to everything)
creations-chat 2022-11-23 13:07:18 the thing is actually 2 wide, the angle makes it hard to see, but only the nose tip is 1 wide, top down screenshot:

It is 2 wide, I can show it in game if you want, I used half wedge downs for it, thats why the arms are sticking out
creations-chat 2022-11-23 13:24:24 ill get a better pic to proof it later then
creations-chat 2022-11-23 13:26:30 half wedge down so its 2 wide lol, say whatever you want
creations-chat 2022-11-23 13:55:28 huh? I just used it to cover up my cheesegrater wings
creations-chat 2022-11-23 14:18:25 ah, no I do hate those guys that just put giant trapdoor plates instead of wings
creations-chat 2022-11-24 07:51:36 Nams server is more or less... *weird* half the time
contest-chat 2022-11-28 10:49:16 people would just submit CSA shredders
help 2022-11-29 17:01:50 Roblox fucked physics up again sorry but yeah
help 2022-11-29 17:02:27 Yeah
help 2022-11-29 17:02:40 It made my spaceship more overpowered though so am not complaining
help 2022-11-29 17:04:30 Alr
help 2022-11-29 17:06:28 Hmmm...
help 2022-11-29 17:06:51 I can perhaps join you in-game in an hour or so to fix the issue
help 2022-11-29 17:13:30 Hmm alr
creations-chat 2022-12-02 19:02:08 This is why I use space ships, just out turn them and bonus points if you just out tank them :> direction either as you're facing doesn't matter as I'm a flying boat with 3-6 turrets
creations-chat 2022-12-02 19:05:33 That's just plane crazy rockets committing aimbot, but nice kill nonetheless


Now try to kill stormingscars shredders
creations-chat 2022-12-05 11:41:27 I love that, would you be ok with it if I made a bigger pvp tank variant of it?
creations-chat 2022-12-05 11:44:42 great
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:55:33 space ship event would be mega funny
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:56:47 I mean... true, people dont want to go through the effort for it
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:57:00 besides that the rules would probably be something like, no wings
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:57:06 (this absolutely sucks)
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:57:24 well its space so it has to be "realistic"
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:57:39 I mean
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:57:53 ive seen that rule before
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:57:58 in some groups
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:58:23 the only way to properly move without wings is abusing something called axis lock (not angle lock) and max drag hovers
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:59:03 thats a pain
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:59:33 I was redoing the functions of my pvp ship yesterday then roblox somehow made the booster module that normally goes 2000 go 200 000
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:59:43 got an image?
contest-chat 2022-12-07 11:59:50 or is it in <#384025409945337856>
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:00:04 thats bad because going 200 000 is too fast to hit anything
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:00:09 ill do

contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:04:38 alright
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:08:23 ah alright
bug-reports 2022-12-07 12:09:17 known, just respawn or abuse it because you are now invisible and can more or less kill anyone
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:10:04 thank, didnt make it myself but ye I am trying to learn how to draw *but the system keeps fucking crashing*
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:10:47 yes lmfao
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:15:30 hmm
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:15:46 oh you could do something like a small rocket being towed by reindeers
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:16:48 im just giving ideas-
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:17:16 o
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:17:22 I do like the idea tho
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:17:28 yee sure I will
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:18:31 oh maybe a rocket in the shape of a christmas tree lol
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:19:46 lmao yes and use that thingy on the top of the christmas tree as like the cockpit
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:20:37 you could maybe even make that detach and give it small landing legs like space x's stages
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:21:02 final
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:21:07 but like add landing legs on that
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:21:10 so it can land and take off
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:22:17 yey
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:22:37 oh wait
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:22:58 how hard would it be to make the christmas tree fold open and store something like a small sattalite inside?
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:29:50 true
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:30:02 well anyways, I do hope you have a lot of fun making it
bug-reports 2022-12-07 12:30:20 thing is they cant hit you back
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:30:26 thanks
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:31:36 oh I got an idea for that, you could maybe make the present box open up and have like a retractable telescope thingy in there!
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:32:33 I could maybe help with the design for that
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:32:43 I have a bit of experience with tiny contraptions like that
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:36:38 how large will it be your you don know yet?
bug-reports 2022-12-07 12:36:50 so you are just playing practice mode
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:38:31 oh yea right forgot, but would a 3x2 size sattalite be small enough?
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:47:58 aye I can
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:48:20 I could probably
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:48:23 with a little motorlock
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:48:38 make the present things discard, revealing a small hubble like thing
bug-reports 2022-12-07 12:48:48 ?
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:50:17 also lets maybe take this to dms-
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:51:13 alr but maybe not in the contest channel
contest-chat 2022-12-07 12:53:45 alrih

contest-chat 2022-12-08 11:07:49 oh my god thats fucking perfect
contest-chat 2022-12-08 11:08:43 yes, I can only imagine the rage
help 2022-12-08 11:09:10 I mean ive seen people do it
help 2022-12-09 12:38:50 that could be abused in pvp, if you can just turn your aircraft around but not go slower or actually turn that way, you can just fly backwards while firing your weapons at the enemy
help 2022-12-09 12:41:54 make toggleable thrust
help 2022-12-09 12:41:56 should help
help 2022-12-09 12:43:29 im in school, you can toggle hover engines by rotating a text in front of them
help 2022-12-09 12:43:45 watch namnams pvp jet guide for how to make toggle hover
help 2022-12-09 12:44:03 doesnt matter
creations-chat 2022-12-09 13:35:28 that is quite litteraly axis lock
help 2022-12-09 13:37:10 yamato
creations-chat 2022-12-09 13:42:28 basically rotation lock, or well really overpowered thing that prevents all rotation n stuff
creations-chat 2022-12-09 13:54:55 for being made in auch a short time I like it, you can actually change the material on the wings so it looks better btw
creations-chat 2022-12-09 13:56:56 maybe the tail could be longer but that might be picture angle issues, for the rest maybe thicken this part here, looks a bit flat
bug-reports 2022-12-11 16:45:09 it never happens to me-
