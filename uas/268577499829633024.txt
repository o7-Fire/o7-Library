creations-chat 2018-12-30 09:03:51 something i think will be devistating is making a shotgun og explosives

help 2018-12-30 21:10:26 i know whats causing the problem
help 2018-12-30 21:10:34 you'd have to split your plane in half or something
help 2018-12-30 21:10:49 dont rip it apart yet though
help 2018-12-30 21:11:20 ganna test something
help 2018-12-30 21:17:56 mk this works
help 2018-12-30 21:17:59 
help 2018-12-30 21:18:15 have one magnet connected to the body of the plane and keep the other one seperate
help 2018-12-30 21:18:28 ganna keep testing to see what else works
help 2018-12-30 21:20:53 
help 2018-12-30 21:21:00 this design works too
help 2018-12-30 21:21:23 red = connected to plane, yellow = held only by springs
help 2018-12-30 21:22:20 i can show you in game if you need me to

help 2018-12-30 21:24:25 orip
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:21:08 which kind of terrain do you want it to handle?
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:21:35 water, underwater, hills, railroad, mountain, air
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:22:29 have you made a land / water vehicle yet?
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:22:38 lol
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:22:39 oh myy
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:23:19 <@!323110865140449282> have you build land vehicles / boat vehicles yet?
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:23:21 that you have saved
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:23:39 the reason i ask is becase i was going to tell you to make it fly
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:24:19 maybe try to make the oddest shaped plane possible
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:24:22 / aircraft
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:24:50 it can look good
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:25:06 are you wanting it to strictly be a plane or does "aircraft" work
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:25:36 oye
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:25:48 with the new explosive blocks
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:26:35 with cargo doors that drop stuff?
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:27:13 what dont you like about it?
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:33:32 maybe have 3 planes conected together by a disconnector
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:33:48 then mid flgiht you can break the connection so the other 2 fly away
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:34:22 how is it a bad idea?
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:34:44 ^
creations-chat 2018-12-31 00:55:53 i tried that multiple plane splitting idea and it worked pretty well,
creations-chat 2018-12-31 01:04:11 onice
help 2018-12-31 01:32:20 could depend on where the main pilot seat is placed but
help 2018-12-31 01:32:23 i dunno really
help 2018-12-31 01:32:33 ie had that problem before too, no more how to fix it
help 2018-12-31 01:33:21 no
help 2018-12-31 01:33:39 see if he has any tricks or if you did something wrong
creations-chat 2018-12-31 19:05:41 use magnets to join those 2 together
creations-chat 2018-12-31 19:11:53 oh nice
help 2018-12-31 22:48:46 control surfaces might be in a weird place
help 2018-12-31 22:49:42 can i see your build?
help 2018-12-31 22:50:44 wheres the pilot seat?
help 2018-12-31 22:50:52 in the plane or on the carrier?
help 2018-12-31 22:51:10 oh
help 2018-12-31 22:51:14 wheres the main pilot seat
help 2018-12-31 22:51:15 mb
help 2018-12-31 22:51:34 change the main pilot seat to the plane
help 2018-12-31 22:51:42 and the control room to regular pilot seat
help 2018-12-31 22:51:53 try it and tell me if its fixed or not
help 2018-12-31 22:54:01 you might have to set your controls
help 2018-12-31 22:54:06 ill keep thinking though
help 2018-12-31 22:55:01 sometimes if you have parts somewhere else it can mess up
help 2018-12-31 22:55:21 besides it'll be good be good practice to set controls
help 2018-12-31 22:55:27 i think so too but dont delete it
help 2018-12-31 22:55:34 oh that tpp
help 2018-12-31 22:55:35 too
help 2018-12-31 23:02:13 you set the controls?
help 2019-01-01 07:13:52 use magnets
help 2019-01-01 07:14:09 wait is it able to be folded?
help 2019-01-01 07:14:16 if its able to be folded, fold it
help 2019-01-01 07:14:56 no i mean if the parts are too far from eachother to be folded
help 2019-01-05 01:55:15 from what ive seen, its like
help 2019-01-05 01:55:28 if you bump into it, it will shake back and fourth
help 2019-01-05 01:55:43 if you have 0 dampening it will keep shaking / take a long time to stop
help 2019-01-05 01:56:15 go ahead and test it out to amke sure you know how it works too
help 2019-01-05 19:17:13 wym
help 2019-01-05 19:17:41 ye
help 2019-01-05 19:18:33 you can weld parts together with magnets if your parts are too far away to fold
help 2019-01-05 19:24:51 dunno but i could show you how it works
help 2019-01-05 19:25:08 do you mean for welding?
help 2019-01-05 19:25:21 i feel like the best way to learn is to experimenting youself
help 2019-01-05 19:25:23 oh
help 2019-01-05 19:25:59 
help 2019-01-05 19:26:22 make sure uoi have magnets only and weld on
help 2019-01-05 19:27:29 ive goten it to be reliable by attaching it to a rope
help 2019-01-05 19:27:33 red on red
help 2019-01-05 19:28:56 after theyre close to eachother for long enough they'll weld
help 2019-01-05 19:29:28 but im sure you dont need to use the rope
help 2019-01-05 19:29:34 ye, just experiment and stuff
help 2019-01-05 19:32:42 oh i ment only welding
help 2019-01-05 19:32:49 if yure able to use motors use those
help 2019-01-05 19:33:33 hes an admin so me might not like that
help 2019-01-05 19:35:03 show me your build so i can understand how youre trying to attach stuff
help 2019-01-05 19:35:25 / what might be best place to put stuff
help 2019-01-05 19:35:45 i think the game joiner is still broken but ye you can join
help 2019-01-05 19:36:03 i'd have to friend you but dont take it personally if i unfriend
help 2019-01-05 19:36:18 oye, im in normal mode so it should be fine actually

help 2019-01-05 20:03:16 magnets work
help 2019-01-05 21:01:31 explode them or use a disconnector
help 2019-01-05 21:01:44 you cant unweld magnets
help 2019-01-05 21:03:03 dunno, but i think i like it that way, it forces you to make a design to take it apart
help 2019-01-06 23:56:37 Oh
help 2019-01-06 23:56:51 My like
help 2019-01-06 23:56:58 Second plane had a design like that
help 2019-01-06 23:57:24 Automatic control should work fine
help 2019-01-06 23:57:44 Shed some of the blocks of though, they're slowing it down
help 2019-01-06 23:59:36 I dont have my computer with me right now but i can show you a design similar to that when i get back home
bug-reports 2019-01-07 17:42:40 Both of those are supposed to happen
