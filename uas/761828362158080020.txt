creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:29:51 Ik. Wanted it to be a lil thicker so I did that

help 2022-01-12 03:09:59 wot did I do?
help 2022-01-12 03:10:14 looks like a suriken so that's what i said

help 2022-01-31 09:21:04 possible but may not worth it
help 2022-01-31 09:23:20 cuz it would be a pain in the ass to create the heli's fuselage later on
help 2022-01-31 09:23:31 just to suround the thing
creations-chat 2022-02-11 16:00:18 I think u should move the back gears 1 or 2 blocks back. Other than that, pretty sweet Ka52 <@!919488183639609435>

creations-chat 2022-03-14 01:21:36 An Apache with a 40AGL, pretty realistic. U should change it into trails mate.
creations-chat 2022-03-14 01:45:06 Apache uses 30mm and since ur planning on making a tiny one, trails r ur go to
creations-chat 2022-06-17 10:44:34 I'm actually looking forward to its interior ngl. Hope it has lots of configure to edits
