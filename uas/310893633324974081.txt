creations-chat 2019-05-18 22:13:21 I had a delima, i couldn't turn w/ out a rudder. Just made two different thrust systems ðŸ¤·
creations-chat 2019-05-18 22:13:36 Basic but functional
creations-chat 2019-05-18 22:16:22 <@!221496030355521536> It can turn very well, all I needed to add was two different thrust systems. It couldn't turn unless I went full perpendicular to the ground and back like I was doing some F18 airshow
creations-chat 2019-05-18 22:16:33 Before I added the engine turning system
