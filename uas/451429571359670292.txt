help 2021-11-19 16:25:42 Did not help
help 2021-11-19 16:28:27 no, I removed 2 motor2 because there 2 motors that make the side blades spin. This did not solve the problem

help 2021-11-19 16:29:42 oh just the motors
help 2021-11-19 16:30:33 This tank's turret model hasn't been changed for like 1.5 years

the-dump 2022-11-07 19:51:40 Is this normal for GTX 1050 ti
the-dump 2022-11-07 19:59:24 51.4% is half of my CPU
the-dump 2022-11-07 19:59:32 ðŸ§ 
the-dump 2022-11-07 21:15:32 My CPU can do 100% of it's power
the-dump 2022-11-07 21:16:59 You mean memory?
the-dump 2022-11-07 23:08:17 My memory is 16gb
the-dump 2022-11-08 01:42:10 Sorry I don't stay inside enough to know what that is
help 2023-05-11 11:54:02 I have trouble keeping the top platform (seat) in place, it keeps spinning with the lower beams. The motors inbetween the 2 sections have 0 torque and 0 speed
help 2023-05-11 11:59:04 
help 2023-05-11 12:12:09 Just realized the closer the thrusters are to the motor (centre) the more it influences the movement of it, keep your thrusters as far as possible from the centre to keep it stable
help 2023-05-13 17:29:28 Why does this always happen?
help 2023-05-13 17:29:44 
help 2023-05-13 17:31:50 Doesn't matter how I spread my ballasts, if they are on the front or in the back the contraption ALWAYS tilts upwards
help 2023-05-13 17:32:17 I'm using 0 helium
help 2023-05-13 18:26:07 They simply will not make my contraption tilt normally or backwards. No matter how much or where I put them, it will do nothing
help 2023-05-13 18:26:44 I have deleted and replaced all the ballasts and it keeps doing it, I've also removed the nose of my  submarine and replaced it with new blocks
help 2023-05-13 18:27:06 same problem
help 2023-05-13 18:28:37
