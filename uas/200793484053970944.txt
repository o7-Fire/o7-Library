help 2020-07-17 02:24:21 then after that it begins to slow down
help 2020-07-17 02:24:23 aight
help 2020-07-17 02:25:10 its not to do with fps
help 2020-07-17 02:25:22 roblox physics tends to slow down with builds with a large amount of moving parts
help 2020-07-17 02:25:37 so like, if my build is travelling at 100 speed in actuality it travels at 20
help 2020-07-17 02:28:25 680
help 2020-07-17 02:28:49 680 and thats just the treads, prolly gonna lag a lot more once i build the entire thing

help 2020-07-17 07:04:03 roblox physics hates a large amount of moving parts

help 2020-07-23 10:12:27 my heli keeps spinning uncontrollably from the rotors, rn I'm trying to use the tail rotor to cancel out the spinning effect but it's not enough. is there any good solution to this?
help 2020-07-23 10:13:04 tail rotor speed is all maxed out while main rotor speed is at a bare 10, not even enough to fly
help 2020-07-23 10:18:37 yea won't work, heli keeps spinning even if i make the rotor disproportionately small
help 2020-07-23 10:19:28 
help 2020-07-23 10:20:07 tail's got 2 rotors at max speed, i thought that'd be more than enough to counteract the spinning

creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:56:31 for me pvp is only fun on the vip servers
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:56:55 otherwise you‚Äôd see half the server building missiles and shredders
creations-chat 2020-08-14 13:57:10 and turrets with maxed out weapons
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:28:09 yes too blocky
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:28:41 let me take a close look
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:29:09 i cant go on rn
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:29:26 use triangle wedges
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:29:49 and motorlock stuff if u need to
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:29:59 cos i knows there spots where certain blocks wont work
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:31:54 whats the actual heli called
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:32:40 bruh
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:32:52 make the glass part at front bigger
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:32:54 if u can
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:33:57 is this supposed to be a replica
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:34:01 or just based off it
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:34:10 cos theres some big differences
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:36:03 show a pic of the tail in flight mode
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:37:59 also i know how the chopper has only 1 set of rotors but with ur lower rotor try making it less chonky
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:38:10 *if possible* also lower the rotors
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:40:19 if the lower rotors dont serve any purpose (not sure since i cant see if they have motorlocked wings in them) might aswell get rid of them
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:53:18 tail seems too long
creations-chat 2020-08-15 00:53:27 other than that it looks good
creations-chat 2020-08-15 04:42:24 whats with all these people building unsc frigates that arent scaled correctly
creations-chat 2020-08-15 04:45:05 like dont get me wrong it looks good but you might aswell call it a custom frigate
creations-chat 2020-08-15 04:47:01 not drama just criticism
creations-chat 2020-08-15 04:47:44 i‚Äôve recently been seeing unsc frigates with parts too long, too short, too wide etc.
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:31:52 are we talking about the uboat?
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:32:15 cos whoever made it needs to replace the flag with an iron cross
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:32:34 the boat is good but flag nono
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:33:05 personally I dont care about the flag but it breaks rules
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:33:23 This is roblox not COD WAW
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:33:32 this game is for kids
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:33:47 im all for historical accuracy
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:36:00 the only problem with the flag is that this server doesnt allow it
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:36:40 tbh though this flag is more appropriate
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:42:37 talking about nono flags, is the communist equivalent also banned?
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:43:11 well the third reich flag is banned
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:43:20 and soviets killed more people
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:43:38 death to nasis and communists
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:44:05 iron cross is allowed
creations-chat 2020-08-15 06:44:17 its still used by the modern german military

creations-chat 2020-08-16 22:43:21 no thats a motorlock
creations-chat 2020-08-16 22:43:54 
bug-reports 2020-08-16 22:47:56 <@!702044686491320410> because they‚Äôre scambots
bug-reports 2020-08-16 22:48:30 rick censored their scam messages with ‚Äú<‚Äî scammer‚Äù
bug-reports 2020-08-16 22:58:35 ok rick screwed up censorship then
bug-reports 2020-08-16 22:59:42 unless they‚Äôre just trolling
bug-reports 2020-08-16 22:59:50 but it made u say it too
bug-reports 2020-08-16 22:59:54 so idk
creations-chat 2020-08-16 23:34:04 yes
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:25:14 the best part about that tutorial build is the entirety of the tutorial itself
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:25:21 barrel looks stupid
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:26:23 that barrel is too big
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:26:28 and muzzle break is disproportionate
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:27:07 yes
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:27:13 it should have tutorials for all vehicles
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:27:26 well vehicle types
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:28:13 it should also have tutorials on slightly more advanced block types
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:28:20 such as springs, magnets and suspension
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:32:19 they should add cannons, basically nonexplosive rockets except the rockets travel faster and have bullet drop
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:32:33 cannons just punch through builds rather than blowing up
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:32:53 basically
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:33:04 except an actual pvp weapon
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:33:44 only problem with magnet powered guns is that they lag
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:34:02 and they take up a lot of space
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:34:14 yeah
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:34:48 it would be cool if rockets were affected by magnets
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:34:54 so u could accelerate them
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:36:19 or if they made railguns an actual pvp weapon
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:37:03 railguns with 3x1x2 size or something
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:37:09 longer reload than rocket
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:37:18 but penetrates 3 blocks into builds
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:38:27 magnets make most reliable railguns
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:38:47 oh no
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:39:04 aka piston
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:39:19 piston except toggled
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:40:35 if u want to make it now before rick releases ingame moderation
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:41:21 make sure it has no references to actual labour camps though
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:41:34 like, no stuff about gulags and concentration camps for safety
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:42:01 u can make one its just a tough road to navigate without getting banned
creations-chat 2020-08-17 03:42:09 or warned

help 2020-08-19 02:49:34 swashplates are huge though
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:02:36 tbh though
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:02:41 it's not his fault that there's undes in this server
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:03:02 the undes themselves are breaking rules
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:03:41 we adjust by banning them
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:04:34 if only undes didn't join this server
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:05:04 nothing
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:05:10 that's why it's an "if"
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:05:45 i reckon the undes that hide it well deserve to stay though no matter if they're an unde
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:06:03 well we won't know if theyre unde
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:06:04 since they're hiding it
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:06:14 and if they're hiding it well they aren't as immature and stupid as other undes
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:06:34 yeah
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:06:41 if they get caught
the-dump 2020-08-19 05:06:42 <:BanHammer:507685761496252420>

the-dump 2020-08-19 05:07:03 you deserve to get banned
creations-chat 2020-08-19 06:58:32 another requirement for expert is doing no low-effort builds

Do you just wake up in the morning and think "wow, I really feel like a massive fucking stone today"? It's useless. I hate it. It just provokes a deep rooted anger within me whenever I see it. I want to drive on over to the fucking emoji headquarters and kill it. If this was the emoji movie I'd push it off a fucking cliff. People just comment üóø as if it's funny. It's not. üóø deserves to die. He deserves to have his smug little stone face smashed in with a hammer. Oh wow, it's a stone head, how fucking hilarious, I'll use it in every comment I post. NO. STOP IT. It deserves to burn in hell. Why is it so goddamn smug. You're a fucking stone, you have no life goals, you will never accomplish anything in life apart from pissing me off. When you die noone will mourn. I hope you die.

creations-chat 2021-01-19 00:26:39 no one says that lol
creations-chat 2021-01-19 00:31:47 some people like comparing builds but that isn't inherently bad at all, that's actually a good thing so that pcc has actual standards.
creations-chat 2021-01-19 00:34:03 also it's not like people downvote just because someone's version of a build is slightly worse than someone else's build. people upvote/downvote on whether or not the build is good.

creations-chat 2021-02-18 11:42:19 not perfect enough, never is. i will continue to keep adding onto it until the sheer amount of motorlock stops me from doing so

creations-chat 2021-02-18 11:48:12 <@!447721322072506369> mid chassis is looking good enough, the red area i marked highlights the awkwardly large gap between the wheels and chassis. front portion of the car looks unrealistically flimsy. image quality is pretty bad tbh, i could see the pixels pretty easily. also you could use some gradient (ex: darker towards bottom of the buggy to simulate dirt)

creations-chat 2021-02-18 12:45:23 cant do that either, theres too much motorlock to change the shape of the chassis

creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:12:41 World doesn‚Äôt revolve around you bub, no one cares on how much time you spent on the build. The upvote and downvote system is centered around other people giving an opinion on your build, and that means they don‚Äôt like your build. So how about you stop whining and take this as an opportunity to improve. Stop acting so entitled.

creations-chat 2021-03-21 20:55:58 saying a build sucks is a form of criticism, that means one does not enjoy looking at your build. Essentially it means the entire build is not up to par.

creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:06:00 this guy isnt even in test mode and he has working lights? wtf?
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:08:33 yea shader isnt allowed, plus his build is randomly in the sky, due to height limit you'd at least see his plot since he won't be able to move it up *that* much.  dont think he built that
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:12:40 bro i wasnt even talking about your build
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:14:45 how did you get it up into the sky and turn on lights in build mode, that build is clearly close to height limit. someone explain what black magic fuckery is going on
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:16:57 <@!466793357318815744> ~~~can you investigate this guy's build, looking pretty sus. ~~
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:19:49 bro we just got bamboozled, but still shaders arent allowed according to what i heard, just see what the mod says later on
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:22:04 the build is real but his friend took the pic apparently, ~~but still that doesnt explain how he flown his build up to the sky when he was in build mode~~

help 2021-04-23 03:16:41 build more until you get good
help 2021-04-23 03:16:49 you dont just get good after 1 or 2 builds
help 2021-04-23 03:17:16 practice is number 1 priority
help 2021-04-23 03:17:51 besides that I would suggest learning motorlock, piston lock and other techniques you might be interested in
help 2021-04-23 03:20:30 also I would say to keep asking for criticism and help *while* building, it‚Äôll be easier to make changes than after you‚Äôve finished the whole thing
help 2021-04-23 03:20:51 ^
help 2021-04-23 03:21:16 just browse in <#384025409945337856> and observe how people do different things
help 2021-04-23 03:21:42 pick out the best things from each of those builds and notice what **not** to do
help 2021-04-23 03:22:27 if you fall for the same mistakes as everyone else you‚Äôll get downvoted a lot, but whats important is if you can learn from the mistakes
help 2021-04-23 03:22:52 dont focus on getting upvotes, just build because you enjoy the game
help 2021-04-23 06:37:38 i assume you mean delayed motorlocks
help 2021-04-23 06:38:12 easiest way is to attach explosive blocks to the motorlock tower then detonate them when you want the lock to work

creations-chat 2021-04-23 09:33:28 ok should i make it wider though
creations-chat 2021-04-23 09:48:19 i disagree
creations-chat 2021-04-23 09:50:46 you need to balance test your plane on multiple occasions, find a good way to control pitch, roll and yaw and most planes i've come across are pretty compact builds which makes it harder to motorlock or have locks. a good plane typically needs multiple custom angles (and perhaps on the wings aswell which adds some variability to flight performance)

creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:24:31 yea thats totally irrelevant to what I said, besides its like comparing apples to oranges. oh both are fruits therefore one *must* be better right? stop applying that logic to these games. we both know it makes no sense and that the games apply to seperate audiences
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:28:31 hof
creations-chat 2021-04-30 06:32:47 you still try to compare a game involving **actual 3d modelling sourced from roblox studio itself** and one where the game is supposed to be simple yet your build in that game gets absolutely shitted on in comparison to some of the builds our community has

help 2021-05-05 11:12:22 ok so you're gonna have to do some simple math here
help 2021-05-05 11:12:32 30/100 is 0.3
help 2021-05-05 11:12:59 that means for every block in lengthwise you place, your should build your creation 0.3 blocks higher.
help 2021-05-05 11:13:21 so lets say you want that build to be 40 blocks long
help 2021-05-05 11:13:39 40 x 0.3 is 12, that means you should build it 12 blocks in high

creations-chat 2021-05-17 22:24:07 sus!
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:16:15 stugs were the most produced german tank, ofc they were. also goddamn that paint in your creation is terrible, judging by the rest of its features I don't even know if you can even call it a stug at the point it's at rn.
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:21:02 driver vision slit, perhaps a mounted mg, spare tracks (as armour), segmented sideskirts, possibly an antenna, also literally everything that's supposed to be on the back of the stug is missing
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:23:38 the sideskirts is unrealistic too, the angle for the top sides is too steep. look at this compared to the sideskirts
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:26:07 mg is also pretty big for your build. i'd suggest just making a gun shield instead because an mg34 is pretty difficult to correctly make at your scale.
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:28:34 if you can, try use trails to imitate the segmentation, heres an example from my stug:
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:30:48 yea you're gonna have to motorlock for this
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:33:06 also you see these things connecting the sideskirts to the hull? you can use trails for that.

creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:40:37 spare wheels, wooden boxes, jerry cans, barrels etc. the stowage compartment design is different for some of the tanks too so pick one you like, in my case I found a stug with one designed entirely out of wood so I went with that.
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:44:05 yea make the boxes brown because it's wood. maybe half blocks for some of them too to make them shorter.
heres an example: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/504436696021204992/811922705205035018/unknown.png
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:46:17 yea the fence is different for some stugs but it extends further back. idk how you can make that work without motorlock tbh.
creations-chat 2021-05-18 07:48:20 also i forgot to mention, your stug is missing this bit here. I think it's sort of like an exhaust but it's a good idea to include it in your build.

help 2021-05-18 07:53:11 you think you'll be able to fix the nose somehow?
help 2021-05-18 07:53:51 rn you can either make the entire jet bigger so you can use triangle wedges for the nose. another solution is motorlock.
creations-chat 2021-05-18 08:44:55 also has slight tinges of dirt towards the bottom
creations-chat 2021-05-18 09:10:55 yea i literally have no words on how to improve your build other than to delete it
creations-chat 2021-05-18 09:48:25 i can only give so much feedback, but if your build looks like *that* then consider building something else or starting again completely. don't think you paid much attention to your reference images if you even used any

creations-chat 2021-06-19 01:24:24 its too shit to be a copy. that wheel design is widely used in tank creations and ofc the turret will look similar its an mbt.
creations-chat 2021-06-19 01:26:37 maybe he drew inspiration but some parts of the tank are too drastically different. observe them side by side.
creations-chat 2021-06-19 01:29:51 still dont think he planned on fully copying, maybe heavily inspired but come on.

creations-chat 2021-06-19 10:31:11 your build isnt that special but ok
creations-chat 2021-06-19 11:05:08 sides of the front half of the turret are wrong, turret also needs to be extended back by a block
creations-chat 2021-06-19 11:08:59 actually just take a look at this
creations-chat 2021-06-19 11:37:43 95% sure thats an unde
creations-chat 2021-06-19 11:41:31 scaling is correct but it looks worse now
creations-chat 2021-06-19 11:45:07 <@!723940197456281640> you see how the top part of your KT turret comes to a sharp point? dont do that. the top most part is actually flat like in this blueprint here (highlighted in red).
creations-chat 2021-06-19 11:49:18 also, if you look at a king tiger from the top it looks a bit like a deformed hexagon. your one is an octagon. you should try to fix that too. next step would be smoothing it out but im pretty sure it would require some motorlock.

pretty sure the kamikaze pilots were all volunteers. in japanese culture sacrificing your life for the land of the rising sun and the emperor was seen as honorable
creations-chat 2021-12-07 22:37:10 "Yeah thats correct for the most part." is all you needed to type out lol. I wasn't discussing the nuking of hiroshima and nagasaki
creations-chat 2021-12-07 22:40:05 that has nothing to do with the government forcing pilots to die in battle. they still gave them a choice. If you don't raise your hand you signify that you are ready to die, period.
creations-chat 2021-12-07 22:42:18 kamikaze pilots are **supposed** to die. if you fail to complete that mission 9 times, especially after you volunteered, then obviously you'll be seen as a lying traitor

creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:28:08 ok? so you want us to upvote every single build now? whats the point in having a voting system then
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:30:12 how about explicitly asking people what‚Äôs wrong with your build instead of whinging about getting downvoted
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:34:13 ‚ÄúYea people just downvote anything if its slightly imperfect‚Äù

well, you did try to convince yourself that most people downvote for no reason, which is objectively false.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:37:25 eh, that just means the build needs to be redone. idk why a lot of people cant be bothered using <#478584971670454284> and <#504436696021204992> for support throughout their build, then when they get downvoted we hear ‚Äúbut but there was nothing wrong with my build! üò¢ ‚Äú
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:43:35 if people display subpar creations to the public, they deserve all the ridicule they get. it doesnt take a lot of comparison and investigation to realise that your creation is lacking, and if they keep insisting to themselves that their build is the Mona Lisa I hope they get downvoted into oblivion
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:48:39 you have every chance to ask yourself: Is my build to scale? Did I paint this well? Are parts in the right spot? What else could I add? Could I ask for someone elses opinion?

people often reject going through this process, and it is not a surprise they get downvoted. now when you fail to do multiple of these things, all you have accomplished is the very thing we call a shitty build.
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:51:54 <#384025409945337856> is a place where people rate the builds of others, nobody is obliged to give feedback. If you want criticism that badly go to <#478584971670454284> / <#384021699466756107> 
asking for someone‚Äôs opinion is the easiest thing, its not rocket science
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:54:01 hmm, I wonder, you could probably post your build here and ask one of us then? theres several expert designers here, ask while you have the chance
creations-chat 2021-12-17 14:58:25 go straight back to what? theres always people in this server providing help. heck when I first started I got assistance from 3 different people, and my build was a pile of steaming garbage
creations-chat 2021-12-17 15:00:50 you literally have a chance for feedback right now, yet you don‚Äôt want it? make up your mind pls

I‚Äôd also mention that getting feedback is much easier than you have convinced yourself otherwise, im offering a chance to you rn but idk what you want
creations-chat 2021-12-17 15:06:46 thats because they post in <#384025409945337856> with a knowingly poor build. they expect criticism AFTER they have put the creation on a pedestal for the server to see, or sometimes they dont even realise what garbage they just built. you realise that  people dont want to endlessly scroll to see a decent build correct? so what right does the builder have to start sulking when other players express their disgust? what I do not understand is people not asking for feedback BEFORE posting in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-12-17 15:09:32 if it doesn‚Äôt look bad, it gets upvoted. I don‚Äôt see the issue?
creations-chat 2021-12-17 15:12:33 that is the biggest pile of bullshit i have ever seen in ages. someone offer a counter argument, im done wasting my time. off to sleep, toodaloo.

creations-chat 2022-01-02 00:45:30 failing to do that simply just means you're shit at building and don't deserve an expert role at all
creations-chat 2022-01-02 00:48:15 why would you build the tutorial in the first place then, there's no need for that if it's going to be that different
creations-chat 2022-01-02 00:51:14 yeah but if you're using a tutorial as your framework you still copied someone else's creation and slapped your own stuff ontop of it


whitenames are never based
creations-chat 2022-01-02 00:55:21 pretty bland


<@!393527373729103888> that still doesn't excuse using tutorials, btw it's completely possible to make an original build without copying <:trollface:775024642104229898>



<@!597188078670577668> it's bad when people post them into <#384025409945337856> because you're only supposed to post your own stuff. the issue is plagiarism not using tutorials itself
creations-chat 2022-01-02 00:59:26 > It‚Äôs only when people discredit and continuously repeat tutorials without progressing building skill that it is a bad thing.
that's the issue here. most people who use tutorials don't give a shit about learning. I fully support tutorials that teach how to build advanced mechanical constructs or the fundamentals (e.g swashplates for helicopters or motorlocking)
creations-chat 2022-01-02 01:04:14 don't see why you would use a tutorial in the first place if you're fully capable of building each section by yourself

then make your own build and don't use somebody else's unique creation as a framework

the-dump 2022-01-18 14:15:36 I agree
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:15:42 mental illness doesn't mean they still can't contribute to society
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:17:04 how aren't they
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:19:44 their brain is wired in a way that nullifies the evolutionary trait of being able to reproduce and this is not in any way considered normal
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:22:18 a gay person's behaviour can have noticeable differences between their straight counterparts
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:24:15 they have higher rates of depression, other mental disorders, suicidal thoughts, illicit substance usage and are more likely to engage in risky behaviour
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:24:36 not to mention that a good percentage of gays were abused as children
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:25:14 are you even going to try change my mind
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:25:32 I'm open to debate
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:26:04 yeah but it's not normal is it
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:26:09 they can't reproduce
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:26:10 they die off
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:26:38 so has mental illness
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:26:43 and every other disease though
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:27:40 ok but how does that suggest being gay isnt some sort of mental disorder
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:27:56 because a civilization can have high rates of illness yet be successful
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:28:38 I'm talking to you

the-dump 2022-01-18 14:30:09 no lol
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:30:28 things like mild autism can stablise as someone approachs adulthood
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:30:37 do you even know what you're talking about
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:31:44 so calling it a mental disorder may have some merit
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:33:05 I don't care what the verdict is but Total seems like he can't refute any of my points without resorting to insults
the-dump 2022-01-18 14:33:32 interesting

the-dump 2022-03-28 12:20:49 yes also
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:21:33 they have hundreds of quadrillions to quintillions of weapon-ships + sentinels
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:22:51 they literally have more automated weapons than men in the imperial guard
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:22:53 they clap so ez
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:23:11 plus a single hunter-killer FIGHTER was considered enough to kill the spirit of fire
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:23:24 a venatores warrior servant controlled a million of those hunter killers
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:23:36 there were trillions of warrior servants
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:24:08 the forerunners also had time manipulation
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:24:12 in the form of slipspace bubbles
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:24:18 yes
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:24:24 not time manipulation in the normal sense
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:24:28 but they could freeze an object in time
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:24:45 by doing this they could render something invulnerable to damage
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:25:12 also warrior servants, in combat skins, could fly through a mountain at speeds of much higher magnitude than sound
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:25:29 they clap the space marines so hard its not even funny
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:26:01 using their war sphinxes they can burn a city in moments
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:26:25 we havent even gotten to constraint fields yet
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:27:03 also the first set of 12 halo rings were directional
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:27:05 it didnt kill all life EVERYWHERE
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:27:14 so they could just use it on IoM star clusters
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:28:17 also forerunners had the composer so they could turn entire armies against their will and make them forcefully fight for the ecumene
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:29:02 why does anyone think IoM stands a chance against forerunners
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:29:13 its such a stomp its ridiculous
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:29:39 not to mention that the forerunners had tens of millions of naval warships
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:29:49 including millions of dreadnaughts that used gravity as a weapon
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:30:00 tearing entire enemy starships apart just using gravitational waves
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:30:10 not to mention the planet-killing starships
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:30:53 the forerunners could make stars supernova

the-dump 2022-03-28 12:31:44 the forerunner fleet was virtually omnipresent in comparison to the imperial navy
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:31:51 travel in the warp can take weeks, even years
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:32:01 forerunner ships can travel across the galaxy in minutes
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:32:30 also the forerunner ships can take a beating like champs
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:33:10 the didact didn't even notice the relatively small hole that the Infinity's super macs made in the mantle's approach
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:33:21 and plus forerunner ships had the ability to self-repair
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:34:05 yes
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:34:13 he wouldnt have cared
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:34:42 cos the people who build halo stuff in this server are addicted to UNSC and covenant
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:34:45 nothing else
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:35:15 yea unsc get vanished instantly lo
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:35:32 nah covenant dies too
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:35:43 their empire is quite small
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:35:50 it only covers a fraction of the milky way
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:35:51 btw
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:36:31 they had poor leadership too
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:36:48 they'd kill themselves before the IoM does anything lol
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:37:21 they can if its at the beginning
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:37:25 humanity and the covenant succeeded
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:37:29 the IoM should too
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:37:42 if it spreads beyond a few star systems the entire galaxy is fucked
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:38:16 imperium of mankind
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:38:40 silentium flood also had access to indestructible weaponized star roads
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:38:47 the imperium cant do anything
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:38:58 it took the halos to destroy the star roads
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:39:03 the imperium has nothing like that
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:39:13 the flood likes mass
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:39:15 it likes a lot of mass
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:39:21 imperium going to be dinner
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:39:42 the forerunners had 300 million colonized worlds alone
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:39:51 they had billions more uninhabited worlds under their control
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:40:53 factual
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:41:53 while intelligence of hosts does matter, biomass also increases its computational power
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:42:03 they can form a gravemind on a single planet within a day or two
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:42:41 man who needs weapons
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:42:48 flood literally threw SPACESHIPS at the enemy
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:43:35 throw rocks
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:43:36 easy
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:45:18 lets say, a single ship worth
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:45:25 like how high charity was infected within a day
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:46:08 why
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:46:21 gang warfare
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:46:22 what
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:46:39 flood infects people within seconds of death
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:47:13 the flood dont necessarily need creatures with nervous systems
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:47:17 they can use them as biomass to create pure forms
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:49:24 exponential growth
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:50:48 using slipspace, the forerunners could visit other dimensions
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:50:52 so the flood could literally do the same
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:52:07 why is it poorly understood
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:52:39 br
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:53:11 how large is the imperial navy
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:55:02 which faction
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:55:07 so
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:55:13 the flood had access to precursor weapons
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:55:16 and constructions
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:55:19 the precursors were gods
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:55:26 listen man
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:55:45 do you think the IoM stands a chance against indestructible extradimensional weaponized space roads
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:55:53 which the flood used
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:56:07 the halos were the only thing able to take it on
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:56:15 does the IoM have anything like the halos
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:57:10 so how do they even make stuff
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:57:26 where does their industry come from
the-dump 2022-03-28 12:57:35 if barely anyone in the imperium is smart enough to build

creations-chat 2022-12-27 12:26:03 theyre literally called digital camoflauge patterns. diff camo families exist and they share the same or similar pattern.
creations-chat 2022-12-27 12:42:52 with different textures, and a lack of shapes besides the square‚Ä¶not at this stage no. digital camo on a 4x3 surface is also difficult to replicate because it just looks more like random giant blocks of colour than a pixelated camo pattern so you might need a bigger sample to test things out on

help 2023-01-22 11:37:35 longer barrel
help 2023-01-22 11:38:21 show your design
help 2023-01-22 11:38:57 whats a classic 3x3 magnet cannon
help 2023-01-22 11:39:11 just screenshot it
help 2023-01-22 12:14:50 why are all your magnets at the back
help 2023-01-22 12:15:08 acceleration isnt uniform with all the cutters
help 2023-01-22 12:15:59 you need magnets along the barrel placed evenly
help 2023-01-22 12:16:43 so what if it has enough range for all the cutters
help 2023-01-22 12:17:00 nope
help 2023-01-22 12:18:25 yes
help 2023-01-22 12:18:30 because magnets apply more force the closer an object is
help 2023-01-22 12:19:00 no
help 2023-01-22 12:19:17 not if your barrel is longer
help 2023-01-22 12:19:21 and you can add a choke
help 2023-01-22 12:20:42 yes
help 2023-01-22 12:20:44 almost
help 2023-01-22 12:24:35 I can explain further
help 2023-01-22 12:24:54 magnets are identical in range and strength, but on the left the red ball is further away
help 2023-01-22 12:25:35 now the reason why the magnet launches the red ball at a lower velocity is because there is less distance for the magnet to act upon the red ball
help 2023-01-22 12:25:53 therefore, the cutters at the back accelerate faster than the cutters at the front
help 2023-01-22 12:26:12 because it's not uniform the cutters in the back actually disrupt the structure of your projectiles and cause inaccuracy
help 2023-01-22 12:29:26 javit do you know how to design a choke too
help 2023-01-22 12:29:29 so you can lower the spread
help 2023-01-22 12:31:57 nah fuck tutorials

help 2023-01-22 12:33:34 unless im missing something
help 2023-01-22 12:33:52 and this wont really help you
help 2023-01-22 12:35:23 I guess you can motorlock the magnets into position
help 2023-01-22 12:35:32 or just place them outside
help 2023-01-22 12:36:28 idk I always used superstrength
help 2023-01-22 12:44:30 slow them down
help 2023-01-22 12:44:55 or from the back to front, go lower strength to higher strength
help 2023-01-22 12:48:47 you contribute nothing of use here

the-dump 2023-01-29 01:03:01 looks like a car
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:03:11 but with shitty video quality so it appears as a spider
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:23:12 could also just be an insect on the lens
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:23:49 yea but a small one on the lens will look big at a distance
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:24:21 artifacting possible too
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:24:28 i doubt its a giant spider cos those only exist in australia
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:25:43 you good
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:26:03 this is average australian spider
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:27:00 could be an animal idk
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:27:30 yeah but animals have 4 legs dude
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:27:55 you can easily mistake it for moving like a spider since its multilegged
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:30:15 nah looks too small for a pit
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:31:01 cos if it was a pitbull sized spider it would appear smaller at that distance
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:31:22 the massive animal sized ones are all extinct
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:31:28 died with the dinosaurs
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:31:52 nah they're 100% dead lol
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:32:16 if they were still alive they'd be heavily documented
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:32:53 and like
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:33:00 giant insects evolved to be smaller anyway if they did survive
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:33:16 the reason they were that big was because earth had a higher oxygen content in the atmosphere
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:33:21 so it made it easier for bugs to grow larger
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:33:57 yeah dont worry lol you're not going to get facehugged by a giant spider
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:34:03 either artifacting or an animal
the-dump 2023-01-29 01:34:10 cameras do mess up sometimes

bug-reports 2023-03-21 02:44:29 hes just skipping to pc2, except we might not even get that this year at this rate
bug-reports 2023-03-21 02:54:18 if you read pins you‚Äôd know repeating a known bug for the 200th time is a waste of time
bug-reports 2023-03-21 02:54:25 but i dont think u realise that
bug-reports 2023-03-21 02:54:28 <:clueless:942802644043464734>
bug-reports 2023-03-21 02:54:59 no shit
bug-reports 2023-03-21 02:55:31 but im making this point because you‚Äôre in the same boat as that guy
bug-reports 2023-03-21 03:04:39 
bug-reports 2023-03-21 03:07:27 what excuse
bug-reports 2023-03-21 03:08:17 we dont need to excuse you being a dumbass, thats your business
bug-reports 2023-03-21 03:08:37 we have nothing to do with it, sorry buddy
bug-reports 2023-03-21 03:09:18 how exactly wont you shut the fuck up
bug-reports 2023-03-21 03:11:00 im not wasting my time on this anymore
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:21:08 not all cr units are in coc though
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:21:22 and if he makes megaknight
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:21:26 he deserves to burn in hell for all eternity
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:21:47 megaknight users have no brain
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:22:02 they think its just the win button but get fked from a guy with 2.6 hog cycle
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:23:03 megaknight try not to waste 7 elixir challenge (impossible)
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:23:26 it isnt
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:23:49 it can destroy a 13 elixir golem push and still have counterpush potential
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:24:00 beatdown decks are rarer now
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:24:02 just because of megaknight
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:24:27 yea but megaknight can already sweep up supporting troops
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:24:31 they wont have high hp
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:25:19 the point of megaknight is to kill a 13 elixir push and still be tanky enough to counterpush only for 7 elixir
contest-chat 2023-03-21 09:25:44 granted nobody with megaknight has a brain so they cant use his op ass properly
contest-chat 2023-03-21 10:01:06 who even uses night witch lol
contest-chat 2023-03-21 10:01:19 and with fisherman you can kingtower activate lots of things so it really doesnt matter
contest-chat 2023-03-21 10:01:58 often you have to sacrifice megaknight getting jump hit on your princess tower before that even works
contest-chat 2023-03-21 10:05:05 90% of the time megaknight is easy to kill because the person using it is completely braindead
contest-chat 2023-03-21 10:05:17 if they actually have a solid deck and play well you are in trouble
contest-chat 2023-03-21 10:05:31 that 1 card will counter entire beatdown decks
contest-chat 2023-03-21 11:37:04 ARCHER QUEEN FEET
contest-chat 2023-03-21 11:37:06 SOMEONE BUILD NOW
contest-chat 2023-03-21 13:25:00 whoever build archer queen feet instawin
contest-chat 2023-03-22 04:28:11 yes lets kill a whole deck archetype that added variation to the game before megaknight was added
contest-chat 2023-03-22 04:28:48 really man
contest-chat 2023-03-22 04:28:49 no way
contest-chat 2023-03-22 04:29:34 yea because megaknight users are dumbass
contest-chat 2023-03-22 04:30:02 cr is boring
contest-chat 2023-03-22 04:30:05 because half the battles is megaknight
contest-chat 2023-03-22 04:30:32 still exists
contest-chat 2023-03-22 04:30:45 and midladder is hell
contest-chat 2023-03-22 04:31:02 f2p players get stuck in midladder for a long time
contest-chat 2023-03-22 04:31:12 so they have to deal with stinky megaknight users who havent showered in a week
contest-chat 2023-03-22 04:31:28 top ladder, sure isnt as bad, but its still boring to play against
contest-chat 2023-03-22 04:32:06 nah its ok

it was a plane crazy build so you had no right to repost that in <#384025409945337856> 
you have no right to dish out mega downvotes either because you're still a whitename
creations-chat 2023-04-20 09:14:38 everyone already knew how shit his builds were. my mega downvote was a joke but it was ultimately a plane crazy build so you should be blacklisted just for reposting it.

btw, you dont just repeat what was said a couple hours ago and expect it to be funnier.
creations-chat 2023-04-20 09:16:53 i already got the unde kicked from this server

creations-chat 2023-05-11 13:04:23 a lot of it is an overblown meme lol, ppl just like to joke about 1 exposed motorlock getting you 100 downvotes
creations-chat 2023-05-11 13:07:14 but while basically the entire server can ignore a couple sparse exposed locks, it really detracts from the actual build if you have too many. it highlights a lazy builder who hasnt bothered to polish their own build. 

the "EXPOSE MOTOLOK!1!!1 ZOMG" joke comes children thinking people hate their build solely for the locks when, as a matter of fact, theyre just aesthetically displeasing entirely
creations-chat 2023-05-11 13:10:47 no <#384025409945337856> doesn't really care about PVP function unless its a groundbreaking innovation. PCC cares more about looks than anything
creations-chat 2023-05-11 13:13:15 adding onto that,
yes pvp has to be sacrificed for appearance, but a skilled player can make the tradeoff negligible. that's what PCC wants to see - a well rounded build that has had a lot of thought and effort put into it.

the-dump 2023-06-10 05:41:13 its as if they were being used for battle?? t14 armata engineers be taking notes rn
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:48:25 who said that lmao
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:48:29 some 13 year old on twitter?
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:51:06 burden of evidence is on you for that one
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:51:46 theres a lack of important people claiming the leopard 2a6 was the best in the world
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:51:59 you can't even name one person?
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:52:31 yes and russia abandoned a number of t90s for ukrainian farmers
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:52:38 one is in florida now
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:52:40 whats your point
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:54:53 the T90M that ukrainians captured is newer than the 2A6
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:55:00 so the destruction of a leopard 2 is irrelevant really
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:55:23 the russians can take the technology all they want, but they cant mass produce anything out of it lmao

the-dump 2023-06-10 06:57:00 who lmao?
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:57:14 the commander of the 1st tank brigade disagreed with western MBTs because of the logistical strain
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:58:05 doesn't look like anyone there would "cry" over tanks lol
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:58:27 and what is sent isn't even the newest generation so the insinuation that they're supposed to be the "best tanks" is complete bullshit dude
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:59:02 lets talk about the t14 for a change
the-dump 2023-06-10 06:59:13 supposed to be "revolutionary," but not one seen on the battlefield?
the-dump 2023-06-10 07:00:26 only recorded in russian-controlled airspace
the-dump 2023-06-10 07:00:57 russia is a whole generation behind in terms of air power
the-dump 2023-06-10 07:02:10 from my understanding the helicopters are decent though
the-dump 2023-06-10 07:02:26 the USA actually bought some MI-24s from russia
the-dump 2023-06-10 11:55:16 
the-dump 2023-06-10 20:23:38 a lot of modern tanks have shot traps
the-dump 2023-06-10 20:23:57 but they dont really matter because most tank battles are at very long ranges

the-dump 2023-06-11 00:26:00 life expectancy for gay people is up to 20 years less than the norm according to the national library of medicine
the zero abuse project states that lgbt make up 1/5 child lovers, despite lgbt being 1/14 the US population. therefore they are 3x more likely to be nonces.
a survey of 600 furries shows that only around 10% of furries are straight
despite zoophiles being 2% of the population, wikifur shows that furries make up 18% of zoophiles
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:26:35 so no this isn't "heehee hoohoo" because it's not a laughing matter
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:27:06 and the national library of medicine has shown that there has been some level of correlation between father absence and lgbt

the-dump 2023-06-11 00:36:20 but i dont think they realise its a gateway to harmful activities
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:37:25 but the ones who try shove this agenda down people's throats and deface the millenia-lasting icon of a rainbow are very annoying
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:38:44 the australian institute of health and welfare shows that LGBT people are 1.5x more likely to consume alcohol at damaging amounts

the-dump 2023-06-11 00:40:47 the CDC outlines that there is a higher correlation between LGBT and mental disorders
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:42:14 one could argue that this is due to not having the "right resources"
the-dump 2023-06-11 00:43:20 HOWEVER, the netherlands statistics agency says that gay couples tend to be wealthy, hence they should be able to easily afford life benefitting services

creations-chat 2023-07-11 10:45:01 youve had your chance to ask for feedback before posting it in <#384025409945337856> so nobody is obligated to pay you a critique for a downvote.
creations-chat 2023-07-11 10:47:05 which means nothing in relation to what i said
what is your argument lol
creations-chat 2023-07-11 10:50:22 wow you missed my point so hard you might as well fly to the moon now.

people arent obligated to give feedback. because people can talk about his build here does not mean they want to, otherwise they would have already.
he has no right to mass ping everyone who downvoted his build
