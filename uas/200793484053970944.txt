falded
plane-crazy 2020-07-30 00:53:01 I donâ€™t know how to react to those
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 23:36:32 ok
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:15:47 makes sense
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:15:06 idk why it's happening
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:15:02 my connection is fine
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:13:27 idk why it's doing it
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:13:24 yea my creation is 100 blocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:13:14 so guess we just have to wait for it to be fixed
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:13:03 ah alright
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:12:33 also is this an issue on my end or the game's?
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:11:36 how do I avoid this happening?
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:09:46 and of course out of nowhere I end up dying to invisible rocket and gun spam
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:09:23 then their build just goes invisible
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:09:18 because on my screen i just light up other creations with gunfire
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 12:08:58 anyone else experience an issue where other builds go invisible if you shoot them with a gun enough?
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:51:02 is that one of those ISIS trucks
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:48:34 this is how i'll violate the geneva convention
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:48:13 next up im going to add tons of shredder bugs to accompany my turret
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:47:27 ultimate pvp weapon
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:43:20 ah alright thanks
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:43:03 is it actually a weapon?
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:42:53 what does the water jet do?
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:17:20 im just gonna keep experimenting till i get it
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:17:15 aight
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:16:34 i've been struggling for the past 10 minutes
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:16:29 how
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:16:17 con do you know how to compress guns with motorlocks?
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:16:02 what's wrong with motorlocks
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:14:44 how tf do you motorlock guns
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:08:06 it just keeps tilting in the opposite direction that the rotors are rotating
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:07:52 i dont care about the heli spazzing out because of the motor gods
plane-crazy 2020-07-25 04:06:54 anyone know why my heli does this when i try to make it fly? https://gyazo.com/bca0a306e1dc2a7782233cc216b0e7a2
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 11:52:45 yes or no
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 11:52:45 meh is not an answer
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 11:52:35 been trying to build it and things have been VERY cramped
plane-crazy 2020-07-23 11:52:27 does my heli looks like it has enough room for a swashplate
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:56:42 prolly gonna screw this up
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:56:37 so uh
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:56:36 this is my first time making a ship
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:56:13 a fold and a half
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:56:12 so like
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:55:10 2?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:55:02 also how many folds do you think this will be?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:53:41 yea
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:52:45 thanks
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:52:44 alright
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:52:22 or can I just spam either of them inside my ship hull
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:52:18 is there any difference between the front and middle ones?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:52:11 aight also does it matter what type is used?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:51:53 or is it just guesswork
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:51:51 ok is there a way to know how many pontoons I need?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 11:51:22 what are pontoons for
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 01:18:39 child nsfw was an actual thing?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 01:17:12 how are there outlines
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 08:41:43 tfw working on your build for 1 hour and roblox crashes before you can save
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 08:21:19 is it better to make tank tracks out of half wedges + motors or wedges + motors
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:43:09 guess im remaking the treads
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:42:47 yea
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:42:45 i mean
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:41:48 or bad
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:41:42 is that good
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:41:38 58/s
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:41:37 like
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:40:46 <@456226577798135808> i get constant 60fps
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:39:57 because of roblox physics
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:39:51 i have to remake my entire tank tread
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:39:48 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:37:33 slow as hell
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:37:31 yea even at graphics 1
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:36:55 ah
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:36:23 my issue is roblox physics
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:36:19 my fps is fine
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:36:09 no
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:35:46 is there a way to stop roblox physics slowing down when I test my tank?
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:11:12 now the server lagging hard
plane-crazy 2020-07-17 02:11:00 why did i think this would be a good idea
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 15:06:56 yea
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 15:06:49 now time to make the other set of treads and lag the entire server
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 15:06:09 ez clap
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 15:06:08 problem solved
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 15:06:05 
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 14:58:57 i'll try those
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 14:58:55 pistons dont sound too bad
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 14:58:21 and yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 14:58:18 the treads decided to spazz out
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 14:58:11 when i motorlocked the treads
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 14:57:57 didnt work out for me
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 14:57:55 i tried
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 14:57:41 if u got the solution just ping me in that channel
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 14:57:31 also I got a bit more complex question in <#478584971670454284> regarding how to tighten tank treads
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 14:57:10 aight thanks
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 14:55:45 whats damping for suspension
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 10:52:14 any yt tutorials you guys would recommend for tank tracks?
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 10:36:35 pros and cons of both?
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 10:36:30 functioning tank tracks or conveyors?
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 10:12:05 hatches are in the wrong spot for it to be a tiger turret
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 10:11:42 yea fair enough lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 10:11:13 thoughts on this panzer 4 turret?
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 10:11:09 
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 08:29:57 also is it worth creating tanks with working tracks?
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 08:28:48 aight thanks
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 08:27:14 you should become a comedian
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 08:27:11 you're pretty funny
plane-crazy 2020-07-16 08:25:52 how many items are in the summer event?
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 13:20:03 but not as much as actual wing panels
plane-crazy 2020-05-25 13:19:57 I think they contribute to lift
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 07:07:45 ok ty
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 07:07:27 does fabric actually increase friction?
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 06:48:54 when was that?
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 06:38:49 oh I see
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 06:38:20 yea
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 06:38:13 what are you making
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 06:32:38 
plane-crazy 2020-05-03 06:32:19 making a tripod from war of the worlds, should i make the sides lower?
plane-crazy 2020-04-24 04:33:46 any idea of how to simulate a space station without gravity gamepass?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 10:40:07 ok thanks
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 10:39:32 is impact speed the speed it takes for the block to explode or what?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 09:03:37 out of 30 votes how many of them do u think would be downvotes
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:52:19 so many braincells lost in one image
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:27:23 is this an easter egg
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:27:07 can someone explain
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:27:05 my jet engine sounds like someone screaming
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 08:24:52 what happened to my jet engine sounds
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 07:17:31 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 07:15:31 so they aren't decals
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 07:15:26 oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 07:14:47 how do you put decals on your vehicles?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:29:10 holy jesus thats so good
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:28:01 then you'll just find one that clicks perfectly
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:27:52 just keep trying different arrangements of triangles/wedges i guess
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:27:31 then who
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:27:19 pyro's one is the best
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:27:11 i've seen better too
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:26:31 still working on it
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 05:26:24 yo guys what do you think
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:26:15 and i didnt know why it kept flipping upside down
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:26:08 i spammed helium on one end of the plane
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:26:01 im so stupid
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:25:04 wait hold on what
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:24:52 nice
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:21:46 what about helium
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:21:42 ok ty
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:21:15 guil do you know how much density a normal block and helium block has?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:20:27 very fun
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:20:25 this is gonna be
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:19:41 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:19:14 im slapping full density ballasts on one end and helium blocks on the other but i dont feel like its moving the CoM arrow by much, any suggestions?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:10:38 thanks
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:10:09 oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:07:25 i dont understand how the block is changed if this is on
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 03:03:00 does this concentrate all of its mass into the center of the block or what
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 02:48:53 does locking pistons do nothing?
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:15:51 epic
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:13:46 huge jet engine looks fine to me
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:03:52 i havent made a custom jet engine before
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 01:03:15 which jet engine should i use
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 00:54:12 i'll just assume that my a10 is average
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 00:53:44 ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 00:53:17 what would it be
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 00:53:14 if you had a choice to downvote or upvote
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 00:52:45 is mine a bad a10
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 00:52:34 is that true
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 00:52:28 i heard that so many people made a10s that people just downvote them for no reason
plane-crazy 2020-04-21 00:51:51 yo guys hows my a10 looking so far
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 23:50:55 thanks
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 23:50:54 oh
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 23:50:19 whats the difference between having physics on and unanchoring the block
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:27:54 since I was thinking that it'd blow it up when you pressed the button but that's already like that by default
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:27:42 ok and what does arm on key do
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:26:28 also another question what does ignore self do?
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:25:50 wait im not on pvp
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:24:59 why isnt this blowing up on impact
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:19:43 good idea
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:19:07 everytime i shoot
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:18:58 if i try make the railgun mobile then the vehicle would spazz out
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:18:41 yes
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:18:32 explosive balls
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 12:18:09 made my first railgun
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 11:13:52 also is there a way to unlock a locked motor
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 11:12:21 ok then idk
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 11:12:16 it helps a lot
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 11:12:10 i had a tank with the same problem, i just maxed out damping and stiffness
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:39:55 ok ty
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:39:36 ur gonna have to explain that to me
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:39:15 but if i put it one block higher it'd be unrealistic
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:39:09 how would i fix my a10 wing being too low
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:39:06 
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:36:45 wait pyro are you still there?
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:26:28 there goes my ego
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:25:10 hmmm
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:24:20 does it look fine from this angle
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:24:08 
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:22:53 yes or no though
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:22:38 no i'll figure the functional stuff out later
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:20:25 should i move the wings up?
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:20:16 quick question bro
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:20:13 hey normies
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:17:39 or building similar aircraft
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:17:14 exo are u familiar with A10s
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:16:50 cockpits are a pain in the neck
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:16:42 i feel u man
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:12:30 cockpit is the most frustrating part so far
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:12:20 looks pretty simple
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:12:18 and some examples from other a10s people built
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:12:06 nah i got a ton of reference photos
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:09:58 also how does the nose look now
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:09:44 something like this
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:09:43 
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:09:24 what about blue camo or something
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:08:30 idk lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:08:12 maybe a bit of paint though
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:08:05 it looks cool
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:08:01 nothing
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:02:52 looks like an ISIS vehicle
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:00:52 cornerwedges?
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:00:40 heres an upclose image
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 10:00:21 what should I do to it
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 09:59:35 ok how do i make it look more like an a10
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 09:59:06 any suggestions to my a10 so far?
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 07:46:18 im just gonna assume it already got suggested because i'm too lazy
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 07:43:40 thats pretty weird tbh
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 07:43:13 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 07:42:56 or do you have to recolor it every time
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 07:42:49 is there a way to automatically make a block a certain color when you place it?
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:58:13 ok
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:58:12 bruh
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:57:43 bruh what
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:57:05 is my tiger turret too small
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:49:35 so people keep thinking its another tank
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:47:27 its hard to get details right if its small
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:47:21 i shouldve built the tank larger
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:46:51 time to commit blitzkrieg
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:46:35 tiger 1 with guided missile sounds op
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:43:19 its my tanks only decent defense against aircraft in pvp
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:42:39 ok so I'll just keep it like that
plane-crazy 2020-04-20 04:42:04 tried my best to make a working mounted machinegun, is there any other ways that doesn't make this look garbage?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:12:52 stegg is there any alternative methods you'd lay out the suspension
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:11:46 help
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:11:44 https://gyazo.com/bdeefd1cbca270fa867e86db1aaf50ba
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:10:16 i dont either it just goes crazy
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:09:43 i changed the stiffness to 40
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:09:38 even worse now
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:08:36 would the way i laid out the suspension be the problem?
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:07:40 4.5 length
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:07:39 60 stiffness
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:07:34 20 damping
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:07:14 even worse this time
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:07:09 still spazzes out
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:05:27 aight
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:05:03 and thats for all suspension
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:04:51 free length is on 2, everything else is maxed
plane-crazy 2020-04-19 08:04:33 my tank's wheels keep spazzing out
