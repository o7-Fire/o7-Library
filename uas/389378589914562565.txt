plane-crazy 2020-06-30 20:17:51 niceee, accidentally stalled with my concorde aha
plane-crazy 2020-04-18 15:07:58 wat
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:18:21 yeah i reckon its mostly through ingame purchases and ads
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:17:59 but the kraken is unforgiving
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:17:53 i love KSP
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:17:39 i mean i think the reason hes created it on roblox is because its relatively easy to code compared to other engines and its also free
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:17:06 imagine if madattak remade the game on unity
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:16:22 yeah fax
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:15:56 i respect due to roblox game engine bug fixes are probably quite hard
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:15:40 and i mean every update says it has "performance updates and bug fixes" but i never seem to feel a difference
plane-crazy 2020-04-10 15:15:13 yeah maybe instead of adding trail blocks they should actually work on game fixes
