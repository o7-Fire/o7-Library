creations-chat 2021-06-24 19:48:49 oh wait nevermind I got confused because it looked similar

I mainly thought it was the tutorial because of the edges of the wings
creations-chat 2021-06-24 19:52:45 oh cool
creations-chat 2021-06-24 20:46:46 I feel like my plane is going to get a shit ton of downvotes

creations-chat 2021-06-25 19:28:50 all you had to do was let me know not to repost and then we wouldnt have this whole arguement and deleting a repost from a day ago isnt going to fix anything. You are being more childesh then I am

Ok but still what is deleting it going to do?
creations-chat 2021-06-25 19:31:11 Ok 1 more question. What about the other people that repost old creations and dont have to deal with this

creations-chat 2021-06-26 00:06:36 besides the oil rig already covers the entire plot so if I folded it, it would be longer than its width and would look silly

creations-chat 2022-01-16 02:32:48 Anything I could improve on?

Its a custom Ironclad for context.
creations-chat 2022-01-16 02:37:22 Im making it more smooth on the front rn
It already looks better
creations-chat 2022-01-16 02:41:20 ?

creations-chat 2022-01-16 03:15:05 What is that?
It looks like a Space Freighter
creations-chat 2022-01-16 03:17:21 Its looks pretty cool
creations-chat 2022-01-16 03:27:47 I play that game actually
I just got 3k score
creations-chat 2022-01-16 03:29:59 The devs made the game way less grindy now and you can get ore and credits more easily
creations-chat 2022-01-16 05:13:48 Well which is better
creations-chat 2022-01-16 05:22:43 What kind of ship should I build?
creations-chat 2022-01-16 05:30:56 Ya By design which is better
creations-chat 2022-01-16 06:01:46 Ive slightly improved the looks of the Ironclad
creations-chat 2022-01-16 06:20:32 Thankyou
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:19:03 I built a Naval Boarding ship
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:30:42 Well I made 2 really good ships then most of the ships I make now are small or bad
Key word Most
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:32:45 You shouldnt be talking [Terrain specialist I Designer II]

Nothing im just saying you shouldnt
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:35:49 Is getting expert shipwright easier than expert terrain specialist plus Vtols are hard too make
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:37:51 I know Im talking about TranquilGaze

So then we both have some of the easiest ranks too get
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:42:03 Well I think thats what he said ya same with terrain
creations-chat 2022-01-17 07:44:24 what would be considered the highest rank then
creations-chat 2022-01-18 06:51:20 Why are Hars stadards so high

Thought so
creations-chat 2022-01-18 06:54:05 Does big = good?
creations-chat 2022-01-18 06:56:39 I was looking through hall of fame and I see this oil rig which is quite large but it had no detail at all but it was a few years ago so
creations-chat 2022-01-18 06:59:22 looks chonky
creations-chat 2022-01-18 07:03:22 Man the wheels on my railgun are huge, they are 4 blocks wide 3 blocks tall and 18 of them on each side
creations-chat 2022-01-18 07:05:43 Then what would they be called AWACS
Cylinders?
creations-chat 2022-01-18 08:09:31 How can I improve on my Big Boy Tank
creations-chat 2022-01-18 08:12:09 I did the slate because it looks better than just default and I didn't want to use metal because its too plain so what materials make sense?
creations-chat 2022-01-18 08:14:11 If I improve the Tank am I allowed to repost it because I edited it?
Ok good I do the paint first
creations-chat 2022-01-18 10:16:03 This helps thank you I will work on it tomorrow
creations-chat 2022-01-19 02:41:52 So from yesterday I asked how too improve my tank, Bad news Im lazy and gave up on it

Good News Im Starting from scratch and making a better tank with the detail all put into it so I dont have too change everything later
creations-chat 2022-01-19 02:44:09 can I? it has 47
creations-chat 2022-01-19 02:51:08 Im not doing it for the ranks anymore
I just want too improve my building skills
creations-chat 2022-01-19 03:02:12 so I should use a mix of materials together instead of just 1
creations-chat 2022-01-19 03:07:37 The front of the tank so far I havent decided where too put the cockpit or whatever its called
creations-chat 2022-01-19 03:37:59 My new tank is going too have guided missles instead of cannons
creations-chat 2022-01-20 05:34:13 Rat has 16 upvotes Including me
its just really good pixel art its not against rules
creations-chat 2022-01-20 05:36:34 I am Barack Obama and I approve this message
I bet you dont know Obamas last name
creations-chat 2022-01-20 05:59:50 Somebody is jealous
He put lots of effort into that Pixel Art give him credit
creations-chat 2022-01-20 06:05:59 Its really good Pixel art
Ok? RBK is typing
creations-chat 2022-01-20 06:10:43 You shouldnt have postest that low quality wedge
creations-chat 2022-01-20 22:03:06 I agree and I am apart of this group
creations-chat 2022-01-23 02:37:51 Now there are so many people building hallways and its so easy too get upvotes because its just a long thin room that can be  made in less than an hour
creations-chat 2022-01-23 02:40:26 Example how does this https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/934303680625254510

creations-chat 2022-01-23 02:43:23 I realise that but im talking about effort
Its stupid that a detailed good looking Vtol gets less upvotes than a Hallway: In my opinion
creations-chat 2022-01-23 02:46:02 Well Im tired of going too creations everyday and seeing multiple hallways with dozens of upvotes and then builds that took more effort and hours too make get less than that, Especially if they look better.
creations-chat 2022-01-23 02:49:02 What car?
I didnt link any car
No I linked a hallway, vtol, and a dragon
creations-chat 2022-01-23 02:57:48 I guess im unchad then
creations-chat 2022-01-23 03:00:27 When you get ratioed on Discord
creations-chat 2022-01-23 03:04:00 Hypocrite you just made a joke

creations-chat 2022-01-23 06:41:38 what the fuck
creations-chat 2022-01-27 09:19:07 I wish unspeakable never made that video
creations-chat 2022-01-27 09:25:56 Pros and cons of unspeakable making that video.

Pros: It gave plane crazy more attention and players.

Cons: It gave plane crazy more attention from 4 year old kids.
The kids make the game look bad 
Toddlers are idiots.
