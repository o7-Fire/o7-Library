creations-chat 2021-05-05 16:42:10 i would say to use the black bullet point symbol for inside the barrel at the front
creations-chat 2021-05-05 16:47:54 that most likely wouldnt work due to the amount of space between the front and back wheels from the body, the treads would get caught on the body which would prevent it from moving

creations-chat 2021-07-17 19:20:43 whatever, i dont know a thing or two about helicopters
creations-chat 2021-07-17 19:56:47 i may as well just delete it if you guys hate it that much
creations-chat 2021-07-17 20:02:24 ohhh okay i get it now
you are the type of people that want everything to be correct but if two or three things arent correct you hate on it
well, im just gonna say this
i tried my best, it looks good in my opinion, and im happy with it
so, you go ahead and hate on it, i'll just ignore you
creations-chat 2021-07-17 20:04:33 i mean, im good at the game, but im not good with building helicopters/planes, probably explains why you guys think its bad
i would start posting pictures of my builds here but i dont wanna look dumb so :/ (even though i am dumb)
