creations-chat 2022-12-11 20:28:14 usually just nerds who think motor locking is the only way to build a good aircraft aircraft, or their just trolling
creations-chat 2022-12-11 20:31:07 man i suck at motor locking its fuckin hard as hell (pause)
creations-chat 2022-12-11 20:33:56 I think using the tools you automatically get in game and actually creating something good is more skillful than making a whole ass motor locked plane, that still looks good
creations-chat 2022-12-11 20:35:58 eh i should've worded it better, not saying if you use motor lock you're unskilled, i mean me myself im pretty bad at making builds if im gonna be honest
