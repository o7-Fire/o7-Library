the-dump 2021-10-24 16:54:41 Can somebody post one of those videos with the furry thumbnail and the actual video is ready edgy and has little dark age in the background?
the-dump 2021-10-24 16:54:55 No
the-dump 2021-10-24 16:55:01 I am a furry, I just want the video
the-dump 2021-10-24 16:55:15 What in the world
the-dump 2021-10-24 16:55:30 I'm just looking for an edgy person to post that
the-dump 2021-10-24 16:55:48 Nice
the-dump 2021-11-04 20:33:14 Mood
the-dump 2021-11-21 20:58:06 It stands for entertainment
the-dump 2021-11-21 20:58:17 Charles Entertainment Cheese
the-dump 2021-11-21 21:03:09 No it's... Not?
the-dump 2021-11-21 21:03:15 It is a joke about life being bad
the-dump 2021-11-21 21:03:23 Not chuck-ee cheeses actual name
the-dump 2021-11-21 21:03:34 And the actual name with "entertainment" is also a meme
the-dump 2021-11-21 21:03:41 And not actually correct
the-dump 2021-11-21 21:04:22 I get the joke
the-dump 2021-11-21 21:04:27 I am making an additional joke
the-dump 2021-11-21 21:05:02 Fine
