help 2020-07-10 09:38:08 <@!299289130964090881> you got any idea how to make this thing turn without breaking the rules of heli tech role?
help 2020-07-10 09:38:45 what would be the design of it?
help 2020-07-10 09:40:15 alright.
help 2020-07-10 09:40:35 gotta hope im not dumb and make the same mistake
help 2020-07-10 09:42:00 + would be nice if you can provide a in-game image of one.
help 2020-07-10 09:46:03 <@!299289130964090881> ill just go through trial and error just to find out
help 2020-07-10 09:46:23 as im trying to maintain the reference im making
help 2020-07-10 09:46:28 *see above*

waiting for a answer for the rear
help 2020-07-10 21:21:29 <@!400465835845615616> can you give me a answer for the rear?
help 2020-07-10 21:21:42 the heli rear im trying to make
help 2020-07-10 21:29:52 k that worked, but the question is how i would get it to move quicker
help 2020-07-10 21:31:17 <@!400465835845615616>
help 2020-07-10 21:32:04 <@!400465835845615616> so how would i build a thruster on it
help 2020-07-10 22:32:10 <@!400465835845615616> thank you for the help, i tinkered with the size because attempting a ducted fan would make the lift too light
help 2020-07-10 22:35:30 now i need a way to stabilize it, as it wobbles up and down during flight
help 2020-07-10 22:57:41 any ideas how to stabilize? 
https://gyazo.com/db9f97fe8b096ccd4c4fd2c8520bda66
help 2020-07-10 22:59:59 wobbles up and down, and i want it to at least wobble less
help 2020-07-10 23:06:29 alright.
help 2020-07-10 23:06:38 ill replace the current one with a 1x4 wedge tail
help 2020-07-10 23:09:51 <@!508065143905845248> bumped into a problem, if i do any longer tail, it will weigh it down even more
help 2020-07-10 23:15:55 ballasts don't help really.
help 2020-07-10 23:31:48 <@!299289130964090881> what should i do to stabilize the heli?
help 2020-07-10 23:32:01 the 1x4 wedge tail doesn't help out that much
help 2020-07-10 23:32:37 i use a 1x2 wedge tail and it works fine
help 2020-07-10 23:32:42 its just the wobble thing
help 2020-07-10 23:32:46 alright.

help 2020-07-11 01:18:23 Any way to make this hover in the air without it moving as much?
help 2020-07-11 01:18:32 + i need a viable way of making this move foward.
help 2020-07-11 01:28:29 used ballasts to weigh the front down ,that works in the foward part
help 2020-07-11 01:36:07 <@!508065143905845248> actually sorry i was wrong, the front was probably the main problem, so i added ballasts
help 2020-07-11 01:38:02 however what would be the best way to make it hover in the air?
help 2020-07-11 01:38:03 <@!508065143905845248>
help 2020-07-11 02:10:06 interesting.

creations-chat 2021-12-01 13:50:03 imo my build is kinda sucky but ah well, might try some other stuff later
creations-chat 2021-12-01 13:53:45 oh ya tbh, any criticism about that plane i made earlier?
looking foward to improve designs and such
creations-chat 2021-12-01 13:56:23 eh, limitations from the grid apply plus i was focused on making it small-ish
either way it functions fine enough, i guess
creations-chat 2021-12-01 14:00:11 question, how do motor locks even work for building designs, most of the time when i smack a missile into them they just implode onto themselves
creations-chat 2021-12-01 14:03:07 what plane should i design next thats probably going to get a 1:10 dislike ratio?
creations-chat 2021-12-01 14:06:15 not saying its bad or anything but that wing is cursed in my terms
response to below: ya, go for it i guess
bot-central 2021-12-01 14:26:18 -servers
creations-chat 2021-12-01 14:54:53 kinda just scrapped the btd6 plane stuff, this is moreso of a custom design now and doesn't look as bulky anymore
creations-chat 2021-12-01 15:18:28 final result of the edit
pilot can see, no janky blocks connecting and such
creations-chat 2021-12-01 15:47:51 any feedback on the thing i redid earlier so its not 4 cheese blocks holding it up?
