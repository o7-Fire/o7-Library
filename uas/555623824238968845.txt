- Colours are bland and takes away focus from the good parts of the build (use unique colours that draw you in, bits of orange, white, darker shades of grey, black, all sorts.) Still try to keep it somewhat accurate though.

- Although intakes/engines are rather too big, you could try making custom intakes/engines using a variety of different blocks (disconnectors, locked motors, hover engines, half wedges.) Literally possible to use any block if you can come up with a use for it.

- the shape overall is quite nice but it lacks the use of unique blocks (refer to the point above.)

- Try integrating angles into the build too

Possible blocks to use
  - Cutters
  - Ski Sections
  - Signs
  - Trails
  - Sparklers

The intakes width is larger than their hight. It ends up forming an almost stretched circle.

- Could be created using custom angles.

I understand that you may want an old or abandoned feel to the build, but, **corroded metal adds weight to ones build.**
Don't know if you went into this knowing that but i would personally recommend changing th material so it is easier to fly.

it may be that if flys perfectly fine but just thought i would warn you still.
creations-chat 2021-08-14 00:54:41 ||<@619312093962829849>||

The nose is very large in the width
  - Using half blocks, half wedges, and half wedge downs/ups 1 x 1/1 x 2s you can make a thinner but still similar to the original (I can dm you what i mean if need be) 

I cant really explain what else would need to be done but that should be a good starting point.

that loading mechanism is honestly the coolest and most unique system i've ever seen before.
It looks like it wouldn't jam that often and is very smooth.
What i dislike about it though is the efficiency.
It looks slower and bulkier than most other builds like this, adding to that fact that it's not going to be easy to implement it into any builds (not saying it is üòâ.)

Other than these facts i would say this build is insanely god like of a loading mechanism.

||Also im not over praising the build, i genuinely think it is absolutely awesome!||
creations-chat 2021-08-15 07:52:13 I agree with the comment above!
creations-chat 2021-08-15 08:00:37 ||<@457827362520694790>||
**note**
 Just noticed, you would have to have the entire loading section turn with the turret due to the fact that if not you would have to turn the turret back around just to load another shot!
creations-chat 2021-08-21 04:36:26 absolutely flawless üëç
