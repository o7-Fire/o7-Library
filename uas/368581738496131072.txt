creations-chat 2020-11-13 16:21:59 imagine using locked motors to make the windshield of a car
creations-chat 2020-11-13 16:57:58 "<-- scammer". undes: THATS ADOPT ME ONLY!!!
help 2020-11-17 00:41:37 there are many ways to fix it, the solution can vary on the position of the targeted motor two(s), on a tank turret it could be to just add a .2 torque motor on top of the motor 2 that acts as a base inside the turret while using motors to allow a frame to pass through and still have 180 degrees of space to travel. on steering you can add 2 motors to the front and back of the motors and then link them, depending on the suspension used you may have to use suspension to allow them to travel in vertical difference from each other. other more complicated systems work, and you may have to apply different settings, sometimes just add a full ballast block and see what happens. sorry for the text wall

bug-reports 2021-01-11 21:35:06 we all know that glitch. i used to experience it all the time when i made overly complicated suspension.  its nothing new and it happens when motors get stressed too much
bug-reports 2021-01-11 21:37:11 no it wouldn't stick bc of the crappy connection <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
bug-reports 2021-01-11 21:38:20 ok. that glitch is also nothing new. it happens when too muvh torque is applied to somethign then it glitches through. it becomes easier on treads due to the ammount of motors/ropes and speed + torque.
bug-reports 2021-01-11 21:40:17 addinga better connection or adding even a little bit more of a thivk surface will help
bug-reports 2021-01-11 21:40:22 there are a lot of ways to fix it

help 2021-01-11 21:44:41 Ice and fabric. you can also make them ballast blocks as they are set to .26 which is the weight of a normal block. you can bring it down to .15 to make it lighter than a normal block which will allow you to not have to use ice or fabric to make a lighter than normal chassis with blocks
help 2021-01-11 21:46:29 no
help 2021-01-11 21:46:36 yeah
help 2021-01-11 21:46:39 would be nice
help 2021-01-11 21:47:40 you can use corner blocks, or make custom corners using multiple blocks. or if you end up advanced enough you could use locked motors

creations-chat 2021-01-15 20:10:49 and yet ur only where u are now. just bc they got better rating doesn't mean they are more reliable, complicated, and advanced
creations-chat 2021-01-15 20:14:16 pcc is more concentrated on the asthetics. and being unable to tour the builds yourself can become misleading. it will even have an indoor park. which. due to my terraforming skills. will set it off^^^^yes we are. not fighting. just trying to prove eachother wrong ina friendly way
creations-chat 2021-01-15 20:17:04 ok. by then ill be done and averaging around 12K blocks

bug-reports 2021-01-19 20:34:07 not true. i hit skip all the time. its justa  lag and internet connection factor

creations-chat 2021-01-19 21:17:48 holy...
creations-chat 2021-01-20 01:05:30 make it a little less slanted inwards in other places rather than it all being slanted inwards everywhere, and the blocks of randomness on the left needs some adaption(unless they are placeholders which i doubt so) you could have some more horizontal wedges rather than all vertical so the eye has something to catch but make sure it doesn't look like crystals or hair which can happen unless you don't replace or add different blocks to tie it together. otherwise great start
bug-reports 2021-01-20 20:42:01 builds mixed, i loaded a build and parts of the otherone stayed
bug-reports 2021-01-20 20:56:30 ok

help 2021-01-22 20:37:39 physics, this is an issue real helis have. they solve it irl by using blade flapping, its when the side retreating backwards on the heli is going slower relative the the ground than the one going up the span of the heli which decreases lift on the right than the left

bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:31:54 oh
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:32:00 the thing that happened earlier
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:32:08 only happens with anchor blocks when thay are anchored
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:33:54 in the case of an anchor block being connected to a camera weld
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:34:58 any other camera weld that has been set will rotate the same distance from the other / central camera weld in the reverse direction it was rotated while also rotating its blocks the way it was assigned
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:36:17 yes
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:38:30 all blocks and welds that are concidered part of the rotation by default or being set to a block will rotate around the first camera weld made(first one with an anchor block) even if other anchors are in place after this, all locks will separate them from their anchors and all blocks attatched
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:39:07 attatched to the camera weld
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:39:08 side
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:39:32 the anchor will remain. but when it is unanchored it will teleport back to its location on the blocks that were separated
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:40:29 if the main pilot is anchored the weld will be postponed until unanchored.
bug-reports 2021-01-25 03:40:56 anchor does not have to be directly anchored to seat

help 2021-01-26 14:29:37 it physics
help 2021-01-26 14:30:28 it happens when a heli is moving forewards and it makes the retreating side of the rotor go slower relative to the ground and the attacking side faster than the heli which decreases lift on the retreating side and increases on the other likewise creating roll

help 2021-01-26 14:34:56 puting the engines that we typicaly use to adjust pitch on the tail just makes it easier for them due to mechanical advantage. but you can have them otherplaces or not at all and just use reaction wheels for everything like all of my recent helis (year olds)

help 2021-01-26 14:40:09 yes
help 2021-01-26 14:40:37 usualy i would use reg motors so you can have adjustable pitch rather than just 3 settings

**{ New Map}**
_{flat area}_

Tis is just a simple suggestion. I would like a large flat _ish_ area on the new map for my large land cruisers, and other vehicles than might want to go for a joyride. There isn't enough room right now for any of this stuff on the current map to be done. So please consider this. It could also be a benefit for how the map looks, as it has more variety, and could be a good crash landing spot for planes, and tank pvp arena.

help 2021-04-20 20:13:19 the bullet is moving the same speed as the plane. therefore it has the same proportions as if it was goin 5, if its going mach 4 as the bullets get accelerated the same amount away from the jet even though its already moving. therefore. unless someone screwed somethin up it can't shoot itself down
help 2021-04-20 20:16:35 saying a plane will shoot itself down bc its going too fast is liek saying iof i throw a rock its gunna hit he in the face bc the earth is spinning while moving around the sun which is also orbiting the black hole in out galaxy's center
help 2021-04-20 20:16:59 yes
help 2021-04-20 20:17:02 due to resistance
help 2021-04-20 20:17:03 but
help 2021-04-20 20:17:14 not fast enough to kill the plane it came from lol
help 2021-04-20 20:17:20 only as much as it normally does

help 2021-04-20 20:17:55 yes
help 2021-04-20 20:18:01 but the bullet is affected by gravity
help 2021-04-20 20:18:02 and
help 2021-04-20 20:18:12 it also is moving much faster than the plane
help 2021-04-20 20:18:26 just as fast away from it as if it was sitting on the ground still
help 2021-04-20 20:18:38 just higher up
help 2021-04-20 20:18:41 so if anything
help 2021-04-20 20:18:46 the stats are better for the bullet
help 2021-04-20 20:18:52 bc there is les air pressure
help 2021-04-20 20:18:57 and resistance
help 2021-04-20 20:26:51 the guns being located inside of the walls of the intake, or just under it can be slowed by the intake sucking air in, the plane accelerating in their direction can make it go faster than the bullets, and air resistance all combined can make the plane hit itself with its own bulets
help 2021-04-20 20:26:54 however
help 2021-04-20 20:27:01 going in a level flight

help 2021-04-22 23:09:45 bet you did a lot of reseach and math on that. i actually did the math and found the speed they decelerate. which. is not fast enough to hit the plane before drop. or over time without gravity to do enough damage
help 2021-04-22 23:12:33 depending on how fast the missile is going when you launch it the game will make it go faster by some speed. idk how much faster.

help 2021-04-27 05:22:12 cameras will become invisible on spawn. if you select a camera and click a block while building it will angle the camera to that block. any blocks on this camera will then rotate with the camera in spawn mode. cam welds automaticaly sync with main pilot seat and you can't move them relative to the seat. this involves rotating, pushing etc. if you select a block to a camera on the build mode and then move the build up the cam weld will return to original position from when it was selected in build mode. in order to get proper results just make sure the cameras wre connected to nothing but the blocks u want rotated before u spawn. all cameras are reset when u reload.

help 2021-05-21 23:25:13 cameras will become invisible on spawn. if you select a camera and click a block while building it will angle the camera to that block. any blocks on this camera will then rotate with the camera in spawn mode. cam welds automaticaly sync with main pilot seat and you can't move them relative to the seat. this involves rotating, pushing etc. if you select a block to a camera on the build mode and then move the build up the cam weld will return to original position from when it was selected in build mode. in order to get proper results just make sure the cameras were connected to nothing but the blocks u want rotated before u spawn. all cameras are reset when u reload

**[ PLOTS ]**
`Assuming i hear right, we will be getting 20 player servers. and keeping the plots how they currently are in the game, and just continuing them down in a sing file line will just be inconvenient for all of us. So I was thinking that instead of this, we can do one of two things, or maybe combine them both. #1: simply make a second row and make the baseplate wider. you can extend the baseplate further into the map and just add the second set of plots in front of the other plots, just on the other side (obviously they would be facing inwards). #2: We could arrange the plots in a culdesac arrangement. The plots would just be on a circular baseplate and have the entrance/exit facing towards the middle of the map. #3: Combine them. Basically take the second variation, and give it two openings. like so: ( ) This gives players the a little bit more freedom for roaming the map, and will allow a better central area for all the players to e x i s t in. it will make all the plots slightly more able to reach the ones that are located in what would be less convenient locations and shortens the distance to get from plot 11, to plot 10. Assuming plots are arranged as so: 
1   2   3   4   5   6  7  8  9  10
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
This also makes it easier for planes as they can still take off and land on the baseplate as if it was a runway. #4: you add an opening at the middle front of the baseplate like so:
