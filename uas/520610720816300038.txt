creations-chat 2022-12-09 20:54:04 its like a CSX train, right?
creations-chat 2022-12-09 20:57:28 if its meant to be somewhat like that i would recommend dimming the color of the blues on it, or atleast making it a bit grimy in some areas with darker colors.
creations-chat 2022-12-09 21:29:00 me, who builds trains sometimes:

creations-chat 2022-12-11 22:41:17 ive been buildin up an island recently without motorlock (i try and do as many builds as i can without it to prove people can build good without it), i would send screenshots but im not rank 3 yet.

creations-chat 2022-12-13 14:04:21 thanks, I had been messing with disconnections before making the first island version and I found that out.
creations-chat 2022-12-13 15:23:43 why tf are people mad about me having a positive score? this isnt a competition lol
creations-chat 2022-12-13 15:25:47 why are you even mad in the first place? thing hasn't even been up for a full hour yet it could get a lower score later.
creations-chat 2022-12-13 15:28:20 @.floppa_nature seems to be atleast kinda angry.

also I feel like this community has pretty high standards, i atleast tried my best but all I get told is to "make a better boat"
creations-chat 2022-12-13 15:30:39 honestly pretty true right there
creations-chat 2022-12-13 15:33:28 in a response to this, my pc can run max graphics but its pretty laggy. i might still try tho.
creations-chat 2022-12-13 15:47:38 don't think basilik realizes you cant put ref images in
creations-chat 2022-12-13 16:30:32 people really won't shut up about the boat when thats not even the main attraction of the build. not everything has to be perfect.

creations-chat 2022-12-14 17:52:32 im makin a mini replica of the plane crazy map, what color should i use for grass?
creations-chat 2022-12-14 17:54:55 so which color then

update: got this custom color made, maybe it would work.
creations-chat 2022-12-14 17:56:58 heres the custom color
creations-chat 2022-12-14 18:03:03 startin off by designating areas
creations-chat 2022-12-14 18:06:06 sorry your eyes cant handle it while mine can
creations-chat 2022-12-14 18:11:39 it was one fucking screenshot dude
creations-chat 2022-12-15 16:10:41 ok but

would this project idea actually be good?

-A steam engine freight train that unfolds into an anti-jet train.
creations-chat 2022-12-16 15:32:16 guys what type of train should I make? I was feeling old-style freight load being pulled by a steam engine.
creations-chat 2022-12-16 15:43:15 nah, I already got a thomas and I realisticified him. new word, realisticified
creations-chat 2022-12-16 16:19:54 baller sucks, convince me otherwise.
creations-chat 2022-12-16 16:22:01 <@803292176418078720> only in the chest. what about non-existent Santa? red all over his clothing. fucking middle school kids who think their goth wear more red than baller does.

<@504577008383033344> fake
creations-chat 2022-12-16 16:27:12 my hats brown, dumbass. the image is just deepfried enough to make it look red.
creations-chat 2022-12-16 17:44:00 undo button
creations-chat 2022-12-16 17:46:09 if you had pressed the undo button even the day after im pretty sure it wouldve brought the ship back. not 100% sure but mightve worked
creations-chat 2022-12-16 17:48:58 anyways, i just posted a new build in creations and its gettin downvoted immediately. is there anything i can improve about the build?
it was built back in april so if its really bad thats kinda why
creations-chat 2022-12-16 17:52:08 its not even a coal car, its just

a car.
as for the detail part, i kinda like the low-poly style. not really any point in changing my entire style for one build people dont like.
creations-chat 2022-12-16 17:54:16 think imma change the van up a little bit tho, maybe add sidedoor hinges and some new colors to it so its not as bright.
creations-chat 2022-12-16 18:02:47 what do i put in the truck/car?
creations-chat 2022-12-17 15:08:39 im makin the backrooms
creations-chat 2022-12-17 22:40:25 maybe
the-dump 2022-12-19 15:12:17 
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:10:41 yeah this communities standards are high as hell.
or I guess high as heaven if your christian
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:13:30 you say when I get swarmed with "make a better build" message for having a poly style build.
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:18:02 also, calling it easy when this happens
https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/1054922768707239966
creations-chat 2022-12-21 14:24:33 theres another example of this community having high standards. its a pretty decent build but gets downvote bombed despite them probably following the directions of other users.
creations-chat 2022-12-21 19:58:46 that shit was hours ago and your still going on about it?
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:00:48 no just annoyed his still going on about the standards thing. it started back at 11 its been nearly 4 hours. unnecessary responses to "prove" a point just make it seem like your trying to have the last laugh of it all.

<@627546746792443904> never said it was impossible, dumbass. should maybe fully read messages before replying.
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:02:53 honestly its pretty fair that one was downvoted tho, thing was made in april, didnt expect it to do well anyways. i only posted it because i had no idea of what to post. i dont build things just to show off.
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:07:04 all i said was a single swear directed at someone which you allowed me to do earlier, bot. jeez.

as i was trying to say, why are we even still going with this? people have different interpretations of good, but the point im trying to prove is that most people who even scroll through the chat to upvote or downvote builds usually downvote builds that are, in your words, "worse than average" when the builds themselves are still good enough to pass off enough to get atleast the first level of a rank.
creations-chat 2022-12-21 20:09:50 i will agree with the charger aswell, i was kinda seeing the proportions myself since im not the biggest builder of cars for that scale

as for the island i think the only reason it got upvotes in the first place is from the grass.

creations-chat 2023-01-13 01:51:35 thats actually not motorlocked
creations-chat 2023-01-13 01:54:02 this is literally one of the three walls you mean, right? just half blocks and a smoke pipe behind a ladder, its so simple and not fucking motorlock
creations-chat 2023-01-13 01:56:27 thats legit just 16 wedges placed together
creations-chat 2023-01-13 01:59:46 oh and by the way heres your evidence is just wedges. dont see how you guys thought that was motorlock.
creations-chat 2023-01-13 02:08:46 maybe darken it in some places for shading reasons
creations-chat 2023-01-13 02:12:00 like for the paint? try dark colors, or like ciclano said, add some detail to more parts. whether it just be exhaust pipes or somethin.

also <@577930642520801301> where i would recommend for changing is in small parts, like the connections between the ring and middle or the tip of the middle.

creations-chat 2023-01-20 15:37:34 I wouldn't recommend letting that slide. with the upvotes its getting, he can redeem it for a rank. you won't get it because you didn't post it.

I will ask one thing tho, would you be fine with me building a train museum based off your BR 80? got pretty inspired and it would be a nice way to show off my build skills.
creations-chat 2023-01-20 15:44:24 doesn't fix it fully, as your profiting off his build. you can literally redeem it for designer 3 rn and he won't get it because he didn't post it
creations-chat 2023-01-20 15:47:00 just delete it before a mod gets here and warns you
creations-chat 2023-01-20 15:57:42 btw, chimla, would yiu be fine with me building a train museum based off your BR 80? I'm not talking about copying it, instead building trains in the style and displaying them. would you be fine with me doing that?
creations-chat 2023-01-20 16:16:22 first off make it actually a Ferrari if your calling it that
second off, since your going for a stock racecar, try making the backwing thing a bit more sleek
creations-chat 2023-01-20 16:19:32 I meant the parts holding it up, change the signs you appear to be using to deltawing panels.
creations-chat 2023-01-20 16:23:40 was stolen, simply took the screenshots for chimla and sent them himself
creations-chat 2023-01-23 14:48:22 try some blocks from wedge2
creations-chat 2023-01-29 00:12:04 learning to motorlock just for a train.
creations-chat 2023-01-29 00:16:07 jesus how do you guys do this for builds regularly
creations-chat 2023-01-29 00:18:17 no issues, surprisingly. i just find it decently difficult to figure it all out. and how im gonna fit it in the whole space, like jesus the entire boiler and smokebox will be locked.
creations-chat 2023-01-29 00:20:19 GNR N2, specifically the one in preservation at the North Norfolk Railway. engine 1744. 0-6-2 for wheel config. really annoying to get made but it'll be worth it.
creations-chat 2023-01-29 00:23:51 thats kinda an issue to do with the train system im using.
creations-chat 2023-01-29 00:26:01 honestly, thats what im doing. the only issue is getting the funnel placed.
creations-chat 2023-01-29 00:33:01 hows this lookin so far?
creations-chat 2023-01-29 01:54:44 so heres the train so far, pretty far from finished. let me know what i can do to improve for when i finish. very much a beginner at motorlock, i was only using what i know.
creations-chat 2023-01-29 03:16:44 i wasnt gonna have it do that
this system is to make it rock back and forth when being hit
creations-chat 2023-01-29 05:15:47 tf do you mean motorlock the wheels? im a beginner at this shit i dont know what you mean
creations-chat 2023-01-29 05:21:13 im a **beginner** i cant do this
just because i did it with a boiler doesnt mean i can do literally anything
creations-chat 2023-01-29 05:23:18 i get that but you gotta understand, not everyone can do everything right off the bat.
creations-chat 2023-01-29 06:21:21 i made a passenger car for my train but when pulling it with the bogey down it just stops moving, but when its up it works fine. is there any way to fix that>
creations-chat 2023-01-30 02:13:14 update to the train, coach 1 is done
creations-chat 2023-01-30 02:15:18 have you been inside a coach before? there are no seatbelts
creations-chat 2023-01-30 02:17:21 game regulations do not require me to, therefor i shall not. welcome to plane crazy, where the only death is you resetting or falling off the edge from your stupidity.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 02:21:59 https://tenor.com/view/lizard-dancing-lizard-cry-about-it-gecko-dance-gif-20175430
creations-chat 2023-01-30 02:24:15 game regulations do not require me to. also its smooth enough to where they arent needed.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 02:26:48 but your regulations are not inflicted unless your in the server.
and i rarely use the vip's.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 02:28:58 correct. as its not your territory, therefor your regulations cannot be inflicted.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 14:03:11 <@639374429532717056> they weren't originally, there was a conversation going on.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 14:05:23 theres like 3 things wrong
1: Pain was using gifs and videos to bypass it, so that he could speak in a conversation.
2: You didn't see it, so your defending the one in the wrong.
3: Its probably breaking some form of rule.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 14:07:36 no wonder your still a whitename, fjcking dumbass. maybe you should read up a bit on stuff some more.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 14:09:55 its literally so simple to get a rank.
build something pretty good
pray the upvotes outweigh the downvotes
get a rank ticket
and jsut wait
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:08:00 or dont make planes in general. make like 1 or 2 and you'll be fine.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:12:00 reject planes, return to train.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:16:31 learn to good train
that's actually what I'm doing in-game, I've been learning motorlock and using trains as a way to test, aswell as learn to make better trains
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:26:17 building a plane for the 1872th time will never have the same experience as building another train. every train class is different in some way, whether it be wheel configuration or boiler size. while every plane is disputing over which one isn't a copycat of another with minimal changes.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:28:51 me.
I dont like it.
because war trains exist aswell.
also if you enjoy doing the same thing over and over with only small changes, your insanity has gone too far.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:31:32 every single plane is similar to another in some way, I get that a passenger plane isn't similar to a biplane but a passenger plane from America is similar to a passenger plane from Japan.
I get trains can be like that aswell and thats why I build everything except vehicles sometimes.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:33:37 it was originally about all types of planes till it had to be military jets because of total creativity.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:36:07 planes have their supremacists too, its why they flood creations chat to the point where we get chains of them in a row.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 16:39:26 you see theres a thing called gauges
another called trains that run on the plots
creations-chat 2023-01-30 19:07:25 hey so im boutta make the second coach to my motorlock train, anything i should change about this one before doing so?
creations-chat 2023-01-30 19:10:05 so your calling it terrible, sorry for asking for advice on something my guy. not like this is my ***first time doing one of these extreme motorlock builds***
creations-chat 2023-01-30 19:12:34 and you dont need to give me shit for trying to atleast learn. would you rather me try and improve or just do nothing? i was asking for advice, not god damn "everything" as an answer with nothing else.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 19:14:48 people to try and help when they want quality builds
creations-chat 2023-01-30 19:22:43 something i may change on the coach though is the paintjob, changing the browns to reds. would that look good?
creations-chat 2023-01-30 19:24:57 please remove yourself from existance via 518 chicken nuggets, you dont have the right to speak anymore due to all this.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 20:13:29 issue with the text and door is that im using half blocks so it'll still look like shit.
also i dont fully know how to do detailed windows yet.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 20:15:38 literally said it was a learnin experience during that, mate. if it was learning then its probably not gonna be that good.
creations-chat 2023-01-30 21:21:13 whenever i use emojis they get tagged. also, i dont really like using materials unless their strictly required. taking ice and fabric as an example.
and i get that i dont need motorlock, im using the train as a learning experience. its not something im gonna post in creations and pass it off as good, because its not.
creations-chat 2023-02-07 15:00:36 please shut
creations-chat 2023-02-07 15:06:29 yeah but he fuckin sucks at talking. his speech is like a speech bubble image. they suck but they still try.
