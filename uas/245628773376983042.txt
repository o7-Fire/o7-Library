plane-crazy 2019-09-03 09:42:15 Going for the crazy engineer achievement
plane-crazy 2019-09-03 09:40:24 I'm getting a bug where there's an invisible part that I can't delete, any solutions?
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 18:00:40 If you look in creations you will never wonder why my parents wanted me adopted
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:47:01 Only four things I've built out of the full save slots I have actually work consistently lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:46:26 :/
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:44:58 Not even after touching anything just completely randomly
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:44:43 My motors randomly go out of sync
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:44:38 :/
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:44:37 And now I have another issue
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:33:58 Motors and pistons are still pretty broke
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:32:26 When you want to be big brain but you know you'll never be big brain XD
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:30:12 I made a bomber feeding mechanism, has that been made before?
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:29:56 I expected so
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:29:54 O so it has been done before
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:28:16 :)
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:28:00 On the bright side, I've just finished building a working railgun
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:27:37 Things that fly in non-pvp don't fly in pvp
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:27:30 That too
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:26:53 It's a bit annoyin'
plane-crazy 2019-08-21 17:26:26 I'm experiencing delays when I press play and sometimes my physics don't kick in, so overall my vehicle won't work, are you guys experiencing this as well>?
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 20:02:59 Probably shouldn't say that aloud
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 20:02:54 Hmmmmmmmmm
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 19:58:48 *me waiting for an update where you can drag with the delete thing so you don't have to click each thing manually*

plane-crazy 2019-08-19 19:53:00 Was a photo mode really worth a shutdown?
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 19:52:54 Pft
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 19:52:34 Pinterest*
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 19:52:08 Roblox when they copy the patreon logo
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 19:51:43 REEEEEEEEEEEE
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 19:51:20 I established it was an update
plane-crazy 2019-08-19 19:51:01 so what's the shutdown?
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 19:15:43 Yeet
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 12:21:05 Cheers mate
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 12:21:02 Ah
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 12:20:07 Not carrier
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 12:20:03 But of course it keeps attaching to the actual frame of the carrier
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 12:19:43 I want to make a sliding door
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 12:19:40 Is there any way to prevent two blocks from colliding
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 10:48:28 I never got winter wheels or snow blaster
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 10:47:43 Which makes them near useless for the most part
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 10:47:13 The ski stuff
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 10:46:57 Has anyone actually found a means to put them to use?
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 10:46:51 :/
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 10:45:47 If the winter gear was actually any use :/
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 08:53:18 Can't really explain it easily
plane-crazy 2019-06-18 08:53:05 Y'all is there any form of full block that does not connect with other blocks (e.g. so that I can make a sliding cockpit roof which is airtight.)
