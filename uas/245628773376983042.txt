The Tale of Eclipsis (245628773376983042)
help 2019-01-06 19:25:56 Is there a way to create a tracked vehicle system in the game? (Ping me afterwards)
help 2019-01-09 18:50:53 Dumb question, but how do you unanchor something, I'm trying to  use a slide for a piston but it keeps anchoring to my main vehicle.
help 2019-01-09 18:52:56 What I mean is that my piston tries to push the whole vehicle
help 2019-01-09 18:52:58 ANd of course
help 2019-01-09 18:53:00 That doesn't work
help 2019-01-09 18:53:07 So how would I make a tight slide
creations-chat 2019-01-10 19:46:14 <@!256501003493441547> you should add explosives inside of it so when it falls over you can make it blow up lol

creations-chat 2019-01-11 18:11:47 I call it the meme mobile, it was made to try and reach a certain amount of SPS, I think it worked (although it is somewhat cheating)
help 2019-01-12 13:31:32 Would this count as a VTOL, its wings and engines can tilt upwards allowing for vertical takeoff
help 2019-01-12 13:33:14 It's a very strange VTOL
help 2019-01-12 13:33:16 Somehow it flies

creations-chat 2019-08-21 18:03:10 Better than the battle bus amirite
creations-chat 2019-12-04 18:53:52 Elysian Dawn- Combat variant, can carry 6 people and armed with concealed rockets and guns underneath, not many fancy features except pistons are used to open the door (which also happens to be the engines)
creations-chat 2019-12-04 18:56:25 Only 300 blocks, turns amazingly though
creations-chat 2019-12-04 19:00:46 Shrike, pretty common design on plane crazy but good for flying with.
