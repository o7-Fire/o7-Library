creations-chat 2021-12-31 18:51:38 im working on a vf31 from macross (no legs though) and would like some feedback before i put in the canards, tails, and foot booster things. the exposed motorlock on top is supposed to be green and is kind of there on purpose to emulate some of the weird light shit
