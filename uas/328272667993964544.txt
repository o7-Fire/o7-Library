creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:31:58 Them invading poland and france was just
creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:34:07 The British killed more German civilians then the German killed British civilians in the bombing raids
creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:36:40 The Russians used Russian civilians as human shields.
creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:37:12 It is search it up
creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:37:13 also
creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:38:41 They forced the civilians to stay in Leningrad even though they knew the Germans would take it over anyways, why? because they thought having millions of innocent lives would make the solders fight harder.
creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:39:15 Hundreds of thousands of civilians starved to death even though they could have evacuated.
creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:40:21 hmm
creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:41:28 Neverminded not hundreds of thousands over a million innocent civilians died in the siege of Leningrad.
creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:41:58 Ok fine but your the one that said "take that Germany" first so.
creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:43:29 I'm just kind of pissed that people just say oh Germany was horrible and bla bla bla when the allied powers did a lot of the same stuff the Germans did.
creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:44:53 The USA took all the Japanese in the west coast and put them into labor camps.
creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:45:03 Never heard that before have you.

creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:46:07 They were in horrible conditions though and they were shot if they tired to run.
creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:46:24 They barily got food.
creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:47:06 Well most Germans didn't know that was even happening.
creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:47:34 How about we all agree that the Germans did nothing more wrong then the Allies.
creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:48:53 The Battleship Bismarck was sinking and it is a law of war to pick up the crew but do you know what the British did. They kept shooting it so much the water boiled form the shots hitting it.
creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:49:18 Only 6 out of the more then 2000 died.
creations-chat 2019-12-13 04:49:28 only 6 survived*
