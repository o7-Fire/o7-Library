bug-reports 2020-02-01 11:41:11 so uhh theres a bug where people can put things on my plot that i can't remove by blacklist or anything
bug-reports 2020-02-01 13:29:55 its just that people can put really inappropriate stuff on your plot - and i cant blacklist who did it because they left but their inappropriate creation is still there so i could get ban for something thats not my fault nor can i delete
