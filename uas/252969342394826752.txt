The Tale of jarred4257 (252969342394826752)
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:38:01 this is a space shuttle/space fighter i built, unfortunately it won't fly correctly, any ideas?
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:38:14 
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:43:14 whenever i try to fly it it will sometimes get in the air and glide for a bit then crash, it doesn't get airborne, somebody told me it was the engines but it has plenty of thrust
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:43:36 yeah the nose pushes downward
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:43:46 you want you can get on my server and see it
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:44:06 i tried adding a couple super rockets toward the front but it didn't really help
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:44:35 they are very close to each other
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:45:35 blue is slightly aft of the center mass
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:46:33 so what should i still move the tail rudders back a bit?
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:47:00 cause steering is also difficult
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:49:51 so by make the wings wider you mean longer?
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:50:05 or actually wider
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:50:21 i was referring to my creation
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:50:38 look in creations
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:50:47 scroll up a bit
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:52:59 got it
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:59:25 still falling forward
creations-chat 2019-05-04 15:59:50 the lift and center mass are the same
creations-chat 2019-05-04 16:00:32 
creations-chat 2019-05-04 16:04:38 not sure what could be causing it, i am thinking it's too heavy in the front
creations-chat 2019-05-04 16:07:39 do you need to see what happens when it tries to fly?
creations-chat 2019-05-04 16:10:35 maybe try wing mounted engines?
creations-chat 2019-05-04 16:11:00 like make the wings out of half blocks
creations-chat 2019-05-04 16:17:10 i was honestly thinking of making it a little more circular and aerodynamic
creations-chat 2019-05-04 16:21:40 sir...
creations-chat 2019-05-04 16:21:51 i think you just helped me out
creations-chat 2019-05-04 16:22:02 nice creation btw
creations-chat 2019-05-04 16:22:16 i can't believe i didn't think of making it VT
