bot-central 2020-10-26 19:00:30 ?shelp add some kind of disconnector function where you click blocks next to each other and once both blocks are selected, it highlights them in like, blue or something, and you can edit it with the screwdriver like you can with disconnectors, and it asks you what key to disconnect it. This would be really useful for things like Rockets, because disconnectors take up so much space and can make a rocket look bad, or its just a hassle to get everything to look flush at the area of stage separation. I hope this idea gets through to the developers..

Thanks
