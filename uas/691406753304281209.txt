bot-central 2021-02-03 23:27:14 &suggest Motor 3 (Allows for degree control and locking)
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:28:18 &suggest Rope be a different object than normal ones. Since it is a constraint, this'll be easy to do, but make it where we can attach objects together further than 2 blocks away
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:29:10 &suggest make lights able to be turned on or off before launching
bot-central 2021-02-03 23:29:53 bruh
