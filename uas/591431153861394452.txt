[TITLE] - Ability to move individual objects instead of only moving the entire build
[CATEGORY] - Building

[DESCRIPTION] - It would be good to have an option to move objects such as blocks and other parts individually, or in groups, instead of only being able to move the entire build. This would make it easier to correct mistakes, and is quicker than deleting a bunch of blocks and replacing them.

[LINKS TO REFERENCE IMAGES/VIDEOS (optional)] - None
