bug-reports 2021-08-21 08:15:15 The cutters on my mech save file refuse to work, even if i make a different creation on it it still doesnt cut, on other saves yes but i cannot rebuild a 2k block mech and remember.
bug-reports 2022-08-03 10:03:15 so i have a weird mech double edged sword thing i made just today, because there has been previous versions of this, and, one day the cutters just broke entirely, i took a break for a few months hoping a update would come along and fix it. i get on today and its STILL bugged, i tried multiple things, different saves, different cutter tests, different designs, just like last time and it doesnt work. i also dont want to have to recreate a mech on a alt account just to use it. i have no idea how to fix it or what to do, i can get a recording if requested
