creations-chat 2020-10-30 15:50:54 > I don't care if a build is trash, I judge the build and see if they actually put some effort into it. If they did I'll upvote if not I will stay neutral. The only time I will downvote is when its actually like the worst build I have ever seen in a millennia.
<@!688199362207416485> i downvote builds that arent from mind and are from real life rarely
creations-chat 2020-10-30 15:53:37 > Lmao if he said he downvotes irl builds then he must be downvoting everything cuz almost all people here build tanks, Bombers, Jets etc which are from real life
