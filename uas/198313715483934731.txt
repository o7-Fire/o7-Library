help 2022-05-24 15:05:48 pistons are wonky and inconsistent so the rockets come out differently sometimes
ive replacced as many blocks as i could with 0.9s but no difference
any tips?
help 2022-05-24 15:06:39 o i should mention actually the rockets are stacked with motor locking but i dont think that should change it much
help 2022-05-24 15:07:31 the side of the thigh has a compartment that pops out
help 2022-05-24 15:07:35 so the rockets pop out
help 2022-05-24 15:07:42 and its on a piston
help 2022-05-24 15:07:54 but i think cus it rubs against everything it gets stuck
help 2022-05-24 15:13:14 basically its just pistons being inconsistent and i wanna see if yall know of any ways to get around that
