help 2021-09-05 01:42:59 They’re really not good for anything else besides making the headlights wink
help 2021-09-05 01:43:04 The car is just so ass

help 2021-09-05 01:44:37 Or where it’s from

help 2021-09-05 01:47:22 What a noob lol
help 2021-09-05 01:51:13 I have this as my pfp because I got banned from a server
help 2021-09-05 01:51:23 I don’t see the issue with it lol
help 2021-09-05 01:52:24 I don’t have a Japanese shitbox or a cat as my pfp so I think I have room to talk about pops

help 2021-09-05 01:52:35 Pfps*
help 2021-09-05 01:53:09 Because I just joined this server today
help 2021-09-05 01:53:24 I rarely join servers for games
help 2021-09-05 01:53:41 I only joined so I could see the builds in hall of fame
help 2021-09-05 01:54:11 Yea imagine
help 2021-09-05 01:55:19 The whole point of me even being in this server is because one of my friends told me to try and get my A-10 into the hall of fame so I just said why not
help 2021-09-05 01:56:36 And the reason me and shitbox pfp started arguing is because
help 2021-09-05 01:56:51 I asked why I could post images and files here but not <#384025409945337856>
help 2021-09-05 01:57:02 And I sent a pic of my A-10 here
help 2021-09-05 01:57:29 And they said “if youre trying to get that into creations, you shouldn’t even bother”
help 2021-09-05 01:57:34 Or something along those lines
help 2021-09-05 01:58:02 So they were pretty much toxic for no reason
help 2021-09-05 01:58:13 So I started being toxic too
help 2021-09-05 01:59:05 I’m just saying because y’all are attacking me for no reason
