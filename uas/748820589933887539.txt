bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:22:21 My saves are weird
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:22:36 the autosave shows that i had saved 3.2k build,
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:22:55 but it shows the another build i have which is 888blocks when i load it.
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:22:58 And also,
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:23:12 the 3.2k build i had is now very broken for somereason,
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:23:16 with a lot of missing blocks
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:23:50 and just by changing the material, the uncolored ladder is now suddenly white
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:24:05 even though i never painted white on it.
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:24:15 due to the missing blocks,
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:24:54 i need to fix all the parts of the 3.2k build that's broken, which is really hard to do, in order to make it functional again
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:25:17 oh in addition,
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:25:35 some of the blocks that weren't there are placed randomly too
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:25:54 and block counts are same as the original one that was functional, on the same save plot...
bug-reports 2020-12-01 01:34:56 Please fix this
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:28:27 well
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:28:30 for the color,
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:28:40 the ladder default is grey
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:29:34 and except the ladder, color on any other parts than normal blocks or normal beams were the same
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:29:45 such as motors and ballast
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:30:06 and yes, the problem occurs when i change from
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:30:11 /to glass material too
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:39:08 but what i meant was
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:39:13 the color of ladder changes
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:39:20 to white instead of default
bug-reports 2020-12-01 02:39:31 when i changed from glass to defauly
bug-reports 2020-12-01 03:32:12 well i guess so
bug-reports 2020-12-01 03:32:20 tbh, i don't really care about the color,
bug-reports 2020-12-01 03:32:35 but the other problem i described above
bug-reports 2020-12-01 03:32:48 From here
bug-reports 2020-12-01 05:32:23 ?-?

bug-reports 2021-02-25 04:36:12 please increase the power of flip
bug-reports 2021-02-25 04:36:27 flip doesn't work well on my build
bug-reports 2021-02-25 04:36:47 i need to press 50 times or more to make it look forward
bug-reports 2021-02-25 06:36:02 wdyamean?
bug-reports 2021-02-25 10:51:08 it's over 7k blocks build
bug-reports 2021-02-26 13:00:40 i guess
bug-reports 2021-02-27 15:22:42 hope the thruster permanently being on after getting damaged get fixed soon
creations-chat 2021-04-10 12:17:19 oh i am sorry. he said he can't post it, so he just asked me to post it for him
sorry for the inconvenience

if i am not wrong, he is banned i think

he also said i can take all the credits, but i didn't want to take his.
creations-chat 2021-12-06 05:58:11 it's so hard to make that curve
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:02:19 this is older pic so it has some exposed motors
help 2021-12-06 06:04:10 is it possible to make the nose more smooth than that
help 2021-12-06 06:04:28 yeah
help 2021-12-06 06:04:43 i was also working on something similar but it was quite tiring to make it more curved
help 2021-12-06 06:05:02 i see
help 2021-12-06 06:06:53 hm i guess it would take far more space if ya were to make it more curved then
help 2021-12-06 06:06:58 nice
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:09:58 how about angling the prop from inside oneblock at the end of the axle or how should i call it
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:12:02 hm? i am confused
help 2021-12-06 06:13:44 what should i do if the head attached to the body by motor 2 keeps disintegrating, causing the mech to suddenly fly with 1.6 bil speed, and at some point everything disappears and yet i don't die with constant speed
help 2021-12-06 06:13:46 fun
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:14:06 oh i see
well after trial and error, he/she will get it eventually ig
help 2021-12-06 06:15:30 i see
help 2021-12-06 06:15:35 hope it won't lag too much
help 2021-12-06 06:17:43 yeap
help 2021-12-06 06:18:23 this is what i got so far ig
help 2021-12-06 06:18:29 gotta redo the whole bottom part of the nose
help 2021-12-06 06:19:44 has the working landing gear, so hard to get space for now
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:22:23 hm how about first angling and changing the shape of the front wing, change the shape of the wing a bit by adjusting through motor lock by texts, make the canopy and nose smoother, remove mouse controlled wing panels by instead using another mechanism, and etc
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:24:31 yeap i do

btw can anyone help me in what i wrote at help text channel regarding the mech's head
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:27:22 try watching one of the vid of jj or was it diamond's regarding the jet engine part, and try learning about motorlocks ig. by doing so ya will figure out a lot of ways to improve
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:29:24 shutdown does seem to happen often nowadays, but as long as ya save it often, it will be fine
it takes risks to learn new things afterall
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:31:33 well there is two ways to learn, which is either learn through tutorial or experiment yourself ig
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:33:46 idk than ya can try experimenting yourself ya just don't need to make it based on tutorial, but just learn some facts from it to improve
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:36:36 looks great, but what ya can try challenge is adding steering system and making wheels motorized ig
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:38:56 i guess that's decent, but ya should probably angle the turret, remove all exposed motors, and make sure the rockets aren't exposed ig
the body can be made so it's more curved too by motor locking more
also can try adding tracks if ya have time
creations-chat 2021-12-06 06:42:09 try checking out how to do angle lock first then ig
then ya will figure out how to put all of those in more confined space
keep in mind that texts can't collide with blocks
creations-chat 2021-12-06 07:26:36 if so, how about locking horizontally rather than vertically
and other parts, lock it with text signs or disconnector to cover it up more ig

events-chat 2022-05-01 08:03:12 okay
events-chat 2022-05-01 08:08:00 hello everyone
events-chat 2022-05-01 08:08:38 i am new to these types of event, and i hope we have a great time together
events-chat 2022-05-01 08:11:44 hello fellow computer head
events-chat 2022-05-01 08:12:20 being overly wholesome in social life = morally corrupt inside
events-chat 2022-05-01 08:15:11 btw is there a specific private server for this event
events-chat 2022-05-01 08:16:37 i see
events-chat 2022-05-01 08:17:03 i was wondering since i saw some people together in images of submissions channel
events-chat 2022-05-01 09:01:05 also does the build need to fit in 51x51x36 even after some parts move? or just before anything rotates?
events-chat 2022-05-01 10:56:39 if just in build mode,
events-chat 2022-05-01 10:56:55 it can be a lot larger than that size after spawning?
events-chat 2022-05-01 11:18:42 but if that's the case, i am worried there might be build that reach like 150 blocks width
events-chat 2022-05-01 11:19:10 since some might mototlock it to extend their size
events-chat 2022-05-01 11:27:07 sorry for bothering you again, but i have another question
events-chat 2022-05-01 11:27:32 is it okay to add another feature on a mech other than original features the battlebot i have been chosen to possesses?
events-chat 2022-05-01 13:05:02 i see
events-chat 2022-05-01 13:05:20 thx for the help
events-chat 2022-05-01 13:05:41 man this is pain
events-chat 2022-05-01 13:05:58 i already used like 150 motors for one wheel and it's unfinished
events-chat 2022-05-01 14:44:07 ah wheel is pain
events-chat 2022-05-01 15:08:13 yes
events-chat 2022-05-01 15:08:42 that's why i thought of another idea
events-chat 2022-05-01 15:08:58 in addition to this
events-chat 2022-05-01 15:11:53 i may not look like it,
events-chat 2022-05-01 15:12:10 but i have fought a lot with cutters in ps pvp
events-chat 2022-05-02 07:47:29 
events-chat 2022-05-02 08:02:20 i think i might use all motors
events-chat 2022-05-02 08:06:41 yes
events-chat 2022-05-02 08:19:44 can i apply custom suspension system if mine is flipper
events-chat 2022-05-03 15:42:33 <@466793357318815744> i am sorry for pinging, but mine goes over size before spawning by 15 or so.
it fits within size limit once spawned, so is this fine or do i need to decrease size
events-chat 2022-05-03 15:44:58 okay thank you for your help
