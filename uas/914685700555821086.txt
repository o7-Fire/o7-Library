events-chat 2022-01-09 03:33:39 People are able to make these stupidly accurate jets but aren't able to make a simple mech.
*so mech battles are in 3rd-4th for it being in line :(*
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:34:45 but fun if you're piloting one
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:35:04 its more fun
if you have more arsenal
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:36:08 ok its probably why im excited for mech fight
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:36:28 at the time mech fight event goes on thisll be done

events-chat 2022-01-09 03:36:50 fr doe
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:37:07 wonder if i can just sit in the corner as a bystander

events-chat 2022-01-09 03:37:43 like my mecha does but pretend its 4 legged
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:38:06 front would obv be different joints so hence different mechanism
I'd make it climb by putting rockets on the front of the hooves
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:38:26 how big we talkin
small or entire plot needs to fold
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:39:31 that's easy
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:41:41 yeah i could replicate that easily

help 2022-03-14 19:51:22 Anyone know how to fix the issue with the toe going down even though i put restraints to *not* make it go down?
