the-dump 2023-06-18 20:03:43 i love being advertised to when flying a plane
the-dump 2023-06-18 20:04:36 i do just no energy
creations-chat 2023-06-18 22:43:51 How do y’all create such compact stuff without motorlocking
creations-chat 2023-06-18 22:49:53 Oh I thought it wasn’t spawned, can you show unspawned? I wanna see how much I’ll need to create a tank
creations-chat 2023-06-18 22:54:09 Oh wow, that’s more than I’ve ever used
creations-chat 2023-06-18 23:00:55 Yeah I don’t use it much, I’ve only used it for my 1-1 replicas and then it’s like 2 or 3 towers like my bf-109 and me-163
creations-chat 2023-06-18 23:04:12 Should I post my me-163 and bf-109 tomorrow? They’re nothing special but they’re very scale accurate so idk if it’s low effort or not
creations-chat 2023-06-18 23:06:34 Ok, give me like 20 min
creations-chat 2023-06-18 23:12:37 It looks pretty bad on mobile
creations-chat 2023-06-18 23:14:42 IT LOOKS ACTUALLY GOOD ON PC TRUST ME, it doesn’t look so chonky there, the colours on my bf109 are messed up and I found a way to improve it
creations-chat 2023-06-18 23:16:47 THE BF109 LOOKS MORE CORRECT, the main speak of the me-163 is just that it’s actually made for pvp
creations-chat 2023-06-18 23:18:51 I fucked up the size, it looks too chonky :(
creations-chat 2023-06-18 23:21:13 Yes, irl it was 2 meters tall, it’s very hard to make something like almost as tall as a Roblox character have different colours and shape
creations-chat 2023-06-18 23:47:23 Yes it’s what they used to lose the war
creations-chat 2023-06-19 09:53:23 somehow these wheels work really well, i have no clue how to use them tho. they somehow stick to the ground no matter your weight
creations-chat 2023-06-19 09:57:19 yeah but fabric sometimes goes TOO fast if u weigh like nothing
creations-chat 2023-06-23 11:25:14 like real city?
creations-chat 2023-06-23 11:37:34 i mean oslo is cool, im biased tho im norwegian
creations-chat 2023-06-23 11:41:08 oslo isnt huge either, its a pretty small city compared to others, theres a giant train station tho that may be fun to make
creations-chat 2023-06-23 12:52:18 flåklyppa grand prix better
creations-chat 2023-06-23 18:42:24 whos that
creations-chat 2023-06-23 18:44:26 oh, well hes swedish, flåklyppa is norwegian so it cant be! he'd be a traitor!!!
creations-chat 2023-06-23 19:20:13 NORWAY RAHHHHHHH
creations-chat 2023-06-23 19:26:55 i aint readin allat
creations-chat 2023-06-23 19:33:16 this seems like is what you wanted to make
creations-chat 2023-06-23 19:35:40 these two also work, probably a ton more ways to make a small turn thing tho
creations-chat 2023-06-23 19:38:23 hes dumb, norway crippled the german navy stopped them from making a nuke and germany lost
creations-chat 2023-06-23 23:07:15 Make it rounder
creations-chat 2023-06-24 10:46:17 whats the problem? i dont make planes but i may be able to help
creations-chat 2023-06-24 15:26:20 Meanie
creations-chat 2023-06-24 15:29:23 He needs to drill in that tv
creations-chat 2023-06-24 15:37:05 That’s pretty cool tho
creations-chat 2023-06-24 15:49:33 Teach me your ways
creations-chat 2023-06-24 15:51:35 i make shitty cars but they work pretty well
creations-chat 2023-06-24 16:13:48 imo that depends on if you are building the mechanics or a car, like just a chasis can look garbage but if its a full car its gotta look good
