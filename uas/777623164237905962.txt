bug-reports 2021-12-14 19:51:53 I've seen that before
bug-reports 2021-12-14 19:52:02 I got it for the 2019 summer event in 2021
bug-reports 2021-12-14 23:04:49 Same
creations-chat 2021-12-15 19:49:54 That ain't a bug
creations-chat 2021-12-16 22:18:44 Pov: your stuck in the back of a train after getting kidnapped when your car broke down in Michigan
creations-chat 2021-12-17 01:34:01 Could have been a bit nicer about that man
creations-chat 2021-12-17 02:59:18 Bc pcc is based
creations-chat 2021-12-17 03:01:22 And the only ppl who get
 good <:Upvote:490311647492309004> are famous youtubers or extreme motor locked builds and or angle locked-and the occasional monster truck
creations-chat 2021-12-17 03:04:31 Not every non-motor locker is trash at the game you know right?
creations-chat 2021-12-17 03:07:35 Then they aren't non-motor lockers
If they started using it<:thoink:657279634563399720>
<@378612526151237642> I have no idea what this guy means as non-motorlocker
creations-chat 2021-12-17 03:09:49 Exactly my point <@723940197456281640>
<@660019099430289418> that's what I mean, but this guy doesn't get that
creations-chat 2021-12-17 03:12:46 Anyway, we both made valid points and both are valid
I go to the depths of eternal Brazil and sleep
creations-chat 2021-12-17 03:14:48 But can you build a mech that's reaches 200 height? And fully functions,walks,can jump,fly,move arms in the same way as a humans can?
creations-chat 2021-12-17 03:25:37 Explain then?
creations-chat 2021-12-17 03:27:38 That is correct, it does not have the functionality of human mussel tissue
Also <@540515443132334090> I wasn't asking for responses
Anyway I sleep
creations-chat 2021-12-17 03:30:16 You Also didn't see it from full scale
<@723940197456281640> thank you

help 2023-01-08 06:31:36 Uh oh 💀
help 2023-01-08 16:33:56 Lower the speed of the motor that turns the prop right (if you have 2 props)
help 2023-01-10 12:07:39 Which one rotates to the right?
help 2023-01-10 12:09:49 Which prop, there's 2
help 2023-01-10 12:11:04 So the front prop spins to the right
help 2023-01-10 12:11:25 Well, it seems you have both props spinning the same way
help 2023-01-10 12:11:53 It's better to have 1 spinning the other way to counter-act the rotational forces
help 2023-01-10 12:12:16 Thats usually what the tail rotor does but if you have 2 props thats fine
bug-reports 2023-01-10 12:37:08 Set the max angle to 179.99 instead of 180
bug-reports 2023-01-10 12:37:27 I've had this happen
help 2023-02-14 15:03:57 Don't think so
creations-chat 2023-03-03 03:36:31 How exactly do you balance it when warping? My ship always spins out of controll when warping.
creations-chat 2023-03-03 20:46:41 Bro 💀
creations-chat 2023-03-13 15:57:18 <:empty:794431705070174238>
help 2023-03-14 16:10:07 Is it anchored?
help 2023-03-16 02:48:02 Either your too tailheavy or have too much lift in the front
help 2023-03-16 02:48:54 Place the stack one block down, the stack will lock in the position of the lower motor, so if it's one below than it is now. It will lock fully.
help 2023-03-16 03:03:18 It could but that might cause further problems, I would get rid of lift in the front instead
help 2023-03-16 03:03:54 Np
creations-chat 2023-03-16 03:26:38 <:Thonk:509498568982134816> the angles 💀
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:29:21 I have no clue, never has happened to me.
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:32:00 Plane crazy has been on a downhill for so long now, missing both the summer and winter events. Lieing about the pc2 release day AMD leak dates. I don't blame rickje for it, because he is busy. But why not hire some ppl to work of plane crazy 1, so he can focus on pc2. I'm sure there's gotta be some ppl in this community that would totally work on their favorite game for free
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:33:28 Shit you know binsty?
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:33:41 I've known him for a while
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:34:44 He kept his YT hidden from me bc he didn't want me to hear his voice 💀
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:34:54 I found out eventually
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:35:33 Aw hell naw
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:35:48 The cheese graters 💀💀
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:36:14 I mean if your going to use cheese grater, atleast motor lock some wing pannels ontop of them to make it look better
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:40:48 Yeah binstys chill. Been a good friend
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:42:26 Indeed
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:42:39 I use only the tail fins for lift and steering now
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:42:55 Works really well, it turns fast and is very sensitive to movement
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:42:58 Great for pvp
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:43:04 Pretty fast too
help 2023-03-16 03:48:34 Are you using a hover drive?
help 2023-03-16 03:48:57 Are you using pistons or motor?
help 2023-03-16 03:49:06 .
help 2023-03-16 03:49:11 I see
help 2023-03-16 03:49:13 Well
help 2023-03-16 03:49:17 I've had that problem
help 2023-03-16 03:49:25 It happens when you lock a block into a piston
help 2023-03-16 03:49:41 The head of the piston glitches out and rapidly expands out, causing your build to be flung
help 2023-03-16 03:50:07 I'd say either open the area around the piston up when it's locked. Or replace the pistons with unlocked motors
help 2023-03-16 03:50:19 The spinny part of the motor faces the hovers
help 2023-03-16 03:50:22 No special configs
help 2023-03-16 03:50:27 Np
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:51:03 Prob won't be till they do shit with all these problems
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:51:08 I wouldent count on it anytime soon
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:51:24 Sorry but it's the brutal truth of game developing
help 2023-03-16 03:52:02 Hm.
help 2023-03-16 03:52:53 It may be from collisions. I am unsure from the angles I can locate in your video
help 2023-03-16 03:53:46 I would doubt check your lock isn't interfering with parts of your planes
help 2023-03-16 03:53:52 Double*
help 2023-03-16 03:54:42 Motor lock is tricky. Even for pros.
help 2023-03-16 03:54:58 They may day It's not, we all know one small mistake could ruin an entire build
help 2023-03-16 03:55:12 I am left clueless
help 2023-03-16 03:55:29 I require better angles of the inside parts to determine the problem and solution
help 2023-03-16 03:55:36 Nope
help 2023-03-16 03:55:43 I wouldent expect it for a while
help 2023-03-16 03:55:49 Pc is crashing downhill
help 2023-03-16 03:57:02 I just wish the mods would relay this to Rick. They seem to be incompetent with their roles.

I do not mean to sound rude. I know what it is to moderate a large server. But it isn't really that hard to talk to someone you are close to (hopefully) about a game.
help 2023-03-16 03:57:17 I would day maybe it's an extreme form of wobble
help 2023-03-16 03:57:20 Say*
help 2023-03-16 03:57:59 Maybe they broke smth with code. (Again)
help 2023-03-16 03:58:48 I mainly gave up on playing the game. I'm just here to act as a somewhat positive and efficient helper. And to speak for others about this games problems.
help 2023-03-16 03:59:15 K
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:59:51 Lag
bug-reports 2023-03-16 03:59:54 And timing
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:00:03 Not everything happens at the same time on a worldwide game
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:00:15 Takes a bit to process and execute
help 2023-03-16 04:00:56 My jets are fine. I make mine survivable to most glitches and bugs (aka using very little glitch substitutes and motor lock)
help 2023-03-16 04:03:38 Motor two is still usable, but is very limited on functional uses nowadays
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:14:53 I would say never with how things are
help 2023-03-16 04:15:43 I wouldent say that
help 2023-03-16 04:16:09 My theory is that the bug forms from the linkage of some system TO the motor two.
help 2023-03-16 04:16:12 Because my jets are fine
help 2023-03-16 04:16:25 So it must be something I don't use, that most ppl with the bug do use in their builds
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:22:08 They are weaker than me doing shoulder workouts 💀
bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:22:25 I

bug-reports 2023-03-16 04:25:14 I do
help 2023-03-16 11:11:26 With what
help 2023-03-16 11:20:26 They aren't going to revert an entire roblox update for a single game.its just not going to happen
help 2023-03-16 11:23:49 Damn. I just realised the situation with contests too. Seems even the mods and admins here are incompetent aswell. No wonder why this server is toxic as hell, only the chat mods are active and its barely ever they do anything.
help 2023-03-16 11:24:56 I bet you they ain't even seeing this.
help 2023-03-16 11:38:29 I don't understand. All my builds are fine, I don't know if it's the way I built them, or something I used like my glitch speed engine. But they work fine
bug-reports 2023-03-16 11:39:43 Read above
bug-reports 2023-03-16 11:40:31 Roblox update screwed them and as usual, mods do nothing to tell rickje and rickje *as usual* never hires some free help from the community to help him
bug-reports 2023-03-16 11:41:07 I wouldent count on it
bug-reports 2023-03-16 11:41:16 Exactly
bug-reports 2023-03-16 11:41:21 More like a year.
bug-reports 2023-03-16 11:41:27 When people start getting real mad
bug-reports 2023-03-16 11:41:51 I've been unaffected by this update. Not sure why
bug-reports 2023-03-16 11:41:58 My motor 2 jets seem fine.
bug-reports 2023-03-16 11:42:19 Nah, I fly fine.
bug-reports 2023-03-16 11:42:32 My jest still fly at 2k+ just fine as they did before.
bug-reports 2023-03-16 11:42:36 Jets*
bug-reports 2023-03-16 11:42:57 Who the hell used cursor custom controll surfaces?
bug-reports 2023-03-16 11:43:18 Just use regular controll surfaces 💀
bug-reports 2023-03-16 11:43:22 There are
bug-reports 2023-03-16 11:43:45 They'll say it's reliable untill their motor gets shot off, uh oh- no more steering for them.
bug-reports 2023-03-16 11:44:09 Meanwhile me with 20 controll surfaces in different parts of the box wing design and body
creations-chat 2023-03-16 11:55:22 Even the bot is breaking. Unfortunate
bug-reports 2023-03-16 11:55:59 Yeah everything here is going to shit. The server is slowly dieing bc of lack of moderation, events n' shit.
bug-reports 2023-03-16 11:56:52 Even the bot quit
help 2023-03-16 12:03:31 It's a custom frame I made for my compact and small builds
help 2023-03-16 12:04:12 Mostly conveyors. Though it only works how I want in special configs
help 2023-03-16 12:05:24 My control surfaces?
help 2023-03-16 12:05:51 Yes
help 2023-03-16 12:06:31 What else would I use?
help 2023-03-16 12:08:08 It doesn't negate physical. I'm not omnibug labs

bug-reports 2023-03-16 14:05:45 That's been on the way since they failed to update to the summer event
bug-reports 2023-03-16 14:05:58 Been downhill since then
bug-reports 2023-03-16 14:07:06 Bugs, glitches. Gettin out of hand
creations-chat 2023-03-16 15:00:03 They need to wake up and server their roles correctly. The game is broken, let's atleast have a functioning discord. 

Can't have shit in plane crazy
creations-chat 2023-03-16 15:03:02 And if they can't, it may be time to resign and hire new admins. I've seenwhat inactive mods can do to a popular server
creations-chat 2023-03-16 15:10:36 That makes more sense and is more understandable
bug-reports 2023-03-16 15:25:22 I wouldent even ask
bug-reports 2023-03-16 15:25:42 I know he sees our pleas. Yet nothing is done. Unfortunately that's the toll life takes
creations-chat 2023-03-16 15:29:45 Many of us don't see the point in posting when we are just going to be blasted by "whitename uh oh he bad"
creations-chat 2023-03-16 15:31:49 He cant, he's another follower in the anti-whitename party. Meanwhile being a designer two, when many of us could surpass him easily.
creations-chat 2023-03-16 15:34:42 I agree, some of them are probably children that just started. Many of just want to have fun and stay out of the line of fire.

creations-chat 2023-03-16 15:41:18 I would have never begun to speak if it wasn't for this place going to shit. Someone needs to speak up to the mods and Rick for their lack of involvement. And like I said before, if your life is too full- we may need more active admins.
bug-reports 2023-03-16 15:45:31 Doesn't matter, like I said many times. Servers going to shit. Mods ain't doing shit. I'm probably going to get warned or worse for speaking up to them. But hey, it's their faults this place is shit now.
contest-chat 2023-03-16 15:47:03 Nothings gonna change here.
creations-chat 2023-03-16 15:51:30 Here we go again.
creations-chat 2023-03-16 15:55:11 There are the many that do that. The good of us understand we are not to valued expectations of higher ranked persons. There's also the fact that it is hard for us to rank because of this "whitename".
help 2023-03-16 15:56:10 Very good fire extinguisher
creations-chat 2023-03-16 15:59:15 Basically they think that people with uncolored users are bad (most are) meanwhile some of us just don't think it's worth posting and getting blasted with "whitename bad"
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:01:20 That is the most amazing price of advice ive heard today.

Yes I know that.
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:04:17 I don't even play the game anymore.

I'm just here to help others and give constructive criticism against the mods and Rick that aren't doing much for their dieing community.
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:11:37 Seems chat has finaly returned to normal
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:32:54 Average day in the community if plane crazy <:empty:794431705070174238>
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:36:13 Indeed dino. It's a fun game but the disadvantages outweighs the advantages, there are other games out there which have more content and have less bugs. But they don't have as much freedom as this does, which is why I do not switch to another game.
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:38:58 And I know he sees our messages, he just doesn't care enough to act. It's inevitable by now. This community is both dead and destroyed.
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:39:24 If he cared he would have already told us the reason for his inactivity
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:39:29 Yep
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:39:49 They wont
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:40:00 It's a small game compared to the giants that make them money
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:40:10 They don't care
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:40:25 Not many games use these physics
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:40:57 Then hopefully they will
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:41:46 But that has little effect on the status of the community. It is Rick's and the mods fault. I've been through the collapse of big servers. It's due to lock of moderation.. mostly
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:44:23 You call the average day in pcc normal?
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:44:41 It's been a dieing community since before the update
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:44:47 It just worsened the situation
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:46:39 There's really no point in talking. Things won't change. The death of this community is inevitable.
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:47:05 Limits are becoming more and more apparent.
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:47:47 The new motor two glitches, the updates with helium that broke most mechs. Controll surface breaks, performance. Bugs.

bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:48:17 Makes making airships almost impossible balance correctly
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:49:00 That's good. It's still a major problem that needs to be fixed for those who don't know
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:49:27 I've been considering it.
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:50:34 You don't USE bugs to make builds, you use glitches that function properly and were coded into the game to work
bug-reports 2023-03-16 16:50:55 Hard coded. Which is worse for the game
bug-reports 2023-03-16 17:17:58 I'm surprised
bug-reports 2023-03-16 17:18:01 And glad
creations-chat 2023-03-16 18:41:49 What is your opinion of a "Good build"? I'm curious
help 2023-03-16 18:42:15 Roblox reverted the update
creations-chat 2023-03-16 18:51:19 So jets? They are very nice. Though they require a decent device and skill to make and function by the looks of it.
creations-chat 2023-03-16 18:54:56 Show the xwing plz?
creations-chat 2023-03-16 18:57:01 Valid, I don't post due to my "whitename" status. I'm here to chill and speak my mind.

Also I wouldent say that mig, its very close resembled to the fictional concept. Though I can see why it's not people's prefrence.
creations-chat 2023-03-16 19:00:19 Okay, you don't need to care. I'm just speaking my mind.👍
creations-chat 2023-03-16 19:03:21 You do have good preference. I just think that expecting that of everyone is a bit much. But again, you all have your own preferences.
creations-chat 2023-03-16 19:05:41 When they fix hypershit bot. (Never) mods be lazy rn.
creations-chat 2023-03-16 19:07:52 Sorry. I didn't know. I don't really pay attention to most stuff abt the bot. All I know is that it's gonna be a long time till it's fixed

help 2023-03-16 19:20:04 That's what people are saying
creations-chat 2023-03-16 19:25:42 Yes I know not all good builds are just jets. I am against that example. I make anything I feel like making. I'm just saying those are good examples of good builds.

bug-reports 2023-03-21 02:32:27 It doesn't really matter if it's known. People are just reporting a bug (which they did not know was already known) in hopes they would get some awnsers.

bug-reports 2023-03-21 03:07:08 That's the only excuse you have?
bug-reports 2023-03-21 03:07:16 Okay then.

bug-reports 2023-03-21 14:32:12 And no I'm not saying you did
bug-reports 2023-03-21 14:32:16 I'm speaking in general
bug-reports 2023-03-21 14:36:14 And its not your role to tell them. It's the inactive and lazy mods.
