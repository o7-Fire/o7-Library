creations-chat 2021-03-10 03:30:56 what
it's not a tutorial, i built it myself?

<@!587047177558163466> <@!738702049113538600> thanks for using your damn brain unlike these idiots

edit: 1
creations-chat 2021-03-10 03:36:04 <@!555601119473041409> LOL that barrel is NOT a solid piece... look closely instead of just taking a glance and assuming since it's the same model it's a tutorial
creations-chat 2021-03-10 03:40:42 because he assumed you were right
creations-chat 2021-03-10 03:42:47 i was wondering why so many people downvoted it ðŸ¤£ i guess people dont look at the details before voting
creations-chat 2021-03-10 03:58:25 at this point i dont care
creations-chat 2021-03-10 04:00:32 anyone know why the slowmode here is so long you can post messages faster in <#384025409945337856>? seems a bit overkill to me
ah LOL i see why now
yes yes i get the point now, but i'd find it entertaining if there were a million arguments over a few upvotes or downvotes 
<@!565376886843244544> god damn you got me
creations-chat 2021-03-10 04:04:33 the color and shape?? look at the barrel ffs, it's not the tutorial - i would never be that stupid to plagerize
creations-chat 2021-03-10 04:08:10 i call it; i dont want anyone telling me my own design i worked hard on is a tutorial and im taking it down 
i'm tired, i'm awfully tired, god i'm tired
i'm tired and it's a lot of baloney
