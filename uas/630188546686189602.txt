The Tale of rexfattex (630188546686189602)
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:50:32 as a shredder expert, there are several key elements missing:
**Explosives**: These things are the bane of most shredders. One strike at the wrong spot and they get blown to bits.
**Cutters**: Their own weapon. Let them fly into it and shred themselves.
*hide the fold a smart person would go after it*
build looks good in general though
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:55:12 but then again
that thing could kill it because most of the shredder users out there just home their mouse on things blindly, allowing for easy aim
creations-chat 2022-07-20 17:57:46 just dont make the flag red n white bc it kinda makes it look like it
soup has a point too, its actually rlly old and means peace (originally at least)

creations-chat 2023-04-13 15:16:52 conveyor and spring engine yes
creations-chat 2023-04-13 15:19:01 hover is generally the best mix between stability and speed; and works with any size build
magnet is for smaller builds or submarines otherwise its ass
conveyor is only good for very small builds otherwise its extremely unstable; also only goes a constant speed. most maneuverable though (and speed king)
spring is too unstable to be used effectively and should only be used on large heavy ground builds (its also tricky as fuck to pull off and not known)

or you can just use super rockets. or small props.
creations-chat 2023-04-13 15:21:53 by unstable i mean its shaky as hell and will fling your build into the void/deadzone probs
