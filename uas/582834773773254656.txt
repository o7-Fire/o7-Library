creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:05:39 > Conv engines on planes can’t possibly be stable over 3000 speed unless it’s vertically and horizontally symmetrical
<@456226577798135808> yeah thats why it needs some fine tuning to get it perfectly straight at 3k

creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:09:54 wha? boat doesn't go on land
creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:10:15 hence the name "BO A  T"
creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:11:22 obsessed with that thing?
creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:12:30 > Boat doesnt have any words relating to water inside of it, meaning if you didnt know what a boat was and heard the word, you’d have no idea what it was. So your hence the name comment makes no sense
<@456226577798135808> lmfao have you ever seen boats that goes on land (besides amphibious vehicles)?
creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:13:08 then what's your point? i aint reading that damn essay

creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:15:25 im surprised that this "argument" thing hasn't escalated to a higher level lol
creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:17:31 the word "boat" actually means something so it isn't the name itself that plays a role. A boat means a water vehicle that is used for military and or civillian purpose
creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:19:06 well who doesn't know the word "boat"? in this entire server?
creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:19:26 > "Boats can't go on land!"

creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:34:33 > slowly running out of space

creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:34:50 > You shouldn’t say that as if you’ve won something, if you can’t relate those sentences I’m convinced a chicken learned to type
<@456226577798135808> i didn't say that like i won something
creations-chat 2020-10-06 02:35:13 > the wings would be quite big

bug-reports 2020-10-06 23:52:57 > So i have experienced this bug before, it is VERY annoying, it happens with signs and text throughout the whole build, so in my case i am building the H-4 Hercules, and i was putting the tail registration number on (NX37602) When doing so, i found that *NX* was tagged, i easily got around this by typing *N X*. when i moved the *N X* to the tail of the plane, it tagged, it also tagged on the other original text. It put a stricter chat filter on the signs and text than before and theres no way to reverse or get around this.

<@!447221768520859659> yes there is and its inactive ;-;
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:43:57 > Well, this communities standards have dropped so much since when i joined, back in the day my 109 would have been lucky to get 20 upvotes, and your arguing over a couple downvotes?
<@!588596347272167456> Not arguing but yes standards have dropped sadly
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:44:26 to the point where shit builds could get 60-70 likes
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:45:14 > If a boeing 747 can carry a space shuttle, why cant it carry overfull luggage?
<@!712243348639055913> im not answering this
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:45:31 > Its because of the huge amount of braindead idiots who dont know what a good build is bcuz they cant build well themselves
<@!588596347272167456> EXACTLY.... EXACTLY
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:47:24 yeah..... People spend hours on some build. And yet they couldnt get pass 50 likes (not all but mostly) and **SHIT**  Builds could get SHIT tons of LIKES
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:49:19 > Well, the og people left bcuz upvotes have no merit anymore, they are guarenteed upcotes if they post something even just average, the new people just upvote everything and its basically ruining the premise of creations
<@!588596347272167456> you dont need to post something that's average. Shitbuilds could get tons of likes (20 block builds)
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:49:49 lmfao
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:50:15 > i doubt the og people left from upvotes, they probably left because they're tired of pcc or pc
<@!447221768520859659> they're tired of having unders coming to the server basically acting toxic like what happened to guggi
creations-chat 2020-10-12 11:50:57 he left the server cause some kids decided it would be funny to bully him (probably just annoyed rather than mad)

creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:01:42 rens has it. its nearly done
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:03:25 maybe multiple airports would be cool
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:03:41 > What if rick added weather
<@!615810446724694018> and wind<:PogU:670373666164572172>
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:05:47 not that he cant. Making wedges is hard. according to rick, it takes a few hours to make a single wedge. He's currently trying to make the game sorta softcoded for easier additions like said wedges
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:06:10 > Rickje said he will never add a bigger plot
<@!683069192143896594> that would change soon idk when
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:06:43 maybe plane crazy 2?
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:07:09 > 2.1k lines of code for motors<:PogStare:699130318510227537>
<@!447221768520859659> see? imagine wedges. a single wedge type has 4 sizes.
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:07:28 > we would lose all of our progress if rick makes a new game
<@!447221768520859659> idc tbh, a better game would be better game i'd risk my savedata for a better game and who knows maybe he could implement savedata in the new game
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:08:09 thats easy to make
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:08:29 > Well i mean how hard can it be to make a wedge, you take the 1x1 and extend it  and then take the hitbox and stretch it
<@!588596347272167456> that part is easy, the coding is harder
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:08:56 you gotta account for paint, rotation X Y Z axis
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:09:20 which would be a pain to code according to rick (no im not a coder_
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:09:59 > and movment and destruction
<@!615810446724694018> exactly. Now imagine doing that on 3 types of wedges with 4 diffrent sizes. thats 12 items being coded
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:10:19 > Its his own fualt in the first place
<@!588596347272167456> well maybe he wasnt expecting the game to blow up like this
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:11:24 softcoding is easier said than done expecially for rick
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:12:31 > <@!582834773773254656> From my experience, soft coding is basically how organized your code is. If your code isn't organized, thigns can break easily
<@!615810446724694018> yes
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:16:23 My country sux. Education is wack as fuck
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:16:44 no
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:17:09 indonesia
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:17:44 where budget for books are effected by corruptions. So basically we get some shit quality books

creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:19:11 while those aussies are giving away free laptops, our country wont even give free books goddamit
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:19:39 7.00-12.00 for me
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:19:59 > huh never realised how fortunate I am
<@!615810446724694018> you might be really fortunate. my country may be bad at education but not my school
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:21:39 so basically the students in my country including my school gets oppressed by the amount of burden they put on us
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:22:16 and my school is really tough. Like till the point where the min score is 78 and gettign 85 is FUCKING hard
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:23:39 > you guys get opressed , at top schools in my country they get a average of 3 pages of homework at every class
<@!672135256958173225> mine's not homework frankly its the amount of shit lessons they cram into your head
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:24:56 especially when on finals where we gotta study shitloads of shit (2 tests per day) for 8 days. so basically its like hell week but for your brain
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:25:29 > the worst thing is, in some countries, the government makes profit of expensive health care. Basically making money off lives being lost
<@!615810446724694018> America....
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:25:52 we get cheap healthcare here. Well compared to america that is
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:26:59 > my school fights other school lmao
<@456226577798135808> my school wouldnt dare do that but some other schools would assault other schools with machettes and *Clurit* a traditional weapon go look it up
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:27:48 not mine but others yes they act kinda wild sometimes
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:28:26 my school has educated students (polite) compared to other schools since my school is a catholic one
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:28:58 so for god's sake we wouldnt assault other schools since our uh religion is minor compared to the other religion (muslims) we would be murdered and we mostly chinese  indonesians so we should watch ourselves or else discrimination is visible but invisible to tourists
creations-chat 2020-10-12 12:31:22 > <@456226577798135808> That kid is messed up

the-dump 2020-12-13 12:48:01 Tis true my form is something odd.
But blaming me is blaming God;
Could I create myself anew,
I would not fail in pleasing you.
If I could reach from pole to pole,
Or grasp the ocean with a span,
I would be measured by the soul,
The mind's the standard of the man.

creations-chat 2021-04-22 10:44:28 First of all, I''m gonna say what i usually say, 

1. Desaturate the brown

3. Remake the stairs, it's bland
4. Behind the cactus, i can see a gray wall, it would be nice if you'd add some other colors and add texture to the walls

creations-chat 2021-04-30 07:52:22 There's a massive player difference between AC and plane crazy though AC uses F3X, the majority of us like something simple and easy to learn, whereas some players actually like modelling like a pro, its a personal preference and because plane crazy has more players, then it's safe to say that people prefer plane crazy than AC

creations-chat 2021-05-25 12:29:55 So if i take a pic that happens to be the same composition as yours, that would count as copying? 🤡

It isn't valid here, you can only complain about builds getting copied not the picture's composition
creations-chat 2021-05-25 12:35:07 are the builds the same?
creations-chat 2021-05-25 12:38:00 Do they look the same?

Oh and by the way, those aren't destroyers, those are battleships the builder stated himself
creations-chat 2021-05-25 12:41:59 The ships in said pictures are way different, one of them is better. way better
creations-chat 2021-05-25 12:44:00 Hmm, yeah what's the point of that floating motor lmao

I doubt it, why would they look back 2 months ago to find an eyesore of a fleet formation?

the-dump 2021-09-08 06:43:07 jojo summed up:
the-dump 2021-09-08 06:44:46 why are you spamming that?
the-dump 2021-09-08 06:54:01 I FORGOR
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:54:37 what would happen if we were to find out that aliens were somehow ancestrally related to us humans
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:55:18 correct
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:57:04 ion think wormholes could send you back in time
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:57:10 freeze time? probably
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:57:25 since you would probably move so fast that time slows down
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:58:07 we would be in deep trouble if they are fully blown space age civilization
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:58:51 <:PauseChamp:670868208588423168>
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:59:03 perhaps the universe is infinite
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:59:10 no beginning no end
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:59:16 infinite
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:59:44 the observable universe is only around 12 b lys
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:59:51 yet
the-dump 2021-09-08 07:59:51 we dont know beyond that
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:00:06 perhaps there are more after that
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:00:22 well there must be more
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:01:16 i'd love to hop on a spaceship
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:01:25 liek the ones in sci fi movies
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:02:07 they must exist
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:02:23 we probably couldn't detect them yet
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:02:31 perhaps it has connection with dark matter or something
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:02:42 that would be almighty unlikely
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:02:47 but possible
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:03:31 send death row inmates for the ride of their lives
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:03:47 that would be the best way to go out imo
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:04:26 slower
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:04:32 not faster right?
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:04:47 the bigger the mass
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:04:50 the slower time flows
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:04:54 no
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:04:55 slower
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:05:01 oh yes
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:05:03 yes
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:05:12 wait
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:05:14 confused
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:05:29 thats why it's exciting
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:05:38 you never know what to expect
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:05:48 expect the unexpected
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:06:07 wait, if you were to expect the unexpected, wouldn't that make the unexpected expected?

the-dump 2021-09-08 08:06:50 Brainstorming moment
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:07:34 What if wood is one of the rarest material in the galaxy and has uses that we don't even know yet
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:07:43 think about it
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:07:49 wood comes from plants
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:07:57 plants = living beings
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:08:13 so it  would probably be rarer than diamonds in the galaxy
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:08:38 yes
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:08:40 wait.
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:08:51 you never know
the-dump 2021-09-08 08:08:58 there might be heat resistant plants

the-dump 2022-09-21 12:44:16 genshin is okay to play
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:44:30 until you realize that genshin sucks your soul
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:44:35 and drains your sanity
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:46:55 it is okay
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:47:04 like i said
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:47:07 until you realize
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:47:12 before that
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:47:14 then its okay
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:47:21 <:OkayChamp:709084018485887096>
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:47:39 indeed
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:47:46 after playing genshin for quite some time now
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:47:51 i have come to a conclusion
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:47:53 that genshin
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:47:54 is
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:47:59 bad
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:48:12 its mentally demanding
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:48:28 the story is quite interesting
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:48:51 did i said that genshin has the best story?
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:48:55 say*
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:49:01 goodness gracious my grammar
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:49:28 means that there are obviously better stories

the-dump 2022-09-21 12:49:50 you got a point
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:50:10 gets repetitive after some time lmao
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:52:20 then the entirety of the game wouldn't exist
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:52:30 since anime - styled people don't exist
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:52:54 Honestly i dont understand people hating on genshin
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:53:03 its just from my perspective
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:53:12 let them play the game
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:53:25 what exactly?
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:53:32 that one i can't argue
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:53:57 what in tarnation
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:54:04 look too sexy?
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:54:09 WHAT KIND OF EXCUSE IS THAT LMFAOOO
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:54:42 oh my
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:54:44 nevermidn
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:55:17 fans are down bad
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:55:43 still watch my fair share of anime sometimes
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:55:46 what bothers me is
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:55:49 the voice acting
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:55:56 my god is it bad
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:56:19 some of them are really good don't get me wrong
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:56:40 but the regular not-so-popular animes have shit voice acting
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:56:50 that would be interesting ngl
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:57:17 really depends
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:57:21 on what the artists make
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:57:31 degenerate content
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:57:37 or just something that looks cool
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:58:05 I also do not understand why people like furries
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:58:07 they scare me
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:58:35 okay this might be a good excuse as to why people love them but
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:58:37 hear me out
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:58:47 why on earth would you refer yourself as an animal
the-dump 2022-09-21 12:58:56 wear a collar and such
