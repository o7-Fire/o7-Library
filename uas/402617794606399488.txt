creations-chat 2019-07-10 15:58:55 @Deciduus Sorry I'm late, but Deciduus... yes, I used Movie Maker. lol, I've had Shotcut for a little bit, but in this video I didn't use it.

creations-chat 2019-07-10 16:00:42 I have some pirated copy of Adobe Premiere CS3 and I might want to learn how to use it, but it seems pretty outdated, still probably better than what I'm using now, though.
creations-chat 2019-07-10 16:01:13 ok
creations-chat 2019-07-10 16:01:26 the reason i dont is because i dont have the time to learn it

creations-chat 2022-09-02 15:10:26 <@697939407730376854> your 787 is pretty good, but the engine shape is too square-like, nose is a tad too steep (more like an a350 nose), and the landing gears are too small

contest-chat 2022-09-19 21:19:24 no its just kind of funny because everyone in borsch was getting mad at me for not doing my su-25 the way that they would do it and then someone does it almost exactly the same way i did it but with a couple mistakes
contest-chat 2022-09-19 21:19:48 a month after i upload mine
contest-chat 2022-09-19 21:36:33 it's ok ig there's only so many ways you can make a build in plane crazy
contest-chat 2022-09-19 21:36:45 but i wouldn't recommend doing deliberately that going forth
contest-chat 2022-09-19 21:37:03 bro you dont gotta call me sir lol im 15
contest-chat 2022-09-19 21:37:07 but i appreciate it
contest-chat 2022-09-20 13:16:58 like i said the dude admitted to copying, i can tell when people use my builds as a reference or if they're just a bit similar and this was definitely the first one
contest-chat 2022-09-20 13:17:44 😍
contest-chat 2022-09-20 13:18:38 i see and im going to remain silent about whether i agree or not

dumbass kids dont understand that content creators dont wanna give away builds they spent weeks on for free
not to mention the fact that not only would the tutorial take a ridiculously long amount of time and be extremely difficult to make, but the kids in the comments would make a million mistakes and complain that its too hard and doesnt work
creations-chat 2022-09-26 18:04:00 ong, i hate tutorials and i hate making them but the only reason i make them sometimes is because they literally save my channel
yeah i guess im a sellout but i wouldnt be doing it if they werent so high in demand
creations-chat 2022-09-26 18:08:03 fireyoblivion really out there doing gods work

creations-chat 2022-09-27 16:35:14 <@690727914521493504> why'd you skip the other builds and only downvote mine

Didn't even upvote/ downvote the others.

<@690727914521493504> not mad just curious as you only just downvoted as I said that
creations-chat 2022-09-27 16:37:16 look at what i was replying to 🗿
creations-chat 2022-09-27 16:40:34 dnc that you downvoted, was not even talking to you
(also isnt it kind of dumb to downvote a build solely based on the fact that it is based on a meme)
creations-chat 2022-09-27 16:45:22 thank you
creations-chat 2022-09-27 17:13:07 bro you're the kind of person to downvote a really good f22 just because you dont like the real f22
creations-chat 2022-09-27 17:18:06 donk-inator
creations-chat 2022-09-27 17:51:27 yeah thats just plain toxic lmao
creations-chat 2022-09-27 17:53:29 i voted for it 💀
not because its amazing as a general build but because its good considering the plane crazy c-130 standards, its very rare to see a good c130
creations-chat 2022-09-27 18:42:26 i was imitating the stupid thing you said like 2 months ago lmao
(literally blind)
creations-chat 2022-09-27 18:44:30 did think the hypocracy was kind of funny though lol
creations-chat 2022-09-27 19:25:04 thats really good

propellers? really bro 🤭
creations-chat 2022-09-28 14:34:57 yeah bro definitely bro
creations-chat 2022-09-28 14:39:39 its super easy, actually, barely an inconvenience
creations-chat 2022-09-28 14:59:27 fr man
creations-chat 2022-09-28 15:07:23 that quote was a reference to ryan george so i was partly kidding
creations-chat 2022-09-28 16:12:37 yeah it ruins it, they're ugly as shit
and then also the weird ugly golden half block ball thing on the top of the rotor should probably go too
but everything else about the build is good
creations-chat 2022-09-28 16:14:42 mb yeah just change it to a pearl white-ish grey
creations-chat 2022-09-28 21:40:02 it does
creations-chat 2022-09-28 21:42:03 ^^^ looks a little worse but functions better, less lag, and is easier
(it's what i do)

creations-chat 2022-09-29 00:13:07 LMAO
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:35:47 if you have some random egirl for your pfp, then you most likely dont get bitches
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:38:03 hang on dawg im not on your side either
its always annoying as fuck when someone downvotes your build just to do it when they suck ass at the game
half the people who downvoted my donkey copter are posting literal cabbage mobile shit
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:41:15 i mean whats even your reasoning for downvoting it other than the fact that it isnt perfectly roscale
everyones entitled to an opinion but its annoying when someone downvotes a good build just to go against the grain and then they just say they "don't like the build" like dog it's clearly the best that can be done in plane crazy, an extremely limited game
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:43:25 fr man 😭
naw i still understand why people downvoted it, it's a meme build which a lot of people don't like because it's not AIRBUS EMB-747-1080TI 🤓 and it's also not the best quality either
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:45:34 donkey copter most upvoted build in plane crazy in 2 minutes!! <:MyDolphinIsntWorking:552912733008429081> 
also thanks for the compliment
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:47:39 <@910695311675097178> don't take the mass downvoting personally, the PCC doesn't like basic 1 block wide builds
that's good for a first motor lock build and you're going down the right path, it just needs some details and the exposed lock sticks out a lot which there isn't much you can do about at that scale
creations-chat 2022-09-29 01:54:34 ok dude i get your frustration but just let it go it's not worth it
also it's not even your build
bot-central 2022-09-29 02:22:01 uh

creations-chat 2022-10-11 14:46:50 fr, im so sick of people putting shaders on their builds in creations to try and hide their goofy ass roscale build's flaws and get more upvotes
and when the shaders are bad it just becomes hilarious
creations-chat 2022-10-11 14:49:07 morfix's new hind is goofy af so i am going to have to disagree
creations-chat 2022-10-11 14:54:47 its just so fucking funny when people put the eye emoji like they're hyping it up and then proceed to post some goofy ass build
like this is just so hysterical
creations-chat 2022-10-11 14:56:52 bro its literally a challenge to make a decent build under 500 blocks
also fr about the not improving in 2 years thing
creations-chat 2022-10-11 14:58:57 i did a bit of trolling
creations-chat 2022-10-11 15:01:04 im scared its gonna get taken down for low effort build but actually the engine has some angle lock and the build took me like an hour and a half despite its goofy appearance lmao
creations-chat 2022-10-11 15:03:06 perfectly balanced as all things should be
creations-chat 2022-10-11 15:07:52 imagine downvoting a masterpiece just to go against the grain 😡

its merely a mockup, a preservation of history
creations-chat 2022-10-11 15:35:01 because that build was a meme recreation lmao (dont let the mods see this they dont like joke builds)
creations-chat 2022-10-11 15:37:29 nono its not copying i put pink stripe on engine you see
also the elevator different
creations-chat 2022-10-11 15:39:38 look dude if someone else can copy my su25 and submit it to a contest i should be able to remake a meme build from over a year ago
creations-chat 2022-10-11 15:41:45 ok guys since the meme builds i posted both technically qualify as copied and low effort, i think i should probably delete them 😔 the fun is over

creations-chat 2022-10-23 19:56:19 <@763062253410844702> build blows, but that garageband cover is FIRE 🔥
creations-chat 2022-10-23 19:59:54 i dont think i need to provide feedback for every build i dislike, but since you requested it-- sure

the shape of the tail boom is blocky and inaccurate, the build as a whole could use a lot of detail and some weathering, the external fuel tanks on the wings could be smoothened out a lot either with motor lock or adding signs and disconnectors to each side, the colors seem a bit inaccurate, and generally im just not a big fan of the build

it's not a terrible build, it's just not good imo either
creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:47:44 that was pretty good, thats a really nice piano
all i have is a 25 key midi controller with mini keys so i cant really play much but its really fun to play with and its good for basic melodies
and ive also played roblox piano since march and ive played guitar for two years so i think i would be decent at learning piano
creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:49:50 its goofy, looks like a mix between the mad vulpen tutorial and my c-130
windshield is too high, the fuselage is too tall, and the nose is kind of strange looking
it could also be a lot smoother
creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:51:59 i figured, that piano you were playing on is still really nice even though its not yours
good playing 👍 killed me how you didnt end on the resolve chord though
creations-chat 2022-10-23 21:54:05 that makes me happy to know people are using my crappy builds for inspiration 🙂 
like i said its pretty decent but i just think it needs some work
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:07:44 JESUS CHRIST WHAT IS MINTY'S PROBLEM
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:10:22 literally the best f4 in the game and minty probably looks at it and goes "ehhh the f4 phantom is overrated. i don't like the build." and downvotes it
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:12:33 shes legit the bitch of PCC
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:14:36 pcc standards are so scuffed, my fucking donkey helicopter  got 415 upvotes and then the best f4 in the game gets less upvotes in the same amount of time elapsed
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:16:39 ong, what ive tried to tell her is that you shouldnt downvote a build just because you dont like the real thing, you should downvote it if the quality is bad

like im not even a fan of the f4 phantom but theres literally no universe where i would downvote that because the build is gorgeous and smooth and detailed and the camo is wonderful and the angles are splendid annd MMMMM 😋
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:18:44 ive seen her builds, they're not even good they're just goofy
she made some mig 23 that looked like a drawing made by an 8 year old
she is literally epitome discord mod
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:20:56 i didnt have any pictures of it but it was unpainted and all the angles and proportions were ridiculously wack
she claims her builds are "experimental" and "test builds" or something but its obviously just an excuse
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:23:02 used to be a he <:trollface:775024642104229898> but shes been a she for like 2 or 3 years i think
creations-chat 2022-10-24 17:25:04 that f4 could get into the hall of fame and literally be the best thing in there, i mean if this thing could get in then the f4 is an easy W

contest-chat 2022-11-06 16:17:08 it doesnt have a rotor
contest-chat 2022-11-06 16:17:47 do the wings count as a rotor
contest-chat 2022-11-06 16:18:05 i guess it actually does kind of check all the boxes
contest-chat 2022-11-06 16:18:11 now that i think about it
creations-chat 2022-11-14 01:33:57 my firend making a c130 and everyone is praising it but i think it looks bad am i the only one
creations-chat 2022-11-14 01:44:24 he fr looks like a cartoon drawing
creations-chat 2022-11-14 01:50:07 Fr
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:13:39 <@993299330695975002> nice madvulpen copy
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:17:11 lmao it obviously is, every aspect is exactly the same except the paint because copiers never know how to paint their copies decently
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:19:42 buddy, think whatever YOU want but it 100% is-- you can keep denying it, that wont get you anywhere, but you and i both know deep down that you copied it

also judging by your pfp and bio you have clearly been around mad vulpen's f-22 a lot which raises the likelihood that you copied or took heavy inspiration
edit: nvm i got it backwards but you still copied
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:21:45 it doesnt look like a tutorial, but it does look like madvulpens f-22 showcase
also <@993299330695975002> are you a vulpen fan just answer honestly
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:24:41 ^^^
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:27:18 delivery Lol
2. ok you might not be a fan but you still copied him L
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:30:02 wait ayo ignoring the paint the FRONT OF HIS ACTUALLY LOOKS BETTER LOL
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:32:51 yeah
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:47:14 look at the engines, the intakes, the gears, the spine, the wings, the aft
a lot of it looks either copied or heavily inspired by vulpen's
i will agree that shiro's f-22 is better aside from the paint, but the livery is ass and a lot of components are blatantly copied from vulpen's
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:55:26 fabric wing panels make it wobble a lot less, so try adding a bunch of those in the nose
creations-chat 2022-11-14 20:57:40 WIP f-18 any feedback
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:00:06 it uses rockets because its a 2 wide and hover engines made it too laggy so its slow (max speed is only like 570 😭)
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:02:15 full top down
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:13:25 hover engines, but you need to have a good computer to add them on large builds because they induce lag
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:16:51 a hover engine is just a hover thruster placed facing an unpowered motor (they both face toward each other) and you use the keybinds set to the hover thruster to control the speed
you can stack them and sh i'd probably look up a tutorial though just so you understand
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:20:46 hull shape kind of funny, colors a bit bland, ladders look kind of blocky
but thats me nitpicking, its pretty solid
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:23:43 ~~🤓~~
(jk)
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:31:17 oh yeah that happened because of an error lol it was less steep of an angle before but i made a mistake and that happened and i just kept it because i thought it looked okay
but ill put it back
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:35:55 bro not laggy? what are you on they dropped my f18 from 35 fps to 15 fps i had to replace them with super rocket engines
you must have a really good computer
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:43:09 2019 type beat
creations-chat 2022-11-14 21:54:40 you asked for feedback, people give you feedback, and then you just combat it and argue that there's nothing wrong Lol
if several people are saying something then usually something's up
i mean no offense by this
creations-chat 2022-11-14 22:03:37 much better
creations-chat 2022-11-14 22:05:47 bro it wasnt because it was "unique" its because you copied a youtuber 💀 
LOL HE LEFT
creations-chat 2022-11-15 14:11:19 bro a 186 mph train should NOT be 600 sps lol it should be like 250
creations-chat 2022-11-15 14:13:24 bro i just called it a plane 💀 i really dont know anything about trains
creations-chat 2022-11-15 18:38:07 BRO MINTY UPVOTES A MID TOMCAT THAT LOOKS LIKE EVERY OTHER ONE BUT SHE DOWNVOTES SR'S F-4 PHANTOM
creations-chat 2022-11-15 18:41:12 (no offense to scout, its not bad it just kind of looks like every other f14 i see)
creations-chat 2022-11-15 18:43:26 Fr
creations-chat 2022-11-15 18:47:08 surprised she didnt go "F-14 is overrated. i don't like this build." and downvote it
creations-chat 2022-11-15 20:30:50 because its funny, its obviously satirical
builds that are bad but obviously weren't made as a joke get downvoted because they're actually just unironically bad
creations-chat 2022-11-15 21:23:58 who desired
oh
creations-chat 2022-11-21 04:57:55 any feedback
creations-chat 2022-11-21 05:09:40 yeah the nose isnt long, it actually looks too short from above whilst looking fine from the side
i was told the issue is that i need to move the LERXS back by a block but the way i set up the motor lock i cant do that 😢
creations-chat 2022-11-21 05:30:03 left or right
creations-chat 2022-11-21 05:38:16 i liked left more because the shape is a little more accurate and its a little less goofy and skinny looking but all my friends said right because its shorter so i think im going with right but i prefer the look of left more too
creations-chat 2022-11-21 05:47:45 yeah i mnot a fan of this shape but the people of Borschuna are going to murder me if i change it back
creations-chat 2022-11-21 05:52:20 it became 10% less toxic when edmund left
still has a couple toxic mfs though
creations-chat 2022-11-21 06:24:48 he used to be cool but then he just started bullying me for no reason and it got to the point where he fucking started selling pictures of my FEET to people on gaijin
FOR ACTUAL MONEY
creations-chat 2022-11-21 06:30:12 1. decent looking custom engine wasnt possible to make, but thanks for the suggestion

2. the elevators, or "pitch wings" as you call them lmao, are actually fine its just hard to see the edges because of the color of the asphalt

3. im not sure what you mean by the ailerons looking disconnected (yes those are ailerons not flaps) but they're literally just control surfaces on the back of the wing so im not sure how they look "disconnected" that's about as solidly filled in as it can look

4. wing length is kind of hard to accurately judge because the canopy is a little too wide so it throws off the scale of everything a little bit, but i see where you're coming from
creations-chat 2022-11-21 06:32:43 blackmailed me, i dont really want to talk about it
i was obviously extremely naive about it but i still definitely didnt do it willingly
creations-chat 2022-11-21 06:40:16 ah i understand the wing length thing now, you meant width
i'll try to see what i can do about that
still don't understand the disconnected thing
creations-chat 2022-11-21 17:06:08 blackmail
he ended up claiming he was "joking" but it was actually a thing that could have potentially ruined my friendship with a certain friend, or at least i thought at the time
i was still being fucking stupidiot though
creations-chat 2022-11-21 17:09:11 GAH DUM
creations-chat 2022-11-21 17:12:20 (the fool doesn't realize he's talking about the majority of fighter, attack, and training aircraft, and that the slightly overscale size allows for more detail)
creations-chat 2022-11-21 17:27:10 no that wasnt a joke why tf would i do that
he said HE was joking later but i didnt KNOW it
and he literally ended up SELLING them to people (what the fuck)
creations-chat 2022-11-21 17:35:54 yeah i understand that now and i kind of understood that back then but i was being naive as hell and made a fucked up mistake and let a fucked up person take advantage of me
it only makes matters worse that i literally have midget feet Lol
creations-chat 2022-11-22 16:33:16 tf you talking about that shits horrid
creations-chat 2022-11-22 16:37:08 there's your problem, you are making a giant anime crystal in plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-11-22 16:50:11 bros got so worked up over me not complimenting anime that he got warned for bad word usage LMAO bro was probably like "anime so good you suck you fucking #### i hare you peopl build what the f####ing want you stupid ###!!" 🤓
creations-chat 2022-11-22 16:56:50 <@1004207882784489472> gemotry darsh fcube my beloved..
i remember making a 3d one out of paper and tape in 2nd grade and i was so proud of it but then my mom threw it away when i got home and i was distraught <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2022-11-22 17:34:54 L
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:06:58 
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:10:08 really messy and bad and too close together, i was just happy that i was able to make gears that properly fold into the engines
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:13:32 retracted
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:20:01 
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:22:02 retracted
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:25:20 there are no others, theres only one on the wheel and then the motor is covered with a grey wedge so only one hole can be seen when retracted
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:43:07 i couldn't because of the way i set up my motor lock
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:45:35 alright then what do you suggest i do, i couldnt do rotated control surface engines because they looked like shit and didnt fit with the smooth style of the spine so i resorted to large jet engines because my friend who's significantly better than me told me to
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:48:02 yeah bro an expert
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:50:33 no, i just sent his f18 which was made less than a month ago so theres no excuse for it to be so bad

also wtf happened to upvotes and downvotes on my f18
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:52:51 yeah i wish i could do that, i spent like an hour trying to but it wasn't possible <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:54:57 alright, putting aside your... expertise... 💀 how do you think i should improve the aft of my f-18, criticism is fine if you can back it up or provide helpful information on how to improve it
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:57:16 well sometimes a build is so fucked up beyond repair it isnt even worth listing all of the problems because it's just so bad and has so many issues, but i don't think my f-18 has that issue (no i'm not implying that my f-18 is perfect or anywhere near perfect it still has a sizable amount of flaws)
creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:59:41 because your f18 isnt done yet its really solid so far
creations-chat 2022-11-22 19:12:34 you cant react to messages in creations chat, but b-29
creations-chat 2022-11-22 19:14:58 j-20 is really just a shitty f-22 and su-57 knockoff though
creations-chat 2022-11-22 19:17:05 oh dear i worry for this man.. you're in for a real shit storm dude  <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>

creations-chat 2022-11-22 19:24:21 thats understandable, thanks for the feedback
creations-chat 2022-11-23 20:41:49 FR 2 wide f14s in plane crazy are ALL the same
creations-chat 2022-11-23 20:45:37 the fact that my f18 got a significantly worse downvote to upvote ratio than my donkeycopter says a lot about this server
creations-chat 2022-11-23 20:47:47 darknetwhite try not to screenshot or record your build with shaders challenge <:nooo:787097964946259978>
creations-chat 2022-11-23 22:03:01 i mean it has some issues like the bland livery, exposed motors, and lazy ass canopy
creations-chat 2022-11-23 22:06:26 oh i thought you were being sarcastic and trying to say that its really good but has shaders which is far from true, only thing i like is that he put the effort into angling the landing gears
everything else i agree with you on
also its one wide Lol
oh yeah

contest-chat 2022-11-27 17:46:04 LOL THATS MY F15 TUTORIAL
contest-chat 2022-11-27 17:46:38 yeah i know how that feels
contest-chat 2022-11-27 17:46:44 pain crazy 😭
contest-chat 2022-11-27 17:47:11 i mean honestly if you wouldnt have told us nobody would have known and you could probably get away with it
contest-chat 2022-11-27 17:48:43 💪
contest-chat 2022-11-27 18:00:09 yeah they obviously did like 75% of the tutorial and then they were just like "fuck it" and did the rest themselves
events-chat 2022-11-28 01:26:55 hi Mods can we do a
events-chat 2022-11-28 01:26:57 crab game event
events-chat 2022-11-28 01:27:04 sometime in december
events-chat 2022-11-28 01:27:14 pretty pleas 🥺
events-chat 2022-11-28 01:27:54 game has been dead for like a year but its still a good game and deserved more than a month of fame
events-chat 2022-11-28 01:28:06 is the big Fun
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:35:18 the pavehawk is really good
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:35:21 will probably get like 2nd place
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:35:28 maybe 1st if the other submissions are all mid or bad
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:35:37 but i think it like
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:35:47 ties with artyom's spaceship thingy
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:36:26 this kind of hurts to see because that sharp edge could be easily fixed with a half triangle wedge down
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:36:49 thats just being nitpicky though
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:37:24 this too
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:37:37 barely even noticable, thats just nitpicking dude
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:37:53 literally and
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:38:01 what do you expect its roscale
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:38:04 the game is
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:38:05 extremely
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:38:06 limited
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:38:22 there probably isnt really anything he could do about that without piston locking it
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:38:27 which causes lag
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:38:41 and he might not be able to fit a piston without it sticking out
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:38:45 theres probably a reason it looks like that
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:38:54 not everything can be reasonably done
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:42:21 the nose on this one is better Lol
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:42:27 i meant the top one
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:42:28 Lol
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:45:18 it looks like you could put a half triangle wedge down there
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:45:20 but alrigh
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:45:44 idk what to do for the contest the deadline is closing in and i was gonna make a ch-53 but i couldn't do the stinking nose
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:46:01 now i'm thinking i might make like a blackhawk or an apache or a cobra or something
contest-chat 2022-11-30 04:46:07 but i don't feel motivated
contest-chat 2022-11-30 14:02:32 barney baby ❤️
contest-chat 2022-11-30 14:03:42 can you make an exception for the one guy who made a badass apache like 2 days before the contest started
contest-chat 2022-11-30 14:04:01 i feel bad for SR Lol
contest-chat 2022-11-30 17:14:14 i make ch-53k king stallion
contest-chat 2022-11-30 17:14:27 i doubt i'll be able to finish by the contest deadline but i'm going to try
contest-chat 2022-11-30 17:14:49 100% not going to get in the top 3 winners though
contest-chat 2022-11-30 17:18:51 even if i dont finish in time for the contest or if it's too mid to make it to the top 3 winners i still need another build to showcase on my channel
contest-chat 2022-11-30 17:19:29 i didnt go full tryhard mode on the exterior because i want to have a cool interior btw

contest-chat 2022-12-04 14:56:32 right because block is 0.7 meter
contest-chat 2022-12-04 15:00:09 around 2.2 feet but for the sake of detail and interior and sh its easiest to round up to 2.25 feet
contest-chat 2022-12-04 15:00:21 or thats just what i do at least
contest-chat 2022-12-04 15:06:42 bro just drops in and casually sends it 3 months later

contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:21:11 not justneut 💀
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:21:37 dude downvotes all my builds when this is his latest build
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:21:40 💀
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:22:10 FR
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:22:24 like theres nothing wrong with downvoting a build if you dont like it
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:22:36 but when you're downvoting all the good builds and upvoting all the shitty ones that are on your level
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:22:41 you are literally
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:22:45 bringing the noobs up
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:22:51 and pushing the good people down
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:23:00 therefore worsening the quality of the builds in creations
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:23:15 then thats stupid
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:23:26 downvote a build if you dont like it not because its good
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:23:42 if you think a build is good then legit upvote it not the opposite
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:25:30 bro this aint even bad its just 1 block wide
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:25:54 has a couple of exposed motors but its not bad its just not that great either
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:26:03 like it looks like it could be a namnam jet
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:26:15 so its just yknow mid but its nothing to argue over lol
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:26:21 like he probably couldnt even make that
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:35:43 OH MY GOD THERE WAS A PISTON LOCK FAIL AND I DIDNT REALIZE IT
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:35:48 im going to Die
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:35:54 😭
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:36:06 ok guys just pretend the window isnt too wide
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:36:37 luckily the other side is fine so the picture of the other angle was okay
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:36:41 but that one is way more noticable
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:37:43 morfix
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:37:49 im in the lead rn because my builds at the bottom
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:37:53 but his is gonna pull through
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:38:02 and probably barely beat mine
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:38:16 i mean i hope that isnt the case
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:38:22 but it prob is
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:38:25 king stallion
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:38:36 similar name though
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:38:38 and similar role
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:39:02 actually the nose is pretty similar on the sea king
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:39:07 fr
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:40:15 theres actually a variant of the ch-53 called the mh-53 sea dragon so
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:40:27 if someone called it that i wouldn't be too disappointed
contest-chat 2022-12-07 02:40:42 i Love sea helocopte
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:41:43 you probably felt so cool drifting through the air in that thing with the ninjago music
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:43:43 fr
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:43:51 rbk approves
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:44:05 so like
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:44:10 how fun is it to fly that thing around
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:44:12 it looks really fun
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:44:31 definitely nothing like flying a big fat laggy ch-53 that can barely fly
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:44:45 m:
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:45:10 then its unstable and wants to flip over Lol
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:45:16 rotors smh
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:45:28 helicopter physics are ASS in plane crazy
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:46:00 like it make no sense that the more you angle the blades the more it wants to flip over
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:46:03 but that is the case
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:46:11 which is why so many people use fake or semi fake rotors
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:46:21 good advice
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:47:30 damn bro's bringing actual real life physics into the game
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:47:35 that's actually a reasonable explanation though
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:47:57 every helicopter i've made does that
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:48:03 unless it's not accelerating lol
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:49:21 you so would have gotten into the top 3 with that 😩
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:49:32 probably the best 1 wide apache
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:49:39 ofc assuming you add detail
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:49:53 i dont know why i said 1 wide Lol
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:50:21 i thought the canopy was 1 wide but then i looked closer
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:50:23 and realized
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:50:24 it is Not
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:50:38 how tf did you
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:51:30 yeah that one part
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:51:35 yeah fr
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:51:59 then you're Screwed
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:53:31 yo what thats sick how they do that

contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:53:59 btw uh
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:54:06 whats the shortcut for that
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:54:08 unicode
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:54:11 sotgiswg
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:54:24 you can do keypad shortcuts for unicode
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:54:32 i never do it because im small brained
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:54:39 but im just curious how you got that so fast
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:54:45 so i assumed you did keyboard shortcut
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:54:51 rather than looking it up
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:55:34 ok then you have a fast computer because that would have  taken me about 10 seconds
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:55:43 took you about 4 or 5
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:55:49 what am i Doing

contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:57:06 i have it bookmarked
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:57:12 if theres something i need that isnt here i just look it up
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:57:15 like "star unicode"
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:57:21 for airforce logo
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:57:25 or halfass airforce logo at least lol

contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:58:51 oh i know how to fix tag mode
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:58:53 for most of them
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:59:00 just put "bruh fr" or "dude what" after it
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:59:02 or some random sh
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:59:05 but those usually work
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:59:16 and then just size up text so the "bruh fr" goes out of the box
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:59:35 works like 75% of the time for tagged symbols
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:59:42 you prob already know though
contest-chat 2022-12-07 03:59:53 yeah fr

contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:22:50 i mean to be honest
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:22:57 just do what you feel like
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:23:13 it doesnt really matter when you finish a build unless you have a deadline or people waiting on you
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:23:17 like contest or youtube channel
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:23:31 on Galapgos
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:23:44 but if you want to finish it for your own sake but you cant find the motivation
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:24:07 just try to sit down, put on some music, particularly energizing music, and build
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:24:17 and just focus on one part at a time
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:24:36 and you'll soon just find yourself building without thinking about if you're motivated or not
contest-chat 2022-12-07 16:24:39 On goose

creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:32:45 its honestly hilarious
i feel kind of bad for getting him warned but i think he should maybe learn a lesson that he shouldnt copy other peoples stuff and put it in creations
creations-chat 2022-12-25 04:41:14 its really good but i think it could use a little more detail and maybe some color variation or something
creations-chat 2023-01-27 05:23:39 is this guy serious <:skull4k:937411433891782726>

creations-chat 2023-03-01 15:20:50 😍 GUAU
creations-chat 2023-03-01 15:30:13 💀
creations-chat 2023-03-01 17:21:35 first of all
i said that because hes obviously joking
second of all, have you seen your builds 💀 i always see you downvoting everyones builds even the really good ones when literally all your builds are dogshit
creations-chat 2023-03-01 17:24:19 yeah sorry bro fr
creations-chat 2023-03-01 18:37:12 note: a lot of the builds you downvoted werent necessarily great, but still leagues ahead of what you are capable of doing -- that being said, a lot of the ones you downvote are still good
edit: i have more, gonna post when the cooldown ends

creations-chat 2023-03-01 18:47:33 i know but it just seems hypocritical to downvote good builds when you're actual dogshit at the game and couldn't make something even half as good, i don't usually like the "if you can't do better then don't criticize it" argument but you're just such a hypocrite lol

like by your logic you should be downvoting your own builds cause they're ASS, and yes i see the one you just sent, that is garbage too

edit: WHAT 😭
creations-chat 2023-03-01 18:54:26 bro just face the facts the SU-57 is ASS, like if i had the same amount of education, budget, and team size as the people that designed the SU-57 did, i could definitely do something better and anyone could

also its true that most 1 wides suck but downvoting every single 1 wide even if its pretty good for a 1 wide is dumb
creations-chat 2023-03-01 19:19:50 god damn justneut out of all people finally said something that isnt insane

creations-chat 2023-03-01 23:03:20 bro why are people even discussing this, solee's airliner looks like it's from 2020, enough said
creations-chat 2023-03-01 23:05:25 BRO HE HAS MEATRIDERS WHAT 😭 the scottybrother effect.
does it have really mechanically complex landing gears or a decked out interior or something because it literally looks like every airliner from 2020
like it's not horrid but it's surely not good either
creations-chat 2023-03-02 16:31:54 how could he mix them up they look so extremely different 😭

creations-chat 2023-03-02 16:40:44 why are you booing me im Right
creations-chat 2023-03-02 16:43:06 i appear to have been deceived by its introduction date..
creations-chat 2023-03-02 16:45:07 look i dont understand how the generation classification bullshit works okay i just saw that first generation is 1940s, second gen is 1950s, third gen is 1960s, fourth gen is 1970s, and fifth gen is 2000s and went by that information not knowing there was anything more to it
do not Kill me
creations-chat 2023-03-02 16:56:03 ok so its not about the decade they enter service but the decade they were developed in? then why isn't the f-14 considered a third gen by that logic
creations-chat 2023-03-02 16:58:07 you will Never be as good as scottyboo ❌🧢 🗣️
creations-chat 2023-03-02 19:25:09 thanks i know that now
creations-chat 2023-03-02 21:00:14 it's acceptable but i've seen much better, if you can try to use angle lock to make the canopy look smoother, i'm talking about both how the place where the canopy meets the fuselage looks sloppy from the side and how the wedges look sharp and unsmooth
creations-chat 2023-03-02 21:46:06 a lot better than it was before

creations-chat 2023-03-09 15:37:26 well it probably was actually well built even if it was cringe af
this one kind of just sucked on top of being cringey
creations-chat 2023-03-09 15:45:46 because it's an anime girl in plane crazy do i really have to explain this 😭
creations-chat 2023-03-15 16:25:10 damn bro didn't know the f-35 was a helicopter
also from what i've seen in the creations channel your helicopters are ASS
creations-chat 2023-03-15 16:27:33 Hars
creations-chat 2023-03-16 15:56:54 same bruh i got so disapointed
creations-chat 2023-03-16 17:59:55 yes it would be deserving of at least 50 downvotes
creations-chat 2023-03-16 18:02:56 yes even if there wasnt exposed motor lock it would still be deserving of at least 50 downvotes, you asked a question and i answered it
it has a wooden texture for some reason which looks weird, the wedge work could be massively improved, there's no detail, and the proportions are wack
creations-chat 2023-03-17 00:28:56 it looks literally exactly the same except the new one has worse colors
creations-chat 2023-03-17 01:00:02 motor
creations-chat 2023-03-17 01:41:40 motor lock it in
(motors dont have collision)
creations-chat 2023-03-17 15:33:56 typical white name ego
creations-chat 2023-03-18 15:23:22 <@297120728342331392> i just wanna talk. I just want to talk. I JUST WANT TO TALK
creations-chat 2023-03-18 15:35:11 that man is a fucking beast, i met him once, that was an encounter that... crashed my computer <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
creations-chat 2023-03-18 15:37:15 put a half triangle wedge on top of the glass, then motor lock a half wedge down pointing in the same direction into the wedge next to it, i always do that on my airliners and cargo planes and it helps a lot, especially when looking at it from a bird's eye view
creations-chat 2023-03-18 15:40:35 and if that's hard to understand, here's kind of a visual representation of what i said
creations-chat 2023-03-18 15:42:43 under cabin thing what <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
also refer to the image i sent since you don't understand it in words
creations-chat 2023-03-18 15:44:45 what are you talking about the cockpit? because i kind of suck at cockpits myself so idk if i can help with that
creations-chat 2023-03-18 16:44:36 1 wide with exposed lock and no detail <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2023-03-18 16:47:19 imma be honest i actually really like this, not because its technically good because its definitely not, but that's where the charm is
it reminds me of back when i used to not get sucked in to trying to make my builds look as good as i could and takes me back to a simpler, more fun time
no it isn't a very good build but it has charm and it looks fun, you should keep it
creations-chat 2023-03-18 16:55:27 keep practicing and you'll get better at building, but just remember to play the game for fun, that's the most important thing
also if you're new to plane crazy that's actually pretty good for someone starting out because even though it isn't that good, it looks clean
idk how long you've been playing but if that's true you're on the right path
creations-chat 2023-03-18 16:57:55 i don't usually do that i'm typically an asshole in this server but something about that plane touched me deep inside
like you can literally see that 2 minutes earlier i made fun of a jaguar for having exposed lock lol
i think i'm gonna try to start being more supportive and less critical because lord knows this server could use more positivity
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:00:48 i know i know i dont know what it is but it just reminded me of my first few months playing plane crazy and how fun they were thats all
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:03:02 hi vip long time no see
quick question do you remember who you learned motor locking from or did you figure it out yourself
because i remember you showed it to me at like the beginning of 2020 at least half a year before it started catching on
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:07:29 i remember before motor lock we had to use this old piston locking method, which ironically was also taught to me by vipempire, it was most useful for closing the gap between rocket stages
pre motor lock plane crazy was a different world, it's like before motor lock was BC
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:12:10 bro really just accidentally discovered motor lock
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:15:30 i think i found the exact moment it started catching on
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:17:38 <:stuff:908917207986208828>
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:27:23 dude what that's actually decent 💀 its not perfect but with a little tweaking it could be great
so the nose is a little bit too long, try making the nose a block shorter
also try making the back of the canopy about a block longer
and maybe try working on the colors because they look a bit too vibrant and harsh, almost like default colors (pretty much never use default colors)
and then obviously when you finish you can add some weathering and details like text and stuff, but you've got a solid base

(and what i mean by making the back of the canopy longer is adding a custom angle that's 3 blocks long to the back of it and make it glass material)
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:29:59 what? i dont think you would, you'd just probably have to turn the half wedge down 1x2 on the nose into a normal half wedge down and make the lock angle on the nose 2 blocks long so that it'd be the same length as a half wedge up 1x2
creations-chat 2023-03-19 14:26:35 honestly those shaders look kind of crap, it looks better without shaders
creations-chat 2023-03-19 14:30:44 fyi: the bloom on the shaders are way too high and so are the contrast, vibrance, and reflections
all of these things make it hurt to look at and are generally not aesthetically pleasing; if this is your taste and you like it, then cool, but you did ask for our opinions and this is mine, so take it into consideration
also on a sidenote, 4 hours isnt really much in plane crazy, most good builds take several days of consistent work, perhaps even a few weeks

creations-chat 2023-03-27 19:58:35 your taste is Ass 🔥🔥
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:00:38 Can confirm
<@584060481522761728> you just aren't ready to handle the neutron style
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:02:51 nah bro you just can't handle the builderman grindset 🗣️🔥
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:05:12 no he was saying he prefers eskeline's one which is absolutely hilarious
also HALL OF FAME MY ASS <@726032176340009052>
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:07:22 nah you just cant comprehend the legend of the donkey helicopter <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:09:32 so let me get this straight, you think the picture on the left is BETTER than the picture on the RIGHT (bear in mind the one on the right is folded, maybe <@567763933952475157> will let us get a better look at it soon 🙏)
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:11:39 now i understand why you have "monkey" in your name, bro literally has a monkey brain, none of you eskeline meatriders know wtf a joke is holy shit
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:14:05 DAMN THAT EGO GOES WILD 🗣️
i am so sorry lord eskeline please forgive me for my sins your building skills are unmatched in this server 🙏
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:19:19 so true i am so sorry Lord Eskeline please let me make it up to you i will send you fingernail pics just anything..!!1! <:squam:801278498156183562>
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:23:18 not mine, it belongs to <@567763933952475157>, unless of course you're talking about the heap of shit on the left which belongs to <@584060481522761728>
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:26:12 kindergarten level insults fr
also you say that about him not being able to finish it because you'll never know what it's like to actually put time and effort into a build <:squam:801278498156183562>
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:28:16 expert designer is the highest rank you have you legit cannot diss him for that 🧠
also he may have an anime pfp but he's proved himself to have 10x the amount of common sense that you and your little brother Harry have just by two messages
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:30:24 HARRY DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIRE dumbledore said calmly
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:35:32 lmfao we could make a play, someone call up shakespeare 🔊
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:37:36 you're not gonna wanna hear this but me and jeff are both contest winners, which means that we have a say in which builds go into the hall of fame <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
(and not to sound egotistical, but this also means that we have proved to have building skills good enough to win a contest, so you and your goofy little twin tailed plane cant really be saying shit)
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:40:47 better, right, let's see him win a contest or post literally any build that gets over 200 upvotes
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:43:13 and that is a great compliment to me because jeff's ship is really good so far, the issue here is that you think that eskeline is some god at plane crazy which is delusional (and i get it, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but come on man)
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:45:53 admittedly i'm not the best builder and i don't build very often, but you gotta keep in mind that i was banned in this server for over a year until i was unbanned in september, which means that an entire surplus of a year's worth of my builds didn't get posted
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:48:04 actually it's a legacy hornet 🤓 but i appreciate the compliment even though i wasn't very happy with how it turned out
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:53:12 you dont understand that builds with tons of motor lock angling and piston lock are difficult to spawn in, especially when you factor in the lag caused by these builds and the glitching of motors
of course your builds are easy to spawn in because they're tiny, have no detail, and are probably like 150 blocks as opposed to jeff's build which is unfinished and already probably over 2000 blocks
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:55:25 damn that improvement CRAZY 🔥
my compliments to your drive 👏
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:57:27 i know how it is brother, its tough 😔 especially having a budget lenovo laptop that runs the game at 15-20 fps when i spawn in a build with a lot of piston lock
creations-chat 2023-03-27 20:59:32 get good? my brother in allah, getting good in this game IS using techniques like angle locking, folding, and piston lock
if you keep playing the game and improving for a few years like we have you'll understand, but hopefully you won't waste 4 years of your life on a roblox game like i did
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:01:35 in a year im projected to have enough money from youtube to get myself an MSI sword with an RTX 3060, 1 TB SSD, an i7 processor, and 16 GB ram which are all pretty mid-level specs so i'll finally be able to do other things than just roblox videos and finish videos faster because davinci resolve won't be running at 5 fps <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:12:16 yeah one that can handle literally anything that isnt roblox or minecraft
having a decent computer opens the doors for so many things
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:15:37 bro REALLY trynna put down GAMESLAYER

creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:20:20 your new project must be pretty wild then, could you be as kind as to show us a picture because that kind of improvement that fast is unprecedented

creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:26:52 ah yes he got his priorities right simping over a 12 year old that doesnt understand jokes and isnt very good at building in a discord server for an online lego game 🔥
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:29:21 oh my shiver me timbers! You truly are better than everyone in this chat combined wow!! I am so sorry harry please forgive me and my homies 🙏 nah bruh that's almost just as bad as your previous plane, i'm not a very good builder but sorry buddy you ain't better than me yet, keep practicing

creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:35:54 bro think he superman without the super 🤣
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:37:57 absolute DUMBASS 🔥 you're using "you're" incorrectly, in this context "your" was 100% correct ❌🧢
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:40:00 common joman w, i would expect nothing less from the representative of the plane crazy community
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:42:04 my man why you keep using the word "captivated" incorrectly, just listen to joman and redeem yourself by turning to the sacred Holy Jomanism
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:46:18 dude you talk the talk but can you walk the walk? at this point i'm scared for you, have you seen what joman is capable of? he bypassed the closure of <#384025409945337856>, one day he's gonna punish you for your sins and you will be sorry
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:49:20 tech, tell him, joman's wrath is real shit
<@584060481522761728>, i used to not believe in joman either, until i truly experienced his might, now i am a faithful Jomanian and you should become one too

<@584060481522761728>  my recommendation for you is to check out Joman's powerful speech during the great creations channel famine
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:53:55 oh shit dude you okay?
creations-chat 2023-03-27 21:57:21 he's not mocking a tragedy he literally just built an aircraft that holds historical significance
i will say it is horseshit but he's still not mocking a tragedy <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:00:11 i know what kamikaze is dude i'm just saying him building a suicide bomber from WWII isn't mocking what happened, you must have horseshit for brains 👍
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:02:21 that isn't mocking the event silly that's just adding details that make it more historically accurate, have you ever been to an airshow or a WWII museum?
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:04:29 goodbye king joman 👋
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:06:34 please learn the difference between "You're" and "Your" you're making an ass of yourself (although i don't blame you because they don't teach that in kindergarten)
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:08:43 no it started way before that, eskeline was basically just being egotistical and had some little meatrider sidekick bullying people and saying eskeline was better than people who are actually objectively much better at the game than he is
i have a $500 laptop and i was just saying that i was gonna buy a better one when i got enough money from youtube and he tried to make it seem like that's an unreasonable decision
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:11:54 when your comment gets deleted in creations chat and you have to wait 2 minutes to post again <:empty:794431705070174238>
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:14:01 yeah at least he understood what a joke was, he was just way too obsessed with eskeline for some reason
creations-chat 2023-03-27 22:20:17 caught you downvoting a joman build once

i can tell you're 11 years old and use proper grammar to make yourself seem smarter when instead, it makes you look like a fool
i know because me and many others did the exact same thing at that age

creations-chat 2023-04-01 15:28:33 it'd probably have 300 upvotes and 13 downvotes if it was fully finished and fully detailed, unfinished builds never do well because... well they aren't finished, but as a start it's probably already one of the best fronts of an f15 in plane crazy
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:56:34 aint no way you actually tried
creations-chat 2023-04-01 23:44:44 they use pistons to extend parts of the build

honestly it's a good build but it is not deserving of HOF, i only upvoted it because we need a new hof build and the hof standards need to be somewhat reachable
creations-chat 2023-04-11 20:35:52 nah bruh you crazy felon got cool camo but it still ugly af because of the goofy ass proportions

creations-chat 2023-04-12 13:52:12 for decent builds real criticism is very helpful but when there's just too many problems with the build to count and it just looks ugly as hell there isn't a whole lot you can say besides "it looks like shit" because going into everything that's wrong with it would take a school essay's worth of words
creations-chat 2023-04-12 14:11:23 this your f18? 💀
I'll take slow laggy f18 that looks decent over a fucking 1 wide goofy ass mf with shaders
creations-chat 2023-04-12 14:14:41 true, however, im lazy as fuck so i dont work on my builds that much so the actual time i spent building was probably like 12 hours
(i am still a slow builder)

creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:06:45 delete All of your ships
nahh who tf puts LGBTQ flags on their builds 💀
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:09:16 his ships arent too bad its just he keeps posting the same shit and putting LGBT flags all over his ships (for literally no reason)
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:11:33 yeah exactly
that and the fact that he keeps posting the same ships over and over with 240p videos from the roblox launcher is also annoying
but like i dont have anything against LGBTQ people its just putting that shit everywhere and in places it doesnt belong is kind of annoying
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:13:38 nah bruh it's like if i put an american flag on a japanese ship that'd just be stupid af, it has nothing to do with the build and it's just cringe 🗿
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:16:54 ok ig you're right
creations-chat 2023-04-28 14:18:58 okay maybe the colors on a flag do matter <:empty:794431705070174238>

creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:00:23 see you thought he was defending you but hes just toxic to everyone besides the 9 year olds that simp for him for no reason <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152> hopefully you can see why nobody likes eskeline now
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:04:21 nah bruh lookin through your message history in creations chat and you basically just argue with anyone and everyone in here
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:06:33 <:Upvote:490311647492309004>
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:12:37 i actually agree with this, like i dont care if you like men or women or trans people or nonbinary people its just kind of been shoved in everyones faces for years and im a little bit tired of it
like i know this is different because of historical context but what if i went around everywhere advertising that im straight for no reason and putting straight flags all over my stuff and being like "im straight and im proud" people would be like "ok??" and they'd rightfully be annoyed probably
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:15:13 to be fair eskeline didnt start this one he just joined in with some bad takes, it started with themorfix telling fonnefox to delete his ship and then i joined in and made the argument bigger so this ones actually on me lol im sorry guys
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:20:26 <@407347404858458123>'s builds in a nutshell
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:25:50 agreed
like it's not that big of a deal but it's still a bit obnoxious and cringe
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:28:12 i just realized that the texas flag is like 1/3 polish flag
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:30:21 ok literally when did he say that 💀
this isn't the same thing as that, it's just most people aren't that loud and obnoxious about their segtuality, doesn't mean you have to stay in the closet and never talk about it and be ashamed of it, he's just saying the nonbinary and trans flags on your ships are extremely irrelevant to the build and come across as obnoxious because of that
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:32:24 good point, i just wanted to voice my opinion and that started an argument that i haven't backed out of yet because it's entertaining Lol
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:35:27 you don't have to incorporate flags that represent your segtuality into all of your builds like a watermark so that people know people like you play the game though 💀 it's a building game segtual diversity literally doesn't matter, i just don't understand why so many people are so loud and obnoxious about their beliefs
and this doesn't just go for the LGBTQ community either, it goes for a lot of things, that's just one of the big examples
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:37:29 think about this, do i have to put texas flags all over my builds to let people know that texans play plane crazy? no, most people dont even think about whether or not texans play plane crazy, and to be frank it doesn't matter in the slightest
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:39:34 so anyways keep doing it if it makes you happy, that's just my opinion about it
that's all i have to say on the matter
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:41:37 bro just because creations isnt filled with LGBTQ flags doesnt mean that LGBTQ people arent allowed to post their plane crazy builds 🗿nobody cares about your segtuality, it just doesn't have anything to do with the game
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:46:40 that makes a lot more sense than what you said earlier, again keep doing it if it makes you feel represented, it's just your earlier reasoning was kind of wack
and yeah people are still gonna think it's obnoxious and that won't change but you don't have to stop if you're willing to deal with the criticism and harassment (and it's kind of sad that that's how it is, but most people think it's cringey to plaster something that irrelevant to the game on your builds)
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:51:55 alright well i guess you can call being tired of having LGBTQ material shoved down your throat in places it doesn't have any relevance to "homophobia/transphobia"
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:54:20 W response
creations-chat 2023-04-28 15:56:34 what? dawg your point don't even make any sense, the nonbinary and trans flags are literally pride flags and that's a fact not an opinion
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:00:14 yeah that's how eskeline is
i think i'm just going to remove myself from this argument because it's become redundant and you've made some decent points
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:03:26 This isn't a moai W I'm not even surrendering to you 🗿
You're not even a part of the argument you just said a few stupid things directed at me that didn't make any sense and called it a W
creations-chat 2023-04-28 16:06:21 i love how everyone just collectively agrees that eskeline is braindead and instigates conflicts for no reason with points that make zero sense

its true that a lot of whitenames stink at the game or are undes but i dont make hating whitenames and using the trollface emoji my whole personality, unlike eskeline (he literally has like two designer ranks when he isnt even that good at building and thinks that somehow makes him entitled to shitting on whitenames)
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:00:30 i feel you, i joined the server in 2019 and got banned in may 2021 but they gave me another chance in august 2022 so it says i joined in august <:nooo:787097964946259978>

creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:09:32 my brother in christ, you have been slandering whitenames for 20 minutes and then you get called out for being bad and now you're whining and crying, just like the demographic you're bullying <:squam:801278498156183562>

im definitely no master builder myself but come on bro 💀
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:23:09 your build vs my build, your take is Ass
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:27:57 my upvote ratio is better, also that particular build doesnt have that many upvotes because it already won the contest so most people had already seen it
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:30:05 i dont usually do that but i had to do it for the front gear because there was literally no room in the front, incorporating the front landing gear was a tricky task and it wouldnt have been possible had i not used text without sacrificing the avionics and interior
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:34:15 joke build, come on bro you know better that's hitting below the belt
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:36:42 there was a huge argument because he claimed that THIS was better than this (this mf's delusionality and ego is insane)
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:42:46 peak pcc pettiness
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:44:52 window frames, still dont use legacy glass for that
if you feel the need to include window frames, then use angled trails or delta wing panels if you have to
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:46:58 i feel like that perfectly describes eskeline, chaotic neutral
hes just an ass to everyone but his arguments have no real value so he doesnt actually choose sides he just insults the people he doesnt like even if it isnt relevant to the argument
creations-chat 2023-04-29 15:49:17 because he sucks, hes hypocritical, hes bad at building yet he acts like hes the best builder in the world, his arguments are bad and have no real value, and he makes shitting on whitenames and using the troll emoji his entire personality

creations-chat 2023-04-30 03:40:15 damn bro she a baddie show more angles 😍
creations-chat 2023-04-30 03:42:17 pretty much every part of it is laughable, if you're a new player it's not a bad start so i congratulate you but you definitely have a lot of learning and practicing to do to catch up with the current standards
creations-chat 2023-04-30 03:49:28 man thats pretty detailed, i dont really play build a boat for treasure so thats impressive to me, but yeah dont worry about it just have fun and if you want your builds to start looking good then practice more and try to make them look more like the blueprints you look at
creations-chat 2023-04-30 14:27:34 something to keep in mind is that most seasoned jet builders add window frames to their canopies to make it look better and more accurate to the real aircraft, and if you intend to add window frames then you can't really make the canopy open which is a sacrifice most people are willing to make

(not to mention if the canopy has any angle lock at all you cant make it open)
creations-chat 2023-04-30 14:32:47 sounds like the worst decision you made because your builds look mid af Lol 
NVM the fact that your mechs can run is really cool and impressive i couldnt do that (still look mid though)
creations-chat 2023-04-30 17:22:58 dont know how to build? gam3 has had consistently good builds for years, always matching the plane crazy building standards and is a well respected member of the community
you are some punk ass whitename with an inflated ego because your mid ass mech is able to run (which is cool, but it still looks mid)
i Think he might know a little better than you

(ok after looking it does appear to be basically reposted but with a couple of improvements, which technically means that the old one was WIP which aren't allowed in creations, but i still like it and i don't tend to immediately start checking to see if a creation i like is a repost)
creations-chat 2023-05-01 14:29:59 👍
creations-chat 2023-05-01 14:32:08 LMAO bro thinks that you going brb for a moment is him winning the argument 💀
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:21:55 you literally just copied the fuselage of just rens's mig-21 and slapped crappy sweeping wings on it 💀
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:24:03 i like it it's not the best build i've ever seen but it's creative and refreshing and fun
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:26:10 okay my bad it definitely doesnt look identical but theres a lot of similarities and that would explain why the fuselage looks decent but the wings look terrible (not saying you copied it anymore though, upon further inspection the similarities are surface level and limited)
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:30:53 so for the inward part of the wing that doesnt rotate, the angle on the back is inaccurate and should look a little more like the way i drew on it, also the gap is a little bit too big
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:33:11 so upon closer inspection (again lol) your wings arent as awful as i initially thought they were compared to the blueprints, the su-22 is just really ugly (what i said before still holds up though)
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:35:36 if you can yeah, the back angle of the inward parts of the wings is inaccurate and the gap between the rotating part and inward part is a little bit too big, maybe change that from a 1x2 delta wing to a 1x1 delta wing
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:37:47 so basically try to make it look a little more like the red line i drew, also if you could find a way to hide the motor 2 on the wings that would improve it by a lot
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:46:39 it looks pretty good to me
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:49:55 maybe raise the seat up by a half block so you're not staring into a red wedge <@767464181938126849>
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:52:35 why do you care so much that it's like half a block overscale lol it's plane crazy true roscale for a literal go-kart would be unachievable
creations-chat 2023-05-01 17:57:49 you probably think that all jets should be 1 block wide <:squam:801278498156183562>
creations-chat 2023-05-02 17:27:36 i dont think so, they arent even the same scale and hexagon posted his 4 minutes later which isnt enough time to copy an entire plane

creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:24:47 okay while this is absolutely true...
It is kind of funny watching bad builds get roasted and seeing the uploader reciprocate in a comically immature way
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:27:02 well there's a difference between low effort builds and bad builds
most bad builds are most likely built by new users who arent good at the game yet, doesnt necessarily mean its low effort because they could have put hours into it
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:29:37 i've never been a great builder (there's always some goofy downside to my builds because i can't ever seem to get everything just right) but i've definitely been considered at least average due to my experience in the game, and as someone who has been playing since early 2019 i just got bored of plane crazy and sick of the bugs so yeah you're 100% correct
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:33:00 i think it's mostly because of That other thing <:trollface:775024642104229898> and the reposting
but your builds aren't bad
creations-chat 2023-05-04 19:35:42 me watching my 11 year old self joining plane crazy for the first time (i have wasted 4 years of my life on this broken game and have been continuing to make plane crazy videos purely out of obligation and demand for years)

you shouldn't be breaking the rules anyway
creations-chat 2023-05-05 00:15:22 💀
creations-chat 2023-05-05 04:30:33 it got dogged on because these are the standards (this is considered a slightly above average jet - built by <@1004207882784489472>)
creations-chat 2023-05-05 04:32:35 ok yeah i probably undersold it a bit maybe that wasn't the best example
creations-chat 2023-05-05 04:34:41 this is old but it was good for its time and now something like this would be considered an average jet (built by <@449992260516446208>)
but anyways yeah just keep practicing, and if you post your builds expect feedback because the standards for good builds are pretty high and if your build isn't good people are probably gonna roast the hell out of it here
creations-chat 2023-05-05 14:02:14 thats what makes it average, its not perfect but its still pretty good

creations-chat 2023-05-08 20:21:10 right but the average person who plays plane crazy has like an hour of playtime and 3 builds, when most people say average build they dont mean the average person who has joined plane crazy before, they mean the average person who frequently plays the game and has several decent builds
