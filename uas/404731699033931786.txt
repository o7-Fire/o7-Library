the-dump 2018-12-11 23:11:50 Chungus has no beginning. Chungus has no end. Chungus is infinite. Millions of years after our civilization has been eradicated and forgotten, Chungus will endure.
Chungus is eternal. The pinnacle of evolution and existance.
We are but rudimentary creatures of blood and flesh. We touch Chungus' mind, fumbling in ignorance, incapable of understanding.
Organic life is nothing but a genetic mutation, an accident. Our lives are measured in years and decades. We wither and die. Chungus is eternal. Before it, we are nothing.
Chungus imposes order on the chaos of organic life. We exist because Chungus allows it, and we will end because Chungus demands it.
Chungus transcends our very understanding. We cannot grasp the nature of Chungus' existence.

bug-reports 2021-07-09 13:53:34 I went into system settings and reset my pc, and did the full wipe thing that removes personal files and user preferences.

previously when I had done that on it's "smaller" setting which keeps your files and user preferences my rockets broke, they wouldn't fire if I was moving and instead would just dissapear.

help 2022-11-15 15:43:00 I need some help, my cutters aren't wokring on this trough-weapon I made to trail behind my aircraft, me and my friend tested the trough with blacklist enabled and it didn't cut shit at high and low speed.

I made another cutter that was on the ground and cut his vehichle just fine, so it's just an issue with this design/being in the air/being on ropes
help 2022-11-15 15:53:36 because it was a fun idea to take me out of my comfort zone
