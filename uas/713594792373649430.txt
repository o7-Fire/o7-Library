The Tale of Elemental_Collapse (713594792373649430)
help 2021-04-08 21:00:40 so i saw some huge creations in the hall of fame, and it kind of looks so huge it wasn't folded so how do people make mammoth builds, my only guess would be making it in another copy of the game and coded differently for infinite space
help 2021-04-08 21:16:12 the grand bringer, and that huge rocket site
help 2021-04-08 21:17:02 use a motor to make your wings horizontal in order to make then wider and longer
help 2021-04-08 21:20:43 i was talking about the base of the plane but there works as well if you add the motor and build vertically away from the base of the plane, then when launching you fold the first set of wings the the second set of wings
help 2021-04-08 21:24:09 yeah like that but i recommend taking the top bits off and then remaking the tips of the wings at the end of the second motor
help 2021-04-08 21:25:49 yeah

bot-central 2021-04-08 21:51:10 so only help wanted is a image early chat :/
help 2021-04-08 21:56:26 not exactly what i was picturing but that works, i was thinking it could be built going vertically opposite away from the plane and then when you launch to fold it you would be folding the first set of wings down and the second set of wings up

creations-chat 2021-04-08 23:54:49 so is that a no or a yes?
creations-chat 2021-04-08 23:57:23 a plane from wwII time also does a creation have to be huge in order to have any upvotes?
creations-chat 2021-04-09 00:00:03 i went a two whole days of non stop work in order to not just make the design of the plane but figure out how to make it fly, im pretty sure it has quality

it has a different paint color but it matches it
creations-chat 2021-04-09 00:11:05 okay what am i supposed to do then, go back in time to tell the Germans to stop making so many different random kinds of planes?
creations-chat 2021-04-09 00:14:07 i just looked up WWII planes im not exactly caring to know where it was made :/ anyway so the only way to have a creation make sense is if it exists?
creations-chat 2021-04-09 00:20:40 i cant tell if that is a helpfull tip or a insult but i guess ill start from scratch anyway , this was only my first huge build
any suggestions on what kind of plane i should recreate?
creations-chat 2021-04-09 00:23:30 not a fail if the linked worked as intended :/
creations-chat 2021-04-09 00:26:44 anyone got suggestions?
creations-chat 2021-04-09 00:39:16 this ?
creations-chat 2021-04-09 01:28:32 i said that because someone said after i submitted that "Bigger=better"
creations-chat 2021-04-09 01:31:29 here's the quote <@!720751430595772418>
creations-chat 2021-04-09 01:50:28 already notified of that :/
creations-chat 2021-04-09 22:03:38 fyi here is the front view
creations-chat 2021-04-09 22:06:54 <@!611251614178869269> weren't you the one who told me to make a Il 2
creations-chat 2021-04-09 22:16:29 i find it ironic how the people who suggested i make an Il 2 all down vote it without an explanation
creations-chat 2021-04-09 22:19:48 if they made a rounder blocks update where cylinders aren't the only block + a higher text size i could have made it so much better
creations-chat 2021-04-09 22:29:39 <@!611251614178869269> is this you?

creations-chat 2021-04-09 22:38:59 imagine making a roasting battle out of a downvote complaint
creations-chat 2021-04-09 22:43:30 what i find funny is that you think a computer bot has the power if being able to react to what your saying :/
creations-chat 2021-04-09 22:50:04 how was i supposed to knew he has an alt
creations-chat 2021-04-09 22:53:25 is that from the walking dead?
creations-chat 2021-04-09 23:02:41 fyi some builders with huge projects use alt accounts to make pieces of a huge project and link them together, look in hall of fame for the idea
creations-chat 2021-04-09 23:10:22 general please or maybe don't say it at all, this is a plane server not a match server
creations-chat 2021-04-09 23:19:01 <:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2021-04-10 16:34:48 <@!798331302238748673> you could take a pic of it with a better view and then edit the picture to make it look better, use this as an example
creations-chat 2021-04-10 17:10:04 why not
creations-chat 2021-04-10 17:31:41 <@!580713604320591873> if i could use more rounder blocks without it glitching the weight of the plane then id make it less flat
creations-chat 2021-04-10 18:14:43 the rules for this chat isn't pinged so how am i supposed to follow the rules that i had no idea existed
help 2021-04-11 12:45:28 where do you see your helium block count , do you have to take apart your creation in order to find it

creations-chat 2021-04-14 01:16:44 did this guy just lay out his plan in front of us on how to get an alt and then call us kids? <:what:644996672048463942>
creations-chat 2021-04-20 23:55:21 <@!699760678109708340> you should take a more zoomed out picture of it while in the air
creations-chat 2021-04-28 23:10:16 any prop ideas that i should put on the inside for decor, like a wire panel, more pipes or a maintenance locker, something to add to the technical vibe
creations-chat 2021-04-28 23:37:53 oh half of this channel is used to trash talk about most builds , your lucky you got "no" as an answer
though id recommend making the bottom half metal instead of glass
creations-chat 2021-04-29 01:54:31 is this a 'Zappelin'
