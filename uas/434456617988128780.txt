help 2023-04-15 16:41:43 Hello everybody, I've been trying to/thinking about making an aircraft carrier, in particular for me and one of my friends. I am having trouble with the carrying part of it, as the planes I intend to store are larger than I know how to fit into one plot (roughly a quarter of a plot each plane), so are there any tips or tricks I could use to make a larger build? I've been using folding but the hull was still too small, and I don't want to make a smaller plane so that they can use most any of their planes for it. Thank you in advance.
