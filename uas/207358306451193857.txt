help 2019-11-09 03:30:43 What are the basics of making a helicopter in this game?

help 2019-11-09 03:54:59 Could magnets be used for hovering?
help 2019-11-09 03:57:46 Im trying to use magnets to make this craft hover, but it doesn't seem to work. I tried both keys and also put strength on max, while enabling superstrength.
help 2019-11-16 22:07:29 Alright, so I'm trying to create this hovercraft thing using propellers. However, when I try to rotate the two propeller bits, it rotates the central component. How do I make it so that the propellers are rotated?

help 2020-02-09 08:02:31 The control surfaces for me are screwed up
help 2020-02-09 08:02:40 How do I fix them?
help 2020-02-09 08:05:08 Whenever I try to use automatic controls for my control surfaces they don't line up correctly and break (get jammed in one spot)
help 2020-02-09 08:05:23 I have to use pre-set controls which makes it far less agile
help 2020-02-09 08:09:38 Does anyone have a possible fix?
