bot-central 2021-10-09 18:33:26 I just want to get my shovel recognized because it’s my first build and it’s almost 6k blocks
bot-central 2021-10-09 18:33:36 It fully functions
bot-central 2021-10-09 18:33:41 And can drive and turn
bot-central 2021-10-09 18:34:01 Stripping shovel look it up

creations-chat 2021-10-09 19:18:14 Really
creations-chat 2021-10-09 19:21:55 Wow good to know, people hate my greatest build ever that I’ve worked on since may, just because they “don’t like the look of it”, I hope you know I spent hours a day into that and I have it at 5973 blocks due to the amount of internal components
creations-chat 2021-10-09 19:24:12 Doesn’t mean you have to post pics making fun of me I’d like to see you try and build it since your so high and mighty
creations-chat 2021-10-09 19:27:28 I’m blocking y’all now I don’t have to see your trash builds as well
creations-chat 2021-10-09 19:30:53 It’s flat because that’s how the machines were built, they were massive, they couldn’t have anything on the outside because they were electric
creations-chat 2021-10-09 19:34:20 
creations-chat 2021-10-09 19:43:40 Yeah now your being a bully and I don’t really like that, your one of those people who only care about what you build rather than what other people build, you judge people based on the color of their name, “oh he’s a white name, that means he’s bad” yeah don’t judge people before you even seen everything
creations-chat 2021-10-09 19:46:35 I have Asperger’s syndrome I can’t take criticism very well, I can’t take any info very well, that’s why I usually keep my builds to myself unless it’s with people that I know will like it
creations-chat 2021-10-09 20:09:07 Wdym explain
creations-chat 2021-10-09 20:12:26 I don’t,
creations-chat 2021-10-09 20:14:51 It’s actually rust the color brown isn’t just the color of your teeth m8
creations-chat 2021-10-09 20:18:47 It’s actually rust
creations-chat 2021-10-09 20:23:00 Ehh idc y’all probably call the truck what you eat for lunch everyday so I don’t care what you call it, because I’m not someone who criticizes stuff right off the bat, I don’t care how your builds look, so you literally don’t matter, like the more you say the less I care, eventually you won’t exist to me, your not don’t anything to me
creations-chat 2021-10-09 20:34:16 Yeah I get it I made a spelling mistake big deal anyways nice high hood locomotive
creations-chat 2021-10-09 20:38:03 Idk m8 the wings look a bit long but other than that it looks good so far
creations-chat 2021-10-09 20:43:29 Yeah now that I look more at it, that tail fin is rivaling the burj khalifa Jesus Christ
creations-chat 2021-10-09 21:05:17 Yeah I get it I made a mistake I was just exited thinking that mine was eligible but now I know I’m not allowed to like my own builds

creations-chat 2021-10-12 00:38:20 Yeeeeeeeaaaa
creations-chat 2021-10-12 01:01:21 Idk is it hard on mobile?
creations-chat 2021-10-12 01:35:12 Its modded meaning it goes against the vanilla rules
creations-chat 2021-10-12 02:52:54 It needs improvements, it’s decent but still, you’ll get it eventually, you just have to put your mind to it

events-chat 2022-05-14 18:03:43 Bet
events-chat 2022-05-14 18:04:02 I can do nightmare
events-chat 2022-05-14 18:04:33 Just gotta remove its ballast, which is basically its whole body
events-chat 2022-05-14 18:06:19 Nvm I ain’t screwing with that
events-chat 2022-05-14 18:35:59 Y’all think I have a chance at getting in and winning this event?
events-chat 2022-05-14 18:36:45 I submitted it already
events-chat 2022-05-14 18:37:12 …. Shit
events-chat 2022-05-14 18:37:29 So it’s too late to join
events-chat 2022-05-14 18:39:11 Is that a yes or no
events-chat 2022-05-15 22:21:03 You clearly don’t know the basics of spinner technology, first, you want the edges of your weapon the heaviest to deliver as much inertia as possible into the opponent, spinning faster doesn’t mean more power, the faster you spin, the less bite the weapon gets, the lighter the weapon, the less energy it delivers
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:23:30 The judge would reduce huge to rubble
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:23:52 The most powerful hammer so far in plane crazy
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:25:08 This was 1 hit from it on another bot
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:25:32 The spike hit the plot floor
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:26:29 
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:27:29 And no the body isn’t really low effort, it’s a real bot
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:29:10 Lemme see if I can get a video of its absolute carnage
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:34:59 By the time tombstone came around as a super heavyweight, the judge was already outdated, it was a bit outdated when it started even but, it still did well, managing to punch through thick steel
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:41:15 
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:42:14 That is the extra armor that tombstone used in 2004 for the NPC open charity event, the holes are the result of the judge, punching through the extra armor, and the normal armor
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:44:24 All y’all would’ve gotten your ass kicked if the rules weren’t so strict or if I had enough time to edit one of my bots
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:45:13 Weapon torque bullshit
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:45:31 Nope
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:45:51 I was gonna use nightmare
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:46:19 But it’s made of basically pure ballast
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:46:48 And the weapon speed limit hinders nightmare
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:47:27 Irl it had a 320mph disk, in game its tip speed is 2600,
events-chat 2022-05-15 23:48:24 I just did
creations-chat 2022-08-16 18:05:06 Nice truck
events-chat 2022-08-26 14:34:28

bug-reports 2022-11-03 01:15:49 Motors are stretchy
bug-reports 2022-11-03 01:15:55 They freak out now
bug-reports 2022-11-03 01:16:05 They are slower and have more random torque
bug-reports 2022-11-03 01:16:12 Physics bounces a lot now
bug-reports 2022-11-03 01:16:21 Ballast has barely any weight
bug-reports 2022-11-03 01:17:34 So what’s gonna be done about it
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:35:39 Lol motor torque of 10 or lower is fucking bullshit
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:35:57 How the fuck do y’all expect weapons to spin up and maintain speed without stopping when you move
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:36:15 A flipper cant flip someone with a motor torque of 5
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:37:30 Realism my ass
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:37:48 I’ve been into combat robotics for years and that’s the most unrealistic thing I’ve seen
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:38:08 Nightmare has a 60lb disk and it spins up to 320mph in 5 seconds
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:38:13 With 5 torque
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:38:22 It would take 40 seconds
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:38:28 To get to half speed
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:38:49 A drive motor with 10 torque will barely be able to move a heavy bot
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:39:03 A hammer with 5 torque can barely move its hammer
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:39:25 This is legit the shittiest tournament I’ve ever seen
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:39:46 Gonna be expecting weapons barely doing anything
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:39:51 Flippers not moving
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:39:55 Hammers not moving
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:39:58 And slow ass bots
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:40:46 No Larry
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:40:48 They don’t
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:40:54 Because the torque is so low
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:40:59 A shuffler won’t be able to move
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:44:48 I still wanna know how the fuck rbk expects these rules to work
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:45:01 Because I’m just baffled by how shitty they are
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:47:02 That doesn’t mean shit
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:53:33 Dudes spinning his weapon downward
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:53:43 Clearly new to combat robotics
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:53:56 But I won’t tell how that’s gonna fuck em over
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:54:07 I’ll let em figure it out
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:55:36 I’m confident that the judge would body 66% of the people in this event
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:55:41 But it can’t compete due to
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:55:44 TORQUE
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:55:45 LIMITS
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:56:37 Huge is stoppable
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:56:46 My friend beat him so rbk banned him
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:57:01 I’ve sliced bots in half before
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:57:17 I’ve 1 shotted bots OOTA
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:57:24 But I can’t do that due to
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:57:26 TORQUE
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:57:27 LIMITS
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:57:31 nope
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:57:37 Vertical spinner
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:57:56 There’s no horizontal flippers so why say vertical flipper
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:58:06 There’s only 1 way for a flipper to go and that’s up
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:59:03 *Doubt*
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:59:37 They were able to because of
events-chat 2022-11-12 16:59:44 LOW BALLAST
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:00:08 real plane crazy Battlebots tournaments have at least 50 ballast blocks
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:00:17 Depending on the weight class
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:00:24 Heavyweights is usually 40+
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:00:35 Middleweights are usually 25
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:00:41 Lightweights are usually 10
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:00:51 And super heavyweights are usually 80+
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:01:01 For a super heavyweight to move
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:01:09 The drive motors have to be maxed out
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:01:17 Otherwise you’ll have a slow ass bot
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:01:28 That does nothing but get stuck on the floor
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:01:42 And have a weapon that’s stops when it makes contact with the opponent
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:03:15 I’ve seen bots get tossed to orbit
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:06:46 That’s not allowed in irl Battlebots
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:06:57 That is known as
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:06:59 Bullshit
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:07:07 And I’m allergic to bullshit
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:07:40 If you wanna take out somebody’s weapon
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:07:45 Get a fucking wedge
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:07:50 Or if it’s a vert
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:07:54 Use a horizontal
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:08:12 If it’s a wedge
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:08:14 Use a vert
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:08:37 Hammers are gonna be useless in this because of the
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:08:45 TORQUE LIMITS
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:09:14 Irl hammers can use pneumatics
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:09:19 Which have all of the torque
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:09:24 All of the acceleration
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:51:09 Those are called hammer saws and they are a real weapon in combat robotics
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:51:30 My hammer stabs
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:52:03 Look up “the judge” Battlebots on google
events-chat 2022-11-12 17:52:30 It used a sharp hammer tip to poke holes in everything it sees
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:12:32 That’s why you have more BALLAST

For a more REALISTIC fight
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:14:30 https://tenor.com/view/clown-clown-meme-clown-makeup-clown-makeup-meme-gif-24590297
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:16:21 Don’t run a combat robotics tournament if you barely know Jack shit about combat robotics and implementing rules that do fuck all and make things shitty, I would compete, but your jack shit rules fuck the tournament
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:16:59 Oh then what is it
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:17:50 So you make it worse than realistic by making the weapon torque so low that flipper can barely even fire
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:18:07 Did it really work out?
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:18:16 Because you banned the last winner and claimed the prize
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:18:56 Lol and?
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:19:13 Then why say it
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:19:20 If you have something to say
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:19:24 Say it to my god damn face
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:19:33 Don’t be a coward
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:19:48 Then say it
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:20:03 Yeah whatever
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:20:20 Bruh I see y’all making drama 24/7
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:21:06 Quit condescending people and maybe I’d listen
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:21:57 Lol if it’s meant to be fun, then why limit fun
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:22:46 They don’t have power limits
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:22:58 Top fuel drag cars don’t go further because they fucking explode if they do
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:23:28 They have race classes with certain regulations yes
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:24:49 That would explode
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:25:00 It would
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:25:05 With this game’s physics
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:25:07 It will
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:25:26 Bold of you to say
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:25:29 If you want tire pressure
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:25:38 Change the damn material
events-chat 2022-11-12 20:25:46 Different pressure = different traction
