creations-chat 2022-11-09 23:06:12 it’s nice but i’d suggest trying to make it so the seat doesn’t pop out of the top like that
creations-chat 2023-01-16 15:36:49 they ruined the meme by spamming it in the comments instead of using the comment chain
creations-chat 2023-01-16 15:39:04 wait what new instructions 🤔

creations-chat 2023-02-04 19:49:25 why tf are so many people downvoting this

you guys just gonna ignore the fact that i told you to put criticisms here?
creations-chat 2023-02-04 20:04:06 2. i’ll try working on that
3. that’s the seat, might try hiding it later
4. will also work on that
5. i’ll add some sort of livery later

creations-chat 2023-03-05 02:50:56 anyone know how to make a good tail for a bae hawk
creations-chat 2023-03-18 11:38:08 how tf do you even do that layering thing with the blueprint and the actual build
creations-chat 2023-03-18 11:40:19 any alternatives to ibispaint
creations-chat 2023-03-18 16:04:39 what else should i do to this jaguar (yes i know exposed motorlock = bad!!! <:nooo:787097964946259978><:nooo:787097964946259978>)

creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:22:30 augh
creations-chat 2023-03-18 17:24:43 yeah i might try adding more detail on my other stuff
help 2023-03-24 21:52:20 idk
help 2023-03-24 21:52:30 sometimes it’s just needed though
help 2023-03-24 21:52:39 like on an f-22 for example
help 2023-03-24 21:54:03 probably because most people use the guide as a tutorial instead of applying one of the elements from it to some of their own original jets
creations-chat 2023-03-27 02:39:03 mainly the tail

the rest looks somewhat fine, it's just all the exposed and uncolored motors in the tail that's the main problem
creations-chat 2023-03-27 02:41:09 tbh yeah it doesn't really look too much like an f-16 body now that i think about it

creations-chat 2023-04-01 15:26:47 true
creations-chat 2023-04-01 15:28:51 plus most jet noses are nearly 5 feet wide at the widest point so it’d make sense for jets like the f-15 and others to be 2-wide
help 2023-04-01 17:57:03 you pretty much committed one of the worst sins imaginable in pcc
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:29:39 idk but it might be because most people make them 1 block wide
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:31:45 there’s some exceptions where you can get away with that tho, such as the spitfire, the fuselage is pretty much near 1 block since it’s about 2.5 feet wide
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:35:19 if we’re counting feet even though you explicitly stated studs then it’s 2.5 feet (assuming a roblox character would be 5 feet tall)
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:37:21 i think i read that 1 foot was like .92 studs so close i guess?
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:39:28 yeah but tbh it felt like roblox was on drugs when they made that definition (it’d make a roblox char like 5-6 **inches** tall if you applied that definition)
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:41:58 no i mean like if you assume a roblox character is 5 studs tall, that would make the character 5-6 inches tall which to me (and probably everyone else) is pretty weird
creations-chat 2023-04-01 21:44:41 yeah but even then that’s still goofy

creations-chat 2023-04-16 13:46:10 <@950319063970754560> why tf would you post your avatar freefalling (and nothing else) in <#384025409945337856>
help 2023-04-22 01:31:28 would 1 or 2 wide work better for a tornado nose
help 2023-04-22 01:31:37 tbh i’m leaning towards 2-wide
creations-chat 2023-04-24 02:18:36 literally anyone could do better with a few wedges lmao

creations-chat 2023-04-25 11:48:18 same tbh
creations-chat 2023-04-25 11:50:21 guh..
creations-chat 2023-04-25 12:21:35 someone tried asking that before and it sparked an argument, idk tbh but they put it on ALL of their builds apparently
creations-chat 2023-04-25 12:31:19 yeah tbh it’s fine if it’s a small thing but if you’re like painting the side with a large one (especially when it’s basically supposed to have camo) then uhh yeah you’re def gonna be seen easier
creations-chat 2023-04-25 12:33:21 if you’re painting it in like low vis colors then that’s better ig
creations-chat 2023-04-25 12:37:49 true
creations-chat 2023-04-25 12:39:51 i don’t really notice it but if it were larger then i’d prob notice it more so fair point
creations-chat 2023-04-25 12:42:28 true
creations-chat 2023-05-01 23:33:29 plus my guy plays clash of clans, think that’s all you need to know
creations-chat 2023-05-03 22:39:16 it’s a sucky build under the disguise of shaders

i guarantee if it was posted without the shaders, it’d get WAY more downvotes compared to upvotes
creations-chat 2023-05-05 20:34:03 <@1004101281733939271> go post that in <#495286269459300364> or something
creations-chat 2023-05-05 20:49:07 no, go look in <#384025409945337856> at carradias’ post
creations-chat 2023-05-06 01:26:03 nah, that’s an unvaccinated sukhoi lmao

creations-chat 2023-05-06 12:55:56 looks good enough
creations-chat 2023-05-07 22:08:09 slight changes yeah, i’ve seen other people do it but it’s usually for rather significant updates
creations-chat 2023-05-14 01:19:04 same
creations-chat 2023-05-17 01:59:33 117/10, would shitfuck again
creations-chat 2023-05-17 11:18:34 true and the execution just could’ve been better tbh (the least he could’ve done was scale it down so that the words weren’t that small and that spaced apart)
creations-chat 2023-05-22 02:57:20 exposed motorlock!!!!!!! 😡😡😡

creations-chat 2023-06-08 02:13:06 just because people offer criticism of a build doesn’t mean they have that build in their saves

# when will you understand

creations-chat 2023-06-08 02:34:11 idk maybe? i have a de havilland venom sitting around in my slots that should fit all the requirements for a proper rank except for the fact that it’s under 200 parts <:nooo:787097964946259978>

i could make something that fits the requirements and is above 200 tho
creations-chat 2023-06-08 02:37:22 yeah same

creations-chat 2023-07-02 23:52:37 opinion on this b-17 nose so far
creations-chat 2023-07-11 12:31:03 maybe remodeling the entire cockpit/nose part entirely, plus the canopy looks a little big on there compared to how it is irl https://www.jetsprops.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/6149569.jpg
creations-chat 2023-07-11 14:38:55 also i’d consider maybe locking the sparkler into the nose more
creations-chat 2023-07-11 15:29:16 pencil <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2023-07-11 15:41:32 isn’t it _technically_ to scale if 2 blocks = 5 feet, plus with the half block that’d add like another foot onto it
6 feet seems like the average truck height tbh
creations-chat 2023-07-15 23:06:50 it’s called gaining experience <:trollface:775024642104229898>
