creations-chat 2021-04-17 04:59:21 Nice Godzilla, here is my Godzilla. Tail legs and coloring are still in process
creations-chat 2021-04-17 05:01:24 Itâ€™s 2019, because it added thermo mode for it too. Also I donâ€™t have a pic of it in thermo. Itâ€™s quite sick
creations-chat 2021-04-17 05:04:43 Yea true. But I couldnâ€™t make the head like that small bc I had to make the eyes like that. And the bottom jaw. Also I barely use pics, and I just use my imagination.
creations-chat 2021-04-17 05:07:46 I couldnâ€™t find other peopleâ€™s godzilla online in yt rn. That are decent. There is one that looks good but dorsal fins are too spiky.
creations-chat 2021-04-17 05:09:50 Yea I know. But the person that uploaded made the 2019 dorsal fins too spiky. But thatâ€™s one of the best godzilla Ive see online rn. Itâ€™s made by shark empire.
creations-chat 2021-04-17 05:13:07 Hm youâ€™re kinda right, I thought that the dorsal fins on godzilla has grew in 2019 and werenâ€™t as spiky as 2014.
creations-chat 2021-04-17 05:16:59 Iâ€™ve seen the Godzilla vs kong movie already. I just think the 2019 dorsal fins were the Same as these one. Also actually I think I was making the 2021 Godzilla, and I added thermo mode. So I think thatâ€™s why I called my godzilla 2019.
creations-chat 2021-04-17 05:57:50 Kk. What ghidorah is it?. Is it the 2019?

creations-chat 2021-09-12 01:45:46 Finished with my Godzilla, how is it.
creations-chat 2021-09-12 02:13:26 it's too hard to cover the holes tbh, I'll try covering them up later
creations-chat 2021-09-12 02:15:27 I had a problem with the arms being to short, that's why the arms are long, and I'm pretty sure the arm is long enough to reach the knees
