plane-crazy 2020-06-07 14:59:54 Aight, i'm going to deliver bombs to someone
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 14:59:03 Is it a futuristic car or realistic car

plane-crazy 2020-06-07 14:58:17 I have an order here saying that ***SOMEONE*** ordered 4 SU-57 bombs, and that they have to be delivered by plane
plane-crazy 2020-06-07 14:55:47 Did anyone order SU-57 Bomber bombs?
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 15:01:40 I wanted to suggest this but i can't get a rank
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 15:01:14 Has anyone ever wondered if it is possible for a GPS system (Map or plane-based autopilot) to be added
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 12:43:08 Time to build a creation shredder which then incinerates the blocks
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 12:42:46 **So i can make a creation shredder?**
plane-crazy 2020-06-03 12:41:59 What's the cutter block for?
plane-crazy 2020-05-30 07:43:08 > fps lag?
<@283153622496182274> i get fps lag AND physics lag
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:49:47 Long story short; I suck at building, please help me
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:49:17 Well i have a plane that is extremely fast and is somewhat stable (Only while accellerating tho!) But i can only align the CoL and CoG by adding a counterweight in the back of my plot
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:47:55 (CoL is center of lift and cog is center of gravity for those who don't understand
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:47:23 > How do i make a plane that looks nice, has all blocks attached to the plane (so no counterweight that isn't attached to the plane), has a decent speed, is stable and is able to adjust pitch, roll and yaw with only wings?
I have only achieved everything but the "no detached parts". It's really hard to do this as i just cannot manage to not ruin the design AND align the CoL and CoG
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:46:02 How do i make a plane that looks nice, has all blocks attached to the plane (so no counterweight that isn't attached to the plane), has a decent speed, is stable and is able to adjust pitch, roll and yaw with only wings?
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:33:06 An arctic area, not a bad idea right
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:32:51 > A mountain, arctic stuff etc
***Hol up***
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:31:26 A mountain, arctic stuff etc
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:31:08 Can't a dev at least add a vulcano or something or a cool new thing to the map
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:24:26 Was it like really **really** bad
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:24:14 Why not
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:23:50 **make a dev add it back for vip servers**
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:20:20 There was a vulcano!?
plane-crazy 2020-05-29 20:20:11 Wait i just saw an old picture and i saw a **vulcano** in plane crazy
