bug-reports 2020-06-07 13:34:50 Might just be the fact that the controls are reversed.
bug-reports 2020-06-07 13:39:40 alr

bug-reports 2020-06-07 14:26:40 So, Ive had a issue, where when spawned in on the tracks, you no-clip through others (even without a blacklist). Is this intentional, or a bug?
bug-reports 2020-06-07 14:28:27 Alrighty
bug-reports 2020-06-07 14:29:37 just, i feel like this should not happen with people who are not spawned in. I was trying to have a few friends get on a new train of mine, But they just went right though.
creations-chat 2020-06-07 14:32:37 Very nice. Although, maybe make the livery a lil darker

creations-chat 2020-07-31 17:39:06 a theme park is unique, and i have not seen another one, so maybe its a one of a kind creation
creations-chat 2020-07-31 17:39:53 and not only does it make me feel good to have a unique creation,
creations-chat 2020-07-31 17:40:28 it makes other feel good too, and they wont have to leave and join a diff game to ride a rollercoaster

creations-chat 2021-07-05 04:07:57 <@!722883001197002904>  Things can take time and turn out trash, my cousin worked on a flying burrito that took him a week, but it didnt even fly, and it looked bad. meanwhile some builds can take a half hour and turn out awesome. 
Tldr; Skill levels.
creations-chat 2021-07-05 04:10:55 that, i have not
creations-chat 2021-07-05 04:12:58 Yea, that was just a way it could of gone, meanwhile, the other way is timing. when people are more active, and when they are not.
