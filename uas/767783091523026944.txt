creations-chat 2021-02-05 13:43:53 thats a really pogger Fw-190 all I say is you should make the cannons work instead of sparklers motor lock in some machine guns for the good ol PVP
creations-chat 2021-02-05 13:46:18 Oh lol me being dumb
creations-chat 2021-02-05 13:56:47 Any feedback for my jet engine?
creations-chat 2021-02-07 18:49:25 Ok I think this is good but you need to fix your intake, its to small, your canopy is really odd, and wings are to wide. plus ahedral fins are not slanted
creations-chat 2021-02-07 19:03:20 Canopy is the cockpit
creations-chat 2021-02-07 19:13:09 Oh ok
creations-chat 2021-02-17 02:55:17 Just don't ask where my wing went....
creations-chat 2021-02-17 02:57:30 She exists I was with her last night -_-
creations-chat 2021-02-17 03:00:49 Yes very phunni
creations-chat 2021-02-17 03:02:51 When you realize your mom exists because I was with her last night smh.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 22:05:34 <@!719168864705052802> why are you downvoting everything?
creations-chat 2021-03-02 22:09:03 Well atleast give some proper feed back <@!719168864705052802>
creations-chat 2021-03-02 22:11:12 Ok someone give me proper feedback on how I can improve my F-18
creations-chat 2021-03-02 22:37:11 <@!780574146919792700> no I didn't I can un lock to show you and <@!438492646311329794> that was a lot of info I was making this for a carrier but it came out to big just a little and some angles you can't get due to plane crazy is plane crazy its a video game not a building simulator. Exposed motor lock I understand is anoyying I couldn't get it to go away. Folding the wing upward would of added a motor and no I am not flying in the back seat thats the wizo's job it just looks like that because my internal view has somethings that make it look weird.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 22:40:06 <@!389516889501728779> thank you for that. <@!438492646311329794> I have canopy framing just its hard to see because of the canopy. I colored it dark. and what I mean by impossible is how my motor locking worked out I couldn't do to much. You don't need all the details to make a plane look good.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 22:42:08 <@!780574146919792700> why would I post a build that I copied in PCC? thats just not a smart idea.
creations-chat 2021-03-02 22:44:09 <@!438492646311329794> ok those are somethings I can fix thank you for that I will either rebuild or fix em if I find a way through my motor lock.
creations-chat 2021-03-03 02:36:00 I was about to say the black makes the nose pop but then I relize the WHOLE NOSE IS A DIFFERENT COLOR
the-dump 2021-03-03 03:42:24 XD
creations-chat 2021-03-04 14:54:41 <@!493681785566265348> your worm is basically just a shredder bug just very dimmed down.

creations-chat 2021-03-12 16:54:15 Feedback please.
creations-chat 2021-03-12 16:56:17 <@!758718899117752353> why the downvote?
creations-chat 2021-03-12 16:58:19 Ok what did you like and didn't like <@!758718899117752353>
creations-chat 2021-03-12 17:04:45 <@!610450108718252086> I just want to clarify is it a F-15 and if it is your canopy is nothing like it and you need more of a spine down the middle. Your wings are pretty good besides those back wings need to have more of a double spike on the start and make it kinda like this. Your wings should look like the picture and use motor lock to add your ailerons
creations-chat 2021-03-12 17:07:24 <@!610450108718252086> Need to show respect for the lad that is wearing that awesome hat.
creations-chat 2021-03-17 05:29:25 Any Feedback
creations-chat 2021-03-17 05:32:05 I might but it's gonna become a bit wider and on each side will be detail. But it's kinda funny how it's my first real battleship I tried on
creations-chat 2021-03-17 05:34:24 It just shows how a little effort can make something be decent.
creations-chat 2021-03-17 05:45:56 <@!310238229666201602> Love the 40k Chainsword. Don't see a lot of 40k in PCC.
creations-chat 2021-03-17 05:49:35 How could I fix the hull? Is it to wide? And I use a custom wedge to make it look like that I don't need more then 1 angle on each side so eh.
creations-chat 2021-03-17 05:53:03 It needs to be longer is the problem. It's my first custom battleship and a new tatic to my build. I will see how this turns out and if not then I can just restart.
creations-chat 2021-03-17 05:55:10 See thats the problem I like the single angle and not multiple little different angles. But what it really needs is a longer and less wide type of hull. Which I will try in my next shot
creations-chat 2021-03-17 17:28:29 Any feedback?
creations-chat 2021-03-17 17:43:23 Lmao I just built the plane to see what people would think XD.

bug-reports 2021-04-09 00:22:18 I loaded into the game with no plot...
bug-reports 2021-04-09 00:23:30 k
bug-reports 2021-04-09 00:23:44 Tried didn't work
bug-reports 2021-04-09 00:24:20 I got to load it it just didn't load up
bug-reports 2021-04-09 00:24:26 and didn't give me a plot
bug-reports 2021-04-09 00:24:29 I tried reseting
bug-reports 2021-04-09 00:24:34 and loading a build
bug-reports 2021-04-09 00:24:38 both didn't work
bug-reports 2021-04-09 03:26:59 What I did was just leave and rejoined and it worked lol
creations-chat 2021-05-25 14:27:39 yea never mix a F-4 with a F-14 that looks like cancer
creations-chat 2021-05-25 14:29:42 thats the product of a F-14 and a F-4 that had a kid that was autistic. It also has these weird F-18 lookin wings like why. I mean I see where you are trying to get but personally it looks like some rushed navy plane. Like a product of a poor country that needed a carrier ops fighter
creations-chat 2021-05-25 14:33:21 I think what would help is spreading the wings in the back. then make a buble canopy and try that and see if that makes anything better
creations-chat 2021-05-25 14:37:32 and make the front of the canopy a shorter slope since it's a smaller build.  The nose looks like its with the canopy so it makes it feel like its thrown inward and doesn't have a distinct canopy. So instead of the wedge you have half the length of the wedge so you can get something like this.
creations-chat 2021-05-25 14:40:53 np
creations-chat 2021-05-25 14:43:00 is this based off of anything? And if not make the cannon barrel longer. It looks like a stub rn

creations-chat 2021-08-02 05:38:04 yea, you know what game I love but is getting older and dieing slowly. Conquerors 3.  I love it so much but it's gonna die and players just don't play it anymore
creations-chat 2021-08-02 05:47:44 yes. pannel armor, and ladder armor
creations-chat 2021-08-02 05:49:46 I honestly due to the lock didn't have a good space to add the gun without it looking bad. so I put it on the side cause why not.
creations-chat 2021-08-02 05:59:20 ok I might. that was my first true pvp tank I've built so I think it's got some decent armor for what it is
creations-chat 2021-08-02 06:18:27 ok maybe
creations-chat 2021-08-02 06:31:31 I'm making a custom CAS turbo prop. how's it looking?
creations-chat 2021-08-02 06:34:26 Well of course, it's a WIP but so far is it good? Im prolly gonna add a canopy slant
creations-chat 2021-08-02 06:39:15 sadly I can't add rockets. my pc wont render the rockets or my game is just broken cause I try and fire them while flying and they disappear
creations-chat 2021-08-02 17:34:00 Custom CAS turbo prop so far (WIP) any feedback?
creations-chat 2021-08-02 17:38:03 That look any better?
creations-chat 2021-08-02 17:41:12 I'm still deciding but I think im gonna put 2 propellers on the wings and kinda get a p-38 ish look
creations-chat 2021-08-02 17:55:51 should I do a rear prop?
creations-chat 2021-08-02 18:23:40 Ok not a turbo prop but it's gonna look cool once finished
bug-reports 2021-08-02 20:46:36 Ok on my rocket glitch

bug-reports 2021-08-02 20:46:48 if it's just a computer issue
bug-reports 2021-08-02 20:59:00 I fixed the glitch
bug-reports 2021-08-02 20:59:15 My GPU wasn't working correctly so I turned on extra performance
bug-reports 2021-08-02 20:59:24 and now it works

creations-chat 2021-08-06 00:35:40 <@!514201352142979074>  https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/872989838415114321 I feel like your main wings and your vertical stabilizers need to be moved back a few blocks. your vertical stabilizers are also a bit to thick. You should make them like a block thinner. Other then that it's pretty good
