bug-reports 2021-04-02 12:54:18 So currently, every time I try and play the game, whenever I get hit by something in PVP mode, it’ll act like the game is fine for a second then it’ll just freeze, the game won’t crash, it just freezes. Do you know how to fix this?
bug-reports 2021-04-02 12:55:26 The game runs perfectly fine otherwise though,
