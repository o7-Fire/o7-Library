creations-chat 2021-08-19 14:43:53 thanks for the blue print thing,ill try and adjust it
creations-chat 2021-08-19 14:46:10 do you have any tips that can help me improve it? i dont know much so im looking for good tips and tricks so i can build better
creations-chat 2021-08-19 14:48:13 can you show me a good example of the engine motorlock?
creations-chat 2021-08-19 14:50:33 so to motorlock the engine do i just make it shorter and collapse in itself or do i use a motor and add like imitation panels to make it look good?

i see but is there a way to conserve more space? its body is only like 3 blocks wide so is there a good way to do it?
creations-chat 2021-08-19 14:53:08 should i also remove the motorlock things i made here and just make it into a solid plane part then work off from there?
creations-chat 2021-08-19 14:55:15 whats a motorlock tower and can you send me a video or smting in dms of how to do it please?
creations-chat 2021-09-01 05:16:53 yeah i know i have no idea how to make it fly without needing landing gear
i was thinking of making a ramp
or maybe just have some rocket engines on the inside to lift it up before it flies

<@!496749230925545482> do you have a video of basic custom gear stuff? i really dont know much about it and im open to learning
