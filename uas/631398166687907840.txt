creations-chat 2022-11-22 18:02:19 WIP Harrier, any feedback?
creations-chat 2022-11-30 21:44:33 Isnt that just what an attacker is?
creations-chat 2022-11-30 21:51:09 I believe although it wasn't designed for dogfights, i do think it has a chance against some fighter aircraft in a dogfight but that is not really relevant
creations-chat 2022-11-30 21:55:43 That im aware of, i know it also likely wouldnt have a kill to death ratio greater than one against fighter aircraft, i just think that it is designed wrll enough to have a chance, although it wouldnt be a great one
