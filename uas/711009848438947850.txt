bug-reports 2021-04-02 14:44:25 Hey I have had this bad mobile bug for a while where when large objects are loaded or when the server gets laggy, I suddenly can't control my build or build anything on it, making mobile playing 10x harder. I also note that this didn't happen before the Christmas update
the-dump 2021-04-02 15:03:44 I need image perms
the-dump 2021-04-02 15:03:55 Ye
the-dump 2021-04-02 15:04:09 How long does it take tho
creations-chat 2021-04-02 15:06:05 Ok to make it better first delete the build then watch 50 tutorials on building tanks and then delete the game

creations-chat 2021-04-08 00:03:31 That's not a lot of feedback
creations-chat 2021-04-08 00:05:44 Hm maybe
But that can't be the issue that causes everyone to hate it
It's too miniscule
creations-chat 2021-04-08 00:14:59 Well the wing design is different
And it has a hover drive
But yeah I see what you mean
creations-chat 2021-04-08 00:17:00 Also im pretty sure there is a mobile bias here where everyone downvotes mobile builds without actually judging them fairly
creations-chat 2021-04-08 00:19:01 OMG I GOT AN UPVOTE

creations-chat 2021-04-13 20:58:05 Wait that works?
creations-chat 2021-04-13 21:00:20 <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
creations-chat 2021-04-13 22:45:49 It's extra thrust
creations-chat 2021-04-14 01:05:49 I would say this chat and fanbase is toxic but that dude asked for it so I'ma support you guys and say screw you<@722525256241119332>
creations-chat 2021-04-14 01:08:04 You also insulted the people and posted a crappy boat WIP with a horrible color scheme
creations-chat 2021-04-14 01:10:05 Bruh moment
creations-chat 2021-04-14 01:12:05 Ever heard of an IP ban
Also they can see who you share the server invite to
creations-chat 2021-04-14 01:14:09 Wait you sleep? Lol not even a true gamer
creations-chat 2021-04-14 01:17:17 I still don't get how you can get more upvotes with a ten second plane when I spend 2 HOURS MAKING THIS
creations-chat 2021-04-14 01:19:26 Hold on one minute
creations-chat 2021-04-14 01:21:48 Ok getting ready for the downvotes to flow onto my humble creation
Wow 5 already
creations-chat 2021-04-14 01:23:48 Ok prove your theory
Also what's so ugly about it remember this is plane crazy a very limited game, even with motor lock
creations-chat 2021-04-14 01:26:15 Try making a sheridan turret using the motor locking and everything. I'll wait
creations-chat 2021-04-14 01:28:27 Ok thanks for real feedback
You too@Nannoc22#6915 
Oh and the cabin doors are there
Also mono prop is hard
creations-chat 2021-04-14 01:48:17 <:wait:652565313337950230>
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:16:04 It looks like the weinermobile
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:18:07 Hm can the silo rise up into launch position? If so try and outline that because the rocket looks stuck to the thing
creations-chat 2021-04-14 02:20:15 Then make it move up
creations-chat 2021-04-15 01:02:29 Oh boy let's see some feedback on my dropship
creations-chat 2021-04-15 01:04:30 Well
Uh
I don't have that

So that's one downvote

@Luny#0001  thanks and I was just thinking about making the wings thicker
creations-chat 2021-04-15 01:08:53 Yes
It goes 400 mph max speed
creations-chat 2021-04-15 01:18:27 Yes it's very cool
creations-chat 2021-04-15 01:20:53 Hmm
Try adding the engine...end
The nozzle er 
Y'know what I mean at the end
Also add the stabilizer fins
creations-chat 2021-04-15 01:22:54 That's it
I know helicopter stuff not plane stuff :/
creations-chat 2021-04-15 13:37:07 Still waiting for someone to make a good sheridan head tutorial
I have given up on trying to make one myself
creations-chat 2021-04-15 13:40:14 *I have tried*
It's a weird design
creations-chat 2021-04-15 13:42:15 *I  h a v e  t r i e d*
It's still hard
Please show me how easy it is. I'll wait
creations-chat 2021-04-15 13:44:16 How many times do I have to say 
__I TRIED THAT__
creations-chat 2021-04-15 13:46:16 ???
Ok then you try and build it
creations-chat 2021-04-15 13:48:17 Kinda hard to do custom angles when I'm in peaceful mode
I still can't get a disconnecter to replace it
creations-chat 2021-04-15 13:50:18 How then
Wait
Springs?????
Can you show me how or is there a youtube vid about it or something
creations-chat 2021-04-20 14:54:55 Idk how to break this to you but
It looks like crap
creations-chat 2021-04-20 14:56:57 So feedback on my sioux
*And if you say the tail I will explode

That thing is fucking hard*
creations-chat 2021-04-20 14:58:57 I wish plane crazy would allow me to angle stuff at 45 degrees without having to use motors
Like in scp 3008
creations-chat 2021-04-20 15:01:35 Well single axle is hard
I only have a hewie with single axle and it took me three days to get it right
So coaxial is the way to go with helicopters in this game

Wdym motor 2s
creations-chat 2021-04-20 15:03:36 Oh yeah 
I was looking at another reference picture without them but yeah I could put some there
Thanks
creations-chat 2021-04-20 15:05:38 I meant huey oof
Wow autocorrect be like
creations-chat 2021-04-20 15:12:16 Coaxial superiority
creations-chat 2021-04-21 02:10:15 That is the worst crewmate I have ever seen
creations-chat 2021-04-21 15:29:52 A frank gherry oprah house?
creations-chat 2021-04-23 00:37:52 Hm
bug-reports 2021-04-23 00:42:26 Every time I play and someone loads a big build or sometimes when I play long, the game will just stop me from using the build menu for a period of time, and it will also stop me from using my custom controls other than the joystick when flying(this is a mobile bug btw)
bug-reports 2021-04-23 00:45:56 And most of the time when it happens I'm at 30 fps (good for my phone)
bug-reports 2021-04-23 00:46:38 It didn't happen before the winter update I think
creations-chat 2021-04-23 00:47:07 Eh
Just make it grey
bug-reports 2021-04-23 00:56:44 Hm sounds odd
bug-reports 2021-04-23 21:17:49 That's not very helpful
creations-chat 2021-04-23 23:13:08 Idk man that does sound pretty mean
But I kinda agree
creations-chat 2021-04-23 23:39:28 Also wow that thing sucks
Talk about lack of detail

More like les dont
creations-chat 2021-04-25 21:47:45 Dear God
It's worse than I can ever imagine
Someone get this kid some friends
creations-chat 2021-04-25 22:11:34 Ok I'm about to post my kiowa for feedback and I can already see the downvotes flooding in
Here it comes
creations-chat 2021-04-25 22:14:17 Aight let's see what is wrong with this other than the coaxial part
creations-chat 2021-04-25 22:16:18 Hm well the body is a bit long
creations-chat 2021-04-26 00:37:18 Well they all look similar
creations-chat 2021-04-26 00:43:54 How does it move
creations-chat 2021-04-26 22:30:12 I don't think there is any real feedback that can be made for this
creations-chat 2021-04-26 22:34:52 Wrong dude
I was never told to make one
creations-chat 2021-04-26 22:45:05 Oooooooooooh
creations-chat 2021-04-26 23:07:51 Who mine
creations-chat 2021-04-26 23:09:52 What's wrong with it tho
It works really well
And its fun to use
Especially when someone rams into you
So just because it was low effort it doesn't mean that it's bad
Just makes it simple
And simple can be good
creations-chat 2021-04-26 23:11:54 Read your pfp.

creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:39:02 Cool
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:41:31 Either because it seems like a learning experience or because you think it's boring

Depends on your view of school
Also if you chose the second option that's pretty cringe ngl
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:44:07 I love how jerry got the second most upvotes ever on any of my posts
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:46:09 My bell 47 sioux<@510951179769872385>
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:50:31 The angle makes the cockpit look higher than it actually is
Coaxial is the most stable kind of helicopter
Decals I need thanks for the idea
creations-chat 2021-04-27 14:52:58 Don't have any other pictures of it 
Also I gtg it's like 8:00 PM here

And the exposed cockpit
creations-chat 2021-05-02 22:13:43 Use custom angles for the wings
creations-chat 2021-05-02 22:15:58 No I mean use the big motor lock chain and then put the angles there that way you can hide the ugly motor 2
creations-chat 2021-05-03 20:17:22 Idk why it has upvotes

Not to mention the poor design and the fact that you could have just made it without the rockets and just using the motors normally 

Also it has a __working__ tail rotor. B r u h

creations-chat 2021-05-28 20:11:11 Ew democrat
creations-chat 2021-05-28 20:44:01 Aaaaannnndddd I already have 3 downvotes

*This will probably go well*
creations-chat 2021-05-28 20:47:03 I was hoping that the first f-3h posted here wouldn't get downvoted to oblivion but here we are
creations-chat 2021-05-28 20:51:34 Whelp I guess I'll come back in a hour and see the damage
creations-chat 2021-05-28 21:02:01 Well that's an unfair bias

Alright I'll go on my computer and screenshot it

There isn't any difference
creations-chat 2021-05-28 21:04:30 Ok that makes more sense

I thought they just hate mobile users because they think they're little kids and noobs or something
creations-chat 2021-05-28 22:06:14 Hmm that could work<@773287769488752653> 

Good idea

I will ask my friends now
creations-chat 2021-05-28 22:11:21 Although I am surprised that I got FOUR UPVOTES WOOHOO
creations-chat 2021-05-28 22:13:45 FIVE

HONEY GET THE CHAMPAGNE

It was the f-3
creations-chat 2021-05-28 22:15:47 Daaannngggg you getting a good upvote downvote ratio 

The only good ratio I got was from my siox
creations-chat 2021-05-28 22:18:27 Man that siox took me half a week

And the castle I have never posted took me half a fricking month and is over 4000 blocks
creations-chat 2021-05-28 22:20:32 I changed the color on the bottom a long time ago
creations-chat 2021-05-28 23:19:31 So it's supposed to be round but in this case it's very square?

That actually makes sense
creations-chat 2021-05-28 23:45:18 Hm I'm the opposite

Most of my builds work better on pc

Except for my big helicopters
creations-chat 2021-05-29 00:38:26 Idk man FIVE count them FIVE people would disagree with you
creations-chat 2021-05-29 00:42:31 Yeah but five people still would disagree with that

Plus most of the downvotes are probably because I used mobile to screenshot it
So it's mainly a bias
But seriously five people would disagree with that tho

That's a big number
creations-chat 2021-05-29 00:44:48 *but five people would say otherwise*

*Five people

I still can't believe it*
creations-chat 2021-05-29 00:46:49 21 disagree*


*But still

People upvoted my plane*

*ACTUAL PEOPLE*
creations-chat 2021-05-29 00:48:51 *I haven't had that many upvotes since I posted jerry*
creations-chat 2021-05-29 00:50:52 I did check there was nobody else who posted one here
creations-chat 2021-05-29 00:52:54 WHAT??? I CHECKED THE SEARCH THERE WAS NOTHING THERE

I LITERALLY SEARCHED F-3, F-3H, AND F-3 AND NOTHING WAS THERE

FUCK
creations-chat 2021-05-29 00:54:59 Ok look at my post again
creations-chat 2021-05-29 00:57:01 Me sad now

My claims fake

Fact check thouroghly I did not

Make fun of me please
creations-chat 2021-05-29 00:59:08 I edited my f-3 post please look at it
creations-chat 2021-05-29 01:08:19 Oof
creations-chat 2021-05-29 01:20:39 Why does everyone make mig's and f-4s all the time
creations-chat 2021-05-30 00:31:18 lol
creations-chat 2021-05-30 01:37:24 Well I have posted my chinook style helicopter

Can't wait to see the bad reviews flood in
creations-chat 2021-05-30 01:39:29 Wow it's lower quality than my screenshots


Speaking of which any feedback on my chinook style chopper
creations-chat 2021-05-30 01:41:31 So many signs 
Good design tho
creations-chat 2021-05-30 01:43:32 I mainly built it for functionality but then I started adding small details so I think it makes sense how it looks a bit odd

Also yeah landing gear was super simple because I didn't know motor lock before that (it's pretty old)
So I'll definitely change that
creations-chat 2021-05-30 20:59:45 The design is right but goddamn it looks so overbuilt and uglyhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/848378212479139860/unknown.png
creations-chat 2021-05-30 21:01:55 Overbuilt as in 
It's way overdone
Too many blocks and motor locks
Idk how this thing got over 100 upvotes
creations-chat 2021-05-30 21:13:43 There's no motorlocking in it tho
And random blocks aren't jutting out of it
creations-chat 2021-05-31 01:16:26 Alright I'm pretty sure everyone thinks I'm done kind of stupid idiot (you would be right) who is toxic and I'm pretty sure most of you hate me or something or wouldn't upvote any post I make so idk if I should post this btr inspired armored vehicle
creations-chat 2021-05-31 01:18:35 Yeah I'm gonna repost my pictures using my computer day after tomorrow
(I'm currently away)
Also shaders... Never thought of that
creations-chat 2021-05-31 01:22:10 Well it's heavily based off of the honey badger from mw2 and it has miniscule wheel spacing
creations-chat 2021-05-31 14:12:12 One more day before I repost my stuff on computer
Praise
creations-chat 2021-05-31 14:18:30 Ok
creations-chat 2021-05-31 14:41:40 Man that jayhawk in creations is epic
Only problem is
Coaxial moment
creations-chat 2021-05-31 14:44:11 Also the props are way too small
creations-chat 2021-05-31 14:57:14 Well you kinda have to be mentally ill in order to stay on this server for more than a day
creations-chat 2021-05-31 14:59:18 Lol (out loud)
creations-chat 2021-05-31 15:21:40 So I updated my btr inspired thing  accordingly
Added shaders and some breakups of color
As well as a functioning hatch
creations-chat 2021-05-31 15:23:41 Also that last picture is not gonna end well
With the gun pointing straight at the driver seat
creations-chat 2021-05-31 15:33:55 Well my brothers gave me a name for it
"The BLT"
creations-chat 2021-05-31 15:59:48 When wasn't it broken
creations-chat 2021-05-31 16:35:36 Pretty cool ground vehicle transporter
creations-chat 2021-05-31 16:37:38 <@617195879237156874> makes me want to make a forklift
creations-chat 2021-05-31 18:00:41 Don't worry I just made a good functional forklift myself

Thanks for the help tho
creations-chat 2021-05-31 18:05:42 Damn that's some bad picture quality
creations-chat 2021-05-31 18:11:56 ... 

He's right

Wait

Does it even lift
bot-central 2021-05-31 18:21:24 &shelp
bot-central 2021-05-31 18:21:53 ?shelp
creations-chat 2021-05-31 18:38:37 Looks cool
creations-chat 2021-05-31 18:40:55 Hm
creations-chat 2021-05-31 20:37:25 Very very very very good<@742022749496672256> 
You too
creations-chat 2021-05-31 20:39:27 <@709835889865392268> 
Both of them look the same: 
Terrible
creations-chat 2021-05-31 20:45:39 Tbh the peak of your skill is still yet to come.
It's gonna take a while too

Kid I don't care about history I'm talking about your fucking design
creations-chat 2021-05-31 21:20:04 Looks cool
creations-chat 2021-05-31 21:23:53 Very
creations-chat 2021-05-31 21:53:26 What are you making
creations-chat 2021-05-31 22:56:43 Wait I though it was only the bell-47 that was the Sioux
creations-chat 2021-05-31 22:58:44 Wait a minute
Holy crap
That looks nothing like a h-13
You know the cockpit is supposed to be round
creations-chat 2021-05-31 23:00:47 See
creations-chat 2021-05-31 23:02:52 Lol I made my siox without any motor locking
And it was flipping coaxial
But I got the body right
And that is most of the battle
creations-chat 2021-05-31 23:04:56 "the tail is horrendous"
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/849056932286431243/unknown.png
creations-chat 2021-05-31 23:07:19 "tail rotor is too big"
Man you got everything wrong on that thing
Dude you can't criticize about my cockpit with your square front
creations-chat 2021-05-31 23:09:22 I think 7 people disagree with that
Also imagine putting propellors on a tail rotor
creations-chat 2021-05-31 23:11:23 Yes
creations-chat 2021-05-31 23:27:08 No way
What did you upvote
creations-chat 2021-05-31 23:29:49 It can't be
It's impossible
creations-chat 2021-05-31 23:31:55 Its called ending a funny moment
<:m_:778994206948589638> 

<@617195879237156874> yeah ok sure
creations-chat 2021-05-31 23:34:00 Lol
creations-chat 2021-05-31 23:36:31 
creations-chat 2021-06-01 16:30:40 I have finally done it

I have reposted from my conputer
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:06:17 Turret is a bit small
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:09:33 Farded (farded)
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:11:55 Death
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:13:57 Yeah so it's a tank destroyer
But the tank looks pretty ugly
The build
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:17:47 ~~that and because we're homophobic~~

But in reality people should know that showing decency in a toxic community like this is gonna end badly
Mainly because it's viewed as very cringey
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:20:59 Hm
*Maybe I should be
Nice...*
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:23:35 Normally I would say stfu white name but I'm being nice so now I'm saying
Why you say that
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:26:03 No I'm just asking
Y'know because the insult doesn't make sense
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:28:05 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/849381993128001576/Screenshot_2021-06-01_at_1.20.29_PM.png

*Trying hard to be nice* so uh what is this exactly
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:30:08 You didn't make it clear that it was a typhoon
Looks more like an f-3 if anything
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:32:10 ...
Look in time maybe you can do better but for now why don't you try making a bigger one and base it off a picture of it or something

Maybe use motor locking and then you might get an upvote
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:35:18 Now this is epic

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384025409945337856/849385537801289768/RobloxScreenShot20210601_152907876.png

creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:41:57 
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:44:00 Better
Might want to make the side angles custom
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:53:02 Can I get an __example__ of how the fade ruins it
I want to see if your claims are true
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:55:12 *goddamn*
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:57:15 Man I'm gonna start working on a large scale build like that now
I'm inspired
creations-chat 2021-06-01 20:59:16 Most of us probably never will build anything equal to something of that magnitude of e🇧ic ness
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:03:10 I was trying to be nice about it kid
This community gets much worse
*You don't know the meaning of insult*
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:06:11 <@690233229642563725> word of advice
Unless you want to be made fun of or insulted whenever you make an opinion don't post anything stupidly bad in <#384025409945337856> 
Alot of people take it seriously
And alot of people here are extremely judgemental and if you start acting toxic without any skill to back up to, your pretty much gonna be the laughingstock of the chat
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:08:12 It's your choice 
Might want to heed my advice tho
People are already making fun of you
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:10:13 Yeah man I made jerry in about 10 minutes as a ragdoll for stuff and then I just stuck a propellor on him and he flew<@588596347272167456>

And I got 50 upvotes
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:12:15 Where the fuck did this come from
This is a plane crazy argument not shit about homophobia
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:14:16 REKT XDXDXDXD🤣 🤣 🤣 
Farded

Wow that just slipped out
creations-chat 2021-06-01 21:16:17 *Right right I'm supposed to be nice rn

This is harder than I thought*
creations-chat 2021-06-01 22:42:02 *don't say anything bad your trying to be nice dontsayitdontsayitdontsatitdontsayit*
creations-chat 2021-06-01 22:50:55 Very detailed
Although I think your hind is a bit skinny
creations-chat 2021-06-01 22:52:57 Oooh 
I was talking about the one in creations
creations-chat 2021-06-03 00:56:38 So uh I'm making something huge for the expert vtol engineer role
Here is a sneak peak at what it is now
It's already at 1000 blocks so now I need to cram as much detail in there as possible
creations-chat 2021-06-03 01:00:30 Yeah it's still a work in progress
The gonna be a big engine where those rockets are
creations-chat 2021-06-03 01:07:51 It's purple because I use it as my build thing
Is easier to see on a mobile screen instead of white
creations-chat 2021-06-03 14:15:15 I think it's ok for the level of skill you contain, but maybe you can use a 3 prop tutorial or ask someone here how to make a really good one
creations-chat 2021-06-03 19:52:30 Who would even watch a tutorial for something that crappy
creations-chat 2021-06-03 19:54:32 I...

Can't argue with that actually

*Time to get some YouTube views*
creations-chat 2021-06-03 19:56:33 Gotta get 1k subs and 12 hours of total footage tho
creations-chat 2021-06-03 20:36:13 *sounds of aggressive tutorial video making and extremely long showcase videos*
creations-chat 2021-06-03 20:38:40 Desperately stupid ki-

I mean half of YouTube
creations-chat 2021-06-03 20:42:07 Looks great
Only problem is

*Outside trails*
creations-chat 2021-06-03 20:45:41 Yeah but it makes it look super square and tacky
creations-chat 2021-06-03 20:49:04 True
creations-chat 2021-06-03 20:52:09 Read this
It gives a good idea of why I said that @Dank Fire Truck#0455
creations-chat 2021-06-03 21:12:11 Ah yes the intentional motor lock
creations-chat 2021-06-03 21:29:17 Looks good
Got some exposed motor lock tho
creations-chat 2021-06-03 22:15:58 Charizard
creations-chat 2021-06-03 22:48:11 How

How does it have ten upvotes
creations-chat 2021-06-03 23:08:17 Well I knew that...


So that makes sense
creations-chat 2021-06-03 23:19:32 How does he have 23 upvotes geez
creations-chat 2021-06-03 23:21:34 That doesn't really add to what I was saying
creations-chat 2021-06-03 23:29:36 Yeah what the heck
creations-chat 2021-06-03 23:34:15 I believe there may be a bit of suspicion regarding this event
creations-chat 2021-06-03 23:40:28 Why does this have so many upvotes 
It's so crappy
creations-chat 2021-06-04 00:44:04 So if I showcase a crappy plane in the first version will I get 50 upvotes
creations-chat 2021-06-04 00:50:31 suggesting something supernatural; uncanny

That is the definition

Also wtf is up with your wings
creations-chat 2021-06-04 00:53:33 I do that in my sleep
creations-chat 2021-06-04 00:56:01 I peaked 600 the day after I started playing this game

1000 the next month

Pathetic
creations-chat 2021-06-04 00:58:22 Oh that's easy
Just ragdoll+parachute rapidly onto an active build
creations-chat 2021-06-04 01:02:56 Bruh
Ever heard of motor lock
Or hover drives
Or conveyor drives
Or using minimal drag
Or not using a big flat winged brick
creations-chat 2021-06-04 01:05:58 Did you try a motor lock tower
creations-chat 2021-06-04 01:09:48 Nope

A hover drive consists mainly of a hover drive with speed maxed and drag 0
With a motor on the other end
creations-chat 2021-06-04 01:14:35 Oh then good

Now stack it a couple hundred times using a motor lock tower
creations-chat 2021-06-04 01:52:36 Slow brain speed
creations-chat 2021-06-04 02:16:37 🅱️ruh
creations-chat 2021-06-04 19:06:48 Progress update on my super vtol thingy if anybody cares

I'm over the halfway point
Just need 800 more blocks

Probably gonna change some things
creations-chat 2021-06-04 19:09:56 Super vtol thingy is a lovely shade of eye destroying 🅱️urple
creations-chat 2021-06-04 19:15:07 So many f4s....


It's so overbuilt on this server too
creations-chat 2021-06-04 19:17:18 Wdym 

I don't even have an f4 I only have an f-3
creations-chat 2021-06-04 19:19:19 You didn't make it clear who you were talking to dude
You just said "bandwagon" underneath my message
Maybe next time you and your sarcasm can press the reply button instead
creations-chat 2021-06-04 19:21:21 *So many f-4s*

Also I would give it an upvote if you can give it a fanta logo on the side

Also long nose
creations-chat 2021-06-04 19:25:28 Too many f-4s with varying nose lengths
creations-chat 2021-06-04 19:36:09 Only things I know about halo are from mega constructs sets that my grandma gives me

I also happen to have one of these mega constructs sets and I know for a fact that this looks more like a bunch of bricks than that set
creations-chat 2021-06-04 19:38:11 I think the community says otherwise
creations-chat 2021-06-04 19:40:25 Lol

Toxicity and racism forever decensy never

@-Thanos-#6969 By more than meets the eye do you mean it has two speakers and suspension?
creations-chat 2021-06-04 19:42:25 This server is very toxic
I added racism for laughs
creations-chat 2021-06-04 19:44:27 Kid I'm the tip of the judgemental iceberg
Just wait until other people start seeing your crappy build
creations-chat 2021-06-04 19:46:48 Machine gun be like

<:4Weird:709084058721714324>
creations-chat 2021-06-04 19:49:09 Maybe look at a picture of the machine gun and copy it
creations-chat 2021-06-04 19:56:21 So your saying I'm a professional? Thanks
creations-chat 2021-06-04 19:58:23 No that's pretty much it
Then you just add wings and a motor 2
Preferably don't make the wings stick out halfway the length of the barrel
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:00:24 <@456226577798135808> 
Your caps lock is on<:trollface:775024642104229898>

<@733866309497913456> I only rant on people's builds that are bad
Ones with low effort and bad design

You don't see me ranting about any of the good stuff in creations
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:05:19 Listen to this dude <@733866309497913456>
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:11:14 *look who's using it white name*
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:13:15 Yeah

Mainly because everyone else was toxic to me here

Gotta harden up to deal with this chat
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:15:18 Smol wingspan
If this was real the engines would break the wings like twigs
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:17:26 Eh

It's more fun this way 

@Toot#8477 agreed

Why didn't the emote work
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:19:32 And you can't change that "car" into a warthog <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:21:34 Who said I needed to be unpredictable
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:24:32 :/
Yeah ok this white name can't seem to put up a interesting fight I'ma shift to another noob
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:26:33 Wow you must be really new to this server if you don't know what that means
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:28:39 <:Mhm:551152556324159488>


Argument destroyed in a single emote lol
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:30:46 Nice camo
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:32:59 <@456226577798135808> nice spaceplane
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:35:02 
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:37:12 I mean, if you build something that is supposed to fly that doesn't fly, then why make it in the first place
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:39:13 Oh didn't see that part
Here is your upvote, sir (look in creations)
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:41:15 I'm currently in progress of making an expert vtol ship
I'm actually building it as we speak
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:43:21 Yeah but it needs 20 upvotes so it has to be good
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:45:22 Yeah but I'm still working hard on it to make sure I get that 20

Plus I need about 500 more blocks of detail
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:47:24 Well if I post a floating 2000 block french fry... I would get several upvotes holy shit your right

So should I make it crinkled or curly
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:49:28 Too easy
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:51:38 Noted 

Will make it after I'm done with my super vtol Ship

creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:55:49 Still hasn't changed it
creations-chat 2021-06-04 20:58:14 Look at this dude
creations-chat 2021-06-05 00:30:15 Feedback on these two?
creations-chat 2021-06-05 00:32:15 Well idk what kind of color I could give it
creations-chat 2021-06-05 00:34:43 Hm I would have thought something simple like this would get some upvotes
creations-chat 2021-06-05 00:48:09 Why hate drone

You gonna make drone sad
creations-chat 2021-06-05 00:53:12 Lol maybe I should make it brown
creations-chat 2021-06-05 00:55:13 Like the number of downvotes under it
creations-chat 2021-06-05 01:25:04 If he hits 20 I'm gonna make a happy drone
creations-chat 2021-06-05 01:27:06 He commits suicide via explosives
On video
creations-chat 2021-06-05 01:32:31 Uh more like if I hit thirty before he explodes I'll hang him
And make my friend airstrike him live on a livestream
creations-chat 2021-06-05 01:36:00 If I get 30 upvotes I will list everyone who upvoted me's name on a board and then make my drone lift it up and fly it to the island on a stream
creations-chat 2021-06-05 01:41:14 If I get somehow higher than 30 upvotes I will try to make an army of drones and film whatever happens
creations-chat 2021-06-05 01:43:22 If I get over 100 upvotes I'll stop everything I'm doing and make a 2000 block flying french fry

Like that's ever gonna happen tho
creations-chat 2021-06-05 01:49:07 Good idea...
creations-chat 2021-06-05 01:51:07 No I actually don't want to make one rn it's gonna take forever
And I'm gonna have to stare at a french fry picture half the time
creations-chat 2021-06-05 01:54:47 Well I sleep now
Let's see how many downvotes I get
creations-chat 2021-06-05 14:56:36 Didn't expect that
creations-chat 2021-06-05 14:58:39 I guess I have some work to do
creations-chat 2021-06-05 15:00:39 This will take a while
creations-chat 2021-06-05 15:04:58 That doesn't look good, seeing as the plane is at a serious angle
creations-chat 2021-06-05 15:07:32 What am I supposed to be seeing
creations-chat 2021-06-05 15:09:33 Ah
That explains the emptiness
creations-chat 2021-06-05 15:30:06 C u b e
creations-chat 2021-06-05 15:51:11 What's going on with the front
There's a bunch of holes
creations-chat 2021-06-05 17:30:20 If you make a big chess board with both sides containing chess pieces that work your gonna go straight to <#627195143040139264>
creations-chat 2021-06-05 17:32:20 *hush I'm trying to be supportive*
creations-chat 2021-06-05 21:01:02 Very messy
creations-chat 2021-06-05 21:03:05 I think adding irl images to it makes it look even worse in comparison
creations-chat 2021-06-05 21:11:11 Gee didn't think of that
creations-chat 2021-06-06 00:55:16 I see no warp drive. O/10 downvote included
creations-chat 2021-06-06 00:57:22 Why thank you
creations-chat 2021-06-06 01:01:16 Wow

How long did it take you to make that
creations-chat 2021-06-06 16:51:40 Lonk nose
creations-chat 2021-06-06 16:54:29 Yeah look at how much shorter that is
That's a completely different model of an f-4
creations-chat 2021-06-06 16:57:30 Ah
creations-chat 2021-06-06 16:59:43 Yeah it's waaayy overbuilt
creations-chat 2021-06-06 18:30:00 Im currently designing an f-2 (not the mitsubishi one the American one)
creations-chat 2021-06-06 18:32:53 Cool 👍
creations-chat 2021-06-06 22:20:20 Does anyone else sometimes feel untalented when looking at the epic builds in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-06-06 22:22:23 Wait a script? What? Arg I need to start reading the chat
creations-chat 2021-06-06 22:28:31 Oh I get why your saying it's scripted now
Because it's impossible to make a self built rocket track
creations-chat 2021-06-06 22:31:15 Yes

Magnet block

Doin
creations-chat 2021-06-06 22:33:17 How does it track stuff then
creations-chat 2021-06-06 22:35:28 Please reveal the secret 
I want to add tracking missiles to my builds too
creations-chat 2021-06-06 22:37:29 What sentry trick
creations-chat 2021-06-06 22:39:45 Hm
Well I still want the secret
creations-chat 2021-06-06 22:41:47 Ok I guess
creations-chat 2021-06-06 22:49:22 Because I'm on my phone It was super laggy
Also I wish he would reveal how he did it
creations-chat 2021-06-06 22:51:23 *I wish I was special
At least not medically*
creations-chat 2021-06-06 22:54:16 Well, we need to start working then
We deserve to know how it works
So let's go fo some digging
creations-chat 2021-06-06 22:56:22 Hm
Maybe the big tracking missile is actually useless, seeing as normal missiles can destroy most planes in a single hit
Or at least make them fall
Giant missile would only be good for destroying big stuff
And that could just be guided
creations-chat 2021-06-06 22:58:24 I get that alot thank you
creations-chat 2021-06-06 23:02:36 ...

creations-chat 2021-06-08 00:46:14 Hm
creations-chat 2021-06-08 01:20:14 First delete it
Second, uninstall the Roblox program
creations-chat 2021-06-08 01:22:29 Wait what
creations-chat 2021-06-08 01:29:43 Kinda pointless because all good creations in <#384025409945337856> already have a shit ton of motorlocking
creations-chat 2021-06-08 01:31:44 Builds that have a shit ton of motorlocking are good

Well, most of them
creations-chat 2021-06-08 01:35:14 E
creations-chat 2021-06-08 01:39:56 Amazing
creations-chat 2021-06-08 18:55:22 Cool
creations-chat 2021-06-08 18:57:59 Ok but did I choose to give a fuck
No. So please, with very little respect, shit yourself.
creations-chat 2021-06-08 19:00:12 Yeah I'm actually kinda tired of being toxic 
Doesn't give the same thrill it used to
creations-chat 2021-06-08 19:03:39 Cheese
creations-chat 2021-06-08 23:17:53 O
creations-chat 2021-06-08 23:19:55 Nice name for it

This thing is as aerodynamic as a couch
creations-chat 2021-06-08 23:34:02 Yeah I realized that a bit late

Also dr.creeper has expert somehow
*Expert*
creations-chat 2021-06-08 23:36:22 He got an expert after making a falcon heavy
<@456226577798135808> same
creations-chat 2021-06-08 23:38:34 I can't link it I'm on mobile
Just search it
He got the 20 upvotes
Not much else tho
creations-chat 2021-06-08 23:40:48 *me on the other hand building a 2000 block vtol thing that looks like it came from destiny 2 for expert taking me 2 weeks to make*

I bet people are gonna say it's a copy of that other guy
creations-chat 2021-06-08 23:43:00 I use the purple as a design color because it's easier to see than just blinding white
Cockpit I am working on now
creations-chat 2021-06-08 23:45:01 That is oddly similar to my design
creations-chat 2021-06-09 00:15:51 Delete it and make a plane larger than three blocks

*BUT KEEP THE TOILET*
creations-chat 2021-06-09 00:22:30 Good idea
creations-chat 2021-06-10 01:52:06 What even

creations-chat 2021-06-10 17:08:38 Why does everyone bring up my shitty creations in an argument
I don't do that to you guys

*Or used discord before*

creations-chat 2021-06-13 01:34:09 I'm having a very hard time designing a flying 2000 block french fry
Who knew it was so hard to make one
creations-chat 2021-06-13 01:36:13 https://c.tenor.com/M1TbIaoA1oQAAAAi/think-hmm.gif
creations-chat 2021-06-13 01:53:57 Ok first delete every bit of it except for one block, then build a helicopter on that block
creations-chat 2021-06-13 01:57:25 Hmmm

Add a alot of motor locking, make it monoaxial, hide all propellors used to move it, make an engine with intakes and exhaust, and add skids, as well as paint it and add some angle locking
Also remove all large weapons, make the side weapon holders shorter, make it less long
creations-chat 2021-06-13 02:01:31 There is a physics trick where you unpower the motors and then make rockets move the props

Yes

It rotates as well
creations-chat 2021-06-13 02:03:42 Idk man but it makes this alot easier

Helicopters are veeeeeerrrrrrryyyyy complex irl

It took Igor Sikorsky 30 years to make his first successful prototype

creations-chat 2021-06-13 17:52:48 Wings be like <==◀️
creations-chat 2021-06-13 18:11:55 Angle lock the wings, make realistic intakes, definitely redo the cockpit and the front, and maybe try to make a f-15

Wtf does PCC mean

Ah
creations-chat 2021-06-13 18:27:37 Honestly I think it's just a "monkey see monkey do" situation, where if something has 10 upvotes and 4 downvotes most people scrolling in will pick the majority instead of actually judging it
creations-chat 2021-06-13 18:29:38 The key is meme recreation
*Noted*
creations-chat 2021-06-13 18:49:56 The person who made it probably didn't have a discord account

Or wasn't on this server

As long as he gives credit it's fine

I remember this happening before and they allowed it to stay

creations-chat 2021-06-14 01:14:30 👀
creations-chat 2021-06-14 01:16:44 That's kind of a constant when it comes to military helicopters, even in irl
Also I made it intentionally square in the front because early helicopters were square
Basically it's a composite of several different helicopter styles ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
creations-chat 2021-06-14 01:18:45 Ah
Ok I'll add some more details to it
creations-chat 2021-06-14 01:25:50 <:m_:778994206948589638>
I don't even know

This plane needs plastic surgery
<@646059349780987906>
creations-chat 2021-06-14 01:29:20 I think someone should have like some rank level 2 before they can post in <#384025409945337856>

Might as well call mods for the low effort or the wip
creations-chat 2021-06-16 17:51:40 Well it's a double long motor nobody even knows how to do that
creations-chat 2021-06-16 17:53:43 Oh

Well now I feel dumb
Still it hasn't been done before and people probably didn't realize how easy it was to make seeing as I'm average IQ of a person on this server and I didn't even know how you did it
creations-chat 2021-06-16 17:55:46 Someone call the mods

 idk how because I'm either stupid or don't have the perms

@SoulSnatcher18#5680 you didn't even change the design from the last time you showed us that
^thats why
creations-chat 2021-06-16 17:58:26 Somebody actually upvoted these
creations-chat 2021-06-16 18:00:45 <@466793357318815744> there's a WIP in <#384025409945337856>


(Originally I was trying to @ all of the mods)

That's why I did that message above
creations-chat 2021-06-16 18:02:47 Delete it and actually look at an f-22
creations-chat 2021-06-16 18:05:09 Why do all of the mods have do not disturb on
Just makes it harder to find problems like this

creations-chat 2021-06-16 23:37:49 Lol

If you think Roblox YouTubers are even notable you have a problem
creations-chat 2021-06-16 23:40:23 Well of course I didn't read the entire thing it's like three paragraphs long and not even worth my time, seeing as it's a glorified red stick
creations-chat 2021-06-16 23:52:29 *what part of it is useful??*

Also the picture and design alone is all I need to know what to type afterwards
creations-chat 2021-06-16 23:55:20 Thats still not very useful
creations-chat 2021-06-16 23:57:54 <@532785111264133130> epic
creations-chat 2021-06-17 00:20:45 Looks more like a venom than a huey
creations-chat 2021-06-17 00:33:18 It's big and grey, and has a weird nose
Sounds like a venom to me
creations-chat 2021-06-17 00:36:55 Kinda stumpy
Also exposed motor lock
creations-chat 2021-06-17 00:44:01 Just say it has some "modifications"

<@738702049113538600> uhhhh I think both sides have humvees

creations-chat 2021-06-17 01:20:18 It's all about balancing,
Also don't use rigid rotors it makes you look like a noob
And if you don't know how to make a monoaxial helicopter, don't.

Be careful with motor lock towers because they create a bunch of weight, make sure to have vertical stabilizers for stability

Try to make simple designs, and be careful with the fronts because they are often really round and not pointy like a plane
creations-chat 2021-06-17 01:23:36 That's about it
creations-chat 2021-06-17 01:47:39 It's not that bad
creations-chat 2021-06-17 02:07:45 I'm surprisingly close to a designer 4

Maybe try making the prawn suit or seamoth or something else

Ooh how about the seatruck
That's definitely not common
creations-chat 2021-06-17 02:41:41 It shouldn't be too hard
Once you have the initial design it should be easy to add the attachable modules and stuff using magnets
creations-chat 2021-06-17 02:44:12 I kinda wish plane crazy would fix the water to allow submarines to be dry inside

creations-chat 2021-06-19 02:15:49 There needs to be some kind of skill verification before they allow someone to post on <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2021-06-19 02:22:07 <@691024513827209336> looks great but the front is a bit weird

creations-chat 2021-06-20 00:55:33 Well we can't make explosion resistant blocks
Also we can't make a fuel injector that actually works also we can't carry liquids
creations-chat 2021-06-20 01:02:04 Well try doing that and then try and put it into a practical use

Note these things take up the entire build space

It's so easy to make a 4000 block ship it's almost pathetic
Like any noob could just place a platform on the ocean

You don't need upvotes for the first four
*Im pretty sure it's the easiest way to spot a noob, seeing as most of them only have shipwright*
creations-chat 2021-06-20 01:14:52 Well you actually have to make something good

creations-chat 2021-06-20 01:34:45 Epic

WAIT A MINUTE

IS THAT EXPOSED MOTOR LOCK?!?!?!
creations-chat 2021-06-20 01:36:46 Decrease drag increase vertical stabilizers
creations-chat 2021-06-20 01:38:58 Increase the amount of delta wings and decrease the amount of normal wings
Try motor locking it
creations-chat 2021-06-20 01:41:22 I think the game isn't smart enough to render that a motor locked delta wing is behind another, allowing minimal drag

Of course I'm not entirely sure that it works I might need to run some tests
creations-chat 2021-06-20 02:06:25 Ok I tested it, the drag does decrease but it becomes alot more unstable

So don't do that

Exactly
creations-chat 2021-06-20 15:14:06 <@456226577798135808> your color scheme is awful
creations-chat 2021-06-20 15:16:17 Also all of your designs are the same
They only differ with wings
creations-chat 2021-06-20 15:21:59 Hey, have you ever actually seen a fighter jet before? Maybe if you actually looked at one you might see why your planes suck

Your lucky your not getting warned for low effort build in #creations
creations-chat 2021-06-20 17:50:59 Also if your going to show something that looks like shit you have to expect people to hate it for looking like low effort shit

Also you will be warned by a mod if you do something that bad again
creations-chat 2021-06-20 17:55:05 Maybe you should read the rules first before you post shit

They aren't at the right angles
*Ocd triggers*
creations-chat 2021-06-21 20:19:23 Err I think it's a 33° angle
creations-chat 2021-06-21 20:21:24 Uh you do realize you need to use motor 2s in order to get the angle on the props right
Otherwise it's all at 45 degree angles
Which isn't the right angle for a 3 prop propeller
creations-chat 2021-06-21 20:23:25 Ok my bad it was 120 I forgot my math lessons from last year

Still his angle was off
creations-chat 2021-06-21 20:26:16 Well yeah I get that but if you want it to be accurately proportioned you gotta use a motor 2 mechanism that allows the props to be in a set correct position 

I hope I grammered that right

creations-chat 2021-06-23 00:35:22 If you don't want downvotes
Don't post it
creations-chat 2021-06-23 00:37:23 Actually it wasn't that harsh
It could have been much worse
This was more informational than insulting

If I wanted to hurt your feelings I would have said something more clever and insulting
creations-chat 2021-06-23 00:40:33 Well... Just look at my siox
Some people get no downvotes
creations-chat 2021-06-23 00:42:38 True
Especially with low quality stuff
creations-chat 2021-06-23 00:45:12 Some people downvote to troll or because they hate popular stuff

So yeah it's not if, it's when
creations-chat 2021-06-23 00:47:13 *what?*

creations-chat 2021-06-23 01:07:08 Wow now your playing the "it doesn't matter" card

Maybe when you get your dumb ass some skill you can actually get an upvote
And some respect from anyone here

@EpIc MeMeR#1904 nice car
creations-chat 2021-06-23 01:09:09 What is this "pedestal" you speak of and why do you think I have one

Seriously your logic is non existent I don't even know what your trying to roast me with half the time
creations-chat 2021-06-23 01:11:11 Of course I haven't heard of some obscure dumbass expression
Maybe if you actually figured out how to insult another person you wouldnt be bullied in school

Then again, preschool bullies are kinda bad at it too
creations-chat 2021-06-23 01:13:12 Ok
creations-chat 2021-06-23 01:17:30 How mature

creations-chat 2021-06-23 01:25:03 Hey I'm just saying what I think

Aaaaaaand he took it down
Now I feel guilty
creations-chat 2021-06-23 01:28:24 Still looks a bit weird
Front is a bit long
creations-chat 2021-06-23 13:26:48 No the dish is actually a spinning restaurant on top of the plane that serves top secret food items
creations-chat 2021-06-23 13:31:03 You didn't hear it from me
But one of the minor appetizers are super hot wings
They are made of ostrich wings and Carolina reaper sauce
*Sounds heavenly*
creations-chat 2021-06-23 19:36:37 <@467459282250629120> looks an awful lot like a tutorial...
creations-chat 2021-06-23 19:40:21 <@456226577798135808> it seems your rockets are coming off on the end of the props

Also are those fake rotors I smell?
creations-chat 2021-06-23 20:02:53 Make it like 200 200 200 for the white to make it off colored a bit
creations-chat 2021-06-23 20:22:50 Cool bro
Glad I needed to see that
creations-chat 2021-06-23 20:51:33 Should I post this skycrane

(I'm going for the military look)
creations-chat 2021-06-23 20:53:49 Thicker where exactly

Also got it add cargo
creations-chat 2021-06-23 20:55:59 Greenish grey
creations-chat 2021-06-23 20:58:10 Hmm maybe I should make the engines bigger and add smaller things to behind the rotor

Also I'm not doing a firefighter version
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:00:11 Now I'm convinced
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:02:13 Maybe I'll make two versions
One military other normal
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:04:27 Hmmmmmmmmmmm
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:21:48 *gasp*

Major difference in angle
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:32:42 Now compare it to your creation
<:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:35:12 Actually that might make it worse, seeing as the PCC doesn't like customs that look like a failed recreation
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:37:20 Actually the 10yos are the people posting shit creations and then using this channel
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:40:29 1. It's kinda obvious your replying to this comment because you were severely insulted
2. Unless you didn't already get it, I'm talking about noobs like you who can't make a realistic recreation without a tutorial

Luckily there are less people like you than there are people who are actual functioning players
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:42:38 Thalius you might want to heed their advice
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:44:39 Tutorials are already shit so that's not saying much <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2021-06-23 21:46:46 Does the bell-47 ring a bell, white name?

creations-chat 2021-06-25 00:48:28 You need to make the front intake clearer
Make it more obvious

Man so many low quality builds today
creations-chat 2021-06-25 18:41:06 Well yeah there are exceptions

Also that killdozer would be better if it had more details, like the guns sticking out
*Y'know like the original*
creations-chat 2021-06-25 18:45:05 Try using motor lock
Then you won't have to change the sides
creations-chat 2021-06-25 18:50:39 No not like that
Use a motor lock tower

creations-chat 2021-06-25 19:06:48 Why did you even post that
creations-chat 2021-06-25 19:08:49 Busted
Y'know maybe if you read the rules you would know you can't do that

Also ffs use some context with your builds
creations-chat 2021-06-25 19:10:50 <@273536574770380800> we got a repost in <#384025409945337856> by <@799335319945085018>

*Dammit where is that mod*
creations-chat 2021-06-25 19:16:55 Y'know most people will say what the build is to actually make the person understand what they are looking at
That's context
creations-chat 2021-06-25 19:25:08 Dude your breaking the rules
You call a mod
It's what most people here do

Stop overreacting

Bruh I'm not trying to blacklist you
Just trying to get it deleted
creations-chat 2021-06-25 19:27:16 Y'know maybe you shouldn't break the rules at all
Maybe you could avoid this whole process

Plus reposting just shows you can't come up with anything new
creations-chat 2021-06-25 19:29:25 Bruh nobody should have to tell you not to repost
You should already know by reading the goddamn rules

@Scout#0621 design bad


You get a warn with your delete

Energy = mass times the speed of light squared

In physics, mass–energy equivalence is the relationship between mass and energy in a system's rest frame, where the two values differ only by a constant and the units of measurement.[1][2] The principle is described by the physicist Albert Einstein's famous formula:[3]

Or do the exploit and just say you did it like that
creations-chat 2021-07-09 02:08:38 They are usually new people in the server that ignore the rules 70% of the time

The white name is proof that they haven't been ranked yet
Most of the time it's because they have little talent and didn't know there was a ranking system because they haven't heard of it yet

creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:46:10 Still applies to the rules
Cuff em boys
creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:48:21 Actually because it wasnt your design the build isn't even yours rules still apply and judging by your grammar I don't think you should even be allowed on discord
creations-chat 2021-07-11 01:50:49 Nice heli

Bruh this isn't some kind of kids server, we don't hand out participation trophies
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:19:38 This isn't just some kind of children's server we criticize because we hate seeing these shit builds clog up the system
Welcome to the real world
Participation trophies don't exist

creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:25:42 I don't take any offense
I'm not very good at jets anyways

At least some people liked it
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:27:51 Yeah man your actin kinda jerky

Also i made sure my builds didn't look like microwaved shit, so that they wouldn't be instantly mega downvoted the second I posted it

But the thing is, I don't care about my shit builds
All I care about is transformers wfc and my cat
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:29:57 Not bad

@Kanye#8633 sir I don't think you understand, but I have the right to act like a dipshit or hypocrite if I wanted to. Also you may have missed all of my actually good builds I have posted
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:31:58 Also who are you to say who is good or not, you haven't even posted on creations
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:33:59 Ysee, some people can't handle criticizm. It's both one of our major annoyances and greatest entertainments
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:36:54 Your definitely not acting like an older player
Your give off a false sense of superiority, like you think your better than us
creations-chat 2021-07-11 15:38:56 Ok

creations-chat 2021-07-31 17:56:13 Very nice
creations-chat 2021-07-31 17:58:28 I look at these people making epic planes and stuff with incredibly lifelike details and a little part of me goes "hey, how about I try tha-" and then the me who is sane goes "NO NO DONT JUST DO HELICOPTERS"
creations-chat 2021-07-31 18:00:30 Helicopters are the only thing I'm good at in this game
I gave up on planes a while ago
creations-chat 2021-07-31 18:05:29 PCC standards are always rapidly fluctuating
You just have to pray that they will be merciful today
creations-chat 2021-07-31 18:55:35 I'm trying to find old helicopters that haven't been made here often
creations-chat 2021-07-31 18:57:37 Fire rescue eh? Hmmm
I think I can find something like that
creations-chat 2021-07-31 19:10:50 I could make a bell 212 with a pop out crane to lift things
creations-chat 2021-07-31 19:13:07 Or should I make a bell 412
creations-chat 2021-07-31 19:15:13 Which one should I make

creations-chat 2021-07-31 19:20:27 Magic, LSD, and lots of Dr. Pepper
creations-chat 2021-07-31 19:22:29 The LSD usually helps cover that up

creations-chat 2021-07-31 19:33:17 The nose is the hardest part with helicopters because it's super round usually

I'm trying to make a bell 412 that has a slightly sharper nose than a huey so I'm going to go through the same trouble

creations-chat 2021-08-01 22:01:58 <@852934999824269322>  context is the only thing that will save you from a creations blacklist rn

We have tutorial evidence

creations-chat 2021-08-01 22:24:31 So any suggestions for the design of the cabin before I start on everything else

creations-chat 2021-08-02 00:28:17 Imagine not being able to take criticizm
creations-chat 2021-08-02 00:30:18 Oh but I do

This guy was telling you what was wrong with your awful build and you can't seem to handle someone saying it was bad.

Simply a difference in skill
In other words skill issue
Git gud
creations-chat 2021-08-02 00:34:41 1. I don't know how to join your game because you haven't given me a link to your server
2. Your obviously the one mad here seeing as you can't take criticizm for you awful looking jet

Git gud<:FineTroll:626841259746656289>

I always love it when this happens it makes this chat much more interesting
creations-chat 2021-08-02 00:36:58 I don't think that's on mobile because I'm like 2000 miles away from my desktop
creations-chat 2021-08-02 00:39:42 Says the white name with only verified and image perms

Also why don't you look up my stuff in creations
You might notice how I've played this game before

Lol it got deleted for spamming
creations-chat 2021-08-02 00:42:34 Honestly I agree <@456226577798135808> this is quite hilarious I love when this happens

maybe i didnt do the best picture angles
creations-chat 2021-08-02 14:33:55 Yeah but the motors don't like hover engines
creations-chat 2021-08-02 15:06:45 i think roblox had an outage
i was just kicked from my game
creations-chat 2021-08-02 15:17:53 i was kind of referencing the paint to this

because fire and rescue

but they are kind of sus
creations-chat 2021-08-02 15:45:08 honestly it looks pretty good as it is
creations-chat 2021-08-03 00:14:03 Reminds me of the popular 3d print test benchy
creations-chat 2021-08-03 00:16:06 
creations-chat 2021-08-03 01:12:20 Post a link

creations-chat 2021-08-03 02:13:44 So I made a french fry

1 vote for yes
1 vote for no

Any suggestions
creations-chat 2021-08-03 02:19:27 What colors should I use

I don't want to have anything other than the fry

<@824856122799161354> that's not a ship that's an abomination
creations-chat 2021-08-03 02:21:29 First press the delete aircraft button
Then stop playing plane crazy
Then commit tax evasion
creations-chat 2021-08-03 02:24:06 __Reason for what__

Y'know if it's a test thing and if it's the first motor locked creation you have 

Don't post it 
Because usually it's gonna be shit
creations-chat 2021-08-03 02:26:25 It doesn't break the rules in any way
creations-chat 2021-08-03 02:29:45 Skill

Perhaps you have an issue revolving around it
creations-chat 2021-08-03 02:31:50 Kinda thought this would get more upvotes
creations-chat 2021-08-03 15:33:01 <@413827183790915607> have you ever heard of wedges
creations-chat 2021-08-03 15:38:22 Yeah this looks totally fine

-_-
creations-chat 2021-08-03 15:40:52 The hull is rough and he could have just used some simple angle locks or even use some fucking wedge blocks
And it would look ten times better
creations-chat 2021-08-03 15:43:40 Says you https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/384025409945337856/766178241509589032/Screenshot_2020-10-15_005816.png
creations-chat 2021-08-03 15:45:44 Lol look at this dude
I must have struck a nerve
creations-chat 2021-08-03 15:48:40 Wow I must have hit the spinal chord or something


Ok I'll rephrase what I said <@808227046227968040> 

*Ahem*
Please smoothen the hull of the ship I don't like how it looks
We happy now
creations-chat 2021-08-03 15:50:53 I wouldn't call it an argument
Usually an argument is structured  and doesn't involve an obnoxious amount of insults
creations-chat 2021-08-03 15:53:12 Well that's kinda how life goes doesn't it

Wow my first upvote in years
creations-chat 2021-08-03 18:28:47 Interesting

creations-chat 2021-08-03 19:27:43 How does it even exist without exploding
Or desintigrating into nothing
creations-chat 2021-08-03 19:42:56 It's so blurry

creations-chat 2021-08-03 22:54:45 Fix the wings for the love of god
creations-chat 2021-08-03 22:59:06 They are too thin and have holes in them

Also they are too short
creations-chat 2021-08-03 23:01:35 That's gotta be one of the 7 deadly sins
creations-chat 2021-08-04 01:12:52 I never thought I would hear someone say "cockpit too smooth"
creations-chat 2021-08-04 17:45:38 <@757095344638263337> yeah sure your the first one 100% your so cool

creations-chat 2021-08-04 20:09:34 What would you expect from a white name with only verified and image perms
creations-chat 2021-08-04 22:25:10 Holy shit 

This is sorcery of the highest order
creations-chat 2021-08-04 22:27:11 <@475644634513801276> this is a disgrace to all that vtol planes stand for
creations-chat 2021-08-04 22:39:38 Oh no

creations-chat 2021-08-05 22:31:50 I wonder if it can make a pickaxe
creations-chat 2021-08-05 22:38:18 <@392017463690133515> Gustav would be proud
creations-chat 2021-08-05 23:59:06 Well duh we like a fucking Roblox game and get toxic about it

*How...?*
creations-chat 2021-08-06 21:42:04 So what do you think of the flying french fry
creations-chat 2021-08-06 21:44:05 So basically a french fry that flies

Anything specific to change
creations-chat 2021-08-06 21:46:09 Ok I'll add some more color into it

I could probably do it quickly if my computer would turn on

<@456226577798135808> natural shapes are kind of hard
creations-chat 2021-08-06 22:35:54 What's up with the dual motor thing on the props

creations-chat 2021-08-08 13:40:51 <@699054603035082835> remember when among us wasnt dead? I can't 
What I do remember is untalented people made them here and never saw an upvote
creations-chat 2021-08-08 16:34:04 Man there is some awful shit in creations today
creations-chat 2021-08-08 16:36:05 If that's one of your best you have a serious skill issue dude
That "car" is just straight up garbage

*Damn I hate it when white names just unload their first builds onto creations*
creations-chat 2021-08-08 16:38:10 There was like 2 decent creations and one actually good one
creations-chat 2021-08-08 18:18:22 When the

creations-chat 2021-08-08 21:35:42 Ah yes even without context I know what that blob of white is

Even though useful context to accompany your image is highly valued
creations-chat 2021-08-08 21:55:05 Cringe ass 
Nobody asked you  <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2021-08-08 21:57:34 Yeah that b24 is good
creations-chat 2021-08-08 21:59:44 Welcome to pcc

Also it's kind of fun when there's an overreacting child in the community who can't take criticizm
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:04:42 Delete it
Then try to make a plane

I don't see a plane
I see garbage
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:06:47 We should give him a picture of a normal plane or something
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:08:51 Here is a plane
P l a n e
Cmon try to spell it with me
P...

You got the number right <@175382189922451457>

Bruh it's a four seated Cessna 172
Lemme check
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:11:03 Oh it's four seated

(<@717092746485170277> I'm bored so this is the only thing I can think of rn)

<@175382189922451457> it's a 172 I looked up images for it
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:14:10 It all started from your garbage plane
Interesting

The pcc's standards fluctuate<@464634048279478282>

<@717092746485170277> can you like stop minimodding
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:16:44 Why thank you
I'm only like this on this server
Everywhere else I'm just normal
It takes a large amount of pent up rage, mental illness and deppression in order to create this level of toxicity
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:19:56 It really sounds like your trying to minimod there
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:23:12 That's the fake purpose
The real purpose it to contain all of the toxic players into one confined space
That way it doesn't spread too far

*You keep feeding the beast and the beast doesn't attack*
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:25:14 If the build isn't just microwaved shit then people actually do give feedback
We only act like this when a white name posts a shitty build here
creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:27:16 In the middle of our street

creations-chat 2021-08-08 22:29:32 Not really

creations-chat 2021-08-09 21:44:24 Fuselage and front needs fixing
creations-chat 2021-08-09 21:59:02 Perhaps it's an issue?
creations-chat 2021-08-09 22:02:13 <@756874223372337263> just add some animatronic things and your all set

creations-chat 2021-08-09 22:07:38 Please don't make a roach unless it can be killed by a spider
Or at least a thermonuclear warhead
creations-chat 2021-08-09 22:09:39 Lemme just grab my A7 and load it with warheads
I'll join you soon
creations-chat 2021-08-10 00:15:27 That's not what an f-22 looks like
<@694360846155120731>
creations-chat 2021-08-10 00:18:11 Could have just used control surfaces dude

Also it's completely wrong
creations-chat 2021-08-10 00:20:28 You can see that he doesn't know what an f-22 is ffs
Sounds like a major skill issue
creations-chat 2021-08-10 00:23:24 Raptor has a major eyesore factor
creations-chat 2021-08-10 00:33:37 More like shitty everything
creations-chat 2021-08-10 20:26:08 So what did I miss
creations-chat 2021-08-10 20:31:38 What is it
creations-chat 2021-08-10 20:33:57 Of course

creations-chat 2021-08-10 21:10:04 Then I will ***NOT*** believe your a person over 10 years of age
creations-chat 2021-08-10 21:12:06 Make the wings angled or use delta wings or something

I can't see it in the perspective you give me
creations-chat 2021-08-10 21:15:53 Ah
creations-chat 2021-08-10 22:30:39 If you do not show proof you will lose  58 social credit


OMG GUYSSSSDS HE COPYIED MY BULD HE DID HE DID HE MADE AN ENGINE OMG HE USED MU IDEA OMGGG

creations-chat 2021-08-10 22:33:43 Dude your not the first person to make a hover engine, and even if someone were to make one of course they would follow the same design because that design is the only one that will work
creations-chat 2021-08-10 22:35:59 Stop crying about how someone made something similar to yours


A s p a r a g u s
creations-chat 2021-08-10 22:39:33 Lol the nose does look like an a7
It's pretty awful

Not you <@813263196361850890> 's plane
creations-chat 2021-08-10 22:41:36 Oh not again
Why are all of the white names illiterate and suck at insults
And grammar
creations-chat 2021-08-10 22:48:15 The AA gun is bad

creations-chat 2021-08-10 23:22:12 Dude actually look at these two pictures. They have very little in common
Quit ranting about it and chill the fuck out
It's not like he's saying he invented it or whatever
creations-chat 2021-08-10 23:24:20 ThEsE aRe ThE sAme PiCtuReS
creations-chat 2021-08-10 23:30:53 How is that proving it's a copy
Dude just because you build something doesn't mean you own it's design
If someone made a f-4 and said that because another one used the same wings design or something and called it a copy is it really a copy?
creations-chat 2021-08-10 23:33:54 Grammatical
creations-chat 2021-08-10 23:36:25 It's a different design dude just because it's similar doesn't make it a copy
creations-chat 2021-08-11 19:23:50 ***B***
creations-chat 2021-08-11 22:40:40 It kool
creations-chat 2021-08-11 22:47:36 I think I'm gonna try remaking my A7 better

I'll post progress tho
creations-chat 2021-08-12 23:13:05 What should I add/change?
I tried making smaller ones but they don't work
creations-chat 2021-08-12 23:15:35 Hold on I'm raising the wheel height it will be a minute

creations-chat 2021-08-12 23:48:22 Well


Any feedback
creations-chat 2021-08-12 23:54:27 That's a deal breaker oof
creations-chat 2021-08-12 23:59:56 Before I post this
Anything you want changed

Ehrm

I'll add a gun later

Anything about the design though?
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:02:10 Ok so I'm hearing I should add a gun
I kinda just wanna do the car itself before that

*Also it can already fly because of the wings I used*

I was told to do desert camo
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:06:13 Took the colors from this


Ok yes I'll add a gun to it but anything on the design of the car itself before the gun
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:08:18 Hmm maybe I need to take out those ladders
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:14:16 Alright
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:19:02 I have motors down there that look like suspension but they are just out of view
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:23:39 I will add that when I add the gun
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:26:41 It's in creations now
Let's see how it goes
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:28:42 What's to fix

Also I wish you said something earlier before I posted
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:30:58 Motor lock shouldnt be necessary
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:33:11 I missclicked on the reply
I meant to do the other guy
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:37:48 I mean I love the wall e and everything but I don't think it was Hof worthy
I think he oversells it
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:39:49 So that's how I do it
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:42:02 So what do you think of my humvee
😃
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:44:06 So if it doesn't get over 100 upvotes in less than twenty minutes it's crap?

*Ono*
creations-chat 2021-08-13 00:46:07 EASY??!?!
creations-chat 2021-08-13 01:31:59 Yeah I'm sorry my computer committed no worky a couple of weeks ago so I had to take my pictures on mobile
creations-chat 2021-08-13 01:34:00 It's partially submerged in the back there

3. Feel ashamed of your peers
4.

creations-chat 2021-08-13 22:13:09 Where is the TikTok build I wanna see it

creations-chat 2021-08-13 22:16:47 O
creations-chat 2021-08-13 23:36:15 Due to popular demand
Gun

*It's the best quality I can get on a 2016 phone sadly*
creations-chat 2021-08-14 14:11:58 Dammit why do all of my builds max out at 70 upvotes
creations-chat 2021-08-14 15:41:22 I can't even remember how long I've been working on this

Trying to get vtol expert 
Anything you guys want changed or added
creations-chat 2021-08-14 15:43:24 Yeah I know my quality is shit now days because my computer broke and I have to post from my phone
Trying to get a new laptop but don't have the money yet
creations-chat 2021-08-14 15:46:07 Well the thing is 
My cpu did burn
Fan broke and I didn't notice until it was already smoking
creations-chat 2021-08-14 16:29:56 I smell a tutorial
creations-chat 2021-08-14 17:24:38 If someone posts a tutorial it's against the rules
Also it's pretty cringe to need one
creations-chat 2021-08-14 17:28:11 Not really
Your argument up there was pretty pathetic
creations-chat 2021-08-14 17:45:11 It really was 
They all made fun of you for it
creations-chat 2021-08-14 19:37:11 When skill > 0
creations-chat 2021-08-14 19:39:13 Trust me
It does
If I increase the quality more of the map is loaded and the laggier it gets
Also it doesn't change how the game looks the fuzziness is just my screen being bad
creations-chat 2021-08-14 19:43:39 Because that makes sense
creations-chat 2021-08-15 01:34:16 I think the name suits it
creations-chat 2021-08-15 01:36:56 People who upvoted this be like

And yes I will improve the colors
creations-chat 2021-08-15 12:39:10 Wait, really?
Wow ok I expected something critical I'll go work on the color then
creations-chat 2021-08-15 13:35:03 Ok here it is painted
I'm trying to go for a shark kind of look
creations-chat 2021-08-15 13:37:03 It's also over 2000 blocks, meaning I can submit it to get expert vtol
creations-chat 2021-08-15 15:16:07 Well here it is
I'm about to post it

*Dear god why is the quality always that bad*
creations-chat 2021-08-15 15:23:43 There are several different shades of grey used but you can't fucking see them because Roblox doesn't screenshot at all

What other colors
creations-chat 2021-08-15 15:25:45 That's what it looks like 
But the potato graphics on my phone combined with the large size makes it hard to see the colors
creations-chat 2021-08-16 00:54:45 Man there is some absolute shit in creations today

creations-chat 2021-09-09 00:11:18 So it can't even fly?

Also the nose is not great
And the body shape is pretty wrong
creations-chat 2021-09-09 00:13:20 *most people don't even need to make a prototype to make planes they just build it and be done*
creations-chat 2021-09-09 00:16:26 I gave you the advice dude the body is completely wack and the holes in the wings are not attractive

creations-chat 2021-09-09 00:18:27 Obtain fakeness
creations-chat 2021-09-09 18:43:05 It's pretty much based of the tutorial 
Doesn't make it a copy of it tho
In my opinion it's fair game
It has some originality
creations-chat 2021-09-09 20:43:01 It's good but not hof worthy
creations-chat 2021-09-09 20:49:17 Slendygraymen

creations-chat 2021-09-09 21:30:33 Like as if it's in war

creations-chat 2021-09-10 23:49:57 Maybe you should cry about it
creations-chat 2021-09-10 23:52:00 <@195253906333368320> we have a guy who has broken 3 rules today you might wanna get him

I am
Can't you see my tears
I'm clearly coping by crying about it
creations-chat 2021-09-11 00:05:40 Dude you were clearly trying to milk upvotes

None of your shitty creations could ever get an upvote, so you use 9/11 to get free ones
Fucking pathetic
creations-chat 2021-09-11 00:09:07 *they all say that*
People did this kind of low effort shit on every national holiday
And they all just milked the upvotes
It's insulting



Wow alot of new users in <#504436696021204992> today
creations-chat 2021-09-11 00:11:56 Welcome to pcc
We are harsh critics that instantly supercritic the shit out of stupid, offensive and bad builds
We are toxic and you should cry about it because we aren't changing anytime soon
creations-chat 2021-09-11 00:14:05 
creations-chat 2021-09-11 00:23:08 Lmao cry about it you wussy upvote milker
creations-chat 2021-09-11 00:25:24 Lmao

creations-chat 2021-09-11 00:30:03 Technically both
creations-chat 2021-09-11 00:33:06 Well that's not exactly what a holiday is
A holiday is a day of reflection and celebration
Holidays can be sad, like dias de muertos
Or days commemorating wars
creations-chat 2021-09-11 00:48:44 For making a horrible upvote milking 911 statue*
creations-chat 2021-09-11 01:30:42 Cry about it kid
creations-chat 2021-09-11 01:33:28 *Hold the fucking phone*

The fuck did you just say

Are you saying the lives of 3000 ***innocent*** people dying is no matter?
creations-chat 2021-09-11 01:39:12 I dont think you understand
They committed a serious war crime against several thousand innocent people (something that the united states doesn't do) and you are saying that the united states have done worse?
<@456226577798135808> *it wasn't very funny*
creations-chat 2021-09-11 01:43:50 They were at war in all of those
There's a difference
We were not at war with terrorist before the attack

<@195253906333368320> political bullshit

*We were forced to start all of them otherwise other shit would happen smartass*

creations-chat 2021-09-11 13:13:28 Hello mortal
creations-chat 2021-09-11 13:19:43 <@855465070523973662> y'know if you think it's bad and it is clearly bad and it looks like you have never seen an f-35 before, then maybe you shouldn't post it
creations-chat 2021-09-11 13:21:45 Wow looks exactly like it now<:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2021-09-11 13:24:28 Yeah but they don't look great
Also they really don't idk how you came to this realization
creations-chat 2021-09-11 14:18:54 <@733268749100253305> y'know it would be nice if we knew what the fuck that thing is
But I guess giving context is just too hard
creations-chat 2021-09-11 14:20:58 I do not even know where to begin with what this is
It's just a weird blob thing
<@733268749100253305> give us context ffs
creations-chat 2021-09-11 14:22:59 Because your build looks like a pile of shit constructed by a toddler
creations-chat 2021-09-11 14:25:05 If you read the rules you would know that work in progresses aren't allowed in creations

*Why does nobody read the rules ffs*

<@733268749100253305> they don't :/
creations-chat 2021-09-11 14:27:12 <@195253906333368320> we got a wip in creations and possibly a low effort
creations-chat 2021-09-11 14:30:41 Stfu white name
Get used to it
creations-chat 2021-09-11 14:32:43 He didn't say the colors are wip
Just because he neglected color doesn't mean it's a wip
A wip is something that isn't done being designed

<@809008106646011934> I can tell.
*Man if I had a dollar for every time a white name cried about the toxicity here...*
creations-chat 2021-09-11 14:35:22 Man we should get an unde check on you 
I was talking about the brick thing not your godawful low effort shitstain
<@723940197456281640> <:OmegaTroll:626841385118597152>
creations-chat 2021-09-11 14:41:09 I don't do Russian planes so idk what that is
Most of them have unmemorable names or just no names whatsoever

They should make like a test or something to show that you read the rules when you get on the server

creations-chat 2021-09-12 20:44:10 Also that paint job looks like bird shit
creations-chat 2021-09-12 20:51:38 Also coaxial rigid rotor is pretty cringey
And it's way overscaled
And it has no motorlocking
And it has no details
Or doors
And it has a tail rotor
creations-chat 2021-09-12 20:55:36 No, but it helps with detailing and design and gives the thing a bit more of a realistic touch
creations-chat 2021-09-12 21:00:51 Yeah but can you make unnatural angles with out it?

Also I don't care if it's his second time I don't think you should post a build unless you think it's actually worth posting, and if I think it's complete noobshit I'll say it, because I don't judge like as if this place was full of children
creations-chat 2021-09-12 21:03:10 Cry about it white names
I take criticing seriously 
And if I don't like something I'll say it and you can't stop me
*And I can criticize it all I want*
creations-chat 2021-09-12 21:05:16 I don't care
 If it's posted in creations it's fair game
This can't be your first encounter with the term white name huh?<@376049059695165440>
You people obviously haven't been here before
creations-chat 2021-09-12 21:07:21 Actually if I didn't care I'm open to both options 
I can say whatever I want
Also can you white names cool it 
This guy posted a shit build in creations
I don't care if he's new he should know that posting something that is shit will be criticized

Bruh
I didn't even say the word
creations-chat 2021-09-12 21:12:16 So why were you just complaining about me saying whatever I wanted and criticizing the post?
creations-chat 2021-09-12 21:14:19 <@376049059695165440> so I can't say whatever I want? Man your really hypocrital here
creations-chat 2021-09-12 21:16:20 Well I mean

Truck my beloved
creations-chat 2021-09-27 23:45:59 Any feedback on this before I boot up my computer and post it?


Dear god...
How did you get yourself to motorlock that
creations-chat 2021-09-27 23:48:34 Yeah I saw that
I asked for a hex code for a darker shade

I think it's the photo quality that makes it looks whiter

(I used 200 200 200)
creations-chat 2021-09-27 23:50:44 Hm

creations-chat 2021-10-01 20:16:43 No the motto is
If it's trash give the creator an intestinal rash

The motto up there glorifies this channel too much
creations-chat 2021-10-01 20:21:54 Either that or 

We gladly serve the most useless and insult riddled feedback that can ever be given to all custom- I mean users of every race and iq level

As long as it's trash or somewhat bad
Mass downvote.


Totally didn't take that from a restaurant motto
creations-chat 2021-10-01 20:25:05 Yikes
creations-chat 2021-10-01 23:52:40 I saw the first creation I ever made
And thought
"...
I can do that a million times better now"

So now I made it a million times better in every way and giving it a working hoist

Wow that picture turned out terrible

I require feedback
creations-chat 2021-10-01 23:55:07 The gimmick is is that it isn't like an osprey where it turns into a plane
Instead I rotate the engines in order to control the pitch so it's technically just a helicopter that moves very well by moving the engine itself

*I'll show a video when I finish it*
creations-chat 2021-10-02 00:01:51 <@703852511206834196> wow asking for downvotes how original comedy 100 you get a gold star<:YouTried:559530066258821131>

I'm too lazy to load the video so just tell me
creations-chat 2021-10-02 00:10:38 Ok so here is how you get good in your case:
Really fucking stare at several pictures of armored transports, dedicate hours to graphic and 3d design to know how to design things, and then watch several YouTube motorlock tutorials and by next month you will be making a decent armored transport
Among other things hopefully

Seriously just search in creations "first"
creations-chat 2021-10-05 18:49:58 Honestly if I saw that giant thing flying around I would easily take it down

It seems slow

400 for a helicopter??? What is it vtol
creations-chat 2021-10-05 18:52:38 Why would you need a heli to go 400 ffs
200 is understandable but 400?!


Well most helicopters can do that easily<@443852405906341888>


Toxicity mainly
creations-chat 2021-10-05 18:55:23 Makes it harder for assholes like me to insult noobs
creations-chat 2021-10-05 18:57:23 I think the max speeds for most helicopters is like ~200mph

Unless you count the osprey and the speedhawk

So 400 is a bit much

My pvp helis are made to go slow so it can hit the damn thing

help 2021-10-07 01:13:44 So you might want to make it either fake rotor or use the cringe rigid default propellor pieces
help 2021-10-07 01:13:56 I suggest doing it fake rotor
help 2021-10-07 01:14:19 It's what I used for this tri rotor design

Only thing worse would be making it rigid rotor
creations-chat 2021-10-07 13:07:23 Also you aren't fooling me with that tri rotor design
Every helicopter expert knows that when making a custom 3 blade rotor it will be wobbly thanks to how motor 2s glitch out the normal locked motors

This thing cannot possibly fly smoothly
It would have to be fake rotor to fly smoothly
creations-chat 2021-10-07 13:10:14 Then how could it fly smooth
There is no way to get a three bladed prop to actually function correctly
creations-chat 2021-10-07 13:13:06 Wait how do you have expert designer you haven't posted in creations
 
The swashplate doesn't affect the glitch the glitch only works on helicopters with custom rotors and without swashplates

Trust me I know I made several things with custom rotors and none of them fly smoothly with conventional rotors
creations-chat 2021-10-07 13:15:59 The fuck?
How old are you

White name I don't remember you being a part of this convo
creations-chat 2021-10-07 13:18:19 I've been doing helicopters for a long time kid
If there was an expert for it I would have it
I know there is no way to make a stable tri rotor
It has to be fake rotor or it wobbles out of control
<@736201072938582066> silence white name your opinions are invalid

help 2021-12-28 03:47:02 The design you chose with that giant thing is more or less decorative rather than practical
help 2021-12-28 03:47:20 You could try a more scale or smaller design, as it works better in pvp

help 2021-12-28 04:04:57 In height it needs to be four blocks or five blocks
help 2021-12-28 04:05:42 Ffs lemme explain this again with visual aids
help 2021-12-28 04:06:58 This thing is one block wide and one block high, and four blocks long
help 2021-12-28 04:07:33 I want a rotor like this, but five props

creations-chat 2021-12-30 16:04:02 Actually it got 60 upvotes over 9 downvotes
I think the color and lack of finer details are the problem

But yeah the guns suck
I couldn't really do anything about it because of how I motorlocked it

creations-chat 2022-01-01 03:30:15 So what should I add/paint on this guy
I already tried making it look like my skin but that didn't look great

<@757887014388367401> 👍
creations-chat 2022-01-01 03:34:18 Me too but it's surprisingly hard to kill yourself by accident

The disconnectors are supposed to look a bit like armor but I might be able to add the effect
creations-chat 2022-01-01 03:39:05 That might be a bit difficult

<@771407578285867108> *cries in 60 upvotes on my humvee*
creations-chat 2022-01-01 03:41:26 Actually I'm planning on making a new humvee seeing as mine is kinda dated
creations-chat 2022-01-01 03:43:27 Ngl that would be awesome but how TF would I make it work
creations-chat 2022-01-01 03:49:02 *it has a jetpack*
<@551806781609869313> good job
Could use some more details and maybe working doors
Or paint
Or three rotors per Sikorsky's style
creations-chat 2022-01-01 03:51:35 Very plain
Also might wanna fix that gap

Add details and texture to it
Maybe make the paint less bright
creations-chat 2022-01-01 14:54:21 HOLY SHIT
creations-chat 2022-01-01 14:56:32 How should I color the DAV-E

<@723940197456281640> as I have been in one, it's really not bad just normal toilets

Shit I did self upvote
creations-chat 2022-01-01 14:58:34 No but I think there's a m1911 inside of each one
creations-chat 2022-01-01 15:01:51 Ah yes, casually spraying down your ass in a tight stall with two people on either side of you
creations-chat 2022-01-01 15:03:51 Wtf is that editing on the photo lol

creations-chat 2022-01-01 19:38:44 <@!611251614178869269> not much of an interior to speak of, its just kinda grey

<@!698587744842022983> cry about it
creations-chat 2022-01-01 19:40:47 hm maybe i should add a detailed interior
creations-chat 2022-01-01 20:01:49 this any better?
creations-chat 2022-01-01 20:04:04 i tried, but i had a problem with scaling

creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:51:17 Basically, it's shit and you should make a plane with actual color and wings
And design
And anything a plane has
It really is just shit how does it have a positive upvote ratio
creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:53:23 Do a different color palet
Also I don't think they painted wheels
creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:55:27 Tutorial is tutorial dude even if they change the color or add an extra gun. 

<@811909229588906006> yeah and look at your tank
See any difference?

Sapling I read the whole thing if it came from a tutorial it is a tutorial
creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:57:30 Then explain wtf is happening in creations
creations-chat 2022-01-01 23:59:30 Yes, because every PCC member is a good kind and wonderful person that builds off of the creations of others

Also why the fuck is a shitty plane getting more upvotes than a fucking Lusitania

Suffocation

creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:29:27 Best way to give feedback (for everyone else) is
1. Spam ping the person from creations and say "ur build sux"
2. Go on about how terrible their build is and try and start an argument
3. begin meming and make fun of their past builds and shit creations (helps if they are a white name so you can role shame)
creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:33:39 Also make sure to make fun of their shipwright role
creations-chat 2022-01-10 13:58:38 Alt + f11 for bobux

creations-chat 2022-01-13 19:37:58 It's really bad<:m_:778994206948589638>

Bad colors, design is weird and doesn't make sense, shitty fuselage, tail is a mess, the thing is giant, etc
creations-chat 2022-01-13 19:40:18 You have designer 2 you shouldn't be talking
It's that simple

<@765983880032682054> work In progress
creations-chat 2022-01-13 19:42:21 I told you in the original message

Bad colors, design is weird and doesn't make sense, shitty fuselage, tail is a mess, the thing is giant, wings are full of holes, that landing gear should prevent any flight, undetailed and has no variety
creations-chat 2022-01-13 19:45:12 Lmao self ping

Simply put, watch some plane basics tutorials and re create stuff until your builds become socially acceptable
creations-chat 2022-01-13 19:47:25 DONT POST IT
For your own sake don't post stuff in creations until you have watched all of the tutorials
Or advanced
