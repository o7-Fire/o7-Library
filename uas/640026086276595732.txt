plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:36:35 woke
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:34:03 *Now that's a lot of damage.*
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:33:49 Unless it's a boat build.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:33:14 yas
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:32:38 Since it just broke after 10 seconds later
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:32:31 That photo was probably a once in a lifetime thing
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:32:18 It does to be honest with you.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:31:44 ex plu sion!
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:31:19 LOL
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:30:26 They used magnets.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:30:21 From the looks of it.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:30:18 I am still trying to figure out how they made it.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:26:42 Something that I saw in a PVP server
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 17:26:33 
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 05:13:41 instead of them glowing in the day
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 05:13:37 I want to see the blocks
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 05:13:32 because
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 05:13:07 I though it needed magnets since when I looked at it didn't have the suspension.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 05:12:08 Hey, so does anyone have an idea on how to recreate this?
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 03:29:15 I legit saw someone do this on a PVP server.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 00:16:35 But I can never make the details with great accuracy.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 00:16:18 I can create a plain lame outline of the boat that I want to make.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 00:15:56 Man, I wish I could be good at making details.
plane-crazy 2020-04-29 00:15:41 <@!435946988559925248> ebic
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:41:10 One kid even added bombs onto those missiles.
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:39:55 lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:39:31 It wouldn't be historically accurate tho
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:39:23 It wouldn
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:39:20 Well I mean.
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:39:16 Hm.
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:39:11 I have 4 turrets on it.
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:39:03 Uh
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:38:47 I don't think boat builds can't escape those things either way.
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:38:16 I can't shoot them down with my destroyer
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:38:09 ikr
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:38:01 No mercy the second it touches your build
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:37:50 Those missiles are like a pack of rabid dogs.
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:37:33 So, what is it exactly?
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:36:51 The only way I can describe it is 6 flying dogs in the sky tearing your build apart.
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:36:31 So whenever I join a PVP server there is a 2/5 chance for a special strange build.
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:36:11 I have a question though.
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:34:15 It'll then lock in place
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:34:11 Click the forward button again
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:34:02 After the 180 fold gets into place
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:33:55 <@!400465835845615616> Use the lock option.
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 23:33:46 ?
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 17:08:38 Plot:
Has a width of 51 blocks
Length has yet to be measured.
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 17:06:50 What's the length and width of the plot?
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 17:00:38 *I just wanted dat cookie*
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 17:00:17 Wot should I do
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 17:00:08 so uh
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 17:00:00 *That's gonna be a problem when I make the turrets and detail*
plane-crazy 2020-04-28 16:57:49 How should I fold this?
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 21:32:44 <@!300103214873968650> Give me a PS to join with you, I want to compare my plane with yours.
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 21:32:01 The manual controls are there so you can make aerobatic moves.
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 21:31:42 To be honest with you.
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 21:31:33 lol
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 21:30:40 *I guess I'll add more control things*
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 21:29:54 <@!300103214873968650> Got any suggestions for mouse turns?  I already based by manual turns with controls that I use in War Thunder.
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 21:29:08 *Alright, I now just need to work on the aiming part*
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 21:28:50 <@!300103214873968650> So, you can practically aim and do sharp turns, correct?
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 21:28:12 the egg is really bringing plane crazy some 5 year olds
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 21:27:57 uh
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 21:27:39 Aight, send me a PS or send an account for me to join into.
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 21:26:50 So, is there a possible way to make a plane turn automatically and manually, if there is a way then this will revolutionize dog fighting.
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 21:25:55 Ok, I will ask a question real quick.
plane-crazy 2020-04-27 01:17:19 <@!300103214873968650> Awesome flex but who asked?
