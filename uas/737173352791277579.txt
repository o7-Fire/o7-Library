The Tale of likeablesea7 (737173352791277579)
help 2021-02-25 20:21:26 So I'm making my first helicopter and I need some tips on stopping they plane from spinning, any help would be appreciated.
help 2021-02-25 20:24:53 yes I tried that but i couldn't get the tail roater to spin fast enough to completely counter the spin of the helicopter
help 2021-02-25 20:26:01 ok I'll try that, thx for the help
help 2021-02-25 22:21:23 i want to make it as close to the real thing as much as possible so i can use rockets
help 2021-02-25 23:47:06 yea but there is another problem, the AH-64 Apache has the back roater very high up, and if i use it to counter the spin of the main roater blade then the heli will tilt sideways and fall
help 2021-02-25 23:50:42 after looking at a real picture i noticed the man roter was tilted forwards, so all i had to do was tilt the main roter 13 degrees forwards and now it fly's fine.
help 2021-02-25 23:51:47 im trying to make it realistic so i cant add anything other than what the actaul heli has
help 2021-02-25 23:53:20 its hard but possible
help 2021-02-25 23:53:45 ive finished all the technical stuff, all i have to do now is add extra details
help 2021-02-26 00:03:34 It look good so far
