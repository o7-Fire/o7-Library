events-chat 2022-04-30 08:20:02 but, since it wraps around opponents, isnt it gonna get cut first cuz it takes times to wrap and the enemy already cut one of the arms
events-chat 2022-04-30 08:24:52 i mean, theres no holes in the pcc arena next time
events-chat 2022-04-30 08:50:09 airsoft is the best sport
