creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:02:18 The turret also seems a bit too big for the body. It needs work, but not bad.
creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:04:12 Also, that falcon 9 dragon is like, 6 times small. Also, the legs are wrong. Not the best effort.

creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:08:02 Yeah.

creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:10:01 Yeah. There isn't a rule that says " Rule 34, Do not post a build if people have the opinion that it sucks."
creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:10:36 It's kinda fat shaming a build in some ways..
creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:11:21 Note, I wasn't saying it was bad, just giving tips for later on builds.
creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:11:40 Well, I get that.
creations-chat 2020-05-31 22:13:56 Ouch. I get it that you don't want crappy plain white builds that take 5 minutes, and never work, but your age assuming off of detail.

creations-chat 2020-09-20 18:03:11 I'm just going to take it down, I didn't copy it, it's my OWN BUILD. They might be simmular, but mine is longer, and uses different folds.
creations-chat 2020-09-20 18:04:46 Yeah, I did take it down. But the tail, rotors, length, cockpit, interior, sides, rear, color, window placement, all different.

creations-chat 2020-12-27 04:11:15 You could do it by two plates that move into position, then motorlock down.
creations-chat 2020-12-27 17:44:06 Yeah, prob based off the Mil Mi 24. There is a Starwars clone wars gunship based off it also.

creations-chat 2021-05-26 17:35:57 Foxtrot class submarine "B-39",
Museum in San Diego.
creations-chat 2021-05-26 17:40:36 Calm down, just saying what exact submarine that was.
creations-chat 2021-05-26 21:23:18 Rotor blade count is wrong, there are five, no blade sag, and the ends of the stubby wings are slanted, instead of pointing straight down like they should be.

-5 chicken nuggets
creations-chat 2021-05-26 21:33:41 ~~the plaen behind the slaughter~~
creations-chat 2021-05-27 06:12:21 I've seen worse.
Aka an undee building that one tutorial space shuttle,
and the undee next to him copying it but without wedges, just in default 1x1 blocks.
creations-chat 2021-05-27 06:14:48 Here's the picture:
creations-chat 2021-05-27 14:11:51 We're not shit-ing on them, we just have opinions.
creations-chat 2021-05-27 14:13:52 I don't hate it, i'm just telling you to commit shut.
creations-chat 2021-05-27 14:16:11 Something good for a change.
creations-chat 2021-05-27 14:20:53 I feel bad for people stuck on mobile, but at the same time it isn't an excuse.
creations-chat 2021-05-27 18:57:08 Paint it like this:
creations-chat 2021-05-27 22:23:53 Front slope is a bit sharp, could be longer, but otherwise sweet turret.
creations-chat 2021-05-28 08:26:22 Orbiter chain?
creations-chat 2021-05-28 08:31:49 Thank you,
creations-chat 2021-05-28 08:34:47 Yeah, the first three "Creatures" were just shredder bugs with extra steps.
creations-chat 2021-05-29 00:40:28 Not bad.
creations-chat 2021-05-29 19:40:33 Someone make this, T-3455.
creations-chat 2021-05-29 19:44:40 There's a story behind it, I wonder what the actual hell it is though.
creations-chat 2021-05-29 20:32:17 If there is a rope space issue, motorlock the bottom jaw into place so you can fit more.
creations-chat 2021-05-29 21:32:44 Ngl, the mod's should focus rather more on mass downvoters, but instead they warn people who want to edit their own screenshots.
creations-chat 2021-05-29 21:56:02 y e s
creations-chat 2021-05-29 21:59:37 Should be, it's a T-34 hull with either a T-55, or later on auto-loader turret.
creations-chat 2021-05-29 22:02:40 Yeah, it looks like an abrams.
creations-chat 2021-05-30 01:10:46 Or one US official hospital Band-Aid.
creations-chat 2021-05-30 05:16:37 Jesus fucking christ, just post pictures instead of 20 billion 0:00 minute long videos.
creations-chat 2021-05-31 23:30:11 It's called "High opinion".
creations-chat 2021-05-31 23:32:14 Including your builds.
creations-chat 2021-05-31 23:36:03 
creations-chat 2021-05-31 23:38:16 No, this is patrick.
creations-chat 2021-06-01 00:09:05 At least i'm not you.
creations-chat 2021-06-01 00:11:14 Looks cool, but what the hell is it?
creations-chat 2021-06-01 00:13:16 o  k  a  y.
creations-chat 2021-06-01 22:47:35 Hind cockpit, thoughts?
creations-chat 2021-06-01 22:52:07 No no, this is just the cockpit, i'm bored.
Like as in an entire new build.
creations-chat 2021-06-01 22:55:59 Still working on the cabin fan and stick, but otherwise it's close, no?
creations-chat 2021-06-01 22:58:44 Do it better then, i'll wait.
bug-reports 2021-06-03 05:59:05 Fix the ragdoll bug already.
bug-reports 2021-06-03 21:54:58 Okay, who pissed off the grass again?
bug-reports 2021-06-03 21:55:52 My entire server is having this issue.
creations-chat 2021-06-04 18:49:25 Same with the Yak-38 and Mig-21.
creations-chat 2021-06-04 18:52:57 As soon as the Yak-38 came out in War Thunder, there has been a rise.
At first there were two uploads, and then it went over a dozen.
creations-chat 2021-06-05 21:46:56 There will be a short film of the landing with LeeBigBear soon.

creations-chat 2021-06-05 22:09:25 What update?
creations-chat 2021-06-05 22:11:44 Huh, surprising that he fixed something for once.
creations-chat 2021-06-06 09:31:19 The camo is really crackjob.
creations-chat 2021-06-07 02:12:48 <@!377251520086933504> Add a jar of dirt.
creations-chat 2021-06-07 03:40:08 #everythingincludingeverything
creations-chat 2021-06-08 21:44:21 It kinda looks like a bunch of 1x7 beams slapped together, and then painted default red.
Just low effort.
creations-chat 2021-06-09 01:04:25 It gets beat by a microscale cockpit.
creations-chat 2021-06-09 02:50:56 It looks like a door stopper.
creations-chat 2021-06-09 20:12:15 That's gotta be the best Mig-21 i've seen.
Most people over do it, or get everything wrong.

The one with the brown camo*
bug-reports 2021-06-09 20:55:33 Locked motor's go flying away at high speeds.
Such as aircraft landing gear.
creations-chat 2021-06-09 22:04:27 Agreed.
creations-chat 2021-06-10 03:34:58 By the looks of it, now isn't a good time to post anything. 
At all.
creations-chat 2021-06-10 03:38:31 Do I look like I care? Shut up, filth.
creations-chat 2021-06-10 22:14:44 Great, now everyone is making F-5's.
creations-chat 2021-06-11 08:09:38 Nice, just add some detail to the front if possible.
creations-chat 2021-06-11 08:22:37 This is the aircraft my MiG-23MS is:
creations-chat 2021-06-11 08:26:03 Yeah, I only made it in an hour or so.
creations-chat 2021-06-11 18:37:32 Cool, but a 1x1 block has more detail.
creations-chat 2021-06-11 18:43:16 Point is, it lacks detail.
creations-chat 2021-06-12 06:17:52 Does this look good, or should I do less/more locks?
creations-chat 2021-06-13 21:34:21 No, that's the map in the background.
creations-chat 2021-06-19 17:13:48 It looks like he forgot the bit where single rotor helicopters need their center of mass to be exactly in the center of the rotor.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 00:55:20 I get why they make them, but at the same time I don't. They're cool, but they don't really have a purpose. Like building an artillery shell without the canon itself.
creations-chat 2021-06-20 01:08:21 Lol
creations-chat 2021-06-22 23:42:17 Maybe do something creative with the wheels, rather than just fabric cylinders?
creations-chat 2021-06-22 23:50:36 Custom wheels or shit.
Don't just do what everybody else does.
creations-chat 2021-06-23 00:38:00 Yeah.
creations-chat 2021-07-04 18:10:06 <@!809982182025068625> Nice Kiev class.
creations-chat 2021-07-10 21:07:26 I can only imagine how much fun it would be to destroy that with explosives and stuff.
creations-chat 2021-07-11 06:30:58 Thoughts so far?
creations-chat 2021-07-11 06:35:28 VM-T, carrying Buran prototype.
Not sure on how it will be able to fly, the VM-T will be on it's own power and stuff, normal gravity.
creations-chat 2021-07-12 21:02:50 <@!472265922523168768>
creations-chat 2021-07-12 21:12:43 Yes. Ugly wedge car.
creations-chat 2021-07-12 21:43:29 I can't tell if it's the same, it looks like it is but he messed up while building it.
creations-chat 2021-07-12 21:45:31 Yeah, besides the LMG. He actually made it worse. Same with the colors.

The mod staff is so low, there won't really be anything done about it for awhile.
creations-chat 2021-07-12 21:50:25 It's kinda sad that Obc, literally just an admin, is more active than rickje.
But we still need to summon him manually.
creations-chat 2021-07-12 21:53:50 I do agree with this, but the game/server is really low on staff, and nobody is even thinking of fixing that.
creations-chat 2021-07-12 21:56:27 Why settle for a bike, when you could have a car?
It would just be nice to see some actual massive progress. It's been this way for a very long time.
creations-chat 2021-07-12 22:02:40 All of them, and yet there are still countless issues left unmoderated, and not even bringing up the game bug count that rickje hasn't fixed.

I've heard of the game code issues, and I know he's working on it. I'm just saying, why not hire someone else to help fix the mess that mad left.
creations-chat 2021-07-12 22:05:14 I know how bad the game code is, and I know that rick's working on it. I'm just saying that rick should hire a few more dev's.

And No, I didn't see it, that's on me.
creations-chat 2021-07-12 22:07:19 I never check there, because nothing ever visually happens. Just talk, besides what isn't even shown.
creations-chat 2021-07-13 00:34:32 It's literally the same tank, besides the color and the LMG. He made a horrible tutorial worse.
creations-chat 2021-07-13 00:37:42 How the hell do you even copy a tutorial. Isn't that just building it.
creations-chat 2021-07-13 21:49:41 International Space Station project with <@!387022912286228480> , thoughts so far?
bug-reports 2021-07-14 00:42:49 There's this ragdoll bug, when I activate the normal ragdoll my avatar body flings around and has spasms. Even in 0 gravity, and nobody else i've met has this.
creations-chat 2021-07-14 18:31:51 Agreed, he's going to be warned/blacklisted for low effort. Maybe even banned on suspicion of being -13.
creations-chat 2021-07-17 04:20:14 Nice, but maybe paint it any other color. It looks like it was blown up already.
creations-chat 2021-07-19 16:50:16 Make the "Wing" bits tilt upward like irl.
creations-chat 2021-07-20 00:41:55 Least he could do is move it back into the middle of the wings, and hide it as detail.
creations-chat 2021-07-20 21:40:49 The upper torso bit looks like the end of a flashlight.
creations-chat 2021-07-20 21:45:26 It just looks kinda weird, like it came out of a low budget 2003 power rangers movie.
creations-chat 2021-07-23 19:54:20 
creations-chat 2021-07-24 23:26:02 
creations-chat 2021-07-28 08:03:56 The recoil on that thing does more damage than the shell itself.
creations-chat 2021-07-29 13:55:57 Why does every single person who makes a TIE only 2 blocks wide in the middle? Why not three?
creations-chat 2021-07-29 14:51:23 It looks like a bird that flew into a window.
creations-chat 2021-07-29 14:53:38 Just default suspension, No keybinds, and attach a rope to each one. You don't need anything fancy or oversized.
creations-chat 2021-07-31 22:29:37 Looks like the Oil Tanker from DSS3.
creations-chat 2021-08-03 03:24:57 I joined your server, to show you my orbiter.
creations-chat 2021-08-05 03:08:49 Maybe use something more creative than cylinders for the barrel? And add an actual shell firing system.
