plane-crazy 2020-07-18 16:24:54 STILL SPINS! Would a swashplate work or something?
plane-crazy 2020-07-18 16:17:23 Should I use propeller blades?

plane-crazy 2020-06-14 00:50:42 "skilletrocks2016#2571
Suggestion #6041
Maybe a 500-800 Robux gamepass. "Mega rocket engines." Amount: 2000 engines. Looks like a normal rocket engine, but the flames could be purple or green. The speed of a single one could be 500-1000 speed, could be used to make very fast jets, or make carriers move at normal speeds." How is this not a good idea? It's game break-able, could be used for evil, but if it cost more than i'm worth, not everyone will have it.
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 05:21:46 Thanks I guess.
plane-crazy 2020-06-13 05:20:12 Yeah, mine isn't totally accurate. Still changing things. Not many good images that are the real thing that I can find.
