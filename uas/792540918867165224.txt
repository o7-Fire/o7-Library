The Tale of a.q.u.a.r.i.u.m (792540918867165224)
bug-reports 2021-11-25 23:55:41 In the popular Roblox game known as "Plane crazy" I am experiencing a bug where to when I click the button to launch my seafaring vessel, the vessel itself gets teleported but I, do not. I have been experiencing this issue for quite a relatively long period of time, and I must say that it has been interfering with my levels of enjoyment for the popular game known as "Plane crazy".
bug-reports 2021-11-25 23:57:57 Though as much as I would like to provide examples to assure you of my honesty, it sees I do not possess image permissions. (Edit: This has since changed.)
bug-reports 2021-11-26 00:00:03 In place of getting teleported as one would expect to have occurred, the vessel is all that was teleported, and even though it did get teleported, it appears that it is floating in the air above the depths of the ocean.
bug-reports 2021-11-26 00:12:47 Sir, Contrary what you suspect may be the solution, I assure you that your solution will not work.
creations-chat 2021-12-03 03:42:36 <@!693956114403819610> the heli is generic, is why people downvote
creations-chat 2021-12-03 03:45:34 Simple, it‚Äôs a generic build, building an attack helicopter isn‚Äôt anything rare or new or exciting, same with jet fighters.
creations-chat 2021-12-03 03:52:31 Well it‚Äôs the problem for me, I don‚Äôt care really about the looks about them since literally everyone makes one, they are the room temperature water of plane crazy.
creations-chat 2021-12-03 03:54:51 ok
creations-chat 2021-12-03 03:58:51 And made the lid black
creations-chat 2021-12-03 04:00:54 A zeppelin, a big one
creations-chat 2021-12-03 04:19:51 Folding a ship makes it considerably weaker, and since he probably will use it in pvp mode, it was a good choice to not fold it
creations-chat 2021-12-04 03:28:08 Colour
creations-chat 2021-12-05 03:05:00 <@!849557593046777886> did you seriously make a shredder, and post it in creations?
creations-chat 2021-12-05 04:19:07 cringe
creations-chat 2021-12-05 18:49:06 how
creations-chat 2021-12-05 18:51:21 thank
creations-chat 2021-12-05 18:56:57 I already said what it was
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:00:44 tnt blocks are torpedoes, and what the hell does rotund mean
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:04:02 they are not fat, they are as small as they can be and the barrels don't need to be any longer, 4 block long barrels is all one needs
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:06:17 no, it's functional and sleek and the turrets are either 3x4, 7x7 or 5x5 so 4 block long barrels are relatively long
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:08:24 it is sleek, prove me wrong or cry about it.
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:10:27 A, yeah most ships are flat on the back, B yeah most ships don't frickin use squiggles for sides because that's stupid and it's not a box if you actually looked at it/knew what a box was, this build took me days and it 9.7k blocks and it is my best build.
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:12:40 A it's a ww1 heavy cruiser,  it was meant to be a destroyer at first but changed my mind about half way through so I didn't change that, and it has an interior anyway so no it's not just filled with blocks.
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:14:48 it's not meant to be a real ship though and again, it was originally meant to be a flat back because it was originally a destroyer.
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:16:53 that would make the build back heavy and I don't wanna change it anymore then I already did, I wanna move on to my next build, if you guys think it's bad then I think you just have your expectations set to high.
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:20:22 screw yall
creations-chat 2021-12-05 19:22:33 anyway, my boat is good and you guys can go cry about how it makes you wanna die apparently
creations-chat 2021-12-06 00:15:17 no -me
it's not based on any ship, as I SAID so I can make it look however I want
creations-chat 2021-12-06 00:17:22 this is what my build looks like so far
creations-chat 2021-12-06 00:21:39 it's meant to be this https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/zeppelin-war/images/1/1d/Assault_Blimp.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/851?cb=20200923014642
creations-chat 2021-12-06 00:23:41 zeppelin wars.
I don't know how I am going to round the front.
I wont put the dehli police logo on it.
creations-chat 2021-12-06 00:25:44 two pontoons wont work
creations-chat 2021-12-06 00:36:20 dude, like 7 people already told me it's bad, leave me a l o n e
creations-chat 2021-12-17 00:36:05 everyone in <#384025409945337856> when they see a build that isn't absolutely perfect in every single way: üëé
you guys set your standards to high
creations-chat 2021-12-17 00:38:14 decent and good builds get <:Downvote:490311668556103700> aswell, not just bad ones, it seems that if a build isn't great then it's just gonna get 50 downvotes smh
creations-chat 2021-12-17 00:41:13 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/920989036556980295 like this is quite good and yet it got 39 downvote
creations-chat 2021-12-17 00:45:43 it is a great replica of the real thing, you can't judge it off of that, you are meant to judge it off accuracy
creations-chat 2021-12-23 14:30:19 Idk I thought it looked nice
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:45:22 Idk how to make a block tnt block torpedo that is 1 block wide and doesn‚Äôt use pistons
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:45:43 And only uses 1 tnt block
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:46:09 ^
events-chat 2022-01-09 03:46:29 All my torpedoes are 2 blocks wide with 4 tnt blocks
events-chat 2022-01-09 04:02:50 If the size restrictions are 20x20x50 then what side is the 50
events-chat 2022-01-09 04:04:16 Which is it!?
events-chat 2022-01-09 04:06:11 Y
events-chat 2022-01-09 04:51:58 I mean it looks more like you went looks then you did for practicality
events-chat 2022-01-09 05:57:11 am going more fora
events-chat 2022-01-09 05:57:29 tankier approach
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:00:38 ur
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:00:56 not good
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:16:02 Only propellers
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:16:20 And water wheels I think
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:16:39 Though I find water wheels are to small to work effectively
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:18:23 Yea, to small
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:18:40 There should be a 5x5 water wheel
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:19:17 Who seriously builds ship that is 3 blocks tall
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:20:07 the ones
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:20:24 on the steam ships
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:20:48 y e s
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:21:45 Not doing that, they just need a 5x5 water wheel
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:22:19 Coming when I‚Äôm 83
events-chat 2022-01-09 06:22:37 Plane crazy 2 taking very long time
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:32:12 is there any way I could use 7 cutters instead of 6
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:32:54 d a m n
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:33:22 yes, 6, and I always make the front of my ship out of cutters so I can ram others
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:34:31 
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:35:27 gonna make this
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:35:56 it's a frigate
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:36:28 it;s gonna be only 6 blocks tall at the front and 4 at the back
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:37:21 n o
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:38:07 idk I think small boats are over rated in this when I look at the restrictions
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:38:24 bigger boats seem ideal
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:39:25 I mean, there's no lava spitters allowed, only, 6 cutters,
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:39:50 any boat that dies to 1 rocket isn't good
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:40:07 do you have bullet deflectors?
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:40:38 o k
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:44:01 why aren't we allowed to use the whole plot
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:44:18 length, why 50 instead of 52
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:44:38 yea but what difference does 2 blocks make!?
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:45:22 I just wanna be able to use the whole length
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:47:15 who do I message for exceptions?
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:47:46 I use individual blocks because cool
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:48:04 I want the length except so i can add a 3 block long flag at the end
events-chat 2022-01-10 01:48:35 because I can and I don't see the harm of it since it provides no unfair protection
events-chat 2022-01-11 22:19:37 Why is there like
events-chat 2022-01-11 22:19:55 3 submissions that clearly violate the restrictions posted in <#917397949938548736>
events-chat 2022-01-12 00:01:23 idk what I am gonna build
events-chat 2022-01-12 00:01:46 I started on 2 boats, gave up on 2 boats and now just have 2 unfinished boats and no idea what to build
events-chat 2022-01-12 04:07:46 I'm almost done my boat
events-chat 2022-01-12 04:08:18 I don't plan on getting caught with no propellors
events-chat 2022-01-12 04:08:37 if I lose it's gonna be because I get killed or my seat gets destroyed
events-chat 2022-01-12 13:37:40 I think the ‚Äúbig Chungus‚Äù boat will win
events-chat 2022-01-12 13:38:16 Yea
events-chat 2022-01-12 13:39:53 Doesn‚Äôt really matter since it be fast
events-chat 2022-01-12 13:41:07 Faster then my mom apparently, which is very fast
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:22:54 Why everyone making lame small low to the water fast boats
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:23:13 That‚Äôs lameeeeee
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:23:45 That‚Äôs kinda stupid aswell
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:24:17 Nope
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:25:12 The point of having big ships is to fit as many guns as possible with as much protection as possible, making a 3 fold ship would give you protection but it wouldn‚Äôt provide more guns as we already have such a limited amount of weapons to use that rally they could all fit on a torpedo boat
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:25:47 If there was no limit on rockets or guns I would understand making a big ship
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:26:07 But 6 gun and 4 rocket can fit on again, torpedo boat
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:26:34 Well now u do smh
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:27:10 I did detect it
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:27:34 How
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:28:45 I got a 6 block tall 7 block wide 3 block thick on each side 20 block long boat
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:29:15 The height includes the cabin, the hull is only 4 blocks
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:31:02 Your boat can also be blown up in 1 rocket I assume though
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:33:10 If it‚Äôs beam construction then it‚Äôs long?
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:34:13 Building with beam lame, build if block so when you get hit with rocket block explode off!!!
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:34:45 My boat only goes 25 speed
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:35:21 Though
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:35:38 I will be increasing my boat‚Äôs speed
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:35:55 To like, 75.
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:36:12 It‚Äôs a small arena idk why you guys want such speedy boats
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:36:45 Why is nobody making an aircraft carrier is the real question
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:37:14 Because then I can shoot the big thing
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:37:31 Just make a really thick hull, easy
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:37:49 10 blocks thick üòé
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:38:15 I have a boat that is 8 blocks thick on each side and it doesn‚Äôt sink so I think the aircraft carrier would be good
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:39:58 It usually kills small boats before it dies
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:44:06 I use rudder turning because cool and yes
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:48:33 I don‚Äôt like the idea of having 1 or 2 propellers because If 1 shot hits it then I lose, so I got 8
events-chat 2022-01-12 14:48:51 8 propellers
events-chat 2022-01-12 15:55:57 how many propellors is enough
events-chat 2022-01-12 15:56:46 no..
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:00:12 but I still only go 31 speed is the problem, so is more needed?
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:03:08 that would require taking off blocks
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:09:34 rbk
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:09:58 is there a limit to how many propellors I ccan have
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:10:39 also my turn radius is a bit big for the arena
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:11:12 how would I get it to turn quicker
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:11:51 I use rudders
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:14:44 also when you make sea mines
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:15:03 do the mines have to be attached to the boat and then let go? or can they spawn in the water?
events-chat 2022-01-12 16:27:12 well that's easy though
events-chat 2022-01-12 18:27:26 h o w
events-chat 2022-01-12 19:26:55 I suppose  will try
events-chat 2022-01-13 00:43:09 Oh god you‚Äôre dead
events-chat 2022-01-13 00:43:26 Gonna be so many small boats firing at you
events-chat 2022-01-13 00:44:05 Not smart, what if that 1 turret gets hit with a rocket?
events-chat 2022-01-13 00:44:29 I plan on having 2, 3 gun turrets
events-chat 2022-01-13 00:47:48 If you say so
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:16:32 oh
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:16:55 you aswell, suffer from "I use mincrosoft capture to record things because it's what my PC came with" syndrome
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:18:51 I was responding to this man
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:20:02 this man made a master piece as we can see
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:26:39 if you consider that boat target practice you are gonna enjoy my boat
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:26:56 except mine is faster
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:27:14 mine goes 50
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:27:46 no I could easily make my boat alot faster it's just I don't want to
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:28:07 I had my boat at 73 speed, I just lowered it
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:28:24 to fast for such a small arena
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:30:11 my boat is more then 1 block above the water because I am cool
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:30:28 it is 4 blocks above the water at its highest point
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:31:58 I had mine at 73
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:32:14 but I decided it was to fast for the small arena so I lowered it
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:32:43 lemme go on the game and check
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:36:09 9 blocks wide, 9.5 blocks tall, 29 blocks long.
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:37:23 I had a bigger boat
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:37:53 but I thought that, if the only weapons that are allowed is 4 rockets and 6 guns then why have such a fat boat?
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:39:18 here is one of my unfinished original builds for the event:
events-chat 2022-01-13 02:41:06 same

the-dump 2022-11-15 03:33:27 You are making the very common and understandable mistake of mixing up the very similar being gay and being British
the-dump 2022-11-23 21:46:11 We don‚Äôt need or want an infinite ocean so he‚Äôs wasting his own time making that really
the-dump 2022-11-23 21:46:43 Also
the-dump 2022-11-23 21:46:46 So what
the-dump 2022-11-23 21:47:08 He still isn‚Äôt updating the community
the-dump 2022-11-23 21:47:11 At all
the-dump 2022-11-23 21:47:26 He‚Äôs giving deadlines and then when they pass and still no game he says nothing about it
the-dump 2022-11-23 21:49:21 Nuh uh
the-dump 2022-11-23 21:49:32 Not nearly enough block choice in plane crazy rn
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:42:20 I think this man is wrong.
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:42:45 How
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:42:51 Do you work at a car company
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:43:08 So
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:43:15 So
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:44:16 Okay then you realize that modern trucks have bigger beds then ur 1998 Chevy

the-dump 2022-12-19 23:45:16 My dad does
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:45:18 Always has
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:45:24 Has owned many
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:45:27 Many many trucks

the-dump 2022-12-19 23:46:56 Keep in mind this man drives it every day for his work, for multiple hours a day
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:47:07 Over the span of about 16 years this is
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:47:31 Yea but my dad wouldn‚Äôt use a 1998
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:47:35 It‚Äôs not big enough
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:48:09 And only 2 seats
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:48:13 It‚Äôd never work
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:48:38 Yes u do
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:48:48 What if u can‚Äôt get something wet
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:49:08 Or what if it‚Äôs to breakable
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:49:13 Or what if there isn‚Äôt any space
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:49:47 A 1998 Chevy Silverado is to small for his use at all
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:49:58 Welll then ur wrong
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:50:02 Contractor
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:50:35 This man? Wrong
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:51:16 My dad owns his contracting company and does work u would usually contract out because it saves money
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:51:53 Yes
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:52:08 No
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:52:10 It isn‚Äôt
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:52:17 No it isn‚Äôt
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:52:30 How else is he gonna take all the wood he carries
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:52:38 He takes so much wood he hooks up a trailer
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:52:43 He‚Äôll have doors and windows
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:52:47 In the back of his truck
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:52:55 His entire back seat
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:53:00 Is usually tools and stuff
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:53:25 So yes one needs a truck
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:53:38 It isn‚Äôt a joke
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:54:11 For the amount he does u do
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:54:16 But why
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:54:18 Would u get
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:54:21 A 20 foot
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:54:23 Trailer

the-dump 2022-12-19 23:55:37 Yea so put a marker on them oh my goddd
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:56:23 Because ur trailer is overly small
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:56:30 Bed*
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:56:40 1998 Chevy truck bed having person
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:57:42 Obviously not
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:57:57 You can‚Äôt take that in a truck
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:58:12 20 foot long board when does one need that
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:59:02 Then take smaller boards
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:59:11 You don‚Äôt need a 20 foot long board
the-dump 2022-12-19 23:59:25 There‚Äôs no use for it
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:00:35 Then why did u say 20 foot long bed
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:00:58 U said cargo bed
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:01:19 Mmmm

the-dump 2022-12-20 00:03:03 Transport truck
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:03:06 Thing
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:05:18 Okay I don‚Äôt think anyone cares about ur opinion at this point ur pretty much just gate keeping with trucks
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:06:12 Ur not
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:06:15 Ur really not
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:06:36 People can own whatever they want
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:06:59 Man pulling the age card
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:07:09 This man? Truck gate keeping
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:07:40 You ARE
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:08:08 Modern trucks don‚Äôt suck
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:08:13 I have
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:08:16 Bigger beds
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:08:32 Prove it
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:08:57 Prove they can‚Äôt support as much as ur precious 20 year old Chevy
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:10:45 Yes I do
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:10:53 I‚Äôm doing it aren‚Äôt I
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:11:32 My dad has moved ATV‚Äôs with his truck before and it‚Äôs a ford and there have been 0 problems
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:12:26 BECAUSE I DON‚ÄôT OWN A TRUCK
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:12:33 I‚ÄôM NOT 18
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:12:55 That‚Äôs illegal
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:13:38 It says u need to be atleast 16 in Iowa to drive a car
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:14:34 So
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:14:38 All this more experience
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:14:39 Is
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:14:44 1 years worth of driving
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:15:46 Untrue
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:15:54 I‚Äôve driven a truck before
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:16:04 In an abandoned parking lot
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:16:11 10/10 counts
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:16:27 It‚Äôs something though so it‚Äôs not none
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:17:11 Or is it
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:19:09 You literally have a single year of driving experience
the-dump 2022-12-20 00:19:23 Not even a full liscense
the-dump 2022-12-20 01:42:56 Yea I‚Äôve operated ATV‚Äôs and snowmobiles for years
the-dump 2022-12-20 01:43:28 Of course I can‚Äôt I already told you I can‚Äôt drive but that is irrelevant
the-dump 2022-12-20 01:53:28 So everyone who can‚Äôt drive manual is inexperienced and cannot ever talk about vehicles
the-dump 2022-12-20 01:55:05 Doesn‚Äôt mean if you don‚Äôt know it you cannot ever talk about vehicles
the-dump 2022-12-20 01:55:16 You don‚Äôt need a liscense either to talk about vehicles
the-dump 2022-12-20 01:55:21 You can know about something
the-dump 2022-12-20 01:55:27 Without being able to do it
the-dump 2022-12-20 01:56:28 I think it‚Äôs only you
the-dump 2022-12-20 01:58:32 I am willing to bet they wouldn‚Äôt
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:05:17 Sounds like something a furry in disguise would say
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:08:05 Certified furry detector
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:08:08 Yes I am
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:08:11 Much experience
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:08:23 Projecting
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:08:27 Entirely projecting
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:08:40 So he admits it
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:08:42 He‚Äôs a furry
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:09:13 Joe Biden is a furry
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:09:18 So if ur joe Biden
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:09:23 Can‚Äôt
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:09:28 Won‚Äôt
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:09:33 I‚Äôd go to jail
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:09:42 And then my days of furry detecting would be over
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:09:59 Nuh uh
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:10:05 My job is not to kill any furries
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:10:07 It‚Äôs to simply
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:10:08 Detect
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:10:10 Them
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:10:17 Like a sonar operator
the-dump 2022-12-20 23:10:30 No that‚Äôs emo

the-dump 2022-12-23 19:43:17 I don‚Äôt believe this statistic
the-dump 2022-12-23 20:01:41 Or is it
the-dump 2022-12-23 20:30:26 Prove it then
the-dump 2022-12-23 20:30:54 Prove that atleast 51% of the server members here are furries
the-dump 2022-12-23 20:32:13 Prove that atleast 19466 people in this server are furries
the-dump 2022-12-23 21:04:28 More then half this server is not furries
the-dump 2022-12-23 21:04:50 That would mean more then half of it is
the-dump 2022-12-23 21:04:56 That is what most means
the-dump 2022-12-23 21:05:04 Most = the majority
the-dump 2022-12-23 21:05:19 Majority = more then half
the-dump 2022-12-23 21:05:30 And we‚Äôve established it isn‚Äôt more then half
the-dump 2022-12-23 22:33:21 Is illegal
