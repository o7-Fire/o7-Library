creations-chat 2022-06-15 15:00:01 the people here are brutal when it comes to rating, if it isn't a 1:1 copy of the real thing ur build is based on, people mass down vote it
creations-chat 2022-06-15 15:02:45 💀💀💀 big boy alert
creations-chat 2022-06-15 15:04:47 nah im not complaining but im just looking at decent builds and half the votes are down its just surprising, i thought there would be more tolerance

creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:07:12 but thats what it literally looks like in tradelands 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bMX84zlHrM the larger ship, this is it being used in an rp battle
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:11:31 here it is in tradelands
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:13:55 i cant because it would have to be split since my ship is folded and it would be hard to align the split ropes to eachother, ill recolour the flag
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:21:46 try make this goofy ahh airship
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:23:52 from the picture it looks like its only armament is 1 aa gun and a bomb rack
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:27:38 what, i have no idea how to use motor lock efficiently
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:30:27 nah dont because the only times i used motorlock i left all of it exposed and just did 1 motor after the other, i literally never used it because idk how to use it properly which is why all of my builds here in this server would be considered mediocre
bot-central 2022-06-15 16:39:34 ?rhelp
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:46:09 maybe ur standards are too high? half of the builds on pc are worse than that jet but idk since i have only been on pc for 32 days and 13 hrs total so maybe ur right
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:48:23 its true though, nearly all of the builds i see in ur average pc server are terrible compared to that jet
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:55:01 how much time do people have in pc to have so much experience like how many days
creations-chat 2022-06-15 16:59:22 i started playing in 2020 according to my first screenshot, wouldnt play very often since then, its awful that dont know how to do anything in plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:10:17 what, what magnets, the chess pieces are picked up by 1 magnet attached to something
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:21:52 ok instead of experimenting i will continue to build builds that i like instead of what other people like
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:23:56 didnt expect my chessboard to be liked so much, its not hard to build
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:25:57 i think they need to change it to blacknames  so its uncomfortable to say <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:28:02 then make their names white
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:30:08 you know you can be a whitename and have a better build than people with a coloured name, right????
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:32:52 the only reason coloured names exist is just for validation and ego boost like why is so much segregation based on the colour of ur name and the way you place blocks in some roblox game with a playerbase of 30k people
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:34:59 y? u can see that it has a thing picked up in the screenshot
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:37:06 but a guy who doesnt have discord could have a far better build by chance, and you can just get these ranks by submitting a large decent build <:thoink:657279634563399720>
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:39:42 whats still ugly with no details also im sure its still possible to get a rank if u just submit a half assed large build like what you probably did <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:41:43 didnt ask btw <:trollface:775024642104229898> also havent you heard of the standard going down? whitenames apparently increasing
creations-chat 2022-06-15 17:44:42 people could ask you the same question if they took 1 glance at ur "about me" section

creations-chat 2022-06-16 08:46:05 it looks much smaller than expected like when i saw the huge front, i expected a very long rear but it looks like it got cut off and replaced with this itty bitty rear that can't hold anything
creations-chat 2022-06-16 08:48:08 your dirty mind
creations-chat 2022-06-16 08:50:18 make the rear slightly hang over from the wheels but not too much since thats what real trucks have
creations-chat 2022-06-16 08:52:42 and maybe with ur smart design skills, cover up the suspension of the back wheels with something
creations-chat 2022-06-16 09:00:50 yes that's good 10/10 better than anything i could come up with
creations-chat 2022-06-16 09:02:51 does ur truck use motor lock

the-dump 2022-06-17 20:08:19 
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:08:23 that
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:09:23 k
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:09:36 i think it was gammarad
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:10:45 yes it was
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:13:59 u serious
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:14:09 for fucks sake i have to build the left side over
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:15:00 maybe i should be lazy and extend it with pistons
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:15:59 does that mean i also need to make the wheels wider to fit thicker tread
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:16:51 would u say the wheels are wide enough
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:17:27 ok
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:17:33 ill make it fatter
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:17:54 the amount of wheels is right tho, 23 on each side according to another photo
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:19:26 why couldn't the germans call it "your mother"
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:19:29 so fat
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:19:54 post somewhere else and ping me
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:21:48 <@877391100137070625> u sure it isnt wide enough? also the longer wheel is the wider one
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:21:52 should it be wider
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:22:08 
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:22:19 the wheel?
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:22:25 what about the vehicle
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:22:52 aint no blueprint for this
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:23:03 there are a few different renditions
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:23:11 this wideness
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:23:12 
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:23:24 this wideness (this is what i want for it)
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:23:56 i think its about as wide as in this
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:24:06 im just looking for the wideness of the space inbetween the wheels
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:24:14 i think its good enough <@877391100137070625>
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:24:30 
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:24:40 actually nah a little bit wier
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:24:41 wider
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:24:44 pistons will do it for me
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:25:37 from the scale of the person in the drawing i think it should be wider
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:25:49 i might run out of motors for the treads
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:25:53 since its so fucking wide
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:26:13 
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:27:51 i will keep it like that since according to a few photos i looked at it would be too wide
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:27:57 not like this
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:28:20 i hope 900 motors will be enough
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:28:31 actually only 861
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:35:36 yes
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:35:47 the picture makes it have the illusion that its wider
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:35:55 so yeah its as wide as the other renditions
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:37:07 yeah probably
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:37:13 i added in 2 pistons to make it just a little bit wider
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:37:18 to have it roscale
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:38:24 the tracks make up nearly 2/3 of the wideness
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:38:49 i hope i have enough motors to make the treads
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:39:04 ill have to use gamma's tread fold technique
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:39:13 more like the krupp pub
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:39:37 its theorised that the p1500 monster was just an engineer after having a few drinks
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:39:47 or that its just a hoax made up by someone
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:40:08 yes
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:40:28 the cranes on it are wider than a maus 💀
the-dump 2022-06-17 20:41:15 i hope it will be able to offroad once finished
