creations-chat 2019-01-19 15:05:28 Grumman F6F painted German. Used with the assist of Super Rockets, it is very fast.
bug-reports 2019-01-19 15:11:58 Try rotating the beam 180 degrees, and it should come up as green on the block you need to place the beam on. The reason why this works is because of your cursor. <@!279238155498946560>
bug-reports 2019-01-19 15:14:04 This is not really a bug. You can fix it by rotating the beam 180 degrees. Then, try placing it on the block/beam you need.
