creations-chat 2021-07-15 19:10:20 these treads are part of the vehicle, they are not separate parts, so there is no need to put guards to protect the tread from sliding over the cylinder.
creations-chat 2021-07-15 19:14:49 I use suspensions with unpowered motor to secure the treads to the vehicle
creations-chat 2021-07-15 19:17:36 oooooh veery cool dude

creations-chat 2021-12-09 18:26:02 This one is my Snow antarctic cruiser project, this vehicle was created in real life around the year 1938 in the USA with the objective of crossing Antarctica (as its name says), it is a large truck with a peculiar shape of hot dog and with giant wheels to help him pass through holes and ravines in the ice, he had an airplane attached to him to help him in missions that the truck couldn't accomplish, in mine I haven't done it, but I intend to do it in soon :)
creations-chat 2021-12-09 18:28:11 The original in real life
creations-chat 2021-12-09 18:31:39 take it easy friend, this is one of my first projects copying something from real life, normally I just make mechanisms that come out of my head
creations-chat 2021-12-09 18:34:24 I'm not even the first, I've seen such a project on google images while I was looking for real models to copy
creations-chat 2021-12-09 18:36:29 I know it's just a representation, I thought this photo was better to give an explanation of what I wanted to show
creations-chat 2021-12-09 18:38:48 lol
creations-chat 2021-12-09 18:41:04 mine is a little more complex than just the construction, I made a suspension system that helps me to climb in some places, like the airport building or some steep hill, like the original, and I saw that you've done a lot of snow cruisers, stop making fun of me ;-;
creations-chat 2021-12-09 18:43:15 my friend compared it to that too lol
creations-chat 2021-12-09 20:12:26 it's not rope, it's piston, rotor and suspension
creations-chat 2021-12-09 20:15:25 thx
creations-chat 2021-12-09 20:17:29 I just needed a suspension that would raise and lower, so I used a piston
creations-chat 2021-12-09 20:26:49 yes but I didn't want to, because it's slow and it wouldn't fit in my design because it's very tight in the space between the wheels and the vehicle and the piston has toogle mode so I don't need to hold it to fully extend
