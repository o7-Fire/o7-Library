help 2023-06-26 20:59:40 how do you get a rocket to yaw and pitch? i've tried it with mine using propellers  (im not experienced with rockets) and when i tried to pitch it more of an angle on its x axis, it just reverted back to its original position and swayed slightly

creations-chat 2023-06-28 13:23:00 first rocket ship
yaya
(Artemis I, yes i know the hover thrusters look stupid but its the only way i could get it to actually perform a propulsive landing without parachutes or anchors)
(also i'd like a some feedback, thanks)
creations-chat 2023-06-28 13:25:05 too large for that tip there (it hits build limit, and idk how to fold), but i can try and fix that
(and make it align)

creations-chat 2023-06-28 14:54:39 w.i.p delta II, anything i could improve?
(haven't added the interstages yet)
creations-chat 2023-06-28 14:56:56 build height, and idk how to fold and its very confusing (even if i tried to learn, in which i did try)
creations-chat 2023-06-28 15:22:33 why does this happen?
when i disconnect at the interstage and the 1st stage just rams through and into the 2nd stage
creations-chat 2023-06-28 15:34:14 fixed it, made the reverse thruster to originally help with this on/off mode only, which allowed it to immediately disconnect
creations-chat 2023-06-28 16:18:27 yeah, just figured that out
(i made all the thrusters decrease button the button for 2nd stage deploy, so that the stage 1 thrusters atleast slow down so it doesnt ram into it)
