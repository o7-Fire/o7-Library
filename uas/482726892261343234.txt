help 2021-09-06 05:23:19 so rn i have a fairly compact aircraft but i don't know what do do for functional landing gear. it has a rudder on the underside, so the actual block will not work while currently i use an idea similar to the me-163's detaching landing gear cart
help 2021-09-06 05:24:00 to be able to take off and land, yes. right now i use a detaching wheel cart
help 2021-09-06 05:26:22 the problem is tht i dont have much to remove due to it being my first major motorlock build
help 2021-09-06 05:26:33 i probably couldve done it different, but yeah
