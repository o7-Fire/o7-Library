help 2019-01-02 16:08:32 Can someone tell me how to make a good train chassis?
help 2019-01-02 16:12:03 a good way is using suspension springs on the wheels but there's a better way
help 2019-01-02 16:15:07 i dont know
help 2019-01-02 16:15:32 there's a train contest on right now try looking in <#504630451579781121> they will be using good chassis
help 2019-01-02 16:39:37 <@!434967120393273357> I've figured out how to make the trains turn https://streamable.com/6dr1r

help 2019-01-02 21:50:48 How do you make tank tracks?
help 2019-01-02 22:08:56 I sort of made a prototype https://streamable.com/1ns19
help 2019-01-02 22:14:01 Main issue is the treads bunching up and folding over one another but it works overall
help 2019-01-02 22:14:10 I haven't tested it on an actual vehicle though.
help 2019-01-02 22:18:10 I'm going to implement it to a very basic chassis and see if it works
help 2019-01-02 22:35:09 https://streamable.com/l2ivq
help 2019-01-02 22:35:50 It works with vehicles, though it is by no means a smooth ride. The only issues to fix now are making it roll smoothly and implementing a system to prevent the tracks from falling off the rollers
help 2019-01-02 22:38:53 and a tendency for tracks to fold up and jam when switching between moving forward and reversing, causing unwanted turning
help 2019-01-02 22:41:38 the tanks also tend to jam up completely when attempting to traverse any sort of hill
help 2019-01-02 22:41:51 although they remain functional when moving downhill
help 2019-01-02 22:53:19 Given the nature of the rollers it is difficult to implement a system to prevent the tracks from sliding/falling off
help 2019-01-02 22:54:03 and the tracks have serious issues with grip and are highly prone to sliding
help 2019-01-02 22:54:19 which makes them unable to traverse vertical terrains
help 2019-01-02 23:03:48 <@367588891777171466> Thanks, that actually really helps the whole grip situation ðŸ˜„

help 2019-01-02 23:07:24 I put half-wedges on the tracks to see if they would have a difference but I have no clue
help 2019-01-02 23:10:48 I also got the tracks to go smoothly
help 2019-01-02 23:13:15 nevermind, the tracks just jam up with cylinder rotators it needs to be half block
help 2019-01-02 23:16:36 These are my tracks XD
help 2019-01-02 23:18:00 fluctuates between 15-25 SPS for me lol
help 2019-01-02 23:18:50 does it work on uneven terrain?

help 2019-01-03 21:31:43 they stop working
help 2019-01-03 21:32:01 sometimes it causes it to spin or the plane just stops moving
help 2019-01-03 21:32:25 yea magnet drives

help 2019-01-04 15:22:23 Is there a way to make an airship (helium blocks) float but still be able to control it going up/down
help 2019-01-04 15:52:34 you need a motor underneath the base to allow it to spin
help 2019-01-04 15:52:53 and where the actual barrel is, put motors on the sides to allow you to aim up and down

help 2019-01-07 21:20:50 i cant it will unbalance the center of mass / lift
help 2019-01-07 21:26:44 shouldn't there be a separate thing for center of thrust though?
help 2019-01-07 21:27:01 there's lift for wings and weight, but there should be center of thrust for engines
