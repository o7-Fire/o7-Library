The Tale of Tu-22URM3 "Ogon'ki" (726040427190288395)
bug-reports 2021-08-31 12:05:23 hello? im need help. im know new bug or old or hacks? i dont know! all my buildings that were built within 12-24 hours have been removed! time rolled back and I had old buildings! Background: I went to the servers again to see the reaction of the players to my construction (and yes, I wasn't bragging, I was just wondering how the players would react) the time was 3 am Moscow time (August 31), I go to the server, I see that I was asleep in the field and 5-6 more people were also standing! and when I looked into the preserved buildings-nothing was preserved! as if the time was rolled back! maybe the date didn't load up and maybe even worse! there are no screenshots and no video recordings either! please explain! what was that?!
bug-reports 2021-08-31 12:07:50 it's still lucky for me that I didn't build much in a day! and what could it be if I built something grandiose?!
