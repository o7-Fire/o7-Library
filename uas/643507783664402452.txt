[FUNCTION]

Speed triggers, hence the name, it will trigger when it hits a certain speed. This should be added to all configurable blocks (motors, pistons, etc)
0 = no trigger, just keybind
1 - 1000... = trigger, no keybind.

Concept : (made by me)

creations-chat 2020-10-10 16:58:47 Oh, Oof.
creations-chat 2020-10-10 17:00:21 Oh, so, you input the speed (max 10000) and it will disable the keybind in place. So, for E.G, if you put ‚Äú100‚Äù or something onto it, the minute your speed goes to 100 it will activate, and stay like that, ofc until you go slower than the set speed.

the-dump 2020-12-03 00:31:43 Oki doki, kinda harsh.
the-dump 2020-12-03 00:32:28 I bet you, I can find 3+ times people have done this, and get no blacklist.
the-dump 2020-12-03 00:32:41 Atleast I haven‚Äôt been blacklisted from *everything*
the-dump 2020-12-03 00:34:58 Great example. v
the-dump 2020-12-03 00:35:24 Not to be the snowflake I am or anything, but that‚Äôs kinda unfair.
the-dump 2020-12-03 00:36:17 Exactly.
the-dump 2020-12-03 00:37:40 Yeah, it was supposed to be a joke, clearly the mods can‚Äôt take a lil‚Äô fun.
the-dump 2020-12-03 00:39:05 Dw grim, it‚Äôs just be being a snowflake towards a mod being a snowflake (no offence, if your reading this.)
the-dump 2020-12-03 00:39:52 I mean, yeah, but still. It was supposed to be a lil- wait what?

the-dump 2020-12-03 00:40:45 But look.
the-dump 2020-12-03 00:41:09 I said basically the same thing, just rephrased.
the-dump 2020-12-03 00:41:26 And the mod took it as an offence.
the-dump 2020-12-03 00:42:16 Because This is for random stuff, if I posted it on general the mods will go on one again. <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
the-dump 2020-12-03 00:43:39 There should be blacklist appeals, but ofc, I can‚Äôt suggest. <:pain:644301805534183464>

the-dump 2021-02-02 00:40:13 No, thank you.
bug-reports 2021-02-11 18:41:48 I found a glitch, of when I press + hold "E" (fly up) on my creation, everything disappears for a second, then reappears. my trouble with this though, is that it cuts off all interaction with thrusters and hover parts.
bug-reports 2021-02-11 18:42:36 I've used 6 hover parts and 6 thrusters.
bug-reports 2021-02-11 18:43:05 This happens frequently.
bug-reports 2021-02-11 18:44:02 I just found out "G" (disconnect disconnectors?) also does this.
bug-reports 2021-02-11 18:50:06 flip doesnt work either.

the-dump 2021-04-04 11:53:41 oh, basically, in the song "Everywhere at the end of time" (song about dementia) it has six stages, as the six stages of dementia. in it, theres a theme that people have used for a creepy meme called "Blood floats on blood" about a trollface waiting for it to "blood" (rain blood) and the trollface covers itself in blood and starts flying in a very creepy manner with people screaming in the background. I just hit that theme and I've been waiting 6 hours and 24 minutes just for it. I originally listened to the song to test how **emotionally stable** I am, since streamers have cried to it. as you can guess, the music gets progressively worse each stage.

the-dump 2022-03-05 20:00:40 device issue
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:00:58 fps issue
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:01:53 no its not lol
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:03:07 but custom wheels, bigger and better map and generally nicer to play
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:03:44 (no offense to pc) better train wheels. actually has a slant instead of just 3 cylinders put together
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:03:53 (pls no ban)
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:04:15 one downside, but doesnt really affect me.

the-dump 2022-03-05 20:54:02 <@!399470016807960586> <@!403843930543882241> i just realised you can motorlock with a Dynamic Offsetter
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:54:44 motorlocking is even easier and better in VC than PC
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:54:48 NAH
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:55:05 lol compare 10 odd locked motors to a simple block
the-dump 2022-03-05 20:55:36 (dynamic offsetter can move between -3 and 3 blocks)
