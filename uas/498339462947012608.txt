The Tale of ryz_vik (498339462947012608)
help 2021-09-01 07:22:48 Uhh, I have some problems with conveyor drives, it works fine but after sometime (I exhausted it or overused it) it usually flings me into the Shadow Zone as I like to call it, do anybody have a fix for this?
help 2021-09-01 07:23:41 it usually only appears in my smaller builds using it, though.
help 2021-09-01 07:30:23 oh well
help 2021-09-01 07:30:33 its time to spam alot of hoverdrives instead
help 2021-09-01 08:07:57 looks pog for me
help 2021-09-01 08:09:21 I need something to cover the motorhole under the front part of the cockpit, do you have any ideas?
help 2021-09-01 08:11:31 i mean, I do have motorlock but its already full, so i guess its just the disconnector or i live with it

help 2022-03-05 14:09:12 uhhh what do you mean
help 2022-03-05 14:09:44 try setting dampening up and stiffness up
help 2022-03-05 14:09:48 don't put too much of it though
help 2022-03-05 14:09:53 otherwise you'll bounce
help 2022-03-05 14:10:12 i'm more a mini jet builder so I don't really have any fields in this but I hope that it could help
help 2022-03-05 14:10:29 try setting your plane's suspension
help 2022-03-05 14:10:34 add more dampening and stiffness i guess
help 2022-03-05 14:10:41 oh and ropes
help 2022-03-05 14:10:54 put them next to the suspension so they don't go bouncing all over the place
help 2022-03-05 14:11:07 yeah thats good
help 2022-03-05 14:11:21 add some more stiffness to your suspension with the function tool
help 2022-03-05 14:11:49 i still need ideas <:4Weird:709084058721714324>
help 2022-03-05 14:15:51 hmm
help 2022-03-05 14:16:12 did you try putting the free length up?
creations-chat 2022-03-05 14:26:02 Just 2-3 things that I have to say:
-The wing is kind of oversized
-The elevator is a legit triangle??
and maybe the pointy nose but depends on how you look at it
overall great though
<@!598480813050560512>
creations-chat 2022-03-05 14:45:33 its fine, you did good
creations-chat 2022-03-25 03:18:42 I'll try to work on that
I also added a bit of light for picture illumination, seems like it's not enough, but too much and it looks bad
creations-chat 2022-03-25 03:23:35 im way too lazy to fix that ðŸ’€
creations-chat 2022-03-25 03:29:01 <#478584971670454284>
