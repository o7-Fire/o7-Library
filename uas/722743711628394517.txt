help 2021-08-24 18:29:50 like passenger plane biplane or just tryna make jet
help 2021-08-24 18:30:33 start with nose its easier but if u feel more confident doing other parts first then go
help 2021-08-24 18:31:50 like this
Half blocks -> |
Half Wedge -> \
help 2021-08-24 18:31:58 then half blocks
help 2021-08-24 18:32:01 and repeat
help 2021-08-24 18:32:08 to other side
help 2021-08-24 18:32:38 do some jets tutorial first i guess it also helps u make jets better
help 2021-08-24 18:33:04 the one on half block i mostly used

help 2021-08-24 18:39:02 just like train wheel but conveyor is the cylinder and the 1x0.9 block is the circle connector to cylinder
help 2021-08-24 18:39:31 make it small but make sure theres 1 block space inside
help 2021-08-24 18:39:44 so u can add rocket engines inside it
