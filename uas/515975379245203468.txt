help 2020-11-07 20:18:06 ✅  Completely normal solution
creations-chat 2020-11-07 20:25:59 I'm going to be very harsh here: It's terrible, the design is boxy and ugly, wing panels are poorly strapped on, every engine is very exposed, and I just don't like it. <@!683105477000822875>
creations-chat 2020-11-07 20:31:43 Start fresh and make a simple plane 3 blocks wide and tall.
creations-chat 2020-11-07 20:33:13 Make large, individual wings, and have either all of your engines inside your build or a few, large ones. <@!683105477000822875> Enlargen your airframe and make it more plane-like.

help 2020-11-10 17:50:18 Okay, so I'm trying to make custom control panels, but when I try to turn both motor 2's go in a single direction instead of one going downwards and the other upwards. This is making my plane very unstable, what do I do?
help 2020-11-10 17:55:27 Changing keybinds has not helped since I am using motor 2, I have both set to inverted, when I set one to regular it can turn and roll properly but can't fly up properly, and when I change both to regular they just don't work, what do I do, do I instead use normal motors or?
help 2020-11-10 18:02:38 This is what is happening to my plane, what should I do?

creations-chat 2020-11-18 14:49:03 Make the front have a bunch of motorlocked explosives and cutters, and make it detachable so you could fly up into the air and rain down explosive shrapnel upon your enemies.

creations-chat 2020-11-24 18:46:22 Suspension is non-existant, I like the back enough to give it a single like for that photo.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 16:44:16 <@!707255933201416304> That ship looks better than all of Guardians' storyline.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 16:45:54 I'd say it ranks an entire 40 seconds of ODST soundtrack, better than Reach gameplay.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 16:48:23 That's a solid 40 seconds of ODST soundtrack for sure.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 16:49:57 Hmm, Maybe like, a Seraph or CCS.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 16:51:52 Hmm, maybe one of the larger Prowlers, like the Point Blank.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:07:05 Creations, despite not having "expert" in its name, has very high expectations and standards. Admittedly some people's standards are either way too high or way too low, and some people are actually "toxic" and downvote everything out of spite of their own creations being downvoted, though they either get shunned or creations blacklisted.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:12:26 He said *Triangle*, which I don't think you can make. Haven't played for a while, can't check.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:14:22 Motorlock does solve pretty much everything, from turrets to wedge 1x7.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:16:52 Wonder what's wrong with <@!630182372444209182> 's T90, it's not even that very, very terrible. Probably the bulkiness and exposed motorlock but nobody has said anything about it so far.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:18:56 Apparently the catcher is better than the T90, despite the hard work and motorlock.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:20:28 Also, we have PVP that isn't trash doo doo (Still bad, and needs a rework after the rewrite that takes forever)
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:22:08 They already have, just some stupid point and click cannons though, and melee weapons and a few ranged ones too.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:23:46 Clunky, needs to fill in patches at the front and fuselage, but not the worst at all.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:25:44 The engine is pretty spot on, and there's custom control panels, which is nice. I can't see much of the motorlock so overall it's pretty good. The cockpit is absolute fire, I love how it blends with the fuselage.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:28:55 Just high contrast on his PC, not really filtered. Also, the front looks realistic on the car, probably why.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:31:47 Lighting.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:34:33 Motorlock is simple, just a stairway pattern. I'd show you it in a simple, digestible emoji form, but my PC would send it if I tried.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:37:35 It's a way of life, I know.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:39:40 Like, snapping a cockpit with the base of the plane, compacting tank turrets, shapes like round balls, etc.
creations-chat 2020-11-30 17:41:14 Yes.
