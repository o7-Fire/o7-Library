creations-chat 2021-01-31 01:33:20 Ok.
creations-chat 2021-01-31 01:35:29 I sent more pictures of my tank.
creations-chat 2021-01-31 01:37:30 <@!651950786955313153> You should add more wedges to it, too blocky. For example, the front can use 1X1 - 1X4 Wedges for a less blocky apearance.
creations-chat 2021-01-31 01:40:17 If there were no wedges there, then it would be blocky, add wedges to make it less blocky and ugly.
creations-chat 2021-01-31 01:44:24 Try revamping it just like what Dragonplatinum would do so to his own creations that were made a long time ago.

bug-reports 2021-01-31 08:02:18 I was shooting fireworks at the spaceship, the fireworks went straight up.
bug-reports 2021-01-31 08:04:54 
bug-reports 2021-02-01 02:30:28 His turret is shooting at me, even though there are no guns/missles pointed at me.
bug-reports 2021-02-01 02:30:30 The missles went through, please fix Close-Tracking when I shoot the missles in a perfect line, they go out on multiple directions, splitting apart then grouping back and hitting the ground. They also hit the ground instead. The tracking is also delayed.
bug-reports 2021-02-01 03:55:31 How do I unghost?
