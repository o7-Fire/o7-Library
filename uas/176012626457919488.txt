creations-chat 2019-07-21 05:02:09 with the exeption of the 7 turrets I've added onto it
creations-chat 2019-07-21 05:03:11 "ChezThunderDashToday at 12:53 AM
first ship, wanted something bigger, 100% no idea what I was doing for 18 hours"
creations-chat 2019-07-21 05:05:27 I wouldn't be even posting it because some random dude out of 60 people who seen it being built said "you should join this discord and post it bla bla bla."
creations-chat 2019-07-21 05:08:17 what
creations-chat 2019-07-21 05:09:24 no I'm talking about my IJN furutaka I just posted after making it for 18 hours
creations-chat 2019-07-21 06:06:46 Stridel I wanted something with 3 guns instead of 2 and well it turned into that
creations-chat 2019-07-21 06:07:50 Its my first boat, I spent 18 hours not knowing what to do, especially with the turrets
creations-chat 2019-07-21 06:08:57 I used reference photos, then I discovered that the boat was too long, I created it backwards, etc etc.
creations-chat 2019-07-21 06:09:08 first boat, whatever I tried to make it work
creations-chat 2019-07-21 06:09:26 I use war thunders
creations-chat 2019-07-21 06:10:19 They have a preview of everything in the game, I just used that to my advantage
creations-chat 2019-07-21 06:11:16 I can get 360 horizontally not vertically
creations-chat 2019-07-21 06:11:28 more like 180 vertically because of the water
creations-chat 2019-07-21 06:12:17 I didn't know what I was doing from the start. so I tried it, and apparently here it is shit
creations-chat 2019-07-21 06:13:05 I'm saying fuck it and its done, I don't wanna work on that nightmare anymore.
creations-chat 2019-07-21 06:13:33 it looks good to me, to my friends, and thats all the compliments I need.
creations-chat 2019-07-21 06:13:59 I only even joined this server because some random recommended it
creations-chat 2019-07-21 06:14:33 I have a high standard but if things go wrong I don't give a shit anymore.
creations-chat 2019-07-21 06:14:47 especially if theres more than 10 problems
creations-chat 2019-07-21 06:16:10 ^
creations-chat 2019-07-21 06:16:36 I tried to make everything functional and look good at the same time for all my builds
creations-chat 2019-07-21 06:18:20 I didn't upload my maus because it would have to be a bigger scale to even make it work, but its practical and looks like a maus
creations-chat 2019-07-21 06:18:58 I can't make another boat anyway because I poured so much into that boat.
creations-chat 2019-07-23 13:02:56 Meteor Mk. 8
creations-chat 2019-07-23 13:03:05 (top view)
creations-chat 2019-07-23 13:22:06 yeah nitro classic
creations-chat 2019-07-23 13:23:24 I just wanted the perks, not the discord games because theres only 1 free game I want and I'll be spending 5$ more a month for a game that is originally 5$
creations-chat 2019-07-23 13:25:20 yeah, I didn't wanna spend another $5 for 2 more perks that I don't need
creations-chat 2019-07-23 13:25:46 I just wanted the gif profile pic and the emoji's
