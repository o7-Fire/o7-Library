bug-reports 2022-05-15 01:42:14 question,are internal plane crazy bugs able to be fixed,because my missiles havent been working for 3 months and i really wanna pvp again
bug-reports 2022-05-15 01:55:11 so they cant be fixed?
bug-reports 2022-05-15 01:56:13 not even on  the devs end?
bug-reports 2022-05-15 15:21:12 for some reason my missiles work on mobile but not a computer
bug-reports 2022-05-15 15:23:10 its an internal plane crazy bug
bug-reports 2022-05-15 15:27:02 also,for some reason they work on mobile
