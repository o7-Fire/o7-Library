creations-chat 2022-01-06 11:36:02 what's more f-14 like?
(I'll do a motorlock wedge, so don't mind the blocks, mind about the angle)
creations-chat 2022-01-06 11:38:48 
creations-chat 2022-01-07 03:58:52 should i move the intakes back a block or make the nose longer by a block?
creations-chat 2022-01-07 04:03:25 so for the angle (i'll use motorlock angle)
should it be the left side or the right side (angle's in red)
creations-chat 2022-01-07 04:22:20 (don't mind the red)
so what y'all think?
creations-chat 2022-01-07 04:25:48 the left is now 1x3
the right is still 1x2
creations-chat 2022-01-07 11:45:17 What intake is better for my F-14? Left or right?
(Left is more accurate : Right is better looking but wider)
creations-chat 2022-01-07 11:47:24 For comparison
creations-chat 2022-01-07 11:49:59 So I've received 4 responses for my intake. So 2 picked the small intake and 2 picked the right. Time to ask a fifth
creations-chat 2022-01-07 11:52:09 i thought this was a feedback channel

creations-chat 2022-01-07 11:54:52 so, i need a tiebreaker, left or right for my f-14 intake?
creations-chat 2022-01-07 11:57:38 uncanny mr incredible
creations-chat 2022-01-07 12:00:26 instead of half block wedge, what should i use?
creations-chat 2022-01-09 10:51:23 how do i do the sweep wings for my f-14?
it has tilted intakes
creations-chat 2022-01-09 10:54:30 bruh.... it's plane crazy 💀
has there been any better f-14 noses in plane crazy?
creations-chat 2022-01-09 10:57:35 actually no... the f-14 nose you just showed me is too short
literally 4 blocks long
creations-chat 2022-01-09 11:04:21 top or bottom?
creations-chat 2022-01-10 03:31:36 left or right wing for my f-14?
creations-chat 2022-01-10 03:35:59 even tho right is more accurate, it looks a bit too fat. i think it's because it's just plane crazy

help 2022-09-29 14:31:28 Ask other people that has made ships (preferably people that has made a ship from the Nimitz class) and ask them for any tips or how did they make their ship. In addition, you can always look at images, videos, blueprints, 3d models and more of your designated ship. Finally, you can have years of practice, remake/remaster your designated ship after making it.
I’ve used all of the tactics like asking others how to be better, looking at footage and remaking and incorporating the feedback from my first attempt.
In conclusion, making anything in Plane Crazy and is willing to improve is just like making an essay
creations-chat 2023-01-09 04:50:58 <@718224997570838641> 
you can fix up these 2 areas
firstly, you can fix up the war supply area (the bridge at the bottom), you can make the gap between the bridge and the main hull less ginormous, at the moment, the gap between those 2 areas is almost as tall as the main hull itself.
secondly, you can make the connecting pieces between the front half (the hexagon shape hull) and bridge bit bigger, it looks like it's only connected by a dozen blocks
