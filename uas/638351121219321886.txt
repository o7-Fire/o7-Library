creations-chat 2021-12-17 10:25:33 ok thx alot its just that the pipes are a bit hard to make so anytips?
creations-chat 2021-12-17 10:28:32 ok
creations-chat 2021-12-17 10:30:45 oh and about the cowcatchers it makes my train not work on corners. What do I do?
creations-chat 2021-12-17 10:33:12 oh I meant the wheels
creations-chat 2021-12-17 11:01:41 ok well what I meant was that if I added the cow catchers when a turn comes the wheels will hit the cow catcher making it unable to turn
creations-chat 2021-12-17 11:04:57 yup I agree about the sensored part and Ive got an idea to basically attach the cow catcher to the leading wheel so that when it turns the cow catcher turns too
creations-chat 2021-12-17 11:07:03 ok thx alot. welp im going now bye
