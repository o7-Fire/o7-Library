bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:11:06 has anyone had their controls lock up at all
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:11:31 like, the controls you set stop working and aerodynamics dies while you just kind of go in the direction you were going when it happened
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:11:43 it always happens after i shoot the rockets on my blackshark
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:11:52 wait
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:12:10 i think it happens when part of your ship hits the void, but other parts of it are fine
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:12:30 cause the rockets hit the fallenpartsdestroyheight
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:12:34 and then something just breaks
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:13:11 ok
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:13:12 yep
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:13:14 that causes it
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:13:27 as soon as all of my rockets were destroyed, the controls locked
bug-reports 2018-10-07 14:13:29 i figure it out
the-dump 2018-10-09 20:37:01 Why did you make a recreation of a meme that died before the normies like PewDiePie even found out about it
the-dump 2018-10-09 20:45:26 no
the-dump 2018-10-09 20:45:26 what
the-dump 2018-10-09 20:45:28 it died ages ago

the-dump 2018-10-09 20:47:06 i will go find the largest first video on thanos car
the-dump 2018-10-09 20:47:32 the meme review on thanos car was posted sep 9
the-dump 2018-10-09 20:47:49 about the same day (give or take 1 day either forward or backwards) as it was banned from the subreddit it came from
the-dump 2018-10-09 20:48:00 which proves that pewdiepie has always been, and will always be a normie, sucking the wounds of dead memes
the-dump 2018-10-09 20:48:22 oh
the-dump 2018-10-09 20:48:23 right
the-dump 2018-10-09 20:48:25 meme court

bug-reports 2018-10-09 22:13:30 yes
help 2018-10-13 01:59:47 same thing it does on spring constraints
help 2018-10-13 01:59:56 just kind of changes how much it stops springing
help 2018-10-15 02:02:16 how do magnets even work
help 2018-10-15 02:02:22 i cant get them to do anything
help 2018-10-15 02:04:34 also is the max data of 260.000 supposed to say 260,000?
help 2018-10-15 02:04:36 or am i mis reading it
the-dump 2018-10-16 16:20:29 
help 2018-10-17 04:06:16 How will it maintain altitud automatically
the-dump 2018-10-21 15:56:17 WHO DEFUSE PINGED
help 2018-10-22 22:08:45 a good start is big propeller blades on top
help 2018-10-22 22:08:49 but you could use control surfaces
help 2018-10-22 22:08:58 its the closest you can get to working collective without changing the rpm
help 2018-10-22 22:09:05 since drag tends to push things on motors
help 2018-10-22 22:09:29 h
help 2018-10-22 22:09:30 oh
help 2018-10-22 22:09:36 i set the motor to unpowered so it doesnt do anyhing
help 2018-10-22 22:09:47 then it just acts like a hinge
help 2018-10-22 22:10:13 jets
help 2018-10-22 22:10:17 on the blades
help 2018-10-22 22:10:38 im gonna try making working collective using control surfaces and a single blade to see how hard a not easy mode counter rotating design is

help 2018-10-24 00:49:38 i hate that the forward and backwards on the engines and everything else was reverse
creations-chat 2018-10-24 20:06:26 replacing the engines with super rockets on my vtol means it flies at 380 speed when level
creations-chat 2018-10-24 20:06:43 and it can fly straight up at 250 speed
creations-chat 2018-10-24 20:06:47 which it couldnt do before
creations-chat 2018-10-24 20:09:06 but what if you added the new super rockets on it

bug-reports 2018-10-25 20:43:21 and disabling the drive
bug-reports 2018-10-25 20:43:47 it seems like somnehow part of it hits the void
bug-reports 2018-10-25 20:44:03 because when it happens the entire warp cylinder just kind of looks like it cracks in half
bug-reports 2018-10-25 20:44:11 and then it goes back to normal with some of the blocks a bit off
creations-chat 2018-10-25 21:13:57 looks like you got a parascope tahts also a gattling gun

creations-chat 2018-10-29 22:36:24 too bad you cnat use guns on it
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:36:19 excuse me W h at
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:36:45 you use uhjk instead of wasdqe?
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:36:56 eq roll, ad rudder ws pitch is superior
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:37:01 s will always be pitch up
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:37:21 every game i can rebind the controls in, i will
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:37:48 if i ever use the keyboard in war thunder i even use the same ksp control scheme
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:40:36 i mostly use mouse but i will stand by wasdqe for life
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:40:52 also if you want to just maintain roll sideways without banking you will have to use rudder
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:41:21 if i had to put ujhk to something, it would be RCS on something that hovers
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:41:39 wait
creations-chat 2018-11-03 00:41:46 ksp doesn't even use ujhk for that, it uses ikjl
creations-chat 2018-11-07 21:05:51 or just make it easy on yourself and use two rotors counter-rotating
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:58:30 new update broke my heli, blades never welded together before, but now for some reason they do
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:58:37 in fact
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:58:42 all motors seem to be buggered for me
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:58:47 even when unpowered
bug-reports 2018-11-08 23:59:01 wait

creations-chat 2018-11-09 21:34:57 so
creations-chat 2018-11-09 21:35:23 if i have a picture of my speed because i flung myself past escape velocity using a creation that's not even in frame, i still have to put it here right?
creations-chat 2018-11-09 21:35:26 ok yeah
creations-chat 2018-11-09 21:36:03 wait
creations-chat 2018-11-09 21:36:31 ok nvm gotta make a vehicle that go fast
creations-chat 2018-11-09 21:36:34 instead of me just going fast
bug-reports 2018-11-09 21:37:37 the bug that breaks warp drives is even worse now
bug-reports 2018-11-09 21:38:52 wait nvm
bug-reports 2018-11-09 21:38:57 i just didnt design my drive very well
creations-chat 2018-11-09 21:43:00 alright so i guess the ship to also go the speed isnt actually required?
creations-chat 2018-11-09 21:43:21 orbital velocity i guess? rank says you need the ship to go that speed but people are getting it from just flinging idk
creations-chat 2018-11-10 16:50:47 what
creations-chat 2018-11-10 17:03:31 looks nice
