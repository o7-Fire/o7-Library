help 2021-02-08 19:50:03 Does anyone have a good guide video, your own screenshots of builds or just overall tips of how to build blocks (plane) around the motorlock?
help 2021-02-08 20:08:33 i did
help 2021-02-08 20:08:49 and they all just show how they connect the motorlocks up to their jets and it just simply works
help 2021-02-08 20:09:03 but whenever I do it, it just breaks
creations-chat 2021-02-10 16:38:37 yeah well it's a block game can't do much about it plus looking at images of the F-35 it's literally the exact same thing but if ppl are just downvoting because of a tiny detail then they're just that car guy in a car meet where "my jet is one of a kind"
creations-chat 2021-02-10 16:44:31 It's an F-35, yeah what else do you want? I really don't understand
creations-chat 2021-02-10 16:46:53 like i upload a big detailed build i instantly get dropped with downvotes whereas another guy just posted an F-16 low poly as hell and just gets 3 upvotes within 2 seconds

yeah it's a block game I really can't make it any better chief
creations-chat 2021-02-10 16:50:08 At this point it's just like might as well build a 7x12 block plane and not expand any further and not get hated apparently

made the shnoze shorter, and it looked ugly as all hell

the entire point of motorlocking is for the plane to be more accurately faster
creations-chat 2022-08-15 23:29:25 Whats the record for a creation to get downvoted?
I think I beat it with a record of 1.63 seconds

The damn like/dislike ratio is wacky even on good posts it's sad
creations-chat 2022-08-15 23:42:56 I don't browse creations 24/7, plus It's just that even good builds that I occasionally look at there just get bombarded to oblivion.
