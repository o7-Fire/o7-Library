Self upvotes are frowned upon
creations-chat 2020-11-01 10:59:18 That's acceptable 

I think it's because of drama that usually goes on here
creations-chat 2020-11-01 11:02:12 Why is it so fckin long
creations-chat 2020-11-01 11:05:22 I dont care about barrel length I just thing you should make it a normal cylinder since the barrel of the irl tank is kinda skinny, also maybe add some detail. And add another layer of wheels, like.. bring some of the wheels down from the body of the tank becos imo the wheels tucked away looks kinda funky
creations-chat 2020-11-01 11:06:51 Why not just put them behind the barrel inside of the turret, or motorlock them so they become part of the barrel
creations-chat 2020-11-01 11:08:22 Then motorlock them into the barrel itself

 wait wym Depression
creations-chat 2020-11-01 11:09:43 Ah, so motorlock them into the barrel
creations-chat 2020-11-01 11:15:42 I didnt say in the turret, I said into the barrel 
Make it a normal 1x1 cylinder and motorlock the rockets into the cylinder so that it blends in

The paint is the only good thing about your p51. everything else is just a steaming pile of dogshit.

You need to put the wings forward like 2-3 blocks, fix the ugly intake nose and put it where it's actually supposed to go (under the belly of the plane) and rebuild the whole tail.

Do you even look at blueprints? Your plane is the imaginary  plane that I drew in 1st grade on a napkin  <:empty:794431705070174238> 

Well I see u got the intake but it's still dogshit
