plane-crazy 2020-06-02 19:22:32 what about a hover thruster engine?
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:52:02 why not just put the wings inside those block container things?
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:51:18 but it did go crazy
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:51:14 i tried it on my batwing and well it didn't lag
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:49:40 what if instead you put propellers in side those things and used a magnet engine or conveyor engine to make it go forward
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:47:00 any*
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:46:51 and places on the inside you can hide them?
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:45:06 try adding rockets on the bottom to make it go up and just keep tinkering with it to hit that sweet spot
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:44:10 exactly
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:44:05 think of one time where rockets didn't solve a countries problem
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:43:27 you could counter that by just adding a ton of rockets
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:38:16 thank you
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:34:43 anyone else get that problem where the propellers just fall off?

plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:32:39 wish roblox would add the option to just not use their ancient dead programming language and use unity or the unreal engine or something
plane-crazy 2020-06-02 18:31:53 is there actually a way to make water not flood the entire submarine?
