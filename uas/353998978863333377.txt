creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:07:33 this is some real biased stuff
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:10:54 why was my batwing treated so harshly?
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:14:36 I think you're just a little bit jelly
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:16:47 that is literally how it's supposed to be designed
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:17:28 blocky?
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:18:30 you must have very high standards and have the building skills of god
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:19:53 well i don't care if you think it looks bad anyway
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:20:16 I think it looks good, my friends thinks it looks good, i've not ran into anyone in game who thinks it looks bad and that's good enough for me
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:21:34 I don't get the short part
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:21:54 how so?
creations-chat 2020-06-02 18:22:18 well you know batman

the-dump 2020-06-02 18:23:18 
the-dump 2020-06-02 18:23:32 i took inspiration from this one
the-dump 2020-06-02 18:23:42 and just build it in my own way
the-dump 2020-06-02 18:24:36 it's hard to make something completely smooth
the-dump 2020-06-02 18:24:56 plus i wanted some points on it too cause it's a batman vehicle
the-dump 2020-06-02 18:25:12 i can see what you mean
the-dump 2020-06-02 18:25:18 i can't tell the difference between both pictures
the-dump 2020-06-02 18:27:42 also if i could i would have done it without that sort of blocky part under the wings but this thing is really heavy and needs a lot of power
the-dump 2020-06-02 18:27:50 so I will take that as a fair point
the-dump 2020-06-07 03:48:35 
the-dump 2020-06-10 18:36:09 
the-dump 2020-06-10 18:37:15 it's a man
the-dump 2020-06-10 18:38:07 i mean if you think it's attractive, you do you
