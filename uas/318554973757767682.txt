help 2020-06-05 03:57:42 can someone help
help 2020-06-05 03:58:08 after a few creations, i noticed motor 2s wiggle when you put alot of weight on the end of them
help 2020-06-05 03:58:11 how do i fix this?
help 2020-06-05 03:59:41 i'm trying to make a skeletal spine structure for a large build, and the spine looks fine. it's just that it can't stay straight when i press play (the spine uses multiple layers of motor 2s for both yaw and pitch, so i can make the skeleton turn both ways
help 2020-06-05 04:09:43 > make sure they point to where u want to go
<@456226577798135808> i also forgot to mention that all motors are servos so i can limit their angle while controlling them with my keyboard, so i think the yellow stud doesn't matter if the motor 2 is a servo, right?
help 2020-06-05 17:49:24 can someone tell me how to fix when servo motors wiggle when you put too much weight on them
help 2020-06-05 19:02:18 can someone tell me how to fix when servo motors wiggle when you put too much weight on them

help 2020-06-05 19:04:00 the thing between the head and the main body was supposed to be a long spine
help 2020-06-05 19:04:18 with layers of yaw and pitch servo motors
help 2020-06-05 19:04:50 but it just wiggled like crazy and i couldn't keep it straight so i downscaled it like in this video but it still just wiggles
help 2020-06-05 19:09:23 ok i made the torque 5 on each motor but it still just sways and i can barely control it
help 2020-06-05 19:09:28 
help 2020-06-05 19:10:31 so, there's no way i can fix this?

help 2020-08-10 14:20:57 called the type-52 troop carrier "phantom"
help 2020-08-10 14:21:13 basically it's behavior is
help 2020-08-10 14:21:19 it sorta hovers
help 2020-08-10 14:21:54 it can propel it self fowards and backwards easily and can pivot in any direction too
help 2020-08-10 14:22:01 but i can't figure out how to do it
help 2020-08-10 14:22:10 and when i say hover
help 2020-08-10 14:22:20 i don't actually mean hover off the ground a few feet
help 2020-08-10 14:22:38 like it can stop mid-air above the ground and drop people
help 2020-08-10 14:22:39 yeah
help 2020-08-10 14:22:42 like a vtol
help 2020-08-10 14:22:51 i didn't think of that

help 2020-08-10 14:23:31 here's the final version without any propulsion
help 2020-08-10 14:23:55 here's the underside
help 2020-08-10 14:24:48 the problem is that i need lots of super rocket engines, and it's so hard to keep it stable
help 2020-08-10 14:28:03 this is how many helium blocks are needed to make it properly float
help 2020-08-10 14:28:04 
help 2020-08-10 14:29:11 oh
help 2020-08-10 14:29:16 so how do i do that

help 2020-08-10 14:30:53 okay.
help 2020-08-10 14:33:32 would a motor lock staircase work?
help 2020-08-10 14:34:22 it looks difficult to make
help 2020-08-10 14:39:22 what
help 2020-08-10 14:39:31 so i have to do that design for every helium block
help 2020-08-10 14:40:22 looped?
help 2020-08-10 14:40:35 show a pic with 1x4 helium blocks in that
help 2020-08-10 14:44:20 ohh
