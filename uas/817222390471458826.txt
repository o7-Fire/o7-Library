creations-chat 2022-04-23 00:49:21 not too bad, but where the top of the cockpit meets the roofline is a little steep, and the rearmost cockpit windows slope downwards, which should be straight.
creations-chat 2022-04-23 00:53:09 not that much; either use 1x2 half wedge ot leave it straight

Second, the bottom of the cockpit should slope up to meet the top of the fuselage. Third, angle-lock the top of the airframe,
creations-chat 2022-04-23 14:40:51 cockpit looks decent.
creations-chat 2022-04-23 14:50:25 its that easy(oops took it from the wrong side but u get the point)
