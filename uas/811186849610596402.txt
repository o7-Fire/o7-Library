help 2022-03-08 10:51:23 also why the fuck are cluster bombs a war crime
help 2022-03-08 10:51:28 its just a bomb but with more radius
help 2022-03-08 10:52:15 just becuase its unnecessary doesnt mean it has to be a warcrime
help 2022-03-08 10:52:19 i mean
help 2022-03-08 10:52:38 now that i think about it that b29 will almost bomb allies and troops

help 2022-03-08 12:16:29 Legacy Close Tracking improves the tracking, Legacy Normal increases damage
help 2022-03-08 12:16:53 though
help 2022-03-08 12:17:24 LCT does have a chance of going into a fucking become motor state where they go away
