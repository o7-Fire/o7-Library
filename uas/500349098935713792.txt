plane-crazy 2020-02-23 09:12:00 No-one would've spent their time to message a developer this: I have a request for something in the next update: I and possibly more would like there to be a connection option, it means you connect something to a pilot seat! Also i would like there to be a setting in settings where you can let players use pilot seats!
plane-crazy 2020-02-23 09:11:16 theres one thing probably no-one has asked the developers
