you should try stormwork servers they’re worse
creations-chat 2022-06-13 20:02:08 *shrug* so scare so scare. unfortunate
creations-chat 2022-06-13 20:04:16 The responses made my day go ahead <:Ass:824809849052200960>
creations-chat 2022-06-13 20:06:30 I did the same to stormworks sever it’s great. Everyone just jumps on to clown.

Also it is blocksworld
creations-chat 2022-06-13 20:09:22 sure man. I got a warning idc. everyone was breathing down my neck with the word ban on their mind it was a great experience.

||not as toxic as a classic blocksworld server||
creations-chat 2022-06-13 20:11:24 no but I can break another rule <:Ass:824809849052200960>
creations-chat 2022-06-13 20:14:14 the official server is shutdown yes. there’s a BW2 server though. However it’s barely running. Many dudes still play it
creations-chat 2022-06-13 20:19:23 if you have it on steam download, if you have the IOS version download it on the App Store you still can. Search up BW2 tutorial online.

It’s been shitting itself lately though
