bug-reports 2022-07-25 01:34:42 while im flying if i fire off the rockets on my plane the rockets just disappear or despawn and i know its not my ping, im in a pvp server, and a few player and my friend has witnessed my rockets that i fire off just disappear and do nothing while im flying. and i have a video of it too.
bug-reports 2022-07-25 01:41:30 well rejoining doesn't fix so what should i do if i can do anything about it?
bug-reports 2022-07-25 01:44:49 oh well are the game devs trying to find a fix for the bug? because i've had it for a year now.
bug-reports 2022-07-25 01:51:50 oh that's weird i just hope that the game devs can find a permanent fix for this bug as its very annoying to only have guns on a plane.
bug-reports 2022-07-25 02:38:23 wait really? man you're luck ive had this problem for at least a year by now.
bug-reports 2022-07-25 02:49:16 i wish their was a way to fix it
