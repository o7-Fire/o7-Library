creations-chat 2022-04-12 02:43:58 Thanks man that helps a lot:)
creations-chat 2022-04-12 02:47:56 That was the point. It's supposed to be that way because of the colors on the jet. Dully noted tho.
creations-chat 2022-04-12 02:49:51 
creations-chat 2022-04-12 02:58:02 Like you could do better
creations-chat 2022-04-12 03:03:23 I see your "after burner" is better. I will try to work on mine, thank you for notifying me.
creations-chat 2022-04-12 03:07:04 What should I do for the after burner üî•
creations-chat 2022-04-12 03:12:31 You probably should move on
creations-chat 2022-04-12 03:15:04 Oh no it's not bad at all. Just build your next one better. Remember what you have learned from the community of plane-crazy. They only like things that look üëç and I'm not calling yours bad at all)
creations-chat 2022-04-12 11:49:28 what should i improve on this jet?

creations-chat 2022-04-16 14:58:00 because i mad a mig-monday and i was posting it? and because people asked for it 14 people!!!!!!! This community can be so toxic sometimes
creations-chat 2022-04-16 15:00:00 have you ever been in a game in plane crazy? and what problems do i have?
creations-chat 2022-04-16 15:02:57 alr first off that's not a lot of time... also you need to use actual words instead of "and if is" your making me think that your 8 years old at this point.
creations-chat 2022-04-16 23:43:22 look it was suppost to be released on Monday but I have a trip that will take up my whole week next week and the week after that.

creations-chat 2022-04-30 01:14:47 thanks homie
creations-chat 2022-04-30 01:28:00 dulely noted for my a-10 build man, thanks for allerting me i will try better next time.
creations-chat 2022-04-30 01:29:42 your right, I used those colors because I found them good. good eye. But I still dunno if mine is a tutorial... HMMM....
creations-chat 2022-04-30 01:31:26 That's just a little harsh man try in another way of context please and your comment will be put into my next build.
creations-chat 2022-04-30 01:34:13 My bad man, I was a little harsh there too. thanks for your amazing feedback, You have made an impact on the way I build and I will try to correct it on my a-10a
creations-chat 2022-04-30 01:36:40 Sorry I'm asking but, what's a "white name"? And would you like to continue our conversation in private chat so we don't have to wait 1:40 seconds before we talk again? if not I am perfectly okay with it.
creations-chat 2022-04-30 01:39:53 It's okay, How do I graduate from a white name? I am very interested now.. I have many planes that require lots of motor lock, I believe that ik some types of things about this game on ROBLOX we call plane crazy.
creations-chat 2022-04-30 01:43:25 it was an old creation, I didn't know that it was a tutorial. please formally accept my apology. and please look at the title I put for the creation I even stated there that I didn't know it it were one. because it was an old build. and when I was new to the game I just did tutorials. But thanks for awearing me about that.
creations-chat 2022-04-30 01:45:23 I have formally deleted the post, I am sorry for the inconvenience.
creations-chat 2022-04-30 01:47:17 Thank you, It might seem weird to you knowing that I am 13 years of ripe age..
creations-chat 2022-04-30 01:49:01 Ide prefer to talk like this because this was how I was raised.. If you would like to change the way I am, go to my parents please, thank you.
creations-chat 2022-04-30 01:52:22 I do not know what this gossip is about, please expund.
creations-chat 2022-04-30 01:54:12 I agree I would be laughing very much if someone just asked what this gossip is about HAHA (so funny omgggg... LIKE OMGGGG) (its a joke like daddy chill) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET5a81WYw00
creations-chat 2022-04-30 02:01:21 when does someone crosses the line between right or wrong? well This is the learning channel with a 13 year old.. Now when someone at your school starts to do the uhmmmmm "weird with his gf" you say . "daddy chill" This is what she said to your friend when she an him were having fun with crayons in class. step two: make fun of her hair.. call her forehead a beluga ( a beluga has a very large head) make fun of the way she laughs or even calls her bf "goldfish".. step three: do the look.. now how to do the look is by looking at their toes and then look at their face in a very esteem way so they think your partially autistic. (also this is what i made on the spot tell me if you laugh if not im goona be a oatmeal cornel)
creations-chat 2022-04-30 02:40:05 Im not gay but this is rhymin thooooooo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQKXBHLKEv0
help 2022-04-30 10:34:58 you both are incorrect
creations-chat 2022-08-25 22:49:10 any changes needed?
creations-chat 2022-08-25 22:52:26 maybe i have too much motor lock to do that uhm..
creations-chat 2022-08-25 22:55:56 i will try to fix the motor lock, but please refrain from any toxic behavior. i was just asking.
creations-chat 2022-08-25 22:58:13 good observation i would agree.
creations-chat 2022-08-31 00:50:40 how what?
creations-chat 2022-08-31 00:53:03 to me it looks good, but that's your opinion and i will respect it.
creations-chat 2022-09-01 00:42:36 POV that one kid thats trying to copy your build:
creations-chat 2022-09-01 01:41:19 üíÄ
creations-chat 2022-09-01 01:45:30 You all dumb, he even told me in chat he tryna copy. SMH ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
creations-chat 2022-09-01 01:50:20 Bro  sometime this whole chat is so toxic. Sometimes people just want to talk about their builds, or maybe talk to people with the same interests. But why are you all so defensive all the time. Like "shit copy of a mid plane" like why did you add that? That was not needed. If that is your opinion I will respect it, but refrain saying my plane was "mid" I worked very hard on it. Even if my builds Arnt as good as yours maybe someone or maybe someone else's. please treat me the same as you would treat you friends.
creations-chat 2022-09-01 01:53:44 Could I see some of your vehicles?
creations-chat 2022-09-01 01:55:47 Looks good üëç
creations-chat 2022-09-01 01:59:10 You see how I made you feel? I said "looks good :thumbsup: " instead of something toxic to prolong the argument and as you can tell it made you feel good. Now imagine how I felt when you said my plane was bad, I worked on mine as hard as you worked on yours. Mine took me 21+ hours. Even if mine wasn't as good, it's decent and that's how I like it.
creations-chat 2022-09-01 02:02:16 I put effort and time into all of my builds. I could come up to you and say that you have never played plane crazy even though you have. That's called a assumption. And that's what you just did. Also (nice f14)
creations-chat 2022-09-01 02:04:34 You haven't even seen it spawned in üíÄ (Well imma go now, have a good night you guys.)
creations-chat 2022-09-01 02:06:38 Bro thinks he has the sharingan
creations-chat 2022-09-01 02:10:23 I don't have screenshots in bed I'll do it tmro
creations-chat 2022-09-01 02:12:25 So if you know what it looks like, how many angle locks does it have?
creations-chat 2022-09-01 02:15:00 Oh my bad you don't know. Maybe try using your friends sharingan next time your friend has a "trained eye" doesn't he? y
creations-chat 2022-09-01 02:17:04 Buddy you didn't answer my question. How many angle locks?
creations-chat 2022-09-01 02:21:48 And you your buddy said he could see what it would look like from that angle. Now I'm going to bed, I have school tmro goodnight.
creations-chat 2022-09-01 02:24:36 Lol your stupid üíÄ
creations-chat 2022-09-01 02:27:17 Grammar police in discord that's the only thing you can say in your defense when you see "you're" wrong.
creations-chat 2022-09-01 02:29:38 "Cant" it's can't* if you're grammar police, now check your own grammar.

creations-chat 2022-09-16 17:21:47 i hate being banned from the roblox discord server for saying im not gay in the "gay pride" channel :(
creations-chat 2022-10-01 23:10:57 How do i upgrade from a whitename? any help?
creations-chat 2022-10-01 23:23:17 thanks
creations-chat 2022-10-02 01:05:29 a tutorial? good job, your officially a failure.
creations-chat 2022-10-02 01:10:09 here. <@770691894023028736> Ill try to fix that. <@984694509772357662> "its just a tut with modified camo"
creations-chat 2022-10-02 01:13:35 no room to place a real gear, and in that little spot there's cameras.
creations-chat 2022-10-02 01:16:04 ignorance.
creations-chat 2022-10-02 01:19:54 So are you implying that i copied something that's above my very skill level without any prior knowledge or what i did over the 7 days in game that i worked on this jet? That's too complicated if you go to the part where he shows you it in build mode, It resembles nothing of my jet.
creations-chat 2022-10-02 01:22:03 I was not ""Heavily inspired"" by madvulplen, I've been seeing the MIG-29 for a long time and it seemed interesting and nice, This was my first major project of motor-locking. <@636233924644700170>
