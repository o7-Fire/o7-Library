creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:33:53 i think you are implying that all creations need to be super pretty and realistic
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:33:56 but those are called replicas

creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:38:26 Flame, are you implying that the stuff I posted earlier did not count as 'creations'?
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:38:39 well, except for the 'bomb' of course
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:39:33 well, that's better than nothing
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:39:55 well, that was my attempt at getting the Bombardier rank
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:40:00 but i have something better on my mind now

creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:43:47 which will make the plane spin in while it flies
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:44:44 ***oh right***
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:45:00 they should make it possible to edit the speed of wheels
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:45:12 so your 4-wheel car doesn't reach the speed of light
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:45:54 i had a tank with 4 wheels
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:45:56 well, i call it a tank
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:45:59 it wasn't one really
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:46:34 well, from what i have tested
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:46:50 the vehicle needs to be way too bulky

creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:50:04 don't call me John tho
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:50:07 call me Bacon
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:50:16 i'm more used to it
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:50:19 don't ask why
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:50:42 I literally used a fake name generator
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:50:48 because I'm bad at making good usernames
creations-chat 2018-12-02 23:51:10 and then for the numbers at the front, I counted the amount of letters in John and Hegwood
creations-chat 2018-12-03 00:59:31 My first zeppelin! It's filled with helium blocks that make it float, and then I placed jets inside of it to change it's height and speed. If I'm right, I should get the Advanced Engineer rank.
