creations-chat 2020-10-23 01:13:49 How could you promise me such things and take it away
creations-chat 2020-10-23 01:21:30 I’m just hopping someone leaves as I can join in
creations-chat 2020-10-23 01:35:18 Ther has yet to be space aah

creations-chat 2020-10-23 03:54:28 Feed me torpedos plz
creations-chat 2020-10-23 04:09:58 Yo anyone got good torpedos?
creations-chat 2020-10-23 04:15:14 Torpedo
creations-chat 2020-10-23 04:22:01 torpedo good
creations-chat 2020-10-23 04:23:03 In case you don’t want to know true power
creations-chat 2020-10-23 04:24:25 Well your a tank you don’t need to worry about torpedos
creations-chat 2020-10-23 04:25:50 It’s a torpedo boat but ok
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:22:36 Some what ripened banana
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:27:45 Have any of you heard of the gold fish?
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:29:15 It’s the smallest sub you can make
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:37:05 One time I managed to get a glitch that gave me 2 motor slots unfortunately I didn’t get to finish placing all of the first motors before and untimely discontect
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:48:15 I did a size comparison my extensors bridge is shorter that his 😦
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:52:26 Is this enough motor?
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:54:43 Only if the glitch blesses me with 2 motor 1 slots   Oh wait
creations-chat 2020-10-23 18:59:51 Like that silly
creations-chat 2020-10-23 19:19:54 Join me on my extendo bridge
creations-chat 2020-10-23 20:11:49 Silly uboat what do you plane on doing with that gun?
creations-chat 2020-10-23 20:13:28 It’s a u boat they go in a fetal position when they spot a plane
creations-chat 2020-10-23 20:15:36 No one likes my plane.....
creations-chat 2020-10-23 21:40:38 I would say the desert ones
creations-chat 2020-10-24 00:03:30 I am super confused on how or why people upvote stuff
creations-chat 2020-10-24 00:07:42 I can understand calling it low effort because it’s simplistic but I think people see rigidness as effort
creations-chat 2020-10-24 00:14:51 Bruh use wells on your turrets
creations-chat 2020-10-24 00:26:02 Down here salt is a way of life
creations-chat 2020-10-24 00:58:15 An extensors bridge can’t appease the mass I don’t know what will
creations-chat 2020-10-24 01:32:41 Down here salt is a way of life
creations-chat 2020-10-24 01:51:55 I can’t figure out how to get stability without helium help plz
creations-chat 2020-10-24 01:52:57 Aw yes I’ll use flaps in order to escape the spin
creations-chat 2020-10-24 01:55:38 Wait a minute if I don’t want to use helium I need to move the fins so upon going back down they invert their stability yay.....
creations-chat 2020-10-24 03:59:56 If my rockets jumps off on start above 800 but goes bellow during flight does it count as 800 reached off engine power?
creations-chat 2020-10-24 05:00:46 I don’t under stand how is gets a stupid speed boost when is starts to take off the first second is 2000 and after that it drops to 900
creations-chat 2020-10-24 05:31:36 Once you pass 700 there is no space for anything but super thrusters
creations-chat 2020-10-24 05:52:08 Majestic
creations-chat 2020-10-24 05:54:27 Fun fact in this game ever block is effected by drag no matter what you do, if you want to increase the speed of your creation try limiting how much surface area is pointing forward by using small pieces and/or beams
bot-central 2020-10-24 08:27:56 !rank
bot-central 2020-10-24 08:28:05 Eyy
bug-reports 2020-10-24 15:20:50 He he no they do that no matter what the limit, torque, or speed it is
the-dump 2020-10-24 15:27:26 Give past
creations-chat 2020-10-24 15:30:08 Woah woah
bot-central 2020-10-25 00:11:25 How do I set a music? I’m looking for Super Mario 2 overworld theme
creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:15:20 IKR its not in ranks
creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:16:22 Crinjge you have no ranks
creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:19:58 I’m on a quest for ranks
creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:22:39 That’s not chunky still
creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:26:36 People just stop with being salty with self upvotes it’s not gonna summon satan
creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:28:42 It’s just unnecessarily toxic
creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:37:27 I honestly just have to post all of my stuff so I can grab the ranks WAIT my torpedo might give me a chance at inventor
creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:39:33 Here’s the thing, my torpedo goes an a straight line at high speeds and is dropped into the water. it’s a true torpedo
creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:42:30 If I post it though I’m gonna need a big daddy torpedo because it’s maximum drop height for boats is awful
creations-chat 2020-10-25 01:48:58 Make the like boats ￼ buoys with seats
creations-chat 2020-10-25 02:21:52 Why not piston lock
creations-chat 2020-10-25 02:25:44 Yo how about the power of camera orientation?
creations-chat 2020-10-25 02:30:07 Somethings wrong about that block
creations-chat 2020-10-25 02:33:40 @0BC oh boy aw man it’s not blue
creations-chat 2020-10-25 02:35:26 I needed to take a better approach: make an account with an identical name but with one difference, then ping it
creations-chat 2020-10-25 02:36:28 It must be the rank thing
creations-chat 2020-10-25 02:50:45 How many blocks are required to create a working sub? Making sure it moves in the intended direction, can turn
creations-chat 2020-10-25 02:54:15 Wood in a sheet like fashion
creations-chat 2020-10-25 02:56:26 You might be too front heavy
creations-chat 2020-10-25 03:22:45 Need help improving
creations-chat 2020-10-25 03:23:46 That’s darker than I thought. My mouse is still there
creations-chat 2020-10-25 03:26:03 Not sure how that improves it but ok
creations-chat 2020-10-25 03:27:34 Any other thoughts???
creations-chat 2020-10-25 03:30:48 I thought green was the uncreative color
the-dump 2020-10-25 03:36:24 Hello children could thy give their opinion on thee plane <#504436696021204992>

bot-central 2020-10-25 03:39:34 :/
bot-central 2020-10-25 03:39:46 I see how it is...
bot-central 2020-10-25 03:40:22 Yeah I see that
bot-central 2020-10-25 03:41:02 I was hoping to see what it was going to give me
creations-chat 2020-10-25 03:42:29 You almost did the same picture
creations-chat 2020-10-25 03:43:55 I need to get better at using motor locks for decoration
creations-chat 2020-10-25 03:46:47 Actually I don’t think I can use motor lock for any detail as the wings having to fold take up too much space
creations-chat 2020-10-25 03:49:50 I discovered motor locking while building it but because of its size and placement of wheels and wings made it hard to add stuff
creations-chat 2020-10-25 04:18:29 I dare someone to only use staircases as scaffolding on a large build
bug-reports 2020-10-25 05:32:17 I think there might be a bug with speed over 700. And if there isn’t, then there is on takeoff when it starts at 2k
bug-reports 2020-10-25 05:51:50 But seriously how am I supposed to attempt to beat the challenges if 200 super rockets don’t make the speed pass 700 during flight
bug-reports 2020-10-25 06:20:32 You’re not helpful
creations-chat 2020-10-25 17:41:36 I’m one step away from doing the thing but I have no idea how I’m gonna make a mini vtol on top of a rocket.
bot-central 2020-10-25 17:57:12 !rank
creations-chat 2020-10-25 19:10:26 Help I need a boat to catch a falling capusule
creations-chat 2020-10-25 19:12:31 I don’t feel like piloting a boat and controlling a ballistic rocket cap
creations-chat 2020-10-25 19:24:33 Let’s make some alcohol
creations-chat 2020-10-25 19:29:25 Moonshine
creations-chat 2020-10-25 19:37:22 I’m not sure if you people get the joke or not
creations-chat 2020-10-25 19:40:38 Moonshine, chloroplasts require sunlight to produce energy and the sun is required for the moon to shine, also alcohol is sugar
creations-chat 2020-10-25 19:47:29 How I show video gosh darn it
creations-chat 2020-10-25 19:52:24 All I have to say is put a 5v5 motor on your creation and spin to win
creations-chat 2020-10-25 20:50:20 I ask you to add wells gosh darn it
creations-chat 2020-10-25 20:51:28 All turrets should have wells
creations-chat 2020-10-25 20:55:58 Did you know that there was suiside bombers before the kamikaze?
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:06:37 A narwhal photobombed me
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:12:05 Did I hear torpedos?
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:13:07 People think they can attach an engine to the back of tnt and call it a day
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:15:30 If it helps I do have experience with torpedos and have a mini droppable torpedo for boats
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:16:50 No no no sir I can make them for planes it just requires some tweaking I plan on making one for high drop heights soon
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:20:04 If you search what I have posted you should find the micro torpedos that I had on my boat
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:28:26 It’s pain trying to make larger torpedos
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:49:03 Reloading is eazy, it’s accurate torpedos that’s the problem
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:51:39 For it to qualify as a torpedo it must be able to travel in a straight line including up and down
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:54:34 <:CertifiedMoment:570774089099116548>
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:57:35 If your a boat I got a torpedo for you
creations-chat 2020-10-25 21:59:14 I don’t even know how to watch that video
the-dump 2020-10-25 22:17:55 They used his credit card to buy him robux and he has yet to realize
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:18:29 Make a trophy system on it
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:20:13 If you could make a trophy system I think you would get innovator rank
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:21:15 Shotguns that snipe missiles targeting the tank
creations-chat 2020-10-25 22:23:29 Ah missiles imagine being in a plane and a heat seeking missile approaches you from behind and slices your plane in half with a tungsten rubber band
creations-chat 2020-10-26 01:05:57 When you finish painting and the block count drops
creations-chat 2020-10-26 01:12:41 Welp I can’t find the missing part guess I’ll paint again
creations-chat 2020-10-26 01:14:31 Oh boy I crashed so I can’t undo the save
creations-chat 2020-10-26 01:25:44 Should I begin my rocket challenge?
creations-chat 2020-10-26 02:12:29 Today I figured out that spring exists and that it is a better disconnecter.
creations-chat 2020-10-26 02:14:15 Spring has break weld and auto retract. You can use it for reloading as well. The break weld means I don’t have to use tnt is I don’t want the thing I’m discarding to leave a trace
creations-chat 2020-10-26 02:19:05 I mean you did cause this to yourself
creations-chat 2020-10-26 02:49:41 What is the larger plane yes have ever seen?
creations-chat 2020-10-26 02:55:59 A Uboat is a boat that dives
creations-chat 2020-10-26 02:57:48 No no no you don’t get it a U-boat is literally just a boat with ballast tanks
creations-chat 2020-10-26 02:59:43 A submarine is designed to be underwater U-boats are not. They effectively hold their breath and aren’t meant to stay underwater.
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:01:46 “What if we did a controlled sink”
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:03:12 It’s just like how kamikaze is a type of suiside bombing. It was the one with kites on peoples feet.
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:04:27 Not gay they were smart bombs
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:07:46 Kamikaze is a type of suicide bombing where they tied a kite to their feet and gave them a bomb.
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:09:33 The glider suiside bomber are way more effective
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:11:23 I’m on team not a submarine
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:12:33 It’s like that plane they threw off a cliff and said it flied
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:13:35 <@!410455661814480896> those are called actuator tanks and they exist and were used often
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:15:01 It’s important to note the Uboat ￼ relied on batteries to stay underwater
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:17:29 The Uboat is basically a plane that can’t use its engine in the air
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:18:49 That information is for normies
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:21:17 Once the Uboat drained its batteries it would have to surface
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:22:19 They say they are a sub because they are the precursors to subs
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:23:32 I think we won the war. Unfortunately, we lost one....
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:27:48 Wikipedia is only really a good source in expert areas
creations-chat 2020-10-26 03:29:01 Only in beginner level stuff it’s helpful for science
creations-chat 2020-10-26 05:39:22 Oh boy I can’t wait to get up tomorrow and figure of the secrets of camera welding
creations-chat 2020-10-26 19:12:57 I love how adding a few signs as detail makes people upvote something they could call low effort
creations-chat 2020-10-26 19:13:59 If you would stop the particles from appearing in the crevasses I think it would look better
creations-chat 2020-10-26 19:23:12 When you configure cameras you can point them at blocks doing this will also make them twist what they where welded to and they can break apart welds
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:46:43 Why do people upvote jets so much
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:48:33 Make wing triangle get 50 upvotes
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:50:34 Does anyone have a good engine for large planes?
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:51:36 It just has to have a cruising speed of at least 200
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:52:38 Engine
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:54:28 I need to request my rank but currently I’m getting all my creations in slowly
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:55:55 I don’t wanna spam all my creations in
creations-chat 2020-10-26 22:57:48 Every one of my creations is a different thing the most I have of the same thing is a regular and a mini
creations-chat 2020-10-26 23:42:07 Yes there is<:Wokeje139:604492580369203210> people have been warned about a chaining in contest chat
creations-chat 2020-10-26 23:43:37 I came back to see if anyone shown an engine<:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
creations-chat 2020-10-26 23:47:10 I mean as long as each message is in the theme of creations chat your fine<:Wokeje139:604492580369203210>
creations-chat 2020-10-27 00:04:47 Eeehhh
creations-chat 2020-10-27 00:05:48 The new model they kinda fell behind Xbox just I little bit
creations-chat 2020-10-27 00:21:42 I think the plane I’m making is a little too big...
creations-chat 2020-10-27 00:27:52 Plane
creations-chat 2020-10-27 00:29:19 This plane 4 fold currently as for the tail it has space
creations-chat 2020-10-27 00:31:26 Through shenanigans I can put the ailerons on without folding but the dorsal fin will need to be folded
creations-chat 2020-10-27 00:32:28 Adjustable motor lock???
creations-chat 2020-10-27 00:33:52 Aah I see
creations-chat 2020-10-27 00:36:42 You could try using cameras
creations-chat 2020-10-27 00:53:08 So can I tag onto someone’s vip server so I can get smoother frames for a creation video?
creations-chat 2020-10-27 01:51:38 Bruh I almost landed the final stage but because the barges turning didn’t save it couldn’t get to me
creations-chat 2020-10-27 04:44:14 Ok so the secret to upvotes is triangle wings, adding text as detail, and thrusters on heli blades got it
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:08:16 I hate thrusters on heli blades so much
creations-chat 2020-10-27 05:09:18 Make the wings more flush with the body
creations-chat 2020-10-27 07:05:02 <@!589459121489838141> no WIP in creations post it here
creations-chat 2020-10-27 07:06:12 The door fine but creations isn’t for unfinished builds
creations-chat 2020-10-27 07:26:25 But that 4.7k trying to use less blocks? Or is it maxed on cubes
creations-chat 2020-10-27 07:29:11 Good for you also since all blocks add to drag it makes you go faster
creations-chat 2020-10-27 07:31:59 For some reason to me it feels like wheeled vehicles are harder to scale than planes
creations-chat 2020-10-27 07:39:23 I wonder if you can make all the components of a car drive system
creations-chat 2020-10-27 07:40:46 Ee hehe a differential might have not been made yet
creations-chat 2020-10-27 07:42:49 Aw man where
creations-chat 2020-10-27 07:58:31 Someone may have made a differential but I don’t see a LSD differential
creations-chat 2020-10-27 08:08:04 Well there’s one that claims it but it’s powered by a motor in middle so it’s not a true differential nor does the LSD act like a LSD based on the picture
creations-chat 2020-10-27 08:12:19 I can’t use torsen because of worm gears but really I don’t see a problem with size
creations-chat 2020-10-27 08:13:50 The only thing I’m scarred of is the beval gears
creations-chat 2020-10-27 09:11:51 I think you made a mistake on how big it’s gonna be. You won’t have room for much stuff above deck at all
creations-chat 2020-10-27 09:14:28 Alaska
creations-chat 2020-10-27 09:16:02 Swastica represents peace. Remove it
creations-chat 2020-10-27 09:17:06 It is illegal in Germany, purge the boat now
creations-chat 2020-10-27 09:19:21 <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
creations-chat 2020-10-27 09:21:45 What why what confusion what word bad?
creations-chat 2020-10-27 09:24:00 Dyno why you do this to me
creations-chat 2020-10-27 09:25:20 Did auto correct get me warned. I didn’t know auto correct could cuss
creations-chat 2020-10-27 09:28:20 I was typing a fun fact and I got bonked by dyno
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:29:28 Slowly I get a better understanding of how people vote in creations
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:32:22 What I hate about it is the details that get you up votes I consider lazy short cuts
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:33:48 Paint design that goes against the grain of the creation, and triangle wings trigger me the most
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:36:28 Yesterday I died inside when my barge didn’t catch my capsule
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:38:14 I’m not gonna give up until I get 20 ranks in one go
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:39:29 Debatable
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:41:27 People look for things they can spot to show its complex like laziness of covering it up, they don’t think about the actual quality of the build
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:52:53 I like the upper limits but I like the ranks should have a logarithmic scale
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:54:26 Square boat
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:57:48 Thrusters on heli blades can die in hell they look so bad
creations-chat 2020-10-27 17:58:50 Aawwww maaaann I need a rank to get rank
creations-chat 2020-10-27 18:00:58 I don’t want to do another run for the rocket challenges at the current lag of it

creations-chat 2020-11-15 22:04:42 What if someone made a plane that landed like a sub
the-dump 2020-11-15 22:33:13 Yo would you people like a short excerpt on a invention of the 80s?
the-dump 2020-11-15 22:36:51 Annoyed of having to rearm the mousetraps every time they get set off? Well your in luck! Introducing The Revolver Mousetrap! All you gotta do is open the chamber, place a bullet in and close it up and it’s ready for action! The Revolver Mousetrap has 6 uses before it has to be reloaded! Thats 6 mice dealt with before you had to do anything! 
“Now what if the quick little mice get the cheese before it can go off?”
Unlike regular mousetraps, The Revolver Mousetrap has the speed of a bullet, nothing is escaping it when it goes off?
“My little Timmy keeps activating the mouse traps in our house, how will The Revolver Mousetrap solve my problem?”
Not a problem at all! The Revolver Mousetrap will give little Timmy a little sting on his hand for being such a bad boy and you’ll still have 5 more uses on mice!
“Thanks The Revolver Mousetrap! I don’t have to worry about those pesky little mice or Timmy again!”
creations-chat 2020-11-15 22:46:13 Anyone got a need for a range finder?

creations-chat 2020-11-15 22:49:42 You know that tube you see on the back  of turrets it’s called a range finder and it’s used for calculating lead and drop while aiming. Specifically those are called optical range finders

creations-chat 2020-11-17 20:14:54 Does anyone know any single blade heli designs?
creations-chat 2020-11-17 20:19:00 I guess I’ll try and make a design with one blade but it will require a lot of inside space to look good
creations-chat 2020-11-17 20:20:32 <:Mhm:551152556324159488>
creations-chat 2020-11-17 20:23:41 The blade can’t be directly connected to the chassis to avoid the torque of the motor. Also swash pates facilitate movement
creations-chat 2020-11-17 20:26:55 Motor lock. Also learning how to make certain systems don’t count
creations-chat 2020-11-17 21:53:19 Woke trails if you could get them to look slightly wider that would look nice

creations-chat 2020-11-18 03:56:37 Question do you notice 2 blade helis to be better or worse than the single thruster blades?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:11:56 So I finished building my helivolver! slight problem, the handle that has all the space is super heavy
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:13:28 I have been forced to shove a ballast beam on the barrel to balance it
creations-chat 2020-11-18 04:18:49 Ok so people think Coxial heli blades are better but how will they preform in <#384025409945337856> compared to the thruster ones

creations-chat 2020-11-18 06:47:21 Yo anyone got some good tips on stabilizing helis my gun is being unruly
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:08:52 But seriously I need some help on stabilizing my gun. Does anyone got any heli stabilization tips?
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:14:46 Ok but the physics it uses only apply to this game due to how we make helicopters fly
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:16:35 Its mainly to fix my pitch as I don’t wanna wing spam it
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:20:37 Yes but helicopters have a little thing called a swash plate that facilitates their job and because they have constant rotational speed it less lessens the efficiency causing a lot of problems for no gain. Like how long it can hover
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:22:50 In this game helicopters work by effectively having a massive parachute on top that makes them stable by slowly descending
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:24:44 Try and make a heli stable while slowly ascending. You’ll realize the physics problem with the amount of drag of your blades
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:27:10 While slowly descending your rotor will try to be above the center of mass, if you go upwards it will try and be below it
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:29:15 The rotors don’t have a sense in direction as long as your moving up there is more drag on them than your body so they will try to move below you center of mass
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:30:47 Put fins on the top of a rocket to facilitate this principle. On a regular heli the blades will try on go up with the help of a gyro. You do not have a gyro
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:34:20 I’m talking about this game not real life helis that don’t use the same principles to fly in the first place.
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:36:47 first off their is not lift in this game and lift is not inherently upward. THE METHOD IS A SWASH PLATE the have acces to changing the coefficient of lift of their blades
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:39:26 Without a swash plate you can not move, you can not stabilize yourself, you can not fly
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:41:16 How do you think helicopters move
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:43:03 Your “lift” is only facing up while your facing up it does not stabilize you
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:45:53 “Helicopter technician” and I we were talking abut the difference between roblox and real life based on how we get a heli to fly in roblox well
creations-chat 2020-11-18 17:47:25 <@!491570111787040778> add decorations to the middle it looks bland

the-dump 2021-01-11 00:04:58 I still wouldn’t say it qualifies
the-dump 2021-01-11 00:12:20 doesn’t qualify for political￼ either
the-dump 2021-01-11 00:15:55 It has to do with the emote pog champ and statements from its creator
the-dump 2021-01-11 00:16:36 the meme I shared has to do with reactions to said event so it does not have a side making it not political

bug-reports 2021-01-21 23:15:51 they cant fix it going under or making it more usable
bug-reports 2021-01-21 23:16:34 it’s effectively and extra block of hight
bug-reports 2021-01-21 23:17:42 well that would be one way to fix it lower the build plate by 1

bug-reports 2021-01-28 23:02:32 not sure to say if this is a bug report or not but it would be nice if ballast tanks activated faster when hitting water, it would make the drop height for torpedos much more lenient
bug-reports 2021-01-28 23:03:12 its like an effect that may not be intentional but has been around for a long time
bug-reports 2021-01-28 23:04:57 a ballast tank only has effects in water and the way it works is by staying on a certain height
bug-reports 2021-01-28 23:05:56 when you drop a torpedo the ballast tank takes a while to activate making it liable to go under most boats
bug-reports 2021-01-28 23:06:49 ballast tanks dont use physics to work they use script code
bug-reports 2021-01-28 23:07:33 I have a boat and you not miss the target they are dropped just above the surface to hit averagely low boats
bug-reports 2021-01-28 23:08:20 most people will use helium to give their boat hull a maximum depth of 0.5 blocks
bug-reports 2021-01-28 23:10:18 I have trouble hitting those targets with a low mounted torpedo. how do you imagine hitting them with a plane

bug-reports 2021-03-14 22:14:28 its funny how many errors are in some games
bug-reports 2021-03-14 22:16:38 it is
bug-reports 2021-03-14 22:17:24 in most games you’ll find what the most recent update has broken that the dev of that game has yet to fix
bug-reports 2021-03-14 22:18:23 apparently
bug-reports 2021-03-14 22:19:08 it might be a dev event that they can trigger
creations-chat 2021-03-14 22:21:40 if your gonna use thruster blades theres no point of having it be Coaxial as well
creations-chat 2021-03-14 22:25:16 the two main ways of achieving a working heli blade is to make it Coaxial(two sets of blades) or to use a form of propulsion on the blades(I call thruster blades)
 you dont need both for your heli to fly and they both are hated in some way.
 coaxial is the more hated due to it looking easier when they are both effectively generic
creations-chat 2021-03-14 22:30:39 work all the same and are way less bulky
bug-reports 2021-03-16 07:03:20 sometimes your auto save looks like what you just built when its actually an outdated version sometimes
bug-reports 2021-03-16 07:04:27 not a bug just a thing that makes you feel like something didn’t save
bug-reports 2021-03-16 07:05:33 really only a problem when modifying controls
creations-chat 2021-03-17 00:47:11 motor locc
creations-chat 2021-03-17 00:49:43 tanks and jets require more effort when building dew to the overuse and lack of creativity when it comes to them.
If you want to have a high score, you need to use motor lock
