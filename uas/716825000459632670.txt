creations-chat 2021-04-25 19:51:23 idk what you mean by that, but if you're asking the size yes the eva can touch the island
creations-chat 2021-04-25 19:56:26 its all cool i understand, the island is kinds low so if i try to stand straight up my shoulderpad hits the island, and the eva is scaled correctly to humans so the island is just really low for me

creations-chat 2021-04-26 17:48:44 For asking him to skip the lower ranks and give me expert robotic specialist including proof that i achieved the goal of the expert requirements
creations-chat 2021-04-26 17:50:46 Sick, thx homie, the eva meets the requirements so i should have the green light

creations-chat 2021-04-29 14:20:07 These are some very nice planes, they fly too!
creations-chat 2021-04-29 14:30:26 Pepsi is it possible for a second mod to review my ticket for a rankup rather than one mod?
creations-chat 2021-04-29 14:32:50 Not to be mean to rbk but hes kinda been a bit busy and we made a agreement if he could see my eva ingame to see its stable because i cant record a video of it because it is super slow
creations-chat 2021-04-29 14:35:38 But he said that he only needed proof that it could walk and be stable without gravity slider which i dont use so it would be quick
help 2021-04-29 21:36:04 Most good builders realize that some peices might be connected so if you have a problem with how something is working, best to take a very close look at it
help 2021-04-29 21:36:48 Is it connected ?
