plane-crazy 2019-12-02 12:20:16 The precise aim of it to
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 12:19:57 Seriously that’ll be to op
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:18:41 It’s been cancelled
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:18:20 They are literally just called propellers
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:17:34 Just giving some ideas
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:17:20 He could also do like allow people to help you with ur build
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:15:56 That’s why I said it may be going to far
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:15:45 I know
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:15:30 Plot sizes
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:15:20 Yeah
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:14:44 This may be going way to far but I think he should add different sizes.
Like modes of building.
We have  the regular size one, the ship size which is pretty wide but really long so we don’t have to add motors and some others or so
plane-crazy 2019-09-20 13:11:46 Honestly I think they should bump the Max Save Data for some bigger builds
