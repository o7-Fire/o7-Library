creations-chat 2019-12-18 22:16:36 You should add camber
creations-chat 2019-12-18 22:18:01 You should adjust it to where it’s noticeable but not too much camber. In my opinion Nissan’s look better with camber than other cars

creations-chat 2020-01-23 15:34:05 "Utopia"
A purely Industrial based city. The year is 2432 and this city has grown from an unknown concrete grouping of buildings to a massive steel and concrete home for millions. Utopia is one of the largest cities on this fully transformed, metallic Earth and is the top producer of minerals and ship building supplies. On this note, it's Earth's top exporter of pollution... Purely a death trap for those who are stuck working in it.
