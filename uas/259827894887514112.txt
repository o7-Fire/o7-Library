help 2021-08-16 01:41:32 anyone know a working bearing design? mine works but freaks out sometimes
help 2021-08-16 01:42:02 this is what i mean by freaking out
help 2021-08-16 01:42:37 it isnt a true bearing
help 2021-08-16 01:42:47 it transfers rotation when there is too much
help 2021-08-16 01:42:55 yes
help 2021-08-16 01:43:35 i just want a bearing that never rotates but stays with the creation
help 2021-08-16 01:44:41 i have to attach it to the rotating part though
help 2021-08-16 01:44:46 ??
help 2021-08-16 01:45:38 yes-ish
help 2021-08-16 01:46:40 im trying to make a friction-less bearing
help 2021-08-16 01:47:00 
help 2021-08-16 01:47:07 the bottom is meant to spin really fast if it isnt obvious
help 2021-08-16 01:47:20 but it needs a part that doesnt rotate with it
help 2021-08-16 01:47:30 hence why i need a friction less bearing
help 2021-08-16 01:50:35 i used 5
help 2021-08-16 01:50:37 didnt work
help 2021-08-16 01:51:35 it needs to be completely frictionless
help 2021-08-16 03:20:55 what else was i supposed to use
help 2021-08-16 03:24:25 i've noticed that this community is a tiny bit toxic
help 2021-08-16 03:30:00 ^
help 2021-08-16 03:31:05 literally this
help 2021-08-16 03:33:11 they are very angry about me using rope
help 2021-08-16 03:34:08 it literally isnt a perfect bearing
help 2021-08-16 03:34:56 hover engines
help 2021-08-16 03:35:01 literally
help 2021-08-16 03:35:02 hover engines
help 2021-08-16 03:35:05 can you not see
help 2021-08-16 03:35:30 nope
help 2021-08-16 03:35:33 it didnt fling
help 2021-08-16 03:35:41 i literally tested it
help 2021-08-16 03:36:05 everything aside, i got the bearing working and everything works smoothly
help 2021-08-16 03:36:29 with that exact design
help 2021-08-16 03:36:32 that you are arguing about
help 2021-08-16 03:40:43 why anchor??
help 2021-08-16 03:40:47 it needs to be able to move
help 2021-08-16 03:40:55 with the entire thing
help 2021-08-16 03:41:15 so it stays in place with the entire creation but doesnt rotate
help 2021-08-16 03:41:33 how does anchor move with the creation??
help 2021-08-16 03:42:14 ah yes 2 white lines
help 2021-08-16 03:42:20 i dont understand what you're saying
help 2021-08-16 03:43:20 yes
help 2021-08-16 03:43:49 no
help 2021-08-16 03:43:54 i see what you are saying
help 2021-08-16 03:46:31 while that design does work and has many advantages
help 2021-08-16 03:46:36 my design also has advantages
help 2021-08-16 03:46:53 both designs work
help 2021-08-16 03:46:55 no need to argue
help 2021-08-16 03:48:09 if you need to attach something that cant have anything in the way then my design would  be the better choice
help 2021-08-16 03:49:47 im having trouble visualizing that in a creation
help 2021-08-16 03:49:55 in a useful way
help 2021-08-16 03:54:49 ?
help 2021-08-16 03:55:37 this is kinda like my design but built better
help 2021-08-16 03:56:47 but the point of the bearing is that it can be moved with the creation
help 2021-08-16 03:56:51 this has an anchor
help 2021-08-16 03:58:01 but it wont move with the creation
help 2021-08-16 03:58:06 its a anchor block
help 2021-08-16 03:58:08 it will stay in place
help 2021-08-16 03:58:51 what
help 2021-08-16 03:58:57 which bottom
help 2021-08-16 03:59:50 the jets?
help 2021-08-16 03:59:53 there is no motor
help 2021-08-16 04:00:46 hang on my screenshot tool isnt working
help 2021-08-16 04:00:59 
help 2021-08-16 04:01:04 yeah thats not working
help 2021-08-16 04:01:05 idk why
help 2021-08-16 04:01:45 for what
help 2021-08-16 04:01:51 im not following at all sorry
help 2021-08-16 04:02:39 
help 2021-08-16 04:02:42 motor added
help 2021-08-16 04:04:26 it would spin with the jets
help 2021-08-16 04:04:34 the power of the jets is too strong for a unpowered motor
help 2021-08-16 04:05:29 do you not understand that anchor blocks will stop the whole thing from moving
help 2021-08-16 04:05:33 because its an anchor block
help 2021-08-16 04:09:47 the signs are rotating around at mach 5
help 2021-08-16 04:09:52 but its working
help 2021-08-16 04:10:38 its shaking a bit though
help 2021-08-16 04:12:17 its very shakey
help 2021-08-16 04:13:55 to the bearing?
help 2021-08-16 04:14:28 thats what lets it hover upwards
help 2021-08-16 04:14:33 and thats not whats shaking
help 2021-08-16 04:17:03 <@!668314196764655618> performed a test, hover thrusters will see signs as things it will "bounce" off of
help 2021-08-16 04:20:22 so basically you would have the glass part inside or attached to a creation with the bearing inside, allowing parts connected to the bearing to move freely
help 2021-08-16 04:21:42 anchor blocks will literally stop the whole thing from moving
help 2021-08-16 04:21:45 do you know what an anchor block does
help 2021-08-16 04:21:46 do you play this game
help 2021-08-16 04:23:15 that will stop the signs from spinning yes
help 2021-08-16 04:23:18 but it will stop the entire creation too
help 2021-08-16 04:23:21 yes the creation can spin
help 2021-08-16 04:23:29 but it cant move axis wise
help 2021-08-16 04:23:44 yes but the creation needs to move
help 2021-08-16 04:24:00 yes
help 2021-08-16 04:24:04 but it needs to m o v e
help 2021-08-16 04:24:25 
help 2021-08-16 04:24:26 ok right
help 2021-08-16 04:24:29 the bearing is fine
help 2021-08-16 04:24:30 wont spin
help 2021-08-16 04:24:41 im trying to make something that spins at mach 5 and can be moved
help 2021-08-16 04:24:49 such the reason i need a bearing
help 2021-08-16 04:25:04 so i can attach thruster to it
