creations-chat 2022-03-30 20:18:08 The turret is sorta blocky irl, and I have a custom angle for the front

creations-chat 2022-04-10 18:06:47 <@!450229047084187650> your aircraft carrier is great, mostly because of the size, however I would consider adding more detail, other than that, it‚Äôs awesome.
contest-chat 2022-09-12 04:26:38 question, does the aircraft have to have been in service or can it be an xperimental aircraft that was built but never mass produced?
contest-chat 2022-09-13 06:51:40 im building a jet that was never put into service, but 9 prototypes were built and flown, and had designated armament, that won't get disqualified?
contest-chat 2022-09-14 05:07:51 So what exactly is the premise, is the aircraft only allowed to attack other aircraft?
contest-chat 2022-09-14 05:10:54 I want to build an He-280, it is an attack aircraft, or a ‚Äúfighter aircraft‚Äù. 9 prototypes were built and were flight tested and had armament. But it was never put into service, I was told build no serviced aircraft was fine, as long as it was built, are there now nerd rules?

contest-chat 2022-09-14 05:14:59 This is what this entire dilemma feels like, are there excess rules that were not posted? Or can I just build an aircraft that was real at some point and had a gun on it intended to shoot some bitches?
