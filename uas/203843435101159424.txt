creations-chat 2019-06-10 12:39:31 Mag drive is completely made for speed, not for overall flight.
creations-chat 2019-06-10 12:41:39 1.7k speed? How is that even possible.
creations-chat 2019-06-10 12:42:18 i don't use mag drives commonly as i am a newbie and go for easier things.
help 2019-06-29 17:19:21 Hello, someone made a helicopter and wants it to be 1 single rotor for top but since it is spinning because there's only a single top rotor do you know any way to counter it?
help 2019-07-19 17:57:20 is there a way to make magnet able to weld or interact with others? thanks.
help 2019-07-19 18:57:37 already tested, doesn't work

creations-chat 2019-08-09 15:18:22 good thing about torpedoes is that they can be pretty small ( compact ).
creations-chat 2019-08-09 15:18:29 they don't need wings like rocket.
creations-chat 2019-09-06 10:19:15 By the way, why do you guys use swashplate like this? and not just a regular motor.
creations-chat 2019-09-06 10:21:34 I mean, you don't need swashplate as big as this, you could make this more simple by just putting one unpowered motor, 1 cube, then 1 motor powered and another cube on the top, And by cube I also mean wings.
creations-chat 2019-09-06 10:24:21 Unless you want a really realistic helicopter okay but, it would be only for design and mechanism since you can't really use main rotor to actually pitch or roll.
