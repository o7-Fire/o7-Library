plane-crazy 2019-12-02 06:28:27 I never used a PC without administrator so I don't know how it feels.
plane-crazy 2019-11-29 06:09:31 with 500-1000 you can also build your own pc with only purchasing the components
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 22:00:14 because right now i feel like you placed it 1 block farther than it should be
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:59:59 btw are you sure you didn't placed the motor on the wrong place
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:59:34 savoic, was it working before update
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:53:34 or use helium if that works
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:49:13 I mean, you can do more complex if you want but you can just use piston or conveyor
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:47:51 peperonni, couldn't you already do that before, even if it had to be giant to be good or you could just do it with piston
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:46:42 so I can know if I can use it to propulse torpedoes adn stuff like it
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:46:34 does conveyor top can weld?
plane-crazy 2019-11-27 21:45:33 i'm pretty sure people might try doing tank tracks with conveyor now
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 19:30:36 haven't played pf in like a year, should i try it again
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 20:19:10 1x7 blocks and 1x4 wedge all have this issue
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 20:16:47 Or slow you down af.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 20:16:33 I love how 99% of cargo planes in Plane Crazy can't cargo anything or if they do the cargo just drops out with no-sense.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 17:06:48 ( probably cause i rarely ever use this discord )
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 17:06:24 personally, i've never noticed that
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 17:05:50 unde? you mean under age? or?
plane-crazy 2019-10-26 15:14:34 Magnet range isn't that low..
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 19:52:33 i think he gets 7 robux with builder clubs.
plane-crazy 2019-08-16 19:38:06 anything
plane-crazy 2019-08-14 21:32:43 how does it even rotate in an angle?
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:00:03 or 500 triangles.
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 20:00:00 this means, a mesh will 5000 triangles will be like 1000 at 1000 studs.
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 19:59:38 it only works on meshes.
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 19:59:33 creativ actually no.
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 19:58:22 By the way, roblox's physics will get better?
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 19:57:47 R6 is godly.
plane-crazy 2019-08-10 13:22:28 Can swashplates pitch and roll?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:24:04 actually, is there landing gears on this plane?
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:21:22 or some mechanism.
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:21:05 it's impossible, you would need artificial intelligence
plane-crazy 2019-08-09 17:19:06 it would be epic if plane crazy could  be more realistic
plane-crazy 2019-07-19 13:01:02 they use legs, it's only a bit harder.
