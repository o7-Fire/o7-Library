creations-chat 2021-01-15 14:58:53 N1 / L3 almost finished
creations-chat 2021-01-15 18:07:21 I don't know if it will work, because I would have to erase a large part and it would also disturb the lock. I will try to put more details of the first stage

creations-chat 2021-09-14 01:16:34 i am building the WTC 1 and 2 :>
creations-chat 2021-09-14 01:18:48 bro I barely started building
creations-chat 2021-09-14 01:21:14 I've been busy and couldn't do it before 9/11
creations-chat 2021-09-14 02:06:58 what's the problem with me building a building? I'm not disrespecting anyone
creations-chat 2021-09-14 02:10:08 I'm just doing a tribute.
creations-chat 2021-09-14 02:20:08 To say that if I build the WTC it means I am disrespecting something is like saying that if I make a Tiger I it means I am disrespecting the Jews
creations-chat 2021-12-16 13:48:42 Did any of you already know 14-Bis before?
creations-chat 2021-12-16 13:53:05 Since you've probably never seen him in your life, here's a picture of him
creations-chat 2021-12-16 13:56:56 It was made by the Franco-Brazilian Santos Dumont, who is considered the Father of Aviation for having taken off the first heavier-than-air aircraft without using a catapult or the force of the winds to take-off.
creations-chat 2021-12-16 13:59:16 the flyer was a motorized glider, he didn't take off using only his engine
creations-chat 2021-12-16 14:28:04 want to know a curiosity?
The 14-Bis flies "in reverse" as it was made based on the flying style of a goose.
