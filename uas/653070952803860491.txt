help 2021-03-23 03:20:05 what should i do if i built a tank(panzer tiger 1 hybrid) and everytime i try to make it go forwards or backward it just glitches out?
help 2021-03-23 03:21:15 k  since i dont have the perm in server can i dm it to u?
help 2021-03-23 03:53:54 no i just found out even without a power source to go forward and backwards it does the same thing as in the clip with power to move
help 2021-03-23 03:54:55 it was a test to see if conveyers were a problem
help 2021-03-23 03:55:55 ya thats the thing its just by hitting w it does that when im in drive mode
help 2021-03-23 03:57:31 how many blocks u thinks 1 or 2
help 2021-03-23 03:58:09 i did use the .9
help 2021-03-23 03:59:48 conveyors at first then i got rid of them rn i only have small prop engines at front of the tank so it can turn and thats it
help 2021-03-23 04:00:22 conveyors have been gone
help 2021-03-23 04:01:08 should i remove the props in the front also?
help 2021-03-23 04:01:55 only the props are there and the tank still flys away
help 2021-03-23 04:02:10 i think im just screwed rn
help 2021-03-23 04:02:30 lemme check
help 2021-03-23 04:03:12 yes they are bind to turn and on on/off mode
help 2021-03-23 04:07:54 what should i do scrap the tank or just wait for a game update to see if its a bug?
help 2021-03-23 04:11:17 i remove 1 row of blocks on the turret and i still glitch
help 2021-03-23 04:29:39 i think its a lost cause i removed everything that can make it move and nothing worked if u have any final ideas let me know
