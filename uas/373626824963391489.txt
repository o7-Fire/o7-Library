creations-chat 2021-09-27 11:43:01 hot
creations-chat 2021-09-28 16:23:00 <@!206891768233328640> the nose and canopy look weird you could try fixing that too but i forgot what it actually looked like
creations-chat 2021-09-28 16:26:56 from what im seeing concerning kunos ho 229 the jet engines shouldnt stick out in front of the wings, nose should be a bit sharper, and canopy should be reworked
creations-chat 2021-09-28 16:29:03 probably limit try sending the other ones in a second message
creations-chat 2021-09-28 21:52:27 youre fuckin right i am

creations-chat 2021-09-29 21:51:45 yes
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:19:43 guys give my super cool and innovative he-162 hof pls it has motorlocks pls pls it has 60 upvotes mod do their jobs Plz plz
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:22:16 what got storm expert roles
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:26:33 why does he think its so entitled to hof it isnt that special
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:30:32 did he finally realize it isnt hof worthy and give up
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:33:58 also what do you guys reckon could be improved other than exposed motorlocks on this https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/891497988537614376 its my first motorlock build ok
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:36:22 the control surfaces?
i could probably fix it easily with motorlocking
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:38:26 how do i make inlets round i have 0 experience with motorlocking
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:40:52 thank
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:47:41 i probably wont get many aeronautical roles because i optimise all of my aircraft so without motorlocking theyre below 200 blocks and with motorlocking below 300
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:51:45 there isnt you should have higher designer ranks i think
did you request it
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:53:54 i got designer 4 in 2019 from some shitty t34 helicopter because 25 upvotes was enough for designer 4 back then
creations-chat 2021-09-30 04:56:59 this is easily worth designer 4 man ugh smh :/
creations-chat 2021-09-30 05:38:38 this is some bollocks how can this have more upvotes than my divine t34 helicopter from 2019
creations-chat 2021-09-30 10:22:19 why is block13alt trying to guilt trip us
creations-chat 2021-09-30 10:27:13 im not bullying you im telling you to improve your build um <@!622607246257422356> hot
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:03:52 those wing panels on the glass look cool
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:24:04 thats good pyramid wedges are hot
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:55:35 why is there yellow smoke coming from the jet engine also the nose is blocky
creations-chat 2021-09-30 11:58:00 the camo seems relatively fine if you ask me thats usually what my camos look like
creations-chat 2021-09-30 15:35:45 you could give it a spine

creations-chat 2021-09-30 15:47:33 ignore them nub dont be weak minded
creations-chat 2021-09-30 15:52:48 yes but why does that bother you xd
creations-chat 2021-09-30 15:56:40 what youre just saying is that youre so bothered that youre leaving the server cough cough make up your mind man it isnt a big deal
creations-chat 2021-09-30 15:59:32 youre not exposing anyone, everyone already knew the community was pretty shit but every community has a group of arse cracks, youre just making a scene for no reason, if you wanna stop uploading just say the criticism sucks ass and you resign or something
creations-chat 2021-09-30 16:01:58 i throw that word around like candy it doesnt mean anything anymore
creations-chat 2021-09-30 16:05:49 you should still be able to take criticism, if you upload something to get nothing but an echo chamber of compliments you shouldnt be looking in pcc, the problem is that the criticism usually just sucks and ends up being an insult
creations-chat 2021-09-30 16:08:03 its funny smh ugh :\

yes
creations-chat 2021-09-30 16:25:27 1x2 half wedge down on the top of the nose, also move the one on the bottom of the nose forward one block i think
yes my cockpits are usually like that too it isnt a problem

creations-chat 2021-10-01 14:00:43 air intakes forward pls wait nvm main wings were wrong not the air intakes
creations-chat 2021-10-01 14:06:10 top one probably
creations-chat 2021-10-01 16:24:30 <@!767387057286021160> does the barrel elevate
creations-chat 2021-10-01 18:49:20 to put it lightly it is quite the flawed build for example the fuselage, canopy, vertical tail wings
creations-chat 2021-10-02 00:53:24 this is an unpainted bi-1 what do i fix https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/521806371860250624/893660657440915456/unknown.png

creations-chat 2021-10-02 01:05:21 <@!647813197570506754> can i see a picture from the top
creations-chat 2021-10-02 01:14:11 i cant tell if the wings should be backwards like one block or not but seems roughly accurate to the real thing yes
np
creations-chat 2021-10-02 01:42:47 how have i managed this
creations-chat 2021-10-02 12:04:22 a draft
creations-chat 2021-10-02 12:45:08 <@!521504905693888521> the wings are thick, canopy looks weird and propeller doesnt look like a propeller
creations-chat 2021-10-02 12:47:34 <@456226577798135808> where is air intake and why is it so lankey
creations-chat 2021-10-02 12:50:00 <@!421068077556301844> can i see more perspectives of the mig-27
creations-chat 2021-10-02 12:53:45 bomber or gunship Or A Fighter Jet Of Course
creations-chat 2021-10-02 13:34:26 too narrow
creations-chat 2021-10-02 13:36:36 hot
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:01:35 why are the elevators so thick you should make them like half a block instead
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:15:57 lighting, you could set the cycle to both and wait for it to be a bit dark but not pitch black so you can still see the lights
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:17:58 upper body pose seems fine and i cant judge the legs because i cant see them
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:25:45 <@!697878770484510831> i dont think the rusty texture is good
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:38:21 yes now we can actually see the legs this is huge
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:40:24 graphics 10 is always best for pictures because it also improves the anti aliasing or whatever its called which will make the resolution look better on angled stuff so you can see more details
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:43:55 its ok

<@!237943056643522561> on 10 graphics you wont have the problem with the resolution on angled stuff here as is pictured and thus the build will generally look better, it also assists in lightning so its worth sacrificing the more pronounced red lights for
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:46:10 i think that looks way better, you could post it to creations now but i usually wait a while to see if i notice anything that could be changed
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:48:59 replace the jet engines with rockets probably since the jet engines dont look very good in plane crazy, and custom air intakes
creations-chat 2021-10-02 14:52:17 yes its significantly too tall you should finish the hull before doing anything of the superstructure next time to get a better idea of the proportions
creations-chat 2021-10-02 16:38:06 oh yes
creations-chat 2021-10-02 16:46:50 i can imagine he ends up responding just to say "it sucks bruh rebuild it bro"
creations-chat 2021-10-02 17:16:35 both but mainly quality
creations-chat 2021-10-02 23:37:37 it has been deleted from creations
creations-chat 2021-10-02 23:43:18 uh
creations-chat 2021-10-03 03:11:11 
creations-chat 2021-10-03 03:13:34 is there anything i fix on my bi1 other than the nose being like quarter of a block too short
creations-chat 2021-10-03 03:16:20 rear view (its too narrow for motorlocks to be hidden id have to bend the spacetime continuum and perform forbidden alchemy to pull it off)
creations-chat 2021-10-03 03:23:59 you speak dangerous words
creations-chat 2021-10-03 12:26:07 oh yes the bi is close to getting me expert designer
creations-chat 2021-10-03 12:29:38 technically thats still 89 :\
it said 90 upvotes and 1 downvote when i checked ok
creations-chat 2021-10-03 12:32:13 other than this yes
creations-chat 2021-10-03 12:51:50 cockpit is fine but i think the nose might be half a block too tall
creations-chat 2021-10-03 13:02:03 the most you can do to make it better is make it grey like most mig-19s so the merging wedges dont look as bad like it does here
creations-chat 2021-10-03 13:05:01 for the front yes but now its also more generic so its your choice it doesnt really make the whole thing better or worse
creations-chat 2021-10-03 13:21:14 you could make just the nose grey or black depending on what looks best and give the rest of the body the initial green color scheme with blue at the bottom
creations-chat 2021-10-03 13:24:08 making the nose the same blue color as the bottom of the plane could look cool
creations-chat 2021-10-03 13:29:28 if youre using that shade of green then yes
creations-chat 2021-10-03 13:38:29 also make the wing more slanted like this, custom angles would be even better
creations-chat 2021-10-03 13:50:12 hot but put a half triangle wedge here
creations-chat 2021-10-03 13:55:19 Shit fuck
creations-chat 2021-10-03 14:02:55 go lightbulb section, signs and text 1x1 block and copy and paste an emoji on there
creations-chat 2021-10-03 14:11:21 🥵
creations-chat 2021-10-03 14:17:59 you can look at it from the top and compare it to blueprints to see if the wings are long enough mig-19 wings are pretty long
creations-chat 2021-10-03 14:20:23 show a top view of your jet i check


<@!640250360493244455> why are there red stars on the rockets but a bosnian flag on the door
creations-chat 2021-10-03 14:26:02 yes im pretty sure thats good


<@!791544058661044245> the tank could use better color, more details and signs for tank treads so theyre thinner
creations-chat 2021-10-03 14:43:02 yes
creations-chat 2021-10-03 14:45:18 <@!640250360493244455> upload the video to streamable.com and copy from there and resend
creations-chat 2021-10-03 15:07:01 hes making a mig-19 and youre telling him to make it look more like a mig-21 Genius
creations-chat 2021-10-03 16:21:32 added some details and changed paint
creations-chat 2021-10-03 16:23:45 the trails on the tail lag me in flight for some reason so ill remove them for the version i actually use
creations-chat 2021-10-03 16:26:01 it also irrevertably ruins the balance of the plane
creations-chat 2021-10-03 16:28:25 theyre not completely different planes but theyre undeniably noticably different to some extent in almost every aspect, the mig-21 was revolutionary compared to the other migs its not just some small upgrade that goes faster and doesnt rip as fast, theyre not exactly "roughly the same thing"
creations-chat 2021-10-03 16:35:47 kamerad hans
creations-chat 2021-10-03 16:37:50 this is the sickest argument when will there be a sitcom about creations feedback
creations-chat 2021-10-03 16:41:08 the red squares on the wings to resemble the red star dont look very good it just looks more like the japanese symbol you should probably paint it grey too

<@!796795041212399657> i dont know ok ive never had that problem
creations-chat 2021-10-03 16:43:50 this is better than twitter
creations-chat 2021-10-03 16:46:45 to be fair his main wing was already finished and clearly resembled a mig-19 you did not do a great job deducting what plane it was there
creations-chat 2021-10-03 17:36:53 <@!529111635844136971> why downvote :\
creations-chat 2021-10-03 17:43:53 yes
creations-chat 2021-10-03 17:46:32 this is slightly revamped version https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/504436696021204992/894257876586086400/unknown.png
creations-chat 2021-10-03 17:48:47 what do i improve

<@456226577798135808> what does unde even mean
creations-chat 2021-10-03 17:52:02 is my bi ugly because of the few exposed motorlocks which i cant hide because the plane is less than 2 blocks wide
creations-chat 2021-10-03 17:55:50 probably but i would have no clue how to fix that since thered still be motorlocks there
creations-chat 2021-10-03 17:59:18 i havent even seen it but i am just gonna say it is lacking detail and nice colors which probably isnt wrong
creations-chat 2021-10-03 18:01:41 also you havent told me whats wrong with the bi other than saying its ugly with nothing to back it up, can you give me some feedback so i can see if theres anything wrong with it that i can actually fix
creations-chat 2021-10-03 18:05:16 youre right the nose is a bit short but its only half a block and its really hard to fix is that why you downvoted it xd
creations-chat 2021-10-03 18:07:53 its probably the fact that everything is technically wrong because its nigh impossible to make a bi look even close to perfect at this scale in plane crazy i assume its primarily the canopy because its meant to be slightly round but i couldnt pull that off in an area of 1.5x1x1
creations-chat 2021-10-03 18:11:42 i already removed the trails on the tail of the revamped bi because it ruined the balance and i couldnt fix it without removing the trails i personally value functionality over looks but im trying to make both the looks and the functionality good thats why i asked about the downvote
creations-chat 2021-10-03 18:13:58 yes thats why i still bothered to send a picture of it here to show i actually atleast thought of it and managed to put them on
creations-chat 2021-10-03 18:16:14 technically here but those were put there intentionally for decoration
its still a criminal sin of course :\
creations-chat 2021-10-03 18:54:30 the scope of his genius literally has no bounds
creations-chat 2021-10-03 18:58:06 yes but wip builds arent allowed in creations you were meant to post it here 

<@!853042393309904897> hot
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:01:29 nop was talking to the other guy
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:14:40 mine arent for decoration mine are just there because the plane is quite literally too tiny for them to be hidden apart from the ones at the main wings but those would require 3 extra layers of motorlock which i couldnt be arsed to do
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:22:06 i dont build tanks but i think its fine looks pretty detailed and well shaped
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:29:44 xd
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:53:44 the porportions of the type 90 seem relatively fine he couldve hardly seen such a small offset of like less than half a fuckin block anyway
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:55:47 well yes but you get the point ok i personally wouldnt say thats worth downvoting for, the details are amazing
creations-chat 2021-10-03 19:58:50 unless its my upcoming fuso which will totally be perfect yes 🤙 it will be put in hof 17 times
creations-chat 2021-10-03 22:36:17 <@!398300194258550784> is that the thing from code geass

creations-chat 2021-10-05 14:25:22 tnt is better for optimisation because the block just disappears so if you only play in vips or pvp servers you should use tnt its more handy for low end pcs ok

creations-chat 2021-10-05 18:55:46 i like my helicopters a bit fast
creations-chat 2021-10-05 18:58:41 no then it should just have good guns and stability
creations-chat 2021-10-05 19:02:16 rockets and fireworks are good on helicopters, if you use normal guns youll be shot down by some car with a giant turret before you can immobilize them, youd wanna use explosive stuff so you can hit them first and actually be efficient
creations-chat 2021-10-05 19:15:05 theres no way he doesnt just recycle it again
creations-chat 2021-10-06 10:24:54 <@574459801770393601> where suspension

creations-chat 2021-10-08 19:13:10 wrong i measured with studio and the proportiones are precisely correct i spent 5x as long on the hull as i shouldve to make sure of that. proportions are fine

top view
creations-chat 2021-10-08 19:15:41 that size is fine but the hull 🤢
creations-chat 2021-10-08 19:20:51 this is the sickest plane
creations-chat 2021-10-08 19:24:03 those are some sexy bricks on the side improving the aerodynamics wow this is simply genius
creations-chat 2021-10-09 10:05:23 <@!747811503591129170> you could try fixing the proportions and air intakes other than that good build
creations-chat 2021-10-09 11:01:24 ok

creations-chat 2021-10-10 11:35:49 if it isnt based off of anything i dont like the color

it looked like it was based off of something ok
creations-chat 2021-10-10 11:37:56 i dont like the color scheme
creations-chat 2021-10-10 11:40:35 the color scheme makes it look like a demon you get from writing scribbles on the wall with period blood (sarcasm dont give me feedback blacklist ok)
creations-chat 2021-10-10 11:42:40 make it look more like this :/
creations-chat 2021-10-10 11:44:55 i cant just name a color scheme you have to try other colors yourself

creations-chat 2021-11-11 18:14:18 why is it that color oh yes
creations-chat 2021-11-11 18:19:00 it could look cool if you make the cockpit look more like an apache's i think

<@!611251614178869269> you are looking to square up Ehh
creations-chat 2021-11-11 18:30:56 they say im the fastest in the west do not underestimate my agility
creations-chat 2021-11-11 18:33:19 youve made a dangerous decision for i am a master of muay thai
creations-chat 2021-11-11 18:35:32 we should help raf_aircraft i think hes having a stroke
creations-chat 2021-11-11 18:41:26 you should change the half wedges on the canopy with white half wedges so it looks more like this
creations-chat 2021-11-11 18:58:50 hes talking about the ballast but itll be hard to add with a working rudder as well
creations-chat 2021-11-11 19:00:55 i would just skip it
creations-chat 2021-11-12 17:42:20 <@456226577798135808> paint the locked motor in the nose cone black
creations-chat 2021-11-18 16:10:04 uh umm
creations-chat 2021-11-19 16:49:33 ice weighs less too
creations-chat 2021-11-20 02:49:19 who gives a shit if his plane looks like an egg

<@!697893501274161325> yes why
creations-chat 2021-11-20 02:55:28 it flies and has more than 5 blocks stop whining and bugger off

pictured is symionboss ugh
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:00:57 bringing politics into unrelated arguments is the best strategy ok
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:04:03 <@!847981335078895680> also change color of your plane pls
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:06:06 just a different shade maybe darker, i cant get color codes right now
creations-chat 2021-11-20 03:11:08 evil man
creations-chat 2021-11-22 14:06:05 <@!720891502108344360> can i see an eagle eye view of the plane so i can see the wings better
creations-chat 2021-11-22 14:13:16 looks better than i thought
creations-chat 2021-11-22 21:03:41 the hull sucks, and if this is a custom build the superstructure is pretty boring, the overload of little turrets obscure the deck, if you wanna fix the hull i can give an example later on what i think the right technique is, and for superstructure just look for inspiration
creations-chat 2021-11-22 21:05:55 what
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:03:46 the only people who criticised his build gave actual valid and useful criticism
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:13:19 <@!784805177517539349> you could make the hull look more like this (technique wise)
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:15:28 itll still look fine from the top, yours just looks blocky as fuck and has no shape to it
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:20:42 building it like this first is a good way to get logical patterns which helps getting the shape right


<@!738086786970026035> yes
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:25:35 but now the one time someone gets actual valid criticism in this god forsaken horrid channel youre convincing the guy its just ''rudeness'', ive never seen you complain here when someone is actually being entirely shit on and harassed for no reason
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:29:44 i know it looks shit ok but it looks better from every other angle i promise pls
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:34:17 it isnt really happening now though, you shouldnt convince him its mere rudeness, his hull doesnt have a good shape like real hulls do which isnt opinion based you can clearly tell by comparing it to better built hulls, and now he obviously isnt a immediately a pro or anything i still actually bothered to remember leaving what i was initially playing and joining plane crazy just to show this guy with an inferiority complex how i think he should handle the hull

whats happening now is absolutely fine compared to the shit you see here half of the time
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:37:03 also if youre remotely interested i can show you ingame its actually much better than it looks on that picture with the shitty angle ok
creations-chat 2021-11-22 22:58:44 its a work of art man
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:05:54 if anyone wants to have a good laugh dm 2014naenaesavage saying criticism is subjective 🤫
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:22:11 is there something wrong with it i was just pointing out the hull style wont affect the look from the top
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:24:33 i might, but i wanna finish the superstructure first since its a fuso and thats much harder than the hull on this (top view) fuso irl
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:29:18 <@!798957190399524865> you were talking about these parts right
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:32:00 did this relieve the agony or is it actually shit
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:34:57 blender crashes my pc because my pc is garbage ok i cant use blender to build ships instead
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:37:25 though you have a point this part in particular is garbage it sticks out way too much
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:40:07 and i should probably make the shape here go more like this
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:47:02 me or the other guy
no idea where to check but pretty sure its 2.91
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:50:03 it came out on the 25th of november 2020 xd
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:52:17 wise
creations-chat 2021-11-22 23:58:47 its nenuu's magnum opus hes never topping such a masterpiece man
creations-chat 2021-11-24 23:16:20 <@456226577798135808> ok jet but pls pls fix this pls
creations-chat 2021-11-25 00:39:13 <@!693888535266197586> you forgot to put a space between 2010 and the block count
creations-chat 2021-11-25 13:58:35 no because yours looks like a crossbreed of a delorean and a urus pls use reference pic next time ok also color shade isnt correct
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:05:54 experience, just keep building shit and when youve built enough shit it starts to become less shit dont bother uploading it here since you wont get any criticism from the people here
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:09:29 youve only been building for like a year assuming you havent played very long when you uploaded your first creation, ive built since like mid-late 2019 and id still be considered mediocre it takes more time than you think unless you take the game way too seriously
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:13:34 Abdul
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:15:56 small aircraft best :\
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:19:11 send video of it driving i care more about functionality when it comes to ground vehicles
i wanna see if theres anything special about it
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:25:04 thats not very special also the rear suspension seems a bit weak
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:27:06 but i dont hate your builds send the supra no balls
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:29:11 color pls and i can already tell from this angle that the rear window is probably completely wrong the rest seems ok
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:31:52 <@!354280132569071616> that guys blue jet looks pro
<@!817843440191930430> did you make that
creations-chat 2021-11-25 18:34:36 its good
creations-chat 2021-11-25 19:40:29 ive made the hull much less agonizing to look at the curves are now actually logical
creations-chat 2021-11-26 17:23:25 does the turret work
creations-chat 2021-11-27 14:09:24 genius
creations-chat 2021-11-27 17:03:47 hot
creations-chat 2021-11-28 00:23:53 <@456226577798135808> why is the bow so long
creations-chat 2021-11-28 00:25:56 <@!683889176650973187> why did you motorlock
creations-chat 2021-11-28 00:29:45 you should just use actual wing panels and delta wings for the main wings because they have the wrong shape now
creations-chat 2021-11-28 05:59:19 it looks like a monster truck
creations-chat 2021-12-01 21:42:36 his ping is the best part
creations-chat 2021-12-02 11:11:14 what the fuck
creations-chat 2021-12-02 11:35:28 the cockpit is a much bigger issue how do i delete this image on mobile i did not mean to do this help im not going to bollocking delete the entire message with this slowmode ok
creations-chat 2021-12-02 11:38:33 its a holy image i must not get rid of it even if i can also yes make the cockpit less big
creations-chat 2021-12-02 11:42:06 both and better shape because that looks like the cockpit from my mid 2019 eurofighter typhoon that even back then got absolutely shit on
creations-chat 2021-12-02 11:44:23 
creations-chat 2021-12-02 11:58:19 these were the days
creations-chat 2021-12-02 12:29:24 still a bit too long
creations-chat 2021-12-02 12:31:44 try making the cockpit look more like that of an f22 or f35 it probably fits the design of your jet
creations-chat 2021-12-02 13:02:49 too long <@!744591826891046943> and make the top of the cockpit more flat and the front less angled than the back
creations-chat 2021-12-02 13:04:54 it was garbage in the entirety of 2019
creations-chat 2021-12-02 13:07:29 motorlock isnt important imo i dont get why people nowadays learn to motorlock before learning to actually build
motorlocking should just be for when you can already build well with traditional techniques so you can make shit even better, if youre good at actually building normally motorlocking wont be a big learning curve
creations-chat 2021-12-02 13:09:40 i tried camera locking before and i couldnt get along with it but that was me trying to construct a canopy with it which probably isnt a good idea
creations-chat 2021-12-02 13:12:04 now add a spine
creations-chat 2021-12-02 13:18:22 <@456226577798135808> this was my first motorlocked build its not bad not great just a small improvement over normally building and i learn more advanced motorlocking from here
creations-chat 2021-12-02 13:21:53 why did you ping support xd
creations-chat 2021-12-02 13:28:48 isnt he meant to ping a mod
creations-chat 2021-12-02 13:30:53 im braindead
creations-chat 2021-12-03 15:32:02 how would that work better what
creations-chat 2021-12-03 15:34:52 why does it only go like 300 speed
creations-chat 2021-12-03 15:37:01 at that speed it should have absolutely no problem going up using the elevators as intended id call it a design flaw
creations-chat 2021-12-03 18:09:48 holland is an evil place (region)
creations-chat 2021-12-03 21:43:02 last question yes thats what this channel is for
creations-chat 2021-12-03 21:45:47 add more variation in the color by giving it like a camo and make the overall shade darker, add actual holes in the air intakes if you can and fix this pls, but if you arent trying to make it as good as possible then yes you can post
creations-chat 2021-12-04 23:27:21 what does double's t72 look like
creations-chat 2021-12-04 23:30:59 i like double's t72 more
creations-chat 2021-12-14 14:13:39 it took me 10 minutes to learn youll be fine ok
creations-chat 2021-12-14 14:16:18 not nowadays since with the inflated prices you cant even get a good gpu with 761 dollars
creations-chat 2021-12-14 14:19:37 choosing a mig-21 isnt a mistake unless he prioritises upvotes over an actually good creation
creations-chat 2021-12-27 20:50:26 isnt the tail too skinny
creations-chat 2021-12-27 21:37:29 proportions and nose
creations-chat 2022-01-10 22:57:05 oh yes i must check this out
creations-chat 2022-01-10 23:00:24 message #ricke139
creations-chat 2022-01-12 01:43:57 oh yes
creations-chat 2022-01-12 12:56:19 this isnt unironic right
creations-chat 2022-01-12 13:00:52 is he unironically trying to convince us he painted this with his hands irl
creations-chat 2022-01-12 13:10:32 more effort went into it than a modern art piece from damien hirst atleast
creations-chat 2022-01-12 13:19:05 youve got an eye for detail youre destined for great things
creations-chat 2022-01-16 06:40:58 camo is ok wings look weird
creations-chat 2022-01-16 19:07:26 yes
creations-chat 2022-01-16 19:18:35 i dont know if youre motorlocking that jet or not but if not you could maybe make it something like this i think itd look good but you should see for yourself (colored version is so you can see the parts)
creations-chat 2022-01-19 06:54:12 oh no hars downvoted it shit shit
creations-chat 2022-01-19 14:47:04 hars didnt downvote my bi-1 because he didnt see it and therefore i am top tier builder
creations-chat 2022-01-19 14:49:52 what is your opinion
creations-chat 2022-01-19 14:53:17 i fixed that on a more recent version ok
creations-chat 2022-01-19 14:56:00 i couldnt hide that piston because its like a 1.2 block space ok

@C.#3279 that version with slightly changed canopy has way less details because i optimised it so it wouldnt lag my shit pc sec i send shit fuck the ping no longer works
creations-chat 2022-01-19 14:58:40 <@456226577798135808> this is optimised version but it has slightly better canopy dont ask why its white
creations-chat 2022-01-19 15:00:49 you forgot to point out that the nose is wrong smh my head
creations-chat 2022-01-19 15:11:38 think so
creations-chat 2022-01-19 15:18:26 pyotr
creations-chat 2022-01-19 15:36:45 we are up and running for we are nuts 🔥 🤑 💪
creations-chat 2022-01-19 17:08:21 building good looking custom landing gear is a giant pain in the ass ok

real
creations-chat 2022-01-20 17:47:34 the proportions are all bollocked
creations-chat 2022-01-20 17:50:53 
creations-chat 2022-01-20 17:52:57 you made the air intakes a bit too big and every single angle is wrong (or the wings are just extremely massive)
creations-chat 2022-01-20 17:55:57 angle locking those wings might be a huge pain in the ass but if you want it to be as good as possible you should try it, i also suggest you severely angle lock the entire nose section since thats like the hottest part of the f22 ok
creations-chat 2022-01-20 20:18:23 2 designer roles > 2 expert roles
creations-chat 2022-01-21 17:29:50 i almost reposted it but then saw yousuf was squaring up
creations-chat 2022-01-21 17:32:17 smart move
creations-chat 2022-01-21 17:34:36 🤤
creations-chat 2022-01-22 04:13:52 the rear just cuts off but its meant to be just 2 jet engines and a ballast
creations-chat 2022-01-22 04:17:57 like theres little to no space between the two jet engines since they are meant to curve inwards a bit, but you didnt curve it at all and now theyre completely seperated (youll probably need motorlock and custom angle to make it anything remotely like the real thing)
creations-chat 2022-01-22 04:19:59 you could try doing it without motorlock first since learning to actually build is more important than learning tricks, you could also make your life easier and learn it on an entirely new jet so you can start with the motorlock tower from yt tutorial and build it onto that so its easier to learn, you could rebuild the j22 later on instead of getting stuck up with this one
