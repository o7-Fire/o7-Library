plane-crazy 2020-07-17 19:32:11 has anyone made like really compact swashplates
plane-crazy 2020-07-14 14:31:05 he is speaking the language of gods

plane-crazy 2020-07-01 18:41:57 the ingame chat was already breaking minutes before the server actually died
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 18:41:46 i think i only lost a few blocks of progress on my carrier luckily
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 18:40:15 and no i am not out of funs for vip server
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 18:40:01 just not vips

plane-crazy 2020-07-01 18:39:31 i cant join at all
plane-crazy 2020-07-01 18:39:09 did anyone else's server just shut down out of nowhere

plane-crazy 2020-06-21 20:32:32 will this include a shit ton of new wedges or just stairs
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 20:32:24 i couldnt read update message in time
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 20:32:15 i see
plane-crazy 2020-06-21 20:32:07 update?
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 17:16:37 why am i like the only person with this bug aaa
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 17:16:31 ok acc tried it and he could shoot at 187
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 17:10:27 is it normal that you cant shoot the fireworks when you go above like 20 speed
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 17:10:16 i have question
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:54:51 and make it normal color not red
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:54:42 turn maus into helicopter then post it
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:54:13 i got it because i had 24 likes on t-34 helicopter i think
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:53:27 i dont think anyone that has over an hour of playtime on this game sincerely likes this map acc
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:52:58 this isnt suggestion channel but yes ok
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:52:45 mainly more water
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:52:41 im sure most people would want just more terrain and more flat parts and maybe have the water go all around the map if that isnt too much
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:52:21 have they ever considered getting a new map maker if thats even necessary
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:52:06 i see
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:51:14 would remaking the entire map and supposedly expanding it break the game too xd
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:50:43 we all have freedom of opinions yes yes
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:50:30 if i dm rick about the island hed probably say the majority wants to keep it and im not about to start a revolution
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:48:37 war thunder hot game
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:48:18 yope acc
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:48:05 my points are invalid because i ironically said im uneducated
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:47:56 yes exo absolutely
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:47:37 not saying they should add bigger plots
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:47:22 at this point if the game is so limited that they cant even add bigger plots they would probably gain more from rewriting all 2500 lines of code
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:46:42 im not saying its not
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:46:24 yes
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:46:23 i have absolutely no idea what youre on about
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:45:58 proo
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:45:41 im uneducated stop confusing me plsss
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:45:36 isnt that the same thing as a mustang
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:45:19 yoo is that a mustang
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:45:07 the games code has to be as shit as that yandare sim game
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:44:53 complete bullshit
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:44:39 i dont actually script but im pretty sure anyone who does would agree this is a scapegoat
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:44:00 you see adding bigger plots is totally connected to the entire games code and will make it absolutely erupt
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:43:43 i reckon ricks gonna say it breaks the games code to remove it because its hard coded
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:43:30 this is the best feature that theyve added
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:43:23 yes its so much fun to be on the island and fly into the propellers
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:41:25 its bitten me in the ass in a dogfight
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:41:20 so youre saying youd rather have the island than the ability to fly near it without risks
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:40:31 i see
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:40:21 i did answer your question though
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:40:17 i was asking why its here and i didnt really get an answer
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:39:59 are we on the same page here
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:39:55 i dont remember asking the island to be taken down
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:39:24 ok
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:38:46 also sometimes when im not paying attention to where im flying i accidentally fly into the propellers
plane-crazy 2020-05-04 16:38:15 1 egg hunt ended like a week ago 
2 they had ''final day'' in the title for like 3 days 
3 for people with as shit of a pc as mine with a cpu worse than an i3 and no money to get a better cpu it actually lags when you get close to it

plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:40:04 idk
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:40:02 maybe your pc isnt that good and textures make you lag a bit
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:39:15 those are the only textures with additional features i think
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:39:05 ice is slippery and fabric has more grip
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:36:55 explanation pls
plane-crazy 2019-10-04 22:36:47 superstrength made my magnet drive plane slower

plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:34:28 ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:34:15 basically i should make prototypes before straight up making them inside the sub
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:34:01 ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:32:34 delta surfaces wouldnt work
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:31:32 basically removing the 1x2 deltas
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:31:17 they didnt help so i might change them back to normal wings
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:31:07 9 blocks tall with weird wings
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:31:03 
plane-crazy 2019-09-27 22:30:28 ive changed the wing designs a couple times

plane-crazy 2019-09-13 14:20:48 rick pro 😎
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 14:20:42 he did it
plane-crazy 2019-09-13 14:20:36 rick is a fucking legend
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 19:01:52 rickur why do have savedata to begin with
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 19:01:20 wait why do we have save data
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 19:00:55 rick pro
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 19:00:53 ok
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 19:00:48 fuming
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 19:00:45 i thought he fixed it
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:52:50 fuming
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:52:39 i have maxangle option without servo too
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:52:34 <@!221487880487436288> wdym
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:49:52 makes it like a normal motor but with reset mode
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:49:32 but realistic aerodynamics too complicated
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:49:22 <@351809528209080324> pretty much
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:49:11 no
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:48:46 he told me he fixed it already for new servers
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:48:35 maybe to act on normal blocks too
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:48:28 are aerodynamics ever gonna be improved
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:48:23 rick
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:42:32 i know but what if its optional
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:42:00 rick can this be considered yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:39:20 can you make an option for the motor so that it doesnt aim at your own blocks when you hover your cursor over them its really annoying sometimes
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:38:40 wait rick
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:35:00 pro
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:33:44 i have no idea what any of the things rick just said mean
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:31:31 do you mean how much save data a save uses
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:31:19 whats datacost
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:28:21 which is annoying
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:28:15 you know how like when you for example mount a mouse controled turret onto your plane and when you hover your cursor over the plane itself the turret will aim at the plane
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:27:44 i wanna tell rick to fix something but i dont know how to explain it
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:27:13 yeas
plane-crazy 2019-09-10 18:26:29 what was wrong with the camera
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:15:12 thx
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:14:18 <@456226577798135808> sorry for ping but can you send me link to testing server
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:09:20 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:09:06 and useful
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:08:58 it will make stabilizers much more immersive
plane-crazy 2019-09-09 20:08:47 i cant wait till the motor update drops
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:59:32 its good for motorized flaps too
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:59:16 cant wait yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:59:11 turret fortresses will be even better when this new update drops
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:54:12 roblox is so shit i swear to god
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:53:46 avatar page is unavailable what the fuck
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:43:07 do you mean ''uwu''
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:42:45 which word
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:42:34 hes idle
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:42:27 he is fuming
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:41:59 cool cool
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:41:58 when my zeppelin thing is finished it will weigh almost nothing after i add around 102 helium blocks
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:40:17 if it doesnt work i will fit magnet engines in it
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:40:10 im gonna go for helium and rotors for now
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:39:14 neutronium using affective magnet engines on a 3700+ block build is gonna make it 60 times as laggy as it already is i think
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:36:38 not very original i know but yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:36:27 im working on internal rotors to make it turn, go up and down, and forward and backward
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:35:49 i need to make it functional first
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:35:07 im working on big ugly chunky zeppelin thing
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:34:03 i accept defeat
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:33:47 yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:33:30 he actually listens to what the community wants unlike most other roblox devs
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:33:08 also rick is god for making the thing in <#529858892075761694>
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:30:37 i have no idea how to make working aerodynamics in a roblox game but he could make it act on normal blocks too
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:29:57 the aerodynamics arent that advanced though
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:26:59 can i join in
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:26:28 ok i tested it and its about 38 stacked blocks that a beam can lift
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:24:07 how many units of blocks
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:24:03 i mean like
plane-crazy 2019-09-07 17:23:33 how many blocks does a helium beam lift
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:34:37 hi cooly
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:34:28 guys watch my livestream to see construction of cool plane yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:33:21 ok pro
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:33:14 can i livestream in the holy shrine yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:33:08 robo
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:32:23 but the friend is contributing in my server
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:32:14 no i mean so other people can watch too
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:31:18 i am making cool su-35 with thrust vectoring ok yes
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 20:31:09 in which vc can i do livestream with friend
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 09:43:36 do 15 year olds capitalise "xd"
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 09:09:53 i only know three types of lag ping physics lag and the lag you get when spamming too much of blocks
plane-crazy 2019-09-06 09:09:00 what does rick mean with server lag
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:31:57 that looks like good old soviet is-3
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:30:51 but its not even close to that
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:30:43 i had expected like something similar to the alreadye xisting delta wings
plane-crazy 2019-09-04 17:30:30 the new control surfaces are in my opinion trash
plane-crazy 2019-08-30 17:34:49 yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:15:43 irl its probably like 50m tall yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:15:02 lovely isnt it
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:14:48 the superstructure that was already big as hell is now also oversize on that
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:14:25 ijn fuso big pro
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:12:35 that doesnt look futuristic that just looks like a drone that realistically doesnt work
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:11:55 my motherboard is that alien mothership
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:11:49 proo
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:11:29 no motherboard can handles thatr
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:11:19 did you find an entirely new pc in area 51
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:10:42 i99 exist yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:10:32 i run plane crazy 8 graphics 26 fps
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:10:26 my pc right now is probably the worst in this server]
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:10:10 i get better pc soon
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:10:06 oh i cant do that
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:10:02 oh
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:09:52 so gamering
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:09:50 me too
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:09:12 that was sarcastic and really funny no questions
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:08:57 me big flex on you! me pro!
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:08:49 i have 83 subs and no videos
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:08:30 they didnt go supersonic
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:07:58 i think jet engine aircrafts were post ww2
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:07:35 ww2 planes are propeller engines
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:07:18 i have no clue if canada has a good military or not i was saying it as a joke
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:06:55 xd
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:06:12 flayer are you american
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:05:52 canada have better military than usa you ssee yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:04:55 since it slows down plane
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:04:51 i think speed completely replaces the purpose of armor
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:03:31 plastic
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:03:10 i faked my birth date too when making my accounts but im actually 14 and almost 15 😎
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:02:33 why cant they commit soviet heavy tank in wt that has 400m armor and still is fast
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:01:57 so they all have bad armour and cant rely on it at all
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:01:31 arent all modern fighter jets supersonic
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:00:24 but mig-25 can still clap the a-10 as well
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 18:00:12 i think a-10 can penetrate mig-25 pretty easy
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:59:43 the mig-25 frame breaks when going mach-3+ for more than 5 minutes xd
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:59:10 ok for the record i meant mig
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:58:59 why am i so fucking stupid
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:58:55 why did i say fucking big
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:58:35 but i know big-25 has some sexy ass air intakes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:58:27 i have no clue how good an a-10 is
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:58:16 hmm
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:57:47 to base or moving part
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:57:37 will this connect
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:56:37 its more realistic
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:56:31 i like it because of the killing system
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:55:57 wait are there polish tanks in wot
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:55:35 lets start petition to have polish vehicles added to wt
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:55:16 irl it cool
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:55:12 oh
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:55:11 no is-7 is cool
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:54:54 that kills is-7
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:54:48 yues that
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:54:43 oh you mean that kv2 v2
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:54:29 polish tanks look good though
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:54:22 ok
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:54:17 is fv4005 a polish tank
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:53:44 im gonna make fridge turret and put magnets in it and clap shells into people at 3000 speed to fling them
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:33:25 arent these shitty commit jokes like 4 months old
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:32:32 commit neck rope GHAHAHHA
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:32:24 hahahHBAHAHAHAHAH
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:32:20 hahahhaa
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:31:12 understandable
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:30:50 no not really
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:30:06 this chasis is really bad and generic and i put too many suspensions should i remove some to reduce lag
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:28:41 nothing else
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:28:33 right there
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:28:28 that should just be the thumbnail
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:27:54 sad
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:27:14 it probably is just slow because of the lag
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:27:07 i doubt it has bad steering
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:25:56 people who use rockets for cars instead of making them move using just actualy wheels and motorized wheels are a disgrace
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:23:31 wow you must be fuming
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:23:09 has anybody ever made a working zeppelin before using only rotors to fly
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:21:49 its really anticlimactic right now
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:21:44 tnt should make sound
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:21:01 i dont think anybody has ever made an artillery cannon that benefitted you in pvp before
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:20:32 has anybody ever tried making an extremely laggy magnet drive submarine before
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:19:53 you place a magnet and click a key!! so unique mechanism!!!
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:19:36 yes!!
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:19:26 but with explosive shells
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:19:19 no railgun artillery doesnt exist but its basically just a railgun
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:18:56 havent loads of people made gustav before
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:18:34 my grammer is big yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:18:12 railgun artillery is use magnets yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:18:07 the tnt doesnt explode if you shoot them using magnets and i dont wanna use rockets because thats not how artillery works
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:17:39 twice
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:17:35 ive tried making artillery
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:17:29 ok i make communist jellyfish
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:17:01 if so then im not gonna try it
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:16:50 wait does the minutes and hours need to be accurate because then i need to spend hours purely testing and tweaking a mechanism that probably already works i just need to edit the speed of the motors
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:16:11 ok give me a sec i try
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:16:01 has anybody made a working clock before
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:15:28 im not sure if a jellyfish is a mechanism
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:15:08 what mechanisms havent been tried yet
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:15:03 you have to make a new mechanism?
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:14:53 wait how to get inventor
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:14:39 yes i get alot of upvotes with it yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:14:33 im gonna watch videos on jellyfish swimming and then im gonna try making one yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:13:44 feel like itll be buggy as hell though
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:13:28 sounds cool
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:13:25 i might try that
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:13:22 jellyfish
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:13:18 wait actually
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:12:40 kraken eating ekrano plan
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:12:27 somebody make ekrano plan already
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:11:47 it was something and 9
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:11:36 wait no i think less than 70
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:11:21 like 79
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:10:58 whats wrong with reset mode
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:09:07 im pretty sure light grey is good if you wanna blend in day and night
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:08:52 wdym shuya
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:08:35 tghat looked like russians surrounding the germans in wwII
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:08:01 xd
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:07:06 that will probably be too slow to fly because of physics lag after i add so many motors and moving parts
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:06:30 im not sure if i should edit the la-174 or make a very cool spitfire
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:05:25 i was scared he removed the previous ones but he didnt luckily
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:05:13 yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:04:51 since its really complicated
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:04:47 that will be hard as hell to script though i think
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:04:40 maybe rick will improve it in the future im not sure
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:04:34 the aerodynamics arent very advanced at all, there barely is any ''aerodynamics''
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:03:33 yes
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:03:08 and it needs that thing at the bottom at the rear end
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:02:59 i think the cockpit needs to be better and the rudder needs to be bigger
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 17:02:48 <@351809528209080324> what do you think
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:55:18 danny is too cool to be pinged for no reason
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:54:38 it has air intake in front
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:53:48 but im too lazy to remove it
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:53:43 but the first person view is shit
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:53:38 i thought it would aim better for first person
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:53:32 that
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:53:31 oh
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:53:07 wdym
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:52:41 the front looks dodgy as hell though but i have no clue how to fix that
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:52:19 here is my la-174
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:51:01 help me pls
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:50:56 nobody finds it funny
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:50:47 like its just permanently inked into my brain to use bad grammar
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:50:34 that was terrible grammar on purpose i dont know why i do it all the time
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:50:14 danny you is cool mod
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:49:52 good
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:49:41 dont check logs pls
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:49:28 good riddance love you nohomo
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:49:21 ok bye
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:48:54 i think the front is bad because theres no longer wedges and he didnt want to make it bigger so he has to use a single wedge for the shape
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:47:49 you asked us to rate your blackbird destined
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:47:21 cockpit is a bit shitty but the rest is decent i think
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:47:07 mig-25
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:47:04 i made this yesterday
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:46:08 that shape looks cool
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:45:48 that looks way more sophisticated than it should be i think
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:45:40 oh those things
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:45:29 n
plane-crazy 2019-08-27 16:45:13 invent now

plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:10:52 my budget is not big
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:10:16 and im pretty sure an i7 thats better than a 9th gen i5 is expensive as shit
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:09:45 i dont think i need an i7 to run war thunder and roblox
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:09:03 its like 400 euroes
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:08:34 what i have now is utter trash
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:08:26 when i get a new pc its gonna have an i5 (forgot which gen but 9th i think or something), 500gb ssd, and idk wtf the graphics card was but its a big improvement from what i have now
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 03:00:00 in my opinion its not better its just different in a way that i enjoy it more
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:59:19 i like war thunder tanks most mainly because of kill/damaging system
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:58:05 span

plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:30:12 wasnt there like a way that the plane would follow your mouse? i am quite new and i noticed this from yt videos
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:28:18 i might have to make some adjustments in that case
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:28:10 oh wth how did u make them look good
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:26:37 i am not on pc rn and i need to fix the wings

plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:24:02 unironically
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:23:58 im making a mig-29 and it looks very very similar to the one on yt
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:23:02 in the finished product yes, but it can be a real pain in the ass when building things
plane-crazy 2019-07-02 02:22:37 pretty cool

plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:23:30 why do lovely kids keep leaving every pvp server after 3 minutes
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:22:20 they should add a 50 second cooldown then
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:21:58 they should censor spaces too then
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:21:19 aaaa
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:21:06 was that considered nsfw
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:20:15 stop before u show all the underaged here!!
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:19:34 no way in any physical parallel universe
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:19:26 their brainc apacity cannot fathem that
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:18:55 so they can only talk in hashtags xd
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:18:35 they should censor fungam too
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:18:08 apart from 69
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:18:03 yes pls xd
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:17:19 im pretty sure wayyyyy back in the day there wasnt a filter at all
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:15:16 im from late 2015 and i dont remember this feature
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:14:43 they should only be allowed to say very few things
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:14:33 all remote and slight ''hatred'' should just get censored
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:14:13 or chat
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:14:01 yes xd
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 03:13:32 itll make for a hilarious scene

plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:28:07 ok
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:27:41 the only reason i dont want all furries to disappear from the universe is because i like throwing empty kvass bottles at them
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:26:59 f a c c
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:25:31 tupolev superior
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:25:16 do NOT bomb motherland
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:25:05 exa
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:24:54 didnt show up
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:24:51 i did search his whole name
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:24:43 there are a couple thousand names with funga in it
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:24:19 and there are millions of names with fun in it
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:24:13 but anything with ''fungam'' in it gets censored
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:23:56 i did
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:23:33 <@!427466925275217931> friend me on roblox cuz ''fungam'' gets censored in the search bar
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:21:21 if its bombing anime ill join in
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:21:15 you mean a bomber bombing FOR anime, or BOMBING anime?
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:20:47 i think that would make blocks alot more laggier
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:20:21 <:Upvote:490311647492309004>
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:20:04 perfect if you ask me
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:19:33 the netherlands is epic 😎
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:19:27 then
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:18:43 hope not
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:18:04 you see thats why russian flag and polish-lithuanian commonwealth flag are most epic
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:17:48 the american flag is similar to a chess board so i approve of it
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:17:15 that was my master plan all along
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:16:57 do that
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:16:55 yes empire
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:16:27 **@**vipEmpire#3843 hello comrade
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:16:06 also np
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:16:02 i should probably stop pinging people this often when theyre just in chat xd
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:15:46 <@263770097288609794> yer a legend
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:11:58 so i can still be slavic
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:11:52 im from the netherlands so technically i am western but you see the netherlands is the good western
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:11:38 kommerad from what country are you
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:10:53 ill join you
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:10:51 shit i just left
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:10:46 wait let me see how fast the typhoon goes in a dive
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:10:19 is that epic baguette plane
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:10:10 any small plane that goes that fast will spaz
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:09:59 but its still 100% stable at that speed tho so im fine with it
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:09:28 it tops horizontally at 590 sps
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:09:22 also what i said in dm was false alarm
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:08:51 mine go unstable at 400 sps
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:08:38 im horrible
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:08:29 i have never made a stable small plane before
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:08:21 you have to teach me ur ways of small planes
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:08:15 kommerad
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:08:00 it can pound the base ''runway'' at 560 sps
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:07:25 this plane is decently fast
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:06:58 please tell me i wont get warned for saying blyat
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:06:48 that plane is blyatiful
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:06:18 thats epic as hell
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:06:13 <@!249373398612967441> local fucking madman
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:05:43 i mean when it goes like 320 block+
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:05:18 bigger designs are always stable at high speeds
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:05:04 my small jets are failures
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:04:59 i mocked irl jets because i feel like theyre frames are good and aerodynamic
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:04:44 i am fucking terrible at this game
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:04:35 well you see
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:03:29 dm me something epic u made <@!249373398612967441>
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:02:50 get span
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:02:49 i just accidentally said thx to an insult
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:02:38 thx
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:02:37 ill try it on the next fighter jet ill make tho
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:02:19 id rather boatload it with rockets
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:01:49 why the hell would i put a propeller engine on a typhoon xd?
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:01:07 **so i had to turn the wings into a whole pile o flaps**
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:00:59 in case you mean those, **you see it would not fucking fly up or roll**
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:00:32 main wing is massive wings right
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 02:00:20 wait you mean the tail or the massive wings?
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:59:59 well you see
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:59:03 the whole thing is filled with either fuel or super rockets
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:58:55 these big rockets are just for detail
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:58:19 just make your whole entire plane frames out of fuel blocks like i did
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:58:09 wanna see my engine mate?
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:58:03 infinite fuel makes it less immersive
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:56:42 for jet fighters i always aim towards a minimum of 16000 fuel
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:56:25 i probably should enable infinite fuel cuz i already can barely get a plane flying properly and now i have to worry about fuel too
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:55:44 people who play with infinite fuel disabled are epic 😎
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:50:17 i painted whole enterior black
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:49:03 i also just realised two large rockets werent on
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:48:43 let me change the blue block to black
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:48:18 the blue block is kinda ehhh
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:48:11 this looks epic right
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:47:29 it has more impact than you think
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:47:24 dont bombs explode on water irl too?
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:45:18 i never flew near water in first person lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:45:00 subs are gonna die too
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:44:40 you can see through water if u look through glass
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:44:35 holy shit
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:40:44 well sucks to be the server
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:40:21 atleast if you rapidfire them
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:40:00 exa thats probably gonna traumatize the server lagwise
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:36:43 you can make custom rockets that go faster but theyre massive
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:36:37 rockets are good against ground units
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:36:25 im not sure if this thing is maneuvrable enough for an average dogfight
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:35:59 the barrels turn so they dont ovehreat
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:35:50 miniguns only fire out of one barrel
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:35:29 what i meant was a motor with guns on it
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:35:19 what i meant wasnt even really a minigun
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:35:01 they dont really do much but innacurately spray bullets
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:34:48 is it a good idea if i add two miniguns on this thing?
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:29:38 <@!264914511939502081> talk now or too skinny
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:29:30 let me get one of my friends talking here

plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:25:40 i think rick and mad should add a ''share block'' or ''team'' system so you can actually physically help people on their builds

plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:22:07 the shape looks sexy but a bit off
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:21:15 thx
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:21:14 yes its the typhoon
plane-crazy 2019-06-30 01:21:09 as i said, 2/3rd of the wings are flaps xd
