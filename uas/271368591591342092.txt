i've tried, a majority of the mech guides i've seen are just massive things that i have no idea on how to miniaturize to work with the thing im building
creations-chat 2022-03-20 00:06:17 yeah the closest i've gotten is just having the leg joints be connected with unpowered motors and thrusters on each leg to give it the illusion of walking

also tried putting friction blocks on the feet but it just doesn't work well and is pretty hard to turn with
creations-chat 2022-03-20 00:11:01 its worked pretty well but the upper body/cockpit of the mech is really bulky, i've put some helium blocks inside it and some ballast blocks in the feet, but at a point it stops being stable and makes the mech seem unnaturally light. and before you ask yes i have changed the weight on the ballast blocks to try and counteract the effect

plus the recent update that changed something with helium/ballast blocks really messed a lot of stuff up and it doesn't work as well anymore, not sure where to go from here
