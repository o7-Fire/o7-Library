plane-crazy 2020-07-29 06:17:59 <@639390338133524481> I can't "just undo it" because I HAVE ALREADY LOGGED OUT ALREADY
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 06:17:37 YESTERDAY:
1: saved diff build into the same slot accidentally and **didn't realize it**
2: logged off for the day
TODAY:
1: logged on
2: built for a while

4: panicked
5: tried undoing

plane-crazy 2020-07-29 06:13:46 and I have learned many things from that build
plane-crazy 2020-07-29 06:13:36 less savedata consumed

plane-crazy 2020-07-09 17:57:53 I didn't even make a request
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 17:57:49 why was I ranked expert
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 17:57:45 hold on
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:57:11 even harder

plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:56:28 especially if its small
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:56:23 vtol for the f-35 in this game is very difficult
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:55:45 cute
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:55:39 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:39:09 it may not be true, but thats what i find on my irl-based builds
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:38:43 if you build something from irl, its usually balanced pretty well already
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:38:17 it is
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:38:16 yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:38:15 and yeet the helium
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:38:03 ok time to add more engines
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:37:59 dang
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:35:56 ping me with a clarification lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-09 01:35:45 for the expert aeronautical engineer rank, does it mean that the plane cannot use helium to generate lift, or not use helium at all?
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 05:02:06 cogs?
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 05:02:04 like
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 05:01:54 gears?
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 05:01:25 noice
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 05:01:23 noicr
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:31:40 so they did mcas
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:31:37 because yes
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:31:34 it makes the nose go up
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:31:17 because the engine is a bit above the wing
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:30:59 it's to control too much upward pitch
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:30:47 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:29:54 it's just automated elevator really
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:29:43 no lol
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:29:08 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:27:59 imagine 737 max xd
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:27:52 but yeah I like to think of it as a 737-8
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:27:27 it's heavily modified so it's really not a 737
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:27:15 I guess
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:27:13 I tried to capture a 737 in general, so 737-8
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:26:21 1 is the longest, 2 is medium, 3 is shortest
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:25:31 I do like 1 and 3
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:25:28 but yeah
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:25:21 people seem to like 2 because it's short and don't like 1 because it's long xd
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:22:14 well, I'm making it in the style of a 737 but it won't work as a 737
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:21:50 it's a modified 737
plane-crazy 2020-07-06 03:16:35 which one? ping me with your preference here pls
