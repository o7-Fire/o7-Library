help 2020-05-20 04:48:06 what's a good way to generate lift on something rlly weird and where the CoM is in a rlly bad spot? I've tried hover thrusters and rockets engines, I just flip everywhere or don't move at all

creations-chat 2020-05-20 05:39:23 <@311088693412888576> the "sky snakes" are called shredder bugs
creations-chat 2020-05-20 05:39:45 and you can only counter with speed, small size, armor, or a shredder bug of your own

creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:05:20 oh
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:05:20 Is it your first ship
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:05:29 oh

creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:05:54 e
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:05:54 it's blocky
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:06:02 can we get a front view
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:06:29 everything above the deck is fine, I couldn't do better than that

creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:07:25 yes
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:07:54 ok not bad
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:07:57 now post that
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:08:46 bit rectangular, you could have the hull move inward consistently instead of just going inward then outward
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:09:13 however that looks more stable
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:09:16 than my fletch
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:09:22 which has smoler hull
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:10:38 if something that big is for pvp
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:10:51 then you probably either have a gamer setup
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:10:58 or it's empty
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:11:05 because that is going to lag
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:11:37 I have a 3k+ part fletcher and it's really just for looks, flexing, and for me to improve skills
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:11:46 I probably won't use it for pvp
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:11:54 because it is laggy as frick

creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:09:10 yes.

creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:27:31 yes i know what the droop snoot does
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:27:37 it provides pilot visiibility
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:27:52 yes is a snoot a cockpit?
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:28:10 if the cockpit drooped in real life, which you are saying
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:28:18 the pilots would droop down too
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:28:25 and they would mess up the landing angle
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:28:34 resulting in possible danger
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:28:48 the pilots and flight deck d o n o t m o v e
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:28:52 only the nose
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:28:57 the nose cone to be exact
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:29:00 and a second windo
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:29:06 the snoot
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:29:08 refers to
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:29:35 
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:29:40 everything highlighted in red
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:29:46 is the snout/nose/snoot
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:29:57 the cockpit does NOT NEED TO DROOP FOR PILOT VISIBILITY.
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:30:09 the problem with concorde's long nose is that it limited visibility
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:30:18 yes it has a secondary windshield nannoc
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:30:21 and i have made that
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:31:13 but anyway slayer
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:31:22 drooping the cockpit and pilots would literally mean
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:31:23 that
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:31:32 the pilots would have a diff angle from the plane
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:31:36 messing up landing angle
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:31:42 and possible accident
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:32:12 you see the problem with the concorde was that the long aerodynamic nose blocked visibility
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:32:21 so they drooped the nose so the pilots could see
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:32:24 simple
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:32:28 i know there are innacuracies
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:32:34 i.e. the wings
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:32:59 yes you said my plane had errors

creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:35:00 here is not drooped
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:35:08 when the concorde's nose isnt drooped
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:35:16 the window is literally one
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:35:26 such as this
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:35:32 
creations-chat 2020-09-12 23:36:27 when it has drooped, the window moves out of the way, but i cannot move it into the nose cone like irl because i dont have the space on this mini concorde. <@!342402058994974730>

im making this f4 with daily updates, so like
creations-chat 2020-10-20 19:32:44 update 10/20, 12:28 PM PST, micro-phantom v4.
finished elevators, experimented with lock tower placement/toggle. 
added placeholder cockpit, experimenting with wedges for cockpit instead of half wedge + smaller half wedge combo.

result: disconnectors fail to toggle lock tower properly, resorted to old TNT usage. used same concept i used on a different jet to make angled horizontals. 
fuselage is beginning to take shape, preliminary wings and control surfaces.

will begin working on control and performance soon after some more finishing touches on looks.

**It may look similar to alpha's again, but this is because im challenging myself to use lock more to make smaller jets. space limitations require similar techniques.**

creations-chat 2020-10-20 22:43:09 update 10/20 3:37 PM PST
performance finishes and working afterburners have been added. close to the final product. i've experimented with cockpits and this cockpit wedge/layout is the best possible for this size (dont attack me)

i barely remembered how to do the elevators, but just scrolled up a bit to check. a preliminary jolly roger paint job has been added, but this may or may not be kept. 

here is an image of it in build mode, since some people here don't understand the difference between copying directly and just similarities.

**since i am challenging myself to build in this small scale, things are hard to do without getting myself accused of copying. there are limitations at this size, and i did what i could with what i know. if you accuse me of copying, i really dont care, the build has the same scale so its hard for me to make it look as original as you want without ruining looks.**

tl;dr, i did what i could to make it original. there are limitations on how i can change stuff with this size, so stop attacking me and learn the difference between similarities and differences.

creations-chat 2020-11-28 03:39:31 i dont get why people care about the mere **opinions** of others, i mean you can get constructive criticism from those that do not think highly. on the other hand, if someone wants to just rate you badly for no reason, just let them be and don't make a big deal out of it. seriously, it couldn't matter less, let them be envious or stupid or whatever and laugh

ive also optimized them to be easy to camera lock every time i load, it takes me about 10-15 seconds really. not that big of a problem since most of the camera lock that is planned and is present is pretty close to each other, and im pretty speed at clicking between objects.

creations-chat 2021-02-02 04:23:14 periodt
creations-chat 2021-02-02 04:32:39 criticism sometimes *sounds* like hate, but here, where ppl have super high standards, thats almost always the case. remember that ppl giving you their opinions is always an opportunity to improve, and that hate and toxicity you seem to be getting isnt always meant as hate and toxicity - its honest feedback, and naturally, no one likes "rough honesty" as i like to call it. so the next time you're getting somewhat harsh criticism, dont complain and see what you can do to improve; instead appreciate that people are spending some time to help you improve your build.

creations-chat 2021-08-15 18:39:59 anyway make the plane less box and add intakes and shit to give it texture, don't use curved wings use delta 1x1 instead of 1x3 or 1x2 and don't put two straight up tails so close together

also tech you kind of started saying it was shit so don't blame him 🗿

creations-chat 2021-08-20 05:31:35 no quite the contrary

in fact, feedback is usually generally rude because elitism = look down on people below, but sometimes the criticized person just can't accept the fact that they have errors because theyre proud of it
