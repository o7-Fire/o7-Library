help 2021-04-22 18:33:03 how do coaxial helis rotate with no tail rotors ?
help 2021-04-22 18:34:59 cool
help 2021-04-22 19:17:50 <@!494666471943831573> heli with forward thrust ?
help 2021-04-22 19:23:12 you can simply tilt the whole rotor forward
help 2021-04-22 19:23:20 then balance it with a rear flap
help 2021-04-22 19:23:54 its not complicated
help 2021-04-22 19:24:10 you can just add a motor 2 to the bottom of your shaft
help 2021-04-22 19:24:30 then tilt the whole shaft forwards
help 2021-04-22 19:24:41 like a lever
help 2021-04-22 19:25:02 but you have to balance with a rear flap
help 2021-04-22 19:25:14 or its not very effective
help 2021-04-22 19:25:37 yeah
help 2021-04-22 19:25:45 just basically adding lift to the rear
help 2021-04-22 19:27:34 i mean thres nothing really wrong with your current heli
help 2021-04-22 19:32:34 Oh ok
help 2021-04-22 20:05:40 I see it
help 2021-04-23 11:12:08 How to rotate a heli with no tail rotor
help 2021-04-24 16:36:37 Anyone has that wheel hubcap text thing ?
help 2021-04-24 18:52:00 Use wings at the front and back
help 2021-06-09 15:05:48 Hey guys
help 2021-06-09 15:06:12 Anyone knows how to balance a single rotor heli?
help 2021-06-09 15:06:30 No engines just aerodynamics
help 2021-06-09 15:06:49 Yeah but its kinda dodgy
help 2021-06-09 15:06:57 And unstable
help 2021-06-09 15:08:59 And when changing altitudes the balance is gone since thereâ€™s variable amounts of force
help 2021-06-09 15:11:05 Its all a bit of a mess soâ€¦
help 2021-06-09 15:14:31 Helis in this game is so boring, everyone just uses rockets and end up with a jet anyways
help 2021-06-09 15:15:56 No
help 2021-06-09 15:16:22 I will make flying things that are actually good
help 2021-06-09 15:16:58 Im in the toilet so maybe later
help 2021-06-09 15:17:43 Also theres a strange glitch
help 2021-06-09 15:17:58 Idk if anyone can fix this but
help 2021-06-09 15:18:14 Im here for help to fix not to report it
help 2021-06-09 15:18:27 I am thinking of ways to use it
help 2021-06-09 15:18:43 Anyways
help 2021-06-09 15:19:21 Its most common on car suspensions
help 2021-06-09 15:19:28 So imagine a car
help 2021-06-09 15:19:51 You know what camber is ?
help 2021-06-09 15:20:49 So to have camber on a car you put a motor 2 to tilt then attach your wheels onto it
help 2021-06-09 15:21:01 On a 4 wheeled vehicle
help 2021-06-09 15:21:23 The right rear is always broken for some reason
help 2021-06-09 15:21:43 It will start to levitate and glitch out
help 2021-06-09 15:21:55 Nah Iâ€™ve tested it
help 2021-06-09 15:22:04 Im just sharing
help 2021-06-09 15:22:25 Its strange
help 2021-06-09 15:22:29 yeah youâ€™re right

help 2021-06-09 17:49:11 Why does the game always put you back into the same server
help 2021-06-09 17:49:38 I mean
help 2021-06-09 17:49:42 I server hop
help 2021-06-09 17:49:47 Then join pvp
help 2021-06-09 17:49:51 Same server
help 2021-06-09 20:54:43 Guys
help 2021-06-09 20:55:03 I will be building the best possible helicopter
help 2021-06-09 20:55:06 Any ideas ?
help 2021-06-09 20:55:41 Anything
help 2021-06-09 21:52:22 You know what?
help 2021-06-09 21:53:50 Vtol capable hovercraft
help 2021-06-09 21:54:03 Like a vtol jet but hovercraft
help 2021-06-09 21:54:19 The fan will be the helicopter bit
creations-chat 2021-06-28 20:42:22 Hello
help 2021-06-28 20:43:31 Anyone got ideas for more powerful rotors on an aircraft without breaking motor2s
help 2021-06-28 20:44:15 Im at the stage of fine tuning balance for a single rotor helicopter and need high reliability, power and stability
help 2021-07-04 19:26:56 Helis with tail rotors have a problem when moving, the tail rotor creates lift and constantly tilts the heli, anyone got ways to prevent this?
help 2021-07-04 20:27:18 I use motor 2s set to specific angle and panels
help 2021-07-04 20:27:35 Even if so then how the rotor gonna work
help 2021-07-04 20:28:35 Iâ€™ll try but I doubt itâ€™ll work well
help 2021-07-04 20:28:40 One day
help 2021-07-04 20:28:50 My single rotor heli will work
help 2021-07-04 20:29:29 Iâ€™ve got all the balance and swashplates done but overall stability at high speeds and tilts are weird
help 2021-07-04 20:30:04 You got any helis with no extra engines other than main rotors i can have a look at ?
help 2021-07-07 22:05:10 Can anyone try and motorlock 2 rotors together
help 2021-07-07 22:42:50 Stick both helicopter rotors into 1
help 2021-07-08 01:05:06 I did it
help 2021-07-08 01:05:07 Single rotor heli that actually works and doesnâ€™t flip all the time
help 2021-07-08 01:05:07 5 months
help 2021-07-08 01:06:50 With no fake engines and rotors and handles like an actual heli
help 2021-07-08 19:40:29 <@!575081005778599956>  add more wings and stabilizers to each ends of the heli and youâ€™re good, be sure to balance  both front and back so that it doesnâ€™t pitch when going up or down
help 2021-07-08 19:41:41 To move forward just make an unbalance in upwards drag like tilting the rear stabilizers to lessen the surface area compare to he front which pitches the craft forward when gaining altitude
help 2021-07-08 19:41:49 Your heli kinda smol doe
help 2021-07-08 19:41:57 Idk about that
help 2021-07-08 19:42:19 By that i meant your size
help 2021-07-08 19:42:50 Iâ€™ve been going crazy over helo mechanics in this game
help 2021-07-08 19:43:13 To a certain point itâ€™s easier
help 2021-07-08 19:43:30 Stupid autocorrect
help 2021-07-08 19:43:39 But usually larger itâ€™s easier
help 2021-07-08 19:43:44 To balance
help 2021-07-08 19:44:03 Since small obscure forces donâ€™t affect it
help 2021-07-09 14:58:41 What
the-dump 2021-07-10 00:06:20 This game would be gold if people are actually mature and respectful
the-dump 2021-07-10 00:06:20 Roblox moment
the-dump 2021-07-10 00:06:21 But no
the-dump 2021-07-10 00:06:22 Whiny ass children and shredders
the-dump 2021-07-10 00:07:23 They still beefin?
help 2021-07-10 00:09:25 Guys
help 2021-07-10 00:09:48 My heli is perfectly balanced and hovers still but thereâ€™s one problem
help 2021-07-10 00:10:40 The tail rotor pushes the heli moving it to the left as it hovers and my countering of it canâ€™t make the heli stay put
help 2021-07-10 00:11:01 So it just starts moving to the left like a crab crawling sideways
help 2021-07-10 00:11:06 How stop
help 2021-07-10 00:11:15 No engines
help 2021-07-10 00:11:40 Thanks

help 2021-07-10 00:35:28 Drifts to the left due to tail rotor pulling it
help 2021-07-10 00:35:32 How fix
help 2021-07-10 00:35:35 No engine
help 2021-07-10 23:01:14 I locked myself out of my own helicopter

the-dump 2021-07-26 08:59:57 Hello
help 2021-11-17 19:52:33 my builds are glitching out a lot because of pistons and motor 2s
help 2021-11-17 19:52:42 how to help reduce this?
help 2021-11-17 20:04:33 I just got off my computer, can you just tell me some general things to do?
help 2021-11-17 20:04:40 <@!719168864705052802>
help 2021-11-17 20:05:33 First is the motor2 not being able to hold a steady angle, I donâ€™t have much space for balancing it with weight
help 2021-11-17 20:06:07 Second is the pistons rapidly compressing and generally being inconsistent
help 2021-11-17 20:06:44 Im trying to move quite an average object which is only around 20 blocks at max
help 2021-11-17 20:07:24 I am not very familiar with motor locking yet
help 2021-11-17 20:07:27 ðŸ˜¦
help 2021-11-17 20:07:37 Anything else?
help 2021-11-17 20:07:44 Iâ€™ll keep that in mind
help 2021-11-17 20:09:07 Ok
help 2021-11-17 20:09:35 I would assume we need space for that?
help 2021-11-17 20:09:50 Im stuck for space
help 2021-11-17 20:09:55 Very tight
help 2021-11-17 20:10:35 ðŸ˜¦
help 2021-11-17 20:10:42 Guess Iâ€™ll live with it
help 2021-11-17 20:11:03 Thanks
help 2021-12-20 02:21:14 guys
