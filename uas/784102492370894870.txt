events-chat 2022-05-14 16:53:52 ik
the-dump 2022-06-16 18:05:43 website my man
creations-chat 2022-06-21 23:27:11 Yes, also underbites do more damage as they are the part that is moving, also it can look like it has severe teeth brushing skill issue, and sort of menacing
creations-chat 2022-06-21 23:53:05 i deleted the head picture, the first is above the abrams tank, also yes it is britan
events-chat 2022-07-21 19:48:38 here is my idea for an event
events-chat 2022-07-21 19:49:02 creature mech tournament
make a monster mech out of what has been chosen for you (random on a wheel)
it must be accurate size to a person or 1.5x the normal height for smaller creations
there are 3 classes, Land, Semi-Air, and Air
Land classes must use legs to walk
Semi-Air can only use flight for ramming
Air classes must be in the air at all times, and if on the ground for more then 10 seconds, are disqualified
BLOCKS THAT ARE BANNED
guns, tnt blocks, tnt balls, rockets, fireworks, suspension (if it isnt on the legs) and anchor blocks
cutters can only be used on areas where they should be( i.e, teeth, horns, spikes, horns, feet, thagamizers) Spinning cutters are not allowed (a cutter on top of a motor to increase damage) 
MATCH RULES
Matches are 5 minutes long, cannot use gravity slider for manuevering, only when you are dead (set to 1000) 
If it gets beyond the 5 minute threshold, the game will end and the judges will look at the damage to each creature, the one with the least damage wins!
Players can only use lava spitter with creatures that have fire or breath abilities, (Deviljho, Glavenus, Embermane)
Even if you do have a flying creature that wasnt listed and could use fire, it wont be allowed to use lava spitter due to it being unfair.
You cannot have more then 1 block armor except for places that can have it, basically just armored parts such as the plates of an ankylosaurus or something, idk.
You can only use lava spitter after 1 half of the match is over, and if you neck, head or vital organs (lungs, heart) are pierced, you are dead 
SKINS
If you want to customize your monster (basically if you want to make a Senator Armstrong Torgadoro) you can, you just cant have 2 block layering, 1 for skin and 1 for clothes, This is so that everyone has equal armor.
events-chat 2022-07-21 19:49:19 ideas for unimaginiative
Monster Hunter World
Land Creatures: Deviljho, Glavenus (i chose this so dont bother) Odogaron, Anjanath, Brachydios 
Semi-Air Creatures: Tigrex, Naraguca 
Air Creatures: Ratholos / Rathian
Dauntless
Land Creatures: Embermane, Skarn, Torgadoro, Agarus, Urksa 
Semi-Air Creatures: Shrike, Shrowd
Air Creatures: Malkarion
NOTE FOR DAUNTLESS MONSTERS! You can make Embermane the bloodfire embermane varient or the sporestruck embermane varient, and skarn a rockfall skarn, and you can make the listed above (Embermane, Skarn, and their varients) 1.5x the size because they are so small 
Creatures Of Sonaria (i chose this because there was no other monster games i knew of)
Land Creatures: Kendyll (it has to be half the size cuz dang he chonky)
Air Creatures: Aolenus, Vaumora (also no you cant have the breath attack)
events-chat 2022-07-21 19:49:44 Will anyone want to play this?
events-chat 2022-07-22 01:20:38 okay
events-chat 2022-07-22 01:21:04 okay i put ideas for unimaginiative
events-chat 2022-07-22 01:21:41 also you can make dinosaurs
events-chat 2022-07-22 01:22:18 but it cant be like godzilla size
events-chat 2022-07-22 01:22:38 the max is like a 4 story building, the length limit is 2 folds so then theres no snakes
events-chat 2022-07-22 01:24:11 also you can make like robot dinosaurs and stuff, still no ranged weaponery or suspension for fairness
events-chat 2022-07-22 01:26:21 also no like flocks
events-chat 2022-07-22 01:26:38 2 creautures in 1 plot or something
events-chat 2022-07-22 01:28:53 okay
events-chat 2022-07-22 01:29:14 the rules are basically to stop anyone to attack from afar and dragging the match out
events-chat 2022-07-22 01:29:30 okay revised tournament
events-chat 2022-07-22 01:30:33 make your own mechs, just dont make them have more then 6 limbs, no ranged weaponery (this includes suspension!!!) and dont make them taller then the plot, you can only fold horizontally 2 times so no godzillas
events-chat 2022-07-22 01:30:51 also no spinning cutters
events-chat 2022-07-22 01:34:34 its clear as hell man
events-chat 2022-07-22 16:46:31 okay so
events-chat 2022-07-22 16:47:11 DINOSAUR FIGHT!!!!, you can use all existing dinosaurs as long as they arent large sauropods (brachiosaurus) cuz then they get 2 op
events-chat 2022-07-22 16:48:05 bigger then brachiosaurus dinos arent allowed
events-chat 2022-07-22 16:48:24 also please size them accurately
events-chat 2022-07-22 16:50:01 also you can make some fake dinos, just dont make them too op
events-chat 2022-07-22 16:50:38 no ranged weapons, also you cant use wheels for legs
events-chat 2022-07-22 17:15:45 you can make like a dinosaur with rock armor
events-chat 2022-07-23 22:09:52 basically like idk a freaking weak ass dinosaur that can get 1 shots but doesnt because it has armor
events-chat 2022-07-23 22:10:14 its called thagamizers, horns, and clubs
events-chat 2022-07-23 22:10:54 real footage of jetstream sam and raiden in dinosaur suits
events-chat 2022-07-23 22:11:33 it would be, until you realise that legit every single BIG dinosaur are sauropod
events-chat 2022-07-23 22:11:55 that basically just sucks as EVERYONE gonna do the t-rex
events-chat 2022-07-23 22:12:37 because "its the strongest" bro others mfs such as the triceratops and maybe even a freaking stegosaurus are better because they have 4 legs and more defense
events-chat 2022-07-23 22:13:35 also the t-rex takes a big risk because main attack is head, and if you get your head chopped off, your basically dead, spino is like that except the head is worse and it has slightly bigger arms, also you cant have jurassic world dinos (you can have t-rex, just no spinos, indoraptors, or indominus rexes as they are hella op), you gotta have realistic dinos <:trollface:775024642104229898>
events-chat 2022-07-23 22:13:51 now excuse me as i look at a tier list
events-chat 2022-07-23 22:16:15 also this is just the sauropod  strat: ah yes, the sauropod strat:

Plan A: be really big, if that fails
Plan B: have allies who are just as big
events-chat 2022-07-23 22:17:52 also <@466793357318815744>  the vote is now 36-35 for dinosaur pcc event >:)
events-chat 2022-07-23 22:25:17 also you mix and match dinosaurs as long as they are in the same family ish
events-chat 2022-07-23 22:25:38 ankylosaurus and stegosaurus? fine, but t-rex and triceratops? not allowed
events-chat 2022-07-23 22:46:26 also please make the dinosaurs human sized, or atleast close, unles your making a raptor or pachycephalosaurus or something that is human sized
events-chat 2022-07-24 22:43:49 i meant like combining them together, such as a t-rex with a triceratops head
events-chat 2022-07-24 22:45:12 no. i will nerd
events-chat 2022-07-24 22:50:44 why i banned big boys, that tail will one shot if its full of cutters
events-chat 2022-07-24 23:18:18 true
events-chat 2022-07-24 23:19:26 there is speed to size ratio, if your small your fast, if your big your slow, also you can make other prehistoric animals and some robots based on prehistoric animals (same rules, just metally and cooler )
events-chat 2022-07-24 23:23:20 also even big dinosaurs have high turning speed, such as ankylosaurs and diplosaurids (sauropods with long tail) with their tails
events-chat 2022-07-24 23:30:10 Yes, stegosaurs, ankylosaurs, and sauropods are suddenly op
events-chat 2022-07-24 23:50:08 unfunny
events-chat 2022-07-24 23:55:59 no, im poor, what if we do gas station
events-chat 2022-07-24 23:58:09 is it on micrcopt stor
events-chat 2022-07-24 23:58:43 wait what the fu
events-chat 2022-07-25 16:47:32 dinosaur event
events-chat 2022-07-25 16:58:04 52 people want dinosaur event, divide that by 2 because only half will participate, thats still 26 people
events-chat 2022-07-25 17:53:29 no, its brachiosaurus since funny neck, funny nose poistion, and jurassi park
events-chat 2022-07-25 17:53:54 for spaceshit contest, can we use 0 gs?
events-chat 2022-07-25 17:54:48 smh godzillasaurus > sauroposeidon, hes cooler, evolves into godzilla, sacrificed his life for japanese soldiers against the americans, and saves the world a few times, a true megachad
events-chat 2022-07-25 18:05:11 get ratio'd by 1 reasons
events-chat 2022-07-28 22:14:12 so? its good to try out new areas

**RULES:**
no ranged weaponery, its all melee

no magnets or smoke pipes for smoke bombs (if you need smoke pipes for aesthetics thats okay) 
also no stinky tnt armor
**CREATURE DESIGN**
there is no rules, make whatever you want AS LONG as it isnt a crazy dragon with 10 block claw
theres basically gonna be a point system i guess or something idk
6 points in total
2 legs cost 2 points
wings cost 2 points
head acessory (horn) cost 1 point
tail acessory (club) cost 1 point aswell, and claws bigger then 2 blocks cost 1 point as well (if you have 2 claws, they dont cost 2 points, just 1) 
i know this part doesnt make sense, i dont know how to really write it down well, also YOU MUST PUT YOUR PILOT SEAT WHERE THE HEART OF YOUR CREATURE IS so the judges can more easily find out who won in the battle 
**BATTLE RULES**
If your head gets chopped off, neck gets grabbed by opponents mouth for more then 2 seconds, or your pilot seat falls out or is exposed, games over
You can only go forward by walking, but if you want to go fast you can put rocket engines as a boost
