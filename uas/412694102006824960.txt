creations-chat 2022-06-26 19:35:32 that's not criticism
creations-chat 2022-06-26 19:45:29 Yes, this server is so toxic because some people want your creation to be their standard of perfection and anything less is considered "trash" and then they don't even provide criticism for you to improve your build they just make fun of it with an insult because they don't want your build to be better than theirs (dave is an example of exactly what I mean.) Although I'm not against sharing your opinion about a vehicle, you shouldn't need be selfish and make fun of their creation just because you think you're better than them and that their creation doesn't appeal to your standard of "perfection".
creations-chat 2022-06-26 19:50:48 i don't really think harsh critics would be a good thing
creations-chat 2022-06-26 19:53:14 at the same time there's a limit to how far one should go, you should actually provide examples of what needs to be improved and ways that you can improve it instead of being vague and saying "this is trash"
creations-chat 2022-06-26 19:57:32 No, because "harsh critics" are literally the problem with this server. I shall not continue this further to prevent it from getting too heated
creations-chat 2022-06-26 19:59:47 "THIS IS TRASH YOU'RE BAD" is not criticism it is toxicity
creations-chat 2022-06-26 20:35:03 TLDR: Having too many harsh critics is worse for the community as a whole because they alienate new players by being overly toxic to them and their builds due to their low skill, without providing actual criticism. What this does is it creates a hostile environment that drives new players out of the community instead of providing an opportunity for them to improve.
creations-chat 2022-06-26 20:42:15 I'm literally an advocate for constructive criticism over harsh criticism as it makes the community much friendlier
creations-chat 2022-06-26 20:44:26 although i hate to continue this any further, care to explain how its wrong?
since constructive criticism takes the bad points of a build provides examples of how to improve said points (aka literally the correct form of criticism)
