the-dump 2021-03-18 13:48:15 the biggest alive leviathan class creature on below zero is called Ventgarden and its about 110M
the-dump 2021-03-18 13:48:54 biggest leviathan in subnautica is the ghost leviathan
the-dump 2021-03-18 13:49:09 and then there is this
Frozen Leviathan - ~70 meters excluding tail, around 150 meters including tail.
the-dump 2021-03-18 13:50:17 nvm its the Sea Emperor Leviathan. its about 200M in size
the-dump 2021-03-18 13:50:58 its still a leviathan class
the-dump 2021-03-18 13:51:45 there also the gargantuan leviathan. which wasnt in the base game but is getting added in mods
the-dump 2021-03-18 13:52:43 it was a scrapped idea for subnautica but artwork of it existed so modders are making a mod which adds it back in.
the-dump 2021-03-18 13:53:16 no
the-dump 2021-03-18 13:53:20 it was a image of it
the-dump 2021-03-18 13:53:30 just google it
the-dump 2021-03-18 13:53:35 and look at the size
the-dump 2021-03-18 13:53:43 also Peeper Leviathan was a thing
the-dump 2021-03-18 13:55:26 oh yeah just remembered. you know that giant skull you find near where the juvenile ghost leviathan is, that's a juvenile gargantuan leviathan skull
the-dump 2021-03-18 13:59:55 no there is an adult at craters edge in the mod
the-dump 2021-03-18 14:01:28 about 6 minutes in
