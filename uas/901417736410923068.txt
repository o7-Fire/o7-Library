(It‚Äôs actually pretty simple)

You can do this so it will be:
more rigid
No gaps where the fold would be 
Easier to build 
Also overall more aesthetically pleasing.

creations-chat 2022-04-17 21:05:47 Could I get a close up so I could more effectively assess the build
creations-chat 2022-04-17 21:10:29 If you want to be really nit picky you could use piston lock to make the wings thicker by layering wing panels
