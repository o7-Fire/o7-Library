help 2021-06-12 16:42:43 Does anyone have a substitute for motor 2's? On my gigantic heli(and i mean literally taking up the plot) the motor 2's on the wings fold fine but when i turn them with the normal motors the rockets are causing it to fly uncorrect. Also, whenever it hits terrain or another object, it bends the wing.
help 2021-08-08 05:13:33 heli flips right?
the back rotor counters the right turn of the main rotor but then it just flips to the right
