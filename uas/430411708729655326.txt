the-dump 2020-11-09 07:08:19 lol only 1m
the-dump 2020-11-09 07:08:35 i got 12bil with just a parachute
the-dump 2020-11-09 07:08:50 i don’t have recording
the-dump 2020-11-09 07:09:32 but it involves having a very fast spinning object hit my parachute
the-dump 2020-11-09 07:10:16 i like the parachute glitch
the-dump 2020-11-09 07:10:52 i also found some secret areas using a clipping glitch
the-dump 2020-11-09 07:11:14 it’s under the hill in the back left corner
the-dump 2020-11-09 07:11:27 large triangular room
the-dump 2020-11-09 07:12:14 use fast motor on big plate
the-dump 2020-11-09 07:12:26 have it 2 blocks above the ground
the-dump 2020-11-09 07:12:52 press the spin button and jump out of the chair
the-dump 2020-11-09 07:13:10 then go under spinning plate and parachute
the-dump 2020-11-09 07:13:16 normal one
the-dump 2020-11-09 07:13:38 lots of torque and speed
the-dump 2020-11-09 07:13:49 but only one motor
the-dump 2020-11-09 07:15:12 it may take a few attempts
the-dump 2020-11-09 07:15:27 i have to go to bed now
the-dump 2020-11-09 07:15:30 bye
the-dump 2020-11-09 07:16:14 i never said that but i agree
bug-reports 2020-11-09 16:19:22 i don’t know if i can get footage of this, but when i motor locked a suspension with max free length and stiffness and 0 damping it just stopped working, i could push the end of the ends of the suspension just by walking into it and it did not go back to its old position

creations-chat 2020-11-29 22:35:01 i put a low quality tank head on it and it looks terible now
Edit: i know its not a high quality build, and its not my best but it works
creations-chat 2020-12-06 17:34:52 use turning propellers or get motor 2’s set to servo that rotate a wing panel vertically to create drag
bug-reports 2020-12-29 19:47:35 i dont think this is suppost to happen
bug-reports 2020-12-29 19:55:03 there is also another bug in that vid
