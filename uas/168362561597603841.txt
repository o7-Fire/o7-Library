the-dump 2020-03-08 22:23:38 As long as you arent a turret or kamikaze, you big brain
the-dump 2020-03-08 22:24:53 Default planes should probably fall into the turret catagory as well

bug-reports 2020-03-30 16:31:03 Im not sure if this has been reported yet but its been like this for a while. Guns dont shoot or do any damage on other peoples screens. Its almost like filtering enabled, I just see a plane following me around but they see me getting shot.
bug-reports 2020-03-30 16:49:59 Yeah its been like this for a while now
bug-reports 2020-04-07 22:19:38 Did something change with the wing physics? All my planes flew perfectly level and straight and now they want to point up no matter how much weight I put in the front.
creations-chat 2020-04-10 15:58:52 Attempted to make something similar to the mech in District 9, ended up being way bigger. Also the rockets you see are attached to cameras, it has a little cage around the legs to keep it from tipping. The legs still propel it forward and walk naturally.
