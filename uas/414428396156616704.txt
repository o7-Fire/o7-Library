bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:43:11 Propellers stop functioning after rocket stages?
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:43:57 After separating, propellers become unfunctional
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:44:15 I have them to steer the rocket
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:44:23 Wym
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:44:30 Engines
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:44:45 There are functional before the separation
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:44:47 Yep
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:44:56 They stop moving and don’t work
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:45:25 Idk
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:45:32 Yep
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:45:39 Could that be the reason?
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:45:52 Nope
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:46:16 Wasd for propellers and 1 for disconnecting
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:46:48 Every trial, I find that they stop working as soon as I decend after the stage
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:46:59 Then they are permanently broken
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:47:08 Pictures wouldn’t help
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:47:35 And I’m not home rn but I’ll do so when given the chance
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:48:31 Encountered it earlier today
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:49:15 I’ll keep that in mind next time
bug-reports 2018-10-08 03:49:56 Any bit helps I guess
bug-reports 2018-10-13 01:16:40 Is it just me or are magnets very laggy
bug-reports 2018-10-13 01:17:10 I normally run the game 60 FPS but when I toggle a magnet the frames drop to 7
