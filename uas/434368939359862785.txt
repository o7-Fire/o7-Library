help 2022-02-17 17:42:39 well at first they kind of work but then it just bug out
help 2022-02-17 18:25:39 yeah that's the thing, i've added pyramide to grab well the track, i've added skirts, bigger cylinder to keep the track from going off transmission yet they clip through stuffs like its no one's business every now and then
