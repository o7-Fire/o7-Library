bug-reports 2019-02-21 23:54:12 lost this 1.5k block space craft due to lag. I also lost a 2.4k block build due to me not paying attention. A save revert system should be top priority over glitches as it can help combat glitches
creations-chat 2019-02-23 19:45:35 My third space based build. This cargo ship is designed to carry a live load aka other player builds if they fit inside. The build is currently at 1000 blocks and is no where near completion.
bug-reports 2019-02-24 19:34:14 that block settings menu in the build tool that sets the settings for all blocks you place of that type, well the slider things are broken and wont set.
bug-reports 2019-02-24 19:34:48 Also rickje said that nothing is broken, he needs to fix that cause random junk is always broken
creations-chat 2019-02-24 19:50:55 The current state of my space freighter. 1700 blocks, unable to sustain flight, but can glide decently at full thrust. Roof, nose, cargo bay, passenger lounge, and bridge all need to built.
bug-reports 2019-02-25 23:09:46 builds wont load anything more than the parts. Speed indicator is practically at infinite, and you cant control anything.
bug-reports 2019-02-25 23:53:26 why hasn't it been fixed then?
bug-reports 2019-02-26 22:45:01 the bug is obvious
bug-reports 2019-02-27 22:02:09 I spawned with anchor blocks. Last time i remember i was supposed to spawn above the water, not completely submerged destroying most of the cargo.
bug-reports 2019-02-27 22:02:43 lmao
bug-reports 2019-02-27 23:27:58 are you another one who built an oil cause i decided to build like three?
bug-reports 2019-02-28 22:06:52 so, if a rewrite happens, please redo the loading scripts and the scripts that retrieve build data to load them as that is most likely what is causing the glitch where large builds will spawn the first time, but after that absolutely nothing works on your build at speed is stuck at infinity
bug-reports 2019-02-28 22:08:37 i know for a fact its a problem with plane crazy and not roblox's fault cause how many games have pretty much the same system of loading. Examples: Lumber Tycoon 2, Retail Tycoon, Theme Park Tycoon 2, Pool Tycoon 4, Miners Haven, Space Mining Simulator, and much much more
the-dump 2019-03-01 21:36:37 so this is a discussion about in-game mods and admins?
bug-reports 2019-03-02 18:54:42 <@!495525371987492885> the bikes are not the same, he was taking inspiration from your bike to make his own. The bike designs are very different.

bug-reports 2019-04-13 18:44:30 there is a glitch where in laggy servers, you can walk and let go, but you still keep walking.
bug-reports 2019-04-13 18:45:52 it doesnt happen anywhere else since player walking is localized,  meaning that even in laggy servers for other games, you let go of movement keys and you stop moving, no matter how laggy you are
bug-reports 2019-04-13 18:46:15 it literally only happens on Plane Crazy from what i know
bug-reports 2019-04-13 18:48:41 also any build larger than 7000 blocks will not work after spawning once in a server, it will load but you wont be able to control anything at all. It was fixed before, but it only happened for builds larger than 1000 blocks

help 2019-05-18 22:43:54 https://gyazo.com/fba8f596acd0e91c29609cbabbdd14c1
help 2019-05-18 22:44:30 how do i stop this from happening
help 2019-05-18 22:44:40 what ever i do the ship flips
help 2019-05-18 22:45:22 i ahve helium blocks on top to pull the ship up
help 2019-05-18 22:45:48 including some in the hull attached to ropes to continually pull up
help 2019-05-18 22:45:55 and yes i have ballasts
help 2019-05-18 22:46:00 in the hull
help 2019-05-18 22:47:16 the ship leans to whatever side
help 2019-05-18 22:47:29 it doesnt matter
help 2019-05-18 22:47:47 especially since ships those small lean when they turn
help 2019-05-18 22:48:11 so if i have the right side balanced and then turn right i will fall to the left
help 2019-05-19 03:12:39 <@!311996873650995200> what do you mean by pontoons?
help 2019-05-19 03:13:06 i know what they are but how would i use them and make them look like they're part of the design
help 2019-05-19 04:28:16 k the balancing issue on my boat is fixed if i dont use the propellors
help 2019-05-19 04:28:49 and aim the guns
help 2019-05-19 04:28:52 and not turn
help 2019-05-19 04:29:36 other wise my destroyer does what a destroyer is not supposed to do and lean 30 degrees to the side
help 2019-05-19 04:30:21 and once my ships leans there is literally no going back
help 2019-05-19 04:30:41 it will lean to the side and it WILL NOT correct itself
help 2019-05-19 04:31:17 and physics in literally every game should be that it would correct itself and then lean to where there is more weight
help 2019-05-19 04:33:10 rickje has not token any physics classes cause sometimes the physics in the game are jsut not right
help 2019-05-19 04:33:18 or dont exist at all

creations-chat 2019-09-15 05:23:42 Royal Pitbull A-1

The model of its class. Forged for the intergalactic (silent war that some know about), the Royal Pitbull is a heavy fighter with a high speed, and good weaponry. The ship is semi-vtol, meaning it does have a stripped vtol system installed. It will get of the ground vertically but it will naturally drift forward. Same with landing. The main engines are installed with 2 lave spitters to simulate excess plasma generated by the engines. However, the particles are not fixed, and so will follow ahead of the ship at high speeds.

bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:07:46 motor 2 is refusing to rotate the wrong way
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:08:03 it picks and chooses when to rotate the right way
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:08:15 and sometimes it wont deliver enough power to even move
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:08:49 i would need to create a 10 minute video to show, and prove that this is happening on servo mode
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:10:50 the fold always will complete itself properly
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:11:15 the first 3 test i did today worked properly
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:11:36 this has happened in the past, but im just now tired of troubleshooting the issue
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:13:08 inverting the rotation does literally nothing
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:13:34 you have to manually invert the keybinds
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:15:41 also water propellers are making no noise
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:16:00 you just have to trust my word that this is happening
bug-reports 2019-10-05 19:16:24 since im not willing to go through the troubles of proving the issues with motor 2
bot-central 2019-10-12 21:07:09 oh wow

bug-reports 2019-11-03 10:18:54 i am getting so tired of this happening
bug-reports 2019-11-03 10:19:48 like every motor2 will start spasing and completely break off the ship to become its own entity that orbits around the motor base
bug-reports 2019-11-03 10:20:06 sometimes orbiting past the viewing distance
bug-reports 2019-11-03 10:20:15 or falling into the void
bug-reports 2019-11-03 12:49:22 im serious
bug-reports 2019-11-03 12:49:40 the issues with motors are not getting better
bug-reports 2019-11-03 12:50:27 i would suggest rickje transfers our saves through the main game to the test server so we can see if motors are actually fixed
bug-reports 2019-11-03 12:51:37 and that rarely happens. Like there is no way i can think of to replicate so it would still be hard to do
bug-reports 2019-11-03 16:10:38 if motor 2 is the cause then i have a good plan to trim down on motor two
bug-reports 2019-11-03 16:11:48 in other words remove the useless ones like for the catapult, one in each elevation control for my main guns, and maybe the GFCS motors will be removed
bug-reports 2019-11-03 22:53:19 and reduce damage by a freak ton
bug-reports 2019-11-03 22:53:35 they are so OP on head to head battles
bug-reports 2019-11-03 22:53:54 i know
bug-reports 2019-11-03 22:54:10 ooh
bug-reports 2019-11-03 22:54:12 salty
bug-reports 2019-11-03 22:58:58 the problem is dogfights will get harder

bug-reports 2019-11-03 23:13:05 nerf guns
bug-reports 2019-11-03 23:13:21 or do what i did in suggestion
bug-reports 2019-11-03 23:22:09 you obviously have not been in contact with the noobs of this game
bug-reports 2019-11-03 23:23:13 also we should like move this to <#384021699466756107> before we get yelled at
bug-reports 2019-11-03 23:24:41 also please fix camera mode
bug-reports 2019-11-03 23:25:27 im stuck with this and no way to fix it
bug-reports 2019-11-03 23:25:58 i tried to change the keybind since by default i had to hit 'alt' to get left shift because of my keyboard
bug-reports 2019-11-03 23:26:12 shush
bug-reports 2019-11-03 23:26:36 so not only could i use it in the first place, i could not change it
bug-reports 2019-11-03 23:31:05 and this
bug-reports 2019-11-03 23:32:27 i have just discovered another motor glitch
bug-reports 2019-11-03 23:32:39 im not even going to say it until the others are fixed

bug-reports 2019-11-06 22:48:19 and most the time it will try to go vertical and then stall out and then dive
bug-reports 2019-11-06 22:49:07 its takes like a 1000 block distance to level out after going into a nose dive

bug-reports 2019-11-27 23:03:40 watch the middle
bug-reports 2019-11-27 23:15:25 Rick, I think the motor 2 flinging when spawning is because, when you spawn, motor 2 immediately starts moving. No other part in the game does this. So try to look at spawning first to see if you can pinpoint the issue.
bug-reports 2019-11-27 23:22:44 no it is Plane CRazy all over again
bug-reports 2019-11-28 04:23:42 <@456226577798135808> that is a horrible camera angle

bug-reports 2019-12-07 17:10:53 <@456226577798135808> Up above you said that the signs used the normal chat filter. However there are two things you need to keep in mind. Roblox moderation is just trash and you can literally get banned for just playing a game, and the signs make passing the hard to penetrate filter, quite easy.
bug-reports 2019-12-07 17:11:07 And since madattak is the owner of the game
bug-reports 2019-12-07 17:11:15 he will get most the blame

bug-reports 2020-04-22 19:59:21 the conveyor block should be the same color as the darker block next to it, however i do not have a good pic showing when it still had its color, and the conveyor part was also colored now it is not
bug-reports 2020-04-22 20:00:20 this pic is older, and is the first example of this glitch occurring on the trail block
bug-reports 2020-04-22 20:00:36 
bug-reports 2020-04-22 20:01:51 there was one occurrence where a small portion of blocks would not save, and was reverted to the last save, but the rest of the ship saved
bug-reports 2020-04-22 20:02:14 i did not get a pics as i wanted to try and reproduce it again but with no success
bug-reports 2020-04-22 20:02:46 this only seems to occur switching servers
bug-reports 2020-04-22 20:13:37 i dont have a pic of the debug menu in a server that the save glitched in, but hopefully this shows something
bug-reports 2020-04-22 20:15:09 also scratch the conveyor color not having a pic with them not being glitched

bug-reports 2020-05-24 20:32:20 there are these two beams here that are not attached to anything, why they are there i have no clue, but the one on the left does not spawn in correctly

the-dump 2020-06-01 03:56:05 But seeing how crazy people are rn
the-dump 2020-06-01 03:56:09 I would not be surprised
the-dump 2020-06-01 03:58:23 People were not willing to raid a small airbase for the memes, yet people are willing to destroy cities because one person was killed
the-dump 2020-06-01 03:59:35 I am so tired of this damn country
the-dump 2020-06-01 04:01:28 If i am being honest i have no pride in my country
the-dump 2020-06-01 04:08:01 what
the-dump 2020-06-01 04:08:27 how about the entire United States of America

the-dump 2020-06-04 14:50:39 even when they can go under it

the-dump 2020-06-04 14:54:28 hydroplaning
the-dump 2020-06-04 14:55:13 you know when runways are slippery, you have to land harder to break the water seal on the runway
the-dump 2020-06-04 14:55:26 because then the runway is just a jumbo sized slip'n'slide
the-dump 2020-06-04 14:55:59 the only thing good out of it is then you can drift a plane
