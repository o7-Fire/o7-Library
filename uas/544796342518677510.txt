feedback Make the antennas longer.
creations-chat 2021-10-03 15:10:12 Longer antennas are better
creations-chat 2021-10-03 15:24:16 for me antennas are one of the factors that makes a tank look good

creations-chat 2021-12-23 01:02:43 Over detailed and it's kinda like the paladin but modified
creations-chat 2021-12-23 04:25:15 you're basically adding make up to your tank and not seeing its true looks
At least for me I don't go for much detailing
creations-chat 2022-03-16 13:02:28 Paintjob colours were from my friend it was pain ðŸ’€
