help 2021-08-25 18:59:09 guess the way i was gonna do it was the right direction i guess
help 2021-08-25 19:04:19 do that
help 2021-08-25 19:04:48 my first non tutorial plane and 3rd plane was a mini jet

help 2022-03-19 19:45:32 but the only issue was obviously moving the mouse made it move
help 2022-03-19 19:46:13 so i just have to manually angle the wings with regular motors then
