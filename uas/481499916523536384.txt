creations-chat 2019-08-25 02:21:12 As long as it has vertical takeoff and landing, it is a VTOL.

bug-reports 2019-08-25 21:24:53 When I am opening my build, it will just get stuck, but smoke pipes with still fire, but you can't toggle them, and motors will not actuate. It is like the whole build is anchored.
bug-reports 2019-08-25 21:25:23 Other people in the server I am in have complained about this as well.
bug-reports 2019-08-25 21:26:17 Ah, thanks.
