creations-chat 2022-01-24 14:39:25 I need a feedback on my robot
creations-chat 2022-01-24 14:41:26 I told you they can be hidden i know myself they ugly but I can hide them with motors its not meant to be like that it need to be adjusted with motors behind it and it will be behind the robot to make turns when it flies. I took to screenshot on mobile so I couldn't really find out the controls to adjust them
creations-chat 2022-01-24 14:44:03 If I made a video on my robot I wouldn't get low rates. Its probably the most stable robot your will ever find on plane crazy
creations-chat 2022-01-24 14:46:07 This is just without Armour I can add Armour and more details on it but it will just ruin the stability
creations-chat 2022-01-24 14:48:08 I dont like how my work i spend weeks on get roasted this much ðŸ˜” most robots you find on plane crazy doesn't even walk

creations-chat 2022-02-14 21:02:07 <@581500505759416340> very much cool, you deserve all the love from every single organisms alive and dead. You should be praised by all gods.  But that thing, it  needs to be eliminated.
