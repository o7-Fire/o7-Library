bot-central 2021-04-08 04:31:45 Oh well that‚Äôs nice
creations-chat 2021-04-08 09:11:44 You could try using some guns locked to avoid spaces or some sparklers to make a better looking barrel, since that one is a bit too t h i c c
creations-chat 2021-04-08 09:14:31 Oh also for sparklers to weld they all should have the little green arrow aiming to the left and u should use some cameras too
creations-chat 2021-04-08 09:26:23 No?
creations-chat 2021-04-08 09:28:53 First of all, I see no difference, Second, what I was saying is you should use sparklers instead of cylinders ;-;
creations-chat 2021-04-08 09:31:56 The arrow aiming to the left and cameras placed on side for weld
creations-chat 2021-04-08 09:48:32 Yeah
creations-chat 2021-04-08 09:50:48 Idk, taking in mind most people downvoted my f35 which I put a lot of effort, Probably there will be some downvotes, But you got my upvote bro

help 2021-04-08 13:16:18 oh
help 2021-04-08 13:16:33 do you use any sort of piston or camera lock?
help 2021-04-08 13:16:55 then maybe it's the motor itself
help 2021-04-08 13:17:15 sometimes when I spawn in, the motor 2 just works backwards or gets stuck without reason
help 2021-04-08 13:20:06 do you have more than 1 motor on welding directly it?
creations-chat 2021-04-08 13:21:13 lol

creations-chat 2021-06-18 04:22:00 Hm ok, not like I asked for feedback but thanks
creations-chat 2021-06-18 04:25:19 lol, I mean, he's actually right; the back one is actually motorlocked, same with red star, front one is actual motor 2. Yet, there's exposed motorlock so meh
creations-chat 2021-06-18 04:28:15 Sure, as if motor 2 could lock, surely red star has a motor 2 behind it, anyways, not my problem.
creations-chat 2021-06-18 04:30:17 AFV stands for Armoured Fighting Vehicle
creations-chat 2021-06-18 04:34:50 My man should stop adding up excuses and just accept it. Even if it wasn't an excuse, you should accept that your builds do have exposed lock, as I did with mines, is not that hard.
creations-chat 2021-06-18 04:39:50 He's got a point.
creations-chat 2021-06-18 04:45:20 I didn't really asked for feedback, nor for your opinion, (not trying to be rude either) yet you answered to what I said, so basically we can say you started the argument and instead of giving facts, you have showed the weakness of your argument (if that's how we can call it)  by adding up excuses.

Not gonna continue this argument anymore, good night everyone.
creations-chat 2021-06-25 14:00:39 yes lol, I'm glad you guys liked it
creations-chat 2021-06-25 14:02:40 wow thanks so much!, words can't express my happiness rn lol

creations-chat 2021-06-25 16:35:53 Well it's not poontons, it's actually 2 half cylinders-2 motorlocked to be on the center with half ball motorlocked on sides to make it looks softer and more near to the design.

By the way, thanks everyone a lot, I had never been so near to 100 upvotes and even less taking on mind that it was on such a short time. 
Thanks.

the-dump 2021-06-26 03:45:55 yeah
creations-chat 2021-06-26 03:49:15 How dare you to call a Mark IV a T90
creations-chat 2021-06-26 03:51:28 well yes the back looks a bit like it, but yet those guns on side are for sure from a a Mark IV male version.
creations-chat 2021-06-26 03:53:47 Wait I figured it out guys, it's a toyota corolla but it's missing the AESA Radar and the Turbofan saturn AL-41F2 Engine
creations-chat 2021-06-26 03:58:53 Yes dude, i was starting to make my theory on it being an RT-2PM2 [Topol-M] Cold-launched three stage solid propelland silo based intercontinental ballistic missile or a BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missile
the-dump 2021-06-28 13:44:33 LOL I thought it was real for a moment

creations-chat 2021-06-29 03:15:44 Really nice, but I can already hear the people mad at you because of ‚Äúexposed lock‚Äù, but overall is pretty cool.

the-dump 2021-09-20 00:36:40 wow some people is just that bad that they need to copy other's tnt settings for the 0.5 cylinder XD
the-dump 2021-09-20 00:37:05 Like, literally Boxness made a tutorial on that, why would you even do that
creations-chat 2021-09-20 00:39:44 guys what do you think of this? it's my 9th HWK 30 try, since the old one had a bit of exposed lock so i'm trying to remake it but this time way cleaner, more detailed, no exposed lock or at least way less, and with the correct angles
the-dump 2021-09-20 00:40:40 I just went into a server and some random guy came and be like s p a w n i n
the-dump 2021-09-20 00:41:08 then his friend I think, spawned a "ship?"
the-dump 2021-09-20 00:41:19 and then I spawned
the-dump 2021-09-20 00:41:31 he copied settings, wrote them down on chat and
the-dump 2021-09-20 00:41:34 left...
the-dump 2021-09-20 00:41:35 e
the-dump 2021-09-20 00:41:55 and that's why I don't go to public servers
the-dump 2021-09-20 00:42:11 : /
the-dump 2021-09-20 00:42:32 agreed
creations-chat 2021-09-20 16:59:34 Can I get some feedback on this? It‚Äôs just a comparison with an image to see how near it is, but i don‚Äôt know how to make the barrel, could someone help me?
creations-chat 2021-09-20 17:05:41 Sure (The tank is the HWK 30 √Åguila, on case you searching for images of it)
creations-chat 2021-09-20 17:07:56 Here's from another angle
creations-chat 2021-09-20 17:13:53 Well that‚Äôs going to be covered, not done yet, but by now, it has no exposed lock
creations-chat 2021-09-20 17:21:11 So, anyone can help me on barrel? I still don‚Äôt know how to make it
creations-chat 2021-09-20 17:50:40 Well this already uses that (0.5 cylinder together with disconnector and gun to make the other details), but I mean like, the front of barrel, that little hole on the last part of barrel (plus im trying to avoid exposed lock)
creations-chat 2021-09-20 18:35:59 Lol, it‚Äôs my dear friend mr skill issue, what a nice moment to see you, how have you been mr i think I do best builds in game? (Btw I‚Äôm just joking, not trying to get you mad, but if you do, then that‚Äôs your problem)
creations-chat 2021-09-20 18:59:13 Guys chill, he‚Äôs not even being disrespectful
creations-chat 2021-09-21 19:21:38 Use more wedges, make the tail a bit wider and taller, add variation of colors, try remaking nose on a less round way and make it more like a spear shaped wedge, try also coloring the glass with a different color from the body and finally try adding turrets instead of just fixed guns.
(Hope this helps to improve it)
creations-chat 2021-09-21 19:43:32 Lol they were doing that?
creations-chat 2021-09-22 02:56:14 Im not :/
(But most admit most are lol)
Well I mean, I didn‚Äôt even plan to get expert role, I was just trying to post a build and see what people think about it, then a friend told me I could get the expert rank since it got over 200 upvotes on less than 12 hours
creations-chat 2021-09-22 02:59:49 Anyways, even tho no one asked, I go sleep, good night everyone

creations-chat 2021-10-30 17:37:57 Fairly good point but, even if we assume that he‚Äôs not new, you could‚Äôve just told him or explained what he could improve rather than calling his hull bad, for example, you could tell him to use sparklers or motorlocked guns for the barrel on turrets, or to make a less blocky hull
creations-chat 2021-10-30 17:40:11 Agreed, welp I‚Äôm glad that you preferred taking rather than fighting, that‚Äôs pretty respectable

creations-chat 2022-07-23 11:52:54 You could try replacing the first 2 blocks from each side of the leg that connect the wheel with a suspension, although I'm unsure if that would work
creations-chat 2022-08-19 02:43:18 Maybe make It so theres cooldown, certain Time in game needed plus the person you trade with has to be on your friend list, both have to accept and maybe add an option so the build can be removed in case of scam or something, this would also need to make It so said build can only be saved on that slot, and not moved to another one, preventing It from being stolen, but idk, thats just a suggestion
creations-chat 2022-08-19 02:46:00 Sounds like a really safe way of trading, yeah

Not trynna be rude, just criticism
Engines could be better 
And so could canopy, maybe use cylinders?
Overall a great build tho
creations-chat 2023-03-26 16:40:33 Ok seems fair enough
Well, neat plane dude ^^
creations-chat 2023-03-26 22:56:35 Ain't no way that took you 6 months
And you still have the value to criticize a new player...
bug-reports 2023-03-26 23:52:20 It's not bad, what are you talking about?
Plus he said it's meant to PvP, not made to look cool

bug-reports 2023-03-28 03:29:56 I have skill, and I was just defending the guy
creations-chat 2023-04-09 04:16:23 No, fully elevator based
creations-chat 2023-04-09 04:18:26 That's what happens when you use WAY too many springs, as they don't get along with physics very *nicely*
Personally, I prefer tnt lock for my builds because of this "crashing" issue

creations-chat 2023-04-10 03:08:45 It's a league tank
creations-chat 2023-04-10 16:53:15 Always :>
creations-chat 2023-04-14 01:57:17 Why do people even care about ranks tho
game is meant to be played for fun, not to be part of a massive hierarchy, where even the best builders could've no rank since they don't apply for them at all
