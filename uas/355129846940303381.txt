plane-crazy 2020-01-02 21:48:23 I‚Äôm trying to make one for a Forrestal class carrier
plane-crazy 2020-01-02 21:48:07 Anyone have a good micro F-14
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 20:15:56 <@!451834969719832596> good build so far though
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 20:15:08 Plus the nose is too long as well.
plane-crazy 2020-01-01 20:14:37 <@!451834969719832596> still to small. Needs to be wider

plane-crazy 2019-12-24 20:59:26 Anyone have an American naval aircraft they want to see? I need ideas
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 01:19:57 
plane-crazy 2019-12-22 01:19:45 anyone have a good design for a weapon pylon?
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 21:24:28 Plus, it‚Äôs much more accurate than a normal missile
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 21:21:29 I‚Äôd like to use it as well
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 05:18:39 Thanks
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 05:18:36 Ok
plane-crazy 2019-12-19 05:03:52 Anyone know how to get rid of this
plane-crazy 2019-12-16 06:54:57 And I have room for 17 more on the flight deck alone
plane-crazy 2019-12-16 06:54:36 Just launched this off my new wip Carrier
plane-crazy 2019-12-16 06:52:37 And have room for 30 more
plane-crazy 2019-12-16 06:52:20 When you get a decent micro fighter to launch off a carrier
plane-crazy 2019-12-14 02:22:02 does this look good for a corsair?
plane-crazy 2019-12-10 01:19:20 Is it just me, or are there no emotes spawning in creations tab
plane-crazy 2019-12-06 05:33:11 For whomever is up for the challenge, I dare you to make an aircraft launcher and arresting wire for an aircraft carrier. The only limits are that it has to stop the aircraft from a 200 speed, and accelerate the aircraft to 200 speed.
plane-crazy 2019-12-05 00:46:55 <@!335599526414909451> have you made an arrest or hook yet? Cause I‚Äôm making a micro f-14 right now that would be cool to see on your carrier
plane-crazy 2019-12-02 06:39:28 Anyone know how to fix really wobbly small aircraft
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 00:04:24 Still don‚Äôt have a rank, even after this beast
plane-crazy 2019-11-30 00:03:30 <@!557172100545249281> been waiting for about a year now
plane-crazy 2019-11-20 02:24:58 I just ended a man‚Äôs whole career
plane-crazy 2019-11-19 01:18:03 When you have a fairly manuveable fighter that has guided missiles on it
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:48:34 Oh.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:47:12 I‚Äôm curious now since then I don‚Äôt have to ask for someone to post a suggestion
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:46:15 Or is it something else
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:46:06 Also, how long before they start looking at ranking people? Is it that you have to wait a year, or do they just binge rank on one night a year
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:44:26 True
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:43:43 
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:42:33 Have you seen The last aircraft I made
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:41:20 Which seems much more realistic
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:41:04 That or they could put it behind a 500 block limit
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:40:13 Basically, one has big enough wings for this thing. The other is just a lazer
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:39:08 For big craft, it would be like flying supersonic aircraft. Slightly less maneuverable, but still very capable
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:38:27 Basically it‚Äôs like trying to stop a speeding bullet, and then turn it around
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:37:35 Because of manuveability issues
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:36:32 Fair point
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:36:04 This is all just estimates, but it still is a good idea
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:35:41 Which would mean that tiny planes would have to increase their wing size by 10 fold to use it.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:34:56 Also, it would have to be balanced so that it would not be effective on creations less than 500 blocks big because of power.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:34:03 Which is why it would have a insane TWR of about 15 super rockets. It‚Äôs mainly so that we can stop having the insides of our builds be super engines.
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:26:30 But big craft which already have huge mass can effectively use
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:26:06 So that tiny craft can not exploit
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:25:47 Except that it would have the mass of 3 full long fuel tank
plane-crazy 2019-11-18 09:24:42 We need Really Big and Heavy engines that have a lot of thrust. Basically like a super huge engine.
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 04:09:46 also,do you guys like it so far
plane-crazy 2019-11-12 04:09:22 how to get rank for suggestions
