plane-crazy 2020-04-30 12:26:55 Can we have the guns that are for the tanks and not rockets
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:43:22 but im not even finish with the front or even started with it
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:43:08 i might just put it in the front instead
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:42:53 i wont be able to cover my rear or my front that effectively with TNT
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:42:34 but we have limited TNT ðŸ˜¦
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:39:31 Big knowledge has been gained.
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:38:41 <@!445846120187297802> where do i put the block gap?
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:34:01 so i put normal block then TNT and behind that TNT i put normal block?
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:33:34 i might try it to that tank i put in creations chat
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:33:21 NOOOOOO
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:32:58 if i change the material to metal does it affect how long it can handle bullets or rockets?
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:32:09 oh thanks
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:32:04 will it explode?
plane-crazy 2020-04-30 09:31:41 Or TNT of another player blows up near the TNT?
