The Tale of epiccomrade042 (599293318018367510)
bug-reports 2020-02-08 04:27:49 I'm having issues with motor lag, I have a 366 block bomber, and after I make my bombing run and close the bay doors the thing instantly slows down and my frames drop like crazy.
bug-reports 2020-02-08 05:14:29 I just found out the cause of my fps drop is from toggle, so toggle is broke
