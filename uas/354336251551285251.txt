creations-chat 2018-11-10 20:03:10 what allows a build to be qualified as a vtol
creations-chat 2018-11-10 20:03:11 specifically
creations-chat 2018-11-12 20:59:45 nice work
creations-chat 2018-11-29 00:02:29 <@219915838193532928> BayDren not BrayDren lol
creations-chat 2018-11-29 00:02:51 I like the build though its great
creations-chat 2018-12-13 07:10:10 hey <@104668735972843520>, i spy you're making a two legged walker. My suggestion is to add lotsa helium to the main body, so that the legs are able to actually push the walker along instead of "shuffling"
the-dump 2018-12-18 00:31:40 the vtol must be propelled by eggs
creations-chat 2018-12-18 06:21:51 question, what makes an interceptor different from your average everyday plane?
creations-chat 2018-12-18 23:01:23 <@292459675830583296> try using 1x1x0.9 blocks instead of half blocks to make it slightly more seamless
