help 2023-03-06 02:52:59 so basically
help 2023-03-06 02:53:24 theres a space where the turret and body are separated?
help 2023-03-06 02:53:44 can you take photos again but with different colors if you dont mind?

help 2023-03-06 02:54:47 use 0.9 blocks
help 2023-03-06 02:55:03 it gives you this small little gap
help 2023-03-06 02:55:12

help 2023-03-06 02:57:31 if you want some large turret to work you gotta use larger bodies
help 2023-03-06 02:58:51 you need to remove the space between the turret
