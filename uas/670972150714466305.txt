help 2022-11-12 21:05:23 You could try motorlocks?
help 2022-11-12 21:05:31 oh wait nvm
help 2022-11-12 21:05:43 U ,eam the rectangle pieces
help 2022-11-12 21:05:58 maybe add wings onto the windows?
events-chat 2022-11-12 21:16:14 Ooh there‚Äôs an event?
events-chat 2022-11-12 21:16:41 Sounds fun, I might give it ago
events-chat 2022-11-12 21:17:06 I absolutely loved watching battlebots gorwing up, well the british equivalent anyways
events-chat 2022-11-12 21:17:13 Aka robot wars
events-chat 2022-11-12 21:17:35 The best part was when the robots were absolute rebels and defeated the house robots
events-chat 2022-11-12 21:17:43 Yeah a bit
events-chat 2022-11-12 21:17:55 I mainly know of them from the Hexbug Battlebots collections
events-chat 2022-11-12 21:18:23 There was also this hydraulic claw one which absolutely decimated matilda
events-chat 2022-11-12 21:18:54 Should I try making matilda as my submission? ü§î
events-chat 2022-11-12 21:20:03 Ooh someone made carbide
events-chat 2022-11-12 21:21:28 I‚Äôm thinking of making either matilda or apollo from the robot wars series
events-chat 2022-11-12 21:26:17 Btw whats the platform we‚Äôll be fighting on
events-chat 2022-11-13 09:42:13 I just checked the date bc I was a bit panicked
events-chat 2022-11-13 09:42:15 phew
events-chat 2022-11-13 09:42:20 it's not the 28th
events-chat 2022-11-13 09:51:53 dw bro you have until the 25th
events-chat 2022-11-13 09:52:02 that's 12 days to build a battlebot
events-chat 2022-11-13 11:34:23 Yo
events-chat 2022-11-13 11:34:32 I says that springs are allowed if you're a flipper
events-chat 2022-11-13 11:34:40 what's the restrictions on the spring modifications?
events-chat 2022-11-13 11:56:40 Making a flipper bot is painful
events-chat 2022-11-13 11:59:00 How are you able to make the flipper lift other wedges?
events-chat 2022-11-13 11:59:19 Because both bots will just collide and it ends up just pushing the enemy instead of getting under it
events-chat 2022-11-13 12:00:19 wdym
events-chat 2022-11-13 12:01:44 did the tank have wedges on its sides?
events-chat 2022-11-13 12:02:47 did you get it from the side?
events-chat 2022-11-13 12:35:33 but what happens in the instance of wedge down 1x2 vs wedge down 1x2, the thinnest and least steep wedge in the game as of current?
events-chat 2022-11-13 12:37:15 In a case of a flipper vs a flipper, it's when an unstoppable object meets an immovable force
events-chat 2022-11-13 15:47:08 whats a gear system thingamabob type thing
events-chat 2022-11-13 15:55:57 Anyone know what restrictions are on springs for flippers?
events-chat 2022-11-13 15:57:11 idk bc it doesn't say
help 2022-11-13 16:26:42 Anyone know how to create hinges?
help 2022-11-13 16:27:01 A bit like on a door essentially
help 2022-11-13 17:48:56 specific settings?
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:07:27 Suspension‚Äôs allowed for flippers but only for the weapon I think
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:08:25 There‚Äôll probably be some form of flat platform build for the competition
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:08:52 Tbf I don‚Äôt think anyone except myself and someone else are building flipper bots
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:09:43 Flipper bots are extremely difficult to build but they‚Äôre probably gonna be insane in the competition
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:10:28 I just need to alter the speeds of my motors on the flipper so I don‚Äôt end up sending the bot flying
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:11:22 Btw anyone know how to build large-scale triangle wedges?
events-chat 2022-11-13 18:13:12 Im tryna build Apollo from robot wars but idk how to build the triangles on the sides of the main flipper
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:16:34 Magnets are banned
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:17:32 Wdym
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:17:41 ^^
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:17:57 Also how do you build a large scale triangle wedge?
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:18:14 They could still just push you out ig
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:18:33 That‚Äôs how wedge bots work
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:19:03 There‚Äôs not really a weapon, so to speak, but they work by pushing other bots and fitting them onto their wedge
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:19:22 What in gods name-
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:20:18 I‚Äôm gonna need a bigger flipper.
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:20:55 Also how does the 2 day contest span work
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:28:10 Bro really took ‚Äú40 cutters maximum‚Äù literally
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:28:46 My point stands
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:29:03 No
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:29:25 I mean it in when on a massive boat like that
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:29:33 40 cutters sure as hell is a lot
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:29:50 It looks like a lot anyways
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:31:26 Btw do you know how to build a large-scale triangle wedge?
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:31:41 Whats that
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:32:01 Also it looks a bit like this
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:32:10 The bottom triangle are what I‚Äôm aiming for
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:37:19 How would I create the custom angles for this bottom effect
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:37:36 It doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôd be compact enough
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:38:47 I‚Äôm a bit confused about the bottom triangles, that‚Äôs all
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:40:15 But wouldn‚Äôt there be problems with keeping compact due to the slopes?
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:41:43 Idk
events-chat 2022-11-13 19:41:52 I‚Äôm not the best with motorlocking tbh
events-chat 2022-11-13 20:42:24 no no not those bits
events-chat 2022-11-13 20:42:33 I mean the bottom triangle bits in front of that
events-chat 2022-11-13 21:01:23 how do you make the custom angles btw
events-chat 2022-11-13 21:01:35 most of the tutorials I have seen involve blocks banned in the tournament
events-chat 2022-11-13 21:22:37 How do I create a verical custom angle?
events-chat 2022-11-13 21:23:04 ?
events-chat 2022-11-13 21:23:21 whats motorfolding
events-chat 2022-11-14 18:00:38 time for another day of
events-chat 2022-11-14 18:00:52 Idiot who knows nothing about motorlock attempts to build a battlebot
events-chat 2022-11-14 18:39:47 Yknow what
events-chat 2022-11-14 18:39:48 Screw it
events-chat 2022-11-14 18:39:53 Im making my own flipper bot
events-chat 2022-11-14 18:40:10 I've given up on tryna recreate the triangle wedge bit my dumbass cant comprehend
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:12:20 I'm giving my bot a gray paint
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:12:27 White is so hard to see when building
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:12:54 <:nooo:787097964946259978>
help 2022-11-14 19:29:12 does anyone know how to make a large-scale triangle wedge?
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:42:04 Almost finished the triangle wedge slope after hours of experimenting
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:42:36 It's extremely curse but
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:42:39 Oh well
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:43:11 I'm not going through the whole struggle of building a new one
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:43:15 Let's put it that way
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:53:10 It's finally complete
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:54:29 Im probs spending way more time on this build than I need to, man I've never touched grass
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:55:13 Thanks
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:55:33 Flippers don't really have the best of protection as it is
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:56:04 Im tryna recreate apollo from the robot wars series
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:59:05 I'm so glad I finally managed to get the wedges done
events-chat 2022-11-14 19:59:12 And I'm quite content with the outcome too
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:02:19 lol
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:02:27 Now I've just gotta build the wedge.
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:02:29 again.
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:02:33 on the other side.
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:03:22 Tbf
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:03:37 The wedge I build would probs looks good on a dead metal build
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:05:28 
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:06:00 dead metal?
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:09:25 what's your bot?
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:10:38 nice
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:11:37 My goal's not really to win the competition (Which I know a flipper like mine probs won't), it's moreso to look a bit flashy and be memorable in the competition
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:13:09 HOW IS DAMN A CUSS WORD
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:13:15 üò≠
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:13:19 Anyways
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:13:22 Damn that looks good
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:14:54 sheeesh
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:15:02 idk if lights are allowed or not
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:15:07 But regardless it looks good
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:16:21 Me putting tons of effort into making a flashy looking flipper robot knowing it will probs get demolished in the first 5 minutes of the competition
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:17:03 But hey, at least I'm going out in style, right?
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:17:53 Just gotta look for the good in the bad üòé
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:19:06 Everyone in the server I'm in keeps using my flipper weapon as a ramp
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:36:52 I'm sure your bot isn't **THAT** heavy.... right?
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:38:13 at this point
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:38:22 my best strat of surviving the opponents
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:38:30 is just avoiding them like its child support
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:38:48 lol
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:39:29 If Apollo was to win this tournament
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:39:32 I'd be hella surprised
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:44:28 my bot would barely even be able to lift that
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:44:30 lol
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:47:20 this makes my moderately sized flipper build look tini
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:48:52 triangle wedge turning is so confusing fr
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:50:28 I'll just continue the build tomorrow, I'm so tired
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:50:42 444 blocks already?
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:50:50 I'm not even halfway done-
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:52:04 SHUT UP
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:52:09 STUPID DYNO BOT
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:52:17 HOW IS DAMN
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:52:21 WITH JUST A FEW MORE NS
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:52:24 A BAD WORD
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:54:24 Got damn!
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:54:36 WHAT
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:54:40 SO YOU CAN SAY FUCK
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:54:50 BUT YOU CANT ADD MORE N'S AT THE END OF DAMN
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:56:06 I can tell, lol
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:56:21 anyways Ima go sleep now
events-chat 2022-11-14 20:56:22 cya
events-chat 2022-11-15 16:59:29 Yo I have a question
events-chat 2022-11-15 16:59:46 What‚Äôs the limits on springs and suspensions for the flipper weapons?
events-chat 2022-11-15 20:01:07 <:PogU:670373666164572172>
events-chat 2022-11-15 20:01:24 epic, cheers
events-chat 2022-11-17 19:10:20 yro'ue
events-chat 2022-11-17 19:10:58 hear me out
events-chat 2022-11-17 19:11:13 I build a nuclear bomb as my entry
events-chat 2022-11-17 19:11:22 /j
events-chat 2022-11-17 19:23:04 making progress üôÇ
events-chat 2022-11-17 19:25:01 But as a serious suggestion
events-chat 2022-11-17 19:25:17 A cool idea would be separate mini tournaments for each of the bot classes
events-chat 2022-11-17 19:25:42 Like a tournament for spinners, one for hammer bots and one for flippers
events-chat 2022-11-17 19:25:50 and all others just like stated above
events-chat 2022-11-20 19:33:28 <@466793357318815744> You might have to put me down for a maybe on Saturday
events-chat 2022-11-20 19:33:40 Idk if I'll be able to get this battlebot finished in time
events-chat 2022-11-21 17:09:54 Ye but like it also coincides with school work, revision and other important things
events-chat 2022-11-21 17:10:38 And with the amount I gotta do, scheduling time to get this bot complete and ready for the tournament is physically impossible for me to do
events-chat 2022-11-21 17:15:38 My apologies, but now that I've consolidated the facts and have come to a conclusion on this, I'm gonna have to withdraw from the competition
events-chat 2022-11-21 17:16:03 As much as I would love to have been able to participate and get this done, I need to set priorities and my education first.
events-chat 2022-11-22 20:43:05 ü´°
events-chat 2022-11-22 20:43:36 Hopefully, I'll have the bot finished by the time the next battlebot competition comes around (if there is another one)
events-chat 2022-11-22 20:43:55 And I won't have these dumbass Mock exams bc I'll be in Sixth form
events-chat 2022-11-22 21:22:13 Being a top-grade student isn't easy work, midn you
events-chat 2022-11-22 21:23:03 With my current level of education, my current school is constant swooping in and ushering for me to go towards the most prestigious and top-notch universities and education opportunities
events-chat 2022-11-22 21:26:07 https://tenor.com/view/crying-emoji-dies-gif-21956120
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:34:57 I'm not sure
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:35:13 What's a GPA? I'm British lmao
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:35:56 yes
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:39:08 I've found a gpe calculator online hold on rq
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:41:46 I'll just insert my current GCSE grades
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:43:13 Tf does "credit or hours" mean
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:50:32 Nvm I did it
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:50:38 Got damn
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:50:43 3.9 apparently
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:50:52 Ye
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:50:57 
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:51:03 Notes:
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:51:26 I placed all as "1" since the "grades were around the same weight" so I assume that means they're around the same
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:51:49 BTEC sport grade is the approximate equivalent to GCSE
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:52:05 All of the GCSE scores are based on my current grades on my report
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:52:41 Harvard's not really the type of course I wanna go into rlly
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:53:01 I'm looking moreso for Games or Software Development universities, that's my interests
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:54:29 So far I've considered universities such as Wisconsin, California, MIT as well as unis in my country such as Staffordshire and Plymouth
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:54:45 All of which I believe are moreso high-end universities regardless
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:55:31 I've had my sights set out on sixth form and university since Year 9 or maybe even lower
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:55:50 Or 8th grade for american equivalents
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:56:41 I'm planning on going to my school's sixth form district where I will study A Levels in Maths, Further Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:57:00 And then I plan on getting a Bachelors in one of those sorts of areas of programming
events-chat 2022-11-23 14:57:23 Then I'm unsure for afterwards, but I'm thinking of getting some form of Masters then hopefully a Doctorate
events-chat 2022-11-23 15:00:39 It's a lot to take in, ik
events-chat 2022-11-23 15:54:51 The amount of art they give us is hella insane
events-chat 2022-11-23 15:55:06 4 pieces of art in half the amount of weeks
events-chat 2022-11-23 15:55:43 sure lmao
events-chat 2022-11-23 15:56:05 got fucking damn!
events-chat 2022-11-23 15:56:15 Thats epik
events-chat 2022-11-23 15:56:57 I don't really have any of my art on me or as photos on my computer
events-chat 2022-11-23 15:57:08 But Ik my teachers saved one of mine on insta
events-chat 2022-11-23 15:57:15 So I'll try n find it now
events-chat 2022-11-23 15:58:12 I call it, Literal pain for the eyes
events-chat 2022-11-23 15:58:17 In other words, pointilism
events-chat 2022-11-23 15:58:39 we do a lil tomfoolery
events-chat 2022-11-23 15:59:02 It's not just this piece
events-chat 2022-11-23 15:59:14 At the time of recording my grade I was a bit behind on coursework
events-chat 2022-11-23 15:59:23 Mainly because I'm overperfectionist af
events-chat 2022-11-23 15:59:51 I think I have another piece I made on my computer somewhere
events-chat 2022-11-23 16:00:00 lemme try n find it rq
events-chat 2022-11-23 16:00:12 Hence the trolling
events-chat 2022-11-23 16:00:46 Aha I found it
events-chat 2022-11-23 16:01:35 nvm wrong folder
events-chat 2022-11-23 16:01:52 I swear I had it saved somewhere
events-chat 2022-11-23 16:03:12 After looking through some cringey ass past drawings I did I finally found it
events-chat 2022-11-23 16:03:18 
events-chat 2022-11-23 16:03:26 Apologies that it's sideways
events-chat 2022-11-23 16:03:55 thanks
events-chat 2022-11-23 16:04:15 It was a piece I did last year in acrylic paints for year one of the GCSE course
events-chat 2022-11-23 16:04:36 I liked acrylic however it was a pain in the ass to blend
events-chat 2022-11-23 16:05:32 I also love pencil tone
events-chat 2022-11-23 16:05:50 I used to hate it because I'd always have a massive patch of graphite on the side of my hand afterwards
events-chat 2022-11-23 16:06:31 But then I adjusted my pencil holding techniques and then bam
events-chat 2022-11-23 16:06:35 sammeeeee
events-chat 2022-11-23 16:06:55 I've also made some digital art pieces before in Krita, wanna see?
events-chat 2022-11-23 16:07:16 Alr lemme load em rq
events-chat 2022-11-23 16:08:03 fuck.
events-chat 2022-11-23 16:08:18
