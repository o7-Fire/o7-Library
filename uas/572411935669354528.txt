creations-chat 2020-09-30 16:08:26 tbh exploits aren't necessarily all bad
creations-chat 2020-09-30 16:08:58 If it's disrupting the playerbase, yeah it's bad but something simple like shaders or whatever that doesn't pass certain boundaries are fine
creations-chat 2020-09-30 16:09:28 To who are you saying this to
creations-chat 2020-09-30 16:10:11 that's what an exploit is
creations-chat 2020-09-30 16:10:28 it's a script that you use as a third party app to do something that isn't already in the app
creations-chat 2020-09-30 16:11:26 It pretty much is an exploit
creations-chat 2020-09-30 16:11:47 Yes it does the simplest thing but it's still an exploit nonetheless
creations-chat 2020-09-30 16:12:18 No not really
creations-chat 2020-09-30 16:15:34 Well they never stated a specific type of exploit, but I guess that's just them pointing out that it goes to all third party softwares, harmless or not
creations-chat 2020-09-30 16:15:56 We just need more confirmation on this before we can actually decide what's allowed or not since it's a very broad statement
creations-chat 2020-09-30 16:16:38 If you're gonna do it just do it in secrecy if you don't want the hammer

creations-chat 2020-10-01 05:42:18 tbh self upvoting causes no harm
creations-chat 2020-10-01 05:42:46 all it does is provide meme material for people to make fun of people that want extra gratitude
creations-chat 2020-10-01 05:43:51 Reddit does that automatically..
creations-chat 2020-10-01 05:44:17 It really doesn't mean anything at all
creations-chat 2020-10-01 05:44:38 At least no one went, "We could make a religion out of this!"
creations-chat 2020-10-01 05:46:07 I just stated that you didn't, self upvote is literally just a pat on the back for achieving something
creations-chat 2020-10-01 05:46:55 Half of the time it's the same thing with pinging someone for doing it to make yourself feel good for pointing out someone
creations-chat 2020-10-01 05:47:22 Now what if someone like 224jay, HerrGuggi or vipEmpire self upvoted?
creations-chat 2020-10-01 05:48:19 So they did achieve something, making them have the authority of self upvoting because it was a good build
creations-chat 2020-10-01 05:49:22 There's no rule that says that. It's just people have been shaming people for it so it's an apparent rule made by the community
creations-chat 2020-10-01 05:49:58 It isn't. It literally even states that it wont count for entries so yes, it's not bad or harmful at all
creations-chat 2020-10-01 05:50:28 In what way
creations-chat 2020-10-01 05:50:52 Them and what good point
creations-chat 2020-10-01 05:51:30 So a reaction triggers something that apparently makes you want to shame them by pinging them?
creations-chat 2020-10-01 05:53:13 So it doesn't hurt you. You just do it because you feel like it. Therefore it isnt bad?
creations-chat 2020-10-01 05:54:06 if anything it does hurt you enough to make you post an image of yourself holding them at gunpoint and then pinging them
creations-chat 2020-10-01 05:55:12 It do be true

creations-chat 2020-10-01 06:12:07 They are rules, you can't be breaking them
creations-chat 2020-10-01 06:12:40 Its still technically spamming or flooding
creations-chat 2020-10-01 06:14:29 just ask a mod if you think it's breaking rules lol
creations-chat 2020-10-01 06:16:58 <@!409676438682206218> just ping mod ez

creations-chat 2020-10-01 06:35:41 I guess the search tool isn't reliable

creations-chat 2020-10-03 16:06:49 But what if there is a point to self upvoting
creations-chat 2020-10-03 16:08:05 honestly just do what you do but I don't think people who self upvote should care about anything cause it literally doesn't do anything but just give yourself a pat on the back
creations-chat 2020-10-03 16:08:39 like of course you would like something that you made and that you genuinely think is good
creations-chat 2020-10-03 16:08:59 but oh too bad the community shits on you like a windshield because of a reaction emoji
creations-chat 2020-10-03 16:09:51 whats so hard to not care about self upvotes

creations-chat 2020-11-09 03:10:32 If there wasnt a reason we wouldnt downvote. We downvote because it looks bad, done. Now if you want actual help dont crawl around the slime filled toxic shitfest that creations chat is. Just go to <#384021699466756107> for some general advice without Neanderthals trying to bring you down and laugh at you for having a bad build


Yes this is pretty hypocritical but its the truth
creations-chat 2020-11-09 03:13:33 Please stop complaining about downvotes holy shit. If you get bad reviews that's that. Nothing will change unless you change the quality and make it better

creations-chat 2020-11-09 13:56:14 are you actually going to non-hypocritically force him to remove a self upvote

if so this is actually bonkers
creations-chat 2020-11-09 14:05:46 Isnt it obvious he's a troll

That still doesnt take away from the fact you would actually still forcibly try to make someone remove their self upvote
creations-chat 2020-11-09 14:16:04 tigtog
creations-chat 2020-11-09 22:55:02 No he's not talking about you Diego, read his messages
creations-chat 2020-11-09 22:58:49 Well hey, at least if you learnt a few things from that I don't really care but still. Avoid posting tutorials in <#384025409945337856>
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:00:48 Man we're gonna get a 6 hour slowmode before the end of the year
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:02:22 Why not we just make the channel **actually** have 6 hour slowmode or something close to that so that people get actual feedback and not get into an argument for a simple thing
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:04:01 at the time PCC in creations chat have been pretty fuckin devastating so I can guess once we hit pass like 15k everyone's gonna be spamming no self upvotes at people just to get something out of it

You can edit your messages, not hard. Or just DM them your reply
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:06:49 Thing is would you wanna see people complaining about having 30 downvotes or have good, constructive feedback that you can use so that you don't get pushed down. Yes this may not be for every reply but it works better than seeing a constant barrage of "Unde checks" and self upvote police. Again you can reply with editing or DM the person your reply so the convo takes place between you and him
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:08:45 Mobile never existed in 2020. Yes it was **created** in 2014 but it was never available to **play** since 2014. Hence the hud looking a little wonky

"I built this on mobile"
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:10:52 Just classify it as a tutorial, no point in arguing if it's not gonna be beneficial to anything
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:23:07 god damn you learnt motor lock in 2016, nice
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:26:23 Let me explain all my points.

1. You claimed to have built that **particular** build on mobile. Though it didn't come out in 2016.
2. Motor lock didn't exist since 2018/2019. There's no way you could just learn that.
3. I haven't any evidence but you apparently made your account this year? If so that just proves you followed a tutorial
creations-chat 2020-11-09 23:28:22 What did he copy and make a tutorial about?
creations-chat 2020-11-10 02:58:13 here comes the upvote bomb for a potentially good build
creations-chat 2020-11-10 03:00:07 <@456226577798135808> do you have more angles of your F/A18

Funny meme
creations-chat 2020-11-10 03:05:05 Ok but that still doesn't retract the fact that self upvote police force people to remove self upvotes with memes that dont do anything
creations-chat 2020-11-10 03:07:42 Apparently self upvote = self suck. It's as if people don't know how to simply subtract 1 from the amount of upvotes, I don't even know why I have to explain this because it's the simplest shit
creations-chat 2020-11-10 03:09:38 Idk but it seems dumb to downvote a good build if it has a self upvote
creations-chat 2020-11-10 03:18:35 yes
self upvoters basically shift the thing their judging to whether it has a self upvote
creations-chat 2020-11-10 11:15:46 more details prob
creations-chat 2020-11-10 11:20:36 idk tbh it doesnt look that bad from that angle

creations-chat 2020-12-06 16:36:03 by transform you mean wings folding out?
creations-chat 2020-12-06 16:39:44 if im being honest just remake it

also use a 3d model and pixlr to overlap the photo over your own build at a low opacity
creations-chat 2020-12-06 16:41:52 as in?
creations-chat 2020-12-06 16:47:04 Yes but it'd take a much longer time to actually make it more accurate, I'm not trying to be mean in any way. And I'm pretty sure he can tell the flaws and everything.

If you want me to tell everything that's wrong with it, here:
Fuselage and nose are both too fat. 
Wing angle isn't that good but you probably dont know angle locking yet so thats okay. 
Canards need to be remade and make them 1x2 trailing edge and 2 1x1 leading edges.

creations-chat 2021-01-17 10:12:55 what era is it from?
alr, you could make it a heavy cruiser or battle cruiser
creations-chat 2021-01-17 10:28:16 Basically yes, bbs are tanky fuckers who murder you if you get within their gun range.
Cruisers are ships that are able to defend themselves while also being in a fleet and doing such.
Destroyers are ships that are usually always in a fleet, basically being a faster alternative to a cruiser.

also im not using tnt for pvp so fuck it
but it's convenient, disconnectors also dont completely erase themselves from existance
creations-chat 2021-02-13 17:40:02 Reason why i used them on the motorlocked folds are because 1. All angled sides are motorlock angled, forcing me to do it in the first place.
2. Folds wont stabilise correctly, so i have to completely maintain the motorlock shape from buildmode so the 3rd and 4th fold dont shake like autists.

TL;DR, I over complicate my builds making them a cesspool of mindfuckery when i could probably make more use of my space

creations-chat 2021-02-13 17:44:12 springs often clip into your build, so no. I have shit tons of disconnectors as well, as I said the TNT is just there to maintain the shape of the folds. I don't have problems with lagging anyway

creations-chat 2021-02-18 17:06:52 Barrechor, genuine advise you should take here;
- Stop asking only the downvoter, you're more likely to receive genuine feedback from people who actually care.
- Rephrase "Why did you downvote" to "Can I have some feedback on my build? I'm not forcing you."

creations-chat 2021-02-24 14:29:30 That Tie Infiltrator is not worthy of a hundred upvotes neither will it ever be in HOF. There's really no reason to brag about upvotes when the true quality of the build really isn't *perfect*. Now moving on to actual criticism:
1. The paint should be less scattered and put into the actual places. Using trails could help, though I understand if you can't achieve that as it's a pretty hard thing to do.
2. The top and bottom parts of the main part of it should be rounded and not flat. The window is already as complex as it is so I wont really nitpick that. 
3. The arms that extend onto the wings could use a little detailing. For the most part they're fine but you could definitely fit some level of detail into them.

It overall looks like a nice Tie-Interceptor that doesn't have that much problems, you have the wings rotating which I haven't seen happen is a cool touchup.
This isn't to instigate drama, it's just feedback that you should take. The first part may be a bit aggressive but take this with a grain of salt. Have a good day mate.

creations-chat 2021-04-06 01:40:55 <@!691024513827209336> Your F-16s should have a longer nose and the wings should be just a tad bit less wide, canopy could use a bit of touching up if you think it looks out of proportion
creations-chat 2021-04-06 01:53:39 Shame on me that I never specified *how* they would be compared. My intention was to say how 3d builds differentiate from 2d builds a lot so they aren't really comparable just cause they're both made in different dimensions. Also what 99er said, it requires a whole different set of skills for both of them, one needing precise colours and paint placement while the other needing relatively good accuracy and good shaping. Both types of builds have their own respective cons and pros, was never saying that one was better than the other but I guess it came out the wrong way

creations-chat 2021-04-10 03:14:46 Unironically that wouldn't be too much of a struggle, though it'd take tons of motorlock which then again isn't hard since you just need to use the space that you have to your advantage. Seeing that you have tons of that horizontally, you can just split the front into 2 sections vertically and motorlock angle them both so that they form a triangle. Putting the logo and details on that wouldn't be too hard unless you don't wanna fuck up your brain too much.
