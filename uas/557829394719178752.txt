creations-chat 2021-01-08 22:07:03 the door on my latest bus. Just motorlocked into the upper deck floor so it wont be too bulky
creations-chat 2021-01-08 22:11:01 Its still WIP so It will look better trust me. Actually I already finished most of the exterior so all I need to do is add the glass and the second staircase along with wheels
creations-chat 2021-01-08 22:13:02 probably because you made the fatal sin of single seat. otherwise I think its pretty good oh and the wings are too curved lol
creations-chat 2021-01-08 22:15:04 If its not a two seat then its not a phantom so yeah... I actually despise single seat phantoms.

creations-chat 2021-02-08 19:48:35 oh thx It would probs have looked better on a tri axle than a twin axle bus.
creations-chat 2021-02-08 19:55:31 My second single deck post is one I rode to school. I made it with curvier wheel wells. Although the wheelchair ramp motors kinda ruin it.
creations-chat 2021-02-08 20:58:58 So Im planning on making a older formula one car but I can't decide between a Lotus 68, a Lotus 72 or a Lotus 49 they just all look so good
