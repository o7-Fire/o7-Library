help 2022-09-21 13:47:11 is that if i pull up hard enough
help 2022-09-21 13:47:16 they just freze
help 2022-09-21 13:47:22 and become unresponsive after a time
help 2022-09-21 13:47:31 is that just too much friction
help 2022-09-21 13:47:40 does torque fix it
help 2022-09-21 13:47:56 theres no collisions
help 2022-09-21 13:47:59 cuz they work fine
help 2022-09-21 13:48:08 up until i try to pull hard maneuvers
help 2022-09-21 13:49:26 thats the thing
help 2022-09-21 13:49:27 i cant
help 2022-09-21 13:49:34 i need the 2 motors to be connected
help 2022-09-21 13:49:44 which allows me to do 2 axis thrust vectoring
help 2022-09-21 13:49:55 its quite literally the entire point
help 2022-09-21 13:50:18 what should i build around that
help 2022-09-21 13:50:19 like what plane

help 2022-09-21 13:58:29 or its thrust becomes too off center in VTOL mode
help 2022-09-21 13:58:37 a what
help 2022-09-21 13:59:53 i once made an F 35 cuz i built a tutorial and it looked so SHIT that i decided to make my own
