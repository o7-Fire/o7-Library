plane-crazy 2020-05-19 13:11:35 made these with trails
plane-crazy 2020-05-19 13:11:25 trying out some landing gaers
plane-crazy 2020-05-18 18:37:03 <@!426484135859585045> improvements

plane-crazy 2020-05-18 17:10:06 my attempt at recreating the thumbnail plane
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 09:04:43 helium?
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 09:04:40 mhm
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 09:03:35 it just steers heavy and won't get its nose up
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 09:02:08 not dive but it just can't get lift and steering is really hard
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 09:01:38 it has over 600 parts
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 09:01:34 no because i would only make it even heavier
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 09:00:59 but i dont want it to be floating
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 09:00:54 i think helium might help
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 08:58:25 i use super rocket
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 08:58:22 the wing design maybe breaks plane crazy physics
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 08:57:46 yes it has a lot of engines
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 08:57:09 yeah
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 08:55:50 speed and power is not the issue
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 08:55:41 I used rocket engines in the hull
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 08:52:58 it's too heavy i think
plane-crazy 2020-05-17 08:52:50 This is my p38, who could help me out with getting it up the air because the nose just won't get up
