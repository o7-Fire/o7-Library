creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:40:12 my p38
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:40:50 thanks ill do that
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:41:00 i just always like to have feedback
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:43:00 <@!426484135859585045> i think i just need to move the propellors and nose studs 1 back
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:44:52 <@!426484135859585045> And since i see you are really a pro, the p38 flies like a brick, it doesn't gain altitude fast and the nose won't get up. Any fix?
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:46:25 yeah i have that
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:46:32 thanks
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:47:00 just making it less chonky
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:47:33 i hate using a lot of helium
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:47:58 because the plane's gonna float at low speeds
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:48:04 and you wont be able to land properly
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:49:38 also gonna revamp this back section
creations-chat 2020-05-18 17:49:59 i think i made this plane in january
creations-chat 2020-05-18 18:07:55 <@!426484135859585045> do you have color scheme of the heinkel and stuka camo by any chance

help 2020-08-03 14:53:34 HEEEEEEEEELP i just made this triplane and a other biplane ww1 but the wings generate so much lifts it just makes it stall no matter how much ballast blocks i use
creations-chat 2020-08-03 15:19:44 
creations-chat 2020-08-03 15:20:03 
creations-chat 2020-08-03 15:20:11 pretty happy with how my triplane turned out
help 2020-08-03 17:06:05 my fokker keeps on climbing and it just has to much lift, i tried alot of ballast and even helium but i want to submit it so i can't do that. it flies just impossible and you can't stop it from climbing
help 2020-08-03 17:06:16 
help 2020-08-03 17:08:57 yes
help 2020-08-03 17:10:11 it did not solve the issue
help 2020-08-03 17:10:28 looks ugly af doe
help 2020-08-03 17:36:32 <@!508065143905845248> i made it longer by 2 blocks
help 2020-08-03 17:36:36 more blocks would make it ugly
help 2020-08-03 17:36:40 yet it has not been fixed
help 2020-08-03 17:39:53 i think plane crazy physics just do not allow this type of wing design
help 2020-08-03 17:39:57 it's too much
help 2020-08-03 17:40:17 i would have to stretch it 2000 miles to make it fly correctly
