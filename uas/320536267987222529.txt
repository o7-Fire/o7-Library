creations-chat 2020-12-05 13:42:34 also try this variant of props, i think its better (i mean, use control surfaces for them)
creations-chat 2020-12-05 13:48:03 it's up to you, but I think it's better this way
creations-chat 2020-12-05 13:50:29 what about the blades?
creations-chat 2020-12-17 15:28:17 needs more detail (btw, looks good) ((
I think about the gap between the turret and the hull, no need to talk))
creations-chat 2020-12-17 15:31:37 thats how ppl talk here, lmao. (well, for a "photo shoot" I would put them, —Åuz it will look way better)

creations-chat 2021-03-14 22:32:56 not the same, you cant change rpm. for me its wery important. also looks kinda realistng when u start rotating them.
creations-chat 2021-03-14 22:39:45 nah, he is just a child (dr_tankula)
creations-chat 2021-03-15 21:38:52 <:what:644996672048463942>

creations-chat 2021-03-16 13:47:42 And now it looks better.. but still, angle of screenshot is shitty..
creations-chat 2021-03-16 13:50:01 <@!545018516491993098> like this, maybe. still, not the best angle, but u see how plane looks in general**

creations-chat 2022-09-06 14:45:17 Funny way
creations-chat 2022-09-06 14:47:23 There was a guy like 2 years ago, Who posted bad plane and said "its not about how it looks, it's about perfomance in pvp" and i send a basic looking few blooks plane with a rocket with the same message. <@894395935201853440>
creations-chat 2022-09-14 17:23:04 this guy.. he is 13, makes sense ig
creations-chat 2022-09-14 17:25:08 or maybe not, cuz i have one friend, who is like 14 now, and he builds quite well.

creations-chat 2022-11-09 12:48:21 tf is this
creations-chat 2022-11-09 13:00:25 Bruh man, it just looks like some ass worm, and thats it. You asked what can you improve, but you didnt even said what is is.
creations-chat 2022-11-09 13:06:07 Litterely the thing why i've gor creations blacklist https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/637005231984607258/823328826745683998/Screenshot_202.png
creations-chat 2022-11-09 13:08:40 Btw, the thing is the guy is shoving a build, noone cares for pvp it is or not, if it looks ass, then they dont like it.
creations-chat 2022-11-09 13:11:45 Also, why dont make smt cool and beatiful for pvp, as it is wery easy if you're using smt that flyes. I dont see any point of making "pvp only ugly af builds".
creations-chat 2022-11-09 13:13:49 Like man, it feels much better when u r destroying someone on a cool looking build, rather then on some weird things.
creations-chat 2022-11-09 13:15:53 A small Jet, lol? Or a missile, idk.
