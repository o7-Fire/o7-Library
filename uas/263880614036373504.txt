the-dump 2021-06-24 05:03:44 Not really maybe is just the dutch
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:03:57 or french
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:04:35 this is fine
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:05:32 " damn thats kinda scary "
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:05:50 the no no german sign
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:06:07 it is
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:07:02 its used to replace that hindu symbol in historical games since all no no german is banned in germany
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:07:29 its used in hoi 4 to replace the symbol they normally use
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:08:22 well i just dont like germany
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:10:46 germany just isnt a country i like
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:11:18 i dont hate the people
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:12:26 i like german people just not the country
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:13:38 the list is to long for deranged man promises to fix country
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:14:28 the mustache man took sleeping pills just to sleep
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:15:53 the reason germany didnt really respond to d day really at all is because the fuher  was on vacation and they didnt want to distrub him out of fear . i think
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:16:49 there was a atempt on the fuher's  life they tried to use a bomb but it failed
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:17:37 the fuher not listening to his generals is a debate that will probably never end
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:17:50 since people never really focus on their economy
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:18:48 the fuher's death is  a mystery to this day actually  did he do it or not
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:19:18 their werid fantasy of big tanks never worked out
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:19:52 its both really
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:20:30 resources are basically their economy without gas it put pressure on them
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:20:53 the panthers had multiple design flaws
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:21:05 they could only move a certain distance
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:21:11 before being transported
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:21:26 a majority of the german milltary wasnt tanks
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:21:36 it was more of a infantry style milltary mostly
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:21:47 tanks made up very little of the german army
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:22:35 the reason why france really lost to them is a incompetent milltary
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:23:11 france had one the most advanced milltaries
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:23:14 in the world
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:23:49 their lack of competency basically
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:24:10 they thought it was gonna be like ww1
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:24:25 i know
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:24:44 ww1 tactics dont work several years later
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:25:06 only the americans had radios really
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:25:20 embed fail
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:26:26 germany before their invasion were kinda afraid of france's milltary
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:27:09 the french army at that time were really strong
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:27:54 its a shame that they didnt take advantage of this
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:28:42 the german milltary was actually in a huge traffic jam
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:28:52 this was reported by a scout
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:28:55 but nothing was done
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:29:00 they thought it was fake
the-dump 2021-06-24 05:30:29 its basically cooking oil without anything to cook

Train Wheels 
Incredibly Simple Different train Wheel Sizes there is currently only one size of train wheel in the entire game and it doesn't really help with creating miniature trains maybe 3x3 5x5 2x2 1x1 sized wheels for different sized trains they cylinders are often make it hard to make realistic trains so have different sized train wheels would help with realism .
