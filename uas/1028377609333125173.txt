bug-reports 2022-11-13 04:01:06 Im having an issue with the speakers not working. I own the gamepass, I checked the audio files to make sure they weren't taken down, I tested a second audio file, and the people I have asked on the servers are saying they are having the same issue.
bug-reports 2022-11-13 06:11:48 <@335599526414909451> Im just curious, do you know if anyone on the development team is aware of the speaker bug? I know they've got a lot of other crap to deal with, and this is relatively small; but if someone could verify this and notify the team I would be very grateful. I know everyone working on this game works very hard on it and has a lot on their plate, I just dont see this on the know bugs list atm.
bug-reports 2022-11-13 17:57:55 what???? I dont understand what you're instructing me to do.
bug-reports 2022-11-13 20:01:40 It a bug
bug-reports 2022-11-13 20:01:46 read my last chat
bug-reports 2022-11-13 20:01:52 th ID works
bug-reports 2022-11-13 20:02:02 and everyone else is having the problem
bug-reports 2022-11-13 20:02:27 you test it, I jumped on to a few different servers and it wasnt working
bug-reports 2022-11-13 20:04:51 And Im the one who uploaded the audio. I checked it myself, it hasnt been taken down. It's copyrighted, but it's not in their system and im the only one using the file, so no-one is aware. and Im only assuming both the files I was using are copyrighted because they're songs, but they're by very small creators and one of them is a meme (the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny).
bug-reports 2022-11-13 23:24:54 are you dumb????
bug-reports 2022-11-14 00:45:30 ok, fine. I said something dumbe. hes not small, but hes not huge enough for them to put his crap in their system. lst time I tried putting in something their recognized, I got a message saying it was copyrighted and I couldnt used it
bug-reports 2022-11-14 00:46:01 heres the huggin audio ID
bug-reports 2022-11-14 00:46:02 10004133094
bug-reports 2022-11-14 00:46:23 Brough up the speakers not working bug
bug-reports 2022-11-14 00:46:51 mans here says "are you dumb"
bug-reports 2022-11-14 00:47:31 and I say, no, you numbskull! I checked everything and the file works. and everyone else Ive asked are having the same huggin problem
bug-reports 2022-11-14 00:48:33 but the numbskull says I dumb because its copyright. NO! the system didnt recognize the file because the creator is small enough its not in the system. And I CHJECKED THE FILE SINCE THE ID IS ON MY ACCOUNT
bug-reports 2022-11-14 00:48:45 and I tested it with non-copyrighted crap
bug-reports 2022-11-14 00:50:01 the tl;dr is: there is a bug that stops a gamepass from working, dude says Im being small brain for saying its a bug and not me, I say its not me and heres the FLIPPING EVIDENCE
bug-reports 2022-11-14 00:52:14 even if it is my audio files, im not the only one with the problem
bug-reports 2022-11-14 00:56:37 either its plane crazy, which I can respect cause they got a lot to do, or its a roblox problem. which is less respectable since they have a huge team and their creators are underpaid
bug-reports 2022-11-14 23:32:08 why, and since when has this been a thing??? whats even the point in this??? they should be completely aware of how many, many games use audio for game passes. the insane number of people they would rip money from is absolutely mad. The absolute thousands, if not, millions of dollars they would have taken from people is crazy. It would be an insane financial loss to do that if they returned the essentially stolen money. And who would want to use default audios- they're normally crap. I have 3 games I want a refund on game passes for now- assuming this is an actual thing. Like, this would be absolutely absurd!
bug-reports 2022-11-14 23:37:59 you're right, none of my audios work in meep city, either (not like I still play that game. and whats up with all the screen shake in it???). but this is absolutely messed up.
bug-reports 2022-11-15 00:32:25 that would make sense, but its still frustrating
bug-reports 2022-11-15 00:34:00 guess that would help out content creators a ton. when I tried making a video on murder mystery (I took all my videos down- they were cringe)  it got taken down for copyright, I think there was a scene with some dude playing copyrighted music on a boom box
bug-reports 2022-11-15 02:58:09 I aint blaming rick for nothing. roblox is a piece of crap! cant pay their creators well enough, cant let the community have fun, cant moderate their vanity shop, ect, ect. I wouldn't mind, because I know its a big company with a huge project. Moderation is a huge undertaking. BUT THEY CANT PAY THEIR CREATORS???? you have to pay money to get more than **5%** of your earnings! the fee is negligible for large creators, but its _absurd_ for small creators! If they fix their system for paying their creators (they would be making far more money if they just had a constant 30%-50% earnings for all) then I wouldn't care as much!
bug-reports 2022-11-17 00:24:44 its not rick's fault
bug-reports 2022-11-17 00:24:53 its roblox being a piece of crap
bug-reports 2022-11-18 03:12:26 The issue with every time someone say that a bug is know is that NONE OF THE BUGS YOU ARE CALLING KNOW ARE ON THE CURRENT BUG TRACKER IN THIS SERVER!!
bug-reports 2022-11-18 03:12:59 like, ok, if it was know they should have updated the bug tracker.
bug-reports 2022-11-18 03:14:06 cause otherwise no one knows that its know besides the people saying its known, which makes me question if it is. Id like to know what bug tracker you all are looking at.
events-chat 2022-12-15 03:16:26 <@195253906333368320> I’m not sure if this is the right channel, but I sent a dm to you about helping with modeling for pc2. I don’t have a portfolio to show my experience, but I do have experience in blender. I’m not sure if that’s the type of modeling you are looking for, but I think I can help with that kind of thing if it is- even if it’s just for rough drafts of models. I’m about to be on winter break, so I’ll be able to help for ~2 weeks if you would like my help. I could make a few things to show what I can do if you would like me to. I can also do some Roblox studio modeling, but I’m better with blender.
