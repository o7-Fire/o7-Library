Owner:IsurusOxyrinchus
Block count:1023
Description: A Small/Medium sized destroyer equipped with two large turrets, 4 side turrets (2 turrets left, 2 turrets right), 4 side rockets (Also 2 left 2 right) and a giant missile that can be launched at the back (The missile can't be controlled sadly), 75 max speed and 7 open array antennas/radars. It is fully use able and steer-able, the radars spin when B or N is pressed and the two radars at the back can be lit up with P. The ship has "Wing lights" as radar lights over the superstructure and they can be lit up with L. The two large turrets and the side turrets are fully turnable and do work. The ship steers with two super rocket engines that can rotate underwater. If asked for more detail i can give more detail.

creations-chat 2020-01-27 21:16:40 And yes i know that it literally looks like a t45, but it's kinda the smaller sister of the t45 class now
creations-chat 2020-01-27 21:17:18 No because from what i can see the mechanism would cost most of the looks
creations-chat 2020-01-27 21:17:53 how so?
creations-chat 2020-01-27 21:18:11 would be really nice if there is actually a way it can

creations-chat 2020-01-28 23:09:07 then got me to
creations-chat 2020-01-28 23:09:25 I like missile frigates so much now that i'll make another one tomorrow

creations-chat 2020-02-15 18:53:44 Still WIP, meant to be a space frigate but not sci-fi
creations-chat 2020-02-15 18:54:03 
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:05:58 you see
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:06:00 in reality
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:06:16 a frigate in space would serve the purpose of shooting down in-orbit missiles
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:06:17 and nothing else
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:06:29 since it costs too much energy to turn in space
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:06:34 double that of getting something in orbit
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:06:43 this isn't based on scifi as i said
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:09:16 ***reality***
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:09:19 did you miss that part
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:09:39 those thrusters would spend too much energy
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:09:45 reality does suck
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:10:27 also anything other than missile hunting down frigates would be pretty much big cylinders with solar pannels and weapons
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:10:38 reality does suck
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:11:21 what also sucks is that light speed or warp speed is impossible as getting to the speed of light requires an infinite amount of energy
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:12:23 so it's going to require large ships that can take over a million people onboard with enough resources for hundreds if not thousands of years to get to another planet
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:18:36 this is why making stuff that arent literally designs is gay
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:18:52 because you can always make a more combat efficent weapon by slapping missiles onto it
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:19:01 who builds for pvp these days
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:19:06 not me
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:19:20 because if you make a cool destroyer
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:19:36 someone can slap 12 missiles and 10 guns onto the front of their ugly ship that can actually move
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:19:38 and spam them
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:22:16 we enjoy plane crazy because we build our own creations and put effort into them
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:22:22 we get happy when we see them work
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:22:24 but then
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:22:28 you come out and spam missiles
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:22:47 whats the point in making anything that isnt a turret with everything mounted on it then
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:22:57 "better"
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:23:07 i can also make a turret with 12 missiles on it you know
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:23:10 its easy
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:23:36 but then
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:23:48 if you manage to design a good looking turret with 12 missiles that is futuristic
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:23:49 go ahead
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:24:07 futuristic because no modern turret has 12 missiles that big mounted on
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:24:20 nice
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:24:24 i also made CIWs before
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:24:26 but deleted it
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:24:39 Also made a SEARAM
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:24:44 both were deleted to open space
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:24:53 you are
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:25:11 you ruin pvp by putting no effort
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:25:21 just destroying realistic builds that are meant for pvp
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:25:34 its not better if it can deal more damage
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:25:52 neither did i
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:26:07 so
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:26:14 go and build something with effort put into it
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:26:22 something that looks appealing
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:27:55 wedges
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:27:56 use them
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:28:27 can that even float
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:29:08 builds without wedges can't look as good
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:29:15 so you should experiment with wedges
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:32:42 that is
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:32:53 it has wedges behind it
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:32:54 thats why
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:32:59 <@!439783199988514817>
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:33:46 wow
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:33:56 did you get the crazy inventor + role yet
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:34:10 alex
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:34:10 no
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:34:19 he made something that looks good but doesn't use wedges
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:34:40 fold
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:34:49 no it doesnt
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:34:59 its simple
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:35:09 literally a motor and a few blocks
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:35:10 bam
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:35:23 its not bill nye magic
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:36:42 sience
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:37:31 no
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:37:44 reality is disappointing but reality is going to be there forever
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:38:16 hey atleast its space station alike and not a cylinder with 8 solar panels
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:38:56 because
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:39:04 the purpose of a space frigate would be to simply
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:39:08 shoot down in-orbit missiles
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:39:10 with missiles
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:39:13 while orbitting earth
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:39:14 yes.
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:39:21 turning costs too much energy
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:39:35 double the energy of getting into orbit
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:39:37 which si
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:39:39 is too much
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:40:31 reality is disappointing but thats how it is
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:40:42 considering we dont have any threat to mankind in outer space
creations-chat 2020-02-15 19:40:52 as they'd take years to come here from any known kepler planet

creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:21:23 orbital frigate
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:21:35 meant to shoot down in-orbit missiles by launching tiny missiles
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:21:39 nothing else
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:21:43 aka just orbit earth and do that
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:22:32 more like a probe really
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:22:39 not meant to move out of orbit when placed
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:22:45 also meant to be built in orbit
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:22:48 and not on earth
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:22:54 so considering that
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:22:57 it's futuristic
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:25:21 is it meant to ram ships
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:26:16 good in design
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:26:20 but cant understand the front
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:26:59 its called
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:27:00 wedges
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:27:03 and wedges 2
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:27:05 lmao
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:29:57 considering that the discovery is 37 meters long
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:30:03 it can actually put this into orbit
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:30:30 in 2 pieces if not 1
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:47:10 does this look better than flat solar panels
creations-chat 2020-02-15 20:49:49 those are solar panels though
creations-chat 2020-02-15 21:09:57 
creations-chat 2020-02-15 21:11:11 two more solar panels
creations-chat 2020-02-15 21:11:17 and the removal of
creations-chat 2020-02-15 21:11:25 mouse controlled wings
creations-chat 2020-02-15 21:13:13 what
creations-chat 2020-02-16 16:20:25 Orbital Defense Frigate
creations-chat 2020-02-16 16:20:43 
creations-chat 2020-02-16 16:20:57 
creations-chat 2020-02-16 16:21:21 there are quite alot of changes compared to the previous version
creations-chat 2020-02-16 16:27:02 It's not supposed to be driven around, it's supposed to be placed in orbit by a space shuttle in less than 3 pieces and then coordinate itself correctly a bit if needed, but afterwards orbit earth and shoot down in-orbit missiles with tiny missiles, that's the concept.
creations-chat 2020-02-16 16:30:13 You don't expect someone to for example drive around with a satellite do you? this is also made to orbit the earth just like a satellite because moving in space costs energy
creations-chat 2020-02-16 16:30:24 and alot of fuel
creations-chat 2020-02-16 16:30:39 the same reason why large rockets have small payloads and tons of fuel
creations-chat 2020-02-16 16:34:36 This is a design I decided to make in the game, not to use it but to showcase the design
creations-chat 2020-02-16 16:34:37 and nice
creations-chat 2020-02-16 16:58:50 it's not photoshop
creations-chat 2020-02-16 16:58:53 use the snipping tool
creations-chat 2020-02-16 17:05:49 hot
creations-chat 2020-02-16 21:49:44 It has achieved low orbit with boosters
creations-chat 2020-02-16 21:50:19 I'll have to stabilize the boosters even more and get to high orbit tomorrow

creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:05:09 oh ok
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:05:31 the hull is
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:05:34 quite outadted
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:05:36 outdated*
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:05:38 and is odd
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:06:55 above deck is not bad
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:06:58 but the hull
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:07:21 the iowa is supposed to be sleek
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:07:42 
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:07:51 yes you see
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:07:55 that hull is so high
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:08:00 for the width
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:08:08 when the iowa is all sleek
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:08:09 and long
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:08:15 the hull is just a no
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:08:21 above deck is fair
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:09:08 It's a game but there are people who give attention to accuracy and detail
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:10:43 I mean people can stabilize good looking ships
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:10:51 also that thing would be a nightmare for pvp
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:10:53 if you want to win
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:11:10 because if you want victory you either make something small and agile with as many guns as possible
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:11:11 or
creations-chat 2020-08-22 01:11:30 a big box with tons of mouse controlled missiles in it

creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:00:25 I'm asking once again
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:00:29 do I use motorlocks for VLS cells
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:00:59 hhhaha stupid woman gone
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:01:51 self upvotes are bad
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:04:03 unanchor
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:04:35 meanwhile I'm trying to figure ot the best block to make a VLS with
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:04:46 out*
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:04:52 trying motorlocks
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:07:05 motor locks and disconnectors it is
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:24:33 opinions? trying out new VLS cell holder thing designs I'm making up
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:24:44 nothing inside yet
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:24:48 because I might change the design idk
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:25:24 most shit on this ship is purely decorative
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:25:27 all weapons
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:25:32 I mean I'm remaking all of the weapons
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:25:42 because something at this scale just
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:25:44 can't be good at pvp
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:26:03 when someone can just slap 12 missiles on a small ass ship
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:26:18 target your fold points and make your entire ship collapse with 1 missile
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:26:52 folded ships are generally doomed to be mediocre in pc pvp
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:26:56 just target the folding points
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:27:00 a few shots on the motor
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:27:07 watch the entire ship collapse in seconds
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:27:45 artillery shells in pvp weapons would be nice
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:28:05 if it's outside floating in the sky
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:28:06 that's
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:28:09 something else
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:28:21 you're just asking for it to collapse if you try to pvp with that
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:28:45 imo plane crazy pvp is mediocre at best
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:28:55 the best part is designing shit to showcase and show off
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:29:08 and yes designing
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:29:13 not basing your build off a real thing
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:29:23 I don't like having to build off references
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:29:29 so I do the design process myself
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:29:55 I was never good with building off references or blueprints
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:31:23 With my frigate I just combined the best of the most modern warships and added tons of shit myself onto it, designed some shit myself and mixed it
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:31:48 for example it's a simple fact that the t45 class destroyer has the best navigation systems
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:31:56 so I slapped a modified one ontop
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:32:26 based some shit off the arleigh burke
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:32:36 newer british frigate/destroyer concepts
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:32:42 then designed something out of it
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:57:50 hi
creations-chat 2020-09-03 15:57:53 I made the new missile cells
creations-chat 2020-09-03 17:10:29 more shit on the deck

creations-chat 2020-09-03 20:04:04 on a quick note I will make the top of the hull higher
creations-chat 2020-09-03 20:04:09 to match the ship better
creations-chat 2020-09-03 20:04:15 by deleting the bottom entirely
creations-chat 2020-09-03 20:04:17 extending the top
creations-chat 2020-09-03 20:04:21 then remaking the bottom
creations-chat 2020-09-03 20:04:31 pain but it must be done
creations-chat 2020-09-03 20:05:05 <@!720751430595772418> hi can you tell me what's flawed so I can fix it

creations-chat 2020-09-03 20:19:50 downvotes are all fair if they have a proper reason behind them
creations-chat 2020-09-03 20:20:13 my reason for downvoting your rocket is that I find it a little too simple and too thick
creations-chat 2020-09-03 20:20:33 add more detailing
creations-chat 2020-09-03 20:21:01 what's toxicity is people downvoting but not being able to provide a proper reason
