creations-chat 2022-04-21 00:55:35 That fish meme is from toktik the full video meme with it singing
creations-chat 2022-06-05 21:53:30 Dave you’re a dummy
creations-chat 2022-06-28 02:56:32 That’s what they do.. they insult chunk and then get mad when he ignores or blocks them 💀
creations-chat 2022-06-28 03:10:17 “Pretty sure”
creations-chat 2022-06-28 04:57:27 1. Yellow isnt just “piss color” and if ur pee is that bright u gotta get that checked
2. Give me proof of someone giving **positive**  criticism to him and him freaking out
3. Loud? Aggressive?
4. Would you rather him be negative like people are to him?
creations-chat 2022-06-28 04:59:39 Ur contributing to the people who do making them think they’re valid
creations-chat 2022-06-28 05:02:24 Any evidence?
creations-chat 2022-06-28 05:04:27 Says he wants feedback not insults, also i said positive criticism lol

Why would he ask people who are rude to him all the time for feedback

If someone is bad at baking why listen if they say they have baking advice

**this timer is pissing me off**
creations-chat 2022-06-28 05:06:30 I don’t even play plane crazy bro I was here to troll chunk but you guys are just toxic about it. Also I posted a fish gif in the creations thing and it was worth it why would I care otherwise if I don’t post builds ☠️
creations-chat 2022-06-28 05:08:33 He elaborated and said they were rude so they don’t sound like they were the nicest with any of their past judgements
creations-chat 2022-06-28 05:10:35 Thanks for proving my point lol they could’ve said “hey maybe work on these, otherwise looks good!” And stuff like that no need for the toxicity
creations-chat 2022-06-28 05:12:42 Rbk really pulling a chad move asking the questions so I don’t have to wait two whole minutes between them 😎😎
