help 2018-10-24 00:21:41 I've got a question if anyone can help.  I made a jet, everything is symmetrical and the lift and mass line up perfectly.  However, when taxi-ing or flying, it drifts left for no reason.  Even if my mouse is center on my screen, it still drifts left.
help 2018-10-24 00:22:20 Anyone got any suggestions to fix it?
