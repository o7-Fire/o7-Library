help 2020-10-22 14:41:44 How do i make a jet turn really fast without putting jets on mouse motors, since i cant fit those anywhere that looks nice
help 2020-10-22 14:42:37 That will make it turn on a dime?
help 2020-10-22 14:42:45 Already got that iizpoke
help 2020-10-22 22:05:47 i made custom control surfaces, but instead of turning my plane, they just flip it over, how would i combat this and make them turn my plane?
help 2020-10-22 22:12:14 yes
help 2020-10-22 22:12:21 i did it on max angle servo
help 2020-10-22 22:12:32 but it doesn't turn well at all and stuff
help 2020-10-22 22:12:36 its on 45.
help 2020-10-22 22:13:33 
help 2020-10-22 22:15:06 not
help 2020-10-22 22:15:36 my elevators have max angles
help 2020-10-22 22:15:37 too
help 2020-10-22 22:16:15 they do.
help 2020-10-22 22:16:47 i think it might actually be the elevators having too high of a max angle
help 2020-10-22 22:16:50 its 30, but they're lorge
help 2020-10-22 22:17:20 alr
help 2020-10-22 22:17:55 yeah uh
help 2020-10-22 22:18:00 whenever i try to go full turn
help 2020-10-22 22:18:02 it flips over
help 2020-10-22 22:18:06 so its not good handling
help 2020-10-22 22:18:07 :/
help 2020-10-22 22:18:13 custom control surfaces bad?
help 2020-10-22 22:18:32 you can't do super sharp turns just like a normal plane
help 2020-10-22 22:18:33 :/
help 2020-10-22 22:20:22 its inside the plane now
help 2020-10-22 22:20:39 oohhhh
help 2020-10-22 22:23:44 still flips A
help 2020-10-22 22:24:31 it rolls over and then crashes
help 2020-10-22 22:24:46 making me have to carefully plan and execute turns
help 2020-10-22 22:24:53 which i thought custom panels would eliminate
help 2020-10-22 22:24:55 :/
help 2020-10-22 22:25:36 still rolls.
help 2020-10-22 22:26:21 then its too high execution skill
help 2020-10-22 22:27:13 like, why would one want to pilot a plane that conciously when you have an equally as good option that doesn't require tweaking for hours and then still having it flip over when you just want to turn and then you have to un-sideways it and shit
help 2020-10-22 22:27:14 asfigjiroeorg
help 2020-10-22 22:27:21 its on 10
help 2020-10-22 22:27:59 i just wanted my plane to have the same as the thrusters on motor 2 but like, it actually looks good
help 2020-10-22 22:28:09 but nooo
help 2020-10-22 22:28:20 it flips, unlike just putting thrusters on motors
help 2020-10-22 22:29:35 screw that
help 2020-10-22 22:29:41 i'm using thrusters on motors!!!

help 2020-10-23 02:18:20 any way to make custom control panels not suck ?
help 2020-10-23 02:18:46 if you turn, you can't turn fast
help 2020-10-23 02:18:50 at all
help 2020-10-23 02:18:54 or you roll over and crash
help 2020-10-23 02:19:01 i have found no way to stop this
