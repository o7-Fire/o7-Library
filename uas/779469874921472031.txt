creations-chat 2020-12-01 18:01:01 but its just 2 balls and a box with neon pink lights
creations-chat 2020-12-01 18:08:44 <@456226577798135808> no for real i really cant understand why its considered so good
if you were shown that image and asked what it was could you tell?
creations-chat 2020-12-01 18:10:27 idk it just doesnt seem like a starship to me but if you think so i dont really care
creations-chat 2020-12-01 18:46:19 lol then you dont have talent
your rank is just from making a build with a certain block count
creations-chat 2020-12-01 18:48:28 why do you care lol
its true
creations-chat 2020-12-01 18:51:53 but im just correcting him lol
hes saying that based on not having a discord role I have no talent
so i told him that his discord role doesnt make him better than anyone since its just for block count and not skill
