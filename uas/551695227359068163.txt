creations-chat 2021-09-06 18:11:39 fireplace beautiful
creations-chat 2022-01-08 21:55:09 I find following existing designs difficult and prefer to freestyle brings surprising results sometimes as well
creations-chat 2022-02-12 13:21:47 Woah, some of the creations that im seeing look really great and like really fun vehicles but they have crazy amounts of downvotes
creations-chat 2022-02-12 13:25:36 Thats a stretch, some of them are very clean in terms of motorlocking management. Also i noticed all the miniaturized builds get loads in terms of downvotes despite them being quite good sometimes

creations-chat 2022-02-12 17:14:51 im building a sepecat jaguar rn, and im angle locking a ton. it takes 2 minutes to even get everything in place so i can see how it fits together then i have to repeat that process after making a change. like playing unfun tetris
creations-chat 2022-02-12 17:18:49 Dont have the image rank yet so cant send a picture rn, but the reason i am angle locking a ton is because im just really trying to get the best visual outcome i dont really care if it does not fly
creations-chat 2022-02-12 18:05:14 Could be worse
creations-chat 2022-02-12 18:12:16 is it a joke if it doesnt make you laugh
creations-chat 2022-02-12 18:22:16 XD
creations-chat 2022-02-12 18:25:03 It looks great, i think the boxiness really compliments the charger aesthetic!
creations-chat 2022-02-12 18:48:40 Dont know what it is but it looks pog
creations-chat 2022-02-12 19:06:27 Not exactly an expert on the mirage family but i think it looks great!
creations-chat 2022-02-12 19:25:25 I think the foxbats upper wing style might not look so good on it, I would personally go with viggen style wings but up to you
creations-chat 2022-02-12 19:46:42 chill dude its obviously a joke
creations-chat 2022-02-12 21:32:04 i dont mean to be annoying, but for the purpose it serves i dont think that really matters

creations-chat 2022-02-12 23:43:09 Ive never downvoted a build, I just feel that it isnt really neccesary.
creations-chat 2022-02-12 23:48:59 No matter how skilled or acquainted with certain techniques some people are. Some of these people really do spend a long time making their builds and will be very happy with it afterwards, and so they decide to upload it to the plane crazy discord. I can imagine it is quite disheartening when builds that have had genuine effort put into them and still get <downvoted. Thats why i prefer to only do upvotes because no build is perfect and everyone deserves to be able to feel happy with their own builds, even with the critique of people on the internet
creations-chat 2022-02-12 23:55:01 ðŸ˜…  I think you may be overlooking the fact that this is a game, and people are here looking for fun and are staying here because they enjoy it. Every build is different and thats what i like about this discord. Nothing is ever going to be perfect, seeing slight variations in even the same type of vehicles really reflects. Heck, some of them even look great while maybe not being a perfect 1:1
creations-chat 2022-02-13 00:00:16 If i personally am not a fan of the build i will just leave it. Rather than going on a monotone like reacting scroll i prefer to look at it in a more fun way.
creations-chat 2022-02-13 00:05:00 Haha sounds about right!
creations-chat 2022-02-13 14:05:12 bruh

creations-chat 2022-02-13 15:30:40 oh no slight wing misplacement big fard moment
creations-chat 2022-02-13 15:34:29 Lazy building and being bad at the game are differnet things i spent about 13 hours making that.
creations-chat 2022-02-13 15:37:53 I would just like to state now, if you are in need of high amounts of criticisim of which you are giving builds. I am relatively certain i could take your builds apart. Becayse what i lack in wasting my life away. I regain with actual aviation knowlewdge.
creations-chat 2022-02-13 15:44:22 Because unlike you i am able to recognise other things must be done than playing this game 24/7
creations-chat 2022-02-13 15:47:53 Provide me with some images of your builds you would consider to be good <@!770764150048948224>  for criticism purposes
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:00:31 1, (Smoothening) angle unclean and horrifying to look at, 2, engines oversized, if there were any fuel in those massive wings they would be scraping the ground. 3, use of default engines because unable to construct own even at this scale. 4 Unclean transition of gradient could have done with wedges. 5, wtf what happened to aerodynamic. 6, fuselage to aerofoil transition is shite would not fly along with the wing having zero resemblence to a lift generating surface which at this scale should have been achieveable.
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:06:00 are those wheels inside of the hull?
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:09:32 The common misconception you all seem to be having is that i actually care about that build
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:14:06 Awfully spiteful argument coming from someone with that pfp
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:18:49 Your confusing standards with criticism.
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:20:55 Well in that case you would be better shutting up
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:23:08 And you are?
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:25:45 Haha, amusing total irony at every corner
the-dump 2022-02-13 16:26:23 Difference is a circus is funny
the-dump 2022-02-13 16:26:28 And I am not laughing
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:28:28 Funny how when people run out of arguments they go fleeting to the things they have left, mob mentality keeping those alive.
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:31:27 I never said my build was good at any point.
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:34:37 11 people have given it upvotes that makes me happy enough
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:38:25 The funny thing is I'm not arguing anymore. Just being bombarded with hate because I responded to criticism with a reason why it was like that. Now look at me ðŸ˜…  I guess you cant have anything good these days
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:45:55 In truth I posted that sea vixen because I was bored and was interested to see if anybody liked it, that was my first ever time using motorlocking on that scale. I recently dived into angle locking and spying on the creations channel is actually helping a lot
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:50:50 That's a nice clean edge, also question. If I want to make an angled wing that is made of blocks is able to provide lift and having defined and working control surfaces? For my jaguar
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:53:01 Its just a fuselage at the moment one sec
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:56:20 Actually yes the elevator has a gap in between the right upper stabilizer
creations-chat 2022-02-13 16:58:47 Very much a wip rn but do you have any idea on how to do the wings?
creations-chat 2022-02-13 17:01:50 mhm!

creations-chat 2022-02-13 17:09:10 I see what you mean, reckon i should try wing panels?
creations-chat 2022-02-13 17:11:53 That looks amazing, ill try both i suppose.
creations-chat 2022-02-13 17:15:22 I think it looks great!, What i would do is maybe clear out some cockpit space and try and give it a nice interior. I think that would really compliment the smooth and rounded canopy.
