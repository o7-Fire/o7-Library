creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:23:05 no i got a idea
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:24:06 add a anti ban system that can ban people that make realistic bulids by making the participents sbmit their bulids to be review by the community wheater to accept or decline fighting that in a game mode

creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:24:42 no bulidings tho
creations-chat 2020-10-03 02:25:00 just spawn that are far away from each other

creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:43:42 but DAM thats bright

creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:45:29 true
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:47:53 i mean when people say i want revamped pvp they just give up to shredder bugs because they don't want to fight em
creations-chat 2020-10-08 16:48:19 when the strong people like us use jets desighned to yeet shreder bugs into another country
