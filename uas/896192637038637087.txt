creations-chat 2022-12-17 07:08:25 Any ideas for new doors for my artillery truck? It currently uses Servo motor 2's to flip the doors up 90* and there are block 1x0.9 on the sides of the driver cockpit so the doors can flip up and down easier. I feel like the doors I have now are too big, bulky and make the cockpit look bad. Any ideas?
