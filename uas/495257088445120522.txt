plane-crazy 2019-10-25 16:47:44 the red spots are just blocks that are there to hold the engines cause they twitch cause of a glitch
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 16:47:04 side warning lights
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 16:46:58 like front flood lights bottom spotting flood light
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 16:46:46 cause i added a lot of lighting
plane-crazy 2019-10-25 16:46:39 its more of a night time build

plane-crazy 2019-09-28 18:04:01 seriously y do motor 2 never work the way they meant to
plane-crazy 2019-09-28 18:03:41 y
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 19:12:51 well at max force its more like a high power sniper rifle
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 19:12:05 i meant this is a small tank
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 19:11:55 kgood
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 19:11:21 railgun with explosive round
hidden anti air guns
and missiles
smoke screen
blinding feature
submersible
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 19:11:17 guys question is this a little overkill for a small tank
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 19:08:59 also im doing something sorta stupid
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 19:08:07 i saw a guy who made a spinner that threw bombs everywhere
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 19:07:48 id disagree
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 19:07:45 well
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 19:07:15 i walked down the strret today and a random minigun appeared
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 19:07:02 yea
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 19:06:19 shame cause im tryna use them for a hidable tank turret
plane-crazy 2019-09-14 19:05:23 guys am i the only person thats had the issue with pistons that any sort of turret built on them violently shakes?
