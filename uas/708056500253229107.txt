help 2020-10-15 04:41:31 <@!354786846049566720> is there a motor 2 you use to spin the turret?
help 2020-10-15 04:41:59 <@!354786846049566720> if there is replace it with a normal motor vice versa for the barrel elevation
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:43:16 I wish this game had rudders, no i mean real rudders that work very effectively
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:44:33 Wing panels slow the speed of a boat by alot, what about reset on a motor? (Im using edit to bypass the slow mo.)
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:46:14 what does motor one reset even do? Oh ok THAT IS SO USEFULL, darn it shouldve known that
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:47:35 motor one is less likely to lag out than motor 2 (use edit to bypass slowmo) yeah i fully agree.thats why motor 1 reset is better
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:50:06 <@!720891502108344360> thats what i meant for jets :edit: thrust is better for a rudder:edit: so what now?
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:52:20 motor 2 is better for small jets tho because you wont lag out much
creations-chat 2020-10-15 04:56:52 If only motor 2 had lock on it and didnt go ballistic on big creations
creations-chat 2020-10-15 05:00:47 Yep
