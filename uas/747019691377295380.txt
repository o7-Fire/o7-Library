creations-chat 2020-11-05 13:32:06 <@!525244805756878889> I have reuploaded with better pics
creations-chat 2021-01-07 20:57:11 unfortunately there are no 1x6 delta wings and there was simply no space to angle lock them in there
creations-chat 2021-01-07 21:52:30 <@!697893501274161325> I understand that and the wings are actually swept it may just be the angle, but i agree this was not one of my best builds
creations-chat 2021-01-07 22:00:35 I have much better builds hence expert rank etc so i might just delete this as im not very proud of it
