help 2022-06-03 16:05:28 b r o
help 2022-06-03 16:05:32 s w a s t i k a s
help 2022-06-03 16:06:25 the 229 prototypes had s w a s t i k a s instead of the iron cross
help 2022-06-03 16:06:59 ye
help 2022-06-03 16:07:48 ye, took me like 2 days which is pretty fast for a lot of my builds so it was a pleasant building experience at least
help 2022-06-03 16:08:12 thing has the flight characteristics of a brick tho
help 2022-06-03 16:09:38 i mean i have a couple exposed motors so it’s not that good
help 2022-06-03 16:11:09 my dh.9 tho is what i’m proud of tho
help 2022-06-03 16:11:19 same for this se.5 bc they’re both one block wide with angle lock and dihedral on their wings
help 2022-06-03 16:12:15 ye, working on a Ca.46 today
help 2022-06-03 16:12:26 
help 2022-06-03 16:12:41 it’s for this ww1 league i’m in, pretty fun
help 2022-06-03 16:12:45 anywho
help 2022-06-03 16:13:44 this looks fairly easy bc the 2 empennages would just be 1 bock wide and the actual fuselage has very little angle
help 2022-06-03 16:17:47 i’m not gonna lie to you and sugar coat it but it doesn’t rlly look the best, but not bad for the lack of motorlock
help 2022-06-03 16:19:05 maybe use angle lock in place of the wedges
help 2022-06-03 16:21:08 can i see it up close despawned
help 2022-06-03 16:21:19 i wanna see what u did with the motor/anglelock
help 2022-06-03 16:22:13 very nice
help 2022-06-03 16:22:38 i still haven’t figured out cameralock even after 3 years of this game
help 2022-06-03 16:24:44 why would i take offense lol

bot-central 2022-06-03 17:14:39 !rank

creations-chat 2022-06-03 17:44:23 people rlly do not like historically accurate planes wtf 💀 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/982338048891183124
creations-chat 2022-06-03 17:46:29 i’m aware, also it was just a screenshot i felt like posting of it bc i wanted to
creations-chat 2022-06-03 17:52:43 this is why i’ve left this community multiple times 💀
creations-chat 2022-06-03 17:59:18 i’m in class and just thought it would be cool to post them bc people don’t usually make hortons so there’s no version without them yet if but will just delete it at this point
creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:01:33 it literally is tho, like pls show me where else u saw this exact design bc it’s a false accusation and yk it
creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:20:23 defending myself from someone who randomly DMed me calling me a label without any concrete argument besides “it has bad history” like the iron cross does as well but it’s still accepted despite that brief moment of history where it was used by a tyrannical government
creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:23:11 that argument literally has nothing to do with what you’ve been saying 💀
creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:28:41 going by that argument, people who make accurate models of german ww2 vehicles are not-sees for making it, people who partake in reenactments dressing like them are not-sees and not just people who’re into history, actors who dress like them to play a role are not-sees and not just playing a role
help 2022-06-03 18:36:26 well what specifically do u need help on? there’s too many steps to just give one piece of advice
creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:53:06 i mean i was raised by a jewish family yet the context i posted it in isn’t praising them

it’s almost like the context matters
(no longer religious tho)
creations-chat 2022-06-03 18:56:01 wtf 💀
creations-chat 2022-06-03 23:43:42 no, i just don’t wanna color it 💀
creations-chat 2022-06-04 15:37:50 i just don't wanna paint it bc i like how it currently looks but i might considering people don't like it without one
creations-chat 2022-06-10 16:09:47 https://streamable.com/8y2dvd
creations-chat 2022-06-10 16:26:09 bc it’s true? k
creations-chat 2022-06-10 16:29:48 tryna pull the seniority card lol, i’ve been in this server multiple times before since 2019. plus i’ve been in this server for at least a few months on this account and recently just decided to post 🤦‍♂️
bot-central 2022-06-10 16:31:42 like i said, been here for at least a few months on this account 💀
creations-chat 2022-06-10 16:33:04 what part do u not understand abt having multiple accounts? plus still trying to pull out the seniority card only proves my point further.
creations-chat 2022-06-10 16:38:32 true but still, THE DATE
creations-chat 2022-06-10 16:40:46 proves my point evvveeenn further, the fact **i have had other accounts** and have been in this community for years 🦧
creations-chat 2022-06-10 16:43:24 wdym by it’s unethical? i’ve just been apart of the community for awhile and participated in it and got banned on multiple accs and rejoined
creations-chat 2022-06-10 16:45:29 they’re not alts tho lol, just my main every time i get banned, as this is my main now and if i get banned again, i’ll rejoin; meaning they’re not alts 💀
creations-chat 2022-06-10 16:48:09 gets banned for breaking discord TOS, makes another account intended as my main, so on and so forth, i used the wrong wording but corrected it now
creations-chat 2022-06-10 16:50:12 i mean u thought trying to use seniority you don’t even have was a valid argument against my video 💀
creations-chat 2022-06-10 16:52:21 reporting me for making another acc i used as my main when that’s intended for people who get banned from a server and make alts to avoid the ban 💀
creations-chat 2022-06-10 16:54:28 🤓
creations-chat 2022-06-10 16:58:40 mk ima have to word this very bluntly for you, no where in the rules does it say u can’t REJOIN plane crazy community, not making multiple accounts AT ONCE to join the same server. i wasn’t evading a ban from the server bc i was never banned on this server, thus i’m not evading a ban for this server
creations-chat 2022-06-10 17:03:41 it’s not an alt tho
creations-chat 2022-06-10 17:30:54 yeah
creations-chat 2022-06-10 17:35:44 me when rbk hasn’t banned me for having an account from 2 years ago (sorry 🥺)
creations-chat 2022-06-10 17:55:04 throw it at the sped kids and run
creations-chat 2022-06-10 18:00:43 you can trust us <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-06-10 18:16:04 rip 💀
creations-chat 2022-06-10 18:18:10 sorry for having an account 2 years ago 🥺 (i’m sorry 😖) uh oh
creations-chat 2022-06-10 18:20:14 shouldn’t have made that account and joined in 2019
creations-chat 2022-06-10 18:23:01 i made an account in 2019, joined plane crazy community, it got banned off of discord (not a server ban) so i made this one recently to rejoin the community and i ruffled people’s feathers. i made this one as a main not intended as an alt
creations-chat 2022-06-10 18:25:43 yeah, i made this account months ago, my previous one was in PCC for a couple years <:FineTroll:626841259746656289>
creations-chat 2022-06-10 18:27:45 couldn’t log into it anymore so i came to the conclusion that it was either banned or my acc was disabled never got a reason as to why tho so i’m not entirely sure
creations-chat 2022-06-10 18:38:05 same as this account
creations-chat 2022-06-10 18:40:24 what’s the verdict papa doofenshirts
creations-chat 2022-06-10 18:44:52 i corrected myself, and this is my only one here rn 😎 (idk why it warned me)
creations-chat 2022-06-10 18:47:31 it didn’t give me a reason, either i was banned or my account was deactivated
creations-chat 2022-06-10 18:50:55 they thought i have alts on here (don’t listen to him rago, he’s not a patriot)
creations-chat 2022-06-10 18:53:25 send me a pic of our biplanes flying i formation or in rally’s airfield so i can get designer role so rbk can become white role
creations-chat 2022-06-10 18:55:45 why’re u DMing him 💀
creations-chat 2022-06-10 18:58:23 u coulda just told him here, like u just responded to me rn ☠️ plus i don’t think he cares enough abt discord drama for you to warn him not to believe my ‘lies’ ☠️☠️☠️
