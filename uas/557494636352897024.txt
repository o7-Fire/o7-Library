creations-chat 2021-05-29 02:32:15 How can I improve this since it got 20 downvotes
creations-chat 2021-05-29 03:40:52 Oh haha very funny funnyman
creations-chat 2021-05-29 03:43:05 It's deathroll from battlebots and it's not a saw blade or amugs
creations-chat 2021-05-29 03:51:25 "Nobody likes battlebots"
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:53:53 Yo are these guys talking about life in the meme channel
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:54:49 Why do we need work though
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:55:01 We can enjoy life even if we are worthless
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:55:29 I wouldn't say miserable
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:55:45 And I'm ok with that
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:56:06 There's nothing we can do about time so why worry
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:56:51 We can't do that though
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:57:27 Well then that's just what the afterlife is
the-dump 2021-05-29 10:59:44 I just wanna remind yall we are discussing God our existence the afterlife and religion in the funny meme channel
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:00:22 It doesn't matter if we are wrong if we don't know
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:00:37 There's nothing we could have done to be right since we didn't know
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:01:51 Funny meme channel is for the discussion about God right now
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:02:26 I have a existential crisis every once in a while when I think about death so its ok
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:04:18 Ultimately we can say there is no point in life but if we just lay down and die we are wasting the non existant point we had
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:05:31 Btw as a new discussion how unethical is too much?
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:05:49 At what point is it no longer science and just torture?
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:06:46 We can say that the monkey head transplant was very unethical but it helped further the science of transplants
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:07:43 We are animals but we are different
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:08:16 Btw nice pfp
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:08:56 Not everything in life has to have meaning or a point
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:09:15 Playing games doesn't really have a point but we still enjoy them
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:09:58 We have technology
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:10:48 With the freedom of being able to do what we want we inevitably encounter the issue of other people
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:11:18 Same
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:11:40 Hey you didn't have to do my bro like that
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:12:08 I mean true but still he didn't hurt anyone
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:12:31 He just came to give his Christian homes a fistbump
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:13:00 Reality is what you make of it
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:13:16 If you want it to be messed up it's messed up
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:13:24 If you want it to be happy it's happy
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:13:52 We can't say "reality is" as a statement without contradicting ourselves
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:14:14 Reality isn't a solid thing since it changes like the flow of water
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:14:29 Thus we cannot make a hard statement on what it is or isn't
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:15:02 We cant
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:15:12 But that doesn't meant we can't enjoy it
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:15:52 But xan you really just point at something like the laws of physics and go "that's reality"
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:16:20 Sure we can say what we are expirencing right now is reality but is it really?
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:16:39 We're in a taco
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:17:44 The most correct answer we can give as to what reality is would be "we don't know"
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:19:58 Realistically we probably aren't alone in the universe
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:20:11 Theres just so much space
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:20:41 The alien life is probably just micro organisms but it's something
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:21:52 Have you seen the new adventure time episode?
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:22:11 I thought it was a very interesting outlook on the afterlife
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:22:31 I have a link to the episode if you want to watch it
the-dump 2021-05-29 11:22:46 I'll dm you
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:31:54 That's not how it works lol
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:32:10 Saws have 0 bite and grind unlike disks
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:32:57 We do weekly tournaments for it lol
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:33:42 Dude you judge by rank your opinion is invalid
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:34:15 Apologies for not spending 300 hours for a rank that just changes your names color
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:35:37 Bars get more bite and get side swiped better while disks hit harder but can get side swiped
events-chat 2022-05-04 16:35:54 They do damage yes but that's not the only factor
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:37:25 They're lifters iirc they are powered
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:37:50 https://youtu.be/KF1msyHmIBc
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:38:44 0:18 they are powered
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:41:04 From the wiki "For Discovery Season 5 of BattleBots, MadCatter returned a considerably more potent machine. The team largely ditched the ineffective hammer, though it was seen one time against Malice, and opted for modular spinning weaponry. Each weapon required a lithium polymer battery with different specifications to cope with its demands, though MadCatter's main configuration for featured a thick vertical disc spinner and single lifting arm. MadCatter"
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:41:26 Because sawblaze broke it you can literally see it breaking the lifter
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:43:36 
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:44:29 It's season 5
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:48:20 You can literally see the chain powering the forks
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:49:33 Wdym don't exist
events-chat 2022-05-15 18:49:50 They used both those config
events-chat 2022-05-16 19:43:17 We complain about how it's not accurate lol
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:03:57 From what I've heard he's rematched everyone except you and still won so
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:07:26 Wdym ignored them
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:07:56 Accidentally
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:08:57 How
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:09:59 Not really considering he got the same results after turning it down
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:11:16 So why not do the rematch
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:13:18 I can try and see if he wants to rematch
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:15:26 They do
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:16:10 Aight
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:18:20 He has made messages like months ago in different servers
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:22:04 You kinda are going for realism in some ways though making bots be based off actual battlebots and stuff
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:23:46 I wasn't complaining I was just pointing out how you are going for realism in some ways
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:27:48 In my eyes the whole only real bots and talking about no big small bots irl is kinda going for realism
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:29:32 
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:31:26 It didn't weigh half the bot though only the top spun
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:32:01 Either way in my opinion I don't think full body spinners should really get a bonus that large
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:39:30 You probably should have clarified it was allowed but I don't think grav should really be allowed
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:41:10 ^
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:41:53 A vertical Spinner is meant to hit the other bot upwards but with high grav you basically can't do that but If it was extra ballast you could still do that
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:42:21 Agreed
events-chat 2022-05-16 20:44:16 These guys could probably help with the rules for the future if you want help
