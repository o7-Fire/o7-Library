creations-chat 2020-11-28 23:35:21 <@!414359638302130176> An easy way to instantly fix it is to maybe motorlock the cockpit and turn it smooth and** MAKE IT GLASS NOW** It looks** BAD** without glass
creations-chat 2020-11-28 23:36:52 Its way to rough, make it smoother since it really looks jacked up the camo also doesn't fit.

creations-chat 2020-11-28 23:57:04 <@!658140951273013248> The camoflauge isnt good, also you should make it smoother and try to hide rough edges. Overall its still good.

creations-chat 2020-12-26 20:53:49 <@!484884183018373120> stop image spam pls
creations-chat 2020-12-26 20:55:55 I'd say move the intake closer to the front and maybe make the intake smooth removing the 2 gaps at the bottom
creations-chat 2020-12-26 21:15:57 Working on a small version of the IMS Draconis advice? (I'll make a bigger version when I'm done)
creations-chat 2020-12-26 21:18:16 Yeah, but its much bigger ingame. I'll probably upscale it by a little
creations-chat 2020-12-26 21:20:43 <@!394636734979112970> I like it but it still looks rough, maybe smooth it up and add depth to the hull
creations-chat 2020-12-26 21:25:29 make it smooth and add a nice cannon maybe some missile pods
creations-chat 2020-12-26 23:25:11 Remember when I said I was gonna upscale it... About that.

creations-chat 2020-12-27 02:32:39 Oh really? I've made like 5 ships fly without gravity slider btw I said **I THINK**
creations-chat 2020-12-27 02:35:27 Helium is actually good you know? It makes it way easier to make ships fly. Also I fought a Destroyer (with rockets) with only guns and still won. and I wasnt even going to heaven.
creations-chat 2020-12-27 02:41:18 Point D is **~~bullshit~~** useless, Also with the use of Wing panels you cand o a Kensei dorifto with your ISD. Also question why does it matter that we can't use matierals on it? Also B is not true I've been in that situation a million times and its not gone up and down.
creations-chat 2020-12-27 02:43:30 <:4Weird:709084058721714324>Well you should protect the helium. Also why do you put helium at the bottom? It makes things very unstable. Atleast try to protect your helium also its not my problem your ship goes to heaven.
creations-chat 2020-12-27 02:48:30 Well maybe its your design that yeets your ship up when being shot?
creations-chat 2020-12-27 02:52:59 Ah, I understand. I don't use that design since its harder to survive.

creations-chat 2020-12-29 18:19:43 Spine looks fine to me <:wot:695654208837255219>
creations-chat 2020-12-29 19:13:06 guys help what do I make <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
creations-chat 2020-12-29 19:16:29 motorlock towers not chad
creations-chat 2020-12-29 21:12:22 ^^ easy suspension everyone should use instead of being drunk and making complex suspension
creations-chat 2020-12-29 21:16:58 I will Dm you a text changer that might work
creations-chat 2020-12-29 21:54:58 Working on a Titanfall 2 Widow since I don't know what to build
creations-chat 2020-12-29 22:30:53 Also here is some progress on the widow, In this version it is not motorlocked
creations-chat 2020-12-29 22:36:06 I was stupid I didnt properly look at the video lol sorry <:KEKW:670310537300672528>
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:03:35 eh its good still keep it like that
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:05:56 thank you
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:07:57 First of all that tail is literally too short.. wait is there even a tail?
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:23:30 Making the MCS Huntsman from titanfall. I sometimes wonder why alot of people don't make Titanfall spaceships and only the mechs.
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:26:52 Yeah lol, but imagine how many game devs spent SO much time designing the ships and people only care about the Mechs. Also they don't take long. You just need patience.
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:30:20 I agree. Most people are lazy and don't take passion to make something so detailed. They would rather spend time on something small. Also remember my IMS Draconis? I built that in only 1 and a half days with some patience
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:32:43 Go to the search icon on your pc and search "Snipping tool" Then use that to take screenshots please.
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:37:49 Thank you, Also you should fix the cockpit and add more curvature also you should just use rope and suspension for up and down landing gear system.
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:42:40 The front area of the cockpit and the top adding some detail, you should look at an expert's build for inspiration maybe.
creations-chat 2020-12-30 01:44:53 I will DM you about that all.
creations-chat 2020-12-30 16:00:09 **ah yes I love when meme shitposts get more upvotes than literal builds**
creations-chat 2020-12-30 16:30:46 <@!697786877444358186> Impressive maybe you should try to fix the main thruster on the back and make it look less like V2?
creations-chat 2020-12-30 16:36:07 The fuel tank. It looks like a bit like a V2
creations-chat 2020-12-30 16:38:30 it do be looking like a v2 <:WhatChamp:775044367022555166> but shorter oh well its good like that ig. I mean they *sort of* do. Also I was talking about the neck part shorter. Oh well forget it
creations-chat 2020-12-30 16:55:55 <@!693596375052451980> You should delete that 2nd image, its not a creation and you might just might get a creations blacklist.

creations-chat 2020-12-30 17:09:57 I'm trying to use as less pontoons as I can for it. Also Emir its from Titanfall. (Me being pog and making every single titanfall ship since I have nothing better to do with my life) 4 ships in
creations-chat 2020-12-30 17:13:21 Yeah I'm just making the basic shape then I can fix it up and add details, when thats done I'm going to make it fly. And then probably post it in creations.
creations-chat 2020-12-30 17:27:02 <@!687744950158491731> I feel like the engines are a little too forward, yeah.
creations-chat 2020-12-30 17:30:34 Also you should add something around the engines and add camoflauge
creations-chat 2020-12-30 17:40:53 I will send the IMS Draconis equipped with max weapon turrets, supplied with 2 heavy torpedos to murder Guyishere1 in pvp

bug-reports 2021-02-11 12:26:43 mlg
bug-reports 2021-02-11 12:26:45 let me explain
bug-reports 2021-02-11 12:26:47 flares are
bug-reports 2021-02-11 12:26:49 useless
bug-reports 2021-02-11 12:26:55 they rarely work
bug-reports 2021-02-11 12:27:06 I've tested
bug-reports 2021-02-11 12:27:27 if the missile is coming from behind
bug-reports 2021-02-11 12:27:30 it
bug-reports 2021-02-11 12:27:33 Might work
bug-reports 2021-02-11 12:27:55 also missiles are fast so you must have your hand on the flare key at all times
bug-reports 2021-02-11 12:27:59 if someone is firing a missile at you
bug-reports 2021-02-11 12:28:06 also mouse controlled missiles
bug-reports 2021-02-11 12:28:11 flares don't work on them
