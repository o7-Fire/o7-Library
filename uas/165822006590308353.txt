creations-chat 2018-10-31 21:38:40 oh no
creations-chat 2018-10-31 21:48:24 
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:35:03 I've made a monster
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:36:48 It's pretty effective, I've shot down a few planes with minimal damage
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:37:03 
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:37:10 Expandable armor
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:38:26 Yeah
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:38:41 It can even function while heavily damaged, losing about 70% of its wheels
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:39:02 Because "dual drive train simulation"
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:39:57 This thing can also handle terrain like a champ
creations-chat 2018-11-01 01:43:59 I'm pretty impressed with myself with this design given how limited we are with the building in this game
creations-chat 2018-11-01 03:10:42 I shall run it over with my tank
creations-chat 2018-11-03 04:47:52 <@!163143541160148992> Took a little inspiration off your suspension system, hope you don't mind ‚ù§
creations-chat 2018-11-03 05:07:27 Its pretty much the suspension on irl cars
creations-chat 2018-11-03 05:07:33 Although it be a little more... complex
creations-chat 2018-11-03 05:13:08 It's simple yeah but not many people first think of something like this
creations-chat 2018-11-03 05:13:23 And not really many people know how a double wishbone suspension work
creations-chat 2018-11-03 05:14:19 If you want to join my server you can see how it works pretty easily

creations-chat 2018-12-13 07:28:35 <@163143541160148992> I started working on a biped walker quite a bit ago
creations-chat 2018-12-13 07:28:46 I will say it is tough as hell to keep it upright even with a good COM
creations-chat 2018-12-13 07:29:12 
creations-chat 2018-12-13 10:26:17 I think for prop master it needs to be in a stable flight and can move around freely
creations-chat 2018-12-13 10:26:35 For me, I did a prop plane
the-dump 2018-12-17 10:35:40 It‚Äôs a repost, I‚Äôve seen it before

creations-chat 2020-04-06 08:00:14 Formula Hover a new type of motorsport?
creations-chat 2020-04-06 08:07:38 Its not exactly the best at turning sadly
creations-chat 2020-04-06 08:12:03 Thats the thing, I think propellers would ruin the feel of it
creations-chat 2020-04-06 08:21:30 Presentation is all too important when posting in creations
creations-chat 2020-04-06 08:22:14 I spent like 10 mins getting a good angle for my Form Hover craft
creations-chat 2020-04-06 08:22:47 Ok so
creations-chat 2020-04-06 08:22:56 Making the hover drag to 0 makes it a lot easier to turn
