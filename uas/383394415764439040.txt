creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:29:22 bros body fat percentage above 40%
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:31:39 i saw those fat voluptuous fingers
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:34:02 how can you say unranks without realizing thats elitest in nature
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:39:04 lol i dont understand why noobs get shit on for having a mediocre build i mean i understand a little bit of downvotes but itâ€™s so  toxic and shit to just shit on them so much lol
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:41:08 i mean maybe if creations you could criticize and discuss, not just downvote/upvote it would be better
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:46:09 i dont play plane crazy cause of the shite community
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:49:09 Removal of all criticism is wrong but your never going to have constructive criticism just through downvotes
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:52:55 you dont necessarily need upvotes/downvotes
creations-chat 2023-03-16 16:57:45 Im just saying there are better methods of doing it lol
creations-chat 2023-03-16 17:00:58 you just post on a discussion chat and people wont talk about your build or they will simple as that.
creations-chat 2023-03-16 17:06:03 theres really no point of arguing anymore since its talking about more of systemic change
creations-chat 2023-03-16 17:15:27 not if the community is actually good
creations-chat 2023-03-16 17:17:51 i mean my first argument was about elitism not about a change to the upvote system, of course there will always be elitism in some form but in plane crazy its insane
creations-chat 2023-03-16 17:21:19 yea i know im just sick of all the bs lol doesnt mean i dont have to argue
