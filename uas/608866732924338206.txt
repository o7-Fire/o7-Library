help 2021-08-29 21:40:10 likley its the motors deciding that they are going to spin the main helicopter instead of the rotors my only sugestion would be to make it heavier in the parts you dont want to spin
help 2021-08-29 21:40:45 might not work becuase sometimes motors be like that atleast in my experience

help 2021-08-29 21:43:17 this may sound like a stupid answer but did you press the button for turning the speakers on (also to hear the speakers the sound is based off your camera so if you have your camera far away you wont be able to hear it)
