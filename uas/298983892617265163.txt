creations-chat 2019-12-14 17:49:32 This is a remodel of my super heavy design for PvP, I removed the tracks for wheels to reduce lagg and drop block count. I also slammed it to make it look like a hover tank but really it's just a low rider, planning to install hydraulics soon kek.

creations-chat 2019-12-20 20:50:11 Took a long time to make them fit it any sort of way
creations-chat 2019-12-20 20:51:04 Because I didn't have the space
creations-chat 2019-12-20 20:51:25 and there aren't any cylinders in game that will fit that well
creations-chat 2019-12-20 20:52:08 If I did do it I would have to sacrifice the interior aesthetics and I'm just not feelin that

creations-chat 2020-01-31 16:59:47 This is "The Flying Pig" started off as a destroyer build turned into a Flying Gun Boat/PT Boat. I guess it's role would be to patrol the area around a heli carrier, it can be modified to carry one helicopter for assaulting enemy ships I suppose. Took me two days to build and probable 18 hours. This is my first ship build and my first flying build I have ever made. <:GWvickyNueWink:395628473030279168> Thanks for reading and thanks for your like if you give one.
