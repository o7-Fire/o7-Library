creations-chat 2023-06-28 23:52:45 why <@769319142146048001>, why downvote? (ugh fine)
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:48:11 <@653231443937329174> I quite like your biplane, you just gotta improve the painting and add a li'l more detail. Still better than what I can do
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:51:04 Ok you have a point, most of the server members expect fucking art from a newbie
creations-chat 2023-06-29 23:54:13 Man has a massive point.
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:01:47 Pc does have tedious building and a kinda toxic community, but imo it's "good enough". There are still quite a few members and players who will gladly help you learn the ropes and improve your building. Only downside is that it makes me feel like some kind of ADHD mf when I can't finish a build cos it doesn't look right

Also there are quite a few decent builds. Even if they are jagged and lack detail, they are still visually pleasing. That's just my honest neutral thought
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:04:47 I've played many similar games, and the balance between form and function IS super difficult to balance. Even triple A games end up with an ugly ass looking meta that everyone spams, so pc hasn't done that bad
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:07:17 I'm just trying rationalise the fact there's 2 polar opposite opinions here. The "plane crazy is a perfect god made game with nothing wrong and an angelic community" and then there's "everyone here is shit, shit builds, shit game"
creations-chat 2023-06-30 00:09:20 Ok stop promoting this game. Go <#497142796961054721> or smth

creations-chat 2023-06-30 16:19:17 why am I getting so heavily downvoted lol. Unlike yall shitty pvp jets its actually fun to use. Not the same copy pasted stuff that always gets upvoted into legend
creations-chat 2023-06-30 16:21:19 yeah. This server can be pretty toxic lol
creations-chat 2023-06-30 16:24:08 based individual, thx bro
creations-chat 2023-06-30 16:26:17 i want feedback, thats the point
creations-chat 2023-06-30 16:28:20 .-. breh
the-dump 2023-06-30 19:27:53 Indeed

creations-chat 2023-07-01 21:24:15 why? You're a designer, give me some constructive criticism
creations-chat 2023-07-01 21:26:16 useless aah community downvoting for no reason üíÄ it truly is a greenhouse of toxic kids lol
creations-chat 2023-07-01 21:29:16 im pissed that i cant get a word in edgeway's when it comes to improving it.
creations-chat 2023-07-01 21:34:33 idk, im bad at round edges. I still used wedges though
creations-chat 2023-07-01 21:44:35 Desired is the reason why there's fursuits on Roblox

the-dump 2023-07-02 09:45:12 Napalm em
the-dump 2023-07-02 09:45:55 The reason why they failed to kill them darn blues is cos they weren't murikan 'nuff
creations-chat 2023-07-02 20:45:17 Yeah I plan on making a mk2. Less ugly front and more detail, aswell as VTOL and mabye improved weapons
creations-chat 2023-07-03 23:47:10 In my research, spacecraft can be as efficient as jets. Only difference is you can chill above spawn and use it like a Heli to murder newbies more efficiently.
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:43:48 lava doesnt destroy blocks, and you can literally go for a swim. Also it lets you jump super high for some reason
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:53:30 what works?
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:54:19 thats the point
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:54:25 lava borke
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:54:45 its only in non-pvp mode btw
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:54:52 ok so
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:55:24 lava doesnt damage blocks or players, only charrs them
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:55:42 if you jump while in lava, you go 400 studs in the air
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:55:57 if you go into edit mode you'll still be on  fire
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:56:34 true
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:56:49 but the lava immunity and hulk jumpng doesnt seem intended
bug-reports 2023-07-04 14:57:03 and this only works in non pvp mode
bug-reports 2023-07-04 15:38:53 got the lava bug now?
bug-reports 2023-07-04 21:46:29 Lava doesn't hurt in non PvP
bug-reports 2023-07-04 21:48:31 It should do though
bug-reports 2023-07-04 21:48:40 ....
bug-reports 2023-07-04 21:48:56 Bruh the lava pool doesn't do anything
bug-reports 2023-07-04 21:52:11 
bug-reports 2023-07-04 21:52:45 I don't mean lava weapon, I mean terrain lava
creations-chat 2023-07-05 09:24:55 <@690931622345834527> what have you done to mah boy!?!?!?
creations-chat 2023-07-05 09:26:57 Tf is going on with his eye? And all his colours are off. His front panel (one with the eye) stays the same after the core transfer
creations-chat 2023-07-05 09:30:43 Fair. Also, **would a moron punch you INTO. THIS. PIT!?!? COULD A MORON DO THAT, HUH!?!?!!!** (oh no)
creations-chat 2023-07-05 09:33:55 Nice. Also, "fatty fatty, no parent" -Wheatley
