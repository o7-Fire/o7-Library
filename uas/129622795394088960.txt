creations-chat 2019-10-10 17:09:57 I really don't know, I worked on it yesterday after 25 hours of fasting, send help
creations-chat 2019-10-10 17:10:47 *the wings, as you can see, have several configurations,  the one you are looking at is the most stable one.
creations-chat 2019-10-10 17:13:28 it also has vectored thrust motors underneath and they really help
creations-chat 2019-10-10 17:26:52 yep
creations-chat 2019-10-10 17:26:55 yom kippur
creations-chat 2019-10-10 17:27:03 so my brain was abit low on energy when i did that
creations-chat 2019-10-25 14:25:36 when your plane looks really ugly-just add the weird wing change.
creations-chat 2019-10-25 14:29:27 yeah i know, but if its ugly and you add the wings you make it look like it was ugly on purpose <@!415036739653074944>

creations-chat 2020-07-18 02:54:22 i know that it looks pretty bad, but its my first plane that, well, kinda looks like a plane? a lot of inspiration was drawn from the dornier 17, im honestly surprised that I made this fly
creations-chat 2020-07-18 02:56:47 every other wing size that I tried just made it look "edgy"
creations-chat 2020-07-18 02:56:51 like wing span
creations-chat 2020-07-18 02:57:22 i just realized that the front kinda looks like a hind cockpit hmm
help 2020-09-14 06:37:05 What is the purpose of servo motors?
creations-chat 2020-11-14 14:47:52 its technically epikman's because its saved on his account
creations-chat 2020-11-14 15:00:15 > <@!129622795394088960> you dont need to keep it light because hellium exists ðŸ¤¡
<@!451853936815636511> dont clown me.
creations-chat 2020-11-14 15:02:03 the thing is, it works on center of mass, so we cannot make it light using helium, because then the center of mass will be off and we cba trying to work it out, if something works- dont touch it.
bug-reports 2021-06-27 22:57:53 the configuration screen while in the build menu (the screwdriver on the menu itself) has different element placement than using the screwdriver tool on blocks
