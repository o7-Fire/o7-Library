plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:35:16 It goes dhbebdbsbf
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:35:13 And if you don't put a seat on it
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:34:54 Since it just uses small prop engines to steer
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:34:40 I don't hit alot of the targets, and unlike cutter bugs, I cant swarm it
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:34:17 Just flying around at 700 and speeding to 1.5K for impact
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:33:56 But I dunno the missile is fun
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:33:19 ywes
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:32:08 Most of the time the best way to get rid of swarms is to kill the driver
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:31:41 And look at him go
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:31:33 Just slap a little hover engine on the missile
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:31:19 1000 times better
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:31:07 My missile does that too but like
plane-crazy 2020-07-15 23:30:31 How do cutter bugs even work

plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:30:59 *dogfights shredder bug*
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:30:26 the only shredder bug that I saw that didnt annoy me was a person who made a b-29 and put shredder bugs in it as bombs, it was pretty funny
plane-crazy 2020-06-30 09:29:11 you call them shredder bugs, I call them suicide squids

plane-crazy 2019-11-02 15:56:35 <@!339519624968404993> whats better, people abusing the votekick system, which will require a majority of players, or that players can actually 
eh
play the game?
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 15:49:11 i dont care about the report system, they can just create a new account and do it again, if theres a votekick system, players can actually do something.
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 15:46:57 is just full of lag machines
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 15:46:52 because every pvp game
plane-crazy 2019-11-02 15:46:48 votekick system

plane-crazy 2019-08-17 11:36:24 lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 11:36:23 its a water prop and a jet
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 11:36:08 wait what
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 11:35:27 I used the same amount and size as the water props.
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 11:35:11 (also they dont generate any thrust if they are not in water and the jet engine threw it off balance)
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 11:34:10 <@!322970944303923200> because I hate the jet engine sound and the jet engine is pretty ugly on this "fixed wing ground effect aircraft"
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 11:30:50 o
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 11:27:03 I saw someone who made a magnet launcher to launch his boat from base into water
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 11:26:39 lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 11:23:39 lol
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 11:15:31 nevermind I cant make the wings out of half blocks as there isnt half wedge block 1x4
plane-crazy 2019-08-17 11:14:26 had to make them out of normal blocks so it wont fly, now with water prop im gonna make it half blocks

plane-crazy 2019-06-26 00:37:15 This is roblox.
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 00:36:14 The Antonov A-40 Krylya Tanka (Russian: крылья танка, meaning "tank wings") was a Soviet attempt to allow a tank to glide onto a battlefield after being towed aloft by an airplane, to support airborne forces or partisans. A prototype was built and tested in 1942, but was found to be unworkable. This vehicle is sometimes called the A-40T or KT
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 00:34:55 I think
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 00:34:53 Bomber*
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 00:34:49 It was supposed to be carried from a heavy bombee
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 00:34:31 If you believe
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 00:34:27 Shh
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 00:33:57 Russian

Make an A-40
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 00:13:57 It didn't fly because it was too heavy and things like that
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 00:10:47 wings and tail kit for tanks
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 00:10:41 antonov A-40
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 00:10:20 
plane-crazy 2019-06-26 00:10:14 I wonder if this is possible-
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 10:34:48 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 10:34:46 you cant do a navy battle if there is no navy
plane-crazy 2019-06-25 10:30:28 people getting mad and calling me a tryhard for killing them-
just go to a non pvp server, you aren't even putting up a fight and you are just wasting slots for possible good fighters.
plane-crazy 2019-06-22 18:55:26 may I ask-
how do you actually make ships move?
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 11:13:52 rekt
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 11:13:49 well, fight me
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 11:13:43 told him
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 11:13:41 called it bad
plane-crazy 2019-06-21 11:13:38 someone insulted my plane
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 19:47:02 Lol
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 19:44:59 I knocked a buggy off the map like that
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 19:44:58 And people always get mad because when I crash into them they get knocked back
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 19:41:08 It was originally me trying to test some things about delta wings, it used to have 3 engines
I strapped one more
And then alot more
It was intended after the modification to be used as an anti-navy plane, but after seeing that well, its good against naval,grounds and air units, I gave it the edgy paintjob and I'm using it as a multi-purpose plane
plane-crazy 2019-06-20 19:26:28 place your bets, what was this plane's original purpose and what do I use it for now?
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 06:46:56 nope I am not doing it, I shoot only when I need, mostly on boats as the plane I am using was made for attacking naval/ground units, although decent in dogfights too.
plane-crazy 2019-06-19 06:36:31 people call me a tryhard just because I can actually fly my plane and actually destroy other people's creations lmao
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 11:33:02 Oof.
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 09:55:13 That looks hella sick
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:37:50 I attacked the hell out of a ship today with my weird, really steerable interceptor
The guy didn't understand that if he doesn't want to be attacked 
He can leave pvp
plane-crazy 2019-06-11 02:34:39 Wow
