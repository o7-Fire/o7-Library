creations-chat 2020-12-20 13:25:48 hows my monstrosity
creations-chat 2021-01-31 13:56:12 i have made a functioning harrier, how to make the actual one?
creations-chat 2021-01-31 14:05:46 uhm okay, how should i build parts in plane crazy that matches rl (i tried making the U2, ended up being a t-pose plane)
creations-chat 2021-01-31 14:11:55 i somehow nailed the vtol part before adding meaningful shapes to make it ressembles a harrier, the problem before adding wings that i face was not able to control the plane while floating, that was fixed by adding control surfaces
anyway, i dont wanna rip down the thing and then nailing the design, the thing im lacking is power and willpower to add *curves*, how to fix that issue?
thks for feedback, i'll check the tool
the-dump 2021-02-22 13:00:46 in tf2, the rocket launcher resides as a mobility and  "i cant aim hitscan" tool. return to ww1 american war crim... i mean bullets
creations-chat 2021-03-21 18:14:02 hows my flaps
creations-chat 2021-03-21 18:16:04 sounds very neat, but i meant the gray part that got extended/foiled down
creations-chat 2021-03-21 18:18:40 imma paint it, i dont wanna use the custom made control surfaces cuz i dont know how to use motor 2 for that/ rollrate and speeds pretty ded/ it may overun the wing area, kinda sucks
creations-chat 2021-04-02 19:14:04 how does this makes you feel
creations-chat 2021-04-02 19:16:26 was expecting worse tbh
creations-chat 2021-04-30 05:31:16 Hows my obese u boat

creations-chat 2021-05-09 10:18:30 how can i improve the chubby plane
creations-chat 2021-05-09 10:20:53 the bombay from within the plane
creations-chat 2021-05-09 15:56:07 A bit late to reply but, apologies. Let’s just hope my potato laptop doesn’t crash while I test for the custom control panels. Oh yeah, it needed those cheese grinders cuz back elevator and vert stabilizer is dead (vertical position when building) so those cheese grinders are quite important to wrangle the plane (vertically inverted controls). But anyways, let see what I can do
creations-chat 2021-05-10 06:46:48 <@!466673912760107009>motor lock pain
creations-chat 2021-05-12 02:48:09 modified av8b harrier, how to improve
creations-chat 2021-05-12 02:54:08 made sense
creations-chat 2021-05-12 09:21:37 :((, im sad
Thanks for the feedback anyway (bad color palete is my attempt of painting winter camo, didnt go too well)
-imma paint all white if it hurts your eyes seeing what i posted
- revert to og vert stabilizer?
-bad graphics cuz laptop uses antique GPU, apologies 
- glitchy wing if i do angle my wings
-no, im not great at motor locks
-cheese graters to control jet in vtol better (less dedicated engine for controlling)
creations-chat 2021-05-12 09:29:57 Is there anymore specific ways i can improve my "harrier-inspired" jet
creations-chat 2021-05-12 09:39:37 appreciated, and dont just circle the whole thing
creations-chat 2021-05-12 09:48:16 a very detailed description of what i did wrong, thank you
-intake is close to the front "nozzle", a bulge
-bomb placement is purely comical, just to maximise angryness
-im bad at nose design, kill me
creations-chat 2021-05-14 09:33:12 any improvements can i make for my plane?

creations-chat 2021-05-15 01:23:26 where can i get a better POV of the ww2 version of USS Midway
creations-chat 2021-05-15 01:26:12 i believe you can manually change the color of paint by changing the value of the color shown in the color tab (you might wanna paste existing color "coordinates" instead of guessing)
creations-chat 2021-05-15 01:33:17 color combination uses the three values (x,y,z) corresponding to red, green, blue
<@!229035780423680001>  your should find a color palete online to ease up the gradient mixing thing
creations-chat 2021-05-16 03:23:18 is this good length for the USS midway cv-41?
creations-chat 2021-05-16 04:09:24 is this good enough for a cv? (size)
creations-chat 2021-05-16 04:17:40 please guide me, this is first time i build something this big
creations-chat 2021-05-16 04:40:13 any suggestions?
creations-chat 2021-05-16 04:43:07 -<@!548973346805776396> like 1.5 times longer?
-<@!694009880507580528> ah, massive pain
creations-chat 2021-05-17 08:15:03 the white part that sits on the deck is the island, is my island big enough for this ship?
creations-chat 2021-05-17 11:49:05 Well yeah, you can call it something else, but’s it’s commonly referred to as the island
creations-chat 2021-05-18 03:57:57 how did i do?

creations-chat 2021-05-20 09:44:33 i somehow have slight hunch the verti stabilisers are small
oh yeah, no holes in wings with custom control panles is quite special for me, just sayin
creations-chat 2021-05-20 09:50:15 what a predicament amirite?
creations-chat 2021-05-20 09:52:21 im sure you can do custom angles for wings
you can try motor lock magic to decrease the height

-you gotta do what ya gotta do
creations-chat 2021-05-20 09:54:35 what magic is this

-restart pc
creations-chat 2021-05-20 09:56:47 it actually looks kinda decent

creations-chat 2021-05-23 01:16:58 if you are mad and want to achieve the greatest accuracy for your build, then you should tear them up, then build them back
or you can add half blocks to increase width :LL
creations-chat 2021-05-23 01:22:11 oh yeah guys, how to add catapults for aircraft carriers and such?
creations-chat 2021-05-23 01:25:21 i would say for counter balance

creations-chat 2021-05-23 08:51:22 Wish I hadn’t had a 4 hour nap to witness the wild fire that happened here :DD
creations-chat 2021-05-23 09:49:27 I’m planning to get rank with this, it is over 4K blocks but I don’t think it can achieve them upvotes, what more should I do?
creations-chat 2021-05-23 09:58:25 So I just need to paint more, and add in details like secondary batteries, AA gun mounts, antennas, catapults and etc?


Will do, thanks
creations-chat 2021-05-23 10:03:42 Minor question <@!615876745710534676>, how do I build a simple catapult on a ship

creations-chat 2021-05-31 04:09:41 just saying, ive been there with the single digits fps  , but you definitely should put the ship in water if thats the case, and if its underwater, then the struts and box hangar would still be too close to water :L

but, it is not needed, also plane rolls fine, so meh :L
creations-chat 2021-06-02 03:38:12 pardon me, i held no amount of skill capable of making sharp nose in small area

- also, the cheese grater got bolted with another one, issue of cheese fixed
creations-chat 2021-06-02 03:42:10 dont think that way, it hurts brain, i simply meant i cant perform such task building a sharp nose, for a plane, in a small amount of given space
creations-chat 2021-06-02 03:45:20 im just gonna search the plane here to see how they did the nose
creations-chat 2021-06-02 03:54:35 well, sorta there

creations-chat 2021-06-03 09:25:40 you can try and use the half wedge in wedge 2, ie the smallest block, then motor lock it into position
creations-chat 2021-06-03 09:27:45 use it in conjunction with sparklers

sparklers for muzzle break
creations-chat 2021-06-03 09:30:03 you can try this cancer method
creations-chat 2021-06-03 09:33:38 what i meant was, motor lock the half wedges into center position, then build that massive motor lock tower, and then further motor lock sparklers onto it, or is it that it doesnt look good?
creations-chat 2021-06-03 09:38:35 i have never seen me262 with box engine design tbh
creations-chat 2021-06-03 09:42:44 people have not drop feedbacks for my pen when they downvote it, weird

creations-chat 2021-06-04 03:12:39 improved f104

i did:
-changing the proportions of the front wing and verti stabiliser 
-add 2 more drop tanks under the wings, and make drops tanks able to be dropped
-change the rear wedge part to fix the back proportion problem, im not going to move 2 very complicated motor locked towers that resides there

what more can i do to improve plane

*also the on ground vibration problem, how to fix that?*
creations-chat 2021-06-04 03:34:37 yeah, thats what i did, it just to compensate my lazy ass to modify the whole rear

creations-chat 2021-06-11 12:58:41 usable

creations-chat 2021-06-14 15:48:53 Dunno why people not giving feedbacks for my hilariously bad build
creations-chat 2021-06-14 15:56:44 F104, search it in search bar
creations-chat 2021-06-14 16:00:07 The thing is, it deforms so much, there can’t be any constructive feedback to be made to correct plane to original blueprint, might as well be custom jet made by the average new player
creations-chat 2021-06-14 16:03:54 By the looks of the jet, it appears to be an attempt to replicate a mig of some sort, if you do so, type that model into search, add phrase “sketchfab” then investigate your confusion compared to the original plane
creations-chat 2021-06-14 16:10:07 Sorry for not responding to your feedback earlier, and thanks for feedback
creations-chat 2021-06-14 16:12:22 I’m beginning to question if the average chad’s of the Pcc is actually just undes gaming more intense than medic gaming can

creations-chat 2021-06-15 13:28:58 but it works, thats the point of the camo

what i meant was, in pcc, the only reason of a camo is to make plane look "better", what i thought of was an effective color scheme that doesnt look too bland, and conceals a plane during dogfight, we can just copy real life camo into creations and such anytime so, why not?
creations-chat 2021-06-15 13:33:28 why is it in japanese tho

creations-chat 2021-06-20 01:39:55 what affect does 2 delta wings give to 1 normal wing panel (2 delta wing to fill up holes)

also, wing is 6 blocks long, and i use delta wing 1x4, so....
creations-chat 2021-06-20 01:44:39 i heard some other people saying that i should increase wings "volume" (increasing wing size ruins proportions) to reduce shaking on some build (mini cruise missile travelling at 300 speed shakes stupid strokes, adding more wings seem to solve problem), so in what case should i perform the motorlock of 2 delta instead of 1 normal wing panel?

creations-chat 2021-06-27 04:01:55 from a design point of view, it looks wider than the mikasa i sent, but you should still finish your build with mechanism in it

<@456226577798135808>  the new paint job will come later, I need to fix few more things, the last major one would be the cockpit
creations-chat 2021-07-08 11:30:53 I’m being attacked and used as a battleground like fucking Vietnam, chill guys this is feedbacks, why was it shitty, point the details out
creations-chat 2021-07-08 11:39:04 Red wasn’t default but i guess it’s still too bright, oops
The only thing that isn’t offscale is the nose part, but then again the whole plane is stupid large and fixing scaling is a difficult task, might as well call it a custom build since I’m using it for bombing like a true lad, not chad

<@!718006867808485447>  I still didn’t know how to check the creation’s scaling accuracy compared to 2d blueprints, the way I build is to recreate a specific detail of a creation one by one, which might result in enlargement (in this case, very obvious) or miscaling, which sucks

From this point on, I’m might just finish up the jet with some other bits, thanks for your (both of you) constructive feedbacks

creations-chat 2021-07-10 11:21:43 how can you make your entire system not wobble so much during loading, when i demonstrate my iteration of a loading system the entire thing just wobbles around which really affects the performance of the loading phase

creations-chat 2021-07-19 13:27:50 Angle lock is not that difficult once you learn the basic principles of it
creations-chat 2021-07-19 13:32:51 You could just use locked motor 1 and keybinds as well as a protruding structure to set a specific angle, for me it seems easier
creations-chat 2021-07-19 13:35:05 No it’s not lol, it’s just that you spam builds in creation, as well as lack of paint variations, and not sufficient use of motorlock
creations-chat 2021-07-19 14:01:18 Angle tha back jet engines, also fix the roughness issue of the main body
creations-chat 2021-07-19 14:04:24 Hate to say this but, the whole thing, whenever there’s random protrusion, it is considered as rough

Especially fix the section from the main body to the neck, that looks dumb
creations-chat 2021-07-19 14:09:14 Ouch, this looks pain
creations-chat 2021-07-19 14:12:05 The normal everyday case of us gold people giving harsh feedbacks to the newer player base and they got mad and rage on why it doesn’t look that bad, usually it’s cuz we have high standards (not me, I’m still hot shit), or that the new player’s confidence in their build is far from the base standards of **good** in the community

or you could just use simple motor on the other end to counteract the angle being induced
creations-chat 2021-07-19 15:07:33 aircraft looks pretty old with the kind of roughness, it could be better

~~not mine but yeah ok~~

creations-chat 2021-07-21 14:52:30 <@!466628021273624586>  you see mate, your builds aren’t bad, you just need to chill aye?
creations-chat 2021-07-21 14:58:06 Ye just need to calm down with your posts in creation, that’s all

One feedback I would give is take pictures closer to your builds, we like them that way more
~~unless if it’s hideous~~
creations-chat 2021-07-22 03:06:07 doesnt look great, remember to add in layer of camo to mask the plainess of the hull
creations-chat 2021-07-22 03:33:04 dont you think it looks a little plain?

fine, add weathering effect if you dont want people gushing about your uninspiring hull
creations-chat 2021-07-22 03:45:02 you drunk?

you could borrow destroyer's camo since its easier that way
creations-chat 2021-07-22 03:49:52 if it didnt have camo, you can use any ship's camo for that matter
creations-chat 2021-07-22 03:54:28 https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/866962385100079165 this ship is trash, the hull is made in prehistoric time of me, yet the camo, saved it from being dunked, so it's your choice of camo, or small little black circles and complex box geometry to break apart the plain looking hull

<@!414998453962145792> i literally linked my ship, what
creations-chat 2021-07-22 03:57:24 mine, my ship is trash, bow is funny
creations-chat 2021-07-22 03:59:51 i learned angle lock recently, so now i look at my builds very differently
creations-chat 2021-07-22 04:02:43 add small rim line with different colours
creations-chat 2021-07-22 04:10:01 looking at this angle, i can see the rims and the complex geometry a dreadnought can have, you should add in those complex geometry, cuz your hull be looking blank
creations-chat 2021-07-22 04:17:35 im not saying you must you angle locks, im saying you should add more details besides the black holes to the hull
creations-chat 2021-07-22 04:19:47 ***rims***

i said rims earlier before, damn, just look at your model and ponder
creations-chat 2021-07-22 04:22:18 you see the white line on the model's hull?

yeah, thats the rim
creations-chat 2021-07-22 04:56:01 i think you should finish the whole ship before further detailing

wait for cooldown, and im not telling you to stop, its just that you didnt really get my idea of how to improve
creations-chat 2021-07-22 04:58:21 the white part on the hull is the rims
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:00:56 you see how the hull is not smooth and flat?
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:06:19 theres no good 3d model of the ship lol
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:09:09 oh well, fuck it, rims is small insignificant detail anyway
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:12:50 if you look at the hull from this angle, you see boxes, geometry that sticks out and goes in, of the hull, just look at the right side of the hull
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:19:38 yeah, said so
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:22:44 yeah, but its not that apparent
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:24:57 no not the red part, its the gray part i was talking about
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:32:36 i have e
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:34:48 individual fencing that curves

<@456226577798135808> pretty hard from those angles to see since the **rims** detail ive been gushing about is only ever visible when you look at a ship head on or you look at it between the side-top view angle, but i'll do circle the area that ove been saying
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:38:21 the individual lines that appears on that side is the best illustration of what i can muster out of this pic

<@!541089825428602915> its on the hull
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:41:30 now i have to build what i meant cuz no good 3d model exist bruv

this is the kind of detail i want to see on your ship, sorry if i did, which i did, cause a mess in feedback
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:57:20 5 inch smaller
creations-chat 2021-07-22 05:59:36 well yes, as long as it breaks the plainess of the hull

fuck it, imma build dreadnought style ship since i started on the angled hull
creations-chat 2021-07-22 06:05:58 weld lines are very hard to angle since small hitbox and less of an option, i also want custom angled so have to do that

creations-chat 2021-07-23 10:59:32 wow, that sucks then
creations-chat 2021-07-23 11:18:40 guys help, i got called out as tutorial user (no am not, im just nub) and i did this funny shit

no like, how do you control your helis?
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:01:13 what happening here
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:04:06 e
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:06:39 swashplate allows individual rotors to tilt up or down, which allows helis it's movement, not the ability to rotate the rotor blades to change ascend and descend speed
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:08:55 dogshit ability to tilt the whole rotor set, heli still can do basic movements, h
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:16:04 heli, what should i improve on?

other than than the core mechanism ofc, that causes pain
creations-chat 2021-07-23 12:18:59 <@!757887014388367401>  i like your enthusiasm, a feedback i would give is to use more colours

<@!541155734382182412> thanks lad
creations-chat 2021-07-24 17:46:51 i cant make it what you are making, therefore i cant say if that creation, or something i dont know, is enough

motor 2s arent that great for angle locking since they arent locked, meaning that they will spazed out
creations-chat 2021-07-26 06:52:59 you could use cameras to make a specific angle (build cameras sticks outwards of the details as well as the base)

creations-chat 2021-07-31 13:37:09 uhhh, i can explain

**compensation for lack of pvp skill**

creations-chat 2021-07-31 13:41:52 the pvp skill falls into a curve similar that of the bell

you have the most nubs, guns and shredders, very unfun

you have the average joe, capable of using rockets for carnage

then you have super pro who learned to use hyperdrives, so only practical way is gun
creations-chat 2021-07-31 13:50:46 much thanks for feedback
creations-chat 2021-07-31 13:52:48 alrighty, ima put guns in realistic way

creations-chat 2022-07-26 21:02:29 I still don’t see a problem how you can’t just put the piston in the bottom which negates the exposed piston heads tho

creations-chat 2022-11-16 01:47:49 but sir
that is the least bulky turret set up for any kind of weaponary


pain
creations-chat 2022-11-16 02:11:13 ofc
you could conv drive around the ship kiting it while whittling it down

or use a jet and spam rockets on it

most obvious statement ever that doesnt have to be said
help 2022-11-16 02:13:46 island honestly looked too big
or ship not long enough
creations-chat 2022-11-16 02:16:20 why need more

ive been public pvp testing it and it works just fine
creations-chat 2022-11-16 02:19:57 more weapons =less rewarding
and deterent just means no naval pvp in public server so why would you
creations-chat 2022-11-16 02:22:00 conv drive

https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/831442311522418708/1030978457531854930/unknown.png

Idk
If you were to make battlecruiser then it gon look funky cuz battlecruiser designs

<@456226577798135808> literally are lol
They fun to shit on public pvp
creations-chat 2022-11-17 03:50:26 Nope am in bed
If you were to make cruiser you could do the USS Salem or the Atlanta
creations-chat 2022-11-17 03:57:43 Nope
I would be busy with irl stuff
Your prob alone in this
Unless you want help with dumbing down of expectations cuz really tho, getting into a mindset of not making shit builds instead of making pro builds is better for your mental health

You could ask me for hull designs, dunno bout turrets tho, atlantas are small and for accurate scale you would be using my secondaries
creations-chat 2022-11-17 04:04:49 You scale the ship to the turrets
So figure out the turrets

creations-chat 2023-01-04 14:14:00 nose should be 1-1.5 blocks shorter and tail must be 1 block shorter
wings also apparently needs to be 1 block less thick in wing root thickness

in general make the plane smaller damn
creations-chat 2023-01-04 14:44:00 good thing is plane is made entirely out of camera lock so it shouldnt be too hard
creations-chat 2023-01-04 15:06:11 i just like this tbh
creations-chat 2023-01-04 15:41:34 the Cf100 Canuck was originally built as an interceptor lmaoo

creations-chat 2023-04-24 01:33:19 not really

the person who makes this (Animated. P) still has some artifacts despite it being one of the best nose cones in game
creations-chat 2023-04-24 01:40:45 ever since the discovery of nose cones technique, shit changed

also ive seen that since him and SR's mega planes being posted, the trend of over detailing shits with signs and text toned down to simplified details with focus on shapes
creations-chat 2023-04-24 01:43:09 shit ton of delta panels
creations-chat 2023-04-24 01:46:06 the point of it is progressing beyond limits

that guy does professional modeling for money so hes used to making shitsl ooking good

creations-chat 2023-05-03 01:47:58 tbh tho, i dont think theres gonna be a truly better Tomcat in PCC

lotta higher qualities looks good yes, but comparing them is hard, they are just kinda like different flavors of the same thing, nothing is really outstanding
creations-chat 2023-05-03 01:55:28 no, i think its just another F14 cuz there really isnt a better Tomcat, for example Animated.P's or SR's or who else i cant rember cuz theres so much

they kinda saturated the standards of "good" for a tomcat
creations-chat 2023-05-03 02:02:21 cant find

creations-chat 2023-05-09 00:34:50 brick
creations-chat 2023-05-11 13:18:38 You technically could make any build be PvP capable and be decent looking compared to pre-shit pcc standards if you have a strong enough set up that allows you to not be physics lagged
creations-chat 2023-05-11 15:25:20 2021 or sth

Idk, it’s been so long I lost time
