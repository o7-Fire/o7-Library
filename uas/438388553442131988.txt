When i added a rocker engine to it, it flew away a short distance(~character length) and froze. When i got closer, it got a little further every time. Its also now happend to a missile i was making

events-chat 2022-04-25 16:30:11 Always has been
events-chat 2022-04-26 08:45:15 a ship event. bigger ships are allowed(but maybe both should be anchored cuz lag)
events-chat 2022-04-26 14:01:54 Yes. With teams maybe. 2 big ships(team captains), 8 small boats. Either give each team 1 big ship and 4 boats, or 2 ships vs 8 boats

events-chat 2022-04-26 14:04:06 I like bote
events-chat 2022-04-26 14:04:33 Maybe 1 person has to bomb a target at the airfield, while the rest is aa
events-chat 2022-04-26 16:26:51 How about an escort event? 1 team has to escort a slow truck to the airport(or somewhere else) and protect it. The other team has to destroy the target(either by air, navy, or land. Maybe put a cap on it, like 3 land  builds, 2 flying builds, 1 navy build)
events-chat 2022-04-26 16:30:12 hmm, maybe the target can be a very strong build
events-chat 2022-04-26 16:31:05 or the driver/something inside the truck has to be destroyed. It'll have to be something small, so it'll give the defenders time to destroy the enemies. Or there will be multiple trucks
events-chat 2022-04-26 16:32:14 another idea: king of the canyon. 1 team has to make sure no enemies get inside the innovation inc base. Land based units only(unless it's support? Like missiles on a ship, but limit the support units)

creations-chat 2022-04-26 19:24:28 can you say something in <#384025409945337856> so I can see if the bot will react with <:Upvote:490311647492309004>  and <:Downvote:490311668556103700>? <:trollface:775024642104229898>
creations-chat 2022-04-26 19:27:24 ok, bot still down. Nice build tho <@766369468347580437>
creations-chat 2022-04-26 19:29:25 Maybe we should ping a mod and ask him if he can give the bot a good bonk. Bonking something usually works if it's broken
creations-chat 2022-04-26 20:28:48 thanks

creations-chat 2022-04-26 21:44:18 Thanks! Itâ€™s probably because of helium, ballast, wing panels and the right amount of thrust
creations-chat 2022-04-27 07:43:22 I made all of my pics with either a jetpack or zooming out
creations-chat 2022-04-27 07:45:14 Or do you mean for the missile? To get that view, I click on the button to view the cam on the missile, jump out of the main pilot seat and get back in
creations-chat 2022-04-28 14:00:05 ***deleted link cuz it's probably self promotion*** for the people who wanted a tutorial on my missile, I made it. ~~Does this count as self promotion? probably does, in that case delete this mods~~
creations-chat 2022-04-28 14:01:58 eh, I think missile tutorials and stuff like that is different
creations-chat 2022-04-28 14:04:14 because theyâ€˜re assets people can use on their builds + they can be difficult to make for (new) players
creations-chat 2022-04-28 14:14:20 Why wouldn't they?

creations-chat 2022-04-29 21:52:22 also, is the plane itself too big? I have reasons for it tho
creations-chat 2022-04-29 21:56:50 Yeah, one of the reasons itâ€˜s that big is because I designed a small humvee for it. Iâ€˜ll probably design a new humvee though
creations-chat 2022-04-30 08:06:45 you mean 1 block thick? Theyâ€˜re half a block thick now

help 2022-05-09 16:54:38 I'm trying to replace the mini f16's on my carrier with a carrier-based plane. So far I've tried making an f18, f35 and a harrier(kind of), but failed. Any suggestions for an easy to make mini plane(carrier based ofc)?
help 2022-05-09 17:01:05 I tried those already but failed

help 2022-05-09 17:37:40 it'll have to be the same size as the f16 next to it
help 2022-05-09 17:49:07 Good idea. Iâ€™ll have to see about the length tho
help 2022-05-09 17:49:28 The big elevator is 13x13 iirc

creations-chat 2022-05-11 22:22:50 <@456226577798135808> Your armored car is pretty wide. For a next time Iâ€˜d try to make it thinner
creations-chat 2022-05-11 22:24:47 how are you supposed to improve if you delete everything. Like my builds were any better when I was new.           Make it an odd number next time. Even is harder to work with
creations-chat 2022-05-11 22:26:56 Toxicity wonâ€˜t help people improve. If anything, it makes people lose motivation
creations-chat 2022-05-11 22:29:42 Just ignore them. You can look at my older builds in creations. They were pretty bad and people didnâ€˜t like it either, but I slowly improved
creations-chat 2022-05-11 22:32:08 these are some of my oldest builds I have in creations
creations-chat 2022-05-11 22:34:15 yeah, I used to do that. Iâ€˜m not gonna change it tho, because I liked it back then, so I upvoted it. Also, I was pretty bad at the game back then. You can shit on it all you want, I donâ€˜t like them anymore anyways cuz theyâ€˜re old and bad
creations-chat 2022-05-11 22:37:45 maybe that should be changed. How is the game supposed to grow if â€˜prosâ€˜ keep bullying new people which makes them stop playing
creations-chat 2022-05-11 22:39:49 not a good thing for a community tho. It wonâ€˜t grow as fast/shrink, making the devs less motivated to update which might result in the game dying faster. Or it wonâ€˜t, idk

creations-chat 2022-05-12 21:04:16 Eh, Iâ€˜d say just keep improving and setting your own standard higher each time. Also start with very simple motor lock and gradually make it more complex.   Oops, pings was on which makes it seem this message is directed towards you lol
creations-chat 2022-05-14 09:49:09 <@!592619320421384232> make the window look like multiple windows(motor locking delta wings inside), make the dark grey color on heli deck slate material and try to move/hide the torpedo. Also, can I see more angles?

creations-chat 2022-07-06 16:28:13 Ig a new paint job will improve it at least a bit

Iâ€™m not gonna change them, because I tried but failed + I stopped working on it actively when it was about 75% done a few months ago and Iâ€™ve got other projects rn. As for the phalanx, I wanted to give it some more firepower. If I were to make it again now, Iâ€™d probably add some guided missiles in the vls and add some more naval guns and stuff, like the irl one(I started working on it abt 6 months ago)

creations-chat 2022-08-24 18:54:39 Should I keep the yellow outline and just fill it in a different way? Something like this: https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/384025409945337856/995338370295267378
creations-chat 2022-08-24 19:01:11 damn boi, he thicc
creations-chat 2022-08-24 19:28:47 Doing a hull like my latest boat is pretty hard on this hull, because the vertical slope is 1x1 wedges, while the horizontal slope is 1x2, 1x3, 1x3, 1x4, 1x4. So how does this hull look?
creations-chat 2022-08-24 19:31:30 hm, angle locking a hull doesn't seem like a good option either, because 1. I haven't done it before and 2. It's not a pointy hull, it's rounded. Does anyone have a suggestion on how I should do the hull?
creations-chat 2022-08-24 19:35:52 you mean like this?https://discord.com/channels/384021699466756103/504436696021204992/1012081057107021854
creations-chat 2022-08-24 19:56:11 I think I know which one I prefer, I just wanna know which one y'all like better and if you even like any of them
creations-chat 2022-08-24 20:01:38 I mean, I can make a smooth hull, but I've never done it like this. Usually my hulls are 1x2 wedges going down, but this hull has 1x1 wedges, making it steeper. Idk, I just find it a little harder to do. Also, I'm trying to think of other ways to do the hull
creations-chat 2022-08-24 20:04:27 I thought of trying that too, but I'm not sure if the would even work, because the hull is rounded and not pointy. I'll try angle lock now tho

<@359613171495075842> did you have a pointy or a rounded front?

<@767800077837926431> I'm not sure what you mean, could you send an example?
creations-chat 2022-08-24 20:12:10 I meant the shape from above
creations-chat 2022-08-24 20:19:47 ohh, I'm doing it a like this. Angling it on both axis

creations-chat 2022-10-10 13:59:22 <@439829923192897536> your drone doesn't have a lot of colors + isn't very detailed. It also looks pretty simple, but you can improve over time

My suggestion is that you paint the propeller a black/dark grey color, make the back not square, add some decals and add details.
