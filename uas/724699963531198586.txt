creations-chat 2020-11-03 01:09:10 "TheFurryEngineer" welcome to the club im a furry that made a flying halcyon class cruiser from halo
creations-chat 2020-11-03 01:10:49 i would make the pillar more detailed if there were blocks that could go semi-sideways and stick to wedges

creations-chat 2020-11-03 15:53:49 im making a new halcyon class cruiser that has less height but overall width & length
creations-chat 2020-11-03 15:56:00 i never said that 'pillar of autism' is a funny name
creations-chat 2020-11-03 16:02:41 <@!322926915336011787> you realize that the halcyon class cruiser is considered short for it's length, and **I CAN'T MAKE IT LOOK PERFECT SINCE IM LIMITED TO BLOCKS AND WEDGES**

creations-chat 2020-11-03 16:17:18 dude are you seriously that angry over that
creations-chat 2020-11-03 16:18:21 <@!719168864705052802> I am actually making a rebuild at the moment
