help 2019-12-22 05:44:30 Trying to make this thing hover off the group.  I've tried propellers and helium tanks
bug-reports 2019-12-24 02:04:53 Unless I anchor it first, my design begins accelerating, gaining 2000 sps as it flys up.  I have helium and basalt blocks in my build.
bug-reports 2019-12-24 02:14:29 No, like the helium somehow glitches the my aircraft and it starts going up super fast
bug-reports 2019-12-24 02:14:38 I don't have time to turn on my engines
bug-reports 2019-12-24 02:14:49 Or really do anything, for that matter
bug-reports 2019-12-27 08:55:48 Whenever I use camera and have small propellors, my game crashes
creations-chat 2019-12-28 01:32:30 First mech I made, modeled after a warhammer faction.  It can walk and it's arms have complete freedom
help 2019-12-28 01:36:31 <@456226577798135808> Could I get robotics I?  My build is 145 blocks
