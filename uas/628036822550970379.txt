creations-chat 2021-10-19 01:37:32 any tips on my t80bv? other than the fact its a bit ***wide***
creations-chat 2021-10-19 02:15:17 heres a rear view of my t80 i also added some insignia also anyone know how to make a good dshk the one on mine is a bit ugly
creations-chat 2021-10-19 03:45:32 fixed it and made them a bit bigger and added a bit of detail
creations-chat 2021-10-19 03:51:21 the one on the right was off centered and was 1 block off from the fender so i went back and remade it
creations-chat 2021-10-19 03:59:36 i increased the stiffness so then it wouldnt bounce all the time when ever i stoped
creations-chat 2021-10-20 00:39:33 wut im just posting it in creations
creations-chat 2021-10-24 19:39:50 Mistubish F2 Viper Zero thoughts?
creations-chat 2021-10-24 23:34:21 Mitsubishi F-2 now with 4 Mitsubishi AAM-4 missiles and 2 sidewinders that have no fins bc i have no idea how to add fins onto a sparkler and angle them to 45 degree angle without ruining them
creations-chat 2021-10-25 01:20:50 changing the angle made it look off but i made the camo look better
creations-chat 2021-10-25 01:41:22 fairly close
creations-chat 2021-10-25 01:51:56 its pretty common for someone to call it a sukhoi

creations-chat 2021-10-25 05:57:09 updated F2 from feedback i got rid of the ugly blocky wing camo and motorlocked delta wings to make the wavy camo look much better and look more accurate and i made better canopy frames
creations-chat 2021-10-25 06:03:07 
creations-chat 2021-10-25 06:07:20 prob the dark wavy bit on the main wings it looks like they are to far forward and iv tried fixing it but the only way i can really think how to is change the wings completely of course ill try that later but im a bit tired rn
creations-chat 2021-10-25 17:28:22 finally added fins to my sidewinders and managed to keep them decent looking
creations-chat 2021-10-25 17:51:30 
creations-chat 2021-10-25 18:01:51 just fixed the angle might need to fix the front one as well
creations-chat 2021-10-25 18:13:31 almost perfect now but idk how to make the nose bigger bc theres no 1x2 cone
creations-chat 2021-10-25 21:07:46 hell of a nose job and ended up having to piston lock the nose but looks good

creations-chat 2021-11-01 21:45:35 f2a mitsubishi cockpit interior thoughts or tips? i have no idea how to add the 3rd screen that is between the legs
creations-chat 2021-11-01 21:47:51 
creations-chat 2021-11-08 18:54:34 fix the colors
creations-chat 2021-11-08 18:59:24 these are the colors i recommend the one on the left is 90,90,90 the on in the middle is 161,165,162 the one on the right is 120,120,120 you dont have to use these exact colors
creations-chat 2021-11-08 19:03:47 heres a reference to see the colors a bit better
creations-chat 2021-11-08 19:08:58 now this is just me and my inner perfectionist but maybe blueprint check it
creations-chat 2021-11-08 19:15:29 oh wait just realized its supposed to be a RNoAF F-16 whoops...
creations-chat 2021-11-08 19:18:25 <:hahaa:773727260539617280>
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:01:15 longer
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:05:11 also fix tail placement and shape
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:08:40 i went off nose placement, height of the build, and tried to make sure the lines are exact to the build, unlike yours where the blueprint is inside the build making it look better than it actually is
creations-chat 2021-11-12 00:28:22 at least make it look like the tomb instead of a box with a frame and text
creations-chat 2021-11-14 22:59:20 wip mig 21 thoughts on improvement? (other than the fact its missing a chunk of the jet)
creations-chat 2021-11-15 01:33:27 only real bit of Japanese is the f-2 tail which is just the tail of a f16
