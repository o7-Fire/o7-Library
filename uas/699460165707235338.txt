The Tale of spoxle (699460165707235338)
bug-reports 2021-06-10 05:46:45 I cant shoot rockets (the normal pvp ones) while moving, i have to be completely still. very few other people have had the problem but i want to know if theres any way to fix it, pvp mode is almost unplayable
bug-reports 2021-06-10 19:47:28 i mean i cant shoot my rockets at all, like no matter what, the only thing that works is not moving at all, and that makes the game less fun becuase i like to use things like fighters and tanks, but theyre basically uselless.
help 2021-06-11 00:10:01 every time i reload my save or join another game, my barrel (the sparklers) always rotate, i dont know if theres any way to fix it but if there is please tell me.

creations-chat 2021-06-24 10:22:37 ur looking at the longer versions, theres ones where theyre more stubby and the back is taller <@!200793484053970944> lemme just wait a few hours to speak again AHEM RICKJE
creations-chat 2021-06-24 10:25:41 -the one i used along with some more all i searched up was gustav gun and used the stubbier ones, and if you were corrected just accept it i dont want to start a big argument, and so what if i dont have the same amount of motor lock as a girl has makeup on her face
creations-chat 2021-06-24 10:29:28 am i supposed to have an individual angle lock for each wheel? or just make it smaller? and brb gimme like 15 mins
creations-chat 2021-06-24 11:26:55 anyone know what i should do for the wheel covers/armor, theres 2 main designs but im not sure how do do either, if ur willing to give me an example just search gustav gun on google
