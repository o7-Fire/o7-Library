help 2023-04-09 01:23:44 yo anyone can guide me with single rotor heli
help 2023-04-09 01:43:55 hmm not sure cuz i used propeller
help 2023-04-09 01:43:59 and its prob called fake rotor
help 2023-04-09 01:47:02 i see
help 2023-04-09 01:50:27 hmm i should prob try the basic ones and not too advanced, appreciate the reply though
help 2023-04-09 01:51:38 oh there's this tutorial ive been following
help 2023-04-09 01:51:39 let me check
help 2023-04-09 01:52:35 well more to experimenting
help 2023-04-09 01:52:48 i quite like the single rotor but im too new for that
help 2023-04-09 01:53:48 yeah, well balancing the weight get my head blown off
help 2023-04-09 01:56:36 oh yeah i started with one of these
help 2023-04-09 01:58:43 i mean i get how the heli would be able to hover and stuff but dang its hard to actually get it to function properly
help 2023-04-09 01:59:21 plus he used the motor locking in one of his build
help 2023-04-09 01:59:45 but im not sure if its needed for a basic heli
help 2023-04-09 02:00:58 learned to do motor locking few days ago
help 2023-04-09 02:01:02 not angle locking tho
help 2023-04-09 02:04:03 not sure if the designs will affect the weight of the heli, but im still in the experimenting phase
help 2023-04-09 02:04:58 ah yeah, thanks
