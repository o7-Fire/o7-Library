creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:15:03 In plane crazy I kinda enjoy doing plane crash and rescue roleplays with my friends in our WW2 vehicles, anyway, I hate it when I go to bailout and get flung into the next galaxy over. The creators need to fix parachutes I. That game.
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:17:11 <@!664158287800958978>  those things are paper thin, at least the one you built is, so taking a front view pic isn’t gonna work, we need a top and bottom pic, and maybe a parked with landing gears out pic.  Much better
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:19:53 I made my I-15 be able to look like it’s on fire and it has a oil leak simulator thing, I also made some parts of the plane disconnectable for fire damage and when the plane is being shot at.

creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:33:18 <@!421068077556301844>  constructive criticism here but it’s a little blocky, I think that’s where those down votes came from other than that it’s fine
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:38:35 Like a little roundedness around the air scoop
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:45:30 Well it doesn’t have feet on the back so no
creations-chat 2021-02-24 21:47:41 It’s perfectly fine, and presentable, and yes I know he/she meant “feed back” not “feet back”
creations-chat 2021-02-24 23:36:30 Yes
creations-chat 2021-02-25 00:12:22 Thank you
creations-chat 2021-02-25 12:58:50 1524 Blocks
creations-chat 2021-02-25 13:00:53 1524 blocks. It’s a Zeppelin Staaken VI, no I doesn’t have any bombs on it because I didn’t put any on it.
creations-chat 2021-02-25 13:03:11 Here is one of the images I used to make the vehicle
creations-chat 2021-02-25 13:06:42 It’s based off a real plane but yes it is custom
creations-chat 2021-02-25 19:23:21 I have a question. Can the cannon actually move the way you built it?
creations-chat 2021-02-25 19:34:48 Motor lock?
creations-chat 2021-02-25 19:50:21 What does it look like despawned? I’m just curious because it looks so nice
creations-chat 2021-02-25 20:02:07 <@456226577798135808>   https://youtube.com/watch?v=YuedQFH8wZI&feature=share         Yes I know it’s not a Concorde but still
creations-chat 2021-02-25 20:15:06 Wow very cool
creations-chat 2021-02-25 20:34:58 Yea
creations-chat 2021-02-26 02:53:31 Wait does it look like on the outside before being spawned, or is all the motor locks on the inside not affecting the outside look? Also finally a normal question, how many blocks is that?

creations-chat 2021-03-10 14:57:46 I’m not done but here is my T-72 turret
creations-chat 2021-03-10 14:59:54 I was building it last night then decided to go to bed. And yes <@!422347528688762880> I realized my mistake after I posted that!I have been slowmoded!
creations-chat 2021-03-10 18:05:44 A T-72 turret is round, with or without the excess armor
creations-chat 2021-03-10 18:07:47 Amogus
creations-chat 2021-03-19 16:32:41 <@!456899920616620052> For the body color other than the red I recommend using 180 180 180 or lower for darker color or use mixing to add a texture type look!
