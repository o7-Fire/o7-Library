creations-chat 2022-01-04 09:23:55 Mmm decent tank
creations-chat 2022-01-05 09:16:51 <@796708501816213524> the camo looks pain to look at maybe make the colors warmer and less intense
Looks f i n e for a mini jet build could be less blocky doe
creations-chat 2022-01-05 09:20:46 Not bad for a first mech lol mine was a minecraft steve and it was bad like real bad

creations-chat 2022-01-05 09:25:43 Hmm i think i might need to repaint some of my su-33 now cuz that picture u sent makes me wanna repaint the engines
creations-chat 2022-01-05 09:27:45 Too wide lol needs to be longer ish and prob needs to be moved a lil to the front
I know its not easy to make the little details for mini builds so yeah
U could do a ridiculous amount of motor lock but it wont be worth the time
