help 2023-01-31 15:57:04 Ok so I have a problem with angle motor locking. I’m using springs for the motorlock tower. Whenever I try turning the motor used to angle without any other blocks attached to it works well just like it’s supposed to, but if I add any blocks to the motor, it just decides to not turn at all.
help 2023-01-31 15:58:36 The half wedge beam I used for testing is only attached to the motor despite not looking like that
help 2023-01-31 18:39:48 I already tried rotating it 180° so the brownish part is facing the motorlock but it leads to the same result

help 2023-01-31 18:50:13 Even tho on the second one it seems that it can’t turn due to the half block, it doesn’t even try to unlike the first

Let it pass mane
creations-chat 2023-06-29 17:40:20 My human realizes that the building system in general of Plane Crazy is dipshit 

ngl in my case I still haven’t moved from pc because I main mobile and no other game other than this one has good mobile support and to an extent it’s over complicated.

I feel like the reason those perhaps 30k people in total still hasn’t moved out of this or babft is because their building system is friendlier to the younger audience, aka most people that play those two games and to people who just don’t wanna take a insufferable amount of hours to build something

creations-chat 2023-07-03 21:08:58 I mean, you also are an ass considering you were the one who exploded all of this talk, but anyway.

Also I didn’t understood well what you said so I guess it is for feedback 

Wings: on your f-22 they look like that one swedish fighter from the Cold War, it just doesn’t look like a f-22 and it got half blocks on the tips. I’ll recommend using a 3-D model for builds intended for be realistic or in reference to a real life plane.

Vertical stabilizers: can they even move? 

Engines: it just doesn’t look like there is a engine there, even less it doesn’t look like a f-22 engine. 

For plane to suggest, I’ll go for the J-35 Draken
creations-chat 2023-07-03 21:47:00 <@342662955575410690> like that one man said, the j-35 isn’t a prototype
