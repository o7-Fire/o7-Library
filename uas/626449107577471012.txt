bot-central 2021-04-20 18:12:58 Kick players
GAMEPLAY

The players in the (plane crazy roblox game) server will be able to kick other players if the majority vote by a percentage of the people in the server (like phantom forces) there will also be a cool down (maybe 10 mins) so it doesnt get abused, and maybe the option will be in settings (if you can fit it) it will have a drop down list of all the names in the server and it will have a text box that you can put the reason (to tell the server why they should be kicked) in and a red button that says kick and once you put a reason and selected the player a popup would come show on the screen top left next to the chat bar and you can click yes or no and if the majority of the players vote yes the player will be kicked
**what it would help**
shredder bugs dominating PvP
lag machines
toxic players
racist people 
spammers 
pretty much anyone the people in the server dont like 

it would also prove handy in PR servers

Cringy story makes you seem unde. (Why people are downvoting)
Just get rid of the text and don’t give it a cheesy name then you will not get as many downvotes
creations-chat 2022-04-01 23:28:47 <@!376049059695165440> the elivators and vertical stabiliser look very disproportionate with the rest of the plane also you could make custom jets for the wings (use a motor) 
To add to my first point make the elivators the same thickness as the wings or they get overlooked in a glance
creations-chat 2022-04-03 10:03:41 make the base colour darker - add random details such as interlatching trails to fill the dead space - use different gradient wedges to make it look less liek a chease wedge
creations-chat 2022-04-04 20:13:38 it hinders the ailerons if i do that making a non functional build
creations-chat 2022-04-04 20:32:49 I want to keep it simple enough for a tutorial - people ain’t guna want to start angle locking - also with the gaps in the wings the rotating wing panels they get stuck on the rest of the wings, I want to make a sturdy tutorial that ain’t guna piss people off cos it keeps falling out the sky and will stop watching my tuts
creations-chat 2022-04-04 20:36:46 But it’s no point in making it needlessly complicated to prove a point they will just stop watching - if you want a bigger following you gotta get in touch and know what it’s like for your followers - they don’t want needlessly complicated builds ( if u want to carry this on go to <#384021699466756107> so we don’t have this stupid slow mode)
