creations-chat 2021-04-06 11:32:42 1. I fixed the missiles
2. I made cockpit a bit better
3. The paint job is perfect in my opinion so I did not change it
4.There are alot of sharp bits because I like that look and if you are talking about the cone thing then I dont know how to make it smoother
5.Cheese grater cool

creations-chat 2022-04-04 01:36:24 Yeah sure but I‚Äôm on I pad and I don‚Äôt really know how to use plane crazy on it, but I‚Äôll tell you this, use bogey wheels, like a lot in the front of my engine the first 2 wheels are bogeys and freely rotate as if like another engine, I also have 4 cylinders freely rotating under my engine, basically the normal way to make engines and making the cylinders that ‚Äúweld‚Äù the engine to the track freely rotate as a group of 4
