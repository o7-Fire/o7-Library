creations-chat 2022-08-22 20:50:01 why do you keep yelling about builds and their ratio, like with all due respect nobody asked
creations-chat 2022-08-22 20:53:28 m8 that good jet build was posted SEVERAL HOURS after the engine and even more after the panzer 3. it takes time for the ratio to change and there's also fluxuations with how many new people there are.
Just think for a bit before complaining please
creations-chat 2022-08-22 20:56:40 what about the purple plane with the bocky tail? that's not a correct ratio?
even though there's problems and it can look bad people can still like the build for it's concept or just for trying to build it
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:13:19 I'm trying to make a point that the voting system for creations is not concrete at all, the amount of people change, and the things that people like change. so comparing the ratio of a 'good jet' that was posted recently to that of a 'bad tank' that was posted at 3 in the morning isn't really the best when complaining about quality and the ratio they deserve
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:18:52 well so be it.
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:22:35 we know the tank looks bad, we know it has a bunch of upvotes, just get over it.
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:38:48 wonder when he'll stop complaining abut the panzer 3
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:41:37 just salty that a build doesn't have the exact ratio you want it to have
creations-chat 2022-08-22 21:45:27 still not just to be constantly berating some guys first build

bot-central 2022-08-31 15:45:40 damm i forget the suggestion command
bot-central 2022-08-31 15:50:19 $suggest
[camera hud]
[configurable]

It would essentially mix a sign block into the camera block, giving the camera a config to write text in for making a hud. would make some things easier.
bot-central 2022-08-31 15:50:41 it didn't work <:nooo:787097964946259978>
bot-central 2022-08-31 15:51:01 whatever  the suggestion is stupid anyway

Can't be removed, moved, or anything, stays when nobody's in the plot. It's been there for like 3 days at least.
