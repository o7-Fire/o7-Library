bug-reports 2019-10-15 06:14:04 It is motor2 it can be fixed by placing anchor blocks tho
bug-reports 2019-10-15 06:14:46 only happens on big builds like ships
bug-reports 2019-10-15 06:16:14 np
bug-reports 2019-10-15 06:16:40 Seems to only be an issue as you press play and its loading your build so using anchor blocks stops it and you can just turn them off and everythings fine
bug-reports 2019-10-15 06:20:19 it didnt?
bug-reports 2019-10-15 06:20:28 try toggling the motor2's
bug-reports 2019-10-15 06:20:48 hmmm
bug-reports 2019-10-15 06:20:59 What are the configs on it
bug-reports 2019-10-15 06:21:06 Maybe you have the torque too high
bug-reports 2019-10-15 06:30:23 im 100% sure its motor2
bug-reports 2019-10-15 06:30:30 try remove them all and seeing if that works
bug-reports 2019-10-15 06:30:35 I only got the problem after i put them on my ship
bug-reports 2019-10-15 07:56:32 It will still do it if it’s on toggle and all settings are on 0
bug-reports 2019-10-15 07:56:54 But as you spawn your build there’s a brief moment it follows your cursor anyway
bug-reports 2019-10-15 22:15:18 Nah its broken
bug-reports 2019-10-15 22:15:28 you gotta hop through hoops to stop it from breaking some times
bug-reports 2019-10-17 23:42:21 Anybody else having odd issues with regular motors? like flinging and them not wanting to work some times but work perfectly fine other times with no changes?
bug-reports 2019-10-17 23:45:55 Nvm i found the problem
