creations-chat 2019-09-12 20:46:06 still figuring out how to get it in the air, the blue and yellow spheres arent very close together and that kinda oofs my build
creations-chat 2019-09-12 20:46:26 though i think having the wings bend down a bit sorta helps
creations-chat 2019-09-12 20:46:50 and the second photo is when i removed the single rudder and added two to the tips of the elevator wings
creations-chat 2019-09-12 20:46:56 also to try to help xd

creations-chat 2021-07-11 00:12:05 shredder bugs are a cancerous growth that will never die
creations-chat 2021-07-11 00:14:53 maybe next time build something other than a shredder and people might actually like what you make

imagine being unable to handle any sort of criticism whatsoever when you literally post your creation in a place where you can and will receive criticism
creations-chat 2021-07-11 00:18:16 yeah everyone here is definitely racist for giving you criticism

look bro if u cant handle this then dont post at all ez as that

uh oh death threats? sounds like someones not right in the head
creations-chat 2021-07-11 00:21:48 the adurite man has some serious anger issues to be getting this mad over people not liking his shredder bug build
