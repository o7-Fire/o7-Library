the-dump 2022-06-05 12:40:22 go outside, touch grass
the-dump 2022-06-05 12:40:58 the issue that i have with pride month are the corporations who pretend to support it
the-dump 2022-06-05 12:41:28 they follow the money

the-dump 2022-06-05 12:45:01 treat them like people, not celebrities
the-dump 2022-06-05 12:45:25 the issue that they had 70 some-odd years ago is that people didn't acknowledge the fact that they were real
the-dump 2022-06-05 12:45:57 so why don't we just drop the whole pride month thing and treat them like an average person
