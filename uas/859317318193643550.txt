creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:40:23 If it's good enough for you it's good enough. And personally I think it's cool
creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:42:47 And you are the reason people stop playing. You make them feel bad about their builds and  ot want to improve because they only get rude negative feedback. Maybe try being polite
creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:46:55 I said good enough not good. Good enough implies that there is room for improvement but it still isn't bad. And there's a difference between being rude and encouraging someone
creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:52:11 I did not give criticism because that build is better than a few of my builds so I have no room to speak. I was voicing my opinion in a way that implied there was still room for improvement. Being rude isn't criticism it's just disrespect. Now I'm gonna go do something productive instead of bullying whitenames because there build isn't what I am used to seeing
creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:54:14 Doesn't mean I can't actually be respectful and that I shouldn't notice and talk about someone being rude. This isn't worth arguing about anyway
creations-chat 2022-10-29 23:56:16 It is. Not between us though. You haven't done anything I just forgot I was replying to you specifically because I have a rough brain cell count of absolutely none

the-dump 2023-04-06 05:13:06 Well
the-dump 2023-04-06 05:13:21 That's because I had to interact with you
the-dump 2023-04-06 05:13:36 And the universe needed to cancel out ur stupidity
the-dump 2023-04-06 05:13:44 So it took some of my intelligence

the-dump 2023-04-06 05:24:42 I don't own thigh highs
the-dump 2023-04-06 05:25:12 Because that's a stereotype of femboys
the-dump 2023-04-06 05:28:06 What about hiking socks
the-dump 2023-04-06 05:28:12 They're comfortable
the-dump 2023-04-06 05:28:19 Unless you get sand in them
the-dump 2023-04-06 05:28:50 They're like regular socks but big, thick and soft
the-dump 2023-04-06 05:29:09 The biggest I have go a little bit above my ankle
the-dump 2023-04-06 05:30:32 No. They're much shorter
the-dump 2023-04-06 05:30:39 And for rugged terrain
the-dump 2023-04-06 05:31:57 I like boots
the-dump 2023-04-06 05:32:09 They're good because they don't let pebbles in my shoes
the-dump 2023-04-06 05:33:35 I have a hole on the side where the elastic material meets the rest of the boot
the-dump 2023-04-06 05:34:49 Damn

Not bad but the engines look a lil funky. If u want I could teach you how to make some better ones (I'mma do some testing first so that I don't waste ur time. That's even if u want to)
creations-chat 2023-06-16 05:46:59 I'm building a smaller corsair and I'm using angle locking to make a nice engine
creations-chat 2023-06-16 05:49:10 I learnt it pretty early. It's really not hard. If u need help I would recommend yt tutorials or someday if u want I might be able to teach u

It's not bad but it's a little bit blocky. Especially for a less experienced player it's not bad at all
creations-chat 2023-06-29 21:23:52 I recommend that for  the shape you go onto sketch fab and search for a 3d model. You don't have to buy it but just view it (they're free to view)
