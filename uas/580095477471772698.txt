the-dump 2021-02-03 07:01:25 also if you think about no updates it makes sense why

creations-chat 2021-03-10 09:08:47 i've been building this for a long time now but i never shared it here for feedback so what can i do to improve this model or is it good enough?(im colouring it)
creations-chat 2021-03-10 09:12:59 perhaps they couldn't handle a warn
creations-chat 2021-03-11 11:24:56 <@!484529511468236802>  maybe use this colour for the blades?
creations-chat 2021-03-11 11:27:36 im in school rn so i can't
creations-chat 2021-03-11 11:32:49 maybe this?
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:21:06 15k its a straight up ship
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:23:40 i use it in expert server 2 because there would be noone there
it freezes for a solid 5 secs when spawned
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:26:20 using lagy stuff in public servers is not good for other people and you
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:28:46 <@!712358550097231934>  is the reason for downvote the comically big cannon or something else?
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:31:44 <@!782361431726620733>  maybe put some trails behind the engines to make the afterburner more realistic?
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:34:42 im just giving them ideas saying "start over" doesn't change anything they will come with the same detail
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:38:31 i would say kinda because everywhere i go no matter what my opinion is i get "ok and" or " <:sus:805543105428193301> "
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:41:00 nice letters you got there
i believe you person under me
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:44:02 but its not the same, the one block inside is probably different
creations-chat 2021-03-13 12:46:04 im joking
creations-chat 2021-03-14 06:08:46 ^looks good
what can i improve on this because i see downvotes
creations-chat 2021-03-14 06:11:31 tbh the gun is comically big for the size of the vehicle
creations-chat 2021-03-14 09:19:34 i didn't get the upvotes i thought i would get so im gonna make a new outside for the walls, texture it a bit more(camouflage, armour exc) and make it even older
is there anything else i should change on this?
creations-chat 2021-03-14 09:42:35 just started working on it but thanks for the feedback
creations-chat 2021-03-14 09:46:59 c130 has the most custom angles in planes if you ask me
creations-chat 2021-03-14 09:49:25 im having alot of problems right now
creations-chat 2021-03-14 09:51:44 i need motorlock and i am having problems finding a place to steal from myself
creations-chat 2021-03-14 09:55:46 it doesn't really matter if its glass or not because you can't really see inside from outside anyway and only thing that matters when putting something in creations is look
creations-chat 2021-03-14 10:00:40 yes alot of people know that, it just looks cool thats why they build it
creations-chat 2021-03-14 10:03:27 i love how you started the conversation
creations-chat 2021-03-14 10:15:21 ~~make it 1:1~~
creations-chat 2021-03-14 10:41:39 you were right its already looking better
creations-chat 2021-03-14 10:48:26 i have almost no space left and it is one plot
there are cranes inside of barrels, wheels inside of floors
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:08:51 foodback
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:11:09 because of the ridiculous size of the gun i can just imagine people like this
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:13:18 i wanted to create a big artilery moving thing and i got inspired by p1500 should i name it something different?
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:15:19 lmao
i was gonna make it 5 meter diameter and add more stuff but someone in a different server wanted it to be 10 meter diameter so i did that
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:17:25 ik but it would have been a bit more realistic considering the size of the vehicle
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:20:44 if i would be real i continued to build it because it was just so ridiculous
should i send this in the creations or should i add more detail?
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:31:11 big guns are getting a trend today
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:38:32 yes the gun is a bit massive
if i will ever remake this i will either make the vehicle itself bigger or make the gun smaller
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:43:19 the reason i am putting the gun to the back of the to do list is gun parts are almost inside of each other which makes it hard to colour or detail but i'll do it
creations-chat 2021-03-15 13:46:22 yes 80 hours of work is not enough
creations-chat 2021-03-16 07:58:42 engines are exposed
creations-chat 2021-03-16 08:07:11 i am talking about these ones btw the back ones look good
creations-chat 2021-03-18 06:26:04 "detail"
creations-chat 2021-03-18 06:28:47 you could mearial some of the stuff so it would look like it has more work put into it

creations-chat 2021-03-19 15:04:55 should i make these sand parts darker?
creations-chat 2021-03-19 15:17:33 you were right its already looking better
creations-chat 2021-03-19 15:32:05 i got inspired by it so i actually wrote p1500 on the other side but because some people said i should change it, it is not existing p1700 now
creations-chat 2021-03-19 15:34:25 its a bit short but i don't think you can do anything about that now
creations-chat 2021-03-19 15:41:33 because someone wanted it to be and also it makes the thing even larger and it looks ridiculous
creations-chat 2021-03-19 15:46:09 also i learned smoke stops moving when you are not looking at it while making this
creations-chat 2021-03-19 15:50:57 nice
creations-chat 2021-03-19 16:24:10 how do you make that?
creations-chat 2021-03-19 16:33:47 now that is already more than enough detail
creations-chat 2021-03-19 16:41:05 ^perhaps thats why they suggested that
it looked a bit dull so i decided to write something and someone responded with achtung panzer so i decided to write that because it sounds cool
creations-chat 2021-03-19 16:45:23 grammar is nice
creations-chat 2021-03-19 16:48:06 achtung panzer barely fits there and i am almost out of motors so i can't extend it
also i don't really like the swear words if i am honest
creations-chat 2021-03-19 16:52:10 i don't think that fits the vibe of ww2
creations-chat 2021-03-20 12:16:26 i think black and green looks good
creations-chat 2021-03-20 12:18:52 foodback should i change this wall texture to a mix of something else

creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:13:45 if you are talking about cooling stuff it already has fans(this is an old photo)
creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:16:35 i am not saying this to get away with not putting it but what im trying to create here is an old ww2 landkreuzer
and i don't think thats an old thing used in wars
creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:19:11 ww2 started in 1939 ended in 1945, honda was founded in 1948
i don't think honda can time travel
creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:21:20 those are there to cool the engine not the gun
creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:29:27 yes it does work(old photo)
creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:37:04 im done for today but i need to colour inside of the barrel and some bits where the gun sits
im gonna do it tomorrow
creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:40:18 can you send it here or dm me?
creations-chat 2021-03-21 17:45:16 ikr almost out of them, i am surprised they managed to finish the build
creations-chat 2021-03-22 14:41:46 nice i accidentally pressed enter
creations-chat 2021-03-22 14:44:37 so i did what i wanted to do with this creations, if feedback says nothing more to add i'll be sending this in about 5 hours
creations-chat 2021-03-22 14:49:18 i got inspired by p1500 because i wanted to create some big artilery gun, but it looked small so i maked it bigger(theres no blueprint or name for it)

theres already crates its just big
creations-chat 2021-03-22 15:12:06 ammo are just inside of the barrel, the back opens but i never took the time to release the ammo from the barrel because it takes a solid 15 mins for it to slide down
perhaps i should do it, something could be broke
creations-chat 2021-03-22 15:14:26 somethings broke, i got something to do yay
creations-chat 2021-03-22 15:19:25 i just realized i did not colour the inside of this but you reload it by opening the back
creations-chat 2021-03-22 15:28:00 heres also one of the ammo out
creations-chat 2021-03-22 15:30:00 right

creations-chat 2021-03-22 17:27:44 <@!527653676022628353> whats wrong with the creation
well it kinda ruins it but theres nothing i can do about that because i realised i did the gun too big when i was halfway done 
atleast you have a reason and im happy with that
creations-chat 2021-03-22 17:30:52 well the gun took me about 50 hours or so because of all the walls and floors everywhere and the folding stuff

creations-chat 2021-03-22 19:41:21 they look better for me

creations-chat 2021-03-30 07:07:56 you can always put walls closer together to make more space
with that way you can get a plot wide-4/5 blocks and 2.5 plots long builds easily

creations-chat 2022-01-06 18:07:51 afterburner(the trail part) seems odd, the colouring is very boxy, wings have holes in them, wings do not go infront of the intakes, needs more smoothing overall

also can you people please stop with "all of it" we know it looks bad you are not helping

<@!707953054489509978> just please, this channel is already in shambles don't make it even worse

creations-chat 2022-01-18 11:37:25 what i suggest doing when starting a build is no matter what hide all your locks when you put them, if you don't hide one you might need to rebuild an entire section or make it overcomplicated Just to hide that one lock

creations-chat 2022-01-24 12:27:41 next time you build a jet try to make the hull so it doesn't have your arms sticking out of the walls

for this build add some weapons like missiles and bombs, if you can give the back landing gears a little more angle towards the wings it could make it look much cooler, if you are gonna post it in creations add details with signs trails and such

creations-chat 2022-01-30 20:22:29 just because of the "configure to edit" im giving it a downvote, it takes like 30 seconds to change it
creations-chat 2022-01-30 20:27:15 i mean the fact that they don't change that one thing so obvious before posting it into creations tells me they don't even care about the build

don't get me wrong the build is beautiful and very well done

creations-chat 2022-02-02 08:52:36 next time you build one try to not make the arm stick out but it is too late for this one as it is near complete, put signs next to the explosives so the "explosives" text is gone, try to get rid of these 2 motors(image below),  make the afterburner a bit longer, motorlock another rocket infront or behind this rocket so it is longer which would look better(image below)

but it is a good jet, i like it

it is good

creations-chat 2022-02-09 14:41:37 here is an advice: if you are fairly new to plane crazy ask for feedback in <#384021699466756107>  because as i see it people are nicer there, when you are building stuff that is becoming really complex post it here

people assume everyone is trying to get in hof here

also im gonna be honest i almost never ask feedback here, i just go with what my mind is telling me and it is usually faster

creations-chat 2022-02-17 18:14:13 <@!595671478666657802> good looking plane, i like the shape and all but you made the windows too bright making the build look worse by getting the attention to windows only. the missiles look a bit wonky, you could make custom ones but that is up to you. there are no details which is probably the main reason it is gonna get a lot of downvotes ( by details i mean signs saying random stuff and random numbers vehicles seem to have on them, specially military ones. the weird sticking out parts they seem to have exc. )

overall i say it is fine but can be improved

creations-chat 2022-02-18 14:22:52 i don't know how i can give feedback to that as the back looks almost nothing like the real one, no offense. maybe try using wedges and stuff to get the shape going?

creations-chat 2022-03-09 19:24:33 so, im going to add another long boi next to this but as of rn there are three accounts, one is the front one is the middle and the other the back. Im trying to make a moving artilery gun. Is there anything i should change before moving on?(i didn't open all 3 at once yet that's why there are 2 different pictures)
creations-chat 2022-03-09 19:26:37 looks neat, small but fancy
creations-chat 2022-03-09 19:33:15 try using darker colours, they blend in with the other grey parts and use some rough material like slate or fabric
creations-chat 2022-03-09 19:35:18 wait how did i not notice that, im blind
creations-chat 2022-03-09 19:37:32 sick
creations-chat 2022-03-09 19:41:38 it is not that bad honestly
creations-chat 2022-03-09 19:44:04 it is a good build in my standards but you can have a different opinion about it, i think it is shaped fairly good not making it look like random wedges hardly resembling even a car
creations-chat 2022-03-09 19:53:34 it is a place to chat, to find some peace...
hopefully
creations-chat 2022-03-09 20:18:09 rip to that person anyways moving on
creations-chat 2022-03-11 16:10:16 im guessing that is one block wide, you can either make it wider or make it shorter, it looks a tad bit too tall
creations-chat 2022-03-11 16:16:32 they are trying their best and that is all that matters
creations-chat 2022-03-11 16:24:18 idk about the colour but you could add some text on the drone for some detail, like the "WARNING" or those long texts, batteries for some reason always have them <@!791000572286992435>
creations-chat 2022-03-11 16:31:41 <@!780574146919792700>  <@!714878625484243101>  you people are not helping.
<@456226577798135808> you could cover the bomb with half blocks so the explosives are not visible. It needs some paint, even the simplest paint design would help a ton. One of the planes have a engine on the back side, they usually don't have that. If you put that for speed just hide one inside the hull. the wings could use some work, they need to be wider (i think), it would help a lot if you gave a top down view of both of them. The overall shape of the hull would be really hard to change so i would suggest trying to do another one but you can still improve the ones you built.

im guessing you just started playing so this is a good plane for starting out.
creations-chat 2022-03-11 16:34:33 this.
you need to say this.

You know how the game works, you played it a lot and have more experience so stop trying get people out of the game by calling their builds bad or telling them to rebuild.
creations-chat 2022-03-11 16:38:26 <@!714878625484243101> i would suggest just not making it worse if you can't help, sorry if that sounded rude.

also <@!738064035135750224>  that is a beautiful build, only thing i would suggest is next time try making it more round

ah i see

creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:31:34 what is happening
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:33:37 i have no idea what is the argument but i agree with hars, no one will gain anything or care after this argument
creations-chat 2022-03-12 11:41:36 the wings have holes in them. (im guessing you are the creator of the build) you tried to make a camo but the blocky texture makes it looks worse, if you can't do smooth ones with wedges and motorlock stick with one colour paints. Some parts can be smoother but i will understand if you don't want to do that, it takes a lot of time and most of the time not worth it if you are not going for hof build. the glass could be a darker colour, planes usually don't have a white window. The intakes seem to be too small, for me at least.

Overall i like the build but it could be improved.

creations-chat 2022-03-24 18:00:49 oh hey that is really cool, take my upvote
creations-chat 2022-03-24 18:29:07 :(
creations-chat 2022-04-02 13:47:17 a lovely shrimp, truly a shrimp
bug-reports 2022-04-02 13:52:54 robox is having problems right now, i suggest waiting for it to be solved

creations-chat 2022-04-02 15:35:30 can't upvote, this is sad day
bug-reports 2022-04-02 15:37:26 roblox is having problems
bug-reports 2022-04-02 15:37:41 not a game thing as far as im aware
creations-chat 2022-04-02 17:41:33 you have nailed the wheels
creations-chat 2022-04-02 21:21:53 Well they can, there is no problem with that
creations-chat 2022-04-02 21:24:20 well if they said it is better because it has a lot of motorlock we call them by technical terms "idiots", it is a different story if they mean the detail when spawned

alr, i Just wanted to write one sentence rather than 10 messages
creations-chat 2022-04-03 08:56:03 i don't have a problem with it, it is better than some other builds in creations so it deserves an upvote
creations-chat 2022-04-03 09:01:54 i agree with that
creations-chat 2022-04-04 19:36:43 giant stuff are much better no matter if it is an aircraft a tank or whatever else it can be
i agree
creations-chat 2022-04-04 19:41:20 i do understand that but you can make large builds look better, don't get me wrong roscales look amazing and has a lot of attention to it but it can only go to a certain extend before it is over detailed or it is nothing like the build before

i meant it as "to the point where it is just bad"

i don't have an example tbh, i didn't see anyone cross that line yet but they always end up in the same detail or a little lower
creations-chat 2022-04-05 16:36:10 i never thought of adding chains on my builds, this gives me good ideas
creations-chat 2022-04-05 16:39:36 listen to hars if you are trying to get in hof, otherwise they are not going to help

i have no clue, i just came in to say "good chains" <@!809781295500099584>
creations-chat 2022-04-05 16:59:05 i mean i didn't get an expert terrain specialist because i was not proud of the build, i have the votes but it doesn't feel right
bot-central 2022-04-17 11:19:26 -servers
creations-chat 2022-04-23 14:56:48 put a block where the motor needs to stop, there is no way to edit the motor
creations-chat 2022-04-23 14:59:36 i don't see a problem. it is going to be flying anyways, not a car
i don't care about the gears much while building jets, i just put the 1x2 ones and it works
creations-chat 2022-04-23 15:01:50 yeah, just fix the other stuff and if it bugs you a lot in the end fix it
creations-chat 2022-04-23 15:04:33 you should probably edit the 2 pictures out
creations-chat 2022-04-24 08:06:41 ok that is just awesome
creations-chat 2022-04-25 17:31:26 i should just leave this server to be honest, there are so many 9 year olds trying to sound smart or raging on people because they got nothing to do in their so called lifes.
And now im guessing they are going to tell me "oh im 15/17/19/14 lol what are you on about? "
creations-chat 2022-04-26 19:31:58 i think you can improve on the bridge, the hull looks solid and good but the windows look blocky, you could use wings and piston lock to give it some better "sticks"

You are the one that built the triple e right?

The windows on the bridge have blocks in the middle to seperate them which makes it look bad. You can instead pistonlock wings in the middle. Wings are much thinner and look a thousand times better
creations-chat 2022-04-26 19:38:10 im right now on Phone i can't, you can ask others to help with that
creations-chat 2022-05-01 13:46:12 getting into hall of fame is just a fun challange, if you want to you can put the effort and time
creations-chat 2022-05-01 13:49:01 if the build it big enough people can't even see the details clearly so you can do whatever you want without worrying about it much, for example this
creations-chat 2022-05-01 13:52:02 standards didn't change much honestly, people did get better at building but you can still enter hof with 2020s standards
creations-chat 2022-05-01 13:53:54 yes
creations-chat 2022-05-01 13:57:30 i do agree you need a lot of skill to get in hof but it is still possible without the skill, you just need to go nuts with whatever you are making
making a building? make it five buildings
making a tank? make a giant one instead
exc.
creations-chat 2022-05-02 14:34:13 people are toxic in here to newbies, i suggest just not being around here

even better just get out, they don't even give advice
creations-chat 2022-05-02 14:37:09 that should be a thing in every community but that shouldn't mean "you have to be toxic to newbies"
creations-chat 2022-05-02 14:54:59 very cool build
creations-chat 2022-05-02 15:07:26 it just got posted
creations-chat 2022-05-02 15:12:17 after a day you can judge it, right now you just have to wait
creations-chat 2022-05-03 09:02:54 probably was the best for them to leave if they couldn't handle it
creations-chat 2022-05-03 15:01:44 <@410455661814480896> can you tell me the problem so i can fix it on future builds?
creations-chat 2022-05-03 15:11:00 you are really not helping here
creations-chat 2022-05-03 16:49:28 alr i will try to make the nose and the windows better next time i build a jet or anything in those lines.
Just be more polite next time
creations-chat 2022-05-04 07:00:43 after building with motorlock a lot you start to see it instantly if one is outside the build
creations-chat 2022-05-04 07:18:26 dude 2ypes just pointed out a flaw, it is not that a big deal
<@456226577798135808> this tpurple person is trying to prove that 2ypes is wrong for pointing out an obvious flaw
creations-chat 2022-05-04 07:26:13 yay it is back to normal
creations-chat 2022-05-04 07:28:04 i mean you didn't start the argument, why should you get muted?
bug-reports 2022-05-04 12:07:20 is this an old screenshot or did you take it just now?
bug-reports 2022-05-04 12:07:53 roblox is having problems right now, i suggest not joining any games
creations-chat 2022-05-04 16:50:56 Hars is the best person to judge you if you are going for hof, they see trough everything
creations-chat 2022-05-04 17:46:24 yeah almost like they need to learn and take their time with some builds and have breaks you know?
bug-reports 2022-05-04 19:35:05 i noticed but thanks for letting me know
creations-chat 2022-05-05 11:54:47 very nice
creations-chat 2022-05-05 12:01:03 Are you just spamming them for fun or actually building something
creations-chat 2022-05-06 14:42:24 it could be a real build, the normal base has conveyer belts behind it also you can see the blue trails

could just be photoshopped too idk
creations-chat 2022-05-06 14:49:33 i think yousuf did a mistake then, they have blacklist now
creations-chat 2022-05-06 16:27:27 ~~the build is way too good~~ the real thing is way too simple

it is original unlike most of creations
creations-chat 2022-05-06 18:36:31 i have to agree with you on that
creations-chat 2022-05-06 19:29:17 giving feedback to someone changes with how long that person has been playing this game and how good is their skill
you can't treat a week old player like you treat someone trying to enter hof. you can't just point out things and expect a week old player to fix it, you have to explain them how to fix it.

<@738064035135750224> thank you too for the compliment!
creations-chat 2022-05-06 19:34:18 good for you. you can give good feedback to experienced people if they take it seriously or not but not the new ones
creations-chat 2022-05-06 20:01:48 and can't upvote great
help 2022-05-07 08:45:53 there is no way to fix it at the moment
creations-chat 2022-05-08 13:26:41 i do like the tank but can they Just stop reposting it, we get that it looks good we saw it already
creations-chat 2022-05-09 14:21:37 you could cover the holes in your wings by motorlocking some wing panels, you would need to balance the plane again but it would look better. the colours seem too light, try darker tons of them. you can use trails to make some good afterburners but it is not necessary. maybe add missiles and bombs under the wings but that is up to you
creations-chat 2022-05-12 20:16:18 jesus that is complicated
creations-chat 2022-05-14 21:52:23 when that one motorlock clips with a normal motor
creations-chat 2022-05-16 20:53:15 a lot of the people probably downvoted for the exposed motorlock
other than that the missiles are at an odd place and the back side just looks blocky
creations-chat 2022-05-17 16:32:40 i agree 150 is a good spot

hof is for the people that are putting way too much effort in a single build, it is supposed to be hard
creations-chat 2022-05-17 17:41:39 wait was that the yellow name guy that kept arguing about builds?
help 2022-05-17 17:43:30 they are way too heavy
help 2022-05-17 17:43:56 did you put just one or multiple?
creations-chat 2022-05-17 17:45:07 you are right
creations-chat 2022-05-18 19:16:19 i just came here and nope im not dealing with this bye
contest-chat 2022-05-19 10:54:33 we have a winner gentleman
creations-chat 2022-05-21 19:51:23 oh hey the cooldown is 1 minute and 40 seconds now
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:20:22 it is finally finished

now i will ask for feedback as what i could do if something is horribly and i mean horribly wrong
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:23:12 thank you for the feedback, i will work more on the colours in my other builds then

i started it 2 years ago but because of real life stuff it took way longer than it should, i think it would be 4 months if we forget about real life <@652341016510201856>
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:26:41 i mean sometimes you just forget the most obvious thing while building
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:29:09 i just did it and it took an hour and a half

alr ima post this in creations, there seems to be no obvious flaws on it
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:35:40 the votes failed :/

thx yousuf for fixing it

i honestly didn't check it
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:37:53 it is perspective, the whole build is a lie (real)

<@464259154916147211> 51k blocks
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:41:06 it is all in ruins, what a garbage creation
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:43:23 you are correct, yes it did take long but shows no sign of skill yet people see it and instantly like it
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:45:26 in my book it is not a thing that takes skill, a thing that takes skill is something in the lines of this which i cannot do yet

also thanks for the feedback, i will look out to fix those on later builds

large builds are mindless block spams most of the time, there is one part that confuses and that is figuring out how to make it that large
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:49:40 there is actually ammo inside, the big bright green thing inside is that, i probably should have put some black stuff inside to make it look powdered
it does shoot i just forgot to take photos of it
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:52:30 yes
for most of the build it is just that

<@853042393309904897> i wanted it to be a tank
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:55:59 it is the same size but the front has been bugging me with the mig
idk i never saw hars jet in person or compared it

the difference is that one hell lot of angles you need to make just to progress a single block
creations-chat 2022-05-24 17:58:22 yep i missed a spot there
these are made with alts, it is hard for me to compare all at once
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:17:00 thank you
4 months if you forget about other real life stuff that doesn't include sleeping
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:20:58 it is only a few people that keep coming here and starting to talk crap to builds
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:29:12 i think that jet deserved it, looks really cool
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:32:51 they are not that obvious, it looks cool and that is what matters
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:35:45 wow
creations-chat 2022-05-24 18:47:11 i know you are asking rbk but the suspension for the landing gear could be lowered, they look way too high and the ruder needs more angle to the back
creations-chat 2022-05-24 19:59:58 i simply made it up while building
creations-chat 2022-05-24 20:14:08 i have no idea what it is, it was first a tank with big gun then slowly it turned to a stationary gun but it is still able to move
creations-chat 2022-05-24 20:19:39 they had fair points and feedback
creations-chat 2022-05-25 18:28:58 mods are not online 24/7 and i believe people don't report arguments until way later
creations-chat 2022-05-25 18:33:26 they could hire mods that are more active but i bet that is not happening until pcc 2 comes
creations-chat 2022-05-27 04:33:08 Can someone send a photo of the build here?

I can see why people were suspicious that thing is so good
creations-chat 2022-05-27 04:37:16 i think because of the nose cone being perfect it looked out of the game for some people
creations-chat 2022-05-27 04:46:30 yeah it is easy to prove if it is real unless it is fake
creations-chat 2022-05-27 05:00:03 oh they back
creations-chat 2022-05-27 05:04:06 <@702907851001167882> nvm i got confused
creations-chat 2022-05-29 19:46:54 if you want to have fun do not talk in creations chat, some people take stuff way too seriously
i improved myself without this server and it helped a lot
creations-chat 2022-05-30 12:20:24 send it as one message next time

or edit if you want to add more info to it
<@738702049113538600> rude
creations-chat 2022-05-30 15:31:26 <@710260189496082504> wip(work in progress) creations are not allowed in creations, i suggest removing it before a mod comes
creations-chat 2022-05-31 17:32:22 i have no clue how that got any upvotes, it is just a bunch of ropes
creations-chat 2022-06-19 17:11:01 if it is going to get deleted might aswell upvote who cares
creations-chat 2022-06-19 18:25:36 o7
creations-chat 2022-06-20 12:12:40 maus looks really long without the turret, that might be the confusion here
creations-chat 2022-07-24 15:57:35 i did send a request to an admin but im guessing they didn't see it, im not going to bother with it because i am playing stormworks instead of plane crazy these days

i sent it to rbk

alr, thx for the info
