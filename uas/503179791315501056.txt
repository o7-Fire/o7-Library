creations-chat 2020-03-04 16:09:32 hovertank prototype 2.2 | 263 blocks | finally FINALLY after having to wait a whole day i can post this creation! introducing the PIE RND (renamed after a good night's sleep) omnidirectional hovertank! this vehicle is the 2nd ideration of my first hovercraft but with more hover power and firepower! it features 8 axis simetry and with 8 sets of legs each with their individual suspention and a set of 2 hoverpads. it's natural state is upright and it will stay upright even when falling. the design has been updated 2 more times hence the .2 (.1 asthetic changes and block count decrease, .2 improved balance)
i love using this craft and it replaced my bicopter as my goto transport.

hope ya'll like it!

(sidenote: i was told i can ask for ranks here so may i ask for designer? thx in advance!)

the-dump 2020-03-12 12:02:22 The idea of a bad that wets itself is bed
help 2020-03-13 05:45:39 <@!399747820078366722> it depends... you probably know that the control surfaces will automatically adjust your plane to have mouse control.

but if you want to build a mouse controlled turret per say you can use motor 2s as they will also try to follow your mouse. keep in mind that motor2s will try to turn the smallest side (turret side) towards your mouse so you can't really make gyros using them
help 2020-03-13 05:46:53 not really hard to use
help 2020-03-13 05:47:14 they only get laggy when u have turrets on turrets on turrets ect
help 2020-03-13 05:48:09 also even trough motor2s have keybindings, those keybinds will do nothing so just ignore them
help 2020-03-13 05:49:04 they are for if you set a motor2 to "servo" which makes it stop following mouse and turns it into a steering hinge instead

help 2020-03-13 19:56:33 how many images can i submit to a contest (of one creation)
the-dump 2020-03-13 20:45:15 TIL at chemistry class that u can turn raspberry aroma into a liquid with a high ethanol content (around 20%) with just water making it an adult drink! it just doesn't like to dissolve so u may need to warm it up a bit...

(warning: do not actually do this as it might create a really unpleasant oder...)
(warning2: do not actually drink the created substance as the high amount of left over aroma may cause serious kidney problems)
(warning3: oh by the way there's also around 20% pure Vinegar created so if you don't like having your throat burned then i don't really recommend)
(warning4: this really is just a dumb TIL... if you do this your whole house will smell of vinegar, alcohol, and raspberries)
(warning5: seriously don't)
(warning6: if you light any sort of fire near the reaction the forming alcohol vapor may catch fire and or explode)
(warning7: if i had to speculate you're probably too young to drink anyways)
(final note: buying actual drinks is less expensive than the amount of aroma needed anyways so DON'T DO THIS)
the-dump 2020-03-13 20:47:09 chemistry classes are dangeorous
the-dump 2020-03-13 20:49:51 you prob don't have enough aroma for that tho
the-dump 2020-03-13 20:50:08 u need a bit more aroma than water
the-dump 2020-03-13 20:50:54 as the aroma has extra stuff in it that doesn't take place in the reaction
the-dump 2020-03-13 20:55:41 (warning8: do not dare substitute with any other kind of aroma as for example the same experiment with pineapple aroma makes methanol which causes blindness and can easily kill you when overdosed (methanol is also com monlyused in antifreeze)

When you press the activation key again it stops.

It's less convenient but maybe it still helps somewhat...

Story in detail: He was stating that "he was testing his GPU preformance", the whole server was complaining to him. I told him politely that there is software that measures preformance precisely as well as roblox games to test the preformance but he refused. I then proceeded to tell him that if he really wants to test in plane crazy at least buy a VIP server for it as if he has money for a new GPU he also has for a VIP server since it's not that expensive. He said he doesn't spend money on robux and proceeded to reload his lag machine making the servermates asking in all caps for him to stop. I told him that i will contact rick about this, in response he quickly left the server, but by that time i already had the pic and his user.
