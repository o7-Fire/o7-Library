The Tale of ♡~Poke~♡ (780474324241874964)
help 2022-09-18 07:01:28 So I wanna make a helicopter that looks like it's been made in someone's backyard in a country 
I have made the rotors but idk how to make the body since I used tutorial on how to make a rotor this is my first time making a heli please help
help 2022-09-18 08:41:55 I can't post it in creations since I can't upload images there
I finished the makeshift helicopter just gotta add the paint for the body then I'm done
help 2022-09-22 02:03:48 Helicopter
Type: custom (not based on anything) 
The issue is that it can't stay stabilised while in the air and while landing (when landing the nose will go down) 
Any tips on how I can fix this
