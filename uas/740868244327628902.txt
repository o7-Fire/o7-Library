bug-reports 2022-11-03 14:59:43 Anyone experiencing the issue that if you use a disconnector on your rocket and it contains wing panels, any other engine than propeller engine, control surfaces, so that when you launch the rocket it just freezes in place?

creations-chat 2022-12-14 13:11:53 So great succes, since <#384025409945337856>  is also fart
creations-chat 2022-12-14 13:16:36 Tip:
Looks like the middle part has no potential for Z-fighting, so stack another plane with motor lock under it

The ultimate livery is a massive dump of z figthing so you cant concerate on the plane bc it hurts eyes


Or make some boring normal livery
