help 2022-02-08 12:41:41 So recently ive been messing around testing aesthetics, like a ring rotating around a warp craft.
help 2022-02-08 12:41:51 Not focused on building anything particularly detailed.
help 2022-02-08 12:42:01 Built a fun PVP ratte, but thats about it.
help 2022-02-08 12:42:27 Anyone know how people are able to mesh several "layers" of wings, and blocks at a certain position on their aircaft for details?
help 2022-02-08 12:42:33 Last one i built looked like this.
help 2022-02-08 12:43:00 While not horrible, its outdated and hasnt been updated since 2018
help 2022-02-08 12:43:18 It can turnfight, and keep up with modern jets, but only to a certain point.
help 2022-02-08 12:44:19 So im wanting to build something more akin to Ace Combat.
help 2022-02-08 12:44:26 However, its hard when im limited to this.
help 2022-02-08 12:51:54 its OlD

help 2022-02-08 12:51:57 really old
help 2022-02-08 12:52:06 1000 block limit old?
help 2022-02-08 12:52:09 i think
help 2022-02-08 12:52:19 cause i remember i couldnt build the ratte for PVP then
help 2022-02-08 12:52:27 and no one had conveyors
help 2022-02-08 12:53:34 It was called the SU 52-X
help 2022-02-08 12:53:45 i still have that ratte
help 2022-02-08 12:53:46 hold on
help 2022-02-08 12:54:28

help 2022-02-08 12:55:59 uses friction blocks for tracks, and a small 1 block conveyor engine inside.
help 2022-02-08 12:56:09 has cutter armor against shredders, and explosive armor.
help 2022-02-08 12:56:19 this
help 2022-02-08 12:56:49 Ive hid a ceiling to the point i can't exactly build more details with normal blocks without getting painfully creative.
help 2022-02-08 12:57:00 It retains the idea.
help 2022-02-08 12:57:10 Its way smaller, and has more or less the same layout of weapons.
help 2022-02-08 12:57:21 Plus
help 2022-02-08 12:57:26 it was made in what, 2017?
