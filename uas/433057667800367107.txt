events-chat 2022-02-09 10:52:43 I not a very good builder anyways
events-chat 2022-02-09 10:52:59 so it would be a waste of my and the other attendees time
events-chat 2022-02-09 10:53:48 most of my stuff is functional but dosn't look good, and isnt very combat applicable
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:28:40 yhea i have quite a few test builds, dosnt usally work out
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:29:00 My most successful are probably my zepplins
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:30:23 i usually get it done right...
events-chat 2022-02-09 11:30:59 i wouldnt say im a complete novice but im very obviously outclassed by a lot of builds i look at
