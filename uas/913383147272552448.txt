creations-chat 2023-07-10 19:00:50 I spend way too much time and money on plane crazy.
creations-chat 2023-07-10 19:03:28 What do you mean?
creations-chat 2023-07-10 19:07:08 What do you mean?
It's meant to be blocky. Search up SCP CB 106 cell on google and see
creations-chat 2023-07-10 19:11:57 I also have another build with way too much motorlock for my tiny brain to handle
help 2023-07-10 20:19:28 If you mean trapdoors, turn physics on in the anchor block. <@983835008898842675> , that's what physics does.
help 2023-07-10 20:20:32 Try replacing the trapdoors with piston and motor doors? Idk send screenshot in my dms

bot-central 2023-07-11 22:18:42 ?suggest Better paint buckets.
Other.

Make an option for the paint bucket, so that it only paints certain grouped together parts, and not the entire build. For example, you just disconnect your wing from the fuselage, use the bucket and only that wing gets painted because it's not attached to the fuselage.

help 2023-07-13 13:08:05 I'm building a 1910s era cruise liner based on the titanic and there are still huge gaps in the hull. Do I fill those in using angle lock or just normal wedges somehow? Any more tips to make the ship better?

creations-chat 2023-07-13 13:34:12 You need a sort of counterweight to make it not fall over when the job extends, it's usually in the form of a heavy block at the back somewhere

help 2023-07-13 14:02:36 Left. You can also use angle lock to make it smoother if you want.

help 2023-07-14 21:35:13 Do you have any tips to improve my ship, other than the things I listed in my previous message?
help 2023-07-14 21:36:27 I mean, I'm already gonna make the hull wider at the bottom for stability...
help 2023-07-14 21:36:50 I can't really make the superstructure bigger without messing up my angle lock...
help 2023-07-14 21:36:59 I could try lifeboats?...
help 2023-07-14 21:37:18 After angle locking the hull though, that's more important...
help 2023-07-14 21:37:36 And getting it higher above the waterline without it capsizing.
help 2023-07-14 21:38:05 I already fixed the lighting, but maybe I'll add cables holding up the funnels?....

creations-chat 2023-07-16 10:11:25 <@660019099430289418> thank you.
creations-chat 2023-07-16 10:14:33 What is wrong with it then? You could at least help me improve.
creations-chat 2023-07-16 10:18:03 I might as well remove it. What did people expect from my first ship? At least it moves, floats and is stable.

I'm taking it down to work on it then.
creations-chat 2023-07-16 10:22:26 Shut up. Nobody asked you. I'm just going to work on my ship and repost it then. Thank you, everyone in <#504436696021204992> (except <@984160483831590954> ). I'll be happy to use your help to improve.
creations-chat 2023-07-16 10:26:04 Thanks, SwagCat852. I'm just going to work on the boat and repost it, like I said. It only has to be good enough for me to get the shipwright (I) rank. It never says that to get it, the community has to like your ship.
