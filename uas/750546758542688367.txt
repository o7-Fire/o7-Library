creations-chat 2022-11-03 11:53:38 hello mitsu lol
creations-chat 2022-11-05 11:16:05 its our first car, some people think its shit but its good in our opinion
creations-chat 2022-11-05 11:38:17 oh hell no im not gonna change the wheels, i call it "wheel scale" cars. idk try to build a car instead of just talking shit, i saw you make some planes and imo you're not entitled to talk about ours if you havent built like it
creations-chat 2022-11-05 11:45:04 lastly, this s15 is so hard to make yet it has stock wheels, i will disagree if you think this is bad just because it has stock wheels ( build not mine )

<@919549929754607616> yes lmao, good s15 ngl
creations-chat 2022-11-05 11:47:06 yeah one of the best "wheel scale" cars ive seen, i love every inch of it
