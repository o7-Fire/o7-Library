plane-crazy 2020-07-22 02:01:34 It has a filter
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 02:01:31 Oh okay
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 01:50:09 I don't want more blocks I want Motor 2 to work smh
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 01:49:55 Someone should tell the developer he should fix the stupid Motor 2
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 01:49:35 I was thinking to use Motor 2 for a battering ram to replace my Motor 1's because it has controllable radius but the input literally only works half of te time
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 01:48:28 And then with no settings it's actual mouse control
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 01:48:12 Like half of the time it's working and half of the time it is not
plane-crazy 2020-07-22 01:47:57 Motor 2 is totally broken
