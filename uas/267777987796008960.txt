The Tale of syncinus (267777987796008960)
bug-reports 2020-07-22 01:52:58 Motor 2 input literally only works half of the time when using it as Servo
bug-reports 2020-07-22 01:54:34 What's happening for me is that I have two gigantic battering rams, and I am switching from Motor1 to Motor2 for them, but the input is literally only working half of the time (I wonder if it's also related to my mouse), It is also on Servo mode
bug-reports 2020-07-22 01:55:28 Sometimes only 1 Motor2 will turn on and the other will just not do anything
bug-reports 2020-07-22 01:55:29 Yes it is
bug-reports 2020-07-22 01:55:47 
bug-reports 2020-07-22 01:56:03 It's not mouse movement, it's key input
bug-reports 2020-07-22 01:56:21 It's not responding to my key input half of the time, and sometimes only one of them doesn't respond and sometimes it's both
bug-reports 2020-07-22 01:57:17 Alright, that fixed it, though it makes the battering ram a bit more annoying to do
bug-reports 2020-07-22 01:57:53 So the actual bug is that input sometimes fails to register in servo mode with toggle on Motor2
bug-reports 2020-07-22 02:00:20 Motor2 is also impractical sometimes because sometimes it has a siezure in non-servo mode and murders the vehicle so that too
