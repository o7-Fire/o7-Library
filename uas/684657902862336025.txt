creations-chat 2023-02-23 14:25:25 Is it possible to make a combiner
creations-chat 2023-02-23 14:41:27 I think another way you can make 2 seperate objects combine together would be to have 2 rods with small holes in them sticking out of one while 2 holes are on the other with pistons to push into the holes in the rod to keep it in place
Kinda like a power outlet but with extra security
