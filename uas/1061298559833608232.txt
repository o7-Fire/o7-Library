help 2023-01-08 14:48:09 pretty simple, place ballast tanks if you want it to be able to sink  in the middle of the ship if your folding your center of mass line should be in the middle so put the tanks into that direction and use super rocket engines for speed, if you`r making a bigger ship like a cargo ship or a carrier etc,make the rudder 4x4  or bigger if you want

help 2023-01-08 14:51:33 the cylinder cockpit looks nice but the the first half wedge down,up should be normal halfwedge cause the top is sticking out  and it looks ugly you can leave it like that i wont judge you but if you want a better desing then yeah.
