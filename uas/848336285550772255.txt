creations-chat 2022-05-04 06:50:39 Can't that just be a single motor being locked?
creations-chat 2022-05-04 06:58:21 But why do you put this much effort to bring someone down?
creations-chat 2022-05-04 07:00:21 The first thing you saw was a flaw.
creations-chat 2022-05-04 07:09:14 But this guy is looking for the approval and praise from people who would rather see the flaws and lies instead of the creation itself. He also said that it was a GOAL, not a claim that it was made with no motolocking. Lastly. nice duragatory language prick.
creations-chat 2022-05-04 07:11:28 Please read the whole sentence.
creations-chat 2022-05-04 07:15:59 What do you think "It was a challenge," means?
All it means is that it was hard or difficult to do. He never claimed he achieved his goal just it was hard to do. Also if you actually read the start of the sentence he says he made it his GOAL!
creations-chat 2022-05-04 07:20:45 All you had to do was say that. Did you really have to defend yourself that you didn't sound like he was pulling shit out of his ass which he kinda was. Also if there was another guy calling him out why did you have to join in.
creations-chat 2022-05-04 07:22:56 I'm not. I'm just saying that there really isn't any point of being so aggressive. I mean he's the one being ranked. Just downvote him and leave.
creations-chat 2022-05-04 07:24:39 Do it then. If you have the balls to say it. And a challenge means it was hard not that he completed his goal.

For example can someone explain why this doesn't work?
help 2022-12-24 19:11:29 I don't really know the conditions of camera locking.
help 2022-12-24 20:20:56 Weird so it has to be sorta of a free block
help 2022-12-24 20:42:16 Oh thankyou
help 2022-12-24 20:42:48 Can I use a motor to connect it since the motor is technically a free block?
help 2022-12-24 20:43:24 Oh
help 2022-12-24 20:43:43 So how do I connect a camera lock to my build?

creations-chat 2022-12-27 23:30:21 But I saw wip before though. Eh ok.
creations-chat 2022-12-27 23:34:59 So wait what if I just remove the part where I say it's a wip and wait a few days when people forget and repost the actual finished creation then?
creations-chat 2022-12-27 23:38:15 But how often do mods search each creation?
creations-chat 2022-12-27 23:41:50 So wait you guys look up each username of the creators of each creation ever posted in order to make sure they don't post a creation similar to a past image? Also when Is a build fully completed? You can always improve and make it better.

creations-chat 2023-01-01 19:52:35 
creations-chat 2023-01-03 23:11:50 Yeah it's for looks
You can try making a working ornithopter if you want
creations-chat 2023-01-05 18:48:19 It's really hard to make a smooth long cone.
creations-chat 2023-01-05 18:50:26 Can I have proof at least?
creations-chat 2023-01-05 18:53:01 I mean 2 simple angle locks doesn't make an accurate nose cone🤷
creations-chat 2023-01-05 18:55:07 Yeah I guess so for the recent one in creations but making nose cones for the Mig-29 and shii is hard. Or like the F-22
creations-chat 2023-01-05 18:58:15 Get that shite outa here I already know that crap. Also it's called a nose cone, idk if there's a more common name for it.
creations-chat 2023-01-05 19:00:18 Yeah I was talking about nose cones not just (cones)
creations-chat 2023-01-05 19:02:27 They never said they were talking about the one in creations haole
creations-chat 2023-01-05 19:04:33 What are you talkin about. I never was talking about your fictional hat. I thought realistic nosecones were a thing of skill
creations-chat 2023-01-05 19:08:04 I never even made an argument why are you trying so hard to be right without even bringing about statements even related to the topic? Dudes wearing crocs in-doors rn
creations-chat 2023-01-05 19:10:44 I was talking about nose cones in general and dude brings up a hat.
creations-chat 2023-01-05 19:12:57 Oh now he's trying to use dumb ass comebacks to try and offend me in order to win now. Wow the statement really discombobulated my entire argument. Also that's not even an argument. I was just saying I know what an angle lock is. I also stated my ignorance so you guys don't need to prove anything to me.
creations-chat 2023-01-05 19:15:01 What are you implementing? All you said was that there's a tutorial for cones.
creations-chat 2023-01-05 19:17:21 Yeah I never said anything about that to start an argument. You just took what I said the wrong way.
creations-chat 2023-01-05 19:20:58 Why?
creations-chat 2023-01-05 19:23:03 Also <@712273624865701921> Iooked back at your chat history. Your literally a troll for hobby💀
creations-chat 2023-01-05 19:25:48 Man you guys don't even know what this dumbass argument is about
creations-chat 2023-01-05 19:29:04 The plot literally fell off the table
creations-chat 2023-01-05 19:31:12 Dude smh still on about an argument that's not even yours? Sit down dude. The argument is literally over.

It's agree to disagree alright?

creations-chat 2023-01-05 19:36:36 Good. This image must be shared
creations-chat 2023-01-05 19:38:53 
creations-chat 2023-01-05 19:41:16 If it's an object that's really "shrimple" you gotta make it really detailed in order to not be pelted by majority of this community. As many think they can always do better than what you do.
creations-chat 2023-01-05 19:43:39 
creations-chat 2023-01-05 19:45:51 Post multiple angles to show detail then. That would be your best bet.
creations-chat 2023-01-05 19:48:28 That sounds good. Most people focus on looks but mechanization can be appreciated.
creations-chat 2023-01-05 20:07:32 Try make something of a tank autoloader like the on the T-80 or French tanks. If you can.
creations-chat 2023-01-06 04:50:59 I know already check the whole argument below my message

creations-chat 2023-01-13 06:35:36 Nice. I really like the Zeon amphibious mobile suits. My favorite would be the Zee Zulu
creations-chat 2023-01-13 06:39:46 Yeah. Those are pretty far ahead in the UC timeline. You should try check out Thunderbolt. It shows both sides views in the war
creations-chat 2023-01-13 06:41:58 Origins is more about the characters than the mobile suits but it's an awesome story about Char
creations-chat 2023-01-13 06:44:41 It's a damaged Kshatriya in the middle of repairs. It uses a Federation beam gatling and homing missiles instead of funnels. I think it's the variant the Kshatriya was destroyed on by the Banshee
creations-chat 2023-01-13 06:47:46 Are you familar with mobile armors?
creations-chat 2023-01-13 06:53:01

creations-chat 2023-01-21 04:28:26 It seems that F18s have a very very similar way to build depending what you're trying to do https://youtu.be/-b1hmGvOl9I

https://youtu.be/iD-pSZHpZdU
creations-chat 2023-01-21 04:31:04 Now for the second video he easily could've repainted and changed the rocket to jet engines but I think it's common for details and designs to repeat itself with the F-18 Hornet
creations-chat 2023-01-21 04:33:53 Can you try take a screenshot similar to this?

creations-chat 2023-06-17 02:27:24 He put more effort into writing this than the actual plane

creations-chat 2023-06-17 07:16:58 That's actually a good tip. i was gonna try make it out of wedges which would've looked not as good\
creations-chat 2023-06-17 07:44:12 You use powered/locked motors to make an angle while connected to a motor lock tower delayed by springs/disconnectors/tnt to lock it all together and make custom angles, rotations, and shapes.
