help 2020-10-29 13:47:17 • Is at least 100 blocks.

• Proof must be submitted as a video.

i was actually trying to counter it

help 2020-11-09 14:57:29 they are
help 2020-11-09 14:58:02 thats what i-
help 2020-11-09 15:00:28 > <@!526713899958140928> that's called dissymmetry of lift from what I see, it's basically wind wanna do funny with the rotor spinning in one way, so now it kinda tilts the helicopter, one way to fix it is by ~~swashplate~~ having more control over your helicopter or by fine-tuning the weight, this effect also applies to the tail rotor, so putting it on the other side might help, otherwise add delta wing in the direction the rotor is spinning
i kinda fixed it by making the rotors go clockwise instead of anti and i reduced the number of wing panels on the blades. but it just kinda made it hard to turn right though turning left was butter
